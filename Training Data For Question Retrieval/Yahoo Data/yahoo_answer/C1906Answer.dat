Press the small button on the back of the router with a paper clip or other thin object to reset. Then if you have linksys router, the default password is admin with no user name. For Netgear it is usually admin for the username and password for the password. You can find out by checking the documentation for your particular router.

AA11622701	A server is nothing more or less than a standard computer, but it is being used for a specific purpose.  Any of your three computers could be used as a server.    A server is simply a computer which makes files or programs available from it to other computer.  It can be a file server, where everyone in the company has space to store their documents and spreadsheets so that other co-workers can access them.  It may be a print server which allows a single printer to be used by everyone on the network.  It could be an application server that has a program installed on it, and everyone else runs the program from that server.    It can also a web server.  That is a server that host a web site, and makes it available within the local network (an Intranet) or to the whole world (the Interner).      Usually when a computer is acting as a web server, that is the only function it performs.  People are not playing games on it or creating spreadsheets, etc.  So a web server does not need to have all the standard applications and programs of a regular computer.  The "server" version of Ubuntu and Windows are just stripped down version of the programs that do not include features normally not needed on a server (who needs Solitaire on the computer to host a web site?) and also include some extra programs and utilities that make it easier to manange a server.      Apache is one of those "server manangement" programs.  It is a program for creating and maintaining web pages and web servers.  Just like you need a word processor to create text documents, or a spreadsheet program to produce spreadsheets, so you need a web creation program to make web pages. Apache is one of the best and most popular.  (Partly because it is an open source program, meaning it is available FREE.)      It is possible to host a web page from your own computer.  But realize that it means maintaining that page 24x7x365.  Something most people can not do.  And something that most ISPs will not allow because the bandwidth needed (the amount of Internet traffic caused by a web site) usually exceeds what they will permit for an individual account.  If you want to create a web site, there are dozens of free or lost cost ($5-20 a month) sites that will host the site for you.  And provide you with programs, features and utilites that would take you weeks to set up on your own.  For most people that is a better alternative then trying to host a site yourself.  But it can be done.  (Have done it before.)    Hope that information helps....|`|IIUqe4m0aa	A server is just a computer which provides a service to other computers, it could be hosting files, sharing printers or as you say hosting a website among other things.    However the word is usually used to mean a powerful computer which is running a server operating system, Windows Server, Ubuntu Server, Apache, which as designed specifically to be used in this way rather than to run desktop applications.      You could use one of your computers as a server, Windows XP/Vista is perfectly capable of hosting a website - although purpose built web server OS's are usually much better at it.  Beware the security risks of making your computer publicly accessible though!

First question is when was the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.    2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be a the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.     3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.       4. Another area is a hardware drivers. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestion and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing.  Check your drivers.     5. Lastly, check the dust buildup on the fan to make sure you system is cooling properly    http://www.delete-computer-history.com/f...|`|cxnrP97taa	STOP DOWNLOADING so much porn..  take of u mask also...    80's throwback mexican wrestlers are so overated.>!>!|`|LClopaGtaa	Read this,  http://www.compukiss.com/trouble-shootin...|`|808da1ba51e8fd80415df1fc03dcf21aaa	Power supply or fan problem maybe, but one would think your computer geek would have found that.|`|Vw5hR0Pyaa	Windows freezes or stops responding frequently.  This issue could be caused by any of the below possibilities.   1. Software related issue.   2. Driver related issue.   3. Operating system related issue.   4. Heat related issue.   5. Hardware issue.   6. Serious issue with Windows   7. Hardware failure.        An easy way to determine if your computer is in this situation is by pressing the Num Lock button on the keyboard and watching the Num Lock led to see if it turns off and/or on.  If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue. If you're encountering lockups when the computer is opening a particular program, make sure you have all the latest updates for that program.   Update your registry cleaner tool, scan you pc.  Use the tool: http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere... [if you do not have one]  Driver related issue   A computer lock up can also be caused by drivers. For example, if there is an issue that exists with your video drivers a computer could lock up while playing a game or displaying any other type of video. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all major devices in your computer (video, sound, modem, and network). Operating system related issue   Make sure your operating system has all of the latest updates installed on it.   Heat related issue   If the computer processor is getting too hot it can cause the computer to freeze. If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this could indicate a fan may be failing in your computer.|`|YTIDE8Evaa	Your problem might have several reasons.   1. The case might be dirty ,  getting overheated.   2. Power supply problem.  3. Lots of other reasons but these two are the usual suspects.

jIyInLZYaa	Your best bet is to use an anonymous proxy to maintain privacy while surfing the Internet.  Google keeps everything you do associated with your IP address so masking your IP address and refreshing it with a new one will allow you to stay one step ahead of the game.    I know the proxy I use automatically refreshes my IP for me every 30 minutes...this is really helpful since I don't have to remember to go in and manually do it every so often.    You can find a lot of free proxy servers, but I always advise to stay away from these.  I think it is better to pay a few dollars and know that I have someone helping me stay protected...anyone can set up a proxy site, but they offer no real protection other than masking your IP.  A pay proxy will come with other advanced security features (such as the auto refresh feature).|`|6N4NoM6uaa	Google isn't storing what you look up. The dropdown box of previously serched for items is being stored on your own PC. Can you imagine how much storage space Google would need just to store everyone's search history?    The only people in a position on the network to observe the sites you visit is your ISP and using a proxy server isn't going to stop that. You pass through your ISP to get to anywhere, including the proxy server you choose to use.     No-one can get your personal info from your ISP (unless they're a law enforcement agency and have a legal reason to obtain it, otherwise it's a breach of privacy and if your ISP gives it out, which they won't, they're liable for prosecution).

Normally I would have suggested you use Cute Partition Manager http://www.majorgeeks.com/download5369.h... to partition your hard drive so you have a new empty partition for Windows 7.  But if 25 GB is really all you have, you would be better of forgetting about installing a second OS and stick with XP|`|U0CbEV8Gaa	First of all remember this that windows 7 will be launched in 2010  so the copy of win. 7 you are having is false.  If you install it, it may be harmful  But if you still want to install it then make a bootable cd and boot from it. It will format the selected drive and install the new window.    I THINK YOU SHOULD WAIT TILL THE ORIGNAL WINDOWS 7 IS LAUNCHED!!!|`|l0QinWFGaa	your computer must be old as the dirt we stand on lol....You should just buy a new computer and put windows 7 on it.

7MU2IK7Iaa	Circumventing censorship rules in your country is illegal - please consider the possible consequences before attempting this!  (And also be aware that doing so to access porn will not get you any sympathies, like getting world news that your government might be withholding from you would.)    There are anonymous proxies, which do exactly what you need.  They are usually set up by organisations (some sponsored by the USA government) promoting freedom of information and intended for residents of countries like China, North Korea, Myanmar, Iran, Arabian states or others where heavy censorship is common.  It works like this: You send request to the proxy, which then gets the webpage in question and delivers it to you. Your service provider only sees a connection to the proxy, not to the banned server.  Since these proxies are anonymous, there are limitations: You cannot use any service that requires login or cookies, you also cannot purchase or pay anything online. Download speed is also usually quite slow.  Since such proxies are often themselves targets of censorship or bans, they change name and address often - and obviously listing them here would put them in danger. Therefore please use your favourite search engine to find them!

There is a version of Microsoft Office available for Macs. You can also use a free office suite called NeoOffice (which is the Mac-native version of OpenOffice).    Whether you should get a Mac or not is simply a matter of preference. Go to an Apple store and try it out and see if you like it. Or if you don't have an Apple store near you, ask a friend who has a Mac if you can play around with it for an hour or so.    If you like Macs (and can afford a Mac) get one.

AA11849917	I'll give you an answer, but first you have to read my "preaching" (like a "soup kitchen" that has a sermon first.)    It's wrong to use someone else's answer and claim it as your own.  If you have a similar question on a test, you won't have anyone to ask, and because you didn't research for yourself, if you merely copied the answer, you won't know what it's all about.  Also, if you use someone else's answer as your own, that's called "plagiarism", and it's cheating.    That disclaimer out of the way, I'll now tell you the answer.    The primary key of a table is the sorting order of a table.  It can consist of either one, or more than one field, and it must be unique for each record.  It is used for quickly locating a record based on criteria you request.    The foreign key is a unique field in a database that another table will use to access information, such as a "look up" table.  For instance, Table 1 might consist of names and addresses, keyed in by a unique identifier.  Table 2 might consist of city/state names, keyed in by the telephone area code.  The area code would be the foreign key, and table 1 would have a telephone field, including the area code.  The area code in table 2 ties in to the area code in table 2 (the look up table), tied together by the area code to return the city and state from which the phone number originates.  This area code in table 2 is a foreign field of table 2.|`|K1prVAsjaa	Well, this should be in your text book, but - primary keys are unique values used to uniquely identify and assist in indexing a record in a given table. Foreign keys are fields that are primary keys in another table (like a reference table) but not in the given table, but that are linked to the other table.    Actually Wikipedia has answers like this that are much better than mine:|`|dkotfrm6aa	primary key is used to identify a tuple uniquly in a table    foregin key is used to bind the colum or  attribute(having primary key) of table1 to another colum or attribute(having primary key) of table2

JsHG73v9aa	1. I have had my HP for 3 years now and the only time the fan doesn't run is when it's sleeping or off. This of course concerns me since it might burn out the fan motor. But, it has been 3 years and no problems. I also have a dual core processor that I imagine gets rather warm thus causing the fan to run. Contact HP through their support site and see what they have to say.  2. Battery life is a bunch of BS. You get what you get especially if your fan is running constantly. Mine came with a 12 cell Li-ion battery and at first would only last 3-3.5 hours while using and I am running XP Pro and not Vista. Again, check HP's web site and the tool to reset your battery.    I would make sure you put your laptop to sleep whenever possible - that is what I do not only with my laptop but also with my HP Vista desktop. It not only saves you money, but reduces the stress on the rest of the components.
FjpGG3INaa	1) Try setting your IP address to one you know works (not automatic)    2) driver problems with your modem can cause the issue, be sure everything is updated correctly.    3) service providers do have issues, especially on wireless, likewise someone else could be "stealing" the wireless connection, essentially leaving no more IP adresses left on that network. If this is a home network try adding a password to protect from this.     4) If your hard wired connection works, try disabling your wireless connection and re-enabling it.

If not, I don't believe you can|`|MxculX2Daa	Nope|`|WiflZqRLaa	u can do this if u dont have a another admin account   Petter Nordahl-Hagen's Offline NT Password & Registry Editor     This is absolutely one of the best free tools to reset the administrator password and gain access that I have ever used. It modifies the encrypted password in the registry's SAM file allowing you access to the account in Windows NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista systems.    There is an image file to create a bootable floppy disk or bootable CD to modify the admin password and access NTFS partitions. You do not need to know the old password to set a new one. It will also offer to unlock disabled or locked user accounts (a very helpful feature).  The program was just updated on April 9, 2007 to include Vista support.    Please visit the site by clicking on the link below to download a CD image or floppy image of this great program.    http://home.eunet.no/pnordahl/ntpasswd/    LoginRecovery.com    Another option is to decrypt the password and show you the actual administrator password. A great site for doing this is loginrecovery.com. Basically, you download a small program to extract the password from the computer, then you submit the encrypted password file to their site and they will recover the lost password. Of course, you need a computer with Internet access to upload the file and find the password.     With this option, the administrator password is not changed so you wont lose access to EFS encrypted files. Visit their site by clicking below    http://www.loginrecovery.com    Although there are probably other options to recover an administrator password, I find the two option shown above to be the quickest and easiest ways to either change or discover the password and allow you access to the user profile and data stored on the hard drive.    if u do have another admin account login to account and change the password of the previous account|`|Ys93CtU0aa	I think there is password hacking software available.

Then it will tell you to enter a new password. Type it in and press enter and you have overwrite the password. (p.s. when you type the password it won't look like it you typing it in but you are.)    2.If you have no other accounts then restart your computer and press F8 and go into safe mode with command prompt and type in the stuff I have just told you on number 1.|`|Caw0wUOFaa	well there is a way, when ur computer starts press F8, and it will show u ask a black screen and where u select "Safe mode" and press enter.Then when logon screen appears, click on " administrator" and then after opening, go to control panel and then to user account. After opening user account click on ur account and then just select remover ur password. Ur password will easily go away. Do not worry this won"t harm ur computer.

If the slow speed is to do with line conditions or ISP issues then they will still exist after a router is installed.  If its due to configuration problems on your PC then connecting wirelessly is unlikely to have any effect on that.    Do a speed test at www.speedtest.net  If you have XP try the TCP/IP Optimiser at http://www.speedguide.net/downloads.php  Free download and sets all you networking and internet settings to optimum (on the download page)  Used it many, many times - but not designed for Vista|`|KlRo6JLQaa	no.|`|6N4NoM6uaa	No. Any network is only as fast as the slowest link, and that'd be the connection between you and your ISP. Even if your packets of data could make it to your router at the speed of light, you still have to wait for the slowest link (to your ISP) and the only way you can make that faster is to pay for a higher bandwidth service.|`|3bHEkQCJaa	No, and further more wireless could even slow your connection speed down.  The way wireless works is it sends packets and waits for confirmation that the packets were received if it never gets confirmation it will resend the packets.  The sending of those packets is blind until it gets a confirmation.  Depending on the environment which you place your wireless router and depending on what is between the PC and the router, will determine your connection speeds on your network.  Those speeds will effect your internet speed.    Obstacles include metal cabinets, cinder block walls, and elevator shafts to name a few.  I've heard horror stories of connections dropping as low as the old 14.4k modems due to packet loss from interference or obstacles causing a weak signal.  For guaranteed speed on your end use a wired connection and a router that supports 100/1000 mB connection speeds and ensure your Ethernet card can support the same.

If you're getting a 2.5" portable HDD, it will only need the USB slot to power it.

The flash disk is a lot more portable though and you can easily chuck it with your keys, i keep it with me all the time.

Linux and Mac will have no problems as the fetch algorithms have already been included in the kernel though on the otherhand would run terrible under Vista since it was optimised for the good old hard drives that took time to seek and read.     In english, the 250gb hard drive will keep up with the cheaper SSD that would be found in a netbook and both will do anything you want it to given capacity.

They have DOZENS of testing servers on the Internet covering the US, Europe, and many other parts of the world, so it should be very easy to find a local server to your area.    This will give you both your upload and download speeds as well as your average PING response... compare its findings with what your ISP is supposed to be giving you.

n7UCMIFLaa	Hope this helps:    First click Start> Run> bring up a command prompt by typing in "CMD" and type " fsutil dirty query d: ". This queries the drive, and more than likely it will tell you that it is dirty. Next, type "CHKNTFS /X D:". The X tells Windows to NOT check that particular drive on the next reboot. At this time, manually reboot your computer, it should not do a Chkdsk and take you directly to Windows.    Once Windows has fully loaded, bring up another CMD prompt and now you want to do a Chkdsk manually by typing "Chkdsk /f /r d:". This should take you through 5 stages of the scan and will unset that dirty bit. Finally, type "fsutil dirty query d:" and Windows will confirm that the dirty bit is not set on that drive. Good luck!

This basically means that professionals from all over the world, as well as the common users, can interact, mold, and manifest a fully functional Web browser. To put it shortly: it is customized for you.    Firefox boasts stronger security than Internet Explorer, yet it is not perfect. Since most computer viruses and fraudulent-based Web sites cater to computers running Windows operating systems, the best browser to use would probably be Safari on a Mac OS.    I have used both Safari and Firefox and I still use Firefox simply because it is incredibly customizable and runs masterfully faster than Internet Explorer.    What it all boils down to is this: preference.    Google Chrome is a great browser, but that's all it is: a Web browser. Google created it just for the basics.    Firefox is great. It has an incredible array of customizations to install to make your browser run faster, but also play music, organize information, RSS Feeds, etc etc.    Internet Explorer is pretty good, too, but the organization is cluttered. It is confusing to the average user who was trained on Windows XP or earlier.    And now the new IE is on it's way of being rolled out with Windows 7. It's definitely something to watch out for.

In a Thin Client environment, the operating system, something like Windows Terminal Services, installed on a central server, and the Thin Client computers merely act as a mouse, keyboard and monitor to give the user access to the programs on the server.    In this way, systems admins can control progams and install updates very easily - there's only one computer (the server) which needs administering.

7eWHunfOaa	Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" and their interactions to design applications and computer programs. Programming techniques may include features such as encapsulation, modularity, polymorphism, and inheritance. It was not commonly used in mainstream software application development until the early 1990s.OOP may be seen as a collection of cooperating objects, as opposed to the more conventional model, in which a program is seen as a list of tasks (subroutines) to perform. In OOP, each object is capable of receiving messages, processing data, and sending messages to other objects.    Each object can be viewed as an independent machine with a distinct role or responsibility. The actions (or "operators") on the objects are closely associated with the object. For example, the data structures tend to carry their own operators around with them (or at least "inherit" them from a similar object or class). The conventional approach tends to consider data and behavior separate.  C++ is called an object-oriented programming language because it supports OOP.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	C++ was a first attempt to add object orientation to a procedural language.  It allows object-oriented programming, it's not an OO language.  (If objects have properties, the language is said to have some OO characteristics.)|`|DuZ8ITnYaa	Maybe because it supports object-oriented programming?|`|838TBllwaa	Objects are essentially packets that have both data and functions rolled into one. These are commonly expressed with classes. If you have used cin or cout for instance, you are using objects of the ostream and istream classes.     While a language like Java is pretty much purely object-oriented, C++ is derived from C, a procedural language, thus it can really use both object-oriented and procedural methods.    Procedural methods are where you define some data, and you have functions that act on that data, but they are seperate from each other.

The oldest one was CRT monitor (big, massive monitors that we all used for the last 10+ years and today still), the next one is LCD monitor which is very light and compact (very popular these days, slowly replacing old CRT monitors).

If I am correct, then let the database return the documents and then have code parse those documents for a paragraph.

If so, they will ask you to go into your internet browser and type in http://192.168....

XDOfrdn1aa	Hello wolf baby,    Videos from windows movie maker cannot be uploaded on youtube.com because youtube doesn't support it. windows movie maker is considered a project that is not really consided a video.    For success. In windows movie maker  go to "save to my computer" at the left panel and it will save your file as wmv. instead as a project file.   then use the wmv. and upload it on youtube and it will be successful.    Best Regards,  Preciosa R|`|vzqKVGnsaa	Hm, in what format is your video? Here is a link where you will find out about supported formats on YouTube, the optimal size of the video etc. http://www.youtube.com/t/howto_makevideo  If you need a converter you can easily find it online too. Just Google for "free  to  converter" and you'll find something.|`|46OYLEXWaa	Ensure the file format is correct before uploading to youtube...    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???|`|Fz2orULnaa	There are certain criteria you must follow to upload a video onto YouTube, such as file format and encoder used.

Y7jhIybzaa	In pseudo code because you didn't ask for a language.    Given input A[1..n]  List B    ///STEP 1  for(i = 1 to n){  if((A[i] % 5) ==0)  add A[i] to b  }    ///STEP 2  for(i = 1 to size B){  for(j = i to size B){  print(B[i], B[j])  }  }    Now for time analysis.     Best case is easy your array has no numbers divisible by five and STEP 2 is not run.     In this case your for loop runs exactly n times. Using the correct data structure insertion takes O(1) time and the if statement takes O(1) time. From this you can conclude that:  STEP 1 is run in O(n) time  and that in the best case the algorithm finishes in O(n) time      Worst case is a little more difficult to analyse.  STEP 1 has the same O(n) running time as before.  For the worst case the print in step 2 has to be run as many times as possible. Note that this print statement has O(1) running time as the array access should be O(1) and the print should be O(1).    STEP2 is run as many times as possible when every number in the array A is divisible by 5.  This yields an output statement for every single pair of numbers in the array a. From combinatorics we know that for an array size n there are n choose 2 paris.    As there is a print for every pair we get that the running time is:  O(1) * nC2  = O(1) * n(n-1)/2  = O(n^2)    The average case running time is the hardest usually this wouldn't be covered until pretty late in a comp sci degree but here goes anyway.    To determine the average case we have to determine on average how many numbers from A would enter B and thus how many pairs are in phase 2. If A is assumed to be random and uniformly distributed then the probability of one of the numbers in A being divisible by 5 is 1/5.    if you define the random variable X as the number of elements in B and Xi as  1 if Ai is divisible by 5  0 otherwise    E(Xi) = Pr(Ai is divisible by 5)*1 +  Pr(Ai is not divisible by 5)*0  E(Xi) = 1/5   then we have   X = X1 + X2 + ... + Xn  and  E(X) = E(X1) + E(X2) + ... + E(Xn)  by linearity of expectation  E(X) = 1/5 + 1/5 + ... + 1/5   (n times)  E(X) = n/5    thus the expected size of B is n/5 in the average case.    The number of pairs in an array of size n/5 is   n/5 C 2    And the average case running time is  O(1) * (n/5)C2  = O(1) * (n/5)((n/5)-1)/2  = O(n^2)      Hopefully that is clear feel free to find me if you have any clarification questions.
U0re5hicaa	Dont worry, i was new till I've just done my first transaction (as a seller) and mine went fine, well the buyer seemed happy. but my advice would be to keep in contact. email to ask when the item is going to be posted. do pay with payapl as it offers protection. check on the postage option. i.e. is it recorded delivery or special delivery. if it isnt, ask to change it tho it may incur a bit more money. at least then u will have proof of postage and i think there is the option of insuring items too.|`|2s5WSVbPaa	Paypal will protect your money and if you don't receive item you can open a dispute, if you are worried why not ask them to send it recorded delivery, this way it protects both of you, if they have good feedback you should be fine.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Check their feedback.

How old is the PC? you may try purchasing a can of compressed air, open the case and GENTLY spray air inside the computer to remove dust. Have someone check all the wiring connections and be sure that there are no obvious breaks in the wires.     If all of that does not fix the issue, you may need to re-format or recover the computer. There may be a sound driver issue. update the drivers via the manufacturer's site and restart.

m13Se2dAaa	I know the answer, though I'm missing a small piece of it...    As far as I can tell, the default text in Photoshop is what it calls Point Text - meaning it reacts the way you are seeing it - just types in a line until you put in line breaks.    You need Paragraph Text. The part I don't know is how to select the text tool and immediately make it paragraph text. So here's the closest I come. Select the text tool, type your first letter (don't type everything - when you convert, it will lose information).     Go to the layer palette. Right click on the text layer - do not have your cursor over the "T" icon - make sure it is to the right of it where it would normally show the sample text. Select Convert to Paragraph Text.    Go back and click in the text. You will now see a dashed surround box and handles. Pull the handles wherever you'd like your boundaries to be and type away.    That should do it for you, but if anyone can answer how to start with Paragraph Text, I'd love to learn!    EDIT: I just figured it out - I've been using Photoshop for years and never realized it. I'm embarrassed by myself infront of myself ;-)    Instead of just selecting the type tool and clicking to create an insertion point and starting to type (the way I always do), select the type tool, click, hold down the mouse and draw a box - that creates Paragraph Text.    And I realize that Jenny gave you the basic right information (though you don't need to use Transform to change the text box, just drag the handles).|`|c2f7ef4507c724db34ebbcc925ef59e1aa	Did you type within a text box? The text will only fit itself around objects on the same layer. Use the text tool to draw a box and type within that. when the box fills up draw another one wherever you want it. You can adjust the size of the boxes with the transform tool.

BsIAvIe0aa	In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools.  Theres a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)  click on the Troubleshooting link.  Heres my advice from it:    1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.    2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as youll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.       * McAfee Stinger  a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.     * SpyBot Search & Destroy  a spyware/adware scanner     * Lavasoft Adaware  for spyware/adware    Note  it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once youve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.    3.) If the above fails or youre not sure if youre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select Safe Mode and repeat the scans once youre connected.    I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!|`|AygEpMMaaa	http://www.superadblocker.com/    this is what i use,its the best 1 i have come across|`|14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	This might be trash from 'Adserver', one of the conglomerates of NAI.

e2104bb6f4cd0597228a673340a9a643aa	To change a background, you first make a copy of the original image and work on that instead of the original. You then make what's called a "selection" of either the background you want to replace or the foreground you want to use. The foreground selection is copied and pasted into a document with the desired background, producing an image composite. You use the same process to insert your image into any photo. It usually requires adjusting the color and resizing things to make a good match. Experience is the best teacher there because no two image composites are the same.|`|lKVQ6OXYaa	if u are using photoshop...there are various tools to make a selection of the image that u want to add or remove....you need to kkep trying till  u get it as close as u want...cut out the background...do it very precisely for a more realistic look....use tools such as magic wand, lasso tool etc...i'm sure there are some tutorials on the net...look it up..|`|DVAsYLKaaa	I use adobe photoshop, this is the basic you have to do, first duplicate the image, deleter the original layer, delete the background by using the eraser tool, open a background file... for more tutorial, search for the tutorial in google or yahoo.|`|ZVfLgXIBaa	It definately takes alot of time and patients to do this if you are just starting.

Also, if you want fast internet then you have to buy fast internet! RAM will help you run multiple applications at the same time.|`|DIkfJ4DRaa	yeah it;s sounds good|`|A1q8vA9Daa	Looks good for the price.

42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	A BASIC laptop is essentially a portable word processor on steroids, and is good at only at being portable.    That being said...fast internet depends on two things. First, your connection you pay for through your ISP. High Speed ain't cheap (I'm paying over $500 a year for High Speed, a friend of mine is paying about $100 a month...but then he also has four computers demanding high speed data downloads.)! Secondly, you want your NIC card to be 10/100/1000 so that it can accept the high speed and make effective use of it.    As for Video...you'll need a decent  GPU for that - try to find an ATi HD class (3xxx preferably) chipset. Since the lappies on the market right now tend to have Vista, you want full advantage of Dx10.1, which the nVidia chipsets can't do yet.    As for playing your DVDs and CDs, unless you buy the damn stupid Macbook Air, there is almost definately going to be a ROM drive.    The mini-lappies are decent at what they do, and from the one's I've seen or read about, they all have ROM drives, but they tend to have inferior chipsets for graphics, and the CPUs are low-end.    Finally...try to find a laptop with a dual core and a minimum speed of 1.6Ghz (preferably a 2.0 or higher, but that does cost more).    Good Luck!    PS: No links or other suggestions...except stay away from Dell...as I'm about 2000kms N/E of where you're headed.|`|AA11155170	New! Toshiba - Satellite Laptop with AMD Turion?

They came from the same source of hardware. What differs is the software. If you intend to use your laptop for gaming, video stuff, and browsing, go for a higher RAM (random access memory) laptop. 4GB or even 8GB RAM DDR2 or DD3 are excellent. If you get a 1GB DDR2 RAM from the store, you can upgrade it up to 4 or 6 GB. On the other hand, I heard a lot of good things about Toshiba. Its durability stands out among other global brand.|`|wTVRdgPWaa	Well, look for at least 1.5-2ghz of CPU. Maybe 1-2MB of ram. The internet is separate and unless you;re gonna use Wifi, it won't involve your laptop. Make sure you get a laptop that has DVD capabilities. If it has that it will likely have CD capabilities. Nice video quality needs more cpu and ram to run smoothly, so use the suggested amount or more that I mentioned above. If you're lookng for an ultra-portable, look into an Asus Eee (In sources). They have small screens but they seem really nice.|`|eoqTXCGxaa	Go on the Dell website, they have pretty alright laptops and their service is excellent. Also HP, they're not too bad.

uBkvqcY6aa	Before anyone can answer this question you need to post more information.  What kind of computer and CPU do you have?  How much memory?  What processes are running?    My rule of thumb is that if your machine was running fine and out of the blue slowed down it could be a virus/malware.  Run a check for that.  If your PC was always slow, it could need more RAM.      If this is a windows PC, occasionally they require that you do a fresh install of windows.

Water is fine for spot washing, like if there is a smudge of something you need to get off, but you should finish the job with something like Windex.    What kind of towel you use is more important than the liquid. Paper towels can scratch the screen if they are cheap, some cloth can too. I would recommend using what you might use on a pair of glasses. 100% cotton works good.    I have bought some screen wipes and they work great. They are moist already and do not scratch the screen. They are also not very expensive, so it's a cheap way to keep your teck in good shape. How much did your TV or Monitor cost? Is it worth risking scratches to save a few bucks? Not to me.

There are different kinds of cables, such as the cable connecting the floppy drives, another cable connecting the hard drives, etc.    There are SCSI cables, ATA cables, serial ATA cables (SATA), IDE cables, etc.  But no matter how many pins at the end, no matter what they are used for, the only term I have ever heard or used has simply been "cable".

1bRRODd2aa	Complain (a lot) to your supplier.    Suggest that they either stop adding new customers or that they increase their bandwidth, so that existing customers don't loose service...|`|83vhCGW1aa	There are several possibilites.  Easiest is to complain to your ISP, and they sometimes get you a little more bandwidth depending on your connection type.  Another possibility is to stop any background processes that might be using your internet connection.  These can include automatic updates, antiviral software, firewalls, etc. as well as spyware that may have gotten on your computer and need removed.  Another possibility is to uprade your internet connection.  Usually, from slow to fast, connection types are dialup, dsl, WiFi, Cable, WiMax.  WiFi and WiMax have the advantage of being wireless, and Wimax has a longer range.  Clear http://www.clear.com/?utm_source=bc is the only company I know of that sells WiMax access, and at the moment they only have access in Portland, Oregon, but they are planning to expand to other metro areas.

oAV8fHrwaa	A blog (a contraction of the term "Web log") is a Web site, usually maintained by an individual with regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or other material such as graphics or video. Entries are commonly displayed in reverse-chronological order. "Blog" can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog.    Many blogs provide commentary or news on a particular subject; others function as more personal online diaries. A typical blog combines text, images, and links to other blogs, Web pages, and other media related to its topic. The ability for readers to leave comments in an interactive format is an important part of many blogs. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (artlog), photographs (photoblog), sketches (sketchblog), videos (vlog), music (MP3 blog), audio (podcasting), which are part of a wider network of social media. Micro-blogging is another type of blogging, one which consists of blogs with very short posts.

When your computer first begins to boot and before windows starts to load, press the F8 key until a screen comes up where you can scroll up to select to boot into safe mode, then when the sign on screen displays, sign on as the administrator. by default there is no password for the administrator, so leave the password blank and just press enter. Once you are in go to the control panel and to the user accounts and delete each users password so that you can get in to your regular account.

Check it by    1) Right click My Computer and select Manage  2) Click Device Manager on left Panel  3) On the right Panel go to Sound,Video and Game Controllers       and expand it   4) If there is any question mark, put Mother Board CD(Driver CD)  5) Install Audio driver from it  6) It will work after installing      If there is no question mark in Sound,Video and Game Controllers then check audio cable connected properly.    Otherwise i am sure it must be problem with your Speaker !!!
RivHfOMSaa	I see a lot of software to hack and crack down..unfortunately they need about 10 years until we successfully know the password in case they put 6 digit..So more digit more years need.    I just read wiki about winRAR is amazing when know that the creator himself state there he say no way..    Encryption algorithm is changed to AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with 128 bit key length|`|VkQ8GRvFaa	No, it is not possible to disable the existing password. One thing you can do is that first extract the files and folders from winrar then again make it a rar achieve.
RTvgUnbtaa	Well, first off it you might need a passphaze to axcess the netowrk. Secondly, Usually you need to transfer the network settings over to a different computer, via junk drive. Also, since you have Vista, go to the netowrk and left click, and then click on diagnose. Try the options they give you. That should solve it or tell you whats wrong so you can solve it.    If NON of that works then call you ISP and they'll guide you through various possible solutions.|`|M3maZgdyaa	I had to call my provider to get a code for setting up my lan When I went fron desk top to laptop I had to get a wireless router if you have a modem you might want to check into this|`|AA11340085	check the icon in system tray where you will find wireless network connection click this icon a window will open fill the required data then internet will start working.

PjwWWMu4aa	Okay, first off, gaining access to another person's computer is a criminal offense, as is sending it malware. At least, it is here - it might be different in India, but I doubt it.    So I don't think anyone is going to tell you exactly how to do it (and its not easy - the best one can offer is "study. Lots"). What you really want is to not get bullied, not take revenge for being bullied. A lot of advice I got in similar circumstances was "just walk away", but that's a crazy idea because then you can't see them. Instead, take up a defensive martial art like aikido. Then proceed to ignore said bullies as the small, scared idiots.|`|RTvgUnbtaa	Stuped...just don't worry about them. If you get caught you can go to jail/fined.|`|dOMzkQIraa	Soo...

7fvzJIqvaa	SYMPTOM: Connection to net seems to be down. Openwindows seems frozen, but mouse still moves.   Check the transceiver. The cable may be loose or the transceiver is not fully connected to the back of the machine. If you only have a twisted-pair (phone-like) cable going into the back of your computer, make sure both ends are secured.    If the transceiver has a collision LED, and it is binking or solid, pull it out and re-insert it.    The Domain Name Service (DNS) server may be down. Check to see if the DNS server is alive:    ping 128.151.144.13 (alfalfa.pas)   ping 128.151.224.6 (galileo.cc)     If they both do not respond, there is a connection problem somewhere.    If only the first does not respond, then alfalfa is probably down.    If only the second does not respond, then there might be a problem with the building's connection to the campus backbone.    Under Solaris, as long as galileo.cc is working, you will be able to resolve names into IP addresses.    Try pinging off-campus sites. My favorites:    ping prep.ai.mit.edu   ping cis.rit.edu   ping stanford.edu     If any of these fail, you can probably bet there is a problem with the net between here and there.    Check the console window for errors. A SunOS 4.x machine will hang if it can't get in touch with a host from which it is mounting disks.     If nothing seems to work, you'll have to reboot.     SYMPTOM: Openwindows is frozen and mouse doesn't respond. Hitting keys does not disable screenblank.   This one is usually pretty bad. Try logging in from another machine and looking around for a culprit. Killing screenblank may work since there may be an incompatibility between the old SunOS 4.x source running under SunOS 5.x.     One possibility is that the machine is waiting for another machine to respond. Usually this means that the computer requires access to a disk which is not responding for one reason or another. Sometimes patience is good...     If nothing seems to work, you'll have to reboot.|`|dILqe7nBaa	run error check  http://www.microsoft.com/atwork/getstart...|`|0L0jS8zRaa	I think you got the virus,try and get the system cleaner run it and see what will happen.|`|jOljnsulaa	Could be any number of reasons and it could be software or hardware related.    Software, it could be the operating system (Windows) or a program that's trying to run.    Hardware, could be the hard drive, memory or graphics card.    It could also be that it's just getting to hot.  That causes crashes and freezes too!    Sorry it's not much help but just saying the computer stops responding without more information (like what you're trying to do) isn't going to get any more concrete answers.
DOVonQ31aa	I agree with the last post.    Microsoft has a new Service Pack update which is the 3rd major roll out (SP3). This is the last of the big roll outs for Windows XP, as Windows Vista and soon Windows 7 Operating Systems advance from XP.    However, when XP was released to manufacturing (RTM) and developers made software for it, it may work well without any updates, however when updating your system to SP1, SP2 or SP3 this may cause some software platforms to not successfuly install or load correctly. A usual fix is by downloading a fix or update for the software to allow it to work on SP1, SP2 or SP3.|`|ULw1777caa	What doesn't?|`|3DXXk2ukaa	mhmm|`|VkQ8GRvFaa	What is "it" here?|`|BBnnSwK9aa	Two questions:    1.

The best security you can get is a combination of security programs.     I use Comodo Internet Security. Why? Because it doesn't focus on anti-virus, which is an outdated method, but HIPS (in other words, it alerts you to suspicious actions). CIS is a bit more for advanced PC users, but soon it will also have support for "average" users (currently in beta now).    Also, another layer of security is to get the free versions of MalwareBytes's Anti-malware and SUPERAnti-Spyware. Scan with those about once-a-week.      Another one is GeSWall, which protects you by isolating unknown apps, and protecting trusted apps from modification.

But the majority of the material you shouldn't have a problem with. I would keep preparing as you were and I don't think you should have a problem passing.

nPFgW5XRaa	There is no way to 'combine' the drives as you put it. You'll struggle to recoup much space though as 30GB is really, very very very small by computer standards today. The average size of a HD these days is around 80 - 120GB.    As a result of this (and the advent of broadband) a lot of downloads are now much bigger in size, and a lot of programs you buy or download have the same issue.    Cookies are only ever 1-3kb in size, so you won't recover hardly any space from them. Your best bet is to invest in a new hard drive. If you don't want/aren't comfortable with installing an internal hard drive, you can buy an external hard drive which you simply plug into your USB port, and use immediately.|`|XhKItmv5aa	1st off, u must have a 10 year old computer.,.. 30 gig...lol  try defragging your computer and erasing all ur cookies and unused files. if you have 2 you can set them up in either a master/slave or RAID 0,1 configuration (If you don't know what raid is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundant_a...

4a3e0ab4ecb4787c195a06580c2aa131aa	Somewhere in your router set up web pages there should be a security settings page. Most routers offer three types of protection. Any one of which will stop casual theft of your bandwidth.    MAC Filtering. To use this you need the MAC hardware address of your computers. In Windows type ipconfig /all into a command prompt and you should see it. If you're using Linux in terminal type ifconfig. For Macs, look under Network in the System Preferences. If you use this option then remember when you get a new computer to add it's MAC address to the list.    The other two options are WEP and WPA password protection. There are tools to crack WEP very quickly but will keep the casual thief out. WPA is much more secure.|`|MvnfQ5B0aa	There is a password for logging into the wireless network, which is encrypted with WEP, WPA, or WPA2, as others have mentioned. When deciding on a wireless password, use a "strong" password.     You should also change your password frequently if you think you have some WIFI thieves around. You could even turn off the WIFI broadcast for a few days and just use a wired connection to frustrate the local parasites.    Note that there is the other password used to access the administration page for your router; make sure you change it to something other than the default. Again, use a good strong password.

Make sure you actually saved it as a jpg, and make sure the link is pointing to the actual file (check for typos).  If you can navigate to it directly (point your browser at http://mysite.com/images/myimage.jpg) it will show on the page.|`|9c6ebc182576660d8156612bb4465a10aa	My suggestion would be to check the HTML file and see if the name that the document is looking for is the same name that the file you altered in Photoshop has AFTER you have saved it with the changes.    Files on the web are case sensitive (meaning caps matter) and the extension matters (is it a .jpg or .jpeg file?).    If the file was saved with the extension PSD (photoshop format), the web doesn't support this file type, and therefore you will need to save it as a jpg for it to work.

7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Fields exist in databases, in Excel they're cells.    If you want to test a field for having nothing in it, you need 2 tests - a field that's never had anything in it is null, a field that has something in it, but that something is blank, is vbNullString.    If ("" & field = vbNullString) Then  otherfield = "Owner"  End If    If field is null and you test it for vbNullString you'll throw an error, so you add a null string to it first.  A null string concatenated with (added to) a null field is a null string.  the only other way to do it is two separate tests - one using IsNull(field), the other testing for vbNullString.|`|m9pXE9Puaa	This is a real pain to do    The best and easiest way is to type something in the cell and make the colour white (or the background colour of the cell)    So, then the if statement would be    =if(CELLX=0, "Owner", " ")    So in CELLX you would have 0 (or any character) and just change the colour. This is such an easy way to do it    I'm not sure what the code would be for VB but this will work for Excel

Sometimes it is because of the USB cord, try different cord and see if it works.     If it is not the USB you might be looking at a broken hard drive. Your files is retrievable if your hard drive is still in working order. just bring it to a PC repair shop and they might be able to do it for you.      http://whattodo-jiangchen.blogspot.com/|`|uYUGdcfzaa	Have you accidently knocked the rear power switch on the EHD to off? Do the obvious like checking each cable with a known working one, check you power supply fuses etc.. If the disk is OK you can buy a new caddy for it, or use it as a slave drive in your PC. Screwdrivers required.    OK, read your updates.  When you say the drive is 'working' is it a nice, smooth whirring sound? Or a horrendous ping-ping sound? If it is the latter the HD accuator arm is broken and nothing can be done. If it is the former then it is possibly the USB connector mounting on the caddy has come free from the control board.  Best of luck.|`|Bz799U4Xaa	was the external hard anti shock or hit.?  cuz if it wasnt i dont think it is fixable ,  did it get hit ?|`|NbAGauDmaa	You need a special recovery program for reading the extenal drive in order to recover the data.

K1prVAsjaa	In what language? You want pseudo code so you can do it in any language? For the language-specific code, check the API for Set operations, you will want to know how to create a HashSet, add and delete items, and check to see if an item exists.    You need to understand Set theory basic concepts to do this (see first link below).    Union is the result of combining two or more sets without duplicates.  For the Union (see second link below), create a third Set (set three) and add each item from the first two if they do not already exist in set three (since a union of sets does not contain duplicates). When done, print out the contents of set three for the result of a Union.    Difference (Symmetrical) is the remaining items of two or more sets after removing the identical items (or Intersection) that exist in all the sets.  For the Difference (assuming you are talking about symmetric difference, see the third link below), create a fourth set (set four) and add all the items from set one, then (assuming each set contains only unique items to begin with, which should be true in a HashSet), add the items from set two unless they already exist in set four, in which case you delete the item from set four (and do not add the item from set two). When done, print out the contents of set four for the result of the Difference.    Intersection is the list of items from two or more sets that exists in all of the sets.  For the Intersection (see the fourth link below), create a fifth set (set five) and add only those items from set one that exist in set two. When done, print out the contents of set five for the result of the Intersection.|`|119ef08c7749b873756963e35de2ab40aa	oh **** i did this in uni last year and i totally forgot :S|`|854662b4b6098e523f95f5d734db611eaa	in Php:    $a1 = array('George','Jim','John','Blake','Kev...  $a2 = array('George','Katie','Kevin','Michelle...  $union = array_unique(array_merge($a1, $a2));  $intersec = array_intersect($a1,$a2);  $diff = array_diff($a1,$a2);  echo ("".print_r($union)."");  echo ("".print_r($intersec)."");  echo ("".print_r($diff)."");  ?>    Output:  Array ( [0] => George [1] => Jim [2] => John [3] => Blake [4] => Kevin [5] => Michael [7] => Katie [9] => Michelle )     Array ( [0] => George [4] => Kevin )     Array ( [1] => Jim [2] => John [3] => Blake [5] => Michael )|`|HzkDjDpyaa	What?|`|yROMJnQXaa	What ddddddddudeeeeeeeee i cant understand you|`|Rk3NoBGxaa	in c++:   include    include   using namespace std;  int main(){  string arr1[3];  string arr2[3];  arr1[0] = "Jim";  arr1[1] = "John";  arr1[2] = "Blake";  arr1[3] = "Michael";  arr2[0] = "George";  arr2[1] = "Katie";  arr2[2] = "Blake";  arr2[3] = "Michael";  for(int i=0; i  if(arr1[i] != arr2[i]){  cout  }  }  return 0;  }

O4q4JTIuaa	Very easy eshayys !  Thers is many way to do it.    High Quality !  Download Audacity and follow the installation instructions. ( Third-Party software way )     --------------------------------------...    No need Third-Party software way is     I can show you how to record anything that comes out of your speakers. In order for this to work, you will need to check and see if your sound card device is able to record audio from your speakers.    Windows XP:       1. Click on Start, go to Control Panel     2. Click Sound and Audio Devices, click on the Audio tab     3. Click on Volume under Sound Recording, and look for a category that says Stereo Mix and make sure its checked and make sure the volume is turned down    Tip: If you dont see Stereo Mix, click on Properties, go to Options and make sure you are in Recording mode. If the box for Stereo Mix is unchecked make sure it is checked.    Using Windows to Record    Windows has a built in sound recorder. You can use it to capture sound but not to edit. It can only record 60 seconds by default - I will show you how to record for longer than 60 seconds.       1. Load up the Windows Recorder program located under Accessories, Entertainment on the Start menu     2. Click on record and let it run for the full 60 seconds     3. When it completes 60 seconds and stops, click on record again - it will record longer, adding on another 60 seconds each time you click     4. Click Save As and name your file whatever you want     5. Go back to the Recorder program and load up your saved file - you will see the length time of the sound a lot longer than 60 seconds     6. Click on Record and it will record over the entire length of the saved file     7. Save it, convert to MP3 or keep the default .wav    --------------------------------------...    Using Third-Party Programs    The best way to record sound from your speakers is using audio editing software. There are many programs out there to use. You dont need an expensive program to record audio, just anything that lets you record and edit the recording the same recording. A few examples are Audacity (free), Adobe Audition and WavePad.    Basic functions of audio recording applications are very similar. Lets look at Audacity for recording and editing audio from YouTube.    Recording:       1. Go and find the video you are trying to record from     2. Load up the Audacity program     3. Make sure Stereo Mix is showing in the drop down box of the program     4. Make sure Stereo Mix is checked in your audio properties     5. Click on record in Audacity     6. Click on Play on the YouTube video (or any file your trying to record from)     7. If it is working, you should see it being recorded inside the program     8. Once the song, video or audio file is done playing, click on stop in Audacity     9. You have just recorded the audio from your speakers!    Editing:       1. You probably have dead space at the beginning of the audio file and at the end     2. You need to use the Zoom feature and zoom into the wave sound at the beginning     3. Make sure you know the exact spot where the audio actually starts     4. Highlight everything before that and click on Cut and it will cut off that dead air that you created when you clicked on record before you clicked on the YouTube video     5. Go to the end of the audio and do the same thing, just cut out any space you have left over     6. Now that you have the audio sound the way you want it, go ahead and save the file as an MP3.    Note for Audacity: by default when you click on export as MP3 a message will pop up saying that it needs LAME MP3 encoder (lame_enc.dll file). Just go to the Audacity website, then to Downloads and download the file. Once completed, use Audacity to find the file and the program should save it.       Now you should be able to record anything that comes from your speakers. Uses for this would be if you needed a sound/song for a ringtone, a song you cant find to download or a certain sound effect you heard and need to have.      --------------------------------------...|`|XOnk1rBcaa	There isn't one. You need some hardware that you can play into, that converts it to mp3. There is sofware that converts .wav to .mp3. But that does it on your computer. You can then put that to i-pod/phone/whatever.  some seem to thing that you can use sound recorder. That only records what you play into your computer, not what come out of the speakers. you need a recorder to pick up from the speakers.|`|Prm1ImPPaa	sound recorder, it's built into all windows machines, OSX also has widgets for that  cnet.com downloads also has alot of good music creating software for pc's and macs alike|`|IMTzTp3oaa	Windows vista sound recorder can.|`|K1rUaOqWaa	this 1 http://www.download.com/Youtube-Music-Re...|`|JsGX1bfRaa	Freecorder records from your sound card and its freeware.

XcqRJ7Qraa	if you cant move something it is likely because the files in question are in use by the operating system or by any open programs...really its pointless to just drag them all over since you cant just start them from the slave if they are originally installed on the master...registry won't work that way with most files.    if you want to move them ALL you would have to do a copy command in DOS most likely, or use another computer and a USB connector|`|AA12284392	You should do it while booted from another drive, maybe a CD or something.|`|cILeS32iaa	As far as I know, you can't really move program files because they have registry and that sort of stuff when you install them.    And sometimes you can't move it because they are in use. Since your master drive is probably where you install your Windows XP operating system I suggest you just copy important files to your slave.    You can install your programs later once you reformat if that is that you want to do.    http://whattodo-jiangchen.blogspot.com/|`|Bz799U4Xaa	example:you cant just move windows files.  or program files.bcuz ifyou want the windows files you need to install windows,or programs files the same you need to install each program,you can just move them also there are hidden files which is mostly the sytem files.if you want to get a back up just movethe files that you really need such as sites that you visit or like personal files.  photos and stuff|`|zOtLK1BTaa	You want to do what is colloquially known as 'ghosting'.  This MUST happen before either drive is accessed as certain files are used by Windows while it is running and cannot be moved.    Ghosting copies all files and folders exactly on to another drive BEFORE either drive is accessed.    An example program that does this is: Norton Ghost.    I don't know which is currently considered to be the best of this type, however.|`|NbAGauDmaa	if you are talking about c:\program files, i think it can't be moved easily.

NJXBOx4Maa	It's very unlikely your IP address would be included in the mail message.      When you create a message on facebook, you are supplying text and a person you want the message sent to.  On one of Facebook's servers (with a different IP than yours), the message is assembled into an internal message and/or email.  All e-mail's include the source IP of the message (in this case it would be the facebook server's IP address, not yours).    Facebook's own logs would have your IP address on them, so its possible someone working at Facebook could determine the IP address the message was sent from; this would probably only happen if there was a criminimal investigation regarding your message .      You weren't planning to send a death threat or anything, right?|`|FEb0qWoVaa	Every single thing you do online is linked to your IP address.

282957fb43771156426c9a69aa8e12f0aa	yes it is easy to set up  and to connect u follow the same process as u do with a USB modem.  the interface just differs from modem to modem but there's no real difference.    and some configurations are need to be done. they are specific to internet service providers. So u need to do the configurations which are done in your present modem    and regarding WEP  yes it is secure  but a better, more secure n easier option is to use the MAC filter provided in router  just enter the MAC address/es of the computer/s u want to access the network|`|AA12180741	well what you basically do is install the cd that comes with the dlink since i use a dlink as well but for a cable connection, so u just plug the rj11 telephone cable into the router rather than the usb modem, you also need to make sure you have a network card in the pc, since the router doesn't have usb connections for the pc   also i would advise using the max wireless security on the router which would be either WPA/WPA2, since WEP these days isnt very secure.

HOq5Urn1aa	You can type, but you like to learn to touch type. ( without looking at the keyboard).   This is the way I taught myself. Perhaps it can help you too    You can learn to touch type by following a course, but it is not really necessary.    You can easily teach your self, when you know the basics.    on your keyboard you have the letters  a s d f G H j k l ; ' \  This is the most important line of letters.  You place your fingers on the letters. leaving the g and h free and your thumps on the Space.  That is the starting position  From that position you are going to touch all the other letters and figures  left pinky - a q  ring finger - s w  middle finger - d e  pointing finger - f r g t v b    right pinky - : p "  right ring finger - l o  right middle finger - k i  right pointing finger - j u h i y n    practice this for a while. concentrating is very important  When you think to know where the letters are, take a piece op paper and cover your hands.  Now try to type without looking at the keyboard.  Of course this goes wrong for a while, but when you really concentrate very well, you should get the hang of it.

8nxlw1Hsaa	8600GT is a known good video card for gaming, though 8800GT will do you a lot better. 9600GT is simply an updated version of the 8600GT, and that too would be great for upcoming games also. I've been running on an nVidia 8400GS and I'm still able to play today's games.|`|cILeS32iaa	Have to agree with the above poster.    Unless you want to make sure your card stays a bit longer maybe a higher level card is needed.    So far the cards you listed are pretty solid, just don't expect it to max out graphic settings. You might be able to in older games.    Your PC's other components will play a big role as well.       http://whattodo-jiangchen.blogspot.com/|`|c696e17a151a058e36aceeab75aea544aa	ok.......first of all you need to know that Nvidia's product naming is very confusing, so forget the idea that a higher number is always a better card.  They are set up with the first number being the series, 9000, 8000 7000... .   The second number represents the cards placment in that series. So what i'm getting at is a 8800gt is a much much faster card than a 9400 or even the 9600. (please god don't buy a 9400, i dont care if it has 2 gigs of ram)      You need to spend some time reading videocard reviews at www.newegg.com. Stay away from anything less than a 9600gt as it is the minimum you'll need to play the type of games you listed. As far as what is the best Nvidia card??......well the gtx 280 is close to the best but will run you about $400-$500 american.  You simply don't need that. You also don't need to buy a 1gig card either. Ram size is important but not as important as it used to be. 512mb will be enough for you to run all games even crysis at there highest settings at good resolutions. There are many things that go into how well a card will perform. Things like stream processors, ram speed, shader and core clock speed. I'll let you reasearch those on newegg youreself. What i can do is rank the cards that you have listed in order based on average frames per second in the games listed.(max settings of course)    1. 8800gt/9800gt  $110-$150 www.newegg.com  --These are essentially the same cards. the 9000 series made no major improvments except allowing tri sli, which unless you have $800 to spend on graphics cards, you wont be using. The 8800gt is kinda the reference nvidia card. It will run anygame out at max settings and is a great sweetspot for price vs performance.    2.9600gt $90-$120 www.newegg.com  -- These are basicly a crippled 8800/9800gt with less stream processoers and slower clock speeds. 9600's do well in benchmarks and will play any game out but you'll notice slowdowns at higher resolutions (which may not matter unless you have a nice widescreen moniotor)    9400;s and other junk....  -- These are not for gaming and are mostly used for low power picture editing and photoshop type stuff. Just a tiny bit better than onboard video.

h0hSIgC1aa	a PC varies power consumption with the load placed on it - you cannot simply assume it is 100% load, and just because you have a 1000w power supply does not mean the sum of your components are going to consume 1000w (even at max draw).    You could use a psu calculator to find the absolute max of the sum of your components  http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalcul...  but that is not really an average power conumption measure - it assumes 100% theoretical load for all your components, an unlikely scenario in real-world usage.    The best measure of cost would be to place a monitor on it like P3's kill-a-watt    http://www.p3international.com/products/...    it will show you the average power and even the power factor, and you can easily calculate the average cost per hour based on whatever your utility charges you.    A similiar measure has been done recently here, worth a look  http://positech.co.uk/cliffsblog/?p=21    He mentions a 160w idle use, a max of 190w, and 0.3w when in sleep mode for the PC itself (a C2D 2.4ghz w/ 8800gts).  The LCD is 30w, router is 8w, and a printer is 2w.    I found another page with LCD display sleep mode power consumption here  http://www.thesatya.com/blog/2007/02/fla...  which mentions 25W on and 2W in sleep mode.    so the main factor is how much time the PC is powered on, and how long it remains in idle, load or sleep mode.      In his case his idle power is going to be 160 + 30 +  8 + 2 = 200w for all his devices when idle,  230W when he is gaming, and (if he does not shut off his printer) 12.3W when pc & lcd is in sleep mode.    To calculate your cost per hour, check your utility bill for the rates in your area. If it's not on your bill then look it up on the utility's website.    The electric company measures how much electricity you use in kilowatt-hours, abbreviated kWh. Your bill might have multiple charges per kWh (e.g., one for the "base rate", another for "fuel") and you have to add them all up to get the total cost per kWh.    Let's say you have a rate of $0.10 (10 cents) per kWh.  1kWh is 1000W per hour.    Using the above  's and the idle time, 200W for one hour, it will cost $0.02 or 2 cents/hour, and 2.3 cents/hour when gaming.  Idle time drops to 0.12 cents/hour!      cheers|`|3LHsCLVFaa	Find out that wattage capacity of the PC power supply. Also the same for the monitor. Add the 2 together.  Example 500 watts for power supply  500 watts for monitor  1000 watts is a kilowatt  Look on utility bill for cost per kilowatt  Bingo that is the max (peak) cost|`|CsIvy5MAaa	1) We need to know the specs of your computer, every computer would be different.  2) We would need to know how much your power company charges per wattage usage.      I did my own little test, where 1 month I turned on the computer only when I needed it, and the next I left it on 24/7. The second month, there was maybe a 7 dollar difference.

VMVW3E7Aaa	Mavis Beacon is a well known program.    You are right, you're much better off with a program.  Most people who "learn" how to type by practice only (without any guidance), pick up incorrect habits which then slow them down.

LgmqAFkraa	MySQL, the most popular Open Source SQL database, is developed, distributed, and supported by MySQL AB. MySQL AB is a commercial company, founded by the MySQL developers, that builds its business providing services around the MySQL database. Section 1.3, What Is MySQL AB? .     The MySQL web site (http://www.mysql.com/) provides the latest information about MySQL software and MySQL AB.     MySQL is a database management system.  A database is a structured collection of data. It may be anything from a simple shopping list to a picture gallery or the vast amounts of information in a corporate network. To add, access, and process data stored in a computer database, you need a database management system such as MySQL Server. Since computers are very good at handling large amounts of data, database management systems play a central role in computing, as stand-alone utilities or as parts of other applications.       look out in this site .u vl find all the details.    www.indiasoftwaredeveloper.com/mysql4/...   best of luck|`|r168i5UQaa	ask to PHP ;-)  mysql is an open source database  what is database??    just go to Google and type   database    Enjoy!|`|4d3Ie5lCaa	mysql is a database from which you can pull out data with php for example and make a page with this data.    this website is developed using mysql and php, if you change the number 10 to 9 and go to that page you will see that the content changes yet you are still in the same page.    http://webhole.net/scripts/view.php?pid=...    in other words, you make a template that you want to use for all your articles and "fill" that template with data from mysql rather than making a page for every article.|`|VSgMVgJWaa	mysql stands for my structured query language.    it is a language for communication with the database.    to insert a value into a data base the mysql "query" would look like this.

Your adviser wants to see that you have incorporated what you have learned into your project.      One thought for the complexity: Is your order page going to accept credit cards?  How are you going to handle it?      Other pages that might be useful:  A page describing costs  An 'about us' page  A page about privacy policy (since you have a form asking for information)  A page about customer satisfaction    Of course, these may not be the level of challenges the adviser wants to see.  You are supposed to be bringing wisdom from the knowledge you have gained out in this project.  That's a difficult thing to get help for.

The last time I checked it was a free program to download, but now I think they limit the amount of errors it will correct.    After this has been taken care of, re-install Firefox, but do not install any add-ons or customizations yet: take it bareboned.    Then run it for a day or so and see how it performs. Chances are it could be an add-on that is not compatible. Most often, though, it's a computer issue.|`|66a2033899b05175e184558f79110fe4aa	reinstall - having removed any add ons

As long as you have a basic idea of how to program it shouldn't be hard.  C++ is pretty simple, but if you never did it before I suggest trying to learn with Assembler language or BASIC before trying C++, just to get the theory of programming down.  HTML is also very easy.|`|kTaX5eh7aa	You are never to old to learn a new language or learn your first language.

That's in their privacy statement, but good lord, who can ya' trust these days?  For absolute security you have to utilize mail encryption; somewhat of a hassle, but the whole internet's becoming void of common sense & privacy.

From their Priv. Statement:  http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html  "What information does Google use to serve ads on Gmail?  Google scans the text of Gmail messages in order to filter spam and detect viruses. The Gmail filtering system also scans for keywords in users emails which are then used to match and serve ads. When a user opens an email message, computers scan the text and then instantaneously display relevant information that is matched to the text of the message. Once the message is closed, ads are no longer displayed. The whole process is automated and involves no humans matching ads to Gmail content"    There now; doesn't that make you feel better....?

More and more products are developed as GPL, free licences and so on. ANY computer that is not under the control of Microsoft IS better.  The server market is growing towards Unix/Linux supremacy (70%+), the rest is on window servers (MS).  Languages that run on Unix (php, mysql) are free, and also run on windows, and are FREE.  .net, ASP.net, ASP, JSP, IIS etc are MS products, and for which you have to pay licences (every year, every new version, every update).  Why would someone choose a window server is beyond me!  This article explains a good bit:  " ASP versus Php  PHP, [www.php.net], while loosely based on C and Perl, has never faced the overwhelming complications ASP has. PHP is an object oriented language - though scripts need not necessarily be developed that way (there are still a vast number of developers preferring procedural programming, and PHP caters to both schools). PHP is both cross platform and open source, available for every major operating system and works with most web servers. It is easily extendable by anyone capable of coding in C, and comes pre-bundled with more functionality than ASP could ever offer. Simple capabilities, such as FTP, data compression, file uploads, XML, MD5, encryption and email are not included in ASP and require expensive, third-party packages to be installed. All of this functionality and more are built right into PHP. Complex functions such as dynamic images, IMAP, SNMP, dynamic flash, PDF, native access (non ODBC) to Oracle, Ovrimos, Postgre, Sybase, mySql, MSSQL, Ingres, Interbase and Informix databases, LDAP, and sockets, just to name a few, are available for free to any installation of PHP, but are not (and probably never will be) available with ASP. In addition, one could make the point that PHP is a more mature language than ASP. ASP has only been around since 1996; PHP has been around since 1994, and has a huge base of developers working on it every waking minute of every day; bugs are usually fixed within minutes of being reported and new features are being integrated daily.    1) ASP is significantly slower than PHP, for obvious reasons. Primarily, PHP runs on notoriously fast Unix and Linux servers which have for years outpaced Windows running on comparable hardware. ASP does not run on any operating system other than Windows, and even then, only in IIS and PWS. I could discuss countless reasons why IIS makes a terrible web server, but that would be a discussion all on it's own. PHP runs on almost any web server, on     almost any platform. I have even built a web server in PHP which was capable of executing PHP scripts.  2) ASP natively supports only Access and MSSQL, whereas PHP natively supports a huge number of databases. They both support ODBC equally well. MySQL is a database that PHP closely integrates with; it is a very powerful database that rivals Oracle in speed. Like PHP, MySQL is free, and blows most other databases out of the water. Another hidden cost with ASP is the database angle; Microsoft expects you to develop using Access and when your webpage outgrows it, to switch to MSSQL, an extremely expensive option.    3) While even the best software has glitches, PHP has notoriously few. The PHP development team has an outstanding reputation for fixing bugs, and in order to streamline the process they even have an online system through which new bug reports can be submitted. Most bugs are resolved within 24 hours, and I'm speaking from experience here. There are a huge number of outstanding bugs in ASP which will probably never be fixed. Unless you're a major corporation, chances are that your bug report to Microsoft will likely go unanswered.    4) And finally, cost. PHP is free. ASP isn't free. If you want to use ASP, you have to use IIS, and if you want to use IIS, you have to buy Windows. Traditionally, the cost of Windows has been high. Microsoft has been aggressively trying to reduce this factor but they're hardly going to give Windows away for free. The cost of running an ASP-based website implies a full Windows server platform; development costs are higher, software licenses are expensive and speed, security and flexibility are all sacrificed.    There's a reason that Unix and Linux are dominant in the server market; money, security and performance all speak volumes.  "  by Neeraj Yadav

You can see some level of programming in the DBA but it won't be as overwhelming as an asp.net application programmer.    Other users posted suggestions for other languages(php) but again there is no point if you are not good at development.    keep in mind: everyone has their own preferences - I prefer asp.net over php and I make a living from my asp.net skills.  But, I don't wnat to bog you down with thoughts of programming.    If you are not good/comfortable, then you will be miserable if you go down the asp.net path.      Again, follow the DBA role.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Not SQL server, SQL - the language itself.  AND ASP.net, AND php AND Javascript.    Once you learn programming, the next step is to get comfortable with as many applicable languages as you can.  You don't get the choice, in the real wold, of whether to use .net or php - that's determined by the type of server the site will run on.    (But I suspect that you've never learned programming [not a programming language - programming itself], so now's the time to take a course in programming.  If it's taught in anything other than natural language [English, or whatever your native language is], it's a programming language course, not a programming course.  If the teacher isn't intimately familiar with Wirth's "Algorithms", find a different school.)|`|4makqcowaa	SQL.  .Net is propietary from Microsoft so don;t expect to get a job in a linux based company.

zc3BoaWgaa	First can you at all read the blue screen to determine what error message you are getting??  This would be key to further problem resolution...  Which specific registry file is getting the error?    Sounds like you also have auto reboot set on this system as it reboots as soon as you get the error message.    There are numerous articles published on Google on how to disable this reboot so that you can see the error message.    Your personal folders such as (pictures, documents etc) should be okay as long as you do not reformat the hard-drive and as long as this error is not a hard-drive hardware error.    Worst case you would need to remove the hard-drive and either put in an external usb kit and attach to a second computer or attach as a second drive to a different computer.  This is a safety precaution to ensure that your critical files are safe.    Next depending on the registry file error do a Google search to determine the appropriate recovery option.    Most likely you will have to reboot from the install disks and get into the recovery console to either run chkdsk or copy backup registry files into their proper location.    Then after reboot do a system restore to get the computer back to a current state.    There is much good documentation out on the web on this but all steps must be done in order and very carefully.    Post back if more assistance is required.      **************************************... info on stopping the auto reboot/restart    On some PC's that I've recently installed and/or worked on, in the boot options (press f8 before the windows logo and after it boots from the HDD), there is an option at the bottom of the list to disable the automatic reboot.    I don't know if it's a patch or a service pack edition as I've only had cause to take notice of it once, but I can tell you that it's on some, but not on others. Take a look, and select it if it's there   ************************end of autoboot doc***********************************|`|AA10265922	to slove your problem plus more problems you do not even know about take it back to factory level,you will need the disc that came with it,put the disc in,reboot to the disc and follow thru with the install|`|4makqcowaa	Last good known configuration on boot menu?

These files govern many of the functions of the internal parts and the operating system itself. In order to fix the files you will have to resore the computer to factory. Most computers come with one of two methods:    1) CDs packaged with the computer labeled "Recovery Disc" or something similar are to be inserted and the computer restarted. A preprogrammed program will erase everything on the hard drive and reinstall the OEM software    2) Some computers bypass the CD and have the information needed on a partition on the hard drive. If there is no label during startup shows "hit F12 for recovery" or something similar, then you should contact the manufacturer and ask about system recovery. (ex. Dell told me to hit F10 during startup.)|`|gYFtQyyQaa	You can restore the computer completely or you might have to get someone to fix it for you if the recovery system does not work.|`|m2mny87jaa	"registry failure" is a serious problem with your registry.    you would have to do a clean install of windows to fix it.|`|LCULOqOsaa	Format the Drive and Install the OS again..|`|JRJf3x4Caa	You have few options.  1. reformat the disk and reinstall the OS. you lose everything.  2.

It will wipe the disk clean and reinstall everything. Unless the restore CD has some options.    Better get help if you are not sure.

14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	Mail follows a certain 'protocol' and part of it is that when you get your mail from the server, it sends a 'message' back to the sender saying "mail delivered to a valid address" so the spammers know it & keep sending junk, plus spread your address to other spammers.    Merely 'deleting' from your mail viewing application will not stop this cycle, and 'block sender' fails because it's only blocks that specific sender...& once they discover your address, all they have to do is change a single character of the senders name, and they start getting their junk through again (depending on your filtering settings).        You want to end that notification, from the Server (your ISP) level.  Get a program that will 'preview' all mail while on the server,  and 'bounce' the mail back to the spam sender (your selection); in effect saying, 'This address is invalid' and they eventually stop sending junk.

bmwOJ9wMaa	If you want to set up your website real fast, then yes hire a professional.  If you want to do it on your own at leisure, then they provide online support as well as a full instruction manual with there templates.  This is what i got when i visited that website ( i have no experience whatsoever in person because i never bought anything from them in past.)  Whatever you are asking in your question is already stated in the very page you linked.  Also those templates are made using software stated above and yes you need them to make edits if you want only, they are just mentioned hoping that you are familiar with one of these.  Its not a constraint however you can use various free tools and tricks( your choice of editors etc. ) but then again, that will require time and knowledge.  Best thing that you can do is talk to them on support forums or via phone or internet call and then make your decision. No website is secure when it comes to it. Point here is how much you know and how much time you are willing to put into it.  Here a simple description, of what you need to do to setup your template, is given :   http://www.ecommercetemplates.com/suppor...  Also you can try free templates too, they are available all over internet.   Also some very high quality open source ecommerce projects like  Zoomla, oscommerce , zencart etc.   Of course you will need some time, patience and a spirit to do it on your own to work around with these.  Wishing you good luck in all that you do.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	It means "compatible with".  That's like saying that the box of tissues you buy is "compatible with" Chevys and Fords.  ANY web template had better be "compatible with" DW and PS.  (BTW, their mention of Front Page doesn't leave me feeling all warm and fuzzy - the only thing anyone should do with FP is delete it.)    But, unless you understand the legal implications inherent in an eCommerce site (for instance, your database gets hacked, and someone gets your customers' CC information), and how to prevent problems (and what kind of database you have available, how to manage it, etc.) you should hire someone.  Even if you love the particular template and want them to just integrate it into your site.  (It WILL take configuration - is that a page you can access, or do you have to change the code itself?  Do you know whether you need the ASP version or the PHP version?  Do you know which database you're using?)    If you do your own legal representation, your own accounting, your own electrical work, etc., then by all means do your own website development too.  (And please teach me how you learn all those fields well enough to be good at all of them.)  If you wouldn't set your own broken leg, why develop your own website?  You could lose your entire business in a single law suit.    Find eCommerce sites you like.  Look for a developer's link or email (down at the bottom in a small font).  Contact a few developers, to get an idea of what having them integrate a template would cost and what having them design you an eCommerce system would cost.  (You already know you like their work.)  You probably want something you can modify as needed (add products, including pictures, delete products, change prices, etc.) without the need for them to modify code (and charge you for it).    And you want a contract - it protects both sides.

I'd be a little concerned about the reason for the 'lockup' though...  Are you using 'NoScript' for FF, and what other security are you using?  Falling back to IE is not a fabulous alternative, as it's riddled with major malfunctions & security risks.|`|YTIDE8Evaa	Is there a specific website that make your computer crash ?   Does it include flash ? If yes update your flash player. If no there are ways to back-up your bookmarks which you can learn how with a google search.|`|UF1obD42aa	Ease your mind and backup all your bookmarks beforehand.  I swear by Foxmarks since I like to keep my bookmarks in sync between work and home, but if you just want a one-time backup, install the Password Exporter Extension and export your bookmarks somewhere safe on your computer.  Then, reinstall Firefox, install Password Exporter on your fresh version, and use it to re-import all your bookmarks!    Addendum with regard to Dunbar's comments:  Thanks for the vote of confidence.  The lockups are definitely a concern.  After uninstalling your current Firefox, but before installing a fresh version, I recommend running Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware utility, then running CCleaner on both your applications and registry.  Once you've done that and installed your fresh Firefox, consider installing the AdBlock Plus, Web of Trust, and NoScript extensions to keep your surfing safe and secure.    If all else fails and you decide to abandon Firefox, go with any of the following browsers over IE:  Flock (based right off Firefox, with lots of social networking features)  Google Chrome (very new, very slick, and very fast, but not yet extensible)  Opera (I've only dabbled with it myself, but there are lots and lots of people that wouldn't use anything else.  it's got a number of features built-in that are only available in Firefox as extensions)  Safari (fast and clean, but it's a little weird having an Apple browser on Windows)

Mac handles memory better then Windows at the expense of being compatible with almost nothing and costing more then an economy car.    Lets get down to brass tacks here.  99.999999999999999999999999999% of the time when a computer is running slow it is either A. User Error, or B. You don't understand the structure at which your current architecture performs tasks.    Opening multiple files requires memory, if they are very large files then it will require lots of memory so that would slow any computer down even a Mac made of solid gold.    Dual Core does not mean that you can run two instances of Crysis at the same time either, it is true that a dual core processor will switch task affinity based on the work load and such but there is a bottle neck, try running folding@home on just one core with RealTime priority.    Try external/more storage for your files, if your boot hard drive is jam packed with pictures of your aunty Mable's wedding or the Weird Al Collection then chances are your computer is working pretty hard to find everything because it does this mechanically!  Also Windows Vista added a feature that Mac Users love that PC user loath that could be hurting your performance INDEXING.

If you can connect, then either the router and/or your laptop wireless settings are out of sync and they need to be reset (password match).    If you cannot connect directly to the router, ask a neighboor to help out.

I also discovered that this problem is more pronounced if I have too many programs open at one time, or if I download music or online movies.  I think it's because the computer has to "work harder," and the harder it has to work, the more of a burden it places on the fan (keeping the computer cool).  Also, I am almost out of disc space on my hard drive.    I removed files/programs I don't need, and only now keep one program open at a time, and the whirring noise is now more infrequent.  At least this worked for me.

Make sure you select a LAMP server: Linux/unix, Apache, MySQL, Perl/php.  Most hosts offer both LAMP and WAMP (the window server).  Go for a hosting company that is not TOO big!

Vt0xnuWpaa	For now, you can still work on your projects if you have an extra computer monitor lying around. Only your screen is broken, nothing else!     Just plug it into the laptop's VGA port and press "Fn + F3" [List of Gateway Shortcuts here!: http://support.gateway.com/s/Mobile/Gate... ] to switch the video output to your computer monitor. (Like this, except on your laptop! http://canisius.edu/images/userImages/md... )     Then you can work on the monitor rather than your laptop screen for the time being. Kind of like this (but without your laptop screen working of course): http://i43.tinypic.com/b9ac7n.jpg    ---    It depends on the ports you have on your computer and on your TV. Check what kinds you have on your laptop.    The four main types are (in increasing quality):  1. S-Video [2 types: 4Pin as in picture|7Pin]  Port: http://www.coloredhome.com/video/s-video...  Cord: http://akamaipix.crutchfield.com/graphic...  2. VGA  Port: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...  Cord: http://www.thisishowyoudoit.com/blogimag...  3. DVI  Port: http://vocaro.com/trevor/blog/wp-content...  Cord: http://www.tech-faq.com/dvi-hdtv-connect...  4. HDMI - also transfer sound signal  Port: http://media.bestofmicro.com/,2-3-49323-...  Cord: http://www.k1cable.com/images/hdmi_000.j...    All of these do the same thing: The laptop sends the video information through the Port and the Cord. Your TV Recieves that information in its port. Numbers 1 to 3 do not transfer sound, so you will need a separate adapter for your headphone to TV Audio.  4 HDMI transfers both sound and audio data, so you won't need a separate cable for sound.    Check if your TV has corresponding ports. If not, you can buy adapters. This is an example of a VGA to RCA(Red/White/Yellow analog cables) and S-Video   http://img.alibaba.com/photo/52306528/VG...    Try to stay away from S-video. The quality is really bad; you won't be able to read any text on the screen.    Just do the Fn+F3 again to switch to the monitor.|`|gYFtQyyQaa	I don't think that you can buy an extension. You should probably return it so that they can get you a new one if you have warranty, or first call gateway to see if they an fix it.

Pull this pin off and set it to one notch over. .... (there are 3 pins and the jumper only uses two)    Keep it like this for about 30 seconds to a minute. Then switch it back to how it was when you found it.     Now the password will be cleared, but so will the other motherboard settings.

E.g. windows 98 and windows xp for example. In terms of backing up your files, if you purchased the photoshop cd, it must have come with a cd key. Any software that you buy can be reinstalled at any time, as long as you have the cd key that came with it.     Now, if you want to back up photoshop projects, that's a different story. All you have to do is go to the directory where you saved your files and put them on a flash drive (those little usb hard drives), an external hard drive, or a cd/dvd. For example, "C:\Documents and Settings\Username\My Documents."

If the games aren't already set to un on the lowest possible settings, try that.  Thats the only free solution.|`|SgLkiydlaa	There aren't really any 'free' suggestions, you need a faster computer, not enough ram, plain and simple.

Only ever by a Geforce video card, there's a huge difference.  I'd suggest the 8000 series if you don't have a bunch of money or maybe one the newest one if you have some money to blow.  Try to get at least 1gb of RAM for your video card.    The other really important thing is RAM, get at least 4gb.  Though if you get anythign beyond that you'll need XP 64-bit or Vista 64-bit to use any of it above the 4gb.|`|EwRt81d5aa	Motherboard, go for a Gygabyte!

Sp64IkiFaa	I just recently bought some of their stuff and i am very happy with my result i got the razer tarantula keyboard but i would much rather have the lycosa keyboard so try to find that one and the new WIRELESS mamba mouse came out and if you are a gamer like me this is a must have the specs are tremendous here are a few things       *  Gaming Grade Wireless Technology      * Dual Mode Wired/Wireless Functionality      * Razer Synapse? On-board Memory      * Seven independently programmable Hyperesponse? buttons      * 5600DPI Razer Precision?  3.5G Laser sensor      * 1000Hz Ultrapolling? / 1ms response rate      * Up to 200 inches per second*/ 50g acceleration      * Approximate size:  128mm x 70mm x 42.5mm      * Battery Life: 14hrs (continuous gaming); 72 hours (normal gaming usage)        *Depends on surface used    and then you can find the headset Barracuda HP online on ebay or amazon pretty cheap like $50.    About your overpriced thing i mean if you are a gamer and have all regular things like a factory keyboard and mouse then you will notice a HUGE difference when you play with gaming accessories. The mamba is $120 but i mean its worth it to be playing with a wireless mouse meant for gaming. Gaming headphones for $50 is pretty damn good price and the keyboard can be a little pricey but i got my tarantula for around $50. It just depends if you want to be a serious gamer or not. But seeing how you have a Quad core for gaming i recommended you buy razer.

U6lQVtF5aa	Depends on what you mean by burning DVD's.  If you just want to burn files onto it (like you would on a cd) then  all you need is a basic burning programs, it sounds like Data Disc might be that (haven't heard of it).  But something like the Nero software sweet (though there are free open source burning softwares on the internet also if you google for them).    To burn a DVD to play in a DVD player is much more complicated.  You need a program that can format your videos and encrypt them in the proper format.  I suggest Adobe Encore for a really great DVD Authoring software.  But in general the word you'd want to search for is "DVD Authoring" and programs that do that will be able to burn playable DVD's.    Of course, the other problem could be that you bought a DVD player that is not able to burn DVD's.  Check the box to see if it says if it can write, burn, otherwise make DVD's.  If this is the case you just don't have  the right player, you'll have to get one that burns.|`|YTIDE8Evaa	you need to use a Burning software .

Price should depend on quality, functionality and design, if you give the link of the site it's more easy to tell what it should cost !    $ 200 is a nice price ! Don't overcharge and big chance he might bring you more customers !|`|ePkiOzPSaa	This depends entirely on the complexity of the website, as well as your skill in making it.  It also depends on your experience, and how long the whole project will take.  Is it just going to be some flat html with pictures and a menu?  or are you going all out with CSS and scripting for enhanced functionality?    I would say, the biggest factors here would be 1) what is your experience level, and 2) how long will the project take?  These 2 factors tend to vaguely encompass the other factors.  If all you have done is freelance, or if you have never made a site professionally before, I would say you could charge somewhere on the low end of $10-15 an hour for the work you do, if they are definitely going to be happy with it.  If you have job experience, have done a lot freelancing, or maybe even have education in the area, you are more looking at $13-18.  Note, this all also depends completely on your location, so these are completely estimates, and nothing else.    For the full website, guessing from the way you talk about it, I would say you would be charging somewhere in the area of $100-300.  My impression is that this may be your first paid gig.  Anyways, this is something you will learn to better estimate in time, and will have to negotiate.|`|lLt5SZqQaa	try this   www.weebly.com

C2ZrBKJfaa	Myspace is something that will have to wait until you get home from school. You'll get suspended from school and get banned from using school computers when they catch you. There is nothing that is so critical on myspace that can't wait until you get home.|`|FgsRcuDpaa	Let's first establish: Myspace is not a requirement.  There is nothing that important on Myspace that can't wait until school/work is dismissed. If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences; that you really don't want to. It's honestly not worth the repercussions involved.  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than Myspace, and worth your time

Steps are as follows:  1. right click on my network places and click properties.  2. now right click interface and click on properties.  3. Here you will see internet protocol (TCP IP), double click on it.  4. Note settings of IP Address, Sub-net mask, default gateway, and DNS settings.  Follow same steps on desktop computer and enter settings you have noted into desktop computer with slight change in IP Address as follows:  if laptop IP Address is (xx.xx.xx.02) enter settings (xx.xx.xx.03) in desktop computer. Rest settings like subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS should remain exactly same.    Anyway RPC Service can be enabled as follows:  1. click run> type "services.msc" and press enter  2.

The MAC address is basically the address for your wireless card. I'm pretty sure that when you plug in your wireless card, you will be given the MAC address.

Wireless care model is the model of the wireless care you're using.  This should be on the box it came in, give the company name and the model number.    Your NIC MAC address can be found using this faq http://compnetworking.about.com/od/netwo...|`|IIUqe4m0aa	To find your network card model, go to Control Panel (Start -> Settings -> Control Panel on Windows 98/2000, Start -> Control Panel on XP/Vista).    Once in Control Panel you need to open Device Manager:  Windows 98/2000/XP:  Double click on System, go to the Hardware tab and then press Device Manager.    Windows Vista:  Just find Device Manager in Control Panel.    Device Manager lists all the hardware components in your computer, one of the items in the list is Network Adapters, click the little 'plus' sign next to it to open the sub-list.    This will contain your network card(s) hopefully one will contain the word 'Wireless' in its name.  If not post the listed network adapters and I'll let you know which one is likely to be the wireless NIC.

Try the opt out methods @ bottom; hope it works for ya'.    Yahoo! & Google breach of trust to it's patrons reached a new low.  Both services submissively bowed to advertising conglomerates, by adopting 'phorm' styled targeted advertising.  This may make your browser display advertising which you have no control over, and may in fact do many other un-requested actions with your entire system.    Google itself has spyware.  From their Privacy Center page  (http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html)  "No personally identifiable information  We dont collect or serve ads based on personal information without your permission."  Notice the last 3 words...yet it is specifically an "Opt Out" method!    "Google uses the DoubleClick DART cookie on our Google content network ..."  They also utilize Double Click ad conglomerate for God knows what, and the Firefox "WoT" has a huge warning on their website warning not to go there!    Yahoo! calls their invasion of privacy "Matched advertising", and it stems from the 'Network Advertising Initiative' (NAI), a conglomerate of advertising kingpins.    The basic concept is they track your surf behavior (aka "clickstream") and feed you advertising that they design, and requires "Opt Out" to defray the advertising tsunami from Yahoo's partners in this server based spyware/adware (and to stop them from creating a 'profile' of you).

All hard drives are simply machines and have a finite life...they will fail eventually regardless of the brand.  A Seagate is generally regarded as having the best durability.  If you are willing to spend a little extra cash for something special, like a drive with a fan to keep the disk cool (heat is the  1 killer of hard drive death), you might want to check out a G-Tech or Glyph product.  You'll pay a price premium, but you'll also notice the difference in build quality the first time you pick it up.

Second, the network can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually. The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked.

There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack the employers or schools security system.

First of all you use the word 'fast', if you want a quick anonymous browser you'll have to use a paid service as anonymous proxies are very expensive to run - you can get access to plenty of free services but they will be slow and/or have lots of ads (they have to pay for the service)    If you're on a school or company network, you're probably all ready surfing through a proxy - this will log all your web requests unless you encrypt your connection ( a advert sponsored proxy will not do this).      Read a little about the subject before you try it, there are ways but understand the subject first.    Hope this helps.

AA10900831	Since outlook cannot contact the email server, at the same time internet access is lost, they both are using TCP/IP just the port is different, so network signal is not detected at times. However you said the other pc can send email, so it's not the server problem or the link between the server and other pc, so it probably is your segment of network that had problem.  Also, outlook is not dead all the time, so it can't be software problem, unless it's virus related.  In most case you need to check the network cable that link up the problem pc and the network, it could also be a sign that the network card is failing, so it works only intermittently, try to put another network card in to see how it works. Do a full system scan on the pc for virus just to make sure too.  Hope this helps.

AA11622701	Sounds like you may have one of three things:  a virus, a stuck key on the keyboard, or a major hardware problem.    Begin by trying to boot the computer into Safe Mode.  Turn it on and repeatedly press the F8 key until you get the screen with the Safe Mode option.  When it Safe Mode, it prevents anything but the most essential files needed to run Windows from loading.  Usually this will prevent a virus from being able to load and run.  You can then try to virus scan the computer and hopefully clear the problem.    You can also trying goint to a Restore Point from before the time the problem began.  Under the Accessories section of the Start Menu should be a System Tools with a System Restore option.        If that fails, tray checking for a stuck key, and try a different mouse on the laptop.  Sometimes they can stick and cause all kinds of weird problems.    If all of that fails, you will probably need to have a professional look at the PC.  (Or a favorite Geek who you can bribe with a McDonald's breakfast and a free movie rental.)    Good Luck|`|aMdLmbRwaa	Yeah i does that to me too. When my memory runs out.

V5xHaIAcaa	One of the ugly issues with Windows and the concept of the way the Registry works, all you need to do is miss one .dll and your are toast.    Just one "hook" left in the registry (e.g. trying to delete a program that you already installed) and you will never get the program off your machiine.  Kind of like leaving just one little "bacteria" behind.    I know you do not want to hearr this,  but in my years of experience, the quickest way to fix this problem (and many others) is a complete rebuild from a F-disk on up.  The only exception, in my experience, is if you are lucky enough to have the one command that you need (from freinds, colleauges, web sites, etc.) to fix the problem

You have to import them into your library, give them a link (Remember when I did the "sound01" part? You have to name your sound.)

IGJGUfjNaa	If your virus/spyware free, there are  a couple things you can do get your computer working faster. If you using your computer for normal stuff and not gaming. You don't always need more RAM you just need to perform a few maintenance task.    First, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Do a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.  http://www.delete-computer-history.com/w...    2. Clear your Windows cache files, this is your temporary file. It can grow up to a large volume and stop your computer from using RAM properly. In a sense slow it down by preventing it from using free space.Here is how:    1. Quit Internet Explorer, Firefox, or any other web browser  2. Click Start, click "Control Panel", and then double-click "Internet Options".  3. On the General tab, click "Delete Files" under Temporary Internet Files.  4. In the Delete Files dialog box, click to select the "Delete all offline content" check box , and then click OK.  5. Click OK.    3. Manage your startups. Your excess CPU usage is due to too many programs running in the background. You can cut these to barebones by alter your msconfig. Here is how:    1. Open your Start menu.  2. Click Run  3. In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"  4. In the "system configuration utility",click either "service" or "startup" tab  5. Uncheck all programs that your are no longer using.  6. Click "OK"

The first thing it does when it finds a virus, or some form of malware/worm is to disinfect the file(s).

Here are some other good anti-virus programs, but some people complain that certain ones are 'resource hogs' meaning that that use a lot of your system's memory or processor to run (or while running in the background).  -- McAfee (free trial, then pay)  -- Norton (free trial, then pay)  -- Kaspersky (free trial, then pay)  -- AVG (freeware)  -- Avira (freeware)  -- ZoneAlarm (freeware, upgrade version available)    Just remember if you are downloading software, MAKE SURE you are at the actual website for that anit-virus. There are malware sites that are disguised as the actual anti-virus. If you are NOT SURE, go to a reputable download site to get it, like:  CNet/Downloads.com  ZDNet  Tucows  FileHippo  Yahoo  etc.    --

I had this issue a while back with an LCD monitor i was using. it turned out that the backlight failed. sometimes the inverter fails also. you can usually find these parts cheap on ebay and if your mechanically inclined / experienced its possible to replace these parts for less than it would cost to buy a whole new monitor, but in many cases its just easier to buy a new one.     if its a crt monitor, just replace it. CRT monitors are more dangerous to work on, as the parts conduct higher voltages and the tubes are fragile and contain mercury. plus theyre very cheap anyway to just replace.|`|fNFrQDnaaa	First you need to check your VGA is it working or not, and check your Monitor Power cable may be it is creak or not working properly.

If the drive was formatted a month ago  but never had anything written to it, and has been sitting unused in a closet since then- recovery programs have an excellent chance.      If the system has been used regularly since then and had programs installed and files saved, recovery chances go down the drain because areas of the hard disk containing those old files have now been overwritten with different data.    You might try Pandora Recovery or Final Recovery- those are pretty good but subject to the same restrictions mentioned above.|`|jpJrzP38aa	You can try to recover data from formatted hard drive with Easy File Undelete software:    http://www.munsoft.com/EasyFileUndelete/    It uses unique modern algorithms to recover files that other software either recovers incorrectly or is unable to detect.|`|GuBnmZ8naa	It isn't realistically possible to recover you files.

VMVW3E7Aaa	Elements is the "dumbed down" version of Photoshop, and is MUCH cheaper. It is a very good program, and more than enough for your average user.    For people who are used to PS proper, it might get a little frustrating, because it IS different. It actually has a few rather "cute" functions that PS doesn't have, aimed at doing things automatically where PS makes you work for it.    You say you had PS years ago - so you're not familiar with the current version which is SO much better than it used to be. So in YOUR case, a current version of Elements is probably equivalent (although different in some way) to the old version of PS that you used to know.    My guess is that you'll be able to do most things you want to do, and you will like Elements, mostly because YOU - at this point - don't really know what you're missing out on by not having CS4.

iQQtsGUoaa	You were not ripped off but you could be a little screwed. You can get a PC with Office pre-installed but you need to pay for the license as part of your package deal. If you did not pay for the license the software is probably only a trial version. If it is a trial you can still get use out of the software you bought. If the software on the PC is the full version you can try to return the software you bought, ONLY if you did not open it. But i think you should install what you bought.|`|vydURfiRaa	Probably not. The version you usually get with new computers from most manufacturers is only a trial version and runs out in like 30 days.

I did do the Microsoft update which was for Internet Explorer so I was thinking it might have been something to do with that? Anyway I have been able to fix it and all I did was on the windows messenger window (Which has your picture, contact details etc) I clicked on Tools, then options, then Connection, then advanced settings. This brings up a page which has 3 Test options. All I did was click on those and it tests the connection etc. It should say that the connection is ok etc. I then tried to send a msg (Both to someone online and offline) and they went through fine. Ive no idea why this happenned in the 1st place but my friend had the same problem. She has just done the above and hers works fine again now! So try that if your still having trouble with " The following message could not be delivered to all recipients:".    Hope that fixes it for you.|`|7mOfekBWaa	I'm having the same problem.

If you use a router, then you can do a couple of things..    1) Check to see if your connection is dropping/disconnecting at all. There should be a 'Connection Info' sort of thing in your router's page, and you can check the uptime of your connection there. This probably isn't the problem though.  2) If you know how to open a port on your router (check www.portforward.com for router specific guides), open these and forward them to your PC/laptop's IP:    MSNMessenger (TCP) 1863  MSN Files (TCP/UDP) 6891 - 6900  MSN Voice (TCP/UDP) 6901    ?or if you use vistaa, update it    ??.?**`?.?? ?? ? ?l???.?**`?.??  ::: (\(\   *: (=' :') :*   ?..

Vt0xnuWpaa	The best thing you can do is update your video drivers. There's no much else you can do for most laptops.    Unless you've ordered the laptop with the card you wanted, you can't swap it out. Unlike Desktop graphics cards, which are limited only by available slots, Laptop graphics cards are hard to find, and even harder to replace.    Laptop GPUs are not cards at all, but GPU chips soldered into the motherboard (which is why the ones with dedicated cards are said to have "discrete graphics" and others have the built-in "integrated graphics" rather than having "cards"), so as are some of the CPUs - meaning you have to melt the metal solder to even take them out. This is the way most laptops today are made. You'll have to be a real expert to be able to swap them successfully - even then success isn't 100%. Manufacturers will not take them back for an upgrade. Furthermore, your laptop motherboard chipset will not allow for you to upgrade to a discrete GPU if you ordered it with the integrated card.    Unless you have a laptop with a separate graphics unit or an MXM slot, you won't be able to upgrade/replace it. Check your manual to see if they allow any upgrades. Few laptops today allow you to do so (the Alienware line being one of the very last) I know for sure that recent Dell laptops use the soldering style.    -----------    The only option you have left is to use an Expresscard-adpated graphics unit, but not yet. Maybe in the near future; right now external graphics through Expresscard is in the process of development/release.    There aren't that many for sale yet in the U.S., but if you're lucky, you can find an ASUS XG Station for sale somewhere (but it won't be cheap considering its around $300 for the dock alone). You just need to have an Expresscard slot. They're only offering the 7900GS and 8600GT (desktop card) for the dock so far, but from the looks of the design you might fit other PCI-E x16 graphic cards into it in the future.    At this point, they will only work for an external monitor, and the bandwidth through the ExpressCard port is still pretty slow, so you will not get the full boost of the cards they contain.    http://www.hwupgrade.com/articles/print/...  http://img250.imageshack.us/img250/1671/...|`|dILqe7nBaa	laptops can't be upgraded except ram,hard drive and dvd drive|`|QMv80Ku1aa	You need to check before you buy the game CD it is compatible or not.

They aren't fancy, certainly not representative of what you can do with them, but they are simple and functional.|`|ZW0JHvdraa	Blogspot.com - very user friendly, and very popular.
9zfcXlCDaa	your router is not the problem. it sounds as if either your cousins have many viruses or are running a torrent client like limewire. limewire uses a very large amount of your internet connection and is very insecure. i used to use it and many times i ended up downloading a virus. if your addicted to torrent clients you can use utorrent instead.what is your advertised data rate for your line? then when nobody is using your internet go to http://www.dslreports.com/speedtest and test to see if you are actually getting the speed you pay for  then if it is less call your isp and tell them of your problem (hint don't tell them you're useing limewire) ;)
UTo2Yf3Jaa	I would start with a foundation, the first rung of the ladder per say.  I suggest you get your A+ certification first, which makes you certified professionally to work on computers. Then work your way up from there, any certifications from Microsoft and CISCO are highly desirable.  Networking, network security, database administration are high in demand and pays very well.  Hope this helps.|`|5mqWIRPuaa	Start with CompTIA A+ certification.  It validates the latest skills needed by todays computer support professionals.  It is always a plus on your resume.
QZeM4ZUVaa	Hi,  please do this first :-  download CCleaner, install it and then run it, this will safely delete all your temp files etc for you, then reboot back into safe mode again (press F8 as it boots up) and defrag your hard drive to get all your free space back again, i think your system is full of rubbish and just needs a good cleanup.  CCleaner will also clean your reg files correctly as well, but please remember to reboot between doing a disc cleanup and a reg cleanup.  Defaggler will defrag your drive quickly and cleanly.  this will help you, (i promise).  http://www.ccleaner.com/download  http://www.defraggler.com/download    this is a completely FREE download and will not harm your system at all.|`|skd8PQGSaa	Having your free space at 10 or even 15% is actually pretty risky.  I work for a hard drive company and we always recommend keeping at least 20% of your disk free.  When you get around 10% you are risking a total disk failure the more you use it when it's that full.  I would look at either backing a lot of your music up onto dvd or perhaps getting an external hard drive and moving as much as possible onto there.  How big is your hard drive now? what are you keeping on there that's taking up so much space?|`|dILqe7nBaa	http://www.microsoft.com/AtWork/getstart...
c696e17a151a058e36aceeab75aea544aa	That's not a problem. Laptops have cpu's that slow themselves down when not under heavy load to save battery life. Your computers prob. running slow because you either have too many programs running or you need more ram. Look at the bottom right of the taskbar(by the clock) and if there are ALOT of icons that is why it's slow. Every icon down there is a program running taking resources. Right click on those and tell them to exit or quit or whatever the option is to close it. Only keep the things running that you are using right now or need.    UPDATE::::!!!  ------BE CAREFUL DOWNLOADING A REG CLEANER!!!   usually they are malware themselves, ya might just wanna try to close all the programs that are prob running.   If you must download somthing use adaware, spybot, or avg.   those three are safe but  you prob don't need to do all that|`|6oVhzzafaa	Download system registry cleaner. Run several times and when using it use privacy eraser. Big difference.

vzqKVGnsaa	You explained it in a way that sounds like you are talking about search engine for kids, so I found some, i think. I have also searched for a video site like YouTube but for the kids only, and I found it.     So the sites and search engines for kids are:  http://www.ivyjoy.com/rayne/kidssearch.h...  http://www.askkids.com/  http://www.kidsclick.org/    And the video portal for kids is:  http://www.totlol.com/    +-------------------------------------...|`|g52eSE06aa	There is a yahoo! site for kids. The address is www.kids.yahoo.com I went on it a few times when I was younger it's ok. I saw this other site when looking for clothes called www.u14sclub.tk it seems to be very new and suitable for kids it has games, reviews all that kind of stuff. I think it's only had stuff added on it for like a few days the owners like 10 or 12 or something so it's probably very kid created. Here are some other kids links:  www.factmonster.com  www.kidzworld.com  www.whyville.com  www.clubpenguin.com  Also on the yahoo! directory there is a childrens links page. There seems to be stuff on child abuse, but maybe you should pick out the links for your 7 year old from that site to make sure it's safe. Here's the link:  http://dir.yahoo.com/Society_and_Culture...  Good luck site surfing lol.|`|AMXMZLjZaa	I think the google one for kids is called Sparklebox  But like the first answerer I wouldn't raise them on that  they've got to get the facts of life from somewhere|`|2F5XkiHLaa	Check out Kim Komando's site. She's the leading radio computer show & has a terrific kids section on her website. And she has a 6 or 7 year old, so she is very much in tune with that subject  http://komando.com/kids/parent-tips.aspx  .|`|MJW1ZgPlaa	I don't know of a good search engine for kids (their search algorithms suck) but i can recommend a good solution to block dangerous websites. Your kids should learn to use real search engines, not this kind of crap. With the filter in place they will only be able to view safe websites.    Plus this filter cannot be bypassed.  http://www.opendns.com/  You will need to create a free account.

tIDNEwdMaa	Chris is clueless.      Windows and Linux require the most knowledge from the user, so being new to computers means that the Macintosh is the better choice.      Macs are for anyone who wants a computer that will work for them.  Windows and Linux is for anyone who wants to work for their computer.      Chris also lists as a reason not to get a Mac "Mac's can't run the same software as Windows  so there is no Microsoft word, excel or Powerpoint".  Gee. I wonder where my Macintosh version of Microsoft Office with Microsoft word, Excel and Powerpoint came from?  And Apple's "more expensive software" that does the same thing?  It about $300 LESS than Microsoft Office.  I would be using it instead if I wasn't able to get Office for the Mac directly from Microsoft for $20 as a benefit of my job.|`|RTa3g9ZHaa	If you don't know anything about computer's there's no point getting a Mac. Mac's are mainly for professional video editors and  business people who know what they're doing. I'm not sure it's a good idea to have a Mac at school. You would be a prime target for theft if you have a Mac in school. Get a cheap windows pc for $300. Mac's can't run the same software as Windows so there is no Microsoft word, excel or Powerpoint, you have to buy Apple's more expensive software.|`|nqbcJjHyaa	The MacBooks all come now with a minimum of 2 GB of ram. Unless you are planing on running Windows at the same time as MacOs X, that's more than enough ram for your needs.  If you have the money, get the new aluminum one and a large hide drive.|`|iQNXZ1zdaa	2GB unless you are:    1. Heavy Photoshop/Final Cut user  2. Want to run Vista/XP in Fusion/Parallels on a regular basis (as opposed to bootcamp)    For internal HD, get the biggest size you can afford.     Also, get an external drive that is at least 2x the laptop drive size for Time Machine backups. NewEgg and Tiger Direct have great deals on external drives.|`|WcZVosUcaa	it depends upon the purpose for which you are purchasing the laptop.  if it is for gaming, then have a minimum of 3GB-4GB of RAM, because now-a-days, games are getting pretty high-end. if it is of normal work, then go for a 2 GB one. but, if you can spend some bucks extra, then i would recommend for a 3GB mac. it's always recommended to have some advance technology in hand.
KnMpfK5Qaa	No you cant you either need S-video, or HDMI if your laptop and tv supports that, you can also use a moniter cable if you tv has an input for it.|`|ByS1Ye8raa	YES|`|oeSSfojfaa	You can, but not using the USB cable (it only carries data).    Your PC should have a video out option. Could be s-video, DVI, composite, or other.  You'd have to run that to your TV input.|`|dOMzkQIraa	You cannot use USB for this.    And depending on your graphics card and TV there are several ways to connect them.|`|V5xHaIAcaa	Assuming your tv has a usb port     good luck
vzqKVGnsaa	That's real easy. Just right click on your desktop, choose Properties. Than choose settings and pick the resolution that suits you the best.
