I've heard the original nintendo games are so old now that they're open source or something like that, meaning anyone can take the code and use it as they please making Nintendo ROM's legal.<br>  <br>  2.) I've also heard that if you own the game, you're allowed to own a ROM, seeing as how it can be construed as a backup.  A buddy of mine got caught downloading Entourage and HBO was PO'd at him, so he went and bought the seasons he downloaded.

There are hacks that you can download that allow this, but EA didn't want teen sims to be able to become pregnant because it would have raised the rating of the game from a T for teen to an M for mature and therefore they would not have been able to sell as many games.<br>  <br>  The most popular teen pregnancy hack, Inteenimator, has not yet been updated to work in Apartment Life.  Or it hadn't been the last time I checked anyway.<br>  <br>  I can give you the link to the site that is hosting the Inteen files though so you can keep an eye on it yourself and will know when it's been updated.  Here's the link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.simbology.com/smf/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.simbology.com/smf/index.php</a><br>  <br>  **I just went to the site to see if Inteen had been updated yet to work with AL.  Apparently the creator of the hack had his computer crash and lost a years' worth of work on Inteen.  He says now that he is simply going to give up and that Inteen will not ever be updated to work with AL.** <br>  <br>  I do know of another teen pregnancy hack that is supposed to work with AL, but the link to the site is in older posts of one of my contacts.  I'll have to search through those posts to try to find the link.  I'll edit this answer if I can find it.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, I'll star your question so if the contact that has a link to the other teen hack sees this question she can post the link for you.<br>  -------------------------------------<br>  LA -- have you ever actually used that cheat to get a teen sim pregnant?  Because everyone I know that has tried it says it doesn't work.  The video is based on an adult sim and if you read the More Info, the person who made that video is not claiming that it will work with teen sims either.<br>  <br>  **To the person who asked this question.  You could try to use the tombstone of life & death to see if it will work, but I really doubt it.<br>  ----------------------------<br>  I found a link to the teen pregnancy hack that is supposed to work with Apartment Life.

CZhN5bIOaa	No!! Do not go back. It'll screw up your life. I used to play for a year in 7th grade, and I got so addicted that sometimes I would wake up at 6 o' clock in the morning and play until 11 o' clock at night. You'll lose whatever life you have on that game. One day my dad grounded me from the computer for 2 months so I could stop being so addicted to that game. I went from straight C's and D's in seventh grade to mostly A's in the 10th grade. When I played RuneScape I lost most of my friends, when I stopped.. now I have about a million friends. I have no idea. <br>  <br>  Trust me. Computer games screw up your life. There are better things you could do.|`|AA10778020	its very responsible of you to be able to admit that you were addicted, lol, you should take some time off from it, but in the mean-time, check out world of warcraft! i love this game! its very in depth and gives you a lot to do, at least do one of the 10 day free trials they offer<br>  <br>  dude, games don't have to ruin lives, just be responsible about playing ;)|`|NRSt3lfbaa	ok,i play runescape for like 3-4 hours aday,but u jus got to control ur self dude.runescape is very fun and can sometimes be adicting,so yea i say go back and jus try to control urself.hey and u can add me as a friend..my username.. 123soccer000|`|CdEpk9Inaa	Again, too long.

jgPJtlEaaa	There are a couple of ways. You can line them up and do a single crochet stitch which will make a seam. Or you can line them up and with  a tapestry needle sew in and out the tops of both sides (going under the loops like for crocheting) and it will make a different kind of seam. Try them both to see which you prefer - you can always take it out again.<br>  I've know some people line them up, pin them together, and sew on a machine. It's your choice!|`|PXWVGQyAaa	Yes you can do that and it shouldn't stretch.<br>  I have included a link that shows joining seams.

ca986effbf18b1196b22a5154e020d6aaa	In spite of people telling you that any individual number has an equal chance of being drawn you will never see 1,2,3,4,5, or 6 in a row in your life time when you are trying to pick several numbers from the same pool of numbers.  This is because there tends to be a BALANCE TO RANDOMNESS when multiple numbers are being picked from a pool of numbers.  If all you are trying to pick is one number out of 53 than yes, each individual one number has an equal chance of being chosen.  This all changes when you are trying to pick multiple random numbers out of the same pool of numbers. Out of, say, a pool of 53 numbers, you will see numbers somewhat spread out from 1 to 53 within the range of the numbers of the particular Lotto you are playing.  The major Lotto games have you choose five numbers with a separate mega number.   This being so, your 5 numbers should add up to around 150 to 165.  Add up the last 100 lotto results and see what the average totals are.  Pick your numbers to add up within that range.  As your mega number use the number that is the most frequently one picked from the stats given on the lotto website.  For the California Mega Lotto it is #36.  Or just use any mega number as this is the case where any one number is just as likely to be drawn as any other number.

oK2sp9W7aa	There are about 40 bets than can be placed on a craps table but basically it is an easy game once you start.  <br>  <br>  To begin you place a bet on the "Pass" or "Don't-Pass" line.  If you bet Pass you are basically hoping the shooter establishes a point and rolls it before he rolls a craps (7).<br>  <br>  No-Pass is just the opposite. Hoping the player rolls a 7 before rolling the point.<br>  <br>  If you are playing craps at home without a table, then these are the only two bets you make and the shooter places the bet on Pass or Don't Pass.  Then each player decides on how much of that bet they want to cover.  When the whole bet is covered the remaining players can bet among themselves. <br>  <br>  Th site below has a good write up on how to play, a betting strategy and types of bets.|`|ciSgaxlMaa	Rolling a seven or eleven wins.  Rolling  a two (snake eyes) or twelve is crapping out.  Roll another number, roll it again before rolling a seven, and you're a winner.  Watch the odds - you can have a lot of fun  shooting craps!

6bC8ipATaa	They are both great games!<br>  <br>  Halo Wars is good for the free play, you can build your own buildings, and choose things to be in your army.

And when your in a party with someone playing it, they make is sound SO fun, dont they?<br>  <br>  Left 4 Dead is AMAZING for its great 4 player campain. But if you dont have friends to play it with, and you dont want to play it online, you would have to play it by your self and the computer players suck. But the best part is the enimies are randomized, so you cant plan for zombie attacks, they will be in a different spot every time!|`|4wQPwkVpaa	ya well depends on your taste halo wars not so much its a strategy game you move a group of people around i think left for dead is better|`|jo9O7203aa	Yeah, L4D has more action because HW is a strategy game.|`|RjGtp41Zaa	They r 2 diferent games. L4D gets boring after 2 weeks, and Halo Wars has more playability. L4D is fun, but I won't even play it until the updates for more levels come out.

GKGQQaObaa	As far as I know you can't send points from account to account and also you can't buy them in 600 point quantity. You can go to pretty much any electronics store and buy the prepaid cards which are usually like 1600 points ($20.00) and you redeem them yourself using the code on the back. The lowest amount you can buy is 500 on xbox Live and I don't know the different amounts on Zune, but you can buy some off amounts on their, but the only way would be to log on using their account and buy the points from there. <br>  <br>  --Oops revised that.

But you can buy points right from your xbox with a bank card or credit card.<br>  And there is no possible way to only buy 600 point because the least amount of points you can buy is 1600 for $20.00 and for 4000 it will be 49.99.|`|6bC8ipATaa	I dont think thats possible. But i could suggest something else! <br>  <br>  First of all, why not just drive out (or get your parents to take you, depending on how old you are) and buy a card.

3uVchBMDaa	No, you can't... If you want a PaRappa the Rapper on handheld, they do have one on the PSP.<br>  <br>  However, the closest game to PaRappa the Rapper on the DS would be Elite Beat Agents.It has similar (sorta) gameplay, it's pretty cheap and has some decent songs on it.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Doubt it because PaRappa belongs to Sony.|`|YPIG1P7taa	Geez I love that game.

XOBOVg6daa	YES it is possible to sustain brain damage. In 2003 our company gave everyone two admission tickets to Disneyland. After riding Space Mountain with some of my co workers, one of the guys said he had a very bad headache after the ride. He went home that evening where he passed away. We found out the next monday when he didn't show up for work. They said it was from the coaster jarring him around. He was a good kid, he was only 24 and had so much more life ahead of him.<br>  <br>  No ride is 100% safe !|`|ZwmVrFeWaa	thats plausible but highly unlikely because in car accident what ever you do you still hit your head.|`|ajnGHNr8aa	The only type of brain damage I have suffered from Disney World is singing it's a small world for three straight hours after getting off the ride.|`|0GzSqXZUaa	no, you really think the ride would be open if this was possible? People would sue.
GDKBqwwJaa	Its a good park, not a big park. It has 6 coasters. Medusa, one of there coasters, is actually one of my favorite coasters. The unique thing about Discovery Kingdom (its in Vallejo by the way, not San Francisco. Id say 45-60 minutes from SF to the park) is that they have animals. They have sharks, dolphins, penguins, a killer whale, walruses, tigers, cougars, giraffes, elephants, birds, and even a butterfly house. They have a dolphin show and a Whale Show. You could do almost everything in the park in a day, at least all the good rides. The park is worth checking out, but its probably not one you would travel far to go to every year, but if you haven't been there yet, it'll be fun.<br>  <br>  As for rides, i recommend:<br>  -Medusa<br>  -Kong<br>  -Roar<br>  -Boomerang<br>  -V2<br>  -Tony Hawks Big Spin<br>  -Vodoo<br>  -Hammerhead Shark<br>  -Monsoon Falls<br>  ..and if you like spinny rides, then Tasmanian Devil.<br>  <br>  I would also recomend seeing the dolphin and Whale show if you have time, and walk through the Shark Exhibit and the Butterfly House.|`|popRBGHUaa	My girlfriend (40) and I (45) are on a thrill quest.  We have been to a number of really cool parks and a number of not-so-good parks, and we have researched just about every amusement park in North America and South America.  Universal Studios didn't look appealing, nor did Six Flags in San Francisco.  If you want maximum thrills in California, our top two choices are Six Flags Magic Mountain and Knott's Berry Farm, both in the Los Angeles area.  Both of them look a lot better than the other parks in California, with Magic Mountain being our number one choice.  In Florida, Busch Gardens looks like the best place to go.  Florida is also home to the tallest Sky Coaster in the US, at around 300 feet tall instead of the usual 150 to 180 foot ones.|`|KODSAedQaa	Six Flags is alright. Ive been there plently, and even though there arent a HUGE section of rides, alot of them are worth it. The park is hardly ever jam-packed busy like Disneyland or Universal, specially in the Spring if I recall. I suggest the Medusa(HELL YES) and V2. Medusa's my favorite--I get the same thrill I did when I first rode it back when I was like 11 x]
Yx0AddHzaa	Dude YES! there is a cheat that can Literally get you any Pokemon any where. Yes you can get a Hetran at sea a Groudon in the grass and much more. if you find the cheat it will work like this. (You may also want a complete pokedex cheat) they will give you 493 master balls in your ITEM slot. (this is the number of Pokemon in the game) now using that pokedex cheat find out what number Pokemon you want. hit R + L and then drop as many master balls until the number you have is that of the Pokemon you want. now go somewhere with level 50+ Pokemon (because the Pokemon that appears will have the level of the one that was originally going to appear) and hold L while walking and continue to do so until the Pokemon you want is on screen. then use a master ball (# will not decrease) to catch it. I think you can find the code at neoseeker. Have Fun!|`|2eCxJp6Paa	they cost $30-40<br>  i've never lost a save because of one, the AR usually breaks/dies on me before i try anything dangerous.(i have 2 dead and 1 useable)<br>  <br>  it works on both, as long as you don't try any dangerously untested codes on a game, it should be fine.<br>  <br>  gscentral has tons of codes, but be very careful what you use, not everything is safe, and i doubt you have a duplicate pokemon save game to test the codes on.<br>  <br>  for those 3 poke, they haven't been been released in an event (to my knowledge), though arceus is the only one not officially announced (though virtually everyone knows about it.)|`|vewWuiWNaa	Don't get an Action Replay...they have a chance of messing up your game.

irFvDZmNaa	Hi Laura! Here is my perspective of gambling. Gambling is not a waste of time for everyone. To make things simple to understand, there are basically TWO main types of people that go to casinos. The GAMBLER, and the CUSTOMER. <br>  <br>  Customers are just regular people who come to the casinos for enjoyment. Some of these customers come once a year, others come many times a year. Sure they want to win, but they are mainly enjoying the entertainment, and are not too much concerned about losing. I wouldn't consider this as a waste of time, because they've paid for the entertainment. <br>  <br>  Then, there is the GAMBLER. You have the WINNING gambler, and the LOSING gambler. <br>  <br>  YES, it is a proven fact that casinos can be beaten. However, only a small percentage of ""sophisticated"" gamblers can successfully develop a strategy/system that can consistently win at casinos. Usually, these games are Baccarat, Craps, Roulette, and BlackJack. <br>  <br>  These intelligent winning gamblers make a living from the casinos. Therefore, it is not a waste of time for them. They are actually being paid "excellent" money for their time. They are having fun, but they are not there for fun. It is strictly business! The only problem that these WINNING gamblers have is HIDING from the Casino Management. It is totally unfair, but casinos DO NOT ALLOW INTELLIGENT GAMBLERS into their casinos. If they discover that you understand how to play the games at a skillful level, they will ask the WINNING gambler to leave! If you come back, you're arrested! This explains why casinos stay in business! They kick out the intelligent winners, and trap in all the losers!<br>  <br>  Now, the LOSING Gambler is a gambler who wins big quite often, BUT LOSES WAY MORE! They are there to win, but have very weak strategies for winning! Therefore, in the long run, they are losing far more than they win. Some of these losing gamblers are willing to spend their entire paychecks, or even rent/bill money just to gamble. The losing gambler is why there are hotlines available for gambling addictions. Therefore, you may consider it a waste of time for these losing gamblers.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	That's why you should only play poker in a casino.  You play any other casino games, you will lose in long term.|`|ciSgaxlMaa	I find it relaxing and entertaining.  A night out at a casino can cost less (and yes, sometimes come home with a profit) than dinner and a show.  I love the thrill of it.|`|WxmNSxNGaa	Gambling is a type of entertainment that you pay to play. If you don't enjoy the games or the price of admission, just don't play. Simple as that. It would be like a person who hated playing golf trying to play a round at Doral for $200 then complaining that it wasn't any fun and was a waste of money.|`|l4ZQchFkaa	Totally stupid! I've lived in Vegas my whole life, I just turned 40.<br>  If I never had gambled, I would be able to retire now! But I started working when I was 15. Not to mention, I really never gambled to real extremes. Comparing myself to people I grew up with here, I'm no where close to how much they have blown!! Kinda sad.|`|AA11614126	yes i think its a waste of money and casinos are no place to spend all of your hard earned cash|`|BdKKrRdcaa	Casinos are very alluring and fun if not only for the fun of people watching.  you dont have to bet...but if you do chose to lay out your money...you either have to be willing to lose (set yoour limits) and have fun...or you need to have a plan on how to win (money management and strategy)...good luck!!
popRBGHUaa	I don't know, but they have a lot of cool rides and that's what I am looking for.  Six Flags Magic Mountain isn't far away, and they have even better rides.  It might be a little rainy in April, but not as bad as February.  Just keep an eye on the weather forecasts so you won't be disappointed.|`|Xmq93EGvaa	knotts berry farm is eehh.. very little rides and mostly accelerator is closed.. now you should definitely go to six flags!!!! and the weather in april it wud depend|`|KODSAedQaa	Knott's Berry is the place to be if you love thrill rides.

4lHtlCRdaa	If you'er buying TF2 retail then it's going to cost a little more than if you buy it from steam. They're not really called patches we call them updates and so far there is a heavy update which gives you achievments and weapons that you unlock from getting achievments, the pyro, medic and scout update which came out just a couple days ago. It's not too late to buy the game it's just going to take a liitle longer to download depending on your download speed.|`|nES73ERCaa	Retail your pretty much just getting a hard copy back up of the game it would be faster to intially install tff2 with the retail copy but if you download it from steam you also download the updates in one go, but ofc depends on the speed of ur net

Lmh3ybBTaa	Punch it in the head really hard. But do not knock it off its rocker..|`|WoRaXE73aa	Maybe you should try something different if you still want to play a game.

31v7TjzFaa	If your talking about them in theme/amusement parks. People like arcades in general, something to do other than rides and for people to spend more money on of course. I try not to play arcade games, they're addictive and a waste of time and money really as you can find them everywhere but you won't be in the theme often.
2fdbc7443c540a20c47fbfa2503ff7e6aa	This is what happens when there is a general hardware failure.  It is usually caused by over heating or moving the console while there is a disc in the tray.  If your system has these problems, there red lights will flash around the light ring on the front of the console.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|5e3a08fb0f8df1781963c23284f90448aa	It means there's something wrong with the system.

Microsoft has never directly addressed the issue of why 360s tend to burn out rather often, but as with all high end electronics, heat is the most likely cause.

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	There is no rumble support for the PS3.<br>  <br>  Sony did not copy Nintendo when it comes to the rumble feature.  Get your facts straight before you post anything.<br>  <br>  This is the story about how Sony decided not to go with the rumble feature on the PS3 controller.<br>  <br>  A few years ago, Immersion (company that owns the copyright to the rumble technology) sued MS and Sony for stealing the rumble technology.  The court ruled in favor of Immersion.  MS decided to settle and bought a share in the company, so that's why the 360 still has the rumble technology.  Sony, on the other hand, is still appealing the verdict.  So, if Sony were to include the rumble in the PS3, it could end up losing a lot more money due to royalties, so Sony decided not to use it, just in case it loses its appeal.  Sony denied this reason, instead stating that the rumble would interfere with the Sixaxis.  Immersion said that it would work with Sony to make the rumble compatible with the Sixaxis if Sony agrees to drop the appeal, pay the royalties from the PS2, and give further royalties from the sale of the PS3 controller.|`|AA11547859	No, Sony decided not to have  rumble support for the PS3, i think in s couple of months Sony will change their miinds though|`|3f4c074200d0b44667b912c0a3392012aa	no, because it interferes with the motion sensors. and also because nobody cares much about that|`|4828cab974b951fb3a987dab568834d2aa	yes|`|7b57e805a3fec89b2c27f8954a752618aa	i dunno, but some people are killing to get a PS3 because there are only 600,000 realeased into the US so, yeah! i think...|`|aaf652e75e8d28eed98a1b89879dc816aa	well if sony was as smart as nintendo they could have done it because the we has rumble and it is a motion sensitive controller and plus i heard sony got in trouble with nintendo for stealing there whole rumble idea from the beggining LONG LIVE THE WII

AA11547859	PS3|`|54ee949a29ec434c807c9728f22ca599aa	I actually just had a discussion with my friend about this.<br>  <br>  hardware wise,  the ps3 has faster hardware,  <br>  1. 3200 mhz memory clock speed rather than 360's 700mhz.  <br>  2. a processor with 2 floating points rather than 360's one floating point. <br>  3. graphics processor is 50 mhz faster nvidia (xbox uses ati)dont know what chips so i caint really tell which is better..  <br>  4. blue tooth is 7x rather than 360's 4x.<br>  5. the biggest difference is ps3 uses blu ray technology. the 360 does not use this.  what this means is the xbox360 is limited to 4 gig's of data. the ps3 is limited to 50 gig's of data. the more data on the disk, means more information and more graphical detail.  A WHOLE FRICKIN LOT MORE DETAIL.<br>  <br>  however, keep this in mind, unless you have an expensive HD tv, expansive HD cables. and alot more money for everything else. you will not get the graphic detail. <br>  <br>  if it was my choice. i would go with the 360, the graphics still look amazing, but only cost a fraction of the price.<br>  <br>  ABOVE ALL ELSE.  what is more important, everyone always drewls over the hardware of systems. if you really want to knwo what one is better.   research what games are out there for each system. ps3 right now only has 11. i dont know how many 360 has. but google them, find out which one has the games you will have more fun playing. and judge the boxes by that. the ps3 has an asscasan game that looks awsome.<br>  <br>  you wont get the full potential of the ps3 unless you have a very expensive HD tv. remember that if the graphic quality is what you are looking at.<br>  <br>  hope this helped<br>  <br>  <br>  by the way, i can play any game from any system on my computer, (sonic is awsome) with the same or better graphics (aside from smaller screen). and a mouse is easier to use than a thumb joystick.<br>  mmikewwarren@Hotmail.com|`|5ec2645b570143e9bcbef781a37ade2caa	there pretty much the same thing so id go with the xbox 360 for halo 3|`|769f5a25a5a43bf18961fe750e4bac27aa	really who cares
54a71494855e0d728b9ec00aab8ff5cfaa	It takes a lot of practice. You start out by learning to maneuver a quarter, or nickle if you small hands, between, over and under your fingers. Imagine a baton twirler, twirling a baton across their fingers like they do. Do the same thing with a coin, roll it over to the back side of your hand and hold it against your middle finger with your ring and index finger. Then when you close your hand you cover it with your thumb and palm it.

AA11609783	Me too. I am a fan of the Jak and Daxter series and was upset when Daxter came out on the PSP because I wasn't able to play it because I didn't hav a PSP. To answer your question, yes.

AA12305759	well, if you have a mommy with a baby, and you've uncovered  the lagoon, put the mommy w/ the baby in the lagoon (you may have to do this a few times), and voila you've uncovered the golden child (the "lightbulb" mystery)! the golden child is the key to all the mysteries. bring him to the garden, he'll summon butterflies there and solve the butterfly mystery. he will also open the cave, but you can't make him do that. u have to wait for him to do that. also, bring him to the fruitless plant, and he'll uncover flower stars mystery. im not sure about the box though.

I remember that the was a AO (adults only) game for the N64 but I doubt they have any for the DS. Buy a PSP if you want more blood and gore. That's really why Nintendo isn't the dominant video game producer anymore. People want blood and gore when all they have is adventure games...<br>  <br>  from FOX:<br>  "A DS isn't really the system for people like you. It's made for gamers."<br>  wtf?|`|AA11547859	I don't think that there is one.  If you want a game like that get psp, I no that has gta and metal gear solid.|`|05ca647c0455868a71b1254f24bc2782aa	If you actually played Mario, you would not call it crap.  Just because a game doesn't have blood or too much violence, it doesn't mean it's crap.<br>  <br>  Even the Metal Gear games discourage violence.  The new Metal Gear games don't even have blood, and it's nearly impossible to beat the game if you do kill people.<br>  <br>  You obviously aren't a gamer, but I'll answer your question:<br>  <br>  DS does have a few violent games, but not many M rated ones.<br>  <br>  Resident Evil: Deadly Silence is rated M, and has more violence and blood than the console ones do.<br>  <br>  Technu DS is violent and has blood, but I believe it only has a T rating.<br>  <br>  Trauma Center has blood and violence, but the point of the game is to save people, which casual gamers, such as yourself, don't like doing.<br>  <br>  The two Castlevania games have tons of blood and violence, but only T ratings (which is strange, as they have more violence than a GTA game.  Maybe it's because the enemies usually aren't humans.)<br>  <br>  The sequel to Resident Evil DS will also be rated M.<br>  <br>  <br>  Overall, there are a few violent DS games, but they are good, unlike GTA games, where pointless and unrealistic violence is encouraged.  <br>  <br>  A DS isn't really the system for people like you.  It's made for gamers.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  To Back Order3d:<br>  <br>  Nintendo does make M rated game, just not many.  BTW, Nintendo has recently become the leader in gaming again, with the DS and Wii.<br>  <br>  Although the 360 has almost double the amount of systems sold, the Wii just came out, and it is still short in supply. <br>  <br>  The PS3 isn't even close to either, even with tons of units availabe.  I'm sure this will change when MGS4 comes out, but for now, it's a flop.<br>  <br>  With handhelds, Nintendo is in an amazing lead.  The DS is the best selling game system in the history of gaming, and the sales are still not slowing.<br>  <br>  So, Nintendo is in the lead with sales, and truly is in profit.  They made a 1.6 billion dollar profit in 2006, and Sony LOST more than 1.6 billion in their game department.<br>  <br>  <br>  And yes, the DS is for real gamers.  Real gamers are people who play games because they are good.  Not just because they are "cool" and violent.

7c6c1fb80a93cf832b260eb8cc58cad8aa	Hojo of Shinra revealed toward the end of the game (FF7) while preparing to fire the Sister Ray that he was indeed Sephiroth's father.  This preceeds the boss battle where you fight him in his mutant forms.<br>  <br>  Lucrecia is the woman who carried Sephiroth, (I don't know if Hojo impregnated her naturally or had an embryo implanted - not sure either when Sephiroth received Jenova cells).  Vincent was in love with her but was attacked and altered (into what he is now) by Professor Gast before his long sleep in a hidden room beneath the Shinra Mansion ( the one you find him in).  It was while he was in this sleep that Sephiroth came about.|`|AA11547859	yo momma|`|cd0b8a606b8fa881ab509aa821fea79baa	Yes, Sephiroth's father is Hojo and his mother is Lucrecia.

If you like clever puzzlish games and great multiplayer modes such as minigames and just clearing the boards, Super Monkey Ball 2. If you like extreme sports, Tony Hawk 3 THPS3 is actually the last classic Tony Hawk game. They changed the way tricks are done after THPS3. If you like life simulators with a lot of great aspects, get The Sims (However I'd recommend spending a little extra cash for The Sims 2 if you want the first one). All 3 have great replay value.<br>  <br>  MY personal preference however would be... er... well, THPS3 and Super Monkey Ball 2 are tied... Sims 3rd.<br>  Here's what I do when I have to decide something... flip a coin. Since it's 3, however, roll a die for each game. Highest or lowest (Pick one) wins (In the event of a tie, roll again to break it).|`|7044deff64a7699e758a7c15a5f81c38aa	monkey ball sucks so tony hawk or the sims sims is probably better|`|738ecb69bbe449b4366f0c7b52f0de2eaa	sims player's choicer|`|7f794adb0bef78e4be76b3160dc3444eaa	Monkey ball all the way...i love tht game, then i guess sims then tony hawk but i would definantly go with monkey ball
5e3a08fb0f8df1781963c23284f90448aa	It freezes because your PS3 is heating UP!!!  It's got to be in an open space!!!  Didn't you ever hear what was wrong with the PS3!?  Don't anyone tell him or me that that isn't the problem,  IT IS!  PS3 sucks, at least for now, you should've waited for Sony to get all the bugs worked out.  Sorry...but that's the problem.  Nothing's wrong with any of the games...it's just the system.  TRUST ME.|`|WmOMSISpaa	While I hate to agree with Soaper *cough*360wiifanboy*cough*, his scenario is a possibility.  The biggest issue with the PS3 thus far has been overheating--not because of hardware problems, but because users have mistakenly put their systems in confined spaces with little airflow.  Make no mistake--the ps3 is a pc--with an internal power supply--you do the math : )  Try propping your PS3 up and putting an external fan on it for a while.  If it's only Resistance you're having problems with--call the developer number in the game manual.  Give them that information and they should be able to diagnose what's causing your problems.  More than likely they'll send you a free replacement game.  Not all Blu-ray discs are perfect--it is a new medium after all : )<br>  <br>  Test with other games, my bet is that the disc is your culprit.  That's certainly more convenient than finding out Sony needs to replace your PS3!!

Dale had his hand out the window when Edwards hit him. Earnhardt could have been seriously injured, possibly career ending if he would have hit his arm.  Edwards didn't care.<br>  This is not the first time Edwards has ran into someone like this.  Earlier this year, he ran into Tony Stewart in the pits in retaliation for an on track incident.<br>  He took out Earnhardt in a race last year eliminating any chances of making the chase, and nothing happened to him.<br>  This fine is pocket change to one of these drivers.  Probation usually doesn't mean that much either.<br>  Make him take a good hit in the points, that will get his attention.|`|AA11135420	I don't think it was JR's fault.

Do you ever search for your question before you ask it?<br>  <br>  If you asked the question right, it would say, "What is the third word in the English language . . ." and then a possible answer would be "language," since it's the third word in the phrase, "the English language."<br>  <br>  Here's the question as it should appear - <br>  "Think of words ending in -GRY. Angry and hungry are two. There are only three words in the English language. What is the third word? The word is something that everyone uses every day. If you have listened carefully, I have already told you what it is."|`|e49991de1c878b3d264b0574f33f6438aa	....gry|`|5e943832ad4d30c146d92c5b9c920b45aa	meagry or aggry|`|AA12106297	<a href="http://www.fun-with-words.com/word_gry_angry_hungry.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fun-with-words.com/word_gry_a...</a>|`|AA12210152	This is an old trivia puzzle.<br>  There is actually no third word that ends in GRY.<br>  However; the question says "There are three words in the english language..."<br>  So if we look at the three words that make up the phrase 'the english language', obviously the third word is 'language'.

It's not like the way different balls feel and move in real life.<br>  <br>  So it's basically down to which you like the look of most. Saying that, i'm not aware of any bonus unlocks which may change the way the ball acts.

However your question isn't real specific|`|2728dfb022c14792863b78aafcfd0d23aa	What sort of system components do you have?  MS says you only need a 1GHz processor with 256 MB or RAM, but they must be smoking something when they list those requirements.  In the review I read on Gamespot, they were using an Athlon 3400+ with 2 GB of RAM and an nVidia 7800 graphics card and it could only get a frame rate of about 8 -14 frames per second.  So it sounds to me like you need a pretty kick-*** system for it to run well.

The games you purchase on-line or the ones you buy at the store cost money because it cost the producing company money to make them.

They you have to go wireless, then you have to get a card, then you have to get points, then you have to get books and codes and a magazine subscription... just to play it.  I finally went to play a game I spent $60 on and I could not make splinter cell walk up the steps, in the orentation round!!!  Plus he only wants the Mature games, and the ratings do not make sense!

efacf4fe8ff572fe3bfdfbff79c824e4aa	One that I haven't seen mentioned is Guild Wars.  This one has no monthly fees, but you do have to buy the software.  It already has 2 expansions, so you know that it has substance, and the PVP is unrivaled, in my eyes, and I have literally played every MMO for at least 3 months a piece, some at the same time :P.  It's fast paced, and has a great community.  I'm sure you'll like this one.  Good luck funding your perfect addiction :D|`|YbaqHPSEaa	you can play piratekingonline.its almost like maplestory.|`|i75pLoPmaa	In my knowledge of them (which is very limited - I have dial-up - so I can't play them) they always have a subsription fee. They wouldn't make any money if they didn't, would they? The games themselves would cost around $50, but that is not all the money they get. Also, it cost money, believe it or not, to have those huge, multi-giga byte games online all the time. So, no, I'd have to say all the ones you want cost money.<br>  <br>  AtG|`|U0ROjjG3aa	Well Runescape is ok and Maple Story.  but Guild Wars is the greatest free rpg in my opinion, u have 2 buy it at the store, but its free online play!!!  if u want a great online xpierence, then u should get this game..if not get runescape or maple story

If you have a Hobby Lobby or Micheals they sell wax. If you purchase your paraffin wax at Hobby lobby go to their website and they usually have a 40% coupon you can print out. If you were to purchase soy wax you would be better purchasing that at one of the online sights in bulk. here are a few sites I go to to purchase scents. Natures Garden and Peaks candle. If you go to google and type in candle supplies a bunch will pop up.

Mlwd5Bt3aa	Yeah, you can lose weight.  I read about a woman who lost 100lbs playing DDR everyday.  She would put it on workout mode for 60 minutes and just dance ^^<br>  <br>  But It really depends on your weight and height, also how much calories you eat per day.  It's good exercise, work it out :D|`|5e8gXeUZaa	that depends on ur eating habits|`|CzQZ3vXraa	yes, about 5-15 pounds at min.|`|RzSa0TNraa	Yes!!! It's alot of exercise.

Here, this is something I read on the internet:<br>  ""I was looking at the area near the end and noticed that you had the event<br>  Pokemon, and that the events are not in the US. Well, people don't have to wait<br>  for an event. Put this in your FAQ: Go to the Jubilife TV Station and find a<br>  reporter. He will then ask what you think of TV or something. Put<br>  "EVERYONE HAPPY". Then he will ask for feedback. Put "WI-FI CONNECTION". This<br>  unlocks the "Mystery Gift" option at the main menu. Save your game and restart<br>  the DS. Then select "Mystery Gift" on the main menu. You will have 3 options:<br>  Obtain via Friend, Obtain via Wireless or Obtain via WFC. When you beat the<br>  Elite 4 and obtain the National Dex, go to the Obtain via WFC. The mystery gift<br>  will be downloaded from the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection (Nintendo WFC). That is <br>  another way to get the event Pokemon without cheating."<br>  <br>  This enables the mystery gift option on startup but you still need to wait for<br>  the event to happen to get the event pokemon. The following sections only apply<br>  if you obtained the event via hacking or mystery gift."<br>  -IGN FAQs|`|EI2H0x3jaa	i have dimond e-mail me normajean94
T83rTRe3aa	te gts is i forget wut stand for but is the wi-fi trading building|`|AA11262556	GTS is global trade station. It is located in Jubilife City. You can only go there after you beat a certain amount of gym leaders(I think its 1 or 2). What you do is offer one of your pokemon and ask for a pokemon that you have already seen. This is useful for starter pokemon or rare pokemon or version exclusive pokemon.. That is how I got all the starter pokeon.|`|4qFQpxlfaa	It stands for Global Trade Station It lets you trade to other people from around the world with the game
cWBruuN7aa	It is a food that you can feed to your Pokemon. Certain types of poffin should be fed to certain types of Pokemon, typically based upon your Pokemon's mood. Overall, feeding your Pokemon those specific poffin will make them much friendlier.<br>  <br>  I hope this information helps you.
N1al84J1aa	Well, you'll need to know Cut first. Go to Route 02 and cut the trees. Now go to where the ttrees were blocking and go into the blue-roofed building. You will see one of Professor Oak's assistants. He will give you HM 05 Flash... but only if you have 10 pokemon in your Pokedex.|`|nnBljq7paa	basicly any store|`|AA10047060	jordan s is correct

Annoying little thing isn't it? Well first of all you need a pokemon that knows how to use "Fly". Use the "Marking Map" (Receive from the Poketch President in the Poketch Company Building in Jubilife City after earning 3 Gym Badges.) on your Poketch to track down it's location. It'll be the blinking face on your map. Your gonna have to be really fast about getting there. Once your close to it, it'll flee to another location if your not quick. In order to<br>  encounter it, you'll need to be at the same location its at and will need to encounter it inside of tall grass. It will run immediately unless you use an attack like "Mean Look" or "Scary Face"! Any damage you do or status conditions you inflict will remain on it for your next encounter if it flees.|`|NyDrTXFeaa	well have a pokemon with mean look then it can't escape worked for me.
eiuHee5Waa	Send it to Microsoft to repair it.|`|3a985bd1cfe3739c988a421b7bc901b7aa	call microsoft tech support and then they will send you a box... you will get your Xbox back in 3 to 4 weeks or so... i had to return my xbox twice already...

The wii is fun, and they will have more games comiing out, but if you want more shooter adult type games I would go wioth the 360, if you want more family type games go with the wii, wii sports is easy enough that even someone who has never played a video game, can still put up a good challange against a somewhat savy pro,  and if you are younger it will possibly get your parents interested in it, which means they might purchase a few games..|`|aba6ca4c0b1e21d64aad707343fafbaaaa	wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii... fer sure :D<br>  you won't regret it

6OoDpOtZaa	The Pokemon and the Trainers inside of Victory Road have very high levels,<br>  spanning from the mid- to upper-40's range. Your Pokemon should be at least<br>  Level 48 before entering (or trying to complete the whole thing), although I<br>  would recommend lower-to-mid-50's.<br>  <br>  From the start, you will have to cross a bridge. Across the bridge, you can<br>  use Rock Climb to get down to the lower area of the first floor, fight the<br>  Psychic, and pick up TM41 (Torment). There's nothing else down here, though,<br>  so Rock Climb your way back up, and then head east.<br>  <br>  When you get to a place that you can climb some steps down, do so, fight<br>  against the Birdkeeper, and continue north to pick up a Full Heal. Go back to<br>  where the bridge takes you north and follow that path north, west, and then<br>  north again to a flight of stairs.<br>  <br>  Up on the second floor, you can either go north or south. Going north will<br>  lead you to some bike ramps and boulders that you need to move, all of which<br>  will eventually lead you to a Max Ether.<br>  <br>  Going south will lead you to a boulder formation like this:<br>  .------.<br>  | #..# |<br>  | .21# |<br>  | .3.# |<br>  | ..## |<br>  '------'<br>  ("." denotes the cave floor, "#" denotes a wall, and the numbers 1, 2, and 3<br>  mark the locations of the boulders you need to push.)<br>  <br>  Push boulder 1 south, boulder 2 west, and boulder 3 south and you'll be able<br>  to pass. Keep going west until you find another puzzle.<br>  <br>  .----------.<br>  | ###..... |<br>  | #..12xxx |<br>  | #.x..... |<br>  | #..R###. |<br>  | #...###. |<br>  '----------'<br>  (Same as the previous one, except "x" denotes unsmashable rocks, and "R"<br>  denotes a smashable rock.)<br>  <br>  To solve this one, push the boulder on the left down one tile, then go over to<br>  the smashable rock (marked "R"). Rock Smash it, and then push the boulder<br>  north, up to the Trainer (not shown on diagram). Go east, use Rock Smash<br>  again, fight a Trainer, and then you'll have to solve another puzzle. This one<br>  is easy, though; just push the top-most boulder west and head north and you'll<br>  find yourself at a flight of stairs leading down. However, if you go back down<br>  the stairs and to the puzzle again, you'll be able to go over to the east,<br>  where there are more boulder puzzles, as well as bike ramps that can lead you<br>  to a Full Restore, a Double Battle against the Double Team, and TM71 (Stone<br>  Edge).<br>  <br>  Now you'll be back on the first floor. Cross the bridge over to a ledge that<br>  you can use Rock Climb down, but be careful not to jump off of the ledge<br>  below, otherwise you'll have to backtrack. Make your way around the cliff you<br>  were on until you find a Black Belt. Beat him, and you'll reach another flight<br>  of stairs leading down.<br>  <br>  Surf over to the Psychic (don't bother taking the north route). Go east, and<br>  then south to find a Double Team. Fight them, and then Surf down the path,<br>  climbing upstairs, to reach a Rare Candy. There's also a Max Revive hidden<br>  nearby, so use your Dowsing Machine.<br>  <br>  Go back to where the Psychic was and then Surf north until you reach a<br>  waterfall. Use Waterfall to climb it, and then take the path west until you<br>  find a Dragon Tamer. From here, you can take the southern Waterfall down to<br>  TM59 (Dragon Pulse). Otherwise, beat him, then keep going west, then south<br>  until you find a flight of stairs.<br>  <br>  You'll be back on the first floor again. Head west until you get to a Expert.<br>  Keep going west past him and you'll find the Razor Claw. Climbing up the steps<br>  by the Expert and then heading east will lead you to a Zinc and a person<br>  blocking passage into another part of the cave. Otherwise, go south, then up<br>  the cliff to the east so you can fight another Dragon Tamer. Fight him, cross<br>  the bridge, and you'll be at the exit.<br>  <br>  Also, south of the Expert in the aforementioned step, instead of going east,<br>  go west, use Rock Climb, and make your way to the flight of stairs. This will<br>  lead you up to a boulder puzzle.<br>  .-----------.<br>  | ######### |<br>  | #x.1..-># |<br>  | #$.3..-># |<br>  | #x.2..-># |<br>  | ######### |<br>  '-----------'<br>  ("$" marks the item [TM79], and the "->" marks the location of the stairs.)<br>  <br>  Push boulder 1 west, then boulder 2 west, and then boulder 3 either north or<br>  south to access TM79 (Dark Pulse).|`|KvYr7sKuaa	Well, for the mudslide ramps, you need to change gears on your bike so that it goes fast after building speed- you can clear those ramps at top speed!<br>  <br>  Victory Road isn't that tough- just keep trying new paths until you get through.<br>  <br>  For a full walkthrough, Serabii.net should have one.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|NyDrTXFeaa	you have to hold B while heading tourd the ramp. if you go slow then you will jump like 1 step.|`|dttpVgYeaa	<a href="http://serebii.net/" rel="nofollow">http://serebii.net/</a>|`|OIbBPz3Maa	go to marriland.com for victory thing and for the ramp u change into the slow bike and then change into the fast bike as you are about to jump. hope this helps

It's a racing game that you can chose your character and what track you want to race. you start out with only a few tracks to race but you can earn more. Plus, you guys could play together. What I mean is you could race each other wirelessly. One more thing, It's not just racing, you can do to other things: Balloon Battles and shine runners. In balloon battles you shoot each other with shells(bullets) and stuff like that. ln shine runners you drive around and collect stuff. well I hope this helps!!|`|xUVZe7vYaa	animal crossing is a great non-challenging game. mario kart, advance wars, new super mario bros., and kirby:canvas curse are all great too. a good girls game is super princess peach too.|`|8t2K3YBvaa	lostmagic is a great game and it is a great challenge for the RPG fans.|`|AA10245727	Racing- Mario Kart DS<br>  Turn Based Strategy- Advance Wars -Dual Strike (hard to find but well worth the hunt)<br>  I just picked up Yoshi's Island DS and I am amazed that I forgot how awesome all of those side-scroller Mario games are.<br>  <br>  Pick up all three of those.

ypRJx2QDaa	Unless your taking about ISO, UMD ripped games, I don't know because its illegal.<br>  But some good games that people make are called Homebrew, but unfortunately, the piraters made a UMD ripper, so Homebrewers also have access to ISO games, which are illegal. So Dark-Alex, a great coder made an OE firmware, open edition, which enables PSP users to play Homebrew, although they must downgrade (to lower your PSP firmware via special walkthoughs and codings) and then update to the OE. Dark-Alex wants PSP users to have the full potential of the PSP, and some home-made Apps and Games, by the PSP users themselves. But it also lets you play ISO games. Did I mention it was illegal?<br>  And for the Homebrew, there is <br>  -<a href="http://www.pspupdates.qj.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pspupdates.qj.net/</a> <br>  and <br>  -<a href="http://www.dcemu.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dcemu.co.uk/</a> (they also have a forum, great fun place).|`|i75pLoPmaa	If you want good quality games, then they must be programmed by professionals. This means it is illegal to download games for free, at least the good ones. Freeware is out there, but is usually not that great.
AA11573113	My Ultima Weapon Guide!!!<br>  <br>  There are only 7 of the Orichaleum+! (Too Bad), The locations are as follows in order:<br>  <br>  1.Twilight Town: Near Sunset Station on the building to your right.<br>  2.Space Paranoids: In the area just before the MCP, look to the left.<br>  3.Atlantica: Clear the Musical Stage "A New Day is Dawning" (The last one!)<br>  4.The World That Never Was: Brink of Despair, look immediately around, I nearly missed this one, you'll need to find a ledge to get to it.<br>  5.100 Acre Wood: Ending Scene in Starry Hill (Need all the pages)<br>  6. Olympus Coliseum: Successfully complete the 'Goddess of Fate Cup'.<br>  7. Collect at least one of all the materials used for synthesis. This means one of all of the shards, stones, gems, and crystals possible for synthesis.<br>  <br>  You can actually synthesize with 7 or even 4 Orichaleum+! Here's how you do it<br>  <br>  1. You'll need to use a Bright Crystal. (hint: there are only 7 in the game and it wont let you synthesize if you don't have at least half of the items in the first place.) Smart use of the Bright Gems will save you a lot of searching! This will lower the count to 7! <br>  <br>  2. Take it one step further and become a Primo Moogle (lv.9) this will lower the item count on a 'S' items by half. (Hint: to get to a Primo faster, just use the energy crystals to double to experience points on each item you create.) Now you have to shell out 4, leaving you 3 to just keep as worthless treasure that you'll never be able to use!<br>  <br>  Now, to get to level 9 (Primo Moogle), you'll need to use the energy items to help boost the experience points of each item you synthesize.<br>  <br>  To uncover all the ????? that you have no idea what the items are in your creations list and you've already uncovered the recipes and all the free development items, use the serenity items. This will 'power up' the item to the next level. (Ex: AP Up => Power Up with the use of a serenity gem).<br>  <br>  And of course the bright items are used to simply reduce the item count by half, and as I've already said, use these items wisely and you'll save your self a lot of time!<br>  <br>  (Oh one more thing, equipt 'lucky lucky' to all of your teammates and epuipt them with wepons that have a 'lucky lucky' bonus. You'll get almost a synthesis item every time when you defeat an enemy. Sometimes you might get rare dropped wepons from heartless and nobodies.)|`|B5trdd5Gaa	Orichalcum+ is rarer than Orichalcum, though there only 7 in the whole game:<br>  <br>  -[100 Acre Woods]- Free pooh from the honey pot in Starry Hill.<br>  <br>  -[Atlantic]: Complete "a new day is dawning" In atlantic<br>  <br>  -[Space Paranoids]: in the Central Computer Mesa area there is a treasure chest, which should be an Orichalcum+<br>  <br>  -[Twilight Town]: It is near Sunset Station, the orichalcum+  is in a treasure chest.<br>  <br>  -[The World that never was]: In the Brink of Despair, there should be one in an treasure chest.<br>  <br>  -[Olympus Coliseum]: Complete the Goddess of Fate Cup in Olympus Coliseum.<br>  <br>  - Once you get all the Synthesis Materials goto Moogle shop and you should get a orichalcum+<br>  <br>  Also the Lucky Lucky Keyblade might is fairly handy to find rare items.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Ptk1sYMbaa	First, how many do you have?<br>  They are in <br>  Space Paranoids<br>  Twilight Town<br>  The World that Never Was<br>  100 Acre Wood<br>  Atlantica<br>  Olympus Coliseum<br>  Prize for gathering all material types

I think there 60 gb is outselling the 20 gb by a 5:1 margin.  <br>  <br>  I think GB is just trying to get rid of whatever 20 gb they have left.|`|bgohEtTbaa	No.  Most likely they are just clearing old stock from warehouses and stuff like that.<br>  <br>  No more 20GB versions are being produced, only the 60GB version.

KvYr7sKuaa	No, he can't- Mesprit can only be found in the mainland.<br>  <br>  I recommend this strategy for capturing Mesprit- There's a stretch of land that's on a direct left-to-right path that crosses Floaroma town, Valley Windworks, and the route in-between. Bicycle across that path over and over again, and Mesprit will eventually draw close.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|NyDrTXFeaa	umm i guess so it never appeard there in my game though (pearl)|`|5cdc81aa5c7fcfe9b6e95e690ff3f9bfaa	No, he can only be found in the mainland.

HCa3tW6saa	Ping is basically the speed at which your modem connection is sending and receiving information at that point.<br>  The lower the better. I run ethernet and hit around 200's usually. Anything in the 900s and higher is bad.<br>  On games like starcraft on battlenet it can be affected by battlenet itself, also people can see your ping and if it is to high they will boot you.<br>  In WoW it shows as the latency bar at the bottom, color coded for convience... green is good.<br>  I would suggest a better connection and close out all appliations when playing your game. AIM and other instant messangers put a real drain on it.|`|bgohEtTbaa	Get broadband internet if you don't have it already.<br>  <br>  If you have other applications up that could be communicating with servers shut them down before playing.<br>  <br>  If you are playing off a wireless router, try connecting directly to the modem.

DiW863pPaa	Mt. Coronet BEFORE Surf:<br>  <br>  The cave itself is pretty straightforward, although you can catch Meditites, Machops, and even Chingling. If you don't have a Fighting type Pokemon yet and you have room on your team for one, either Meditite or Machop would make a good choice.<br>  <br>  Head south a bit, and approach the stairs. As you approach the stairs, a man with blue hair will walk towards you, and will then talk to you about Sinnoh and Mt. Coronet. He'll then leave.<br>  <br>  There really isn't anything much left to do here for the time being, although after you get Surf later on in the game, you'll want to come back and explore the areas blocked off by water. The exit is on the east side of the cave, as expected, and is pretty easy to find.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mt. Coronet AFTER Surf:<br>  <br>  To get to Lake Acuity, you'll need to first travel through Mt. Coronet. Fly to Eterna City, make sure you have a sufficient amount of items and Pokemon on your team that know both Strength and Defog, and preferably Surf and Rock Smash as well.<br>  <br>  Return to the Mt. Coronet entrance on Route 211 (West) (either side works actually, although I'm going to start from the west side near Eterna City), although now you are able to push the boulders in there. Push the northern boulder to access TM69 (Rock Polish). Pushing the eastern boulder will lead you over to Route 211 (East).<br>  <br>  Push the boulder north, then smash some rocks, and you'll find a Rare Candy. Go back to the east, and then go north, down a set of stairs, and you'll eventually find a set of stairs going down.<br>  <br>  In the basement, you will need to use Defog in order to clear the fog. Right near the stairs you can use Rock Smash to get a Stardust. Head north, and you'll see a large lake. Down in the lake, you can Surf to the east and find a small landing area that contains Light Clay. Otherwise, keep riding on the elevated path until you see stairs going down to the middle layer. Use Strength to move the boulder and you'll find Soft Sand.<br>  <br>  Near the northern side of the room, you'll find a boulder in front of a Revive. Move the boulder, and then pick up the Revive. Keep going along the side of the cliff, using Rock Smash when you need to, and you'll eventually find a Full Restore. You can also Rock Smash near the coast there to get a Max Elixir.<br>  <br>  After you've picked up everything you want to, return to the northwest corner of the room, and then take the flight up stairs out of the basement.<br>  <br>  Back on the first floor, there's a HP Up hidden in the wall between the two rocks. Keep going, and you'll find the exit to Route 216.<br>  <br>  <br>  After fighting Cyrus in the Calactic Veilstone Building:<br>  <br>  <br>  Before entering, I strongly recommend stocking up on at least 30 Ultra Balls (or, if you are playing at night, buy Dusk Balls instead). You will be able to catch a Legendary Pokemon very soon, so you will need them!<br>  <br>  Inside of the south side of Mt. Coronet (by Route 208), use Surf to cross the northern body of water and then use Rock Climb to climb the rocks.<br>  <br>  Upstairs, you can find a Max Potion on your way to the west up the stairs, along with an Ether in the nearby rock. An Escape Rope is on the very south side of the continued path, although you'll want to take the stairs going up onto the elevated area. There's an exit in the southwest corner of the room that will take you outside to the west side of Route 207, where you can use Rock Climb to access an Iron. TM80 (Rock Slide) can be found by crossing the bridge, then taking the southernly route to reach it. A Revive can be found by taking the northern route instead. <br>  <br>  Near the very back of the cave, you'll find an opening in the wall (however, if you have not done the events in the Veilstone Galactic Building and are coming here for loot immediately after getting Rock Climb, this opening will be sealed with depictions of the Legendary Trio, similar to the gate in Celestic Town). Enter it, and then make your way up the stairs.<br>  <br>  The stairs to the right lead to a hidden Max Revive inside of the southern rock. Otherwise, just keep heading north.<br>  <br>  As you enter, you'll see a familiar sight: snow. Blinding snow. Like the Routes on your way to Snowpoint City, it is snowing at the peak of Mt. Coronet, and the weather will be Hail inside of each battle.<br>  <br>  This section sometimes confuses people, because there are lots of areas to explore on the peak and I like to cover them all, so I'm going to list here a quick-'n-easy path to take to get straight to business:<br>  <br>     1. Head east, north, use Rock Climb.<br>     2. Go west, south, a bit more west, and head north into the cave.<br>     3. Use Rock Climb and follow the path in the cave east to the exit.<br>     4. Climb down the stairs in the peak and then use Rock Climb in the chasm to climb the western rocks.<br>     5. Keep heading west until you get to a cave.<br>     6. It's straightforward from here on in, so just keep following the path and you'll get there.<br>  <br>  But, if you want to explore everything, I have the original, slow-'n-detailed version intact.<br>  <br>  Head east, then north (taking the elevated path if you wish to avoid random encounters). Use Rock Climb to climb the rocks. You can use Rock Climb again if you wish to find a patch of grass with a rock in the middle of it. Hidden in the rock is a Nugget.<br>  <br>  The cave to the right of where you used Rock Climb has a giant lake in it with a waterfall (that you'll have to explore later), as well as a PP Up and Ultra Ball hidden inside of some of the more obvious-placed rocks.<br>  <br>  Back to where you used Rock Climb the first time, head west. If you have a Pokemon with Strength, you can avoid the patches of tall grass by using it on taking the more eastern path. Otherwise, you'll need to wade through a large field of tall grass. On the southern path, hidden inside of a rock past a rock that you can use Rock Smash on is a Max Potion. Make your way north and into the cave.<br>  <br>  Inside of the cave, use Rock Climb to climb your way up to a Team Galactic Grunt. Fight him, and then continue along until you have to fight another one. On the very east side of the cave, you'll find an exit leading back outside.<br>  <br>  Head north, and then down into the crevice. There's a cave down there, as well as a few Grunts, although you won't be able to proceed deeper into the cave until Team Galactic is off of the mountain, so you can ignore that cave if you wish. (After they leave, come back to this entrance and you can snag yourself TM02 (Dragon Claw), as well as exit to the northern part of the mountain.) So, instead, use Rock Climb to get yourself up onto the western cliff. Again, if you have a Pokemon that can use Strength, you will be able to use Strength on the boulders to fight less Pokemon on your way to the west. Regardless of if you have it or not, you'll want to head to the west until you find another entrance into the mountain.<br>  <br>  Back inside, you will find a path leading to stairs. Climb the stairs, and then fight the two Grunts on the next floor. Keep going, and you'll find another flight of stairs. Upstairs, you'll find another Grunt. Fight the Grunt, and then keep going north until you reach an exit leading out.<br>  <br>  NOTE: At this point, if you don't have at least 20 Ultra Balls (or Dark Balls), you should turn back now and buy some! You will want to have them for one of the upcoming fights.<br>  <br>  You will now be on the very top of the Mt. Coronet, amidst the ancient ruins known as the Spear Pillar. Fight the two Grunts guarding the entrance in a Double Battle, and then head north a bit to see a dangerous sight... Mars, Jupiter, and Cyrus!<br>  <br>  After some intense dialogue, Cyrus will proceed to awaken Dialga (or, if you're playing Pokemon Pearl, Palkia) in the most AMAZING scene ever in the history of Pokemon games (at least, that's what I think). Save your game and heal your Pokemon, because you're about to enter a pretty challenging fight. When you're ready, step north, and Mars and Jupiter will challenge you to a fight. Just then, Rival will rush in to help you out, eager to get his revenge on Jupiter from their battle in Lake Acuity earlier.<br>  _____________________________________<br>  I wasnt sure which part of the Mt Coronet Guide you needed, so here's all of it.|`|NyDrTXFeaa	Go down the stairs and speak to your mother.

Head north <br>  to enter Route 201. Your RIVAL is waiting for you there. He will talk to you<br>  when you approach him. He will follow you now. Head west, because you cannot<br>  enter the grass without a pokemon. Follow the path west and then north to enter<br>  the lakefront.

Now you are busted. You transport<br>  back to your house and your mother will give you the running shoes. Hooray! Now<br>  the fun begins. Head north (Route 201) and east through the grass. You can gain<br>  some levels here but you cannot catch any of the pokemon yet. Follow Route 201 <br>  to Sandgem Town.

Your escort will head north a bit <br>  to Route 202 and if you try to pass, she will tell you to visit your mother.<br>  You can head south and get the Antidote and can also buy pokeballs at the mart.<br>  <br>  So, head back to your house. Talk to your mom and your RIVAL's mom will enter <br>  and give you a package to deliver. Go back to Sandgem and head north to Route <br>  202. The person in the grass will show you how to catch pokemon and give you 5<br>  free pokeballs. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Route 202<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Route 202 has your first trainer battle. Hopefully you raised your starter poke<br>  some levels to deal with the trainers. The battles aren't hard so you shouldn't<br>  have much trouble. There are some new pokes in the grass and another potion on<br>  this route.<br>  <br>  Route 202 pokes: Shinx, Bidoof, Starly, Kricketot<br>  Pokedex seen count: 5<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  1.0.3 - Jubilife City<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Route 202 leads to Jubilife Town. Your RIVAL is located at the trainer school <br>  and it has a big pokeball logo above the door. Enter the school and deliver <br>  the package to get the town map. Battle the two trainers on the right side of <br>  the school to get TM10. They both have abras which is Psychic type. This will<br>  add another pokemon to our seen count.<br>  <br>  When you leave the school, head north to be approached by a man who is doing a<br>  promotion on watches. Find the clowns, answer yes to all of them and then get a<br>  watch. There are clowns in the town and they are very easy to find.<br>  <br>  Locations: 1) Near the pokemon center, north<br>             2) In front of the TV station<br>             3) In front of the watch company, Poketch<br>  <br>  Talk to the man with your three coupons in hand and you will get the watch. <br>  Before you leave town, enter the condos and the girl on the first floor will <br>  give you the quick claw. Exit Jubilife using the west exit. Once you enter the <br>  building exit, talk to the fisherman inside to get the Old Rod. You can now <br>  catch magikarps. Who doesn't love gyarados? You cannot do anything else on<br>  Route 218 until later. Head back into Jubilife.<br>  <br>  Leave town through the northern exit.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 6<br>  <br>  ------------------------<br>  Route 204<br>  ------------------------<br>  <br>  There is a new pokemon up here, Budew. The second trainer here will show you a<br>  magikarp. The third trainer will show Budew if you didn't find one in the grass<br>  already. Enter the cave and you can find Psyduck, Geodude and Zubat. Exit the <br>  cave once you have at least found Geodude and Zubat. <br>  <br>  Head back into Jubilife when you are finished catching pokes and battling <br>  trainers. The east exit is the way to go but be ready for a battle with your <br>  RIVAL. He will have a Starly at level 7 and his starter at level 9.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 11<br>  <br>  ------------------------<br>  Route 203<br>  ------------------------<br>  <br>  Your RIVAL will show another pokemon, his starter. Quite a few trainers here. <br>  Make your way through the route getting some XP. Abra is available in the<br>  grass. If you want one, you have to throw the pokeball immediately as it will <br>  run away if you try to battle it. When you get to the end, there is a cave <br>  entrance. The trainer south of the cave entrance has a Machop for your pokedex.<br>  The cave has a couple trainers inside and also nets you an HM. It is a small <br>  cave and exits in Oreburgh City. The last trainer shows you a Psyduck if you<br>  didn't find one earlier.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 13<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  1.0.4 - Oreburgh City<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Finally, a badge city. However, the gym leader is not around. He is in the <br>  mines and you will have to go get him out. The first house in town has a dusk <br>  ball on the second floor. The 2nd house offers an Abra for a Machop which is a <br>  great way to get an Abra that will grow fast. Upstairs is a man looking to see<br>  a Zubat. You will get a TM if you bring him one. Enter the pokemon center and<br>  go down the stairs. Wi-fi is now open to you. The house below the mining museum<br>  has a great ball.<br>  <br>  The mine is located in the Southern most part of town. You can get a super<br>  potion from one of the workers east of the mine entrance. Enter the mine. Onix <br>  is the new poke available here. The mine has some trainers and a worker<br>  located between two rocks. Talk to him, he is the gym leader, and he will show<br>  you rock smash and leave. Defeat the trainers and collect the items. When done,<br>  head out and off to the gym. <br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 14<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Oreburgh Gym<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  This gym is all geodude and onix. Make sure you have a poke that can handle <br>  these two (water/grass is best). The leader has a lvl 12 of each and a lvl 14<br>  Cranidos who is very tough. It's huge attack stat will knock most of your <br>  pokes out with one hit. If you have trouble, raise your levels. Winning nets <br>  you a TM that is very similar to spikes but for a rock pokemon and your first<br>  badge!!<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 15<br>  <br>  NOTE: The GTS is now open in Jubilife which enables you to trade pokemon online<br>  without knowing friend codes. If you get a pokemon that is a much higher level<br>  than the pokes you are using, it probably will not obey you. Keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  2.0.0 - Forest Badge<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Now the quest for the 2nd badge begins. If you go north of Oreburgh, you can<br>  catch a Machop on Route 207. You can't do anything else until you have the bike<br>  so you need to go back through the tunnel to Jubilife. Once you reach Jubilife,<br>  head north for a double battle. After the battle, you will get the Fashion <br>  Case. You can now buy dress-up items to use on your pokemon inside the tv <br>  station, pointless IMO. The grunts showed some more pokes so that is nice. <br>  Enter the TV station before going on Route 204. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  TV Station<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  On the first floor, talk to the Pikachu. It will battle you and will be added<br>  to your Dex. The girl at the counter does a lottery. Bring all traded pokemon<br>  here and draw a number. If it matches, you can get a good item like a master<br>  ball. There is a turtwig mask on the second floor if you want it. Leave. Talk<br>  to the president of the poketch company. He is by the counter on the first <br>  floor of the poketch building. You get the app Memo Pad. Leave.<br>  <br>  North to Route 209.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 18<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Ravaged Path<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  You can now get through the cave with rock smash. Inside the cave, left gets<br>  you an item but dead ends and right exits the cave. Once outside, keep trekking<br>  north. The first trainer shows Cherubi. The double battle up ahead shows<br>  Pachirisu. Return here with cut to get TM78. No new pokes in the grass, TM09 is<br>  on the west side of this route. Floaroma town is just ahead.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 20<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  2.0.1 - Floaroma Town<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Flowers, flowers, flowers. The flower shop has the watering can and some<br>  berries. There is TM88 in the house next to the flower shop. Nothing else to<br>  see here, make your way east (Route 205). <br>  <br>  The bridge is impassable so keep going east. The grunt guarding the building <br>  has a lvl11 Glameow which is new to the dex. Fight the goon and he will lock<br>  himself inside the Windworks. He will also tell you about the goons in<br>  Floaroma town so you need to go back there. The grass has some new pokes, <br>  Pachirisu, Shellos and Buizel.<br>  <br>  Once you are back in Floaroma, move to the top left corner of the town and the<br>  goons will be gone. Now there is a secret entrance. Defeat the goons inside the<br>  garden to get the key from the old man. Grunt 1 will show a Silcoon. After the<br>  battle,<br>   the old man will give you some honey that can be put on the orange /<br>  brown trees. See the Appendix to find out which pokemon can only be caught this<br>  way. Once again, back to the Valley Windworks. Leave the garden with key in <br>  hand and take Route 205 east. Open the door the grunt hid behind earlier.<br>  <br>  Inside, be ready for battle. The grunts will be easy but the boss is a little <br>  tough. The first grunt you encounter has a lvl11 Cascoon for the dex. The boss<br>  is one of Team Galactics commanders. She has a lvl 14 Zubat and a lvl 16 <br>  Purugly. I ended up beating Purugly with a lvl 10 onix but I lost everything<br>  else. Use potions and defeat her. <br>  <br>  Once she is defeated, you can cross the bridge from earlier. The papa and the<br>  little girl will tell you about a special balloon poke but you cannot get that<br>  one yet so ignore it for now. Heal in Floaroma and cross the bridge.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 26<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Route 205<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  The first trainer over the bridge has a lvl14 Ponyta. There are no new pokes in<br>  the grass. There are some items here along the route but nothing fancy. There<br>  is a house near the end of the route that will heal your pokemon. Just west of<br>  the house is a trainer that has Piplup which may or may not help with your dex.<br>  Do not worry if it doesn't. The rest of the trainers can be skipped if you do<br>  not want the XP. <br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 27<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  2.0.2 - Eterna Forest<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  When you enter the forest, you get approached by someone looking for help with<br>  getting out. She will follow you and fight alongside you during your trek. One<br>  really cool thing about her following you is that after every battle, your<br>  pokemon are fully healed. The forest isn't hard to get through, just keep <br>  fighting trainers and you know you are going the right way. There are some <br>  items in the grass and also some new pokes. Going through the grass with your <br>  new friend nets two pokemon per battle as well. <br>  <br>  The first double battle shows Beautifly and Silcoon to your pokedex. The third<br>  double battle has Burmy, Kricketune and Dustox. The fourth one has a Meditite.<br>  <br>  FAST ROUTE:<br>  1) East, north, double battle, follow route to double battle.<br>  2) South, east, double battle, east, north, double battle, north, east into<br>     grass.<br>  3) North, west, north, east, EXIT.<br>  <br>  NEW Pokemon roundup: Murkrow(D), Wurmple, Silcoon(D), Cascoon(P),Beautifly(D), <br>                       Buneary, Dustox(P), Misdreavus(P)<br>  <br>  Misdreavus and Murkrow can be hard to find so if you don't, you will get to see<br>  them later in the game. Exit the forest and cross the bridge, fight the <br>  fisherman to get some lousy XP because they mostly have magikarps. From left to<br>  right, the 1st fisherman doesn't battle, the 2nd one has a goldeen for the dex,<br>  the 3rd fisherman has only Magikarp so skip him entirely and the last fisherman<br>  also has a goldeen with a bunch of Magikarp.<br>  <br>  Keep going east and you will enter Eterna City.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 36<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  2.0.3 - Eterna City<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Talk to everyone in the town and you should net a TM from an old lady, an<br>  explorer kit and HM Cut. If you head south right away there is a professor's <br>  aid that will give you EXP share. The condos have an in-game trade, Buizel for<br>  a Chatot. They also have the name rater who lets you nickname your pokemon. You<br>  cannot change the name of traded pokemon however. The old lady with TM67 is on <br>  the 2nd floor here. <br>  <br>  The explorer kit can be found in the house next to the pokemon center. Talk to<br>  the old man and he will give you the kit and also some tests he wants you to <br>  complete so you can learn how to use the kit. See the Appendix for pokemon that<br>  can be caught this way and what you can do underground. You get HM cut when you<br>  take the northern route in the city. There is a poketch app inside the pokemon<br>  center, talk to the girl near the counter to get it.<br>  <br>  The second badge is here and you do not need to do anything special to get it. <br>  Just go to the gym and fight for it. The gym in town is a grass gym so you will<br>  need a flying or fire move for it. There are a couple new pokemon available to<br>  see in the gym.<br>  <br>  When you get to the gym, the leader will be waiting for you. She will hide her <br>  trainers inside the gym and you will need to find them and defeat them to be <br>  able to battle her. Enter the main room after she goes in and start searching.<br>  Go north 90% of the way then head west. The first trainer is here. Follow the <br>  path west, then south and you will find the second trainer after the 2 rocks.<br>  Go back to the door and you can see three small trees in the top right of your <br>  screen, behind them is a trainer. To get to the last one, go back to the door<br>  and follow the first path east and then north. The trainer is in the area with<br>  the four flowers. <br>  <br>  Now you can fight the gym leader. Her highest level poke is a lvl 22 Roserade.<br>  I demolished all her pokes and everyone in the gym with a lvl19 Staravia. So<br>  long as you have a super effective move for this gym, you should breeze through<br>  it.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 38<br>  <br>  After you defeat the gym leader, you have a couple options. From here, you can <br>  head east to route 211 where there is some tall grass and a cave. This way has <br>  Ponyta, Chingling and Meditite in the grass. Inside the cave there is Cleffa <br>  but the cave dead ends until later in the game. If you can't find ponyta, give<br>  up until later one where it will be a lot more common. The two trainers you can<br>  fight along the way have nothing new.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 39 (not counting ponyta or cleffa)<br>  <br>  In the northern part of town, there are some grass trees that you can cut down.<br>  Cut them and enter the building. This is the galactic grunts building and you<br>  need to go through it in order to get the bike. You can avoid most of the <br>  trainers in here or talk to the people on the computers to get more XP. The <br>  hardest poke in here is a lvl 20 Skuntank with most of the pokes averaging lvl<br>  15 and they are mostly bugs. You get two new pokemon for the pokedex even if<br>  you skip the trainers on the computers.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 41<br>  <br>  Once you defeat all the trainers, the bike shop owner is released and you can <br>  enter the bike shop and get a bike. The bike shop is located just south of the<br>  pokemon center. You get a bike that is the mach bike and acro bike mixed<br>  together. You change between bikes by pressing the B button. Go back to where<br>  you got the exp share and now you can get past the guards as you have a bike.  <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Cycling Road<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  There are some trainers along here you can fight for some more XP. The first<br>  trainer you can battle has a Staravia for the pokedex. The third trainer has a<br>  Ponyta if you didn't catch one earlier. You will be able to catch one soon. The<br>  rest can be skipped if you so choose. At the end of cycling road is a girl who <br>  will give you an accessory. Exit cycling road and you are at Route 206, up the<br>  ledge that we couldn't go up earlier. There are two small trees that you can<br>  cut here. Cut them to gain access to some new pokemon. On route 206, you can<br>  find Bronzor, Stunky(D), Kricketune and Ponyta. This Ponyta is a lot more<br>  abundant than the one earlier. <br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 43<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  3.0.1 - Cave of Doubt<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  There is a cave at the end of Route 206 called the Cave of Doubt. You can use <br>  the TM flash to light up the cave but Bidoof cannot learn it. If you do not<br>  want to use your TM(and who would), I have the way to go here as it is quite a <br>  maze. Enter the cave and follow these directions: SMR stands for Smash the Rock<br>  <br>  1) North, SMR. <br>  2) North again, SMR.<br>  3) North, then west, SMR.<br>  *) West, South, West, South leads to two trainers and an item, TM32<br>  *) West, South, SMR, South leads to a Hiker and a dead end<br>  4) North, SMR<br>  5) North, then West, SMR<br>  *) North, West, South leads to two trainers and an item (Rare Candy)<br>  6) North, East, SMR, continue East, South, Escape Rope. <br>  7) East, South, SMR<br>  8) South, SMR, Follow path and keeping SMRs. When you get to north or south <br>     intersection, go North. You will get Mira who heals your pokes after battles<br>     South from Mira goes to two trainers. Pokemon encounters now show two pokes<br>  9) Leave with Mira. Follow directions backwards. You can go back and fight the <br>     trainers now as they will be easier with healing afterwards.<br>  <br>  I honestly do not know what saving Mira does for the main game. Since I don't,<br>  I am not going to count the above section in the Pokedex seen count.<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Route 207<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Thank god that is over, head back to where you cut the trees and go down. You<br>  are on Route 207. You can now go down the ledge and back up so long as your<br>  bike is set to fast. Down the ledge is a town so you can heal your pokes. You<br>  should be OK though since you had Mira. On your way to the town, your friend<br>  will stop you and ask you to pick a hand. It does not matter which hand you<br>  pick because you get the same item anyway, the VS SEEKER and a poketch app.<br>  You want to go East on Route 207 when you are ready. Some trainers and items<br>  throughout here or you can just skip a lot of the trainers and go to the cave.<br>  The hiker before the cave has a Bronzor if you didn't see one earlier. The cave<br>  is very short and requires no HMs. Go through the cave.<br>  <br>  Same situation as before. You can fight everyone and get items or run through <br>  this part. After the grass is the berry masters house. He will give you a<br>  berry everyday. The little girl gives you a poketch app so get that from her. <br>  The girl trainer before the house has a Combee for the pokedex. The fellow<br>  south of the house has a Mime Jr and a Bonsly. There is a Karate guy south of<br>  the house that will give you the Odd Keystone that you need to capture the<br>  pokemon Spiritomb. East arrives in Hearthome City.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 46<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  OPTIONAL FOR NOW<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Old Chateau<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Now that you have done cycling road and have the ability to use cut, you can <br>  return to the forest and cut down the trees near the exit. There is an Old <br>  Chateau here. Now is your chance to get a Gastly. Inside here lies TM90 and<br>  some items. It is not worth checking this place out unless you really want a<br>  Gastly or TM90.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  3.0.2 - Hearthome City<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Do like you always do when you enter a town. Talk to everyone and get stuff.<br>  The Shell Bell is available on the second floor of the house right next to the<br>  Fan Club. The Poffin Case is given to you by the Fan Club president. You need<br>  this to evolve a pokemon like Feebas. The hiker in the Southeat corner of town<br>  has an egg for you. To hatch an egg, carry the egg with you and walk a certain<br>  amount of steps with the egg. It will hatch when you reach the right amount of<br>  steps. It is usually somewhere between 3,000 and 7,000 steps and depends on the<br>  pokemon.<br>  <br>  Ensure your pokemon are healed because you are going to have to battle your<br>  RIVAL in the town. After you battle, the Southeast exit opens up. There is no<br>  gym battle here but you can talk to the gym leader outside the contest hall.<br>  You need to do this in order to get your RIVAL to battle you. Enter the contest<br>  hall after the gym leader moves and talk to your mom. You can leave now and you<br>  will be able to battle.<br>  <br>  In the Northeast and Northwest corner of the city is a cute pokemon stroll <br>  area. Only certain pokemon are permitted here and it has some TMs and other <br>  useful items in it. The Southeast corner exit leads to Route 209 and you can <br>  get a Good Rod from the fisherman here. The Southwest exit is still blocked by <br>  the TV reporter. Go to Route 209. Your RIVAL has evolved his starter and you<br>  should have evolved yours by now as well.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 48<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Route 209<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  More same old pokemon formula here. Walk through the route collecting items and<br>  battling trainers. The Pikachu is actually a trainer you can battle. The first<br>  trainer you encounter has a Pichu for the pokedex. You can now fish for better<br>  fish with the Good Rod here. Place the Odd Keystone inside the large rock and<br>  it turns into the Hallowed Tower. This serves no purpose until you have talked<br>  to 32 people in the underground, more on that later. The girl trainer west of<br>  the Tower has a Cleffa if you missed it earlier. Route 209 leads to Solaceon<br>  Town and the Lost Tower.<br>  <br>  NEW pokemon round up: Chansey, Mime JR, Bibarel, Good Rod pokes<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 51 (with Chansey)<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  The Lost Tower<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  The Lost Tower is a tower of pokemon graves. You can be attacked while walking<br>  around the tower. There are some more trainers and items scattered here. The<br>  first trainer has a Stunky(D) which is good for Pearl players. There are some<br>  Gastly here if you didn't go back to Old chateau. On the third floor, there is<br>  a double battle you can skip, don't. The trainers have Misdreavus and Murkow so<br>  that is good for both Diamond and Pearl players. You get the cleanse tag and HM<br>  Strength at the top of the tower. Leave.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 55<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  3.0.3 - Solaceon Town<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  To the Pokemon Center to heal. Everyone around town is wearing a hat. Talk to <br>  everyone in town to get some new items. The first cowboy you see gives you a<br>  poketch app. The furthest house east has the seal case for you. If you bring <br>  the newspaper guy what he wants, he will give you an item. Nothing spectacular.<br>  <br>  We have finally reached the Day Care! You can breed two pokemon by putting a<br>  male and female from the same egg group into the day care. Once you have put<br>  two pokemon in the day care, the man inside will give you a poketch app. The<br>  day care is also good for raising pokemon you don't want to battle with. Every<br>  step you take is 1 XP for a day care pokemon. Talk to the day care man outside<br>  when you have two pokemon in the day care to see how long an egg will take to<br>  arrive. If the old man says, "The two prefer to play with other pokemon" then<br>  you will never get an egg. No gym here, darn. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Solaceon Ruins<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Located in the east side of town in a cave. The ruins has Unown and trainers. <br>  Press A on the rocks to get items. It doesn't work for all of the rocks though.<br>  There is only one right way to go through the ruins. When you first enter the <br>  ruins, there is text on the wall and it is directions on how to get to through<br>  the maze.<br>  <br>  "Top Right, Lower Left, Top Right, Top left, Top Left, Lower Left."<br>  <br>  When you get to the room with the 4 pokeballs, there is text on the wall. It is<br>  written in Unown and it possibly says:<br>  <br>  "Friendship all lives touch other lives to create something anew and alive."<br>  Leave the ruins once you have everything. Go north of town to Route 210. <br>  <br>  Unown are all different letters but only count as 1 entry in the pokedex.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 56<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Route 210<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  The first trainer in the tall grass has an Aipom and a Girafarig for the dex.<br>  You get TM51 along the way here but you have to talk a the girl on the right<br>  side of the route to get it. The second double battle has a Clefairy for the<br>  pokedex. The trainer north of the second double battle has a Happiny so if you<br>  dont want to hatch the egg from the hiker, battle him or the girl at the end of<br>  the tall grass.<br>  <br>  As you travel, you will find the Milk store and lots of people inside. If you<br>  talk to them, most of them will engage in battle. You can battle the two<br>  trainers at the same table for Sudowoodo and Mr. Mime. You cannot get past the<br>  Psyducks right now so go east to Route 215.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 62<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Route 215<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  More trainers and more pokes. You can catch a Kadabra in the grass. Keep going<br>  and you will reach Veilstone City. The first trainer battle has a Shieldon<br>  which we haven't seen yet. TM66 is available from a Karate guy. The 2nd Karate<br>  guy has a Croagunk and the third one is right next to a Fist Plate but has no<br>  new pokemon. TM43 is available by way of cut along the route. The double battle<br>  at the end of the route has a Monferno so that may or may not help you but the<br>  Gyarados should.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 65<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  3.0.4 - Veilstone City<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Enter town, walk around, talk to everyone. Dawn is outside the gym as well as<br>  an old man who will give you TM63. There is a house with a girl who massages <br>  your pokemon once a day and gives you an accessory afterwards. Next to her<br>  is a house with a jester in it. Just keep picking the same hand over and over<br>  and eventually you will win. You get a coin case. You can get the coins from<br>  the Game Corner now and exchange them for FABULOUS PRIZES!!! WOOOT!<br>  <br>  Ultra Balls and Great balls are finally available at the Department Store First<br>  Floor. There is also a new Poketch app in here and lots of TMs for sale. The<br>  Sticky Barb hold item is located on the roof. The app is on the second floor<br>  and you have to talk to the girl behind the counter to get it.<br>  <br>  Now we can get another badge. The gym is not too hard. Machokes and Meditites<br>  at lvl 25 and 26 until you get to the gym leader, Flying/Psychic is best. This<br>  was another gym where I could own with Staravia. The gym leader has a lvl 30 <br>  Lucario that is fighting/steel so psychic will do normal damage. You get the<br>  ability to use HM fly outside which is good because it is in the galactic <br>  warehouse. If you get stuck, try to line up all the gaps in the boards with the<br>  stairs. Walk outside of the gym to have Dawn ask you for help. Defeat the <br>  thugs, enter the warehouse and Fly is in plain sight.<br>  <br>  Fly to Hearthome and you can now leave through the Southwest exit of the town.<br>  When you exit, you will be on Route 212.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 67<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Route 212<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  This route has a honey tree you can smear which is good since it is so close <br>  to town. There are also some police patrolling here. TM11 is here but requires<br>  cut, some other items as well that require surf. There is the Pokemon Mansion<br>  here as well.<br>  <br>  The first double battle has a Chatot you want to see for the pokedex. You can<br>  acquire one by utilizing the in-game trade mentioned earlier in the guide. The<br>  double battle before the Pokemon Mansion has a Buneary. <br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 69<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Pokemon Mansion<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  If you enter the mansion and go left, there is a Great Ball, Soothe Bell and a<br>  Burn heal in the trash can. If you go right, TM Swagger is in the office. Go<br>  to the garden to catch some new pokes. Roselia and Pikachu are available here<br>  as well as Pichu.<br>  <br>  After you are done, back to Route 212.<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Route 212<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Head south out of the Mansion through the grass. No new pokes here but there<br>  are Wooper in the rainy grass coming up. There are some trainers along here<br>  that average lvl20. There is a girl in a house here who will trade shards for<br>  TMs. You can get shards in the underground. The first double battle in the<br>  rainy area has a Prinplup which, again, may or may not help you. It helped me<br>  so I am going to include it in the count. You will catch up soon if it didn't<br>  help you.<br>  <br>  The first fisherman has Barboach, the 2nd one has nothing new and the third<br>  fisherman has a Gyarados. The bog here is kind of a pain. You cannot use your<br>  bike on the bog. When you fall into the bog, just keep trying to move and<br>  eventually you will. At the end of the bog is TM06 so you want to be sure to<br>  get that. You can skip the bike path if you want. There are two trainers and a<br>  zinc at the end of it. Route 212 leads to Pastoria City.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 72<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  4.0.0 - Pastoria City<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  The first house is a berry lady house who will give you a berry everyday. The<br>  pokemon move tutor is here as well as the Safari Zone. The move tutor is very<br>  helpful if you transfer a lot of pokes from pal park or if you want to get a<br>  move back that you deleted. The move tutor will ask for a heart scale and you<br>  can get them in the underground. The gym in town is all water pokemon with <br>  hardly any barboach so you can do just fine with electric type attacks. The<br>  highest level pokemon in here is a lvl 30 Floatzel. You gain the Fen badge and<br>  the ability to use the HM you get in the Safari Zone outside. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Safari Zone<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  The first guy on the right when you enter the Safari Zone gives you HM05. The <br>  Safari Zone has two new pokes and the best way to get them, is to use the<br>  binoculars on the 2nd floor to see where they are. Go to the area that they<br>  show up in and stand in the grass. Move the character around but don't actually<br>  take a step. You will get encounters without increasing your step count. So <br>  long as you do not run out of balls you can stay forever. I am not going to<br>  count the Safari Zone in the seen count. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Pastoria City<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  You should always battle all the trainers in a gym because they show you new<br>  pokemon and give you more XP. After you beat the gym, talk to the Grunt in the<br>  northern most part of town. He will run off and he tells you not to follow him,<br>  you should. Your rival will show up when you try to follow the grunt so be<br>  ready for a battle. The gym had Azurill, Marill, Wingull and Floatzel.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 76 (Halfway there!)<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  5.0.0 - Route 213<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Follow the route fighting trainers. Everytime you see the grunt, talk to him<br>  and make him run off again. Floatzel and Wingull are new pokes in the grass.<br>  There is a man on the route who will give you a footprint ribbon for your <br>  lead pokemon. The first fisherman has a Remoraid and the second one doesn't<br>  battle.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 77<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Hotel<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  The hotel area has a lot of trainers you can battle, mostly in the restaurant.<br>  Lots of double battles in here and you get a lot of money afterwards. The pokes<br>  average lvl 20-23. The hotel clerk at the front desk will heal your pokes for <br>  you. There is a TM available on the hotel property as well. You will find the <br>  grunt here and he will finally battle you. He has a lvl 25 Glameow. Follow him<br>  again and Cynthia will meet you and give you a potion to remove the psyducks<br>  from Route 210. Continue heading north on Route 214 and take the eastern path.<br>  There is a girl trainer along the way who has a Haunter. The girl right after<br>  her, has a Wormadon. <br>  <br>  You can keep heading North to find a cave on the east path that has a man<br>  asking you to catch Unowns. If you catch all 26 types of Unowns, one for each<br>  letter of the alphabet, the ruin maniac finishes the cave. The cave then leads<br>  to another area that has two more unowns. The two extra unowns are the question<br>  mark and the exclamation point.  If you keep walking around the cave, you will<br>  eventually get attacked by a rare Hippopotas. In 25 attacks, I got 24 geodudes<br>  and 1 hippo. I have been told the more unowns you catch, the higher the<br>  encounter rate for Hippopotas. Eventually, you will end up in Veilstone City.<br>  If you do not care about catching Hippopotas, fly to Solaceon right away. If<br>  you go to Veilstone, take Route 215 West to the Psyducks.<br>  <br>  New Poke Round-Up: Hippopotas, Graveler<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 79 (not counting Hippopotas and Graveler)<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  5.0.1 - Route 210<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Once you reach the Psyduck, heal them with the secret potion. Afterwards,<br>  Cynthia will show and ask you to deliver an Old Charm to someone in Celestic<br>  Town. As you travel along the route, a thick fog will show up blocking your<br>  view. Use HM05 Defog to remove the fog. There are some lvl25-27 trainers here.<br>  Follow route 210 until you reach Celestic Town. <br>  <br>  There are three ninja trainers hidden in the tall grass. The one hidden on the<br>  east side of the tall grass has a Skorupi. The rest have pokemon we have<br>  already seen. The ninja boy above the karate man after you use Defog has a<br>  Golbat. There is a girl trainer along the route that has a Grotle. Keep<br>  following the path and you will keep getting in battles. You see Mothim, Luxio<br>  and Raichu before you end up at a bike path. The bike path leads to TM30 and a<br>  trainer.<br>  <br>  After you get the TM, head back onto the normal route. After the karate guy,<br>  you can go right for a battle and an item or left. The item is the Smoke Ball<br>  and it lets you run from any wild encounter. East dead ends so turn around and<br>  head west. The first trainer this way has a Hoothoot and its evolved form,<br>  Noctowl. That is two more for the pokedex. Take the bridge and you will be<br>  stopped by an old man for a battle. He has nothing new but you cannot avoid the<br>  battle. Celestic town is just ahead. <br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 85<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  5.0.2 - Celestic Town<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  You can net a poketch app and a great ball by talking to the residents of this<br>  town. The Great Ball is in the pokemon center and the app is in the house in<br>  the southwest corner of town. <br>  <br>  A galactic grunt is blocking the cave and he needs to be disposed of. He<br>  has a lvl25 beautifly and a lvl27 Croagunk. After you defeat him, the old <br>  woman will come up to you and thank you. Enter the cave and press A on the <br>  pictures of the pokemon on the wall. The old woman will enter again and give<br>  you HM03 Surf.<br>  <br>  Now the gym in Hearthome is open! You can fly there now or you can go west to<br>  Route 211 and get a TM and fight some trainers for XP. No new pokes that way<br>  though. The TM is Psych Up.<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  5.0.3 - Hearthome Revisited<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  The gym here is all Ghost which means a dark pokemon will own it. The puzzles<br>  are ridiculously easy but you should go in the wrong doors on purpose to get<br>  more battles in before the leader. A lot of the trainers in here have Drifloon<br>  who does a lot of damage to you after a physical attack is done to it. Be sure<br>  to fight the girl on the 2nd floor, far right door before you go straight to<br>  the gym leader.<br>  <br>  The boss has:<br>  Lvl 32 Drifblim<br>  Lvl 36 Mismagius<br>  Lvl 34 Gengar<br>  <br>  You get TM65, a new badge and the ability to use Surf outside. This opens up a<br>  lot of pathways that you could not utilize before. You should take some time<br>  and travel to these places:<br>  <br>  Route 209 has TM19<br>  Route 204 and the cave here<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 89<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  6.0.0 - Canalave City<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Fly to Jubilife City and head west. You can surf near the fisherman that gave<br>  you the old rod. Keep heading west and there are 2 fisherman here you can <br>  battle. There is a lot of new pokemon this way. The sailor when you reach land<br>  has a Mantyke. The grass along the way has Gastrodons, Mr. Mimes and Glameows<br>  (P) in it and when you are surfing, you will be attacked by Pelipper. When you<br>  arrive at the city entrance, you will get a new app for your poketch. <br>  <br>  The move deleter is here as well as TM48. Be ready for a battle so straight to<br>  the pokemon center as your RIVAL will catch up to you soon enough. Your RIVAL's<br>  team is up in the lower 30s now and his main pokemon is at lvl35. Cross the<br>  bridge to have your RIVAL challenge you. Your RIVAL has a lvl30 Heracross which<br>  is new and it has a high attack stat. <br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 93 (not counting Mr. Mime)<br>  <br>  After the battle, head south once you cross the bridge and there is a sailor<br>  near a boat. You can take this boat to IRON ISLAND. For now, surf south on the <br>  water and you will find TM89. Take the boat to IRON ISLAND for a rare pokemon.<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  IRON ISLAND<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Iron Island is the home of a very rare pokemon. You get the pokemon in egg form<br>  so you are going to need an empty spot in your party. No HMs are needed so<br>  that opens up your HM slave spot. Exit the boat and go up the stairs into the <br>  cave.<br>  <br>  Steelix and Golbat are new here. You can get some good XP inside the cave. You <br>  will be attacked by a lot of Graveler and that is new to the pokedex. Ice and<br>  water attacks will help throughout the cave. There are quite a few trainers and<br>  items here.<br>  <br>  Fast Route: <br>  1) Go down the east set of stairs.<br>  2) Up stairs, east, down stairs, south, up east set of stairs, down elevator.<br>  3) Go down west set of stairs, get partner.<br>  4) Take first path south, fight trainers, south, stay on path, up stairs, south<br>     fight trainers, down stairs, up stairs, down elevator.<br>  5) This gets you the Riolu egg. Go through cave door, up elevator, out cave.<br>  <br>  Cherrim is found in step 2 in a trainer battle. Medicham is found in step 4.<br>  You should see Steelix at some point throughout the cave as well. If you miss<br>  Steelix, it will be in the gym so do not worry about it.<br>  <br>  Riolu turns into the pokemon your partner was using in the cave. <br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 97<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Canalave Gym<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  This gym is mostly steel and rock pokemon. Surf takes care of a lot of the<br>  enemies so you should probably have a poke that can do it well. One of the<br>  trainers before the boss has a Azuremarill<br>  <br>  The boss has a<br>  lvl39 Bastiodon. The Bastiodon can be a pain but luckily for me, it did not use<br>  Rest. It may use it against you so be ready for it. It is a rock/steel pokemon<br>  so ground moves will really hurt it. Winning nets you the Mind badge and the <br>  ability to use Strength outside. <br>  <br>  Strength will let you move the gray boulders around. Evolve your bidoof to be <br>  able to teach it Strength if you have been using one. Now you want to hit the <br>  caves. There is a cave near Oreburgh that will give you a TM and a cave near<br>  Celestic Town. <br>  <br>  After you have beaten the gym, your RIVAL will talk to you again. Go inside the<br>  library and meet him on the 3rd floor. The library is in the northwest corner<br>  of the city. Your mission if you choose to accept it, is to go to Valor<br>  Lakefront and enter where the two guards would not let you pass before.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 99 <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  6.0.0 - Valor Lakefront<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Walk through the magikarps fighting trainers until you get to the cave. Enter<br>  the cave and be ready for a battle. The highest lvl poke in here is a lvl37 <br>  Toxicroak. It is fighting so flying works well. Afer you defeat him, fly to<br>  Twinleaf town.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 100<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Twinleaf Town<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Go north and then west to where you first got your pokemon. The lake is now<br>  filled with grunts so take them out. Another battle with Mars awaits and she<br>  still has her Purugly. The double battles before show no new pokemon. One lake<br>  left, fly to Celestic Town.<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  6.0.1 - Celestic Cave<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Head West of Celestic Town and enter the cave. Part of the cave is foggy but<br>  you do not need fog clear unless you want to get Light Clay. Otherwise, your<br>  new HM and rock smash should do just fine. Enter the cave and start heading<br>  north. you need to move the boulder. Follow the path north and then west.<br>  <br>  The fog room is coming up and you can use fog clear or you can make your way<br>  through the fog without it. Run from the battles as you will have a lot lower<br>  accuracy with the fog. Stay to the left if you just want to run through the <br>  area. Take the stairs and you will be in the room with the exit, no obstacles<br>  here. Exit the cave.<br>  <br>  NEW poke round-up: Clefairy<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Route 216<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Snowing here turns into hail in your battles. I didn't have an ICE pokemon so<br>  this was frustrating.  If you take the high road, a girl trainer along the way<br>  has a Lopunny. The low road has an Ambipom and grass with new pokes. Follow the<br>  path until you get to a house and fight all the trainers. Each of the trainers<br>  will show you a new pokemon. You can heal your pokes inside the house by taking<br>  a nap in the bed. After the house, go North to Route 217. The first girl in the<br>  grass after the house has a Mr. Mime if you missed it earlier.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 105<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Route 217<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  The snow really starts coming down here. You fall down into heavy snow and<br>  barely move but just keep trudging along. The first trainer you battle has a<br>  Hippopotas which is good if you didn't search the cave for it. <br>  <br>  Stay close to the west wall until<br>  you get to a house. Grab the pokeball behind the house and it is HM06. Enter<br>  the house and talk to the Hiker to get an item. Back outside, The northeast<br>  corner of the route has some grass and another house. The spell tag is inside<br>  that house and in the grass are Snover, Sneasel and Medicham. The exit to the<br>  route is north of the Hiker's house. There is a trainer battle you can't avoid<br>  and he has a Seaking.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 107<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  6.0.1 - Snowpoint City<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  You first come across Acuity Lakefront but the Galactic Grunts are keeping you<br>  out. Head east from here through the grass. You will end up in Snowpoint City.<br>  This city is pretty much just a gym city. Walk around and talk to everyone and<br>  then take on the gym. You may get stuck in the gym for a few minutes. <br>  <br>  The gym has snowballs inside. You can slam into the snowballs and break them. <br>  However, if you touch stairs while you are heading towards the snowball, you<br>  will slow down too much to break the snowball. This is very similar to the<br>  Zelda ice puzzles in Twilight Princess except instead of pushing blocks, you<br>  are using youself. You need to break all the snowballs in the very middle and<br>  and the ones that are blocking the stairs to the gym leader. If you see a <br>  snowball can only be hit from the east or west and the east path has stairs, <br>  then you know you HAVE to hit it from the west. <br>  <br>  The leader has pokes ranging from lvl38-42. The Abomasnow is new and is tough.<br>  Steel and Fire will do best in this gym and the leader is no exception. Win and<br>  get the ability to use Rock Climb outside of battle and TM72. If you fought all<br>  the trainers before the gym leader you got Tentacruel, if not, it will show up<br>  again later.<br>  <br>  Rock Climb is useful, like surf, in getting places you couldn't before. I am<br>  sure you have seen the parts around Sinnoh that can be scaled. You can choose<br>  to go scale these places and gain items and TMs or you can continue the<br>  adventure.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 109<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Acuity Lakefront<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Now that the gym is beaten, you can enter the lakefront, do that. No battles<br>  here just more story. They tell you not to go to galactic HQ but that is<br>  exactly where we are going. Fly to Veilstone.<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  7.0.0 - Galactic End<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Go to HQ and not the warehouse, outside of HQ, there is a grunt you can talk to<br>  who will run off and leave a key. Pick up the key and head to the warehouse. <br>  You can open the first door in the warehouse but they key will break inside<br>  the lock. Better find another key then...<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  7.0.1 - Galactic Warehouse<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Not a very difficult area to scale, there is a bed inside the warehouse you can<br>  use to heal your pokes. You are looking for the galactic key inside the <br>  warehouse. Once you find the key, you can now get more access inside HQ. When<br>  you go down the stairs, you can go North or East. North leads to the door we<br>  need the key for so go East. Keep following East and there will be a couple<br>  trainer battles and you will have to go up two sets of stairs. Eventually you<br>  reach two warp panels.<br>  <br>  The east panel leads to a TM so take that one real quick. Then go back through<br>  and take the west warp panel. Follow the path and you end up in a room with a<br>  set of stairs in the east and a warp panel in the western part of the room. The<br>  trainer in this room has 3 bug pokemon. Take the warp and follow it and you<br>  will have to fight a scientist. This way leads to the key. Once you have the<br>  key, go back to the room you took the warp previously and take the stairs this<br>  time if you want TM21. If you do not want the TM, then just leave the warehouse<br>  and go next door to HQ.<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  7.0.2 - Galactic HQ<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  The goal here is to get to the end and fight the boss. It is pretty straight<br>  forward. You can go slightly off the beaten path for items but you do not get <br>  far. At the end, you fight the galactic boss and get a masterball. The boss<br>  has 2 pokes weak to electric and 1 Sneasel which is dark/ice. They are between<br>  lvl40 and lvl43.  Once you beat him, he tells you to go east. You will end up<br>  in another room now. There is another battle up ahead but it is easier than the<br>  one you just had. <br>  <br>  The Galactic Admin has a Kadabra, Bronzor and Toxicroak. They are lvl38 and 40.<br>  Once you defeat her, she will move out of the way and you can press the red<br>  button. This lets three legendary pokemon free.<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  7.0.3 - Mt. Coronet<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  To get to Mt. Coronet, you are going to need your HM slave with strength. Fly<br>  to Hearthome city and head west, Route 208. Enter the cave and once inside, you<br>  will need to go north. At the very top of Mt. Coronet is Dialga so be ready for<br>  a legendary battle. Bring about 30 Ultra Balls,4 Quick Balls and 6 Timer balls.<br>  Dialga will be lvl47 and is a steel/dragon type. If you are playing Pearl, you<br>  will not get Dialga but instead will see Palkia. Palkia is a lvl47 water / <br>  dragon type. <br>  <br>  When you first enter the cave, you need to head west to the opposite side. Once<br>  you reach the west entrance, head north and surf across the pond. Use rock<br>  climb to reach the stairs up. You should seen Bronzong somewhere along the way.<br>  It is the evolved form of Bronzor and is new to the pokedex. In the next room:<br>  <br>  North, West, South, Upstairs, North, West over bridge, down stairs, up north<br>  stairs,up stairs, cross bridge, down stairs, down stairs, upstairs and in cave<br>  door. <br>  <br>  Next room: Up stairs, up stairs<br>  Next room: up stairs, trainer battle, west, south, trainer battle, Out.<br>  <br>  Now you are outside. Follow the path and use rock climb when you get there. Now<br>  instead of using rock climb again, head west and through the grass until you<br>  reach another cave. Inside, use rock climb, follow the path, down the stairs<br>  then east out of the cave.<br>  <br>  Outside again. Through the grass, down the stairs, rock climb west. Down the <br>  stairs, through the grass, keep going west and you find another cave. Enter.<br>  There is only one way to go through here so keep following the path, eventually<br>  you emerge at the very top. Inside the cave, there is also Chimecho.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 111<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Spear Pillar<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Ok, 2 galactic battles and 1 legendary pokemon coming up. You can't avoid the <br>  double battle so you need to try and reach the boss. They will converge on you<br>  but your RIVAL will show up and help. The big boys here are Purugly lvl 45 and<br>  Skuntank lvl46. Once you defeat them, you rival heals your pokes for the boss<br>  battle.<br>  <br>  The boss fight is going to go pretty similar to the way it was last time. He<br>  has upped his levels some and has a new Gyarados. Whatever worked last time is<br>  still going to work this time so as long as you gained some levels, you should<br>  be fine. He has some evolved pokemon you haven't seen before so that will help<br>  out with the pokedex. Defeat him and get access to Dialga / Palkia. SAVE!! You<br>  only get one chance at legendaries so if you knock them out, you will never be<br>  able to catch them again.<br>  <br>  The best way to catch legendaries is to use a pokemon that has stat upping<br>  moves and just sit there with it out taking damage. For example, anything that<br>  is rock/steel and has iron defense would work really well here. Get Dialga in<br>  the red, use potions when you get low, throw lots of pokeballs. Throw the 4<br>  quick balls right away and hope for the best, probably not going to work though<br>  Use Ultra Balls when Dialga gets in the red and make the battle last a long<br>  time. If you go through your ultra balls and you still do not have it, now you<br>  move onto your timer balls. If by some miracle you still do not have Dialga<br>  and you are out of timer balls, restart. <br>  <br>  Palkia is pretty much the same as Dialga except it is a water type so rock<br>  would be a bad choice to go up against it. I would suggest you use a water<br>  type. Palkia does not have have a powerhouse attack like Dialga's Roar of Time.<br>  <br>  After the battle, head north to get a special item for your new legendary.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 116<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  7.0.4 - Legendary Round-Up<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Three legendary pokemon have been unleashed now that you have helped Dialga. We<br>  need to go back to all three lakes and at each one is a legendary pokemon. <br>  <br>  Lake Valor - Azelf<br>  Lake Acuity - Uxie<br>  Lake Verity - Mesprit (runs away)<br>  <br>  The first two can be battled in the lake. Surf to the cave and battle them. All<br>  the pokes are lvl 50 and Psychic. Use the same tactic as you did on Dialga and<br>  it should go pretty smoothly. You can use the dusk ball now and it has a 4x <br>  capture rate on pokes in caves. I used Luxray with charge to keep raising my<br>  special D since they are psychic types. When you try and fight Mesprit, it runs<br>  away and shows up on your poketch marking map. If you do not have this yet, go <br>  to Jubilife City and get it from the poketch company. Talk to the president <br>  near the front desk to get it. Keep talking to him and you will get two more if<br>  you didn't have the marking map. If you want to take a break from trying to<br>  catch the legendaries, you can skip to section 7.0.5<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Catching Mesprit<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Mesprit gets it's own section because it is quite a pain in the butt to get. It<br>  shows up on the map as a flashing symbol but every time you fly to it, it moves<br>  somewhere else. Also, it runs away in battle so you are going to need mean look<br>  or use your masterball. The problem with the masterball is that there is<br>  another pokemon later on that runs away so you might want to use it on that one<br>  I suggest Crobat with Mean Look to stop it from running away. But first, we<br>  need to encounter it...Here is a trick I figured out that helps battle it.<br>  <br>  1) Go to a main city that it goes near (Jubilife works fine).<br>  2) Park yourself near the exit of the town and look in the top left corner of<br>     your screen.<br>  3) Walk out of the town and when the top left shows the route name, that makes<br>     Mesprit change it's location.<br>  4) Walk back into the town and it changes again. <br>  5) Keep doing this over and over until Mesprit shows up on the Route you are on<br>  <br>  Once it is on your route, search the grass for a battle. It may not be the<br>  first battle you encounter but it will show up eventually. Good luck! Mesprit<br>  shows up in your pokedex as seen when it shows you the picture.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 119<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  7.0.5 - Sunyshore City<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  We can get here now. Fly to Veilstone City and head south to the hotel on Route<br>  214. When you reach Valor Lakefront, the path east is now open. East leads to<br>  Route 222. This is the way to Sunyshore. Follow the path, battle trainers, get<br>  items and eventually you end up in Sunyshore. The third fisherman has a<br>  Finneon and a Feebas so be sure to battle him.<br>  <br>  Enter the town and you get inspiration to battle the gym leader. If you go to<br>  the gym though, it is blocked. You need to go to the lighthouse and talk to<br>  the gym leader and he will return to the gym. Once he returns, you will be<br>  able to enter the electric type gym. Do not forget to talk with everyone in<br>  town to get items. Note the woman near the shore because you will need to talk<br>  to her again after you defeat the gym.<br>  <br>  Hopefully you have some sort of ground/rock pokemon that has ground moves. If<br>  not, any ground type move should work. The battles before the boss change it up<br>  as there are some other pokes thrown in that aren't electric including Mr. Mime<br>  and Bibarel (to name a few). The boss has lvl46-49. He has 2 electrics, 1 water<br>  and 1 normal Ambipom. Rock/Ground wins them all except the water pokemon, a<br>  lvl47 Octillery. <br>  <br>  We finally have all 8 badges and can gain access to the E4. You need waterfall<br>  and to get it, head to the northeast section of town and talk to the girl on<br>  the beach again. She will give you HM Waterfall now that you have beat the gym.<br>  Your starter should have evolved by now so I am adding it to the count. You<br>  should also consider taking the egg you got from Iron Island with you now as<br>  you are going to need to hatch it to get the national dex.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 124<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  7.0.6 - Fuego Ironworks<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Now is a real good time to visit this place. It is hidden pretty well so to get<br>  here, fly to Floaroma town and head east out of town. At the first bridge you<br>  get to, surf west and follow the water. Eventually you will reach this area.<br>  You should see a Tentacool on your swim and we needed that for the pokedex. All<br>  the trainers in here are going to have pokemon about 10-15 levels lower than<br>  yours but that is fine because there really is no reason to rush to get here.<br>  This area has a lot of the tiles that move your character along so it really is<br>  just trial and error to get where you want.<br>  <br>  There are two fire stones in here which you may need to evolve one of your<br>  pokemon. The trainer east of the entrance has a Rapidash so you want to fight<br>  him. There is also Rock Incense and TM35. There is nothing else to do here so<br>  fly back to Sunyshore City.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 126<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  8.0.0 - Route 224<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Once you have waterfall, surf north on the route. There is a trainer here that <br>  has a Finneon evolution so you are going to want to fight the swimmer so it is<br>  in your dex. Just keep heading north if you want to skip the items. There<br>  aren't many here but there is TM18. You can catch Mantyke along the way. The<br>  third swimmer on the route has a Mantyke and a Mantine so you should battle<br>  him. At the very end of the route is a big waterfall. Use your new HM here and<br>  you will be taken to Victory Road entrance and a pokemon center. <br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 128<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  8.0.1 - Victory Road<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Lots of trainers, lots of items and lots of time, this cave is very large. The <br>  pokes in here are in the lower 50s. There are no new pokes except during<br>  trainer battles. You should battle as much as possible as you will need the<br>  levels. The pokemon league is right after the cave.<br>  <br>  Route:<br>  1) Cross bridge, cross bridge, cross bridge, Rock climb, west, up stairs, north<br>     trainer battle (Blissey), up stairs, up stairs.<br>  <br>  2) Smash the south rock, head south. Use strength. Move northeast boulder down,<br>     move north boulder west and last boulder south 2x. Head west, trainer battle<br>     (Carnivine and Rampardos).<br>  <br>  3) Move west most boulder down once. Run around and smash rock. Move boulder <br>     again north 2x. East, follow path. Smash the rock, trainer battle (Clefable<br>     and Torterra). Move northern most boulder east, head north, trainer battle,<br>     (Staraptor and Hippowdon), down stairs.<br>  <br>  4) Cross bridge, rock climb, west, north, follow path, trainer battle (Machamp)<br>     down stairs.<br>  <br>  5) Down stairs, down stairs, surf east, surf north, waterfall, follow water <br>     path, trainer battle (Gabite), surf again, follow water path, up stairs.<br>  <br>  6) West, take first path south, trainer battle (Golem and Empoleon), south, <br>     east, rock climb, north, trainer battle (Gible), north, cave exit. <br>  <br>  You made it to the pokemon league. That is the very quick way through. You can <br>  search around the cave and find all the items and gain XP for the E4.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 140<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  8.0.2 - Elite Four<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Dun dun dun! We are here. The final battles to mark you as champion. There is a<br>  pokemon center here as well as a mart. The game gives you tons of money<br>  especially if you fought everyone and reset when you lose. Buy lots of potions<br>  and revives. The best items are Full Restore, Hyper Potion and Revive. I bought<br>  30 of each and used just about all of them. My levels were far too low for the<br>  E4 but my dragon dancing gyarados did a number on them. I will recap each <br>  person so you can be ready for them. Your RIVAL thinks he is better than you<br>  so he will make you fight him first. Dispose of him. Onto the E4! Remember:<br>  Use your potions. You don't need extras after the fights so use them if you got<br>  them. Hopefully your Riolu egg hatched by now as you need it for the dex.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 142 (with Riolu egg)<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  E4 Aaron - Bug<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Aaron is a bug guy so fire/flying works well. They range from lvl 53 to lvl 57.<br>  Heracross is 4x weak to flying and the only one that isn't weak to flying is <br>  the LVL57 Drapion. It is dark/poison so psychic will not work out either. Use <br>  fighting/ground against him if you got it. <br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 145<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  E4 Bertha - Rock/Ground<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Bertha has pokes between lvl55 and lvl59. All her pokes are weak to water save<br>  Quagsire. It will double team and use sandstorm. Water will raise it's HP so do<br>  not use a water attack against it. She isn't hard at all if you took Prinplup.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 146<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  E4 Flint - Fire<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Flint is not all fire and it even has an onix. Water still does well here<br>  against 3 of the 5 pokes. They range from lvl57 to lvl61. He isn't hard but be<br>  careful of Lopunny as it knows mirror coat. Mirror coat will hurt special <br>  attackers so use physical attacks. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  E4 Lucian - Psychic<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Hopefully, you took my hints and have a Gyarados by now but if not, any dark <br>  type will do. All his pokes are psychic so dark hurts them. Bronzong has steel<br>  though so it will not be super effective. Gyarados will die quick against Mr.<br>  Mime if he cannot strike first as Mime knows thunderbolt. His pokes are lvl59<br>  to lvl60. The champion awaits...<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 147<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Champion Battle<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  She has a lvl66 garchomp and all her pokes are lvl60 or greater. Spiritomb is<br>  probably new to you and it is like sableye, it has no weakness. Garchomp will<br>  fall to ICE (guess who knows ice? Gyarados!). I didn't have much trouble with<br>  her, I used Dragon Dance a few times with Gyarados and swept everyone else in<br>  one hit. Milotic will take an electric attack as it regenerates HP and has a<br>  good special D. Do not inflict it with any kind of status problem as it's<br>  ability will make it stronger. Grass will work well too against Milotic. <br>  <br>  Beat her and get in the record books. You are now the pokemon champion. woot!<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 149<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  9.0.0 - Done?<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Not quite. There is still plenty of pokemon to play. You can try and fill your <br>  dex with captures instead of seen, you still have places you haven't explored <br>  and Pal Park will let you bring your pokemon up from older GBA games. Bottom <br>  line: If you quit now, you are still missing a lot of the game. So, keep on<br>  keepin' on. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  9.0.1 - National Dex<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  To get the National Dex, fly to Celestic town and go north in town. The center<br>  house has an old woman you can talk to and she will show you a picture of<br>  Palkia or Dialga depending on your version. Once you have the picture, your dex<br>  should be full of seen pokes. If it isn't, you haven't fought all the trainers <br>  so you will need to either raise the missing pokes, or go find the trainers you<br>  missed. If you have all 150, go to Sandgem town and talk to the professor. He <br>  will give you the National Dex.<br>  <br>  Pearl Exclusives:   Slowpoke, Pinsir,Houndour, Stantler, Spheal, Bagon<br>  <br>  Diamond Exclusives: Seel, Scyther, Murkrow. Larvitar, Poochyena, Aaron, Kecleon<br>  <br>  Again, all the pokes evolutions are also exclusives to each game.<br>  <br>  Another advantage to the National Dex is now you can get swarm pokemon. Every<br>  day there is a new pokemon swarm in Sinnoh. Fly to Sandgem town and talk to the<br>  little girl watching TV in the house just below the pokemon center. She will<br>  tell you where to go to catch a rare pokemon.<br>  <br>  Pokedex seen count: 150!!<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  9.0.2 - Pal Park<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Pal Park is closed up until you have beaten the Elite Four and have the<br>  National Dex. You can transfer your old pokes from the GBA games to Pal Park.<br>  To get to Pal Park, fly to your house and surf South. The route turns east so<br>  follow it until you reach land. Pal Park is at the very end of the route. There<br>  are trainers along the way so you might have to fight some people. <br>  <br>  Pal Park has to be stocked in order for you to catch your old pokes. You have<br>  to stock it before you start up your save file. To stock Pal Park, place your<br>  GBA game in the GBA slot. Any pokemon that you want to transfer will need to be<br>  in boxes on your GBA game. Start up diamond and get to the screen where you can<br>  pick New Game or your save file. You will have another option there that says<br>  Migrate Pokemon.. You want to pick this option and then use the touch screen to<br>  select the six pokemon you want to migrate. The pokemon will be moved from the <br>  GBA game and not cloned.<br>  <br>  Now, load up your diamond save and enter Pal Park. You have to catch your old<br>  pokemon again but you get Pal Park balls which never miss. Your old pokes will<br>  be exactly the same as they were on the GBA game. You may have to re-think<br>  their movesets now under the new diamond attack scheme. You can take the pokes<br>  to the Move Relearner in Pastoria City and he can teach them a move they<br>  didn't learn because they were not leveled up in Diamond. This is very useful.<br>  <br>  One thing to note about Pal Park is that you can only transfer pokemon from a<br>  game pak once a day. You can transfer pokemon from multiple game paks but<br>  still only once a day per game pak. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  9.0.3 - Cresselia<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Fly to Canalave City and head towards the boat that takes you to Iron Island.<br>  Enter the house right next to the boat on the west coast and there will be a <br>  woman and a sick child. Talk to them both and then go back outside. Talk to<br>  the sailor and he will ask you to save his sick boy. He will take you to a new<br>  island. This island is empty besides the legendary pokemon. It is a quick walk<br>  to it and it will run away just like Mesprit did. Cresselia is a Psychic type<br>  pokemon at lvl50. Use the same strategy you did on Mesprit. You will have to<br>  use the marking map again to find it. If you haven't used the masterball, now<br>  is the time.<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  9.0.4 - Island Area<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  This area becomes available after you have beaten the E4. Fly to Snowpoint<br>  City and move to the southern port. You can now take the boat to the island<br>  area. This area has a lot of new pokes that will help fill your national dex.<br>  It also is the home of legendary pokemon Heatran, a lvl70 monster. <br>  <br>  Upon arriving, you will be greeted by your RIVAL. Afer the discussion, move<br>  north and talk to the fisherman. He will give you the Super Rod. If you keep<br>  going north, you will arrive in the battle zone where the battle tower is<br>  located. You can fight in offline mode or wi-fi battle tower here. The Wi-Fi<br>  tower downloads data and you fight against teams based off of internet teams.<br>  The trainer is a cpu however and not a person. <br>  <br>  You can move north or east from this area. I went east so I will tell you also<br>  to go east, Route 230.<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Route 230 & 229<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Route 230 is a surf route so you need a pokemon who has surf. There are some<br>  swimmer battles along the way and some grass to catch old pokemon in. You will<br>  need rock smash to get the item on the grass island. Every trainer in the<br>  island area uses old pokes so it will help you fill your dex if you fight them.<br>  <br>  Keep heading east and you will reach route 229. When you reach land, go east<br>  and then south. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Resort Area<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  You can now fly here. There isn't much here but grass and a special area that<br>  you can only enter once your pokemon has enough ribbons. From here, you want<br>  go head to the northwest part of town to access Route 228. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Route 228<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  All battles here will be in a sandstorm. If you want to rush through the route<br>  ignoring items and such, stay off the bike slides. Keep heading north and when<br>  you reach a dead end, head west through the grass. Move north and west again to<br>  Route 226. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Route 226<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  There are two ways to go here. You can surf through the water and there is a<br>  gentleman in a house who will give you a foreign language poketch app. It<br>  doesn't really help much unless you want your pokedex in a foreign language. <br>  Instead of that, head north and use your bike to jump the two ramps. Jump down<br>  the cliff and then head west then north. Then east, up the stairs, use bike to<br>  cross, through the grass, east, south then through the grass again. Go up the<br>  stairs, up the stairs, through the grass, west, enter Stark Mountain. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  9.0.5 - Stark Mountain<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  This area has a lot of double battles and you are going to need Rock Smash, <br>  Strength and Rock Climb to get through it. Quick way through is up ahead...<br>  <br>  1) Use rock smash and then Strength. Push the boulder down the stairs<br>  2) East, move north and south rock east, push middle block north<br>  3) North, up the stairs, push boulder, down the stairs, up the stairs, east<br>  4) Rock smash, up the stairs, push boulder, up stairs, up stairs, door.<br>  5) North and you will get a partner. You know how it works now.<br>  6) East, north, down the second set of stairs, north, west, up stairs, trainer<br>     battle.<br>  7) West, north, east, down stairs, push boulder east, up stairs, door.<br>  8) Your "friend" takes your item. Escape Rope.<br>  <br>  When you are heading back for Heatran, you can use the bottom steps if you wish<br>  since you will be able to use rock climb now. <br>  <br>  6) East, down the stairs, west, north after trainers, rock smash, rock climb<br>  7) East, rock climb down, east, north, rock climb between trainers, door.<br>  <br>  Of course, you can go through this area and get the items if you choose. The<br>  iron ball and TM50 is in here. Thesurvival area of the island has a TM but <br>  nothing else. You can get there by either heading north from the battle area or<br>  keep heading west and surf from Route 226. Buck is here waiting inside a house.<br>  Talk to him and he will return the stone to Stark Mountain. <br>  <br>  You need to return to where you last brought him. This time, there will be a <br>  lvl70 pokemon there. It is a legendary so you are going to need lots of <br>  pokeballs. Dusk balls work good as well as timer balls and ultra balls. It will<br>  take awhile to catch. Heatran is a fire/steel pokemon so use a water attack to<br>  do 2x damage to it. It will usually take more balls than Dialga/Palkia. I<br>  highly recommend Dusk Balls for any pokes inside a cave. They are available at<br>  the pokemon league mart. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  9.0.6 - Regigigas<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  You will need to use Pal Park to have access to this lvl70 beast. In order for <br>  this Regi to show up, you need to first transfer Regirock, Registeel and Regice<br>  from Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire to Diamond/Pearl. With these three pokes in your <br>  party, head to the temple north of Snowpoint City. You will be blocked at first<br>  but Cynthia will show up and tell you it is OK to enter. Regigigas is in there <br>  and is a normal type.<br>  <br>  1) Enter, go down stairs. Calcium is here and another staircase. Go down.<br>  2) This next room isn't hard. Follow the path and go down the stairs again.<br>  3) Now the ice puzzle. Go down the ice that is between the two rocks. East,<br>     north, west, north, west, south. You should stop now. West, north, east,<br>     north, stairs. Walk through the rocks and go down the stairs.<br>  4) We can now see Regigigas but first, ice puzzle. Stand by the 3 rocks so that<br>     you make a square. Head east onto the ice.<br>  5) South, stop, south,east, north, stop, west, south, east, North.<br>  <br>  Press A on Regigigas and as long as you have the 3 REGIs in your party, the <br>  statue will come alive. Ghost type works really well here. Make sure you have a<br>  lot of Dusk and Timer balls.<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  9.0.7 - Giratina<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  A new path has opened up near Veilstone city. You can get their by flying to <br>  Veilstone and heading south. Stick to the east side while heading south and you<br>  will see a new opening. This is the spring path. The spring path leads to the<br>  Sendoff Spring. Walk around the spring until you get to a cave entrance. You <br>  will need to use Rock Climb to enter Turnback Cave.<br>  <br>  The cave is very difficult to navigate through and if you return through a door<br>  from which you came, you will back at the beginning. I was able to get to<br>  Giratina in six rooms but when I tried to duplicate it, it wasn't the right<br>  route. It seems that the cave is random. You need to get past 3 pillars per<br>  the writings instructions. The first room is easy as you can just turnback if <br>  you pick a room that does not have a pillar. Also, do not forget that you can<br>  also go south.<br>  <br>  When you do encounter Giratina, it will be lvl70 and is a ghost/dragon type. A<br>  normal pokemon works very well here as 2 of the 3 attacking moves Giratina has<br>  do not effect normal types. It will be only using slash on your normal pokemon<br>  so a pokemon with Intimidate is going to work out even moreso. Dusk balls catch<br>  it. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  9.0.8 - Rotom<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Rotom is available in the Old Chateau once you beat the elite four. Return to<br>  the chateau and head upstairs. There is a tv in one of the rooms up there so <br>  press A on the tv. You will be attacked by Rotom. Rotom is an electric ghost <br>  and is at lvl15 so do not bring your legendary capture team. If you do not <br>  encounter Rotom on the tv, try again later until you finally do. Keep trying, <br>  it is there. Rotom comes out at night so do not look for him during the day.<br>  <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  9.0.9 - Event Pokemon<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Manaphy - You need to beat Pokemon Ranger and transfer the Manaphy egg from <br>            Ranger<br>  <br>  Arceus  - Requires an event<br>  <br>  Darkrai - Requires an event<br>  <br>  Shaymin - Requires an event<br>  <br>  None of the events for the USA have been planned yet. WAIT AND SEE.<br>  <br>  FROM STEPHEN E.<br>  "I was looking at the area near the end and noticed that you had the event<br>  Pokemon, and that the events are not in the US. Well, people don't have to wait<br>  for an event. Put this in your FAQ: Go to the Jubilife TV Station and find a<br>  reporter. He will then ask what you think of TV or something. Put<br>  "EVERYONE HAPPY". Then he will ask for feedback. Put "WI-FI CONNECTION". This<br>  unlocks the "Mystery Gift" option at the main menu. Save your game and restart<br>  the DS. Then select "Mystery Gift" on the main menu. You will have 3 options:<br>  Obtain via Friend, Obtain via Wireless or Obtain via WFC. When you beat the<br>  Elite 4 and obtain the National Dex, go to the Obtain via WFC. The mystery gift<br>  will be downloaded from the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection (Nintendo WFC). That is <br>  another way to get the event Pokemon without cheating."<br>  <br>  This enables the mystery gift option on startup but you still need to wait for<br>  the event to happen to get the event pokemon. The following sections only apply<br>  if you obtained the event via hacking or mystery gift.<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Darkrai<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Enter any pokemart to see a man in green standing next to the counter. Talk to<br>  him and he will give you the Members Card. Fly to Canalave city and head north<br>  of the pokemon center. There is a Harbor Inn that you can now enter. Once<br>  inside, you will be put in a bed and taken to an island that just has Darkrai<br>  waiting. Darkrai is level 40 and you cannot leave the island unless you capture<br>  or defeat Darkrai so be sure to bring a party that can handle it.<br>  <br>  NOTE: You cannot get into the Inn if you have not cured the sick boy with the<br>  Lunar Wing. See the Cresselia section of the guide if you have not taken care<br>  of the sick boy.<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Shaymin<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Enter any pokemart to see a man in green standing next to the counter. Talk to<br>  him and he will give you the Oak's Letter. The letter is a request for you to<br>  go to Route 224 so go there now. Fly to the Pokemon League and head south back<br>  into Victory Road. There is a cave that goes east in the first room of the <br>  Victory Road cave and it is open now. You need to take that cave. Why going<br>  through the cave, you will meet up with Marley and she will ask to follow you<br>  through the cave. The cave gets foggy here as well. You are definetly going to<br>  want to have Defog in here as the cave is long and tedious. The cave's exit is<br>  in the northwest corner and you end up outside.<br>  <br>  There is grass here and some trainers. Make your way north through the grass.<br>  Keep heading north and you will reach a white rock with Oak standing in front<br>  of it. He will ask you to thank someone and put what you want and suddenly, <br>  flowers eveywhere. Shaymin will appear and run away so follow it! Run along the<br>  new path for a while and you will eventually reach Flower Paradise. Shaymin is<br>  just ahead.<br>  <br>  Shaymin is lvl30 and has a recover move. It isn't hard to catch and I caught it<br>  full health with a great ball. Once you have caught Shaymin, fly away. Shaymin<br>  comes attached with a Lum Berry.<br>  <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Arceus<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Enter any pokemart to see a man in green standing next to the counter. Talk to<br>  him and he will give you the Azure Flute. You need to go to the Spear Pillar<br>  again, to where you faught Dialga/Palkia. When you get to the top, the flute<br>  will play and a staircase will appear. Go up the stairsway and as soon as you<br>  reach the top, you fight Arceus. Arceus is lvl80 and changes forms depending on<br>  which plate you attach to it. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  CONCLUSION<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  That concludes the main section of the walkthrough. Your job now is to fill<br>  your dex, trade online and battle online.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...<br>  <br>  _______________________<br>  Extra Content<br>  _______________________<br>  <br>  Extra content is meant to be helpful for online battling and not so much for<br>  in-game help. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  E.0.1 - EVs & IVs(Overview)<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  All pokemon are different, even ones of the same type. EVs and IVs help ensure <br>  that all pokemon stay different. EVs are effort points and IVs are Individual <br>  Values. Every pokemon you catch or hatch, has a predetermined set of IVs. They <br>  are random in the wild but can be somewhat controlled while breeding. At lvl <br>  100, the IVs will add however many points they are worth to that particular <br>  stat. It is best to show by example so I will. <br>  <br>  When you first catch a pokemon, you can calculate it's IVs. The higher the<br>  level, the more accurate you can calculate. So, if you have a lvl100 Kadabra<br>  with a Sp. Attack IV of 15 and another one with a Sp. Attack IV of 27. The<br>  latter Kadabra is going to have an Attack stat that is 12 points higher than<br>  the former Kadabra. IVs for each stat are random and calculated when you<br>  encounter the pokemon.<br>  <br>  EVs are effort values and they are hidden stats gained from battling. They <br>  have an impact on a particular stat and you can gain more of one stat by<br>  fighting certain types of pokemon.  For example, if you wanted to raise your<br>  attack stat, you would fight a lot of machokes and machops. You can have up to<br>  510 EV points but only 255 per stat. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  E.0.2 - Team Building Help<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  So, you finished the main game, you went online and got totally stomped. What<br>  do you do now? How can you get better pokemon? I am going to assume you already<br>  have a semi-diverse team because that is a pretty basic concept. You need to <br>  either pick better pokemon or raise your pokemon better. <br>  <br>  Each pokemon has a focus area in their stats. For example, the Abra evolutions<br>  have a very high special attack and speed. This does not mean that all abras<br>  are good. If you get a pokemon that has low IVs in it's focus area, then that <br>  is a perfect example of a bad pokemon. Kadabra is meant to hit hard and fast so<br>  if it cannot do that because of bad IVs, it will die quickly due to lack of<br>  defense.<br>  <br>  How can I change IVs? Well, you can't. You cannot change IVs ever(in-game). You<br>  can affect IVs however. When you breed two pokes, the IVs of the spawn are<br>  directly affected by the parents. I have crunched a lot of numbers and this is<br>  what I have come up with. The IVs of the spawn pokemon is somewhere in between<br>  or the same as the IVs of the parents. To clarify, if you breed 2 Kadabras and<br>  one parent Kadabra has a speed IV of 20 and the other has a speed IV of 25, 9<br>  out of 10 times the spawn will have a speed IV of at least 20. About half of<br>  the time the IVs will be in between the two and about 1/3 of the time, the IVs<br>  will be higher than the two. <br>  <br>  You can calculate IVs at any level but it has to be a pokemon that has not had<br>  any battles and it should be at about lvl15. The best way to do this is to<br>  breed two pokes, save right before you get the egg, get the egg and hatch it.<br>  Use rare candies to level it up to about 15, then check IVs. If you get crap, <br>  reset the game and get the egg again. You cannot take the egg and then save<br>  because the pokemon will be the same if you reset. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  E.0.3 - Moveset Help<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Ok, so we should already know that we use attacks depending on what type of<br>  pokemon we have. We do not want to use physical attacks with our Kadabra<br>  because it has a garbage attack stat. So, we want to make sure we are only<br>  using special attacks on our Kadabra. Also, any moves that are the same type as<br>  the pokemon using them, get STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus). Our Kadabra using <br>  a psychic move does 1.5x more damage than our kadabra using any other type of<br>  move. This doesn't mean we should have only psychic moves on our Kadabra though<br>  because you shouldn't need more than one type of the same move on your pokes. <br>  <br>  Pick one move of a certain type and use that. IN-GAME you might want the extra<br>  PP and that is why you leave multiple types but online battling is a different<br>  ball game. Kadabra should have psychic because it is the most powerful psychic<br>  move and not anything else like psybeam or confusion. The rest of it's moves<br>  should vary so you can do the most damage to the most types of pokemon.<br>  Remember to check the icon to see if it is physical or special before you put a<br>  new move on a pokemon. <br>  <br>  Dusclops with Shadow Ball is ok in R/S/E/FR/LF but Dusclops with Shadow Ball in<br>  D/P = not good.<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  Egg Moves<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Egg moves are moves that a pokemon can learn through breeding. When the pokemon<br>  is hatched, it will be hatched knowing these moves. The male parent has to know<br>  the move in order for the spawn pokemon to learn it. Egg moves allow you to<br>  choose from more moves than the ones you get from leveling up. You should look<br>  into egg moves when deciding on the pokemon for your team to see if there is<br>  one you want before you start breeding. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  E.0.4 - Natures<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Natures are very helpful in raising your pokemon. They raise one statistic by<br>  1.1x and lower another one by .9x. The nature determines which stats get raised<br>  and which get lowered. You want to be sure that the pokemon you are raising<br>  has the correct nature for what you want it to be. The following natures do not<br>  affect stats: Hardy, Docile, Bashful, Serious and Quirky. You may want a<br>  pokemon like this but this is usually not the case. You should once again pick<br>  a nature that is beneficial to what you are raising. Adamant is a great nature<br>  for a physical pokemon because it does not affect defense or speed and raises<br>  physical attack. Below is a chart for natures that does not include the ones I<br>  mentioned above:<br>  <br>  NATURE.............UP....................<br>  Lonely.............Attack................<br>  Brave..............Attack................<br>  Adamant............Attack................ Attack<br>  Naughty............Attack................ Defense<br>  Bold...............Defense...............<br>  Relaxed............Defense...............<br>  Impish.............Defense............... Attack<br>  Lax................Defense............... Defense<br>  Timid..............Speed.................<br>  Hasty..............Speed.................<br>  Jolly..............Speed................. Attack<br>  Naive..............Speed................. Defense<br>  Modest.............Special Attack..........Attack<br>  Mild...............Special Attack..........Defense<br>  Quiet..............Special Attack..........Speed<br>  Rash...............Special Attack..........Special Defense<br>  Calm...............Special Defense.........Attack<br>  Gentle.............Special Defense.........Defense<br>  Sassy..............Special Defense.........Speed<br>  Careful............Special Defense.........Special Attack<br>  <br>  If you are breeding and the mother pokemon has a nature you want then attach an<br>  everstone to it. You then have a 50% chance of getting the same nature as the<br>  parent.<br>  <br>  Examples of good natured pokemon:<br>  Alakazam    =  Modest<br>  Dragonite   =  Adamant<br>  Crobat      =  Jolly<br>  <br>  Pick a nature that works for your moveset. Sometimes it is hard to get the<br>  nature you want so do not pass up on a high IV pokemon unless the nature is<br>  really bad. For example, I have an all-around 31 IV Alakazam that is Rash. That<br>  works fine because it raises what I want and does not affect it's speed. Modest<br>  would have been better but you take what you can get. Do not sacrifice nature<br>  for IVs though. A perfect IV pokemon with a bad nature is usually worse than a<br>  mediocre IV pokemon with a helpful nature. <br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  E.0.5 - Team Member types<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  These are terms you might see online and also you should use them to see how<br>  well your team is balanced. If your team is filled with all pokemon of one type<br>  then you should consider changing it up some.<br>  <br>  Special Sweeper  - A pokemon that uses Special Attack and Speed to hit hard and<br>                     fast. The goal of this pokemon is to wipe out the opposing<br>                    pokemon in one hit. Sometimes a stat raising move is required<br>                    like Nasty Plot or Calm Mind. <br>  <br>  Examples of special sweepers: Alakazam, Porygon-z<br>  <br>  Physical Sweeper - Same as a special sweeper but uses the Attack stat. Moves<br>                     like Dragon Dance and Swords Dance are VERY helpful on<br>                     physical sweepers.<br>  <br>  Examples of physical sweepers: Dragonite, Garchomp, Gyarados, Metagross<br>  <br>  Annoyer          - A pokemon that inflicts status changes and weather condition<br>                     to slowly drain the opponents HP. Moves like Toxic, Confuse<br>                     Ray and Will-o-Wisp are found on these pokemon. <br>  <br>  Examples of annoyer pokemon: Crobat<br>  <br>  Tank/Wall        - A very sturdy pokemon that is hard to take out. Pokemon that<br>                     have high defense or special defense fall into this category<br>                     Amnesia, Cosmic Power and Iron Defense can usually be found<br>                     on these pokemon. They also usually have a move like Rest so<br>                     when you lower them enough, they will get HP back.<br>  <br>  Examples of tank pokemon: Torkoal, Snorlax, Claydol<br>  <br>  Mixed annoyer and tank - I think you know what this is.<br>  <br>  Examples of mixed annoyers: Dusknoir, Umbreon<br>  <br>  Mixed Sweeper    - A pokemon that uses both physical and special attacks to do<br>                     a lot of damage. It is meant to get the most chances at SE<br>                     attacks. Mixed sweepers need to be trained carefully.<br>  <br>  Examples of possible mixed sweepers: Dragonite, Salamance<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  E.0.6 - EV Training<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Ok so, after 26416418419 eggs, you have finally bred the perfect pokemon. Or,<br>  you are satisfied with whatever pokemon you got but now you want to really<br>  maximize it's abilities. You have decided that this pokemon has to be on your<br>  team and you know what it's role is. Now it is number crunching time. The first<br>  thing you have to do is to decide what EVs you are going to give this pokemon.<br>  To decide correctly, you need to understand how EVs turn into stat gains. Put<br>  the game down now because it is time to put your thinking cap on.<br>  <br>  You already know that the most EVs you can have is 510 and each stat can only<br>  take a maximum of 255 EVs. At level 100, every 4 EVs = 1 stat point. This means<br>  that if you put 255 EVs into a stat, you are going to gain 63 points in that<br>  area. The extra 3 get thrown out. So, you shouldn't put 255 you should only put<br>  252 because if two stats have 255 then you gain 126 stat points. However, if<br>  two stats have 252 EVs and one stat has 6, that is 127 stat points you have<br>  added to your pokemon. One stat point I know but this game is truly a game of<br>  numbers and every little bit counts. If you are going to put the time in anyway<br>  you might as well maximize your effort.<br>  <br>  This means when you are trying to figure out what EVs to give your pokemon, you<br>  should always make them multiples of 4 when possible to have the least amount<br>  thrown out. You also need to consider your pokemon's role in your team. Here<br>  are some EV spreads that are not completely thought out but will definetely get<br>  your pokemon where they need to be to at least win. <br>  <br>  Alakazam - 252 Speed, 252 Special Att., 6 HP<br>  Dusknoir - 252 HP, 129 DEF, 129 Sp. DEF<br>  Gyarados - 252 Att, 252 Speed, 6 HP<br>  <br>  You can pretty follow this formula. Any sweeper is going to get 252 speed and <br>  252 attack (either physical or special). Tanks/Walls should get the Dusknoir<br>  spread listed above. Mixed sweepers should get EVs that even out the attack /<br>  special attack. Remember, you have ~127 points you can mix and match on your<br>  pokemon so the more thought you put into it, the better. More advanced spreads<br>  will be talked about in the next section of the guide. <br>  <br>  Now, that you have written down all kinds of numbers while plugging them into<br>  your Windows calculator and have figured out exactly what EVs you want to put<br>  where, you can start playing the game again. Take your freshly hatched pokemon<br>  and start pumping it full of vitamins. Vitamins help to raise your EV points to<br>  100. This is a huge time saver so be sure to start with vitamins. Your new<br>  pokemon is a physical sweeper and you have decided to go with the Gyarados<br>  spread listed above so buy 10 proteins and 10 carbos. Each vitamin = 10 EVs.<br>  Once your EVs in a stat go over 100, you cannot use vitamins anymore. If you<br>  fought some battles by accident and have given your new pokemon 4 attack EVs,<br>  you can still give 10 proteins and your pokemon will have 104 EVs in attack.<br>  <br>  Lets assume you have listened explicitly and have a physical sweeper with 100<br>  EVs in both attack and speed. 510-200 = 300 EVs left. You need to battle<br>  pokemon to get the rest. Certain pokemon give off specific EVs so you want to<br>  fight machops for attack and zubats for speed. Each one of those pokemon are<br>  going to give 1 EV. The macho brace is a very helpful item to shorten EV<br>  training. Attach the macho brace to a pokemon to decrease it's speed but double<br>  the EVs it gets. The speed decrease is removed once you remove the macho brace.<br>  You should use the counter app on your poketch to keep track of how many<br>  battles you have had with a pokemon.<br>  <br>  Pokerus is a very rare pokemon virus you can get. If a pokemon in your party<br>  gets it, it will infect everyone else in the party as well. Pokerus fades away<br>  after midnight so if you want to keep it around, take an infected pokemon and<br>  put it in your PC. Take it out only to infect your party pokemon and then put<br>  it back. Pokerus doubles the EVs like the macho brace. They stack together also<br>  so if you fight a machop with the macho brace and pokerus then you will gain 4<br>  EVs in attack. Pokerus is rare and you get it from defeating wild pokemon.<br>  <br>  The last scenario is if you switch out pokemon while battling, where do the EVs<br>  go? In general, any pokemon that gets XP from the battle, gets EVs too. For <br>  example, if your lead pokemon has Macho Brace and a party pokemon has EXP SHARE<br>  and your lead pokemon knocks out a Machop, both pokemon get EVs. The EVs are<br>  not split up either so Machop gives off 1 Att. EV and both pokemon get 1 Att.<br>  EV. The only difference is the lead pokemon wearing Macho Brace doubles the 1<br>  EV to 2 so it really gets 2 Att. EVs. If you have a team of six pokemon and you<br>  put them all into battle against Machop and none of them are wearing EXP SHARE<br>  or the Macho Brace, then every pokemon will get 1 Att. EV.<br>  <br>  That concludes basic EV training. You will see major stat increases when you<br>  level up in the areas you've EV trained. You can get the macho brace from a bug<br>  guy in Pastoria City. You need to show him the three forms of burmy to get it.<br>  See the next section of the FAQ for more info on EV training and where to you<br>  can do it.

NyDrTXFeaa	To get to Mt. Coronet, you are going to need your HM slave with strength. Fly<br>  to Hearthome city and head west, Route 208. Enter the cave and once inside, you<br>  will need to go north. At the very top of Mt. Coronet is Dialga so be ready for<br>  a legendary battle. Bring about 30 Ultra Balls,4 Quick Balls and 6 Timer balls.<br>  Dialga will be lvl47 and is a steel/dragon type. If you are playing Pearl, you<br>  will not get Dialga but instead will see Palkia. Palkia is a lvl47 water / <br>  dragon type. <br>  <br>  When you first enter the cave, you need to head west to the opposite side. Once<br>  you reach the west entrance, head north and surf across the pond. Use rock<br>  climb to reach the stairs up. You should seen Bronzong somewhere along the way.<br>  It is the evolved form of Bronzor and is new to the pokedex. In the next room:<br>  <br>  North, West, South, Upstairs, North, West over bridge, down stairs, up north<br>  stairs,up stairs, cross bridge, down stairs, down stairs, upstairs and in cave<br>  door. <br>  <br>  Next room: Up stairs, up stairs<br>  Next room: up stairs, trainer battle, west, south, trainer battle, Out.<br>  <br>  Now you are outside. Follow the path and use rock climb when you get there. Now<br>  instead of using rock climb again, head west and through the grass until you<br>  reach another cave. Inside, use rock climb, follow the path, down the stairs<br>  then east out of the cave.<br>  <br>  Outside again. Through the grass, down the stairs, rock climb west. Down the <br>  stairs, through the grass, keep going west and you find another cave. Enter.<br>  There is only one way to go through here so keep following the path, eventually<br>  you emerge at the very top. Inside the cave, there is also Chimecho|`|MImUpAO7aa	exit the way u came, then rock climb at the side in that dead end.|`|DElvIxUVaa	get out of that cave. Its not there. Keep going straight and then you will reach a rock climb thing so climb it and then keep going left until a dead end then when you turn right there would be a cave. BEWARE you must have a lot of pokeball or any ball because you are going to fight palkia. Cyrus and the rest will be there and will battle you.

You can get three or more using action replay but if you don't have an action replay then you can only get one. Don't waste your master ball on palkia/diagla, they are easy to catch.

You shouldn't have to do anything special to get inside, just walk right in, fight through a few levels, and at the top you will get strength.<br>  Good Luck!|`|eMHsSwa6aa	Before when you entered Hearthome city, there is a little house that connects between the city and the route. Go all the way to the left inside of the house then exit to the route.Then you go to your first down all the way on the side of the trees and then you'll find a karate man, talk to him and you'll get the Odd Keystone. Once you get that, go to the right of the house,exit. Then past Hearthome city to the right and you'll see another house. Exit to the right of the house. Then find a broken well southeast of the route and click it. Now you can go to the ghost tower.

AA11749234	If you meant "First Person Shooter" games then there're tons of them out there right now.<br>  <br>  If you meant something like Street Fighter then it would be a rather hard.<br>  <br>  Many fighting games have ceased to exist for PC because they are not exactly money makers right now.<br>  <br>  - For 2D fighting games, you could try to get an emulator and some games ROM. Note : 99.9999% this is illegal. Some notable candidates would be SNK's games. You could play this over the internet usually by using something known as Kaliera. They are actually some pretty tough challenger out there on Kali :D <br>  Example (ROMS) : King of Fighters, The Last Blade, etc<br>  <br>  - For 3D fighting games, I would recommend you a game but I cannot remember its name (silly me). Besides, it's in Japanese. Maybe it would be better to forget about 3D fighting games for PC altogether.<br>  Example (ROMS) : Street Fighter EX2, etc<br>  <br>  A nice game to check would be Guilty Gear X2-Reloaded for PC from Sammy (not ROMS). It is a 2D fighting games for PC. It has nice anime-ish graphic, cool musics, some stories, and mission mode to keep you busy.

Poi ti arrampichi sul tavolo, poi sulla colonna, poi su un piccolo cespuglio (dove devi usare Incendio per bruciarlo). Poi ti appariràla pallina con il tasto triangolo e lui si accosterà al muro per passare, sempre avanti automaticamente si arrampica su un tubo, sale, poi il tubo è rotto e deve sposarsi lateralmente su un altro passaggio stretto. Arrivato ad un certo punto del passaggio di prima devi utilizzare Reparo per riparare il tubo, ci torni e continui a salire. Il tubo, salendo, è di nuovo rotto e quindi devi ripetere lo stesso procedimento. Infine a lato ci sarà un altra strettoia dove c'è un gargoyle rotto, lo ripari andando su un'altra sporgenza. Vai dove si trovava la testa del gargoyle e da li vedi la amcchina fotografica. Usi il wingardium Leviosa per darla a colin.E poi scendi. Fine. Spero di esserti stat d'aiuto. Ciao! <br>  P.S.

JedjRKbEaa	Absolutely.  Backwards compatability is a key part of a new system.  When a system first releases, the amount of "good" games are scarce to say the least, so those that buy them at that point want something to play, and therefore fall back on old games.  Microsoft would be stupid if they did not include full backwards compatability with any new system they release in the future.  As far as achievement points go, they are something that people have worked hard for and Im sure that Microsoft will try hard to include that as well, although that may be a bit more dificult.|`|7cb0e485ac961d148e94e382635aea01aa	One can only hope.

AA12204915	You can get Rayquazza before the elite 4. I only used 3 pokemon to beat the elite 4, i hade 6 in my party but only 3 good ones. I had a lv 60 Crobat, a level 71 Rayquazza and a level 80 Blaziken. What i did with with Blaziken is i trained Beautifly so i can beat the first gym. I ended up ditching him so i can focus on training Blaziken. Pokemon you should get that i didnt is a Magnetric by getting a electrike ahead of slateport at route 110. They are common there. Magnetric learn thunder at level 45 and the attack 120 . You can teach it thunderbolt after you defeat Mauvile Gym and get the key to New Mauvile and complete the mauvile gym leader challenge. Linnone are worthless. Another one you can get earlier is ralts. It is rare at route 102 but you just have to keep looking. They turn into Gardevoir at level 30 and are the best psychic pokemon. It has moves like Confusion, Psychic, Hypnosis and Dream Eater. If you get it to level 60 it is an awesome pokemon. Another good pokemon is Sharpedo. You can get it at level 35 with the super rod at Mossdeep. If you are lucky enough to find a feebas while fishing on route 119. ( it is on 6 of the 400 surf spots on route 119) You have to fish with the super rod though. Milotic are one of the best pokemon. So get a Sharpedo or Milotic. The 5th pokemon would be to get a duskull on the top of mt.pyre. They evolve into dusclops and are very good with ghost with such as curse. Last you catch the rayquazza without a masterball. Then your team would be unstoppable.|`|pZQViCyTaa	very carefully. i say use sceptile, pikachu(with volt tackle), dragonite(if you can), rayquaza, kyogre, and groudon.that was my team when i beat the elite four (on the first try :) )|`|AA10757943	well i think the best starter is a mudkip<br>  along the way you should catch a tialow<br>  but ditch tilow at the elite four<br>  make sure u have a good fire pokemon such as rapidash or caurmapt<br>  a good richau always helps<br>  if u can catch a good ice pokemon that will work<br>  and a machop is always good to have<br>  that should help u<br>  just dont have weeker pokemon like linoone dodrio shiftry or absol<br>  and yes u do have to beat the elite 4 to get raquaaza ive tried|`|FDTKxgJ1aa	try to get rayquaza you do not have to beat the elite four to get him|`|ha9b2qxraa	The same pokemon just level them up more to like level 60

On rainbow six there is no cheating no 1 hit kills (unless you get a headshot) and also it has a great system of taking cover, blind firing and a great online community.

JedjRKbEaa	WHAT??!!! The future for the PS3 looks bleak??? On the contrary, the future of the PS3 is what is selling the consoles right now due to lack of games at the present moment.  But if you remember back to the 360 at this same time (6 months after launch) games were very scarce for it as well.  But how can you say the future is bleak for the PS3 and it has no good games when games like Heavenly Sword, MGS4, FFXIII, FF vs XIII, GT5, Killzone 2, and Infamous releasing very soon. And those are just a handful of the PS3 exclusives, you've still got God Of War 3 to look forward to soon, and every game that is phenomenal, (minus Halo 3, Fable 2, and Mass Effect) releasing on both systems, the PS3 has more life left in it than the 360 could ever dream.  Plus the standard console lifespan is around 3 - 4 years, the 360 is already almost 2 years old, meaning soon, another one will be released and the 360 games will start to be discontinued as they were with the original XBOX. However, since the PS2 still going strong 8 years after its initial release, the PS3 is here to stay and in a big way.   The potential of the cell processors have yet to even be tapped into, meaning that in another year or so, the 360 games will continue to look the same and play the same, with no advancements, whereas the PS3 will still be growing and expanding on both accounts.  The 360 does have better on-line right now, but they've been at it longer, give Sony some time, you don't have one of the best MMORPG's without knowing a little something about on-line play.  My opinion, keep the PS3, and the money you're saving from not buying games right now, save it and get a 360, shouldn't take too long with the prices games have gone to.  lol|`|AA10523985	As  a 360 Owner, I wanted to play "Resistence: Fall of Man" and was considering also purchasing a PS3 until my local EB guy told me that most games being launched on the PS3 would be on the 360 so its not really worth the cost to me.<br>  <br>  I've had nothing but good luck with the games (Gears, Oblivion, Call of Duty2, etc).  This system only ran $400 (compared to the $600 for PS3)<br>  <br>  Sell the PS3 and grab a 360 and couple of games to boot!|`|AA12243143	buy a car!

Runescape though it is unpopular now it can get addictive and fun (www.runescape.com),  Adventure Quest which is pretty cool (www.battleon.com) and maybe Sherwood MMORPG (maidmarian.com/Sherwood.htm) which isn't really popular but is pretty fun and the graphics are awesome.  Also try other games from Maid Marian.  Note these are all online MMORPG's. Hope it helps!|`|ce58dc2ca3f04c5917d30396a655f03aaa	that is not going to happen. buy more memory dude

And i am guessing limos aren't cheap but if u could get one then that to me would be the perfect 14th birthday party for me!<br>  <br>  Hope i could help!|`|IQGXPpyraa	If you have a backyard, try throwing a "camping" sleepover.  That way, you can do whatever you want and not really worry about making a mess.  Also, your parents will be there, but they won't be within earshot so you can pretty much talk about whatever you want too.  For party games...I always thought scavenger hunts were fun.

EH4aRp6iaa	You could find 1 Dawn Stone at Mt. Coronet. Another alternative is to have a Pokemon with the "Pickup" ability (i.e. Linoone, etc.) and use it in battle in hopes of attaining one afterwards. <br>  <br>  To add onto that, the chance of picking up a Dawn Stone is around 4% with a level 50-70 Pokemon (of course, one that has the Pickup ability). However, that percentage increases to 10% if it's higher than level 70.  <br>  <br>  And unfortunately, you CANNOT find them using the Explorer Kit. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|NyDrTXFeaa	explorers kit under ground. thats all.

SM04l299aa	Blu-ray will not win the format war. As it is only Sony format.<br>  <br>  How did Beta lose the Video tape format war? The Porn industry chose VHS.<br>  <br>  So with the HD or Blu-Ray or even the one up from that... It would be hard to say that the Porn industry needs that much on one disk. <br>  <br>  I think both will be around as Sony is trying to pull a Microsoft. UMD didn't really work out for Sony to much but it doesn't stop them from making psp games now does it?|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Nothing is going to happen to the PS3 games.  It's like the UMD or Nintendo optical disks.  If developers want to make games for the PS3, they'll have to do it in Blu-ray, whether they like it or not.  <br>  <br>  _________________________<br>  Blu-ray is not going to lose the format war because it's already outselling HD-DVD by a margin of at least 3:1, perhaps more.  The top 3 movie studios all support Blu-ray, and the 4th (Warner Bros) supports both Blu-ray and HD-DVD.  The only major movie studio that supports HD-DVD is universal.  <br>  <br>  The porn industry may have controlled the Beta vs. VHS war, but it's not going to control the Blu-ray vs. HD-DVD war.  It's not even going to make a dent.  HD-DVD have been around for 2 year or so, and how many porn movies are in HD-DVD?  Very few.  For that matter, very few porn studios even support HD-DVD.  The whole point of the porn industry is to put out as many movies as possible while using the least amount of money.  By using HD-DVD, they're going to lose a lot of money, so most will stick to DVD.|`|3a985bd1cfe3739c988a421b7bc901b7aa	sigh, the porn industry WILL NOT decide this format war... i mean, when was the last time you bought a porn DVD? With porn so easily accesible on the internet, it is less of a factor now than it was during the Beta Max/VHS days... and the only reason porn went to VHS is because Sony refused to give them the liscensing... Sony has learned from there mistakes and are giving them the required liscences...<br>  <br>  Blu Ray will win this format war because it is superior to HD-DVD. Ya, the viewing quality is the same but the fact that Blu Ray can hold more twice as much data as a HD-DVD disc, well, already speaks for itself... Blu Ray is more than just HD movies... eventually, it will be the standard in which PCs come with...<br>  <br>  and if I'm wrong, nothing will happen to the games... besides, game companies like blu ray... they don't need to compress audio files (which make them sound better) and they can pile on so much data into these discs...|`|3DOXVZUbaa	No, games will be their, just way less movies. Doesn't really matter though. Blue Ray is the better tech. We'll see...|`|xI1ydoeHaa	Nothing much..........PS3 is meant for games........ right now the bluray is their excuse and the games are investments(1-2 years)<br>  <br>  ANYWAY WHY ARE YOU PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT PORN MOVIES.....................................<br>  <br>  What they are tryin to say is that PS3's only hope is porn......<br>  <br>  "P

WWE S vs R, that's a good one too. but the best games are coming out in the next 6 months, in November Silent Hill : Origins comes out. and in January God of War: Chains of Olympus comes out. Manhunt is suppose to come out in August for the PSP but with the AO rating I don't know when it will come out or it will still be banned by Sony. So the best are still to come.|`|1zMXPIh1aa	shutup

lGctHJ7xaa	That means the system overheated and is probably fried.  You need to call Microscotch and, presuming it's still under warranty, they will send you a box and will fix it for free.  Afterwards, I would recommend getting a Nyko intercooler from Target/Gamestop.  It's only 20 bucks and I've never heard of anyone who had a system burn out with one attatched.|`|rY23uewCaa	it means you need to send it in......call the costumer service # on the xbox web site and they'll get you another one for 120 bucks..........it sucks i had that happen to me|`|JR4xIaS0aa	I just came across a site that sends you a Xbox 360 for free!

807c75362df274d8b3a3b48b8e123e5aaa	dude seriously this isnt hard at all it perplexes me how people dont get it. first of all you have to have dsl or higher internet. second you should really have a router but its possilbe with out one but troublesome. third you can go to a store like gamestop or best buy or walmart anywhere that sells 360s and buy live in 1 month 3 months or 12 months. you get a little card you go home to your 360 which is hooked up to the internet you go to the far right blade on the dashboard and hit redeem code. alls you need to do with the router is plug your modem into the main slot on it should say which it is then run an ethernet line or if you have wireless make a connection to both your computer and 360. if you dont have a router you can unplug the cord that goes to your computer from your modem and plug your 360 in but you have to have a reset button on the modem and press that before you plug the 360 in and again before you plug your comp back in. it is really simple you just have to be able to think logicaly also its a little harder to get the modem to connect if you have verizion for some reason it likes to be picky. also sometimes you will need to restart your comp when you plug it back in and try to always plug in your 360 only when its off and then turn it on after its in it makes it easier on the connection and cuts down on lag<br>  <br>  ps you HAVE to have a hard drive to get online and also the 360 comes with a built in network adapter so no there is no seperate item you buy other than a live supscription|`|77IIA8UIaa	easy read the yellow book in the box of the xbox|`|IxWarFPHaa	Go to xbox.com/connect|`|AA10481065	1.

Mu12nRX5aa	Yes, but you have to do two things in order to get him. First, in the main story mode, you must purify every Shadow Pokemon in the game. Second, you must beat the Mt. Battle Knockout Challenge in Colosseum mode, you can do either Single or Double battle. But, I believe you have to beat it with your team from story mode, not any teams from the GBA Games. And after you beat all 100 trainers, Ho-oh is yours, and will be sent to your PC.|`|8x5AnR6Qaa	I think it's possible.

Jl9UdpeHaa	For playing Playstation 1 Games, you will need the Connectix Virtual GameStation program, or Bleem or for more compatibilty use ePSXe!! Check and you will find it on the net. Download and Enjoy!! For playstation 2 games, search for PCSX2, available at www.pcsx2.net. Don't forget, you will also need to search for the bios file on the Internet. Virtual Gamestation does not require a bios file.|`|AA11306754	u mean an emulator.... those are illegal unless u own the game but whatever i'll send u the link to it in a minute... here u go <a href="http://pstools.bizhat.com/ps2_emulators_download.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pstools.bizhat.com/ps2_emulators_...</a> i suggest u download the second one, its most popular and it probably runs well... i've never tried this but u can try and put ur PS2 CD into ur disc drive... see what happens... then select the emulator and maybe just maybe u'll be able to play...|`|gL7IBFvmaa	I'm not sure you can emulate actual ps2 disks, but I'm sure you can download ROMs (remember you must have the actual Ps2 game or it woule be illegal) from websites that are exactly like the game.

But do just what I said, beat the game with all characters.

Are you that lazy?  I know a great free MMO but you have to download the game so nevermind.|`|aDRLKP43aa	I have your answer - <br>  <br>  I found two games I really like - both are free with their own strengths / weaknesses.  Google search "Rappelz" or "Dofus"<br>  <br>  1 - Rappelz - I would call this game the Holy Grail of Free MMORPGs.  I would say the closest game would be WoW (but WoW is much better and more addicting)<br>  <br>  Rappelz best thing about it<br>  <br>  Customizing character developement<br>  <br>  3 races - <br>  a. Deva (healer / defensive type)<br>  b. Asura (damage dealer / offensive type)<br>  c. Gaia (balanced type)<br>  <br>  Also within each race you have 3 basic professions which later expand to 2+ more selections:<br>  <br>  a. Deva gets Holy Warrior (Tank/Paladin), Cleric (Healer/buffs), Breeder (Monster Trainer Specialist)<br>  <br>  b. Asura gets Strider (Offensive Fighter/Ranger), Dark Mage (Final Fantasy 's Black Mage), and Summoner (Offensive Monster Trainer)<br>  <br>  c. Gaia gets the Fighter (well rounded fighter/archer), Kahuna (hybrid fighter/magic user) Spell Slinger (Balanced Monster Trainer)<br>  <br>  Besides that you have a large world, lots of quests, and I found the game to be pretty fun.<br>  <br>  Currently I am only a level 27 Sorc., but I am kind of a casual player so I don't like paying for online games... I would recommend it.<br>  <br>  -'s<br>  1. Servers are down - ALOT (warning you now)<br>  2. The game is free, but there are some pretty good things if you want to use Gpotato money (Paypal) to buy items to help you out (2x exp / job points for 1 hour for example).<br>  3. Buggy computer requirements (seems to crash randomly)<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Other choice<br>  <br>  I love Final Fantasy Tactics for the Playstation - this MMORPG is probably the closest thing to it I have ever played.  Called "Dofus"<br>  <br>  +s <br>  1. Acts alot like Final Fantasy Tactics<br>  2. Simple / Decent graphics and runs on low PC<br>  <br>  -'s<br>  1. Partying is NOT fun, it is too slow (you can level up soloing much faster I think) - You would have to see how this plays to understand, but think of it as playing a turnbased strategy RPG that feels like Chess... <br>  2. Game's overall pace seems pretty slow<br>  <br>  Anyway I got to level 12 and I was playing as an Cra (the archer class)... I kind of liked it, but it was a little too slow for me.  I would recommend it though.|`|dT8scRvTaa	Check out this site:  www.mmorpg.com <br>  <br>  I use it to get news and it has a great ranking list so you can check what is popular, as well as prices for initial and monthly costs.

Those are the two I strongly recommend when buying a game system. Don't go to those awful stores like Wal-Mart, Target, or whatever.

AA11021321	I would strongly recommend the hard drive because with a memory card (64mb) you will quickly run out of space, you won't be able to download patches or extra content (such as new maps or game modes), and since the memory unit is 50-60 bucks the hard drive is only 100, $40 difference - just spring the extra 100.  For example, the new map packs for Rainbow 6 Vegas and Gears of War are about 700-800mb, there's no way that's going on any memory card for the 360.|`|AA10866801	The xbox premium package and the elite both come with there own memory. The core does not. The core (if i'm right) only comes with a controller and something else. The premium is $100 more then the core, but the smaller hard drive cost $100.<br>  You should not get the core system.|`|K8t1lPXsaa	it depends on what version you get. one you you need to buy the hard drive. that's the xbox 360 core, then there are two other versions with increased memory that don't need it. the highest memory 360 runs about that same as a new ps3 so about 500 bucks

AA11823330	(1) change the area, not the whole area just the grass area. For example, Togepi could be found on route ###, but that route has several  grasses apart from each others,  Togepi can only be found in one of these grass areas (not a random case)<br>  (2) change your timeslot, if you use it at night try at day etc. Try at 11 AM or 12 PM :)<br>  (3) I am not sure about this, just change the first pokemon in your party.

AA11612795	Three Options:<br>  <br>  1) Use a filled soul gem.  Use "Soul Trap" spell on a creature with an empty soul gem in your inventory to fill it up.  There are 6 different levels of soul gems, ranging from Petty to Black.  NPC souls can only be captured in a black soul gem.<br>  <br>  2) Pay someone at a Mage's Guild hall to recharge it for you.  It will be a button at the bottom of the screen (like Barter or Training)<br>  <br>  3) Use a VARLA stone, not a Welkynd stone like someone else said.  These stones are also found in Aylied Ruins, but are much rarer.  They are black and white, and pointed at both ends.  Using one of these stones will recharge any and all enchanted weapons or staffs in your inventory.|`|0185GdB7aa	have you tried using one of those crystals? not a blue a white one. or use a soul stone especially black ones|`|3kxAhLZ0aa	Use a Charged Soul Stone to recharge the weapon, if that not right use a Welky Stone, Plus some mages in the Guild Halls can recharge weapons also. For a  steep price. If not right sorry I haven't played in long while, but that is best answer I can give you for now I will check into again here soon and will get back to you if that is not right.

TYstsM7Yaa	OK some people all saying it is bad because of less  player customization and a poor campaign.<br>  <br>  I however just got the game and would say it is the game is better then oblivion because it has a good multiplayer xbox live.  <br>  <br>  If you dint have box live I'm not sure if i would get it.

ce58dc2ca3f04c5917d30396a655f03aaa	well. if your mage is your main then become Mining and Engineering. it helps alot for casters because of the cloth gear you can make. But if it's your alt make it Enchanting and Tailoring. it's really expensive and it takes time to get up but that really isn't a problem if you have a higher level main.

7p2o6w8faa	Ok.  I'm not really sure what you're trying to say.  If you're talking about the archer, when he lights the bridge on fire and you jump off using the crate, then you shouldn't have a problem getting back to the Zoras. All you have to do is warp there.<br>  <br>  The penultimate insect is in the small square outside of the bar in Castle Town. Destroy the boxes nearby to roust it, then kill it. Midna will then point you out to the final insect on your map, in the middle of Lake Hylia. You can warp there, if you like.  (Did you forget?

ce58dc2ca3f04c5917d30396a655f03aaa	if the old one is better then they wouldn't have made a new one. so the answer is no. the new one is infact better. but not worth buying a new PSP for. actually. throw your psp out of the window until they make one with 2 analogs. then collect the scraps and sell it to a pawn shop along with your mother's jewelry to buy the new one|`|adpPgJoXaa	no the new one is better because it is lighter and if they made a new one it would have to be better because it will just be a rip off
I6a5brNkaa	XBOX 360! has better graphics bigger games and general awesomeness. plus you get all the free arcade games.<br>  <br>  the wii is also really cool. it has fun gameplay, it has some major titles (smash bros brawl) and its good for excercise aswell :D|`|P0M9QBKOaa	It really depends on the types of games you like to play and if you have a high definition TV.  The XBOX 360 support HD games and has better graphics as well.  Nintendo has a lot of fun and unique games (involving full body motion) that are great to play with non-gamers.  I have played my Wii with my parents and friends that would NEVER try another gaming system.<br>  <br>  So very basically...<br>  Fun/Casual Gamer = Wii<br>  Hardcore Gamer = XBOX/PS3|`|a4gGZsbyaa	If you like to play games with motion sensors or like to play with 3 other friends then the Wii is for you.

er9Ftl8Caa	Gta 4 is a completely new story to the whole series. Yes, it's set in Liberty City but its supposed to be a complete copy of New York City and its 5 buroughs:<br>  <br>   New York City comprises five boroughs, each of which is coextensive with a county: The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island. With over 8.2 million residents within an area of 322 square miles (830 km2), New York City is the most densely populated major city in the United States<br>  <br>  The Xbox version will have Xbox Live multiplayer which is way better than the PS3 version. Plus, Microsoft already has plans to release downloable chapters to the game for xbox live.<br>  <br>  I can't wait till this is released. It will be the best game created.|`|781f1b49265b1eed1172c3bab9e54872aa	Well im guessing it'll start a new one since they made GTA III, then vice city and san andreas which were kinda like prequels<br>  And since its GTA IV it'll probably be different...but im guessin there may be a cameo or 2 of a previous character in it|`|sZCNaFqXaa	GTA 4 is a whole new game. New people, new everything.  It takes place in New York and it's branches, and has a whole new story line. The PS3 version and the 360 version will both have different story lines, but the PS3 will have more added content and frequent updates.

QxdohabOaa	Jackie is correct, aces and eights.  Wild Bill Hickok supposedly had that hand when he was killed.  There is dispute as to the 5th card so it has no bearing on the hand.  Its just the A's and 8's part that matters.|`|lsVHxC4vaa	Um, that would be Beethoven's right. Yep, aces and eights. So it  would be good to teach spies aces and sevens. then we would know them when we play poker with them. Shhhhhhhhhh.|`|AA11441980	I know they got the dead mans hand from a guy who had that specific hand of cards when he got blasted, but i dont remember, my guess is a pair of 8's and a pair of aces with a jack??|`|lABXPcohaa	i kno the numbers are 7, 3 but im not sure bout the signs|`|a08b1a7b33d2b4f04b1ef793acfefde5aa	Dead man's hand is one that aint got a winning hand.. heck i dont know.. i dont play poker...LOL|`|3ao6N2Szaa	My dear friend ,aces and eights.

Veramente carino, divertente e pieno di significato, anche per le persone adulte.<br>  <br>  Come film d'azione c'è "Shooter" che coinvolge abbastanza in quanto la storia prende una piega abbastanza inaspettata.<br>  <br>  Se vuoi fantascienza e non hai visto ancora "The Prestige" allora cosa aspetti? Devi vederlo subito! Un vero capolavoro! E insieme a lui ci sta "Next" con Nicolas Cage che, anch'esso, è uno dei miei film preferiti.<br>  <br>  Se vuoi invece un thriller horror puoi vederti la serie "Saw (L'enigmista)". Sono quattro film in tutto.

LGJgs1XRaa	yes it will i have both and the guitar hero guitar works for rock band
V32lLgOKaa	No. There is a huge dispute between PS2/3 and Activision as to whether they can release the patch or not. They have a patch to make the PS2/3 guitar hero guitars compatible with Rockband but Activision won't allow it. XBOX 360 users are luckier as their guitar hero guitars are compatible with Rockband. Rockband guitars for PS2/3/360 will be sold seperately in April for $80 I believe.|`|6FuEY5Dhaa	No, there was a patch to allow you to use guitar hero guitars however harmonix was forced to remove the patch by activision, I believe.

1IL763DUaa	I know action replay is wrong. Not only are you cheating, but it's just wrong. Cheaters never win, but in your case you are lucky. You aren't the only one who benefit's, gaming industries earn the money, you enjoy cheating your game crashes and you complain. That's what happens to cheaters who enjoy taking advantage. Like I heard from this one guy, "Every choice we make has a consequence." Think about that for a second before you start hacking and have some fun. Kids, adults, and other people play fair and work hard to get what they want and then there's people like you who take advantage. You love it, I hate it.|`|dQtjhI57aa	Cheating is WRONG!  It totally defeats the whole flipping purpose of the game.  BIG DEAL if you can't get all the nintendo event legendaries you can live without them!  I think Action Replay is stupid and they only made it to make a big profit out of the people who find it 'awesome'.  I really doubt if the creators wanted full heartedly for the players to cheat through the game.  I have tons of awesome legendary pokemon through not cheating or even trading.  It's called beat the games, catch, and migrate.  I didn't even have to use masterballs.

Its Not Legit Coz it was traded to me over wifi. you can have one if you want. ill get my friend code in a sec|`|xjZKpXTTaa	I would, but let me suggest something to you first:<br>  <br>  Have you tried the online Mystery Gift? That is how my friend claims that she got her Darkrai. Once you obtain the Mystery Gift from the man in Jubilife, save and restart your game. At the main menu, there will be an option called 'Mystery Gift' open that and there is an option known as 'Online Mystery Gift' (or something along those lines... I've used my MG, so I no longer have exact details :\ ) and from there, if you are connected via WiFi, you should be able to obtain the membership card for the Darkrai event.<br>  <br>  I haven't tested this out myself (and i can't anymore), so I'm not 100% sure it works. If not, then you're going to have to wait for me to trade, the WiFi where I live isn't stable and I usually D/C before the trade can start :\<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|WYemzFDgaa	Απ ?τι βλ?πω ε?σαι ?λληνα?.

AA10254001	this really depends on perception.<br>  the truth is- there is no 'correct' answer to this.<br>  <br>  but.. since no one really likes those kinds of answers; here we go:<br>  <br>  <br>  i personally like LoZ:OoT over the others simply because i grew up on the very first LoZ for NES. It is closest N64 game that stays in line with the original. All the classic elements are there.  with LoZ:MM it kinda spins off into another direction. not abandoning the series completely but not the nostalgic LoZ i remember as a budding Video Game Enthusiast. its also very colorful in comparison to the previous games. LoZ:MM in my opinion is sharply geared for young audiences; not saying they all aren't (aside from the latest) but this one most especially is.    <br>  <br>  so- if you want colorful graphics, heaivly kid-oriented fun; go majora's mask. if you want more traditional 'not-quite-adult' fun; go ocarina of time.|`|lvlfBV1daa	I would say the orcaine of time, because it has many features.<br>  You can play as child link and adult link. YOu can even fet the fire and ice and ligth arrows in orcaine of time( The only two games where these are available are the orcaine of time and wind waker, i think) The gameplay and graphics are beter also.<br>  The best Zelda game in my opninion, so far would be Zelda:Wind Waker.<br>  Hope I helped<br>  You can see ratings at Gamespot.com|`|PtNAh7a2aa	Ocarina of Time is much better, and the critics agree.|`|a58uXYrYaa	The very first one on NES is the best.  Sorry.  All others suck.|`|VJTzTKEWaa	zelda majoras mask alot funner and alot longer so u get more gameplay in|`|4mAZltGdaa	Both are good, but  I think Ocarina of Time is the best.|`|PPCca4htaa	I say the Ocarina of Time, but i've never play Majoras mask. My brother said one time that classics are alwys the best, but the new ones have better graphics.|`|nVzqndQUaa	Ocarina of time is much longer and has more stuff to do and larger area to explore.  It was rated one of the best games ever that one's the best, but Majora's mask lets you be 4 different forms of link whenever you choose which adds extra elements to the game, but over all Ocarina of Time is the best game.
7cXJrP6Saa	Yeah, I could. I have a Cyndaquil.<br>  FC:3093-4658-2481<br>  <br>  Whats yours?<br>  My names Naiya.<br>  Im be on in a sec...<br>  Ok Im on now.
f2da73f26820e41a00db0edf3483a591aa	Seeing as it's my code, my site would probably be the best help on it.<br>  The value you want is probably something like 73 or 74.
Xx75SrA9aa	why are you stealing stuff in the first place?|`|U4KLB8Y6aa	go into elvan ruins, if you get into the arcane university there's some good stuff there but if you're caught stealing you get kicked out of the guild. there is also this ruin south of the imperial city pretty close to one of the bridges i think the ruin name starts with an r, in there is a person with orc armor and a pretty good sword umbra you have to kill that person though.<br>  <br>  oh yeah the person below me has it right, and it's ebony armor, haven't played it in a while.|`|YjD6pArcaa	go to vindasel and get umbra plus full ebony armor after u kill her|`|0x40dd54aa	I found the best place to steal stuff but there is one draw back, you only have one hour and it may varies every night. The place by the way is Castle bruma i found it had some pretty good stuff. A shield, one or two daggers and a katana maybe. But you will find all castles are pretty easy to steal from. You can find a varla stone from chorrel maybe it is worth about 500 maybe if you have a good mercantile skill level.
