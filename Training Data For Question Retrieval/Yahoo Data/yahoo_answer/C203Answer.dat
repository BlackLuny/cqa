jTgKBYsfaa	I don't feel the same way you do, though I'm only 26 weeks pregnant so I'm not as far along as you. But I love being pregnant, I love feeling my little girl inside of me moving around. So I could never be tired of being pregnant.|`|SZesaWaEaa	I remember that feeling,but cherish the peace and quiet while you still have it. And get lots of rest between now and the birth,you'll be wanting it the first week. Hang in there, it really will go by fast and before you know it you'll be holding her in your arms and wondering where the time went:)|`|mQNsMfT0aa	your almost to the finish line now and your doing great and I too felt the way you do my first pregnancy was so bad I asked my begged my doctor when I was 37 weeks to induce me I cried in his office even but your almost their stay strong good luck|`|tZfkPQF6aa	YES! I'm 38 weeks and measuring 42 weeks. They think baby is over 8.5 pounds already. I am ready to meet baby (we didn't find out the gender, and I'm ready to know now!) I know that it's just a couple more weeks, but I am so ready now.|`|AA10953561	I felt the same way you do. I just had my baby girl two weeks ago. These last few weeks are the hardest to get through because you want your baby to wait and come out when she is ready, but you also want her out so you can see her and see that everything really is the way it should be. I felt like I was going to go nuts the last three weeks of my pregnancy because I was miserable, in so much physical pain, and my doctor couldn't figure out why I was getting so big (at 37 weeks I was measuring 42 weeks). Then he started talking about c-sections because my baby girl was so big. It was just too much for me. I didn't have to have a c-section though and she was only 8lbs 1oz. <br>  <br>  Take a lot of baths. After that little one gets here you'll barely have time for a two minute shower. Baths were the only thing that seemed to help my lower back and hip pain there towards the end. Also, try switching from sleeping just in bed to taking naps on the couch. The change in the firmness of what you're laying on really makes a huge difference. The softer something was the better I slept.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!|`|kDftsHXjaa	YUP, im 37 weeks and 2 days and im about ready to pop i know its hard but we only have a couple more weeks! im getting impatient, tired of being exhausted and not able to sleep, but in the end it will all be worth it!

If negative, don't worry about and vice versa.|`|AA10356572	not if you are continuing to have sex because if you go off birth control and are not infact pregant - you will be - <br>  <br>  get a home test first and take that then see a doctor to confirm and disguss your options<br>  <br>  better to not have kids - than to have kids and regret it|`|5469eb6e1a00f74f1cd019ead9e79487aa	Take a test first<br>  See a doctor<br>  <br>  If you do get off it before finding out for sure...you need to stop having sex or use some other form of birth control|`|5ee88a16ad3b86c438d30bb31deb9a8faa	Yes, i lost a baby like this. I was pregnant and I didnt know till my period was late. I was on orthotricyclin and kept taking it till I had a possitive pregnancy test. It was a big mistake because I had a miscarriage and further pregnancy tests got lighter and lighter till it was nonexistent. This was the only time I had miscarried and I had 3 children before. I really do believe that it was the birth control that killed my unborn.|`|eb778680efddf2ab34616057fb041391aa	Yes! The sooner the better. I have had 2 miscarriages because I didn't realize I was pregnant & kept taking my birth control. :(|`|01d2be6160ea6df41a60f1fca095e6aeaa	my friend was on birth control and she found out she was having a baby and she lost it.. so ya stop taking it, you don't wanna hurt your baby.. buy a home test or call the doctor...|`|3f25405bb54b8bd96bea8fb3b619327caa	Duh---Yeah of course!!|`|5fe22aa3b9be8f92871c27bea6512d41aa	uh duh|`|c7d30e6458d8492624d8038a4bd60f20aa	YES!  Give your doctor a call and go get a blood test.  Try not to panic though, I was on birth control pills for the entire pill pack and found out I was pregnant.  My daughter is a perfect 7 month old with no problems from the pills.  Good luck!|`|d077b35c8a2ecd2b9f7a611409dd35f4aa	yes top taking it until u find out for sure.|`|dddfc0f3598c0185f71c5db0fd5bfc09aa	Talk to your doctor and have a pregnancy test right away.

Además están las consideraciones médicas que los demás te mencionaron.|`|gDLeO1C3aa	y para que dejarlo adentro del útero de la madre? es razón de salud|`|sOF1fQa3aa	Y q quieres? tener una persona muerta en tu interior ?<br>  Mira q preguntan cada estupidez!<br>  Usa la logica ni?a!!|`|wVngJ89Vaa	Hola,<br>  <br>  Pienso como la mayoria: Por cuestiones de salud claro, y porque asi corres menos riesgo de sufrir consecuencias a largo plazo...sabes eso le paso a mi hermana y claro que mas que doloroso fue traumatico y triste, despues lo supero pero pasar por el proceso y mas sabiendo que tu bebe esta ya muerto es horrible, imaginate con que fuerzas, con que animo, creo que mi hermana pudo hacerlo porque en el fondo de su corazon esperaba que no fuera cierto y pasara un milagro...pero son cosas que ya estan destinadas para la persona y bueno la libro.Claro que despues de eso no hay que dejar de ir al medico porque ya pasandote una situacion asi el riesgo siempre va a estar...mi hermana volvio a perder a su segundo bebe pero ya cuando tenia 2 meses de nacido, porque nacio con un problema en el intestino, ahora ella finalmente esta llendo a Genetica para saber que problema hay....esa es la importancia de seguir visitando al medico...

You could try having your tubal reversed or undergo IVF. I've heard of lots of women who had tubals done who did IVF and had successful pregnancies. This is all assuming you've asked the question because you want to possibly get pregnant lol. <br>  <br>  I would say that if you don't want to get pregnant that if it's worked for the last 12 1/2 years the possibility of coming up pregnant now is pretty slim. Usually when you hear about women getting pregnant after they've had a tubal done it ends up being an ectopic pregnancy. <br>  <br>  So if you think you are possibly pregnant it's important to see you doctor since ectopic pregnancies can be life threatening. Good luck!|`|AA11314578	Yes, if you get a reversal.|`|cLVZEh60aa	Yes. Go see a doctor, he will tell you what to do. They can reverse it.|`|gdmjtfN8aa	it's very unlikely

ASGj1oVkaa	Pues te recomiendo que empieces a estimularte por ti misma, en una ba?era es mucho mejor pero tambien la regadera ayuda, asi aparte de que estas en intimidad y no hay sorpresas  .Empieza por examinar tu cuerpo, no solo los senos o la vagina, explora tu cuello o otras zona y empieza a identificar tus zonas erogenas la cuales varian de persona a persona, despues, a final de cuenta tu zona erogena mas importante en terminos fisicos es tu cerebro y la sigue tu vagina, una muy buena opcion es empezar a toquearte en la entrada y los labios de la misma para ganar lubricacion y despues ocupa esa lurbicacion para estimular tu clitoris, creeme que mientras mas te conoscas mas y mejor seran tus momenots intimos y no te preocupes por aquello de la virginidad, si es tu himen lo que te preocupa entonces no te introcuscas nada por la vagina (que creeme, te daran ganas de hacerlo), en esos casos puedes intentar por medio anal, poco a poco acostumbrandote y que es algo bastante disfrutable tambien, lo principal es la higiene con cualquier actividad de este tipo que hagas. Como ultimo consejo, te recomiendo que te busques una pareja o alguien que te ayuda a ello, hay muchos hombres (me incluyo) que nos encanta ayudar a las chicas a que se conoscan y nos gusta muchisimo el juego previo y estimularlas y que no pedimos llegar a una penetarcion (por lo regular es la mujer quien lo pide si uno hace un buen trabajo)y desde luego tambien esta la opcion de una amiga, pero a final de cuentas no hay nada que cmpartir esos momentos de intimidad con alguien a quien quieras dandose el tiempo entre ambos para conocerse, despue la masturbacion se vuelve natural y mas sabrosa.|`|ALpdlmMqaa	Claro que introduciendote algo en tu vagina no npierdes tu virginidad puedes probar con un vibrador te va a gustar y no perderas tu virginidad.|`|KWNolf3Zaa	pues perdoname pero disculpame, pero no entiendo pq tratar de darte placer tu misma, lo que yo opino es que intentes tener relaciones con un hombre ya que sentiras el verdadero placer y si no quieres perder tu virginidad busca una relacion LESBICA me imagino que tambien sentiras placer.<br>  <br>  intenta una de las dos cosas y si ninguna te agrada pues te masturbas si eso te satisface mas.<br>  <br>  bueno espero que eligas lo que eligas sientas, mas bien disfrutes tu sexualidad como tu quieras pero que la disfrutes.|`|kw1vWodcaa	si se puede, lo que no te aconsejo es meterte algo por q por ahi sin querer pierdas tu virginidad.|`|0f280e2a8671adf3489ee272dd035843aa	Pues mira no necesariamente debes introducirte algo para sentir placer la masturbacion es buena opcion el conocer tu cuerpo mas afondo es algo normal asi que no tengas pena de tocarte hasta donde tu quieras sin tener penetracion con algo simplemente rosar tu clitoris o tus senos te pueden dar mucho placer y asi conservaras tu virginidad|`|M3ZX9rXcaa	Mira la manera mas facil es tokando tu clitoris en movimientos cirkulasres o d arriva a abajo es muy riko|`|vtS1vGTTaa	HOLA. Existen muchas formas de conocer tu cuerpo, y hacerlo disfrutar de lo maravilloso de la sexualidad. El ,clítoris y la zona de la vulva son puntos donde encontraras mucha satisfacción,si lo masajeas suvemente y despues con mas presion y a cierto ritmo , siempre trata de hacerlo con las manos limpias.Y de la manera que mas  te vaya agradando.Si tienes novio o  pareja puedes decirle que te acaricie esta zona, y lograras un grado muy alto de exitacion. Lo mas importante es q siempre establezcas los limites de las caricias y la forma de hacerlo.<br>  Con respecto al miedo a la penetracion, es normal , si tienes miedo , no hagas nada de lo que no estes segura, porque puede ser contraproducente. En lugar de agradarte, te puedes lastimar  y causarte cierto rechazo a futuras experiencias.Aunque esto no siempre ocurre asi , las chicas cuando mas inseguras se sienten , la primera vez suele ser poco placentera. Espera ha estar lista ; ?Cuando ? eso tu y tu cuerpo lo sabran.Puedes ir a enfemenimo.com , y encontrar algo interesante.|`|541dfaa2919daf905bb0ed4f34f117ceaa	Claro?? mientras no sea un pene humano, la virginidad de las mujeres solo se pierde cuando el himen permite el paso de el organo sexual masculino y a veces se rompe y sale sangre en la primera relacion sexual, mientras tu himen este intacto seguiras siendo virgen aunque le metas todo lo que quieras, solo cuando realmente se tiene una relacion sexual por primera vez. Te recomiendo que si estas muy caliente y tienes ganas de algo de placer, comprate unos juguetitos sexuales, consoladores, batos inflables etc. pero no te excedas, puedes ocasionar infecciones vaginales o algo asi. Las mujeres tienen un organo erectil que se llama clitoris y es sumamente sensible al tacto, si sabes donde lo tienes puedes sobarlo ligeramente con las yemas de los dedos y puedes sentir algo de placer, pero ten cuidado con las infecciones, los genitales femeninos son mas sensibles a enfermedades que los masculinos y por eso nos masturbamos mas los hombres ja, ja, ja,??????? aguas con el vicio. <br>  <br>  Suerte.|`|gDLeO1C3aa	compra un consolador y ya sabes que hacer con el

No puedes decirle a una persona que las amas y al dia siguiente upps sorry solo bromeaba... eso es jugar con los sentimientos de una persona y eso no se hace te aconsejo que vayas ampliando los horizontes, en el mundo deber haber una chica para ti que de verdad te amara... O puede que esta chica te quiera pero solo como amiga... o le dio pena decirtelo y te dijo una mentira q estaba bromeando...<br>  Creo que debes enfrentarla y preguntarle la verdad asi saldras de duda.|`|3b4abf22c327d42a69a6ed9d1ef6cbc7aa	Mira mi chavo, pueden ser dos cosas:<br>  o bien es una chava que tiene miedo a externar sus sentimientos y a decir te amo por todo lo que puede significar, o bien es una chava que no sabe lo que quiere ni lo que siente. En cualquiera de los dos casos eso habla de una inseguridad muy grande. Si tu si sabes lo que quieres y no quieres perder tu tiempo "cambiando pa?ales" (está claro que su comportamiento es el de una ni?a todavía) mejor date la vuelta y déjala. Si de verdad la quieres para tí y estás dispuesto a aguantar esas ni?erias, tendrás que ser muy paciente y ayudarla a pasar esta etapa, para esto algunas veces guardarás silencio y otras darás consejos, jugarás un poco el rol del maestro pero a cambio -si pasas la prueba- ella al final te amará y te admirará. Son dos sentimientos diferentes. <br>  Suerte.|`|BN3Ox5wvaa	es por k esta confundida o no sabe lo k de verdad es amar a alguien .|`|O2bsDh90aa	Esa chica te dijo que te amaba ese dia despues hablo con alguna de sus amigas y le dijo lo que habia hecho su amigas le dijo que para que te lo dijo...que se iba a repentir y le comio la cabeza por eso al dia siguiente esa chica fue y te dijo que era una broma.Ella te ama de verda!|`|UjT3kgfgaa	Hola, Si te lo dijo por algo es..

Suponiendo que no haya nada entre vosotros, ignórala y el tiempo te demostrará si estás equivocado en pensar que todo es broma. Si hay algo entre vosotros, hazla ver que con esas cosas no se bromea porque te lo tomas en serio. También debes ser listo y fijarte si en el tono y el tiempo de decirte que es broma va en serio o no. Si te molesta que te lo diga, sea broma o no, háblalo con ella y dile que no te gusta que haga eso. Si no te hace caso, lo mejor es que hagas lo mismo con ella. No sólo tengas en cuenta lo que te dice y cómo te lo dice, sino sobre todo lo que te demuestra.

Coc593Ikaa	I certainly wouldn't have suggested that she give her children away. People seem to think that is such an easy thing to do, but it is incredibly hard. I would yell at someone who suggested it to me as well. How about you tell her that raising a baby is hard and that you will be there to help her however she needs it.|`|3TdT5mG2aa	I never encourage adoption. Go to the Adoption section and you will see why. A mother and a baby should never be separated because of financial issues. Financially, things can change. Adoption is forever and open adoption is not legally enforceable. <br>  <br>  I suggest that she gets a job, sign up for any benefits that she can get, and go after the babies father for child support once the babies are born. She can make it if she works hard.|`|96HWpdkFaa	It's not your place to tell her what to do with her babies.<br>  If she has a family who can help her out..then she will do fine. Maybe it's something you would do...but everyone has different feelings. You should be supportive not try and knock her down.<br>  <br>  It'll be hard no doubt, but that doesn't mean she won't be a good mother.|`|XWk7TDYTaa	wow twins, thats amazing<br>  <br>  Honestly, what you say to her isn't really going to make a difference.<br>  This is obviously a hard decision, but its one she'll have to make on her own.<br>  <br>  But you know this, you have a baby boy.<br>  :)|`|AA11314631	Two babies will be a little bit more difficult than one, but she has you to look up as a role model.  I say, be there to support her through this and be ready to accept whatever she may do (to keep or adopt).  <br>  <br>  As for me, I would love to adopt babies, but I could never be their birth mother.  I will never be able to have more children, but I know that if my kids had been adopted out, I could never forgive myself emotionally. <br>  <br>  She needs to decide what is best for herself and for the babies.  I think the best thing is if she has alot of emotional and financial support from those that she loves if she decides to keep the babies. <br>  <br>  At least she did not abort, so I commend her for that.  It won't be easy, but it is worth the fight in the long run.  <br>  <br>  Be thankful that your friend is willing to have these babies and do whatever she can as a mother to protect and care for the best way that she knows how to.<br>  <br>  I commend you for keeping your baby and going through school like you did.  You are a good mother and should be very proud of yourself.  Parenting is not easy, but the smiles that your own children bring to you are all worth all of the sacrifice.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	She's mad at you, because you are doing it. You didn't give your son up for adoption. Suggesting that SHE should is calling her a bad mom. or bad person. She may have taken it as you think you're better than her. <br>  <br>  It's her situation and I think you should just be there for her through this. Maybe she'll end up doing things like you did. You sound really responsible, and I'm proud of you. Let her have the chance to prove she is as well. Yes it will be hard, but it's her decision.|`|6bMBwaosaa	Adoption is a viable option and as a good friend you are right to make all options known to her. You have experience in this area and perhaps when she has calmed down she will see that you are trying to help her. You are perfectly right to suggest what you have done and you also gave her plenty of options. Give her time to cool off - she is probably very scared and afraid.|`|9JCMVvFKaa	This is always a touchy topic to get into. And its always hard to accept    your friends wishes even if you done agree. If your friend does not want to get her children adopted that is her personal choice. The sad reality is that if she cant take care of the children then they will be seized by child services. Its probably best to wait and see what happens. People change there minds frequently and its hard to predict what they will do|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	Honestly, sometimes we need to learn from our own mistakes. I know you are trying to be helpful, but sometimes things are better left unsaid. Just worry about you and what you have accomplished. Good for you by the way,l  think what you have done is amazing and a lot more than I can say for some adults that are parents. You are a good friend, and just support her decision, that is all you can do. Hugs|`|k5mKomwiaa	say look<br>  do you want to struggle for the rest of your life ..<br>  say.. i know its traumatic to have one but all im askin for u  is to think about it.. say.. look i want u as a friend to have a great life and dnt wnt 2 see u get hurt x at the end of the day its her decision all you can really do is give advice and support her.|`|EKoRHgdgaa	I think that adoption is not the option if she wants to keep her children.  Honestly it was not your place/right to bring it up, it is a personal decision and she has every right to be upset with you.|`|IIH6JjDVaa	I would approach it by maybe showing her from all sides that there is no escape. She is single and is still in school and wants to get a job. Have you ever seen The Secret Life of the American Teenager? Amy wants an open adoption. Your friend could look for a family near her house to adopt the twins, and she could see them any time she wanted to.|`|JWNzoksmaa	tell her its hard..which i know it is.  Tell her the truth of what its like being a 16 year old mom...and the nice stuff about it.  Actually, adoption is not being a horrible mom...it's being a responsible mother.  buy keeping both of those kids is just selfishness on her part..and that's not what benig a mom is all about.  you have to do whats best for your child/children not what's best for you.  and being a sophmore in HS with twins...those kids would better off with a parents that maybe cannot have children and would raise those kids in a finanically stable and loving home.  <br>  <br>  I was 19 when i got pregnant and i gave my child up for adoption. i was able to pick the family and everything.  I gave him to a women that got into a really bad car accident that severed her spine when she was only 15 years old.  She's been in a wheel chair for half of her life and can never have children.  I gave her the gift of life and a child to love.  It was the best thing i could have done for my son b/c i was in a bad place when i was 19.  i was making a little more than minium wage and my bf was a dead beat.  <br>  <br>  Seriously adoption is the best thing for those kids.|`|rOfFOcwpaa	I think it's a good thing she's willing to take care of both of her children although I'm worried about how she plans on taking care of twins with school and work. I know If it was me, I'd drive all the way down to where the father lives and make him pay child support and help with taking care of my children, that would've been my suggestion. I've never had a child, but I know if I was in her shoes I wouldn't want to give either one of my children away despite the odds against me taking care of them. but I think you shouldn't nessarially suggest adoption but rather remind her that adoption is an option if it becomes too much for her to handle otherwise keep cheering for her and hope she succeeds in school, work, and taking care of two kids with no support from her bf.|`|xjTg5tQ0aa	i'll father both of your childrens|`|pULDq0oSaa	i think you did the right thing for suggesting adoption. if shes only 15 how can she support two kids with no boyfriend to help support her, and it would be really hard for her parents to help out considering their daughter is still in highschool, who would hire a 15 year old thats pregnant?<br>  i think she should have the kids and give them to a loving couple who cant have kids. If she still wants to see her kids she can have a open adoption. at least with you, you took night classes and grauduated early and got a job to support your ONE son but she should deff. do the right thing by giving them up for adoption

No debe pasar de los 3 1/2.  Tan pronto notes que tu ni?o o ni?a comience a jugar con bloques y ponga los mismo en orden, cuando organice sus cosas, ya puede estar listo.   Ponle ropita interior y llevalo a cada rato al ba?o para que practique, sientalo aunque no haga nada, conlleva mucha paciencia y tiempo.  Si se lo hace encima, simplemente llevalo al ba?o y sientalo luego cambialo de ropa.  Tienes que tambien recordarselo en todo momento.  Suerte!!!   <br>  <br>  No todos aprenden al mismo tiempo.  Mi hijo mayor aprendio a los 2 a?os el segundo aprendió a los 2 1/2 y la nena tardo aproximadamente llegando a los 3.  <br>  <br>  Mucha paciencia es lo primordial.

Te recomiendo usar entrenadores, primero quítaselo de día y ya cuando más o menos lo domine, de noche. Refuérzalo con palabras motivadoras, si se moja, no lo reprendas, simplemente di que fue un accidente y cambialo, pero cada vez que pida ir al banio a tiempo, celébralo como si fuera lo mejor que haz visto, esto motivará a tu bebé a hacerlo solo. Algunas mamás ponen horarios para sentarlos en la vasinica, eso depende enteramente de tí, pero si lo haces,  tu bebé te dice que no tiene ganas, una buena opición es abrir la llave del agua junto a él, el sonido del agua le dará ganas si realmente tiene algo que deshechar, si no, páralo y sientalo un rato más tarde, después de haber jugado o hecho otra actividad.|`|F9GcSM4Daa	Hola, la verdad mi unica experiencia ha sido con mi hija.

PPNlNc92aa	I wouldn't be reading into it at all.  Back pain can be normal during pregnancy and as for the white discharge, I'm 22 weeks and only just stopped losing the discharge about 4 weeks ago.  If you were going to miscarry then you would probably have a bit of a headache and cramping in your lower abdomen as well as your back.  Just sit back and relax.  Enjoy the pregnancy!|`|96HWpdkFaa	No in pregnancy you get more discharge.<br>  If it's blood I'd be concerned..but white...no.<br>  <br>  <br>  If your itchy down there or it smells though you can see if you have a yeast infecion. Many pregnant women get them.|`|AA11830777	Unfortunately discharge occurs from time to time when you're pregnant. Your hormones and body is changing.

fQLeIAh1aa	caffeine free coke, ginger, if it gets too bad talk to your doc I was put on Zofran whiel pregnant with my 1st in 2004. it really helps|`|SRzswqTeaa	Morning sickness is a misnomer.  Most women do have nausea/and or vomiting all day.  I have found that most women don't eat when they are nauseous.  Obviously if we have the flu, we don't eat, because we know it will make us sick.  when we are pregnant, we feel the same way, but NOT eating is what is making us sick.  (For some women)<br>  <br>  So eat small amounts of anything you can stand.  Protein type foods are best.  If you can only gag down a couple of almonds, do that.  A few minutes later, eat an egg, or more nuts..anything.  Just start out small until you can eat a bigger meal.  Find your trigger foods and smells, and stay clear of them.  For me it was sugar - and I looooove sugar!  But I found it made me much more ill after I ate it.  I find that I have to basically put something in my mouth every few minutes - a nut here, a nut there - a piece of toast later.. a hard boiled egg, and then maybe I can eat a meal.  <br>  <br>  Vitamin B6 may help as well as ginger.  Seabands, (or motion sickness wrist bands) may help as well.  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|000cec0ed22ec167c9a8cf98303156dcaa	My sister found that during her three pregnancies, she could eat fruit loops and feel so much better. During my pregnancies, I found that a glass of milk and an apple before bedtime would also ease nausea and heartburn. If you're worried about the baby getting the nutrients it needs, try nutrition drinks such as boost. I lost 17 pounds during my 2nd pregnancy with my daughter because I was so sick all the time. If nothing seems to help, I would try talking to you doctor. he may recommend something since every woman, baby and pregnancy is different. Good luck!|`|2e602393be0dd48f37946385a6bdd5f8aa	With both my pregnancies, I was sick 24/7. I threw up day and night and felt nauseous without any breaks.<br>  With the first one, I wound up in the hospital for IV fluids for a week. I came home and lived on the bathroom floor until around the 7th month when the nausea subsided.<br>  Now, with the second, I had a child that I had to take care of so I had to stay out of the hospital. I was still sick constantly but did find that as long as I nibbled most of the day, I retained my energy. At night, I kept little snacks by my bed so I could wake up and before I moved, nibble on a cracker. Really important to eat before you move. Many things came back out but I guess I retained enough food and liquid to keep me going because I was just as sick the second time but managed to stay out of the hospital. <br>  Watch smells--for me, coffee and fried chicken smells triggered horrible sickness.<br>  Car rides, loud busy TV or music makes it worse.<br>  Stay home, keep it peaceful, quiet. <br>  It will pass but it takes awhile. My heart goes out to you.|`|AA11830777	You can try the usual soda crackers and ginger ale. It may help. If it is that bad talk to your doctor. You probably don't want to have to take something however they can prescribe anti-nausia meds. Has it been going on for awhile, losing weight? if so, call your doctor.<br>  Good luck and congrats.|`|37obEKCOaa	Take b12 vitamens 3 times a day they are good for morning sicka nd nausia

I was not allowed to self express. I had to have my hair cut a certain way I couldn't wear certain clothes.  I grew up in the 80's with the really funky hair styles and patterns cut into your head. I wanted some so bad but was not allowed.  I thought I would do more when I got older. Then I went to college and I got a job to support myself and could not do it because you can't have  funky hair at least not one that I want. I missed that time in my life and I am a little sad about it.<br>  As a parent now I will allow some self expression but there are something's I just don't agree with.  I will not allow facial piercing or tattoos   they will have to wait till 18.  Clothes can not be to revealing or tight for the girls and not that baggy baggy style for my son. I will not pick out all their clothes like my mother did till I left home.  They will have input but not complete autonomy.  Heck I let my child wear a tutu to church the other day because that is what she wanted to wear. We got some crazy looks but she was covered and she was proud of her outfit.   So yes some self expression but  not completely|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	Expression is important, but so is parenting.  How are children going to know the rules of society if one just lets run wild and do their own thing?

I also encourage self expression where ever we go. 2 years ago my oldest and I went to see The Dresden Dolls in concert (he was 3 at the time) There was a air brush-tattoo artist, my son got a gigantic Airbrushed Superman logo on his chest. He also danced to the music, sang and caught the attention of the local newspaper's photo-journalist, he ended up taking more pictures of my son enjoying the music then he did the band.  Self expression is important, especially if we want our children to grow up and be strong adults. This is both my personal and Professional opinions. <br>  <br>  Here he is expressing himself with his favorite activity (bubbles)  His favorite hair cut (mohawk) and his favorite band's tee-shirt (Flogging Molly)<br>  <a href="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y22/mirandafacette/8-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y22/mir...</a>|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Self expression is great. I can't believe that lady made comments, it really isn't her place or anyone elses to do so!<br>  <br>  I believe that if children have their expression surpressed then it will all just come out eventually, and anything that comes out after being surpressed is never good. I tried false tattoos and I even went through an awful listening to heavy metal phase...but my mum let them all pass without any fuss and thanks to that I never rebelled.<br>  <br>  I think a lot of people see self expression and automatically think that the childs parents don't know the limits, where as most do! As you said you will draw the line at drugs, alcohol, anything vulgar and that is fine.|`|nfzQkvqraa	If by self expression you mean that my son wears swim trunks for underwear and spiderman halloween costumes for clothes, then I'd say I allow it.    Sometimes he won't even respond to you unless you call him the "hero" he's pretending to be.  I think it's fun for him and he's being a kid. (he's 3)<br>  <br>  I have to add that over the weekend my kids wanted to face paint.  What started out as face paint quickly turned into let's cover mommy with all the paint we can. I had my cheeks and both my arms covered.  As well as my hands front and back.  They even made sure to dig the paint as deep as they could underneath my nails. (yay)   I went out to buy milk that way because they were so proud of their work and didn't want me to wash it until daddy got home.|`|PrJVvd4zaa	self- expression is really good, it helps your child(ren) social and emotional skills advance. When the grandma said that, she was kind of helping him feel strong, but yes, there is going to be a day in every clild's life they make a wrong desicion like drugs or tattoos. but if you help your child stand out of the bad crowd, you have to be there every step of the way to make him feel strong and to make him feel like he CAN stand out of that bad crowd.|`|IRFbj0G9aa	Is there really any other way?  Good for you!  Keep on I agree totally.  I encourage my children's self expression and just like you said, as long as they are in the parameters of the law, safety etc... why would anyone want to squash a child's self expression, people do not become independent, emotionally healthy adults overnight.  I think it is hilarious and beautiful at the same time, they have such imaginative open minds when they are little. So naive and unburdened by "social norms".  Take care and enjoy him!|`|HYveAhbUaa	The best way to get your child to rebel against you is to not let them express yourself.  Let him fake tattoo himself all up.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	When it comes to something like a fake tattoo, I really don't see the problem (and it's ridiculous that someone felt the need to say something about that!).  I'm also fine with the clothes that don't match and so on.<br>  <br>  But manners are important to me, too.  So while my kids can express themselves ("spinach isn't my favorite, thanks, I'll just have a little"), there are limits on how they can do it ("spinach is gross, why did you make that disgusting stuff" won't fly in my house....).
qMYbGqiwaa	You could try soft casseroles, diced soft cooked veggies and fruits, scrambled eggs, macaroni noodles, rice-all things that he can pick up by himself since that seems to be the phase he is going though.  <br>  <br>  my daughter is 7 1/2 mos and she wants to feed herself, but she still does eat her pureed baby food.

soFpywFcaa	wow she is very immature and has no life nothing better to do with her time.......she thinks that will make people think she is cool but in reality she is uncool i would not hang out with a Girl like that and if i were that boy girl or not she would have got it from me|`|mYb674PPaa	Its still racial! And I'm sorry but your friend is just a B****.

Plus it'll look really good on a college app.<br>  <br>  If your religious,. most highschools have a bible club.<br>  <br>  Also if you have a DECCA club, join it...it will show you necessary skills in life such as how to do taxes, checkbook ect.|`|YeMI2xwiaa	SADD club was pretty cool. My friend joined that one (Students against drunk driving)<br>  <br>  Wacko club--- went to sports games and cheered|`|V8wUAVdyaa	I enjoyed the Y Club and the Key Club in highschool -- its a lot a community service but I had fun doing it.
nzY94B7waa	Grow up, you're about to be a mother.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Forget about her...worry about the baby shes not important you deal with her because you WANT to you dont HAVE to.|`|s6stLtvLaa	seeing as how the two of you are no longer together makes no difference.  But, when you get back together with another guy you need to make sure your boyfriend is comfortable with you being friends with another man.  And, HE needs to meet these men.  My husband has 3 women from school that he talks to.  Two of them live in another stat so I have no problem with that.  The other one is coming to Sacramento so I informed him I HAVE to meet her.  I met her about a year ago and I love her!  She and I are closer friend now than she and my husband.  I know there was a love intrest with them years before my husband and I met, so I felt I needed to meet her so I could get a feel for who she was.  I can tell you, if I ever die, this would be the girl my husband would marry (and I would want him to marry).  She is exactly like me in every way....its almost scary.  <br>  <br>  You need to consider how you boyfriend feels, especially when it comes to you talking with an ex.  Your right, no one else should have a say in who you talk to....except for you and your boyfriend.|`|buoqtZeFaa	Just try to relax an remember that is YOUR child and it is none of her business what you do. You can not control the fact that your ex and brother are friends.  Just ignore her and her ignorance.  Try to stay calm at work and don't take it out on innocent people lol... Good Luck with the rest of your pregnancy.
cAtWxJG1aa	ok, i am not buying that apple thing for one second.  that is some fraud perpetrated by the health food crowd.  ;-)<br>  <br>  if there's no coffee then obviously it's time for the diet soda.  in the terrifying scenario when neither of those are available, move straight to the chocolate.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Cold shower.<br>  <br>  Running the coffee maker using the old filter & grounds are still in there from the last time I made coffee, ending up with a weak brew.<br>  <br>  Running the coffee maker even though I already threw away the old filter & grounds, hoping that some coffee-like residue is somehow infused in the plastic.  <br>  <br>  <br>  I quit coffee from the day the PG test came back positive for my oldest, until after my youngest finished weaning.

rdpZrBc9aa	See the doctor about your headaches.|`|iwYu32N2aa	cant tell if your pregnant from a headache. Did you miss a period? If so take a test. A couple of bucks would put your mind at ease.
dIW2tVxhaa	This is most likely latent phase labour- your womb is contracting to help efface (thin) and dilate your cervix. Help it out by walking about, taking warm baths and keeping fairly active :) Best of luck! ?|`|SyuGWtq0aa	It sounds like the start of labour, I would ring your midwife and check with her.|`|f16N5QWKaa	That could be early contractions. Have you felt the braxton hicks contractions yet? your baby probably is moving down but i dont think it would cause really strong pains. your body is probably just having practice contractions.|`|u0l1aOROaa	It could be signs of labor or braxten hicks contractions. You're probably starting to dilate. If it continues, even if it's not regular talk to your dr to make sure you're not missing something.

7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	From what I know about nub guessing it can be very accurate in determining the sex of the baby. I go to this website called in-gender.com and they have an ultrasound gender guessing forum whre women post their 12 and 13 week scans and the head of the forum is an ultrasound technician and she makes guesses based on the nub theory... so far all of the one's I've seen her guess on have been correct. <br>  <br>  When I went to the doctor last week & had my 12 week ultrasound, he asked me if I wanted to have the downs syndrome screening next time I come in & advised me that he didn't think it was really necessary for someone my age & with my low risk pregnancy. He said the chances of me having a downs baby was about 1 in 30,000 so I said I didn't want it... if I had known that he was talking about getting another scan then I would have said yes for sure, but I thought he was talking about getting an amnio which is something I definitely don't want to do! I didn't realize that the way they do the test now is through the nuchal scan so I am not getting one now :(  <br>  <br>  Let me know if you find out the sex!!! Good luck, hun!|`|y8b4Cp2Yaa	I had my test 2 weeks ago. From what I have read, I thought it was too early to tell the sex. I have to wait till 20 weeks. Good luck to you though! Hope your baby doesn't hinder the peeking!!!|`|HikMBVrJaa	I had mine on 3/3, at 12 weeks 6 days, and was told the baby is a girl, due to the nub, so I'm also curious about any early gender detection success stories.  I find out for sure on April 16 with the anatomy scan (assuming the baby cooperates, of course).  I've also read that a well-trained individual can make a fairly accurate prediction at this point, using nub theory, but my ultrasound tech also said not to buy any girl clothes just yet.  Basically, I'm excited about the prediction, but am afraid to trust it at this point.
k3AmV6waaa	No, because it doesn't work. If you spank you child, he won't do whatever you spank him for in front of you but he will do it behind your back. It is better to explain than to punish.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	No.  But my parents were spankers.
OQFd3pl5aa	It really is different for everyone. Most women find that they are dry for a few days after ovulation, some are dry up till a few days before their period comes. A second round of ewcm in the 2ww is due to a 2nd small surge of estrogen that happens in the 2ww. My personal experience is that I am dry for a day or 2 after O, then I start to get white cm, and just prior to my period I get ewcm. Some women notice ewcm prior to their bfp, some notice milky or lotion like white cm prior to their bfp. It really varies and is different for everyone :) Good luck to you and sending lots of baby dust your way!|`|BaXruEcqaa	I know you would  have increased CM if you were pregnant, but I'm not sure what kind.
98WKYtfwaa	I was worried about this too and my midwife told me it looks like snot, it'll usually be a big blob of it and it usually is dark in colour, red or brown usually. <br>  <br>  Some peoples can be pink or lighter coloured, but usually it's a different colour from normal discharge. <br>  <br>  Loosing it at any stage in the pregnancy doesn't mean that you're going into labour, or that labour is near. I've known people who've lost it at 28weeks and still went overdue. <br>  <br>  It just means that your cervix is starting to dialate and get ready for the impending birth, if you loose it or think you've lost it then call your midwife and let her know that you think you've lost it and so on.<br>  <br>  I thought i had lost mines as my discharge was more snot sticky like and had a tinge of green in it, my midwife reassured me that it was normal to have a slight tinge or yellow or green now and again in the discharge if there was no infection present and to have mucusy discharge. <br>  <br>  I also read from other people on here that if you loose your plug, you can loose it gradually over time and not really notice it and that it regenerates itself, i have no idea if that's true, but you might want to look into it.|`|XTuhGaL1aa	I don't know how someone can miss it but some women lose their mucos plug and don't even know it. I guess its from the extra discharge we get during pregnancy. <br>  <br>  I lost my mucos plug right after they broke my water in the hospital (I was induced). It started coming out looking brown and mucosy and then was bloody and mucosy. But yes... it is more snotty than watery.<br>  <br>  "What does the mucous plug look like?<br>  Some women describe the mucous plug as looking more like the mucous in your nose. It may look like a thick glob of stringy mucous, thicker than what you would see with normal vaginal secretions. If you are close to going into labor you may see pink, brown, or red blood around the edges of the mucous plug. This is called the “bloody show”.<br>  <br>  When do you lose your mucous plug?<br>  Some women will lose their mucous plug or part of their mucous plug weeks before they go into labor. Losing your mucous plug does not always mean labor will begin shortly. Keep in mind that even if a woman has begun to dilate, it may be weeks before she actually goes into labor. However, if you notice blood tinged mucous before your thirty-sixth week of pregnancy, notify your doctor right away. As your body prepares for labor your cervix will begin to dilate and thin. As your cervix opens up, your mucous plug may fall out. Losing your mucous plug is a good sign that labor is on its way. Though, it could be days or even weeks after you lose your mucous plug before labor actually starts. Many women do not lose their mucous plug at one time; instead, they lose it more gradually. They may notice an increase in vaginal secretions weeks before they go into labor. <br>  <br>  Should I call my doctor if I lose my mucous plug?<br>  If you are full term and have lost your mucous plug, there is usually no need to call your doctor. You may lose your mucous plug weeks before labor starts. If you notice regular, timeable contractions after losing your mucous plug, follow your doctor’s protocol for proceeding to Labor and Delivery. If you have a history of preterm labor and you suspect you have lost your mucous plug, call your doctor right away. If you notice blood tinged mucous and are earlier than thirty-six weeks call your doctor immediately. Moreover, you should also call your doctor if you have sudden bright red bleeding. Bleeding can be a sign of placenta previa or placental abruption."|`|mVD3TQkFaa	Mine looked like snot with a little blood tinge to it. I noticed it when I wiped after using the bathroom. If you don't want to miss it start wearing pantie liners that way if it does pass you for sure will notice it.|`|tYk1G8Qlaa	It does look like snot. But i do not remember when i lost mine but i it was way before i went into labour. I was over due with both of mine.|`|1WS0ojj5aa	oh you will know its gross and there is no mistaking it|`|pXSKSS3daa	It looks like a big glob of snot. You won't miss it if you actually see it but some women lose theirs without even knowing about it.<br>  <br>  I noticed mine (excuse if TMI) while in the bathroom.|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	Its usually looks like nasal discharge when you have a cold. But it can also look like a thick glob of stringy mucous.. Thicker than usual vaginal secretions. If it's tinged with pink, brown or red blood, its your "bloody show" and an indication labour is near, and bubbas are getting ready to vacate the confines of their warm little apartment.. Be aware many women lose their mucous plug with out being aware of it..
LoP2CRE2aa	I love Jade! Heather has never been one of my very favorites, but I think it has a soft pretty sound and goes great with Jade!|`|DHwPgw9iaa	Yes! I really love the name Heather.

HYveAhbUaa	yes, its possible...what will make it harder is that often times the baby isn't showing...mine had his legs crossed and the cord between them!  But I also had a US tech that seemed to really hate her job so she didn't try very hard to get him to move.  I think a good tech can get the baby to move so you can find out.  My entire ultrasound lasted 4 minutes...not long for $400, so if your is the same way, say something I wish I had.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	It's very possible. Some techs if they get a good shot will tell you and some won't because they feel it's too early. It is never 100% at any stage but when you are 20 weeks plus it is a better chance of them being right. It doesn't hurt to ask.|`|6nn7f41Faa	If the baby is a boy, possibly. A girl, probably not. We found out at 14 weeks that our son was 80% chance a boy. At 18 weeks, it was confirmed he was a boy and he was born a boy.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Theyll tell you, but if not going to be very accurate...they would tell you with more accuracy later on 18-20 weeks.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	it's possible but not 100% accurate bc their genitals haven't been formed very much yet. i'd have another one done later at 18-20 weeks just to be sure.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Genitals are formed from 12weeks, at 15.4weeks it could be visible, it just depends on how co-operative your baby is.<br>  <br>  They might be able to tell you, but i wouldn't trust it. Like you said, you'll be getting one every 2weeks, so if you get told then you can be reassured at every appt that you're having a boy/girl.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	It is possible.   I found out the sex of my twins at 16 weeks.   The technician told me that it might be difficult but my twins were on their best behaviour.   I had weekly ultrasounds so I asked again 2 weeks later just to be sure.  I have heard people that thought they were having girls actually had boys.|`|AA12375639	Not usually, probably too early to tell or see....usually done at 20 weeks.|`|84b26tbzaa	yes its possible but the baby may not want you to find out
mwYFYXXmaa	Well im not a girl but my mums bump started showing at about 4 months, almost in the middle of the belly button.|`|XIuQyB7oaa	Actually, you wouldn't normally notice it until you reached about 12 weeks, then it's the lower abdomen that appears to be swollen. Just like it would if you were having your periods.|`|AA10594269	If you are not overweight, it shows first just above the pubic area.  Actually you can feel the bump or harden area when you shower.  I have four kids and this was the same for all of them.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I was 85lbs before I got pregnant, and I didn't show unitl 6.5 months. That's when I started gaining the weight as well. Im 117lbs at 38 weeks.|`|Oq2B7I4faa	With both of my pregnancy I started to show up at after 22 weeks.|`|CrmCHVI0aa	I was 14 weeks when my tiny bump appeared, below the belly button.

At about 12 weeks your uterus will start to peek over the top of your pubic bone. (before then, any showing you see is from bloating) That is where you will notice it first. Most women don't start to show noticeably until they are about 16-20 weeks.|`|eV5E9MhUaa	It starts directly above your pubic bone... and then grows larger and upward. You'll start to show (noticeably)if this is your first probably around 5/12 to 6 months. :)|`|98WKYtfwaa	I'm small and thin, mines started showing INBETWEEN the belly button and the pubic area, as i got further on it was more noticable under the belly button.<br>  <br>  I started showing at about 15/16weeks.|`|1Du4Rudvaa	Mine showed right below my belly button.
EAeffKqSaa	with my daughter we thought  we were having a boy and boy were we wrong it kinda nice to have a little girl first.<br>  this time i just had that feeling it was a boy, no morning sickness, craving salt and sour foods and just at times not hungery and carring out front like a basketball. i also kept having dreams about a little boy. went in for my 18 week ultrasound he was moving around so much and then we got a shot f his little turttle LOL. now I have to go out and buy bo clothes. <br>  good luck to you.|`|ioZeveazaa	I knew almost in the beginning that I was having a girl....ended up I was right. =))|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I did, I was always convinced she was a girl & I was right :) good luck!!|`|QMxEjCpiaa	Everyone around me has been thinking it's a boy from the very beginning. We don't find out for another 4 weeks, I can't wait. We have hardly thought of girl names and haven't bought a single girly outfit ... most of the clothes we've bought have been boyish or neutral. If it is a girl, she'll be a tomboy. <br>  <br>  If they tell me it's a girl at the ultrasound, I'm going to cry and be upset.|`|uQc4UA2Caa	me i dreamed it was a girl an i kissed her an she started to pucker her lips like she wanted to nurse. that was around week 14 im now 31 weeks an just got a 4D ultrasound dvd done, she looks IDENTICAL as in my dream. she is so beautifull and perfect <br>  i cried when i seen her. i love looking at the pictures they did for me<br>  (i was infertile for 7yrs!!!!)|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Me and my husband were absolutely certain that it was a girl.  Based on nothing, we were just sure.  We were wrong.  It was kind of awesome actually.  There's a 50/50 chance, but we were really shocked when we found out.|`|Y4DPDmrfaa	I had a gut feeling that my baby was going to be a girl. Like there was no doubt in mine or my boyfriends mind, and everyone around me thought it was girl, all except for my mom, who was the one who told me I was pregnant even before I knew I was, she said it was a boy. So I got my 20 week US and it was a definately a BOY. lol. I was wayyyy wrong.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I've always had a feeling that I would have a girl first. My husband wanted a boy but like two weeks before my 20 week ultrasound he started saying that he felt it was a girl. We're having a girl. We had it confirmed again last weeks so we're pretty confident it's a girl!|`|v7Xvow4Daa	hmmm with my son i knew he was a boy but this time... i think because i would like a girl as this is my last child i have convinced myself it is a boy!! We have out#r US on 18th March so can't wait!!!|`|FKR45WLPaa	I had a gut feeling that I was having a girl.  We had several ultrasounds, but none of them ever showed anything about the gender.  I ended up being right.|`|758cDKEFaa	when i was expecting my son me and everyone else was sure it was a boy and we were all right!<br>  i also think im having aboy this time aswell but i have to wait 8 days to find out!|`|24e08edff6a7f457ff2fc915564d7ef8aa	Yes and with all 3 of my kids I was right.

We have even started calling baby 'Brooke' instead of 'baby, it etc'  Ill be finding out in 9 weeks what were having for sure and boy if m wrong my partner will be happier - he's sick for a boy but has said he'll love Brooke just the same<br>  <br>  A few weeks ago we were winding my sister in law up (who believes everything you tell her lol) that we'd had an emergency scan (which was true) but that we found out we were having a boy, not long after i was throwing up! (first time in weeks that happened) I told my partner it was baby's way of saying 'Stop telling Auntie Amy im a boy! Im a little girl here' lol.|`|vTtXYQqoaa	I knew from the start that I was expecting a girl.  When I phoned my mom to break the news she also just knew it.  (I phoned her because my parents live 1200 km away from us)  It is a wonder full feeling to have and it's wonder full to find out that your baby is healthy whether you were right or not.  And the best part comes when your doctor confirms the gender..... SHOPPING!!! Enjoy your pregnancy and congratulations!|`|8mxF01Psaa	We were really sure it was a girl, everyone in my family gauranteed us that it was a girl, but my first ultrasound proved otherwise! We now have a 5 month old son! lol<br>  <br>  Good luck!!
VSTRwNpdaa	Sound to me like he doesn't pick up his feet enough.If he is developing normally.I wouldn't be too worried.Unless the falling was obsessive.My sisters baby is 14 months and hes the same way.Hes always falling.That's why there made tuff lol|`|heDtLdz5aa	have you tried measuring his foot again to see if maybe the shoes he is wearing are too small? just asking because we just took our son for new shoes today and *gasps* his feet grew 2 shoe sizes...poor little guy was wearing shoes that didn't fir  him properly ( iswear he never showed any signs) but anyway i noticed when we put the new ones on him he wasn't walking as wobbly|`|SVSGUvS0aa	My daughter was clumsy too, and always running into things. She ended up needed glasses. That might be something to keep an eye on if you notice him grazing furniture.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	unless he is running into things or seems dizzy then I would say it's pretty normal, you may notice that he gets more clumsy during growth spurts too|`|CzKrqgmgaa	my son (almost 15 months) has days like this too. its not every day but some days he will trip 5 or 6 times... on nothing. not his feet, nothing on the floor... just walking and then falling... its always in the same place in the kitchen too...
htSZsds7aa	It could be gas, or the need to have a BM...drink a bunch of water and try walking...if your back(lower) hurts it could be from that. If it continues call the doc.|`|nZVTHKNwaa	I experienced all kinds of sharp, lower pains and even higher pains right around my belly button with my first pregnancy. It is always cause for concern because this is your baby's life at stake, but my doctors always reassured me that those sorts of sensations were normal because our uterus is expanding and stretching to accomodate for our baby. And your baby is really starting to grow right now at 28 weeks so I'm sure that's the cause. I'm now pregnant with my second baby and am 18 weeks along. I, too, am experiencing even worse pains than I did with my first pregnancy. When you're in so much pain, it's hard to think about anything else. But I truly think you and your baby are okay. As long as they come and go and are not consistently hurting you, I would think that is just your uterus growing again. Best of luck and try not to worry to much. :)
Jo2DfRzaaa	i have a very small world right now.  really its people i'm related to or my neighbor.  i have one mommy friend that i see sporadically and we have a lot in common.  my family -  well the majority of us share blood but other than that they run the gamete.<br>  <br>  here - i like most people. i enjoy those that make me laugh, think, or laugh.  i'm not really hard.  although - honestly that is my criteria i use in the real world too.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	mostly with my family. with my older brother mostly, we go out every Saturday night to a different restaurant trying different foods.the people are work with are just other employees and nothing special and never see them other than work. as far as seeking out other people on YA, i don't try to seek out anyone or any kind. i just answer questions the best i can if i am able to help out. I like to spend time at the local legion talking to who ever. you some fantastic people who have stories to tell and i listen to them. The older generation seem to have the best stories, the war, depression, that sort of stuff. very interesting time to be growing up in. my kids don't live near me so i don't spend any time with them. if they did i am sure we would spend lots of time doing stuff together like fishing, camping, swimming, etc.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Due to circumstance, I tend to have more friends 'like' me in real life rather than people 'unlike' me.  But that's only because those are the people that frequent the same places I frequent (church, daycare classes...ect).<br>  But here on Y!A, I really enjoy hearing and talking to people that are like me *and* not like me.

Morally..it depends. There are things i can't stand in people with no morals. Honestly i've lost friends because of this. I'm not married but a couple of my friends have been and they had kids and were screwing around on their husbands and then got divorced, and are allowing men in and out of their houses, and their kids' lives. I can not hang around people like this, and people who are my age that think the cool thing is to still go out and get drunk all the time, every weekend. <br>  <br>  I seek people who are kind of like me.. I don't care married or not married. I enjoy diversity like you do, but not "skankism" LOL|`|xVEqBjDVaa	I spend a lot of time with the woman in my neighborhood because they are about 10 other little 4 year old girls on our street!

So why not be alone it's better than being in the middle of some silly drama.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	the only people i hang out with who are not parents are people i knew before hitting adulthood.  no, i'm not prejudiced against people without kids; they just don't spend a lot of time at the soccer games, the indoor playgrounds, or the other places i seem to end up.<br>  <br>  i seek out people who are smart, interesting, and friendly.  not being the last of those is a real deal-breaker.  i've got no time at all for people who are obnoxious, whether they agree with me or not.<br>  <br>  my real-life friends tend to have a lot in common with me; i think that's what drew us together.  my internet friendships are totally different:  what draws me to people on here is that they have something interesting to say that i haven't thought of, which often means that we're not alike at all.|`|j2mRop0laa	None of my friends share a single political view with me and that's fine because my president pick won anyhow. mwahaha<br>  <br>  The people I spend time with are other parents that share in the basic values of what makes a good home and happy healthy children. That is ALL that matters to me.
AA10594269	With my four pregancies, only the second one caused extreme pain such as cramping and back pain far worse than the usual monthly pain, when I missed the first period,  Chances are you are PG. Congrats!|`|NzQH7dQ1aa	I had the same thing, i thought it was just "pre period" cramps, it felt like my body was preparing for my cycle. But, my period was late, i took a test 3 days after i was due and it came back positive!  It could go either way for you, i hope its the way you want!!!!|`|7jXChfBNaa	well i know that when i was like 3-4 weeks pregnant i had cramping that kept feeling like my period was going to happen and i was pregnant. but it could also be that your period is going to start if you usually feel that way before you start.|`|AA11830777	Take a deep breathe and relax. It sounds like menstrual cramps. I wouldn't try to take a test until 3 weeks after the missed period. Good luck|`|kyqhMuSiaa	Only a pregnancy test can tell you. It sounds like it could go either way, PMS or early preggers sign. I don't want to say anything to get your hopes up in case it's just pms BUT good luck and hope you get the result you want :)|`|2618b27ee1b1bc95bede9c4c3e930725aa	It could be pregnancy related, it could also be stress related if you are stressed at all? Take a test as soon as you can and find out xxx
S4dLfbHAaa	I wonder if being a younger child she has spent a lot of time in her buggy or car seat while you have been doing things with your twins? 2 of my friends have babies who are younger siblings and have spent a lot of time sitting in buggy or carseat as their mums have been busy with their older kids. One is 16 months and the other 18 months and neither is walking yet but both can pull themselves up to standing. It took until they were about 12 months to actually put weight on their feet and have their feet flat when they were being held up. <br>  <br>  Don't worry - your little one will get there but I think she will be a late walker (make the  most of her being where you left her!)|`|DegwrRrwaa	No all Children Develop Different. Baby's Concentrate on different functions at different times. Some learn to talk before they learn to walk, Some learn how to do move before talking. My son didn't start talking talking until he was a year and a half, The Dr said that was quite normal. he was walking by 6th months thought. I'd say you shouldn't be worried. when shes Ready she'll start trying to walk, For now she probably content not to. More mommy time :). But if your real concerned maybe you should ask your pediatrician.
s4LWmcTjaa	I feel a bit discouraged to be honest.  Our family is Christian.  We believe in the word of God and what Jesus did on the cross for us.  To hear that so many people are losing their faith or just not finding any at all makes me wonder where their hope lies.  Where do they draw strength in times of weakness?  Where do they find comfort when no one is there?<br>  <br>  I personally couldn't not believe in God.  He has seen me through too much for me to turn my back on Him.  It's even proven by science that those with religious/spiritual beliefs have better health and a longer life due to less stress.<br>  <br>  It will have no effect on my husband and my choice to tell our children about the gospel and Jesus.  We will raise our kids by the values and beliefs of the Bible.  In the end though it is still up to them whether or not they choose to follow Christ.  But my husband and I are committed to setting the foundation and planting the seeds.  I'm praying for my children even now that they make the correct choice.    I will love them no matter what though.<br>  <br>  And for the first poster who says praying to God does nothing and doesn't solve problems, all I can say is I'm living proof that prayer and turning to God DOES solve problems.  If you only knew what I have been through in my life and what God has pulled me through.<br>  <br>  I don't mind if people bash me either.  I'm not ashamed to admit that without God I am nothing and I would not have hope I have today.  I am comforted to know that my life and everything around me is in God's hands.<br>  <br>  *Kitkat, I really like your answer as well.  Good points!|`|AA11210211	Well I am an Atheist and I don't really concern myself with other peoples religious believes,some people seem to think that because a person has no religion that they have no morals and standards which is not true.People are going to believe what they want,this doesn't really upset me.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I have to make a comment to jax's momma you say  If you do not believe in anything- what is going to stop you from acting out? Most non religious people believe in theirselves so they stop themselves from doing things.We have more faith in ourself.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I'd be interested to hear why this bothers you.  How would other people's beliefs make you worry about your own children's spiritual well being? <br>  <br>  I, for one, am glad that religion does exist, for the people who need it - the ones who don't think that they would be able to resist lying, stealing, cheating or even killing 10 people if they did not fear the wrath of God.  Wahoo for religion, in that case!  <br>  <br>  And, hopefully, those who need it and the parents of those who need it, will continue to use it to keep themselves in right relationship with their family, community & in the world.  That's the only thing that worries me about the decline in people identifying themselves as 'religious' - that some of those people might be like the person who said she would be committing murder without her religion to guide her.  <br>  <br>  But, we (the religious & non-religious in society) do have civil laws that cover things like that, too.  So, I'm not too worried about it overall.<br>  <br>  ETA - So, you're equating a belief in a set of religious principles with the ability to live morally, to think of others before yourself, to be warm & loving, to believe it's right to have a good relationship with others in the world.  And, you are assuming because, in your childhood home, people who were cold & unloving, who were uncaring & immoral, were *also* atheist, that the atheism was the reason for their actions.  And, maybe it was, in their case.  Maybe *they* needed religious dogma to scare them into making good choices.  <br>  <br>  Not everyone does.  I know many, many agnostics & atheists in my life, who are awesome humanists, philanthropists, caring parents, active members of their communities, who do it because they know that this is the best way to live their lives, the only thing that they know for sure - this life that we have right now - not because they hope to earn their way into some wonderful afterlife when they die. <br>  <br>  Spirituality & a relationship with a higher power are not necessary to be good people.  It is helpful for some, but it is not necessary for all.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	I personally don’t believe in God. But I respect those that do. And just as I respect those that do, other people in other religions should respect those that do NOT believe. <br>  <br>  There’s always been a difference of religion in the States. But I just think people are feeling more and more that way for personal reasons. I can speak for myself that I was raised Catholic, attended CCD classes each Sunday, did my first communion, etc. But once I was of age (13) I stopped because my parents gave me that choice. <br>  <br>  I don’t think it’s anything to stress about. Just keep as you have been. Teach your children as you please, attend church if you please, and respect other religions, even the non-believers.<br>  <br>  While I do respect from most of you that this is YOUR belief, I have to wonder why anyone thinks you can’t teach respect, integrity, etc without God? I find that very interesting...<br>  <br>  ** ADD **<br>  <br>  LOL! I’m sorry, but I don’t need your sympathy because my not having a belief is my CHOICE. Didn’t your God teach you to respect others and to treat others as you wish to be treated? Or is that just basic common courtesy/respect? Since I don’t believe should I be “feeling sorry for you” because you’re sucked into that world of thinking God can solve your problems??|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I consider myself non-religious and i don't see anything wrong with it.  I grew up Lutheran along with my older sister and my younger brother.  We all attended church every sunday with our parents.  My sister is now atheist, i identify as agnostic, and my brother is in seminary about to graduate in May and become a pastor.  My daughter occasionally goes to church with her grandparents.  She can decide as an adult if she wants to be religious.|`|NuvKPl3naa	yes it does bother me. as for our family i know they will always be good people and love the Lord. but there are too many out there that can influence them. i dont know if this is true or not but at church the preacher said the fastest growning "religion/belief is WICA. that is a choice you make on your own, but witch craft is a bit much. i will just try to keep my kids on track and pray they dont loose their way.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I don't see how it could possibly matter.  Parenting isn't some kind of contest to see what belief system can have the highest percentage of the population.<br>  <br>  Raise your children however you wish and let me raise mine the same.|`|PW3hcVZiaa	I think it's about time.  I'm hoping my daughter will benefit, in that she won't feel as pressured into religion.  If she chooses to be religious, I will support her, but I have no intentions of introducing her to the farce that is religion.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Its the cause of the break down of ethics and morals. I don't care what religion it is. They all have a set way of behaving. A lot of parents are not filling the void.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	You cannot live their lives for them.  They have to make their own mistakes, for whatever reason.  Religion is a personal thing and should stay that way.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	I think that you mistake religion with spirituality. Anyone can have a great spiritual relationship with their God. You can pray and worship on your own. You do not need religion for that. Many find organized religion to be offensive or a hypocrisy. Do you know how many answers on this site bash catholics? I am Catholic. My religion doesn't make me who I am. And it doesn't change my relationship with my God.<br>  <br>  <br>  Amber 18: Religion is based on God's teaching not the the other way around. You can worship God without religion. If you think your religion is the only way then I say you are the bigger hypocrit. I am perfectly comfortable with anyone who chooses to follow their bible over a church. I may be a devout Catholic who attends mass but I don't need everyone else to do the same. I am no more spiritual than the person  who worships Buhda or the person who worships nature. No church or religion has the monopoly on spirituality.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	This isn't a surprise to me... it is very obvious.  I don't mind being a minority and raising my children to praise God.<br>  <br>  Society has decided that instant gratification and selfishness is the new way to live your life.  Religion involves self discipline and the ability to credit God, and respect God.  (Or whatever other deity.)<br>  <br>  Society today can't possibly put somebody (God) above themselves, and certainly has no interest in caring for those in more need then themselves.. they can use that extra money on themselves... etc.<br>  <br>  My children will be raised in a Christian household that teaches respect, integrity, and love.  It is sad that this is becoming a minority.  You can't teach these things without God... why do you love, what is integrity?  How do you teach that without a solid base behind it?<br>  <br>  *EDIT* I think the biggest problem I have is people who say they are "spiritual" but not religious... that is the biggest cop out.  All that means is that they believe some but not all of any number of religions - they make up their own religion.  It is such a ridiculous comment.  They can't have true faith in any religion so they make up their own and only participate in the aspects that fit their lifestyle.  The biggest hypocrate...|`|kM3t3iDsaa	It doesn't bother me in the slightest.<br>  <br>  My Husband is a Christian, and I am a Buddhist, our Eldest Son a Catholic. None of our Biological Children have been given a religion. Instead, they may choose to walk their own free paths in life, picking whatever road tickles their fancy.<br>  <br>  It doesn't effect my Parenting in the slightest. I am a Good Mother, and instead of teaching one way in life, I am trying to give them a taste of all.<br>  I certainly don't worry about their spiritual well being. They may choose to be an Atheist therefore spirituality means nothing to them.<br>  <br>  I'd rather Happy Children, over spiritual Children any day of the week.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	It doesnt bother me at all.<br>  I am not religious one bit, and I am not raising my son to follow a specific religion either.<br>  He will have manners, be polite, respectful, caring, honest, loving, and strong.  But not because of some religion.|`|e81f5e9fdac66f6ab45eb4396a39fb24aa	Doesn't bother me one bit.<br>  <br>  Children should be raised to be good people period - not because they have some sort of doctrine fed to them.  <br>  <br>  Praying to God doesn't fix the world's problems, nor does lack of it cause the world's problems.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	could it also possibly cause a deficit in grammatical skill? in that case, it is a bigger problem than i thought.|`|AA10063059	no worries at all,religion and politics cause more wars than anything|`|6VbNJOtfaa	This worries me a lot.  When I was growing up everyone believed in God and although they may have been taught different religions, the common denominator was the same: God is all knowing, and all powerful and he will see you if you lie/steal/cheat/etc.  If you do not believe in anything- what is going to stop you from acting out?  If I thought heaven was a myth I may have killed 10 people by now.  Religion is what keeps us grounded and helps us make decisions in everyday life.  I am worried for my son and I want to make sure that he knows God and knows what our ultimate goal is here on earth.<br>  <br>  FYI- I do not think the liberals and Barack Obama are helping.  I remember when abortion was taboo.  These days people use it as birth control.  If you can murder your own baby- you cannot be trusted!|`|6nn7f41Faa	I don't see it as a huge problem. I also fail to see where religion has any bearing on how much a parent loves their child or how they raise their child. I think it's completely ridiculous that anyone thinks there needs to be a religious background to properly raise your children.<br>  <br>  My husband and I are agnostic, but that doesn't change how we feel about or how much we love our children. It doesn't mean that we don't have morals and values. We instill these same morals and values in our children that people with religious status behind them do. We love our kids just as much.<br>  <br>  We're not going to force our bliefs (or lackthereof) on our children, but encourage them to think for themselves and do their own thing. If our children want to go to church on a Sunday with their Christian grandmother. Fine, so be it. Go ahead. I'm not going to stop my kids from pursuing a religious background, should they want one, but I'm not going to force it on them either.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Good. We need more morality and less religion. And don't tell me religion teaches morality. It does not. It teaches it's own agenda. Good is good and bad is bad it does not matter at all if there is an invisible being in the sky watching you. If you are only good out of fear you aren't moral you are a coward. I am in favor of spirituality. My husband is an agnostic, wizard with Buddhist leanings and I am a witch. Our son will be raised to know good and bad but not scared into believing some being will punish his choices. Organized religion is full of hypocrisy and corruption. We need to teach our children logic, love and empathy before we need to teach them irrelevancies such as <br>  "Do not have any other gods before me."<br>  "Do not make idols."<br>  "Do not take the name of the lord in vain." <br>  The first three ten commandments. Those have nothing to do with morality and that is what we should teach our children, not blind faith.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	That was an interesting link, thanks.  As I'm one of the parents who is not religious, it doesn't distress me at all.  But I'd point out that 15% is really not a big number, and I'd guess in certain parts of the country that number is a lot less.  The US is still very much a country of believers.<br>  <br>  If your religion is important to you, you'll surely find people who share your view and who will be role models for your kids.  And even people who are not religious at all may share a lot of your basic code of ethics, so I don't see it as reason to panic.
Sca69Krvaa	Yes she should. She is an idiot who is a slap in the face to people who genuinely want and cannot have children.<br>  <br>  There is no way in this world she can care for & support them herself.<br>  <br>  If she refuses valid help based on the inability to be on TV she should loose them.<br>  <br>  And if they do end up on TV anyone who watches is an idiot also because you are supporting this woman's craving for attention and probably the inevitable neglect of her children.  One woman cannot provide the emmotional & physical support 14 children require in their life time.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	First, no-she should not lose her children over that.  One of the people involved in this is a money and power hungry attorney who had tried to get her children put into state care before Angels in Waiting offered to partner with her.  WHY would someone accept help from someone like that?  I do not blame her at all.<br>  <br>  Second, did Nadya say why she turned down the offer?  I think that a lot of people are making assumptions about this woman.  Give it a break!  She might not have used the best logic in planning her family, but she never could have anticipated octuplets and they are here-no changing that.  Unless she is abusing or neglecting them, the state has no right to take them.  There are many, MANY people in situations similar to or far worse than hers, and we do not lay into them like this-she just gets the attention because she had eight babies at once.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	No she should not lose her children over that, but i hope other organizations seriously reconsider helping her at all.  She can't even bring the babies home until she has a safe environment for them and i can't see that happening anytime soon.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	That's....sad.|`|hAXJ47iAaa	I honestly do not believe that woman is in the right state of mind...to bring more babies into your life when you can't support the SIX you have is the most irresponsible and selfish thing she could have done. While I would never want to see a child without their natural parent...sometimes a situation warrants it....and she cannot provide for these children properly! It's not fair to them. She may LOVE them, but they cannot be raised on love alone...<br>  I just watched her on Dr. Phil...and she's quite strange!  She had NOTHING prepared for the homecoming of these babies!  It's like she has a master plan for donations...and setting up a website for yourself so people can donate...LMAO!|`|rhPCJfeuaa	Child protective services should be as involved as ever they were in a child safety situation.  If that shows neglect in any way, they should be taken away from her.<br>  <br>  I think she is the most selfish individual I have disliked in a very, very long time.  every decision she makes leaves her lower than mud in my eyes.  this latest decision just shows you where her priorities lie, and it's not with her children!!!!!!!!!!!|`|avdgNTMfaa	she should lose her children for the irresponsible and selfish choice of having them without any means to care for them...love and affection is important but it is not going to daiper and feed those babies. poor things.|`|HocTLdleaa	Tax payers are taking care of  her children regardless of where they end up. I cant believe people can get away with doing stuff like this. I feel sorry for the kids because they are destine for a hard life no matter what happens.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	yes, she shouldnt have her children til she has a house that fits her faimly PERIOD|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	yes she should, if she cared more about doing the reality series then she did about her babies well being then she certainly  shouldnt have them.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	she should lose them REGARDLESS<br>  she is off her rocker!!! she can't take care of them, they will be neglected, and having 6 embryos implanted is cruel & selfish--any health problems those kids have is HER FAULT. she can't take care of the 6 she already had!
JoCPiWLeaa	Mainly, its a womans own intuition. I had no pregnancy signs with my forst pregnancy. Goodluck to you. Go to Plannedparenthood and ask for a HCG test, which is a blood test that will be able to tell you if you are prego way before a home preg test. They are way more accurate when you want to know before you've missed your period and they only cost about $30 fpr the whole visit.|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	test again in a few days<br>  then if you dont start your period, make an appt with your gyno and get a blood test<br>  <br>  the only symptoms i had with my first was extreme fatigue|`|sY6ZI2Ooaa	Take another test because yes you could show zero signs up to three months along.|`|TCzvigiuaa	WAIT|`|A0tWlG94aa	everybodies different... some people dont have any symptoms at all...take  a test in a couple of days and if its still negative then make an appointment to see your doctor..<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  x|`|kkca9ztHaa	I am pregnant now and i had NO symptoms.. only that i was late on my period.|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	you should go and see your doctor. they can do a blood test to see.|`|BPNAcSpVaa	Everybody is different. Some show signs of pregnancy and some don't! I thought I was around 12 weeks pregnant, went to the drs and found out i was 18 weeks. I had no symptoms before and periods. Like I said, every body is different. Now I am 22 weeks, with baby #4! All of my pregnancies have been way different. Some people think that every pregnancy is a textbook pregnancy, those people are close-minded! LOL
rOfFOcwpaa	yes, by the umbilical cord.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Sometimes.  It is called meconium and it can be dangerous for the baby if the baby aspirates on it.|`|BulOiEr3aa	i did that and my mom had to go into surgery immediately after i was born or she would have died. that was almost 17 years ago and we're both doing fine. if they were prepared back then, i definately know they are now|`|llEdx8Q2aa	Yes that sometimes does happen and it goes into the amniotic fluid lol. Usually though it happens after the baby is born, the first time the baby has a bowel movement it is called meconium it is the most sterile stool the baby will have :)<br>  <br>  But the baby will probably be monitored to see if he/she swallowed it.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	No they don't. Sometimes right before birth they do have a bowel movement but not often. This can be dangerous if it gets in the baby's lungs. They don't actually poop..their waste and bacteria is filtered back through the umbilical cord and placenta. They do however pee in there. The baby swallows amniotic fluid and then pees it out. Over and over until by the third trimester the amniotic fluid consist mainly of baby's urine. Don't worry though, it isn't like our urine. It is full of nutrients and other essentials.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I can't believe all the people on here that think the baby actually has bowel movements in the uterus during pregnancy! Nothing comes out of the baby's rectum. (only in those rare cases during labor or right before when baby is in distress) All the waste is filtered back throught the umbilical cord.|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	they do in a way. It's not real Do-do... It's just dead skin cells and the fluid thats around the baby anyways. Not a big deal. Most of what they're fed goes directly to growth and there is no waste. <br>  The only issue is if the baby ends up swallowing it, it can choke when it's born.|`|V8wUAVdyaa	No it all goes through the umbilical cord.  After 40 weeks there is a chance that they may pass a stool in the womb and it is very dangerous to the fetus.  That is why most doctors don't let you go too far past the due date.|`|98WKYtfwaa	They don't eat in the womb, they just get the broken down nutrients, minerals and such from the food the mother eats via the umbilical cord.<br>  <br>  It's called Meconium and is dangerous, it's rare to happen but does, usually if the baby is in stress usually in labour or you go past your due date. The waste from the baby goes through the umbilical cord though.<br>  <br>  The baby does urinate though, it goes into the amniotic fluid and the baby swallows it again.|`|WPI0Z47saa	They do urinate and ingest it the whole time. They aren't supposed to #2 in there but it happens sometimes right at the end during labor and if the swallow this it could mean big trouble. It usually comes out shortly after birth but is built up in their colon for a few months prior to delivery.<br>  <br>  They don't "poop" in the umbilical cord. It does carry waste from the fetus to the placenta but now how you guys are thinking.|`|Ej2EOsvKaa	well from what I have read in (what to expect when your expecting)<br>  <br>  they do tinkle, and since they are getting the nutrients already digested I believe they only tinkle in their amniotic fluid! Very interesting question and would have NEVER thought of this. I am defintely going to reshearch it now!|`|aaZ0cTdCaa	lol. This is a funny question!  I do believe they have their own form of "feces" which is absorbed into the amniotic fluid. Towards the end of pregnancy, if your "water" is greenish when it breaks, it is typically known to be because of a baby's bowel movement...|`|ca9dEvSAaa	It's called Meconium and it's very dangerous. It doesn't always happen, but the doctors monitor the lungs when it does. This is usually because of fetal stress during labor.|`|MOsStEbqaa	If the baby is over due it can sometimes happen.|`|Oq2B7I4faa	Yes, if the baby is overly stress they go doo doo.|`|W0GHN2aWaa	doesnt it go out through the ambilica cord ha?|`|s4Ak6Z54aa	no if babies "doo doo" in the uterus.. there would be some serious health problems. they do pee tho. sometimes babies will have a bowel movement right before birth... but doesnt happen alot. if it does happen.. the doctors know exactly wut to do.. so no reall need to worry. technicaly they dont eat.. you eat and nutrition from your body goes into the umbelical cord and helps to creat their body.|`|XIuQyB7oaa	Generally, they don't unless they are distressed. The baby is fed through the umbilical cord and it's waist also goes through the umbilical cord.|`|nUTJYYhTaa	No. They may defecate during labor if they are in distress.<br>  <br>  And by the way, they receive nutrition from the umbilical cord, they do not eat.|`|To9hBxmuaa	yes babies do but it actually helps  thhe mother it gives her more nutrients to help give the child|`|QOb8b2rqaa	yeah i had to be cleaned out when i was born because i swallowed it :) x|`|f6qbRAmvaa	lol idk i do know that they pee in there good ?..
56q4sy3Haa	Even a very faint positive is a positive!<br>  Congratulations!<br>  <br>  Try again in the morning with the first urination of the day, it should be more concentrated and show a darker line. Or very early in the pregnancy, the concentration of hormones is still low, so will show a more faint line than expected.|`|FLOjzbKEaa	Pregnant.|`|5UkfSahsaa	I would say that your pregnant. The same thing happened to me. (i'm now 35 weeks pregnant). After the faint line, I then brought the clearblue digital pregnancy test which tells you in words.|`|RNNdRHrMaa	It's easier to get false negatives than it is to get a false positive. <br>  As the test only looks for a hormone that is produced during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Chances are that whoever took the test, is pregnant but very early on, as the HCG levels aren't high enough to give a definate line.<br>  <br>  Wait a couple of days and do another test. XX|`|8oAlBL91aa	I'm not sure how those tests are but when I did mine I peed on it and it showed up like 3 second later.|`|MNja3iwMaa	your up the duff!|`|Q05rrSX4aa	A line in the positive result spot is a line, whether it is faint or not.  That means, yes pregnant!  It is faint because it is early and the HCG is not strong yet.|`|gkXLT9Z9aa	that's a positive. a faint line is still a line. there's just not enough HCG yet to make the line dark. wait about a week and that line will darken. congrats!|`|3AXlgGgUaa	It seems to indicate pregnancy, yes.<br>  <br>  In your situation though, i would advise doing a second test in a week or so.|`|973GEZrZaa	ANY line going down means pregnant if its in the first 10 minutes from taking the test..<br>  <br>  congratulations<br>  <br>  xx|`|mFEevGRXaa	yes its positive thats what i had! a very faint positive, if not sure its correct just test again tomorrow morning|`|2618b27ee1b1bc95bede9c4c3e930725aa	Even a faint line means pregnant, congrats! You could always take another test if you like xxx|`|iPGxXRHgaa	Yes, that sounds like a positive result to me. I am on my fourth baby now & my pregnancy test results were VERY faint lines|`|kyqhMuSiaa	A line is a line. Hope it's the result you were after :)|`|HocTLdleaa	Sounds like a positive. The first test I took came out really light but when I took another one the next day the line was obvious.  I guess there weren’t enough pregnancy hormones in my urine the first time. Wait and take another one tomorrow to be sure.|`|rKCpkBfmaa	It certainly IS positive!! How many days DPO are you? Probably not many, am I right?? :)<br>  Any , even not very well visible line means - you ARE pregnant!! As the time passes you'll notice the line getting darker. Try again tomorrow morning (first urine) and you'll see :))))|`|AA11830777	Test are pretty accurate. If there's a line in the positive section I would say pregnant. Double up on the test, two test are better than one.<br>  Congrats I think.|`|jZQen1pzaa	well i just wanted to say that if there is a second line then your body is producing hcg hormones, you ARE pregnant
si770wyhaa	36FF if you're just getting bigger around. Do you think your breasts have gone up a cup size? If so go for a 34G or 36G if you want to be sure it fits. If you have indeed gone up a cup size tho, you can usually get away with staying the same cup size and going up one band size. So if you haven't gotten bigger around right under the breasts, but the actual breasts have grown a cup size, or a little less than a whole cup size, go for the 36FF because that'll be your most comfortable fit. My best suggestion would be to go get professionally sized. I'd suggest Macy's or Nordstroms. You don't have to buy your bras there, just get sized, then you can order your bras online. Good luck, hope this helped.|`|0nb1rQhnaa	Do you have a bra fitter in your area? I go to a special custom bra store where she can order tons of sizes. I don't think I would ever order online, but I am such an odd size, I wouldn't trust it.|`|xqQO81Omaa	The next cup size would be a 34G and the next band size would be a 36F. If you need to up a size on the cup AND band then try a 36FF.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
IFqY2w1Paa	That's how a lot of us got pregnant, dear.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	yes...   even if he pulls out all the way and does not ejaculate anywhere near your vagina, you can still get pregnant.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Yes- the pull out method is not very effective because pre ejaculate also contains sperm.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Yes.<br>  Yes.<br>  YES.<br>  <br>  IF you have SEX at all..you can get pregnant. Even with birth control there is always a chance. <br>  You should be using condoms and another method. (pills, etc..)|`|MbjJzs7Caa	Yeah.  There are tons of pull out babies.  Didn't you learn that in school?|`|V8wUAVdyaa	yes|`|N8SMdtStaa	Of course you can get pregnant if he pulls out. Even if he NEVER even cums you can get pregnant because of a little thing called pre-***. So I suggest you get yourself a day after pill (which doesn't kill anything and isn't an abortion pill it just makes your egg unable to become fertilized) and start using condoms and/or another type of contraceptive.|`|UFvOt2LPaa	of course you can get pregnant, hate to enlighten you but the "pull out" theory is a really bad theory. Ever heard of pre ***? Yeah the moment he gets hard, his penis will start to produce lubrication..some of that contains sperm....so the whole time he was "performing" before he finish. He already was spreading sperm inside of you! Please wear a condom, unless you want to be a mommy! Awwwwww|`|9zM6QFEOaa	yes but that doesn't mean you are pregnant, so be safer.<br>  a guy can even go in you and you not get pregnant sometimes, but if you let him keep going for sure you will get pregnant. you need to ask your school nurse about these questions for a better explanation. i'm a guy so i can't explain it that well.|`|TJ4q7X8Vaa	1 in 4 get pregnant while using that method. more if you are a teenager.|`|nZuQCN0Kaa	Yes. No explanation needed.  It's a yes. <br>  <br>  Edit: obviously it's not guaranteed you will but it's possible|`|BPNAcSpVaa	UMMM....... yes you fool!

But if you cant keep water or any fluids down, you need to go to the er and get an IV to help hydrate you.

She is going to my ultrasound today.|`|gcn11dH4aa	this question reminds me of a time............<br>  <br>  More than two weeks have passed since the federal government launched an immigration raid -- the largest single-site raid in American history -- against Agriprocessors in Postville, yet many Iowans and plant employees continue to point to documents filed in the lead up as well as personal stories following the raid and wonder what might make news headlines in the weeks to come. <br>  <br>  "I'm confused and I am sad that nothing has been done to this company," said 33-year-old Juanita, speaking through a translator in Marshalltown on Wednesday. "So many families were broken as a result of this raid. So many were charged by the government. It is bad that only those most poor and vulnerable get charged while a company with deep pockets gets nothing." <br>  <br>  Juanita, who came to this country from Petapa, Guatemala said she worked at the Postville plant on the chicken production line. She was assigned to work graveyard shift and, although she had asked for a promotion or shift change, she was refused. <br>  <br>  "My supervisor, who was also from Guatemala, tried to force himself on me in the parking lot in my car after I had asked for a job change," she said. "When I pushed him off me I began to hear that I was not working hard enough or fast enough. I am a good worker. I did my job well. It was because I would not have sex with him that I was pushed so hard. He told me that I could always change my mind and that, if I did, he would put in a good word for me." <br>  <br>  No longer working at the plant, Juanita and her 16-year-old sister, who did not wish to be interviewed, are trying to decide what they will do next. <br>  <br>  "I don't know where we will end up or what we will do," she said. <br>  <br>  The story of sexual coercion is echoed by Jenaro Rucal, who says he went to work at Agriprocessors after purchasing fake documents at the age of 13. <br>  <br>  "My girlfriend was 16 when she came to work at the plant," he said in a telephone interview Friday morning. "I had a fight with the supervisor because he told my girlfriend that she could get 'perks' if he got 'perks' from her." <br>  <br>  In addition to the personal stories that have come out in the days following the raid, documents filed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement outline a scheme that involved the purchase and registration of automobiles. An unnamed plant supervisor worked with a Cedar Rapids car dealership to provide vehicles to what was believed to be undocumented workers. The dealership would purchase specific makes and models at car auctions and provide them to the plant supervisor, who would then sell the vehicles to workers. <br>  <br>  Although the documents do not indicate the amount of money charged for the vehicles, Rucal said he purchased a Ford from his supervisor for $3,500 after the supervisor promised to grant preferred working conditions for Rucal's mother, a worker who was detained in the immigration raid and subsequently released to care for children. <br>  <br>  "Just as a matter of policy, we don't comment on any ongoing investigation," said Tim Counts, spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, when asked if stories of sexual exploitation now being told by former plant employees have been validated by government officials. "But, as I think any law enforcement agency would say, if anybody believes they are a victim of a crime, they should immediately report that to the appropriate authorities." <br>  <br>  Such responses, while truthful, have been both commonplace and frustrating for those attempting to determine how much cooperation is taking place between federal agencies, between now criminally-convicted former plant workers, as well as between federal and state agencies. Company representatives have also been closed mouthed when it comes to the raid or any of the myraid of ongoing investigations in relation to the plant. Requests made to Jim Fallon, spokesman for Agriprocessors, have continued to go unanswered. <br>  <br>  "Those who knowingly employ or supervise illegal aliens, knowing their unlawful status, are able to exploit illegal aliens because illegal aliens are unlikely to contact authorities for fear they will be arrested and/or deported," wrote David Hoagland, senior special agent with ICE, in the affidavit for a search warrant of Agriprocessors. "Exploitation can take on many forms, such as requiring employees to provide money or other things of value to maintain employment or secure better working hours or tasks, providing sub-par working conditions, failing to pay overtime, and physically harassing or mistreating employees." <br>  <br>  The 60-page document includes the testimony of several current and former Agriprocessors employees as they describe instances of exploitation and/or coercion.A former plant supervisor said that there was an active methamphetamine lab in the plant and that weapons were carried on-site by employees. The documents also tell the story of an undercover source in the plant.

7KEW7fxxaa	Ok I have had PCOS and Endometrosis for 5 years now diagnosed at least. I am currently 32 weeks pregnant with my first child and I was told that I would never have kids. I had numerous doctors tell me that and then found a doctor that specialized in it and he did sugery in may and I got pregnant in July by Clomid and Metformin. It can be done just dont settle and find a really good doctor that knows about it. Me and my husband were set in the fact we wouldnt have kids and we are having a lil boy now and I am supper excited. Good luck on trying, if you need to ask questions just email me.|`|Oz4iblUEaa	I was told at 15 I had it! I was scared to death as I was told convieving was much harder! But of course wasnt thinking about it then but as I got older! I am now 27 and have had no problems concieving if I take my glucophage as told! I take nothing else to help get pregnant. So i hope this helped at all!|`|bJodkp1jaa	Don't worry you can have children. I am also PCOS and I am 10 weeks pregnant after 6 months of trying,  with clomid on the 3rd cycle. You may have to need to follow up with a fertility doctor. But have faith that when God wants it to happen it will happen. Some people get it easier than others , be patient and have faith.<br>  <br>  Metformin will not regulate your period , only the clomid will. He should be doing ultrasounds for you around day 14 every two days to see when you ovulate and advise you when you can have intercourse.<br>  <br>  Cyts may cause pains , my mom always had them. You may need an ultrasound to determine whether or not they are serious enough or not.<br>  <br>  I am not a medical person , but I have been through all this. <br>  <br>  <br>  Last , never least Tip : Pray ! Children are a miracle from God and only through prayer and faith that miracle will happen.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck and be patient !
FLOjzbKEaa	it is normal to feel the way you do right now.  so stay away from foods that as soon as you smell them will make you like vomit.  dont eat those foods.  <br>  <br>  you must have some cravings though.  so eat whatever you desire and goes into your mind.<br>  and drinking milk is also very good.<br>  <br>  Gongrats on your pregnancy.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	7 up|`|AA10087769	Unless you are on a special diet, you can eat most foods.  Of course, with the diarrhea and vomiting/nausea, you may want to stick to things like saltines, clear soups, ginger ale, that sort of thing for awhile.  Once that passes, healthy fruits, vegetables, lean protein, whole grains, etc.  You will probably want to stay away from anything too greasy or spicy, but otherwise...<br>  <br>  Milk is great while pregnant--maybe not right now while you're sick--but otherwise very important to drink milk.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't take any medicine unless your doctor okays it.  First thing in the morning, eat a saltine s-l-o-w-l-y while still resting in bed, then let your stomach settle.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!
9QyrW2iCaa	Your daughter sounds a lot like my 50-year-old brother.  My parents have continually bought him cars over the years.  He too has substane abuse problems, is unable to hold a job for any length of time and has difficulty maintaining relationships.<br>  <br>  As a daughter of watching my parents go through this behavior with my brother time and time again, I feel numerous emotions with both of them to include disgust, anger, frustration, irritation and sometimes apathy.  My mother also claims that my brother is just a really good person.<br>  <br>  When she calls you, you don't have to sign her up for a car, give her money or bail her out.  Did you know that you can STILL love her WITHOUT doing these things?  You could listen to her and what she says, and say something like, "Yes, honey I know you need a car, and no I can't provide one for you.  I love you and no, you can't have money."<br>  <br>  If you never put limits or inconsistently place limits on her she will know that she can ALWAYS come to you and your husband for a bail out.  Because someone has a "good heart" does not make them entitled to a car that they can't car for properly.  It's like this, we all get some responsibility in life, when we show that we can manage the small things, eventually we get bigger and bigger things to be responsible for. <br>  <br>  For instance, I may be a responsible person at my current work level, but it would be ridiculous to give me the responsibility to be the CEO for the company! I just couldn't handle it and no matter how many times you tried giving it to me, I would manage to fail at this task no matter how much I wanted the position or how "good my heart was." Loads of people have "good hearts" but it doesn't mean they should have things automatically given to them.<br>  <br>  My brother hasn't changed and he is 50! My parents are in their 70s and continue to drain their savings to support him. They have now emotionally crippled him by never letting him fully go through the consequences of his behavior. He EXPECTS a bail out now.<br>  <br>  I recommend two things for you: #1 reading the book "Boundaries" by Cloud and Townsend, and #2 listening to the audio series "Loving What Is" by Byron Katie. You can get both of these used online for good prices. Your life will change and you will have the strength to love your daughter while setting clear boundaries that sit well with your conscience. Please don't continue to bail someone out again and again . . . it makes them think they're incapable and builds up resentment for you.<br>  <br>  I send HUGE, HUGE hugs to you and I am sorry that you are having to deal with such a situation. Remember, the definition of insanity is doing things over and over the same way, expecting different results. Take care and I wish you the absolute best now and in future days! = )|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	She is an adult.

Like so many parenting approaches during this period, it has fallen out of favor.<br>  <br>  There are some numbing qualities to alcohol, but not enough to justify doing it in a word where oragel and infant tylenol exist.

d87b4fac7f53e9dd399f4663d9097055aa	Flea collars ... they stink & plain just don't work.  Your best bet is to use a topical (ex Frontline Plus - very safe) that is absorbed into the skin and doesn't leave any residue.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	It is abuse to the dog if you do not get rid of them. That means everything, carpets, couches, bedding, and the dog needs several flea baths.<br>  <br>  you should have someone else bathe the dog with the flea bath, a collar will NOT do the trick, that is for prevention only!!!!|`|IWbFqtQ3aa	Please go to a pet smart or other such store and buy advantage. Get rid of all the fleas before the baby is born.You'll only have to treat the dog once a month and it's not the toxic chemicals they put in flea collars.|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	Those fleas infest your furniture, clothes, and floor.  You are touching them regardless of whether you touch the dog.  I suggest staying at a friend or family members place for a day while the house gets bombed.  Wash all clothes and bedding in HOT water and vaccume the floor several times and empty the bag.  (The fleas get caught and may live in the vaccume bag).  You don't want to worry about fleas biting and bothering the new baby.|`|hjaxuYnLaa	touching the collar is actually not a good idea, you should have someone else put it on the dog. <br>  <br>  and i agree with the others....if she already has fleas, then your house is already infested and needs to be treated. collars don't get rid of fleas.|`|X2I9Mu4Vaa	im not sure about your question, but i saw your baby is due on march 13th .. thats my b-day! good luck with your delivery!|`|5f695d303f71f12c9aae1be5319e860caa	If you're worried about the collar itself just don't touch it. Collars are basically useless since they are for localized protection only and they are not good for your dogs if they happen to get it off somehow and chew on it. Only the fur that has been in direct contact with the collar will have the flea preventative on it.
3Pmq0rUMaa	go to the prom and if your friends ditch you try to talk to some people.  find a guy that doesn't have  date and ask him out.   if you end up not having a good time you can leave.  or you can just eat some food and dance but don't look sad because you will seem more lonely.  Its your senior year, just go out there and have fun.  Get your hair done, makeup, buy a pretty dress, so that you feel pretty. then go have some fun!! if it doesn't work out don't worry your leaving this jerks anyway! so lol...good luck!|`|CEWIP3AHaa	Go. GO. GO. You have to!!!!!!!!!! Sweetie, there is at least one person in your school who thinks you're pretty. Find that person :) Do you have any non-senior guy friends you could ask to accompany you, even if it's just as friends? C'mon, prom is awesome! Even if you don't find anyone to go with, GO. Because, who knows? Maybe there will be a bunch of other girls there w/o dates who will just dance together and have fun, and you can hang w/ them. Or maybe there will be a cute guy there just for you. But seriously, GO. Enjoy the day of, get your nails done, your hair done, fool around with your makeup, give yourself/get a facial, and have FUN! No matter who you go with, the point of prom is to have one big even in senior year w/o parents, just to enjoy with your classmates. GOOOOO!!! And have fun!<br>  And hun? You're not ugly!

Ki6jlwnbaa	I can say that I wouldn't treat them any different and I would love them just the same but I have never been in the situation so how should I know. I think I would feel hurt because I'd want them to grow up and get married and have children.

I would worry about how they had to face so many that are against and consider it wrong to be homosexual...There is nothing wrong with it..It is NOT a disease or a decision,,It is how they were born, and they are just accepting it and trying to move on being themself the way they feel most comfortable...It won't effect anything on how I feel about them...They are my children and I will accept them for what they are...It's called unconditional love and we as parents should all be that way.|`|LMza4vO7aa	I don't think it would make a difference to me if it was my son or daughter. How would I handle it? Besides telling them I love them no matter what and telling them I would always be there if they needed to talk - its hard to say until I was actually in such a situation. <br>  <br>  But I think, a parent would have an idea that their child is homosexual before the confession, so I would have time to prepare the best support I could possibly offer. As each child is different and each would need different support.|`|vRodocjcaa	I felt compelled to answer since there was no answer pointing out that homosexuality is wrong. It would make no difference whether it was my son or my daughter that came to me, I would tell them just what I am saying now, that that behavior, which has been ingrained in this generation as just another 'lifestyle', is morally wrong, an abomination to God, and not something I could ever support. I would be extremely disappointed that they have to deal with such a challenge, but my love for my children wouldn't lessen. I would pray with them and for them that they overcome that desire.|`|CTE2eRgZaa	You shouldn't handle it differently depending on the gender of your child.  Why would you?  <br>  <br>  Tell them that you love them and are glad that they could share it with you.  If you have questions, ask them.  It makes them feel like you're making an effort to truly come to terms with them and understand.  Ask for some forgiveness for when you don't know what to say and are seeking understanding.|`|tu7aqUoxaa	I'm not sure how to react, I have a 8 yr. old daughter that got caught in the act of having sex.

I used to eat them all the time, soft boiled, poached, fried im not bothered but now i cant have them.|`|vTtXYQqoaa	I miss sushi!!!!!!|`|uNzFexpRaa	Snickers bars and Peanut butter Kit Kats! Im craving them but cant have em grrrrrrrrrrrr|`|ioZeveazaa	I am assuming that "runny" fried eggs are eggs "over easy" which are the "dippy" kind lol. If so then you can eat them. Just make sure that you give the egg enough time to cook through but just enough that you keep them somewhat runny in the center. They are fine though. I have eaten them alot throughout my pregnancy and my girl is healthy. I would assume liver would also be ok in small amount. It has alot of iron in it which is good but you just have to watch the cholestoral. Good luck!|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Mayo. Virtually everything has Mayo on it.<br>  Don't like runny eggs or liver.<br>  Love prawns...and their sauce but cant have them.<br>  Alcohol...Ive taken to having non alcoholic beer with lemonade in.<br>  Im soon to be tested for gestational diabetes and my diet with be even more stricter. Eating brown bread and stuff I don't like. Im fussy as it is, plus Im still experiencing nausea every now and again. Im getting to the point where food is becoming a chore.
AA11019513	Oh yes..i started giving my son yogurt when he was about 7-8 months old... i was pregnant with his brother and i craved yogurt all the time, and he got addicted to it too...its healthy for him so go for it|`|TU6hZ2Beaa	absolutely yes!|`|3bNAyb6Yaa	Yes definatly...there is a brand called yo baby yogurt...my son LOVES it, my peditrician recomended it.|`|269vf73waa	Yes!!!!|`|oXIYHsDaaa	yep, try to find one that doesn't have all the garbage in it, yogurt only needs really needs 2 ingredients, milk and bacteria so if the one you have has like 30 maybe look for a new one. Lots of fruit yogurts have starches or gelatin added as a filler.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	yes, an 11 month old cna pretty much have what you can have|`|0SHOXqb4aa	It's best to keep your baby free from cows milk and other dairy products until after the first birthday, but if he has already had milk products, including infant formula, even a little, then there is no point and you may as well give him it now.|`|7soHHu4qaa	YES!!!!|`|FQ4nhSiRaa	My doctor told me I could start giving my baby yougurt at about 7-8 months I havent started yet he is 7 months now.|`|a1uoxczTaa	yea, the people i work for feed their 10 month old it and started at 9 months.
a4LWildhaa	You are asking here ???? You actually believe you will get accurate answers? Phone you DOCTOR. Maybe something on www.WebMD.com. Still, phone your DOCTOR.|`|8oAlBL91aa	I keep wondering the same thing I would only assume it would be fine. I'll be back to see other answers.|`|NMDGxkr1aa	Yes it is ok to take Tylenol/Extra Strength Tylenol. I have a list from my Doctor's office I have taken it before its ok. the rapid release isn't a change in the medicine that's in the pill, just the way it is released into your blood stream.|`|3EiOobEVaa	I took tylenol extra strength but never the rapid release. My doctor always said that all tylenol products were okay to take. But you can call your doctor to make sure.|`|BPNAcSpVaa	I just take extra strength tylenol. I am not sure about the rapid release, the dr never told me I could have those. I would just stick to what your dr has approved you to take.|`|AA11830777	I took extra strength throughout my pregnancy. I'm not familiar with the rapid release. Call your doctor or talk to nurse at your clinic.|`|s4Ak6Z54aa	the only thing different from rapid release and reg tylenol.. is rapid release has little holes in it to help it desolve faster.. there is no diff between the two.
AA11629042	I had a little bump at 8 weeks to where youd have a hint that i was pregnant.By the time i was 15 weeks,oh the only way id been able to hid it would be wearing way to big of shirts.Id say that if you dont wear big shirts alot people would probably get the hint that you were hiding something.:P|`|7e700825133cf6328b412b5715dc6692aa	I was showing at 8 weeks by 12 i was pretty big found out it was twins as to why i was getting big fast, by 5 months i looked ready to pop !<br>  You may well be showing depends on your frame to start with |`|olUhxPvsaa	Everyone carries their babies differently, so it completely depends!  i was about 22 weeks when people who didn't know I was pregnant started bringing it up.|`|mKqofJB4aa	i will be 18 weeks on monday and you still can not tell !! i mean i am a little bit "bigger" in that area, but you cant tell its a baby. my mom hasnt even notced yet :)
1AY3Omk5aa	-2 station means how far your baby's head is positioned in relation to your pelvis. A "0 station" means baby is positioned at the pelvis but has not yet entered the birth canal. Crowning occurs at +5 station. Good luck to you.|`|MOsStEbqaa	That is the position of the baby's head to your opening. It has to be at a 0 for you to be good to go.|`|DvWGTzLUaa	the -2 relates to how far the baby is engaged into your pelvis... I cant remember if 0 or -5 is fully engaged though... So you're either nearly fully engaged or just a little bit...

b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	At most I've seen documentaries about this. We already know that babies, even very young ones, respond to touch and human interaction. They are comforted by touching, facial cues from parents, voices, and smells, even as newborns. Without that crucial interaction with others, especially the parents or caregivers, children who were neglected in this way can most definitely grow up to have problems. Maybe you've heard of children left in orphanages in Romania, etc. who are just not cared for because there are too many children and not enough employees. They often have emotional problems later on in life. <br>  <br>  Or another very sad case of feral children, who are essentially "wild," which is what feral means. One case in particular was of a child who was locked in their bedroom with almost no social interaction from the outside world or even her own family. Once authorities found her she shied away from people and could barely utter anything more than guttural noises like an animal. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_child" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_child</a><br>  <a href="http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/neglect_during_infancy_can_affect_children_for_years" rel="nofollow">http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/neglect_d...</a><br>  <br>  "Severe neglect of an infant’s need for stimulation and nurturance can result in the infant failing to thrive and even infant death. Emotional neglect is often the most difficult situation to substantiate in a legal context and is often reported secondary to other abuse or neglect concerns." -- <a href="http://www.americanhumane.org/about-us/newsroom/fact-sheets/child-neglect.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanhumane.org/about-us/n...</a><br>  <br>  ETA: It's not that babies won't "remember," it's that they learn from our  cues from a very early age. Babies can already learn to mimic our facial expressions by a few weeks old, I believe. And they can be soothed by voices and sounds when in the womb. Without that interaction, they literally wither and fail to thrive, which is probably a more psychological and emotional aspect that triggers physical development.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Well if they are not cared for properly then it will and can cause emotional and mental damages. Which is sad and no one should have to go through that.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	What?  Come on.  If you play with your baby and hold your baby and take care of all of those little wants a baby has, he's going to grow up to be a spoiled brat who thinks the whole world, and certainly his whole family, revolves around him.  It's best to feed him every 4 hours, change his diaper, and put him in his bed until it's time for the next feeding.  That'll make sure he learns his place in this family gosh dang it!<br>  <br>  Okay, so yeah, that's sarcasm, and pretty neglectful parenting, but a lot of people think that the only things their babies need are the food/clothing/hygiene/shelter stuff and feel like if they give their baby too much extra attention their baby will be spoiled.<br>  <br>  Chances are they will developed a skewed attachment to their parents rather than a secure one.<br>  <br>  You can read more about avoidant relationships, ambivilant relationships, and disorganized relationships here.<br>  <a href="http://www.ces.purdue.edu/providerparent/Family-Child%20Relationships/DifferentTypesP-C.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ces.purdue.edu/providerparent...</a>|`|9IFF0vIoaa	As they get older they may not understand how to bond with people.  They might seem distant or cold...or they could go the opposite way & be clingy & needy.<br>  <br>  The first case of environmental autism resulted from a girl being left alone with little/no care from her family.  She was 8 when protective services found her.  She acts like a baby to amuse her self (pulling her feet, chewing on things), and doesn't talk.|`|EeGgovyCaa	Don't know and am not about to find out!<br>  <br>  Besides my babies are addicting, there's no way you can ignore them. They are too cute.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	well, google ferro children|`|GNLYxY7kaa	well i studied that if a baby 2 year and under do not get the affection/stimulation/compassion that they need, they are more likely to grow up "like" a sociopath. they dont get that sense of empathy engrained in their little minds. there was a study of a bunch of beautiful blonde hair blue eyed german babies that were neglected and left alone almost always the first years of their life. a lot of people wanted to adopt them because they were gorgeous. well, as they got older the parents reported lots of problems and most grew up to be convicts. you can tell if your baby is not being well taken care of if when you pick them up from a caregiver they dont smile, seem depressed, cry when you take them into the facility happier on the weekends.......ect.|`|Y3EUTUwLaa	They develop a colder personality.|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	there was an experiment like that done once in ancient greece.. the babies were nursed but they were not picked up or touched.. as a result all of them died..

mc6YtaRbaa	You can start to see the sac at 5 weeks, can see the heartbeat at 6-7 weeks. If you call a Dr. to make an appointment and the mother is not a high risk, then most of them won't see you until 8 weeks after her last period started so if they do an ultrasound then you will be able to see it.|`|5axGfFofaa	you can see a sac around 5 weeks and a fetal pole around 6 weeks.  the first time, i saw a fetal pole with a heart beat a 6 wk 2 days|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	Probably around 6 or 7 weeks|`|iOSEVRPPaa	6 or 7 weeks.

ZYlr9TSBaa	I had my bloody show Tuesday, and then throughout Wednesday I had irregular back contractions. I also felt nauseous and was very lethargic. I wasn't checked for effacement until I went into hospital and I was 2cm and 80% effaced. <br>  I had "period" cramping, lower backache and cramps from 36wks but I delivered at 39wks 4d. That's a sign of very early labour though :)|`|kyqhMuSiaa	I was 40 weeks preggers Saw my midwife on monday, nothing. A bit of effacing but not much, lost my plug that night. nothing.

I went about my daily routine, dropping kids off etc. 1.30 in afternoon feeling a little crampy 2.30 phone my midwife I'm having a few pains. 2.50 shes at my home does an internal 6-7 cm dilated, my waters had broken who knows when but I hadn't felt them go. By the time I get out front door into midwifes car i'm ready to push. I have to hold off pushing for 5 min's to make it to the medical centre just around the corner from me.  To top it off I had my 2 year old with me who was crying at all the panic so at 3.15 I delivered my 3rd son with my second son snuggled into my shoulder.

But more than likely, people will say it like theory.<br>  <br>  Bella is lovely as well, but only as a nickname. It's become such a popular name now (especially since Twlight.

bTlhBX3daa	It's my opinion, but it takes two to make a baby. There is no reason you should have to raise this child completely on your own, even though you are not still with the child's father. This baby is entitled to the support of his father, whether this man wants to be a real daddy or not. Personally, I would not let him sign a release of custody at this point. You might change your mind later and then there will be nothing you can do about it. <br>  <br>  But when it really comes down to it, it's all about what you want and what will make life easiest for you and the baby.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Ive been there I decided to have my daughter anyway and he walked out..I wouldnt hold out hope hes going to come around...if you think you need his support get him for child support...personally I would have him sign away his rights if I could do that I would. Its less trouble even if he pays child support he may not want to  be involved. Dont worry your going to be fine and its great you dont want an abortion. Happy 9 months!|`|FcqOie0zaa	You should take a pregnancy test and see if you actually are pregnant, then you won't have to assume anymore. If you're not, you won't even have to worry about this stuff.|`|WO7WAP19aa	. . . . You forgot number 4) DONT GET AN ABORTION NO MATTER WHAT, its crawl & its a selfish act, most people regret getting an abortion later on down the track, its just not really worthit & children is a gift its lifes most precious gift, if it wasnt meant to happen - it wouldnt have, so you have been givin that child for very good reasons. to love & look after & care for that child for all eternity, not been givin to you for you just just get rid of, your boyfriend is wrong & selfish how could he get rid of his own blood child? gosh i cant believe some peoples minds, i think hes heartless.

ioZeveazaa	It could be because your intestines were squashed before and are more sensitive to food now that they aren't. So try drinking fruit juice/smoothie drinks that you get in the produce section and also the veggie ones. Bolthouse brand is REALLY good. Also try not to eat too many carbs or alot of dairy because your stomach/intestines may be more sensitive to it right now but just take tiny portions throughout the day. As far as meat, don't try to eat a big steak or anything. Go and get some lunchmeat like turkey or chicken and eat a slice of that here and there throughout the day. Drink plenty of water also. This may help to get your digestive system back into shape. Like your baby, take little steps. Don't force yourself to eat large or even normal amounts at once right now. Just eat small and continuous throughout the day. Good luck!

You do not seem to have any idea about how things work and you become a top contributor by giving answers that get chosen as best answer when the asker likes it.

Try and see if you can learn how to ride a one wheel bike (Its pretty hard) or learn how to play and instrument, but just DO NOT start playing virtual games..

5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I am pro-choice.|`|AA12152549	Abortion is a serious medical procedure which has definite risks to the woman; however, there are cases where there is no other alternative.  At the same time I have to say that no family planning agency would ever advocate abortion as any kind of reasonable method of birth control or that a woman should have one just because she wants one.  It is vital that people who are having sex make sure to use appropriate birth control measures before they decide to jump in the sack together.  Both the man and the woman are equally responsible for birth control.  If a man is unwilling to share that responsibility then he is not someone you'd want to be having sex with.<br>  <br>  In the end, the decision to have or not to have an abortion rests with the persons who are involved, not with the state.  This is a personal and a private medical matter and should be treated as such.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	i'm pro-choice.<br>  <br>  there are a LOT more reasons people choose abortions than that they weren't ready or didn't want it.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	There are situations where abortion is appropriate.  Ectopic pregnancies for example- if the pregnancy is not terminated then the mother AND the baby will die from a massive hemorrhage.     I consider myself pro birth control!  There are plenty of ways to prevent unwanted pregnancies.|`|RNNdRHrMaa	I agree with the above poster.<br>  Sometimes abortion isn't a choice, it has to be done, to save the mother's life.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	pro LIFE|`|TSxbN0Asaa	Pro-choice but not for abortions. I might understand why a woman would get an abortion depending on the situation the woman was in. For instance, if my 13 year old daughter was raped and he got her pregnant then yes I would support the decision for an abortion. If the pregnancy was life threatening to the mother then yes. I don't believe women should use abortion as a form of birth control.|`|b6sXODbKaa	if the babies born no<br>  <br>  if its like having a child at 16 i say good for the girls because hat are they having sex for at such a young age<br>  <br>  i feel like they shouldn't be breaking the law nor disobeying there parents<br>  <br>  they should hae to see how life is when they break the rules|`|98WKYtfwaa	I agree with 7.6.09.<br>  <br>  I'm against abortion when the female is using it as a form of birth control, if it's a rape case or has to be done because of medical concern then i'm for it.|`|Rc7gI1zmaa	I'm against it. I think they should just put the baby up for adoption. But it is the parent's choice.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped!|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I'm Pro-choice NOT pro abortion.|`|gkXLT9Z9aa	search this question and you'll get a thousand answers without having to anger/upset the pregnant women in this section.|`|3EiOobEVaa	i am pro choice|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	Your persuasive essay is going to be about why you think it shouldn't happen or should happen? That's what persuasive means. Be specific in your question. You don't usually write a persuasive essay to support both facts. So in this, I don't know if I can answer your question.<br>  <br>   I am pro choice because I believe a woman has a right to do what she wants with her body. I do not consider a life a life until it is viable or born. An 8 week fetus can not survive on it's own. (just to give you an example) I also don't want babies being born that will be thrown in a dumpster, abandoned, abused or neglected. That right should never be taken from us. It is not murder. If it was murder, then it would be illegal and people would go to jail for it. It's a moral choice. I have nothing against people that are pro life, but wait till they have some of their rights taken away and we will see where there head is at. Anyway, as sad as it is, it happens. Sex happens, mistakes happen, and we have to pay for them one way or another. Here in Canada, well Alberta anyway, abortions can take place up to 19 weeks 6 days. It is like that because it is not considered a viable being prior to that. They don't just pull this stuff out of thin air. There has to be facts to back up these decisions. <br>  <br>   PRO CHOICE!!!|`|dX9eDZYFaa	I am pro-mind my own business, and stay out of other peoples personal health decisions.

IwQa2zkEaa	You can 100% file for child support. My mother has full custody of me and my father pays for me. <br>  <br>  This has nothing to do with his new girlfriend. Take him to court.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	it's not worth the fight. do you really want help from someone like that? move on.|`|IE1LvgD9aa	Yes definitely! You can file for child support.|`|VBlrL1puaa	You can file for child support after paternity has been established, If you guys were married or living together while the child was concieved paternity has automatically been establish, but if you weren't a DNA test can be requested through the courts. After paternity is established stating he is in fact the biological father they can order him to pay child support, BUT if he is ordered to pay child support his rights are automatically put into place and he can get visitation to the child and or shared custody.|`|ADTtYII0aa	Yes, you can file for child support. They will establish paternity or at least setup a court order to do so while at the court. Keep in mind there is also papers you can file that will waive any and all fees associated with filing the papers and having him served. In most states you can also print of the packet of paperwork you'll need so you don't have to pay for that at Family Court. I've found it easier to do it myself (and faster) that doing it through my local Child Support Agency. I had to do all this and would be more than happy to help if you want to email me with what state your in. I'm stuck at home on maternity leave and have alot of free time on my hands.

At least that is what the websites Ive read said. However I had no symptoms til I was 13 weeks! |`|9cu82009aa	Depends on the woman, I never got sick with our first. I was sick every single day with our second from about 1-2wks, before I even knew I was pregnant, even the morning after I had her (she was born @ 3:11am) I threw up. With our third I had the usual, from about 7wks until about 14wks. With this one I was only sick for a couple of days.|`|AA10820533	It varies but usually in the 2nd and 3rd months.  My first child I only had morning sickness one morning.  The other two I did not have any.  I watched what I ate.  From what I hear from other women, you should avoid spicy or fatty foods.<br>  (I ate hot dogs the night before the one time.  LOL)|`|e8HCEZDpaa	It's different for every woman.

Yay lol. To be honest. I went to my dr at 4 weeks to take a urine test and that was it. Then she didn't have me come in for my actual 1st OB appointment until I was 12 weeks pregnant and did that pap smear then. However I saw her 2 times between then for an anxiety disorder trying to get everything situated medication wise so maybe thats why she didnt see me for OB til 12 weeks just so you know. Congrats on your pregnancy :)|`|05c7ceddb546ed497527e44fa7b066c9aa	i dont live in houston but YES i am sure that there are doctors who are willing to take you in, but you might have to put down a deposit with cash first.  MAKE SURE THEY ACCEpT MEDICAID<br>  once you get your medicaid, give them your medicaid info, and they will reimburse your deposit.<br>  Make sure you talk to them bout this first because I know someone who got cheated like that. (And she was 5 months pregnant already when she went to the doctor)<br>  <br>  goodluck|`|XrKviWgSaa	yes most doctors will take you |`|Z7P6ccuXaa	ask planned parenthood. they should help. or try other free clinics. most doctors only accept insurance. and a doctor will take you at any time.|`|mKqofJB4aa	yess! i didnt have medicaid til i was 12 weeks either !!<br>  you are fine.<br>  im now 18 weeks and see the doctor regularly
mKqofJB4aa	im 18 weeks. i will be 19 on monday<br>  from like  8 weeks, i always thought i was getting a *belly*<br>  but it would just go away, i am just now started to *show*<br>  but it still looks like fat.... everyone is different!|`|sN4jsEouaa	When your pregnant you get a belly no matter what! Stop wasting your points!|`|Zy07f0Zwaa	Take a pregnancy test to see if you are pregnant and go on a diet if you are not and you don't like your 'belly'.|`|jEB0F18faa	Well if you are indeed pregnant the belly will show eventually!
phZR63Rdaa	every child is different. children are usually ready between 2 and 3 years old.|`|SWv7QWzKaa	You might be lucky. <br>  <br>  Mine went straight from nappies to wanting big girl pants. At two and a half they could ask to be taken to the toilet.

aJLx0nhNaa	I wouldn't worry about it too much.  They experiment a lot with speech.  My son did a lot of cooing, then started to babble, then around 5 months stopped both and just made growling noises and raspberries for a month.<br>  <br>  He eventually went back to babbling, but this week all he seems to want to say is "bob bob bob bob."<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I think you may have misunderstood what "babbling" is. Two to three month olds don't babble - they don't have the necessary vocal coordination. They might make bubbly noises for fun - but babbling is repeated voiced syllables like "mamamamama" or "bububu" - it's very close to actual words. Your baby is normal for five months old - she's just starting to make deliberate sounds. She probably won't babble for another couple of months yet.<br>  <br>  In any case it doesn't matter. My daughter didn't babble, with the exception of saying "bu-gu-bu-gu" at around ten months (that's a good one in a Welsh Methodist family :) ) Didn't say "mama" or "dada". She said "guk" from about 12 to 18 months, when she started talking sentences :)|`|u4FIwBNWaa	My son did that too!  When he started doing it he was 2 months, and then he stopped arond 4 or 5 months, and around christmas he started back up again making all kinds of funny LOUD noises.  He is just being funny, and realized he can make noise...She will be just fine! Enjoy the quiet while you can, because when she starts back up it will probably be with a vengeance!  LOL|`|PQZiiomaaa	my daughter did the same thing at around 6 months.  she was saying all the little words like "dada","hi", "bye-bye". then all the sudden nothing until she started talking in complete sentences at around 18 months.  the doctors said they do that sometimes.   I put her into daycare at 13 months just to see if that would help with the talking, it finally did.|`|o2YHnKXiaa	I wouldn't be really worried babies learn at there own pace my son was just like that and now at 7 months old he says mama or mum it's normal.
5O0HnfQaaa	my health nurse told me it usually takes about a week for the birth control to enter/leave your system. and it was just February (28 days) so that could be the problem :)|`|WrOvFyBgaa	yes. if you even miss one day at a different time from when your normally take them your chances of pregnancy increase drastically. I was on the pill when i became pregnant. apparently a study that the free clinic i go to has seen only a 50/50 chance of the pill working. i'm not sure how that if the women have missed days or what. but i do know that i only missed one day and now i'm 9 weeks pregnant - but heres the thing the calculated day of conception wasnt the day i forgot to take my pill!
l3lhcRDcaa	It is possible that cysts can affect the results but it is exceptionally rare for this to happen. If you have had 8 positive tests then I think you can take it as 100% that you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!|`|LMza4vO7aa	It can effect the pregnancy test. The best thing to do is to go to your doctor and ask for a blood test. Its the only way to know 100% sure.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
5Jn3Wkbeaa	No, but whoever said 'sperm cannot survive outside of the body' doesn't know what they are talking about. Uh, how would men give sperm specimens??|`|AA10700407	I seriously doubt it.|`|lLAjT8mjaa	No, sperm can't survive outside of the body... well, unless it goes directly into your vagina. It hits air and it's useless.|`|CRJKQ6hCaa	uhm....no.

JNoJWcFvaa	There are a lot of older ways to do the tests, but none that you would want to do in this day and age.<br>  <br>  A urine test is non-invasive and although the chemicals are on the pee-stick, they do not come in contact with the body and will not harm you or your baby.<br>  <br>  The dollar store has some pretty good tests from what I hear for only $1. Walmart has ones that are around $4.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hubpages.com/_rkut/hub/Home-Remedy-Pregnancy-Test" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/_rkut/hub/Home-Remed...</a>|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	How long is your cycle?  If you have a 30-day or shorter cycle, it is fine to test now.  Use first morning urine.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You should be able to take it now. Make sure you use your first mornings urine though.|`|LMza4vO7aa	You can test now - most test allows 4 days before period is due.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|1u2YmEJsaa	u should be fine to take a test now|`|NiweOaGJaa	Any time u plz u waste money
oA8Rtyxuaa	its possible. if there was no protection used and his penis was inside the vagina, there is always a possibility of getting pregnant. Its called premature ejaculation where ejaculate (sperm) comes out before her he really "cums". use protection!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Yes you can.  Precum contains sperm.|`|AA10809039	Absolutely this is possible, since there are sperm in the Cowper's gland fluid (pre-***).  Also, you are putting yourself at significant risk for sexually transmitted diseases including HIV, Hepatitis C, genital warts, and herpes by not using a condom.  It is time for you to decide if you are grown up enough for sex or not.  If you are, then you should be mature enough to procure and use condoms.|`|rUPjr7hjaa	Yep - it's possible.<br>  Not very likely ... but it absolutely can happen.|`|xpstigPTaa	didn't you already post this dumb question?!?!? yes, grow up troll.|`|5Jn3Wkbeaa	maybe you should check the last question you posted...|`|Ir3XPq4raa	Hell Yes you can... What were you thinking?????<br>  <br>  DONT listen to 'woodenha...' It is more then likely...First comment is spot on!!!!!!!
uuHPneEcaa	Wow ur 16 years old and took the morning after pill 3 times. Child get on birth control and have him wear a condom.. U need to go to the doctor.  It could be implation blood.. it wouldn't be heavy.. maybe ur on ur period who knows.. but u need to go to the doctor.<br>  <br>  do u know how many STDs are out there these days. Some can be cured some can't.. u need to always u protection ALWAYS!! and get on birth control morning after pill isn't birth control.. that could seriously mess u up big time.<br>  <br>  then it could be ur period.. GO to the DOCTOR seriously. it could be something more serious.|`|mY19PPlIaa	The only way you could know if your pregnant is by taking a test. I doubt you are if you took the morning after pill 3 times.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	stop having unprotected sex. "this is my third time taking it" this isn't a form of birth control. use a condom.|`|DVJoW71saa	So, when are you young ppl going to learn that sex = baby?!?|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	u probably have some type of infection.  U need to get to the doctor and get check
CE3bmj65aa	If you are talking about going poop then this is normal if he is breastfed.  My son is breastfed and he sometimes goes 5-8 days with out pooping.  If he is not breastfed or doesn't go in the next couple of days I would call the dr and ask them about it.  Some ways to get him to go are to take his rectal temp, tickle around his butt with a Q-tip, or give him a tiny bit of water.  These can all stimulate a bowel movement, but not guaranteed.
U1pMvDvgaa	Maybe, but I would find out what color the mailmans eyes are just in case.|`|4PPRsXpjaa	yes
SEzIkGNiaa	It all depends on where you live.  If you go to your community center, you could see if they have any parenting programs that you could attend.  You could also try going to your library and rent some parenting books.|`|FNVbetnqaa	um correct me if i'm wrong but does your question say that you are six years old and have a two year old son/daughter?|`|rPHZ9M2yaa	i dont really get this question<br>  plz explain more
obN6p3Cgaa	Consult your doc Good luck...........|`|rdpZrBc9aa	If you are pregnant and want to survive an abortion, get it done by a doctor.<br>  <br>  The morning-after pill must be taken within 72 hours of intercourse.  It prevents implantation IF there is an embryo.<br>  <br>  Don't have unprotected sex unless you want a baby.
46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	Your numbers look fantastic. Around the fifth week a normal pregnancy can have an HCG reading anywhere from 18 to 7340 miu's of HCG. You are in a very very good spot in that spectrum. I know if they were my numbers I would be over the moon happy. <br>  Its normal for all the tugs and feelings going on in your belly. Youre probably going to feel a lot more of them as the weeks go on, as your baby grows. A lot of this is ligament pain, which is basically your uterus stretching to accommodate your growing baby. <br>  Congratulations on your pregnancy, sounds like its very very healthy!|`|MkKvGdxKaa	Your levels are very good!!!! Some pregnancies are still only in the 100's at this point and are still perfectly healthy.<br>  Congratulations!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Found this site for you to have a nosey at. On here even a reading of 18 is normal at this stage!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/duringpregnancy/hcglevels.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.org/duringp...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|6nn7f41Faa	You're a mommy now. You're always going to find things to be paranoid about. Your levels are fine. What really matters is how often they double, not what they start and end at. As long as they double at least every 48-72 hours, your pregnancy is sustaining itself. Once you hit about 10 weeks, your levels will begin to drop and level off, and at 12 weeks, the placenta takes over sustaining the pregnancy to the end.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
MkKvGdxKaa	Yes, it is possible you are pregnant now. But please dont waste a lot of money on hpt's at this point. even the ones that say they can tell 7 days before etc. They are a waste of money. as a negative never really means a negative at this point, and a false positive can occur. Only a few fertilised eggs at this stage lead to a full pregnancy. Our bodies deal with this more often than you think, a positive now could still lead to your period arriving on time and without incident. This would not be classed as a miscarriage. Save the heartache, wait.|`|5axGfFofaa	I was SUPER dizzy.  I knew something was off b/c things like the tv were spinning.  I got a positive with dollar general ($1) test 10 days after ovulation...confirmed next day with digital|`|SyuGWtq0aa	Some of the home pregnancies test claim to be able to tell you are pregnant on the day your period is due. Use your first urine of the morning to get the most accurate result.
MQ51kF4Aaa	Who cares, buy some beer and get them started yourself. Get them to invite their friends over first. Start telling them of all the embarassing things that you did when you were drunk and then get drunk yourself. They will be so embarassed by what you have done and how badly the alcohol has made them behave that they will be put off drinking for life.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Can you stop them?  No.  Hopefully you will have done a good enough job over the last 18 years that they will use common sense and good judgement while they are out celebrating, and call a cab if they need to, or call you.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Sit them down and have a long, serious discussion about alcohol. Talk to them about the dangers of it, talk to them about different reasons why people drink (to be socially accepted, to be more outgoing at parties, etc). Talk to them about why exactly you are against them drinking. Talk to them about responsible drinking - including why it's not safe to drive and that if they drink they should always have a sober person around. Warn them of the dangers of alcohol poisoning. <br>  <br>  Don't approach the conversation with a "No Drinking At All" slant, approach the conversation with "Ways to Drink Safely" in mind. <br>  <br>  You CANNOT stop them from drinking unless you intend to be with them 24 hours around the clock. But you CAN prepare them for what to expect. Be realistic. Young people drink, or at least experiment with alcohol. So arm them with the information they need to make sure their experience isn't dangerous or life threatening. Good luck!|`|lIe2GpMuaa	I put my momma through the same thing. What you can do and what sends the biggest message, is to explain to them why you don't want them to drink, and explain THAT YOU KNOW THEY ARE ADULTS, but you still care for them as if they where little kids. I hope this helped. PS I will be turning twenty one on April 15th and my  mom is against me having an odd drink.|`|CTE2eRgZaa	Buy them their first round.  I'm serious.  By showing them that you're ok with them drinking, you keep them from sneaking around and doing something more dangerous.  <br>  <br>  That being said, make sure they know how to drink.  Make sure they know what their limits are and that they should eat beforehand and stuff.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	At first I thought you were posting from the US - and the simple answer would be to have them arrested... since it is illegal.<br>  <br>  However in your case, you aren't trying to discipline, you are just trying to advise your kids.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, they have reached the age where your advise is the last thing they want to hear... I think parenting at this age is almost more challenging than any other age.  How do you give advice when they don't want it... and they don't have to take it?<br>  <br>  Sometimes they'll listen to other people more than mom - church friends, neighbors, anybody other than you.  In addition - they can't drink if they can't pay for it - so if you're giving them money that can stop right away... however if they have a job then it is their choice to spend their money on their own choices.<br>  <br>  The other option is if they want to act like adults then treat them like adults... have them start paying some bills (rent, groceries, etc) and then their hard earned money will have to be spent on realistic things rather than fun - and they will learn a lesson... however this doesn't stall them from growing up - it rushes them into an adult world...<br>  <br>  Good luck!
yBxEyToZaa	not to sure hun, my waters went and then i just got really bad contractions, so dnt really no. but i do remember havin loads of bowel movements, that day.
UU1YR1Kaaa	You can tell immediately after possible conception.  Good luck keep the baby or set up adoption, but do not abort. Because the child you have inside is a life no matter what the dumb people say!  At six weeks the child has a brain, and a heart.  Congrats if you are!|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I'd take one a week after a missed period...any sooner and you may get a false positive.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	You can test three weeks after unprotected sex. SO I say buy a two pack pregnancy test. Use one today and if it says negative then wait another week and use the second test.|`|6LxXR61Waa	You can take a pregnancy test the first day that you miss your period.  It will PROBABLY be accurate, but if it says negative and you still don't get your period a week later, then take another one.|`|OMTSqrSFaa	a week <br>  <br>  good luck <br>  <br>  i hope you get the answer you want x|`|piCMW7ZCaa	What are you waiting for??? go take one now!|`|hbjbm3SRaa	You can actually take an early response test now. I like the clear blue digital or the early response gold digital because it's just so much easier to read "pregnant" or "not pregnant" instead of trying to see those stupid lines. My period was due on Friday and I took a test on Friday and it came out "pregnant" I had actually even taken a test a couple days before that with one of the "lines" test and it came out really, really, really faint so that's why I go the digital one. You might need to be a little worried but you can go ahead and take a test. Good luck.|`|C8YOQfYZaa	You can take one now, but to be sure that your test is right i would wait at least one week before testing... or you can test now and then test again in a week if it is neg.... Because if you test to early you could get a neg. and still be pregnant. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|do8pdlluaa	Do a digital test a week after you are late.

Its just the the baby is asleep. they have there days where they decide they want to move and some they are just lazy =-) try drinking orange juice, soda, ice cold water or candy, that should get your baby moving.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	Just like you, the baby will have active days and non active days.  If you are really concerned about the movements of the baby then call your doctor.  OR you can try simple at home remedies such as drinking a tall glass of orange juice and laying on your side.  That should get him moving for a few minutes.|`|MSfC0FXvaa	the baby sleeps, just like you and me. :) since you were sleeping, shes probably still sleeping, even though you just woke up. she must be relaxed. :) so dont worry. you'll worry your day away thinking about that kind of stuff. i sure do.|`|J3IRUUQhaa	The baby is going to have very active times and still times.

That said, I would not make abortion illegal.  If it was up to me, I would try to reduce the number of abortions by supporting mandatory sex education in schools that included information on contraception;  I would make contraceptives more readily available and lower in cost; and I would make it easier for women to collect child support from fathers of their children if they chose to keep a child.  <br>  <br>  When I was pregnant with my daughter 17 years ago, a co-worker was pregnant at the same time with her second child.  We used to compare notes on our pregnancies.<br>  <br>  Approximately 20 weeks into her pregnancy, she started having seizures.  She and her husband went to the doctor, who diagnosed pre-eclampsia and prescribed some medication and dietary changes.  <br>  <br>  It didn't help.  She continued to have seizures.  Approximately 23 weeks into her pregnancy, she had a major seizure which caused her to fall onto a glass-topped coffee table.  She suffered some severe cuts and had to go to the ER.  At the ER, her husband insisted that there was something more than pre-eclampsia going on and he literally bullied the doctors into having a neurological specialist examine her.<br>  <br>  It turned out she had a fast-growing malignant brain tumor.  <br>  <br>  Neurological specialists and obstetrical specialists consulted on her case, and she and her husband were presented with these choices:<br>  <br>  1.  Do nothing.  The seizures would worsen and the greatest probability was that she would lose the baby and die herself, since the tumor was near the brain stem.  <br>  <br>  2.  Proceed with surgery and chemotherapy while trying to maintain the pregnancy.  Highest degree of probability, verging on certainty, was that she would lose the baby and die herself from complications.  The doctors gave her no chance of maintaining the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  3.  Abort the pregnancy, then proceed with treatment.  This offered her the best chance of good-quality life for the longest period of time.<br>  <br>  After much soul-searching, she and her husband opted to abort the pregnancy and proceed with treatment.  They did this because they felt that it was important to their firstborn, a daughter who was at the time just short of 4 years old, to have the time with her mother.<br>  <br>  She had the abortion and went into treatment for the brain tumor.  It was grueling but the doctors were able to shrink the tumor and slow the progression.  She got four years of good quality life before the progression of the tumor couldn't be stopped and after about six months of declining health, she passed away.<br>  <br>  I would never, ever presume to sit in judgement on someone faced with the choices this woman faced.  I would not presume to deny her the choice she ultimately made.  You better believe that when I think of her, I thank my stars that life has never dealt me those kinds of cards to try to play.<br>  <br>  I believe that women should always have the option of a medically safe abortion.  People who find the choice of abortion repugnant are free to not have one.|`|79eRDIbXaa	Rape, Drug  or Alchol Addiction - Then I think abortion is the best option. <br>  <br>  One Night Stand - I personally would not be able to have a baby with someone I was not in a relationship with and didn't love.<br>  <br>  Other reasons such as - Those in a relationship using it as Birth Control I think is disgusting!!! and those Girls/women that are not using any contraception and get pregnant then I don't agree with it either. <br>  <br>  I think it depends alot on the situation but most of the time women just use abortion as an easy way out and I don't agree with it.<br>  <br>  There we go, my opinions, bet I get loads of thumbs down specially from those that have had them.|`|htSZsds7aa	I am pro choice..and if a young women was stupid enough to get pregnant and wasnt planning on it and has no means to take care of it abortion should be an option.

bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	If you have a truly predatory cat (one who would eat the hamster if it could get it out of the cage) then it's up to you to keep the cat in it's place (in the other rooms in the house) and the hamsters in their own room.  The easiest way to do this is to simply shut the door ... which may not be a good thing since the hamsters belong to a three year old.  I like your idea of using velcro to hold the cage to the shelf ... but be VERY careful that you use a glue that will 'hold' one side of the velcro to the bottom of the cage, and use a different glue to hold it to the shelf.  I know that may seem to be 'basic' but in fact there are many different types of glue and not many of them will hold the 'plastic fabric' to the 'plastic or metal' of the cage, and also to the 'wood/ wooden by-products most shelving is made from.  Read the 'glue' you have (hopefully you kept the packaging, since most 'glue' is far too small to actually read the 'bottle/tube' it comes in) to be absolutely sure the velcro is 'sticking properly' to both sides, or the velcro will just come 'unglued' when the cat wants the cage 'down' where it can get in to catch the hamster.  Good luck!|`|uCnmYEPBaa	I think securing the cage to the table or bookcase is a good start. Make sure you have the tight locking lid so if the cat does knock it off the lid won't come off and the hamster will still be safe.<br>  When you see the cat near the cage tell it no and give it a quick spray of water, (the best thing to train a cat with) Be consistent and hopefully the cat will eventually realize that everytime it's near the cage it will get wet and it won't like it.
e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	leaking can happen up to a year after a baby is born. Even if you dont breastfeed. Your ducts just dont automatically shut off. They still make some milk especially if you have hormones still floating around. It can happen cause your period is not regular yet and your body is getting back to normal still. I'd say your not and just relax. If you dont get the period next month then I would re-test. If you think you have a chance of being pregnant, then just treat yourself well as if you were till you know your not.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	It's either too early to know, or your not pregnant.  Give it another week or so, and retest.  Or make an appointment with your doctor.|`|txv7TIgiaa	you could be irregular from having the baby and from stopping breastfeeding...so go to the doctor and get a test and go on birth control and use a backup just to be sure...that is what we do, but i am also still breastfeeding...|`|OBU1eDUHaa	Your body is still adjusting to all the changes in hormones.  I would call the MD and ask what they think.  Good luck.|`|fsDof9pgaa	Could be that your hormones are a little bit crazy.  Definitely call your doctor.|`|SdVrwd6daa	take a hpt just to be sure.
eF6HTt0gaa	We havent, though our parents have both said we should its like why, they watch enough of it they dont need it in their room where thats suppose to be a quiet place and not for chaos.|`|qSmCA82Aaa	All of my children have TV's in there room with DVD players - they also have the kid version of Wii's.  I grew up with one in my room and don't see any problem with it.  My father was a cable guy (still is) and I also use to sell cable so that could be a reason as to why I guess but like I said I really dont see any problems with it.  My daughter comes home from school and does her homework and then her and her brother play outside or whatever and if there room is clean and everything is done and they choose to watch tv or play a game that is fine with me.   Having a TV in my room never made me lazy like some of the people said on here.  I was a cheerleader, played basketball and softball and also worked through highschool and maintained my 3.5 GPA.   <br>    I'm not trying to come off as defensive or anything just giving you my viewpoint and expierence.|`|2pxiK9waaa	Because lots of parents sat and held and rocked their babies to sleep until they were 3, then realized the only way to get out of that habit aside from letting them cry it out was to put on the tv and hope their kid falls asleep. <br>  <br>  I agree with those studies--tvs in bedrooms overstimulate and mess with sleep cycles. There comes a point when your child needs to learn to fall asleep without the assistance of anyone or anything else.<br>  <br>  It's one thing to have rules like daytime use only, but never at night.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Because both of my children do well in school---they're both honor roll students. They're also well behaved, and give me any extra help around the house when I need them to with zero lip.  Even with televisions and Nintendo Wii, there are still limits to how much time they spend on these activities. Not everyone who allows their children these luxuries is doing it for the purpose of having a "babysitter" for their kids.  The fact of the matter is that my children spend very little time in their rooms---they're usually out doing other things----like playing outside, which is unheard of for vidiot kids.|`|942758fd1ed500339f1a1e8db65b2d27aa	Well, everyone has their reasons. My girls are almost 5 & almost 7 & they have a tv in their room. It's a tv/vcr combo, no cable & no game system. They can ONLY watch videos & the rule here is the tv does not come on unless it's during the day or if there isn't school the next day they can watch a movie at night. They an't get regular tv in there though, jsut the movies & no movies on school nights. It works well for us.  Technichally my 3 week old has a tv in his room too, but he shares a room with me & DH. Not like he's watching it or anything.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	My daughter will NEVER have a TV in her room, nor will she have a computer or a gaming system.  When she is old enough to get a job and work to purchase these items than she can have them in the privacy of her own room.  Until then all TV viewing, game playing and internet surfing will take place under the watchful eye of her father and I.  This is our choice and we make no apologies for it!|`|s4aX6bF6aa	some people will say it calms a child down enough that the child will go to sleep quickly...but i say that's wrong...all it does is stimulate the child more and keep the child from calming him/her self down to go to sleep on their own...the bedroom is no room for a television set...a kid needs peace and quiet to go to sleep...not the ramblings of little foot and all his dinosaur friends or even mary poppins.|`|K5Wr8Mcaaa	I have a young son and he has a tv in his room because he loves watching the baby einstein videos. I'll usually put the video on before he goes to bed and he falls asleep listening to classical music. <br>  I see nothing wrong with it.|`|35996551fa1b3e6d37f4ae1e44b2bb65aa	This will probably tick you off but my 16 month old son has one & a DVD player. I baby proofed his room and bought a child gate for his doorway. When I am making dinner, or in the shower instead of locking him up in a play pen, he plays in his room and watches elmo for some background noise. He loves the show and it lets me get some things done around the house.<br>  <br>  I see nothing wrong with occasional use!|`|52f4d67a2e52b2bcd540d372b2b3c222aa	What is "young" to you?  My daughter is 8 and will get a TV put in her room this Fall.  She's getting it because she's a good student in school and a good girl overall....she really wants it, but TV time gets cut off at 9:00pm (just like TV time in the family room for her).|`|drzkJ9ouaa	I have a TV  at my home but have no cable connection.I buy cartoon ,educational DVD's.And as soon as my son completes his daily studies I put on the DVD's fr half an hour to 1 hour...Next year I would have cable connection..|`|os1ydh2daa	There are some very educational television shows that help them with alphabet, numbers, spanish, colors ect..|`|BbGuYYEGaa	They wanted it, so I bought it for them.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	I never had a tv in my room either. However all 3 of my kids have a tv in their rooms.  They also have video games in their rooms.  The also have PSP and nintendo DS to play with on the bus or in the car.  Now why do they have that?  Simple they are high honor students so TV has zero effect on them.  My kids watched tv alot when they were toddlers.  Again, they ended up high honor students in school.  Now, they very rarely if ever watch tv.  But they like to watch different programs than each other, hence the tv in their room.  They really have no time for TV anyhow, but if they want it, the option is open.|`|AA11210211	I let my son have a tv,dvd player and a vcr in his room he is 3 1/2,I don't really care what studies say,I have have seen NO negative effects of having a tv in my sons room.I do this because I want to, children need entertainment and this is one of the ways I allow him entertainment,I still read to him and play one on one with him.I do what I feel is good for him not what some general society says.|`|LVZdzPmpaa	I think there are two basic reasons:<br>  <br>  1. The parent grew up wishing for a t.v. in his bedroom and considers it the height of luxury and indulgence. So he gives his child that of which he was deprived. (I am going to spoil my child in what I wish I had been spoiled!)<br>  <br>  2. It's a way to get a kid out of your hair. They can go into their own rooms and watch what they want, play video games and you don't have to be bothered with them|`|oojO4WAraa	Mostly becuase they are stupid and lazy.  And they over indulge their children.|`|AA12352550	Because most parents are too lazy to deal with their children the right way!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	because they want to.  you know that whole creating life thing gives you that right to make those choices.

CwNMq7RTaa	Tell her that her Mommy is in Heaven with God and that she won't see her for a long time but someday she'll be in Heaven with God too and then she'll see her Mommy again.  By the time a few years go by she'll begin to get that her mother is dead.  But she should grow into understanding it slowly so she doesn't get completely depressed.  If she questions these concepts tell her God is the invisible man in the sky who made everyone and that Heaven is way way up in the clouds where He lives.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	oh my gosh I wouldn't even know where to begin to tell such a small child her mommy isn't coming home....ok I have to go now this broke my heart.<br>  <br>  Well gee forgive me I had to go collect myself...one of my greatest fears in leaving this earth before my daughter is an adult.  I can't even imagine.  I'd tell the child that her mommy had to go live with the angels in heaven.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	Tell her that her mommy had to go live with the angels and that she in an angel now too and she will always be with her watching over and protecting her.  Tell her that when ever she wants to she can look up at the sky and talk to her and her mommy will hear her, explain she can not talk back but she will answer her in her heart.|`|yKS2UI87aa	If you believe in God, I would say God loved your mommy so much and she was such a good person he decided to make her an angel. Tell her she can still talk to her if she wants. So sorry for your loss.|`|t0LYDKWyaa	Well, My friend told me her uncle died just before christmas and they told her cousin (4) that he had gone to stay with Grandpa but, he loved her very much and he was going to live with the angels in the sky now and he was living on the clouds! I though it was good that they related it to another person who had died (granpa James). The only problem was a while later they went on holiday to america and she asked if they could go via Daddy and Grandpa's cloud so they could come too! Don't know how they delt with that!|`|Nhje1U06aa	Wow - that is heartbreaking! I am so sorry for your loss!  Tell her she went to a better place either heavan or the sky depending on what you believe.  Let her know that when the wind goes through her hair  and the stars in the sky or the raindrops that  will hit her face  our her mommy - that she is always there even though you can't see her. tp protect her and guide her .  Also get her to go to a therapist or counselor it will help her to get through this now . It will just get worst as she gets older|`|7urRIYMbaa	i would start off like this:<br>  <br>  (daughter's name),<br>  something happened to mommy.<br>  she's gone to an amazing place where <br>  she can play all day long with the angels<br>  and have alot of fun.<br>  she's not coming back home, but i want you to know <br>  that she is up in the sky looking down on you smiling<br>  and watching what a good little girl you are.<br>  she loves you and i know you'll miss her, but she<br>  is in a better place.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  im sorry about your loss.<br>  best of luck.<br>  paige.|`|evEJxv06aa	will this will be heart breaking but take her to a nice place and tell her that her mom was so so sweet and kind and lovely that god decide to make her a angel in heaven you can still talk to her by looking at the stars at night and that she will always be in our hearts forever and ever.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	oh wow... well I suppose it would all depend on what you believe in but I would say "your mommy had to go and live with the angels in Heaven<br>  ' and then explain why...

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	If a 7 month old wasn't getting enough to eat, you would know.  They aren't going to quietly starve.<br>  <br>  Your nipples may be sore because she has "late" nipple confusion.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/pumping_decrease.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/pumpi...</a><br>  What is normal when it comes to pumping output and changes in pumping output?<br>  <br>  Most moms who are nursing full-time are able to pump around 1/2 to 2 ounces total (for both breasts) per pumping session. Moms who pump more milk per session may have an oversupply of milk, or may respond better than average to the pump, or may have been able to increase pump output with practice. Many moms think that they should be able to pump 4-8 ounces per pumping session, but even 4 ounces is an unusually large pumping output.<br>  <br>  It is quite normal to need to pump 2-3 times to get enough milk for one feeding for baby (remember that the pump cannot get as much milk as a baby who nurses effectively).<br>  <br>  Many moms are able to pump more milk per session when they are separated from baby. Milk pumped when you are nursing full-time is "extra" milk -- over and beyond what baby needs. Don't get discouraged if you are trying to build up a freezer stash when nursing full time and don't get much milk per pumping session -- this is perfectly normal and expected.<br>  <br>  It is very common to have more milk than baby needs in the early weeks, which regulates down to baby's needs over the first few weeks or months. When your milk supply regulates (this change may occur either gradually or rather suddenly), it is normal for pumping output to decrease. For moms who have oversupply, this change often occurs later (6-9+ months postpartum rather than 6-12 weeks).<br>  <br>  It is normal for pumping output to vary from session to session and day to day. Having an occasional low volume day is not unusual.<br>  <br>  During a growth spurt, don't be surprised if baby drinks more expressed milk than usual, making it harder for mom to provide enough expressed milk. Growth spurts are temporary - try increasing nursing and adding a pumping session or two at home until the growth spurt is over.<br>  <br>  Menstruation or ovulation can result in a temporary drop in milk supply. You might also notice cyclical dips in milk supply before your period returns, as your body begins the return to fertility. Hormonal changes also cause milk supply to decrease during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Remember that the amount of milk that you pump is not a measure of your milk supply! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeed-essentials.com/menstruation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeed-essentials.com/men...</a><br>  For some women, the drop in milk supply and nipple tenderness associated with menstruation becomes more of a challenge. An effective treatment for these symptoms associated with the return of periods is to add a calcium/magnesium supplement to the diet upon ovulation and continue it through the second or third day of a period. The supplement should be 1500 calcium/750 magnesium but can be as low as 500 calcium/250 magnesium (the higher the dosage the more effective and quicker the results). It should be a combination pill. This much calcium should never be taken alone. If your cycles are not regular and you do not know when you ovulate, you can take the supplement the entire month until you begin to see a pattern to your flow. This type of supplement seems to work as it prevents the drop in blood calcium levels which occurs mid-cycle and continues through the second to third day of a period. It is this drop which is associated with the nipple tenderness and drop in milk supply as well as the uterine cramping so often experienced with menstruation. You only need to take one pill a day.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org//NB/NBMarApr99p43.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org//NB/NBMarApr99p43.ht...</a><br>  I leave my babies infrequently, but when Walden was six months old, I needed to leave her for two hours with my husband. I left plenty of pumped milk and lots of instructions for Walter. Among his many options for feeding the baby, he chose to use the bottle. She took to it well and fell asleep in his arms. I nursed her immediately after I walked in the door and she latched on fine.<br>  <br>  The next day was a different story. She was fussy at the breast for most of the day and in the evening she bit me. The day after that was even worse. She bit me so hard that I yelled, and that triggered a six-hour nursing strike. I was scared to nurse her again for fear of being bitten, and she refused to latch on. Finally, she became sleepy and we nursed lying down in a dark room.<br>  <br>  At one point, while I was carrying her around in an attempt to calm her, we walked past the drying rack in the kitchen, and she reached out for the bottle! I felt awful! That was the clue that made my co-Leader suggest that the bottle triggered the nursing strike. I had thought she was too old to have trouble switching between bottle and breast, especially since she seemed to nurse well just after she had the bottle.<br>  <br>  Then I remembered that my older daughter also had problems with artificial nipples. When Meridian was 14 months old, I was providing childcare for other young children and they used bottles. One day, Meridian decided that she needed one, too. I gave her one filled with water. For the next week nursing was very uncomfortable for me, and she left teeth imprints on my breast, which she had never done before. Things did improve, and after that I avoided giving her bottles even to play with.<br>  <br>  We say babies have "nipple confusion" if they have difficulty breastfeeding after using artificial nipples, whether bottles or pacifiers/dummies. The term is usually associated with newborn babies, and some authorities disagree about how significant it is. Whatever the label, it makes sense that an older baby might struggle, too. He can bite on an artificial nipple (or on a cup with a spout) with no consequences. Sometimes, a mother may even be unaware that her baby is biting these inanimate objects. But she can't fail to notice when he does the same thing at the breast.<br>  <br>  Since having this experience, I've talked with other several other mothers who had similar problems with older babies. Some of them had made the connection between artificial nipples and biting for themselves, but others had not realized that this could be a problem for an older baby. Their sharing and support not only helped me to get my baby back to the breast, but made me wonder if nipple confusion persists beyond the early months. I hope that hearing my story will help another mother avoid a painful bite or work with her baby to stop his biting.
qYDcqa0Laa	UTI or Yeast Infection.|`|8a59fbf65c7bb6fdda8d57fc2fd614edaa	sounds like you have a UTI however with a yellow discharge you may want to get checked for the STD Trichomonis. does the discharge have a fishy stinky smell?

Also crawl with baby on the floor so he can watch you as well and move toys away from baby so he is forced to move.|`|KbIMB30baa	he started pushing up around 6 months and crawling around 8 months. all babies are different though, some take longer than others.|`|HmV3nuL4aa	My son started crawling around 8 months. It kind of just happened all at once! We'd put him on his hands and knees quite often, and from there he just took off!|`|OwLcbnTvaa	My son started crawling at about 7,8 months, he used to drag himself across the ground, nearly crawling.|`|DNygQdmVaa	He started the knee thing around 6 months, and crawled at 8 months.
hVVALFAPaa	Most cities have noise limitations, meaning loud parties, etc, are not allowed past a certain time. Our city is 10 on weekdays, 12 on weekends. <br>  <br>  Check with your city codes, then call the police if they go past the quiet time.|`|zATQaiwIaa	check in and see what you city noise limitations are - every city has them.  Then take your facts and go talk to your neighbors, tell them that you have a family and would really appreiciate if they could abide by the city noise code as you\husband have to work and your 3.5 year old daughter have to sleep!  its not unreasonable - if they dont like it just walk away and call the cops EVERY time they dont go by code.  if anything you will get rid of the pain in the A$$ neighbors!!!!<br>  <br>  And dont worry about being a B*&^$ - who cares, your family comes first|`|liLndjrNaa	Just go over and try to talk it out with them politely ask them if they could please keep the sound to a minimum.  Tell them you don't mind the parties it's just hard on your family because the noise is to loud.  And if they have a problem with it and act rude tell them you don't want to get the cops involved but you will if you have too.  I'm sure they will stop then.|`|txv7TIgiaa	just ask them nicely and if they don't listen call the landlord, or if you own continue calling the police i had the same problem but my daughter is 15 months...then all that partying led to a pregnancy lol and they are really quiet now...|`|tTh2Q7etaa	who cares what the neighbors think about you or anyone for that matter. you need to just call the cops, your neighbors probably only have a year lease anyway so you wont have to deal with them for long.|`|c9GDDlnCaa	i'd just start mowing your lawn at 6 in the morning. wake them up when they are hungover! that or just start having parties louder than there's|`|54048f431e23af198481432570ea86bcaa	Talk to them and see if they will be reasonable. If not, start calling the cops every time.|`|hh5E9n4Oaa	Well, most of the time police don't typically do anything about disturbing the peace, depends on your jurisdiction.  However, you can start by doing things with your daughters room.  For example, you have blinds and curtains you can draw up when it's night time that will help with some of the noise.  You can try a sound machine, those things are wonderful I have one that I got at radio shack and that thing is awesome. It has a train, ocean, brook, night (crickets) setting.  It is good at blocking the television out might help with the neighbors. Your neighbors sound like they are being completely rude, not you maybe you can just talk with them.|`|4gZYucHMaa	We have college kids beside us and we hear them all the time. When they first came, I let them know if I hear them it's fine, but if my kids get awaken then there will be helll to pay. I've broached these kids in that manner, bc hey I was young once, partyied but they have to be respectful of others.<br>  <br>  You won't come across as a b*tch if your tone is cool, just let them know in a very open manner ''hey, don't know if you know or not but you guys get really loud at times, I have a kid who wakes up''.<br>  <br>  Most people don't want to cause trouble, they'll be embarrased more than anything. Perhaps they don't know they're loud (it happens sometimes when you're drunk) so broach it, and if they continue to keep it up after that then don't worry about how you look to them and call the cops.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	If you have tried talking to them then you have to start calling the cops. It will only get worse if you do nothing.|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	Just say something to them, nicely. We live in a townhouse style apartment and our neighbors are obnoxious. I went over and "nicely" told them that they could be as loud as they like all day, but when 9' rolls around please turn down the radio. And it's worked so far. They've actually been much quieter all day as a result. They said they didn't realize we had a new born... lol<br>  <br>  If you rent I would suggest calling your landlord and letting them know. My landlord is always happy to hear about problems in the building.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Is my music too loud right now...oh i'm sorry! LOL, just messing.<br>  I'd be pretty mad, i'd knock on the door and ask em to keep it down once it started to get late and loud!|`|2nqmoerIaa	talk to him sleep is very important<br>  <br>  <br>  Dom K|`|kzyEuRroaa	Just calling the cops on them all the time may have negative effects.  If you have already tried to say hello and been met with rudeness, then sugarcoating or even being polite may not work.  I like the idea of mowing at 6 am- lol.  <br>  <br>  The best solution may be to just go speak to them and say, I know you enjoy having a good time, as we do too, but we have a daughter at home, and are hoping that if you can't respect us, at least respect the fact that she needs sleep.  Provide them with the info on the city sound ordinances, and let them know that on weekends you may be more flexible, but if it continues excessively you will contact the police, as a few times is understandible, but all the time is downright disrespectful.  Be reasonable, and you shouldn't seem like a *****, unless they are totally rude and inconsiderate. Good luck!!
5f75de4cef16ee724cdcb0a718bf76a3aa	The testes lie in the abdomen until the 24th week of gestation when they begin to descend into the scrotum. The process of descent may take several weeks. By 34 weeks (7.5 months) gestation, about 8 in ten male fetuses will have their testes descended into the scrotum. <br>  <br>  But most babies at 31 weeks do a lot better inside mama's belly, so despite your discomfort, don't wish for too early of an arrival.|`|QSodlfMraa	yeah i too read that it is from 28 weeks up.<br>  congrats honey :)|`|FhKfyxWlaa	You should not be hoping for a baby to come sooner than planned. Let him stay in his safe and comfortable home for the full 40 weeks. This way, his lungs will be fully formed and the will be a healthy birth weight.  I have no idea when a fetus's testis descend. I never asked that question while carrying my son.
mVD3TQkFaa	My bf's cousin who is 6 months old had this same thing the other day and she has a ear infection and is on meds for it right now. They said it was her body fighting and/or getting rid of the infection. I would call her ped and see what they think.|`|KbIMB30baa	green usually means some kind of infection, so I would take her to the dr. to get it checked out.|`|Wkf0YTKtaa	Sounds like an infection.  I would at least call the pediatrician, they may want to see her.|`|AA11981363	When they have green snot they have an infection and they need antibiotics. If the snot is clear or yellow no problem there. I will take your LO to her Pedi.|`|s4aX6bF6aa	green is a sign of infection...you need to call her pediatrician and get her checked out for sinus infection.
r7q8LW7Aaa	It's funny I was thinking about posting a similar question.<br>  I remember being so keen for my first to walk and talk and do everything else now she's a very independant 3 year old and every day there is something new - a new word or phrase or skill.<br>  But my youngest is almost 5 months and I swear I want her to stop! I don't care if it's selfish, I want her to stay my baby as I missed my eldest being a baby so much. I want to tell first time mothers not to rush their children to grow up because you'll miss it sooo much - the cuddles, the first laughs, the big smiles, it's all amazing!|`|heDtLdz5aa	i started noticing him learning and growing more when i would ask him to get his milk..binkie..while pointing at it and he would go get it..now all i have to ask without pointing or gestures and he goes and gets it...also when i ask him..do you want mommy to read you a book? he goes over and grabs his book...he is 16 months...|`|DNygQdmVaa	When my 14 month old started to tell  me no everythime I ask him something or offer him food I realized he was growing up too fast!<br>  <br>  And he just started to never ever want to be held.
fTLzKg5Eaa	The best way and I know as tried it myself Is to stay Relaxed and enjoy sex and be calm... wanting to get pregnant really fast can add some stress to you and stress is not really good... I got pregnant exactly in the month I stopped trying for the baby as I was tired of crying in the end of each month for a whole year...<br>  <br>  h also I after "baby mission" I did put my legs up and stayed like that for 15 mins... I dont know whether it worked exactly or just coincidence but I ve heard it was good so I did it LOL :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Get an ovulation kit in the pregnancy test section of the drug store.

And I also think it's ridiculous that you want to PLAN to deliver in a certain month... that's just crazy! <br>  Usually couples who want to get pregnant want it to happen as fast as possible but the reality is, most people don't get pregnant until they've been trying for 3 months & the average couple gets pregnant sometime within 6 months! <br>  <br>  The only way to get pregnant is to make sure you have sperm inside of you when you're ovulating & even if you have sex for 2 weeks straight in the middle of your ovulation time it doesn't mean you WILL get pregnant.|`|AA12397532	Ovalution ofcourse yes - But do you want it the conventional way or the modern way. If the conventional way - make sure you make passionate unabadoned love - let your muscles relax and free to receive the sperms.<br>  If the unconventional modern way, the doc will tell you when to come to the clinic and will artificially inseminate you<br>  Organic or inorganic - choice is yours!|`|wbnqzpoCaa	lot-es of sex. how else do you get preg.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	There is no way to get pregnant fast.

SLSX6QQsaa	18 is the legal age, in some states I know there are loopholes in the system and 17 can pass as an adult and not be forced to return home.  If the mother is not willing to take care of her son, you should first try to handle things out of court and see if she will give you a certain agreed upon amount to take over responsibility of his needs and care as well as agree upon him living with you.  If she doesn't agree with it, call child protective services on her and she will either be forced to be a better mother or they will put your cousin in the foster care system.  At this time, you would be a great candidate for a foster home and they would definitely give you a monetary allowance for doing so.  As far as your age, I think they would consider it given circumstances. They are more likely to place him with family than elsewhere so thats in your favor.  I think this is your best route.  But you really should talk to her first. She might be relieved to hand him over along with some money.  You never know.<br>  <br>  Add: When I was 15, my parents attempted to emancipate me.  However the child must also want to be independent, and there are requirements.  The child must be able to prove he can support himself financially and otherwise.  Your cousin cannot have a job until hes 15 anyways and even if he gets a job at 15, is he really going to be able to support himself?  Emancipation is not too likely to work out but it was an idea.|`|AA11849364	Unless he is emancipated, he is required to live with his parents or a legal guardian until he is 18. If you are concerned  with  his well being, you might try reporting what is going on to CPS.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	18|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	He can decide where to live when he is 18.  If the child is in trouble and mom is not providing for him, call CPS.|`|6SEQTZyDaa	He can file for emancipation when he is 16, but his mother will not be responsible for any support. I would call CPS and talk to a child advocate, maybe he would be able to receive some type of assistance.|`|D3fbdkYcaa	i think at 12 years old the child can decide on weather to live with its mum or dad and at 16 they are allowed to get theire own place have kids get married ect.<br>  thats in the uk though|`|hKJIDdVqaa	It depends in the states. A lot of states it is age 11, many more states it is age 15.  Call your local department of Social Services or Child Protection Services, or the police dept.  Often times, you can leave and the cops may not be able to make you go back home.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	At 12 they can decide if they want to live with the mom or dad, if they both are fit to raise the child. If they just want to move out and be on their own then it's 18. For your case it would probably have to be brought up to a court and if the mother agrees to it and you agree to the terms.
xZWP2mqjaa	It is a symptom. I've had it for as long as I can remember!<br>  I didn't have it with my first, but I've had a stuffy nose pretty much throughout this one. I'm 33 weeks now. I didn't have the sneezing though, not until I had a real cold. I just feel constantly congested.<br>  I think it has something to do with the increased blood flow, vessels getting bigger to cope with the extra blood flow and hormone levels increasing.<br>  I definitley think you've been successful this time! Good luck!|`|XVljoYZ5aa	I'm 12 weeks and I have a stuffy nose. It started at 11 weeks, but I attribute it to being springtime. Most likely you are suffering from allergies. It maybe wishful thinking mama, but it will happen eventually. Good luck!!|`|ncUhlwevaa	YES! I am 7 weeks pregnant now and have had a VERY runny nose. I googled it before i found out i was pregnant to see if it was a symptom of early pregnancy and sure enough it was.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I got a stuffy nose but it wasn't until further into my pregnancy. I was around like 25 weeks when that started. I don't know if it's an early symptom.|`|lI42kTXIaa	Before I knew for sure that I was pregnant, I had a runny nose for about a week with sneezing then it stopped then it started again for about another week. But I never felt like I was sick or that it was allergies. I started doing a bunch of research online about "first pregnancy symptoms" and believe it or not, a runny nose is one of them! I thought that was the weirdest thing!|`|nIE5Qtiqaa	Well, I'm not saying you are or you aren't. But I am 13 weeks pregnant and I have a very stuffy nose. Some blood in your congestion may also be a sign, because I have that to. I have had this for quite some weeks now. I didn't have any symptoms that gave way to the fact that I was pregnant. But, if you want a baby I hope you are! Good luck!!|`|fpyRo8Noaa	i also have a stuffy and runny nose a lot...so maybe it can be a symptom....|`|QMxEjCpiaa	I don't think it's one of the early signs of pregnancy, but it is a symptom. I've had a stuffy nose and sneezing for the past 2 weeks. I am typically not allergic to polin or anything season related. I've looked this up online and doctors do say that often pregnant women in their second trimester will suffer from a stuffy nose. I know it isn't a cold since I don't have any other symptoms.<br>  <br>  In the same article about "pregnancy nose" I read that it lasts until the baby is born. 5 more months of this will absolutly kill my patience. So when I go to the doctor on Friday, I'm going to ask about my stuffy nose.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	I don't think its a typical pregnancy symptom. It sounds like a cold.
ba2d2dc2174d27dfcb9251daddc000aeaa	hi i bought an angelsounds doppler from ebay for about ￡25 and found my babies heartbeat at about 12 weeks with it, because they are so cheap it makes more sense to buy one then rent one, and if you have more children you can use it then as well. I was a bit unsure of buying one at first because i thought for that money they won't be any good, but it's the best ￡25 i ever spent has it gave me lots of reasurance till i could feel baby move (and after two miscarriages i need it)<br>  xx<br>  36+4|`|sgMno1PRaa	<a href="http://www.hi-baby.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hi-baby.co.uk/</a><br>  <br>  Im using one of this site - its 14.95 for the first month - for postage aswel and then every month after that its 9.95 or something like that.

I just bought a Hi-Bebe brand one with LCD (to show heart rate per minute) from Mamma and Papa and it is really really good!  I can pick up my baby's heart beat right away when I put the probe on my tummy.  I am 19 weeks at the moment and got it at 18 weeks. I'd highly recommend it.  <br>  <br>  I ordered it brand new on ebay (￡81 exc. postage) and ordered it on wed afternoon before 3pm and it arrived Thursday lunch time.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|LL2dgYMUaa	there are some good ones on ebay as for not being able to pick it up until 24 weeks i am 11 weeks if my dates are right and heard my baby quite clearly on my doppler the last few days. you can tell the difference  as it is double the speed of your own heartbeat roughly. it does depend on the mothers size and it takes a lot longer to find it but it is possible|`|38902e2ce5f8ef4d27715901e6c92e15aa	I was told by my Dr. that it isn't a good idea to get these. I wanted a piece of mind too, hearing your baby is really reassuring, however, he said that the ones you buy at the stores aren't really good and most parents get even more worried when they can't find the heartbeat themselves.<br>  <br>  But if you still want one they sell them at Babies'r'us for like $25|`|CDHcrkAZaa	I used <a href="http://www.hi-baby.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hi-baby.co.uk/</a>  and rented a doppler for about 3 months very good equipment at a fair price. Highy recommended.
hJoB7VR1aa	I didn't get, for the same reasons you already stated. Also the chances of a false positive are so great and then you would have worried for no reason. Any major problems that can be fixed (heart, kidneys, feet, etc) your doc can see on the ultra sound.<br>  My cousins test came back that her lil girl had downs and the amino said the same, when she was born she was perfectly healthy. Today she is 6 yrs old and one of the smartest kids I know.|`|XVljoYZ5aa	I plan to do only medically neccesary tests because thats what my insurance will cover. I know they do a Down Syndrome test by measuring the back of Baby's neck, but other than that, no. If you can afford it, I'd get it just to be as prepared as possible. Keep in mind, my SIL was tested and told she would have a disabled child, and 5 months later she had a healthy baby. I'd get it if you are at risk, but I won't get an amniocentesis.|`|YuA7a08Maa	No, if you're referring to the AFP test, we chose not to get it.  Ultrasound will pick up a lot of the more serious abnormalities and the AFP test has a pretty high false positive rate.  We wouldn't have aborted our baby no matter what.  My doctor said that 60% of people who come through his office say no to the test.  It can just be so traumatic to people sometimes for no cause.  Some doctors just give the test to women without explaining what it is, so feel grateful that your doctor gives you the choice.  Good luck!|`|lfNlz1iEaa	are you talking about the AFP test?  I did with my first and was told he had some horrific disability.  I went through an amniocentesis.  I was upset for about 4 weeks until I got the results that it was normal.  I didnt have it with my 2nd or 3rd pregnancy because I figured the end result would be the same - I would not terminate a pregnancy regardless of the outcome so I chose not to do it.  You have to make that choice for yourself though.|`|TvBGK1QLaa	you should get it that way if their happens to be something wrong it be no surprise to the dr. once you deliver. Also that way they are prepared for whats to come. Also you as parents should be prepared in the event something was wrong. Thats just me though hopefully this helped! Good luck and congrats on your baby girl!|`|d3jtRA8caa	I suggest you do it, only because if it does that way you can prepare for it. Do research for it, instead of being totally surprised after the birth and not knowing what to do at all.

bXRuC1ASaa	We don't even use a real diaper bag. We use a sports bag/book bag type thing.  It has the one strap that goes on one shoulder and diagonally across your front.  Anyways, I have 3 boys and in it I always keep 5 diapers, a small pack of wipes, 1 change of clothes per child, and a sippy cup and bottle.  We leave toys in the car, and my things go in my purse.  I think the bag is really light for having 3 young ones, but then again it's just essentials.|`|5e8276e29e4038d2a3b299690bb756e5aa	I wonder the same thing!  I go through mine almost daily and rearrange things so the sipper closes, hehehe.  One of my biggest fears is not being prepared, seriously.  I also carry a big honkin' purse on top of the diaper bag.  My daughter is only 9 months old and my poor diaper bag already has two tear holes in it from stress on the seams, hehehe.  I have been debating buying a new one, but then again I am thinking of gettin a little backpack, my sis has three little ones and it works well for her.|`|KbIMB30baa	When they are newborns you want to take everything you can think of for just in case. After a couple of times out you know what you really need. Unless you are going on a long trip, you only need a couple of diapers, small pack of wipes, bottle & burp cloth. Also a backpack style bag is alot easier to carry.|`|Zof09ZWJaa	Try to carry your wipes in a small travel size case or a ziploc freezer bag. It saves space and weighs a lot less. Minimize the personal items you carry, only the bare essentials, instead of a board book, get small lightweight toys. In general, it's gonna be heavy anyway, but minimize what you can to make your load lighter. The older baby gets, the less you'll need to bring. Hang in there, it'll get better.|`|e0368de96ef1a40f9fea200af07dfd35aa	The bigger the bad the more items you will add to it. I finally took out the clothes and the extra diapers and left them in the car.  If u are shopping and are close to the car leave those items there.  So what if baby is wet for 10 mins or so. Baby will be fine. So far I havent even used the extra clothes, diapers or toys.  But its nice to know that they are close by in the car.|`|P7q9cNaiaa	Do you have a full size box of wipes or a smaller box? They have some that are thinner, I'm not sure how many are in there, but I'm sure it's plenty for just the diaper bag. I would maybe just use either the burp cloth or rec blanket instead of both. Maybe cut down on the diapers depending on how long you're going to be out. Not sure, I haven't reached that stage yet!!|`|dl5ZWzpGaa	i got a bag pack. LOL|`|jvFWNuiXaa	I have the same problem.

Toys were kept in the car except I mighthave thrown one in the car seat if they were still in a mobile car seat. <br>  <br>  Really only take what you need.

How much do you *really* need to for a trip to the store?<br>  <br>  I pack 2 diapers, a small pack of wipes, bottle, pacifier and maybe a small toy.

There is no way around it. =)<br>  <br>  <br>  **EDIT** Even Breast Feeding you can still pack a thin blanket in a small diaper bag if you need to feed.|`|01vMpHkWaa	mine is staring to get heavy too..and im still adding :/<br>  and i have a big diaper bag|`|nuBRcuwvaa	I had 2 different diaper bags packed at home... depending on the adventure I would take different bags.<br>  <br>  Overnight at Gramma's house = heavy bag with everything necessary even if the world ended.<br>  Out to the grocery store = smaller bag.  2 diapers, small flexible pack of wipes, 1 toy, and 1 burp cloth.  <br>  <br>  You don't need socks, blanket, hat, clothes, etc if you're just going on 1-2 errands.  As for my stuff - I only put my wallet in the bag... chap stick, tissues, phone all went in my coat/pants pockets.<br>  <br>  My son is 2 now and we got him a backpack... haha (my mom thinks I'm mean for making him carry it.)  If he wants to take his toys somewhere, he can carry his bag... if not - then we just have diapers/wipes/extra underwear and some snacks inside.  Then I'll carry it.  :)  He learned quickly to pick just one toy to bring.|`|b6NhNXWMaa	This was a huge problem for me, I have a bad back so carrying something on one shoulder was very hard for me to do, the weight of a purse is about it, but having the diaper bag and the baby was a little too much. This was solved when my sister got me a backpack diaper bag, I didn't even know they existed but she saw it and thought it was cool and got it for me.  I like it because I feel like I can fit a lot more, and I can just put it on my back and it wont fall off of my shoulder or anything, this also makes it feel like it weighs less because of the way the weight is distributed. I can also carry my purse with out a problem, but I usually just through my stuff in there cause it is one less thing to forget... =P<br>  <br>  This is the only picture I could find, like it. I know my sister didn't spend this much and mine seems a bit bigger.

OBU1eDUHaa	My babies had it from day one.  With my son, I didn't know.  I just thought I wasn't making enough milk, so I quit nursing him. It was about 6 months before they diagnosed him. With my daughter, the same thing.  I went to the MD who told me she had reflux when she was 2 weeks old. With my son, he spit up sooooo much and wanted to eat every hour, but pull away from the breast after about 5 minutes.  With my daughter, she would arch her back and scream.  She would pull away from the breast over and over, crying the whole time.  She would arch her back all through out the day and cry if she was laying flat. They did not do any clinical testing with either of my children, just listened to what I told them were their symptoms.  She is 4 months old now and I still BF her. They gave both my children a liquid reflux med called Zantac.  With my son he also got Prevacid (a pill).  I added a website that lists the symptoms of reflux.  If you think this is the case, call the MD and ask for an appointment or just leave a message w/ the nurse telling her about his symptoms.  They encourage me at every checkup to continue breastfeeding her b/c BM is still the easiest to digest.  However, there are a formulas, Enfamil AR and one by Similac that are rice-enriched to help with reflux.  Keep breastfeeding if you can.  Good luck!|`|xbvve9vZaa	It isn't hereditary and they can't really test for it.<br>  <br>  As long as your baby is getting enough food (having bowl movements and wet diapers) he/she should be okay. They put my baby on medicine (zantac) and then it was really bad so we went to a GI doc and found out he had a spastic pyloric valve and then they switched his medicine to prilosac but he is 6 months now and I rarely have to give him medicine because it doesn't seem to bother him as much.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	There really is no test for it. They just look for the symptoms such as crying during and after feedings and arching of the back. I think it might be hereditary my husband and FIL have it pretty bad. Chances are they will put your baby on medication. My son has it and has had it since he was a few weeks old. They put him on Zantac twice a day and Mylanta twice a day.<br>  <br>  ETA: If it is really bad they might send you to see a Gastro Specialist. Though my sons was never that bad that he had to see a specialist.|`|GNLYxY7kaa	Maybe you can mix rice starch in your milk. My son had reflux and due to my meds I couldnt breast feed, but I have him Sim Sen RS (rice starch). Its thicker for babies with reflux...so it stays in their tummy better. Just a suggestion. They tried putting him on Zantac twice a day but it was so bitter and he hated taking it...it also seemed to not work so we took him off it.|`|fsDof9pgaa	My baby had acid reflux since he was about 2 weeks old until a year.  He's 1.8 now and doing great.  They dignose sometimes with just the symptoms.  But sometimes they perform this test that they give them a bottle of Barium (a liquid) and take some type of x-rays while they do it.  Then they can see if when they eat the food is going down or keeps going up, and how mature their digestive tract is.  My husband has it pretty bad too, but our pediatrician says that with babies it is different, and mostly caused by immaturity of the digestive tract.  They will not make you supplement with formula if it is not a problem that the baby is lactose intolerant.  They gave my baby some drops that helped control the amount of juices his stomach produced, and that really helped.  Also, never lie him down horrizontaly, but in diagonal with his head higher than his waist.  There are some mattresses designed for this, or tilt his bed by placing a book under the legs of the crib.  Hope he gets better, and don't worry.. it's temporary.  Now my baby has a totally normal life.|`|11b68a801a54cbaaf5017e1cfa294d15aa	you might want to stick it out for a bit, my litle girl had terrible reflux for the first eight weeks but was still gaining weight so i didn't put her on the offered medication. it cleared up of it's own accord and it's only occaisional now at 15 weeks|`|tDb3osk7aa	well if its not too bad and ur baby is not loosing weight just not gaining as much as he should then they will prob. just put him on acid reflux med. or get u to try a diff. formula first there is one called lipil AR and its for babies with reflux my son had reflux but it was not too bad just was not gaining much so his doctor put him on the med. it was called AXID and it helped a great deal the spitting up almost completley stoped the funny thing was before the meds. he would always spit up on my dad when he came over to play with him and with the meds. he did not do that any more lol if ur breastfeeding i dont know what they will tell u to do about the formula my was formula fed they might just put him on the meds. ask for the AXID its expensive but it tastes good and they will take it with no problem like the zantac u will have to mix it with a drink or something like that at least that is what i was told by a friend whos daughter had reflux very badley and if u do bottle feed adding cereal also helps with the spitting up it thickens up the milk and helps them keep it down we did the meds. and the cereal  for a while until he was 9 months and we weaned him off of it and now he is good we still add the cereal to help keep him full and the milk thick he is now 11 months old and is in the 20- 25th percentile on his growth chart and thats great he has been steady and constantly growing bigger good luck and yeah it might be heraditary i have it bad too i keep rolaids or tums by the head board in the bedroom all the time lol and i had it very bad while i was preg. i took zantac like they were going out of style lol.i dont think there is a test for it they did not test my son.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	They do not test for it, it is based on symptoms and IMHO they diagnose way too many babies today with it that really just are fussy.<br>  <br>  If baby is gaining fine then they don't do anything for it unless it continues past 2/3 months then they might prescribe an antacid.  Many babies have reflux symptoms as newborns and most grow out of it without any interventions.  Elyse wheezed and spit up for many months and never needed a medication - she now has none of those symptoms at 11 months old.<br>  <br>  If they try to prescribe a formula get a second opinion - breast milk is much more calming on reflux than formula - mixing formula and breast milk will just make him spit up even more.

aaDQFkhKaa	First of all, I know parenting is the "oldest job in the world" but it is also the toughest job in the world. I really appreciate the parking spots for families of small children.  I have four kids and trying to safely get them across a busy parking lot carrying a baby and towing a 2yr old, while also carrying your purse and diaper bag is tough. I don't think it is a "perk". I feel that is the store's way of trying to make it safer for their "highest" paying customers.  And yes it pisses me off when someone parks there with no kids.  We want to get in and out of there just as fast as they do and it is harder for us with children.<br>  <br>  I really don't like people who think that since you are pushing a stroller that they can walk over your child.  I tried once to maneuver my stroller across the isle of the mall and no one would let me get by.  So here I am inching over trying not to run anyone over and a lady yells at ME for blocking the way!!!!!  <br>  <br>  I think we should ALL (kids or no kids) be more considerate towards people and SLOW DOWN!!!!!!|`|jLYTKr33aa	I don't think it's parents vs. non parents.  I have many friends who are not parents, and they aren't rude like the woman you described.  I think that woman is just a female dog, if you catch my drift.  If it were me, I would have been tempted to ram my cart as hard as possible into hers.  What a complete jerk.|`|OV0P8N7kaa	SOUND LIKE YOU RAN INTO A REAL NUT CASE !|`|PwHWJkcYaa	you  are one of the most considerate mothers I have heard of. SHe sounds EVIL. Although, I do have to admit, some mothers irritate me. For example, when I was out shopping today, a mother with a double buggy rammed it into my ankles. I wasn't in her way, in fact, I had moved out of her way and was just about to leave, when she came behind me and shover her buggy practically up my backside! Now that's inconsiderate. Sure, I'm only 19, but I never got in her way and she was stood near the doors chatting, when I walked out of the other door (double doors outside New Look) and she just shoved it at me. <br>  I think these women are well out of order and I always try to be polite and leave space for mothers. If they get in the way, I usually just lean over the pram, apologise for doing so, get whatever I want and leave. I am with you on this one, but please tell  mummies not to bang innocent people!!!<br>  You sound very kind to me and it's nice to hear of someone trying to have grace and etiquette in this world!|`|hSJnaysiaa	I was the one who answered the parking lot question with a different opinion from everyone else.<br>  <br>  I don't so much think its parents against non-parents its just that some parents really seem to think they are entitled to special treatment based on the fact that they have children. Which, annoys people without kids as well as some people who do have kids (like me). I don't think anyone is entitled to special treatment based on the fact that they have children, me included. I don't require special parking.<br>  <br>  However, in the case of the grocery store that you wrote about above, it sounds like she was just especially rude (and had time to waste) because if there was room for her to go around, she should have just don't that. Its annoying when people don't leave room though to go around. I do get annoyed when I go to the store for a quick trip and end up getting stuck in line behind someone buying everything in the store. I also get annoyed when people are out and about anywhere with their strollers and won't let anyone past them because they're taking up so much space and then go soooo slow. Some people have things to do and places to be and we don't want to be caught behind the family stopping every 5 seconds.<br>  <br>  Same goes for anyone driving too slow in the fast lane.<br>  <br>  Its not that I'm against parents, I am a parent, I'm against people wasting my time though and also expecting special treatment just because they are a parent. Parenting is the oldest job in the book, its not something to deserve "perks" for.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Gosh what a witch, I dont know sometimes I think people that arent parents just dont understand what its like. I personally dont feel like I'm better then someone that doesnt have kids, I just know that I know stuff that they dont about certain things. People now days are just really snotty no offense to anyone but they are, everyone nowdays dont smile never says hi everyone is rude. I dont know what is up with people, but its very annoying. I just know when I didnt have kids and I would see a child acting up in the store I thought to myself boy I wont ever let my kid act like that, haha I think it happens to all parents about once we have all been there when our kid was throwing a fit over a toy or candy. I just think people with kids just dont understand then when they do have them their views are different|`|yKS2UI87aa	Wow, that lady was totally rude and totally wrong. If you were on the right than she shouldn't have been upset. Sometimes just stopping so they can get by faster is a benefit to them. As far as the parking, I've never seen parking for families with small kids; only pregnant ladies parking. I think it's great I've only used it when I was farther along though. My co-worker (male) and I had to get some things and he's like your pregnant, park there. I'm like no way not big enough (I was only about 4 months) Have a great day and hopefully next time you'll get nice people when you're shopping.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Some people without children also feel that people with children are looking down on them.  <br>  <br>  And, it really has nothing to do with that.  It's just how confident each feels in their own life choices -and- what kind of personality each person has.  There are rude people with children.  There are rude people without children.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	I dont think its a parent versus non-parent issue.  And Ive been in a store before, dressed nicely, with people who are just kind of in the way, kids or not.  Its really not her fault, you had your hands full.   But she didnt need to add the extra comments.<br>  <br>  Now, as for parking, when Im with my kids, I always take the spot next to the cart corral.   It doesnt matter if its up close, but makes life easier.<br>  <br>  And at the store, Im far more annoyed by people who super slowly write checks, than anything else.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	Yes the parking space issue does piss me off and did long before I had a child. People who aren't handicapped shouldn't park in the handicapped spaces and people who aren't PG or don't have an infant, shouldn't park in mommy to be or with newborn spaces. Its just common courtesy. <br>  I don't think I'm deserving of special treatment, I just think its common courtesy to be aware and help out others, with kids or not. The world is full of rude people with or w/o children. Its unfortunate.<br>  In fact I never used the mommy to be spaces until late in my last tri-mester when I was just plum tuckered after working 9+ hours a day and needed to finish my shopping necessities for my "due any day" newborn. Often times people who park in these spaces or the fire lane, could use to park at the end of the parking lot. Its probably the only exercise their fat butts will get.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	yes you were and you did nothing wrong. It sounds to me like she is one of those people who are mad at the world and everything bad that happens in her life is someone else's fault not hers. lets hope she is not a day care  mom. I don't think people with children are looked down upon, at least in my view. where ever you go there is going to some some small kid who acts up at the store, or in a restaurant but that's just life. People  need to have some  patience with children and parents with small children.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	That's crazy. I've been there. If my daughter is going to the grocery store, my hubby comes too, just for that reason.<br>  <br>  I had a time when I was by myself and my daughter had a major explosion in her pants that got everywhere. I forgot to put extra clothes in her diaper bad, so I'm frantically holding her and trying to get to the baby section, holding her, and pushing a loaded cart. I grabbed the first outfit in her size and make my way back to the other side of the store to their cash register. There was a crowd of employees mulling around, a few of them giving me dirty looks because I'm so frantic. After I paid, a sweet older woman who worked there offered to push my cart to the restrooms for me so I could get her cleaned up. I was so grateful. I guess that some people just don't get it.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	i wouldnt call that parents vs non-parent, simply  parent vs bit*h....theres just no excuse for some people. i wouldnt have moved either had i been in your position. a little bit of me would have wanted to trip her snooty *** and watch it hit the floor on her way by though haha<br>  <br>  i live in the middle of nowhere, id never heard of family parking spots or spots for pregnant women, we have to fight for a parking spot with everyone else. but id rather park by the buggy corral anyhow. then again, i live in wv, one of the friendliest places there is,  something like what miss snoot face did is pretty much unheard of here.
miPubuDYaa	Yes, I do not think it's proper to name your second afrter her dead sister.. Use Tianah as a middle name to honor your dead daughter but do not give her the first name Tianah|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Even if your child is dead, she still your child<br>  One day you will tell your daughter about her big sister, it will be odd to have the same name<br>  You could use her name as the middle or give both children the same middle<br>  <br>  They need different first names, because you will always have your angel Tianah in you heart<br>  Your need little one, will always have a place in your heart, and needs her own name<br>  <br>  Losing a child is awful.  This child is your very own, and will not be you angel Tianah, you will have her in your heart for ever|`|CMuL7XpKaa	what about Tiara|`|F4knwfVsaa	It's not weird. It's sweet and sad at the same time. I am sorry for your loss. You really have to look at the long term effect it may have on your daughter. She may feel insignificant. I like the idea of it being her middle name that would leave a good impression as she gets older. Good luck and even if you choose to give her that name, everything will be fine.|`|wLLylvN2aa	I wouldn't do it, cause you don't want to make it seem like your replacing your deceased child with your new child. That baby lived for 7 months and is still your child, even though she is no longer here with you! <br>  <br>  suggestions:<br>  Talia- pronounced Ta-leah<br>  Tiana<br>  Tanisha<br>  Tierra|`|AA11603468	I don't think that's really proper. That name belongs to your sadly deceased child. The name is hers. Give your new child her own name.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Use it has a middle name.|`|AA12188347	First I am very sorry you lost your precious Tianah. <br>  <br>  <br>  I would use her name as a middle name....not as a first name cuz it might cause too much pain to yourself and others every time they hear her name.  I had my last child about  a year or so after my baby girl died at birth.  When I was pregnant with  my youngest I was hoping the baby would be a girl cuz I was either gonna use my deceased baby girls first name for a middle name or use it in the first name somehow.  (The baby that died was named Christa  and I was gonna use it as a middle name or I was thinking Christianne which is close with out being the same first name......)  <br>  <br>  Maybe just Tia....(my nniece'sname and its super cute) or  Teenah, <br>  Janessa (have a friend whos daughters name is that),  Halo, Harley, <br>  Marie-Christine (no middle name).................will think and see if I can come up with someothers.......|`|159b24ad2cea2ed0e8f59b46099c5829aa	Use Tianah As The Middle Name|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I would not give her the same name and I would not use it as a middle name either. Tianah was a part of your family, and you need there to be that remembrance. Pick a different name and let Tianah live on in your family. Be sure to tell you new baby girl about er and what kind of baby she was, its important for her to know as well, when the time is right of course. You wouldn't want her to feel like she didn't have her own identity so to speak. I am terribly sorry for your loss. Best of luck to you and your family.|`|24e08edff6a7f457ff2fc915564d7ef8aa	you could always use it as a middle name or maybe give the new baby the same initials if the father of this baby is the same as the child that passed away. my husbands cousin and his wife lost their son when she was 5 months pregnant and when she got pregnant with her second son she had his initials spell out the baby"s  name backwards. his initials are xam and the baby that died was named max.|`|qzVGaVWgaa	i think it is best to keep the two girls seperate and not have the same names.  giving the other child tianah's name is in a way replacing her memory with a new one.  it is best to keep both more individual whether or not her life was as long as anothers.  <br>  <br>  another good name could be Naila|`|eya1WDS4aa	I wouldnt name your second child after your first daughter that died unless it was the middle name. giving your new daughter your past daughters name is like trying to replace her, in some peoples eyes which is probably why they find it weird. im sorry for your loss.|`|gCBqdHf2aa	Just my opinion, I wouldn't you already have child named Tianah, whether alive or not.|`|o2H6DEHLaa	i can understand ,that some people may think is a replacement but it is your choice, maybe give it has a middle name .<br>  I like peyton or tammy|`|yNV2kRlbaa	Aww...that's sad. I'm really sorry.<br>  <br>  I think that as long as you think that she wouldn't be a constant reminder of your baby who died then there's no problem in naming her the same thing. <br>  <br>  It's a little bit strange that you wouldn't want to come up with a completely separate name for her..I mean I just had a goldfish die and I'm not going to name the new goldfish the same name...And we've had lots of the same types of dogs and always new names...<br>  <br>  I'd say probably use Tianah as the middle name, or change it some<br>  <br>  Tiana<br>  Tia<br>  Natalie Tianah is kind of nice<br>  Natalya Tiana<br>  <br>  I don't know, good luck..and again I'm sorry|`|KD8ZsKamaa	first of all i am sorry for the loss of your daughter, I can understand you wanting to use the name, but imagine being your daughter when she learns of her sister with the same name that died, especially when you relate to your second child it could be confusing for her. <br>     If i was you i think i would name her with the second name Tianah, this way she can be aware of her older sister sharing the name, without feeling replacement to her.<br>  <br>  good luck and let us know what you decide<br>  x x x x x|`|Rhr1umV1aa	Tianah is a very beautiful name. It is very common in parents to want to name their child after a deceased child. You could try something that sounds like Tianah like Tatiana. Or maybe Lianah. (like leanna) Or maybe Sienna. They are all very pretty names that are close to Tianah. I think that it might not be a good idea to name her after your deceased Tianah. It may make her feel less loved as she gets older realizing that she has the name of her deceased sibling. I don't know if you have ever read the book "My Sweet Audrina" by V.C. Andrews. It is a great book and the little girl in the book is named after her dead sister and she feels like she is #2 in everything. Then coming to realize that she was the first Audrina all along. Something happened to her when she was younger so they made it seem that she was the new Audrina. But in the book she refers to her "sister" as the "First and best Audrina". Try reading that book. It really is a good book.|`|d59940d88cb243925d59f301eb2f8710aa	is kind creepy!!|`|w5y4BTjkaa	I'm so sorry about your second daughter. No, it's not bad at all. I was named after my first sister that died. Actually, my parents just switched the first and middle. Her name was Sarah Tabitha and mine is Tabitha Sarah. You could do that.

If she finds out, she might not feel unique, like her own personal individual, and it might cause some depressing feelings when she's reminded of where her name came from (which could be any time someone says her name or when she tells others her name!)<br>  <br>  I personally like Ava. Not that many people have it, and it's pretty unique. Makennah is also pretty, but might not be that unique for you.|`|AA11615514	I think it is a little weird and possibly bad luck to name a child after a dead sibling. Using Tianah as a middle name could be a compromise.

You also could do something spelling Tianah backwards.|`|tQPvv0Glaa	I'm sorry that you lost a child, that must be a terrible thing to go through.

Since your first child was Tianah, why wouldn't you keep that name for your first child and choose a different name for your new baby girl.  Different children, different names, different identities....all that.<br>  <br>  But I know people have done it before.  My great-grandmother had a daughter named Sophia who died as an infant.  The next child was another girl and she named her Sophia too.  I think the only 'right' way to name your daughter is to do what feels right to you.  I could definitely see it as a way to remember/honor the memory of your baby girl.|`|658ce47ce0cc957cc16a6932ea236794aa	I am so sorry for your loss. My heart goes out to you.<br>  <br>  If Tianah were still alive, would you name your next child Tianah?<br>  I believe, in respect to your new baby, you should give her her own name. There is a risk of Tianah #2 feeling less worthy or resentful. She may eventually think "Mommy loved my sister more than me". If you want to honor Tianah #1, you could give her the same initials or perhaps the same middle name. I would not, however, call her Tianah.|`|Bu01WfOdaa	I think you are trying to replace the whole that was left when Tianah died, and this isn't a criticism but just bare in mind when your new baby grows up how she would feel being named after her dead sister - she would feel second best and maybe rejected.

qs9QHvy9aa	That's horrible.  You shouldn't even have a child.  To clarify, falling asleep isn't whats horrible, accidents happen.  But your total disregard for your baby afterwords, instead of taking the baby to the doc to make sure she is OK, your only worried about whether people will find out or not.  Accidents will happen, but your neglect after the fact, is child abuse.|`|4kX61Y97aa	go to the doctors and just be honest say your fell asleep while feeding her they wont judge you for it but its just to be safe even though she as no symptoms there may be inner injuries.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I suspect that this happens more frequently than people let on.  I had a friend (the dad) who fell asleep while feeding the newborn and she rolled off the chair.<br>  <br>  Don't beat yourself up.  You were exhausted.  You just fell asleep.  Take her in to the doctor and tell the truth.  It is completely understandable.|`|ZDMjuf4Taa	don't treat yourself so badly, these things happen, i remember falling asleep with by new baby in my bed and nearly squashing him, i felt so very guilty.  the important thing to do now is to speak to your health visitor, you will have to be honest and tell her the truth about what happened, she will check your daughter over, only then will you be able to relax and put it down to experience.|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	Well, I don't think that co sleeping is the best idea, but besides that, it could happen to anyone. You should have taken her to the doctors and not been ashamed. She is way too young to not have everything checked out.

Your guilt will eat away at you. See your G.P if not for the sake of your baby but for the sake of your sanity!! Your mum will know if your not telling the truth believe me. Be honest about this. There is no right way to bring up a child. You were tired and had just given birth. Your not the first mum to do this nor the last.|`|2dJIJr6uaa	this was an accident, you didn't mean for it to happen.

Besides her falling out of bed, you could roll over her and suffocate her.  Now that you've learned that lesson, it's time to move on.<br>  <br>  She still has a lump after 3 weeks?  Talk to the doctor about it.  Accident does not equal abuse.  If it's an accident, you take care of it, learn from it and move on.<br>  <br>  Since your partner isn't very helpful, ask your mom to look after the baby for a few hours while you catch up on your sleep.  It's ok to ask for help.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Did you call the doctor and let them know what happened?  She could have had a concussion or something like that.  That's quite a bit of 'trauma' for a baby that was less than 48 hours old.  Especially since, three weeks later, the lump is STILL there.  She could have a hematoma.  I would be more worried about getting her checked out to make sure that everything is okay rather than trying to hide it.  You made a mistake.  ALL mothers make mistakes. Accidents happen.   That's not what makes you a bad mother.  Lying to people about it and not getting her the care that she needs is what could potentially make you a bad mother.<br>  <br>  All three of my children have fallen and bumped their heads at one time or another (while they were very young).  A simple phone call to the pediatric office to let them know what happened always calmed my nerves.  Sure, I was mortified that the accident happened and was ashamed in myself for 'allowing' it to happen, but making sure they were okay was always the top priority.|`|dRCWdKBEaa	Well, it is sort of predictable that you would fall asleep after such a long time, as long as the baby is fine, then you have nothing to worry about. don't worry about it, if something starts to go wrong, go to your doctor, as for when the bump will go down, there is no fixed time for it to go down, it should clear up in a few days from now, if not, then go to your doctors, try putting the baby in a cot next to your bed, that way, you will know when she needs you, and that way, you don't run the risk of getting over tired and hurting her again, don't worry, she will be ok.|`|sFN3iL1yaa	Don't be too hard on yourself you were exhausted.  Just some advise for the future, when you have to step away from your baby and they are not in their crib.  Put them on the floor rather than leave them on the couch, they can't fall off the floor.  Most mothers I know, including myself have had a baby fall off a bed or couch and you feel absolutely horrible. Just learn from your mistakes, that's the best you can do.|`|kWWhFQdbaa	If it's your first, why did the hospital send you home....something not right here..... Surely your health visitor would notice the lump, or your follow up midwife.... <br>  How would you feel if your partner fell off your chest and he had a lump on his head for 3 weeks ( probably knock some sense into him)  <br>  As a single dad of 2 (last 10 years) I've had sleepless nights, feeding/teething/colds/illness, that's what happens when you become a parent... <br>  Get the head checked.... speak to someone.... You need help. <br>  <br>  By the way, lose the partner... <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|nZVTHKNwaa	If it were me, I would call the doctor just to explain what happened. Don't worry, you're not going to get in trouble or anything like that! :) Just be thankful that you heard your baby crying because that way you at least know she was okay. If you would have woke up to her lying on the floor silent, that would have been terrifying. I've heard of this happening before so don't feel like you are the only one out there. You are not a bad mother. I completely understand how exhausted you are due to lack of sleep. Next time, maybe put baby right next to you or in her crib so that you can avoid this in the future.|`|L0AZ6tHGaa	accidents happen. you hadn't really slept, so it's not much of a surprise you fell asleep. where was your partner? if they only went to smoke a cigarette, why didn't they come back and check in on you and the baby? i don't know about the injury, but i wouldn't worry too much about what you did. wasn't really totally your fault.|`|3dT7f39maa	Do not beat yourself up, you did an amazing thing by bring a life in to the world, so its natural to be shattered. Just take precautions petal, like if your gonna hold your baby, make sure your sat up, or sitting somewhere that if the baby does roll off, he won't hurt himself. <br>  <br>  Just relax and enjoy being  mother, not getting yourself in a state.|`|jAIL4PGkaa	bless ur heart, you are not a bad mother, when i had my first little boy i had to be woke by the midwife as he was screaming away and i never heard a thing, i felt like everyone in the word was watching! i would get it checked thow but be onest, my friend also done the same, your not the first and you wont be the last hunny. xx|`|6jQKAjRaaa	You are not a bad mommy.  Things happen everyday and I am sure you will never do that again.  Don't let it tear you apart...do the best you can and just be more cautious.|`|0ozx7T30aa	poor baby. don't worry about it. if you needed the sleep i can understand you going to sleep, it was the little buggers fault anyway. no but seriously, don't beat yourself up about it (or the baby)|`|jUneJXEIaa	This does not make you a bad mum at all.  But I would get your baby checked out by a doctor anyway just to reassure you.  I have heard so many stories about babies falling or rolling off the bed so you are not alone.|`|S5FubLOVaa	Dont worry. you spent 37 anda half hours trying to ge her into the world. you deserve a break. but be warned it may get worse but just take it slowly.|`|lD0VcAlpaa	you need to go to the dr. end of story.|`|Ah3kxDnGaa	You really shouldn't let this tear you apart. I'm a new mum myself so i understand the complete exhaustion you must be feeling! Have you told anybody about it? I'm sure if you spoke to your mum about it they too would be understanding and i'm sure it would make you feel a bit better about it?! It certainly doesn't make you a bad mother!!! My husband was dropped by his mum when he was a baby and believe it or not its something that they laugh about now! I know it probably seems that you'll never be able to do that at the moment but you really need to put it behind you. Unfortunately you can't start all over again but its early enough to start from now?!|`|AiJeS6I1aa	Accidents do happen.  It's too bad that it did, but you can't change it now.  You will just have to go on.  It sounds like she's fine.  Everybody has a scare story with their baby.  That's part of being a parent.  <br>  <br>  What I am worried about is the smoking... NOBODY should be smoking in the house!!!  This increases your babies risk of respiratory disease (asthma), and SIDS... I would be more worried about that.<br>  <br>  At bare minimum, the smoker needs to be going outside, and really they should be washing their face and hands, and changing their clothes after smoking because even smoke particles left over on clothes, skin, and hair poses a risk.  I realize that this sounds unreasonable, but it's true.  What better reason to quit smoking than the safety of your daughter?<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I hope it all turns out.|`|GbK3bldGaa	You had just gone through the hardest thing humans ever go through, <br>  You can't blame yourself for being exhausted.<br>  <br>  You're probably best to take her to see your doctor, Just to put your mind at rest. He wont think you're a bad mum because of it, Accidents happen all the time and you had just gone through the ordeal of giving birth. I know you will worry about it as that's your job now lol, Try not to though, Try and get some rest, You deserve it. <br>  <br>  Congratulations btw.|`|8tOYZql2aa	if you feel very guilty for what had happened, then you are not a bad mum.. just make sure it wont happen again. maybe try to lay in the middle of the bed, so that the baby or even you, wont roll over. <br>  i've been there before-being a new mom and it is hard. <br>  so try and get as much help you could from everyone else. it's important to get a lot of rest to recover and also to be able to enjoy your newborn.<br>  good luck new mommy!|`|AA11036706	Well, that was an unfortunate accident. It's something you will always, always remember. No sense trying to forget it. Just learn something from it and resolve to do better.<br>  <br>  First: Your partner should not have left you so soon to go have his cig. You'll need more help from him in the future and you should let him know this now.<br>  <br>  Second: You'll need to get along with less sleep for the next several years. Double and triple check EVERYTHING when you're with a baby, because lack of sleep can cause people to not get things right.<br>  <br>  Third: Don't sleep with your baby. There have been instances of mothers rolling over on the baby and killing it accidentally. Don't bring the baby into your bed again unless you're really, really wide awake.<br>  <br>  Fourth: Your baby will forgive you and you two will laugh about this one day. As she grows up and when she has her first baby, you just plan to be there to help her for a few days. <br>  <br>  The lump will eventually go away, probably within a week or so. Don't panic. Just --- don't let it happen again!
ofz43OY4aa	oh my god i am not alone :)<br>  <br>  my little girl started doing the same at about 4, i was quite impressed! and thought it was good for her independence but i now know the error of my ways!<br>  she goes in to cupboards and gets slices of bread, any sweet treats she can find, she is in the fridge non-stop getting yogurts drinks of milk, she'll even eat the butter!<br>  she's 6 now, and i've had enough, just bought fridge lock and cupboard lock's today! hopefully that will be an end to early morning snacking and mess making.<br>  i'm telling you this because it started off just like you have said, but the older they get the more they like to push the boundaries. if you don't want it to turn into a problem, i would try to stop it now, sounds harsh i know but trust me it's not worth the sweat blood and tears later! <br>  <br>  good luck with your little fridge raider, i still think it's really clever!|`|hh5E9n4Oaa	My child is almost three and he eats when I feed him.  If your child constantly eats then it's possible your child could become obese.  I want to know what my son is eating, and how much he is consuming until he is old enough to know the risks and benefits of what he consumes. My son gets three meals a day, and two snacks (one healthy, one junk). I taught him a long time ago that counters, pantries, and cupboards are off limits.|`|fsHgUrcAaa	LOL I would be so proud...I'd even be proud of the milky ways (but I'm partial to chocolate:)|`|Nhje1U06aa	My daughter did  the same thing at that age . She  would get her water bottles . tried to pack her lunch for school. she would even make popcorn in the microwave when I was upstairs and then yell mom its hot come and get it out for me!  <br>  what I did was rearrange my drawers - I took anything like milky ways ,oreos an put them on top of the fridge <br>  She also started getting her stool to get ice cream and Popsicles from the freezer. i just put them in the back with peas in front so she couldn't see them.<br>  <br>  I also explained what healthy treats are . If we eat to many wrong things we can get sick, and that muscles wouldn't grow ETC. I also told her that she had to keep growing to get on the water slides at sesame place<br>  <br>  It's amazing how quickly they become independent.|`|3F8f1SoQaa	totally normal at my house... At 2 years old my youngest pulled  a chair up to the fridge so he could get a yogurt off a high shelf after I told him he could not have a second one! He used to bring me the bread at 2 years old too ( so I could make him a PBandJ). <br>  <br>  I just started putting things that I did not want them to have in a place that was hard to reach ( on top of the fridge, etc) and put the things I did want them to have where they could reach them.<br>  <br>  To encourage her to help herself you could put a small container in the fridge with things that ARE acceptable to snack on ( preportioned fruit, cheese, veggies, etc). Or a particular container down low with non-perishables that she is allowed to have a certain amount ( 2-3) of a day.|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	As long as she is only taking healthy food, why limit her ability to feed herself when she is hungry?  Just make sure that the food you don't want her to eat is up too high for her to reach from the highest point that she can stand on.<br>  <br>  My 3 year old nephew would do the same thing if only he could open the containers.
XD42367paa	You're right in feeling the way you do. <br>  <br>  The baby is part of a package that includes your son and you. If FIL can't deal with that, then that's his issue and not yours. While I do believe that grandparents are essential to a good extended family relationship with children, it is not exclusive like parenthood is. <br>  <br>  It is not practical for your child's father to expect you to allow him to take your son for a whole day to see a man who does not like you when you are breastfeeding exclusively. When the baby is older and you are no longer breastfeeding, then it would work, but not now. <br>  <br>  I would stand my ground. You have told him how you feel and personally, I wouldn't bother again. There is no way I would turn over my two month old son to his father for the grandfather's pleasure under these circumstances.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	you are the mother... you have every right to be there with your child.. Your bf needs to tell her that if she want to see grandchildren.. then she needs to deal with you. She can choose what is important. Your man is being a total WIMP if he goes!|`|61uwsGVuaa	i totally understand where ur coming from i have 3 kids 2 are from a previous boyfriend and he only wanted to see his 2 kids if i came not if my other daughter and my husband came so i told him it was a family thing and his 2 kids are my kids too and they have a lil sister and i wast going to let him see them untill he grew up and got over and my kids are 4 and 3 now and he is just now seein them for the first time since we broke up and guess what my husband and my 2yr old daughter is welcome too so i think its bs that his father is being like that hes just trying to keep controlling his son and thats not right but there is nothing u can do about it untill u "put your foot down" i hope that helps|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	Long story - short answer. You are not wrong for feeling this way.  Your boyfriend needs to tell his father that you come as a package deal.  You need to sit your boyfriend down and tell him that you had thought you expressed your feelings on the subject, but since he did it again, there obviously has been some misunderstanding...then say it all again.|`|jvFWNuiXaa	I am with u on this one. I think the baby should not go if u r not going.<br>  U seem really calm and collected. I would have a big fight with my hubby everyday if  that had happened to me.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Your boyfriend should tell his dad "Either all of us are welcome or we don't come"  His father can't have it both ways so to speak. Has the Grandkid but refuses to acknowledge you. If you weren't in the picture the baby wouldn't be either. It's that simple. Tell him to step up and support you b/c it's his dad that should feel like a cad not you.|`|XfIrOjkBaa	If it was me, i would probably take my baby once in a while, but not too often............|`|7hTFflJ3aa	I was in a similar situation.. my husbands family banned me and my daughter from their family gatherings but my husband was welcome. (it was before we had our son together). My husband basically told them to take a flying leap. His family always comes first and when he got married, his wife became his family. He told his brother that we (me and him and dd) are a package deal. We haven't spoken to them in 4 years. My dh still stands by his decision that his wife and kids come first over his parents. I think by presenting it to your BF that his son is now his family and first priority over his father, he may see it differently. <br>  You are right to stand your ground. You and your children are a package deal.. if they can't accept you with your son, they can not accept you. Besides, if you keep this up what happens when your son is older and they are bad mouthing you behind your back??? Think about the long term. <br>  Your son needs a loving and nurturing environment and you and you BF can give that without grandparents being involved.
eya1WDS4aa	Idk i guess it just depends. In real life there are boys who are not the father that stick around. it all just depends on the guy and the way he was raised. Most boys now a days wouldn't do it so i think in that event it is showing a false side. Most boys if they see a young girl pregnant they run the other way. I guess it all depends on the way you look at it. I personally think the show was supposed to help prevent teen pregnancy but i think its making it look to easy on how its gonna be with the baby. the should have taken a different approach and made it to where when her boyfriend found out she was prego that he would leave her, and stuff like that, i think it should show the reality of it rather then the false parts like how easy it is.|`|qieTdigdaa	I agree with the poster above that I think they do certain things to bring awareness to the issue.  I seems like a lot, but then again, I guess if I wrote down all the stuff going on with my daughters friends, it would run pretty much like the show.|`|SNVauR3laa	My daughter really likes it, and I watch, because I like to see what she is seeing. I had her when I was 15, so it is interesting to watch. I think the most unbelievable thing is the support that Ben's father has given them. When I got pregnant, most kids weren't allowed to be my friends. Also, most talked about me in the hall in whispers. That was 13 years ago, so maybe it is more common now, and people don't freak out as much. <br>  I think that they have the opportunity to make kids think twice, and they are not really doing all they can with that opportunity. I haven't really seen any consequences for Adrian's behavior yet.

Until you are 18 you are a minor and anyone assisting you in crossing a state line without parental consent might be guilty of a felony. The consequences to *you* are minimal. The consequences to others could be severe.|`|GKjvY2PNaa	If you are only 17, then you are bound by whatever laws apply where you live to 17 year olds.  If by leaving home without your parents' approval you are deemed a 'run away' then that's what the police who come looking for you will care about.<br>  <br>  On the other side, once you are found, go to court, etc., you will definitely be 18 so it would be a waste of time for anyone to make a formal complaint to the authorities, is my thinking.<br>  <br>  If both of your parents agree on this one, perhaps you should re-think your plan.  They must be saying no out of love for you and that you don't know what you could be getting into traveling so much on your own at your age.  Given the information you've provided, you should maybe wait a year until the following summer for this pilgrimage.
SEzIkGNiaa	5 dollars per hour is what I charge for 2 kids.  I would charge 7 dollars per hour.<br>  <br>  As for the 8 hour a day job, I charge 50 dollars.

Although it is a valuable job and worth the money...people do not have that kind of money to spend on babysitting.  If you are an adult babysitting in your home then you can charge a bit to cover the food you feed them or expect the parents to bring food for their kids...if it is in their home then they will definately supply the food.  Even $75 for a day is high....you should charge either $5 to $8 per hour total of all three kids or a max of $50 for the day.|`|Nhje1U06aa	I would charge $12 an hr for all three or $90 a day <br>  for my daughter I paid 165 a week for a 10 hr day  which is $33 a day<br>  Good luck!|`|ygxM1Zkaaa	that is way too expensive! that's 15.00 per hour! she will probably laugh at you.|`|PwHWJkcYaa	I am a very well-respected babysitter and  I charge different according to age:<br>  1-4 ￡3 an hour<br>  4-7- ￡3.50 and hour<br>  7-10- ￡4 an hour<br>  If I am babysitting two kids I do a 'discounted price' for brothers and sisters or sleepovers:<br>  for example:<br>  a sleepover of 8-10 girls aged 9: ￡5 an hour<br>  a brother and sister (say aged 4 and 8): ￡6 an hour<br>  a brother and sister (both young) ￡3 for both an hour<br>  brother and sister (both older) ￡5  an hour for both. <br>  I just work out how many activities the kids will need (older ones need more, younger babies, less) and how many of them there are. <br>  In your case I would charge ￡5 and hour. These are babies and wont need much looking after, it's more 'put a film on in the background, get out the colouring books and barbies and play until they fall asleep or otherwise' job. No hair braiding or anything nice and easy.<br>  she would HAVE to supply the food. Surely you are going to her house, right?|`|XD42367paa	I own and operate a home daycare and families who come to me with three children I try to give a break. My going rate per child is $18 per day, however, if there are three in a family, I charge $18 for the first, $15 for the second, and $12 for the third and any subsequent children after that, making it $45 per day for three kids. <br>  <br>  If I have a waiting list, and I have a number of people who want care for their one child, I will take them before I take a family of three. Fact is that three kids from seperate families makes me more money, and I am in it to make a living, not to give cheap care. I also have a preschool, am licensed and take part in a USDA food program, plus, I run a family home daycare and am not a daycare center. While I might not have as many resources and staff as a daycare center, I do have a limit on the number of kids I can take, I prepare home cooked meals, I can give individual care and no kid is goign to get 'lost' in the crowd. <br>  <br>  That's all worth something. <br>  <br>  Don't go by what I charge though. I live in a rural area in Montana and the median income here is one of the lowest in the nation. Day care in other places and in cities should reflect the market and median income in your area. If you live somewhere, where the median income is over six figures, charge accordingly, but be prepared for a lot of competition and to work you hiney off to give good quality care.|`|8Bl8XQh8aa	Don't charge per hour per kid. I'm an experienced babysitter, and I charge $5 for two children. I would say $6 an hour for 3 children. $75 is absolutely too much... make sure that she is providing the food, and $6 and hour is good!

It was hard to get it off Im still fighting it off.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Many women do gain weight while taking the shot but it's not directly due to the shot. It's due to overeating. The shot can make the "full" alarm in your brain not go off as much as it used to which can lead to eating more. This is what my doctor explained. I was on the shot for 6 months and didn't gain an ounce cause I made sure to watch my caloric intake.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	I was on it when I was 15 for about a year and did not gain any weight.<br>  I know other girls who have gained a ton of weight, like 80 pounds, I thought i remembered the drs telling me that it increases your appetite, and it's on you t what you eat and how much.<br>  <br>  But with that being saidm, after I had Brody I got ont he depo and started gaining weight, so I took myself off of it, and I now have the Mirena.|`|AA12145826	I did gain some weight while on the depo shot that I am having trouble loosing, however, it was like 30 lbs over 3 years.<br>  <br>  My biggest problem was my terrible mood swings (and being that I already have clinical depression....that's not something I really needed to add on top of it). There are so many options now for birth control that its not just the pill anymore. You can try the patch, an IUD, or implant. For long term birth control, I have several friends on the IUD Merina and they just love it. One insertion and voila, no more worries for 5 or so years.|`|532XA7lkaa	I was on the shot for about a year before I decided against it.  I gained about 10 pounds in a year....which I attribute mostly to the shot.  Also, my sex drive was completely gone.

I told my doctor I wanted birth control, that I am horrible with pills, and I tried the nuvaring... i didnt like it. so he suggested mirena. he went into a discussion with me for 30 minutes, showed me the diagram and the actual contraption and the next month he told me to give him a call when I am menstruating which I did, went in, they inserted it and 4 months later. My periods went from seriously heave (before the mirena) to light, to non existent now. It last 5 years but if I ever wanted to have a child before the 5 years all i would need to do is go in and have them take it out and my body will return back to as if it was never on the iuc again.<br>  <br>  2 of my girlfriends are on this as well and they love it. highly recommended.|`|bOoa2PTmaa	I am one of those people that have gotten pregnant on the pill 3 times now. Due to a nerve disease that I have I cannot get my tubes tied so they suggested Mirena. Awesome. It only took a few minutes to put in and I very very light bleeding every month. Not even enough to call  period. I have had no discomfort at all. I have had it for over a year now. Very highly reccommend.|`|Sgm0RrMQaa	well i got it when i was seventeen and iv'e never had a child (you're supposed to have given birth before getting it) so it a was a painful experience. i had cramps like never before, and a horrilbe pian. but i think it was all do to my being so young so ithink i'm going to get it again after having a child.|`|61uwsGVuaa	i have had a iud mirena before but it didnt stay in i had it for 4 months and i was pregnant for 2 of those months but i have heard most the time they work really|`|UGE9jtnSaa	i have had it since August of last year, it is great so far...
nIE5Qtiqaa	That depends. For a home pregnancy test to give you a positive result, your body has to be making a detectable level of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). But not all pregnancy tests can detect the same amount of hCG; a sensitive test is one that turns positive even if a low amount of the hormone is present. The more sensitive a pregnancy test is, the earlier it will show a positive result.<br>  <br>  <br>  If the test you're using is only faintly positive, it may not be very sensitive. If you still have the box, it should say somewhere what the test's sensitivity is — the lower the number, the better the test. For example, a test with a sensitivity of 20 IU/L (milliInternational Units per Liter) will tell if you're pregnant sooner than a test with a sensitivity of 50 IU/L. A good rule of thumb is that the more expensive a pregnancy test is, the more sensitive it's likely to be. But you should still read the side of the box to see what the kit says.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Well its not supposed to matter if its faint or not...if its there you're pregnant.  You can always retest or bypass all of that and get a blood test done to be 100% sure.|`|vcxdTXbraa	a faint line is a line....you are prego... if you post the picture that would help too|`|2uZivThaaa	Your prego but just to make sure:<br>  a. Splurge and get a test that says "pregnant" or "not pregnant" <br>  b. Visit your doctor so you can be absolutely positive!<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|4V4m2uZ5aa	Your pregnant!  Just because one line is light it doesn't matter. My test was so light you could barely see it. I'm 5 wks pregnant. <br>  <br>  Congratulations!|`|giRRCXU4aa	No matter how faint the second line, you're pregnant. Congratulations.|`|ncUhlwevaa	it means you are pregnant but very early on in the pregnancy. Congrats!|`|rDPADat1aa	As everyone else said, it means that you're pregnant.  It doesn't matter how faint the line is, as long as you read it within the ten minute time frame. <br>  <br>  When I took my test, the test line showed up before the control line by several seconds.  I was afraid the test was invalid because my control line wasn't coming up.  Thankfully it did eventually!  29 weeks with my fourth now!<br>  <br>  Congratulations and good luck!|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	YOUR PREGNANT =D<br>  <br>  which line was darker, the pregnancy line or the control line because on my test the pregnancy line was SUPER dark and the control line was light. it was like it took all the ink from the control line lol. I thought the faint line was the pregnancy line at first until i realized it was actually the control line.|`|YuA7a08Maa	A faint line is still a positive, so congratulations!  They're always faint at the beginning because the placenta does not produce a lot of hcg right away.  The levels double every two days, so if you're worried, the line should definitely be darker in two days.  I had a fun time watching the line get darker as the days went on.  Good luck!|`|LL2dgYMUaa	it means your pregnant as long as this line appeared straight away within the time frame stated on the instructions. if it has appeared much later then it could be an evaporation line. re test tomorrow with your first mornings urine as hormone levels are higher then or see your doctor|`|hAXJ47iAaa	Your pregnant. No matter how faint the second line! If its there...your pregnant! <br>  Congratulations!|`|pYccUmXBaa	Was it one line or two line test?|`|fpyRo8Noaa	pregnant...mine did the exact same thing :)|`|gs2aPltGaa	your pregnant.<br>  <br>  it doesnt matter how faint the line is, if there is a line whether strong or faint it means the test detected levels of the pregnancy hormone.<br>  <br>  if you are not pregnant the line would not appear at all.|`|NCcpjBL5aa	yey, someone else with a bfp... it's a great feeling!<br>  good luck with your pregnancy huni xx|`|kgcTdberaa	pregnant!! take another one is a few days the line will get darker. congrats.|`|AA11112387	it means you may be a mommy!!!!!<br>  <br>  take another test with your morning pee it will be more accurate|`|lDBMjC1Yaa	your ego is prego
QMxEjCpiaa	I am just over 4 months as well, and have pondered when to register for baby items. At this time last year, my husband and I were registering for wedding gifts so we learned a few tricks. If you register too early, some of the stuff you pick will go on sale/clearance and no longer available. So I would register as soon as you set a date for your baby shower. Also register for both expensive things and not so expensive. I was shocked to find several of my aunts/uncles bought the really expensive gifts. So when we register to the baby stuff, we're going to do the same ... register for expensive items and not-so-expensive.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	You don't have to wait until you know the baby's sex. Plus, its just too much fun to go look at all the cute baby stuff to wait! <br>  <br>  Go ahead and put all the expensive stuff on there because your friends and family can split the cost of some of the bigger items. You will be surprised by how much people will spend on babies :) <br>  <br>  A couple hints:<br>  1) you can do without the infant seat, just look at all your options and ask lots of questions. this will save you several hundred dollars and the baby will probably out grow an infant seat in just 3-4 months anyway.<br>  <br>  skip the wipe warmer<br>  <br>  don't register for a breast pump... rent it from the hospital. <br>  <br>  hope this helped.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	The only thing I didn't put on the registry was the crib, changing table and dresser set I wanted. I thought that was asking for too much. I did put the expensive things on the register like the stroller and carrier etc. just in case a few people wanted to go in together on something and because if you register at Babies R Us and it's not purchased then before the due date they send you a coupon for 10% off any item left on the registry so I did it for the discount too! Registering for us took many trips to the store because there are so many things to get and so many choices to be made. I you start now, it will get you a good head start and you can just skip the things you want in pink or blue for now, but get the other things that are not gender specific. Have fun!|`|32a259f59d3088d2227a70c4bed9c8e6aa	I don't think it matters when you register...but it might be easier to register after you know the sex so if you see a bedding set or some clothes or something you like you can put those on there also. You should totally put the expensive things on your registry.  You never know when someone might buy you those things...sometimes people might go in together to get a big gift or something! Good luck and have fun!|`|Ds4xCthSaa	Wait until you find out the sex of the baby just in case, although it is good to get alot of things that can be neutral. For instance a baby carrier. Get one that you can use in case you have a boy someday. You also should do it sometime in your second trimester. That is when you find out, plus you tend to fell the best during that time. Once your third trimester comes you won't want to be walking on your feet for long periods of time. So do it soon after you find out about the boy or girl thing. :) <br>  <br>  When you register, register everything even the big things. Some people might go in together to purchase a big ticket item, or you might get a big ticket item and be able to return it for store credit which is also very good. I looked for alot of big things on Craigslist. You can maybe find something that is used and in good condition for a lot cheaper, then take some things back and have store credit. I bought my cradle and travel system and shelves off of craigslist for really good deals.|`|bcbcea9ab317286d8276722245169e01aa	I would wait until I knew the babies gender, that way you can choose something that you will feel more comfortable with once the baby comes along.  Also you might end up buying yourself some of these cute things that you come across an not want to wait for your shower, I know I bought alot for myself.  And register for it all if no one buys the expensive things you might be able to  use it as a reminder and compare what is out there by the time you actually go to buy it for yourself. Good Luck with it all and have fun!!|`|EcQeNu3raa	I didn't register until I was 6 months along. I do think it is better to wait until you know the sex. As for the expensive things, I left those off my registry. But you can still add them to the registry.<br>  I only added clothes, bibs, onsies, etc. But I also added a crib mobile, and a bouncer. Things like the crib, stroller, and swing I left off. Good luck and congrats!|`|ptwnCWloaa	You can do your registry whenever you want!  I think I did mine towards the end of the 6 month to give myself time to add or remove things as I wanted.  And I would definitely put everything on there that you plan on getting.  If no one buys them for you, no big deal!  And I know if you register through Babies R Us they will send you a 10% off coupon for any items still left on your registry.  They apply that discount to each individual item rather than your total at check out which is nice.  Plus, keep an eye out for BRU coupons.  They will send you tons and you can use more than one!  For example, I bought a travel system stroller that was originally $180 and after my 10% off registry coupon and 15% off coupon for the stroller, I was able to get it for $130!  Add whatever you can to it because you never know who might team up to pitch in for a big gift!  Good luck!|`|1oEhpwGvaa	put whatever you need on the registry.. if someone buys an expensive thing, cool.. if not, then you can go out and get it yourself. it wont hurt either way. Register when you know the sex of the baby, and before you send out shower invitations..|`|iW9GBrg6aa	when i signed up for baby registry is when i had a baby shower for my baby. I don't thihnk it really matters when you put it on. At least you will be prepared ahead of time. I think i registered when i was about 6-7 months pregnant.|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	You can start now, put the big items on because some people (like family or co-workers) often will go in on a big gift for you instead of a lot of small gifts!|`|fpyRo8Noaa	i'd say around 6 or 7 months.......|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I started registering around 24 weeks. I have things on mine that are over$100 and some things that are less than $5. I would have put a stroller one mine but my grandma in law has already purchased one for us.|`|rHufcHwHaa	I waited til I knew what I was having.  I actually registered about 2 weeks ago, so at 27 weeks. That way, I could register for cute girl things, and your options open up when you get to pick from more than just yellow and green.  <br>  <br>   I put big things on my registry because my family lives out of town, and my grandparents/aunts and uncles wanted to get me something more than a couple of packs of diapers.  I'd say if you need it, add it.  You never know what someone will want to get you.  I wouldn't worry about it being tacky or anything.  Obviously just make sure you put things at any price range so nobody feels uncomfortable.
VCCKfT3taa	Irupathi Ettu Kettu/Aranjanam Kettal/Palu Kodukkal:<br>  <br>  This ceremony is performed on the 28thth day after birth of the child, as this is the first time the nakshatram (star) of the child repeats according to the Malayalam calendar. During the ceremony, charadu (thread), one in black cotton and the other a chain in gold are interwined and tied around the waist of the child. This thread is called 'Aranjanam'. The child's eyes are lined with mayye or kanmashi (Kohl). A black spot is placed on one cheek or asymmetrically on the forehead, to ward off the evil eyes.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	its during the naming ceremony. IF they already named it and did the prayers you could tie it now. Or give her the mark between the eyes. I am American and my husband is Indian. We live in America and none of his family was here for my daughters birth so we were unable to hold the ceremony. Though I did the mark for a week in honor and took some pics for her grandparents.<br>  <br>  hey posters if you are not Hindu then dont bother posting stupid or ignorant posts. What does a CROSS have to do with anything if your Christian.|`|geuF7GsHaa	how does black thread keep off evil spirits???????
yCwPxulYaa	It is funny that you posted this, because I am going through this with my daughter.  She HATES fruit.  She will gag and puke if I give her fruit.  But, she will eat veggies like crazy.  Last night, she ate green beans over pears!<br>  <br>  I guess it is good they like veggies, but I really hope she comes to like fruit eventually.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	My son will eat anything you generally put in front of him. Ive tried finger and some table foods. He refuses to eat it. Even if its his fav veggie or fruit. It has to be smoothed like baby food. Otherwise he's like a vacuum =)|`|lGcpXteaaa	When she was younger she had a preference over fruit. Now she doesnt really seem to have one she likes more....maybe fruit just a little bit more...<br>  <br>  At least you wont have a problem with getting her to eat her greens later on!|`|prqrQcd1aa	My kids all prefer fruit over veggies as well!|`|4t5eGShiaa	My little guys likes both. He gives me a face like "What the heck are you feeding me" for the first bite.. then after that.. he's good to go! <br>  <br>  Even if your baby girl doesn't like her fruits you should still continue to offer it to her.<br>  <br>  The other week we finally tried Stage 2 "Chicken & Veggies" (he had only had fruits and veggies prior) That was no fun! LOL. He didn't like it.. but we will be bringing it back again this week to try again.|`|gs2aPltGaa	my little one loves sweets. lol<br>  <br>  in the morning its fruits with rice, <br>  <br>  afternoon/dinner time its a variation of sweet peas/sweet corn or sweet potatoes with rice.<br>  <br>  you have a daughter that loves veggies!! whats ur secret please, cause I need to know. lol|`|TqOdbhNAaa	I have the same problem with my baby.  She'll gobble up squash, green beans, sweet potatoes or carrots but won't touch applesauce and bananas!  I keep trying though so she has a variety in her diet!|`|nYioXmnGaa	My first and second like fruit . They love apples the most .|`|2zuiR2Byaa	I don't feed it.|`|u37jksU0aa	mine was the opposite..  fruit, but no veggies...|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	my son will eat anything he NEVER say no to anything|`|AA12122999	fruit|`|723QHuicaa	Fruit for sure! her fave's are grapes, melon, pineapple and banana.<br>  <br>  She will eat any fruit aside from oranges (allergy), but those are her favourites. <br>  <br>  She will eat veg too - without a fight. But the fruit is gone in seconds.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Dane is what we affectionately call a "garbage disposal" He will eat any and anything you give him. =)
17026d156e3d8ccd0b91156df378dbcfaa	I took zofran for the morning sickness, my baby is 3mnths now and he's fine, if your worried about taking drugs while pregnant.  I have a 4 yr old and I think that helped b/c he's old enough to entertain himself...I also went and stayed with my mom while I was really sick until the zofran kicked in.  Both pregnancies my morning sickness was very bad, for me that's the worst thing about being pregnant b/c it really does keep you from being active so if you decide to have another baby sooner rather than later ask for zofran and rely on friends and family if you can.|`|txv7TIgiaa	i only have one baby but a good friend of mine is 7 months pregnant and has a 3 year old, and i she is a single mom, she works full time and somehow she is pulling it off, but some days she just looks so worn out it is hard but millions of women do it...good luck...|`|AA12243380	I took zofran to cope with the vomiting.<br>  <br>  I have 21 month old twins and a 3 week old and it was hard but I did that, toddler proofed my house, and lowered my standards when it comes to toddlers and TV.  We became big fans of PlayHouse Disney and Nick Jr.  lol|`|4d33006d173d8d1adcaf0e22cf5af0efaa	lol not that bad remember every pregnancy is different. i personally think its harder to care for a newborn and a 3 yr old|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	Well I can say this. I didnt have morning sickness with first 2 pregnancies at all. They are 9 & 7 and I am pregnant with 3 baby and I had mild morning sickness so each pregnancy is different. It may not be that bad at all.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	My first son was six months old when I got pregnant with my second.  It's really hard during the nausea stage to change diapers.  I didn't even have morning sickness, just nausea, so I couldn't imagine if I did because it was bad.  I work full time so it was extra hard to work all day and then my oldest wanted to play when I got home.  Plus my third trimester was during the summer and I was so hot and tired.|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	I pray nap time is nice and long so I can join DS. I eat snacks with DS to keep nausea at bay...doesn't always work though. Sometimes I have a screaming toddler in my ear while my face is in the toilet.|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	its pretty bad, if you can put a baby gate up and keep him close to you, in my early stages of pregnancy, I blocked off the living room and slept on the couch, and snuggled with my one year old. I tried to get out as much as possible for walks and what nots, but for the most part, as long as your baby is occupied, fed and happy, theres no harm in blocking off the living room and sleeping while your little one plays, if he needs you, he'll let you know!|`|AA12225439	im just like you. thanks for asking this questiom.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	My 1rst daughter was just a little over a year old when I found out I was pregnant with #2. My first pregnancy was a breeze, and the second, well it was a nightmare. I relied heavily on my family and friends and husband to help me through. It was very very difficult for me, having to be a stay at home mom for my daughter and being constantly sick. Thankfully during the summer I recruited my 12 year old niece to come up and help me and that was a life saver. I was able to sleep, puke, and relax a little. It was a sad day indeed when she went back to school, at least the morning sickness subsided a little. Now the only issues are that my daughter is testing my patients to the max with her age and needs. My blood pressure is already high and she makes me more irritable and nervous. Also I am 38 weeks now and its very hard to pick her up properly, and rock her or do things with her. I have a hard time going any where to shop cause i cant run after her and she has to be strapped into a cart or stroller which makes her very angry and moody. She doing alot of stay overs at family and friends to help her get her energy out since i am unable to do it. My husband does a lot but he works all day. If I had a chance to do over again, I think I would have waited till she was at least 3 or 4. Though its not that hard I think its going to be harder when the baby is hear and I lose one hand and arm to it, and have to try to curb my rambouncious toddler. I am curious to see how it goes. <br>  My daughter is turning 2 on the 29th, and I am due with #2 on the 20th... though my docs are saying induction this week :(|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	My first pregnancy was a breeze (though I have severe food aversions and always loose weight) my second pregnancy I ended up on semi-bedrest the last trimester because I had bad SPD and couldn't afford to see a chiropractor.  <br>  <br>  I got pregnant just before my first turned one, that was the "plan" when I gave birth but by the time my son was one I realized that he needed way too much and I didn't want them that close ....can you say WHOOPS!  <br>  <br>  You muddle through somehow.<br>  <br>  You should know that as a rule morning sickness isn't as bad the second time (of course this isn't true for everyone) and if you happen to be breastfeeding breastfeeding during pregnancy *may* reduce the severity of morning sickness.  That may be what helped me, how would I know?
FhKfyxWlaa	You sure can!  I lived on Whoppers with cheese for the last month of my second pregnancy. :)  Moderation though...don't live on it like I did. Have more control than me.  It's not good for you to eat too much fatty greasy food.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Absolutely can eat them, I just wouldn't eat them every day! :)|`|3qLIRorjaa	Yes of course|`|DYZRk07xaa	oh yeah!!!|`|yZuMwhgraa	Yeah of course you can.. try not to eat too many! I was craving pork scratchings and orange flavour lucozade when i was pregnant with my first and this time i'm craving fried eggs. Its crazy! I don't even like eggs normally! xoxox|`|XVljoYZ5aa	Yes but try to limit fast food. Its extra calories without a lot of nutrition. Your cravings could be worse, I knew an ex-smoker who literally craves ashes (like from an ashtray!!). She didn't eat them but she said she wanted to.|`|nGhqwEdpaa	Eat away baby!!! Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun....YUMMY!!!!!!!!|`|AA11542929	yupp ii eat alot of that stuff.. i eat a quarter pounder all teh time just have dont have a huge salt intake.. swelling isnt fun..<br>  \<br>  sorry had to edit it...|`|ec5386a5779664ccb0217f9b4d534397aa	Ohhhh Yeah.

Just be sure that you are eating plenty of other foods, and that your diet does not consist of just Big Mac's.  Remember to drink plenty of water, and eat from every food group!  Take your prenatal vitamin, and if you are having a normal pregnancy, get some exercise, and don't forget to rest!  Having some "fun" food, as I call it, every now and then, will not hurt anything!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your pregnancy!<br>  <br>  Deanna<br>  <br>  Mommy of 7!|`|MvMT8TD3aa	Yes you can .... oh i cant believe you posted that question and i read it i fancy one now!!! When i was pregnant with my daughter i used to get them to put extra cheese in it yummmmmmmmm!!! :0)|`|HKCDdPrkaa	In moderation hun, it's fine to indulge your cravings. But don't go mad. A balanced diet is whats needed when pregnant.|`|d3jtRA8caa	Yes, if you are craving that then eat it. Just don't eat it like everyday.|`|7zG27bSPaa	of course eat what your craving|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Of course you can you silly turkey!!!  Just don't eat it EVERY day.  =)|`|iwYu32N2aa	why cant you?

aCUHzMrmaa	I think snuck is a word...dude I did that with girl scout cookies lolll. They can have those gross coconut ones but the thin mints are on a high shelf that only i can reach.|`|i0Exuxi2aa	It's natural for human to want something for themselves. And you can back this up with the "it's way to early for ice-cream" excuse to ease the guilt. This, one the scale of 1 to 10, would be a 1.2. Not very.<br>  And snuck is the past tense of sneak. I'm not sure if it's officially in the dictionary, but it is a word, or at least an American word.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	This really made me giggle! Especially about snuck being a word! I think about that kind of stuff a lot...<br>  <br>  No your not mean! Mummy's need secret treats sometimes. If I ever do anything like that I just think 'Ahhhh but you saved Faith from about 500 calories, less chance of childhood obesity!'. Warped theory it may be, but I feel a little less guilty for sneaking ice cream!<br>  <br>  I am still laughing, sorry, its just funny reading about this kind of stuff.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Well I guess that makes me mean! When my son sleeps I indulge myself in goodies that I would rather him not eat. Like peanut butter cups, ice cream etc... I also don't let him have pop, so when he's awake I sneak away and get a few sips every now and then! But I'm not stingy with everything! <br>  I thought snuck was a word, but apparently the spell checker thinks different!|`|XPnCeJ29aa	I say snuck.<br>  You are making me second guess myself. Snuck. SNuck.<br>  Yeah you snuck it, you didnt sneaked it. lol<br>  <br>  Not too mean, tell yourself you are saving him from the unhealthiness and you will go grab some grapes for him in 4 minutes.|`|e6b59a221c63b9cad9c07424d6c699a9aa	Sneaked is more correct than snuck but most people will accept snuck as a valid word.<br>  <br>  Mean would be letting her see it if you don't plan to share.|`|CJvHQl5vaa	Snuck is a word.  You didn't make it up.  I doubt you fooled your kiddo, though.  Kids just know.|`|AA11109728	LOL!  I know what you mean!  I always feel guilty when I do that with my daughter at home - but then I figure when she's a grown up she can do things like that too!  So it all works out, right?!  LOL|`|0QYIbn1saa	Only a bowl???  No, it only would have been mean if you snuck the whole pie...which is exactly what I would have done!!!!!  (***sound of my stomach growling***)............|`|CT5uCPmFaa	Haha, no i dont think that your a bad person! You need time for a little self indulgence every once in a while! :)|`|AA12145826	You're not mean, your frugal (I did the same thing with a piece of cake yesterday!)|`|QPKgc1xJaa	Seems like you need some adult time.|`|cgICP4gGaa	uhhh... idk not very|`|drzkJ9ouaa	it's ok dear|`|pT7jrsAgaa	I love this! LOL My husband and I buy extra of the snacks we buy for the kids but hide them on what we call our "selfish shelf"!|`|dBpmyIduaa	LOL, you sound human to me.  I feel the same way when I do something like that and dont' share with my children.  I just think our moral compass is stronger than some, not that we are any better parents, just different.  Some parents can do things, get things, or go places without their children and feel completely guilt free.  I was never able to fully enjoy myself if my children were not included.  Its just the way I am.  There's no reason to feel like you are mean, you did nothing wrong.  <br>  By the way, snuck is the past and past participle from of sneak!|`|b24c2332459ff5e729bf4e973da1e3e3aa	oh that is not bad i do it all the time. as parents we have to share so much of everything. there is nothing bad in wanting something for are selfs once in a while. i mean we give are kids things just for them so why not us.lol|`|ki0yOklRaa	your kids 3 who cares what you eat and dont share your the adult my parents did it to me all the time and i turned out fine.|`|J8RTSrNAaa	let your kid have some you meany|`|BHgtqH9Yaa	Why wouldn't you just share with your baby?|`|1o5Zk9UNaa	why is this under pregnancy? and no i agree u just wanted to eat. ha|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Stepdaughter & I did the same last night.   She ran up to the drug store for me in the afternoon & I told her to get some yummy ice cream for us, for after the kids went to bed.  <br>  <br>  I did make them cookies during the day, though, to assuage my guilt.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	I do that sometimes. Your kids don't always have to eat your food they have to learn sooner or later that mommy's like to eat there own food and that what you are eating is not always what they may have. And I think snuck is a word i use it.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	LMAO I do things like this all the time!<br>  <br>  When I think my kids aren't looking, I will occasionally steal a bite of something. I never really have junk in the house, except when I'm pregnant. So lately  the peanut M&M cravings have been getting to me! I had some the other day - the kids were totally engrossed in a kids' show, I was in the next room, and lo and behold one of them drops everything and looks at me and says, "What are you eating?" It's like they can smell it. It could be something nasty like prunes or dog food and they wouldn't care, but the minute it's candy - the antenna goes up! LOL<br>  <br>  Take heart. You are not alone. LOL|`|uCnmYEPBaa	Snuck is a word, (like you snuck around behind your parents back) and no that's not mean, I have done the same thing.<br>  Sometimes I just don't want to have to share something really good with my kids.<br>  I think every mother and father have done this.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Snuck is a word, since English is more loose then we realize.<br>  <br>  No that's not mean, it's just human.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	lol thats awesome.  and sounds completely delicious.  where is that tunnel when you need it....<br>  'you are slacking on that Jen|`|8oAlBL91aa	Nope trust me you are not the only one who does that. I can't count how many times I have opened a fruit roll up in my desk drawer hoping my 6 year old wouldn't hear haha. I just know if he saw it I wouldn't have it. And you can't say no to them because then you feel to bad lol.|`|yIqYnqk3aa	lolzzz,actually itz kinda cute,i hav also made the mistakes many no. of tyms,it juzt puts a smile on my fac coz after doin this,whtever i hided from my sister i tke her to the market nd let her buy tht stuff again(bigger one(if possible)),so itz kinda cute!|`|1S5AbPueaa	No mean just a mom...who knows the minute everyone else see's the ice cream there will be no more and the bowl you got for you will be gone in 2 minutes and you got 1 bite.I know I have to hide out too:)|`|cYRZpGkqaa	Not sure, but it sounds better than sneaked, lol. You're not a terrible person, I would have done the same. But I guess if you are, we can be horrible snack-sneaking parents together, haha.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	way funny i do the same thing if it is to good to share. do not worry it is ok to have something by your self every now and then?|`|g7gvzhkpaa	no mommy's need treat too ,snuck is a work it's the pasttense of sneek :P|`|1s3nddaYaa	that isn't mean, you just want something for yourself for once:) lol|`|prqrQcd1aa	LOL, i've done stuff like that before. Sometimes we mom's just don't want to share with our children! It's only human!
r7q8LW7Aaa	When in doubt, go to the hospital. They can perform a very quick test to be sure it's not your amniotic fluid - take the soaked pad with you (or wear one to use that), they use a strip that they press on the pad.<br>  Better safe than sorry.|`|d57099e9d0551bf1846f1f00f5fd9648aa	I think your doctor should have checked you out to make sure your water didn't break.  I agree that if you completely soaked through a panty liner that seems really excessive.  I think you should call back and ask to be examined.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	It doesn't hurt to get check out. It is a simple quick test to make sure it is not amniotic fluid. Better to be safe then sorry at this stage in your pregnancy. If you are not satisfied with the doctors answer EVER go in and make them check you over. It is your body and you know it best and know what is going on with you. Good luck to you I'm sure you will be fine:) Go get checked out for piece of mind though ok.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	I would go to the hospital ASAP. If it doesn't smell like urine it could only be one other thing and that is your fluid. You want to make sure that you aren't leaking any fluid. If it smells sweet then its urine. You doctor should have told you to come in. My doctor anyway was over protective.|`|tQPvv0Glaa	Hmm, I've never had that happen.  Was it thin and sticky like discharge, or was it watery or liquid-like, like maybe amniotic fluid?  If it continues, and it's more liquid-like than discharge, I would go in to make sure you're not leaking amniotic fluid.  Better safe than sorry!  Good luck =)|`|tLGbtmGsaa	I agree with Lynne.  When in doubt get it checked out.|`|YuA7a08Maa	You may want to go to the doctor.  If it is amniotic fluid, this needs to be watched immediately.  The hospital can test it easily.  I think your doctor is being a little uncaring.  Maybe his nurses will test the fluid if you talk to them.  Anyhow, good luck to you!|`|HEdGGmkhaa	If it's very watery discharge which it sounds like it may be, it could be leukorrhea, it's common in pregnancy and there can be lots of it!<br>  <br>  Google Leukorrhea and see for yourself :o)|`|HbraP1cpaa	go to the doc, they have a test for amniotic fluid- i'd go immediately-
2pxiK9waaa	Depends what you need it for. If it's mostly for walks outside and the zoo, places with lots of open area, get a side by side. I love the Maclaren. It folds up SUPER small and both seats recline. That's a good side by side for the mall, too. I also like the Valco Baby strollers, but they're huge and bulky and don't travel well. <br>  <br>  I hate the tandem strollers--especially the Graco Duo Glide, etc. They're bulky and huge and hard to push. <br>  <br>  The Phil and Ted's single stroller converts the bottom basket to a second seat, so it's really like pushing a single stroller, sizewise. <br>  <br>  Some swear by the Baby Trend Sit'N Stand. But, that has some of the same issues as the Graco Duo Glide.<br>  <br>  The Peg Perego Duette is the best tandem, but it's also the most expensive. It's much easier to steer than the Gracos.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I'd go for the Maclaren. It's really durable, has higher weight capacities. It is more expensive than the Graco, but it's easier to push and it will fit in your house and your car much better.

Well almost the same ages.  My son is 19 months and daughter is 7 months.  We just bought the Baby Trend Double Jogging Stroller with Swivel Wheel from Babies R Us and we absolutely love it.  I didn't buy it for the jogging part since I'm pregnant, but the swivel wheel is so so so much easier to turn with, or it locks in place.  It so far has fit through the store doors that I've needed it too.  I would definitely take a good look at this stroller.  If you can go to the store and take it for a walk around there.  We paid 189 for it.  REally good for the price.  <br>  <br>  It has a 5 point harness on both sides and each recline individually and it has storage under both seats and pockets in the back of the seats.|`|J5TbYvVZaa	I have the Baby Trend sit n stand Plus. I LOVE it. It's a tandem stroller and the back seat can be removed to become a sit n stand with a jump seat. I find it to one of the most lightweight double strollers I've seen.

LDiBjNf5aa	2 weeks early for your period sounds like it could just be ovulation. Also, women can spot randomly throughout their cycles as well; it's incredibly common. Implantation bleeding happens (usually) about a week - 5 days before your period is due. All you can do is wait for your period, and test when it's time!|`|F03WIKY6aa	This is probably nothing.  If this is 2 weeks before you are expecting your period then this is right around the time you ovulate.  You are most likely not pregnant.  However, if after two weeks you still don't have your period, take a pregnancy test.  You can take the early ones if you are worrying, but those are not always accurate.  I took one early and it said I was not pregnant.  I took a test 4 days later and I got a positive.  Good luck!|`|9zD5HFvAaa	Implantation bleeding is very light, and you may have brown bleeding on the 1st 3rd and 5th day. If you are not sure wait a few days and test. Baby Dust and Blessings to you+~+~+~+~+~+~|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It could be implantation bleeding. Wait two weeks and take a test! Good luck!|`|WmOq6JCWaa	your period is probably just regulating|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Implantation bleeding only last a day, no more than two and is just spotting, only spotting.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Implantation bleeding is normally just spotting (brown).  I don't think its that.  Are you on BCP...you can have breakthrough bleeding with that.
giRRCXU4aa	No, you can't miscarry. It just isn't good for your baby or for you during pregnancy, especially your baby. Caffiene is okay to have, just in moderation. Ask your doctor how much is okay for you to have.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	You can't "miscarry" at 6 months.  But you could have pre mature labor from it. And if your baby is born too early, it may not be able to survive outside the womb. Women that drink 2 or more cups of coffee per day (or 3 or more cans of soda) are twice as likely to have a miscarriage or pre term labor than women that don't drink any caffeine. It is a gamble. I guess you would just have to ask yourself...Is it worth the risk?|`|ca9dEvSAaa	How much are you drinking to ask that?<br>  <br>  At six months you can't misscarry it's called a still birth. This new information on caffine consumption isn't complete yet. Before the dangers of caffine were brought to light many women drank it. I was told the major concern with futher pregnancy and caffine is dehydration. <br>  <br>  You should be fine with 200 to 300mg a day of caffine.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	No but too much is not good for you or baby. It dehydrates you and that can cause preterm labor and low amniotic fluid. I always had my morning cup of joe and that's it. According to doctors guidelines you can have up to 200mg per day.|`|hORVMOHKaa	you dont miscarry this far into pregnancy it would be called a still born and no too much caffine wont kill your baby once your past the first trimester<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!
5h8bYsKdaa	sounds pretty normal. if you are hungry and eating all the time, then ofcourse you are going to gain weight. the baby just had a huge growth spirt so that could have something to do with it.<br>  <br>  im 18 weeks and gained 10 so it sounds like is fine.|`|fAN8snFdaa	yes it is perfectly nomal.. if you are worried about the weight - especially if you are eating loads just make sure you swap anything 'naughty' for fruit and lower fat/calorie foods.. NOT diet foods.. <br>  <br>  Is SOO hard when you are soo hungry all the time..|`|p1nvCTfCaa	yup yup yup.. very normal|`|yVbfWmjeaa	yep its normal|`|2B2fgmw9aa	totally normal! I lost weight due to gallstones in the beginning but now I am eating everything in sight(that doesn't affect my gallstones) and have gained 16 lbs....
6yy0jtzDaa	Nah i think your fine you should wash your hands after touching anything like that in fear of touching your mouth eyes or anything that can harm yourself the nauseous could be labor but you won;t know for sure until you see other signs just take a deep breath and relax|`|2B2fgmw9aa	It's in your head, honey...you should be fine. I actually moved into a new house a few months ago and literally doused my bathroom with bleach!!! I had the windows opens and a fan blowing, but I still got a headache from it. I am perfectly fine and so is my little angel. Although, I wouldn't recommend doing what I did! lol.....|`|JglwzEpiaa	Darlin you are perfectly fine. I do lots of cleaning when I am pregnant. I use nothing but bleach, pin-sol and 409  when I do clean. I have two little boys and a baby on the way and both of my boys were perfectly fine when they were born. Don't stress your self out to much over small things, just relax and enjoy being pregnant.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Congrats.|`|AA11544533	No, it didn't hurt your baby.  It would take much worse expose than the ones you have said to hurt your baby!  Also if it was going to hurt your baby it would be something that would happen in the first few months of your pregnancy, when the baby is developing.  Take a deep breath and try to relax.  I think you are just getting towards the end of your pregnancy and you will notice anxiety will increase.  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Dee
z6IekuwSaa	Don't worry. If she's sitting on her own that means she has the muscle strength to roll over, she prolly just hasn't wanted to yet. lol. My daughter won't roll from her belly to back (which is supposed to be easier), bu she'll roll from her back to belly. I think we just got some stubborn girls who do it their way. lol|`|9pbmYBG0aa	All baby's do things at their own pace. Ignore the guidelines of when they do stuff - thats an average. My youngest is 6 months and yet to roll, my eldest rolled at 4 months, my middle child not till 8 months. No need to worry x|`|dl5ZWzpGaa	No you shouldn't worry. Sounds to me that she should be rolling over very soon.. My little girl started rolling over at about 5 months.  Baby's reach their milestones at all different times.|`|qFmOuXMXaa	my daughter is 6 months too, and she can roll from tummy to back but NEVER does but she still can't roll from back to tummy. I don't know we just have to wait for it.<br>    good luck|`|SNVauR3laa	Don't worry at all. Babies develop at different times. The lists you find of milestones are guidelines. When she is applying for college, they won't ask when she rolled over, and even if they cared, they won't be able to tell. Your baby will go when she is ready. Both my daughters were young when they rolled, but I have an 11 month old who doesn't have any teeth yet, and isn't real interested in walking either. Other mothers try to ask, and compare. They want to feel like their kids are advanced. It is all crap. Their kids who are walking are no more smarter than mine. Your baby will be fine. You are giving her the opportunity. <br>  You can encourage her to roll by putting things out of her reach, and maybe heling push her the last but when she does try, but even without your help, she will get there.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Is she a big girl? Dane didn't roll over until 6 1/2 months. He is a very big baby though. When they are big there is a lot of baby to get in motion. =)<br>  <br>  Even if she is not a big baby the world around her is going to start get interesting soon and she is going to *want* to roll over so she can start to explore.|`|iOSEVRPPaa	If your doctor says not to worry, then I would take that advice.  All babies develop differently, but in the end, usually end up developmentally about the same.<br>  <br>  My son has been rolling over from his back to his tummy since he was 2 months old.  He started rolling from his tummy to his back at about 3 months.  He's 3.5. months and is all over the place.  He is very active.|`|2F5HNPqPaa	My son rolled front to back at 10 weeks (to escape tummy time) and managed back to front last month, 1 week before his 6 month birthday.  <br>  <br>  Don't worry... I know a couple of babies who didn't sit or roll until 7-8 months and are now 10 months and almost walking!  Also, not all babies bother with rolling.. your daughter may skip straight to crawling!|`|CVdcrY3kaa	There's no reason to be worried. You said that she can sit up by herself without any problem & had good head control...she's obviously just doing things at her own pace. I wouldn't be worried!|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	Don't worry!!  My son had rolled over maybe three times by the time he was six months old.  He just didn't enjoy it, and he never enjoyed tummy either like your daughter.  Now that my son crawls around and moves about I see him rolling over to get what he wants and etc all the time.  It'll come when she's ready.  You said she's doing other things like sitting up well and holding her head up and etc so there is no cause for concern.  I know its hard not to worry.  i was saying pretty much the exact thing as you when my son was six months old.  Now we're chasing him all over the house!!<br>  <br>  Good luck and it sounds llike she's doing great!
oXIYHsDaaa	have you changed the brand of diapers or detergent if using cloth? Have you used a new soap for his bath or any kind of bubble bath? This happens to my son if he uses any type of bubble bath or heavy scented soap. He's 6 now and it's been like that since he was a baby, if it's because of the soap it should clear up in a couple of days, but if it doesn't or if he starts crying when he pees then you need to take him in to the doctor because it could be a urinary tract infection.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	does he have hard bowl movements
lGSUToFQaa	well my son is only 8 months but he says the usual, momma, Dada, mommy, baba, now, para (spanish for dog) etc, but i'm teaching him spanish and english but my daughter started really talking when she was 15 months, putting sentences together, still couldn't understand her, but she was talking. so he will soon enough i promise and it sounds like he's already starting.|`|P3e2kJtwaa	My sister (who is almost 4) just started talking completely right before her 3rd bday<br>  My other sister (who is almost 2) is already speaking in full sentences, and has been for close to a year.<br>  <br>  Sounds like your little one is starting to talk.  Just keep talking to him, and encouraging him, he's well on his way! :)<br>  Good luck|`|oXIYHsDaaa	yep it's the start, you can expect some baby words to start popping out soon, but it will be another couple of years before you get real sentences that anyone other then you can understand.|`|2dd7ad59a27b4a34fc13f5e7bbd8ba34aa	No one but my husband believes me, but my little boy said momma at 3 months. When he was upset he would cry "momma" until I picked him up. He was speaking in 2-4 word sentences by 9 months. Now he's three years old and he won't stop talking!! LOL|`|dFo0k3zDaa	My son turned 1 last month and he just said his first word yesterday, which is typically a little slower than most, but still an acceptable age. He said MAMA!!! I was so excited!|`|eth48m7Iaa	they usually start around one but all babies are different. don't worry if he doesn't start talking right away. my oldest son could barely talk until he was two.|`|LxexGPd6aa	Well my daughter started to talk at the age of 5 months but she developed quick. and yes he is starting to talk encourage him by talking to him more and read to him every night before he goes to bed ;)

It came with a mobile and she can just sit there and stare at that thing. It's really convenient and you can take it apart pretty quick and move it around. Good luck!|`|3dT7f39maa	Use a travel cot, thats what we used.
66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	sounds like congratulations may be in order, but simply take a test then schedule a drs appt. you may want to pick up some prenatal vitamins while you are at the drugstore. good luck! :)|`|LJkPRqN0aa	and you havent taking the preg test? why on earth wouldnt you?? i would have way before today.... go to the Dr and get a blood test. those are 100% accurate for preg tests|`|wbnqzpoCaa	It sounds like you are are your breast swollen as well, that is a good indication.|`|pYccUmXBaa	Take a test or go to the doctor.|`|RtIGiGrkaa	i would go get a home pregnancy kit.....|`|dU0ibtU1aa	definitely sounds like the same things i went through when i was pregnant|`|lI42kTXIaa	Oh yeah! Do a Home Pregnancy test!|`|SdVrwd6daa	it is very possible take a test just to make sure then go to the doctors,|`|VdnAH78Xaa	take a test|`|1u2YmEJsaa	yes u could be take a test
kaqPSgTVaa	It can be, yes.
FhKfyxWlaa	They're going to draw a bunch of blood, placed in various tubes. Yes, they'll do a hormone check and also check for ST D's, Aids, CBC (complete blood count), iron levels,  that sort of thing.  Remember that no news is good news, so you probably won't hear anything about the results until your next appointment after the blood work is drawn.|`|sgMno1PRaa	Hi, I had all my blood tests done when i was about 10 weeks as well at my booking appointment, She took about 5 tupes and then, when the results came back it all looked so confusing and all she said to me that everything looks fine. So I never really found out what any of it meant!!|`|LL2dgYMUaa	they will check your blood type fbc (full blood count) this will show up any infections in your system as well as checking your iron levels and for std's such as hepatitus and hiv. (with your consent.)i expect the hormone levels would be checked.if there is no cramping or bleeding then try not to worry yourself i will be 12 weeks on thursday and managed to pick up babys heartbeat on a fetal doppler at home a few days ago if your really worried its a good way of reassuring yourself.|`|YuA7a08Maa	Sometimes they'll test your blood for warning signs of Down syndrome around 10 weeks.  However, for me, they just did an HIV test, a cystic fibrosis test, and a few random tests which I never knew what they were.  Everything came back normal for me except cystic fibrosis...thank goodness my husband isn't a carrier.  Talk to your doctor about confirming your levels, but most places use ultrasound instead of blood as a confirmation at 10 weeks because it's way more accurate.  Good luck!|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	Yeah they take 5 things of blood, but I never heard back but doctors say "no news is good news" So I guess everything was fine =] I asked him though what my blood type was since I didn't know and he told me lol. So you can ask at your next appointment after the blood is taken what it all means or you can ask him before they take the blood when you can find out everything. I am now 15 and a half weeks and go in this thursday to get blood work taken again =/ lol. I don't like needles. Its okay though =D|`|nZVTHKNwaa	I think this test is just to confirm if you are Rh positive or negative.

Osn1xpu6aa	haha I KNOW RIGHT.<br>  let's pretend that this TC badge under my name is non-existent. <br>  <br>  but i don't think i do that.....hm. I've had mine for a while and when i did get i was just like "hm okay cool." <br>  <br>  Also, just because you have one DOES NOT mean that you are a good answerer. It doesn't take a genius to answer a huge load of questions. <br>  <br>  but whatever congrats to the people that got theirs today. Let's all just remember it's an unreal orange tab underneath your name on a website. :]<br>  <br>  EDIT: I don't think she's jealous, I think she's raising a pretty good point.|`|Qydtjz2naa	I don't really see that.  I had one for a couple of weeks, and when I lost it, I don't think my answers changed.  It's just a funny looking bright orange rectangle.  I don't think the people with them act different, although I have seen some people ask questions about whether or not they deserved one.  They're happy, that's okay.  Let them enjoy it!|`|7SCjPftKaa	Hah, somehow I've managed to not gather any haters but then, despite having this badge, nobody seems to recognize me anyway! The rule is to remember that this is a WEBSITE, not anything deeper than that.|`|yFYFSjwcaa	Wow it is true that people who get tc badges get haters really quick.|`|pOZubuOcaa	I'm going to be honest here and say that<br>  yeah i agree that SOME of the TC<br>  think their way better at answering even though it has nothing to do with your answer.  People don't notice that you get a TC badge for contributing a lot in a certain question<br>  <br>  i hate how automatically people think that once they become Tc they get "haters" wow you guys aren't celebrities or anything <br>  <br>  and why would people be jealous of a TC baged it's a freakin orange rectangle that states that you answer a lot of questions on a certain section|`|ads40ROCaa	Its honestly every section, and has been since before I actually got an account here.<br>  There have been questions in the past asked only by TCers that said "I have my TC badge. Do you recognize me now?"<br>  and it was like they expected to be known and that they would get best answers always.<br>  I got hate mail from a TC once because I didn't choose their answer as best answer...<br>  <br>  I had my TC badge for 4 months, and probably wasn't recognized at all!<br>  <br>  Funny how that works eh?<br>  <br>  But it is exciting when you get the badge :)|`|YQrKQ5PAaa	HAHAHAHA. I'm sorry but this is nothing to get in a big tidbit over, kay?<br>  <br>  It's hard work getting a badge, period. People don't go around saying that they're better than anyone else... just that their happy about it.<br>  <br>  I mean... There ARE elite people in sections anyways...<br>  <br>  XD|`|AA11296427	??''<br>  <br>  <br>  Gosh, I only asked a question.

None of them have asked a question  like her.|`|CdJtH0xdaa	Egotistic? Not at all!<br>  I'm just excited, as I've only been in this section for about a week-and-a-half.

D:|`|d397dMRZaa	I've not really noticed anyone be like that with a TC badge. It doesn't bother me too much, at the end of the day I just want people to give me answers.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Nope.  But its okay to be excited right?<br>   <br>  Whooo, livvy was right.  Once you get a TC badge, you get haters ;)<br>  <br>  Hannah, I see your other question got reported.  I wonder by who -_-<br>  <br>  =]|`|E7ViD8EWaa	Holy? I've never thought of myself that way...<br>  *Imagines choirs singing, doves flying, and halo of light*<br>  Well, now that you put the idea in my head...<br>  <br>  Hannah was just happy that she finally got a badge. She spent a lot of time trying to get it, can't you just be a LITTLE happy for her?<br>  <br>  I have yet to see these egotistical views you speak of.<br>  <br>  =]
Jf3DIPcNaa	yeah mine are doing it too... When I was breastfeeding my last kid, I used this stuff for nipples called Lansinoh. It is pure lanolin and very safe and it's kind of thick and creates a nice little protective coating and moisturizes at the same time. You can get it in the baby section of most stores, near bottles and nursing pads and stuff like that. It's a little pricey, but you only need a teeny tiny bit. <br>  Hope that helps. :)|`|NCcpjBL5aa	Mine did with my first child, have no idea why though. sorry! <br>  <br>  Have a feeling it's gonna happen this time too, nipples are very itchy! x|`|gpoi6GKtaa	i did that with both of mine- try drinking more fluids and using moisturizer it should help them to stop- best bet coco butter- it may also help with stretch marks when you start to swell from breast milk!
8WbfmK5daa	I don't think it is really masturbating. I don't think they decide to pleasure themsleves.<br>  <br>  I think it is just exploration realising that there is something down there and wondering what it is, like when they find their feet or hands.<br>  <br>  I do not believe it is masturbation in the adult sense for pleasure at all.<br>  <br>  Children should be innocence not sexualised like this, it is wrong.|`|723QHuicaa	Ok there is a massive difference between masturbation and a child exploring their body. Huge difference.<br>  <br>  What sort of sicko thinks about that?!|`|tZt7fUYYaa	What? What? What? This question freaks me out. I have changed my initial answer after the shock. I did hear that smaller kids get the sensations from things but i never heard of them having orgasms and my baby never touches herself and i hope she never does while im watching. Unless she is washing herself. Its odd. Very odd. Im feeling weird about this question. Its scaring me. eeeep. dont give me thumbs down just because i find the question weird.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I don't have any sources but we were just discussing this at my parenting group and a few of the women remember having orgasms at very young ages (like 3-4 years) they probably did before that but of course people don't generally remember things before age 3.  I've not heard of boys ejaculating -but in males ejaculation doesn't always happen with an orgasm.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.com/21_1135.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.com/21_1135.html</a><br>  What is it?<br>  Babies will often tug on the genitals in much the same way they tug on the ears or toes. Toddlers will begin to recognize that the genitals are special. They are far more interesting and more fun than toes. For some children, playing with the genitals becomes a comforting behavior not unlike thumb sucking. For a few, this settles into a time-consuming habit that takes them away from other important play and development.<br>  <br>  If we take a step back, we can see that it makes sense that kids would want to explore their own bodies. When toilet learning becomes a focus of interest, we might anticipate that kids would also be curious about those parts of the body that have in the past been largely hidden under the diapers. Many kids will reach down every chance they get. This exploration produces pleasurable feelings, as we are well aware.<br>  <br>  This behavior is usually called early childhood masturbation, but the term is misleading. This is not genital stimulation accompanied by sexual fantasy – that will be another challenge to face years down the road.<br>  <br>  Toddlers just do it because it feels good. Unselfconscious delight!<br>  <br>  Who gets it?<br>  Most children begin to explore their genitals at about the same time they begin to look more like little boys and girls than like babies.<br>  <br>  Most, if not all, two-year-olds will engage in some degree of this behavior.|`|lGcpXteaaa	I read a book that explained that a baby had learned that it felt good to 'touch down there'...and it 'appeared' she had reached orgasm.<br>  Whether that's true or not i don't know...but entirely possible!|`|A1QpwziEaa	<a href="http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/childhood_sex_play.html" rel="nofollow">http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_...</a>|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I've read that children can reach an orgasm, but I don't remember where I've read it. I've never heard of babies masturbating though, that's just weird if you ask me.|`|6VR19YQWaa	I can't be sure if they reach orgasm or not, My guess would be that I think it's not that common, but possible<br>  But for those of you who think your babies don't do it, you are blind! They rock or hump or wiggle...they do it. It's natural and normal. It feels good! Why do you think they touch themselves in the bath? Or rock back and forth on the floor on their tummy?|`|1S7uXsInaa	I do not think they are able to, but to the mother that does not think that her child masturbates. . .think again!!!!!!  My son is almost a year and for the past month or 2, when he is naked, he touches himself.  It is not masturbation in the way we think of adults doing it, but they are touching themselves to explore and because it feels good.|`|oMEtUobVaa	What?  I agree with the first writer. Are you crazy?  babies can't masturbate!!!!
2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	yes my whole pregnancy!!! some times i drink plumb source (good tasting prune juice) i also eat a very lot of grapes that always help. dont forget to eat tons of veggies with fiber!  and the last resort is if you go to any drug store or walmart place you can get vegetable powder or fiber powder. use as directed and it will help i promise..<br>  <br>  next time you go to the doctor tell them your problem. they gave me my prenatal with stool softeners and it helped allot!!!|`|LFXTpqfdaa	A plain enema will take care of things immediately with no drugs. <br>  <br>  I had terrible problems, too. My record for not going is 10 days and extra whole grain fiber did not help. Veggies did, though. Once I started eating salad with every meal, plus crudites & dip for snacks, things started moving again. Now I have no problems whatsoever.|`|sAbah6dTaa	try eating foods with a lot of fiber... like apples.<br>  <br>  or you could try to drink some cranberry juice, i've heard that's helped some people. <br>  <br>  or you could ask your doctor... i'm sure he/she has many more ideas.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|K5uoaetaaa	You can take a natural laxative, like syrup of figs.  Ring your doctor, or pop into the pharmacy and ask for advice, otherwise you will get bloated and uncomfortable.|`|35kVNi5oaa	Yes, it's because of all the iron in the parental pills, you can take something like miralax to help you go.|`|89owZt6Haa	start eating a high fiber cereal and drink plenty of water.  you can probably use a glycerin suppository.  ask your obstetrician.|`|TPZZESeeaa	prune juice and coffee. if you can't have caffeine the prune juice will work by itself|`|4XfjUcvDaa	eat alot of fiber.  My doctor told me if it gets really bad then you allowed to take a stool softener.|`|rDw9N09iaa	it is very normal because of all the hormones not to be able to go to the bathroom. i used to have the same problem. it helped me go to the bathroom when i would eat green vegetables, fruit, and drink like apple juice and stuff like that. congrats on the pregnancy too!|`|38902e2ce5f8ef4d27715901e6c92e15aa	This will happen unfortunately. One thing that I cannot stress enough is DO NOT FORCE IT. It will result in hemorrhoids, which are by far more uncomfortable. Just eat lots of fiber, lettuce, and veggies and nature will eventually take it's course.|`|qJBMdL7gaa	These are all safe for pregnancy:<br>  <br>  Metamucil<br>  Citrucil<br>  Fiberall/Fibercon<br>  Colace<br>  Milk of Magnesia<br>  Senekot|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It's very common in pregnancy. I think every OB on earth tells you to use a stool softener if needed - try that and see what happens. Otherwise try to drink more water and eat a little more fiber.|`|SCY0bOr5aa	It is a very common and terribly uncomfortable feeling while pregnant. My Doctor had me use Colace. You can always ask if you want to make sure. It made my world a whole lot more comfortable.|`|6ELSwKKvaa	Call your OB/GYN and ask them what you can take. Being pregnant doesn't keep you from taking all medications, just some. Call them, it is what you pay them for!|`|htSZsds7aa	get some metamusel and start mixing that in water and drink, it takes about 36 hrs to help you go...constipation is very normal in pregnancy.<br>  good luck|`|QzWHMGHJaa	Well ya don't wait 4 days to do something about it!  Drink prune juice and start eating right and drink more water!|`|2pxiK9waaa	Drink some prune juice. That should help things. If it doesn't work, call your OB/GYN for some advice.
0MunIx8raa	You know usually when someone asks this question I never like any of the names.  They are usually ordinary like Katy or Ashley, just plain boring (no offense anyone with those names), but these names are GREAT!  I love Aurora Genevieve and Daphne Coraline.

I would say this or Giselle|`|6xCyC9HSaa	none maybe giselle but def not rowena, i feel like using any of these names except for giselle will lead u to predetermine the uglyness of your spawn.

I think Coraline fits better with the others than Daphne does.<br>  <br>  Gwyneth Aurelia- I'm not big on Gwyneth, but I LOVE Aurelia (in fact, my "fake name" when I go out and someone asks my name is Jessamy Aurelia.)<br>  <br>  I REALLY LOVE the first three. I also like Giselle, but would much prefer to see her with a different middle name. I also like the middle names but not the first names of the last two.  Aurora, Eden, and Laurel seem very much like sisters. I can also picture Giselle and Gwyneth...but not so much Daphne (doesn't that mean "laurel" anyway?)
gs2aPltGaa	You should still go to your appts<br>  You should advise your ob/gyn office that you are waiting for your medical card still at your next appointment so they can write that down on your notes. You can also tell them the name of your insurance and they should have the number for the health insurance they accept so they can call them and verify how much your co pay should be and if you are covered. <br>  Any bills that accrue during the period u are waiting for your medical card will be picked up by your insurance up to 3 months before you had coverage.  <br>  prenatals your doctor can give you samples to last you a month until you get ur card. my doctor gave me samples everytime i went so i never had to go buy any. just explain to your doctor and they will do whatever they can to help you along the way!!!<br>  good luck!!!|`|B0bWrvanaa	The way insurance works is that they will pay for up to three months prior to you getting the insurance if you went for any medical visits. So, if I were you,I would go to a clinic and not a private doctor, they understand the whole insurance situations and are more helpful. Your doctor should ask you if you are taking prenatals and you would tell them no and they will write you a prescription. Being that you don't have insurance yet, you will not be able to get the prescription since they require you to give some form of payment. Any prenatal is fine, I would say a once a day one is better than the twice a day. <br>  Every state has these free clinics,just try and choose one that isreally clean and the staff is nice.<br>  <br>  And congrats! I just had a baby last Sunday and I can't explain the love I feel everytime she smiles.<br>  Good Luck!|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	I never even got prenatals from my doctor I just bought some from the store and asked the pharmacy is these were good and they said yup. I didn't get my insurance till after I had an ultrasound & my first doctors appointment, will they cover those two? I have no idea, but they don't charge you till the baby is born usually.
d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Robitussin cough syrup, any tylenol (or generic) cold and sinus products, and throat lozenges are all on my safe list from the OB.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You need to call and ask your doctor. You are very limited in what you can take.|`|AA11220327	I have had a cold almost permanently through this pregnancy, when i talked to my midwife about it and asked her how i can get some relief, she told me that Benylyn is approved for use durring pregnancy
A1QpwziEaa	not all babies are born with blue eyes.  My son was born with the darkest eyes. eye color can be unstable for years.  my god daughter was born with the brightest blue eyes.  By 1/2 years they started to dull and now at 2, they're more grey...i think they are still changing.|`|SdVrwd6daa	it usually takes about a year for the real color to come in. thats what the nurse told me.|`|VgUAIvEUaa	I was born with brown eyes, you dont have to beleive me but thats what my mum said.|`|tZt7fUYYaa	I wanted to know this ages ago. My daughter looks like her dad in every way except her eyes. (and the beard) Her eyes are mine. Big and blue and i dont want them to change. But her hair is so dark and mine is naturally white blonde and i think she is going to be a daddys girl forever. lol.|`|wTeJulT5aa	My baby was born with brown eyes.  I think most brown skinned babies are born with brown eyes.
1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	My son has been putting his arms up and leaning to people and etc since he was about 7 months.  There is nothing cuter!!  He will do this for me sometimes when people are holding him and I swear its the best feeling in the world!  ha-ha  My son has been crawling forward for almost two weeks now, and this passed Friday when i got home from work I got him to crawl to me when he saw me.  It was sooooo cute!!!|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	yeah about 7 months for my daughter but then she didnt crawl either, she rolled around to where she wanted to go. She didnt learn to crawl till after she walked... weird|`|1S7uXsInaa	My son is a cuddler and loves to be held. . .he started around 5-6 months, I think for that very reason.  He tends to cry if he is not being held so I think that he learned early on how to try to get what he wants!!!!!!!!!|`|UXhFcHCHaa	he started around 5 months but i had no idea what he was doing because he sticks his arms straight out but on sat he saw his daycare teacher and he raised his arms for her to get him and thats when i figured out what he was doing.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Yep, I think it was around that time.  So cute!|`|1WS0ojj5aa	around that time as well|`|nZVTHKNwaa	My son has been doing this since probably around 7.5 months. I think that's pretty normal. Isn't it adorable to watch them do? He is now 8 months old and I love it when he reaches out to me. So precious.|`|qPRLEWVfaa	my baby is 6 months and started doing this... its so cute
AA10196172	The time when women supposedly conceive at 14 days, is the "usual" time - like periods that last 28 days. Some women are different, and sometimes ovulation can happen randomly at the wrong time, just like sometimes periods can be late or skip. (This is why using the calendar for birth control is not that reliable)<br>  <br>  Each phase of a period is triggered by certain hormones building up to certain levels. A hormone builds up to a certain level to trigger the next step... Sometimes for some women those levels are different - they aren't as sensitive or are too sensitive to the hormone(s), or they don't produce the required hormones as fast as expected; so a particular phase - preparing for ovulation, for example; or egg release - will happen at a different time.<br>  <br>  So just because you sometimes or regularly ovulate at an unusual time in your cycle does not mean that your period must be off by the same amount. <br>  <br>  Of course, most home tests suggest that you wait until your period is late. This assumes the usual 14-day timing, so really they mean 2 weeks after the fertilizing event. (First Response suggest they can tell - usually - within 10 days.)<br>  <br>  Even then, you may not produce enough hGC to register. The home tests are not that sensitive and occasional false negatives happen. Try again every so often if you still have symptoms. If you continually get negatives and you think something is still happening, get a blood test from your doctor. They are much more sensitive and accurate.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|FjGeKhY0aa	Not everybody ovulates around day 14, it's just general rule and yes, your period might come a bit later. It's not going to take you longer to get BFP since you're using OPK, it's better than guessing your ovulation days.|`|sFN3iL1yaa	You might want to actually spell out what you mean?  What is TTC? I figured out the rest, but in the future you might want to spell it out for us dummies.
lGrcLQ49aa	My son is 17 and still have a stuffed animal - he doesn't take it anywhere anymore but what harm is it doing for him to have one?  We all have security items even if we don't realize it.<br>  <br>  Don't worry - he is fine.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	I would feel he is ten and a ten year old acts that way. Further more I still sleep with my blue bunny and I am 32 years old.  I am proud to tell everyone.  Whou cares what people think tell them to worry about themselves.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I have a teddy that I got at 2 and I am 25|`|tzRyeX62aa	I wouldn't give it a second thought.  I had a blankie until I got married and my sister (who is 25) still sleeps with her teddy bear.  My Mom found the same one at a consignment shop last year and bought it for her, so she would have a new one, and she shunned it.  Everyone needs something comfortable in their lives.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	There is nothing wrong with it.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Dude I still sleep with mine and im 28. I dont give a damn!|`|iLLoc003aa	IDK but my brother will be 25 in April and he still has his "blankety" LMAO! It is all raggedy and nasty,,,its falling apart and he ties all the falling pies back on lol I joke that the day he gets married I am gonna steal it, have it dry cleaned and give it to his wife as a wedding gift LMAO!<br>  <br>  He's the middle child...so maybe its a middle child thing...?|`|pT7jrsAgaa	My son is 10 also and sleeps with his stuffed dog that he's had since birth....phooey on anyone who doesn't like it.  My 12 yr. old son still sleeps with his pillow that he's slept on since he was a wee lil thing...phooey on anyone who gripes about that to.  It is cute!|`|NNwEuC8paa	Totally normal! My boyfriend is 20 and he still has to teddy from when he was a baby, NO he does not sleep with it or carry it, we live in florida and it is in CT but he wont throw it out for anything.|`|488edafbffd854a7df677efa90768cabaa	Oh, tell them to go get stuffed. Our kids grow up so fast that it's nice to see someone taking it a little slower. I think it's sweet.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	I still have a Pooh Bear I got for my 5th birthday.  He's almost 43!|`|5LBwP3MFaa	I would feel just fine about.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	it is a security thing. he will get rid of it when he is ready.|`|AA10500537	it;s very normal|`|518069c6671837d3e99efe674b52d88daa	this is going to sound ironic, but stop listening to people.  "people" always have something to say, and for every one person that's for something, there will be someone against it.<br>  <br>  if your son is happy, and it's not bothering him or you, doesn't go against your morals, etc.  then what's the problem.  i STILL have my teddy bears  They're no longer in my bed, but they're in my room (and i'm married).  I brought two to college, etc.  They reminded me of happy moments and my family and just make me happy, and i could either be happy or listen to people and not be happy.  I'll chose to be happy, thank you.|`|RiGSq1r6aa	Its ok. I had the same. I could not leave my teddybear untill I was 12 or 13. The bear was the best thing I had and when someone took it away it was for me like losing my best friend. In a strange way this bear "learned" me all kinds of stuff, I had a friend which did not leave me.<br>  So it is normal what your son does. Just leave him have this bear and dont listen to other people. He feels good with it, when he is older he will get over it.|`|9ro8fiKvaa	Ignore ignorant people! It doesn't sound like your son is exhibiting abnormal social behavior at all. He knows what his comfort zones are at home, where he is safe and feels safe. He feels no pressure to act in a way that defies how he really feels. He is still a boy who loves something that reminds him of his younger years ... so what? It is those who are pressuring their children to grow up faster than they are ready for .. those who tell their 10 yr old sons to be 'manly'.WHAT ON EARTH IS MANLY ABOUT A 10 YEAR OLD BOY!!??? There is time enough to be confused about the social conducts of adulthood. Thank you for letting your son be a kid - I wish I knew more parents like you.|`|JpNtisbKaa	Don't worry about what other people say. Kids seem to grow up so fast these days. Nothing wrong with a 10 y/o sleeping with his teddy bear. I'm 42 and still have my old teddy bear from childhood. He sits on my dresser. I have a newer teddy bear also. I do sleep with him from time to time, like if I'm sick or something|`|GmF4iAFXaa	OMG then those people are idiot cause I was like that - and I took it everywhere - and just for your comfort, loads of kids are like that, they have a favourite toy, I still do!|`|txv7TIgiaa	people want kids to grow up so fast  let him be innocent as long as possible he is only ten, if he was 17 it might be different...|`|k8vwm08Faa	you have to be friends with him and talk to him he may miss some one or has a problem so you raely gatta see and care about that|`|olaNxsDFaa	Awwwwwwwwwwww!!
uuHPneEcaa	it could just be ur period sweetie.. calm down.. okay.. wait a few days and if ur period is late then u need to take a test or go to the doctor. alright. and if ur test is negative u need to get on birth control to provent these pregnancy scares okay. and always always have him wear a condom. U are far too young to be a mother. Hell i am too and I am 21 years old.<br>  <br>  and since ur only 16 u are going to get some rude answers don't pay any attention to them okay..<br>  <br>  don't be scared u don't even know if ur pregnant yet. okay. u just need to not worry until u know for sure.|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	Most likely just bloated if you have no other symptoms... if you were pregnant, your belly would not stick out just yet. Good luck!|`|9ARNK0Bzaa	You said you had sex last month, but have u had sex this month, since your last period?<br>  <br>  Just wait until Monday and if you don't come on, take a pregnancy test to put your mind at ease. Also, stressing will make your period later so try not to worry about it either (i know that's easier said than done...)<br>  <br>  I really doubt you are pregnant, it is probably just your body getting ready for your next period.<br>  <br>  -x-x-|`|HJe7ln7gaa	We're going to need more information. Like did your vagina come in contact with any of your boyfriend's sperm?<br>  From what you've said that your belly looks like it's got a bump.... well, actually... even if you were pregnant, your stomach wouldn't show a thing until you were about 3-4 months into the pregnancy. So, that's solved! you're obviously just bloated and you explained the back pain yourself and you don't have any other symptoms so, I would say you're still on the safe side. However, I would recommend taking a home pregnancy test just to be sure. Take it 3-4 days after your period is due next and if your period has not come. Obviously, if you get your period before that time lapses, you're obviously not pregnant.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|QzgkN2LZaa	dont worry! your belly button is not going to pop out right away!! lol im 35 weeks pregnant and mine hasnt even popped out yet!! so just wait it out a few more days and then decide if u need a test or not!! good luck|`|WrOvFyBgaa	i really doubt you have to worry. but you can always take a hpt if you are freaking about it.|`|PN2Tj1vJaa	You're retarded. Use a ******* condom next time idiot.
C55pji5Qaa	First off congrats!Is this your first pregnancy?How far effaced are you?My MFM said that how far effaced you are is a better predictor of labor than dilation.Also,if this is not your first pregnancy you will dilate sooner.You are right you can walk around the same for a while.I have not delivered yet but I can give you my experience. I have been about 80%effaced and 2cm dilated for about 3 weeks and I have had horrible BH for months now.From what I have heard things go quick with twins but you could still walk around like that for awhile.Their is no way to know.I have two friends who have had twins.One had a long cervix with no dilation that went into labor and progressed in one day and another who were similar to our stats and she ended up having to be induced.Good luck,let us know how it goes.Not too much longer.
AA11305214	50%|`|QSodlfMraa	50/50 %|`|NPmRmnG6aa	There is a 50/50 chance of having a girl. My husbands side of the family has not had a girl in 5 generations and we are having a girl. The gender comes from the father but genders do not run it families it is just luck of the draw.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Each time you get pregnant there is a 50/50 chance of either one. We have 3 boys :) Gender is determined solely by the sperm. There are "female" and "male" sperm in each ejaculation. Whichever one fertilizes the egg first, that is the gender of your baby. It is decided the instant conception takes place. We are hoping for a girl this time. We decided to wait and be surprised.|`|sAbah6dTaa	is 50/50 ... unless there is a chance you'd have a squirrel =P|`|sgMno1PRaa	Id say 50% lol!! Good Luck :)|`|276aa285c0c3bcae2ed83a2a0b8cfa53aa	Well, my husband has fathered one girl and 2 boys. We got the girl first. I am pregnant right now and i believe its another boy. So i guess the chances are 50/50 it realy could be either. I understand you would be happy with a boy or girl. I think there is a part though that longs for a girl. I hope i am having a girl again, but hey, if its a boy, its no big deal either. I just think girls clothes are so cute and would love to beable to buy them again. :-D. anyways, good luck with the pregnancy.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	Family history doesn't matter in this case.

WxQFe0GYaa	It depends on what exactly is going on.  If you're concerned, take your concerns to the authorities.<br>  <br>  What would your state have to do with anything?  Just wondering.  Do you think child abuse varies from state to state?|`|vl0HWTDJaa	The law in Indiana isn't at all strict on parents disciplining children. You're allowed to hit children even if it leaves bruises as long as it's not causing 'serious harm', so if he's hitting them as a punishment and they're not suffering long-term damage then apparently it's OK.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Yes it's abuse. I'd contact a lawyer and CPS, get him into some parenting classes.|`|276aa285c0c3bcae2ed83a2a0b8cfa53aa	umm, well I dont know if its illegal in your area, but I certainly wouldnt be happy about it. Is it actually happening? what are your children reporting to you about it? take your lead from them. if they are disturbed by the situation, then your job is to protect your children and you need to take action.|`|TmDabvoIaa	ask him straight up.<br>  ask the kids too.<br>  whats making you think he's hitting them?|`|aQCTR0Heaa	ok|`|baafb5dd2e575ef8a8ffaf18b600cc3baa	i beleive in spanking a child on the bottum just to hurt there feelings. no child should be hit in the head. if it is a hard enough blow it could mentaly empair them or even kill them. so uh yea hitting or walloping  your child in the head would be child abuse.  but the only thing is that do you know that he is the one doing it. on of the other kids could be the one hitting. you need to get to the bottom of this fast because this could turn out horrible.  i would try an get the answer out of the kids and if that dont work go get a supena for him to take a lie dedector test about the hitting.|`|AxtJPPDsaa	something playful is one thing....but it sounds like it is not just fun and games.....I would ask him, but i would also talk to authoriies an dnot allow him to have unsupervised vistiation until its resolved......any child ecspecially young children can have serious damage from getting hit in the head....why would he be hitting them at all? this sounds lke something you need to take seriously!|`|xvapAR5maa	It may be legal in Indiana, but if it happened where I live, I'd personally go to the dad's house and put a beatdown on him. Then, I'd call the child abuse hotline and the cops and have his a$$ thrown in jail. Kids should not be abused! Get a handle on that situation!!|`|27d55f423ea3b282ca812b1d675dd25aaa	HI I LIVE IN ENGLAND HERE IT IS ABUSE TO HIT CHILDREN END OFF TELL HIM TO F888 OFF AND DONT LET HIM HAVE KIDS UNTILL HE PROMISES  NOT TO HIT THEM
9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	It was my left one during my first and second trimester.  Place a warm wet cloth on it if you can, then buy some nipple cream (the kind for breastfeeding), this will replenish the moisture it needs.<br>  <br>  Your breasts are growing and starting to produce all of the wonderful things your baby will need for it's first feedings.  SOme days they will hurt, some days they will have stabbing pains, some days they will point towards the floor like you'd never believe possible.  It's all normal.  <br>  <br>  If you develope any warm, red spots on your breasts, this is cause for concern, usually a clog in a milk duct or other infection.|`|HbraP1cpaa	Don't be concerned. I get shoootttinng pains in both my nipples, with both of my pregnancies. I usually got them right around the 17-20 weeks, and then WALLLAHH I'd get my colostrum. I'm sure your just gunna start getting your pre-milk soon.|`|2hb0Lr2Raa	might be nipple chafing
tLGbtmGsaa	Periods after pregnancy can be very unpredictable and especially when there is stress.  My twins were born Dec 2007 and my periods returned in Dec 2008.  My periods since have varied from 27 days to 40 days.  I have had a lot of stress in the past year.  My mother and the father of my twins don't get along.  So I don't think you are alone.  If you don't get your period in a week, take a test anyhow.  In the meantime try to talk to someone or get some counselling.  It does help.  Take care :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Stress and travel are two things that are bound to change your cycles. A day isn't that late and since you use condoms you are most likely in the clear.|`|def5d056753c507adaad1d31c72512beaa	stress causing a period to be late, if youdont get it in 2 weeks take a test|`|Tvcn83Adaa	More than likely it is just stress.<br>  <br>  Go to a family planning clinic and get some more reliable birth control.  While condoms are effective if used properly, most people do not use then 100% properly, and it makes the effective rate (with out foam) in the low 80%.  You're married, if STDs are not a risk, then get on the pill, patch, etc.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Wow, you certainly do have a lot of stress in your life. This could cause your period to be a few days late. Give it another few days, and if it doesn't happen you can get a test.|`|sAbah6dTaa	only when i was pregnant.|`|qYDcqa0Laa	It sounds like you are under a lot of stress. It's unlikely that you would be pregnant if you have beenn using condoms, but why not test and put your mind at ease - rather than having another thing to worry about?|`|AA11112387	yea i kinda have the same issue.  my period is 2 days late..i've been under alot of stress lately..so im hoping it's just the stress that is making my period late.|`|AA10849946	Girlfriend, just try to relax. You've got a lot going on in your life and Mother Nature knows when you're stressed. Chillax and have some chocolate.

dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	That is horrendous.  I'm not sure why anyone would say something so cruel.. I'd like to believe that they just don't know better, but they do.<br>  <br>  That said, the person who said it does not understand human physiology, so don't give them too much credit for anything.  Humans are carnivores. We are meant to eat meat. That's why we have incisors (for ripping meat), molars (for grinding meat fibres) and stomach acid (for breaking down the unground fibres).  This person has bigger issues than you can know if they can't even acknowledge their own species.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	How rotten. Yes.

BW7Nrqjzaa	Just wondering how old your baby is? I personally think babies should never have to hold there own bottle, it is convenient, but it really should be a special bonding time between you and your son!!<br>  <br>  We started finger foods around 7 or 8 months. But we did baby-led-weaning. Which means they started out with pretty chunky food to begin with. As soon as baby has a pincer grasps and wants to eat more solid food I would start with cheerios and see how they do. Some of the firsts after that were ripe avocado, pasta, ripe melon, broccoli, etc... Basically anything you can over cook!|`|6VR19YQWaa	This varies widely for each baby. Some never hold their own bottle. Some can, but prefer to throw it  and play with it and not eat. <br>  Some kids just wait for that cup. <br>  <br>  The finger foods can be started when he can sit up unassisted and sit well in a high chair. <br>  My favorite is cheerios. My kids ate loads and loads of them.<br>  Also, banana, cooked vegatables (not corn) cooked chicken, anything soft that falls apart easily will work.  They say to save the corn, strawberries, grapes, oranges and eggs until 1 year. (corn and grapes are hard to digest)
PDcnXgE6aa	No....in puberty girls don't ovulates ....means her ovary does not produces eggs which can fertilize|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	No  ovulation take place during that time Good luck........)|`|AA11929260	No.. No.. No.. Baby<br>  Why u ask this question.<br>  Are you having sex with some one?|`|htSZsds7aa	plz expalin more....|`|DtjBqGgXaa	Nooooooooooo way........................... <br>  Unless god creates some kind of a miracle.............|`|TFA0qhDHaa	no... need a period first to conceive|`|obN6p3Cgaa	No way.............)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No. You need ovulation to get pregnant. Before puberty a girl does not ovulate and there for she cannot get pregnant. It is possible to get pregnant before you get your first period though if you have sex during your first cycle and don't realize it.
vLCq6qvyaa	They grow fast.  A little of each, and if they are a little big it won't matter as much before she starts crawling anyway.|`|SCY0bOr5aa	Babies live in sleepers for about the first 2 months of there lives. It makes diaper changes easier and more comfy for the little one. I would buy 0-3 sparingly. 6 - 8 sleepers should be a good start. For 1 they grow fast and sometimes they are born bigger than we actually thought they would be. Yes, she will be really tiny starting out. 3-6 month size is perfect, growing room. When I had my 1st he had to everything new. As time went on I saw the benefits of Garage Sale and 2nd hand store clothing. You can get things ranging from a quarter up to a dollar. Sometimes you find something really cute and pay a little more. They are hardly used because they grow so fast. So its like buying new but get it for a fraction of the cost. You can also find gently used baby merchandise. Strollers, execausers and things to that nature. Having a baby is expensive but you can do it on a budget. We have 3 money has to go a very long way on one income.|`|AA12041870	Anything up to the age of 18 years is going to come in handy since the baby is going to grow everyday.|`|iwYu32N2aa	I asked this question also and they say stock up on 3-6 months. to me newborn and 0-3 months are the same size if you put the 2 together side by side. Its easier to put a baby in clothes that are bigger then smaller.<br>  <br>  <br>  y give thumbs down when people answer your question?<br>  sry then|`|AA11603810	3-6 months is just as important IMO... newborns grow VERY quickly and they may be bigger than expected... thus fitting into newborn a very short amount of time, if not at all.  They'll be fitting info 3-6 before you know it. <br>  <br>  Most urgent is onesies, sleepers, diapers!!|`|6ELSwKKvaa	My 8 Lb. baby never even fit into newborn. You will be lucky if you can even use the 0-3 month clothes for a week. You need to buy more 3-6 month and even up to 12 Mo. sizes.

It probably wont take very long before 3-6 month sized clothing will fit, just might be a little big. When are you due? Im 23 weeks tomorrow!!:) Supposed to be due July 7th but according to my ultrasound, I'm due the 6th. Assuming July will be very warm where you are, the baby wont be wearing much more than t-shirts and onesies so 3-6 months size should be good.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	She doesn't necessarily need newborn size clothes!  They are usually only good up to about 8.5 pounds or so.  My son never fit into some of his newborn clothes.<br>  <br>  Don't buy too much before she arrives, because you don't know how much she will weigh.  And you don't know what season she'll be what size.  For example, my 9 month old is wearing 18 month clothing now.|`|TFA0qhDHaa	since spring and summer is coming up I am a true fan of yard sales.. you can  buy a supply of a lot of cheap sizes.. just buy a little of everything... remember babies don't stay in the same size for very long.. congrats and good luck|`|NWTfFEuVaa	I'm having my first baby too and I am buying stuff for up to a year old cuz I heard some babies grow really fast.

You suprisingly don't need as much as you would think for a newborn.

5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	The only rights a grandparent gets are the ones given to them by the parents.  If a parent is not in the picture, then the courts would probably allow grandma visitation, but in your situation, i can't see that happening.  I think she's just blowing smoke over the whole thing.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Aww. My pastor's wife are going through this with their son and daughter in law. As of 2 years ago CA passed a law cancelling Grand parents rights. You hold all the power as long as you have custody.<br>  <br>  I don't know about PA, but I do know that even when CA had those rights, they are VERY HARD to actually get a court to use them.|`|Ueix2Q7Taa	I don't think so. My husband and I are on the outs with his mother because of her overbearing attitude and she isn't allowed to be around our son (it's a long story but she's had more than one chance to make it better but chose not to). I'm pretty sure it's completely up to you, they're your children.|`|4p9sBdyTaa	In Pennsylvania, Grandparents have the opportunity to seek custody of a Grandchild under limited circumstances. The Pennsylvania Statute enunciated at 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 5313, sets forth the circumstances under which a Grandparent may petition for Custody of a Grandchild.<br>  <br>  A Grandparent may petition for Partial Custody and Visitation where an unmarried child has resided with his grandparents or great-grandparents for a period of 12 months or more and is subsequently removed from the home by his parents. The court will grant the petition if it finds that visitation rights would be in the “best interests of the child” and would not interfere with the parent-child relationship. The best interests of the child is the standard used in all custody cases in Pennsylvania. In it core form, the best interests of the child means what is best for the child’s physical, moral, intellectual and spiritual well being.<br>  <br>  A Grandparent may petition for Full Physical and Legal Custody of a grandchild if it is in the best interest of the child to not be in the custody of either parent. In order to qualify for such type of custody, the Grandparent must (1) have genuine care and concern for the child; (2) have a relationship with the child which began with the consent of a parent of the child or pursuant to an order of court; and (3) who for 12 months or more has assumed the role and responsibilities of the child's parent, providing for the physical, emotional and social needs of the child, or who assumes the responsibility for a child who has been determined to be a dependent child or who assumes or deems it necessary to assume responsibility for a child who is substantially at risk due to parental abuse, neglect, drug or alcohol abuse or mental illness.<br>  <br>  In attempting to establish a Grandparent’s rights to either Partial or Full Custody, the Pennsylvania Courts will consider the following factors: (1) the amount of disruption extensive visitation would cause in the child's life; (2) the suitability of the grandparents' home (3) the emotional ties between the child and the grandparents; (4) the moral fitness of the grandparents; (5) the distance between the child's home and the grandparents' home; (6) the potential for the grandparents to undermine the parent's general disciplining of the child as a result of visitation; (7) whether the grandparents are employed and the responsibilities associated with such employment; (8) the amount of hostility that exists between the parent and the grandparents; and (9) the willingness of the grandparents to accept the fundamental concept that the rearing of the child is the parent's responsibility and is not to be interfered with by the grandparents.|`|vLFhGJuXaa	check with an attorny,  each state is different about grandparent rights also start documenting everything she says does and does not do such as   asks to see your children the last time she asked to see them how she treats them  sure you get the idea|`|1s3nddaYaa	some places have them, does she mean as in taking the children from you? cuz thats what i thought it meant, as in grandparents taking your rights away and watching your children.. if that one is it, then she would have to prove you unfit..if its just so she can see your children like every other weekend then im not sure.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	She can but I really doubt she will...Sounds like she just likes to cause problems.

eC1dQVcgaa	It is a condition that occurs in pregnancy that can be fatal to mother and baby if not detected and treated properly! <br>  <br>  I was diagnosed with it at 30 weeks and was admitted to hospital for in forced bed rest until i was able to deliver.. <br>  <br>  People on her will tell you alsorts, but doctors midwifes etc actually don't know 100% what it is, how it is caused anything! <br>  <br>  All they know is it is something to do with the placenta, it doesn't attach to the womb properly which cause low oxygen flow to the baby, and high BP with all the other symptoms you get! <br>  <br>  From experience, it is a really horrible disease and if anyone thinks they may have it, get straight to the hospital.. Mine couldn't be stopped and labour had to be started, and it made my labour worse as i was drained and exhasted from the illness i couldn't do anything! <br>  <br>  =[<br>  EDIT<br>  Just looked a one of your previous if you think you have Pre-eclampsia get to the hospital, my condition deteriated over night. Please speak to a doc or midwife, not us un qualified people here =[ xxxx|`|FhKfyxWlaa	What is Preeclampsia?<br>  <br>  Preeclampsia is a disorder that occurs only during pregnancy and the postpartum period and affects both the mother and the unborn baby. Affecting at least 5-8% of all pregnancies, it is a rapidly progressive condition characterized by high blood pressure and the presence of protein in the urine. Swelling, sudden weight gain, headaches and changes in vision are important symptoms; however, some women with rapidly advancing disease report few symptoms. <br>  <br>   Typically, preeclampsia occurs after 20 weeks gestation (in the late 2nd or 3rd trimesters or middle to late pregnancy), though it can occur earlier. Proper prenatal care is essential to diagnose and manage preeclampsia. Preeclampsia, Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH) and toxemia are closely related conditions. HELLP Syndrome and eclampsia are other manifestations of the same syndrome. It is important to note that research shows that more women die from preeclampsia than eclampsia and one is not necessarily more serious than the other. <br>  <br>  Globally, preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a leading cause of maternal and infant illness and death. By conservative estimates, these disorders are responsible for 76,000 maternal and 500,000 infant deaths each year.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  Why am I getting thumbs down for sharing information?|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	It is high blood pressure that occurs during pregnancy. Usually in women that have never had high blood pressure before. It normally happens towards the end of the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To the first poster:<br>  <br>  Because some morons think it is funny to give thumbs down to the right answers just to be jerks. Just ignore them.|`|3dT7f39maa	My wife had it before our son was born, the midwife saw her blood pressure and decided to induce. Its basically sky high blood pressure during pregnancy.
qHjOs83Maa	Even if you put it nicely, she may or may not listen. She may decide to break up your friendship, and for your son's welfare that might be a good thing. You can also keep your mouth shut and simply distance yourself from her. Which would have the same result. Or you can risk all and tell her and see if she changes, and your friendship continues to grow.<br>  <br>  People as a rule, become defensive when you mention that their children are not receiving adequate or suitable care. Think about how you would feel if you were her and she had told you that. From your words, I am fairly confident that you do your best for your son. Continue to do that by making your decision based on what is best for your child. I know you love her child too, but know this.<br>  <br>  You mentioned the "condition of their home". I don't know the circumstances, but I know that either she cannot escape/change it, or she chooses not to. If you've been friends for 7 years, she must have some level of common sense and knows that things are not the best for her son. First, try and nudge her a little into changing the conditions and work from there. But remember, your own son should be your main concern. Your duty is to protect HIM at all times.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|k8vwm08Faa	if you are her best friend you can tell her that honestly and maybe she will take it but don't push her too much she may get sad from you ...|`|AuKKjaxaaa	Nobody wants to be given unsolicited parenting advice.  Then again, it doesn't sound like she cares much to begin with.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately I don't see your friendship with her lasting given her disregard for her son and your obvious polar opposite.<br>  <br>  In terms of talking to her .. if you feel you must, I suggest talking about things that can be done for her son without directly blaming her for his condition.  Blaming her will make her defensive and kill any benefit to the conversation.  At least, that's my guess from where I sit a thousand miles away.|`|RBQrgByeaa	Well, she's making the kid into a nutjob and a drag on society. Who fails kindergarten? You just need to tell her.

If there is anything wrong, with him, it's up to her to change the situation - not you!  <br>  If it really bothers you that much - walk away from the friendship and go on with life.  If she wants help - she will ask.|`|4vbovQKJaa	You don't tell her anything.  Having someone, even a well-meaning friend, "attack" your parenting skills will cause a rift that may never be fixed.  <br>  <br>  I would strongly suggest that you talk to her about family counseling under the guise of getting help for the child.  Family counseling will work on her, her child, and their relationship.  If this child is already this violent in kindergarten, nothing you say will do any good - he needs professional help.|`|tTh2Q7etaa	first of all it sounds like your friend needs the psychological help not her son. second if he does not have a stable environment at home and he is not shown that there are consequences to his actions why would he be expected to behave in a "normal" way anywhere else? he doesn't have "problems", his mother has a parenting problem. i can understand you not wanting your child around him, i wouldn't either even if she was my friend. honestly you can't say anything unless she asks for your advise. im sure you think you are doing the best for your child, but could you imagine someone coming up to you and saying that what you are doing is wrong for your child. beware if you do say something to her im sure you know the wrath of an angry mother pushed into a corner, they will attack.
iwYu32N2aa	Meth wouldnt be in his sperm, so no<br>  <br>  As far as I know, there's been no research on the impact of crystal methamphetamine on the quality or "health" of sperm. As you know, drug use can alter sexual performance, yet that may have no effect on the sperm. There is some research that indicates one may produce a different amount of sperm (usually less), yet even that doesn't mean that any sperm is abnormal or damaged.<br>  <br>  It's reassuring that your wife was not using before the possible conception, but even being high at the moment of conception isn't necessarily a problem.<br>  <br>  The BIG problem for babies is use during pregnancy. There's a mountain of literature about smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol while pregnant. It's all bad news. Several of my female friends who like to smoke and drink abstained during pregnancy to maximize their child's health. There's not as much science devoted to using crystal while pregnant, but I'm really comfortable saying it's also bad news.<br>  <br>  There's no guarantee that your use had no impact. The best you can do now is, once you find out if your wife is pregnant, support her in any way you can to avoid recreational drug use and take excellent care of herself while pregnant.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I found out my bf had used cocaine 2 times when I was 10 weeks pregnant.

The sperm doesn't contain meth.  <br>  <br>  Now if you took meth that would be a different story. <br>  <br>  If this is really the case it looks like you picked a real winner there.|`|68l1TeDjaa	WHY IN THE WORLD ARE YOU GETTING PREGGO BY A MAN THAT IS DOING DRUGS ANYWAY!?!?!?

ALL the nutrients a body needs can be found in food. Do not be fooled into thinking that you have to take supplements. Eat more fruit, veg, chicken, fish, nuts & seeds and you will be fine. Damn sight cheaper too.<br>  <br>  Remember lots of green veg.<br>  <br>  EDIT - the link gives a website showing how much folic acid you need and where to get it without supplements. One service of a fortified breakfast cereal can give you the recommended 400micrograms a day. You DO NOT need to spend your money on supplements. The human race has survived for thousands and thousands of years before Holland and Barratt came along. Eating vitamins in their natural state is far better and cheaper.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.health.state.ny.us/nysdoh/folic/1335.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.health.state.ny.us/nysdoh/fol...</a><br>  <br>  And I never said that vitamins were a waste. I said buying vitamin supplements was a waste. There is a big difference.|`|sstNdyYVaa	hey hun!<br>  <br>  you should take pre-natals JUST incase you are missing out on any mineral or vitamin so that it can make it up!<br>  <br>  Pregnacare is the best, although its a bit pricey<br>  <br>  all the best xx|`|aKFhuIoWaa	Whatever people say it is important to take folic acid in at least the first 12 weeks or pregnancy, you can buy this on its own or take a supplement. I use the Sanatogen Pro natal ones, which you can get from Boots of most chemists or big supermarket. The good thing about the supplements are that if you have any sickness or lack of appetite (which most women do in early pregnancy ) then you know you are getting all the vitamins essential to a healthy pregnancy.|`|xZWP2mqjaa	I started taking Boots own brand 'Mum to be plus'. They were on offer at the time (3 for 2) and they have all the same vitamins and amounts as the big brand names. They're a bit like a horse pill though - massive to swallow. Plus, if you have an advantage card, you can join their health club which means you can get Boots' own brand medicines at half price.<br>  <br>  Also, join their parenting club. You'll get offers for baby products through the post as well as double points on promotional items. then you can obviously use your points to buy more stuff for your baby.|`|4X6MwQJRaa	I took Pregnacare all the way through.  They are designed to be taken throughout the whole pregnancy and if you are breastfeeding.  You can get them from any pharmacy .. I got mine from Boots. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.boots.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10052&productId=6361&callingViewName=&langId=-1&catalogId=11051" rel="nofollow">http://www.boots.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...</a>|`|AA11103493	Don't bother, they're a waste of time.  Just make sure you get the fresh food you need.|`|68l1TeDjaa	im from the US hope it dont matter.<br>  <br>  i would recommend get a doctor and they should prescribe you some prenatal vitamins. the ones that you buy in the store, are not as good as what the doctor gives you. and i wouldnt trust the one on the shelf. dont listen to these people either that tell vitamins are a waste. they are not a waste. i know people that didnt take vitamins their whole pregnancy cuz they thought the same way, and there babies have major health problems.|`|CKadCmnZaa	Folic acid is most important up to 14 weeks<br>  and then take pregnacare. But everyone is right you can get most vits from foods. Iron is important if u wanna avoid iron tablets later on so eat plenty of iron rich food, such as greens, red meat and orange juice helps absorb iron.|`|hinPfju4aa	Prenatal Vitamins are a must! You can buy them over the counter and they work just as well, make sure they have calcium, iron, and folic acid. And do not forget to eat healthy loads and loads of vegtables and fruits.
3zg7oBA5aa	Like everyone has said,the parents cannot force him to stop smoking.<br>  <br>  He is being very careless thinking that it is really"cool" to endanger all of those children, especially  the young ones and the one allergic to smoke.<br>  <br>  When he smoked in his brother's car, did his brother complain?<br>  <br>  As for the smell, try adding baking soda to the ash trays, and make sure to tell him to use them!<br>  <br>  the baking soda will trap a lot of the odor and should help a little bit.<br>  <br>  As long as he is living with his parents, he shoudl respect their rules and he should grow up!<br>  <br>  he sounds very irresponsible and careless. i hope you resolve this issue. good luck|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Well, he is an adult and choose for himself....however, if he lives in their home then he has to follow their rules.  They have a right to tell him he can not smoke in their home, but can outside or even say he may not smoke on their property as well.  That is pretty much all they can do.|`|Tvcn83Adaa	No matter how old he is, it is her house.  She has every right to tell him NO.  Be firm and tell him, no smoking in the house, or he can find a new place to live.  If he leaves his stuff sitting around the house, then she should pick it up and throw it in the trash.<br>  <br>  If his temper is an issue, and he'd harm his own mother, then she needs to have someone else with her.  If he harms her in any way, call the police.  She should not be afraid of her own child, if she is, then it is past time for him to live else where.  Tough love, kick him out, or get him therapy.|`|peQGGFPYaa	you all need to keep in mind that hes is 18 years old and has the right to smoke if he wants to. So maybe instead of going down the dont smoke its bad for you blah blah blah speech, tell him that it is his decision. It is his decision to smoke and if he chooses to do so that is fine but that he needs to be respectful of others. Say that he can smoke all he wants but he needs to invest in an ashtray for his butts ( this way they are not on the lawn or in your puppys mouth) that in other people's cars he needs to ask if he can smoke since it is not his property 18 or not you have to respect others opinions. Tell him he needs to have a safe place for his tabacco and filters you respect his choice but don't want every other child in the house getting into his mess. He needs to understand that you accept his smoking you dont like it but its not your decision and you need him to understand that he needs to  be respectful to others as they do not enjoy smoking. :-) best of luck to you.|`|8Bl8XQh8aa	Tell him to quit smoking or move his *** out, because smoking will not be tolerated.|`|SdVrwd6daa	kick his a** out. there are r rules that need to be followed and if hes not going to do that then he has no business being there,|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Long story short....he needs to quit or move out!|`|0mvEWyvwaa	Need to reiterate your concerns for others involved regarding their health, etc.  (in a polite, uncondescending way).  Tell him that he needs to respect wishes of whomever is the head of the household, or he simply can find another place to live.  Call the police if he gets violent.|`|1SxFP1Chaa	Their house their rules. Chris don't like it then move.|`|2NtwlyO2aa	This is what is called an "intervention".  If Chris is now 18 and no longer in school, I would hope the parents would, during the intervention, tell him that this is THEIR home and they make the rules.  If Chris cannot obey the rules, then he should find another residence.  You do not say if he works.  <br>  <br>  Truthfully, this kid is looking for the attention and he will take it even if its negative.  If his temper is so awful, suggest counseling.  If he is so arrogant, then it is time for him to go.  <br>  <br>  Start the intervention as follows:   We are here because we care about you, Chris and we want to help you.  <br>  <br>  Then state your reasons :(each of the adults:   16 and up) as to why his smoking in the house bothers you.  <br>  <br>  Be prepared for the anger but all of you stay calm.  Then it is time to see if he will go get some help for his smoking ( I doubt he will).  <br>  <br>  Your parents then need to tell him:  if you cannot stop smoking or plan to continue, you are going to have to get a job and move out.  You have 60 days.   AND STICK TO IT.   <br>  <br>  He will be mad, but it sounds like Chris needs to grow up and act like an adult.|`|PHzyDoKuaa	start flushing his Cig's that he leaves out in the opened down the toilet.<br>  or throw him out of the house!<br>  you can't make him quit smoking, but he should have the common decency to keep it out of view of the young ones.|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	I would tell this boy that I do not care how old he thinks he is.. he still lives in his parents house .<br>  <br>  Temper or no temper.. EVERY TIME he lite up a smoke I would take it from him.. if it came to a fist fight, then so be it..<br>  <br>  he is continuing to smoke in the house and cars because NO ONE is MAKING him STOP..|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Um I would just ask him not to be smoking in the 16 yr old car, or in the house. They cant make him stop smoking ciggs, but as long as he does it outside and it isnt inside what is the problem? Also tell him to get a tin can or something that he can put the butts in, instead of on the lawn which i could find annoying. Other then that there is nothing anyone can do, just dont go at him all ready to fight or make him feel like he is being attacked. Just ask him nicely instead of saying "I DONT WANT THIS CRAP IN MY HOUSE,STOP DOING THIS STOP DOING THAT" It would make me a little defensive myself. Good luck
059a9b55284608546a32f5eabf3402eeaa	Its totally normal. Some women have symptoms from the day the egg implants in their uterus, while some go on for months and not realize that they have symptoms, or they just don't have any symptoms at all. As long as your doctor says that everything is alright with you and baby, you have nothing to worry about, as this is normal. If you haven't as yet, make an appointment to see an ob/gyn to be certain that everything you are feeling is totally normal. Good luck :)|`|AA12338884	some people go through this its call denial because some people don't want to be pregnant or they  or they have serious anxiety|`|YuA7a08Maa	Sounds like my pregnancy symptoms.

4CMQuJgOaa	honestly at 1 i wouldnt waste the money for a "big" party, he will not remember it as much as you and your family will, I would do his 2nd birthday. <br>  <br>  His 1st birthday is really for you to enjoy, do something small at home with pizza and cake or finger foods. Make sure to get him a little smash cake and take lots of pictures!|`|6c895101395a4cc5206820503ae931fbaa	No, I don't think so. In my opinion, you should keep first birthdays at a minimum. Too much activity and too many people could overwhelm your son and cause him stress. Chuck E Cheese is definitely too old for a one year old. Keep it simple, throw a small party with close friends and relatives at your home.|`|4cfa2bfa1cc084b82ae78bcdf60616d4aa	It would probably be best to wait until he's at least five. I worked a Chuck E. Cheese and it  would be a waste of your money to do it there. He might be walking but can't really play in the tunnels or play any of the video games.<br>  Usually the first birthday would be more for the adults than the kids.<br>  My friend's just threw a party for their one-year-old and they had it at their house, ordered some platters from Chick-fil-a and had a cake for the baby to "eat" and one for the rest of the guests. They also had some games set up for some of the older kids to play so they didn't get bored. It turned out really nice and we all received a cute picture of the birthday boy with his cake in the thank you note.|`|baafb5dd2e575ef8a8ffaf18b600cc3baa	i guess that would be ok.  your the mom. your the boss. lol it depends on how relaxed your child is in loud buisy places. i think that chuckie cheese is a biger ked place though.  honestly i like the good old family and friends at the house idea with a theme of thomas the train or elmo myself.|`|TFA0qhDHaa	not really... my 17 month old daughter is terrified of the giant mouse.. I would wait until he is older so he can enjoy it..
6LxXR61Waa	Well, they say it's great for the baby if you can do it drug-free because of course, some of the drugs get in their system and can make them groggy, but then again .. they don't remember it and YOU DO!  So, I would suggest that you have the epi planned and then just go with your gut once you get there.  Personally, I plan on having the epi.  I hate pain and I'd rather have it take 10 hours with an epidural, than 1 hour without.  But that's just me.<br>  <br>  Also, just because you've had fast labors before, doesn't mean that they'll be that way every time .. but good luck!  Fast is better than slow!!|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Have the Epidural. Why suffer when you don't have to? I was a martyr with my son and had a horrendous birth.  With my daughter I had the epidural and it was the most peaceful wonderful experience.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	Well, I definitely wouldn't get the epi in your case. I went almost 20 hours before caving and getting it, and still wish I hadn't had to. I'm expecting another baby in 3 weeks, and I'm going to try to go natural this time. The epidural makes the baby lethargic, and there are side effects. My cousin just had her son, and ended up with a spinal headache because of the epi. (They poked her in the wrong place while inserting it.) She couldn't enjoy her son for the first week because she was in so much pain. If your longest labor was 3 hours, you can definitely do it without it!!<br>  <br>  As for inducing, I'm not sure what I'd do. My preference would be to wait it out and let nature take its course, but you're right that you don't want to have the baby in the car! What does your doctor suggest? Maybe camp out by the hospital once your due date approaches. LOL.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|mVD3TQkFaa	LOL. at the shot of whiskey thing! I would induce that is very quick labor. I know you don't want to mess with nature but it may be best in this case. If you want to do the natural thing don't get the epi. I know it hurts like hell but with that quick of labor who cares it's over really fast! Gosh your so lucky I had 33 hours of labor! yuck. Good luck hope you don't have that baby in the car;)

Swollen ankles and legs is normal, I just asked my Dr. 3 days ago, it's because of the water and extra weight. Shortness of breath are not something unusual too, it happens, but if it starts to get worse or bothers you, just ask your Dr.|`|TyZ3OX0Oaa	Many women experience this sensation as their pregnancy advances. You need more oxygen during pregnancy, and while the number of breaths you take per minute actually changes very little during pregnancy, the amount of air you take in with each breath increases significantly. Later in pregnancy, as your growing uterus puts pressure on your diaphragm, your breathing might feel more labored. You may get some relief a few weeks before you're due at which time the baby drops into the pelvis.|`|000cec0ed22ec167c9a8cf98303156dcaa	Shortness of breath is totally normal in pregnancy. I remember feeling that way the last 4 months of my pregnancy. It's a part of being pregnant, however, if it gets too much, go see your doctor.<br>  <br>  As for your ankles and legs being swollen? I would get them checked out. If you're feeling dizzy at all, it could be a sign of preclamsyia. This is very dangerous to both mother and baby. Protein in the urine can also be a sign of swelling as well as high blood pressure. I would really get that checked out by calling the nurse line at your doctor's office. <br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck|`|68l1TeDjaa	every pregnancy is different though. ask you doctor though to make sure nothing is wrong. i had shortness of breath but they said its normal. i had a girl, and for the last 1 month or so she was all up in the ribs kicking which made it harder to breathe. just talk to your doctor. swelling is normal, but excessive swelling is not, and i had excessive swelling the last 2 weeks. i had pre-clampsia, it was bad, on the border of a seizure. just prop your feet up and rest. they ended up taking my daughter at 35 weeks, cuz my blood pressure had gone up so high it blinded me. my hands, feet, legs, and ankles were triple their size and my face had quite a bit of swelling.|`|fTLzKg5Eaa	you must go to Doctors...shortness of breath my friend has it and so does her baby so she takes extra medication for it... and swelling in ankles has something to do with your pressure...rest your legs and put them up in the evenings but still go to midwifes or doctor and get checked.... dont worry though you know thats most important|`|pOd9qTklaa	I have been going to the doctor for the same thing. For near fainting, shortness of breath, and dizziness. They have sent me all over the place to check what is going on with me. Including a high risk doctor, neurologist, and cardiologist. The outcome is that your body is pumping more blood so you have to slow down so that your body can do it's job. They finally told me that what I needed to do was go slowly up the stairs. Take my time when walking or chores. And also sitting down whenever you can keep your legs elevated. That will definitely help the swelling as well as shortness of breath. If your sitting and can't catch a breath (cause that's what happens to me, I feel like my lungs can't open as far as they used  to.) take short breaths and then a long breath, like a yawn and you will feel a little better. And don't forget ALL pregnancies are didn't so you can't really compare this one to one's in the past which most people do anyway. I hope this helped you.|`|CFFuFof1aa	That is very normal and you will be short of breath until you give birth. The baby is getting larger and there for is compacting all of your organs together. So that means that your lungs don't have so much room to expand. Unfortunately that will get worse the further you get a long and the bigger your baby gets. Your ankles and legs being swollen is called edemia(sp??) I had that with my daughter. The doctor suggested that I drink more water, he told me to always have a water bottle in my hand, and he put me on bedrest for two weeks. Just prop your feet up as much as you can. Some women get it and some don't. <br>  Good luck!!!|`|Rhr1umV1aa	I think that you may need to go to the doctor. If your ankles and legs are swelling this early then you may have preeclampsia. Call your doctor and tell them. preeclampsia is a condition where if it goes untreated then it can turn to eclampsia and cause strokes or seizures. usual signs of it are swelling in the legs, feet, hands and face. not all sometimes though. Plus you could have blurry vision and headaches as well as high blood pressure. If it is not that then it is just a normal pregnancy thing. If you are a worker then its likely to be a little swollen.|`|fpyRo8Noaa	i was the same way....i couldnt really breathe normally until after my baby dropped around 33 weeks or so
kaqPSgTVaa	I know it's certainly not easy to watch. Just keep reminding yourself that it's for the health of your baby. You're being an execellent mother making sure that your wee one is getting proper medical care and attention. You can't rationalize with a baby so they freak out. He still loves you. :)|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	your not, its hard to see your baby cry or be uncomfortable. I hate the shots, I hate the holding of them in an institutional hold when they need to do something. I was crying so hard when my daughter got fish bone stuck in her tonsil (LONG STORY) and they had to go down her throat with a forceps to pull it out. They made me and my husband hold her down while she gagged and choked and kicked. I was just bawling and shaking so bad afterwards. I couldnt go back to the party we were attending.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	I honestly don't feel like I'm betraying him, because it is always (usually?) for the health of the baby.  I feel bad that he doesn't know what's going on and feels uncomfortable, but I don't feel that I'm betraying him.|`|tDb3osk7aa	oh yeah i feel the same esp. when he has to have shots i cry with him i do feel bad everytime we have to carry him he used to cry when we undressed him cause he knew what was coming now he crys when they have to hold him down to look in his ears he hates that even when his ears are clear he dont want u to mess with them lol i also hate it when they ask me to help hold him down i just want to take him back in my arms and say ok do what u have to while i hold him but i know he has to lay down and let them check him out its just so painful to watch and hear him cry only once in a while he will be in a good mood and not cry esp,. when his fav. doctor comes in its my cousin she is a woman and he loves to flirt with women lol he will smile and laugh at her its also a good thing that the nurses are the  ones to give the shots so that he dont fear the doctor themselves jsut the nurses lol they are smart for doing that.i am dreading next month he will have his one year check up and guess what more shots :( i am so sad y do they hve to stick him again.the only thing i can do to hlep him is to make sure he has had his tylenol before we go to help witht he pain.good luck and no there is nothing u can do but pick them back up and give them a big kiss and hug once its all over at least that helps my son once they do his shots he screams and cries but when she is done and i can pick him up its like magic he stops crying and that makes me feel real good that i can have that effect on him.|`|9FbcLKsfaa	I was like that at first with my first baby but now that we have baby number three we know that its for his own good and he wont remember it 5 min from now and none of my kids have ever looked at me and said "hey remember when i was 8 months old and you held me down to get an exam....i hate you for that" so its not that serious and you'll get used to it soon!|`|fsDof9pgaa	Yes, is is horrible.  But, for their own good.  They NEED medical attention, and the doctors are doing it to heal them.  But anyway, you feel horrible.  You can just stand besides him and hold his hand, or if they let you, hold him while they do it.  That makes a big difference.  Most doctors let you do it.  It makes work easier for them too.|`|1S7uXsInaa	I can say that I do not get that emotional about it, my daughter, 5 yrs, does cry every timee that he gets a shot.  I know that he is there for a reason and my Dr. allows me to hold him while he is examined so maybe that has something to do with it?|`|SdVrwd6daa	i feel the same way when i have to take my daughter to her monthly checkups. she got her first shot a month ago and it broke my heart when i heard her scream. but they don't remember it so don't let it get to you to much.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	I had to let a doctor put a catheter in my son when he was a month old, I cried for an hour. It's our job to protect them and unfortunately some times to protect them we have to let doctors and nurses do their jobs, it sucks but it has to be done.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	I have seen tons of mothers do that.  My children did not have fits like many children because I didn't send them unconscious messages that a doctor's appointment was something to fear.  I took them because it was best for them, not to be mean.
q4rG5Dwtaa	All babies develop differently, my last baby started crawling at 5 1/2 months he's 8 months old now and is all over the house. But he doesn't know how to hold his own bottle yet. Your baby sounds fine.|`|SDjrojZXaa	I would contact your pediatrician and see if there are any developmental programs in your are. In WV we have a system called birth to three and they will come into your home and assess the development and if they think that he should be further in something they can work with him and show you how to work on things. Your right every child is different so its best to have a professional just take a look and hopefully there will be nothing to worry about. Good luck|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	My daughter never held her own bottle!! LOL she could she just refused!! And as for crawling is usually between 8-10mos! and some babies dont even crawl! <br>  He seems fine to me! Moving to trying to reach an object is the first sign of pre-crawling! <br>  As for grunting LOL maybe he's complaining or it's his way of comunication! <br>  He's only 7 mos old!! If he's holding things and can he sit up with assistance?? Like if you place him in the stroller in the sitting position  can he keep it up? You can try helping him sit up, in his stroller, or in a Bumbo sit, or propped up with pillows.. a few minutes at a time.<br>  And Yes EVERY baby does things their own way.<br>  <br>  Look, my son was eating the same food we were having by 10mos!! And he walked at 12 mos! <br>  Now my daughter is a very fussy eater, so she ate table food close to being 1.  She did this weird scooting thing at around 8 or 9mos... and then she walked at 16 mos!!! <br>  She's now 2 and she runs!! LOL she's very smart, has no developmental delays whatsoever, she's actually ahead on several milestones... so you see it is true that every baby does things in their own time and that doesnt mean there is something wrong with them... Relax!! And enjoy him!! The baby stage goes away soo quickly!!|`|1S7uXsInaa	My son did things much later than my daughter.  Crawling started about 7 months, did not hold his own bottle until 9 months and he is a grunter.  Nothing abnormal.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	He sounds fine to me.  7 months is still really young and if people tell you their baby crawls at 7 months, that's just crazy!|`|WxQFe0GYaa	You shouldn't be worried about him.  He's only 7 months old, that is really young in the scheme of things.|`|qFmOuXMXaa	All babies are different as I'm finding out as well. My first daughter sat up , rolled both ways, crawled and could stand holding on the couch by her self at 7 months,<br>    My second daughter is 6 months old and can't roll ( she can roll from tummy to back but never does) she is just starting to sit, she is not even close to a crawl, (she can't hold her body weight on her hands.)<br>  It's hard not to compare other kids to your own but they really do ,do things at their own time we can only try to help.<br>     Good luck and don't worry it will come.|`|xbvve9vZaa	My son is 6 months old and just learned to roll over. He can kind of sit up on his own but will eventually fall to the side. He can't crawl yet either! He does grunt a lot too!! Hahah! Especially when he is trying to do something and he can't do it.<br>  Lots so infants do things at VERY different times. The lady across the street from me, her daughter was crawling by 6 months, but my cousin's baby just started crawling and he is 10 months. <br>  <br>  Don't stress about it, your baby will start to do all that stuff when he is ready. All babies do things at different times|`|qieTdigdaa	I think he sounds healthy.  It isn't that far off, so I wouldn't worry.  And he may be a very verbal little guy, so the grunting is okay too.  It sounds like he is pretty right on.  He may not hold his own bottle because you do it for him so he doesn't have to!  Some babies don't crawl at all - they skip it and move a different way.  Give him time and enjoy him...he sounds like a fun little guy : )|`|DskwNSPPaa	i think that's what ever age between a month or two either side is normal! the grunting is probably frustration where he wants to do things now he is getting active! my daughter was early with a lot of things she was crawling at 6 months and walking around the furniture by 9 months so it varies on the individual! hope this helps! if you are concerned talk to someone Professional xxx oh my nephew is 7 months and his not crawling yet either! where his brother was at around 6/7 months!|`|GZzUyJ0laa	my son is ten months old and just learned to crawl a few weeks ago, and even with that hes more scooting than anything. he definitely does the grunting alot, with the foot press thing, almost like hes attempting a crab walk.if your guys like mine hes pretty happy when he does it, i think hes jusgt wishing he could get himself somewhere! dont let fear based information lead you to think there is a set guideline for developmental stages. some children dont talk until theyre toddlers(or older). my guy did the pinwheel for a long time! just enjoy watching him figure it out,which he eventually will:)|`|eth48m7Iaa	all babies develop at different rates, your baby is normal. the grunting sounds like he is trying to crawl and cannot yet.
pjgMW6qaaa	Stressing about it will not help at all.<br>  When you miscarry you have terrible cramps and heavy bleeding.<br>  Cramps are normal during early pregnancy..I had them the whole 1st trimester.<br>  <br>  I had a miscarriage back in 2007<br>  And I knew it was going to happen because my doctor had told me. The night before I miscarried I had brown discharge and no cramping...a few hours later I stared cramping and bled lightly and that time it was bright red. Then I put a pad on and in the morning I got up and blood was gushing out (sorry tmi) and started to feel contraction like pains.<br>  <br>  Im sure you're ok because you are not describing any of what I just said.<br>  <br>  Relax with your feet up high and don't stress about miscarriage hun.<br>  Everything will be ok.<br>  God bless|`|0XCSQsf3aa	Unless you see bright red blood, relax. Everything else you describe is normal pregnancy symptoms.|`|35kVNi5oaa	Probably not, because your not bleeding. just relax|`|4XfjUcvDaa	as long as you have had no bright red blood, try not to worry|`|NWTfFEuVaa	If you're that concerned you should go to the hospital. But I don't think you are. When I miscarried, I didn't feel cramping or anything like that. I was just cleaning the fridge and blood came down like a waterfall and I quickly felt light headed. About 20 minutes after the heavy bleeding the baby came out and I still kept bleeding for like 3 days after that. It's pretty bad, but I don't think you are, but so in this pregnancy I haven't had any brown discharge so I don't know if that's normal. Just go to the hospital right away and ask them.|`|8LBl7HgAaa	Just relax, dont worry about it so much that you are stressing yourself! As long as you are not having heavy red bleeding you are okay. I have had 2 miscarriages and they started with brown spotting and it immediatley turned to red blood then cramping. Cramping can be normal since your uterus us stretching but if it is accompanied by red blood then go to the doctor to get checked out.|`|wy9rgMGsaa	Sounds like you should be fine, I used to work at an OB-GYN and brown spotting is nothing they are concerned with, its old blood, bright red bleeding is the concern for them...as far as the cramping, that is kinda normal early on and can be a number or different things....Anyway, if it is concerning to you, you can always get in asap with your doc and be scanned or have them listen for the heart beat for re-assurance! I think everything sounds fine though, just relax and enjoy your pregnancy!|`|1UrMbDZHaa	i know exactly how you feel about the fear of losing your baby! its like i can't breath until after my 3rd month (when its less likely of a miscarriage). you need to stop stressing about it though. your stress will harm your baby. so don't fret! <br>  some symptoms may include a white chunky (like human tissue) discharge. and bleeding. <br>  i've also exp vaginal cramping. its very common.|`|jvTgqdaiaa	The brown discharge could just be your baby leaning on your colon... ( i know TMI) and a little "junk" comes out without any smell or "normal junk consistency". my morning sickness went away about 12 weeks. and it was off and on. if you are really worried, you should visit the doctors.|`|txv7TIgiaa	i had heavy bleeding at 7weeks and everything turned out fine for me, my daughter is 15 months...also they say it feels like really bad period cramps, and there would be alot of blood... good luck go to the doctor if your scared to ease your mind...|`|6829e08dc8d9fb67736051c806603060aa	I WOULD NOT WORRY TO MUCH AS LONG AS THERE IS NO BLOOD YOU ARE OK WHY NOT GIVE THE MIDWIFE A CALL AND HOPEFULLY SHE CAN PUT YOUR MIND AT REST HOPE YOU GET ON OK GOOD LUCK|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	oh, honey dont stress yourself out! slight bleeding in early preg. is very common! Just try to relax and calm down and keep an eye on it. Cramps are also VERY common since your body is adjusting to pregnancy. If you start having heavy bleeding and clotting, go to the er as this is a sign of miscarriage. In the mean time, you can drink ginger ale and ginger tea for that morning sickness. Your dr is right, it comes and goes. Just relax and stay calm. brown discharge can be left overs from your last period or old blood from when the baby implanted in your uterus. Relax because stress wont help you out, Im sure that youre fine.|`|RR7UX4jkaa	Bleeding/clots/bright red are signs. Brown d/c is often normal.

Most commonly its caused by a foremilk/hindmilk imbalance -remember the amount of lactose in your milk is not determined by your diet but the amount of lactose the baby gets is determined by how often and how well they nurse.  It could also be an allergy to a protein in your milk from your diet, though this is rare.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mother-2-mother.com/cc-baby-A.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mother-2-mother.com/cc-baby-A...</a><br>  GREEN STOOLS<br>  <br>  The occasional green stool is not unusual in the breastfed baby. Consistently green stools, however, are not normal for the breastfed baby. Most doctors don't seem to recognize this as a potential problem because they often define "normal stool" as that of the formula-fed infant. Baby's stool can be a wide variety of colors and textures , and not all of these are cause for concern. It is helpful to know what is normal for the bf baby as well.<br>  <br>  Consistently green stools in the breastfed baby can indicate:<br>  <br>      * an imbalance of foremilk/hindmilk, often resulting in frothy green stools.<br>      * a sensitivity to something in the mother's diet, such as cow's milk products.<br>      * a sign that baby has an illness. Babies with an intestinal virus or even a simple cold will sometimes have green, mucusy stools. Teething can also bring about green stools due to increased saliva (can also cause tummy upset)<br>      * a lot of green vegetables or something with green food coloring in mom's diet.<br>      * If baby has started solids, that could also account for the change in color (this is normal with the change in diet).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cryingoverspiltmilk.co.nz/Food/LactoseIntolerancevsMilkProteinAllergy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cryingoverspiltmilk.co.nz/Foo...</a><br>  In infants and young children: -<br>  <br>  Congenital Alactasia is an extremely rare condition whereby babies are born without any lactase (the enzyme needed to break down milk sugars), making human milk unsuitable for the baby, precluding breastfeeding. These babies must be fed a special lactose-free formula to survive (soya formula, or dairy based but lactose free).<br>  <br>  Functional Lactase Deficiency describes a thriving breastfed baby who has multiple loose watery stools. The baby may be irritable and may pass flatus frequently. Low fat feeds result in rapid gastric emptying leading to large quantities of lactose being presented for digestion. Thus the ability of lactase to digest the lactose may be overwhelmed. The amount of fat being consumed at any feed should therefore be maximised to delay gastric emptying. This can best be achieved by optimising hind milk intake by:<br>  <br>  ? Encouraging the infant to finish the first breast before offering the second breast.<br>  <br>  ? Spacing feeds. Aim for three hours between feeds. If the baby demands again in less than this time offer the "empty" breast again.<br>  <br>  As lactose is the main form of carbohydrate in all mammalian milks (including human milk), lactose production at the breast occurs independently of dietary changes. Reducing the amount of lactose in the diet of a breastfeeding mother does not alter lactose production at the breast. It is present at a constant level throughout a feed and throughout a day.<br>  <br>  Primary acquired lactase deficiency is an age-related condition and occurs after weaning and before the age of six years. Young children with this form of lactase deficiency should not eat any foods containing lactose; weaned infants require a lactose free formula (soya formula, or dairy based but lactose free).<br>  <br>  Secondary acquired lactose intolerance occurs as a result of damage to the small intestinal mucosa that commonly in infants is due to gastro-enteritis. This is treated by the introduction of a lactose free formula to the infant's diet.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/bfinfo/lactose.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/bfinfo/l...</a><br>  Lactose Intolerance and the breastfed baby<br>  Joy Anderson BSc, Dip.Ed., Grad.Dip.Med.Tech., IBCLC, ABA Breastfeeding Counsellor<br>  <br>   <br>  Lactose is the sugar in all mammalian milks. It is produced in the breast and is independent of the mother's consumption of lactose. It is present in a constant concentration in breastmilk. Foremilk, the milk the baby gets when he first starts to feed, does not contain more lactose than hindmilk, but it does contain less fat. Lactase is the enzyme that is required to digest lactose. Lactose intolerance arises when a person does not produce this enzyme (or does not produce enough) and is therefore unable to digest lactose.<br>  <br>   <br>  The symptoms of lactose intolerance are liquid, frothy stools, and an irritable baby who may pass wind often. If a baby is lactose intolerant, the medical tests, 'hydrogen breath test' and tests for 'reducing sugars' in the stools would be expected to be positive. However these are positive in most normal babies under three months too so their use in diagnosing lactose intolerance is open to question.<br>  <br>   <br>  There are some common fallacies about lactose intolerance that you may hear in the community:<br>  <br>     1. Lactose in the breastmilk will be reduced if the mother stops eating dairy products.<br>     2. Lactose intolerance in other family members (adults) means baby is more likely to be lactose intolerant.<br>     3. If a mother is lactose intolerant then her baby will be as well.<br>     4. A baby with symptoms of lactose intolerance should immediately be taken off the breast and fed on soy-based infant formula, or other special lactose-free formula.<br>     5. Lactose intolerance is the same as intolerance or allergy to cows' milk protein. <br>  <br>   <br>  Read on to see what is wrong with these ideas! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/milk/change-milkfat.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/milk/c...</a><br>  What affects the amount of fat and calories in a mother's milk?<br>  <br>      * Mom's diet? The research tells us that mom's diet does not affect the average amount of fat or calories in her milk. However, mom can change the types of fat in her milk by altering the types of fats that she eats (Lawrence 1999, p. 106-113, 300-305; Hamosh 1996, Hamosh 1991, p. 123-124). An increase of one fatty acid could generally be expected to occur concurrently with a decrease in another. For example, one study has shown that black mothers in South Africa who eat a traditional maize diet have less monunsaturated fatty acid in their milk than urban mothers who consumed more animal proteins and fats (van der Westhuyzen 1988).<br>  <br>      * The degree of emptiness of the breast is what research has shown to drive breastmilk fat content, and thus calorie content. The fuller the breast, the lower the fat content of the milk; The emptier the breast, the higher the fat content of the milk (Daly 1993). For more information see I'm confused about foremilk and hindmilk - how does this work? and How does milk production work?<br>  <br>        *  FULL<br>        Breast   =   LOWER<br>        Fat<br>        Content  &  SLOWER<br>        Milk<br>        Production<br>        *  EMPTY<br>        Breast   =   HIGHER<br>        Fat<br>        Content  &  FASTER<br>        Milk<br>        Production<br>  <br>      * Breast compression has been shown to increase fat content of milk (Stutte 1988). See Breast compression for more information.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The above information tells us that milk fat may be more effectively increased through 'mechanical' means (i.e. longer & more frequent feeding, massage, breast compression, expressing foremilk before nursing) than by changing mom's diet.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/gassybaby.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/gas...</a><br>  Does a mom need to watch everything she eats to avoid having a gassy baby?<br>  <br>  The idea that certain foods in any mom's diet will cause gas in her baby is incredibly persistent but is not founded in research. If certain foods in moms' diets were an overall problem for most babies, we would expect that cultures that emphasize those foods would have more gassy and fussy babies, but this does not occur at all.<br>  <br>  This is not to say that certain foods would not bother a particular baby - this does happen occasionally (and it's more likely with very young babies). However, there is no list of foods that every mom should avoid while breastfeeding. In fact, most babies are fine with any food that mom eats, so there is no reason to avoid a food unless you notice an obvious reaction in your baby every time you eat a particular food.<br>  <br>  Most babies are gassy from time to time, some more than others. Gassiness is often worse at night. This is due, on the most part, to baby's immature digestive system and has nothing to do with what mom does or eats. Because so many people promote the idea that food in mom's diet causes gas, many a breastfeeding mom will immediately assume it is due to something she has eaten if her baby is gassy.<br>  <br>  The list of foods that "might cause gas" is practically endless, and moms who try to avoid all these foods will (needlessly) have a *very* limited diet. Formula-feeding moms blame it on a chill, a draft, the formula type, the formula being too hot or cold, baby being overdressed, underdressed, jostled too much, etc. Formula-feeding moms never think it was what the cow ate the day she was milked, months ago! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/fussybaby.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/fus...</a><br>  What is normal baby fussiness?<br>  <br>  Whether breastfed or formula fed, during their first few months, many babies have a regular fussy period, which usually occurs in the late afternoon or evening. Some babies' fussy periods come so regularly that parents can set their clocks by it! The standard infant fussiness usually starts at about 2 to 3 weeks, peaks at 6 weeks and is gone by 3 to 4 months. It lasts on "average" 2 to 4 hours per day. Of course, there is a wide variety of normal.<br>  <br>  To distinguish between "normal" and a problem, normal usually occurs around the same time of day, with approximately the same intensity (with some variation); responds to some of the same things each time, such as motion, holding, frequent breastfeeding, etc.; and occurs in a baby who has other times of 
eC1dQVcgaa	My one year old got really bad nappy rash and i was also bleeding, it's not nice is it?<br>  <br>  I actually found that bepanthen was best it stopped it in 3 days.. <br>  <br>  xx|`|RzaP9bQmaa	Keep using the cream that the doctors have given you.  Use warm water on the rash instead of baby wipes. <br>  <br>  Let the air get to it, let her run around in the front room for ten minutes with nothing on her bottom and allow her skin breath.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Ouch.<br>  <br>  I suggest you let her bottom air during the day and apply sudocreme or Bepanthem cream. My friends little girl had this and she used to get spots there. Sometimes I think its over heating from clothes. Every time she goes to the toilet/potty wipe her with a flannel bathed in warm water then dry her off. Keep her nappy free for as long as you can. If she is in nappies and your out and she wees change her as soon as you can so shes not sat in the wee.<br>  <br>  Failing that ask for a second opinion.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Try putting some baking soda in her bath tonight. For a half full regular tub I throw in a handful at least, a little more if it's really bad. Make sure she's good and dry after, let her run free if she'll go with it. Put a little cream on her bum after wards. I found that too much cream doesn't help any. Should be a noticeable difference tomorrow. Keep doing this until your sure it's gone.<br>  Be sparing with the wipes and soap, they can aggravate it. My great grandmother used this on her kids, and passed it down. It works wonders for me.
a1uoxczTaa	DO NOT NAME UR CHILD THAT. Whitney BLEW Anderson. need i say more???|`|KAj7GfeDaa	I don't think it's weird at all. I like it. My mom always liked the name Elijah Blue and it reminded me of that. BTW, I wasn't confused about the last name thing. It was obvious to me.|`|wOhWnD2laa	Lol, whitney BLEW andrson sounds funny, I agree witht he first girl.<br>  <br>  But I think if your really set on it, I would go for Blu.|`|TlEv8iNbaa	yeps i agree with the above...i do like the name Blue though...but yer having it as a middle name could sound like a sexual inuendo there!|`|MVZ6Mpa1aa	hmm personally I like Whitney Cara Anderson  (no comebacks).|`|6bryNB1raa	seriously dont call her that it sounds dodgy and shes got to live with the laughs for the rest of her life|`|iXwA5wAlaa	No, my uncle had a dog called Blue.|`|q8pV5Ry2aa	i think its alright|`|wRHhpanmaa	awwwww... my grandaddy's last name is granger... one of my baby girls is gonna be named after him (DeeGee) lol. <br>  <br>  I think it is a beautiful name... and if people can name their kids ella bleu (john travolta) then i dont see why you cant name your daughter that.<br>  <br>  I think it is a beautiful name.|`|sW6GWlXXaa	Umm, I think your childs middle name should be your mums first name...|`|ffPGgAmLaa	don't do it, it will cause her no end of embaressment when she gets older|`|kFlMHSKIaa	Wait while she's older and ask her if she's like to choose a middle name.Whitney Blue sounds like an airline company.|`|AA12188347	I knew a boy in school whos middle name was BLUE  But spelled without the E.  His name was Justin Blu  (cant remember his last name thogh)  Anyway I like it and if you like it you should do what you like.........|`|0e33e812d76b8f8fe9810d0893f6e0b7aa	Why would you want to go through the hassle of adding a middle name to your daughter's name. No one really uses their middle name anyway, so why bother? If you didn't initially give her a middle name on her birth certificate then just leave it.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Horrible. She already has a masculine first name and now you want to give her the middle name Blue? Poor poor kid.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I like it.Personally I rather have a middle name then none at all.|`|DdSnno9daa	no
AA11544533	It is very normal.  As long as there is no odor or pain, you should be fine!  You will notice that as your pregnancy progresses, you will get more of it.  If it bothers you, you can use a pantie liner to help shield it from your panties.  I hope this helped!<br>  <br>  Dee|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Since it doesn't smell, it very normal, it will increase as you get further in your pregnancy. If it ever does smell, that could be a yeast infection and is not serious, but something you definitely need to have treated right away. And yes, I think everyone has this one. I don't think many people don't get it.|`|e3fa2fb97cbca43e2c3086607351d4caaa	I'm 31 weeks and i had it and still do. I had it with my last pregnancy too! It's normal|`|Rhr1umV1aa	Every pregnant woman has that. Its the bodys way of I guess you could say lubing up. You will have that the remainder of your pregnancy. Sometimes you may even need to wear a panty liner.|`|5h8bYsKdaa	very normal and u tend to get more as pregnancy progresses.|`|gQK9xNU6aa	it is compleatly normal. had it all the way through my pregnancy, with a couple UTI's.
5X6C4s7zaa	so sorry for what you have been through, I lost my baby in Oct. 08 at 15 weeks and I am now 9 weeks.  I have seen and heard the heartbeat and the doctor said he doesn't expect any problems with this pregnancy so I am just trying to stay positive and not stress myself out.  I know for me sometimes it feels like I am waiting for the other shoe to drop since my loss was in the second trimester but all we can do is pray and hope for the best.  Best of luck to you!|`|sAbah6dTaa	I'm sort of like you, I have one daughter, she is 3... it took us a long time to get pregnant, finally we did, I had a miscarriage around 5-6 weeks, we never seen a heartbeat. Now I am pregnant again, 9 weeks like you, so I'm hoping since we have made it this far that it will be okay. I actually go tomorrow to confirm. =)<br>  <br>  My advice, just keep your head up. Don't stress too much because it's not good for the baby. take your vitamins... and just pray!!<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|txv7TIgiaa	personally i haven't but one of my friends had 3 miscarriages, on was a tubal pregnancy and she lost a fallopian tube and then finally she got pregnant and everything went smoothly her son is now two...so i think most likely everything will be fine i know after 13 weeks you are at less of a chance to miscarry...good luck and congrats...|`|jcHxLOAXaa	i am so sorry for you past loses. but hopefully it sounds like you are doing really well at this stage, the only advise i can offer is try and not to worry and enjoy your pregnancy. i hope all goes well and good luck
1UrMbDZHaa	yep sadly mother nature will fool you. i had a late period but it actually lasted a whole week. apparently i was pregnant during then =]. that was a surprise. it can be implantation bleeding. i've known people who have normal periods well into their pregnancy.|`|AA11112387	its possible. i mean if your period is normally a week and it comes and last only 3 days and you arent on birthcontrol at all you may be pregnant.|`|K5Wr8Mcaaa	I had an irregular period. I would have my period every other month and i though that, that meant it would be harder for me to get pregnant. But a year after i started to have irregular periods i was 2 months pregnant.<br>  So i say anything is possible.
MkKvGdxKaa	The pill stopped your period, this is normal. the pill will work from the first day you take it under the assumption that as you are on your period, you are unlikely to ovulate untill week 2/3. Dont believe it. and a word of warning, see my souce below, I got pregnant 2 times on microgynon 30 so they raised me to 60, then I fell pregnant on 60 so they raised me to 90. this had nothing to do with causing the miscarriages, i had ob/gyn complications. why are you on this type of pill? Do some research on it, in fact just put it into the search for questions bar and see what comes up!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|0SIhrYCbaa	The pill isn't effective at all as B/C until you have been on a month for most.<br>  I'd say you have a very high probability of getting pregnant. Do you normally have a light, 2 day period? <br>  If you don't want to be pregnant you may still have time to take the PlanB pack and stop conception. If you are already pregnant it won't effect any thing.|`|C8Djjxqkaa	20%|`|MHg9JhEKaa	So you had unprotected sex on Wednesday, and then went and got a prescription for the pill two days later.<br>  <br>  Your period could have been just spotting, or after-sex bleeding - you don't mention how long your normal cycle is, so it's difficult to tell what this bleeding was.<br>  <br>  When you take the pill for the first time, you take it on the first day of your period, and you are protected straight away from that time onwards, so long as you take the rest of the pill correctly and on time. However since it's difficult to know if that bleed WAS your period (was your period due around that time?) it's impossible to say if you were protected or not. <br>  <br>  I'd keep taking the pills as normal now you've started them, BUT use extra protection too, and test around the time your next period is due.|`|5RvTXdmUaa	Not high if you stop having unprotected sex now. You had your period March 5th? You should be ovulating March 19th if you have 28 day cycles. Use condoms until you've been on Birth control pills for one whole cycle. Unless your doctor says otherwise. But as for now, you are probably not pregnant.|`|YhjFiVGyaa	no..the pill takes 24 hours to work dear. trust me.<br>  <br>  plus if u did sex the day b4 ur period, most likely, the egg has died already. theres only a small window of time u can be fertile,. although yes, some women can get pregnant but its not that common.<br>  <br>  just stya on that pill cuz if u miss a dose or go off it, u end up more fertile than before.|`|pjgMW6qaaa	Very likely to get pregnant...<br>  When you start the pill you have to use protection for a week or two because that's how long it takes for the pill to start working.<br>  Good luck<br>  And next time read the instructions.|`|haabfMtkaa	pretty good I would say you have a 50/50 chance I don't think you gave your self enough time on the pill for it to be effective it ia a good sign that you had a period why don't you get all your dates straight and check and see if you were ovulating the time of the unprotected sex if you were this will increase your chances to like 75/80 %  it is a good idea to know if you were or not even though you had a period you CAN still be pregnant<br>  Also you can take the PLAN B this of course if you don't want to be pregnant you are still in the time line for the plan b to work I don't know what state your in but in California you can get it at any pharmacy with out a prescription so this is a another option<br>  GOOD LUCK <br>  you can check your ovulation time at the following link<br>  www.ladytimer.com|`|epi4RopFaa	Anytime you have sex you could be p/g. You need to be sure you aren't before you take any more pills. You need to be taking your pills regularly and at the same time daily before you continue to dtd if you don't want to get p/g.|`|HoonZJMgaa	It may depend on many things but I would say your chances are about 50/50. If you want this child, I would find out before taking anymore pills. But if you don't want to be pregnant then do not have sex while you are waiting to test.Good Luck and God bless!|`|5Jn3Wkbeaa	...The pill takes anywhere from 1 week to 1 month to work...Did you not read the instructions?|`|1IVEYMA9aa	About 98 percent. Dude your eggo is prego.
Y5IUse1vaa	I'm not a mummy but have it on good advice that if you give her a bottle with some boiled water, possibly with a wee spot of baby jiuce in it, she will get out of the habit of needing milk and will give up expecting it at any time in the night or day. Even better, you should try to ignore her in the night. You will obviously have given her a decent feed before she goes to sleep and will know that she does not need anything else until the morning. If you continue to "pander" to her, she will make your life very difficult and expect you to "serve" her in an instant. You need to persevere with this new routine, if you give in, she will expect to be fed at a moment's notice, any time of the day or night!!! Another handy hint is to put a couple of spoonfuls of baby rice into her last feed of the evening, this should give her enough nourishment until the morning..Good luck, young babies can really try your patience!!!!!|`|69DjSUVAaa	Have you tried giving her a dummy?<br>  My son started off as a very sucky baby and was constantly feeding, i feed him to sleep and feed him at certain times of the day, but i found the dummy helped and he lasts a little longer between feeds. now he is 7 months and he only really needs it when he is ill or tired.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	she will start to stretch it out on her own as she gets older and able to go longer periods at night without waking up hungry.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Perhaps you could delay her daily feeds by 10 Min's during the day. If shes hungry at 4pm wait until 4:10pm. 10 Min's of crying isn't too bad. At her next feed make her wait for 15 Min's. I know you may think this is cruel but it isn't. You know that she will be fed. If she settles at 8pm and has had her feed try and give her an extra ounce so that she will sleep longer. Wake her just before you got to bed and give her another bottle.She should sleep longer having two feeds in a shorter length of time. Does she have a dodi? (pacifier) If not consider giving her a dummy to suck on. If this don't work then you will have to grin and bear it.|`|2F5HNPqPaa	At that age, we found out (by mistake) that if we gave our son his 2am feed before he went to bed at 9pm, he wouldn't wake up for it! Obviously this is harder with breastfeeding... <br>  <br>  The two things I'd suggest (doing one or both) are try and squeeze in a couple extra feeds during the day if possible - or maybe try a soother (just for bedtime!)... if it's more comfort sucking this should help... it did with my son (breastfed up to 3 months).|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	3 hours is a god sent! my 4 month old is up every two hours, like clock work.You can't change it, just go with it, they grow up too fast to want to get rid of night time feedings.|`|kbdkOPHDaa	give her a binky and if she goes back to bed then leave her be unless she is really wanting to feed there is nothing you can do!<br>  <br>  once she starts getting older then it will get better|`|zx9ABSquaa	I would feed personally on demand. It could be she is also just thirsty. (I made this mistake). You could try a nipple shield for a while to give yourself a break, also they can give the impression their hungrey when they have wind, if there is curling up of the legs when crying she has wind. The hospital taught me a trick, wrap her up in a blanket and let her suckle your finger, if she goes to sleep, then that was the problem. Also, have you moved on to solids yet? She should have done at three months, that could also be the problem. Cook up some veg or fruit and puree it and try her with that. I used to cook it up once a week and freeze it in ice cube trays and re heat. You also need to add in some protein, try the fish coley, less expensive than cod, puree again. She can also move on to banana and yoghurt by now.|`|d8fSVX23aa	wait till you introduce solids, this will leave her feeling fuller for longer and you will slowly be able to increase the gap with little or no problems at all. Stretch the gap by only half an hour at first and then by an hour if things go well until slowly the gap bigger.|`|XuDqmgGTaa	Feed from a bottle.  You can see how much she is taking and she will tend to sleep longer.  You have no way of measuring how much she is taking if it's from the breast.|`|269vf73waa	Dont worry, my baby also wake up every 2-3hour.<br>  Is only during 6mth and above, it change to 3-4hour.<br>  Try to use to it.......|`|RIbS6yzYaa	3 hours at 3-4 months is normal,  my 3rd baby who is now 3yr old would wake every 2 hours day and night untill he weaned at 15 months.  <br>  <br>  my 4th child now 18 months woke every 3 hours at night and every 2 hours during the day until she was 15 month old when i had to start insituting some boundries when i got pregnant again,(now 17 weeks and fully intend to tamden nurse)  she now feeds 4 times a day, at bed time and maybe once over night if she is ill or upset.  <br>  <br>  its totaly normal and feeding at night is great for your supply as the hormones that make milk are higher at night and night milk is higher in nutriants. <br>  <br>  at her age she is not yet ready for solid foods so dont try that yet, and it doesnt always make babies sleep longer, neither does formula.  i bottle fed my 1st and 2nd from a few weeks old to get the to sleep longer,  it didnt work at all i was still being woken at yon time in the morning but insteasd of just popping baby to the breast i would have to get up, warm bottle, feed and resettle,  what is now a 1 min job too an hour, i learned my lesson then and have never given a bottle of formula since.  <br>  <br>  if your nipples are sore try Lansinoh nipple cream, its a god send, also get her latch checked by a lactation consultant (google la Leche League or Association of Breastfeeding Mothers, the ABM has a yahoo chat group that may be helpfull to you).  <br>  <br>  i too know how it feels to have a booby addic baby,  my 3rd was one, and my 4th still is.  it can be draining but at the end of the day, thats what breasts were designed to do, its normal way to feed, it provides the most optimal, individualy tailored nutrition that changes as your baby needs, it helps pretect her from an icreased risk of diabeties, obesity, heart problems and digestitve problems in later life, it helps lower your risk of female cancers and osteoperosis in later life. <br>  <br>  good luck and keep up the good work
2pxiK9waaa	There are plastic thumb guards you can purchase so she can't do it anymore. You can also get gross tasting stuff to paint on her nails. You're right--it is bad for her teeth.|`|YhjFiVGyaa	my ex hubby used to take her thumb and stick it in his mouth to get her to stop cuz she would fight him and get grossed out (the egyptian way) and it worked. she wont suck her thumb around u anymore and the habit will just fade off.|`|JJIofNL2aa	i would put nasty tasting stuff on finger nails but i warn you she may never completely stop. my partners brother is 32 years old and will still sit sucking his thumb from time to time! i think its a comfort thing

Good luck!|`|6829e08dc8d9fb67736051c806603060aa	I COULD SAY THAT IT SOUNDED LIKE BRAXTON HICKS BUT I HAVE HAD 3 PREGNANCIES NOW AND MY 3 LABOURS HAVE NEVER BEEN THE SAME WITH MY 2 ND LABOUR IT WAS ALL BACK PAIN THAT I GOT TILL NEARER THE END SO COULD BE THE SAME FOR YOU HOPE THIS HELPS GOOD LUCK WITH THE KNEW BABY WHEN HE OR SHE ARRIVES|`|35kVNi5oaa	May just be braxton hicks, call a dr if it keeps going.|`|J3IRUUQhaa	Sounds like Braxton Hicks
iOSEVRPPaa	Although they say you can't spoil a baby, you also can't hold a baby 24/7.  You have to do other things, too.  Getting a sling or carrier will help, however at 3 months, your baby should slowly be able to spend some time alone, not in your arms.  Babies also need to learn to be able to entertain themselves - that is not cruel, that is reality.  Do you want a 1 year old needing your attention every second?  How will you ever get anything done?<br>  <br>  Start by putting him in his crib for short periods with a toy.  Or in a bouncy seat.  Somewhere safe and where he can play with soemthing.  Even if he cries, let him.  Don't let him get to screaming or having  a fit, but a little whining won't hurt him.  Give him his favorite toy, etc.  <br>  <br>  Babies have to lear to play on their own, and even at 3 months, he should be able to spend 5 or 10 minute alone at the least!  You are not being a bad mom by expecting your baby to play on his own for short periods.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	At 3 months you really can't spoil a baby. The world is still new to them and they find comfort in you holding them. Maybe find some toys that he likes to keep him entertained. Thats what we do with my son.He loves his toys and can play with them for hours.|`|8WbfmK5daa	I don't believe you can spoil a baby.<br>  <br>  If he wants to be held or a cuddle give him one and cherish it cause soon enough he isn't going to want too anymore.<br>  <br>  They are only that little once make the most of it :)|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	whats wrong with holding your baby all the time? just hold them, you held them inside you for 40 weeks, thats all they know! they grow up too fast, and you can't spoil a baby.|`|2dd7ad59a27b4a34fc13f5e7bbd8ba34aa	Babies are supposed to be held a lot. Its how they feel secure. You are NOT spoiling a baby that young by holding him when he wants to be held. If you are not able to get anything done, try a sling. You can have your hands free and baby still feels safe and comforted. And remember that it is much more important for your baby to feel secure and loved than for you to get everything on your to-do list done.<br>  Enjoy him - he won't be a baby for long!|`|91d66f827b42a4381e0eeb57b05439f5aa	get a sling or baby carrier. Your baby is not spoiled, and you are not doing anything wrong by meeting his needs. Don't listen to any one who says otherwise, especially if they advise you to let him "cry it out". That baby was held and cradled in your body for 9 months, you can't expect him to suddenly stop. As he gets older he will get more independent, and before you know it he will running everywhere and you will be the one fighting him to get a hug!|`|3g13ARkbaa	you can't spoil a baby this young.  he is little and needs to be held!  i held my son all the time when he was born, i hardly ever put him down unless it was necessary.  Enjoy him being little and hold him as much as possible because they will eventually grow up and won't want to be held anymore.|`|269vf73waa	You may start to try to held your baby by reduce the timing.<br>  Ex: you use to held your baby 20 min last time, try to reduce to 18min, then next time to 15min........<br>  This will slowly make your baby use to it.<br>  try it.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	You can't spoil a baby!!!! If he wants to be held then hold him, if you need your hands free then get a snuggly, sling or wrap carrier. It is normal and healthy for a baby to want to be held close all the time.|`|2pxiK9waaa	Either get a sling, or put him down for five or ten minutes at a time. He'll eventually outgrow this.
ZcrAfbikaa	I do like it! That's awesome... Original and spunky. <br>  <br>  You could go with a more classic name for the middle, as well.. <br>  Like Lennon James, Lennon Jacob, Lennon ____ (like a family name).<br>  <br>  Congrats on your baby boy! You're so lucky!|`|lfNlz1iEaa	I personally wouldn't choose it but if you like it I think it is ok.  I definately think it is better than some of the made up names people use.|`|Bu01WfOdaa	I think that name is abit too easy for other kids to make fun of, when your boy is at school like my name for instance Alana banana see what I mean?|`|GbEZrKNDaa	Its unusual,<br>  But I personally dont like it (:|`|yNV2kRlbaa	Not really, it's a last name and it reminds me of lemon|`|C8QTGBYxaa	No not really when i read it first i thought it was LEMON. sorry|`|CAc7zMkgaa	Yes I do.

haabfMtkaa	I think you can own 1 home and 1 car under a certain amount of net worth I would be completely honest with the state though because if they find out and you are not in there required guidelines they will come after you and make you pay the money back they can even put you in jail for fraud I am pretty sure that you can own 1 home and 1 car not positive|`|IqqaA2wIaa	probably not.....when my mom was dying in 76,,,my Dad couldnt get welfare without giving up his house so he kept it and struggled....till she died in 12-77|`|htSZsds7aa	Why not use the money u are putting down on the house and pay for pre natal care.|`|kgcTdberaa	im doing the same thing. the answer is YES YES YES. one of the questions on the application is are you currently paying a mortgage? its just like paying rent, except one day it'll be yours. They base it on your income, and then they ask for bills, a lease/mortgage...and they decide based on that. so as long as most of your money is going towards shelter, food, and needs...and you aren't able to afford prenatal care you should get approved|`|NWTfFEuVaa	You will not be kicked off medicaid just because you are buying a house. Health care is a right to all pregnant people and children no matter what income they have.
1VnWhP1Saa	It's perfectly normal, all mine had slightly bow legs when they were little, I spoke to the H/V & she told me they will straighten as they get older & sure enough they did.|`|nZVTHKNwaa	I used to work in daycares for several years and I remember seeing lots of little ones that age with their little ankles/calve area slightly bowed. I'm sure it's nothing serious, especially if it doesn't affect her mobility at all. But I'm like you, I would much rather get a professional's opinion just for peace of mind. (But isn't it cute?!).|`|nJCM6pDUaa	Yes very normal don't worry.  I am not expert but I worried about that with mine and they soon straightened out.  They are not strong enough to bear weight for any length of time, babies develop at different times but I would always recommend taking a baby to a health visitor for anything that may concern you that is what they are there for. Take Care|`|NZTZbmL5aa	Perfectly normal. Absolutely, perfectly normal in every way. They are all like that.|`|Ah3kxDnGaa	As far as i know it is normal and they do outgrow it but asking the H/V will give you some peace of mind.|`|269vf73waa	Try to wrap her when she sleeping.
gs2aPltGaa	she could be, but with a home pregnancy test she should have tested positive for at least one of them?<br>  <br>  Did you buy the pregnancy kit in a box that came in 2? maybe they might have not worked as properly as it should have. my biggest suggestion is to go out and buy another brand pregnancy kit. EHT is a pretty good brand and clearblue as well. <br>  <br>  Hopefully you get a positive result. if you cant wait a week you can also go to a womans clinic they have hospital grade pregnancy tests she can take and they accept walk ins as well.<br>  <br>  Worse case scenario is she might not be pregnant.<br>  Best case scenario, she could have gotten pregnant real late into february or early march and its too early to tell just yet. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!! :o)|`|vWKQJhwRaa	CONGRATULATIONS!!!<br>  ur gonna b a father :D|`|xpstigPTaa	she could be!

haabfMtkaa	my first baby i had missed 2 periods and took 3 test and still did not believe it I called the Doc. told him what I just told you and his response was "honey your pregnant you don't need me to tell you that" the at home test a very accurate if you have missed your period and got a positive test then "honey your pregnant"congrats and good luck time to start the prenatal pills may also want to pick up some folic acid this can help with early stage birth effects your Dr. wont tell you this so it is something you need to get on your own all prenatal are the same so go to the grocery store to pick them both up|`|kaqPSgTVaa	The only reason you could get a false positive is if you had a cyst on your ovary or were taking drug's that contain HCG. You are pregnant.|`|5RvTXdmUaa	Three positive tests? No, if you followed the directions, you are most likely pregnant. They very rarely give a false positive.|`|YuA7a08Maa	False positives are REALLY rare.  And you keep missing periods.  Call an ob-gyn and get in for an appointment.  Prenatal care is very important.  Congrats and good luck!|`|WrOvFyBgaa	well if the hpt test says positive then there isnt any reason you arent. especially since your 2 months late!|`|tIez5HWBaa	yes you are really pregnant|`|NWTfFEuVaa	I would have to say you are! You should go to the doctor's to make sure, and if you hold out any longer on getting health care when you know you are pregnant then you can get in trouble for child neglect. So just go to the doc's and see what's what.|`|jUneJXEIaa	You can't get a false positive.  If your test was positive then you are definetly pregnant.|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	I THINK YOU ARE PREGNANT =D<br>  you could be like 9-13 weeks pregnant.
tLGbtmGsaa	No not really.  My best friend did not have any symptoms except tiredness.  I had a few symptoms.  Mild morning sickness,  tiredness, headaches, food aversions (nuts and meat), heartburn,  frequent urination, sore breasts, implantation bleeding, mild cramps.  That was about it for me.  Its different for every woman.|`|QSodlfMraa	i just had a missed period and serious morning sickness.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Nope. Not in the least. Some women never get symptoms.|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	Nope, it all depends on your body and how it accepts the hormone surge of pregnancy.  I'm 33 weeks with baby #1 and i havent' been sick a day yet.  The only symptoms I have had is being tired and my boobs hurt to begin with.  Other than that, I honestly kept forgetting I was pregnant.|`|YuA7a08Maa	Definitely not!  I had almost no symptoms right after I got pregnant.  I was a little nauseous, but not much...and I never got full-blown morning sickness.  I also had sore boobs, but they were never super sore and the pain would come on and off.  Some women don't even know they're pregnant.  A positive test and seeing a baby are the only must-haves.  Good luck!|`|htSZsds7aa	Absolutly..if you only get 1/2 the symptoms u are only 1/2 pregnant...go to the library and get some books about pregnancy and learn a little|`|5Jn3Wkbeaa	Nooooooooooo.... I never got sick, I never got implantation bleeding, I never got cravings...
49f06b796d54e170c36a6cf4fc463182aa	My daughter was allergic to dairy from the time she was born, until last year shortly after her nineth birthday.  She used to get hives all over her body that looked like masquito bites but were much bigger, rashes, asthma flare ups, cold like symptoms, etc.  When she was one day old she had blood in her stool from her first bottle which contained milk.  We made several trips to the ER in her first few years when she snuck bad foods like chocolate pudding, that almost sent her into anaphalactic shock.  From then on we carried an epipen along with the Benadryl that we carried all along.  It was difficult shopping and cooking for her in the beginning, but we learned how to deal with it.  Even as a baby the first and second foods were alright, but once we got to third foods milk was sometimes hiding in them.  It got worse when she began eating table foods.  I learned that I had to check every label every time I went shopping because companies sometimes which up their ingredients and things that were milk free have been known to change.  The newer labels make it easier by saying "Contains milk ingredients".  Some of the other names that milk can hide under are:<br>  <br>  ammonium caseinate <br>  calcium caseinate <br>  magnesium caseinate <br>  potassium caseinate <br>  sodium caseinate <br>  casein/caseinate <br>  rennet cassein <br>  curds <br>  lactate <br>  lactose <br>  delactosed/demineralized whey <br>  lactoferrin <br>  lactoglobulin <br>  milk derivative/protein/fat <br>  modified milk ingredients <br>  hydrolyzed casein <br>  hydrolyzed milk protein <br>  lactalbumin <br>  lactalbumin phosphate <br>  whey <br>  whey protein concentrate <br>  <br>  Milk is often hiding in things we would not even think of like most breads.  As for breads Freihoffer's was one brand we found that does not have any milk in it, atleast not when we checked last.  When we cooked we would substitute soy milk or apple juice for the milk in all the recipes.  Depending on if the apple flavoring would fit well is how I decided which.  We learned that all soy milks are different.  There are two kinds... one that is on the shelf and the other in the fridge next to the real milk.  The ones in the fridge seem to taste the best.  One thing about soy milk is that each brand seems completely different in consistancy and taste.  She liked the Silk Very Vanilla Kids Soy Milk the best and it is the healthiest for kids because it is fortified specially for growing kids.  There were also wonderful alternatives to other things she missed too, like Tofutti makes soy ice cream, ice cream sandwiches, fudgsicles all dairy free.  I have found these at most regular supermarkets like Hannaford's and Stop and Shop.  At health food stores like Trader Joe's and Whole Foods you can also find a few brands of soy cheese that is also dairy free.  Watch the soy cheese though and read the ingredients carefully because even some soy cheese still has casein in it which is alright for those who are lactose intollerant, but not for allergies.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	By dairy, do you mean cow's milk?  Or, are you including eggs, too?  Do you mean lactose-intolerant or allergic?  <br>  <br>  My son is allergic to cow's milk and any ingredients derived from cow's milk.  He is not lactose-intolerant.  He has had breathing difficulties (resulting in emergency room breathing treatments) after ingesting foods made with milk-derived ingredients.  <br>  <br>  If your child is allergic to milk, you need to make this clear to everyone who you leave her with, even for a minute.  And, you need to make sure that your daughter knows that she can die, stop breathing, if she eats any food without checking first with mom or dad.  It sounds extreme, but it is, actually, that important.  I've seen my son nearly stop breathing.  I *want* him to be afraid to eat anything that I don't approve (just as much as a parent to any other child would want their child to be afraid of eating poison).<br>  <br>  I have an ingredient list on my blog, here - of what you should avoid: <a href="http://naivemelody.blogsome.com/2006/02/17/207/" rel="nofollow">http://naivemelody.blogsome.com/2006/02/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Most restaurants these days, especially fast food places & chain restaurants, have an allergen list available.  Ask the server for it when eating out.  If they don't have one and the server/manager can't show us ingredient lists & preparation methods for the food that he would like to order, we usually order fries and a side of fresh fruit for our son, feeding him a more complete meal when we get home.  Or, we'll bring something with for him from home.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	The Food Allergy Anaphylaxis Network has a lot of helpful information and recipes on it. Also, when my baby had a dairy allergy and I had to cut out all dairy from my diet, I switched to eating kosher/parve stuff, which is all dairy free. You can try that, too. It makes things a lot easier because everything is marked on the packaging with a U symbol. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.foodallergy.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodallergy.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.oukosher.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oukosher.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.oukosher.org/index.php/consumer/whats_new" rel="nofollow">http://www.oukosher.org/index.php/consum...</a><br>  <br>  There's also a list of kosher products to look for when you go shopping, which is nice, too.|`|xcd4Wazfaa	My niece is allergic to most of the things out there. Dairy is her number one. My sister has to give her everything soy based. Nowadays, you can find everything soy: butter, milk, yogurts, etc. Just check in your local supermarket what they have available. My pediatrician told me that Soy is healthier than dairy because of less use of hormones. Good luck!
zHRWklEWaa	I think the problem is more in the two year old then your daughter. A child who bites and hits should be removed from other children until he calms down. You can't really change you duaghters personality, but you can encourage her to go somewhere else when having problems with these children.|`|CTE2eRgZaa	tae kwon do.  My brother is in it for the same reason.  Since its a safe environment, she won't feel so scared, and everyone is doing it.  My brother's class makes a point of teaching them what to do if someone grabs them (like scream to leave them alone, and pull a defensive maneuver so that they can get away with as little effort as possible.<br>  <br>  As for her cousin, don't leave her alone with him.  Clearly she doesn't like it, and her baby cousin hasn't learned to play nice yet.  Give her the option to stay away, its what you'd like her to do with someone who isn't family, isn't it?

Thats like abuse.|`|VTGm3UNBaa	I wouldent let that happen. That boy at 14 is in the "I want to put my penis in everything!" stage while your girls in the "I'm an innocent flower wee yay ponies!" stage. It's not a good mix. Wait until she's old enough to understand that he's thinking about his penis while she's thinking about ponies. Like when she's 14 and he's younger than 16. That's a better situation. Just remember the rate of girls getting pregnant and giving blow jobs and smoking and doing weed has gone up a lot since your teens! Keep an eye on her and teach her right from wrong.<br>  <br>  Just don't do it. When your daughter comes home pregnant/raped/confused/depressed and whatever else you'll certaintnly regret it. He's in high school and she's in 5th grade! Thats a HUGE maturity difference. Even if he is a sweet kind young man, no 14 year old boy should even be attracted to an 11 year old. That's just weird on so many levels. Even if he is an awesome kid thats too much of an age difference and wouldent last anyway.<br>  <br>  If you do for some reason allow this to happen then make sure their supervised.

Don't let that happen to yours|`|peQGGFPYaa	14 seems a little to old for an 11 year old, i mean he has to be in either 8th grade or highschool, and the 11 year old is in fifth grade. hmm 14 year old boys are into kissing and all that kind of stuff and i don't think an 11 year old is ready for that. on the same hand you don't want your daughter to be angry. i would say meet him and only allowed supervised dates until she is 13.|`|Q2n6nMWUaa	No way in hell would my children be allowed to date at 11.  16 at the earliest.|`|HbraP1cpaa	11 year old lust lol I find it cute- but if I were the mother I would def like to meet him. 14 yr old boys only have 1 thing on their mind - make sure he isnt a shady character- your daughter can hate you now if you decide not to allow it-and she'll thank you later.|`|TvBGK1QLaa	Well if my daughter was the 11 year old and he's 14, that is simply out of the question.

Think about all the things the 14 yr old knows about already and imagine them talking about/"teaching" the 11 yr old how to do it, or what it is... This should make your decision easier. I wouldn't want MY kid spending time with someone so much older at least until they're BOTH older.|`|QEscOehNaa	well its best if you meet the boy before she does anything try not to embarrass her while your doing it and dont say that she cant see him because you dont want her to go behind your back and wind up doing everything you dont want her to its best if you can see what she is doing and you can watch over the relationship that they have but dont be too watchful|`|NJlNa1EQaa	Since you said, " i have to meet him" I'm guessing "I" would have a daughter.

tLGbtmGsaa	My daughter has a heart condition too.  But not what your baby has. She is 15 months old now and has no problems.  Anyway I hope your baby will be ok.   I think you may have better luck asking this question in the heart section.  I asked a question in this section once about my daughters heart condition and only got one response.  Take care:)|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I've never heard of prenatal blocked atrial bigeminy but personally was diagnosed with atrial bigeminy in my pregnancy...basically a heart murmur.  Apparently I've always had it (I've felt it but just assumed I was getting too riled up when I'd feel it).  If your doctors aren't concerned now I wouldn't be either and even if it does not go away at birth its still really no cause for concern.  What you feel when you have it..."if" you feel anything at all are hard heartbeats.  Its not constant and there really is no rhyme or reason when it will occur.  I felt it more once I was pregnant which is why I ended up actually looking into it.  It doesn't require medication or altering your day to day activities.  It's more annoying then anything else...doesn't hurt.  Its kind of what you feel if someone comes up to you and yells "BOO!".  Then it passes.  If anything its more annoying for someone taking your pulse then yourself (because they keep starting their count over...I giggle to myself when I see them scrunch up their face)  I wouldn't worry.  It is very possible that it will pass at birth or shortly thereafter...just remember even if it doesn't its not life threatening in the least.  I tell myself I just have a "superhero" heart :-P which requires hard beating at times.|`|AA12338884	its will be fine once she out

AA11210211	Technically it is both their jobs at least a judge would make them do it 50/50.If I was him I would pick her up but then tell the mom if she wants her to come pick her up otherwise I would keep her.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Not it's not her job to drop her off. Legally if he wants to see his daughter he has to pick her up. This is how many families work when the parents don't get along that well. With that said should she be more cooperative, probably but it's not her responsibility.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Well from personal experience, my ex usually picks my daughter up from school on a friday and then drops her home to me on a Sunday. But if she isn't in school, he comes to pick her up from my house.|`|7aCH91ISaa	Your b/f needs to grow up. This isn't about him or his ex. It is about their daughter. My ex husband would move mountains if that is what it took for him to see his children. Thankfully we both realize that this isn't about us and we put our kids best interest first. <br>  <br>  I know getting the courts involved is never fun. But in this case it sound necessary. If he is paying child support, do they have a case with Friend of the Court or does he pay her directly? Many times you can go to mediation to work out the differences and this is free of charge. Contact your local FOC and see if this is an option.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	I have 3 tips for you and your boyfriend. <br>  <br>  1. if they are going to do visitation outside of court they need to come up with the agreement get it notarized and then signed by a judge. this way she would be able to go back on it later. <br>  Or he should just take her to court. <br>  <br>  2. If the pick up/drop off is less then 25 miles then it is the noncustodial  parents job to provide transportation. (at least in California) I know this because I went to court with my ex and this is what they told us. If the child lives more then 25 miles away she must provide 1/2 of the transportation. (this is what I have to do too, it's really no big deal and I live 150 miles from my ex and I take pleasure in knowing that I am providing a service for my child) <br>  <br>  3. This one you are not going to like, but please read and consider. Nothing is going to get better until you and him change any bad habits, or judgments regarding this woman. You really didn't have to add the part about her living situation or her employment status because it really does not matter. What she is doing is wrong and she would do the same thing if she was a Millionaire with a college degree. Obviously she has control issues but her personal situation is non of your business and if you make judgments about it then it will cause more problems, as long as the little girl is happy, safe, and secure then it should be non of your concern. <br>  <br>  Please ask your boyfriend to go to court it would save him  a lot of headaches.|`|pNalkD4caa	The best interests of the child should be at the forefront of this whole issue.  With no court order, the mother doesn't HAVE to do anything.  Why did your husband go for 3 years without seeing his daughter?? He should have taken the mother to court, to allow visitation.  OR, was the problem that he didn't want to bother with an infant, because they are harder??|`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	Tell you what, until you are the ex and are stuck driving your child to and from your ex (which is exactly how it would be, "Oh, I can't drop him off to you, my car broke down" "If you want him, come get him") mind your business. I love it when people come on here crying, "My guy's ex wouldn't let him see his kid for 3 yrs." BS, if he really wanted to be a part of his kids life he would have. He could have filed for visitation and pressed contempt charges on his ex for not following up, all free of charge. As for her living arrangements, again, none of your business. I have been the ex who TRIED to prevent my abusive ex from taking our son, who was 11 at the time, from going w/his father. My son did not want to go due to the abuse he suffered at his sperm donor's house all because the sperm donor could not control me anymore. He took it out on our son and there was nothing, NOTHING I could do to protect my baby because it was emotional and mental abuse. It finally stopped because my ex's gf's family, whom he resided with, got tired of his bs.<br>  I have and still am the current dealing w/the ex. I am disgusted w/the way she treats her son, or lack of treatment is more like it, and it infuriates me that she doesn't even bother to financially contribute towards his care but there is nothing I can do and honestly, it's none of my business even though I feel as if he is more my child than his. You need to step back and let the bio parents deal with it. <br>  The only thing you can do is be supportive to both your bf and his child, that's it.|`|Jf3DIPcNaa	I always try to be reasonable with my ex husband. We set our own child support which is quite a bit lower than what the courts would have made him pay, but I felt the amount was fair for both of us. <br>  When time comes for visitation, I share driving with him. I don't really mind. But I am more of the mind that all the fighting and childish behavior is just rediculous and bad for a child.<br>   <br>  My dad always picked me and my brother up and took us back when his visitation was over. He didn't mind, he just felt it was the right thing to do I guess. <br>  <br>  It really depends on your situation. Unless it's really far, why would you even bother to fight about it? Just go get the kid so he can see his child. The only person being hurt by him being stubborn with his ex is the child and him because their visitation doesn't happen. It's dumb. <br>  <br>  Stop trying to work it out away from the courts if she is unreasonable. My DH has a kid with his incredibly annoying psycho lazy ex and she tried to use the kid to get her way too. She wouldn't let him see his kid because we wouldn't let her come over and look around our house and it was rediculous. They went to court and he got it worked out that they meet halfway between our house and her apt and trade the kid in a neutral place. It's court ordered now so she can't just not show up or she's violating the agreement. That's why going to court is best. Nobody can use the child against the other if they have to follow the court orders.|`|dab391535c3cca2e58914658b7393ff0aa	It really isn't her job.  But what it sounds like to me is that they are both being selfish and not thinking of their daughter.  They both need to put their feelings between eachother aside and focus on making their daughter happy. <br>  <br>  If the wife continues to be a ***** and not drive the daughter over, your bf should be the better person and go get her.  <br>  <br>  When he does have his daughter maybe he should give her 2 or 3 hours of 1:1 time since he doesn't get her regularly.<br>  <br>  It also is handy to have your own stuff for the daughter at your house.<br>  <br>  If I were in his shoes i would take the ex to court.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Of course both parties should contribute...but if there is one that is not wanting to work together...what can you do?  I can't see how when you say your boyfriend is back to not seeing his daughter again what that means?  Is it because he doesn't want to "give in" and drive over himself to pick his child up?  Isn't that hurting HIM and his relationship with HIS daughter?  Isn't the child suffering because of that?  No matter what he has to suffer through with his ex, he should still do everything he has to in order to see his child.|`|s4aX6bF6aa	i feel for your boyfriend but this is the situation...it is his responsibility to make a relationship with his daughter...it's not the mom's...the mom cannot make a relationship between the dad and daughter...i know that sounds cruel but it's the way of things...i made my ex-husband be responsible for his relationship between him and his kids and when the kids didn't see him it was his fault for not taking the time...divorce can be ugly but the visitation can get uglier...my suggestion is to get a lawyer and set up all the visitation schedules and who is responsible for what and then the mom and dad won't have to argue about it all the time.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	It is each parent's job to make sure that they are as involved as possible in their child's life, taking responsibility for every aspect of their child's well-being, physical and emotional development, no matter what they have to do, who they have to interact with, in order to do so.<br>  <br>  What mom is supposed to do, whether it's 'fair' or not, this is the woman who he has to deal with, emotional baggage and all, in order to act as a responsible parent to his child.
7k8iwvvOaa	Relief, Remorse,<br>  <br>  I would expect that your emotions will run the gamet and you will feel both sides of the coin.  <br>  <br>  I am pro abortion but do not think it should be taken lightly.  Get counseling before and after.  Go into this with eyes wide open.  There will very well be a time you regret the decision but that does not mean it was the wrong decision.  It is yours to make and live with.<br>  <br>  Be sure you have someone you love and trust with you.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You should expect to get a lot of angry responses to this question.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	At 6 weeks they will probably just give you a pill to take.  The pill will cause a miscarriage.  You will have bleeding and some cramps but you will go through this at home.|`|s1utniuvaa	You are going to get attacked in here. Some people here are touchy to this subject. You may want to delete this and re-post it in Women's Health. To just give you a general answer since I don't know what procedure they will give you... there will be cramping and bleeding, wear loose fitting clothing like sweat pants, you may have some nausea so wait a bit to eat and get the prescriptions that they give you filled asap. Take care.|`|giRRCXU4aa	You can expect lifelong regret...and that's it, which you should.<br>  <br>  Give the poor thing up for adoption. Tons of people won't see that baby as a mistake.|`|DNygQdmVaa	Very smart for asking this here.<br>  <br>  Selfish person, you could put that baby up for adoption,|`|ITCknAHVaa	take someone supportive with you.  They usually lie you down, they usually give you a anesthetic, and they insert a little hook or curette and scrape you out.  Sometimes they can give you a pill, but not always.  Get them to explain the procedure for you.  Expect some pain and cramping, afterwards, ask for pain relief if necessary.<br>  <br>  You can also expect bleeding afterwards, so take pads along.  The most important part is expect hormones to go crazy.  You might feel sad, upset, depressed etc.  As I said take someone very supportive with you, and make sure you take about it afterwards with someone.<br>  <br>  Its not an easy descision and no one has the right to condemn you or tell you what to do.  Good luck|`|ncUhlwevaa	depends on the type of abortion you are getting. If you are getting the suction one it will be pretty painful unless you are knocked out. If you are knocked out, it will not hurt at all but you will wake up with cramps and bleeding. <br>  If you are getting a medical abortion, which is a pill you take that basically induces a miscarriage, it will be painful for about an hour, with heavy cramps and bleeding but you should be provided with Vicodin to help subdue the pain.|`|25aCEsHtaa	its going to hurt so im not going to lie its like very bad cramping... I had one like 5 years ago and make sure that this is somethin you can handle mentally and physically. believe it or not it can take a toll on you i would recommend talking to someone about it to make sure that your certain. just because you got pregnant doesnt mean that your life is going to be hard. My cousin had her first child at 16 and did a great job she did more than what some people expected. so make sure its the best decision for you and i hope everything goes well.|`|bK5f2p38aa	If you were really "facing the consequences'', you would be having that baby and giving him in adoption, not having and abortion...

Ueix2Q7Taa	I ate corndogs and fastfood throughout my whole pregnancy and my baby is two months old and healthy. Just keep it in moderation. Don't ONLY eat unhealthy food.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Fried foods aren't good for you in excess, but if you eat them on occasion it won't hurt you or the baby. It may give you a little extra weight gain, but then that's true when you're not pregnant as well.|`|85V6cHe4aa	No it wont hurt the baby,a balanced healthy diet is certainly best for the baby but eating some fried food wont cause the baby harm even though its not a healthy choice.|`|uuHPneEcaa	u really shouldn't eat a lot of fried food.. i mean u can eat it every now and then but not all the time.|`|QSodlfMraa	i too eat fried food, like french fries and fried chicken, and i when to the doctor and the baby is ok, but i did read some where that we should cut down and the fried food.|`|rHufcHwHaa	yeah you can eat french fries.  just make sure you take your prenatal vitamins and eat a healthy diet...obviously don't eat ONLY fried foods, but i'm sure you know that and that's not what you mean :)  Your body will filter out the nutrients for your baby, and the rest will go to you.
Z9uXyb17aa	im 34 weeks and my baby is also breech, they said if he has not turned(which he prob. wont because he is so big he is measuring around 36-37 wks now!) they are going to schedule my c-section at 38 wks, so good luck!|`|85V6cHe4aa	Usually 38 weeks,sometimes 39 depends on what the doctor thinks is best.<br>  <br>  38 weeks is considered the optimum time for a scheduled c section here in the uk.|`|xZWP2mqjaa	If this is your 1st baby, then they might try and schedule you in for c-section from 38+weeks. However, there is no reason why you can't deliver a breech baby vaginally. It is slightly more difficult but it is possible. I know some hospitals would rather you had a section if its your first, only because the vaginal passage is untried and untested and they don't know if your hips will stretch wide enough. Don't be surprised if your doc suggests you try a natural birth, with the possibilty of intervention if necessary. <br>  If you've had a baby vaginally before, then there's no reason for a section as they know you will stretch wide enough to accomodate a baby coming down.|`|5qFaWz2daa	Hello, I am at 37+3 and at my 36 week appointment my doctor told me she thinks my baby is also breech. I have an ultrasound scheduled     for tomorrow to verify.

I would block his email address and phone number so he could not contact you as well. After your baby is born, I would take him to court for child support and of course get soul custody of the baby. But beware, if he pays child support he can fight to get visitation rights. It sounds like him and his girlfriend have alot of growing up to do and that they are pretty pathetic.|`|d3jtRA8caa	Good for you, I'd call that guy a asshole.

7HZAzS01aa	Sounds like ovulation spotting. It would be way too early for implantation spotting. But you did have sex at the best time, so wait until your period is late and take a test. Good luck!
MkKvGdxKaa	There is a bag of waters in front of the amniotic sac commonly called forewaters. we can have leakages of fluid from here that dosent affect the baby. I was 3cm dilated from 30 weeks with my last two children and it was all grand. It's very very common with your secong pregnancy onwards. Im sure the doc know what they are doing. If your waters are broken you should be on the ward and resieving antibiotics. give them a ring and air your concerns and get them to clear up any worries you have. It's your body, you have the right to the info. good-luck and congratulations!!!|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	The doctor's know what they're doing... Are you on bedrest? Usually something like this would result in you being on bedrest until the end of the pregnancy. They of course want to keep the baby in there as long as possible but in this situation, they're likely facing a premature birth. If you aren't having contractions then they're just going to want to monitor you & keep an eye on how dialated your cervix is but they're not keeping you there because you're not in labor at this point, you're just dialated. You could go on like that for weeks! Just relax & get alot of rest! If they think you need to be admitted, they will do it.|`|61uwsGVuaa	i have had 3 kids and my last child i was 28 weeks and 4 cms and i leaked some of my fluid too i was scared to death too and i thought they were stupid because they kept sending me home but i went untill i was 37 weeks untill i had them induce me because i was worried i would go into labor at anytime but i never did i wouldnt worry to much about it untill u start hurting really bad or loose your plug or something i hope that helps feel free to email me if u have any questions|`|zgw9sW84aa	I would say they need to do something to stop u from dilating or going into labor. if I were you i would go somewhere else. 3cm is a lot for only 28 weeks.
O3EtP4vOaa	They don't do like an income verification or anything and they will just go off of her income if you are not married.  They will not really ask for your living arrangements.  Whatever she tells them is what they go off of, I remember back in college I think I paid like $10 or $14 for my pac each month.  That was like 10 yrs ago so it may have changed some, they can also just write her a prescription and she can get it filled at a pharmacy, there it is usually about $20-35 depending on what kind they give her.|`|0XaBIomCaa	Because you are not married, it will be just her income.  For all they know you are just a roommate.  She should check out the "For Now" program PPH has|`|CgEQAgXhaa	It would be based on her income.  Since you are not married they wont take your income into account.|`|AA11112387	call 1800 planned parenthood<br>  <br>  or look on there website<br>  planned parenthood.com|`|9mwEu0Afaa	its called abstinence marriage is for married couples only . and birth control is murder jack|`|AOr92DhTaa	I'm not sure about Planned Parenthood.  I imagine they will use only her income, since you are not married.  They probably use tax records from last year to confirm income.  I don't think they will even have any way to know that she is living with you unless she tells them.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing your girlfriend only works part-time, based on that income.  Is she going to college?  Some colleges offer medical services at reduced cost for students.  I think I paid about $35 for a doctor visit, and $5 per month for birth control pills at my college.<br>  <br>  I can tell you that for awhile I paid full cost for birth control pills, and where I live that came to about $30 per month.  The doctor's visit was about $150, I think.  It would probably be a little cheaper seeing a doctor at one of those minute clinics (that are in a CVS), or Take Care Clinic (in Walgreens).  It looks like a woman's health eval is $59 at Walgreens.<br>  <br>  Wal-mart has one brand of birth control pills, Sprintec, for $9/month (in most states).

I put it off for weeks, but it was so hard because I'm really close to my mom.  I was afraid she was going to be mad at me, and so I chickened out and told her over the phone.  I was pleasantly surprised when her response was, "OH, I love babies!" Sometimes parents will surprise you--they have been supportive since day one. <br>  <br>  <br>  PS:  I was 21 when I told them, too.  Congrats on your little one and hope everything goes well!|`|uuHPneEcaa	just say mom dad.. your going to be grandparents. they can either be happy for u or upset. but u just have to come out with it.

I had to tell my parents I was pregnant when I was 23 and single, so I can relate.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	Call them and tell them that you need to talk to them and tell them you have great news! Then say you are going to be grandparents! and just be really excited and tell them I know this is not the ideal way for it to happen but we are so thrilled and we have everything worked out.  If you dont give them the chance to freak out because you are so happy the happy might just rub off on them.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|RtIGiGrkaa	I was in your shoes a couple months ago and i feel your pain and i know its scary but the best thing in the world to do is be honest and just tell them. Try and have a game plan also so they can see how mature you are and you will be surprised at how happy and supportive they will be. The worst thing to do is wait till your farther along and than tell them. They will be so angry if you do that. Just have confidence and honestly all that matter is at this point is your BABY! Congrats and good luck hun!|`|XVljoYZ5aa	My parents are the same way, but they aren't devout catholics. I was afraid to tell my mom, but she was happy. Her very first response was, "You can't be pregnant, you're not marrrrried". She was half truthful, half joking. She'll pretty much follow your lead. If you start with, "I have some great news! You're going to be a grandmother and me and (insert bf's name here) couldn't be happier!" She will be too. If they are indeed upset, it will soon change to happiness. I just got a care package from my mom with tons of adorable baby stuff. Good luck, and remember, everyone loves a baby!|`|9UCvu7RYaa	I mean just be honest with yourself, they are going to be a little disappointed, but as a parent myself; we get over it. I know I disappointed my parents when I told them about my first pregnancy and I was not even close to being 21.  Your an adult and just take your time, let them know that you have a beautiful surprise that you want to talk to them about and your coming to visit.  That way they pretty much are already prepared for your announcement.  <br>  <br>  When you get there just let them know that you can handle them being disappointed, but not for TOO long because your are going to need their love and advice  and so will their grand baby.<br>  <br>  Congrats!! you'll do fine, they can't deny you.|`|e725ffd3660b4a2956ef06586b79e169aa	Being a mother of a 20 year old son with a beautiful baby girl, I would suggest telling them over the phone if you can't visit. Don't text or IM. I had our son before we were married, though we had been together for two years. My father is a minister, so that was a little tense. But he is now (and it didn't take long) dad's pride and joy. Things might be "touchy" at first, but put yourself in your parents shoes. The last thing we want is for our children to have children at a young age. But we get over that and realize that a wonderful gift is coming our way. Congratualtions and best of luck to you and your family!!
WnZoZqX2aa	your water breaks you dilate then you see head and out comes baby you cant push till you dilated to ten|`|AA11220327	this varies for every hospital and every pregnancy, but in general terms, for a vaginal birth with no complications, when you arrive at the hospital, a nurse will take your vitals and check to see how dialated you are if at all. You then get asked enough questions to write a novel about yours, your partners, and both families medical background. You are then put into a delivery room, and sometimes put on a fetal monitor. If you are having an epidural, you will be waiting for the anestisiologist to arrive to give you the epidural. You then wait, getting checked regularly for dialtion untill you are 10 cms dialated, ,and then you start pushing. This may take a few minutes, or a few hours. After the baby is delivered, weighed, measured, and checked by a doctor, and you are given stitches if needed, you will both be transfferred to a recovery room on the maternity floor, untill the dr decided that you are both ready for release.
2a726b94b1136e6caf4d74c8981c9e24aa	I'd talk to her about it before going through with this plan, but it sounds nice.  Perhaps you focus on new beginnings, i.e. a new marriage and a new life.  It can be done very tastefully  for example if she's having a girl you can have a tea party theme, and have some baby stuff mixed in with the bridal shower stuff.  If your going to have games just alternate or combine bridal and baby shower themes.  Almost any theme can have elements of both thing in them, and just about any favor will do (the best favors are things like candy and disposable things anyway).<br>  <br>  I think that the main thing people would object to would be about gifts.  They might wonder if they were expected to buy a baby gift and a wedding present.  Depending on how big the shower is you could either let people know that they weren't expected to bring 2 gifts by word of mouth, or put it tastefully on the invitations.|`|0ztnCrm7aa	honestly it seems trashy.|`|YPdoeAFOaa	I think that it's fine.<br>  My mom's friend did that and it was actually really fun.<br>  Everyone related the baby and bridal gifts to something old, something new, and something blue which worked out great because she was having a boy! It was also a lot easier for the bride/mommy to be to have it all on one day because her family could pretty much kill two birds with one stone.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Yikes.  Baby shower for a second child plus a bridal shower?  You're definitely going to raise eyebrows on this one, for various reasons.  Typically, a second baby does not get a baby shower.  The reason for the baby shower is to set the new parents up with stuff they wouldn't have needed before having a baby.  Once you've had one baby, you're pretty much set up for future babies.  <br>  <br>  I think you should throw her some sort of celebration/party, and avoid calling it a baby shower or a bridal shower.  It's not a typical situation, so I wouldn't try to give her a typical shower.

Call your doctor and ask them.|`|3GXjp03caa	ahhh she hit a nerve while you where sleeping i did this all the time and freaked out so finally went to the doctor and she did a ultrasound and she said it was all ok and that she just hit a nerve so you'll be ok and if your already 34 weeks and something did happen they would do a c section and the baby would have a 98% survival rate! well good luck and im sure she is fine don't worry you'll hurt the baby more by worrying than anything!|`|nGhqwEdpaa	The baby is WELL protected inside...however, all YOUR insides are kinda squished and certain movements can give you a sharp pain. If you a really concerned, you should be calling your Dr. instead of asking us moms. Its really something important that you don't wanna play with. Good luck hun|`|iaCGscNFaa	Yeah if shes moving I think your in the clear honey.|`|tPk0VrVEaa	I think He Still Alive..I Hope he iz
Nhje1U06aa	Wait !! Until you get married .I think you want to wait to .  This way you can enjoy your wedding and honeymoon- personally I am so vain I would rather be skinny in a dress than have a big belly  .  if you get pregnant in july or august after the wedding the baby will come in april or may . Its not that long to wait and you can make sure all your ducks are in a row- With today's economy you never know what can happen!<br>  Congrats and good luck!|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Financially stable - in this economy?  I'd hold off until you are financially strong.|`|UKPYoPKuaa	Why the rush?? I think you should both concentrate on being the best parents you can to her daughter who's here now & probably still adjusting to the changes, and you should concentrate on getting financially stable... to bring another child along. I'd wait atleast 2 years.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|3S3pK199aa	Dude, how do you know you are going to have a stable job soon? Do you have an idea how many people are losing their jobs? Where have you been? Haven't you heard the news that in February alone 651,000 jobs were lost? Where I work 35 people got laid off last Friday. Companies are cutting their work force and not hiring. This is not the best or even an ok financial time to have a child and you are also too young to have so many kids.|`|4sjW4Ig5aa	Sounds like a great plan... except... Getting a job while she is pregnant isn't easy... What guarantee do you have that the economy will bounce back during your timeline and that you'll have those great jobs, things change...<br>  <br>  You're only 21, she's only 25, you have lots of time. I wouldn't rush this. Take your time, be stable before you start adding more kids into the mix.|`|K0goWsgjaa	Well first of all congrats on everything! I would honestly say to wait until you have both the jobs and are IN the stable situation because you never know with this economy what will happen. I would say that waiting for a 3-4 months is not that long I mean it may even take that long when trying to actually concieve. It is up to you two, you three actually lol in the end so take the time and really think about it logically and rationally. You can always HAVE baby but once you get pregnant you can't make it stop.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|xACwWEXHaa	Don't rush things.  You need to see how actually being married works.  You are both young.  There is no reason not to wait a year or two before you bring home a new child.<br>  <br>  If by positive, you mean "agreement," then I'm not giving you the answer you want.  However, I commend you for thinking about it all in advance.  <br>  <br>  The new baby may require some time off for the new mom, so she may not be able to work and you may not be as financially stable as you foresee now.  In my opinion, it would be better to save up several months worth of expenses so that if she does have to quit or if the child has medical expenses, you'll have more choices than you would if you are living paycheck to paycheck.<br>  <br>  Kids are wonderful, and I absolutely understand her urge to have one now, but seriously, don't rush into this.  Don't give the new-born the job of making you both happy.|`|O8RuSBAjaa	It sounds like you guys are doing a lot of transitioning right now. You are still planning your wedding, you are adjusting to being a stepdad, you are both in school and you don't have those great paying jobs YET. I think it's great that you are talking about the future, and your desire to expand your family, but you are both still very young and have a lot of time. My advice is to wait til you're settled into your new life and your new jobs before adding another component to your lives.|`|efce1e1b217dc87e814781a424a53829aa	you really want your kid to be born in wedlock....think about it? do you like being a bastardd?<br>  <br>  you have so much time....don't rush it!!!<br>  <br>  we started having our family at age 30 after being married for 7 years and completing our master's degree.|`|PNMnF7Fcaa	You have to remember everything doesn't always go that smoothly...<br>  <br>  If the baby ends up coming premature you could have a baby before 2010, major medical bills and not be financial stable.<br>  <br>  You gotta be prepared for anything!|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Honestly, you don't need any feedback.  You sound like you have your act together and all that matters is that you love each other and your kids.  Go for it!|`|8Bl8XQh8aa	Go for it, I say! You sound completely & totally prepared! This is the perfect age to have children, and you two sound like the most responsible couple I've met yet!|`|SdVrwd6daa	the only question you need to answer is r U ready for children mentally. thats something only u can answer.|`|RgEtKVaKaa	Sorry - I cannot support your plan. Who is going to stay home to parent the children?  Do you plan to quit your job or will your fiance'/wife? Perhaps you plan to put your precious gifts in day orphanages.  Please don't fool yourselves into believing that minimum wage folks - usually young & without any parenting/childcare experience - are going to nurture & love your kids the way you would.  Not to mention that your kids would be with these hard working people 10 hours a day.  Who's values will they learn?  Yours or those of someone else?    Children are a sacrifice.  You must be willing to give up stuff, things, etc.,to provide the best for your kids.  Kids do not want stuff, they want your time & attention.  This is the biggest, most important   thing you will ever do in your entire life.  Do a little research - other than Yahoo! Answers.  Read about children in daycare.  Read about the mindset a parent has to have in order to leave their kids in the care of total strangers.  Read the book "The Irreducible Needs of Children"  Just the introduction will sadden you  - and hopefully change your mind about institutionalizing your children.   Please confront these difficult questions with your fiance'.   I wish the best to you & your children.|`|CAdT38mTaa	You sound totally ready to have a child. But no matter what happens (if god forbid she gets pregnant and your jobs don't turn out well) once you have a child you will find some way to get by. I was stupid and got pregnant at 18. I am poor as hell but I am still raising a son and going to college next fall to eventually get in the situation you are going to be in very shortly.|`|3yHASGyVaa	I will be 30 in June and I have a 2,3, and 4 year old and one due in may.  I think now would be a perfect time to have another. You are young still and you might think you know 'you' but a lot of things change from your age until about 26-27 for a guy trust me, just keep that in mind.  Good luck
hKJIDdVqaa	virtually everything yes.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	True|`|XD42367paa	Depends on how old the child is. I am in my 40s and I sure don't think dear old mum and dad need to know everythign about me now.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	Unless it's harming themselves or anyone else in any way then it no ones business but the child's.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	as much as humanly possible. yes|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Yes it would sort of make things a little easier|`|US33hgbJaa	Having a good relationship with your kids is incredibly important and that means getting to know them as people, as well as your kids. This doesn't mean you need to be a part of every moment of their lives - but you should know them well enough to be able to predict their behavior.|`|8Bl8XQh8aa	No, children deserve privacy and have the right to their own lives. As long as you have an open relationship and they know they can come to you for anything & everything, than don't be nosy and let them live their own lives!|`|pT7jrsAgaa	There are some things I probably don't want to know! :)  And to a certain extent, I shouldn't.  Even kids need their secrets from parents.  But as long as I can snoop and find out what they are without my kids knowing it, then we'll be fine! LOL|`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	Ideally that would be swell, in reality, no. Can one honestly state they know everything about oneself let alone even those closest to them?|`|oOGDbw1Saa	with having 7 kids each one is diffrent in there own way do your best for your family don't question your or your child will question you!|`|VdnAH78Xaa	no, not everything.<br>  but my parents some how ALWAYS found out what I was doing.|`|Nhje1U06aa	Yes - its there right . If you don't tell us something we always figure it out!|`|3dzuYTC5aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Haha Im a Bionca too!!!
BW7Nrqjzaa	In Season 4 of I Love Lucy in the episode "Ethel's Home Town", Ethel Mertz performs the song onstage.<br>  The gang arrives in Ethel's hometown of Albequerque, New Mexico, where the locals are under the impression that she, and not Ricky, has been hired to star in a Hollywood movie.<br>  <br>  I don't know if that helps!
Z8Ui1ugLaa	This is something you should consult your doctor about.  I had a miscarriage at 4 months and was told to wait 3 menstrual cycles, then I would have the thumbs up to start again.  Be safe let your body heal.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	I've heared of women getting pregnant a month after a miscarriage .. So id say whenever u are comfortable and ready to try again, go for it|`|oYSsVM0Aaa	These people telling you that you're too young are completely rude and crazy. Since when is 20 years old too young to be a mom? Hello people - not all of us want to wait until we're 30 years old before we start trying to have a family!<br>  Whatever your doctor tells you is fine, I had a miscarriage but it was at 4.5 weeks and I waited a month. You may need to wait several months before trying again, just to make sure your body has recovered. I'm sorry you lost this baby!|`|AA11220327	physically i would wait untill your dr gives you the "all clear" to try again, but emotionally, you really need to give yourself time to grieve and time to heal emotionally, and sometimes that can take a lot longer than being physically healed|`|kDftsHXjaa	i would wait a couple weeks to a months. your younger so your alot more fertile. im sorry about your miscarriage :-\ good luck|`|TyZ3OX0Oaa	When you're older and preferrably married.|`|68l1TeDjaa	i feel your pain sweety. i had a mis back in august of 2005 at 14 weeks. miserable feeling. but you can actually get pregnant right away. your still pretty fertile. but you need to see why you had a miscarraige first though, i lost my first one because i am Rh- and had to have rhogam shots and they caught it too late. now i have a beautiful daughter. this pregnancy was monitored really close because of what happened in the past. talk to your doctor first before getting pregnant again. heal up first...|`|35irl04Paa	First of all, I am going to tell you that I am 20. I have a 2 year old and I am 37 weeks with #2. I really wish that I would have waited to have a child when I was young. If you are the party type then I would wait. If not then you probably have to wait atleast 6 weeks for your body to get back to normal.|`|AA11544533	I would give your body some time to heal.  I would wait at least 3 months.  Let your cycle get back to normal, and then go for it!  I am sorry to hear of your loss, I know that it hurts.  I have been there myself a few times.  <br>  <br>  Dee|`|RHtFuVmmaa	6 months.  Any doctor will tell you to wait 6 months.  That way the body can return to normal after having a rejection from a pregnancy.  Good luck in trying again.|`|lB8ZNNsJaa	Your really young to be having a baby. But if you want one, I would recommend you wait at least 3-6 months before you try again.|`|2MvI9cpTaa	Don't you people have doctors. It really scares me that people ask this stuff on answers to people you don't know...|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	give your body a chance to recover. give it a few months any way and good luck
O71xlcG3aa	If you read in the instructions it says that a positive result will last for 48 hours and a negative result will stay permanently.  No worries I think the hormone just dissapears or something after awhile.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	The same test? Yes, the lines fade. The result is only accurate for the first ten minutes. If you're concerned, take another test.|`|uuHPneEcaa	yeah, i believe so..u are pregnant congrats. like that one said go to the doctor soon and get ur prenatal care items. but i keep mine months after i found out i was pregnant and it still had the positive mark on it. <br>  <br>  good luck to u and congrats on ur new edition|`|dnG7fhnbaa	The results on a pregnancy test are null and void after 10 minutes...it's just because it was an old test. Don't worry, if it said positive to start then you're pregnant, false positives don't really happen!<br>  .<br>  <br>  Congratulations and good luck! x|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	they fade.<br>  <br>  i cant believe you just left it lying on your bathroom counter...thats kinda unsanitary. then again i am in the nesting stage. lol|`|96HWpdkFaa	Yeah, after more then three minutes the test shouldn't be read anymore. Your pregnant lol don't worry.|`|6TuxC5BLaa	whatever results you read within 10 mins is the right one, if you have left it for 2days needs to be binned because it wrong.Go and see your doc asap or another test and i am sure it's positive. God luck|`|5afecfa05f87995a1b137aca98f844b3aa	Positive tests can fade. I'd say take another. If the test was positive in the time limit then it's positive. Take another and congrats!|`|aJTBF7opaa	its old, if it was positive you are pregnant, You aren't supposed to read them even 10 minutes after results are shown cause it can change.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	if you got a positive when you took the test your pregnant. if its left too long the result can change back to negative. congrats :)|`|84b26tbzaa	hahahah yeah your pregnant hun the test gets old.....just go to the doctors to be sure and start getting prenaital vitamins|`|AA11404742	False positive are possible.  Try it another time or two.|`|9zD5HFvAaa	Old test your preggers...Congrats:)|`|6yy0jtzDaa	i dunno mine stayed positive take a couple more if it says pos make a doc appointment
7vLYjtqMaa	Another Pee on a stickaholic :) I tested 9dpo and got a positive, dollar store brand. It wasn't even so light i had to squint, you could tell right away. I am sure had i test earlier it would of been positive as well. I didn't believe it though, so me and dh went about bought ept and 2 more dollar store cheapies ( one was his so he could be the control group, his idea he is sooo funny) Well it turns out he was not pregnant, but i had a BFP much darker even though it was only a few hour later, and the other one was instantly positive.  Today i feel so absolutely pregnant though, i am wondering how i couldn't tell yesterday. I have peen my bladder out, lol.  Please update if you feel any symptoms or anything. It was weird, because 3 days after i ovulated i vomited up my prenatal pills, and i have not vomited in years, so i was suspicious.  Oh and even if the line has dried out and vanished it does not matter, you are indeed pregnant :) good luck! Take a fr or a ept, my ept was soooo dark, i felt silly for not testing sooner.|`|lhn1wNoeaa	I never experienced,but if it shows positive then its positive. Congrats!! For your satification take a test after 1 week in morning. Lots of baby dust to you.|`|g9ScMmFFaa	were you using an ovulation kit?  maybe you ovulated a little earlier than you thought this time around. but, anyhow, rumor has it that if you see any kind of color in the positive line than you are pregnant!  congrats!  if you are still doubting, take a test again in a few days, i bet the results will be more obvious!|`|ObngKaoWaa	wow u r lucky and if it was accurate then MANY CONGRATS!! I myself am about 5-6 dpo and took an ept but got a BFN.not disappointed though,was too early.but maybe instead of using the clear blue i shud use the dollar brand,seems to give the results u want...hahahahaha<br>  oh and forgot to mention that a LINE IS A LINE.wether faint or not...so congrats again mommy to be!!|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	You wouldnt get a positive 5 days after ovulation, You would of had to be pregnant before this ovulation. It could be a false positive also.
KICQQxLxaa	Do you have any frozen bagels or waffles?  Those can be good to gnaw on (with supervision of course)<br>  <br>  Run your clean finger along the gum line where you think the tooth is coming in, the pressure may feel good.  Let him gnaw on your finger for a bit.<br>  <br>  Wet one corner of a washcloth and freeze it.  This way he doesn't have to hold onto the cold washcloth, but he can chew on it.<br>  <br>  Wait, he is not even two months old am I correct??  He may be too young for teething, and something else may be wrong with him.  Does he have a fever or anything else?  Is he eating like normal?<br>  If he is under two months old, I would not give him orajel or Tylenol without speaking to your doctor.  He is just too little...<br>  ETA:  Since your doctor saw the little tooth bud, I would give him a ring and see if they have any suggestions since he is so little.  I wouldn't use the bagels/waffles on him at 7 weeks!<br>  Good luck!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	You can try a little tylenol. This one sounds strange and took me a long time to try but they make amber teething necklaces. I guess it's suppose to reduce swelling naturally. My son is 12 months and I just got one for him a few weeks ago and it seems to be helping. I guess I will know for sure if he cuts a tooth soon. I have tried teething rings, wash clothes, teething tablets, baby gel, tyenol, and motrin(after 6 months) and none of it worked well.<br>  <br>  I found mine at a small baby store in town, it was about $15. I see them online for a wide variety of prices but it shouldn't cost much.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	I got this tip from a mother with six children.<br>  <br>  Sprinkle sugar on a thin slice of onion.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for about 15-20 minutes.  When it starts to turn to a gel, rub some of it on the baby's gums.  It works!|`|V8GrFx0jaa	If he's that miserable, it really is okay to give him Tylenol. Ask your doctor if you want to be sure, but it sounds like it might be time to give him some relief.|`|0dwVWzLJaa	ice cream will cool his gums down xxx just use a vanilla flavour not the best thing i nw but will definatly help! xx|`|FQ4nhSiRaa	the proper dose of infant Tylenol or motrin(motrin if over 6 months) and baby orajel (just a tiny dab and be very careful to only put it on his gums where it hurts, you dont want to numb his gag reflex).<br>  <br>  The tylenol or motrin will take a bit to start working, but the orajel is instant. When  my baby woke up in the middle of the night screaming one night (he never does) we got the feeling thats what it was I rubbed on a dab and he relaxed within a few seconds. Sure enough, he was getting his first 2 (yes 2 at once) and now another 2. Breastfeeding often also comforts my little guy or a bottle if you dont breastfeed.|`|38902e2ce5f8ef4d27715901e6c92e15aa	Baby Orajel might work, it numbs the gums so they can't feel the pain. Good luck, I know I am going to go through the same thing here pretty soon.|`|r4E2zXL8aa	Hyland's Teething Tablets. 100% natural and works great.|`|ikwkw7Q6aa	orejel is good my dr had me give that to my son it helps alot or there a gum cleaner thing that helps the itchiness
ZZztSumhaa	LOL my daughter Blake gets really sick on her period so one day she asked to stay home and i said why and she said im on my period, a few days later my 6 year old son asked to stay home. When i asked him why he told me he had his period.|`|sEihaeLNaa	lol lol thats too cute. I dont have one but when my son was younger, he used to like going to the restroom with me and when i was on my period he would see that i would put on a pad on my chonis and after that he was the one putting the pad on my chinis for me (i coverd myself ofcourse =-) i thought that was cute.|`|bXRuC1ASaa	Aww that's adorable! No, I'm boring and have nothing like that.  But I did want to add then instead of writing 20 characters, you could put spaces in random spots.<br>  <br>  ETA-Lol, no problem! Sorry I can't spell today..I'm writing the wrong words! Oh well.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Lol that is cute!...hmmm my daughter told a girlfriend of mine she wasn't leaving our house, no how; no way. I started cracking up. To add she stood in front of the front door with her arms open and she told her Auntie, you're not going anywhere! Amusing!|`|MChOb9IKaa	hahaha, that's funny!  =)|`|xVEqBjDVaa	hehe ! thats cute!|`|prqrQcd1aa	LMAO, My kids just asked me what I was laughing about.. My 7 year old just ran it and shook her head and walked away! LOL|`|DNygQdmVaa	Lol thats cute.<br>  <br>  my 4 yo asked me what tampons are used for lol|`|C3PbHd2Haa	ahaaaa. imagine you wher tha man behind the counter!! :L|`|jxXbLZn7aa	my daughter and i were shopping and we walked by the pads and tampons and she says to me in an extremely LOUD VOICE : MOMMY THOSE ARE THE DIAPERS U WHERE AREN`T THEY . LOL|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	LMAO  no, but thanks for making me make a fool out of myself in a room full of people!<br>  <br>  I literally just laughed out loud in a completely silent room when I read this.  OMG embarrassing!  LOL|`|hKJIDdVqaa	that is a cute story. LOL.  My 9 year old has a "sex" question the other day, so I informed him in a G-rated version, again where babies come from.  He looks at me and says "eww mom, you have sex?"  I said to him, "Well I must of had it at least 3 times, because I have you, your brother, and sister, where do you think you came from"  He turns and say "Mom (while rolling his eyes) I came from God."|`|WlU3NFu6aa	LOL thats so cute. <br>  <br>  On Saturday we were watching Little Einsteins teach the goose to fly faster and they flap their arms and sing "up and down." my 14 mo old started flapping her arms and saying "uh-ba-da." its funny cause she can actually say up and down. then yesterday we went to the zoo and they have a little playground. we spent a long time going up-ba-da on the slide. she had a blast!|`|723QHuicaa	My nephew told me about a memorial service they had for a piano teacher in his school that passed away. He went on to say -<br>  <br>  ''She wasnt there though, because she was dead''<br>  <br>  <br>  I found it funny, I guess its not really, but just the way he said it, i laughed.|`|j2mRop0laa	That's hilarious. <br>  <br>  I told my ten year old what an epidural was the other day.She informed me a little bit later that she decided to adopt babies from China. (Why china? lol)|`|F8KmTbqjaa	Awwwwww I love that one!  I cant wait until my daughter starts to do silly things like that!<br>  <br>  Ever heard this one so funny:<br>  <br>  <br>  A mother was working in the kitchen and listening to her son playing with his new electric train in the living room. <br>  <br>  She heard the train stop and her son say, "All of you sons of b*tches who want off, get the h*ll off now ' cause this is the last stop. And all of you sons of b*tches who are getting on get your a$$es in the train 'cause we're leaving." <br>  <br>  The mother went into the living room and told her son, "We don't use that kind of language in this house. Now I want you to go to your room for two hours. When you come out you may play with your train. But I want you to use nice language." <br>  <br>  Two hours later the son comes out of the bedroom and resumes playing with his train. Soon the train stopped and mother heard her son say,"All passengers who are getting off the train please remember to take all of your belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon." <br>  <br>  "For those of you just boarding we ask you to store all your luggage under your seat. Remember there is no smoking except in the club car. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us." <br>  <br>  "And for those of you who are pissed off about the two hour delay please see the b*tch in the kitchen."
AA11493831	I am not yet a mother. But with my cousins and friends who were expecting mothers before, they started looking and shopping for baby clothes, toys and cribs on their 5th or 6th month. They said that it's the appropriate month, to get ready. They did not bought a lot of stuff though, just the necessities.  They've started shopping full blast for the stuff during their 7th to 8th month.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Congrats!<br>  <br>  You can look! It's a good idea to shop around especially with big items like a crib. You don't need to buy it yet. I didn't really buy anything until I was 6 months along.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	I started early and ended up having a miscarriage at 20 weeks. I think waiting as long as possible is the best thing.|`|JbC50Xiqaa	I think you should def wait until after your baby shower. My best friend wanted to buy things so badly but she waited until after her shower and the only thing she needed to buy was the mattress for the CRIB! How lucky she was.<br>  <br>  I'm about 20 weeks but also waiting until after my shower!<br>  <br>  Good luck and what I suggest is starting your registries :)|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Honestly very early. I'm a first time mom and I didn't know all the dangers and stuff in 1rst trimester. <br>  <br>  I bought things that were gender neutral until 25 weeks when I found out she was girl. Then I went nuts lol.|`|MiKrWuM6aa	I heard that most people usually wait until the second trimester, just so they get past the worry part of the pregnancy.|`|w3ob12X6aa	i know its so tempting but i waited a little past when i found out what gender the baby was, then i bought stuff here and there|`|oWAUb6vpaa	I would wait until the fetus is of viable age. You don;t want to start too early just in case and you don;t want to wait until the last minute either. I would go with mid of 2nd trimester (maybe around 6 months.) <br>  <br>  Congratulations, mom!|`|wWkfASTNaa	I personally plan to at least wait till week 13, because after 12 weeks, the likelihood of m/c goes down alot. But I want to know what I am having before I buy anything too LOL so whenever  I find out.|`|yKS2UI87aa	I think I was about 19 weeks, right after the ultrasound said it was a boy. :o) Went a little nuts with the shopping b/c they said I would need drugs to get pregnant.|`|cnIzqEoDaa	I picked up a few outfits after I found out the sex. Its a good idea to hold off on most stuff until after your baby shower so you don't buy things that people are planning on getting you. Congrats on your pregnancy!|`|GUUgeptjaa	I started shopping every time I found out the gender and not before, but that is just me.<br>  <br>  My friend never found out but she started about the 5th month|`|BJN9LZmhaa	omg im 9 weeks and 2 days ad im tempted so bad lol iv actually already picked out what I want to get for the baby, either boy or girl. but idk when im guessing when you find out the gender|`|AA11542929	december when we bought all the furninture and clothes and everythng around 30 weeks..|`|xEunWNGKaa	someone bought me some vests the day i found out which scared me a bit. we bought a few things early on but left the big stuff till after the 12 week scan just to be sure.id say wait till you know everything is ok at the scan then go wild.|`|78bd51efe642ff8a6324d8c81d31f77aaa	I waited until I was about 20 wks which is when I found out what I was having, however when I shopped I still bought neutral gender items because I was worried they were wrong.  However they werent.  Also by the time I had her I still wasn't ready.  Hope this helps|`|pQ6ZowQZaa	Its all up to you. I waited to shop or tell anyone until miscarriage chance dropped at 12 weeks. It's up to you though, it's never to early to prepare yoruself for what is coming! Good luck and congrats!!|`|AA11042261	We didn't tell anyone until 13 weeks, when the miscarriage risk dropped considerably.  We're not doing any shopping until we discover the gender at 21 weeks.|`|5Jn3Wkbeaa	We actually bought the stroller and playard right when we found out, which could have been a HUGE mistake if i had miscarried. Obviously, we started buying clothes once we found out the sex.|`|ZfNCkHllaa	I waited till i found out what i was having. so you don't have to buy alot of ugly green and yellow things. you could get furniture.|`|gH2Il5QNaa	WAiT TiLL THE BABY SHOWER
1rmSuG2Haa	My son is 9 months old and he feeds about 5-10 minutes on ONE breast (rotating) every 5 hours or so. He usually feeds anywhere from 5-8 times per day (more when he's going through a growth spurt!)<br>  <br>  The only time he takes a little longer is at night before he goes to bed.. he'll feed and then he stays on a little longer to 'comfort suck' until he drifts off to sleep. Sometimes he even falls asleep, and while he's snoring -- he still drinks a bit -- its sooo cute! =)<br>  <br>  He used to feed A LOT, like constantly at 5 months old.. but the older he gets, the quicker he's getting.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Only 5 times a day?<br>  <br>  My first nursed at least once an hour during the day and every 2 hours at night at that age, but for 5 minutes or less.<br>  <br>  My second was nursing probably 10-12 times per day.  For 10-40 minutes.|`|RdIwtjURaa	when i first had my baby she was feeding 20 min on each side too and she wanted to always feed. then her doc said she only needed to feed 10 to 15 min on each side, and that she just wanted to suck on something. so i introduced the pacafire. I was nervouse to do that because i didnt want her to get nipple confusion but she didn't and she only eats on each side for 5 min now and every 3 hours, and sleeps through the night. your baby is 5 months and won't get confused. though I don't know if he will take a binky now, but you could try.|`|qFmOuXMXaa	My daughter just turned 6 months and she eats every 3-4 hours and she eats about 6-8 minutes on each side. I think he may be taking that long....more for comfort. I would cut him back a 1-2 minutes at a time till your down to about 1/2 hour each feeding. I don't think he is getting your milk for the whole 20 minutes, just sucking air for comfort.<br>  I may be wrong but that just sounds like a really long time.<br>    Good luck|`|XB1IDYoraa	10 minutes a breast, I think, when they're first born like once every 3 hours, even at night. 5 months old I think a good 20 minutes a breast about 2 or 3 times a day. You should use a search engine, this won't help.|`|txv7TIgiaa	i just nursed my baby as much as she wanted and it did feel like constant on and off breastfeeding...just wait the older they get the less they need to nurse...my daughter is 15 months and still nurses just to go to sleep at night...|`|ms2H2UZIaa	Every baby is different and feeds at his own pace. But that sounds pretty typical of my son when he was that age. Don't worry, when they hit 6 months its a whole different game. They stop feeding as much, are crazy about your food and anything solid they can put in their mouth and go much longer without eating because the baby food keeps them full. It all happened so fast, pretty much in one week right after his first tooth came through.|`|4a85e096b2b4b1d05827d5046a59b396aa	Thanks for asking this...I was wondering this just last night!  My 11-week-old nurses for 15-20 minutes on the first side and then 5-10 minutes on the other...every 3 hours during the day and once or twice at night.  Lately, he seems to be more efficient...hope so because until now, it sometimes took 45 minutes or longer to feed him, so it felt like I was nursing him every 2 hours!  Good luck!
0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	My 9yo son is beginning to have real perspective as his sense of humor is developing.  Whew!  Just when I was starting to worry that he was truly way too serious about everything.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	My daughter is 14 mo and she just started spoon feeding herself.  :-)|`|F6lZHRkVaa	It's not exactly an accomplishment, but I just found out today that my son is a huge flirt. We took him out to eat and two girls joined us - one was in her 20s, and another was a 9-year old girl. My son was smiling and giggling and acting all shy with both of them - even though he hadn't been interested in all the other people who were there before. It was so cute and hilarious.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	That is soooo cute!  What a smart little girl.  My daughter is 15 months old and started to say "I see" today for some reason!  I guess I must say that a lot or something????  She said "I see Melmo (elmo)" love it.  Add me as a contact..........I always see you on here!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	we are still working on writing letter with my daughter.<br>  my son he can climb up the slide and slide down all by himself.<br>  <br>  btw - i thought you were my contact already.  i just readded you.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Aww that's so cute! Lilly's started "laughing" - it's soooo cute.|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	My daughter will be 3 tomorrow and her newest accomplishment is putting together large puzzles, with very little help. She has mastered a 25 piece Dora puzzle and is now working on a Clifford 25 piece puzzle. She's growing up so fast! It makes me want to cry!<br>  <br>  My 18 month old has been saying "Thank You" since she was able talk but we haven't been able to get her to say "Please" or "Your Welcome" consistently. As of today she has said "Please", "Thank You" and "Your Welcome" where ever it needed to be said for 3 whole days!!|`|4YIUxSlYaa	She stood up not holding onto anything for 30 seconds yesterday!  She is 9 months old, I am SO happy.<br>  <br>  Also, she FINALLY learned to roll over, yes at 9 months old I think she is the only child that age that couldn't roll over!  Also, dead happy about that!<br>  <br>  If you lay her on her back she was like a turtle and she'd attempt to do sit ups, it was cute, but i'm happy she can roll.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	my 3 and a half month old, started holding a toy and actually recongnized that he had it. he was shaking it and trying to bring it to his mouth, today!! yea!! he also started laughing out loud last week. he has laughed a little before, but never for a long period. he has been though.|`|cen8SIssaa	my son is about 17 months and in the past 2 weeks he has started the tantrum and hitting stage but i am determined for that not to be an accomplishment...LOL|`|fdnbXfvfaa	She jumped a 6 hole cross pole on my horse, unassisted (as in my not holding the horse while running along beside it). She was so excited.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	getting his self into a sitting position and clapping... and today he's doing this motor boat noise with his lips.. you know what I mean?

It's so exciting!|`|Oxl4cyCyaa	I have 3 children, I will name their latest accomplishments :)<br>  <br>  My 11 yr. old - He is a pretty smart kid, but when it comes to Science he struggles a lot. Last week he studied very hard for this one review test where it was over the last 6 chapters they had done in class. It worth 2 test grades and he studied for it SO hard. He got it back on Friday and he got a 92!!!!! I was so proud of him!<br>  <br>  My 5 yr. old - Last month she read a picture book, (it had little words like cat, dog, bat, sat, mat...ect. and she did perfectly!)<br>  <br>  My 2 yr. old - Yesterday she went on the potty and went "pee pee" for the first time. I was so excited, lol, she didn't wear a diaper at all today and was really good about telling me she had to pee!<br>  <br>  I am so proud of ALL my children, thanks for the question!|`|JIxAVONXaa	I was so excited the other day when my son (4 end of may) spelled m-o-m. He was writing a letter (like normal haha) to mail me and he showed me nad said look I spelled your name and he pointed to the letters see M-O-M.<br>  <br>  He is close to spelling his name properly too, right now he spells it C-A-B instead of Caleb. But I am prouud of him either way. He always amazes me.|`|Q58Eedeiaa	My daughter is 16 months old and is counting to five unassisted and to ten with a little help. She has also started humming the alphabet. I love it! There's something new EVERYDAY! I love it when she does hand motions for the "Wheels on the Bus" and "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star".|`|ZZztSumhaa	My youngest son recently learned how to wink, LOL since then hes been winking at everyone.
oA8Rtyxuaa	I baby sat for a family who did this, its amazing at how well it works!! I used a Dora seat for my daughter, its padded so its softer. The family I used to babysit for used one like it and they just help their kids up, even when they had been sitting well, just in case. Good luck!|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Wow I read about the whole no nappy thing a while back...nappy free is commited parenting lol..good for you :)<br>  Non of my kids liked potties (your right, too hard too cold) We used a padded toilet reducer seat on the toilet. I dont know if you could get one small enough for your baby...maybe you will have to make something yourself??<br>  Good luck :)|`|WgyGipBMaa	thats young but who ever said you cant start early, he prob wont understand but its a good idea to get him  used to it try getting his fav charachter and one thats squishy?|`|8MnjjpJ7aa	that is way too young for potty training...12-18 months to start, boy usually are slower to train than boys. Good luck, but OMG he is too young.|`|T6OorlmZaa	Babies that young can't speak so how do they communicate that they need to use the bathroom? Sounds to me like they're not potty trained....they are "parent trained".<br>  <br>  I wish you luck.|`|WYlHY8jQaa	That is WAY to young to be potty training your baby. WOW!
723QHuicaa	NO but thanks! I seen it advertised, Im gonna switch over!<br>  <br>  I would like to think I could do it... But it would be so hard to grow and birth a baby then hand it over. You have to be a special person I guess<br>  <br>  <br>  **** I just switched it, I guess it would be easier for her since she has no kids. she has never had the after birth, maternal bond of caring for a baby. But its still a wonderful thing.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I think I could do it.<br>  <br>  But I wouldn't be up for all the interventions that go along with surrogacy.  There's no way I would see an OB, I don't do ultrasounds, and I birth at home -not compatible with surrogacy.<br>  <br>  ========<br>  Oh ultrasound, lovely things no?<br>  <br>  The ACOG did a huge study and found that "routine ultrasounds" cause more harm in the form of stress, unnecessary tests, and misdiagnosis than they have benefit.<br>  <br>  There are, of course, specific indications that they are useful.<br>  <br>  But they are less accurate than a skilled professional in almost all cases.  NEVER allow anyone to attend your birth that can't figure out the fetal position, placental position, fetal weight, and amniotic fluid levels from palpation and using a fetoscope/pinard.  What are they going to do if the power goes out?  Or the machine breaks?  Or can't get there<br>  <br>  ack more thoughts, and links, baby woke up.<br>  <br>  e-mail me if I forget to ocme back|`|50lIaC8zaa	Im sort of watching it. Half watching it and half typing, if that possible lol!<br>  <br>  I would love to do it as i like being pregnant but don't think i would be able to part with the babies (so kind of defeats the object really) LOL!|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I know a lady who can't have children and she is looking for a surrogate. She kinda hinted around to me about it but I could never give birth to a baby and then just give him or her away.|`|7M3JTnbxaa	I would have to give up my baby if I got pregnant at my age. Although I am pro choice I don't think I could ever personally abort! It would be hard to give it up but I would just be sure to not look at him or her.|`|6lyvhRLsaa	I couldn't do it. Not seeing the lady who did get attached to "Edward"<br>  <br>  Unless of course you find nicer people to be a surrogate for. That Olga was vile to her on the way out!|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	Aww damn, no my partner won't let me switch over! I'l watch it on demand tommorow. I saw it advertised last week but totally forgot!<br>  <br>  I am thinking of becoming a surrogate in the future. I am 20 now, I have a son, and I am longing for my third baby. (Second I lost at 19 weeks) I know people won't understand me or take is seriously at my age, as long as I know I wouldn't mind not having any more children, and after I am a qualified nurse I really think I would go for it.<br>  <br>  I'd love to help someone have a child, I would prefer it to be the woman's eggs not mine, but then again, if it were my egg - it would have been wasted anyway? <br>  <br>  I guess time will time won't it. An amazing thing to do for someone though :)|`|QAEQqgzyaa	I  don't think I could do it either. The only exception would be if one my sisters couldn't conceive and all though I am not 100% certain I would do it, it would be something I would considering doing for them but it is a very selfless act and one that would be very hard to go through with.|`|TrBoPj92aa	awwh, i haven't seen the adverts...show how much t.v. i watch!  i presume its on now, wish i could watch it =(<br>  <br>  i realyl couldn't do that wow that lady is so selfless like you said i couldn't put myself through that i was desperate to hold my twins at 7months!|`|wsctLFBSaa	i shall watch it but i couldn't ever give away a baby upon which i carried for 9months and gave birth to. It would kill me to give it away. These women have alot of courage and bottle!|`|HFJd3e1laa	watching and there is NO way i could do that. i don't REALLY think its right like go ADOPT a child surely that would be better if you no what i mean<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  xxx|`|QCVzUC1baa	Im recording it as my OH is watching 24!!<br>  Looking forwadr to seeing it tomorrow :-)|`|xy0W50Lqaa	I'm not watching it (bf has control of the tv) but I was watching her on This Morning.  I didn't understand her way of thinking at all.  She said that she didn't feel the same way carrying these babies compared to carrying her own 2 children.  She likes the feeling of the babies moving but the end of the day it's just a bump, she said.<br>  I suppose you have to be a very strong person to do something like that and she grew up understanding what parents unable to have children feel because it happened to friends of her parents.<br>  <br>  I've just watched part of it (I was allowed for 10 mins lol) I watched that couple walk out the woman's house with the baby in it's car seat, no words of thankyou or anything like that.  They just walked away and the surrogate mom is standing there crying her eyes out.  This is heart breaking to watch and this has really upset me for the night now.

He is clearly bitter about something and cant get over it himself. He sounds so immature and you are better without him. its hard. we all have been through a break up with someone we love and it does hurt but i promise you it will get better. Keep yourself busy and chill with friends. Go on a girls holiday and have a great time. the best way to get over someone is not have any contact. Delete his number, change yours and dont email him. I promise its hard but if you do that you will feel better. Good luck|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	hes playing you sweetie trying to get a reaction, test the ground if you like .sorry but he sounds a user it was a cop out to accuse you of cheating and by not even contacting you to dump you shows hes got no respect. forget him hes a looser|`|o8uGsZxmaa	STOP ASKING THIS QUESTION!!!!

Great job picking out your names. I prefer Vanessa Haley, but it is really up to you and your husband.<br>  What about Cassandra, (Cassie) Michelle<br>  or Sophia Haley<br>  or Helen Gabrielle|`|JveqFUOJaa	Gabreile also need help go to this website. <br>     <a href="http://www.babynames.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babynames.com/</a>|`|HBBb7MNQaa	vanessa haley, because a lot more people have the name gabrielle so i would go with something more original.|`|GTMq1nxEaa	Vanessa Haley|`|Df8RodwHaa	Here are some good names:<br>  Mikayla<br>  Ella<br>  Emma <br>  Alice<br>  Theresa<br>  Isabella<br>  Victoria<br>  Katelynn<br>  Harlow|`|F7KY7GhMaa	Gabrielle MIchelle|`|3g13ARkbaa	Gabrielle Michelle|`|NTKzocAIaa	Vanessa Michell or Hyley is cute|`|72SrLDQ3aa	Gabrielle Michelle, but the "elle" in both names is a little much.|`|rHufcHwHaa	Vanessa Haley.  So cute! <br>  <br>  I do like Gabrielle too, but Gabrielle Michelle is too rhyme-y for me.|`|nZVmkZSBaa	I don't like that Gabrielle and Michelle have the same endings.. And they are both way overused. Vanessa is just okay, and Haley is pretty cute. I prefer Vanessa Haley, but Haley Vanessa has a much nicer flow.<br>  <br>  Favourite Overall Name:<br>  Haley Vanessa - the flow is pretty bad, but Vanessa is much nicer than Gabrielle. It wouldn't really be used together anyways. :]<br>  <br>  Favourite Name:<br>  1) Haley<br>  2) Vanessa<br>  3) Gabrielle<br>  4) Michelle<br>  <br>  Best Combo:<br>  1) Haley Vanessa<br>  2) Haley Michelle<br>  3) Vanessa Michelle<br>  <br>  How about these: Gabriella Nichelle, Vanessa Nichelle, Haley Nichelle, Vanessa Brielle, or Ayesha Michelle. :)<br>  <br>  Your names aren't bad at all, though. Gabrielle would most likely be shortened to Gaby, or Gabby, though. And bare in mind, she will not be the only Gaby or Gabby in her class. Vanessa is a lot more unique. I would definately go with Vannessa Haley if you are set on those combinations. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your pregnancy and congrats on your little girl. -x-|`|wdXQaATDaa	Vanessa Haley|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	Gabrielle Michelle.|`|9WovIk3maa	Venessa Haley is to cute|`|iAnJ8P3Uaa	Gabrielle but i dont really like Michelle how about switching it maybe like Gabrielle Haley Here are some other names maybe u would like for ur baby girl. <br>  Emma<br>  Emie<br>  Emily<br>  Elle<br>  Maya<br>  Madi<br>  Alexis<br>  Cara<br>  Lili<br>  Claire<br>  Hailey<br>  Julia<br>  Good Luck!!|`|fKCWfCviaa	well i like Gabrielle Michelle.<br>  but you just can't have two names that end in the same -elle.<br>  you have to change it up a little like..<br>  Gabriella Michelle<br>            or<br>  Gabrielle Michella|`|NRa5MJ3Paa	I love the name Vanessa!

C4ibOR7Laa	hi<br>  my last period was november 14th, making me about 16weeks and 4days, but im actually 17weeks and 2 days, i go off the scan, you can get pregnant before you ovulate|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	At my OB office, they will go from the first day of your last period, unless the scan measures the baby to be 2 or more weeks bigger than those dates. That is the only time they would change my due date.|`|CFFuFof1aa	The scan is more accurate. It measures the size of the placenta, the size of the uterus, and the baby. I would go by the scan. Congrats by the way!!!!|`|8mchLCQhaa	I know when I ovulated so I know exactly when I got pregnant and it is right on with the scan date. I am due July 16th.|`|rDw9N09iaa	some people can get pregnant before ovulation. but the reason that you are a week ahead of schedule is because your baby might just be growing faster! congrats|`|QMxEjCpiaa	I know for the US, you go by the ultrasound data. I calculated about 10 weeks when I first went in for my ultrasound, but discovered that I was truly only 9 weeks. I would go by the size of the fetus in the first ultrasound.|`|j083iujcaa	well I'm 33 weeks with twins and the sonogram puts a due date for one as 4-25 and the other 4-27. but I'm planning on having them both the same day lol.<br>  I use the date of my last perion as the reference point to calculate the due date
ZYlr9TSBaa	Hon, you will look back on this in years to come and you will realise this is one of the best things to have happened to you - he's a d!ck, you deserve better than him *hugs*.<br>  Can someone not take Alissa for a while? To give you a break and sort things out a bit? <br>  <br>  You know all about my situation - and what gets me through each day is Lilly. Just getting a gummy smile from her makes everything bad go away for a split second. You need to concentrate on you and Alissa - just carry on being the best mummy you can be, like you have already. You will find a decent guy out there one day, but for now, you need to concentrate on yourself and Alissa, you two are more important.<br>  <br>  You do:<br>  - Need to remain positive. This is a GOOD thing that's happened, you will see it in time.<br>  - Need to concentrate on yourself and Alissa.<br>  <br>  You should NOT:<br>  - Dwell on things, think "what if" etc.<br>  - Ever consider getting back with him.<br>  <br>  You know where all us mummys are if you need us :) xxxx|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Hey hun, hugs.  I split up with my son's father when Luke was a month old.  It was my decision, but that didn't make it any easier.  You'll cope with being a single mother, because you need to.  And in all honesty if you're happier, your daughter will be too.  <br>  <br>  Busy yourself with keeping your daughter busy and going to little play groups, baby classes etc.  Get out of the house everyday, even if you just go a walk nowhere in particular.<br>  <br>  Be single for a while and concentrate on you and your daughter.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	only thing you can do is take it one day at the time; or if you have to, one hour at the time....good luck, i am sure it is very stressful....best wishes|`|50lIaC8zaa	I know how it feels me and my ex split when my older daughter was 1.5 yrs old and i felt exactly the same. I felt like i couldn't do it on my own i though i would be on my own forever it wasn't a nice place to be. Well a few weeks went by and i managed, i still felt lonely at times especially at night when my LO was in bed but slowly it got easier and i realised that i hadn't actually loved him for quite a while i was just scared to be on my own.<br>  What im trying to say really is that it is hard to start with but you will be fine and in the long run probably be a happier person. <br>  I met my now partner about a yr after i split with my ex and we have been together for 4.5 yrs now and have a beautiful 9 month old and he loves my 6 yr old like his own. There are good ones out there :)  xx|`|oXIYHsDaaa	The daze is pretty normal, you will be fine you just do what needs to be done and carry on with life. My Son was 2 when his dad and I split, I had been only working a couple of days a week and I was honestly really scared, the last thing I wanted was to end up living in my parent's basement. It was actually a lot easier then I thought it would be, I found a job and daycare and applied for daycare subsidy and it was different but better in a lot of ways, eventually I ran into this guy I used to date in high school and well 4 years later we now have a beautiful baby girl, I was able to buy my own house ( ok so it's a mobile but still it's mine all mine and I got it on my own without any body's help so to me it's a palace) I worked my way up to a full time position at work and could quit my second job and everything is way better then it was with my ex, we weren't happy then and now I don't know about him but I'm a heck of a lot happier and better off. <br>  <br>  The next month or two will be a blur but with help and support from friends and family you will make it just fine. Find out what support programs are available in your area and take advantage of them until you get on your feet, that's what they are for.|`|ovBNlMTsaa	I dont know why you 2 broke up but I am about to be single too, but by choice, because he's an abusive pr*ck. Still, at times I feel like I could die and I feel so lonely and its painful...I am just sticking it out, because I have to.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I don't really have any advice for you, but I wanted to say that i'm sorry this happened to you.<br>  And you have all us girlies to cry to if you need any of us :-)|`|9QVjNaIPaa	just dont dwell on it. take every day day-by-day and just focus on your little one. soon enough you will find all these things you have been wanting to do but haven't been able to do them! enjoy yourself and your time with your child as much as possible. hang out with friends, family, go out and do new things, meet new people, even spoil yourself a bit. and someone else said, see if you can get someone to take your daughter for the day and go out get your hair/nails done, do some shopping, make a lunch date with the girls, whatever! just move forward and don't look back. it will get easier real fast!|`|mEsMBOH9aa	If this means going back to work, find the best childcare you can.  Seriously, don't stop looking until you find someone who you're comfortable with.  As a single mom of a baby, everything else in my life was affected by the quality of care my dd got while I was at work.  Also, invest in a good pump.  Keeping your supply up (and having milk to give the childcare) is so important.  <br>  <br>  If you're going to have to be away from your baby during the day, consider co-sleeping or at least sharing a bedroom with your baby.  The extra closeness will help you both.<br>  <br>  Get some counseling.  Single parenting is rewarding, but tough.  You need to have some help in getting used to being on your own.  Autonomy in parenting, and in life, is a little weird after being partnered for a long time.<br>  <br>  And be easy on yourself.  You're going to make mistakes, and you should forgive yourself for them.  Just be on the lookout for any depression or anger warning signs, and seek help immediately if you see them.|`|723QHuicaa	Your stronger than you think Tauree - Ive said it before, this will be the making of you and you will look back on it ending with him to be one of the most positive situations in your life.<br>  <br>  Can anyone take alissa overnight, to let you chill on you own? get your head sorted?<br>  <br>  You will cope just fine. Your a good mum and you will find a good man who will treat you better than he did - you know you are better than that.
OGCohFyNaa	I have that same problem - I went to the ER after having it happen to me a few times and despite the fact that I KNOW it's not low blood sugar, that's what they said it was! (It's happened to me on a full stomach, and empty stomach, right after eating, etc etc etc... It's not an issue with blood sugar!)<br>  <br>  Anyway - does it happen all the time? Or just when you're doing certain things? Like mine would only happen when I was working - on my feet more than I needed to be and couldn't snack during... If you can figure out what's triggering it and avoid whatever that activity is, that's your best bet. <br>  Once the dizziness comes on though, you're pretty much stuck with it until it just goes away. The best way that I know of to deal with it is to sit down and try to lower your head and drink some water. Just try to get in a comfortable position and make sure that you're hydrated. I know it sounds weird, but if you can, eat a spoonful of peanut butter or something else that's protein rich. Sometimes that helps. <br>  <br>  Also, definitely talk with your doctor about it. If it's severe enough s/he should be able to do something. Just let him/her know if it's interfering with your everyday life and hopefully that will get something done about it. <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|dR2bqUixaa	I had it too. All I did was lay down and drink a bottle of water, just sipping it. Then I would feel better. Good luck! Congrads!|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	Talk to your doctor and they may be able to prescribe something. I take a prescription called Meclazine for my dizzys.|`|QzgkN2LZaa	consult your doc|`|cyBcZ1dVaa	I had that too...my doctor told me drink lots of fluids.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	Drink more water.  It will make you feel SO much better.|`|AA11105522	lots of water, elevate your feet and try to relax. i know it's easier said then done but those are the main things you can do to help and oh!! when you get up, get up rrreeallllyyyy sssllllooowwww!! lol i know it may feel funny the first few times but trust me it works and you begin to know how fast you can and cant get up. just take your time. your body is going through a lot of changes right now. good luck and remember ssssllllloooowwwwwwwww...... ;-)

I like it!|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	It's nice that you're trying to name your son something meaningful, but I think the pronunciation may be hard for people, and it looks as if it would be pronounced very similarly to a vulgar word.|`|9Zjk9dRqaa	that's good but can you fined another one that is easy for people to pronounce (im not dissing the name)|`|VmE0jG0Eaa	Oh /b/, you never stop trying too hard, do you?|`|sequZxauaa	now we're talkin'|`|Xu4x19y6aa	Well, I love it's meaning from your culture.

Qhyovyj8aa	Cellular respiration is the process in which an organism breaks down fuel in their body (usually glucose, but glycogen, protein,etc) to capture energy in a usable form (ATP). <br>  <br>  C6H12O6 + 6O2 ---->  6CO2 + 6H2O  (formula)<br>  <br>  Combustion is a series of reactions between fuel (usually a hydrocarbon) and an oxidant. Basically, combustion uses similar types of reactants as cellular respiration, and produces the same products.<br>  <br>  CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O  (This is an example of a combustion reaction).|`|4FhrvZ3Raa	Chemically the process of respiration is the same as burning a piece of paper, the reactants and products are the same. The same chemical reaction that converts paper to heat and light and CO2 can be used in the cell to generate atp.|`|5ba049abc44fd99ab0e13d585c2beddaaa	Cellular respiration is the set of the metabolic reactions and processes that take place in organisms' cells to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products. The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions that involve the oxidation of one molecule and the reduction of another.<br>  <br>  <br>  the chemical formula for both is similar.

oWAUb6vpaa	At about 10 weeks - your midwife may or may not try at this appointment but if not at this one, then at the next. <br>  <br>  Congratulations, new mommy!|`|PUdWfF0yaa	That's a hard one. I just heard the baby's heartbeat today and I'm 12 weeks. It really depends how that baby is laying. Trust me, it's there, it just may take a little time when your searching. Hearing my baby's heartbeat today was like some beautiful music. Congrats to you and Good Luck|`|hORVMOHKaa	i first heard my babys heartbeat at 15 weeks 3 days but that was also my first doctors appt!<br>  <br>  If you get the doppler you can hear it at 9 weeks, but im not sure if you will hear it from the ultrasound done on the tummy.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|VbkJ9Tucaa	Well my doctor was really sure that he'd hear it at 9 weeks because I'm really tiny but that was a no go. 9 weeks is the earliest to hear it over doppler I believe but usually it is detectable around 12 weeks.|`|uoMvSgceaa	I went for my first appointment when I was 10 weeks and my doctor heard a very strong heartbeat. You can usually hear them with a doppler as early as 8 weeks and as late as 16 weeks.|`|AA11197832	Nope you will definitely be able to hear baby.  Usually 9-10 weeks and any time thereafter.  Congrats!!!|`|h1AIzD9baa	I was 8 weeks when I heard mine for the first time..|`|pTrcOulfaa	I heard my babys heartbeat at 7 weeks 3 days :) All the best..

Good luck.|`|QSodlfMraa	i heard the babies heart at 16 weeks.|`|5SHPRfUgaa	My OB saw me a bit earlier then normal because I had a miscarriage 3 months before getting pregnant again. My first ultrasound was at 6 weeks and 3 days and we got to hear the heartbeat as well. It was amazing.. I didn't think you could hear it so early.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun! i was 10wks2 days on sat and I heard the babys heart beat at the obs office!!!!! I think u may be able to hear it!!!!! They say it can take up to 12 weeks to hear it tho. I hope you get to hear it!!! Its the most precious thing in the world!!!!!!!!!! CONGRATS!!!!|`|LFXTpqfdaa	Most likely, with a Doppler. If not, they'll do an ultrasound so they can see the heart beating instead, which is even more awesome.|`|KMtd5gr0aa	I had an ultra sound at 5 weeks and there was a heartbeat|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	i don't know but i heard my baby's heartbeat at 12 wks
g9ScMmFFaa	his body might adjust in a few days or weeks.  but do mention it to the doctor.  when my son was little i was told to add an extra half ounce of water to every bottle to help.  it seemed to work for him.  but mention it to the doctor, they all have different preferences and reasons for why to do things!|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	It's true that they go through a transitional phase when you change their feed, but given the allergy problems you might want to see a doctor (or pediatric gastroenterologist?) for formula advice|`|TLjNUJHLaa	When switching to a new formula it takes the baby body a while to adjust to it. I have gave my 5 week old a ounce of water to help with his bowel movements.

This is a tough one.<br>  3. I think Madison/Adison would work but I kind of think of those names as a bit more of tomboy names.

cv0foxlTaa	My doctor did it to me twice - once when I was 39 weeks and once at 40 weeks.  And yes, it hurt a LOT (although not even close to as bad as labour contractions lol).  Obviously, at 39 weeks it did nothing to put me in labour.  I did go into labour about 12 hours after the second time she did it.|`|af3618c3c438b0c88538a888bf12f6b8aa	No, not "sweeping membranes".  But with all 3 of my babies, I waddled around 3 cm dilated with baby's head practically resting on my cervix for the last 2-3 weeks.<br>  I hope the membranes act faster than that.<br>  Good luck, good delivery and blessed baby.|`|KlJHZRSiaa	Yeah my sister had this. Hurt like the devil. She was in labor within 48 hours.<br>  <br>  I love the euphemistic name for this. 'Sweeping the Membranes' sound like a massage, or something soft and gentle. They really need to call it 'Sticking my big finger through your very small cervix to make it wider' because that's what it is!!!|`|fnkAajbIaa	i went into labor approximentally 14 hours after my membrane sweep...by this time i was determined to get that baby out lol i wanted to hold her so bad and see her face so myself and my husband had sex... i drank ginger tea i tried everything... but nothing dangerous just to clear that up but then i went to walmart and went shopping decided to by myself clothes for when have her... and ended up shopping for about 4 hours went home and went to walk up my stairs to use the bathroom and my water popped.... was werid.. memebrane sweep doesn't always work but sometimes... i wish you luck and congrats on the baby when it gets here
AA11296427	No, because I don't want to be a Mother, and that's cruel.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|HOdblqIkaa	i would never trick a guy into thinking i was pregnant ive seen girls do it and it always ends badly (im currently pregnant now and ive had girls ask me to pee on a stick for them to make some guy think he was gonna be a dad) quite a few guys dont want kids and thats their choice im not gonna sink down to a pathetic level and try to rope them in. i didnt even know if i wanted kids for the longest time so if a guy tried to get me pregnant id be pretty upset. women do play quite a few games but thats not saying all women do. if you dont want to have kids the easiest thing to do is just not have sex and if you do then take every single possible step you can to avoid getting her pregnant.|`|YQrKQ5PAaa	NO!<br>  <br>  That is just stupid. Plus, I don't want some thing the size of a like... idk... football popping out of me right now.|`|VygBNA0Waa	no i would never trick a man to be a farther<br>  get your balls chop if you dont want kids|`|rKaUdhLUaa	No way! My sis lied to soo many men about being pregnant when she wasn't and tried to get them to have sex with her without a condom "since she was already pregnant". 2 of the guys I knew and they came to me and asked if she was really pregnant. Also my old friend was 17 and poked holes in the condoms she used with her BF, they have a baby now, but he left her psycho *** after a year of living with her.|`|7810472dea4ef476f08e138148939625aa	my friend did that 2 a guy. this guy was 24 and her 18...<br>  she moved in with him the 1st month of there relationship. and was prego by the end of 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  myself and my boyfriend would be happy with or without.<br>  i told him im not having kids and he said hes fine with that..so we plan on getting alot of animals xD|`|hORVMOHKaa	nope i would never trick a guy into having a baby! me and my husband made the decision together to have a baby but after a year stopped trying and then we got deployed to Iraq and then it happend without even trying!|`|M1J4xDJgaa	they shouldn't, it's cruel. i choose not to date in case that happens, i'm fine being single and i don't want kids at the moment, but if it ever happened to me, ???|`|yKS2UI87aa	I would never trick a guy into that. I have heard of men doing it to their gf's as well. My friend was going to go into the military and her bf  didn't want her to go. Sabotage. Unfortunately it can go both ways.|`|zMIjSDAsaa	NEVER that rude and cruel. not only is it that its the face that your willing to have a kid just to keep a guy. Its wrong!|`|iVWfyNiUaa	go to <a href="http://forums.realcollegebasketball.com/index.php?" rel="nofollow">http://forums.realcollegebasketball.com/...</a>|`|VdnAH78Xaa	no, that's just mean and cruel|`|dMLLQruOaa	Nope. I know what that would lead to. The guy leaves the girl, end of story. And if they stay together, the guy resents the girl, and they both are unhappy. I do think that both parties should take action on whether or not they want to be parents if they are sexually active together, even while on Birth Control bc no birth control is 100%. I would never trap a guy into being a parent, though i would never have sex with a guy that doesnt want children when i do. In the instance that birthcontrol doesnt work, i would like to know that the partner would be supportive. I also encourage guys to stop having sex with women who also have different wishes about children than them.<br>  <br>  <br>  ***Sorry, i mistyped in the 3rd or 4th sentence. I fixed it now.|`|51kWLqV9aa	it is ironic that you brought this up i was just reading another question asking how a girl could trick her boyfriend into becoming a father with oput his knowledge!<br>  <br>  NO. personally i would never even have thought aboput doing somethinmg so immmature! that is a great way to become a single parent! many young woman and girls want to make mothers out of themselves for the best interest in them instead of a child.|`|c9ec0233d1d48d45c1d947009910828eaa	no. how bout this one. my an trying to get me pregnant and i dont want kids right now either. its fu*** up. im 24, so i dont know how young you talking. i know girls try to have babys in order to keep a man. i aint with that shyt. espcially when they dont work|`|tt6SzpTFaa	No. It's his choice if he wants to be a father, and I will respect that. Plus, I believe in true love and waiting for the right man to come along. My "right man" will want to have some kids. So I'm not having any children until I find this man.|`|a9x4o0mFaa	honestly no i wouldn't do that because i wouldn't want to be a mother at this age.But i do know a girl that has done that now i am in 7th grade and i know an 8th grader that is pregnant already...i feel so bad for her because a 30 year old man got her pregnant and she was sleeping until he started you know the process
29a2wm7Eaa	When I first read this I thought you meant no tv, gaming system or computer at all in the house, not just in her room.  My question was what you were planning on replacing those thing with.  Now my question is why anyone would put those things in their child's room.  It's hard enough to control the amount of time my daughter spends on our gaming system when she's in the family room and she has to get off for anyone else to watch tv (yes, horror of horrors, a house with only one tv).  I can't imagine how you would encourage a healthy lifestyle or family communication when they lock themselves in their room to play all night and day.<br>  <br>  Right now it's the wish for a cell phone at my house.  I refuse to buy her one.  She's 10 years old.  She tells me over half her class has one and I'm shocked by that.  I figure I must be raising a future world leader...somebody still capable of carrying on a conversation face to face using voice instead of fingers.|`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	Whether you lock your kid up until they graduate college w/o any luxuries or give them all the freedom in the world w/everything they could possibly desire or somewhere in between the kids are "screwed". In the end it's all your fault and there isn't a darn thing you can do about it. So, why not make it worth your while and deprive them of all those pleasures.<br>  <br>  Seriously, though, she'll get over and be better for it. Even when she blames your for what ever is going wrong in her life she will secretly be thanking you.|`|dAgtW3G0aa	LOL its hard to be that parent isnt it, I worry sometimes that our house rules seem harsh compared to others but at the end of the day its our house, our rules and the kids have to just respect them and I hope that one day they understand that we were doing it for their own good, kids need rules and discipline and they end up far more screwed up when parents dont set them any boundarys.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	Yes she is.<br>  But it is for her own good.|`|GMIsOYYCaa	I definitely think that people need to consider the reasons why they choose to do certain rules. Often, it is because we grow up with those rules ourselves, and as they are traditions, we just accepted them as the facts of life. But by not questioning anything, why the way things are, you are keeping yourself locked in a box, unable to see anybody else's point of view. People need to consider why they do things, otherwise there is no value to their actions.<br>  <br>  Why are you not letting your daughter watch TV or have a computer? Is it because you are afraid of the detriments it might have on her intellectual and mental development? Or are you afraid that she is too immature and weak to deal with what she sees in the media? <br>  <br>  Why are you not letting her date or wear make-up? Is it because your mother gave you the same rules and you think that tradition should be kept in your family? Do you think that your daughter isn't capable of handling herself appropriately alone with a boy?<br>  <br>  Why are you not letting her get a license? Are you afraid that she's going to get into dangerous behavior while off in a car with her and her friends? Are you afraid of her leaving your household?<br>  <br>  I think you need to meditate on these questions and any other rules that you may have and really come to a decision about why you put them in place. And then, after that, explicitly explain to your daughter why these rules are in place. If your reasoning for not letting her wear make-up is "Because I'm your mom and I said so!" then yes, that *will* make her resent you, because you are claiming your authority is coming from your status as her mother, not on any rational, logical thought you put into your decision and rule making. Also, she will probably get quite upset if you say it's because she is too weak to handle herself around boys, which is just an insult to her character, and an insult to the way you raised her. Like I said, this will take careful re-examination of your values and traditions.<br>  <br>  Something to think about =)|`|mFaHJE9gaa	And I though my parents were bad. Just kidding: But it would be a great idea to add more details as to why you are doing this. Is she in trouble and this is punishment? Or do you just not have the resources for the games and such???? Is she an only child? <br>  In my opinion your expectations/rules are set too high. the TV/game systems do not need to be in her room. that's fine. especially with computers unless you are able to monitor very well what she is getting into.<br>  as for the Dating, 17!!! Ouch! My Parents set the standard at 16 and that was that was hard. All my friends had already been dating for 1 or 2 years; guys were asking me out and I had to say no.....it was very hard and it was made fun of by others<br>  It would be a good idea to Encourage "dating" but not going steady. You do want her to get out there before she leaves home and runs off...to encourage her to find her match. If you think about it, you could be cutting back that opportunity for experience for her. Get her on the path to safe and smart dating. not just restricting it but giving an age limit.<br>  No license Until 18! Holy crap. I don't know the laws in your area but I was driving at 14. As long as she's smart about it. Again, I don't know  why you are choosing to do this, but if she is in trouble, just tell her she has to be responsible and tell her if she wants it, she has to earn it. Whether that means Paying for the license and/or a car on her own so be it. But you can't just over rule her and say no with out reasoning.<br>  NO MAKE UP!!! OK- we hit and age where the little girl cuteness leaves and we need to accent our features: this doesn’t mean we have to use everything in our makeup box every day.<br>  Looking back I wish I had discovered Just mascara 1 year sooner, so that would have been age 12.  Young girls do have a lot of natural beauty. so like at Ages 13& 14 I had mascara, 15 I added blush the actually exchanged it for eye liner, then when the break outs came I had to throw in foundation which washed me out and I added back in blush and a little eye color.<br>  <br>  HONESTLY my Aunt set strict rules like some of yours and then some, and her kids rebelled and were way worse. They cut class, they took inappropriate changes of clothes in there book bags, one got pregnant, others got tattoos and piercings. The more you try to hold them under your thumb, the harder they try to wiggle out.<br>  <br>  set boundary’s are good but don't go too far|`|hKJIDdVqaa	while I disagree with some of your views, you do have reason to be mildly concerned.  Sure I would never allow certain things, but other things I do not mind.  I do not think she will hate you, no.  You sound like a good mom, and over time I think you will loosen up on the restrains.  Actually a lot of the things I agree with.  No computer in room, good one.  My kids do have a tv, with parental controls that ironically they never watch.|`|4gZYucHMaa	I think it won't matter what you do or not too, we'll all of those days our kids will hate us.<br>  <br>  However I take the approach with my kids that I do moderation that way they won't go wild when they go out on their own. For instance, if i forbid her computer in her room, no makeup etc. How else is she going to learn how to conduct herself. I'll teach her the makeup applications so she doesn't go out there with frosted eyeshadow and pink lipstick--when she's older of course.|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	Yes, she is, and honestly, has every right to. Most of these rules are just to be controlling parent! The only ones I agree with are no license until she's 18 and no computer in her room, but ONLY if she's irresponsible and can't be trusted.<br>  <br>  Common, no make-up? Seriously, who will that hurt?|`|tOdjjeAmaa	Give her good reasons for your rules. Talk to her about why you feel the way you do and it's less likely that she will hate you. She'll probably still resent you while she's a teenager though. But I think once she gets out on her own or has a kid of her own she'll understand :) Good luck!! I plan to be a really strict mom as well with my daughters! I guess the hardest thing for us moms will be picking which battles are most important. I'm honestly scared as hell for when I have teenagers! And mine is only 2... the other one is still baking. lol|`|uCnmYEPBaa	Maybe at first. But as she gets older she will appreciate the rules you gave her.|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	Honestly, yes.  If you are that incredibly strict... as in just plain "NO" to everything, including harmelss things in moderation, then it is very very possible that you will have a difficult time creating a healthy relationship with your daughter.<br>  <br>  While it shouldn't be a free-for-all, it would be better to teach respect and responsibility with those things.  For instance, when she's interested in make-up, you teach her to use gloss and natural looking techniques instead of hoochie blue eyeshadow and dark black eyeliner.  Or if she's interested in TV, you can agree to only certain shows or a certain time allowance.<br>  <br>  I had friends whose parents were radically strict as you are suggesting.  The one girl with the strictest parents couldn't talk to them about anything at all, snuck into the girls room at school to put on make up and hairspray, then took it off before going home, got pregnant at 13 and ran away at 15.  Since the answer was always "NO", she didn't have the chance to learn responsibility and communication with her parents.  She turned out to be a fine and intelligent adult, but not without a great deal of suffering before getting there.<br>  <br>  You may want to re-think and revise your strategy so that it allows her to have some control over her interests, and ensures that you will be in the loop and have influence over those choices.|`|winmjHAmaa	We grew up without tv, gaming systems, or computers.  I wasn't allowed to date until I was 18 and make-up?  No way.  I learned the importance of quality time with friends and family and what true beauty is.  Now I am 21 and I only fought my parents with one thing and that was dating.  I wanted to date a guy at 17 and they said no and that was that- end of story.<br>  <br>  My parents were the best in the world.  I thought so then and I still think so.  My life growing up was PERFECT, I wouldn't have changed it for anything.|`|VudhjHi2aa	Not Always. I had a friend like that growing up. And she turned out just fine. She never hated her mom or dad for the rules like that they placed in their home. She did however get married and had kids early in life. She was about 20 when she got married. But she never hated her mother or farther for it. She did get to watch T.V. (only the ones Mom and dad said were ok) but no gaming system and well Computers were not something we had as kids. But she never dated till 18 or ever wore make-up she was like me Total Tom-Boy. So I think it all depends. Just make sure you let her know why you are doing what you are doing. And let her know it’s b/c you love her and want to keep her safe.<br>  As for my family I had rules but was aloud to watch tv I was never told not to wear make-up but again I was a tom-boy and didn’t want to not even in high school. And I believe the rule that my parents did set made me who I am today. Like I said I got to watch TV but only one hour a day. And when I look back at that if I did not have that rule I wouldn’t have gone and played outside as much as I did. Ahh I loved those days.<br>  Question? What made you decide this? What was it that was on here that just made you decide that was that?|`|UKPYoPKuaa	Well ask your yourself why you feel the need to 'exagerate' on the strictness? The things you've prohibited are fine (even beneficial) in small amounts.. many things in life are. Give her a little more independance as a teen & explain the rules if she breaks them... then it's time to ground her. Not before : ) If you are overly strict when she leaves home chaces are she may go over the top on the stuff you desperatly tried to keep her from.|`|cteyFJxhaa	Possibly, but if you're mom raised you like that and you turned out ok then it can't be all wrong.  You do what you feel is right.  Just because I intentionally raised a lunatic (by some peoples standards) doesn't mean that you can't raise your kids in a more conservative manner.<br>  <br>  I won't judge you, I promise....and if I can't keep that promise I'll at least shut up and mind my own business!|`|BRT2teSqaa	To each their own.  Sometimes too many rules produce great well mannered and respectable adults, and sometimes it causes kids to "go wild" when they turn 18.  I wouldn't advocate a sheltered life.|`|prqrQcd1aa	LOL, yeah you do this and you may have the opposite affect going on.. she may end up like the smart azzes on here..maybe worse!!! ;-)|`|JXB5pI7Aaa	She'll find ways around your rules, teenagers always do.|`|2pxiK9waaa	Well, the tv, gaming system, and computer in her room are understandable. However, the license, dating, and makeup are a little extreme. You need to balance discipline and rules with giving her a little bit of space. From what I've seen, the kids with really strict parents tend to be more "wild" than the ones whose parents encourage them to make good decisions for themselves. Point in case:<br>  My best friend's mother and father didn't let her do anything but babysit for her siblings, had to be home by 9, didn't get her license until she was 18, wasn't allowed makeup, etc. First of all, she drank like a fish in high school, wore makeup anyway, dressed in really slutty clothes that she changed into once she left home, and did lots of stuff with boys.<br>  <br>  My brother and I had rules while growing up, but we were taught to make good choices and that if we were ever in a tough situation we could call home for help. Neither one of us drank underage because we were never "forbidden" to do it. I chose on my own to get my license when I was 18 because I didn't feel I was ready. My brother was ready, so he got his at 16. <br>  <br>  By flat out saying no on some of these issues will encourage your daughter to be defiant and possibly will permanently damage your relationship with her in the long run. <br>  <br>  I see it time and time again, as I taught high school for the past two years. I'm not saying let your kids run wild, but I'm saying to give them the tools to be successful and let them make their own mistakes.
RgEtKVaKaa	Yes - a still born baby is dead.  Often times the parents know before the birth - on occasion, death occurs during birth.  As you can imagine, this is a very sad & tragic event.  Thanks for asking - now you know.|`|zbgYvrMraa	yeah, in some cases its like a miscarriage, but to far gone to just pass out the vagina, and to far gone to have an abortion. i think you have tablets or medicine to speed up labour and you give birth naturally.|`|iMaTMWMxaa	Yes it means that when the baby is born they are already dead.<br>  <br>  Extremely sad :(|`|mfnugUZJaa	Still born is when a baby is born dead.
E7ViD8EWaa	You need to stop asking this question, dear.<br>  You aren't going to get any more help the 6th time.<br>  <br>  Go to the concert instead. Twilight is a fad.<br>  <br>  =]|`|HOdblqIkaa	id go to the concert. the twilight stuff will be around for years, but paramore and no doubt in concert in your area wont happen again for quite some time. spend the money on something to make a memory not just stuff to have.|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	I'd pick the Twilight stuff.<br>  <br>  You can only see a concert once, but<br>  you could keep the Twilight stuff for a while.<br>  <br>  If you really want to see the concert<br>  then see it... it's up to you.<br>  <br>  The concert is going away and the Twilight<br>  stuff isn't.<br>  <br>  :]|`|mfBkH3qtaa	Go to the concert, definitely. You can always get Twilight merchandise somewhere some how. Whether or not it be on Ebay or not. So I would go to the Paramore concert!|`|y96eYj0Faa	CONCERT<br>  CONCERT<br>  CONCERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|oGlikPYxaa	Paramore rocks! GO TO THE CONCERT!!! :D you are lucky btw|`|y8p5GHaZaa	I would definitely choose the No Doubt.  It is a really good band and you will remember the concert for a long time.  You might never see No Doubt again and 10 years from now I think you will really appreciate the concert that you have fun memories from more than stuff that you probably will not even have anymore.<br>  <br>  Also:  How could you possible spend 150 dollars on Twilight related things?  Do they even make that much Twilight stuff?|`|RuxPKGSlaa	Go to the concert. You'll likely get over being a twilight fan soon enough, and won't even care about that stuff anymore. But if you go to the concert, you will most likely have fun memories for the rest of your life. You'll never outgrow that.|`|HcvqGMZraa	I think you should go to the concert because its not all the time you can go to a concert and then maybe ask her for a few twilight things or wait till your birthday.|`|NX4rewuWaa	paramore is amazing, go to the concert! if you need twilight stuff go to the library. (:|`|9cQ4cxg1aa	Quit asking this question. I am your age, and I WISH my biggest problem was to pick between a concert and tons of stuff. You are very lucky. Make your own decisions.|`|BD3sBP1caa	the way you answered the girl with the huntingtons baby was horrible and your a *****. just thought id let you know.|`|6pEDLnrzaa	Go to the concert. Twilight is kind of getting old.|`|7810472dea4ef476f08e138148939625aa	the best choice would to stop asking this question..u sound like a spoiled brat to me..<br>  <br>  please...just grow up :)
obN6p3Cgaa	So sorry to hear continue to try God is able to do the impossible******|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	How can you mess up a C-section unless you went to a incompetent doctor?  Repeated abortions, no matter how successful, can make a woman barren for life. So yes it is possible you can no longer have children after having 2 abortions and what sounds like a botched C-section.  But then again, I suppose you could get pregnant again with a doctor's help and you followed everything your doctor told you to do. I'd ask a doctor for better information then people on Yahoo Answers who aren't qualified in medical field and don't know your past histoy with pregnancy.|`|WIQhh62Zaa	First off, I will not pass judgement.  We're here to help.  Those who don't like someones choices (which they have had the courage to share with us) should answer the question without passing judgement or don't answer at all.<br>  <br>  Secondly, nowhere did you say that the c-section was botched.  You were simply putting everything out on the table by saying you've had one.<br>  <br>  So, the c-section itself should not cause a problem with fertility.  It may, however (depending on the scarring) require a c-section for the next child.  But they do now do vaginal births after c-section (VBAF).<br>  <br>  The abortions on the other hand may have caused a lot of scarred tissue.  The fact that you had two and one was not done properly makes it a higher risk.  I have heard about people having problems with fertility after an abortion.  If you find you are having difficulty, speak with your doctor.|`|3pIBqvWMaa	yes there is a good chance as long as ur haveing regualr periods and ur healthy...i had much the same thing i ended up with p i d..after i had to abort my pregnancy due to complications. i also have a 5yr old. p i d gave me scaring to my tubes but i fell pregnant again on the 1st try 14-16 days before ur period is due do lots of baby dancing during this time..but i had a miscarriage..but we r ttc again so good luck|`|txv7TIgiaa	oh my god that is so sad hopefully you will never kill another baby again it is very possible that you may not be able to conceive i have heard of this a lot....|`|9a3sNrEqaa	that would be something you should really go over with your dr hun. B/c you may or may not have excess scar tissue and only your dr can check that out for you. GOOD LUCK HUN!|`|Zqedg665aa	Just try, if it is meant to be and God's will anything can happen. We all make mistakes in our lives. Our bodies are an amazing and can do crazy things, so maybe it has healed itself. Try you may never know. :)
8WbfmK5daa	If you are formula feeding: Switch to a formula that breaks down the proteins such as Nestle Good Start for two weeks. If this does not work, try hypo-allergenic formulas such as Alimentum and Nutramigen for two weeks. They are very expensive but if it helps your baby, it is well worth the money.<br>  <br>  You can also try:<br>  <br>  Hold your baby and rock him in your arms. <br>  <br>  Put your baby in a swing and gently rock him back and fourth.<br>   <br>  Take him for a car ride.<br>   <br>  Carry him in a sling.<br>   <br>  Try turning on a fan or vacuum, using them as white noise.<br>   <br>  Try using a pacifier.<br>   <br>  Give him a warm bath. <br>  <br>  Try burping the baby. <br>  <br>  Use Simethicone drops to reduce the his gas pains.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i would ask his doc if there is anything that would really help the  situation in addition to some of the suggestions here....gl|`|AA11091233	Hi. So sorry...I know this is a tough one to handle.<br>  <br>  I would suggest the following;<br>  <br>  Make sure you use the Infacol before he eats if you aren't doing that already. <br>  <br>  Go to your library or order online...The Happiest Baby on the Block<br>  <br>  I seriously could spend an hour trying to write about it...but it's best for you to view the DVD or get the book. <br>  <br>  Best wishes...have faith...it won't last forever and there are tricks  you can use such as specific ways of swaddling, holding, white noise etc. that will help immensely.<br>  <br>  Take care.|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	Just curious here, but my son had it really bad for 10 months, I have had 3 girls prior to his arrival and they never had it, one thing I noticed that was different between them is my son never had his first black tar like stool, whereas my girls all did, so I was just wondering if your sons first stool was the same as I have an idea that colic is actually caused from the babies not discharging the gunk properly after birth.<br>  <br>  NOTE; This is just a theory of mine.|`|2ZoUduoPaa	First off, hang in there.  My little girl SCREAMED for the first 6 weeks of her life.  I didn't know if I really wanted to be a mommy.  I thought I was doing something wrong.  Of course, every baby will be different to the things they respond to but listed are some things we tried.<br>  -Per recommendation of our pediatrician we switched to a soy based formula.  (Ex: Similac Isomil Advance, Enfamil ProSobe)<br>  <br>  -She has Mylicon (or store brand gas drops) before every feeding.  <br>  <br>  -We too use Dr. Brown bottles.  <br>  <br>  -I also found that using ready made formula helps some.  It's already mixed, no guessing if the mixture is "just right".  Plus the powder seems to give more gas.<br>  <br>  -She burps after every 2 oz or so.<br>  <br>  -Sometimes the hairdryer works.  Just let it run.<br>  <br>  -A car ride (if this is feesable).<br>  <br>  Nothing really gets rid of it, but sometimes the child can be calmed for a short period.<br>  At the time I was too proud and stubborn, but enlist in help.  I finally had to break down and get some rest.  Colic has no cure.  (I sure was hoping for one).  Just know that like most things, this too shall pass.  It won't be long until you're looking back at all of this and wondering where the time went.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, yeah...try Little Remedies Little Tummies gripe water.  It can be found at most CVS pharmacies for about $10.  At 5 weeks your little one can take 1/2 tsp.  It contains ginger and just helps to calm them a bit.   I swear by this stuff!!!|`|z7YyYCYRaa	a few things i tried were going out in the car, a bath, putting on the hair dryer or hoover. i forget how old they need to be before they can have gripe water but it worked wonders for my little one.<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|5jqFrtrwaa	Ohhh been there.. poor you!<br>  <br>  Have you tried propping his cot up at an angle ie with his head raised? Also when giving him his bottles sit him as upright as you can and to wind him rotate him in a circle forward to back, this was a tip from my health visitor to relieve wind. Also my wee man loved lying on a pillow on his stomach across my knees, this got his wind right up and relieved his pain.<br>  <br>  I ca't think of anything else at the mo, except keep using the infacol or try gripe water, my mum swore by it - it worked a little too well for my son (made him bring up his milk with every burp) it'll work eventually.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|sWHGnt0faa	i no it doesnt sound ideal but 1 spoonful of baby rice after a feed works wonders, a doctor recomended my friend, to do this with her son, who use to cry from 7-11 everynight, he was soon cured.|`|5e412aad4ffaa97e07a7a620bdde1107aa	Try giving him those anti gas drops, called Mylicon. It works wonders!! You can even put it in every bottle if you like....
8NcuUEKkaa	providing there are no allergies, your 11mnth old can eat the same as you only smaller portions of course but dont use salt and cut down on fats and sugar, in other words if your having a gravy dinner they can have one too but take a small bit of gravy and really water it down then just give them a bit mash the spuds with milk instead of butter simple things like that, just to keep them healthy excess of salt or sugar or fat can have bad long term effects on their health, when my daughter was 11mnth old she loved a cup of tea when i had one  this is not an ideal drink but poured enough of my tean into her beaker to cover the bottom then half filled with milk no sugar, do not give coffee , coca cola is another no no lol you really dont want a caffeine psyched 11mnth old on your hands , rule of thumb is whatever youll eat yourself with no additives, be very careful with processed foods ie sandwich ham and pates its best to avoid these if posible luncheon meat would be one of the safer ones or proper ham off the bone but  only small amounts as its a presalted food|`|TYErFAAzaa	Regular table food.  As long as there are no allergies.
pXSKSS3daa	That's sad, but at least the mother made the best decision for her baby.<br>  <br>  I'm sure she'll get adopted quickly. Most people want newborns and babies over older children. I doubt she'll have to stay in foster care very long.|`|928d3c3f724692764257407068fe45d4aa	Infants get adopted VERY quickly and there is usually a long waiting list for adopting a newborn.|`|2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	Newborns and small babies have the best chances of being immediately adopted out.  Most people want babies, not kids and teenagers.  It's sad but true.  We went through a similar situation about 6 months ago with a family friend who abused drugs while pregnant and the state took the baby.  She was placed with the mother's sister for about a week, then was placed in a traditional foster home and will more than likely be adopted out since her mother continues to abuse drugs.  It broke my heart to see her go, but I'm happy because I know that she will end up in a much better family situation than what she was born into.  Hopefully.

You really need to take the fact that is is your friend out of the picture.  She is a mother that lets her kids live in the same house as a sex offender!!!!|`|JsqMSU9Haa	I don't think a registered sex offender is allowed near children regardless of parole - I'd keep making phone calls on that one.  I commend you for what you are doing for those kids.  I'd go with your gut - there is a problem.  Make an anonymous call to the 4year old's school - let them investigate as well.  Can you offer to take in her kids for a while?  She may accept.  and then either clean herself up or go down the tubes so much that you could get custody.|`|rBq189W1aa	Unfortunately, knowing somebody is lying and being able to prove it are two very different things.|`|jyXUm4YQaa	your friend has no bizz with kids|`|vGxipYJnaa	There are some tell-tale signs but they don't apply to everyone. Even a polygraph test is only about 90% accurate at best.<br>  <br>  You should call CPS and tell them that you don't think it was an accident if you think your friend might have hurt her child. Or even if you think it was an accident that could have been avoided if she didn't  have so many children. Just call CPS and voice your concern - it's anonymous.

UR9BX77haa	I work 24hrs a week, study & have a 2yr old daughter. Of course parents will brag about their kids and on here it sounds competitive even though the parents are simply telling what little johnny can do - they are just proud but it can come across wrong I agree. I am very guilty of it, but I also admit that my girl has issues,and I have worries about her.I may say how she chats like an adult now and has been fully toilet trained since 24 months, can count to 10 and recite many nursery ryhmes alone, etc, someone else may reply that big wow their 14 month old has been doing that for months, but I'll also mention how my daughter doesn't know many colours, won't play alone, drives me up the wall and still demands a bottle of milk which were struggling to wean her from. <br>  No one is perfect, if a mum is professing how clever, fast,wonderful her child is you have to remember that its not like that all of the time. With a toddler life is ridiculous most of the time so maybe it is a good sign that the parent can still talk about their terrible 2yr old who drives them bonkers in a good light. It'd worry me if parents started saying how thick and stupid their kids were.So just take it all with a pinch of salt, you must know that all kids are mini devils wrapped in angelic costumes lol|`|e60754e2c47d3732e670fc3cfec1373eaa	some mothers think they know it all and their method of raising a child is more superior to others! i'm a SAHM, and i'll openly admit there's days its bloody hard and i feel like tearing my hair out. i don't think i'm a perfect mum, but if someone on here asks for parenting advise, ie- their 3 yr old is over active- i'll try and give advise at something that worked for me. i hate all these bloody do gooders on here that their children never appear to put a foot wrong, or they themselves have all the answers to good parenting. i'd love to see some of them on a day to day basis- if they're that perfect, i'd buy their book!|`|OeD2sJt7aa	I'm both.  I work 3 days a week.  I attended prenatal classes and mom and baby groups (two of them!!) and I had a different experience.  I met some wonderful people who became good friends and met some great kids that my daughter plays with.  Maybe it feels like they are wrapped up in their kids because when you are with your kids and hanging around people with other kids, that's the topic that comes up!  I've learned lots from those moms, however.  They have great tips on potty  training, naps, long car rides with kids, etc. I'm sorry your experience with sahm's has not been positive.|`|Sn72zeBhaa	I'm on mat leave right now with number 3.  Yeah it is different when you work.  You actually get to talk to adults about things other than the color of the poop today, or the latest treats or tantrums.  I still felt "wrapped up in my kids" when I was working, I just didn't have as much time to do it.<br>  It is a full time job staying home, too.

Some of my friends that work find it hard to control their children because some-one else is raising them all day from 6am to 6 pm. They are always second guessing their own parenting skills and asking me for advice, I don't like to because they make excuses for their children's bad behaviour and blame it on the other children at day care or school but when their children are here at my home I can see it with my own eyes and know it's because they are trying to get mums attention or they just don't have direction. One of my friends said her son couldn't say please and thank you at 3 years of age and couldn't talk properly at all but he could say sponge bob square pants, I knew then that he could speak and so when every one had a drink I wouldn't give it to him until he said please. She replied, he can't say it and I said then he doesn't get a drink. With in 5 mins he was saying please and thank you. It's just because she didn't make him ask she just gave things to him. When had children I decided that I would stay at home until they went to school and i'm glad I made that choice.|`|rTAvnldfaa	my little boy is 2 and i currently work part time, i work three days a week 7.30 - 4.30 and also work from home to make up extra hours.<br>  <br>  i know what you mean people can come across as very competitive on here and think they know everyhting about kids and what they should and shouldnt be doing i take it with a pinch of salt and find some comments quite amusing!. <br>  <br>  oh and your completey right about prenatal classes and baby groups! lol unless you enjoy to sit and 'compare' for 2 hours.

I was a full-time working mother until about a year ago. I was a nurse working way too many hours for my own good or the good of my family. I am now a SAHM so I can have a life outside of work. I am blessed to be able to spend so much time with my children, I know there are many mother's in my area that would love to be a SAHM but just cannot do it. I am wrapped up in my children as I am a mom and they are my life. That is the reason I became a mom, to spend time with my children and make them my life. I do not, in anyway, think that I or my children are perfect and I feel no need to be in a competition with anyone for any reason. I do not go to baby groups or mother groups or prenatal classes as I do not think I would enjoy them either but I am not sure why this section has anything to do with that. I love and adore my children and I love my life just the way it is and I am not going to apologize to anyone for that. Each family will do what is best for them and not one way fits every situation.|`|BP5ykmAmaa	im a mum of a toddler and i dont work but im in no way under any illusion tht im perfect or my son! im also not competitive or 'wrapped up in my son' <br>  <br>  however<br>  <br>  i love my son with all my heart and would lay down my life for him. I want him to have the best start to life possible.. i chose to hvae my son when i did and its my responsibility to look after him, i want to see him reach his miles stones, such as taking his first steps, learning to talk and feed himself etc. i didnt have children to give them to someone else to raise! <br>  <br>  the baby group on here i have found, appear to have swallowed baby text books and spout out what children should be doing and when they should be doing it and they feel that makes them good parents by following the books to the letter and encouraging others to do the same, personally i have found that by listening to my child makes me a better parent. children do things at different rates and different times, none are wrong and by the time they are 30 does it matter they were potty trained 6 momnths later than the jones' kid, or they ate solid food at 4 months insted of 6?? NO<br>  <br>  thats the mentality i cant stand! the judging of other parents, hopefully everyone does what they feel is best for them, their circumstances and their child, if people offered advice rather than saying 'you cant, or you should' then this section would be a lot nicer place to be, likewise with some mums and toddler groups.<br>  <br>  the ones i attend aren't like that, they are easy going relaxed like minded women who offer each other support and advice not judge or preach, i dont think it makes a difference whether the mums work or not, if they are competitive then they will be no matter what, the groups are just as much for the child as for the mums too, so whilst your mums are competing and bitching etc their kids are getting on with things, forming friendships, learning new skills and boundaries and learning social, hopefully better ones than those parents.<br>  <br>  dont tar all stay at home mums with the same brush, some of us appreciate individuality and accept ourselves and each other for who we are and draw on each others strenghs rather than point out the weaknesses!|`|iMaTMWMxaa	When I answer questions on here, I try to give my experience. I hope I never sound like I'm being competitive, as I hate that too.<br>  <br>  I find this section really supportive, where people want reassurance from other mums it is normally given. <br>  <br>  One mum commented to me at the school gate a few weeks ago "You always look so calm and together, how do you manage with 3 children under 5?" I told her to look through my front door, and see the state of my house. I assured her that things are not hunkydorey in the house, and that the children fight with each other (because they're normal children). That I shout at them (because I'm a normal mum) etc etc.<br>  <br>  I'm a SAHM and I would say that yes, I am wrapped up with my kids (I always wanted kids and am enjoying it before they are at school full time, which comes along far too quickly) but I don't think I'm competitive. I just like to share my experiences to help others. And I like to ask questions as you get lots of different opinions and viewpoints as people answer.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Being a SAHM doesn't mean we're not paying a mortgage! And my children have everything they need too. Whether you work or not doesn't make you a better/worse parent. It's a personal choice, dependent on circumstances.
cfdooGylaa	They put Pitocin in your IV, which will thin the cervix out and cause it to dilate. Good luck!|`|iNBLWIFKaa	They could strip/swipe the membranes to start. This is usually not terribly effective but it works for some and is uncomfortable. The Dr will reach in and "gently" (yeah right!) separate the gestational sack from the cervix. This can only happen if you are already slightly dilated and sometimes it causes the membranes to rupture.<br>  <br>  Next, they can break your water. This usually gets things going. If not, they can give you pitocin. Pitocin is a synthetic form of the hormone called oxytocin. This is the hormone that causes your uterus to contract so giving you pitocin will cause very strong contractions. They will start you on a lower dose and build you up. If you are planning to get an epidural, get it before they give you the pitocin. After they give the pitocin, your contractions may become so uncomfortable that it is difficult to sit still for the epidural. <br>  <br>  Once you start contracting the contractions will open and thin out your cervix. The doctors and nurses call this dilating and effacement, respectively. Once you get to 10cm they will have you push. If something goes wrong and you are not dilating or the baby is stressed, they may consider a c-section. <br>  <br>  Sometimes pitocin can cause very strong contractions and the baby's heart rate drops. If this happens, they will give you oxygen for the baby. Make sure you breathe. It is really easy to forget when you are uncomfortable.|`|ddS7unC2aa	I've been induced 4 times. My doctor used Pitocin to induce labor. All went well and I had a baby in my arms 4-8 hours later.|`|de2a2663fe4b3d02deeeda407aee1db1aa	Pitocin will be put in your iv. It will make your contractions strong and hard. Its till a long process but with the pain meds available today you'll be fine.|`|5MBdJK4Baa	they will give you Pitocin to speed things up|`|kGkUG0fKaa	Well they gave me Pitocin to speed mine up. What a wonderful feeling drug..lol...I was soooooo relaxed!|`|VBlrL1puaa	I was induced with my daughter as well at 39 weeks and they started be on cervadil first which they inserted and when that started working too fast they started me on a drug called Pitocin through my IV. About 4 hours after being induced my doctor broke my water with what looked like a knitting stick then it was smooth sailing from there. Good Luck!|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	My doctor told me he was going to induce me when I was pregnant with my daughter cause it didn't seem like nothing was goin to happen on it's own. But it did happen naturally and I didn't have to be induced. But all their going to do is start the labor. Some meds and mayb break ur water. It'll b ok. But if u dnt want that I would pray that the baby comes on her own. Gd luck and congradulations on ur baby.
d933e4b97b43aa7bfb10ac2da32dceb4aa	I have been there and it just seems like no matter how long you pick, you always find more! It is maddening. <br>  Try these tips which have helped me. Rinse the hair with white vinegar - it really does loosen the "glue" which holds the egg to the hair shaft. <br>  Get one of those green rectangle shaped pot scrubbers and cut it into strips. Use this to scrape the hair from root to tip, it seems to work well to scrape the little buggers off of the hair and gets several in one go. <br>  Work outside in direct sunlight.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|7qAWqNw5aa	try vinegar<br>  <br>  i know that it sounds absurd, but my mam used to use it on my hair, it works magic<br>  all you have to do is wash your hair in vinegar (no water) leave it for an hour or so then wash her hair with water (nothing else)|`|WT56iKwZaa	I feel for you...Have you tried rinsing her hair with vinegar? That seems to loosen the nits and make them easier to get out. Also using a blow dryer while you pick seems to help.<br>  <br>  It just takes time, persistence and patents. Put on a good movie to watch as you do it.<br>  <br>  Another suggestion that I have heard of people doing but I have never been willing to do it is to dye the child's hair.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ciao.co.uk/Boots_Nit_Comb__6859261" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciao.co.uk/Boots_Nit_Comb__68...</a><br>  I have never tried this but have heard about it before.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|jcEtRUVZaa	Believe me they're there.

It drove my mom crazy,too. I had really THICK hair and it was to my bottom. When she couldn't seem to get it all out. We got my hair cut and thinned out. That made it so much easier.Hair grows back. The combs will get the nits it just seems to take forever. [If you don't want to cut her hair just get it cut in long layers and thinned out. Tell the stylist exactly that and why you want to do it.] It WILL work!
oXzHvsBpaa	They are right though newborn can't be spoiled. The world is still new to them and the most comfort that they get is by you holding them. Your smell everything about you calms them down. Hold your baby. Before you know it your baby will be too big and won't want to be held. My son is like that now. He is so independent all he wants to do is play. He gets fussy if I hold him too long. I miss those days.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Newborns cannot be spoiled. They don't have the understanding of that concept:<br>  <br>  "You really can't spoil a newborn. In the first 6 months of life, infants experience hunger, coldness, and other physical discomforts as pressing needs.<br>  <br>  Spoiling depends on the child having an idea about cause and effect: "If I cry and fuss, I can get what I want even if my mother doesn't want to give it to me." Young infants cannot begin to form these kind of ideas about cause and effect. They can, however, learn about basic trust or mistrust."<br>  <br>  Hold your baby for now. At this age comfort and security provided by you IS a need for your baby. Try a sling/carrier if you want your arms free.|`|Sn72zeBhaa	Find a swing that snuggles baby in, or one of those bouncy type chairs.  When I did that it seemed to help free up my arms.  Or get a baby carrier, if you find a good one it can free up your hands for other things and keep the wee one close.  I like the wrap kind, not sure what it was called but looks like an 18 foot long scarf?  It was very secure once I got used to it and I used it a lot.  It does take a few tries to figure it out though.  Most baby stores should have something like it, or should know where you can find it.<br>  I would also try to set him/her down more often, try for a minute or so, pick her up, settle and set her down again.  It might take a lot of persistance on your part and extra tears on hers, but it could be worth it if it does work.<br>  Then maybe try laying close but not touching and just put a hand on her, then a blanket under your hand, then just the blanket...<br>  It is true you can't really spoil a baby, but it is very difficult when you have things to get done.  I am on baby #3, she gets held a lot less than the first two did as I am chasing them all the time.|`|33O7ZTRRaa	I would recommend getting a sling or a carrier.  That way your hands are free, but you are still able to carry your baby and provide him/her that sense of security that he/she needs to feel.  I have a 2 month old...and he is very colicky (cries/screams all the time) and it seems to be more intense when he isn't held.  I just started using a sling with him a few days ago, and it helps a little bit.<br>  You can't spoils babies at this age.  Their minds aren't developed enough to grasp that concepts.  Some babies are more content to lay in their cribs or play yards for a period of time, while other babies need to be close to their parents or caregivers.  Babies really need to feel that sense of security.  I agree that if he/she is crying don't rush to them immediately if you know they have just been fed and changed.  But in most cases, when a baby is crying it is for a reason.  Either they are hungry, wet, sick, tired, or just want to be held.  Sometimes babies get overstimulated and it soothes them to be held and rocked.<br>  Seriously, invest in a sling or carrier.  You won't be sorry.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	Don't cater to her every cry.  If she is fed, changed and healthy the next step is to teach her to self soothe.  You CAN spoil a baby.  People are stupid.  Just let her cry it out for at least 10 minutes at a time?<br>  <br>  You people are all full of crap.  YOU have those super needed never well adjusted children.|`|yB5go5wbaa	mine is the same way - he needs comfort, even if he's not hungry, tired, or has a wet diaper.  get a sling or a carrier so you can get stuff done around the house.  trust me, that's easier than listening to them fuss and cry because you put them down.|`|AA12243380	If you can then I say hold him or her.  I do have to put my baby down a lot, though, because I have toddlers to take care of too and it's hard to wear him and take care of the girls properly and he also doesn't like being worn.  I know, crazy.<br>  <br>  Do you have a swing and a pacifier?  I keep my baby in the swing a lot behind a gate to keep my girls from mauling him when my back is turned.  I hold him when he wants me to, though, and when I'm not doing anything crucial in which I can't hold him.  Can you do the same?  I held my girls a lot when they were babies but I only had them.  They didn't end up spoiled at all.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	My son was the same way - it gets better as they get older.  I had him in a baby Bjorn a lot.  He's only 3.5 months old and has already gotten better.  He still needs to be held a lot - but he's still a baby.  I would go invest in a carrier of some type and wear your baby around.  It saves your arms, back and sanity!!  Good luck.|`|MR9iBgafaa	Mine was exactly the same.  She wanted to be held all the time and wouldn't let me go.  I could barely go to the toilet.<br>  <br>  She's now 5 months and trying to wriggle away all the time, so enjoy it whilst it lasts!  It won't last, believe me, as they become independent quicker than you'll ever know.|`|PeEIuzP5aa	if you are someone house all the time and they pick them up, tell them no you can't do this with my child because i can't put them down at night. try that ok. mine where like that two where i couldn't do anything with.|`|AA11476782	Get a sling/wrap/baby carrier.  Of course a two-month-old wants to be held all the time!|`|TB8Lrd9Waa	yeah my newborn whats to be  up in my arms all the time  . .  .the wee darlings.. xx|`|85vDqn6naa	Hold her, babies need that just don't do it everytime she cries or she will learn to expect it.|`|RiGSq1r6aa	Its good. here they say that children of that age learn to love other people when being held. :)|`|OmJfYPptaa	My 2 month old does to ill be watching these answers. They tell me she is spoiled also!
AA11197832	Yes...It worked for my son.  Im 6 months and have yet to find out this baby's gender but soon I will.  The Gender predictor said "girl" so Im hoping it's right for me again.<br>  It is 90% accurate so they say.  Im a skeptic, but I beleive this is correct.|`|7J3SMZXcaa	it was right for mine...but they also only had a 50% chance of getting it wrong. there is also no way that everyone who conceived on the same day as me and my age had all girls...i think science would've figured that one out by now.|`|DTYHoinVaa	I was soo positive I was having a boy. The calendar said girl and it is a girl. Kinda cool calendar, although obviously the chances of either are pretty good.|`|942758fd1ed500339f1a1e8db65b2d27aa	It was true for my girls but said the new baby should be a girl & he's definitely a boy!|`|MWB04ojXaa	yes, my baby was concieved in july, im 28 years old, it says boy, and my two ultrasounds confirm boy!!!|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Totally wrong. Said Girl but I had a Boy.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Nope, wrong!|`|7rCeCVl2aa	It was for my first but not for my second. The first time it said I would have a boy and I did. The second time it said I would have a girl and I had another boy. =)|`|mRQxlNH5aa	I haven't had a child yet but I checked out my best friend's and my cousin ( who is going to deliver any day now! =D) and they were both right.|`|yCwPxulYaa	It was true for me and has been true for everyone I know!|`|p1gbow1saa	It was wrong for all 3 of my kids|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	I was two for three.|`|8kaDm2D8aa	yup- a girl
WxQFe0GYaa	Leave it alone.  Don't ask.  If they are trying and haven't been successful yet, she will not want to be reminded of the fact that she hasn't succeeded yet.  She also probably wants to keep it secret until she's past the first trimester with people she doesn't know too well.|`|XOtOMncwaa	I would just wait, see if she tells you about it. I have a couple friends from my former work that told me a few months ago that they were trying, I went in the other day, and neither told me they were pregnant, I really wanted to know, but I was afraid that if they were having complications or something I would just ruin their day. So I'm just waiting to see, and of course if they don't tell me then I'm sure I will see a bump or a baby in their arms the next time I see them. I would just wait and see if she offers the info to you!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	What *I* do, preferably when they say they are going to start trying, but it also works when you are just dying to know is say: "I know its not really any of my business (but you said you were trying to get pregnant) and I was just wondering if you were going to tell me right away or if you were going to wait and tell everyone after three months).  I'm just so excited that you are going to have another baby, but I don't want to be a pest."|`|rhPCJfeuaa	Let her take the lead on this one.  If she is, she probably wants to wait to get over the first trimester hump.  If she's not, she's probably already stressed about it and doesn't need to feel pressured that others are "waiting" for her to succeed, LOL!!|`|QQby0Adoaa	How would you feel in her situation?  Would you want someone to ask you how it was going?  <br>  <br>  I would just followup with her, "well, how is the baby making going?"  No seriously, just ask her.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i would def wait until she brings it up.....for same reasons as others have stated....|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I wouldn't call her specifically to ask her. I also wouldn't bring it up if you run in to her unless the conversation starts leaning that way.<br>  <br>  You are right she may want to make a big announcement. It's fun! =)
AiJeS6I1aa	What does the rash look like?  Is it rough and reddish?  Could be a small patch of eczema.  Is it a series of little pustules?  Could be baby acne (called milia).  Is it just red/irritated skin?  Could be contact dermatitis from soaps/creams.<br>  <br>  Tough to tell.  How 'bout a pic?|`|P2hhUsoMaa	If it's goopy in the corner of the eye it may be Pink Eye.  My son had pink eye when he was 3 months old.  Got it from his sister.  His eye wasnt even pink.  Just goopy.|`|3xeJEjMQaa	Child Abuse?
AyG4sZOlaa	Yes...and it is a great posiblity that at 37 weeks you will go in labor so take it easy try to rest up and tell your mom to take your brother to a day care.|`|5I2VSunXaa	You should not be watching your bother if your doctor did not want to work and believe me there no work as stressful as child care. You need to tell your mom to make other arrangements.Especial at 37weeks because you could go in to labor at anytime.|`|QzgkN2LZaa	umm sweatheart it sounds like your mom needs to do something with your little brother before he makes you go into early labor!!|`|My93XR2Maa	yes it will but what going to happen when da baby get hear n how would he react to u when u r with the baby n let him know he need to tel him to stop hitting u b4 he hurt the baby!!!! he need help with his anger. bt Good luck with that|`|syGNA9QZaa	you really dont need to watch him anymore cause stress will cause labor! i had my first child on march 28 2004! good luck girl!|`|fHjSonssaa	I would suggest ignoring him because YES, stress can induce labor for sure.|`|ibeYAlwpaa	YES it can i went 3 weeks early because of stress... My boyfriend and his mom were fighting... and pop my water broke on his bedroom floor.
SEzIkGNiaa	I babysit.  I started around the same age as you, so don't let anyone tell you you are too young.

At home, I print out some coloring pages based on what they like (hannah montana, pooh bear, disney, princesses, sponge bob ect...)<br>  Lots of outdoor activities, going to the park, and for walks.<br>  Movies and Popcorn!<br>  <br>  When you put the kids to bed, be FIRM. <br>  =]|`|TrBoPj92aa	before i had my twins i had a 13yr old look after my daughter aged 8 then i didn't mind the age as Kaila was mature i payed ￡3 an hour <br>  <br>  now the twins are born i don't think she could cope with 6month old twins + a 9yr old so we have a 23yr old for the odd ocasions we do go out we pay her ￡5 an hour<br>  <br>  seeing as your in the middle i'd pay you ￡4 <br>  <br>  when they won't go to bed " racethem" upstairs let them win though|`|CdBxhRcVaa	You could charge anywhere from 5-10 an hour, depending on child amounts.<br>  just play with them, bring your own games so its something different.<br>  and dont just turn on the TV.<br>   make it interesting for them, especially if they're the kind of kids who miss their parents while their gone|`|R4j0DTIUaa	there are some people who charge $10 an hour, but i think this is a little ridiculous.  i would do $5 - $6 an hour, although i really don't know that much about it.  that just sounds reasonable to me.|`|TUkBRvfSaa	About 20 - 30 ...|`|SZjKaYfqaa	It actually depend on your area and how much children your babysitting and the age. Like for an infant you would charge a bit more than a preschooler or a toddler. Although for older children you would charge less because they are easier to take care of. I actually charge about $5-7 an hour. Or you could wait until the end of the time babysitting you could see how tough or easy the kids were so you could figure it out from there.|`|H6ga6hrlaa	It first depends on who it is, if its a family member you may consider doing it for free once in a while or for a cheaper price to gain some experience.  If you are wanting to babysit strictly to make money I'd say with your age and as little experience as you've had probably 5 to 10 dollars an hour.  You should probably say five if there's only one child if there are more you deserve more obviously.  First see how much they are willign to pay you an hour but take no less than five an hour.|`|186AWszkaa	depends on how much you do you should charge $10 an hour <br>  ha its gonna be like on family guy when that girl babysits stewie "mom her and har freinds were smoking marijuana and having sex"|`|OmJfYPptaa	You are to young.

This means you don't usually put the children to bed but if they happen to get up during your stay your follow parents wishes e.g. reading story, not talking to them and putting them straight back to bed! After all your a babysitter not a childminder!!<br>  <br>  I know this sounds harsh but that's how i was told it all and now as a practitioner in the childcare industry i understand a lot clearer!<br>  <br>  Hope i haven't put you off, but may be best to start off looking after siblings or family friends children etc. And don't' expect too much money out of it! after all, all your doing is sitting in someone else's house for the evening and watching t.v and possibly listening to make sure there'ss no patter of playing feet.|`|ERFgFIziaa	No less than $5.00 an hr. (unless its a relative) and if they expect you to watch other kids or their kids friends than it should be more. Also do they expect you to do other chores or things or just play with the kids. find out these things first. <br>  As far as tips for going to bed. Don't get them all excited(rough housing or scary games or movies) and then think they will fall asleep, they won't. Hopefully no caffine and sugar but maybe hot cocoa then have them take their bath(warm water relaxes you) and get in their pj's and read them a fun bedtime story.<br>  Above all do a good job, those kinds of sitters are hard to come by and then you will be the most wanted sitter around and can charge more.

RgEtKVaKaa	Yes, she could get sick. Call your pediatrician.  In the mean time, keep a close eye on her.  Obvious things like fever, vomiting, diarrhea, & jaundice (turning yellow -skin,whites of her eyes). Your pediatrician will tell you what to do.  Poop has a lot of bad bacteria - one reason we wash our hands after changing diaper & using the rest room.  This really is not too funny.  I hope your baby does not get sick.  Good luck to you & her.|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	She could definitely get sick from it. It's full of e.coli and other toxins. I would try calling poison control, they'll let you know what you should do.|`|EeGgovyCaa	That is not funny, she could get very sick. So much bacteria in poo.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	OMG, when I read the title "my baby ate her poo, prety funny story", I was like, how could this be funny?  But I laughed out loud at the image of your little girl saying "mmmm" as she licked poop off her fingers!  <br>  <br>  My son is only 9 months old, so we haven't gotten to that point, yet, but my niece got into her poopy diaper once.  I don't think she ate it, but she smeared it everywhere.  <br>  <br>  She could get sick, of course, but chances are, she'll be ok.|`|dW4DbkCLaa	Yeah, she could get sick. Just watch her and make sure she doesn't get a fever and doesn't seem out of sorts. She might not get sick, you never know in this situation.|`|AA11435162	I think the baby can get pinworms.  Ask your pediatrician.|`|Yyqhbyoiaa	LOL that is funny but sick at the same time.<br>  Yes my 1yr old did this, my 3yr old decided to do poo in herold potty instead of the toilet and I was in the kitchen making lunch and herd my 3yr old yell out "mum Indee is eating my poo" I ran like no tomorrow and pulled her away from it riped her clothes off and put her in the shower. I was nearly throwing up cause she had it on her hands face and I felt so sick from it but she was fine.<br>  I also had to really clean my carpet to cause it was everywhere, yuk.<br>  <br>  I don't think she will get sick at all but just don't let her do it again cause that is gross. Keep an eye on her to make sure she doesn't get sick.<br>  These things do happen.
2yjpDdPzaa	I wouldn't show up empty-handed, but what about making something?  It's more meaningful.  If you can't make a baby blanket, what about a picture frame that has squares cut in the mat for a picture of the baby each month?  Pottery Barn has one I bought, but you could easily recreate that.  Or something else personalized for the baby.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	I don't think you should feel the need to match dollar for dollar what someone else spent on you.

I've never heard of it. Where are you from? <br>  It sounds really cool. I'm from NY btw.<br>  You don't have to buy her another gift maybe just a card? If you do buy another gift maybe you can ask her what she wants she hasn't already gotten.|`|6hVKDNEzaa	I usually buy glassware when I want to buy a meaningful yet affordable gift.<br>  <br>  Why don't you get a nice glass or bowl with the baby's name and date of birth on it? Personal and cheap! It's definitely not a gift that will be thrown away - and maybe a small soft toy for the baby as well.|`|oKWL6JXYaa	It's sad when it has to come down to money - but unfortunately, for most of us, it does.<br>  I'd buy something small and meaningful - just so you have something in hand. No need to go overboard - remember that gifts are meant to be about the thought, not what you spent!!|`|5jT9cO2haa	I think you should buy her something if that is what you feel comfortable with and it is coming from your heart not something you feel forced to do because she got you two gifts or base it on the amount of money she spent on you.
nmu6coapaa	Oooohhhh I cant wait for the summer! We're going to take Caiden swimming and to the zoo. Also we're in the process of buying a new house so we'll be moving in in the summer! My little sisters 18th birthday and my mum and dads 25th wedding anniversary is this summer too so it'll be really busy! I'm so excited now! Nice question! :)|`|UXhFcHCHaa	nope i work too much so we will probably stay home and go swimming. he will be almost a year old so it will be alot of fun for him since he loves to take baths|`|X8i0XqCKaa	My big plans for the summer is giving birth to my baby boy :)|`|AA11878029	not with these economic times haven't had a nice vacation in 3 years !!!|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	day trip to the beach|`|yIyvNjZsaa	My son is getting having a big surgery in exactly one week.  I'm sure we'll be spending the summer trying to get used to what activities he can do with adjustable titanium ribs in his back.<br>  <br>  Hopefully we can get in at least one camping trip!  = )|`|dbd1e999d2db32deb12894e60c629053aa	Going to our beach house in Myrtle Beach. My son is 6 months and has only been twice. I hope to take him 2-3 times this summer. I want him to enjoy the beach as much as I did when I was a child. It is my fav place in the whole world! And just relaxing for the rest of the summer. What about you?|`|fRkX3Gfdaa	Going to Branson, Missouri for the 4th of July weekend.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Not BIG plans. We are planning on taking him to the zoo, though, and we'll be traveling up to see family quite frequently. There was talk about a family reunion for my husband's side of the family in Colorado. That would be nice, but I don't think we'll be able to make it.
g9ScMmFFaa	i never would wake a sleeping baby to feed them unless the doctor recommended that (my 5 lb baby needed to be woken up to eat in the middle of the night sometimes). <br>  <br>  but, yes try to set routines such as bottle, bath and book before bed, no lights on at night, song and snuggles before a nap, little routines like that. tummy time before breakfast and after naptime. the routines will help your child learn what she can expect next and that will help keep their anxiety levels down, especially when someone else cares for them.  <br>  <br>  just make sure that you are still willing and able to be flexible.  there will be plenty of moments where you can't stick to your routine and your child needs to learn that it is okay and that they can cope with changes!<br>  <br>  congrats on your little one!|`|deIzFnV8aa	It is never too early to begin a routine for a baby, as long as you remember that any schedule must be FLEXIBLE and built around the cues you give them.  At 6 weeks, babies are still sleeping based on their biology, as opposed to external cues they recieve. You are welcome to start a nap or bedtime routine now, but you may find that they respond much better to it at about 3 months. HOwever, if you started one previously they will already be familiar with it and probably have an easier time adjusting to a consistent bedtime.<br>  <br>  A way to set a sleeping routine is really just to watch for baby's sleepy signs and make sure they get right off to a nap.  GIving them something to use as sleep cues when they are tired ("now we get a pacifier and sing a lullaby", maybe) will help them settle, though again, this is a more powerful tool after 3 months. White noise will also really help at this age.  If your daughter is going to bed at about the same time, you can feel free to wake her in the morning after 11-12 hours of sleep to reset her day. You will probably find she is natrually waking around the same time. this will lead to her being sleepy for her first nap around the same time (prob after 2 hours), and will lead to a kind of sleeping routine. It is impt to be flexible and follow baby's cues, though. growth spurts, illness, or unusual activities during your day can all affect when baby needs to sleep!<br>  <br>  One "routine" we had almost from the beginning was just the order in which we did things.  Without knowing it, we ended up using the EASY routine suggested in the Baby Whisperer books - I fed DD, then we had an awake active time (more active when she became more interactive around 2 months!), then we would read a book, and then she would go down for a nap when she was tired.  We also started a simple bedtime routine around that time of reading goodnight moon and singing the same songs before she went down for her last nap, which was pretty consistent around 7-8 pm.<br>  <br>  You are welcome to try and wake your daughter at 11 pm to feed her.  You don't need to wake her by this age, as you realize.  At this age I had my husband give DD a bottle at about that time, because as you say, she sleeps a lot longer that way!  She always went right back to sleep after the bottle, so waking her was not a problem.  You will want to see if your daughter accepts being woken or want to play once she is up when you are decideing whether to feed her at 11 or not.  Also, as DD approached 3 months, she would wake, eat an ounce, and sleep again.  Eventually she would just not wake up, so that kind of answered the question abuot whether we should give that feed or not.<br>  A final option is "dream feeding", where you try to nurse/bottle withouth fully waking the baby, since some babies will suck in their sleep.|`|TLjNUJHLaa	My son is 5 weeks and I have him on a schedule. To get him to sleep longer at night I feed him while he sleeps that way he won't wake up. And I also put him to sleep on his stomach, because he sleeps better. During the day when he might take a 30 minute nap every now and then but if he sleep any longer I will wake him. And the swing is a huge distraction from sleep|`|yo9XNz61aa	When my daughter was 6 weeks we did 4oz of formula every 3-4 hrs....we put her to bed at 10 every night in her pack n play with the lights out and she slept until about 2 or 3 and woke up to feed and was back asleep!  You can kind of get on a routine but most babies arent on much of one.  We still do this and shes almost 10weeks now and we use just a little more formula!  We do not wake her up for a bottle b/c she needs her rest and if shes only had a 30 min nap and its about bottle time we let her sleep b/c she may not go back to sleep after that bottle for hours!|`|PeEIuzP5aa	yes it is to early to set up a routine for child i would wait until 6months.
mrA6yUTZaa	i think you made a pretty good choice after all the little boy is not yours meaning the toys do not belong to your family. But then again you should maybe set down a rule that is as follows<br>  " Ask the person the toy belongs to if you can play with it."<br>  or something similar to that.<br>  i hope that helps...:D|`|JtbeH1Mgaa	You should talk to his mother about it.  If he doesn't want to share his toys then he shouldn't bring them.  It isn't very fair to your children and someone needs to teach him about sharing.|`|wXbTNsROaa	In a way its fair but in another way its not. Your doing a good job so far. <br>  I would have them all play go fish, it helps kids work on using their asking skills ( did this when i was little, now alll my friends when they are to afraid to ask somthing i have to do it cause of my pro asking skills.)<br>  Also i would have them play musical toys.. <br>  heres how it works,<br>  1. you collect all the toys and at random pass them out<br>  2. then you explain the rules <br>  Rules (written for them)<br>  - You have to pass the toy your holding to the person sitting next to you.<br>  - You have to share your toys<br>  -when the music stops whatever toy your holding is the toy you get to play with. <br>  3. then chose a fun song that they can all enjoy.<br>  play this one half way through the time

In studies, about 1 in 10 women stopped using IMPLANON? because of bleeding problems. Expect your menstrual periods to be irregular and unpredictable throughout the time you are using IMPLANON?. You may have more bleeding, less bleeding, or no bleeding. The time between periods may vary, and in between periods you may have spotting. Other common side effects reported in women using IMPLANON? during clinical trials include: headache, vaginitis, WEIGHT GAIN, acne, BREAST PAIN, viral infections such as colds, sore throats, sinus infections, or flu-like symptoms, stomach pain, painful periods, mood swings, nervousness or depression, BACK PAIN, NAUSEA, dizziness, pain, and pain at the site of insertion."<br>    <br>  <br>  there is an explanation for most of your problems.. good luck|`|b2K8vZXNaa	you are probably getting your period soon, if your implanon (i dont know what that is exactly) broke then it may have broke recently and you are now experiencing period symptoms, i dont know how the implanon works though.

ml2FDYECaa	You should see a doctor. If you have vision problems, and tired there could be somehting wrong, and not to late to fix. Any weight change can mean something.

Finally I had enough and I went to the doctor, they gave me some iron pills and I was fine, and haven't fainted since then! <br>  When your anemic it means your low on iron, I became anemic because I had my period for 6 months straight, so blood loss can be a reason for being anemic, I also became anemic again after I had my son, but I guess not getting enough iron could also cause you to become anemic. <br>  That really sounds like what is wrong with you. You need to tell your parents that there is something wrong with you, ask them to take you to the doc, so you can have your iron checked.|`|HFKr2vBsaa	Anemic means you don't have enough iron in your system. Red blood cells use iron to grab onto oxygen and move it around in the body.<br>  <br>  It's an easy thing to test for so head to an MD.|`|nIOocQtnaa	Honey, you may have Hypothyroidism. The thyroid gland is a little gland in your neck that controls your metabolism. There are actually two thyroid glands right under your trachea. Hypothyroidism is when your thyroid isn't working and it messes up your metabolism. You often have dizziness, weakness and tiredness , even after a full nights rest, and you MAY experience  vision shifts such as the ones you have been experiencing. I must say though, hypothyroidism is not life threatening for the first few years you have it. But in the long run, you will die within 20-30 years.  The first thing  you need to do to fix this problem, is find a person who specializes in hypothyroidism. Once you have found the right doctor, you need to schedule a appointment to meet them as soon as possible. When you have scheduled your appointment and are being seen by the doctor, he/she will take  blood tests to see just how bad your case is. In the me en time, he / she will just give you pills to burst your metabolism . Usually , the pills will make you more awake  in the day , and you won't feel dizzy or weak or have those annoying vision problems. But, sometimes the pills don't work and you have to have one or both of your thyroids removed. Don't worry, if it comes to that you will just get them removed and go home that day, or depending on how much the doctors want to " Play it safe" you will go home the next day. Heres the best part : You don't have to go to school for a few days! =D . So, my advice is to tell your mother to make an appoinment with a thyroid specialist. If she hears you ask to go to the doctor, she'll know somethings up.
OCk7I8JVaa	I agree with above. However, if you are 4 days late and bleeding now, you probably either ovulated later than you think, or you are having pre-menstrual spotting. Implantation bleeding takes place anywhere from 6-12 dpo, so 4 days after your period is due is a bit late for that.<br>  From what I have noticed on pregnancy charts, some women get a positive HPT as early as 2 days after the implantation dip- so you could start testing at 2 days past your theoretical date of implantation, bearing in mind that, for many women, it takes a while longer to get a positive HPT (usually at least 4 or 5 days past implantation)|`|hfdYg5h3aa	if your four days late and only now experiencing implantation bleeding you need to wait at least another week to get accurate results. after 3 days you hcgs levels will only be at 25ml and almost all pregnancy test even the ones that say 5 days earlier can only read 50 ml and up so you best bet is to wait a week because your hcg levels raise every three days. good luck

bf8lx9gxaa	Most women ovulate 14 days before the day of their period, but it varies from woman to woman. Some women don't get any signs but some of the signs may include; sore breasts, cramps, egg white cervical mucus that is stretchy, basal body temperature goes up .4 to .6, and not very many women get this, but you may have a little bit of bleeding. I hope I could have been of help. And congratulations on your pregnancy. I hope for a safe delivery and a strong, healthy baby.?|`|WIQhh62Zaa	Changes in your cervical mucus, etc.  There are calendars that help you to determine based on the length of your cycle, etc.  I personally can feel when I ovulate.  About 16 days into my cycle I felt a little pinching pain in the morning followed by a cramp in the same spot for the rest of the day and following day.|`|lTkYWiy5aa	I agree with Veggie...what a mean question!|`|7cjqT33Baa	Kind of sounds like you are rubbing it in to others that you got pregnant without even trying.

DNygQdmVaa	The sooner the better, i think at least.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	The test for gestational diabetes isn't done until later.  Of course, at your next appointment you should bring up both issues, but there's no sense in rushing in right now.|`|50lIaC8zaa	If your in the UK you will usually have an appointment with a midwife (i had mine at about 6 weeks and she said they had booked it a bit early) so you will prob have one about 8 or so weeks and she is usually the one who makes a note of any family history and does the first lot of blood tests and stuff. If you are worried though there is no harm in ringing the doctors surgery and speaking to one of the GP's or midwifes.|`|HoonZJMgaa	I wouldn't but if you are terribly worried then go right ahead. The doctor will run many tests on you during your pregnancy to be sure baby is ok. But if something worries you and you have a good doctor, he might test for some things ahead of time. But you shouldn't worry. Think positive and have faith everything will be fine.|`|QLopvWKDaa	You shouldn't need an appointment to update you medical history. <br>  <br>   Just ask to speak to the nurse and give them the info to put in your medical chart and ask if there is anything you should be concerned about- bring it up again at your next appointment- Good Luck!|`|sufom9OKaa	Definitely, if that's your gut feeling I would go with it. You can't be too careful and if you waited and then something went wrong you would only kick yourself.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!!!|`|jcHxLOAXaa	all that will be discuss with your midwife on your first appointment with her she will also check your urine and take bloods. hope this helped.

Oe3zFzRlaa	i stayed home when i was that age. i even had younger siblings than you do. tell your mom to relax, everything will be alright. first tell your mom that you and your brother won't kill each other, and also tell her that DCFS won't investigate unless there's a complaint made to them. if it's just you and your brother i say around 3 hours would be good. and if it's just you i say no more than 4. and if you want to tell your mom that you're ready to stay home alone tell her that you know the rules like:<br>  <br>  1. Don't answer the door<br>  2. If someone asks for them on the phone tell them that they're busy<br>  3. Don't use the stove or any electrical tools<br>  <br>  just basic stuff like that and you should be fine|`|8SjoUQmEaa	I live in Illinois and it's illegal to leave anyone under 12 home alone.|`|6nUprmu5aa	I don't know about the law, but while I think 11 is too old to be babysat, 1 hour should be the maximum. But, in this case, I would let you stay home alone for 2 because there's 2 of you. 11 and 9 should be old enough to control their behavior and not fight. Maybe your mother would be more comfortable if a neighbor is home and can check up on you every now and then?|`|20qqJthkaa	Hi Valerie, <br>  you sound like a very responsible girl. I think all day 6am-10pm ( but not over night ) is perfectly reasonable for someone your age. The police shouldn't have a problem as long as your not forced to baby sit. Make a chart with important numbers and safety tips and I'm sure your mom will be convinced.  Good Luck :)
c55O7jqXaa	She may just be getting enough sleep during the night. That is pretty good to sleep from 8 to 8. My Daughter was up every few hours during the night for those first 3 years and even though she napped during the day I would have rather her not napped and slept thru the night. <br>  <br>  You could try to get her to nap, but then you risk her not sleeping well during the night or start waking up in the middle of the night which I am sure you won't appreciate. I would leave things how they are.|`|rTAvnldfaa	my little boy is 2 and hes stopped napping too, sometimes if we've had a busy morning he'll take a half hour nap but other than that nothing! he goes to bed at 8 but wakes at least once still in the night and is up at 6.30am|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	I know you would like some time during the day but I think you just have to be content with having a baby who sleeps so wonderfully at night.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	My daughter gets 12 at night and still sleeps 2-3 each day. At 22 months she went through a few weeks of unpredictable naps, but I stayed consistent and she is sleeping again like a champ.|`|fRrI0Ufpaa	Give it another 6-12 months and you will be glad that she has stopped napping on her own.<br>  A lot of parents struggle with problems at bedtime when their child is getting too much sleep during the day, so I wouldn't recommend reducing her bedtime hours in order to get her to sleep through the day.<br>  I definitely don't think that it's something that you should worry about, but equally if she has had a particularly busy day and needs a nap, let her.<br>  I was one of the lucky ones, my youngest would still sleep for 2 1/2 hours every day, giving me the afternoon to catch up on everything when my oldest was in nursery!!|`|6SNhg2iwaa	try putting her to bed later then she will either sleep later or take a nap during the day if you wake her at 8am<br>  <br>  basically her age needs 12 hrs of sleep a day whether it's solid or split doesnt matter as long as she gets it <br>  <br>  also maybe more activity for her would help her be tired enough to take a nap even if she has had the 12hrs|`|2bLEXHFEaa	i stopped my daughter from napping because she'd be up at the crack of dawn but if i wanted a break i use to stick her favourite film on which was monsters inc and she use to sit quietly for a good hour and then she'd be exhausted come bedtime after not having had a nap :)|`|CvESLNnkaa	Some children stop napping younger than others.

02829b554b7d7f715d842b3f43335790aa	My son was between 16 and 18 months when we finally weined him off the bottle.  He drank out of a sippy cup too, but in the evening when we read him a story, it was just ritual to have a bottle of milk while we rocked and read.  It was our winding down time.  This is when we snuggled and quieted down before bedtime.  You might give him a little longer to give up on the bottle.  I know there are a lot of people and resources that say you got to do this and that and another thing, but every child is different and no one has got the perfect answer.  If he's not ready to give up the bottle at bedtime just yet, don't force him or yourself to get rid of it just yet.  Good luck to you! :)|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	Weaning off the bottle is something that takes time. If he has to have a bottle before bed and you know he isn't hungry, fill a bottle with water and let him have that.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	I get that you need sleep.  <br>  <br>  Try putting water in his bottle.<br>  <br>  Try giving him a sippy at night.|`|29a2wm7Eaa	In my opinion, give him back the bottle for a little while.  Yes, I know what the books say.  And I'm not saying let him keep the bottle until he goes to college himself.  Both of you need your sleep though, and if he's using a cup during the day you're on your way.  Dilute the milk a bit more every day until he's drinking water in his bottle and after a while his body won't be used to the calories at night and the water won't be worth waking up for.  Then it'll be easier on both of you to take it away.|`|tht0DrHsaa	Just give him a bottle. He is obviously not ready yet.  I wouldn't let him suck on it all night you don't want to rot his teeth but if he needs one to go back to sleep give it to him and as soon as he falls asleep take it away. You will know when he is ready and then you won't have any problems he will be fine with a drink out of a sippy in the night.|`|Ge8xMTgRaa	It`ll take more than one night for him to adjust to not having his bottle. The bottle is his comfort, it`s like you getting used to not sleeping with your favorite pillow, or your sheets...so if you`re going to take his bottle away, do it now and be firm. Of course he`s going to wake up at night more than 5 times, it`s normal. You should comfort him and put him back to sleep. He`ll wake up again, do the same. You`ll have to do this all night probably, but the second night it`ll be less, and the third night less, and the fourth hopefully he`s done, understanding that his crying won`t bring his bottle back. It sounds harsh, and mean, to let him cry for so many nights, but it`s pretty much the only way. If you make him go through this one night, but give him his bottle the next night, on the third night expect the same crying of the first night. So if you`re doing this now, don`t go back. Because that actually hurt him even more.<br>  Believe me, once he understands that bottle is gone, he won`t even remember about it. Kids at this age do not remember this things, he`ll find something else as his comfort. Perhaps you can get him a blanket or a special pillow, and explain to him, like an adult, that this will replace his bottle. He wil not understand your words, but he will understand your actions. Good luck
rdpZrBc9aa	The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy, by Vickie Iovine is GREAT!|`|DutTBV3caa	i've been using "pregnancy" by dr. laura riley, ob/gyn<br>  its really cool. it has a week by week guide with special sections every week like "your baby" "your body" "dieting and exercise" and "common questions" along with other other sections that coincide with what week you're on. <br>  its my first pregnancy and so far this book has actually been really informative and pretty easy to understand.<br>  <br>  ( <a href="http://www.borders.com/online/store/TitleDetail?sku=0696222213" rel="nofollow">http://www.borders.com/online/store/Titl...</a> )|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	Pregnancy journals are often informative books also and are fun to fill out for the baby!|`|gQK9xNU6aa	"what to expect when your expecting" is pretty good!|`|46PSDx1raa	The pregnancy bible is amazing, I didn't care much for 'What to Expect' either and my sister-in-law gave me the pregnancy bible and I swear by it.|`|NFt3h7dHaa	I really like "Belly Laughs" by Jenny McCarthy.<br>  <br>  It's crude and rude, like the author, but it's great and a short read.|`|zSABr7praa	I LOVE "Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy".. it's hilarious and very informative.
OT6vCUU1aa	Wow I hear you momma. I am a few days short of 12 weeks and I am in the same position you are. Nothing helps me. I take 2 tylenol and it doesnt budge. The only comfort I get is from laying down and relaxing. Hopefully it will pass soon for us! Good luck!|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	cold cloth to the forehead, 2 tylenol, and relaxation.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Those may be migraines.  See your doctor right away.  They are AWFUL.  My doctor prescribed anti-nausea suppositories (Phenergan?) for my migraines when I was pregnant.  Only problem is, they put you to sleep.|`|AA11105522	try herbal tea such as Chamomile. you can go to the herbal store and ask what teas are good for headaches during pregnancy. the other gr8 idea is get a cool cloth put it on your head and lay down somewhere dark and quiet for about an 1/2 hour. you should begin to feel better.|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	I just put warm washclothes on my head. My doctor told me to take two tylenol in the morning and two at night for ten days to see if that helped... it did sort of but did not completely cure them. Good luck!|`|QzgkN2LZaa	tylenol #3 you can get it from ur doc|`|oXCo6VX4aa	I hear you!  I had them around the same time during pregnancy.  Knock on wood, they only lasted four weeks or so.  <br>  To deal with them:  Mine went away or at least became bearable when I used a cold rice bag on my forehead.  Tylenol didn't work for me either.  I've heard that heat helps too but I never tried it.  You could also try drinking a lot of water to make sure you're super hydrated.  A little bit of dark chocolate sometimes helps too.   <br>  Good Luck!|`|uu9lGT1waa	This happened to me in my first through mid second trimester. Tylenol is the only thing to take and it DIDN'T work. I'm sorry to say, but you might have to grin and bear it. Thats what I did, and they eventually just stopped one day.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hang in there. Time flys by.|`|WrOvFyBgaa	try the smell of peppermint,  pineapple, or parsley
lTkYWiy5aa	Yep! Checking for CM should be used in conjunction with other methods so you know if you are ovulating.

QUTfeBUpaa	Lower back pain can also be caused from dilation.  I experienced it with my first child. Sharp lower back pains were my only clue. I would definitely check with your doctor. Call the labor and delivery ward if nothing else and talk to a nurse. Get off your feet for a while and rest. Good luck to you and your little one. :)|`|GpR5MI5raa	it sounds like sciatica. sometimes it will help if you lay flat on your back, pull your knees up and put them down to your side. also, if you have some one who will rub it for you, that always helps mine. Have the person rub firmly in cicular motions on your lower spine, right above your butt crack. also, a hot shower and a tylenol will help. If all, that doesnt do it, your doctor my put you on something for it.<br>  good luck, i feel your pain!|`|5MBdJK4Baa	i was feeling like this one day and it was just braxton hicks, it went away after a little while. try some ice wrapped in a towel for about 15 minutes and then switch to heat for about 15 minutes, go back and forth.. you should check with you doc about it also.|`|S6zGdgHPaa	The ice pack is safe, i had to do the same thing. I was also told to sit with a heating pad on my back once in a while if the pain got to great... just as long as it wasn't on direct skin, or get to hot.|`|AyG4sZOlaa	Don't wait till Wednesday go to the hospital, don't take any chances be safe, by the way they can probably give you something to make you feel better...I wish you luck and try taking it easy!|`|59SM8kFIaa	call your doc! you  could be having contractions but most likely not  but call the doc and get check for shier|`|XfaJwdoOaa	Call you doctor today and make sure that they know this is what you are coming in for.  This could be nothing. But sometimes stomach pain can be perceived as back pain by the brain.  The cramping is also something to mention to the doctor.  When ever you have an issue it is ok to tell the nurse over the phone and she will relay it to the doctor.  They may want to see you early.<br>    It doesn't sound like Braxton hicks and I thinks you should call the doctor before going to the hospital unless you are spotting or have abnormal tenderness over your abdomen.  Call your OBGYN they will get back to you today.  If the pain gets worse go to the hospital.
fc3045470b792b9f04d696b7f2f9cd91aa	No|`|JduQHocdaa	If you were using the condom the whole time, on top of your bc,and the condom didn't tear.

Good luck!|`|azE51WGRaa	If you were on birth control pills AND using the condom, then you're almost definetly not pregnant. If you miss your period then that's when you should take a test.

Keep using the condoms.|`|ibeYAlwpaa	i would say no... && kudos to you for being safe|`|syGNA9QZaa	good for you for having sex sex! it looks like you covered all basis so i would say no!

wTNsIqe2aa	Hi! I was just researching this the other night. One interesting thing I found was that if you eat yams your chances of having twins increase. A tribe in Africa had lots of twins and that was one thing they were all doing, eating yams. Why would you be taking meds to help you conceive if you don't have fertility problems? CLOMID is indicated only in patients with demonstrated ovulatory dysfunction. What I read about Clomid and other fertility drugs was that they do increase your chances of hyperovulating (making more than one egg). In nursing school I also learned that women who took fertility drugs were much more likely to have multiples than women who didn't. Most women who have multiples have taken fertility drugs. As far as your chances of getting pregnant soon, you can't really predict how strong his sperm are. You can figure out your ovulation time & have sex 5 days before, during, and one day after ovulation for the best chances of conceiving.|`|4RXrYac9aa	Why are you on clomid if you dont have any problems with conceiving???<br>  I think whoever gave you it should be hung because it can cause cervical cancer and this is a known fact.<br>  My friend used it and within a year had cervical cancer that spread!<br>  She has only months to live now and it was all to do with that drug.<br>  If you dont need it DONT TAKE IT!!!!<br>  <br>  The chances of you having twins is very unlikely unless you have them in your family!|`|bcZSIphUaa	It's not about people judging you, it's about people being concerned with your health.<br>  <br>  Taking clomid when you ovulate normally (i.e. have normal fertility) is dangerous and can be detrimental to your fertility.<br>  <br>  It can hyperstimulate your ovaries, cause ovarian cancer AND lead to spontaneous abortion.<br>  <br>  This is why women that take Clomid for infertility are VERY closely monitored, i.e. almost daily blood tests and ultrasounds. <br>  <br>  There is a also a danger of multiple pregnancy, I'm talking 6 or more! Have you not heard of that STUPID lady who recently gave birth to octuplets? 3 of which are mentally retarted and sick?<br>  <br>  A friend of mine was prescribed clomid for infertility and following an ultrasound (to check for folicles prior to conceiving), they found out she may conceive more than 6 children if they went ahead with it. THis is dangerous and irresponsible so they had to wait another month and halve the dosage.<br>  <br>  It's inconceiable that someone with normal fertility would do something so risky just to increase the chance of having twins.<br>  <br>  So many women have suffered from miscarriages after taking clomid. Try telling these women that you want to try it so you can have twins...why on earth would you want to risk it?<br>  <br>  I have pcos and I've just started taking Clomid. It involves VERY close monitoring and lots of blood tests and ultrasounds. IT's not fun. It makes you feel sick and it's stressful. I would do anything to conceive the natural way, but i'm not blessed with this.|`|G1ZgTqNcaa	If you do not have any fertility problems, why are you using clomid?  Clomid is only used if you are not ovulating on your own.  If you are ovulating there is no need to take clomid, especially since clomid could cause ovarian cancer later in life.  <br>  <br>  with that being said, there is a 10% increased change of having twins while using clomid.
20qqJthkaa	Well, I did something like this once and totally enjoyed it! My sister got much too upset doing it but I loved it! When you go in there, just give it all you got and give the patients all the love you have. Sometimes things will be tough (cancer victims) but if you are a truly kind and willing person, which I'm sure you are, it should come naturally. Just treat the people like your friends with a cold :)|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Patience and Kindness|`|7810472dea4ef476f08e138148939625aa	i dont think you need any..u just need to like helping people. i volunteered at a nursing home when i was 12-13

MLQS5Vkdaa	well......let's see.  She had a baby less than a year after she gave up her first one.  Doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that she was suffering from the loss of her child, and subconsciously became pregnant right away to "replace" her lost child, even though it is not possible to "replace" one child with another.  This is very common in natural parents.  It's not like she is a ****, getting pregnant again after such a huge loss can be something that you are just physically driven to, the pain is THAT intense.  You just want a baby back to fill that empty loss inside of you.    <br>  <br>  Her second child is a result of her first lost one, which you had a hand in.  So, as nice as it is for you to want to help her, I would think she would feel somewhat threatened by you and also not feel comfortable voicing this uncomfortableness directly to you.  After all, she neglected to tell you about the new birth.  <br>  <br>  Not trying to be mean here, it is just my humble opinion.  You need to not make judgments and tell her you will help her however she wishes, and then just back off.  You definitely don't want to undermine her ability to parent inadvertently, and your concern, as nice as it is, may come across to her as something different.  She may even think you want this baby, and history could repeat itself.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	I think I would feel pretty sad in this situation also. Its always a little hurtful when you think you have a good relationship with someone and then they hide something like this from you for whatever the reason (fear of being judged,etc). <br>  <br>  It does sound like she is trying and hopefully being successful at being a mom which is a wonderful thing. <br>  <br>  If it were me I'd offer emotional help/support. She is bound to have many questions and worries over being a mom, most new mom's do. I'd tell her she could call any time with those "mom" questions or worries. Be there when she needs to cry/vent over the dad or just the trials of being a mom. <br>  <br>  You could bring it up casually with something like "so how are you holding up being a new mom? I remember how emotionally/physically draining it was for me. Wonderful but you know..." I'd tell her how proud I was of her and just see what happens. Let her know you want to be there for her and her daughter and hope you can all keep in close contact. <br>  <br>  I hope everything works out for all of you!|`|OLXv3DEAaa	Well, I guess just ask her if she needs any help? IMO it just doesn't really sound like a good/healthy thing for you to be watching the baby regularly or having her stay with you for weeks at a time. Since she kept the pregnancy from you she's probably still having some sort of issues with the adoption/your relationship so I think it may be easier/healthier for her if you offer her resources that don't really directly involve you? At least at this point that might be better, but I guess see how things go when you visit.<br>  <br>  You could look up services in her area- free/cheap GED classes, daycare programs, govt aid, how to get child support ordered from the dad, non profit groups that offer job training or stuff like that in case she is in need of anything. That way if she says something like- 'oh its going to be hard to get my GED now' or whatever, you can tell her about xyz programs that could help her? That way you can help her out some and make things easier but she's not really depending on you for the assistance, if that makes sense.|`|AA12127693	I am sure a shoulder to cry on would be a great first start.  Just ask her if there is anything she needs - if there is a relationship there then it should be easy for her to open up to you.  You could offer to help out with daycare and such - or just be there as a friend.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	Ask her.<br>  <br>  Let her know you're there to help and let her decide what she needs. <br>  <br>  I'm confused as to why you're sad she had a child and why no one knew she was pregnant and had a child til eight months after the child was born.  But again, leave it up to her to tell you if she needs your help. Kudos for keeping his first family a big part of your son's life.|`|MzHwklzKaa	Who says she needs help?<br>  <br>  Have you talked to her?  Maybe she has all the financial aid and child care she needs.  There are some excellent programs out there.  She may have already contacted them, have a good plan and really not need anything.<br>  <br>  I do think it's weird she didn't mention the baby 3 days after giving birth.  I mean, "open and honest" does go both ways.<br>  <br>  Just be sure you aren't being taken advantage of by this woman.  Something seems off.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	I think we might be living in parallel universes.  Our daughter's natural mother has had two children since the adoption.  Even though we also have a fully open adoption we didn't know until after the babies were born.  (We talk, we e-mail, we My Space, but we only see each other about once a year.)<br>  <br>  We didn't know about the last child until she was about six months old.  My daughter was so excited, "I have a baby sister!"  Then came, "Can she live with us?"  Gulp.<br>  <br>  I know my daughter's natural mother goes into quiet mode when there's something she doesn't want to talk about, so I respect her privacy and don't pry.  <br>  <br>  I think you have a point about her worrying about being judged.  I know our daughter's natural mother worried about that in the beginning because we were living very different lifestyles.  But we worked through it.  I learned how to throw my judgmental side out the window, how to listen more closely and how not to give advice when it wasn't asked for.<br>  <br>  What can you do to help you asked.  Be positive, send a baby gift, ask her if your family can meet the baby, ask her if she's OK with the children knowing each other as brother and sister.  Find out what she's comfortable with and respect her wishes.<br>  <br>  But mostly, embrace the new baby as the wonderful miracle she is and start thinking about how you're going to explain it to your son when he gets older.  My daughter is a tween now and we've crossed that bridge, but it has been the most challenging thing we've had to explain to her ... so far.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	Let me start by saying you are a saint, bless you for wanting to help so much!<br>  I would ask her if she wanted to move close to you and offer to help.<br>  She may not want to admit it but she needs you guys.<br>  If she is having trouble, offer to keep the baby until she gets on her feet and finds out what she wants to do or offer to pay daycare like you said.<br>  <br>  They really need to practice safe sex though too, they can't keep having babies if both parties don't agree to it.<br>  <br>  You could just have a heart to heart with her and ask her what she would like you to do, thats all you can do really, just get it all out in the open. She may want you to adopt this one, who knows.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck though, it's a tough one!|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	It is wonderful that you are such a caring person to care for this girl and her new baby. But something is off here, and it bothers me. She is obviously not responsible, and should not be having sex. If you want to help her, buy her condoms. Put her on the pill. If she cannot afford a child,she shold not be enjoying the making of one. Now on that note, it is not your place to ask one word about the new baby. Let her come to you if she chooses. But she should be on her own. That new baby is not your sons sister, she is another child by this girl. You adopted the boy, not her and her new child. Im sorry if I seem so pushy about it, but I just do. I mean no offense whatsoever. It just irritates me that she had the one baby, and gave up, to just have another one with apparently the same boy/man. If she couldnt take care of the first one, whats she gonig to do with the second one? Its wonderful that you got the child you wanted, that is great. But...I guess I dont believe in open adoption. This is one reason why. YOU ARE this boys mother. She is not. She is NOT his parent, you are. You are raising him. Does he call you mom or her? She needs to wise up, if she is old enough to be out there having sex, she needs to suck it up and be aparent, if she wants her GED, she can get it. Its not your responsibilty to take care of her. Put all your care and love into your new son. Let her know if she needs to talk she sure can. But let her live her life.
POs5TeUDaa	never. im 18 and im not letting my self loose on this one, ever!|`|AA10325554	18 legally they can smoke and the parent can't do anything about it but keep telling them that it's so bad for their health.  Parents care they can't help that|`|AA10500537	never give a child permission to smoke.<br>  don;t let them smoke in your house when they leave  and have theur own home then go for it.|`|8NFLpbJAaa	When they hit 18. i.e when they become an adult and are legally not your responsability health wise.|`|m8hgynsoaa	18 is the legal age but I don't think any age is acceptable. Do you want to die of cancer? It is a slow and painful death. Stop smoking you idiot.|`|Nw6DbfCcaa	A kid should be allowed to try smoking as soon as he or she is curious enough about it to ask. This usually occurs between ages 3 and 6.|`|OCZOSIMBaa	if your talking cigs then 18 they can buy them. but really smoking should not be encouraged..|`|rFMRgHTdaa	smoke what?|`|6gthdHpnaa	18. before that it's illegal.
cj7sSPZEaa	That ir referring to the position of the baby, and is no indicator of if the baby will come early or not.  ROA means right occiput anterior, meaning that the baby's head (cephalic) is down, (Occiput) facing the right side of the mother and the front of the mother. (Anterior.)  During an ideal delivery the baby would be occupied anterior.
hUbNKOTsaa	force him to at least try new stuff, but if he soesnt like it..fine. make dinner like you normally do, and if he doesnt clean his plate, no dessert or snacks, he can go hungry. If you try one new thing a night, he is bound to find something he likes, but after you force him to try something and he doesnt like it, dont force him to eat anything, but if he doesnt clean his plate and he still is hungry, thats his problem  he could have eaten his dinner|`|jliowBeLaa	Get foods that he doesn't like but you know his friends like so when they come over you give them both the same food then say to the friend do you want this? ( hold up a kind of food that you know the friend likes but that your son wont try) and then the friend will say yes. Your son will get jealous that the friend is getting more food than him so he will want some even out of wanting more food. <br>  Also i ate very very plain food when i was younger but as i got older i got more and more curious. Also when your son goes over to other children's houses ask him what he ate and cook what he had at the friend's house and it will add to the collection. If you don't know what he ate at the friend's house, then phone the parents and explain the situation, as your son should be polite and eat whatever is put on his plate at the friends house, so he will eat new food at the friend's.<br>  You could also try making them look fun on the plate, like making faces out of them and ask him to help too maybe. Cooking together also gets children trying new foods.<br>  Also you and the rest of your family could start eating new food and saying how nice it is and how plain the food is that he eats. Soon he will get the message. <br>  If this doesn't work then don't worry, as long as he is fit and healthy that's all that matters :)<br>  Good Luck|`|aw0sAmVPaa	My mother knows what you are going through! I was like that from that age 5-18!! All I lived on was cereal, toast, yogurts and junk food, when I was 13 I started eating Pizza and eggs but that was it untill I was 18. I moved into my own house with my partner and I would cook him tea every night...even though I don't like most foods I like to cook, as I was cooking more than when I was at home I started wanting to try what I was cooking, I know eat, chicken, veg, fruit, pasta, sausages! I drove my parents up the wall when I was younger!<br>  <br>  Keep putting new foods on his plate and 1 day he mat just think I like the look/smell of that and try it, and I also think it is a very good idea getting him to help you with the meals<br>  <br>  Heres a site that may help;<br>  <a href="http://www.kidsandcooking.co.uk/PickyEaters.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidsandcooking.co.uk/PickyEat...</a><br>  <br>  Hope that helps and good luck xx|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	If he eats soup my mom used to boil vegetables in chicken broth for awhile until the nutrients seeps into the water then gave us just simple orzos in the broth. but it was just like we ate lots of carrots and whatever other vegetables. i didnt eat much but chicken nuggets and pizza at that age either.|`|1enIWBGnaa	This is what my son did (to his daughters); place a plate of food in front of the child, if child does not finish EVERYTHING on the plate, cover plate and place in fring, next meal, remove plate, heat food up and place in front of child again (with only what was left from previous meal) and if child refuses continue all of the steps until the child finally learns he/she will not get anything else until they finish what's on the plate.  Only water in between meals.  Also, NO bread at meal time - bread is a filler.  After the child finally learns to eat EVERYTHING on their plate, then; demand (at meals) the child begin with the veggies, meats and then the starches (again, another filler).  Now, my grand daughters eat everything and anything.<br>  Remember, YOU are the boss - NOT your son!!!|`|5caec993eac9c99e4343f9ba6a23999caa	make it in a catchy look|`|uCnmYEPBaa	My son is the same way, but I have figured out a way around it.<br>  Plain and simple, if he does not try it, he gets nothing else.<br>  I do this with both my children.  When my husband and I introduce new foods, they must TRY it.  If they try it and decide they don't like it, fine but at least they tried it.<br>  They have realized that some new foods are not that bad.|`|lys5kB9Daa	I dont have kids but this is what my mom did-<br>  Make food look fun- she used to cut a pineapple in half and cut the middle out, then fill the pineapple shell with fruit salad. Me and my brother thought it was some fancy treat so we would get all excited about it, not knowing it was just fruit!<br>  She bought dishes for us that were the shape of fish, and we would only get to use those plates once a week when she made fish. We didnt even care or argue that we were eating fish because we were so excited about using our fish plates! <br>  (Although it was pretty funny when we were about 15 and she finally threw the plates out and we thought we were eating chicken because it was no longer on a fish plate so we couldn't decifer the difference haha)<br>  Or making stuff like "ants on a log" with celery and peanut butter, raisins- anything that has a cool name and lets kids use their hands they will like more.<br>  Good luck!
96HWpdkFaa	You could be if you had unprotected sex. No one can tell you for sure. you need to take a test.|`|NFt3h7dHaa	All your symptoms point to pregnancy, definitely take a test (I'd get a 2 pack if your period isn't officially late yet, take one when your period is due and take the other a few days later if you still haven't started and the first one is negative).<br>  <br>  And pull-out isn't the most effective.  I was with my boyfriend ONE time for ONE minute and when we stopped he wasn't any where near "finished".  We now have a 3-week-old daughter.|`|xBhqifN4aa	maybe your just fat and they are stretch marks :)

It is a pretty name for both genders.<br>  Connor Jayden-  I like the name Connor but to me Jayden doesn't seem right.<br>  Matthew Jayden-  Same as above they don't sound right.<br>  For hayden is there more of a mascular way of spelling it?  To me HaYden with the Y is more femininme. But I guess there is no other way of spelling HaYden without your Y.

zvifDjJQaa	There is this awesome place in our town if you are looking to start a business! It's called polkadot playhouse (salisbury, ma). they have a baby play area, craft table area and a bigger kids area with a jungle gym (the "hamster tubes"). The only draw back is it's $8 per kid and that's a little steep for regular attendance for us. <br>  <br>  They also host birthday parties.<br>  <br>  You could start a mommy and me yoga class. You can get videos for that or take a class (it's in NY) and they certify you. Sing-a-long times, craft play or just a free time. With your background in p/s ed. you should really be able to make it happen.<br>  <br>  Consider a pre-preschool class, too. Kids are so much smarter than we give them credit for! Teach basic shapes and colors and letters. The socialization for the mom's will bring them in!<br>  <br>  Another thought: baby sign language classes. Bright cards and the signs to go with them. THis is a really big thing these days.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I would start a play date group so you can get to know the women in your area and see what they would really like in town. That way you can target what they want, all while building your client base! Just be careful how you approach them about it because if you use one of the ideas they might think that you owe them something for it. Good luck!|`|Ge8xMTgRaa	I think it`s a great idea. This way you`ll meet other moms in your area and start your own business, and who knows, it could grow into something else! You can have play days, and create all kinds of games for the kids and even for the moms to get them involved if they are also stay at home mothers, which I think would be your target.
WT56iKwZaa	I think they are cute and quite alright to wear to school. It is important when kids are taking these high stakes tests that they are comfortable. Teachers understand this and even relax dress codes on these test days. <br>  <br>  I think the pants re cute and acceptable as school clothes. Tell her good luck on the test.|`|BxpGdVTOaa	They are just fine! Many kids (and adults) were pants like that out and about--and it isn't like she needs to dress up for school! <br>  Sides, when you have a test you want to be comfortable!|`|AA11537580	yes, lots of kids wear that type clothing to school, they are like yoga pants.|`|GEsyKBeUaa	those look so comfy..let her wear them..they look just like sweats not exercize pants..<br>  when i first saw the question i though you meant like spandex but then i saw the pics<br>  :]|`|GpdYgi4Zaa	there fine. people wear pjs to wal mart! as long as she is comfortable.|`|QxX1Nz3oaa	yep they're cute|`|7Mc0snS9aa	I always wear sweat pants to school on the days i have big tests, because it helps me concentrate more on the test, then wondering if my underwear is showing.

I think she'll be fine. :)<br>  <br>  Tell her "good luck" for her test!|`|I3yNs4nLaa	I think different schools would be more strict then others, but I see nothing wrong with those, I think they are really cute!|`|zlLhETFtaa	I would wear them to school, they're cute.|`|vGYbRgZDaa	if she is in public school than yes.if private,no.|`|gSsmq3c7aa	i wore full pj's to my final exam once <br>  it's fine in my opinion|`|WOES51svaa	oh yeah. those should be fine. as  long as she is comfortable =)|`|y0e5hG0Saa	yep i think they would be fine
bf8lx9gxaa	It's hard to get a positive that early. I'd wait until the day after your missed period. That way you're not wasting your money. I know it's hard to wait, but if you want a more accurate reading then you should wait until then. I'm really hoping you get pregnant. I know how hard you've been trying.?|`|obN6p3Cgaa	I think so.........|`|lTkYWiy5aa	I don't think the cycle length matters so much since no matter how long your cycle is, women ovulate 2 weeks before their expected period. The best is to wait until you miss your period, because the tests are only 60% accurate 5 days before, as opposed to 97% accurate the day after it's missed.<br>  <br>  This website has everything you need to know about hpts. <br>  www.peeonastick.com
kzyEuRroaa	I say stick with the co-sleeping, until you are settled in a new place.  Too much transition on little one's is stressful, and if you both sleep better with her with you, why change it?  It is not harder whether they are older or younger.  Change is tough on all little babies/kids and everything requires a bit of patience and time.  If you don't mind her co-sleeping, stick with it until she is ready to transition to her own bed, or do it gradually.  This time in your life will be over so fast, why rush it- let her be a baby, you'll miss it eventually!!|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	YES!  A thousand times yes.  That is not a safe place for your baby to be sleeping on your chest.  That is so incredibly dangerous.  Haven't you read any of the numerous times a baby has been smothered or squashed to death from co-sleeping?!?!   Even if you think you don't move, or haven't so far, that doesn't guarantee anything.  Stop it this instant for the safety of your child!<br>  <br>  Fact 1: No infant sleep environment is absolutely risk-free. <br>  <br>  Fact 2: While some babies die in cribs, no baby has ever been smothered to death in a crib by a sleeping parent. <br>  <br>  Fact 3: Co-sleeping with an infant dramatically increases the risk of death since it brings into play an uncontrollable variable; that being a sleeping parent whose nocturnal bed movements create conditions that can lead to infant suffocation. <br>  <br>  Fact 4: Babies do die in co-sleeping arrangements. <br>  <br>  Fact 5: An infant death that results from a co-sleeping arrangement is a needless death and is one-hundred percent preventable. <br>  <br>  Fact 6: The rate of infant deaths in the last twenty years due to parental overlay has increased in direct proportion to the increased popularity of the mother- centered attachment theories, which advocate the practice and claim it to be safe and necessary. <br>  <br>  Fact 7: While the nominal benefits of co-sleeping are only speculative, the risks are real. There is no evidence that suggests that the bonding or breastfeeding benefits derived from a co-sleeping arrangement outweighs the significant risk of a wrongful infant death by suffocation. NONE! To suggest otherwise would be irresponsible.|`|o2H6DEHLaa	there is no need for it, why don't you just lay her by your side by now, and when she has her own space you can move her to the crib.<br>  people overreact on this subject.my son sleep ed in bed with me until he was 1 and when i moved him to his cot he was absolutely fine.<br>  remember, they grow so fast, you will not have a  2nd chance of having her sleeping on your chest again.|`|vuEyUbsgaa	Yeah I would try to do it now because as she gets older it get harder

AA10196172	Assuming this isn't a troll...<br>  <br>  Some couples go months or years without conceiving. The joke is that girls spend their teens worring they are pregnant and their 20's worring why they aren't. Even when all the timing is right, and you are doing full-load deposits in there, odds are probably about 1 in 5 or 6 that a pregnancy will happen that month.<br>  <br>  First, there's timing. Sperm can live in the uterus 2 or 3 days waiting for an egg (maybe 5); if no sperm, the egg dies within a day. So there's maybe a 2 or 3 day window out of about 28 where you have a good chance of getting pregnant. Ovulation usually happens about day 14 or 15 (technically, 14 days before the next period should start) so sex about every 2 days from day 10 to 18 should cover the whole time.<br>  <br>  Sometimes ovulation, like periods can skip or happen at the wrong time. Some women are more irregular than others too. Regular sex can improve your chances.<br>  <br>  Also, sometimes there are difficulties like cervical mucus that is too thick for sperm. Or it's the wrong pH and sperm don't live long, so timing is more critical. Or any one of 1000 reasons. That's why tehre are TTC (trying to Conceive) discussion forums. It's not that quick and simple for a lot of people.<br>  <br>  Just keep trying.|`|AA11220327	5 times is not nearly enough to think that you have trouble getting pregnant. it takes some people years to concieve. With my oldest it took 2 years, my 2nd, a few weeks, and this one 6 months. you deffinitly dont need to worry yet about your ability to concieve.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	you need to figure out when your ovulating then have sex during that time. it may take a few months for it to work out. you can purchase an ovulation kit if you choose too.|`|AA11105522	well, first of all they have tons of stuff you can buy from the drugstore that tells you when you are ovulating so i would think that would be your first step and have sex during the time you are ovulating. if you still arent getting pregnant, keep trying. i know people that have had to try for a year or so before they actually got pregnant. AND hey maybe somebody's trying to tell you that this isn't the right time, guy, etc. but only you would know that. just make sure you know what you're getting yourself into before you take that leap.|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	It takes most couples a year to get pregnant.5 times isnt that much. Also if you arent doing it on the right days then that is the problem too. See what days you ovulation.|`|NNwEuC8paa	5 times is nothing,  are you old enough for a baby because im sorry to say but it doesn't sound like it. It can take up to a year to get pregnant.|`|iTWcRnhJaa	There is no reason to assume you cannot have children - five tries is absolutely nothing compared to how many times other women have to go before they get a positive on the pregnancy test. It can takes months to get it just right - you can do it on the exact minute of the exact day that you ovulate and it could still just may not happen. If it is meant to be, it will happen on its own. I can tell you that obsessing and stressing about conceiving DOES make it more difficult to conceive. You have to really just relax, forget about it, and let nature take its course. All of the times that I have tried to get pregnant, it wouldn't happen. When I finally stopped worrying, calculating, and counting days, I got pregnant by surprise. Relax.|`|ZcounZwZaa	Don't think you can't have children just because you have had no luck conceiving after five times. Me and my husband have been trying for three years and no luck yet. You might be under stress or not ovulation when you are engaging in intercourse with your boyfriend. Getting pregnant is not easy for everyone it takes more time depending on the individual and mother nature.|`|hu1rGSBHaa	Alright, I'm going to try not to sound preachy here (because I certainly am not), but are you sure that this is the right thing to be doing?<br>  <br>  As everyone else has previously stated, it can take up to years to conceive... and even then, you still may not be able to. I'm not trying to scare you, but you may want to go to an ob-gyn and have things checked out. It's good to do that at least once a year anyway.<br>  <br>  Now, I'm not saying it's wrong to get pregnant with someone you're just dating, but are you 110% sure that this guy is right for you and one you want to have to be around and be liable to for the rest of you and a baby's life? It's a HUGE step. This is a person who you're going to have to deal with on probably a daily basis and share a child with. You need to be sure that this is a forever deal.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure how old you are, but judging by the dialect, you may want to do some re-evaluating. Are you still in school? What would your parents think? Does this boyfriend want kids? Do you both have steady incomes and a place to have a family? Have you talked it through? There are millions of questions you need to sit down and talk about.<br>  <br>  If this is something you both want and are ready for, I do wish you all the best and good luck! There are many treatments and plans to help you get pregnant. Just talk to your family doctor or an ob-gyn.|`|de103785bc2af3eaeb12cf72d96e7f9caa	Although some people become pregnant with having sex just once, it tends to be the exception rather than the rule.<br>  <br>  Most couples will become pregnant after 1 year of trying.  "Trying" often means having sex quite often and making sure that the timing is right.  <br>  <br>  It's not like dogs who get pregnant after mating one time.<br>  <br>  You should probably do some research on this.  There are vitamins that you should be taking to reduce the chances of birth defects and life style changes that you need to be making if you are trying to conceive.  It would also be best to make sure that you have money saved up - and possibly a wedding ring on your finger.  (I have had friends who had seemingly loving boyfriends who tried to get their girlfriends pregnant only to head for the hills once the responsibility of fatherhood became a reality.)|`|dR2bqUixaa	A lot of people say that when you try for a baby is won't work and once you stop trying you will conceive. My husband and I tried for 8 months and finally just stopped trying. Once we stopped trying that's when it happened. The only thing that I did was use an online calender to find out what my best ovulation was. Good luck!|`|QzgkN2LZaa	if your trying to get pregnant its not going to work because its something that you want to happen really bad. so just relax and dont worry about it and if its ment to be it will happen!!! plus five times isnt very much!!|`|7fPuUT3Daa	you dont sound old enough to have a child.
7clS7baaaa	You NEED to take your baby to the doctor as soon as you can just to be safe...I have a now 6 mo old baby girl and 1 month ago (at 5mo old) she had the same troubles.  She was diagnosed with having RSV.  there is nothing you could have done to prevent this, a lot of babies this age get it. I was very careful with not taking my baby into the public very often and she still caught it.  I was able to take a breathing machine home to give her breathing treatments every 4 hours.  I did this for about 2 weeks and she is now much much better.  However, the doctor told me that she will have a weak immune system for a few more months.  RSV can kill a child if this goes untreated (their lungs are so tight and they cant get the oxygen they need) so make sure you even suggest for your baby to get tested (all they have to send in is a sample of her buggers from her nose) and my result came back within a few hours.  Even if this is not RSV, just make sure you do whatever you feel in your heart is right so you can get your baby feeling better.....believe me, sick babies feel miserable and make you feel miserable.  Please Please contact me if youd like if your baby does have RSV, I would love to answer your questions and help you....good luck|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	probably RSV (my son had it at 8 months) but honestly at their age nothing to worry to much about unless your child was a preemie...it's basically a cold. Depending on how bad it is the doc may or may not give a nebulizer...Jacob didn't need one. We raised his mattress, used the humidifier and give him vapor baths.

He's fine now.|`|oojO4WAraa	Might be RSV  - lots of babies get that.  they might give him breathing treatments - wave an inhaler infront of his nose so he can breath in the medicine, or they may just give you some prescriptions for him. <br>  <br>  Good luck - hope he is better soon.|`|c24c92b6e2571d7ff8699136760929c3aa	A green runny nose is a sign of infection.

They know say wait till six months, I guess because they are trying to avoid food allergies.  But to be honest with you by my third baby I started at around five months old with cereal, he was ready and hungry for more then his bottle, I believe the babies let you know when they are ready.<br>  I waited for fruits and veggies until six months though.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Jenny|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Yes it does matter.  I wouldn't go so far as to say there is an absolute right answer for every family but for a breastfed baby there is almost never a benefit to starting solids before 6 months and there are many risks.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids..." rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...</a><br>  The following organizations recommend that all babies be exclusively breastfed (no cereal, juice or any other foods) for the first 6 months of life (not the first 4-6 months):<br>  <br>  * World Health Organization<br>  * UNICEF<br>  * US Department of Health & Human Services<br>  * American Academy of Pediatrics<br>  * American Academy of Family Physicians<br>  * American Dietetic Association<br>  * Australian National Health and Medical Research Council<br>  * Royal Australian College of General Practitioners<br>  * Health Canada<br>  <br>  Why Delay Solids?<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/delay-solids.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...</a><br>  # Delaying solids gives baby's digestive system time to mature.<br>  If solids are started before a baby's system is ready to handle them, they are poorly digested and may cause unpleasant reactions (digestive upset, gas, constipation, etc.). Protein digestion is incomplete in infancy. Gastric acid and pepsin are secreted at birth and increase toward adult values over the following 3 to 4 months. The pancreatic enzyme amylase does not reach adequate levels for digestion of starches until around 6 months, and carbohydrate enzymes such as maltase, isomaltase, and sucrase do not reach adult levels until around 7 months. Young infants also have low levels of lipase and bile salts, so fat digestion does not reach adult levels until 6-9 months.<br>  <br>  # Delaying solids decreases the risk of food allergies.<br>  It is well documented that prolonged exclusive breastfeeding results in a lower incidence of food allergies (see Allergy References and Risks of Artificial Feeding). From birth until somewhere between four and six months of age, babies possess what is often referred to as an "open gut." This means that the spaces between the cells of the small intestines will readily allow intact macromolecules, including whole proteins and pathogens, to pass directly into the bloodstream.This is great for your breastfed baby as it allows beneficial antibodies in breastmilk to pass more directly into baby's bloodstream, but it also means that large proteins from other foods (which may predispose baby to allergies) and disease-causing pathogens can pass right through, too. During baby's first 4-6 months, while the gut is still "open," antibodies (sIgA) from breastmilk coat baby's digestive tract and provide passive immunity, reducing the likelihood of illness and allergic reactions before gut closure occurs. Baby starts producing these antibodies on his own at around 6 months, and gut closure should have occurred by this time also. See How Breast Milk Protects Newborns and The Case for the Virgin Gut for more on this subject.<br>  <br>  # Delaying solids helps to protect baby from iron-deficiency anemia.<br>  The introduction of iron supplements and iron-fortified foods, particularly during the first six months, reduces the efficiency of baby's iron absorption. Healthy, full-term infants who are breastfed exclusively for periods of 6-9 months have been shown to maintain normal hemoglobin values and normal iron stores. In one study (Pisacane, 1995), the researchers concluded that babies who were exclusively breastfed for 7 months (and were not give iron supplements or iron-fortified cereals) had significantly higher hemoglobin levels at one year than breastfed babies who received solid foods earlier than seven months. The researchers found no cases of anemia within the first year in babies breastfed exclusively for seven months and concluded that breastfeeding exclusively for seven months reduces the risk of anemia. See Is Iron-Supplementation Necessary? for more information.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/fit18.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/fit18.asp</a><br>  No, you should wait until he is six months old, unless he is not gaining weight and your doctor advises you to start earlier. This subject keeps coming up, and the answer is still the same: the current recommendations (I didn’t make these up) are to wait until six months before starting solids. Starting foods too early can result in digestive or allergy problems later in life. We have learned that the old guidelines of 4 months are just too soon, and I am willing to bet that in ten years we will be recommending later than 6 months. But for now, the six month guideline seems reasonable.

A baby who is struggling to get food into his mouth is probably not quite ready to eat it.<br>  <br>  Pureed baby food is 'unnatural'<br>  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/676279..." rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/676279...</a><br>  She said children should be fed only with breast or formula milk for six months, then weaned onto solids to improve control over how much they ate.<br>  <br>  This could prevent babies becoming picky about food.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  Solids best<br>  <br>  After six months, Mrs Rapley said babies were capable of taking food into their mouths and chewing it.<br>  <br>  Therefore, feeding them pureed food at this time could delay the development of chewing skills.<br>  <br>  Instead, she said, they should be given milk and solid pieces of food which they could chew.<br>  <br>  Mrs Rapley argued that babies fed pureed food had little control over how much food they ate, thus rendering them vulnerable to constipation, and running a risk that they would react by becoming fussy eaters later in life.<br>  <br>  She blamed the food industry for convincing parents that they should give children pureed food.<br>  <br>  She said: "Sound scientific research and government advice now agree that there is no longer any window of a baby's development in which they need something more than milk and less than solids."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintro..." rel="nofollow">http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintro...</a><br>  The babies who participated in the research were allowed to begin at four months. But they were not able to feed themselves before six months. Some of the younger babies picked food up and took it to their mouths; some even chewed it, but none swallowed it. Their own development decided for them when the time was right. Part of the reason for this study was to show (based on a theory of self-feeding) that babies are not ready for solid food before six months. It seems that we have spent all these years working out that six months is the right age and babies have known it all along!<br>  <br>  It seems reasonable to predict that if parents choose to provide babies with the opportunity to pick up and eat solid food from birth they will still not be able to do it until around six months. The principle is the same as putting a newborn baby on the floor to play: he is being provided with the opportunity to walk but will not do so until about one year – because his own development stops him. But: everything depends on the baby being in control. Food must not be put into his mouth for him. Since it is very tempting to do this, it is probably safer to recommend that babies should not be given the opportunity to eat solid food before six months.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintro..." rel="nofollow">http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintro...</a><br>  Many parents worry about babies choking. However, there is good reason to believe that babies are at less risk of choking if they are in control of what goes into their mouth than if they are spoon fed. This is because babies are not capable of intentionally moving food to the back of their throats until after they have learnt to chew. And they do not develop the ability to chew until after they have developed the ability to reach out and grab things. Thus, a very young baby cannot easily put himself at risk because he cannot get the food into his mouth in the first place. On the other hand, the action used to suck food off a spoon tends to take the food straight to the back of the mouth, causing the baby to gag. This means that spoon feeding has its own potential to lead to choking – and makes one wonder about the safety of giving lumpy foods off a spoon.<br>  <br>  Why not cereal?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9646449/page..." rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9646449/page...</a><br>  Take rice cereal, for example. Under conventional American wisdom, it's the best first food. But Butte says iron-rich meat — often one of the last foods American parents introduce — would be a better choice.<br>  <br>  Dr. David Ludwig of Children's Hospital Boston, a specialist in pediatric nutrition, says some studies suggest rice and other highly processed grain cereals actually could be among the worst foods for infants.<br>  <br>  "These foods are in a certain sense no different from adding sugar to formula. They digest very rapidly in the body into sugar, raising blood sugar and insulin levels" and could contribute to later health problems, including obesity, he says.<br>  <br>  The lack of variety in the American approach also could be a problem. Exposing infants to more foods may help them adapt to different foods later, which Ludwig says may be key to getting older children to eat healthier.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids..." rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...</a><br>  Cereal is not at all necessary, particularly the baby cereals.

UIM8X38Oaa	I wouldn't worry about it to much, he will walk when he is ready.<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|AA10120592	My daughter was the opposite, she walked really early but had no interest in talking. Sometimes kids find other things they like doing, and decide they have no time for learning other things. He's a little young to be worried about anything, my youngest didn't walk till she was 13 months, and for a little while after decided crawling was still better. Maybe take him for short "walks" outside. Holding both his hands walk up up and down the driveway, or in the grass. That might make it more fun.|`|50fDeNWXaa	My son just started walking this week. He is 13 1/2 months old. He went from throwing a fit every time I tried to have him walk to throwing a fit every time he feel down from walking.... over night. Give him more time. You will wake up one day and you'll try to have him walk and he will just do it and walk 20 feet before falling. Thats what happened with my son|`|vEv2YwWdaa	First i would contact your doctor.  Bring him in, it is better to be safe then sorry.  Then if you find that he is perfectly able, just let him be.  there is not reason to rush walking, if he feels insecure and you push him you may do more harm then good.  He will walk when he is ready.  Walking to a child can be not only difficult but frightening.  Let him take his time, just make sure you see your doctor to make sure there is no delay there.  Good Luck,|`|1enIWBGnaa	One of my grand daughters had this problem and after a while we all finally realized it was because her mother was making her wear her older sister's old shoes which was too small for her.  Bought shoes the right size and she was up and moving.|`|VmE0jG0Eaa	Get a leash.|`|VBlrL1puaa	Don't enable your son and take away any bouncers/walkers he may have. The more he knows that you will pick him up, the more he will either crawl or cry until you pick him up. He will do it when hes ready and all babys are different, but if he isnt walking by 15 months than i would talk to your pediatrician.|`|uftfUW2Zaa	Get a leash

bw4TMX59aa	I found out I was having my boy at 15 weeks and with my daughter at 17 weeks|`|IuJjYz6gaa	The earliest I've ever hears is 15 weeks.  But remember, the earlier you are told about the sex of the baby the more likely it is to be wrong.|`|uJJPFJoyaa	Between 16-20weeks,  I got mines first done at 18 weeks and they weren't so sure because of certain positions the baby was laying in, I went back on my 28wk and it was defintely certain by then.|`|CIZjK2rAaa	I just found out today at 19 weeks 3 days .  It's a girl!|`|7b2ddd2f8ffad9c0b9a57aea08694331aa	16 weeks is the earliest they can tell. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!<br>  <br>  I find out Friday!!|`|QstEk6PZaa	10 weeks, we did on both of ours and they were both girls.|`|CKnHMYHnaa	I found out at 13 weeks and 3 days.  They have great US machines at the hospital I go to.|`|6cwJi5kxaa	20 weeks is best|`|zEK0yY3Eaa	It depends on whether you have an amniocentesis done, in which case they will be able to find out from the lab testing what the gender is at 13-14 weeks. Unless you're high-risk or an older mom (35+) though, that probably won't be necessary. Most often you find out from an ultrasound done somewhere between 18-20 weeks. I have heard of ultrasound technicians being able to tell the gender in some cases as early as 14-15 weeks, but most OBs like to wait until the fetus is further developed so that the gender definition is more obvious allowing them to determine whether it's a boy or girl with a much higher level of accuracy. (Although mistakes still do occur, of course.)|`|Cx5QtfXXaa	its twenty weeks|`|QSodlfMraa	they say 15 weeks up, i found out at 17 weeks i was having a girl.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	16 weeks <br>  <br>  but you get a better reading at 18-20 weeks|`|FgAPXhVRaa	Actually they can tell as early as 12 weeks, especially if it is a boy. The normal is usually 16-20 weeks and that all depends on how well your baby cooperates. My little girl did not cooperate, so I was not able to find out she was a girl until 18 weeks. Good luck!!! :)|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	With an ultrasound, yes. A new study has shown that they may be able to tell as soon as 13 weeks by looking at the angle of the "genital tuber". Here is the link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.baby2see.com/gender/external_genitals.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.baby2see.com/gender/external_...</a><br>  <br>  If you have genetic testing done (Chorionic Villi Sampling) early on they can tell around 9-11 weeks. With an Amnio they can tell a bit later.|`|Bg6txvxqaa	At 16 weeks it is fairly accurate to say whether it is a boy or a girl!|`|aaZ0cTdCaa	My doctors office doesn't tell people until 17 weeks.
pYm11JqYaa	She should have had a period in January.  If you didn't have sex until Feb, that means she had sex with someone else, or she already skipped a period for some other reason.<br>  <br>  Take a pregnancy test...they aren't that expensive. Many clinics offer them free.|`|feUMAvgLaa	I am not omniscient, and I don't think anyone else is here either. I am sorry your just going to have to wait to find out.|`|CWfGCYYTaa	my spidey senses tell me you're an idiot|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Yes, she CAN be.  But she has to test to know for sure.<br>  <br>  Sex can result in pregnancy, so you had sex, then the possibility of pregnancy is there!|`|4712f79c3b66a688114af1fc7e707671aa	Go buy a pregnancy test and have her use it. Geez, there's no way we can tell if she's pregnant or not. She might just have really oddly placed periods.

Go to the drug store and buy a test take the test to her have her go to the bathroom and pee on the test. Sit the test down on an even surface. wait 3 to 10 min and check for results. Results are no good after 10 minutes. Then if it comes back negative use protection, if you are not smart enough to do that then DO NOT HAVE SEX. <br>  <br>  As far as her eating disorder as long as she isn't doing it now or recently the it wont effect her it really only effects people who do it all the time with out fail and the at that its all up to her body on how it acts.|`|AG4C6fliaa	she needs help and a therapist if she was bolemic that young! and yes, she is totally pregnant, but for gods sake, take a pregnancy test, you idiots! :P|`|kRt9Dq7gaa	How in the world do you think we can tell?<br>  sex=baby<br>  no sex=no baby|`|IqCkjljkaa	only one way to find out... take a test|`|5DWJ0jZ9aa	Go buy a test and have her take it... that will be the only way for you to tell for sure.
x7Hn9HX0aa	i think combining their birthdays is an awesome idea.  how fun it would be to have a king and queen theme.  since it will be three weeks after/before, i would have a small little celebration with a cupcake on the actual day and then tell your son that there will be a big party later.  openning a gift or two on his actual day would be good as well.  i would say, go for it!  and hope you have lots of fun!|`|kRt9Dq7gaa	The children are little so they really won't care.<br>  <br>  As for everyone else I don't think of it to be much of a deal. My birthday is over a holiday and the party was a few weeks later.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I don't think its weird at all!! I think that's a great idea and a really cute theme! Just do something small on his birthday, family dinner and cupcakes or something to celebrate his actual birthday then party hardy for the joint bday!!

a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	You would probably need some kind of letter from your cardiologist stating the nature of your heart problems (sounds like a valve issue.  Not uncommon at all)  and that it would not have an effect on your reasonable life expectancy.  <br>  <br>  It is important to be very upfront about these things.  This sounds like something generally repaired surgically and after that's done, people go on to lead normal lives. <br>  <br>  Generally speaking, single parents can adopt domestically and through foster care.  International adoption requirements depend entirely on the country in question.  Some IA programs allow singles to adopt, others don't.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|BTuFtui3aa	It depends on the seriousness of the problems and the route for adoption you take. Different states, agencies, and countries have different rules for medical clearance.<br>  <br>  If there are reasonable concerns that you will be unable to parent the child to adulthood, it'll probably be a dealbreaker. If it's a more minor problem that can be kept under control and will not interfere with your longevity or ability to be an actively involved parent, you should still be able to adopt, though you might not have the option of every agency or country available. <br>  <br>  If you get medical clearance, I suggest you consider adopting from state foster care, since there are thousands of children waiting for good homes.|`|984c0feac5fcb2b2527360725a42fac5aa	My wife has serious, chronic medical issues and we were able to adopt without much problem.  We were honest about it and could show that her medical issues were being managed through medication, lifestyle, and regular doctor's checkups.  What was important was that we were able to show that we are capable, stable, and caring.|`|hORVMOHKaa	you can definatley adopt if you have heart issues as long as you can take care of yourself and the child! you have to be over 21 and have a homestudy done and prove that you can provide for the child!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Health concerns can be deal breakers depending on the agency.  Some will turn you down you for certain problems.  Just make sure that you offer full disclosure of your issues, and don't try to hide it.|`|rEx5MSdQaa	yeah! that's not a problem|`|MLQS5Vkdaa	Let's see....the rules for adopting:<br>  <br>  You have to be infertile. <br>  You have to be better. <br>  You have to have a thick wallet.<br>  You have to be into fantasy.<br>  You have to be into entitlement.<br>  You have to be insecure.<br>  You have to make your kids grateful.
zSEJC6vZaa	Babies are curious and will get themselves into dangerous situations.  Since your daughter is so mobile, you really ought to keep a close eye on her.  <br>  <br>  That said, I know it's impossible to watch her all the time.  I'd put down a foam mat in her play area that cushions her when she falls.  I would also gate the play area so that she can't get to things that she can climb on.<br>  <br>  Since she fell on her head, make sure to watch for any signs of excessive sleepiness/lethargy, dizziness, vomiting.  Trust your mommy instincts - if something seems off, be sure to contact your pediatrician right away.  If your pediatrician doesn't take call, take her to the ER.  I'd rather err on the side of caution rather than have potential head trauma.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	Babies heads are large in proportion to their bodies and when they bump something its usually their head. Check for bumps and as long as there are no craters in the head, (an indent or bump going inwards) she should be fine. If you are really concerned take her to the doc and tell him you are concerned that she is hitting her head a lot.|`|aytp005Xaa	You really need to keep a close eye on your child.<br>  My son is 9 months old and does occasionally bump his head.. Im sure your child will be fine and will continue to get more bumps and bruises but there are certain things that will prevent it from happening such as playing on a couch! not a smart thing to let a 6 month old do... maybe a 2-3 year old.. but definitly not a 6 month old!!!
O3EtP4vOaa	There is always a chance if you have sex, but you haven't given us enough info to go on.  How long is your cycle? January has nothing to do with it if you had sex in the beginning of the month and then had your period at the end of the month.|`|FLOjzbKEaa	Being pregnant.  Take a test.|`|8XjJzj7Naa	Anytime that you have unprotected sex you have a chance of becoming pregnant. I do not know how long your cycles are so it would be hard to determine if you were ovulating on March 3 or not. So I would have to say its a possibility of pregnancy, simply because you had unprotected sex.|`|IOV6iVGBaa	If you have a 28 day cycle, your probable day to conceive would have been on or around the 5th which is a date you mentioned although it was protected it is always a possiblity... I would advise you to take a test...|`|Npy1kswWaa	It best to use a opk to know when your eggs are due.
O3EtP4vOaa	For the most part, if they are done correctly.  Visit www.peeonastick.com for the stats on each test.|`|FLOjzbKEaa	yes there are accurate.  if you dont have money as you said, try from dollar store.  Many people say the are accurate too.  If not then in any pharmacy or drug store you can find them and the cost is from $8.00|`|vKEYa8aeaa	oh yes very accurate. i got a positive 4 days before my missed period with a test from the dollar tree that costs $1. if you get one from walmart, drug store, etc, they will cost at LEAST 6-10 dollars normally.|`|8XjJzj7Naa	Yes, the store bought tests work accuraretly, but you first must make sure you have missed your period. There are some tests that you can take up to five days before your missed period but they will cost you more around $7-$10.00. I would say the cheapest most effective store bought home pregnancy test can be found at a dollar store for just a dollar. Good Luck and I hope everything works out!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Yes they are accurate.  You can get them at the dollar store (for $1) or ones at Walmart cost up to $10.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	yep they are accurate, its ok to buy the store brand, they are about 7-8 dollars at target/walmart.|`|QFNvYVtyaa	According to reviews, First Response Early Result is the most reliable pregnancy test, delivering the earliest possible results. First Response consistently detected 12.5 mIU of hCG (an early pregnancy hormone) in product… testing, making it the most likely pregnancy test on the market to detect pregnancy on the first day of a missed period (95% of the time in product testing). Plus, reviews say that First Response even detected hCG levels as low as 6.3 and 6.5 mIU, soon after implantation -- even before a missed period. First Response is available in one-, two- and three-strip kits. Experts say that two-strip kits are best, since most women will want to test twice, waiting a week before the second test.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Yes, they are pretty accurate, you can get a false negative, but its not likely.  I had a + when I was 6 days late.  And you can get some that are a $1, I think from some stores.  But most of them are about $10-$20.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)

If its just a swim suit then yes.<br>  <br>  If its a swim diaper then there will be an inner lining that has elastics to keep it tight to the leg, as well as some sort of waterproofing.<br>  <br>  You can buy disposable swim diapers as well.|`|5jqFrtrwaa	You don't have to, but I put a pair of swimming shorts on my son just incase he leaked or worse pooped in the pool ,lol
NTfIJa7zaa	Ask your parents for their thoughts on the situation.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Age is a number. Nothing more. Time and reality are illusions. Ask Einstein.|`|HOdblqIkaa	well considering its kind of illegal i would say theres nothing to be confused about and you should probably get out of that relationship before it ends up badly (like him going to jail) there is a 3 year age limit anything over that is illegal, you guys are at 4 years apart. plus hes over 18 making him a legal adult while you are still a minor so again that is illegal. it would be different if you were 16 and at the age of consent but until you are i would say find someone your age to date.|`|sq9AtIRHaa	Age doesn't define anything in a relationship. If you really truly love him, go for it. My boyfriend & I are 3 years apart and when I was 14 he was 17, and we're still together holding strong.

Good luck!|`|vBahPYJGaa	he can get into alot of trouble for being with you [regardless if you guys plan on having sex or not]] if you're parents decide that they don't like this relationship they can turn him in and he can go to jail branded a pedophile for life.|`|vI6tzF7baa	well thts kinda alright but most guys around 18 and 19 just want sex , blow jobs, want to finger girls,but some of them are very very very sweet and they might like you for you not jsut for sex.|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	He is 18 and will expect sex.

You're underage and until you are 16, 17, or 18 (depending on the state you live in) it is considered rape. If you were to do something such as sex, or if someone even heard a rumor that you may have, he could be arrested and he'll have a record for the rest of his life.

Why would he even be interested in a 14 year old? Shouldn't he be able to find a girl his own age? Sounds like he wants sex to me.

Also scrapbooking can be very fun but you have to take pictures first. Uhh... the most bored i've ever been i was playing dress up dolls via the internet.

kbIkVS0raa	I really feel for you and honestly I wish my daughters father wanted to spend that much time with her but unfortunately he doesn't care enough to. It breaks my heart when father's aren't involved and it breaks my heart more when father's want to be involved and the mother won't let them. You need to file a motion with the courts asap and you don't even need a lawyer for that. Then she will see you are not playing around any longer. Save all emails but at this point I wouldn't contact her anymore let the court contact her and she won't be able to ignore them. Good luck and hang in there|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	My husband was active, involved parent for his first daughter, from the day she was born until the day mom left him, when his daughter was 18 months old.  While they were together, mom would keep daughter up until dad got home from work, because she said that he was the only one who she would sleep for...  Of course, when he did get home, his daughter was either still at mom's mom's house (while mom was home, watching TV) or daughter was in playpen, being ignored.<br>  <br>  When mom left him, she took daughter with her and played the mommy card, played the system & did not allow dad to see their daughter for 6 months straight.  For the first month or so, she would let him see her, if he came over & took them out 'on a date'.  But, after a while, that stopped, too.  <br>  <br>  She hoped that he would get discouraged & disappear.  Or, that he would join in her drama, accusing her of things in return for the things she was accusing him of.<br>  <br>  He didn't. <br>  <br>  He just kept working calmly within the legal system to have custody established.  He then, civilly, stuck to his end of the custody agreement, avoiding arguments with mom at all costs, but definitely avoiding arguments when his daughter was within earshot, ignoring mom until he could speak to her later, if necessary, but mostly just plugging along, being the best parent he could be when his daughter was with him, and the best co-parent possible, given mom's particular issues.  <br>  <br>  Years later, when his daughter was 14, mom pushed things too far - moved daughter out of state without discussing it with him, refusing him any visitation, even if he drove out there. <br>  <br>  So, he took it to court & she lives with us, now. <br>  <br>  Just keep doing what you know is best for your child (not for your own ego, retribution or revenge).  That's really the only way to do it & feel proud of yourself as a human & parent after it's all done.|`|AkFag8tNaa	It's great that you are standing up and being the father (or trying anyway) you're supposed to be. She shouldn't be withholding visitation with or without a court order (unless you were a danger to the baby obviously). Now, let me ask you this: is she nursing? That is something that would likely prohibit you from getting 50/50 at this point (and it should because nursing should be encouraged when and where it can happen).  Good luck and I hope it's not to much of a hassle!|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	you dont even have to have a lawyer for this, all you have to do is go to family court with a parenting plan, take it before the  judge, he will make the decision and put it into writing....if that fails, THEN get a  lawyer and get rough about it....you dont have to be  on the birth certificate if you get a dna test proving the baby is yours. its sickening with as many runaway dads as their is now that some women dont want the ones who WANT to be dads around their own children.|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	Are you on the birth certificate? If so then she can not prohibit you from seeing your child. If you aren't on the birth certificate then the only way to prove your the father is through a DNA test.|`|Iz5tNA5aaa	Good for you for fighting for your rights as a dad!  There needs to be more men like you.  Immediately contact a lawyer and take her to court and sue for shared custody!!  You deserve it!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6h0eCVwpaa	You're a really good dad you should be proud :) And i don't know much about this stuff but i think that it's it enough. Just keep fighting your baby is worth it :) <br>  <br>  Good luck !!!!!|`|CpARO2Fhaa	I think you have every right to push for your rights; I'm glad that you are fighting for your son. I think that you will receive 50/50 rights unless you have done something in your past to makes you seem unfit or unsafe for your baby. Good luck.|`|173kXTiCaa	their should be more guys like you! They should at least let you get him every other week. GOOD LUCK|`|SRsFkNBBaa	you need to go file a suit at the courthouse. you need a lwayer, but if you can't afford it, you can do without one, if you have to. there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to see your child. she is making it difficult becuase she is immature, and doesn't realize the damage it will do to the child , if you are a good person and a decent father. the person who will suffer is the baby, and she needs to realize that. <br>  make sure when you go to court, you keep your mind focused on the child, not your ex. she doesn't matter to you anymore, just the baby and what is best for her. keep a journal of everything that has happend, from the birth, and the phone calls and a copy of the emails you send her. you will have a better chance the more that is written down. when i received custody of my children, it was becuase i had alot of documentation, and the judge told my ex, that if it wasn't on paper , to him, it didn't happen-
02829b554b7d7f715d842b3f43335790aa	As an adult, this is a sexual thing.  As a 6 yr old, it's mostly curiosity and in all honesty, it probably feels good to him.  It was just led on by your sick ex a little too soon in his life.  I wouldn't punish him about it, but just explain that it is inappropriate to do things like that in front of others, etc.  DO get him some counseling though, and DO get a lawyer.  Your ex sounds like he's got some serious issues too and doesn't need to have custody or be around children at all.  That's sexual abuse whether he has touched your son or not!|`|lfMJPZ67aa	You poor girl, I feel so bad for you and your son. First thing I would do is have him assessed by a doctor because I feel your ex has done a lot more than masturbated in front of him. You need to find him help first and then armed with all the evidence from your doctor and child psychologist you need to call the police and have him charged then go to the courts and have his rights to your son stopped for ever, remember that it is not your sons fault but yes it would be very frightening for you. You must get him the help he needs ASAP because at the moment it's stuffed toys and you don't want him turning his attention to his friends or siblings if he has any. I wish you luck and I hope your ex gets what's coming to him he needs to be in prison.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	They always say not to tell them that it is bad or wrong or sick. Basically I would act like it doesn't bother you and talk to a psychologist and see what they suggest.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Punishing him for masturbating will just lead to more problems.<br>  <br>  Don't tell him it's sick or wrong.  And don't punish him.  <br>  <br>  Definitely get him some counseling and get some help for yourself on how to handle this.<br>  <br>  I'm sure that seeing his father masturbate has lead to problems that he needs to get worked out in therapy.<br>  <br>  On a side note, I think I was 5 or 6 when I found out that rubbing myself down there felt good.  I think that eventually kids figure that out and that's totally normal.|`|T6OorlmZaa	If he is doing it again immediately after starting visits back up with his father, I would consult my attorney to go back to court. That's a big bright neon sign!<br>  <br>  Don't punish him. It completely normal for children to masturbate, especially in his case since he has seen his father do it. It is important though that he knows that people aren't supposed to do it in front of others. Him knowing this will prevent him from doing it in public, and also let him know that if he sees anyone else doing it, it's a bad thing and he should come tell you right away.<br>  <br>  Counseling is a very good thing. Not only will he get the healing that he needs, but the counselor can become his voice in court if need be.<br>  <br>  Don't question your son. If he tells you things, only ask open ended questions such as "what happened next". Tell the counselor your concerns, and she can get the information out of him. Otherwise, in court, the father's attorney can claim that you coached your son and/or put the ideas in his head. You want any information that goes to court untainted and fresh.<br>  <br>  Stay strong...there'll be times when you won't know what to do. In those times, just give him a hug and tell him he's safe and loved. Sometimes that's all they need. I wish you all the luck in the world.|`|W6CWymjHaa	The behavior is a sign of mental and emotional stress.  It doesn't necessarily mean that he is witnessing anything inappropriate today, though you should be concerned because there is such history, but it does mean he is stressed and seeking an outlet.  I'm all for punishing inappropriate behavior under ordinary circumstances, but in this case, the behavior is only a symptom.  Don't think of it as masturbation so much as the message "mom, please help me" emanating directly from his unconscious.  If you suppress the symptom, the stress will have to emerge some other way, which could be more destructive, and you might lose a valuable diagnostic opportunity.  (He has done it less in the past when his life is calmer.  You'll know things are better again when he does it less again.)  A child psychologist is probably a great idea.  [Having said all that, asking him to stop inappropriate behavior in a gentle way, and being a good sport about it, will make him feel safe and loved, and subconsciously it will signal to him that you've received the message.]
SiomJ10Saa	Actually it's normal and okay for kids to do this. .<br>  <br>  but it is NOT normal for your ex to be doing this in front of him.. that's weird.<br>  <br>  you would be better off explaining to him that it's private, and only he can touch himself there. etc.<br>  <br>  don't try to necessarily stop it.. just make sure it is a private act.<br>  <br>  I would suggest maybe taking him to a psychiatrist to get to the root of where this is coming from .. he may be more open talking to a trained professional rather than his mother|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	soo its his way of relieving stress..let him be alone.<br>  Punishing is really F'd up<br>  you need to grow up and know people masturbate|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Dont punish your child for doing that, its not his fault. File charges against your ex for child sexual abuse and yes it is sexual abuse, he was exposing his genitals to his child and preforming a sexual act, the same as if he were showing him porn. He needs to be put in jail and away from your son. Get him to a shrink ASAP and maybe talk to a lawer for advice on how to aproach the poliece and definitly file charges|`|B8R5wW66aa	This is a very unusual and unfortunate problem. It's a problem because at 6 years old, a child hasn't even begun to develop sexually aside from developing gender roles. He is acting on sensations that he doesn't have the mental capacity to understand yet.This is definitely a matter for a child psychologist; punishing your child yourself may only confuse him more.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	You CANNOT. I repeat you cannot punish a child for this!!! He was taught this by your ex husband. And you are doing more damage to him by making him feel bad for this.  <br>  He should see a children's therapist.<br>  But if you continue to handle things this way,it could very well ruin sex for him as an adult.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Your son needs to hear than touching himself and getting to know his body is perfectly normal and okay for him to do- in private either in the bathroom or in his bedroom. Tell him about how special those body parts are and that it's okay for him to touch them and sometimes mommies might need to help him in the bath or at the toilet and a doctor may need to examine him to make sure he's healthy, but other than that his privates are his and he's the only one who has the right to touch them. Masturbation is normal and healthy in children (and adults) you shouldn't be telling him he's bad or punishing him for doing it.|`|Rx31LHjbaa	I don't think punishing him is a good idea.  You don't want him to have the idea from childhood that sexuality is bad.  I would definitely say to have him see a child psychologist, because he is most likely confused about the appropriateness of masturbation due to what went on with his father.  At his age he probably doesn't even realize it's a sexual thing, just something that feels good.  Honestly, this is a tough one and probably best left to professionals for advise.|`|6nUprmu5aa	Children who have not been sexually abused(and yes, what your ex did was sexual abuse), do this. It's a normal thing and you don't want him to feel ashamed about his body. How can you look at it as sexual? He's 6 years old and all he knows is that when he does this it feels good to him. Any child shrink will tell you this normal. Just explain to him about not doing it in public.|`|GrbcICzMaa	well i think you should talk to your son about sex and why that is wrong until he is 40 at least thats what my mom did and when he hears he will trust you, believe me...|`|239u7iAgaa	You answered your own question, a child psychiatrist should be consulted. I think punishing is not the right way to go.|`|E0SJx3Csaa	your ex is committing a child sex crime. he needs to be put in jail. <br>  <br>  first thing i would do is find a way to catch him red handed, there has to be someway to catch him on tape. there are all sorts of video recorders that look like buttons , that fit in jackets, shoes, clothes ETC. if you have the balls then sneak into his house and set one up ...<br>  <br>  the problem is proving this, there are so many parents who make up false stories to get child services to prohibit visits that when there is a REAL problem they don believe it..<br>  <br>  also try and catch your son on tape because they will know something is wrong when they see a 6 yr old doing that.<br>  <br>  don't give up
wWkfASTNaa	Some people experience symptoms very early, but other people (me) have no symptoms whatsoever. I am 6 weeks and dont have sore breasts, am not nauseous, I am a little tired and hungry but thats it.

6YLOrGCdaa	Like many names (Riley, Cody, Morgan, Shelby, Taylor, etc.) it started as a boy name, and is now more commonly used as a girl's name.<br>  The only boy Haley I can think of is Haley Joel Osment - a D-list celebrity who starred in "Secondhand Lions" (great movie, btw!) and is the big brother of Emily Osment, who was in Spy Kids 2 and is better known for playing Lily on Hannah Montannah. Haley Joel has been in something else, too, but I can't think of it right now.<br>  So, with the way things are going, I'd use it as a girl's name!|`|NRa5MJ3Paa	Its a girl name.... please dont name your boy "Haley"|`|D0y3MwDcaa	GiRL(:  <br>  <br>  very cute spelled as Hayleigh(:|`|GvamTVqAaa	girl for sure|`|pda2fjxkaa	A girls name.

Lots of people don't do this, and their kids get the mickey taken out of them at school because their initials form silly or rude words.<br>  <br>  Choose names that people can spell when they hear them.

(Life's too short & phone bills are too high to waste time answering that question for the rest of your life).<br>  <br>  If you DO choose an unusual first name, then give the child a classic second name; that way, they can use another name when they are older if they wish to, without having to change their name by deed poll.|`|PPyMhRJAaa	BOYS - Marcus, Ethan, Nathan, Harley, Dominic, Evan, Conrad, Curtis, Calvin, Lewis, Mitchell, Connor, Keiron, Blake, Blair, Travis, Harrison, Ivan, Marshall, Mason, Xander, Lucas.<br>  <br>  GIRLS - Valentina, Angel, Eva, Eve, Olivia, Yasmin, Amber, Sophia, Eden, Stella, Jade, Kiera, Sky, Summer, Caprice, Violet, Crystal, Macey, Madison, Vienna, Dionne, Hannah, Nadia, Harmony.|`|dnGJ5JLgaa	GIRL:<br>  Aleah Grace - <3<br>  Carmen Tara<br>  Savannah Rose<br>  Kinsley Giselle - <3<br>  Emma Kate<br>  Blair Sophia- <3<br>  Whitney Hunter<br>  Olivia Kimberly - <3<br>  Jessa Laine - <3<br>  Isla Cayde<br>  <br>  BOY:<br>  Benjamin<br>  <br>  GIRL:<br>  Isla Cayde<br>  Tessa Khloe<br>  Lydia Elisabeth<br>  Ava Raine<br>  Ella Blake<br>  Sydney Danielle<br>  Alyson Jane<br>  Sophie Abigail<br>  Casey Jade<br>  Isabella Gratia<br>  Ella Chase<br>  Rose Noelle<br>  Reese Makenzie<br>  Mallory Kate<br>  Alexis Finley<br>  <br>  BOY:<br>  Eliot Shane<br>  Riley Cole<br>  Kyle Gage<br>  Hayden Denver<br>  Ethan Chase<br>  Benjamin Parker<br>  Payton Parker <br>  Noah Skylar<br>  Liam Samuel<br>  Lewis Briar <br>  <br>  <br>  those are my favorites<br>  hope i helped!<br>  good luck<3|`|JU351q6Naa	Girl:<br>  Alexis<br>  Leah<br>  Isabella<br>  Ava <br>  Kayla<br>  Kayley<br>  Caitlin<br>  Kaitlin<br>  Amelie<br>  Amelia<br>  Jessica<br>  Zahara<br>  Demi-Leigh<br>  Danielle<br>  Emma<br>  Alyssa<br>  Violet<br>  Jasmine<br>  Anna<br>  Keira<br>  Maya<br>  Lyla<br>  Lillian<br>  Liliana<br>  Lilly<br>  Norah<br>  Ruby<br>  <br>  Boy:<br>  Aidan<br>  Noah<br>  Caleb<br>  Joel<br>  Collin<br>  Maddox<br>  Max<br>  Paxton<br>  Joseph<br>  Mason<br>  Issac<br>  Cole<br>  Aaron<br>  Liam<br>  Knox<br>  Levi<br>  Leon<br>  Kai|`|D0y3MwDcaa	My favorite girls names are...<br>  Isabella Ranae<br>  Elizabeth Emriee<br>  Rayleigh Alisyn<br>  <br>  My favorite boys names are...<br>  Uriah James<br>  Isaiah Kaleb<br>  Elijah Luke|`|w3ob12X6aa	girl- maleigha, lalia , kayleigh, jazzmyn<br>  boy- cayden, maddox, brody|`|iMaTMWMxaa	perginate?|`|q8gR0k7Taa	Well for a girl i like alliyah and for a boy i like brycen which is my sons name(:|`|7DCxBJQMaa	my mom is having a baby to and we have no clue what to name it but here are some names we found and some with middle names hope this helps you, and congratulations on becoming an aunt!<br>  Kristen Elena<br>  Elena Danielle<br>  Zoey Raine<br>  Emme Claire<br>  Emme Grace<br>  Allie Marie<br>  Taylor Marie<br>  Kirsta Lynne<br>  <br>  Tyler Ryan<br>  Hunter Kyle<br>  Alexander Trent<br>  Trent Ryan<br>  Trent Skyler<br>  Cody James<br>  Tyler John<br>  also my name Madison Raine<br>  but we call me Maddie Rae for short i love it!:)|`|RNdowYxeaa	Noelle is a Pretty name!!

QQby0Adoaa	Don't quit, of course punishment is required and you know your son better than anyone.  And don't give in, you feel that he needs to talk to the friend, so stick with it.  But did you consider the friend needs to talk to him also, maybe get with the other parents. <br>  <br>  Also, he is 7 years old, you need to get down on his level.  At 7 the world revolves around me, I don't see much outside my world, how can you show me what is the right thing to do.  <br>  <br>  Where did he get the idea that punching is a way to solve the problem?<br>  <br>  You'll do fine, you know what is right.<br>  <br>  Good Job|`|NbmTLAK5aa	hes just a kid they fight<br>  maybe something is botherin him<br>  hes a kid so he prbly dosnt think its that of a big deal<br>  take his mind off of it<br>  take him out try not to make it like your awarding him for doing bad though.|`|jqOpIu5zaa	ground him. take away his tv or dont let him have friends over for a month. make him know that it is wrong|`|prqrQcd1aa	First you have my daughter's name!

One poster has a good idea.  Demonstrate to your son that physical violence is not the answer by spanking him at the age of seven.  THAT isn't physical  violence?<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, maybe you can punch HIM around a bit instead.|`|7aCH91ISaa	Explain to him that until he can see that he shouldn't hit his friends, don't let him have anyone over. Right now he is just making excuses. You saw him push the friend first, so don't let him get away with claiming his friend started it.|`|CvWp7PZ2aa	Ground him|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	Take harsher measures next time. Spank him when you see him do it and ground him. If he says "he started it"or "I didn't mean to. "Just say I don't want to hear it and ground him. Make sure he KNOWS that his behavior is very unacceptable. If he thinks he can get away with things with just a slap on the hand he will do it again and try to see how far he can go before he is severely punished. You should take harsher measurements at the very beginning.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  People you are idiots. Saying they are just kids, they fight, its normal ect. My cousin started out the same way and HIS parents did the exact same thing. They let it be and just said he is just being a kid. He ended up growing up to be a very very violent person, his own mother is terrified of him. Its so sad. If she had just corrected his behavior he would not be such a violent and disturbed person. Right now he is in prison for attempt of murder.|`|CTE2eRgZaa	Explain that violence shouldn't occur unless you need to defend yourself.  It shouldn't happen as an attack or retaliation.  It doesn't matter who started it or who meant to do what or how he was feeling, your son was the one who escalated it.  <br>  <br>  You should have punished him right then and there.  He became a bully, and instead of making him do something right then, you let this become a battle between the two of you.  I would have marched into the yard, and made him apologize.  Then write an apology once his friends had gone home.  <br>  <br>  You're being very touchy feely about this.  Sit his *** down and make him write he's sorry and no TV until then.  What would you happen if you got into an argument and hit someone at work?  You'd be fired.  This is no less serious.<br>  <br>  If this happens often, where your son escalates things to a physical level, take him to a therapist to help him find other outlets for anger.

Also I am living proof that mixed people might not always take after the really dark parent<br>  <br>  here is a picture of me with my mother as a baby (yes i'm the little white girl with green eyes on the black lady's lap! that black lady is my mother.) <br>  <a href="http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y22/mirandafacette/?action=view&current=miranda4bday.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y22/mir...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y22/mirandafacette/mirandaage1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y22/mir...</a><br>  <br>  This is me now (the guy is a my friend, we're at the top of a tower in San Fransisco)<br>  <a href="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y22/mirandafacette/000_1117.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y22/mir...</a><br>  (notice in the pic my friend and I have the same skin color he is 100% white and a decent of Nazi granparents yet I have the same skin color as him) <br>  See, show him those pictures let him know that not all mixed people have dark skin, genetics don't always workout that way.<br>  <br>  Edit: by the way my father was not even white I got recessive genes from my Scottish Ancestors 2 generations before|`|AA11476782	My daughter is biracial (black & white).  Her dad has a very dark complexion and she was very pale when she was born.  People thought she just looked white.  Once she was a couple of months old, her complexion changed to a gorgeous tan... Anyway, most babies are born lighter than they will be, even if they are not biracial.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i157.photobucket.com/albums/t42/jennifermay2979/100_1119.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i157.photobucket.com/albums/t42/j...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i157.photobucket.com/albums/t42/jennifermay2979/Kayla2-18-09015.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i157.photobucket.com/albums/t42/j...</a>|`|3K7ffKn2aa	why would you hate for it to come to a dna test? if you know it's his then it should be no problem. if he choses not to believe it there is nothing you can do.|`|JXB5pI7Aaa	Short of a paternity test, nothing you say will convince him if he's got it in his head the baby isn't his.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Get a DNA test.|`|AA10458750	UGHHH your babydaddy makes me mad! He reminds me of  mine what a jerk. He's very ignorant too bc mixed babies take complexion, eye color and hair from both people. My friend's baby's dad is the Akon dark and their baby is light skinned with hazel eyes. I def understand why you don't want to do the DNA test, it makes you look liek you were sleeping around and it's embarssing....but....obviosuly you will have to for for your babydaddy to grow up and man up to his child .Sorry for your situation girl, but you aren't the only one goign through it! And don't worry aobut what he says, YOU know you aren't out there like that.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Because you are white and the father is black, there will still be a chance that the baby is fair skinned.  If he doesn't realize that, then he's just plain ignorant.  There's really not much more to it than that.  If he doesn't believe that the baby is his, then the ONLY thing you can do to prove it to him is take a test.  Since you know for a fact that its his, it shouldn't be a huge deal.  Just disheartening that he doesn't trust you.  That's another big problem too of course.  There are obvious trust issues here that the two of you seriously need to work out.|`|vuEyUbsgaa	Explain this to him. If you're white and hes black your baby isnt gonna come out a fairly dark baby. The baby will be a mix between white and black so how can he or she come out a dark baby? the baby will be Possibly light dark skinned or tanned. Otherwise if he doesnt believe you the only option is to take a paternity test. It would be worth it to prove that he is the father of your baby but paternity tests can be pricey. You could go on the Maury show I heard they do it for free|`|AiJeS6I1aa	Doesn't sound like a very good relationship if there is always a trust issue on the back burner... whether it stems from his jealousy alone or a reason why he has come to not trust you.  Either way, this is unhealthy.  A baby stresses even the best of relationships, so... good luck.|`|c73QkZ2haa	Honestly if he has doubts even when you tell him nothing has happened your probably going to have to have a paternity test done if he doesnt think its his when its born....Doesnt the other guy like back you up saying nothing happened maybe that might help?|`|hORVMOHKaa	well most mixed babies are born pretty light skinned. My friends baby's daddy was really dark and she was really white and now at 8 months their baby is a light brown. If he wont trust you get a DNA test done.<br>  <br>  Good luck and Congrats|`|7soHHu4qaa	Get A DNA test|`|9QVjNaIPaa	im sorry but if my man was accusing me of cheating on him and getting pregnant by another guy, id leave him. that is a major insult to me and i would not be feeling sorry in that situation. id be damned going through my entire pregnancy without him fully by my side, accusing me of that crap and still with me. he cant have it both ways. if he has trust issues then that is his bad. he can have a test done to prove it but hed better do something major to try and make it up to me. it doesn't really matter if you 'prove' to him that your baby can be light skinned and still be his, he will always have that doubt in his mind until a test is done so that's what you need to do. dont let his insecurities make you feel bad.|`|txv7TIgiaa	my boyfriend is also very dark and i am white are daughter came out very light with straight black hair...after i washed her hair for the first time it curled right up...and now that she is older her skin has darkened but she is still very light her father has never denied her...i say just get a paternity test to prove him wrong if you know she is his what does it hurt to take the test you already know what the results are...good luck...<br>  <a href="http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=288339486&albumID=0&imageID=10697029" rel="nofollow">http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...</a>|`|uGqYoZNEaa	First off, your baby could turn out white with blue eyes.  IF he doesn't beleive it get a DNA test and prove it. Our friends are an interracial couple, he's really dark, matter of fact looks like the guy in your avatar, and she is blonde and blue eyed.  The oldest two are light-skinned, curly hair and brown eyes.  The baby is white with straight hair and blue eyes.  It's in the make up.  <br>  <br>  HOnestly, stop stressing, especially if YOU know that you've been faithful, everything will fall in its place as it should.  Don't explain yourself anymore than that.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Bring all of this up casually. Go shopping for a coming home from the hospital outfit and be like "Hm, I heard most babies are born really light. Do you think this outfit would look ok?"<br>  <br>  A paternity test isn't a huge deal. If it would give him peace of mind let it happen. Just keep in mind if you guys aren't married and you were on medicaid or any kind of govt assistance they will slap child support on him instantly after a paternity test so he can pay the state back for part of the prenatal care.|`|Sn72zeBhaa	My hubby felt that way when we had our first. (not married yet at that time)  Both of us are white, so that was not our issue.<br>  <br>  I told him very flatly that if he didn't choose to believe it, that was fine.  I did not do anything with any one else and he should be smarter than that.  I gave him the ultimatum really, I told him I would agree to paternity testing, no worries, but I would not stay with him either.  If we don't have trust, we don't have a relationship.  I didn't want my baby growing up like that, I would not be comfortable with my man, knowing that he pushed it that far. Maybe he had a right to a test, but really, I was offended.  We have been 13 years now and I have never cheated on him.<br>  At the end of it all, it was just the easiest way for him to keep the commitment of a child away longer.  He has no doubts now, but then he thought he might be "stuck" with me, or not a strong parent.<br>  <br>  He's a great dad.  He just got scared and handled it poorly.<br>  <br>  Maybe your man has some other issues too?|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	lol I was JUST going to tell you about that Baby Story. <br>  <br>  Babies who are going to be "colored" are usually born light and darken as the grow older. But just get a paternity test to ease his mind and then you'll have your answer and he'll feel like an a$$|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	There's obviously a deeper trust issue here that needs to be addressed.  There is a reason he thinks you slept with his friend -which may be nothing to do with your behaviour but with something in his past.  Its time he got past it.|`|GYoNyoWtaa	Honestly there is nothing you can do to have actual proof in your hands until the baby is born and then you can get a DNA test.|`|01vMpHkWaa	holy crap im having this problem right now<br>  <br>  my boyfriend acts like diego is his and he is pretty sure he is (diego is his mini me...but my boyfriend cant see it for some reason)<br>  and my boyfriend thinks i might have had sex with someone else because he cant remember the day we had sex and conieved diego<br>  <br>  i remember it clearly because i was on my period and it was DISGUSTING...sorry if TMI<br>  <br>  and i am more then 110% positive diego is his. DIEGO HAS EVERY FEATURE MY BOYFRIEND HAS! and it hurts my feelings so bad to think my bf has even a little doubt<br>  <br>  which is understandable though because his trust issues. when  i was at the end of pregnancy he thought i was going out and having sex when i could barley have sex with him (huge belly..remember i was carrying a almost 9lb baby lol and also cervix was dilating)<br>  <br>  with you bf i dont think he is trying to throw away the responsibility its just the fact that he isnt carrying the baby so its easy for him to say "well are you SURE?"<br>  <br>  sadly for me and my bf it came down to the paternity test just so i could get him to leave me alone (and make him look stupid)<br>  <br>  we ordered one on the internet and it should be here soon :/<br>  and now i have this fear that it will be a faulty test and my bf will think diego isnt his and he wont believe the test is a dud.<br>  <br>  guys are sensative even though they try not to show it and they are just scared that the person they love has betrayed them. women go through this too but in different ways<br>  <br>  either your bf will get over it or it will come down to what me and my bf are doing<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and if anyone is telling you this is going to cause you to break up..then dont listen to them. if you want the relationship to work and you try your best, then it will work<br>  <br>  i told my dad that my bf was saying diego doesnt look like him and my dad also flipped out. i had to explain to my dad things he probably still doesnt understand because he doesnt understand my bf. but i do<br>  <br>  <br>  so overall, be careful who you tell this too, alot of people will convince you he is trying to back out of his responsibility<br>  <br>  good luck and if you ever need me <br>  email @<br>  ashley040508@yahoo.com
oXzHvsBpaa	Hun I have been though this but at the time I didn't have a baby. I put up with it for almost 2 years. He had a horrible temper would yell and scream at me and make me feel like I was the worst person alive. He also hit me on a few ocasuns. It started about 2 months into the relationship. it took a lot of support from friends ( my family never knew about this ) but I finally left one day and ended the relationship. <br>  <br>  If he is hitting you that is wrong. What where to happen if he lost his temper on your baby? I would leave if you can. It is not worth it. Everyday you are putting your life at stake.<br>  <br>  Change is hard. I found out with my ex that I was no the first person that he hit. He has to WANT to change. He needs to seek someone to help him. I know how hard it can be.<br>  <br>  My father abused my mother for over 20 years. She finally left. Though it drove her to drink because she always felt that she was at falt. It was for the better. There was at one point that my father went to hit me for some reason when I was a baby and my mother instead took the blow.<br>  <br>  If you need to talk then feel free to contact me|`|ZusC87WBaa	You know, you can talk him up all you want, but after reading "he has even hit me in the face numerous times", nothing else you say matters.  Have you considered that maybe you are letting your daughter down by staying with him?  Any man that will hit a woman is no man at all.  Leave now before things get any more complicated than they already are.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Honestly, I didn't read past "he hit me in the face several times."  That's enough for me to say you are better off without him.  Your daughter is certainly better off without him.<br>  <br>  Please, get some counseling and learn that this is not how you are to be treated and you need to protect your daughter.|`|0viZhxi6aa	Is there any chance he will go to counseling both with you and on his own? Anger problems can be dealt with, but only if he wants to deal with them. Other than that, you and your daughter would be better off without him. Do you want her to grow up thinking that's the way she should be treated by the men in her life? It can quickly become a bad pattern. Good luck to you!|`|50lIaC8zaa	Oh hun i didn't realise he was violent towards you *hugs* if you really want to make things work between you then have you tried speaking to him about seeing someone about his temper?<br>  <br>  Does he realise that he has a temper or does he just think its normal?<br>  <br>  Im back online now :) xx|`|df805281ce1bc1c7c3de30c04dbcb458aa	I agree with a lot of the answers to your question, they are sound answers. You asked 'will he change' I don't think he will if he has already hit you numerous times. Not unless he faces up to the situation and gets help. Is it after drink that he hits you? If it is he will need help with that too. <br>  <br>  You say 'you really don't want to let your daughter down by leaving him'. Ask yourself this 'Are you letting her down by staying with him?'<br>  She will see and hear what is happening now, and be very scared by it.<br>  <br>  I can understand you don't know what to do, I know how difficult this situation is for you. I hope I have posed you some questions that you need to answer to yourself.Good luck and I sincerely mean that.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Have you considered counseling? It would be worth a shot if you want to make this work. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Sorry I couldn't finish this the first time. I didn't mean to stay with him by any means. You need to leave for you and your daughter's sake. But he needs counseling. He can change and if he gets help it is possible that things could work out in the end. Leaving him will not let your daughter down. You would let her down more by staying in an abusive situation whether he ever raises a hand to her or not. There is government aid that will help you out. There is no reason to stay there and get hit. Stand up, speak out, and fight back.|`|vuEyUbsgaa	I would leave him. If you keep staying around you're just letting him walk all over you doing all these things again. You need to have some respect for yourself and show him that if he treats you like this then he doesnt deserve you! If you want to stay with him then there are alot of things you guys need to work on...I see this relationship doesnt have respect and a lack of communication. The three most important qualities for a relationship to last is respect,communication,and trust. And if your daughter is the only reason that is holding your guys relationship together then most liekly it wont work and you wont be happy. Think for yourself. What makes you happy? whats the best thing for you?|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	Right now you are telling your daughter that it is ok for a man to treat a woman this way.  If you stay with an abusive man you will be letting your daughter down.  If you leave, you will be empowering her and letting her know that treatment like that is unacceptable and she will not have to ever tolerate it.|`|0dwVWzLJaa	this must be horrible to deal with but my advise would defiantly be to have a break from each other and then take things VERY slowly again.<br>  if you split up you wouldn't be letting your daughter down he can still be there for her, and its not fair on her really if she notices the things he says and does to you, you don't want her to grow up thinking its ok for men to treat her like that do you and im not being horrible that's just how i look at it,<br>  maybe it has just become routine for you and your scared to start al over again? money shouldn't be an issue your daughter is the most important thing so do what is best for her but not at the expense of your safety. <br>  What if one day he goes to far and something happens to you, you wont see your daughter grow up and she will be without a mother, but i bet plenty of people have already said this and you wont listen until your ready to ultimately the decision is yours , don't let him manipulate you good luck xxx|`|8i9Ji3QQaa	you want whats best for your daughter? leave  him.<br>  i know it will be hard, but his temper can later<br>  turn twoards her. i know that almost might seem impossible<br>  now , but 90% of  relationships decline over time if there is nothing<br>  to hang on to. for you, it is the girl. now, when she does something<br>  for instance smoke, fail , break something, lie , ( which she will most likely do these things as a teenager) his temper will rise, and even if he doesnt hit her, do you really want your daughter to ever see<br>  her mom gettng hit by her dad? thats traumatizing. it will<br>  raise her horribly . my dad once hit my mom and it completely<br>  ruined my relationship with him AND partly with my mom because she didnt do much about it. it almost became a routine. the<br>  breakups and him being sorry. theyre still together. <br>  and really, i pray someday they wont be.|`|AA12243380	If you do decide to try to work it out with him then you really should get some counseling.  It doesn't sound so healthy.<br>  <br>  My husband and I have also had our ups and downs but he has been willing to work to be better as have I.  Nobody is perfect, know what I mean?<br>  <br>  Either way, the abusive behavior has to stop.  He has to be willing to change and I think that going to counseling would be a great first step.  I think that if he isn't willing to do that then I'm so sorry to say this to you but it might be a lost cause.<br>  <br>  If the abuse continues then you are not serving her at all staying there.  You'll actually be teaching her that it's Ok to let someone treat you with no regard.  She'll have a greater chance of repeating your actions and be treated like dirt by the person who is supposed to love you.<br>  <br>  I don't think he is automatically a lost cause.  My husband treats me a lot better than he treated me even a year ago.  Like you though, I wanted to make the right choice for our girls and myself too.  He is a great dad, yada yada.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Well I'm not going to defend him, because he sound like a real jerk. I can just tell you, that in some cases (certainly not all), a person can change. When someone is arrested for assault, they are often times sent to anger management classes. If rehabilitation wasn't possible for anyone, then those classes wouldn't exist. If he really wanted to change, he could. Perhaps you could bring up the idea of anger management classes to him-If he really wanted to work things out and become a better person, he would be open to change.|`|JXB5pI7Aaa	If he hits you, you need to leave him.<br>  <br>  End of story.<br>  <br>  Do you want your daughter growing up learning that it's ok to be hit if her boyfriend/husband 'thinks they deserve it'?<br>  <br>  Abusers don't change.  They will always find some justification for why 'you deserved it' and how 'sorry' they are because they hit you when you deserved it.<br>  <br>  My advice: contact a battered women's shelter near you, or get with family/friends and get away from him.  What will happen to your daughter if he gets carried away and kills you?|`|UXhFcHCHaa	dont let having a daughter guilt you into staying. would you rather her see you get hit by her dad and then she think its ok if it happens to her. i think you are being manipulated by him. if they hit you once it will happen again. before you leave try saving a little bit of money or get a part time job, there are lots of resources avilable to single moms. im sure if you have family they would want to help than you stay in something abusive. maybe he will cahnge but how many times has he promised this before. maybe you need to leave for a little bit to realize what he has|`|uGqYoZNEaa	UP to "he even hit me in the face numerous times"  girl stop!  Who cares how sincere he is afterwards, is that sincerity worth the fights and the bruises and crying and having a baby growing up in a house with an abuser and a mommy who takes it?  No, not at all.  Please don't make up and give him all these other attributes to cover up the horribleness he does to you.  The best for your daughter is to have a strong, happy mother.  And yes you can do it alone, lots of women do.  Think about it.......Do you want your beautiful little baby growing up and getting slapped on?  Think on it, and I"m sure you already know the answer.  WHatever you do you'll find lots of advice and support on this board.  {Hugs}|`|yBYQCYGuaa	You are not naive, you are in love but I have to say this: if he has hit you in the face, you need to leave him. If not for you, for your Daughter. I am not saying that he would ever hurt your Daughter but you are sending out the wrong message to your little girl by staying in a relationship with an abusive man.<br>  <br>  I am sure he is a great Dad and when his temper isn't flaring, a nice guy but to put it bluntly, even mass murderers and serial killers have friends who genuinely never believed that they could be capable of such crimes. What I am trying to say is that it doesn't matter how nice he is, the fact that he has put his hands on your body makes him an exceptionally un-nice person.<br>  <br>  The decision to leave him wont be easy, especially as you have lots of ties together but in the long run, you will be happier on your own and your Daughter will never feel let down by you for leaving her abusive Father, she'll be proud of you and if you're positive that he is a good Father, she can still continue to have her normal relationship with him.<br>  <br>  Best of luck...|`|ybexjS2Paa	Sorry girl but if a guy hit me even once I'd brake his arms and kick his sorry a** out of the house. I hate abusive men whether it's physical or mental. It's your decision and no one can tell you what to do, but would you like your child seeing you both fighting, arguing or him hitting you constantly? I'm not sure if that's best for her. Maybe him or even you both should seek counselling? I wish you all the best girl. I kicked my ex partner out, he was mentally abusing me.|`|723QHuicaa	I knew you two were having trouble, I did not know he had been violent to you. So my answer to the last question on the - scratch that.<br>  <br>  Im going to be honest. And Im sorry if it hurts you.<br>  <br>  He is not sincere if he hit you a second time. Im a big believer that people can change and they do. But if he was truley remorseful, the physical violence would not have occurred more than once.<br>  <br>  I think you need to be apart - I know you are because of distance. But I mean apart as in not together. When he comes home, ask him  to seek some sort of counselling for his anger, for your safety and also that of your child.<br>  <br>  He can change if he wants to, he has to accept help in order to do that.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Oh, Hon, I only needed to read "He has even hit me in the face numerous times." I don't care if he's sorry afterwards, that doesn't change what he has done and what's hes capable of doing.<br>  <br>  You have your daughter to think about. Who is to say he won't smack/hit her if he ever loses his temper with her? It's just not worth the risk. You need to get yourself and your daughter out of that situation. He's not only physically abusing you but emotionally as well.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	People never change. If he was sincerely sorry he wouldn't do it again.|`|8VCGdvZGaa	If you have been together for 4 years then, as much as you want him to change, he won't...that is just how he is.  <br>  <br>  You won't be letting your daughter down by leaving him.  It is the best thing for her.  If you stay, then she will learn that it is okay for a man to treat her like you are being treated.  You want her to learn that it is not okay to be with a man who hurts her physically and does not respect her.  <br>  <br>  I know this is a difficult decison to make, but you need to step back and realize the negative affect your unhealthy relationship can have on  your daughter.|`|vOomJtbsaa	Awwww babe, no no no!  I know you were having issues but I didn't know he was being verbally and physically abusive.  It's not worth fighting for unless he's willing to get some serious therapy for himself and take some anger management classes, etc.  You do not deserve this, no woman does EVER!  You are a beautiful, lovely lady.  I love all of your questions and answers, and you show just how compassionate and kind you are every day on this forum so please, please, please know how much you are worth and how much more you deserve!  Never let anyone allow you to feel inferior.   Hitting is never acceptable.  You must get away, get out from under him and get your strength back so that you can take care of that beautiful baby girl.  On top of everything else I know you don't want your daughter to grow up thinking that it's okay for a man to hit her.  Imagine how you'd feel if you found out that a man had hit her and made her feel that way and she was questioning herself because of it, that's how I feel about you when you tell me this story.  This is very sad.  You are worth so much more than this pretty lady!! Know it and move on, you can and will do better!  I promise you.<br>  ** By the way I've been through it, the first encounter he called me a c*nt and a wh*re, even though I'd done nothing wrong, the second time he pushed me up against a wall and screamed obscenities at me, the third and final time he hit me hard right across my cheek, gave me a black eye... I called the cops that night, filed a report, he went to jail, I got a restraining order against him and that was the last time I ever saw him.  I'm now with the man I'm going to marry in 2 weeks :)<br>  It can happen for you if you're open to it.|`|ykP7I3caaa	I know that he's remorseful, and he probably is sincere but just the fact that he's hit you at all simply isn't right. Being sorry doesn't make it ok, especially when he does it again. I don't think I could ever get the whole view of your relationship just by reading a question on Yahoo, but I think he at LEAST needs anger counseling and you two should be going to relationship counseling. I don't blame you for wanting what's best for your daughter, but I think part of making your daughter happy is having a happy mother. And the best thing for a father to do for his kids is respecting their mom. If he's not being respectful to you, and she looks up to him, she's going to think it's ok to disrespect you too. There are positive things for each option along with consequences. You just need to be the biggest person you can be and try to weigh them out. Even write them down on a piece of paper if you need to, but you need to do something.
th5SfrB9aa	Aila!!! that's so pretty :) I like the 'little fire' definition better, but aila is more unique than aideen. Aila Mae/May would be cute.|`|mSJwKrQIaa	Aww.

It's a graceful and pretty name that comes out my mouth.  Aidean sounds a little bit Ungle when I pronounce it.  Plus I like the name, "Noble" rather than "Little Fire".  The name "Little Fire" sounds like a trouble maker to me.  A "Noble" sounds like a person who behaves themselves.|`|xGJhBCk5aa	I love Aila Rose I think it's beautiful!<br>  <br>  Aila is very original but not too unique that people won't be able to pronounce it and combined with Rose it's lovely!<br>  <br>  I'm slightly biased though as my daughter's name is going to be Isla and thats virtually the same!<br>  <br>  Aideen is okay, but I think Aila is much more feminine.<br>  <br>  =]|`|N4U2oKwEaa	I LOVE Aila.  It's beautiful, unique, and I love the spelling.  You could call her Lala.  :)  It also sounds cute with Rose. <br>  Honestly, not too much of a fan of Aideen, although I like the meaning.|`|F2cVt5jaaa	I love Aila :o) <br>  I like it so much better with your daughter's name! <br>  Your daughter's name looks and sound so girly..which is adorable!<br>  Aila has that same feel to it!<br>  Aila Rose...Adorable!<br>  Best wishes for the future :o)|`|IKpwMXTlaa	i prefer Aideen<br>  <br>  but is Esia irsh or arabic? if its irish too then go for aila.<br>  <br>  both are different, but they are both pretty.|`|WtElgJDtaa	Alia|`|BvZvZaxzaa	Aila|`|RsPXsMYuaa	Has to be Aila, that's beautiful. Really not a fan of Aideen to be honest, sounds awful!|`|VMCBNNlzaa	I think I would go with Aideen because I think it has a more distinct sound than Aila.<br>  <br>  Aila sounds very close to Eisa.|`|BjDJfagmaa	Aila is pretty!|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	A?la is what I would pick.|`|7jrKXqI9aa	aila. no doubt.|`|35cOQFIDaa	A?la|`|q8pV5Ry2aa	A?la|`|Cnri0Rnaaa	Ohh I really like A?la.

God Bless!|`|AA11138222	Aila for sure. I think it's a beautiful name!<br>  <br>  Aideen reminds me too much of Aiden, and I foresee people thinking it's a typo and assuming it is supposed to be Aiden, or just pronouncing it like Aiden because it is such a popular name right now. I do think it's a pretty name though :)|`|AA12370001	honestly, I don't like either of them.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	to many people are naming their girls Aiden and yours is to close to that, but Aila is different, but not out there, so I pick Aila although I know it spelled Ayla!  It's the name of a character in one of my favorite book series!|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Aideen is beautiful but sounds a bit sharp<br>  <br>  Aila sounds softer and more feminine.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	I have always liked Aila, but I spell it with a y.<br>  Middle name is nice too, that is my daughters middle name.|`|GpR5MI5raa	aila!!! <br>  <br>  by the way i also love esia!|`|9Zjk9dRqaa	Aila thats the one|`|5bl8pKkGaa	Aila Rose<br>  <br>  I think it sounds pretty and also my drama teahcer is called aiden so aideen sounds too much of a guys name to me :]<br>  But i love Aila it sounds so pretty.<br>  Ohhh guess what my name (alison) apparently also means noble, haa sorry I just looked up to see what it mean and was like o0oh|`|Wk7oNweGaa	I like the sound of Aila, but I really like the meaning of Aideen, it's really cute.  :)|`|FvYqKZSMaa	A?la <br>  Aideen is a boys name.|`|wQEdey24aa	i like A?la and A?la Rose is a really pretty name....not really feeling the Aideen though :)|`|euFDn0FBaa	Aila is a very cute name and sounds better with Esia.  Aideen just doens't sound pretty nor go well with Esia|`|IkXU06wpaa	Aila is a Great name & it means something good
f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	Preschoolers can be hilarious! My niece eats her hamburger weird to! She eats the 2 buns and then the hamburger! Its funny to watch her! She can eat it cold though. She'll be fine!|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Nope, it's fine. You don't have to heat up anything in a can. It's all been cooked. It cooks during processing as well. <br>  Look on the side. It should say heat if desired. No need to worry.|`|AA10120592	I don't think theres anything wrong with that. Unless on the can it says to cook it to a certain temperature, eating cold soup should be fine.|`|F2cVt5jaaa	haha how odd! Prescoolers are so funny :o)<br>  I think it's fine!|`|vEv2YwWdaa	It is cooked so there is nothing at all wrong with that.  She may just enjoy the sensory input the cold gives her.  It will not hurt her at all.|`|AyG4sZOlaa	Yup! <br>  It is cooked and you have nothing to worry about.<br>  Question: She doesnt like it warm? or she doesn't like the way it tastes after its been boiled?|`|yo9XNz61aa	I think its just fine.  If you are worried then heat it up and put it in the fridge or freezer if she wants it sooner!|`|RtGkTKa8aa	Well maybe but Progresso has MSG...so I would not be feeding that stuff toi my family!|`|aAQPV0Jjaa	yeah your not eating it r u ... then y does it matter|`|AA11138222	Haha, I have to agree with your daughter, I think all soup tastes better cold. I love to eat vegetable soup right out of the can. <br>  <br>  Everything in the soup is cooked, she'll be fine!|`|evEJxv06aa	it's ok for to eat it like that but she should eat it warmly.
LFXTpqfdaa	You're pushing yourself too hard. You don't want a racing heart, and feeling like you're "going to die" is definitely too much. Our stamina goes way down during pregnancy (sometimes my heart pounds when I merely roll over in bed!) and you have to accommodate. <br>  <br>  When you start breathing too hard, stop and take the elevator the rest of the way up. Just take care of yourself, momma.|`|NFt3h7dHaa	Honey, I got to the point that I lost my breath folding the sheets about halfway through pregnancy.<br>  <br>  The truth is, your body can't take the same strength and pace once you're pregnant as you could beforehand.  You can still exercise, but pay attention to your body and take it easy.  If you're getting really winded by taking the stairs (as long as you're not in pain), just give yourself a few more minutes to climb them.  Exercise is not only totally safe, but encouraged and healthy for pregnant women.<br>  <br>  Just take it easy, but it's so good for you and the baby to remain active.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA12275027	only your doctor can answer this question for sure.  but i know during my pregnancy i would walk to work every day which was a 30 minute fast walk with 2 really steep hills.  i would huff and puff through the whole thing and my heart would pound really hard.  but it was something i always did, it just got harder as i got bigger.  my midwife thought that it was not only safe but good for me.  consult your doctor or midwife and they can tell you what should be safe for you.|`|DutTBV3caa	um i was reading in my baby book and it says if you cant sing the happy birthday song without running out of breath you're working too hard.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Don't get overheated.  Take it slow.|`|AA10458750	Well you are 29 weeks....most women do have difficulty breathing startign around 25 weeks and throughout. If you feel like you are gasping for air or your cheeks are becomming flushed, take a breather, sip some water! Allow yourself extra time to get up thsoe stais now. I wouldn't stop using them though, they are good excercise!|`|5MBdJK4Baa	my doctoor is always asking me if my heart races but i havent had that yet he tells me to get in to see in as soon as it does. so im taking that as a bad sign. you can exercise as long as you can still say a sentence without being out of breath, once you get to that point you are over working yourself.|`|LUbW8kTBaa	If you're having troubles breathing or catching your breath, then your baby is also having a difficult time getting oxygen.  Your baby needs your oxygen to breathe!|`|vg1i8HATaa	you get out of breath easily when pregnant.  Slow down, and walk up the stairs at a slower pace.  If your actually exercising, stay hydrated, stretch and stop if something hurts, or you get out of breath.  Of course your heart rate will increase, if it doesn't your not exercising.  Make sure you can say a 4-5 word sentence and if you feel like your doing too much you probably are.  <br>  <br>  I had three healthy children, I exercised everyday with 30 mins of step aerobics.  I am healthier for it and my body bounced right back into shape.  good luck,  and make sure you stay healthy for both of you.  It's great for the baby

c73QkZ2haa	They do it as frequently as they like some babies cant sleep unswaddled because of it including mine. He constantly wakes himself up. <br>  If it concerns you talk to your doctor but it seems pretty normal.<br>  ETA: My 6 year old daughter jerks when she goes to sleep as well and has done it her whole life too and this too is normal and is referred to as sleep starts. As long as she isnt convulsing your fine....My oldest does as does her Dad sometimes he does it a number of time before drifting off. His whole body shudders or his legs or his arms.... Talk to your doctor if you are so worried about it.|`|pXSKSS3daa	This is normal. You seem a little freaked out about it(this is your second question on it) so consult with your daughter's pediatrician.<br>  <br>  Some babies just have jerky motions while falling asleep.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Yeah its totally normal. My son would startle all the time. Even while he was sleeping. It started to go away when he was 2 months old. Sometimes he still does it. <br>  <br>  ETA: It will be a bunch of times. I remember when he was in the hospital he would do it all the time. Even when someone touched him.
ln0wLqZhaa	Well im 18 and pregnant , And i'm not giving up my baby for adoption , and i think it would be ten times harder it being a open adoption  you get to see ur child but can't take it home and raise it   , i wouldn't be able to cope .  No i  wouldnt be able to let my mother  call the child her own either . And Abortion was totally not a option... I know i'm gonna get thumbs down for this   I may be 18 but im done school doing college courses and will continue to do them after and i have a  job and will get a better one after ... So I can support and raise my baby just fine.<br>  <br>  Edit: But at 15   U just might have to consider adoption.|`|B4HtgUnKaa	well im 15 and im 2months pregnant already..<br>  And im keeping my baby and my mom said shes going to take care of it while im at school and cheer practice, but i would never put it up for adoption i wouldn't be able to hand my child over to some random person. I mean when my baby is born when you look at it and see its small little feet and hands..you just cant give it up for adoption! And noo im not going to pretend its my moms because she said since i made the mistake of getting pregnant i have to take care of it on my own.|`|fccdcaa6e1aa306a88110de27284c970aa	i would keep my baby to myself and raise it myself i couldnt live with myself known i killed my own baby or giving it to people that aint me so i would keep my baby cuz that would my  baby|`|qPRLEWVfaa	Why would you have to pretend it is your moms in the first place?<br>  <br>  <br>  I have a 6 month old and i am 17.....<br>  If it came down to what you said i would just pretend i guess but i still sont see why you would have to do that??? lol|`|X8kdZhkEaa	at 15 a baby would raise complications for me... it's a matter of having it or not having it. I know I'll get thumbs down, but MY PERSONAL OPINION is that I (i) would get an abortion.|`|zbfSMvLeaa	If I was currently pregnant *shudder*... then I would give my baby up for adoption. An open adoption. That way, my baby could have wonderful parents and I would still get to see him or her :]|`|PDJbNAZqaa	I'll keep the child but I'm a virgin at sixteen years old and don't plan to have sex any time soon.

UIM8X38Oaa	Yes, you are just going to have to let him cry for a while.  You can still talk to him while you are busy and let him know that you are there for him.  It is best to get it under control now rather then wait till he is older.<br>  <br>  I realized by my third child that they will be fine if they have to wait for mom for a little while.  They do adjust really well,<br>  <br>  Jenny<br>  <br>  I do understand that it is hard when you are living with other people I did with my first, but you are mom and will need to try to explain what your goals are with your child and that you need there help in accomplishing them|`|145RUNQHaa	I know how you feel i found this age the most draining but please try to see there is light at the end of the tunnel and the important thing is to try and enjoy your son despite the stress.your little one sounds like he's in a clingy stage which is normal.try not to get annoyed with his cries and grunts it really is just his own way of communicating with you and letting you know he's not happy with something same for his laughter and smiles telling you he's happy.he has no other way to tell you and laughing and crying is his way of talking to you.i wouldn't recommend leaving him to cry go with the stage he's at.i carried mine around all day at this age and yes it was hard i learned how to do most jobs with one hand but i realised it's an age where you can't get much done anyway only to concentrate on them i certainly built up some muscles in my arms from all that holding!but it helped them gain confidence one day i found i could put them down with a lot less fuss and when they began to walk they became more independent.it's not possible to spoil a baby i don't believe in the term spoiled anyway just hang in there for now this will not last forever.it must be hard with you living with the in laws put your foot down with them do not let them interfere with whatever you decide to do.|`|RqeHygq1aa	you are spoiling him let him cry....I know this sound mean but he will be alright .He needs to learn that the world doesnt revolve around him and that he has to be patient.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: you need to get your own place ...if you dont your child will grow up confused and will not see you as an authority figure|`|9WLq7J9uaa	First of all DONT WORRY!  It is a phase.  Babies go through dozens of phases and some of them make you want to pull your hair out.  I am 27 today.. my birthday it sucks lol...  and i have 4 children ages 7, 6, 4, and 10 months.  <br>  <br>  My kids have all done this and the best advice i can give you is to let him cry it out sometimes.  10 minutes of crying,.. then if he is still crying you go check on him but don't pick him up just reassure him that you are there and he needs sleep and leave the room again.  This takes sometime to get him self-soothing to go to sleep but ultimately it always works.  He will not hurt himself by crying a bit.  Also i don't always pick up my baby when he is whining and crying and following me around the house.  I love him, i spend as much time as i can with him but i have a house to keep clean for him and work to do and other children as well, so i give him a toy and let him whine a bit.  Eventually he gets the idea that i am not going to pick him up and he finds something to do lol.  They test you to see if they can get you to do everything you want and you have to put your foot down a little if you don't want the behavior to continue.  <br>  <br>  I'd say my baby did the whining and crying like crazy thing for a month or two then got the idea.  Now if he is in his crib and it is bed time he might cry and whine for 5 minutes, then just lay his little head down and go to sleep and he is an incredibly happy and loving baby.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hun, if you ever need to talk i've been in your shoes!  My email is leslie@streamingimagesdesign.com|`|9ro8fiKvaa	You poor thing. So much stress, pressure and so little sleep and free time for yourself! I am 38, live with my husband in our own place and I know what you are going through - I cannot imagine being in your situation. I really feel for you. Just know that babies go through phases - this will pass like all of the other phases. I promise. Is there any way that you could take a scheduled break for time all to yourself? Even if it's just to go for an hour's walk every night - you need it! Would your in-laws & or partner help out? You cannot do this alone and nor should you! Don't worry about your child's behavior. If you feel that he needs picking up then pick him up - he's just a baby! Kids develop differently - if your Dr has no eating suggestions that you could try then try not to worry about his behavior. My nephew still behaves the way you are describing and he's 16 months. I do not 'blame' my sister for his behavior as she has an older son who behaves much differently.<br>  <br>  OK, good luck and try to get some time for yourself. It'll do both you and your son some good!|`|vEv2YwWdaa	First tell you in laws that you are his mother and you know they love him but you know what is right.  Let them know that you are in charge of him.  Unless however you are living in their home and living off them... then that is another issue.<br>  <br>  You need to let him cry.  You are making him the way he is by holding him and responding to his temper tantrums.  <br>  <br>  Babies are not born bad, parents make them this way.  You need him on a schedule.  He needs to eat play and sleep at the same time everyday.  If he cries at nap time or bed time.. walk away.  If your schedule says he naps from 12-1 put him down at 12 and do not go in until 1.  He will scream his head off but he will get over it.  Everyday it will get easier.  He will get used to the schedule and he will know what to do and when.  <br>  <br>  If you think he is bad now, everyday that you let this go one he is going to get worse.  He will be a monster by the time he is 2.  You will have the child no one wants to be around.<br>  <br>  Lastly... make sure you do not have anymore kids for a long time.
SyAIl2btaa	Of course it is possible. I bet you can picture yourself with this guy for months now, a year, two years, maybe even 3 years... but what about 20 years? 50 years? Now that is a long time. As we all hope things will last, it may not and things do happen. I still hope that me and my Bf will last a long long while. But i know things may happen. (we have been together for 6 months now.)

As you grow older, your perspective change. personality change. Beliefs and morals change. So naturally ur interest changes and you would most likely<br>  come to like someone else as you meet new people. You are 13 now, going to high school soon, I presume. I bet you you will find some other guys you will like there. So do I think you guys can last forever? No. I mean.. you might want it to now.. but think about it, you are 13 and you wanna be with him rest of ur life? how would you know anything about relationships? all you'd know is him. for the experience sake, you gotta branch out and soak up the life.|`|i0IGcApMaa	NO NO NO, sorry kid but you're too young to think about a future with this guy.

Still, anything worth having is worth working for, right?  I just caution to listen to your head as well as your heart.  Your opinions on what you want in life may change along the way as you grow into adults, but his will too and you never know...  You may keep growing in the same direction!

OmJfYPptaa	I did at like 12!|`|Q2n6nMWUaa	I'd say around 13 or 14.<br>  <br>  Funny story about this: I work in a grocery store, and two adorable little girls around 7 or 8 and their dad came through my lane.

It was awkward.|`|oMhKFca2aa	I'm not allowing my daughter to wear makeup until she's 15/16.<br>  <br>  To me, letting your child under 13 wear makeup is bad parenting. You wonder why kids grow up so fast these days, it's bad parenting. Lots of parents need their heads checking|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I think a little eye shadow and lip gloss is fine in 7th grade, more as you get older. I never had rules when i could and couldn't wear makeup so i never really did. I still don't.|`|NPlbjlu6aa	I started wearing make up in 6th grade<br>  So I would say about 12|`|hUyk92Cvaa	i think 13|`|AA11210211	I think they should be able to play around with play makeup when they are young but they can't start wearing it on a daily basis until the are around 11 or 12.I started playing with makeup when I was 3yrs old,One time I got mad in  headstart because the teacher told my mom I couldn't bring my purse with makeup anymore because the other kids were eating it!! lol|`|4gZYucHMaa	I don't think it's a case of ''should'' but rather what is comfortable for the parent<br>  <br>  I'd like to say never but it's unrealstic--If mommy wears make up it's only natural for my daughter to want to as well.<br>  <br>  She wear play makeup on the occassion for when she dresses up in make believe costume, washes off before she goes out in public(she's7). I don't mind nailpolish as long as it's kiddie orientated.<br>  <br>  When she's a teen I'd expect her to wear makeup if she wants to. I did but only on the eyes and it was just a bit. I still do the same practise I'll teach her how to do it so she doesn't look so garrish like some do.<br>  <br>  I don't freak out about makeup, it's nice to define yourself where you need it but going overkill with it so you look like a hooker is a problem.|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	I'd say probably around when they start high school.  I never really was into makeup, and I didn't even start wearing it until 10th grade (last year).  But even now, I pretty much only wear eyeshadow and mascara.  So a little bit of makeup is probably okay in around 8th or 9th grade.  But it shouldn't be too over the top.  I remember the day I started 8th grade (the year that most girls seemed to start wearing it) and I couldn't believe how many of the girls were wearing so much makeup that they literally looked 20 years old!|`|z5EDtgtyaa	that's the problem with girls now, they grow up to quick. 12 and 13 is to young to wear make up and my daughter won't be wearing make up at that age. I don't wear a lot of makeup eye shadow and mascara that's all. no foundation it's not good for your skin and it makes you look older. you skin starts to depend on it. just think about it look at celebrities, when they don't have make up on they look so different, some of them look ugly with out make up. why would you want to do that to your face.|`|BRT2teSqaa	7?  Two Cents, do you allow your daughter to go out of the house in eye makeup and blush?  If so, that is very strange.  Or is it just for play time in the house?<br>  <br>  I think 14 is a good age.  High school.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	never sounds good to me...it's terrible for your skin and it ages you.  i am 33 and I only wear make-up on special occassions and I am told constantly that I look nowhere near my age.|`|dAgtW3G0aa	All little girls love playing dress up and mine started playing with mummys make up at about age 6, I maybe put a bit of glitter and lip gloss on for parties but just for fun.  My 13 yr old got her first set of proper make up last year (aged 12) and she's experimenting with it and puts it on at special occasions, partys, xmas and such and then she only really uses eye makeup and lipsticks and nail polishes, she doesnt need base makeup like powder, foundation and bronzer as her complexion is young and fresh and I doubt anybody under the age of 15 needs those things, 15 sounds like a good age to start with daily proper makeup before that I think a bit of gloss or eyeliner/shadow is fine in moderation for between the ages of 12 and 15(ish).|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I started wearing makeup daily at like 12, because I had acne and I thought that would help cover it up. Turns out I just made it worse. Oh well. <br>  <br>  My stepdaughter is 7 and she LOVES makeup. She has ever since I've known her- for the past 3+ years. She regularly puts on eyeshadow, blush, lipgloss...and so long as it isn't really creepy looking, my husband and I are okay with it. She's recently been into mascara too- I had issues with this since I was afraid she would get it too close to her eyes or poke herself in the eye or something...but she hasn't so far.|`|CsLyyRQeaa	I think it is okay for a little girl about 6 to wear make up on Special occasions and mommy puts it on her.  Teaching her how to apply it properly.  Then she can wear make up when ever she wants at the age of 13 if she wears it properly.|`|s4aX6bF6aa	i think 16 is plenty good to start wearing make up...why rush to grow up...stay young as long as you can.|`|G9wEDvedaa	12-13 <br>  in grade 7 is when everyone started to wear makeup.|`|GpR5MI5raa	13.|`|1enIWBGnaa	18!|`|CrZxYK5raa	maybe 12 when they reach middle school.
SO3aE2RMaa	Probably a Yeast infection..very common during pregnancy due to hormones.Go see your GP and he should prescribe some medication to clear it.Do Not leave it untreated cause it may get worse.. good luck dear..|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	Sounds like a yeast infection. <br>  <br>  I would bring it up your next appointment.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	yea u definatelly gotta get seen by ur doctor it could be so many different things, shell just have to check u n check for bacteria and stuff. <br>  i just went in for a discharge ... found out it was normal to have axcess discharge during pregnancy, but she did find some bacteria so i got put on this like gel thing, that i have to put in like a tampon, weeeird! but im glad i went to get checked out..<br>  good luck, call her as soon as u can and make an appt|`|uu9lGT1waa	you should be checked by your doctor. just so you can get on a medication or cream if its a rash of some sort!!|`|TLjNUJHLaa	Call your doctor|`|GalBwrwOaa	I would go see the doctor|`|azE51WGRaa	It could be a yeast infection or an infection called Bacterial Vaginosis (also called BV.) BV is treatable with antibiotics. Call your doctor for an appointment so that he/she can make a proper diagnosis so you can get the correct medication. Good luck and congrats on the baby!|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	sounds like a yeast or bacterial infection. see your doctor about it. they can give you cream and anti-biotics. <br>  <br>  dont be embarrassed hun, every woman goes through it. i'm very prone to them and I'm a clean freak|`|txv7TIgiaa	go to the doctor! are you in a good relationship cuz it kinda sound like a std...or maybe some kind of yeast infection...i don't know just go to the doctor you don't know if it could spread to the baby...|`|pFUywyWmaa	Could be a yeast infection
jliowBeLaa	Yeah you have a right to make him pay for child support, what on earth has he been doing all these years if he REALLY wanted to get close to his child? Well done you for bringing him up, and you are lucky you have had some help, even if it wasnt from the person who shoudl have been helping, the father.<br>  If you are worried about the environment being dangerous you have a right to be there if you think your child might get into trouble there and you can sit with them in the same room maybe in the corner doing something on your own so you arnt interrupting, but making sure that your son is ok. <br>  I dont think the father deserves to see his son but at the end of the day they are father and son. He could have just dropped some money in a brown paper envelope or written a letter to your son, at least showing he cared. Wow i admire you bringing up a kid at 16, that must have been such hard work, the father shoudl be ashamed of himself. Also i think your son shoudl know how much your ex put you through and explain to him what really happened. Dont leave out the horrible details, he needs to know you were the one that got up in the night to feed him, you were the one that was there for him, not his "dad". i put "dad" in speech marks as he didnt act like a father.<br>  <br>  Any fool can father a baby, but it takes a real man to be a dad. Your ex, the father of your son has not been a real dad to your son. He has been a coward. I admire you for holding your ground and refusing to let your son see him at the tender age of seven when he coudl have been put in a dangerous environment. On the other hand, it sounds like you have been a superb mother, loooking out for your son in every way possible. Maybe your husband is a better "dad"  or father figure to what the real father woudl have been like if he had been with him. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and Well Done for getting this far. Everythign happens for a reason <br>  <br>  x|`|4Qb1FNH2aa	Don't do it, whatever small good might come of it, and it is doubtful that any will, it is not worth it. This man does not deserve to see your child and your son does not deserve to have his life disrupted.<br>  <br>  Just explain the situation as best you can. Be as honest as his age allows, you son does deserve that.<br>  <br>  As for child support, the law says he does not have to see the child for him to have to pay. I say you see where you can get with that first and if he is able to pay you regularly without hassle for an amount of time you will choose (6 months, a year even), that maybe then he could EARN the right to see your child... and I would start with short, supervised (by you) visits.|`|6dhPFK5Jaa	yes. sue for child support. and i think, that your son SHOULD know who his real father is. but then again, if he dosnt care about your son...then no. i wouldnt let MY son go see his real father if he didnt care about us. but i honestly think that your right. if he will pay for the three other kids, he should for you as well.
263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	My daughter LOVES dirt and yes, rocks. We were out playing yesterday and she looked like she had something in her mouth and I asked what it was and she opened her mouth, she was sucking on a rock! Uuuuggggh. I made her spit it out. Then she rubbed her hands in the dirt and then dust them off and then she gives them a lick. Its so gross. But they say there is a lot of nutrients in soil, some even necessary for the human body (reason why some pg women crave dirt or ice when PG). So I don't go ballistic on her, as nasty as it is...it hasn't killed her yet.|`|4Qb1FNH2aa	Don't worry about it, my son used to freak out if I took his orange peels away when he was eating them. He also used to bite the tops off of markers and chew chalk. I caught him eating leaves once... :)<br>  <br>  It is definitely normal. He grew out of it and I am sure yours will, too.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Sounds just like a boy thing, lol.  Mine is like that to. :)<br>  <br>  Some do that kind of stuff till they are five.<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|AyG4sZOlaa	Completely normal!<br>  My daughter used to eat dirt, she ate dirt every time she had the chance she grew out of it.|`|yIyvNjZsaa	One of my 3 year old sons licks everything.  It's pretty sick, but I figure it's just a stage.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	lol<br>  This one made me laugh. My daughter does the same thing. Rocks, flowers, snow, windows, her sisters, me, the cat, everything. She's 2 also. <br>  I'd recommend gluing the rubber bit on, he could choke on that. It's a phase.<br>  I've asked my daughter why she does it, and I get a great big mmmmm....it's good. <br>  Keep telling him that it doesn't go in his mouth, and if it's something that's potentially dangerous, take it from him. I pretty sure my daughter does it for a reaction. Try ignoring it when appropriate, and see if he moves onto something else.
ZVCm3XAEaa	My girl was not much of an eater or sleeper, luckily the sleep got sorted but she still is quite a fussy madam when it comes to food.  As long as your son is taking his formula I wouldn't worry about solids just yet especially since he is gaining and growing so well.  Leave the solids until you see that he is looking for more formula which tells you he is getting hungry for more and try some baby rice then.  Motherhood is hard enough without being sleep deprived hon and believe me if you were a bad mam you wouldn't be on here worrying about your wee darling.  Have you eliminated things like being too hot or too cold at night, he could be teething, is the room too bright or it may be that he misses you, why not try putting whatever top you were wearing during the day into the cot with him or even a nightie you have been wearing so that he can smell you. Hope this is of some help to you.|`|GsSRY7quaa	before you are ready to put him down for the night, put some cereal in his formula. the added food may help him sleep better / longer so you can rest a little. YOU ARE NOT A BAD MOM!!!  is there someone who can watch himm for a short time so you can get some "you" time?  alot of things are trail and error, so try not to get all bent oout of shape. just keep a level head and you will be great.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	solids are not recommended until 6 months old...so if he is refusing them than don't force it.  It might cause problems later.  Are you trying to implement some kind of schedule for him?  How do you put him to bed at night, rocking? singing? Is he sleeping in his own crib in his own room?!<br>  <br>  Trust me I know where you are.  God blessed us with a wondeful child and she sleeps through the night since she was 9 weeks old.  She is 11 months old and on the rare occassion when she wakes in the night I am a basketcase because I have to be up at 5am to work.  The very best thing you can do for yourself is sleep when he sleeps.  That means if he goes down at 7pm you drop whatever you are doing and go to bed!!!  Until he is sleeping through the night you've got to just drop everything and rest!!|`|lFlapW8maa	ahh you will sleep when he is around 3 years old.  thats what being a mother is about.  just drink lots of coffee and take naps when you can.  you really dont need that much sleep anyways.  and remember it wont always be like this.<br>  <br>  he is not ready for baby food.  he is trying to tell you that.  just because he looks 7m means nothing.  i would not start feeding baby food til around 6 or 7 months.  why rush you have lots of years for him to eat food.  he will be fine with formula .  <br>  <br>  about the cramps have you tried mylicon drops for gas?  otc med.  give him another month or so and reintroduce solids take it slow and enjoy.<br>  <br>  oh one more thing you carried him in your stomach for 10m and he slept while you were awake and was active when you were sleep.  so it is taking him some time to set his biological sleep clock the way you want it.
uu9lGT1waa	hahahaha it wouldn't be late b/c of a papsmear....how funny!!!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Pap smears have nothing to do with your period.<br>  <br>  Take a pregnancy test.|`|4EoZaUDYaa	Your Pap Smear won't have any influence over your periods.  If your period still hasn't started, go to the pharmacy and purchase a pregnancy kit...if you're in a country that has them available.  If not, you need to see a doctor to rule out any other problems.  If you have unprotected sex, expect pregnancy.|`|3787c9c70f565930f2add9dcf558930baa	anything is possible so i disagree with the other answers, it might have delayed you coming on - if stress can make yo late why can't a papsmear??????  However I was 4 days late today and took a pregnancy test and it was positive!!!!!!|`|RLfzLn8Vaa	Your period definately would not be late because of the pap smear. You should wait until your period is more than a week late to worry about being pregnant. It could just be late. Good luck!

Brown urine can indicate blood in the urine, not pregnancy.  She needs to see a Dr.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I'm assuming she noticed the color, panicked and told you.  Well it sounds like she has an infection more than anything else.  I'd make a doctors appointment.  It could be blood in the urine but it could also be a bladder infection making it more cloudy and gold then yellow.  Ask her does it have a funny smell...kind've like iron.  If so its most likely a bladder infection but still go to the doctor because it needs to be resolved.  I highly doubt she's pregnant.|`|uuHPneEcaa	never heard of the warm part. it could be a sign.. if her period is late have her take a pregnancy test. but why are u looking at her pee anyway?|`|T48smu01aa	Get out of here you sick troll!!!!!!!!|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	troll<br>  <br>  you have been reported|`|dSobv28maa	Im assuming your a dad with an infant who is peeing in a diaper and not a troll. First off pee is always warm because it comes from inside the body which is usually around 98 degrees. Secondly, if her urine is dark yellow she needs to drink more water for hydration if its brownish or red go to the ER.|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	how in the hell do you know how warm it is!!!? that's just creepy and I'm assuming she just forgot to flush the toilet one day.<br>  <br>  no, it's not a sign of pregnancy! she's just not drinking enough water|`|ImGwbkGNaa	it might be pregnancy because that actually can change the urine but she might just be dehydrated wich can make urine really warm almost like it burns when you pee|`|9scpRClxaa	Warm--urine is warm.  Brownish--either blood or dehydration.  Drink lots of water to see if it "clears" up.|`|cFktUueyaa	Wow. This whole situation screams Jerry Springer. She doesn't sound pregnant, that's def not a sign of pregnancy. And urine is warm!|`|tQPvv0Glaa	Okay, this is just weird.

Charles is a good strong classic name and Charlie is a cute nickname. Charlotte I prefer to Charles no offensive, it's such a beautiful classical name that ages well Lottie is a cute nickname too. <br>  Middle names:- <br>  Elizabeth meaning God is my vow. Charlotte Elizabeth <br>  Grace meaning of course grace. Charlotte Grace <br>  Rose meaning of course a rose. Charlotte Rose <br>  Kate meaning pure girl. Charlotte Kate. <br>  First names:- <br>  Lyric meaning a lyric. Lyric Charlotte <br>  Aria meaning beautiful melody. Aria Charlotte <br>  Nicole meaning victory of the people. Nicole Charlotte <br>  Faith meaning trusting in God. Faith Charlotte<br>  Hope this helps, congrats and good luck!|`|AA11138222	Charlotte Isobel<br>  Charlotte Daniella<br>  Charlotte Maryanne<br>  Charlotte Sky<br>  Charlotte Harper<br>  Charlotte Elaine<br>  <br>  It would somewhat depend on the last name, but I think any of these sound nice.<br>  <br>  By the way, I absolutely LOVE that you are using Charlotte and not Charlie for a girl. I think Charlie sounds ridiculous as a girl's name!
iVcaB9h7aa	The following was taken word for word from the link below.  Hope it helps.<br>  <br>  -An adoptive mom with a touch of geek.<br>  <br>  As we know that in any centralized computer network system all the resources are stored or managed at one place (computer system). <br>  <br>  This makes is easy for system administrator to keep all that resources consistent and in accurate form. While in distributed system all the sites containing the data and resources need to be managed. We can easily back up the data that is only at one place. It is also very much easy to protect the system from authorized access because there is only site on the network that needs protections. <br>  <br>  The centralized device is normally known as the server that is responsible of managing all the processing and controlling. Only the administrator has access to the server. All the other clients on the network request the services from the server. The administrator is in charge to assign the rights to these different users/clients that request the services. <br>  Besides all these advantages, there are a number of shortcomings attached with this centralized approach. <br>  <br>  As there is a central device containing all the network resources, thus there is only a single point of failure. It means if this central device create some problem, the entire network will suffer a fall down. This central device has to handle all the clients with various requests so, it must be powerful enough to fulfill this task efficiently.|`|UO1QE8phaa	This is the PEOPLE adoption section... next time check your category before you hit 'post'<br>  <br>  You'll get cool, nerdy techy types instead of us "bitter, ungrateful" adoptee types.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Drawbacks...

Red color and I spotted couple of times. There were little clots very little like the size of 2 ants but I didnt miscarry. I am now 31 wks pregnant. It really depends...<br>  <br>  Some people they spot and they miscarry and some carry to full term..<br>  <br>  Its only a matter of time and sometimes there are precautions that you can avoid miscarriage but most of the time if it happens no matter what you do, it will happen...<br>  <br>  I was on bedrest on my sec pregnancy but i still miscarried.<br>  <br>  Call your dr...<br>  Goodluck|`|96HWpdkFaa	It could be a misscarige or it could be a different reason, go to the doctor.|`|AA12275027	it could be two things...it could be breakthrough bleeding (which is not normal but common).  i had breakthrough bleeding for the first 4 months of my pregnancy around the time my period was due.  or it can be a miscarriage.  you need to go to the er either way and get an ultrasound and or a blood test to check your hormone level.  i have had bleeding during both my pregnancy's.  the first one ended in miscarriage and the second pregnancy is now my 4 year old son.<br>  <br>  you must go to the er now...i'm so sorry if you are miscarrying, it's very hard loosing a baby.|`|928d3c3f724692764257407068fe45d4aa	I can only tell you about my experience.

If the bleeding is accompanied with cramps, then you could be in big trouble!|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Only your Dr. can answer that.|`|sYsfI856aa	I've had 2 miscarriages before so I understand the sensitive matter.<br>  <br>  If you have cramping along with the bleeding, the signs aren't great, BUT a little bleeding/spotting in early pregnancy is normal and I had this same thing happen early on with my son and he's happy healthy 2 year old now.<br>  <br>  With ANY bleeding after having tested positive for pregnancy, you should go in and be seen so they can check via blood tests and ultrasounds.<br>  <br>  If it turns out to be a miscarriage, there is nothing that can stop it. They happen due to abnormalities in the embryo, which would prevent it from growing into a healthy living breathing baby.<br>  <br>  Don't let yourself stress out, lay out, feet up, and give your doctor a call. If you begin to go several through pads  (do NOT use tampons) in just a few hours, don't hesitate to go to your ER and tell them what is happening.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you, and I hope it all goes well..... Remember too that any pelvic penetration can also cause you to bleed some during pregnancy.|`|zk1FSXcIaa	Oh honey, you must be terrified.  All the people on here who are telling you to call your doctor are right.  You need to do that.  I had some spotting at 7 weeks, around when I would have gotten my period before being pregnant, and that's just what it was.  My body wasn't used to being pregnant yet and everything was fine.  However, just before I conceived that baby (who is now 9 months old) I lost one very very early, like 2 or 3 weeks.  It was the first time I'd ever been pregnant and my body kind of freaked out.  It's rather common, and a lot of women who aren't trying to get pregnant never even know they were.  People bleed for all kinds of reasons, and some are perfectly fine and some aren't.  There's no way to tell unless you go in to the doctor.  I went right to the ER and they did an ultrasound right away.  As an added bonus, I got to see my son's heartbeat for the first time.  Best of luck.  Let me know how it goes, I'll be thinking of you.|`|BJuHbQXfaa	I had the same thing you did. In some woman it does happen this way in the beginning. Doctors do not know why and it is very scary I know. I started crying to my husband because I thought to I was having a miscarriage. The doctor said I was to rest with my legs up on a pillow and just wait to see if it stops. If it gets worse and heavier then I was to go to the doctor or ER right away. It did slow down after about an hour and then it just stopped on its own. As long as it does not get worse then you will be ok.  Good luck and best wishes.|`|azE51WGRaa	Sometimes a women can have a little bit of bleeding during the beginning of a pregnancy and have no problems. Other times it can be the signal of a miscarriage starting. I would go to your doctor or ER and make sure that everything is ok. Better to be safe than sorry. Best of luck to you..|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Call the doctor.|`|8i9Ji3QQaa	call a doctor, i agree.<br>  it could be lots of things.<br>  don't procrastinate!
