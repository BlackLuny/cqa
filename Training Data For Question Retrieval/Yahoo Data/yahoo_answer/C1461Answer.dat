k03dYskYaa	Such skeptics are not usually persons who are really concerned about the Creator or interested in serving him, but rather they want a basis on which to divorce themselves from faith and its requirements. It is not that they are interested in Gods purpose or where they fit in the stream of time, but rather in the results to themselves. Actually their question is well answered in the Scriptures, which reveal that it is not God, but his agelong opposer Satan who is causing the misery and distress from which people suffer, while God is doing something and those who serve him are doing something, pointing men to the only real remedy for the situation, Gods Kingdom government.

9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	I think it's absolutely fair to say that most people would rather you agree with their world view without question.  Most people hold their particular world view because they think it's correct, regardless of whether or not they've critically analyzed their beliefs.  So for someone to disagree with their worldview and raise questions about it is to say that they could be incorrect about their view of their place in the world, which threatens their entire perspective and identity, which can be very frightening for many people.    Of course, there are also exceptions, and some people invite opposing views to compare to their own and choose what they feel is the best.    EDIT:  Well, I have, but I consider myself one of those exceptions that is open to opposing worldviews.  Most people are willing to change only at their own pace, which is often no change at all, but in any event they will fight opposing views as a matter of principle because they see the world as "right and wrong", with no allowance given to competing priorities and values which may be balanced.|`|CGr6EtRUaa	Yes, most people get hot under the collar if you question their fundamental beliefs.    Even in countries like the UK, which is a democracy, the whole point of which is that you should be able to ask questions.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	Yes.  But they can have the world and everything in it!

If I sit in my house everyday or my huge sofa with my huge screen in my nice country home & someone says that I have to leave to go work in an office I am in a panic. I don't want to leave this wonderful comfort zone. So many things change if I have to go somewhere else. There is no job that would be in a better atmosphere than my home so I don't want to go, I don't want to think about it I refuse....the truth is I could find out I am wrong & then I would wonder why I didn't leave before. But I will never know cause I refuse to open my mind to change.|`|fitsd4FGaa	Nobody likes their "authority" on matters taken into question.|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	I guess you could say that.

When all is said and done all of our world views are based on a certain level of faith and these views are typically held deeply.  For this reason, many have a tendency to become defensive when you question their world view.|`|dz5Og81Qaa	Of course, everyone prefers to be among like minded others. With that in common they are instant friends.|`|88adf0621d46a4d78324d57cbb47b1ceaa	yes, that or simply say nothing.

The service must be to any who need the assistance, without bias against race, creed, color or gender.    If, however (based on the statistics), if you exclude heterosexual Christians from working there, you won't get much in the way of volunteer help, and your charity program will fail before it ever gets off the ground, since most charities are "faith based" and staffed, funded, and run by heterosexual Christians.    Good luck, however.  No ill will towards anyone trying to meet the needs of others, since that is the definition of the Christian religion, according to the Bible: to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, house the homeless, bring comfort to those who mourn, etc.    So, just out of curiousity, if you eliminate the Christian definition of religion, and you are no longer helping the hungry, naked, homeless and those who are mourning, then who WILL you help?  What kind of charity WILL you set up, since you flat out reject Christ and His Word?    And who will even help you in your task?    Sounds like you've dug yourself into a hole and can't get out!  That's far worse than painting yourself into a corner!    Didn't you even bother planning ahead, or thinking things through?  Is this what we can expect from the homosexual community (or those who support the homosexual community)?      Your expectations fall flat.

It would be interesting to see discrimination go the other way for a change.|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	If your charity is based on a faith other than Christianity, then certainly you have the right to refuse to hire Christians.|`|fEkKuGlEaa	Go ahead. I've worked in Christian organizations and a lot of times, it's just a bad fit to have a non-Christian if they need to be able to give input on matters of theology, ecclesiology, etc. If they are doing technical work, however, like accounting, there's no good reason not to hire them.     So you do what you like as long as it's good for the charity.|`|5RH9Osdsaa	Frustrating, isn't it?  The problem is that Christian-based charities are entitled to their freedom of religion.  You could start a charity that would not hire heterosexuals, because sexual orientation is not currently a protected class under federal law (although depending where you live, you could run afoul of state law).  You would have a much harder time discriminating against Christians, because religion is protected.  Your charity (if its religion-based) could possibly refuse to hire anyone of a different religion from you.|`|2671bdab4ecc3e9bb1c0c6539cea42f1aa	Fair but immature.

And through the darkness of unbelief, he descends to the lowest of the low and falls to a position fit for Hell. For belief connects man to the All-Glorious Maker; it is a relation. Thus, man acquires value by virtue of the Divine art and inscriptions of the dominical Names which become apparent in him through belief. Unbelief severs the relation, and due to that severance the dominical art is concealed. His value then is only in respect to the matter of his physical being. And since this matter has only a transitory, passing, temporary animal life, its value is virtually nothing.|`|d9cB8yN8aa	Celibacy, if you're catholic.

When we have "faith" we are standing on what we truly believe. The transformation from belief to faith takes place in our mind first.  It is evidenced by the actions we take because we believe in an outcome or result that we cannot see with our five senses. It is our actions that provide the evidence to ourself and others about what we truly believe.    Faith and fear have the same definition: the belief in an outcome that we cannot see in advance. Faith gives hope and leads to life. Fear destroys hope and leads to death.|`|AA10096992	To man in general, nothing.

I don't know who the bozos are that gave him thumbs down. Faith gives we who believe direction and purpose. Knowing that there is something else after death is comforting. Faith provides a comforting feeling that although we have never seen God or his miracles (as in the Bible) we know that He does exist. If you can look in the mirror you are looking at a miracle. It is a shame that so many people don't have faith only because its the "cool" thing to do.|`|9X0nHkdWaa	A pointless life

The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	The Holy Eucharist is the most important of the seven sacraments because, in this and in no other sacrament, we receive the very body and blood, soul and divinity of Jesus Christ. Innumerable, precious graces come to us through the reception of Holy Communion.     Communion is an intimate encounter with Christ, in which we sacramentally receive Christ into our bodies, that we may be more completely assimilated into his.    The Eucharist also strengthens the individual because in it Jesus himself, the Word made flesh, forgives our venial sins and gives us the strength to resist mortal sin. It is also the very channel of eternal life: Jesus himself.     In Johns gospel, Jesus summarized the reasons for receiving Communion when he said:     "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is real food, and my blood is real drink. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats me will live because of me. This is the bread which came down from heaven, not such as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread will live forever" (John 6:5358).|`|LJlaHLQdaa	Anglican  In many of the provinces and national jurisdictions of the Anglican Church, the Eucharist is designated as the principal service of the Church. The service for Holy Eucharist is found in the Book of Common Prayer for each national Church in the Anglican Communion. The Anglican Church holds the Eucharist as the highest form of worship, the Church's main service. Daily celebrations are now the case in most cathedrals and many parish churches, and there are few churches with a priest where Holy Communion is not celebrated at least once every Sunday. The nature of the ritual with which it is celebrated, however, varies according to the orientation of the individual parish, diocese or national Church.  ______________________________________...    Among Eastern Christians, the Eucharistic service is called the Divine Liturgy. It comprises two main divisions: the first is the Liturgy of the Catechumens which consists of introductory litanies, antiphons and scripture readings, culminating in a reading from one of the Gospels and often, a sermon; the second is the Liturgy of the Faithful in which the Eucharist is offered, consecrated, and received as Holy Communion. Within the latter, the actual Eucharistic prayer is called the anaphora, literally: "offering" or "carrying up". In the Byzantine Rite, two different anaphoras are currently used: one is attributed to St. John Chrysostom, and the other to St. Basil the Great. Among the Oriental Orthodox, a variety of anaphoras are used, but all are similar in structure to those of the Byzantine Rite. In the Byzantine Rite, the Anaphora of St. John Chrysostom is used most days of the year; St. Basil's is offered on the Sundays of Great Lent, the eves of Christmas and Theophany, Holy Thursday, Holy Saturday, and upon his feast day (January 1). At the conclusion of the Anaphora the bread and wine are held to be the Body and Blood of Christ.    Conventionally this change in the elements is understood to occur at the Epiklesis (Greek: "invocation") by which the Holy Spirit is invoked and the consecration of the bread and wine as the Body and Blood of Christ is specifically requested, but since the anaphora as a whole is considered a unitary (albeit lengthy) prayer, no one moment within it can be readily singled out.  ______________________________________...    The Church of England is the officially established Christian church in England, the Mother Church of the worldwide Anglican Communion and the oldest among the communion's thirty-eight independent national and regional churches.    The Church of England understands itself to be both Catholic and Reformed:     Catholic in that it views itself as a part of the universal church of Christ in unbroken continuity with the early apostolic and later medi?val church. This is expressed in its strong emphasis on the teachings of the early Church Fathers, in particular as formalised in the Apostolic, Nicene and Athanasian creeds.    Reformed to the the extent that it has been influenced by some of the doctrinal principles of the 16th century Protestant Reformation. The more Reformed character finds expression in the Thirty-Nine Articles of religion, established as part of the settlement of religion under Queen Elizabeth I. The customs and liturgy of the Church of England, as expressed in the Book of Common Prayer, are based on older Catholic tradition but have been moderately influenced by Reformation liturgical and doctrinal principles.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	The essence of the Catholic Mass is a recreation of the Last Supper. When Jesus gave His disciples His body symbolized by the bread and gave them wine symbolizing His blood to be spilled for us.  Some Christian denominations have done away with that concept altogether and some have just held on to the bread or Eucharist. While others have both the wine and bread.  Today Christian, Anglican and the Church of England, and Roman Catholics as well as Greek orthodox are all synonymous in the sense that all believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who came to earth to show us how to live a good life.|`|bsHkZH1kaa	The igitur, clementissime Pater, per Jesum Christum Filium tuum Dominum nostrum, supplices rogamus ac petimus, uti accepta habeas, et benedicas haec + dona, haec + munera, haec + santca sacrificia illibata, in primis quae tibi offerimus pro Ecclesia tuna sancta catholica: quam pacificare, custodire, adunare, et regere digneris toto orbe terrarum: una *** famulo tuo Papa nostro.

Haec quotiescumque feceritis, in mei memoriam facietis."      HAEC commixtio et conscecratio Corporis et Sanguinis Domini nostri Jesu Christi fiat accipientibus nobis in vitam aeternam. Amen.

Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, dona nobis pacem."|`|AA11440601	At the Last Supper, Jesus said, Take this bread. It is my body. Then he said, Take this and drink. This is my blood. Do this in memory of me.     Catholics believe this was the First Eucharist, that through a miracle the bread and wine actually became the body and blood of Jesus Christ.    Catholics reenact the Last Supper during every Mass, where God, acting through the priest, changes the bread and wine into the body and blood of Jesus Christ.    This is a great sacrament of thanksgiving and unity of Catholics.    By the way, the Eastern Catholic, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox Churches, the Assyrian Church of the East, the Lutheran and many Anglican Churches also believe in the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist. This is more than half of all Christians in the world.    For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, sections 1322 and following: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt2s...

Look it up - stop relying on YA users to do your homework for you.|`|Q2aikWjUaa	Here is what Saint Ignatius said regarding:    Transubstantiation-  "They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer, because they confess not the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Savior Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again. Those, therefore, who speak against this gift of God, incur death in the midst of their disputes."(Letter to the Smymaeans Chapter VII)    The Bodily ressurrection of Christ-  "For I know that after His [Christ's] ressurrection also He was still posessed of flesh, and I believe that he is so now [Keep in mind that he is writing years AFTER Jesus ascended to Heaven]. (Letter to the Smyrnaeans Chapter III)    Regarding Christ's Deity-  "Ye have done well in recieving Philo and Rheus Agathopus as servants of Christ our God, who have followed me for the sake of God, and who give thanks to the Lord in your behalf, because you in every way have refreshed them." (Letter to the Smyrnaeans Chapter X)    Please don't say that this man wasn't inspired, or that this man was not in harmoney with the Bible. This man was a personal friend of Saint Peter, and studied Christ under Saint John. He wrote these letters on his way to Rome where he was EATEN BY LIONS. Saint Ignatius was the Second (or third) Bishop of Antioch, the First place where Christians were called Christians.    Saint Ignatius knew what the Apostles knew about Jesus, and his works come from the same time period as the Books of the Bible.    When a First Century Christian believes this, why doen't you, and why do you refer to these Martyrs as your First Century Christian Brothers    Vs 54, "Whoever eats My flesh, and drinks My blood, has eternal life; and I will   raise him up on the last day." Did He say to eat the symbol of His flesh?   Vs 55, Jesus said, "For My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed."     Vs 56, Jesus said, "He that eats My flesh and drinks My blood dwells in Me, and I in him."   Did He say, 'He that eats a symbol of My flesh...'. How can a mere symbol fulfill this promise?   Does only a symbol of Christ dwell in us? I thought GOD Himself dwelt within us, 1John 4:12-13.   Vs 59, This verse shows that Jesus taught this discourse to all the people.   Vs 60, They doubt a third time when many disciples said, "This is a hard saying, who can hear it"?   The Jews were instilled by many Old Testament verses, admonishing them not to consume blood.   See Deut 12:23, Lev 17:11and 14. They must have thought this was something akin to cannibalism.   Is this what you think too?   At any point did Jesus back down? Explain to me, if this chapter is symbolic, why did He not explain the symbolism to them?   Vs 61, Jesus did not back down, for He said, "Does this offend you?"   He knew their thoughts and He certainly knew the Old Testament verses about the consumption of blood.   In the next verse, He separated spiritual things from earthly things.   Vs 63*, Jesus said, "It is the spirit that quickens; the flesh profits nothing. The words I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life."   Did He say He was speaking figuratively or in parables? This is the second verse detractors use to try to "prove" that Jesus spoke figuratively for the whole chapter. Did Jesus say "My" flesh? No, He said "the" flesh. What Jesus had said was, that we cannot accept this mystery if we accept it in too human a way, by having an earthly view of things. Those who can only think of cannibalism, are they not having an earthly view?   See John 3:6, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit." Verse 63 means that we should not have a carnal human understanding of His words, but a spiritual understanding.       In John, chapter 6, Jesus had not only called the 12 Apostles, there was also much larger group of other disciples. Things seemed to be going pretty well. That is until Jesus said For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. This was too much for many of his disciples and From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. Jesus turns to the 12 and asks, Will ye also go away? Simon Peter gives the same answer that I find myself saying to those who tell me I should leave the Catholic Church for this reason or that one, Lord, to whom shall we go? No matter what a certain priest does, no matter what scandals hit the church, despite whatever corruption or abuse of power might exist, and despite whatever mistakes the Church has made throughout history, to whom shall we go? for here is the body and blood of Christ given for a sinner as miserable as I.       Matt. 26:26-28; Mark. 14:22,24; Luke 22;19-20; 1 Cor. 11:24-25 - Jesus says, this IS my body and blood. Jesus does not say, this is a symbol of my body and blood.    MattMatt. 26:26; Mark. 14:22; Luke 22:19-20 - the Greek phrase is "Touto estin to soma mou." This phraseology means "this is actually" or "this is really" my body and blood.     You do the math. If that's not enough...see:        John 6:4,11-14 - on the eve of the Passover, Jesus performs the miracle of multiplying the loaves. This was prophesied in the Old Testament (e.g., 2 Kings4:43), and foreshadows the infinite heavenly bread which is Him.    Matt. 14:19, 15:36; Mark 6:41, 8:6; Luke 9:16 - these passages are additional accounts of the multiplication miracles. This points to the Eucharist.     Matt. 16:12 - in this verse, Jesus explains His metaphorical use of the term "bread." In John 6, He eliminates any metaphorical possibilities.     John 6:4 - Jesus is in Capernaum on the eve of Passover, and the lambs are gathered to be slaughtered and eaten.

Study them for Your self!|`|wxBFZ41Taa	Catholics understand that the Eucharist is true Body and Blood of Christ. We know this for many reasons. The first being, Jesus told us so. He said "unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, you cannot have life within you." The word Jesus used for "eat" was the literal word for "gnaw" and "chew." There were words that could have been used more figuratively, but he didn't use them. In fact when his followers questioned what he meant, he gave them more literal terms not figurative.    At the Last Supper Jesus shows his disciples "how" they will eat his body and drink his blood. The Passover ritual had specific things said and done, he breaks from this and says "take, eat, this is my body which is broken for you, do this in rememberance of me." Here again, he doesn't say this is a symbol of my body...he say it IS my body. Using literal terms. The Greek word used for "rememberance" is only used a few times in Scripture and always in conjunction with sacrifice.     Also, it is important that he did this at a Passover meal...not just any meal. Look in the OT about the Passover. The Jews were instructed to kill a perfect, unblemished, young lamb. They were to sprinkle it's blood over their doorways, they were to cook and eat the lamb, if they had too much they were to get together with other families and finish the lamb, becuase none could be leftover. It was important that they consume the sacrificed lamb...if they did not they would die because the angel of death would not pass them over.    So when Jesus instituted the Eucharist, he did so in such a way that it made perfect sense. We would consume the sacrificed lamb (Jesus) in an unbloody way. He became for us the sacrifice, shared in bread and wine. Look up the Melchizedek in the Old Testament. He gave a "sacrifice of bread and wine." Also Melchizedek is mentioned again in Psalm 110: The Lord has sworn, and he will not repent: You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek (110:4). This psalm is considered one of the most important of the Messianic psalms, identifying the forthcoming Messiah, our Lord Jesus Christ, as King, Priest, and Conqueror.     http://www.catholiceducation.org/article...    The Early Christians also believed in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Many of the writings pre-date or are contemporaries of the New Testament writers.     http://www.therealpresence.org/eucharst/...  http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/news...  http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/religi...  http://www.infpage.com/concordance/eucha...    I don't know much abuot Anglican and Church of England. They are both considered Protestant faiths, as are all non-Catholic Christian faiths. Catholics are Christians so you can't seperate out Christian from Catholic, there are many, many non-Catholic enominations. Most of them, as far as I know, believe that Jesus spoke figuratively and that communion is a memorial in which we remember his sacrifice. This does not explain though, St. Paul's warning in 1 Cor 11:23-29    23 For I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night he was handed over, took bread,   24 and, after he had given thanks, broke it and said, "This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me."   25 In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me."   26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord until he comes.   27 Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will have to answer for the body and blood of the Lord.   28 A person should examine himself, and so eat the bread and drink the cup.   29 For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself.       Those are pretty strong words if it is only a figurative memorial ritual.|`|HyfZ7s2Eaa	The eucharist is representorial of Jesus' body. Catholics believe it is incredibly important because they believe the eucharist is Jesus, its not just a representation. In the same way air is air and yet also a gas, so the eucharist is bread and yet also Gods body. Differing from Catholics, the Church of England think that the eucharist is just a way to represent Jesus body, it is not as blessed or as incredible as Catholics believe. Other christian dominions such as methodists dont use the eucharist. They use normal bread as they replay the last supper when Jesus broke the bread.|`|xI48JiUUaa	The Eucharist is imprtant because Christ is there, on all his divinity|`|BJERgbM5aa	According to Roman Catholic Rite, the Eucharist is the symbolic embodiment of Jesus Christ.

YIW1KIi6aa	1)Introduction about the topic :    What is mercy killing?Mercy killing or Euthanasia is nothing but the  practice of killing a person or animal,in a painless or minimally painful way,  for merciful reasons,usually to end suffering of a patient before death.In wider  sense it depicts assisting sufferers to commit sudden death rather than suffering  from long,in particular physician-assisted suicide.    In some cases,Mercy killing has been legalized in Netherlands,Belgium,  but in no other countries.There are many other reasons that why mercy killing  is not the best resort and also why it is beneficial in some cases.This decision  is based on the patients' rights and dignity,doctors' rights,religious beliefs,society's views,  morality and other resolutions available.    Now requesting all of you to give positive/negative opinion regarding mercy killing.    2)Opinions against of mercy killing :    i) Scoetiy's view:Active euthanasia is akin to murder    The term which is basically synonymous with the phrase "mercy killing" that is  Euthanasia.The term Euthanasia is a greek term,which means "good death".  But many people aren't finding anything good about Euthonesia except its name  meaning "good death".As commonly defined and used, euthanasia involves that  actions of one party to hasten the death of another,so many people of today's world  are not cosidering mercy killing as merciful,in their view mercy killing is also a kind  of killing or murder process.    ii) Society's view:Family persons may misuse this:    They are also right that "mercy killing" might be abused  by some families.To get property they may ask doctor to kill the eldest family person  by this method.And as corruption is everywhere,so this may happen true.In such case  only the patient will be victim.    3)Morality:    Not all killing is murder in a strict legal sense, but euthanasia defintiely comes quite close as there is premeditation, intent, and action.The only place I can justify the taking of a human life is the case of capital punishment for murder.I know of no cases where the victim of euthanasia was a convicted murderer.Most often it is a person terminally ill or in great pain or suffering some other seriously debilitating and irreversible condition which makes death look preferrable. The problem is that we live in community, and are inherently relational beings.Our life is a gift given from a source quite apart from us.Life is a trust.Suicide, 'assisted suicide,' euthanasia, and homicide all have in common an action taken to end a human life.Motives and methods do not change the outcome.That we do it because we care;that we do it 'gently' does not alter the fact that a life ends unnaturally.    So on the point of morality,major part of common people are thinking that everyone's life has quality,no matter what their social status is.Life is a gift from God and only God can take it from us.If you allow exceptions to the principle that human life is scared, you weaken the principle itself.Only a minor part of population is able to expend any amount they can to stave off death,even when there is no hope for recovery.But major part of peopple are not able to maintain treatment with huge cost.There are those - and their number is growing - who opt to receive neither treatment nor hastening death.They choose to allow nature to take its own course.They are just given medication only to ease their visible suffering, but that's not enough to prevent respiratory failure.They have chosen wisdom over knowledge.Theirs is truly death with dignity.Coz they enjoy each and every moment of life till his/her last breath.    4)In favour of the topic:    It is an important question in today's society that whether mercy killing is really merciful or not.I think mercy killing is an exceptional type of killing method.    E.g.,Maja, a married lady said in an article published on 23rd may,2005 that she forced her husband to kill a hummingbird.Because,their neighborhood cat had it and made half-killed, but just kept playing with it while it was horribly suffering.And it became extremely painful/severe condition for the half-dead bird.So Maja requested her husband to kill the bird with knife and he did.---So this can be said as mercy killing and it is not wrong.Her husband killed the bird to give it relieve from severe pain.  But u all may say that the humming bird is an animal and we are human being.So,both can't get treated in same manner.    So,i m giving another example is,if a cancer patient is suffering fromintolerable pain few hours before his/her definite death and doctor is also declaring that he will survive maximum few hours more----he will just suffer now with this pain and gradually he'll die with hours.In case of such patient,it is really tough for the patient to count his time with such king of severe pain.And it is really meaningless to suffer with this kind of intolerable pain specially when death after few hours is definite.Only In such a|`|16EYP0Xiaa	Four words:    Do Your Own Homework|`|1EHmi2Y1aa	Definitely yes.

NZ0mRaG3aa	God knows what will happen, because of his foreknowledge, but doesn't control people. So if they do wrong it isn't because He willed it. If He brought it about that would make him a sinner, and christians believe God is pure. You can learn about God and align yourself with his will. Sin is going against God's will and we all have done it. Some people (calvinists) believe that certain people are predestined to salvation and others are not - a not very pleasant view of things, I think. Some people by virtue of the way they are brought up and influences etc are more likely to become christians; that kind of unfair situation is part of price of free will.    An example from Jesus ministry is the failure of the disciples to heal a man's epileptic son whilst Jesus was away with Peter, James and John. When he came down from the mountain he expressed annoyance at their lack of faith, and then healed the lad. So it was God's will to heal. The failure of the disciples to heal him wasn't God's will.  Christians often pray to change things as well. If they don't pray then the things won't change. God needs our faith to establish His will on the earth.|`|7w9zXLGMaa	thats what i used to ask myself.. led me to become an informed person... in other words an atheist :D|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You are wrong from head to toe.    You just do not believe God that you are responsible, that it is good that you are alive , that He means well for you.    All just rotten unbelief pretending to be piety.|`|RermzbWgaa	While I agree that things are predetermined, much of what was said is not fully correct (a bit of a warping of the reality).    God created us for His glory, and to enjoy Him (but that is larger than "ONLY to worship him").  The Lord could punish us because we are born accursed, and of a nature of sin.  We sin immediately and constantly.  It is our nature.   While things are predetermined it is still of our will to sin.  We choose sin and evil not God (He is not the author or cause of sin).   I do not fight for the concept of free will however as some might, because as they conceive it.....it does not exist.  If a person is a slave to sin (and we are) then their will is to sin and not do good.  Only God can change that will so as to desire good.  The sinner however is still responsible for even though he followed his nature he willed to sin, and did so with no supernatural push to do so.    In other words....while I would subscribe to some of what you say....I am not a fatalist.    (I am a Reformed Christian, or Calvinist, most other Christian theology would not agree with me....and would insist our wills are completely free).|`|b94573ef3c2d94b3f4ddd867c8a6cc47aa	Yup.|`|k4WlqPK7aa	it saddens me to watch a debate on the intentions of a fictional deity.|`|EM0kiImHaa	I'm a christian and this is basically what I believe as well.

Because hindu exremist have said they must convert back to hinduism or be killed if they are seen back at home again. They probably comverted in part to escape the caste system. But are they really by the will of the hindu gods to be doomed to clean out loos etc.    Sri Lanka. Buddhists are forcing legislation through parliament that makes it illegal to try and convert someone out of Buddhism. A lot of churches have been burnt in recent years.    Burma. Tribes such as the Karen who converted to christianity are being systematically persecuted by the regime. The ordinary  Buddhist citizens are not bothered since they are not buddhists. This has gone on for 10 or 20 years.    North Korea - communism, which is an atheist philosophy of  social organisation. If a person is found to be a christian they are sent to a labour camp, where they normally die early due to lack of food and hard labour.    Stalin in USSR, Mao in china, Pol Pot in Cambodia killed millions in social engineering or punishment for failing to be a good atheist/communist. Probably 15 million or more christians killed in Mao's China for refusing to renounce Christ.    Don't think the Jews have done much persecuting others recently.

The Chinese is historically xenophobic. They use skin tone to measure beauty. (My looney aunts used to call me fat but would always compliment me on my pale skin.) They don't like the Japanese because of WWII. I've never heard of them thinking white teachers are better though. My parents used to say Chinese teachers are better because they taught respect.    Like I said, this is only my experience with the older generations. People my age who live in China are more liberal and progressive in their thinking and attitudes.|`|gtvuQ1BHaa	chinese people are usually really racist about 'darker' people, even if you are chinese but just with darker skin,     my mum told me that there was a myth or kind of an assumption that, : 'asians with dark skin are farmers, which means they are poor and work in the sun alot.   which means that they are lowerclass.     asians dont normally like to  mix with people lower than their class.  its a culture thing.|`|YkseyT7zaa	Racism exist in every culture|`|HIMwyeZqaa	There are 3 billion people in China.  I'm sure you can find any racial view in abundance.   My Chinese stepsister loves her white stepfather as I love my Chinese stepmother.  I call that a good thing.  There is nothing wrong with liking white people.  Why are you down on white people?  Sorry, I was way too knee jerk.    Perhaps, they hang out with whites for the same reason that you do.|`|MgdQ1PGcaa	iv never noticed this. i have many asian friends and know theyre families very well, iv never heard them talk ill about another race.    maybe its just the region your in?|`|NBXY35zPaa	If you dig into the Asian community, you'll find out that practically all Asians are prejudice against other Asians (Chinese, Cambodian, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, etc).
AA10702349	Good question.     Yes, us Christians can be talking about God to others in a way that doesn't reflect Who He is by our actions (i.e., being pushy and not have a listening spirit), even when what we are saying is the truth. That certainly doesn't help matters with those who continue to reject Christ.     However, as you can see by many of the answers here, it's really not as much about being a poor witness towards others. Many have said here that they won't believe in Christ because they think that the Bible is a mythical book, and/or even that Jesus couldn't possibly be Whom the gospels claim Him to be: Lord and Savior; that's even if they believe He existed at all! However, it is apparent to me that none of these folks who refuse to believe in Him could have possibly, and sincerely, looked into these claims of Jesus and to the historical authenticity of the Bible.     Why do I say this? Well, because 1) even secular historians of antiquity have written about His existence (e.g., Josephus), 2) archeologists, historians and linguists have shown that ALL of the books of the New Testament must have been written within at least a generation of Christ's ministry, which would have made any false claims written in these books to His physical existence, death and resurrection automatically known to even the church at that time, let alone to that unbelieving generation; and, lastly, 3) there have been many religious martyrs in history who died for what they have believed to be true. However, in Christianity, the disciples of Jesus, and about 500 others, died a martyr's death either for what they KNEW to be the truth or a lie (since they claimed to all be witnesses to His life, death, resurrection), and NOT for just what they believed to be true, as in other religions, such as in Islam. So, I ask you, why would 500+ people be so zealously faithful and die a martyr's death over what they KNEW to be false? That just doesn't even make any sense! (See Lee Strobel's book, "The Case For Christ".)    So, given their apparent ignorance to these facts and issues, it seems to me that their very weak intellectual arguments are rather just a smokescreen for simply not wanting to face the possibility of any compelling evidence to the claims of Christ and the historical authenticity of the Bible, which would then inevitably and inconveniently place them in a crisis concerning their present direction and purpose in life; plain and simple! The Bible says that ALL of us have chosen to go our own way (Isaiah 53:6), and that none of us seek after God (Psalm 52:2-3; Romans 3:11). One way that we even deceive ourselves into thinking that we sincerely have sought Him, without finding Him, is to construct such outlandishly spurious intellectual arguments. Another way, as another answerer has said, is to say that we need to see a miracle before we believe. (Despite such arrogance, may God be so gracious as to show him or her one! ;-)) This is just another way to avoid one's responsibility to search for Him and the truth. And just whom do we think we are fooling? Only ourselves, of course; most likely to our own demise!|`|7Bj4AAo8aa	You can't be Muslim if you reject the Messiah.    However, calling Jesus Christ(pbuh) as GOD is a catastrophe and must be rejected.|`|HBp5r76haa	People's evil nature, wicked mind and hardened heart have nothing to do with what we do or say (and before you say anything, yes, I know that Christians can be this way, too)  It's about time you stop feeling guilty because they do not want to see the truth.    You know what I think? We *are* supposed to brag about Christ. And then let God do His work on people. I think I don't brag enough about the stuff He has brought me through    Have a blessed day|`|QwKiK85eaa	We choose too  There are so many religions out there claiming that their god or gods are the true ones, they all have holy books confirming this, and they all have no outside evidence to even hint at they are correct in their claims. Why should I hold any one of them in higher regard to the rest? Because they have some historically correct aspects to it? So did the movie Forrest Gump. Because so many people believe in one? At one point in time everyone believed the world was flat, that didn't make it true. Because I'd be better off believing in one and being wrong than not believing and it existing? How would I know which one to pick, and if I picked the wrong one wouldn't that just anger the true god? Not to mention the fact that I can't force myself to believe in anything, and I'm sure that any god wouldn't look to kindly on someone believing in them just to save themselves.    And while I don't consider myself to be an atheist, until any other religion can obtain some outside evidence of their claims I will continue believing what I currently believe.        lmao you christian people keep giving me thumbs down just ignore the truth all you want|`|47sALOGfaa	Jesus is nothing more than a character in a fairy tale.    There is not a single shred of credible evidence of your god incarnate walking this Earth.    Where are all of the eyewitness, first hand accounts of Jesus working his fancy magiks?  Sure, you have your cult guide book but even those accounts of Jesus were written decades after his supposed fancy magik working and death.  In addition, you have to realize the your cult guide book is not evidence that your cult guide book is right.    Surely there would be countless written accounts of THE GAWD walking the Earth by the secular scholars of the time if it had actually happened.    In addition, by stating in your question and details that you only want cultists to answer is probably the surest way to get non cultists to answer.  You don't get to decide who answers your questions.  If you only want opinions from people that agree with you and will simply confirm what you already believe then go to a site dedicated to cultists.|`|ZXUZxPwYaa	\You are better getting the non christian thoughts...but go on|`|a48cfffc5a668f8ee11c890acdaf3ccfaa	It's not so much as they are rejecting Jesus and his teachings, as they are rejecting his fan club.|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	I'll give you the inside scoop.

If it isn't falsifiable, I will not accept it.|`|gbBJ2q1Qaa	I reject the tooth fairy too.    Atheists don't believe in a higher power; therefore, we don't reject it as we view it as something that doesn't exist.|`|E870WbAsaa	Jesus (May peace be upon him) was the mighty prophet of God   :)|`|aPuj6xoHaa	By our natural rebellious nature we do not seek after God:    Romans 3:10-12  as it is written: "None is righteous, no, not one;   no one understands; no one seeks for God.   All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one."     Romans 1:19-25  For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.   For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.   For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.   Claiming to be wise, they became fools,   and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.   Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,   because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.     Romans 3:23  for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,     Romans 6:23  For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.      ------  Matthew 28:19-20  Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age."       Yes, Christians struggle against pride and do we share our faith the way Jesus did?  No, but we keep trying and allow God to use us as He chooses, and that is why we need Jesus so desperately, we are still sinners but we trust in the salvation of Christ!|`|qGNkB2Ipaa	I think they reject him because they are so caught up whit science and TECHNOLOGY that they worship technology itself because they say it's so accurate and saying that it was all created by a "big boom"    Some People ask who created god?  some people answer;  A bigger god    but my question for them would be,  then who created that bigger god,  and that bigger god?  and that one!?    There is no bigger God!    God is ALL!    God doesn't send People to Hell.. they send themselves.    Atheist Just believe in science and worship science and they say  science is the answer to everything.    But How could everything be created by itself?    that's impossible!    Somebody made it!  God did!      it couldn't have just been all created by itself!  That's a stupid theory.    I would most likely believe that it was created by someone.    Why can't scientist study on the present and the future  and not at the past! Help the economy! don't try to figure out what happened.    make fuel efficient cars!     The bible had all of the answers for the past but people did'nt believe!  Like the Bible said that the earth was round.. and everyone thought it wasn't. Til Christobal Colon had to show EVREYBODY that it was.. instead of just reading the bible and believeing...    Christians are here to help god try to help people go to the our side,God's side, the good side.    If you tell one of your friends about god and they reject you, there not rejecting you, theyre rejecting God.      Thats all i have to say about that. o.o|`|DB9QbZoQaa	Do you claim commission to dress the vine?

I thought believing in Him was good enough, I thought it was ok to do what I wanted to do as long as I believed.  Then I found out that it was more than that and at the time I was going through the worst trial of my life and it still is to this day so I blamed God and I was mad at Him so I did not surrender to Him.  You are absolutely right about having Gods spirit in us and letting God work.  A lot of times we get so frustrated and want to tell people about the Lord and we get a little forceful.  God put such a wonderful lady in my life and she talked of Gods love but more importantly she showed me through her actions and fruits of her spirit that she was 100% sold out to the Lord and she just glowed and I wanted that. God took a hold of me and I gave my life to Him and now He will not let me go and I don't want Him to,  Sometimes the only bible that people will ever read is us.  We are to be Christlike and love those around us including our enemies and be the light of the world.  That is how we win souls over.  I do admit with my loved ones I do show more tough love but God is working on me with that.  Take care and God bless you.  I read some answers and I hear how people cannot believe in something that you can't see.  That is what faith is.  In Hebrews 11:1  Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the things NOT YET SEEN.    As a Christian I might not see him in the flesh but I have faith He is with me.  I know He is with me.  As far as not seeing Him, everyday when I go outside and look at the beautiful blue sky or the mountains that surround my city, or the first time I laid eyes on my children the day they were born.  I saw God in each of those things.  He is real and He loves everyone of us so much that He became flesh and walked among us and shed His innocent blood to pay for a debt He did not owe.  Would anyone of us die for someone we love willingly?|`|k4WlqPK7aa	his inability to exist is the main reason.|`|hPQurfluaa	Pride Selfishness.   We all do it. Their is none righteous, no not one.

As1 Cor. 10:5 we need to capture every thought to God's obedience.    It's important to meditate on God's promises so that we CAN keep our thoughts on Him.    Edit: The bible does say that those who meditate on His Word will have success in all that they do and His Word also causes us to experience Christ's perfect peace.    One verse says grace and peace to you through the knowledge of Him.     Some may think it weird to do a form of meditation but the true Bible meaning of meditation means to roll something over in your mind again and again. Just write a verse on a note card and look at it when you need to. It becomes a habit and it is much easier to keep your focus where you find your happiness.    Edit again :~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>I'm going to do a mini study on some of these verses :  Psa 1:1   How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, Nor stand in the path of sinners, Nor sit in the seat of scoffers!    Psa 1:2  But his delight is in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night.    Psa 1:3  He will be like a tree {firmly} planted by streams of water, Which yields its fruit in its season And its leaf does not wither; And in whatever he does, he prospers.    Psa 119:11  Your word I have treasured in my heart, That I may not sin against You.    Psa 119:35  Make me walk in the path of Your commandments, For I delight in it.    Psa 119:72  The law of Your mouth is better to me Than thousands of gold and silver {pieces.}    Psa 119:92  If Your law had not been my delight, Then I would have perished in my affliction.    Job 23:12  "I have not departed from the command of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.    Jer 15:16  Your words were found and I ate them, And Your words became for me a joy and the delight of my heart; For I have been called by Your name, O LORD God of hosts.    Psa 119:97  O how I love Your law! It is my meditation all the day.    1Ti 4:15  Take pains with these things; be {absorbed} in them, so that your progress will be evident to all.    http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/tr...    http://www.angelfire.com/sc3/myredeemer/...

LDL5rlapaa	I have been a volunteer for along time, it is a great feeling to help someone in need, In the Bible Jesus said there is no greater gift than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends, when you volunteer to help someone seeking nothing in return you are giving all you can give,, it speaks volumes about a person and what kind of heart they have, volunteering help change my life, I personally believe it would help anyone to be a better person.

We can't "talk" with animals because animals don't have language in the human sense (although some apes can be taught a bit of sign language). Ants, for example, communicate by chemical signals that are sophisticated in their way but don't have the remotest similarity to the conceptual language that humans use. Even if there were some way to understand other animals, I don't think it would be very interesting, since most creatures devote themselves exclusively to eating and reproducing.    Finding evidence of past life on Mars would be hugely exciting because it would show that the development of life is not a rare event and would increase our confidence that there are a lot of inhabited worlds in the universe. (Communicating with *them*, now, there's another problem!)

[Although the Imamate Question' is a matter of secondary importance, since it has been given excessive importance, and because of its relevance to our basic duties towards the Qur'an and belief, it is in part discussed here in regard to this and to its being a subject considered in the sciences of theology (qalam) and the principles of religion.]         In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.    Now has come a prophet from among yourselves; it heavily weighs upon him that you might suffer; full of concern is he for you, and full of compassion and mercy towards the believers. * But if they turn away, say: God is enough for me, there is no god but He. In Him have I placed my trust, for He is the Sustainer of the Mighty Throne. * Say: I ask no recompense of you save love of close kin.    We shall point out in two Stations' two of the many vast truths contained in these glorious verses.    First Station    The First Station consists of four Points.'     FIRST POINT   This describes the Most Noble Prophet's (Peace and blessings be upon him) perfect compassion and mercy towards his Community. According to sound narrations, when at the terror of the Resurrection everyone, and even the prophets, will cry out for themselves, the Most Noble Prophet will demonstrate his pity and compassion by calling out: "My Community! My Community!" Like, as affirmed by those who uncover the mysteries of creation, when he was born, his mother heard among his supplications the words: "My Community! My Community!" Also, the whole history of his life, as well as the kind and compassionate conduct which he propagated demonstrate his perfect compassion and clemency. So too through displaying an infinite need for the innumerable prayers of his Community, he showed a boundless compassion; for he showed that out of his perfect compassion he was concerned with the happiness of all of them. Thus, you can understand how lacking in gratitude and conscience it is not to observe the Practices of so kind and compassionate a leader.     SECOND POINT   Among the universal and general duties of his prophethood, the Most Noble Prophet (Peace and blessings be upon him) displayed great compassion in certain particular, minor matters. Superficially, his expending great compassion on such matters seems inappropriate to the supreme importance of the function of prophethood. But in reality minor matters such as those were the tips or samples of a chain which could be the means to the fulfilment of a universal and general function of prophethood. Therefore the greatest importance was given to the sample for the sake of the mighty chain.    For example, the extraordinary compassion the Most Noble Prophet (PBUH) showed towards Hasan and Husain in their childhood and the great importance he gave them was not only due to love arising from natural kindness and family feeling, it was rather because they were each the tip of a luminous thread of the function of prophethood, and the source, sample, and index of a community of great consequence which would receive the legacy of prophethood.    Indeed, the Most Noble Prophet (PBUH) used to take Hasan (May God be pleased with him) tenderly into his arms and kiss his head for the sake of the luminous, blessed, Mehdi-like descendents who would spring from him, like Shah Geylani, Ghawth al-A'zam, who would be the inheritors of prophethood and would bear the sacred Shari'a of Muhammed. He saw with the eye of prophethood the sacred service and duty they would perform in the future, and approved and applauded them. He kissed Hasan's head as a sign of approval and encouragement.    Also, he embraced Husain and showed him great importance and tenderness on account of the illustrious Imams like Zaynu'l-Abidin and Ja'far al-Sadiq, and the numerous Mehdi-like luminous persons, true inheritors of prophethood, who would spring from his effulgent line, and for the sake of the religion of Islam and functions of prophethood.     Since with his heart which had knowledge of the Unseen, the Prophet Muhammed's (PBUH) luminous vision and future-penetrating eye observed from the Era of Bliss in this world the Assembly of the Resurrection on the side of post-eternity, and from the earth saw Paradise, and watched events which had occurred since the time of Adam and were concealed in the dark veils of the past, and even received the vision of the All-Glorious One, he surely saw the spiritual poles and the Imams, who were the inheritors of prophethood, and the Mehdis, who would follow on in the lines of Hasan and Husain. And for sure he would kiss their heads in the name of all of them. Yes, Shah Geylani has a large part in his kissing Hasan's head.     THIRD POINT     http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2904&...|`|N8QLKpCMaa	here they have the same meanings but their interpretation may again vary , i agree with you !  specifically for imam and ahl e bayt.  as shiaa say they have 16 imam,  sunnis say 4,   the 1 imam of sunnis is accepted by shiaas.  both respect ahl e bayt but shiaas say that sunnis don't !  and much more.|`|0K9p9OPfaa	@o.--Shahky  Ramadan--.o :  Your just as bad as "anotherside".

I think that the only reason it is illegal is because the government doesn't have a way of regulating it or testing it when you are driving under the influence of it like they do for alcohol.    Anyway...It is it TONS better than alcohol because it doesn't kill your braincells like alcohol. Also, alcohol affects people different ways. One might become this happy go lucky person that loves everyone, but another person gets mean, and abuse their family or others. Pot just doesn't have effects like that. People are more laid back while on pot and it's basically the same effect for everyone. And, while alcohol and cigarettes and other drugs are very addictive, marijuana just is not, not matter what anyone says. I'm sorry I wouldn't sell my body or all of my possessions just for a dime bag like you would with other drugs.

tRcO5uyiaa	The answer to this question is pretty straightforward. It is the very same feeling when you get ignored. It doesn't feel good at all. It's like you're "invisible", even though you are standing right there in front of them. Your sister may only be 8 yrs old, but she has the same level of feelings and emotions that you do. If you ignore her, she will be just as hurt as if any of your friends ignored you. It just isn't a good situation any way you slice it. If you are having trouble relating to her, talk to your parents or some other adults who you can talk to comfortably and find out from them some ideas on how to communicate with your sister better. And if she annoys you, put a stop to it. The sooner the better. She has to learn that she has boundaries as well.    I don't mean sound hurtful or in any way cruel, but if you are 19, why are you still living at home with your parents and sibling? Don't you want to be out on your own and living independently? I mean, I guess my own experience is not a good comparison (I left my parent's house at age 16) but even at 19, I would still want my own place. Freedom, independence and no annoying sister. Just an observation.|`|3J61iXGDaa	It is mean/rude to ignore little kids. You really just need to be patient with them. You might find her annoying but alot of kids when they were 8 were always in peoples faces. They just want your attention. Try talking about school or what she likes to do when your not there.|`|6iuZEUhzaa	im just like w/e. i was quiet when i was 8.  for now, you just gotta like pretend to like her for a little. because when she's 10 she wont be annoying, she'll start adolescence.  also, just say u got a headache when its too severe.|`|9VaWal2Daa	How do you feel when people ignore YOU?  Pretty lousy right?     and little kids have less coping skills.   She's your sister.   Make some time for the kid.......she looks up to you.....idolizes you......wants to spend her time with you.     For gods sake.........don't brush her off........ya only have so many  family members  ya know......they might come in handy later in life, when she hates you, because you were mean to her as a kid.     Ya can't make up for being mean later........just avoid doing it NOW.     words to the wise.........|`|3urQfMffaa	depends on if i like them or not. if i don't, then i don't care. if i like them/idolize them, then it tears me apart.|`|5zVZaQrQaa	small talk...over something she likes. and maybe she'll go away.|`|9fec6a8704a864b61d3862874ce94967aa	Oh Lordie , I know just what you mean!    Give her/them ten minutes of your undivided attention and then start to blether on about something that is of no interest to her /them what so ever, such as the internal workings of the combustion engine.    If that doesn't work , it is ok to tell her/them  that you love her ( but not them; for them try like!) but that you need to spend time with your own thoughts.    It is something we all had to learn, but do make her/them feel important to you first.
2OO49bYsaa	It's actually accurate....       Proverbs 16:4      The Lord hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.    Romans 9:18      Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.    2 Thessalonians 2:11-12      God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned.|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	use of brain is incompatible with religious belief|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	God wants salvation for all. Its God's will that all be saved. Free will though is a person's right. God is all knowing, he knows who will harden themselves against him because of his free will, and who will not. However, its impossible to seek him and not find him. its impossible to question who he is and not find answers that lead you to him.    You have the right to do whatever you'd like to do. However theres no way around the fact that only faith pleases him, and only Faith in Jesus Christ allows access to God and salvation.     You're just going to have to use your brain and realize that most "christians" dont know anything more than religion. Least of all Jesus. If they did they wouldnt put you off like they do.     If you dont want salvation, thats your own business, if you dont want to find out who God is for yourself by accepting Jesus and access to him, thats your business. Its not ones business to tell you God doesnt want you. Thats a lie.|`|AA11729666	Nope, it is a mere mortal thinking they know the mind of God explicitly and attempting to raise themselves up (or lower God to their level) to God's postition in order to pass such Divine Judgement.    The 'certain people' remark is the fuel capitalized on by the few in order to promote an 'us vs. them' mentality which ultimalety leads to intolerance and violence- "chosen ones" are a human mockery of Creation.|`|f180924fa608a1843cfd44f843639824aa	No, it's not.  According to the Bible, Christ offered love to all.      How do they know what God wants?  Perhaps God is like a father who loves all his children unconditionally.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	No, it's not.  Christ died for ALL.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	I think that is absolutely wrong and as a Christian I would never ever tell you that because Romans says that Christ died for us (ALL of us) while we were yet sinners.    You can certainly use your brain, but God also gave you a conscience, and He wants you to use that as well.  He gave you all of creation to marvel at and if you reject Him even though He's tried time and again to show you His love and mercy, He is not to blame.     You can always do what you 'think' is right but that doesn't change what is 'actually' right.  Just remember, truth is not relative.  I can believe that a semi going 60 mph wont hurt me, but that doesn't make it true.|`|ClGfZ8PLaa	Whoever said it, is wrong.     The truth is that Jesus is God, and He does want you  :)  Salvation is a free gift by faith alone in Jesus, that simple (John 3:16).  Jesus loves you so very much!  :)
JcwjDpY8aa	no...  A lot of times when a new employee starts a job, male or female, they are taken advantage of in terms of others work forced upon them and things like that.  It is the new employees job to know what exactly their job description is and take a stand for themselves.  If the new employee has a problem with their boss getting in their personal space, they will say something about it.  It is common sense how much a boss should be in your "personal" space and if it crosses the line, it is the new employees responsibility to report it to someone else.  The "boss", however, sounds like a pig who should be demoted.|`|xEZ7GomQaa	People who do these kinds of things should be punished severely|`|brKxytiXaa	wait for him outside after work. this sounds like the male captain at the marriott i work at. he always flirts with the ladies and ask the married ladies what their doing this weekend like he's going to hang out with them on the weekend. plus he likes to stire at them as they walk away.fyi- disabled people should not work at this marriott b/c the male captain is a bully and you know what happens to bullies.well just think of all the h.s. shotting b/c of h.s. bullies|`|9b190ff02866633a642ef79aa8cd2e5daa	Volunteer to be their support person. Just kind of pay attention and be there to work them though the insecure learning phase. I wouldn't confront the person causing the problem, I would just be around to iron the problems out and be nice. It's been my witness that people that cause friction on porpose literally are fed by attempts to confront them. Stay away from the hostility and just be nice in return. Not passive agressive, just plain ol' nice.     Learn the most beautiful word in the english language...."whatever". It works great to avoid confrontation with people that feed on confrontation  like cats do cream.     My opinion.
i3lXJbtFaa	Not necessarily. I think what really happens is that oppressed people tend to pick poor leaders who wish to become the oppressors. In a free society, we tend to have a cultural proclivity to be wary of leaders because we're aware of past abuses. Oppressed people seem unaware that a new oppressor could come from their own ranks.    Take Hugo Chavez as an example.|`|QnH9QuQwaa	I agree.  Often groups who say they want peace really want peace.... without you in the picture.  I don't feel the same way, but I think many groups do fall into that description of future oppressors.    I cite the Hutus in Rwanda.  Look at the massacre they invoked when they got their chance to lead "peacefully".   I never knew machetes were used for peaceful purposes.|`|UH1ipgJmaa	Yes, when I become the member of the Riksdag..........I will acquire Nukes & destroy nations|`|T5ztIAZbaa	To an extent.|`|A01w1dHqaa	Every attack thought (and thoughts result in actions) is the return of one made.

And their knowledge that they would deserve it.    Edit:  I'm not necessarily saying the oppressors would actually deserve it, I'm saying that the oppressors feel they would deserve it in their hearts, and that frightens them.|`|AhJaRRlbaa	I'd say history has pretty much proven that statement true.  Look at the French Revolution, for instance.    It's unfortunate.  Human nature can have such an ugly side.|`|nEc0L0MRaa	It plays on human ambition, and I see it as being a useful tool to keep the oppressed where they are.  Do I agree with it?  Not in all cases, I'm sure it is true in some.  It's a generalization.  Think of a caged animal, it's very nature yearns for freedom.  If given the chance it will take that freedom and destroy all in it's path.  For this reason, (and the moral ones as well) I don't believe anyone should be oppressed.|`|AA10918154	Oppression is born from the Ego, therefore since all humans believe that they are this selfish ego, they too will become oppressors.........namaste, thomas|`|YIAZmSW7aa	No, I don't agree with it.

I don't do joy reading anymore,  books do not hold my fascination like they used to.  I like short stories, but mostly I like to just satisfy my curiosity own my own terms by using multiple sources without having to spend time I don't have.

ad6559518ee7ea2663bbb774b8106390aa	Good and evil are not anthropomorphic entities with conceptual power, volition, intention or plans to tempt us one way or another.  Good is not "a god" and evil is not "a devil".  Good and evil are merely concepts with which we humans respectively designate actions that are meant to help us live and improve our lives or actions that destroy our lives or render our lives painful.    If something or somebody DOES something to you that IMPROVES your life - that is good.   If something or somebody DOES something that makes your life miserable - that is evil.    The choices of actions and people that we make can lead us to do good or evil for ourselves and the only tool we have to guide us is our ability to practice rational thinking.    To live, we must act.  To act, we must choose.  To choose correctly, we must practice the virtue of rationality.    The virtue of rationality is the highest virtue because without it we are not able to distinguish the real from the unreal, the true from the false, the just from the unjust, and the moral from the immoral.  Animals have no use for justice or morality, but we do.  Without rational thinking we are merely another animal walking erect.|`|zQyslfHKaa	The greatest trick God ever played was not existing period.

So they agreed to give him up for adoption and decided to let the dragon that lived on the opposite side of the world of the Clauses to take him because then he would be so far away. That's why he lives there. They call it hell because it's so damn hot there! Hella hot!|`|WZa6GhS3aa	They don't exists but if they did  i guess  the devil is a sign that if your bad you will get no where in life and go to hell if your good you will be judged by god and sent to heaven showing you've done no greater evil and any sins have been forgiven.

Religion caused more wars and fighting than any other in the world.

He is one silly bastard.|`|Ur53Pf6zaa	Are you kidding?  Satan boasts big time about his existance.  His kingdom is so obvious.   Now if God 'proves' His existance then what is the purpose of faith?  Also - how do you define proof? Would that be you having ... lots of money, lots of sex, food, toys, lots of admiration?  Many would say if God existed He would give that to those he loves (ie the idea God doesnt exist because a real God would provide for the poor).   So then what, you want to 'see' Him physically?   You cant get the full or even partial understanding of God by His physical appearance.  We could never comprehend Him with our eyes.   "Proof" is relative ... it all depends on what humans think.  God doesnt work within the thought or egoic limititations of the human mind.     Satans greatest trick was making God very human like, or very much like a man, therefore hiding Gods true nature.   You need proof of Gods existance becuase what He has given us to show His existance is hidden by Satan.  Thats how/why doctrines and traditions are created ... hell, pre-trib rapture, feminism, God and Jesus physically being the same intity, and more.  All from the mind of ... man.    When we dont know the whole truth about God, it keeps us from loving Him fully, as He deserves.  When we love 'with all our hearts and all our soul" ... the next natural thing to happen is ... obedience.  Obedience then comes out of love, not fear - and we do it happily.  Satan dont want us obedient!  He loses control of us when that happens.  So the first thing to do is love.  We were told this plainly in the bible, does anyone listen?  That's Satans second greatest trick ... making us deaf.    36"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?" 37Jesus replied: " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.'[b] 38This is the first and greatest commandment. 39And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'[c] 40All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments."|`|AA11002471	God has given ample evidence of his existence.

It is literally the kingdom of God on earth , and as such its affairs are administered by apostles, prophets, and other legal administrators appointed by Christ the King. (1 Cor. 12:27-29.) It is the congregation or assembly of saints who have forsaken he world by accepting the gospel, formal society of converted persons and not the unorganized spiritual vagary termed the Christian church by sectarianism.       The church was first organized on earth in the days of Adam, with that great patriarch standing as its first president, the presiding high priest over God's earthly kingdom. The common sectarian notion that the day of Pentecost is the birthday of the Christian Church is a false heresy. Whenever the gospel has been on earth, it has been taught and administered in and through Christ's church. The Church or kingdom as organized in the meridian of time by our Lord and his apostolic ministers was a restored Church.    It has always been common to refer to the Church as the kingdom. Matthew so speaks more than a score of times. (Matt. 13:24.) But the term Church itself has also always been used, though possibly more frequently in some ages than in others. "The church, in ancient days," for instance, chose to call the higher priesthood after the name of Melchizedek.|`|7kJFmyxdaa	My personal purpose for attending church services is to give all glory, honor and praise to God for seeing me through the ups and downs of the week.

Babies are good choices for pulling the emotional heart-strings so that reason flies out the window.    My feeling is that the Creator (by whatever name) put processes into motion ... CREATED ... and the intervention since then has been less mass genocide or massive miracle than individual inspiration. We are created in our Creator's image ... as tool users. We've been given the tools of Creation and the Spirit of inspiration.

We were going through Exodus, and I was trying to get them to think about what it actually says. 'You will see how harshly I deal with all my enemies', is a constant refrain.    It was about the time that Israel invaded Lebanon (well, ok, it was about one of the times ...) and there were Israeli tanks, and rocket batteries, on high ground overlooking Beirut. Every evening this stuff was on the TV, and there were TV crews close to the back of some of these rocket batteries, when you'd get maybe twenty rocket propelled missiles launched in a second or two, and artillery fire, all pouring in on apartment blocks, office blocks, residential areas. It was difficult not to see a connection between Exodus and the savagery and merciless brutality of the Israeli assault.    Some of the other plagues are pretty horrific too, particularly if you've seen a lot of blood, for instance, or been in a place where flies swarm thickly.    There was a question earlier about the nature of evil. It was about that time that Ariel Sharon organised for the Christian Militia in Lebanon to go into Sabra and Shatila camps. Evil is not abstract and theoretical. It was let loose that night, while Sharon fired star shells over the camps to provide light for the slaughter of women and children.    You get fed up on here of the infantile bickering between atheists and christians. But high on the list of 'most disgusting' things here is Christians who won't face the nature of the text they claim to regard as authoritative.    You're right. And to understand it properly, you don't engage in point-scoring squabbles on YA. You spend time with a family that just lost a young child. I strongly advocate people using reference books and doing their research when they study ancient texts, but unless they take those texts into contemporary lives, alongside the grief, their study is utterly vain.|`|rLc1QeVbaa	lol      china has been killing their newborn daughters even today.......|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	contemplating the bible is the quickest way to convert to atheism|`|6kue5meiaa	I have contemplated this evidence of atrocity.

The Egyptians did it to themselves really. God gave them plenty of warning and plenty of chances and they refused to listen. So, in a sense, they "slaughtered" their own children."    No this is stupid God is omnipotent he has unlimited options in his arsenal to avoid killing innocent children so there is no way you can justify his actions. He could have had the israelites escorted out by angels or teleported them away or smote the Pharaoh to show his displeasure but instead massacres the babies. If you have the means to do it then you should always avoid killing innocents. Gods feuds should not involve collateral damage if he is good and omnipotent.|`|cFaCmYrXaa	    That makes me feel SO much better now O_o *slaps forehead*
k03dYskYaa	In the Bible book of Second Kings, we learn of a group of boys who verbally harassed the prophet Elisha. The account says that they began to jeer him and kept saying to him: Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead! Jehovah, who could read the hearts of these young ones and see their malicious intent, took their verbal abuse very seriously. The account says that God put 42 boys to death because of their abusive speech.2?Kings 2:23,?24.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Well, they were torn - don't know if they survived.

In that era that would be 12 or under.|`|AA11002471	Have you ever contemplated that you weren't there and don't know the details?|`|AA11690436	As a baldhead myself, one of that oh so persecuted segment of society who has no one defending our rights against hate speech, I can only applaud, and wish that I had a couple of she bears handy when I walk by elementary schools.|`|AA11058044	OK, so even the most craven of apologists claims that you're reading it wrong - God didn't send bears to kill 42 little kids.  He only sent bears to beat the living snot out of hundreds of teenagers.    Yeah, that's so much better.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Kids can be such total Shiites.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	I have. It's barbaric.    I guess the kids these days really are luckier than they think.|`|JoVbT4noaa	Yes.    The Bible is full of win.    Win straight from God.    Yay God.|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	Often.  I see it as a wonderful example of biblical principles and Christian love and meekness in the face of criticism.    Oh and apparently for THIS it's important to have been there to have witnessed a biblical story or the details may change your impression (I'm unsure as to what details of bears tearing kids apart would make it OK....).  Funnily enough that answer rarely comes up from amateur apologetists when discussing the nice parts of the Bible.  Those, for some reason, we can take on face value....    OH they were TEENAGERS!   That makes slaughter by wildlife a perfectly appropriate punishment for calling somebody bald then, doesn't it!  Snicker.....    Of course these idiots always focus on the word "na'ar" which can indeed mean youth (but even then usually doesn't - it's a very dismissive word for anybody past puberty as the contemporary Yiddish usage will attest).    However the word before it is "qatan" which is "little or tiny".  And this combination is NEVER - not once in all of ancient Hebrew - used to mean anything but children.  Perhaps amateur apologetists seem to think we have stumbled on the one description of a dwarfish gang of teenage ruffians in scripture!    And it gets more absurd when they parse the word "baqa'" as if it meant wound or bruise, when the meaning is to tear apart (into several pieces).  It's most common biblical translation is to "cleave up or cleave asunder"    So apparently this gang of dwarfish teenagers also had the malevolent ability to survive bifurcation!  Shade of Python and " 'tis but a scratch!" here.  Oh what a hoot these cut and paste non-Hebrew speaking apologetists are!|`|9MhdJ1YDaa	You have (intentionally) confused the facts of your illustration. According to the Bible, they were not small children, but probably teenagers. Their intent was probably not in jest, but to assault Elisha. They were not merely teasing him (why not *read* the record?) but trying to drive him away.  Ever hear of a street gang? How would you feel with 42 teenagers trying to pick a fight with you?|`|ad6XOMliaa	I am a Christian, and I too consider parts (most) of the the Bible as a genealogy, with just as many tall tales as some of the genealogies written today.  -- Don't forget the talking donkey of Balaam. -- smiles|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	I was in a religious class where this subject was brought up - we were told that the "children" weren't really children but more like a city street gang...when a student then proceeded to grill the instructor about how older children were usually refered to as "youths" within the text and that he wanted the instructor to show him some sort of evidence that these children were somehow more dangerous than wee ones who thought it funny an old man was bald, the instructor became incredibly angry and forced the student to leave.  It was at that point several others of us also left, and never went back.    I suppose you could say the instructor turned into a "she-bear" protecting his "cubs" (his lame interpretation of the Bible) when the student called him a "bald"-faced liar...    So you could say it has something to do with human nature, and the tale is simply storytelling - my guess is whoever put it in the Bible was somebody who had just had an arguement with Elisha, and felt like he'd been mauled by bear in the exchange - the Bible isn't a singular work - it's a bunch of writings edited together and it's construction is more like having a couple 1000 of those cardboard puzzles and then trying to make them all fit into a single picture.|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	No, I haven't.    Thanks for asking.    God bless you.|`|NXTpQSdhaa	That never happened!    No, wait. 2 KINGS. Yep - there it is.    At least there are no stories of men offering their daughters to be raped by a crowd of baying men and then being saved by God for being righteous, only to have their wives turned to salt and then their daughters rape them in a cave so they could get pregnant.....*gasp for breath*...... oh, no, that's there too in Genesis....    Damn that Bible! Crazy book....|`|zQyslfHKaa	The fact that people can compartmentalize that type of horrific behavior and ignor it shows how incredibly harmful religion is.    If your religion causes you to be apathetic towards the murder of teasing teenagers, or babies in the flood or Egyptian Children murdered, or Captive Midianite children slaughtered, or any human eternally tortured, it is harmful and immoral.|`|IyqyJ82Eaa	The only reason I shave my head is so I can sick bears on people.  So far its worked out well.|`|zmVCqh7Daa	HAVE FUN READING.    "And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them."      So that is 2 Kings 2:23-25 straight from the King James. So Elisha was going to Bethel and little children came out from the city and started mocking him and calling him names. Elisha then stopped and went back and cursed them. After that, two female bears came out and tore up 42 children. At first glance, this indeed seems horrific. But we need to venture deeper.     Little Children  now these were not really little children, kids, toddlers or whatever as you would think of them. As a matter of fact, go back into the original Hebrew language and you will see that it is translated to mean youth or young men. People LOVE to run with the little children idea and do no research whatsoever.  So these are young men, what we would think of like gangs in the city, more than 40 of them, mocking Elisha, ganging up on him.    Go up; Go up  the chant go up, go up was actually a taunting mock to Elisha. They were telling Elisha to ascend in the fiery chariot to heaven just like Elijah, his master, had, and of which he claimed to see.    Thou Bald Head  now things that seem foolish now were actually very rude in the past. Calling someone bald in those past times, especially biblical times, was HIGHLY DEGRADABLE. That was what they were doing to Elisha.     The Curse  now upon first seeing the word curse we most likely assume that Elisha brought down a curse from heaven on them. Or we might even think that Elisha cussed out the kids. The thing is, the way we view cursing is different from cursing back then. Before I go on, I would like to lie down, if Elisha was such a peaceful man, why would he do that? Why would he draw down a curse on those men? He wouldnt. We dont know what Elishas curse was, but we can be sure that it was nothing ungodly. Heck, Jesus curse of the fig tree is WAY different than some might think it to be. This was Jesus curse of the fig tree: "No man eat fruit of thee hereafter forever." Mark 11:14  So much for cursing. What I am trying to lay down here is that the cursing was not what we think it is.     The 42  Believe it or not, the Bible never said that there were actually only 42 children there at that scene! I know, that is the popular belief. As a matter of fact, the Bible says that 42 of them were injured, but not that there were only 42. There was more than that, according to the text.    The Killing  Surprise  2! Believe it or not, the Bible never said anyone was killed!! The words are, and tare forty and two children of them. That word there, tare, does not mean kill. In the original Hebrew language, it actually means to bruise or cut. They were injured. Some probably needed medical attention too. But none were killed!      The above clarifies a lot of it. God did not just allow those two female bears to come out upon those men because they called his prophet bald. Jesus was disrespected many times. Those young men brought it upon themselves. This must have been going on for a period of time. Those men MUST have been engaged in willful disobedience for times past and in this one last event they had just pushed away the Holy Spirit and God gave them up. In this case, female bears attacked them. Was it Gods fault? No. Well then whos to blame? Those men themselves.|`|r8qJecrMaa	I blame the parents! Kids these days can be so cruel! Those bears may have got hurt or choked on a hoodie!!|`|io7nHB3Oaa	Does anybody know what kinds of bears live in Israel?

It would have taken me several trips to my car and back to clean out my office - I am thankful I didn't have to go through the embarrassment of doing that after I was just laid off.|`|TiS89hj1aa	Of course if it was my friend|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	That would depend on how one came across the information.

It was just that it felt like personal information that my boss should have had the backbone to tell me first.     I felt violated.. like if everyone else knew before me. Cause, lets face it, if my boss could tell my friend before me then who knows who else she told, you know?    I say tell her if you found out by chance.. but not if her boss told you. Cause if she did, then I would tell her boss to man up and tell her/him themselves.|`|ef2911f8d21cd85ee3398706a59e0e47aa	Of course.  They deserve to have a head's up and a little time to plan what they are going to do next.  Nothing sucks worse than getting fired out of the blue, trust me.  And what happens later when they find out that you knew and didn't tell them?    Tell.|`|mQZDizMVaa	I wouldn't. That's confidential info and should be discussed between your friend and her boss.    This is what's wrong in the workplace today-confidentiality no longer exists. Time was, if a person was about to be fired, they'd be the first to know. Now everyone else knows before that person's fired.
6KpZ2fIRaa	Yes, it worked. Not sure how or why, but it did.    I got a voodoo doll as a gift when I was a kid, but I didn't know what it was. The instructions said to think of a person who has upset you and poke a needle in the part of the doll where you want this person to feel pain. A neighbor kid had ticked me off for some reason, so I thought of him and poked all of the needles in the crotch of the doll. The next day I found out that this kid had to go to the emergency room because of an accident he had while playing on his swing set. He smacked right into a support beam where a connector bolt was sticking out far enough to cause bodily damage upon impact. The poor kid's penis was mostly torn off and hanging by a piece of skin. I was told that the doctors were able to reattached and fix everything back to normal. But OMG that's crazy and creepy. My parents threw the doll away.|`|DArAz67Caa	no-----it's best not to get involved with black magic and rituals that appease Satan---|`|gHSarVD1aa	I have only met a couple of Voo Doo people when I was a Pagan.

The gods like Loa and Orisha are dying, and they will stop at nothing to stay. They would go as far as destroying the world to stay alive.     I went to see a voodoo guy once. He told me that I needed a cleansing and he did major voodo on me(pun intended.) There as bad as they come, they practice human cannabalism, human sacrifice, they torture people. And there magic is very real. They take the commands of there gods seriously and if they say cut out his tongue they will. If they say abduct him, drug him, rape him, then kill him, they will.    The gods are dying, its there time to go, so don't get involved with any gods, animals don't worship hmans, humans have no need to worship gods.

Say: I do not ask of you any reward for it but love for my near relatives; and whoever earns good, We give him more of good therein; surely Allah is Forgiving, Grateful."      3:61:  "But whoever disputes with you in this matter after what has come to you of knowledge, then say: Come let us call our sons and your sons and our women and your women and our near people and your near people, then let us be earnest in prayer, and pray for the curse of Allah on the liars."

Now let me quote to you the shia answer KTP:    "We Follow Prophet(saww) And His Ahlybait (as)"    Now he did not stop at the prophet (saw). WHY?    because he has in a VERY clever and sly way said that he believes that there was revelation AFTER the prophet (saw). The word he used was "Ahlybait" Which to a shia means the 12 imaams. So Anotherside was absolutley correct in showing that the shia belief that there is revelation after the prophet Muhammed (saw).    Now let me quote YOU:    "Will Shiias willing to reunite and this will happen only if we take into account, that our LAST teacher, will be Prophet Muhammad, s.a.w."    So clearly they do not apply your terms to themselves. So now why would you want to unite with them if they feel that there was revelation after the prophet (saw). They do not believe that the "LAST" teacher was the prophet (saw) they believe that their final imaam is the "LAST" teacher.    So now it is upon you to reject their unity.

Barring that, don't shoot for the unoccupied seat when YOU sit down; find someone who looks reasonably normal and sit by them.

Once I had to take a public bus and I was both filthy and smelly from work. I had no choice in the matter unfortunatly. Most people just kind of looked my way ect, but one person stood up and moved, and although I understood, it made me feel pretty bad and I didn't think much of this person because of it.     With  a crazy person, I try to remember that they may be suffering from a real medical problem and they deserve the same respect as anyone and it's a matter of being a dignified, careing person to tolerate them without any disregarding reaction.     This is my opinion.|`|CU6HowiVaa	That's weird...

As an answer, I would recommend something like 'Hallo'.    2. 'Wnsche dir was' can also be used as a command (wish something). But it's also (and rather more often) used as a word of farewell.

It depends on the context what you would have to answer to that.    I am sorry to say this but the other answers are not right and the spelling is far off.

So you better ve real careful because you will invite dark unseen things into your head and when you've gone far enough down the wrong path (hopefully not beyond the point of return) you will struggle to get back and these dark things will fight like hell to keep you.

Even one Christian can't look to another Christian and believe in every single thing that his friend does. Each person has things that they can accept, and things they cannot. Only you can decide if you are Christian, Atheist, Pagan, etc. Right now it sounds more like you are intrigued by polytheism, and that's cool.

It can be done by the religious and non religious alike.  Many practice it, in some form or another, without knowing it.  Belief in a deity automatically disqualifies you from being atheist.  I believe agnostic is the word.  You believe in a deity, but do not have a religion.    Dance to the rhythm of Fire    Edit: I have to laugh at many of the answers here.  Do any of you fools who suggest it, really think that a human has the power to control a demon?  Or that any human who has attempted such folly has lived to tell the tale?  Demons are far more powerful than any human alive, ever.  No witch worth her salt is dumb enough to rely on demons for her spellcraft.  If for nothing else, the spell won't work.

Now no doubt some people will want you to seek guidance I would advise against it, read books and look at the actual tangible evidence not someone else dogma.

But I would caution you to be very careful w/ magic. The definition of black magic vs. white is in the intention. Avoid going any magic that has a selfish purpose or intention.

Try researching what about Witchcraft or Wicca interests you.  I started looking into Pagan religions and found Celtic Witchcraft.  I have stuck with it since and it has been such a blessed thing for me to be doing.  Search different types of Witchcraft and see what it all encompasses.  You will definitely find something that jumps out at you and that you like and will want to stay with.  --Adonnenniel    EDIT: I have seen some of the answers on here and some are very true, but some have shocked me.  Magick is neither black nor white, but both.   Nature is both, and Magick is shaped off of nature.  Don't believe people who say that there is only ONE true path or god.

Therefore we don't need forgiveness, or a messiah.  So obviously, the Christian god, as described by the Christian holy book, is imaginary.    Which god are you referring to then as the "creator"?      Edit - To "Brian" below... you break my heart.  You really do.  How can you be so goddamned stupid?  Look up the quote that you just cherrypicked.  I DARE YOU TO LOOK IT UP.  And read the rest of what Darwin said.  You just quoted the first sentence of one of the most important proofs of evolution.  You either don't know this, or you are well aware of it, and are intentionally deleting it.  In essence, you are either an ignoramus, or you are a liar.    Which is it?|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	You must not know much about the human body.    What designer would be stupid enough to pass the optic nerve THROUGH the optic disc, creating the blind spot?|`|3qqvFEsHaa	our bodies are not perfect  our retinas are backwards  Roughly 30% of all pregnancies end in miscarraige.  Our eyes are no where as good as an eagles  noses nowhere as good as a dogs  etc...    hundreds of millions of years of natural selection has shaped the way we are today.  We are far from perfect, but we are suited for our environment|`|AA11297267	There's no evidence of any kind that there was any sort of "design" or creator involved.  But let's look at your argument from personal incredulity for a second...    Human eyes aren't a very good "design."  Our light-sensing cells are backwards, the optic nerve passing through the retina makes a big blind spot, and they're prone to all sorts of problems.  Squids, for example, have MUCH better eyes than we do -- their lenses can see both underwater and above, their light-sensing cells aren't backwards so they can see well in much lower light levels, and since the optic nerve doesn't have to go through the retina they have no blind spot.  The human eye makes perfect sense when its evolutionary history is known (which it is), we can see how it evolved from simpler forms given our lineage.  It doesn't make much sense if it was "designed," any college freshman engineer could do a much better job.    All mammals have noses, including whales and porpoises (whose nose is at the top of their skulls) -- it's a way to bring air into our lungs.  Why does having a noise imply "design?"  Same goes for hands -- chimpanzees have hands nearly identical to ours, and evolutionarily that makes sense since they're our closest living relative.  Why does a hand infer "design?"    There are perfectly natural explanations for why we are the way we are.  There is no evidence that shows there was any design involved.    Peace.|`|urIm4YaBaa	He also gave us an appendix that we don't use (people with appendectomies are not immunologically comprised, so it plays no vital part in the immune system as some people say), he gave us underdeveloped nicitating membranes on our eyes, our smallest toe isn't used at all, our immune system has difficulty adapting to new strains of previously-encountered viruses, our knees are both vital and extremely vulnerable (they break easily with just a little lateral pressure), and we use the same channel for both eating food and breathing, with just a little membranous flap to protect our ability to breah. Finally, consider the gross inefficiency of the male reproductive system: why not just make a few "smart sperm" instead of billions of blind ones?    I can name more, but I think my point is clear: if we were designed, we are clearly, at best, the beta model of an inexperienced architect.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Putting testicles on the outside seems like a bad idea to me.|`|ZXUZxPwYaa	Its not that perfect|`|EM0kiImHaa	Yes, we were created.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	no  if we only had one eye you would say the same thing   if we had bunny ears and a lions tale you would say the same thing|`|gbBJ2q1Qaa	We are not perfect.    Why do so many of us need glasses?  Why does colorblindness exist?  Why do we only walk on 2 legs, making us one of the most unbalanced animal on the planet?  Why can't we run as fast as a cheetah?      Nature does not "design" us.  We are full of imperfections.|`|AA11002471	So, you're a non-practising evolutionist|`|WalnRzfGaa	if you Truly accept evolution then this would not be a question. If you accept it with out understanding how it works then i see this question coming up.    Evolution is the gradual adaptation over millions of years to ones environment. if you want to learn more on how it works read a few of Darwins books, they are very intresting.|`|hmU2udmRaa	how is it you believe we (humans) are designed any more perfectly than say a giraffe or a chimp?|`|vxSXsn59aa	Yes, we have hands, but wouldn't four be better than only two? I can't even count the number of times I've had to ask for help because I have only two hands.  We have eyes, sure, but why shouldn't we have eyes at the back of our heads as well as the front? It would be a lot easier to spot a lion sneaking up on us if we had 360 degree vision, wouldn't it?  Noses that can't smell water are of limited utility to an organism that requires water to go on living, don't you think?  We have joints that go bad on us, appendixes that can kill us if they become infected, we are vulnerable to a very long list of illnesses and injuries, and brains that have great difficulty distinguishing fact from fiction, as you amply demonstrate.  If we were designed, you may be very sure that I would not hire the designer to construct so much as an outhouse for me. He's obviously not very good at it.|`|b94573ef3c2d94b3f4ddd867c8a6cc47aa	You can solve this yourself by reading a geology book.    And no we're not perfect.

AA12220429	I dnn't tip a on a take out order.  Not because it's not worthy of gratuity, but who should I tip?  Most places, the cashier takes your money and gives you your food.  So, should I tip the cashier?  What di he/she do?  I also go to a place where the owner takes the order.  Should I tip him?  Isn't he getting enough of my $?|`|CjlARBpeaa	I rarely tip at coffee places and never at a fast food joint.  But I will tip at a deli or take-out place.  Usually a buck or so.  I understand that it's not that exciting to only get a dollar or so but how much service did you really provide?  Unless you're going to share that with the kitchen who did most of the work.      I used to work at a place that did a lot of to-go orders and it was a nice surprise to get anything on those orders.  Who cares? Quit complaining or get a different job.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You do NOT ever ever tip at McDonald's or any other fast food place, there is no service involved at all. Workers everywhere have to deal with BS and they do not expect or receive compensation. You only tip servers in full serve restaurants and even then only if they give you good service.|`|i6QfwNTJaa	well at the restaurant i work at i could take the to go order, since i am the waitress of that shift and floor.i may get everything ready for them and bag it up, but the tips always go to the cooks. and some customers who know, give me a little extra for me.  they dont have to, but it is appreciated. and there is no rule on this. they do not have to tip if they are having something to go. at least not to my knowledge.|`|1EHmi2Y1aa	I always tip a to-go waiter.  And since you brought it up, yeah it might be a nice thing to throw a $5 gift certificate to Blockbuster or Ice cream or something to a good McDonald's worker for the hell of it.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	You are taking that server AWAY from tables that they could be serving to service you instead.    EDIT: It's not so much a responsibility. Granted, tipping is not required, but a nice gesture if the person did a good job regardless waiting on your table for 2 hours or doing all the steps for a to-go order to insure you have a nice hot meal to eat at home. It all takes work and time. It wouldn't hurt to tip a $1, now would it?|`|FhHkT0bBaa	Good question,and one Ive never thought about.Usually when I get a to go order,I call it in before hand,so I have no idea who takes the order,nor who packs it,or cooks it,so what are you supposed to do,tip everyone involved?But,if they bring it out to me,then I probably would give them a couple of bucks,but that never happens,so I dont know,I will be interested in what others say!|`|rThIVk2maa	Correct, you don't tip for to-go orders. Tips are service fees and you are not receiving the service for which you would normally tip.|`|21cf999bfe54057972e1de48b7cd2cf3aa	I get what you are saying. I usually tip these people a dollar regardless of the ticket price. I think the problem I have is that on the credit card receipts at places that you walk up and put in your order they have a "tip" section. Sometimes I feel bad if I don't put something in there for them - and this is why they put that in - to make us feel responsible. If McDonald's employees want to earn tips, they should work at a traditional restaurant. Waiting tables is hard work, I really think it is harder than working at McDonalds, so waiters deserve the tips. That is the social contract.|`|xQcHrOweaa	i will tip for anything but NEVER a burger|`|AA12062311	Usually the people who take the to-go orders are not waiters, they are hosts and hostesses, and get paid more than the waiters do. You should not feel obligated to tip them, as they are not really servicing you as a waiter. You are right it would be similar to tipping the person who takes your order at a fast food restaurant.|`|AA11788494	No you do not need to tip for a carry out order.  That is insane!!|`|rOj4B5QNaa	I'm beginning to realize why I don't get tipped on to go orders.  Apparently people think that I am getting paid extra money to take said to go orders, when in reality it is that way at some restaurants but not all.  Who ever takes your payment is typically the person that got your food together and ready.  If it is a hostess and they are making $7-8 an hour then you are correct, they are being compensated all ready.  However if it's a server or bartender, they are not being compensated they are still only making their $2.13 an hour.  So, if they didn't get their butt back to the kitchen and get your stuff in an orderly fashion and get all the other condiments and what not then do not tip.  But if your food was ready for you when you walked in the door and it was a smooth transaction realize that they took time out of what they were doing to provide you with a service and took it away from other customers, unless it is like chilis or applebees and then they are there just to do that.  Cheap people will continue to be cheap though regardless of what I just said (sigh)...|`|24cde8bf3f4cbca12a1379054950f95aaa	i usually do tip service people-yes i have even at  at McDonald's but only when they're nice .i realize that they do a hard job and after dealing with rude people when they can still smile and be pleasant i try and reward them, just a small thing like handing them $1.00 can change their attitude for the whole day.everyone wants to feel appreciated! try it it'll make you feel better too|`|mnEkv7xdaa	Just like I would never take it out on a server and his/her tip if the kitchen messed up, I won't tip the cashier/host/server/cook/their mother for a to-go order. The answer to this problem is not in my wallet - I suppose the restaurant could either hire separate staff for carry out, or compensate the server. OR, the server can get over it and realize that sometimes we all have to accept hard work without a dollar reward.|`|24cfb9540386b800bb43a544c412b806aa	To answer your additional detail: It is you as the customer who took them away from their tables. If you hadn't made a to-go order, they would be at their tables, but they had to stop to wait on you. Next time you make a to-go order, try and get it without a waiter. Keep in mind that you are not allowed into the kitchen.
JO8YzDNVaa	No way    That would lead to endless war with little consequences save the environmental damage.    All that depleted uranium they use in their bullets goes somewhere after the bullet gets shot.|`|AA11058044	This would presume that the traits that make up a good soldier are completely the result of a person's genetic heritage.    Most studies have shown that while genetics may play a part, environmental conditions and how a person is raised are just as, if not more important in many cases.    Cloning might be useful in ensuring that you have a population of base stock to work from that is free from any glaring physical defects - i.e. they all have decent vision, aren't prone to weird allergies, don't have arthritic knees or hunchbacks - but after that it all comes down to training and indoctrination, and you can do that just as effectively with "standard" stock humans as you could with clones.    Making purpose built soliders is as easy as training them to be soldiers from birth.  It worked for the Spartans, and they didn't have any kind of access to genetic engineering.    Our society has little need, or use for such dedicated soldiers, and certainly wouldn't be willing to pay the cost in terms of dollars or in human lives, potential and freedom that would be required to institute such a program.|`|1286cbbdaec7b88444188ebc8781d6d6aa	Not really.    How do you motivate a clone to put his life on the line for his country?  How do you ensure loyalty?    How much do you pay a clone soldier?  Would we be considering a new form of slavery?

Cloning a human is much more complex than cloning horses and sheep etc.  the have tried cloning humans (mostly outside america) and the embryos always die.   right now i think the longest surviving cloned human embryo was 5 weeks.    its far from being perfected or for that matter actually happening.|`|Dgwy3YHsaa	They already have, Sweetie.

I don't think that any free country should be raising children to be soldiers--being a soldier should be a choice made by someone old enough to understand the decision.      In my book it would be as bad as rounding up orphans and giving them guns to make soldiers out of them.      Treating clones as less than human is simply a new form of racisim and discrimination.  It won't last long--eventually the humans would need to deal with the clone revolution.|`|AA11564934	"good" is meaningless upon real examination.

LPO8RlVdaa	Of course they did. The spear of destiny and the Amber room were just two things of many that they found. Atlantis and the Ark of the Covenant were two things they went looking for. Hitler and Himmler formed the ahnenerbe to look for archeaological treasures to strengthen nationalism. Basically to find historical 'evidence' that the Nazi's were the master race.|`|AA10898750	they sent groups all over the earth including antartica whenthey took austria as a client nation they went to the museums there they had the treasure of troy on display and the spear of destiny the one thats supposed to be the one that killed christ jesus its believed that anyone carrying it into a battle cant lose they stole most everything from all around europe and russia even north africa and italy after they left italy|`|AA11101361	They did.  Tacitus, a Roman general who faught Germanic peoples, was very admiring of "primative", Germanic society as compared to the decadance of Roman society.  So, archeological efforts were made in Germany to support this view of a noble, ancient race of Aryans as propaganda.  A lot of their archeological/anthropological/zoological efforts went to supporting that idea.  They attempted breeding programs with Polish bison (don't even ask me to spell, let alone say the name) to "de-evolutionize" them into their primative state.  Attempts were made at:   South American expeditions to prove that Germanic voyagers built the ancient architecture there.  Middle Eastern expedtions to prove that Rome's problems could be attributted to Germanic people vs Semitic people.  They tried to find other examples of works like the Bayeaux Tapestry, because only Germans are capable of such art.    Tried to prove Swedish runes were proto-German.  Tried to prove that Germans were descendants of Atlantis and all conflict stems from their feuds with everyone else, who are Jews.  Tried to prove that Jesus was Atlantian.    Their work outside of Germany was pretty crazy, and aside from assembling on of the most comprehensive studies on Tibetans, they mostly dug around trying to prove something, rather than dug around trying to learn something.  Not to mention destoying things that didn't meet with their Germanic ideals.  Within Germany, they made extensive finds regarding Roman and pre-Roman Germany.|`|nYRkAmdtaa	Doubt it they were probably too busy the spear of destiny to them would have been associated with gungnir - Odin All fathers spear not any biblical connection .|`|lrpG23Ycaa	i think they found an ark which they opened but then their faces melted off|`|zpIXKF1Xaa	yea! they was named the German Treasure Hunters,and they found Amber Room,hidden gold in an underground cavern.  they spent money to explore ship wrecks for treasures,but they all keep this in big secret.  they found a lot of treasures,and they dig all their treasures to places,there are still unknown:  "Treasure hunters dig for what they say may be plunder buried by the Nazis."|`|a0YeSoBEaa	the spear of destiny was the one biblical treasure that i know of that the nazi's procured.however it disappeared just before the war finished and it as not been seen since.  it is said whoever owns the spear has the power to rule the world
LPO8RlVdaa	Supposedly the Ark of the Covenant used to be there, but noone knows where it is now. The Ark and other vessels were carried off to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar after he destroyed the First Temple in 586 BC, but were later restored to the Second Temple. But in 70 AD, the vessels were stolen by the Romans when Titus destroyed the Second Temple. This was documented on the Arch of Titus in Rome, which showed Roman soldiers carrying away the seven-branched candelabra and other Temple vessels. Some scholars believe that the Temple objects taken by the Romans lie in the catacombs of the Vatican.  The Vatican denies they are holding any of these.    As for the Ark of the Covenant, it disappeared before the destruction of the First Temple. It was hidden by priests who foresaw the coming desolation, and its mysterious whereabouts have been the source of myth and legend ever since.   We know from 2 Chronicles 35:3 that King Josiah had the Ark put into Solomon's Temple in about 623 B.C. Previous to this the Ark was hidden because of turbulent times Israel had gone through; probably from around 950-623 B.C.     Only God knows where it is now!|`|4a5074102aabe414b622a8656b4ed59aaa	i think its the ark of the covenant:
mSFjbetxaa	The men who wrote the buy-bull made sure that the biblical god was very clear about how he feels regarding abortion.       The Bible shows that God does NOT consider human life to be precious. He kills OVER 2 million people, including babies, and that isn't counting fetuses or the number of men, women, children, and fetuses killed during the Flood or the Slaughter of the Firstborns, when we are not told how many people he killed.    The Bible clearly shows that God approves of abortion, and in many cases commands it:    The Bible approves of killing pregnant women: Genesis 38:24, Numbers 31:17    The Bible approves of abortion: 2 Kings 15:16     God approves of abortion: Hosea 13:15-16    People are not counted as persons until they are a month old: Numbers 3:15    The Bible contains directions on how to abort any pregnancy caused by adultery: Numbers 5:12-31    The Bible says that being aborted is better than living a bad life: Ecclesiastes 6:3-5, Matthew 26:24    The Bible says that a person becomes a living soul when he BREATHES the BREATH of life into his nostril (fetuses don't breathe): Genesis 2:7         Jesus (as a Jew), probably believed that "life" began at birth, as explained in the Old Testament. There is no biblical support for an "anti-choice" position. Have you read your bible?    Here's what your Bible actually says about abortion:    Abortion is not murder. A fetus is not considered a human life:     If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life. -- Exodus 21:22-23     The Bible places no value on fetuses or infants less than one month old:    And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. -- Leviticus 27:6     Fetuses and infants less than one month old are not considered persons:     Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them. And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD. -- Numbers 3:15-16     God sometimes approves of killing fetuses:    And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? ... Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. -- Numbers 31:15-17   (Some of the non-virgin women must have been pregnant. They would have been killed along with their unborn fetuses.)     Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. -- Hosea 9:14     Yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb. -- Hosea 9:16     Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up. -- Hosea 13:16     God sometimes kills newborn babies to punish their parents:     Because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die. -- 2 Samuel 12:14     God sometimes causes abortions by cursing unfaithful wives:    The priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell. And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen. ...   And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people. And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed. -- Numbers 5:21-21, 27-28     God's law sometimes requires the execution (by burning to death) of pregnant women:    Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. -- Genesis 38:24|`|Dgwy3YHsaa	Heretic: What could be more clear than Jesus' own words? ...which state, "It would be better for you to have a millstone wrapped around your neck and your body cast into the sea, than for you to harm one of these little ones."    The consequences of abortion are formidable for the baby butchers who extinguished these precious lives.  It's a NO-BRAINER, Sweetie.|`|AA11220299	Good question. Christianity is not just a bunch of rules, but it is a way of life. All parts fit together. When you start looking at abortion the issue is why do people want to have them? One reason is because they are involved in sex outside of marriage, before marriage or in adulterous situations. On reason may be rape. One reason may be that they don't want to assume responsibility for acts committed, etc. But if people, or lets say a society, is living by God's pattern for life, with sexual relationships taking place only within marriage and with the intention of having children and raising them in the ways of God, abortion isn't even an issue. So why would God spend a great deal of time dealing with details of something that should not even take place. The Bible itself says that when God makes a law it just creates a motivation for people to violate it.|`|On5B8U3faa	How much more clear can you get than "Thou shalt not kill"???

Also, do you really expect to learn from people you insult?  Just curious, because for someone who is feigning interest in learning about another point of view, you sure do write a lot.    By the way, your arguments contain broken logic.    1. "It's been happening since the dawn of time."  This assumes that whatever has happened in the past is acceptable.  Irrational.    2. "10 commandments not clear?"  Your underlying assumption is that since YOU are confused then IT is not clear.  Irrational.    3. "No room in Bible to clarify this issue?"  The Bible is not the sole source of God's direction.  Also, see  2.  As far as many people are concerned, the word "kill" is not one open to interpretation.  It's rather plain, in fact.    4. "What was God thinking?"  Why don't you ask Him?    For the record, I'm not a fundamentalist.  But let's make something crystal clear:    When you take something that was alive and do something to make it dead, that's called killing.  Do you get it now?    Please note, I didn't need a Bible or God to make that clear.    God bless you.      *** The Mighty RA- I look forward to seeing the research you have to back up your claims.

Psalms 139:13  For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother's womb.     Isaiah 45:18-19  For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens (he is God!), who formed the earth and made it (he established it; he did not create it empty, he formed it to be inhabited!): "I am the LORD, and there is no other.

Therefore abortion is the murder of innocent life.|`|22tPNksKaa	Simple, the Bible was nothing but a survival guide or the 12 tribes of Israel. All the laws are to make Jews STAY Jews (remember, no idol worshiping) & to make as many baby Jews  as possible. Polygamy anyone? Permitting abortion would lower the birth rate. Giving women the right to choose any thing... is a bad thing.    That is all that religion was, a survival guide for those it was written for. Nation-States are secular. And thus the replacement for Religions, nations w/ out borders.    I feel pity for those who look up & ask God, "Why?" They feel such anguish at things their faith doesn't allow them to realize on their own.    Legal abortion is the product of Nations that free themselves of the shackles of God.    GorgeousTX... that was some disturbing stuff. I read the bible, but the God-sanctioned Genocide made me want to stop. Murdering pregnant women... how disgusting. That cannot be forgiven. It's so wasteful! The Koran is PG-13 rated in comparison!    PS: "though shall not kill"? Did you even FINISH reading Exodus? What did Moses do to the worshipers of the Golden Calf? He killed  them all, except hois brother who made the damn thing. And what did the Hebrews do right after Moses died? They liquidated Jericho. Why?! What did they do to the Jews? Nothing, they just wanted the land. All the other tribes in Canaan were annihilated by some bloodthirsty newcomers. "Thou shall not kill" indeed!  Though I am an Atheist, I own a Bible for reference.

The very basis of depression is failiure to reach something to which we have great attachment .Attachment to anything does not bring it with us while we go.So attahcment to any thing is meaningless and insensible as the the thing to which we are attached would never stay with us eternalkly and shall be left behind , like the park bench , while the time for us to leave arrives .So we gain nothing in this world in the real sense and  so we also loose nothing in this world . No gain and no loss .  Read Bhagavad -Gita , the  which tells  yu about the real nature of this life and how one should live to perforn his duty with detachment and without expectation.It tells you what is lfie and what is death in reality .We do not die at all and never did we or do we cease to exist . Never had we not been existing and never shall we cease to exist also! Because God is in us as our soul and commiting sui cide is forcing God to vacate his temple ( our body).So it is a sin. The scripture Bhavad -gota is a highly logical and scientific treatise on the nature of life and this world .Make good use of this rare and  precious life to enjoy your tour of this planet as long as your are desined to be here .Worry not about the loss or deprivation of anything, as nothing really belongs to any one and you too.Why bother about things that do not belong to us .?

As long as we are in the material world there will be distress.  BBD 1                 We Are Not These Bodies     In Bhagavad-gita Sri Krsna points out that all of our miseries are due to false identification with the body.                        matra-sparsas tu kaunteya                       sitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah                         agamapayino 'nityas                       tams titiksasva bharata         "O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of heat and cold, happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed." (Bg. 2.14) In the summertime we may feel pleasure from contact with water, but in the winter we may shun that very water because it is too cold. In either case, the water is the same, but we perceive it as pleasant or painful due to its contact with the body.     All feelings of distress and happiness are due to the body. Under certain conditions the body and mind feel happiness and distress. Factually we are hankering after happiness, for the soul's constitutional position is that of happiness. The soul is part and parcel of the Supreme Being, who is sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah--the embodiment of knowledge, bliss, and eternity. Indeed, the very name Krsna, which is nonsectarian, means "the greatest pleasure." Krs means "greatest," and na means "pleasure." Krsna is the epitome of pleasure, and being part and parcel of Him, we hanker for pleasure. A drop of ocean water has all the properties of the ocean itself, and we, although minute particles of the Supreme Whole, have the same energetic properties as the Supreme."    If we want real happiness then we have to go back to the spiritual world. The simple formula is to follow Srila Prabhupada as our Bona fide Guru. He has prescribed :    72-08-11.   Letter: Suresh Candra    A disciple means one who is always following the orders of the spiritual master. So I instruct my disciples to refrain from four prohibitions, namely no eating of meat, fish or eggs, no illicit sex life, no taking of intoxication, including tea, coffee, cigarettes, etc., and no gambling. Besides that my students must chant sixteen rounds of japa-mala of Hare Krsna mantra daily. So if you are able to follow these principles without fail, then you are as good as my disciple. And after you have practiced these things for a few months' time, then we can see to your formal initiation. This chanting of sixteen rounds of japa-mala daily, chanting the full Hare Krsna mantra, Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare.Hare Rama Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare, on each bead 108 times in each round, this process will very quickly purify your existence, and you will come to your rightful spiritual understanding in very short order.     So if you follow above and read Srila Prabhupada's books hear his MP3 CDs classes you life will automatically be happy. See below where to get these.

The knights templar were destroyed  in medieval times, probably in order to grab their wealth, which often happened, but religion, making up charges of heresy,  legitimised this theft.   There are all sorts of myths about their survival in the old and new world, but no proof has ever been found, unless some secret society knows more, and they are not telling.    As for modern secret societies, I imagine that they do exist, but you have to be asked to join them and so they do remain secret, just a topic of supposition.  Our society may be seen as using them now as the population is too big for people to be in self supporting tribal, local or skill units,  and solidarity provides many benefits to the members.     The knights templar sound romantic and so lots of stories have sprung up about them.  The mystery endures.
LPO8RlVdaa	There are many, a lot of them revolving around its architecture, which has a lot of pagan and symbolic images carved into a supposedly Christian Church.    The "Apprentice Pillar", or "Prentice Pillar", gets its name from an 18th century legend involving the master mason in charge of the stonework in the chapel and his young apprentice. According to the legend, the master mason did not believe that the apprentice could perform the complicated task of carving the column, without seeing the original which formed the inspiration for the design. The master mason travelled to see the original himself, but upon his return was enraged to find that the upstart apprentice had completed the column anyway. In a fit of jealous anger the mason took up his mallet and struck the apprentice on the head, killing him. As punishment for his crime the master mason's face was carved into the opposite corner to forever gaze upon his apprentice's pillar.On the architrave joining the pillar, there is the inscription Forte est vinum fortior est rex fortiores sunt mulieres super omnia vincit veritas: "Wine is strong, a king is stronger, women are stronger still, but truth conquers all".    Among Rosslyn's many intricate carvings are a sequence of 213 cubes or boxes protruding from pillars and arches with a selection of patterns on them. It is unknown whether these patterns have any particular meaning attached to them  many people have attempted to find information coded into them, but no interpretation has yet proven conclusive.    One recent attempt to make sense of the boxes has been to interpret them as a musical score. The motifs on the boxes somewhat resemble geometric patterns seen in the study of cymatics. The patterns are formed by placing powder upon a flat surface and vibrating the surface at different frequencies. By matching these Chladni patterns with musical notes corresponding to the same frequencies,      Another notable feature of Rosslyn's architecture is the presence of 'Green Men'. These are carvings of human faces with greenery all around them, often growing out of their mouths. They are commonly thought to be a symbol of rebirth or fertility, pre-Christian in origin. In Rosslyn they are found in all areas of the chapel, with one excellent example in the Lady Chapel, between the two middle altars of the east wall. The green men in Rosslyn symbolise the months of the year in progression from East to West in the Chapel. Young faces are seen in the East symbolising Spring and as we progress towards the setting sun in the West the carvings age as in Autumn of man's years. There are in excess of 110 carvings of Green men in and around the Chapel.    The most famous myth however is that it is a repository for either the Holy Grail, or the treasure of the Knights Templar.|`|dfjIBHe3aa	It was really "famous" in Sinclair family archives until the connection between the Sinclair family and the Templars became more widely discussed in the twentieth century.    Andrew Sinclair, who is probably one of our most underrated contemporary novelists, is part of the Sinclair family and has written about their connections to the Masons and the Templars and more specifically the connections between those two groups and the Sinclairs who built Rosslyn Chapel.|`|AA10067344	It supposedly held (or still holds depending on the legend) the Holy Grail.|`|f43be0279e4f60717eb598a32d93faa0aa	It has links with the Knights Templer and the Holy Grail.|`|f7jICJo2aa	It's mentioned in Dan Brown's 'The Da Vinci Code', and it has something to do with Templars and Freemasonry, if that's counts ..    http://scottishhistory.suite101.com/arti...|`|YXGdwwTJaa	Read a book or watch a TV programme about it.  The carvings appear to contain mythological symbolism and the family that built it had enough money to create this structure.    I am not sure of the family name, but think it may be Sinclair, so try to find a book written by an author with that name and pedigree.
L6E6lDGKaa	Gates left himself open to this comment by one of the attendees:     TED curator Chris Anderson fired back at the legendary computer software maker, joking that the headline for the video of his talk to be posted online at Ted.com would be "Gates releases more bugs into the world."    That's funny... to me anyway.|`|urIm4YaBaa	I don't think that "poorly educated" describes Bill Gates. I would say that what he did wasn't in good taste. But, he's been releasing bugs into the public for years, so how is this significantly different?  ;)    The bigger issue would be if somebody in the audience does have a condition that could travel via mosquito bites, the person was bit, and then the mosquito traveled to another individual.     With that said, he is doing a lot of work for combating disease in the world. People may hate him for being wealthy, but it's wrong to not consider that, even when accounting for inflation, he's is the most generous philanthropist that the world has ever seen.|`|gbBJ2q1Qaa	You don't get it, do you?

The dude thinks that because he's so wealthy, he can do anything he wants. He's just an @$$hole who thinks that HE can be rich, but no one else can -- all I hear him talking about is redistributing OTHER people's money, but when it comes to his own, hands off! This man is a fool. I don't care how much money he has. If he really DID do this, I hope someone in the audience had some sort of condition that makes it more serious to bitten by a mosquito and they sue the pants off this freak. Maybe then he'll know what it's like to have your money taken away from you by the very trial lawyers and liberal fools he loves so much. (Whether or not they actually carried malaria isn't the point; yes, if he actually did it, it's assault.)    Oh, and Athene (or whatever your silly name is) - using a term like "moneyist" is taking poetic license. Another idiot.|`|SFL8VnOuaa	Nowadays, I couldn't Care less for what come out of Bill Gates mouth

j5uO9LL7aa	YES.  Those words mean nothing anymore, save for "conservative," "disagreeable," "white," or "I have no clue what to say in response to your logical and verifiable argument, so let me insult you to distract from that and hope you fear the label enough to shut up."    Prejudice is the more appropriate word is almost all cases.  And "ignorance" is just as over used as "racist."  Most people accused of being ignorant are actually quite the opposite, but the thoughts and reflections they take away from their experiences and education are unpopular.    If you use either word as part of an average day, you should question your emotional and academic maturity.  Some folks just can't agree to disagree without lowering themselves to personal insults and nonsense.  Sensitivity has no place in adult or scholastic discussion.|`|1a8gN2HSaa	I agree with your statements completely. The word "racism" and all of its forms is used to freely these days, it's become a word that is thrown around for fun, and it shouldn't be.|`|9NgninO3aa	NAW, ALL OF DEM WHITE PEOPLE IS RACIST!|`|DUicCMGFaa	No Mike it's xenophobia not racism.

Let's get that ish out in the open and stop pretending.   That's the only way change will come.|`|2IBHMk9Naa	Hate is the reason rasim exists, some people need a reason to feel better about themselves, this transformed into racism because white folks mistreaded coloured folks to make themselves feel better about themselves. I believe that hatred is caused by jealousy and ignorance.     Hatred  is taught in families, in little racist towns hatred is passed on from generation to generation, they can't help it because that was just the way they were brought up.  Which does make them ignorant, to a certain extent.  The hatred is their belief, and at the same time their ignorance, so even though you can unlearn ignorance, you cannot unlearn their belief.  So their belief and ignorance is the same thing in this particular situation, making it near impossible to stop the rasim spreading down the family tree.|`|QLMW7HRMaa	No, actually not enough.  Unfortunately the people who really should be called out are not.|`|c2e92ea2149d09e48eaba99f5f3a2f6daa	yeah, literally! The Portuguese could say "Spanish not allowed here" even if they're actually of the same race. Then one would react "Racists!" The one who reacted is so dumb that he/she misused the term racist. He/she didn't know that it was a nationality nonsense and not a race thing.    Another situation: a girl said "I'm racism." Definitely she was dumb because she used racism like it's an adjective.    Now you know who's the real dumb? (That's not me right?)|`|AA10898750	its like this: Ignorance Breeds Hatred like the seeds in a field

Hitler was asked what could have stopped his movement, his response was greater force on the streets when they were small. Consider the Brown Shirts of germany and do not become what you resist.|`|xjBFwsVMaa	I think if you got all your information from Wikipedia that was not a good idea. Wikipedia entries can be written and edited by anyone that wants to and they don't necessarily have to know a dang thing about the subject.

Now if it was just a bunch of friends getting together and wanted to be called FSU then I wouldn't mind but beating up other people.... not right!
8DCslWmMaa	I do not think that it is right to push an opinion upon children in a manner that is telling them that their parents are wrong.  Everyone has an opinion, it may be correct it may not.  No one KNOWS for sure. The earth and weather has cycles just like everything else and this can be just one of the cycles that comes around every 500,000 years- how are we to know, we have no history of the weather then. Science can only speculate with the 'evidence' that they have.  Gore has been caught speaking untruths in his Inconvenient Truths film.  PETA is also trying to undermine by calling fish 'Sea Kittens' so that children will convert over to a vegetarian diet. This can be severely damaging to the health of a growing child if the parent does not know how to have a fully nutritional vegetarian diet.    It think it is extremely rude to use the impressionable and trusting minds of children to force a point of view.|`|hmU2udmRaa	how is this undermining parental authority?  he's not telling children to disobey their parents.  only a moron could read or listen to gore's statement and think that's what he was saying.  he's merely commenting on the fact that children have better access to new information.  that's all.|`|9BeUbORtaa	Parents are morons. They are generally the least-qualified people to bring up children.

You know... parents like you.|`|i3lXJbtFaa	Hyperbole much?    Gore isn't telling kids to disobey their parents, cross the street without looking, or take candy for strangers.

The earlier we can start preschool the better - get the indoctrination started as young as possible!  Undermine their parents' morality, undermine their parents' judgement and we'll have them for life!    Muhahah!|`|3qqvFEsHaa	just because someone is a parent does not mean they are qualified to offer their opinion on global warming    Yes Gore is right.  Parents can be stupid, look at Britney Spears|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	The kids already know that parents don't know everything.  What were you hatched or something.  Think back to when you were a kid.    Incidentally, last time I looked, Gore was a centrist, not a liberal.  Try thinking for yourself, not just parroting the words of your AM  Talk-Radio gurus.|`|mSFjbetxaa	Absolutely, YES!!!    When children are taught ignorance and bigotry at home, than the world must take every opportunity that we can to offer knowledge and education.    Intelligent children will eventually realize that their parents are bigots and stupid when they seek knowledge.    Abortions must be made available to children of anti-choice nut jobs because they would force their daughters to give birth.        It is interesting that the same morons who deny global warming also deny evolution.|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	Should ANYONE try to undermine parental authority?

And now that I'm in a position where I can afford to save money for my kids to go to good schools, I hope they will one day surpass me.    Gore is right. New technologies, new knowledge. If we only stuck to outdated knowledge, we would still be burning "witches" and trying to drive demons out of the mentally ill.

When religious people refuse to allow thier kids to get life saving treatment, because "God is going to heal them" then they should be undermined and questioned.    When religious parent's teach thier kids about Martyrdom and that killing jews is justified and even applauded, then Yes they should be undermined and questioned.    You see, just because your willy works, doesn't mean your kids should be forced to suffer your ignorance and harful behaviour.|`|9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	He's correct.    Promoting ignorance and blind obedience to authority is what made the nazi party so powerful and despicable last century.  That's not a pattern we should seek to repeat.|`|B39YLMJBaa	Yes they should stop. We have mainly liberal leaders who have allowed laws to pass allowing minors to receive abortions without parental consent, but yet a minor is not allowed to visit a doctor when truly sick without parental permission.  When I was 17 and had a bad reaction to an antibiotic treatment I had to have a parent come with me to the clinic only to get a new prescription, yet I would be allowed to have an abortion at that age.  Crazy I know.|`|4405cb5dd585bee70aeaf6a964ff0b94aa	Absolutely not. Information is more widely available, yes... But the fact is this, Parents are the ones who raise the child and teach them their morals from a young age, Liberal leaders trying to undermine the parents are idiots and deserve nothing more than a kick in the testicles. My opinion anyways...|`|NXTpQSdhaa	There are truths I learned at school and discovered in my life that my parents did not know. So yes, fundamentally this is possible.     Whether global warming is real or not is another debate. But the glacier near where I live has been getting smaller for the past 30 years so there is some evidence for it at least. I just think it's a natural process rather than a completely man-made phenomena     I don't disagree with Al Gores final paragraph in the quote though, Sometimes we are weighed down by old assumptions, For example we used to believe that the world was flat and that the earth was at the centre of the universe and that God made the sun come up in ten morning. These assumptions were successfully challenged and society was able able to take a step forward    However, I fear this is not what you want to hear so I guess you will simply pick somebody who agrees with you as best answer, thus further validating Al Gores statement that some of us are weighed down by old assumptions....|`|KR64fnHjaa	I am not threatened by anyone suggesting to my kids that they think for themselves.  I taught them to think.  That is what I want them to do.  I don't consider it being undermined.
Q4MqzxX7aa	To celebrate the birth of your child That was a pretty special moment in my life|`|k03dYskYaa	Celebrating them year to year can't be that special if Jesus did not command anyone to celebrate his. December 25th is not his birthday anyway.    MClintock and Strongs Cyclop?dia says: The observance of Christmas is not of divine appointment, nor is it of N[ew] T[estament] origin. The day of Christs birth cannot be ascertained from the N[ew] T[estament], or, indeed, from any other source.(New York, 1871), Vol. II, p. 276.    Luke 2:8-11 shows that shepherds were in the fields at night at the time of Jesus birth. The book Daily Life in the Time of Jesus states: The flocks .?.?. passed the winter under cover; and from this alone it may be seen that the traditional date for Christmas, in the winter, is unlikely to be right, since the Gospel says that the shepherds were in the fields.(New York, 1962), Henri Daniel-Rops, p. 2    The notion of a birthday festival was far from the ideas of the Christians of this period in general.The History of the Christian Religion and Church, During the Three First Centuries (New York, 1848), Augustus Neander (translated by Henry John Rose), p. 190.    The later Hebrews looked on the celebration of birthdays as a part of idolatrous worship, a view which would be abundantly confirmed by what they saw of the common observances associated with these days.The Imperial Bible-Dictionary (London, 1874), edited by Patrick Fairbairn, Vol. I, p. 225.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	In some languages, the word for birthday literally translates as "anniversary". Birthdays are traditionally marked by celebrations including a birthday party or, in some particular cases, a rite of transition.    It is thought the large-scale celebration of birthdays in Europe began with the non-Christian cult of Mithras, which originated in Persia, and was spread by soldiers throughout the Roman Empire. Such celebrations were uncommon previously so practices from other contexts such as the Saturnalia were adapted for birthdays.    Because many Roman soldiers took to Mithraism, it was distributed widely and its influence was spread throughout the empire until it was supplanted by Christianity.|`|RermzbWgaa	I don't find them special.

0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	there is no end to the number of imaginary beings that believers think are real|`|Zw6peAPYaa	As far as people who believe in Jesus Christ but do not believe in the existence of a personal Devil, there are no doubt individuals who hold to this idea, but the Christadelphians are probably the most prominent as a group. To account for the incalculable evil and suffering that permeates the world, those who deny the existence of a being known as the Devil usually say that all biblical references to him, and to his demon associates, are figurative. Their basic assertion is that all evil stems from the minds and hearts of men, and that Satan, etc., is how man accounts for it.    First, the Bible did not come from the minds of men (2 Pet. 1:20 and 21), so Satan was not Marilyn Mansons idea. Second, there is neither linguistic nor textual justification to assign non-literal interpretations to the many plain New Testament references to the Devil and his demons.    Third, anyone with occasional consciousness is painfully aware that there is indescribable evil, tragedy, and suffering all over the world. Any newspaper on any day is filled with tragic accounts of war, famine, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, suicide bombers, genocide, fatal household accidents, child abuse, pornography, a zillion kinds of diseases, murder, death, destruction, hate, prejudice, ad infinitum ad nauseam. And its not all due to sugar!    OK, Ill cut George W. Bush some slack as a non-theologian walking a political tightrope, but it was both ironic and inconceivable to me that in the wake of the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center, with him and so many other public figures (theologians included) talking about good and evil, no one I heard made the linguistic connection that if you just take an o out of good and add a D to evil, you have the answer to why the horrible event happened! What we see all around us is the manifestation of the battle raging between G-o-d and the D-e-v-i-l.    What are they fighting about? The everlasting destiny of mankind. Each wants the allegiance of as many people as possible. The difference is that God wants people to freely love Him so He can do good for them, and the Devil wants to control people so he can do evil to them. That's for you to decide.|`|8Efiet86aa	you want some evidence that the devil exist, besides the obvious, murder, rape, theft etc....  I had a dream night that there was someone in the bed with me, it kept moving, then all of a sudden satan was holding me down, he was scary looking and mean(and no no horns). I couldn't talk, or scream. my words came  out as a whisper. so I kept repeating I am covered by the  blood of Jesus Christ over and over. and the more I said this the stronger my voice got and in time was able to wake myself up. and to you that don't believe in God that is just a nightmare, to us that believe it was satan or his demons. and we know without a doubt that Jesus will always answer our cry for help|`|2t5m4Jopaa	Yes I believe that the Devil exist. I mean, how can you explain the bad personalities in people. GOD's people are kind by nature and the Devil is trying to destroy that concept. But then again we were born as sinners because of Adam and Eve. The evidence is the events that have been happening. Man alone cannot create but so much chaos.|`|u4irXvZuaa	I believe in positive and negative energy|`|I93ynnVfaa	The Devil exists; Atheists are almost-living proof of that.      DEUTERONOMY 8:3.    3. And He humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger,   and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not,  neither did thy fathers know; that He might make thee know   "That Man doth not live by bread only,  but by every Word that proceedeth   out of The Mouth of the LORD doth Man live"    JOB 28:28.     28. "And unto Man He said,   'Behold, the Fear of The Lord, that is Wisdom;   and to depart from Evil is Understanding.' "       MATTHEW 13:19.    19. "When any one heareth The Word of The Kingdom,   and Understandeth it not, then cometh The Wicked One,  and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart."        LUKE 8:11-12.    11. "Now the Parable is this:   'The Seed is The Word of God.  12. 'Those by the Way Side   are they that hear;   then cometh The Devil,   and taketh away The Word   out of their hearts,   lest they should Believe and be saved."    GOD FEEDS ALL Living Things through His Word.   These are Packets of Information coded in Living Fire.  There are three streams- of Plants, of Insects, and of Animals.  The quality of our lives depends on how efficiently we use these Packets, which are sent to each living creature. Ordinary Humans use about 1% of theirs. This is barely enough to keep sinners alive.     Every TRUTH OF GOD we reject- Treat other as WE would be treated, maintain Sexual Discipline, Revere The Creator, Monitor ALL Sensory Input, Align and Recall Data, and so on- we LOSE LIFE ENERGY.    There is another species that FEEDS ON HUMANS who do not live up to their Human Responsibilities. These are The DEVILS. They exist.    They implant us at Birth with a TAP mechanism, that enables them to drain our life energies on a daily basis, because we are not defended, and because we are not raised to comprehend this draining, and resist it.       JOHN 1:1-4,9.    IN THE Beginning was the Word,   and the Word was with God,   and the Word was God.  2. The same was in The Beginning with God.  3. All things were made by Him;   and without Him was not any thing made that was made.  4. In Him was Life; and The Life was The Light of Men.  9. That was The True Light, Which lighteth every man   that cometh into The World.       1st JOHN 5:7.              REAL Bibles, only!    7. For there are three that bear record in Heaven,   The Father, The Word, and The Holy Ghost:   and these Three are One.    THE GREEK WORD for "WORD" in these New Testament verses is LOGOS, meaning, THE RECORDED WORD. This is THE-WORD-THAT-IS-GOD. This is what The Devils target. This is what they need to survive, having forfeited the ability to freely tap the free flow of Life energy from The Source.    It only takes as little as three days of prevention of the Devils from stealing our Life Force for us to accumulate enough Life Energy to begin to *see* (ESP).|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Not in the way the Fundies believe in the Devil.

A BAND OF Native Americans, who cam eto be known as LOS NUEVOS VIDENTES (The New Seers) suffering under European colonial dictatorship, tried to combat it by recovering the ancient spiritual Knowledge of their ancestors, step-by-step, without falling into the same aberrative traps that had done them in in the end.     They found that withstanding persecution enabled them to make spiritual gains they could not without it. They thus began to deliberately seek out a "PINCHES TIRANITOS," a Petty Tyrant (because the tyranny of Earthly dictators is as nothing before the superior spirit entities Out There,) to help them "tune their spirit."    They found that after putting up with their silly Human nonsense, they were much better able to stand up to Spiritually Demanding Forces.  Their gains were significant and substantial.

The term "Wahhabi" is a slanderous term, used to attack Muslims who believe in following the Noble Qur'an and the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, with the same interpretation as the Companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and the scholars throughout Islamic history who also followed this way. For more information, see the book's website at http://www.theWahhabiMyth.com , inshaa-Allaah the read will be quite beneficial and insightful. And anyone who has studied the biography of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhaab, will not find any evidence of "extremism."    ----  ABRIDGED EXCERPT from "The Wahabi Myth"    What is a Salafi and What is Salafism?    The reader will notice that the word "Wahhabi" is always indented with quotation marks here at http://www.theWahhabiMyth.com. Those who are labeled with this word do not themselves use this term, as it is used as a means of belittlement. The reasons for the rejection of this term are clearly outlined throughout this book. The correct way of referring to them is by terming them "Salafis", as they are those who adhere to the way of the "Salaf" - the Prophet Muhammad (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) and his companions.    Following the way of the Salaf is the way which has been legislated in the Quran and Sunnah, the very sources of Islam. The Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) said to his daughter Fatimah: "Indeed, I am for you a blessed Salaf." (1)    When asked about which was the correct and acceptable way of understanding Islam, the Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) replied by saying: "That which I and my companions are upon." (2)    Similarly, Allah says in the Quran that He is pleased with the companions "and also those who follow them exactly (in faith)." (3)    As such, He said regarding the Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him security) and his companions:    "So if they believe as you (i.e. the Salaf) believe, they are indeed rightly guided." (4)    All of the orthodox scholars of Islam followed the way of the Salaf in understanding religion. Early scholars such as Imam al-Awzaa'ee, who died 157 years after the Prophet's emigration to Medina, said: "Be patient upon the Sunnah, and stop where the people (i.e. where the Salaf) stopped, and say what they said, and refrain from what they refrained from, and follow the path of your righteous Salaf; for verily, sufficient for you is what was sufficient for them." (5)    Today, one of the famous Sunni schools of jurisprudence is named after a scholar named Abu Haneefah. Millions of Muslims all over the world ascribe themselves to his school of jurisprudence; those who the media would term "mainstream" Muslims. Regarding adherence to the Salafi methodology, he said, "Adhere to the narrations and way of the Salaf, and beware of newly invented matters (in religion), for all of it is innovation." (6)    The media claim that Salafis/"Wahhabis" believe that all those who do not follow their form of Islam are "heathens" (10) is a tall tale. Salafis believe that those Muslims who do not follow the understanding of the Salaf are not adhering to these and other clear texts. As such, they do not fall under the above-mentioned Quranic verse as being "rightly guided." Salafis distinguish between those who fall into religious innovation and those who fall into disbelief.    When considering the proofs which are contained within the Quran and Sunnah and the statements of all the orthodox scholars of Islam from the earliest generations to the present time, it becomes obvious that it is a great blunder for the media to refer to Salafism as being a new movement called "Wahhabism" which came about only two centuries ago during the time of Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab in Saudi Arabia.    "So after the truth, what else can there be, save error?" [Quran 10:32]  --------    ADDITIONAL NOTE:  For anyone interested in learning more, I encourage you to actually read the treatises of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhaab.

I don't think they all hate Shias, that would definitely be generalizing, and to be honest, I don't know how to tell whos a Wahhabi and whos a Salafi, and what the Wahhabis beliefs are. I think those who try and be as pious as possible are called Salafis or Wahhabis... we usually refer to the most religious sunnis as Salafies, not Wahhabis... Like you, I'm confused lol. I just know about the Salafis and they are just really religious and pious Sunni Muslims and some are good, some are bad. Some don't have a single thing against Shias, and some do. They strictly follow the Qur'an and sunnah. Sorry if I couldn't help lol. Salam :)|`|AA12279768	Al-Wahhaab is one of the Attributes of Allaah.    When people say so-and-so is Wahhaabi, they intend the following:    "A follower of Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhaab"    According to the 'Aqeedah of Islaam, a person who is Wahhaabi should be a follower of whom? al-Wahhaab.     Regardless, look at the insincerity of these people. If they were truthful they would say "Muhammadis" as the Shaykh they refer to is "Shaykh MUHAMMAD bin (son of) Abdul-Wahhaab" not Shaykh 'Abdul-Wahhaab, his father.    The name was first used by the British in India years after the death of Shaykh Muhammad bin Abdul-Wahhaab. Many of the indian scholars traveled to Yemen and Saudi Arabia, and they learned from the scholars and began preaching Islaam again in India. This troubled the British and they spread the term "Wahhabi". The ignorant Muslims took this and used against anyone who called against Shirk and Bid'ah.    The Rawaafidh Shee'ah have hatred towards the Shaykh because he leveled their shrines and graves where they used to worship the dead, such as in Karbala.    From Abul-Hayyaaj al-Asadee who said: "Alee Ibn Abee Taalib said to me: 'Shall I not send you for what the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sent me? That you deface all statues and pictures and that you level all elevated graves.'" Related by Muslim (3/61), Aboo Daawood (3/70), an-Nisaaee (1/285) and others.
ou20w5sCaa	Bismillahi Rahmani Rahim    Salaam Alaikum wa Rahmatullah    A Muslim woman is not obligated to pray or fast while she is menstruating or in the post-childbirth time when she is bleeding.  This is something that is agreed upon by all Muslim scholars and there is no disagreement on that.    Anyone who tells you otherwise does not have correct knowledge.  I see one person answered with a link to a website called submission .com or .org.  This site is well known as a deviant non-Muslim site that pretends to be Islamic.  They cover their deviance up with just enough real Islam to confuse those who are new to Islam.  You might know that there are two main sources of knowledge in Islam, the Holy Qur'an and the Sunnah of the Prophet, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him.  The people at the submission site are Qur'an only people who reject the Sunnah, and thus they are not Muslim.  I will give links to information about their deviant ways below, inshAllah.  Basically, if you reject the Sunnah and try to go by the Qur'an only, you will not be able to follow Islam correctly.  The Qur'an tells us to pray, but only by followin the example of the Prophet, pbuh, preserved in the Sunnah, can we pray in the right manner.  This is so for all things, including the laws on menstruation.      Please pay no attention to those who reject the Sunnah.  They are tiny in number but have a large internet presence.  May Allah keep you on the Straight Path, Ameen.    Fi Aman Allah,    Nancy Umm Abdel Hamid|`|gB5LP70Laa	This is something which Muhammad pbuh addressed with the women of his time     Aisha reported that Fatimah, the daughter of Abu Hubaish   Came to the Prophet and said: "O Messenger of Allah,   I am a woman who has a constant discharge of   Blood so I am not purified. Shall I give up prayer?"   He said: "No, that is a vein and not menses,   And when your menses comes, give up your prayer;   And when the time elapses, wash the blood from yourself and   Than pray.        Umm Salamah reported that a woman used to discharge   Blood at the time of the Prophet. Umm Salamah asked   Decision of the Prophet for her. He said: "Let her look   To the number of nights and days in a month which she   Used to have menses before that which attacked her,   And let her give up prayer proportionate to that in a   Month. When she finishes that, let her take bath   And let her tie a cloth over her private part and then let   Her say prayer        if u want to know more use the link below|`|UxYkISitaa	at the moment i have  no hadeeth book in hand to tell u frm ahadeeth but i'll tell u frm my limited knowledge..  -no praying  -no fasts (if its ramadan fast u have to cover up)  you can read the Quraan as long as u dont touch the text  u can read duaa books  -pple say u cant enter masaajed m not sure    hope i helped  salam alaikum|`|CDsLUCXUaa	omg it's just your period you're not a serial killer religion interferes with periods too?|`|ozpB4ADVaa	Menstruation : Natural body process created by god for procreation.

Seriously - humanity would have not been able to procreate without women and menstruation.|`|9oQ0AwiBaa	I'll probably get low ratings for this but I follow the Quran first and there is nothing in it that prohibits menstrating women from anything except sex. If men and women are equal, as it says in the Quran, why would one sex not be able to pray? Why prohibit worship?      From www.submission.org      Nowhere in the Quran does it say that women cannot fast, pray, or worship in any other way during their menstruation. This is an innovation. We have to know that any rule telling us NOT to worship God under this or the other circumstance must be from Satan, not from God. The only thing prohibited during menstruation is sexual intercourse as given in 2:222. But the ignorant use this verse to base this false idea about women not being able to pray or fast during menstruation. They claim that it says that women are unclean during menstruation, and therefore cannot be allowed to pray.     [2:222] They ask you about menstruation: say, "It is harmful; you shall avoid sexual intercourse with the women during menstruation; do not approach them until they are rid of it. Once they are rid of it, you may have intercourse with them in the manner designed by GOD. GOD loves the repenters, and He loves those who are clean."|`|mOWyzwubaa	Ayesha said, "The Prophet used to place a pillow in my lap even though I would be menstruating, and then he would recite the Quran." (Bukhari, vol 1pg 197 Book of Bath)  Can even an ordinary Muslim, do this?!    Hadith 305 Kitabul Haydh on 1:201 too is a grave insult to aesthetics and common sense. Narrating the method of achieving purity after menstruation, it is advised that the woman grab a cotton swab scented with musk and, then touch the area tainted with blood. Ayesha pulled her toward her for further explanation! Does the Mullah preach  this to his family?    Hazrat Ayesha narrated that the Prophet (S) used to kiss his wives and had intercourse with them while he was observing Saum (Abstinence). (Bukhari pg 226, vol 1) [Bukhari, Kitab-us-Saum vol 1 pg 691, Hadith 1798-9 in Hamid & Co Printers, Lahore]    Ayesha said, When Rasoolullah desired to have intercourse with me while I menstruated, he would order me to tie a piece of cloth around my waist. (Bukhari, The Book of Menstruation vol 1 pg 24)  - If the Prophet wanted to have intercourse with a menstruating wife, he ordered her to tie a loincloth even though the menstruation would be at its peak. Then he had intercourse. (Same)  Whoever has concocted this Hadith adds a contrary statement: Ayesha said, "No one of you has as much control over his desire as the Rasool  had!" (The Book on Menstruation 1:98, chapter 207)  Our Mullahs try to defend this insult by stating that the Jews had gone to the extremes concerning a menstruating woman. They wont even touch her, eat with her or sit on the same bed etc. The exalted Prophets intention was to negate the extremes. But  then, he could have simply instructed the Muslims to avoid those extremes.

It is haraam for a menstruating woman to pay both obligatory and naafil prayers, and they are not valid if she does them. She does not have to do a particular prayer unless she was pure or became pure with enough time to perform a complete rakah, in which case she has to do the prayer, whether it is at the beginning of the time for it or at the end. An example of that happening at the beginning of the time for prayer is a woman who got her menses after the sun set but she had enough time to perform a complete rakah (but she did not do it), so when she becomes pure she has to make up that Maghrib prayer, because she had enough time to perform a complete rakah before she got her menses.     An example of that happening at the end of the time for prayer is a woman whose menses ended before the sun rose and there was enough time left to perform a complete rakah. When she becomes pure she has to make up that Fajr prayer, because she had enough time to perform one rakah.     But if there is not enough time to perform a rakah, such as in the first scenario, if a woman gets her menses a moment after the sun sets or, in the second scenario, she becomes pure a moment before the sun rises, then she does not have to do that prayer, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever catches up with a rakah of prayer has caught up with the prayer. Agreed upon.       With regard to dhikr, takbeer, saying Subhaan-Allaah, praising Allaah, saying Bismillaah when eating and so on, and reading hadeeth, fiqh and duaas, or saying Ameen to duaas, and listening to Quraan, none of these things are forbidden to her. It is proven in al-Saheehayn and elsewhere that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to recline in Aaishahs lap (may Allaah be pleased with her) when she was menstruating, and he would recite Qur'aan.     In al-Saheehayn it is also narrated from Umm Atiyyah that she heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: Let the girls who have attained puberty, women in seclusion and menstruating women go out  i.e., to the Eid prayer  and witness good and the gathering of the believers. But let the menstruating women avoid the prayer place.     With regard to the menstruating woman reading Quraan, if she is looking at it or thinking of it in her heart, without speaking the words out loud, there is nothing wrong with that, such as if the Mus-haf is placed there, and she looks at the verses and reads them in her heart. Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim: it is permissible and there is no difference of scholarly opinion on this point.     But if she is reciting it out loud, the majority of scholars are of the view that this is not allowed.     Al-Bukhaari, Ibn Jareer, al-Tabari and Ibn al-Mundhir said it is permissible, and this was also narrated from Maalik and from al-Shaafai in his former view. That was narrated from them in Fath al-Baari. And al-Bukhaari narrated in a muallaq report from Ibraheem al-Nakhai that there is nothing wrong with her reciting a verse.     Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Fataawa: There is no report saying that she should not read Quraan. The hadeeth No menstruating woman or person who is junub should recite anything from the Quraan is a weak hadeeth, according to the consensus of the scholars who are well-versed in hadeeth. Women used to menstruate at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and if reading was haraam for them as prayer is, this would have been something that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained to his ummah and the Mothers of the Believers would have known that, and it would have been something that they told to the people. But since no one narrated any prohibition concerning that from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), it is not permissible to regard it as haraam, since it is known that he did not forbid that, and as he did not forbid that despite the fact that menstruation was widespread at his time, it is known that it is not haraam. End quote.     Since we know that there is a difference of opinion among the scholars concerning this, what should be said is: it is better for a menstruating woman not to recite Qur'aan out loud except when there is need for that, such as if she is a teacher and she needs to teach her students, or in the case of an exam when the student needs to recite in order to be tested, and so on.|`|8FbJjRpwaa	your wudhu breaks hun when you bleed right? and menstruation is just that right (bleeding)?  hope you understand =]  no prayer  no quran unless u dnt touch the text  cnt member nothing else ~|`|7bnQmXksaa	No praying, no sex, No reading or opening the book.

The standard operating procedure is to tip 10%. Servers in a restaurant make less than minimum wage. It is assumed that tips make up the difference. However, it is recognized that you are not sitting at a table and being waited on. Nevertheless it is still a server that is serving you when they could be otherwise occupied getting a higher tip for a table where everyone is sitting down. Then again that is why take out tips are reccomended to be at 10% vs 15 to 20% for sit down service.|`|JcwjDpY8aa	No.  People who work in chain restaurants such as applebees, chilis, etc. make a higher hourly wage than the regular servers.  They are doing their job requirement which is simple- take an order over the phone, put it in a bag when its ready, and make change for you.  There is no reason for a tip here- they do not work hard enough to deserve $11-$15 an hour wage from to go tips plus their over-minimum hourly wage itself.    To-go workers are NOT servers, they are not trained to serve people as the other servers have been trained, and they have a simple job very comparable to a retail cashier.    If you are referring to me, I DO work in the food service industry- I am a food safety inspector AS WELL as a F.O.H. manager in a restaurant.  Thanks for all the thumbs down, to -go workers, should we start tipping the Walmart cashiers too?  If someone is making 10 cents an hour, they are obviously working in an illegal establishment.|`|YvjTJPEfaa	I only tip if service was provided, if I'm picking up the food myself then no, if the food is delivered to my door then yes (extra if the weather is shitty or I am drunk).|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	Yes. I tip $1 per box, at least.    The server who gives you your to-go order has often been assigned to that duty all day. That means he or she is taking fewer tables inside the restaurant and making fewer tips. He/she still only gets $2 an hour.    I used to work a restaurant that did it that way and I might make $30 in a night if I worked to-go (and most of that from the one or two regular tables I'd have), but $100 or more waiting tables.    Its simply not fair to deprive someone of their income just because you're too cheap to lay down a few bucks. Don't want to tip? Go to the grocery store and make it yourself, or go to the drive-thru.|`|4ESlizXraa	No, and when I worked as a waitress we didn't expect tips on to go orders.    People aren't being jerks when they don't tip you for telling them hello and taking their payment and handing them their order then watching them walk out.  You didn't have to clear a table, they didn't take up a table, you didn't have to give them drinks or silverware or anything that someone who comes into the restaurant and sits to eat gets.  You handed them their food, took their money, just like someone at the grocery store or department store.

True, someone took the time to bag my stuff, but I also don't tip bagboys or cashiers.  I tip waitstaff for having waited on me.      The point to tipping is to show appreciation for jobs that, otherwise, would amount to servitude.  No one has served me in a to-go order so no one gets tipped.      Further, in this economy, the business should consider my to-go order as a deal on their part, they didn't have to pay a waitperson the hourly rate they would have had to pay had I sat down to eat.    On the other hand, I tip a minimum of 30% on delivery orders.|`|912184e16e910db90a6979b2d6ebeeb9aa	There's no set rules here. Sometimes I tip, sometimes I don't.

I believe that the Bible is the Word of the Living God, so it's really good that His Word get's out there to the people, and everyone get's there morals from the Bible. And the laws that apply today are from the Bible, so I find it very intriguing.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	What a babbler. Complaining about the Bible by bringing it up yet ONE MORE TIME. Why is it okay when you do it. Then someone else will go one more. It's boring. Be a big boy and just stop, okay.    I shouldn't have to tell you this.|`|AA11264399	It doesn't.  Religion is a thing of the past - it's irrelevant now.|`|5k2GI5ZYaa	nothin has to revolve around the bible   your life should revolve around your perception of reality not around dogma that is meant to control you thru fear concepts and keep your mind closed to its own expansion of consciousness|`|FOZGMadaaa	Because everything and anything revolves around God's word. God made things happen.    He sent his word to heal us.|`|iHFZLsDTaa	The Bible is a teaching book.    Start reading one verse in the Old Testament and one verse in the New Testament every morning before your start your day.  Your mind and heart will soon be opened and you will understand the meaning of the Bible and God.    If you want to learn even more, read Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and Acts three times in 30 days.  This will get it into your mind and heart.    You can also say, "God, show me what it is that you want me to know about You and the Bible".  And He will.|`|04eaa3b707fecc377d89a52d2fb4afa9aa	The central topic in the Holy Bible is God.  The center of our life should be our relationship with God.  Just because we have knowledge about God does not mean that we have a personal relationship with Him.  The closer we draw to God the more we reflect God's character.  The further from God we are the more we reflect our character defects.

I don't think the bible was ever meant to be a book to live your life by, I think it was more or less supposed to be filled with stories so you could learn moral lessons about "right" and "wrong" or "good" and "bad". The bible was used to control people when Kings worked with the church and they wanted to control their people/kingdoms. There are too many flaws with the biblical writings for me to take it seriously or to take anyone who follows it seriously. According to old bible text, you are supposed to stone your children to death if they disobey you?|`|QyoZq1z2aa	Catholics don't worship the bible, but worship God.

I'd ask him if he ever had a hard time living by his own rules, or did it just come easily to him to love other people no matter what, even when they were being jerks to him?

4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	I would indeed like to shake his hand, if the opportunity ever presented itself. He is a remarkable hero indeed. Tears came to my eyes as Sully & the other crew members walked on to the field during the Super Bowl. What a fitting tribute!  While Sully doesn't see himself as being a hero, he is just that in my eyes & in the eyes & hearts of many.    **Hero pilot, Chesley Sullenberger's local library, has told him not to worry about a borrowed book stuck in the hold of U.S. Airways Flight 1549. After he contacted the library, to ask for an extension, the staff not only waived all overdue & replacement fees, but they will dedicate the volume to Sullenberger, restocked. The name of the book he had borrowed was "Professional Ethics." **    **There is already talk about building a statue of Chesley B. Sullenberger. Lucrative book & movie deals could follow.**|`|89d8b42fd2f09137ee437b1d438fa9a8aa	Would I like to meet him? ... yes ... I'm sure I could come up w/ a few questions I'd like to ask. But, (not to diminish his efforts even though he must have been equally concerned for his survival as much as the others on board) he was just doing the job that he handsomely gets paid for. Granted, someone else may have choked under the conditions but I would consider that more of a failure than raising accolades of heroism for the one that did the job correctly.  A hero (in my book) is one that needlessly risks their life to save another beings life. Even the pilot has tried to denounce his heroism.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	It is reassuring and renews my faith in the American People when one of ours displays courage and concern for the welfare of fellow Americans and people of all extractions.

He was a qualified and trained pilot that payed attention to his responsibilities. Took them serious. Stayed out of the airport bar before take off. We have seen that with others in the past.  I think he did what he was being paid to do and a responsibility that he took seriously and that benefited many people.  He is a hero in my book.  I am thinking that from the interviews with him and his wife that they would like all this to go away so that they could live a normal life again.|`|g0gMQUCVaa	Oh my gosh, he was one cool customer wasn't he!

r6fGmJK1aa	You trust your BF that much?    You need to educate yourself on what causes hemorrhoids.    If your this insecure with your relationship, then maybe you should not have a BF.|`|d7oz9FV6aa	That is preposterous. Just ask him.|`|sXnoIFRsaa	Increased straining during bowel movements, by constipation or diarrhea, may lead to hemorrhoids.[3] It is thus a common condition due to constipation caused by water retention in women experiencing premenstrual syndrome or menstruation.    Hypertension, particularly portal hypertension, can also cause hemorrhoids because of the connections between the portal vein and the vena cava which occur in the rectal wall -- known as portocaval anastomoses.[4]    Obesity can be a factor by increasing rectal vein pressure. Sitting for prolonged periods of time can cause hemorrhoids. Poor muscle tone or poor posture can result in too much pressure on the rectal veins.    Pregnancy may lead to hypertension and increase strain during bowel movements, so hemorrhoids are often associated with pregnancy.    Excessive consumption of alcohol or caffeine can cause hemorrhoids.[5] Both can cause diarrhea. Note that caffeine ingestion increases blood pressure transiently, but is not thought to cause chronic hypertension. Alcohol can also cause alcoholic liver disease leading to portal hypertension.

People, pretend to seek what is cleverly called, interesting     conversation, yeah right. if i don't wish to reveal something     personal, i simply won't state it the first place, but the last     thing i'll do is embellish it, trust me, i'm the same way in real     life, i say what i mean and mean what i say or i just won't say it.      I'm always amazed at the irony of internet, as well as saddened    a bit by the abuse of it, one would think people would want to be    more truthful, i mean look at the opportunity to actually interact    with each other in a positive way so as to make the world a better    and safer place, but then like every thing else, as usual the internet     has been lowered to the status of a weapon, instead of a tool of i    innovation . . .

You are totally wrong on that account because this moron went out and found the rebound guy and the rebound guy never ever works out.

Alright, now that he wont masturbate any time soon, he'll get urges to. The day the project is done with, sleep over his house. When he's asleep, put a picture of a naked girl in one corner and a naked guy in the other corner of his room. Throw a little bottle of lotion at him to wake him up, but quickly so you can act asleep. He will see the lotion, and see the pictures. Whichever corner he goes to to rock out with his cokc out, then youll know if hes gay or not.  Got it?  good.|`|EoF8agF0aa	how about you just let him be himself and when he's ready, if he's gay, he'll tell you.

I got news for you JESUS IS RESURRECTED and HE IS ALIVE.  Satan's seductions and lies embroil the whole Roman Catholic system with deception; he wants people not to believe the TRUTH of Christ's Resurrection ONCE AND FOR ALL.  In fact, the "Jesus" of Roman Catholicism is "ANOTHER" Jesus, Satan's Jesus, NOT the TRUE JESUS of the Gospels.|`|AA11225089	I'm in a new frontiers church, and taking the bread and wine is one of the things Jesus asks us to do, in remembrance of what he did for us.|`|tfuPCVzOaa	With any doubt about Christianity it is always advisable to refer to God's Word and I quote from the King James Version.    1Co 11:23  For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:   1Co 11:24  And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.   1Co 11:25  After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.   1Co 11:26  For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.   1Co 11:27  Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.   1Co 11:28  But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.     Jesus said about the bread and wine "this do in remembrance of me."|`|s7pqFa1eaa	It is not as important to non-Catholics, you know how protestants change the rules just to be arbitrary.|`|uz9GtV9vaa	I'm a protestant, and I don't even remember what the Eucharist is.|`|FGcwxZz0aa	Catholics see the Scriptures written about the Eucharist as literal teaching by Jesus and have interpreted Jesus words as literal since before the NT Scriptures were written as recorded in Scripture. Catholics find no reason to interpret Jesus teaching to be anything but literal from a hermeneutical, historical or theological perspective.       Some Protestants, on the other hand, are very much like the proto-Protestants who were former disciples and left Jesus after His teaching in John 6, about the commandment to eat His Body and drink His Blood. They remain in the carnal sense and deny the miracle of the Eucharist. They believe that instead of being present at the one sacrifice of Christ, that what Jesus instituted is a symbolic ordinance instead.      So, what we are speaking of is two totally different practices. The first identical to what the apostles taught and put into practice which is the real presence and the second a modernist interpretation of a man Ulrich Zwingli which is a symbolic ordinance. The first is actually Christ on the Cross where the worshippers are at the foot of the cross; the second is just a remembering of what Christ did as recorded in the Bible. When a Catholic Christian remembers Christs sacrifice it is from being there, when a Protestant remembers Christs sacrifice it is recalling what is written in Scriptures about the event. Certainly, one should be able to understand the level of passion one would have after being at the foot of the cross compared to the level of one just remembering what is written in a book. So even though some do not take it lightly, even though they do not believe, it cannot be the same passion for an exercise or ordinance in supposed obedience, as the Protestant act can be described; to the Catholic practice of being present with the living corporeal Christ at the cross and eating His real body and Blood as He commanded.       It must be noted for understanding that for many of the Reformers that this approach by Zwingli was necessary to give some credibility to the new Protestant movement which denied the successive apostolic leadership of the Church established by Christ. These reformers knew full well that they had no true legitimacy and no authority from Christ. They also knew that without a legitimate episcopacy that they could not continue Holy Orders, the Sacraments nor do they have the authority to confect the Eucharist which authority can only be given by Christ through the Church. Therefore, they could not continue the Eucharist even if they desired without a valid priesthood.       So, I am not saying that I do not believe that Protestant communion service is not special or a sign of unity but it is to me a sign of unity for a false, heretical belief outside of historical, Traditional and orthodox Christianity and is a doctrine of men warned about in the Gospels.      (Mat 15:7 DRB) Hypocrites, well hath Isaias prophesied of you, saying:(Mat 15:8 DRB) This people honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me.(Mat 15:9 DRB) And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and commandments of men.      (Mar 7:5 DRB) And the Pharisees and scribes asked him: Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, but they eat bread with common hands?      (Mar 7:6 DRB) But he answering, said to them: Well did Isaias prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.      (Mar 7:7 DRB) And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and precepts of men.      (Mar 7:8 DRB) For leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the washing of pots and of cups: and many other things you do like to these.(Mar 7:9 DRB) And he said to them: Well do you make void the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.      (Luk 6:46 DRB) And why call you me, Lord, Lord; and do not the things which I say?      In Christ  Fr. Joseph|`|xo1fabj6aa	To me it a symbol of Christ's sacrifice.

Remember John the Baptist: 'Make a straight way for the Lord.'  Meaning repent of your sins and receive the Lord in your self and be a chosen one of God?  I think this is about Confession, but protestants don't believe in it therefore what now follows is unreachable for them.  The Church is the body of Christ and every true believer is a stone of the building everyone has a function in it we are all part of the same body that's why Jesus said this is my body, this is my blood.  When you have confessed all your sins then you can receive your first Body and Blood of Christ actually knowing what it really means.  Jesus can't be too happy about all these different denominations in HIS Church. His body is one not many, we should stop arguing and accept what He said quite clearly: THIS IS MY BODY, THIS IS MY BLOOD. He didn't say this is a symbol of my body and blood.  'Do this in memory of me' doesn't mean that what he said before is not true.

Make him his favorite foods, watch his favorite movie, rub his back, and anything else that he likes and we would both want to do together.

When I saw her, just trying to take a walk, and being ogled by tourists, I thought about how annoying that must be.     I could definitely be friends, and more, with a little person. If you put all of my past lovers in a room together, the only thing they had in common was that they were all men. They were all handsome to me, but maybe not to everyone. The more I know someone, the more attractive they get. I think that if I were attracted to a person's character and personality, little or not, I could be with them.    I also think that a little person would have dealt with adversity, which builds character. They might understand what it's like to be different. That could be a plus. Especially if they had a positive attitude.|`|2iqSofzYaa	i have no problem with dwarfs.

The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|EM0kiImHaa	I'm here to glorify God in everything I do.|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	it's better than the alternative at the moment|`|AA11396388	I think we all experience problems in our life's, heartache and joy.  We are all amazingly different and yet very similar at the same time.  Most people emphasise the differences people have and yet we all love to feel part of society in some way. We are all still learning how to be human and how to live our lives.

It doesn't matter what you believe, he wants us ALL DEAD and BURNING IN HELL.    God, on the other hand, wants us to rediscover Him and reconcile our hearts back to Him so that we will be SAVED FROM HELL.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	The only way to get into heaven is by believing in Jesus without adding any of your own works.     We're all sinners. Only Jesus is acceptable payment for sins, because Jesus died on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead.     All the good deeds in the world won't pay for even ONE of your sins. All the trying to be a "good person" won't pay for even ONE of your sins. Doing "religious activites" won't pay for even ONE of your sins.     Either Jesus pays for your sins, or you pay for them in eternal torment in hell. That is the choice before you.    So believe in Jesus as God and Savior without adding any of your own works, and you're saved, that simple (John 3:16), and you will NEVER be sent to hell, no matter what. :)  Jesus loves you so very much!  :)|`|G96GCH9Uaa	Christians didn't say that, God did.|`|P6atY3xXaa	They lack knowledge of the Bible.    Revelation 20:  KJV  13And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.      14And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.     Hell is the grave, temporary rest all get a resurrection out of.  Acts 24:15.    Satan shares in the punishment, he does not give it out.  Those who go to heaven (saints) do the punishing.  Rev. 20:4-6, 1 Cor. 6:2, 3.  It is why they go to heaven.  They are the ones who spend eternity taking care of that.    Not a great life if you believe hell is a place of eternal burning and you are one of the rulers who is going to have to turn the spit all day and night.

Hell was orignally created for the devil and his angels.  But those who have not served the Lord, and who's names are not written in the book of life will go there also.  I do not read anywhere in the Word of God that they will be tormented by the devil, only that he will be there as well.    Revelation 20:15  And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.  Revelation 21:8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.  Revelation 20:10  And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.    Revelation 19:20  And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.|`|253e6b2bad99caee34d55cd7b6a38ec0aa	It's not what Christians say that matters.  It is what God says to us and did for us that is important.    John 3:16-18 (New International Version)     16"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.     17For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.     18Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.    We are born lost because of the fall of Adam.  It is Jesus who brings us back to God.|`|AA11723247	Satan and all the fallen angels will also be tormented day and night in the lake of fire and brimstone.    They are not being tortured, but paying the reasonable price for their sins.  Perhaps, now you can see what a big deal Christ's death and resurrection was for everyone who places their faith in Christ as the only Son of God.|`|GTjkWZPlaa	A true Christian wouldn't say that, because if you know your Christian bible, Satan is going to be bound in hell and suffer for eternity himself.  At the end of days he will have no power.  He is the enemy of God, so therefore God wouldn't give him this power.    The Bible does say however, that non-believers will be thrown in fire and there will be knashing of teeth.  I'm not sure if it actually states who will be doing the torturing.    However, being a Christian myself, I don't think any one of us has the right to actually tell someone they are going to hell.  Only God knows that.  We are suppose to act with love and forginess as Jesus taught.  If you are concerned about someone's salvation, then you should lovingly pray for them.  Telling them they are going to hell, I think, would only push them away.|`|aoycZJMGaa	Wow...I cant believe some of these answers. Pretty scary what people think. But here's the Truth....if you read the Bible turn to the Book of John. It clearly says "I am the way, the truth and the life...NO ONE comes to the father but through ME"!!! So in other words if you want to go to Heaven you MUST go through Jesus in order to do it. PERIOD...there's just NO other way...it DOESN'T matter how good of a person you are....if you DO NOT believe in God and and you have not given your life to Jesus your name WILL NOT be in the book of life and you WILL NOT be going to Heaven. There's no way around it.It doesnt matter who you are..Christian or Non Christian...the Bible states it clearly and the Bible doesn't lie....read it and you will see. If you know God, you KNOW Jesus, and you follow his Word you WILL be seeing him when its time!! Looks like there's a LOT of people who need to read more :((|`|tGAt3ZKkaa	i'm christian but I know what it must feel like to hear that.  Really Satan still punishes those who don't believe in God because, the only PEOPLE Satan doesn't punish are satanist's.    The reason for the fact the Atheists are known to go to hell is because they follow the sins of satan by not believing in God, when even satan believes in God.    I may be wrong, but if you think about it, it sounds kinda right, but still.          (to any atheist who don't believe in God because they think he wouldn't care any way or something, go here     http://www.wirenot.net/X/Articles/2008/M...

According to christians, anyone who has not 'found' jesus will go to hell. Nevermind if they happen to be born in India to hindus and follow the religion of their parents. It is their responsibility to 'find' jesus or be tortured forever.    Note that only 32% of population are christians. This means that 4,080,000,000 people currently alive (nevermind those already dead) are going to hell where they will be tortured for eternity.    A god of infinite mercy indeed.    EDIT:    Jim, I would ask yourself this, what's more likely:    - god would send 4 billion people to hell for the crime of being born into the wrong religion    or    - the church invented hell to put a-sses in the seats (sorry, I should say pews).    Doesn't strike you as a bit odd that god's criteria for getting into heaven is doing everything the pope says and giving him 10% of your income? Not, say, living a good life or being a good person.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	agree with jeff s|`|AA11923447	I'm a Christian. Of course, I've never said any such thing. I support freedom of religion, which includes freedom from religion. The torture would be God's responsibility, as He purportedly engineered the concept of Hell in the first place. The "free will" argument fails on multiple levels. The Fundamentalist concept of Hell admits that God created flawed human beings, and subsequently allowed for them to be tortured forever for being exactly what they are: flawed. He made them capable of making lousy choices, and then burns them eternally if they make those choices. The choices in this multiple-choice exam come with a complete lack of tangible evidence that the choices are either correct or incorrect. This makes no sense to me.|`|QnH9QuQwaa	Those are Christians who listen to others instead of reading their Bible.  I wouldn't worry about it much.  Do your best to be a good person to others and learn as much as you can about your world.  You should be fine.    Judgemental Christians should be more worried about their own fate.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	The torture of Hell is mainly one thing, a realization (which you share with the Devil) : That you have eternally missed what really would have satisfied you and it is ALL YOUR OWN FAULT.

First of all God judges, not man. Secondly, Satan doesn't rule in Hell and has no power there, thirdly, Satan hates mankind.    Hell is an eternal separation from God.

vmv1rP76aa	Faery Wicca, like its title, emphasizes spellwork with faeries and elemental spirits. It has a bigger basis in nature (Wicca already is nature-based).     Although they are not Wiccan, I would suggest reading Doreen's Virtue on Faeries 101, and Healing with the Faeries if you're really interested in them.|`|FmazIF6Maa	Wicca doesn't have an organized church that governs it, but there are many different types of Wicca.    Fairy Wicca is pretty much a neo-Wiccan/New Age version of Wicca, kind of like "Wicca Light."     My daughter has a fairy Wicca book she bought when she was a young teen at a festival we were at, I read through it. It's a lot of fluff to me (I was trained by traditional lineaged Wiccans) but hey, just cause it's not my cup of tea doesn't mean it isn't yours.    Just watch the resources, seems a lot of these are a bit misleading about traditions and history. Not the most scholarly oriented group of writers in my opinion, so take all the inspiration you want from the rituals and practices, but take any facts or history you read with a grain of salt; don't let your reasearch end there.|`|b87ee48fefd1b77d6c3a85c60296ca26aa	Faery Wicca, or Fairy Wicca is an umbrella term that refers to any tradition of modern Wicca that places an emphasis on the Fae (gnomes, elves, faeries, sprites, etc.), their lore, and their relation to the natural world. It may also refer to a specific tradition of Wicca, founded by author Kisma Stepanich.    Faery Wiccan traditions are tied to nature, particularly seasonal changes and the solar and lunar calendar.Adherents of Stepanich's Faery Wicca claim that it recovers the traditions of an ancient fairy race called the Tuatha De Danaan, the mythological precursors to the Celtic people; however, this is disputed by those familiar with ancient Celtic polytheism and mythology. Stepanich's Faery Wicca draws liberally on some degree of Irish mythology, from the author's interpretation of Celtic history, legend, pseudohistory, imagination, and a variety of non-Celtic sources.|`|KVBTtF9faa	Have you tried googling it?     I would have to guess that Faery Wicca probably places a lot of emphasis on the Fae creatures and working with Faeries.     I used to have that Faerie Oracle you mentioned. I loved the artwork.

8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	Hi there, firstly I am saddened to hear about all the despair and abuse you have suffered but I think it is an awesome miracle that you are now ready to forgive those who have brought you so much pain.  That is the work of the Holy Spirit in your life.  Praise God.    You may be interested to read The bait of Satan by John Bevere.  Unfortunately I do not have the isbn number as I have loaned the book to a friend but it a book about forgiveness.    I love these few quotes that i have read recently - 'forgiveness is given, reconciliation is earned'.   Although forgiveness and reconciliation are related they are quite distinct.  Another one is "unforgiveness destroys the bridge over which one day I may need to cross".    Yes as God forgives you so you are required to forgive.  Luke 6v37.  Read also Luke23v34 - Jesus asks his Father to forgive the ones who crucified him!    What I believe will happen to you is that forgiveness will be a journey for you.  You have taken the first step by coming to the place where you think you are ready to forgive in your heart.  Just take that first step, God will honour you in it.  Dont rush, forgiveness is a process and dont rush the process or you wont make the progress.  More than likely a time will come when you are ready to write a letter/speak to them, but it wont all happen at once so take your time.  There is a process of healing happening in you at the same time too.    God has done many miracles in my heart with regard to forgiveness, and what you must always remember is YOU are the winner when you forgive.  Forgiveness sets you FREE.  And it is for freedom that Christ has set us free!  Amen.    I have heard of people forgiving those who rape them, one couple forgave the man who killed their son and then visited him in prison and wrote to him.  I believe these things are only attainable by the grace of God.    Sorry this has been long.   Please try and read John Bevere's book.  He is an excellent communicator of the Word of God and is such a no-compromise kind of guy, hopefully this will help you on your journey.  Also have you heard of Joyce Meyer and Paua White, Beth Moore?  These are 3 prominent women in ministry who were abused.  Joyce Meyer especially is very open about what happened to her.  www.joycemeyer.org.    Every blessing x|`|zketnefNaa	There is a BIG difference between forgiveness and reconciliation; we are commanded to forgive, not to reconcile.    Paul tells us not to be unequally yoked with unbelievers, if your family is not a Christian family, then to reconcile would be hypocritical.    However, forgiveness means that if you see them approaching on the sidewalk, you do not feel the need to cross the street, but neither the need to confront them, but just to pass them by as you would any stranger who has never offended you.|`|euR9yXD4aa	Yes, you to to forgive them completely.  Just keep praying every day that God will give you the strength to forgive them.  They will have their own judgement day at some point, and they will suffer the consequences for their actions.  God knows the hurt in your heart, and please just believe that He will help you along your way.|`|uZcuKmtsaa	NO WAY..... R U CRAZY?.......your filthy brother molested u & you will forgive that.....go to the police & report to the highest authority.........this is ur right.......its your life you cant let anyone spoil it.......

I wanted to forgive for a long time before I Truly could  It is hard  But The  rewards like life with Christ  is  out of this  WORLD  LOL|`|IXBUaXDeaa	I think that it is amazing to see what God can do and how powerful he makes us. The fact that you have come to have the forgiveness in your heart is encouraging. If you feel like you are able to forgive them in your heart then you should let them know (I would just write a letter). Even though you are forgiving them for what they have done in the past, it does NOT mean that you need to see them or try to work on that relationship again. God gives us power through hard times, but He does not want us to set ourselves up for more than we can handle or for us to live in misery. He obviously sent some great people into your life to help you through the problems that they caused you. Other than doing your part in forgiving them and letting them know that you forgive them, you have no other tie to them. I believe that you are such a strong person, don't let people take advantage of that; Keep moving forward:)|`|zhaHc4FAaa	If you harbor any bitterness toward them for your hurt then you are not healed and have not truly forgiven.   Look at it like this....God gave you undeserved Grace.  You didn't deserve and you certainly haven't done anything to earn it...he gave it freely to you....even though you lie, speed down the road, disobey, didn't go to church....He loved you enough to send his son down here to die for your sins.   I understand your pain and hurt as some of those same things have happened to me as well but I have forgiven those people in my heart.   It took a very long time to forgive but I have asked God to take care of the pain and hurt and I leave the consequences up to him.   I see my family and talk to them but the past is the past and dredging it up will not solve anything.   It was not right that those things happened to you and I am sorry that those things did.   As long as we live on this Earth there will be alot of evil and corruption.   I would suggest to pray to God about this situation and seek his guidance - - the answer will come - - be still and listen to him speak to your heart.    Good luck and you are in my prayers|`|houWY7qvaa	You have already forgiven in your heart.  You don't need to see them in person.  There will be a right time to clear things up in person.  You don't have to subject yourself to people who have no remorse in their own hearts.|`|cIPziIdnaa	Forgiveness is a full-time 24/7 job with some people, not a one time shot.  I call it the "seven times seventy" state of forgiveness, where you have to forgive the same people over and over again because they continue to hurt you.  The forgiveness I learned over the years - and with much therapy - is really designed to help you, so you don't have to live with all this anger, bitterness and resentment.    In this situation, your forgiveness could simply be letting go of the past and letting God deal with your family in His way.  But you also need healthy boundaries and under these circumstances, I would agree - you should not see your family until you are ready.  It may take years; or that day may never come.  Either way, I would encourage you to continue to pray for a forgiving, compassonate heart; and to pray for your family, that God may comfort and heal them.    So yes, forgiveness in your heart is enough.  Some times it is all we have.|`|nrnVqh7iaa	Are you ready to get crucified?  Turn the other cheek and all that?    I don't forgive or forget.|`|041b0462d79f0e5c2d4dc32dfd70d958aa	I know it is hard to forgive especially in your case, and no  My family is the greatest family that I know at lest to me.  Did we get along not always I and my dad war with each other there when I was around 16 to 25 but then I grew up.  I was attacked at work by a fellow associate they beat the crape out of me because they thought I had reported them sleeping on the job and had gotten them fired.  But after it was all over I was more angry at the person who did report them and added my name to the list of people you sign a document saying they saw them sleeping.  But I forgave them.  I know it is not the same in no way but God expect us to forgive no matter what that person has done to us.  I can tell you this if you let them know in person that you truly forgive them for the way they treated you it will do you more good than it will them.  Only God can change their hearts because in their eyes they have done no wrong.

It does NOT mean enslaving yourself to the wishes of others or becoming a doormat.  It means you should have the proper motivation, the welfare of others.  Even a prime minister, president, general or cleric should be motivated by genuine regard for what other people need, not how a deed will look or how much easier it will make one's job.|`|e4ef6e28e838dad7d38eeeff4eb720e4aa	Keeps down PRIDE !

AA11272456	Incredible. I just got done reading these accounts in the Bible during my lunch hour, only to come on-line and see your question.      You are right when you say a major event must occur to motivate a change.  But it will have to be an internal change, even as it was with Esau.  Consider:  Jacob and Esau were 120 years old when their father, Isaac died. But long before this, Jacob and Esau met and, according to Genesis 33:4, embraced each other, kissed each his brother and burst into tears.  This was not the occasion of the burial of their father but much earlier.  Moreover, Jacob had never harbored hatred for Esau, it was Esau who harbored hatred for Jacob.  Here, however, Esau's heart had softened.  What caused Esau to change his heart?  The Bible does not say but it was not his father's death.      As for Isaac and Ishmael, it is true that they came together to bury their father Abraham.  But there is nothing to indicate that Ishmael really hated Isaac.  He persecuted him at a young age, true; but Ishmael became a wealthy man; nations came out of him, from his sons - twelve chieftains.  Nothing to suggest that his father's death brought him peaceably to Isaac.    People must change themselves, individually.  And for that to take place, their hearts must change.  Even one well-known commentator mentioned that things are not changed vote by vote (in elections) but heart by heart.      Since this is so, it is unlikely that, on their own, these two nations will come together in peace.  For who among them does it seem to you is willing to change his heart?      Hannah J Paul|`|r8rykCkGaa	Never thought of that but we know Jesus will win the war of Armageddon and this will end the fight between the Jews and Muslims and all those who sided with either.

P1SdGAj3aa	When a or de precedes the definite article el, the two words combine to form a contraction. That is, two words become one.  a + el = al  de + el = del      A + el is always contracted.  Incorrect:  ?Llevas a el hermano de Ral?  Correct:  ?Llevas al hermano de Ral?      De + el is always contracted.  Incorrect:  ?El libro es de el profesor?  Correct:  ?El libro es del profesor?      De + la, de + las, de + los, a + la, a + las, and a + los are never contracted.  ?Llevas al hermano de Ral?  Are you taking Raul's brother?  No, llevo a las hermanas de Pilar.  No, I'm taking Pilar's sisters.  ?El libro es del profesor?  Is the book the profesor's?  No, el libro es de la profesora.  No, the book is the profesor's (fem).      Remember the difference between el and l. The pronoun (l) does have a written accent and means "he." The definite article (el) does not have a written accent and means "the."  el libro / the book  l come / he eats      Only the definite article (el) is contracted. The pronoun (l) is not.  La Casa Blanca es la casa del presidente.  The White House is the president's house.  Es la casa de l.  It's his house.  A l no le gusta fumar.  He doesn't like to smoke.      So if "al" is a contraction of "a el" that means it is masculine!!|`|Ax54M1Dhaa	You're right.  The only reason is if you were to break it up into 'a' and 'el' it would run together anyway.  This is not so for the feminine since there are not two similar vowel sounds in a row (a la).|`|yzFxc5uXaa	yes when you are talking about going somewhere because instead of saying  voy a el hotel you combine a and el and use al instead if its feminine it would be voy a la cocina|`|ZcLgDsOyaa	You are right.  The al comes from the combination of a and el. If you were talking about a feminine place, you would keep it a la. Ex: Voy a la playa, with no change, versus voy a el banco which becomes voy al banco.|`|AA11605393	al is masculine   a + el = al    i teach spanish  have a BA in Spanish|`|py39L7Wraa	no. only when the sentence contains 'a' before the el, then 'al' is used. for example the first sentence you used,  Voy al hotel.  is in Voy a el hotel. a + el will give you al, because a el sounds weird.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Voy al cine  Voy al teatro  Voy al despacho  Si.|`|cbZdeOSPaa	You're right!  " a la" is used for the feminine or just "a" in certain circumstances. For example, "casa" (house) is femenine and you say:    Voy ( a la) casa.    Very good, edoedo!|`|ef2911f8d21cd85ee3398706a59e0e47aa	"al" is a contraction for "a el" so it always goes with the masculine.|`|HQKuzxulaa	You are spot on.

CfcS92bGaa	Religious people should be like anyone else.  Get your Bible and start reading and not depend on others to tell you information.  We live by faith not feelings.  It saddens me to see all the kooks wanting to represent God.  God is not kooky and He has a sense of humor.  Look at you and I (smile).  Some people seem to loose their mind when they become christians, or maybe they were already like that.  I'm a christian, a wife, mother of seven children.  I believe my children are well grounded and has a better understanding what it means to be a christian.  Imagination is not what christians live their lives by.  I wish you would go to a sound Bible teaching church so that a lot of myths would be cleared up for you.  Please choose a non-denomination church for they are more likely to teach the Bible only and not man's tradition.

Just for you to know the truth  There have to be a purpose for life otherwise we will miss the peaceful path of happiness so we want to be just better everyday  So, spiritually, what is God? , Whats makes God as god? , What is Gods Power? , For all sort of these questions, I have very limited understanding so Let me give you the point. Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything and most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, what I try to say here is, from my hard study and research effort with the help from god, I realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent and existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us and we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end and also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So we cannot get anything from nothing. & how could that be possible to be perfect in perfection always, ah? No way has the perfection of god come first or the growth towards perfection. There is No End and there is No beginning and so the Ability is for the Love of Joy & ~ LOVE IS THE ABILITY ~   If you dont still agree, then note this important point: - you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is good and Almighty. Simple logical prove (the evidence) for this concept. So,   If you are humble, please... Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith and. Good in Bad & Bad in Good so the values are most important. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always & If you think, why so much trouble and pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, No pleasure and without pleasure, no pain. So without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them in our development towards the perfection of God. So-so you use pain and pleasure instead of pain and pleasure use you. I mean the vision of your future should be clear & it have to pull you rather than you have to push so you must link a lot of pleasure in order to succeed in the Best job. When you feel strong enough links a lot of pleasure in your subconscious mind and your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & It is wonderful nature for us by the true God. And we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. &  If you think, even expert can be wrong then you have to make the fine research in all most everything so It is hard and some time, it is impossible to achieve so Why we need inappropriate action to find the owner of higher power? So, because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. & All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory so closely, Have a look at this world of wonders of yours and then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice and then Having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best. And most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now & try to know where you come from to have the great gift of understanding and then, have the faith to become the best winner in your life. & The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us and God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.  Well, it is the time to make the great decision.   Good luck.   The power is focus with the great mindset   If you find this useful, please help others. Thanks.  |`|e50c8aae94677952ee9beadc76ab4c1baa	Time immemorial.  not known|`|QCejFqXgaa	    Hi  Blessings...The soul of man is man. Man is mortal. The "soul" is mortal - and subject to death........

c898150558ddb7ef0e50782e0a5d05b4aa	Looking at Revelation 1:1, we note that the Revelation is from God who gave it to Jesus. This proves that Jesus is not God. The message is delivered through an angel to John.     In Revelation 1:4 John says the message is from the Father, Jehovah, who is and who was and who is to come.     Then in verse 5, John says: "and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood."     Many translations make a distinction between Jesus and "his God" in Revelation 1:6, as, for instance, The World English Bible translation: "he made us to be a kingdom, priests to his God and Father." Thus John identifies two individuals which the messages are from, the Father, Jehovah, and Jesus, God's Son.     Then in verse 8 we find the quote: "'I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End', says the Lord God, 'the being who was and who is to come -- the Almighty."    "The Lord" in this verse is Jehovah, not Jesus, as shown from Revelation 1:4.    "Grace to you and shalom, from God" - HNV    Scripture: Isaiah 44:24    The context of Isaiah has to do with Jehovah challenging all the would-be-gods of the nations to produce the proof of their godship by demonstrating their ability to declare their purposes before witnesses and then carry out their declarations.     In the 45th chapter of Isaiah, Jehovah does that very thing by announcing approximately 200 years in advance that a man named Cyrus would conquer Babylon and liberate the Jews from captivity. That was even before Babylon ascended to world power and before Judah was conquered.     So, in that context, God is saying that none of the phony idol gods of the nations were with him in the sense that they had no share in Creation. And not coincidently, Cyrus actually typifies Christ, which is why Jehovah referred to Cyrus as his anointed one.     It should be recognized, though, that myriads of angels were with Jehovah during the creation of the universe. When recounting Creation, Jehovah revealed to Job that all of his angels shouted in applause over his work. Gods Only-begotten Son was with him too, but not as an independent rival god. Jesus role in Creation as the Logos was revealed after he came to earth as a man.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"

There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|CmHLKKODaa	I had struggled with this for several years !  I tried to put my understanding of God in a simple form that I could defend and understand.  I did not succeed !  I was confusing the simplicity of what Jesus had Accomplished with the complexity's of God as a Whole !    God is for the time being beyond our complete understanding.  There are going to be allot of things to come that we thought were impossibility's !    In my hour of need I called out and He made Himself known !  I totally accept that Jesus Is God !  The Alpha and Omega statement is hard to get around ! LOL !    As my relationship has grown toward God I have just accepted things about His nature that I just cant explain with my Limited understanding of the Universe or even Quantum Physics !  It's Obvious that such Amazing things exist !    EDIT: Don't get hung up on doctrine !  Former Jehovah's Witness|`|QnH9QuQwaa	Doesn't' Jesus also say He is the Word of God?    Doesn't the Bible also state that the Word was with God in the beginning?    I agree with you.  But just something to ponder.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	2 separate entities could not both be the first & the last.    God is ONE.  Galatians 3:20.    John 10:30 says, "I and My Father are ONE." NOT, I and My Father are one with each other.    EDIT: The right hand of God means a position of power and authority.   Mark 14:62: And Jesus said, "I am: and you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the cloud of heaven."|`|8OpFYoO4aa	Alpha and Omega:  To whom does this title properly belong?  (1) At Revelation 1:8, its owner is said to be God,  the Almighty. In verse 11 according to KJ version,  that title is applied to one whose description there  after shows him to be Jesus Christ. But scholars  recognize the reference to Alpha and Omega in  verse 11 to be spurious, and so it does not appear  in many later translations or versions like RS, NE,  JB, NAB, Dy, NASB.  (2) Many translations of Revelation into Hebrew  recognize that the one described in verse 8 is Jehovah,  and so they restore the personal name of God there.  See NWT, 1984 Reference edition.  (3) Revelation 21:6-7 indicates that Christians who are  spiritual conquerors are to be 'sons' of the one known  as the Alpha and the Omega. That is never said of the  relationship of spirit-anointed Christians to Jesus Christ.  Jesus spoke of them as his 'brothers.' (Heb.2:11; Matt  12:50; 25:40) But those 'brothers' of Jesus are referred  to as "son of God." (Gal. 3:26; 4:6)  (4) At Revelation 22:12, TEV inserts the name Jesus, so  the reference to Alpha and Omega in verse 13 is made  to appear to apply to him. But the name Jesus does not  appear there in Greek, and other translations do not include  it.  (5) At Revelation 22:13, the Alpha and Omega is also said  to be "the first and the last," which expression is applied to  Jesus at Revelation 1:17-18. Similarly, the expression   "apostle" is applied both to Jesus Christ and to certain ones  of his followers. But that does not prove that they are the  same person or are of equal rank, does it? (Heb. 3:1) So the  evidence points to the conclusion that the title "Alpha and  Omega" applies to Almighty God, the Father, not the Son.|`|47181414a475aa26d8316adbb0d510d1aa	Titles depend on context to determine the meaning.    Jesus is called first and last, because the context is talking about death and resurrection.      Jesus was the first to die with the hope of going to heaven.    Jesus is the last one resurrected solely by Jehovah,      All others will be resurrected by Jehovah's appointed judge.    the bible is clear, only Jehovah is the Alpha and Omega, the God Almighty.    When Jehovah is called 'first and last' according to the context is His being the only true God, the Almighty.    When we read that King David and King Solomon sat upon Jehovah's throne, we don't assume that they are equal to Jehovah.    The trinity is a teaching of Plato.    Jehovah and Jesus both testify that Jesus is God's Son.    Paul tells us that Jesus is the firstborn of all creation.  John tells us that Jesus is the beginning of God's creation.    John also tells us that Jesus as the Word, and prior to coming to  the earth, had the glory of an only begotten Son.    Begotten comes from the same greek word we translate into english as 'made' or 'create'  thus Jesus is the only created or created solely by Jehovah.    Read 1 John 5:10 and see how serious it is to say Jesus is God Almighty.    I hope this helps.    .|`|xo1fabj6aa	While I will freely admit to not having a complete understanding of the trinity I think it is the only way to make sense of the Bible. If you do not believe the trinity then Jesus must be the Jehovah spoken of in the OT. And the Father must have been silent throughout much of history. I think scripture only makes sense when we examine it in light of the trinity.

While we are here on earth we have no recollection of our life with Our Heavenly Father. (If we did, there would be no point in living and learning)  He gave us the Commandments to live by, and by living by them we would be happy and joy full.    We are here to learn and be fulfilling.  Then we physically die, that is where our Spirit leaves the body.  Then we go to Spiritual Paradise where we wait for the rest of the people to live out their lives.  Then we are judged to see if we were fulfilling in our physical lives, if we were then we go back to be with our Heavenly Father.|`|HsbDGCY6aa	this is one soap I would NEVER watch|`|B3jvszMaaa	Soap Operas or Post-Apocalyptic Horror flick?|`|paRGbr7Xaa	I always like to think of it like the Sims.

AA11622701	I suppose there are times when wanting women to "shut up" would be every man's "want and wish"  (LOL)    But there is one of the scriptures often misused or misunderstood.  And not always by people with a selfish or evil motive, but by honest, loving people who are sincerely trying to do the right thing to please God, but are just mistaught about the verses.    Just a couple chapters before, in 1 Corinthians 11:5, Paul says that a woman can pray or prophecy if her head is covered.  So it appears that 1 Cor 14:34-35 is not a blanket instruction that women are to never speaking in the church.  Rather in the same chapter Paul states that when the come together everyone (including the women) are permitted to give a psalms, a doctrine, a tongue, a revelation or an interpretation.  So again, his instructions in 34-35 can not be a end-of statement that women can not speak in the church.    Rather Paul list several different situations in which different people are to be silent in the church.  If they speak a different language and there is no one to interprete, they are to be silent.  If they are not the appointed speaker for the service, they are to be silent.  If they are speaker, but one of the senior elders sitting by them during their speech as a revelation, the original speaker is to be silent and let the senior elder speak.  And women are to be silent, and wait to ask any question they have until after the service.  Paul says that everyone is allowed to speak, but only at the proper time and in order.    If Paul was teaching that women can not have positions of authority within the church, why in 1 Timothy 3:11, does Paul give guidelines for choosing deaconess?  Why does he tell us that there is no male or female in Christ if they are actually different in their relationship or position with Him?    If you read the New Testament, you will find that Paul acknowledged that the seven daughters of Philip (who had started the revival in Acts 8) were prophets within the church, and allowed them to prophecy to him.  He also acknowledged but Aquila and his wife Pricilla as been apostles.  He addressed his letter to the Romans to Pheobe, who was the woman pastor of that church.    So when the entire New Testament is considered, and not just two out of context lines, there is no reason to forbid a woman from teaching (doctrine) or preaching (revelation) within the church, as long as she is not disrupting the service or out of order.  (Some rule would apply to men also.)|`|TMb076n6aa	Yes they do VERY MUCH SO!|`|gRgtp25saa	Christian men do not. Jesus said in Matthew 7:22-23 "Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity."    Claiming to be a Christian does not make one a Christian.    Edit: "so barn and 1 corinth: you then are denying that christians are a chosen generation and called to the priesthood?"     No, I'm saying that you don't know what you're talking about; you know nothing about Hebrew culture during the life of Jesus and during the life of the apostle Paul. You are an ignorant contemporary westerner and know nothing about the Bible as written and WHEN written; you've been brainwashed (trained) like a parrot repeating what you've heard without understanding; good enough?    Edit 2; "Barn: according to your philosophy then Jesus was only talking to the men, for women would not be allowed to cast out demons"     I'm assuming you mean "Bam" since there is no "Barn."    What I gave you is not philosophy, but the words of Jesus. Do you have a problem with what Jesus said Ms. Bible-answer-man?|`|q0q2Ej1Oaa	I heard 1 Timothy 2 11 say i was made from a rib.|`|i6sNYmiMaa	I think that people listen to what another man says and that is how they get their beliefs...instead of really studying the Word and praying to God to help them understand, they just take someone else's word for it. I think that if God puts it in your heart to minister His word, then you should obey Him! We are all fisherman of men...man and men being used for both genders!!!|`|vQ75GgNnaa	Correct, you can be a royal priest even if you don't wear a tunic.  But be prepared to be tested in fire after you are washed in water.  Remember John the Baptist: 'Make a straight way for the Lord.'  Meaning repent of your sins and receive the Lord in your self and be a chosen one of God.  The Church is the body of Christ and every true believer is a stone of the building everyone has a function in it we are all part of the same body that's why Jesus said this is my body, this is my blood.  When you have confessed all your sins then you can receive your first Body and Blood of Christ actually knowing what it really means.    Divider of truth: you cannot divide the Social and the Historic meaning from the Spiritual. The function of the Holy spirit is to give you knowledge and guide you in living out the Gospel.  The Gospel is the life of Christ and if you receive Him then it is your life as well. This is what it means to live a Christ like Life.|`|RyhluHk3aa	My God....... does ANYBODY rightly divide the word of truth?  First, allow me to answer the main question.  I do not know what particular men use scripture for, on an individual basis, but the scriptures that you cited were used by Paul to try to keep the gossip that women liked to do, down to a minimum.    As to what is stated in 1 Peter, Peter is NOT addressing the Body of Christ (Christians) here, but rather, is addressing ISRAEL, for it was ISRAEL that was called by God to be "an holy nation of priests", and "a royal priesthood", after the priesthood of Melchizedek. It was ALWAYS Israel that was called to a holy priesthood, to bring all other nations to God. It failed in this calling, hence the reason for God setting them aside "for a time" (see Acts 28:28).     If you need further proof of this, look at the very beginning of 1 Peter, and you will see who Peter is addressing, "Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, TO THE STRANGERS (Jews) SCATTERED THROUGHOUT Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia", just as James, in his epistle, was addressing "the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad".    If you are a Christian that reads the full word of God, then learn how to rightly divide that word, as Paul teaches in 2 Tim. 2:15. If you are not sure how to do so, it is simple. Paul addresses the Body of Christ (Christians) in his epistles. All other epistles, and books address Israel, both in the past (all books before the book of Acts), and in the future (Hebrews through Revelation).    To learn more, visit these sites that teach the word of God, rightly divided:    http://www.bereanbiblesociety.org  http://www.rightdivision.com  http://www.graceteacher.com|`|0sOnf2YQaa	I think your initial question was a good one.  Casting out demons however, is not the same thing as a woman in the pulpit as pastor preaching the Word of God to redeemed men in the assembly.  Bam's answer didn't reveal a personal philosophy; quoting those verses accurately shows that many men and women do things supposedly for the Lord yet they do not possess salvation.  Men and women are equal in the Lord, yes, still we must not ignore the very real creation order that God has, in all wisdom, put forth.  There are many Godly women that God uses powerfully to advance His Kingdom.      EDIT  There are a couple of things that need to be addressed as this question is now taking a direction that reveals quite a bit more that you did not state initially.  That letter that Paul wrote IS indeed Scripture.  "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness"  That makes it the very Word of Christ Himself.  Paul is not at all in defiance of nor at odds with Jesus Christ.    Please examine Jesus' encounter with the Samaritian woman at the well.  When she began to ask Him questions regarding living water, what was it that He said to her?    "Go, call your husband and come back."  John 4:16.    There are at least two things going on here.  Yes, we know that Jesus was bringing about from her an admission that He Himself already knew.  He was also making reference to the authority of a husband in the maritial relationship,  which not so incidentally, He created.      In your 5th edit you are using the writing of Paul as authority to correct   Divider of Truth, yet.....  In your 6th edit you are trying to diminish the authority of Paul to rebuke Bam.|`|AA11863673	Live by the words of men and die by them - nothing to do with the resurrection.    www.inteligent.co.uk/pdf/96theses.pdf|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Lots of men overlook I Timothy 5:8 & Ephesians 5:25.|`|UDXp2d8Zaa	No , most men are afraid of these verses ; 1 corinthians 14:34-35 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law.     35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.|`|2JbCMKNAaa	If they do...then they are misunderstanding of God's word.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	Some do. I've heard them. But what I think it's referring to is the women were not typically a part of the congregation along with the men. They in some cases were not allowed to be in the congregation with men. Christianity changed that. Both men and women could join in at the same service.    What I think would happen is the women were not familiar with the etiquette in a service. They had nothing holding them back from being disruptive in the service. Sometimes they would speak 'out of place', and disrupt what was going on. Paul was, in my view, trying to correct that.

When I checked in, the receptionist verified my information to make sure I am still at the same address, still have the same phone number, and still have the same insurance. Then she said the most curious thing: "Is your date of birth still XX/XX/XXXX." (She filled in the actual correct numbers, naturally.) I looked at her, and thought, "Huh? How on Earth would my date of birth change?" So, my response to her was, "No, I had my date of birth legally changed to Christmas, so I can get twice as many presents."     She looked back down at her keyboard for a moment, and then asked me to wait, and then she got on the phone and asked someone else in the office how you change a date of birth in their database. I was flabbergasted. Luckily, the receptionist sitting next to her grabbed her arm and said, "She's joking with you. You cannot legally change your date of birth."    I am guessing, since it's a busy office and you need to be on your toes, that she will not be working there long.

But, then most of the time the word came out it was from people who were 60 to 70 years old who when they were younger were taught to use this word to refer to black people. Once I realized that this is how they were taught, it did not bother me anymore. As my mom taught me, be proud of who you are. A name does not describe the person you are on the inside. A name is simply that, a name. So for me, it does not bother me anymore. I am proud of who I am. I am a Black female and very, very proud of it.|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	YES! its an ignorant word just like the N word. I would be very upset if someone called me that|`|xUxUwloPaa	Why would you call an African-American person colored? That's like calling a Mexican a burrito.|`|VWAl3tcnaa	Those terms such as "colored" seem only offensive when none African Americans uses them.|`|3cLA6wCWaa	Rent-a-cop used a terrible analogy lol    calling a Mexican a burrito would be like calling a black dude a chitlin.    Colored is just an ugly term used during an ugly time of racial history.    I wonder why they haven't changed the name of the NAACP. Hmmm|`|NBXY35zPaa	I asked a question a while back using the term "colored" referring to everyone who wasn't 'white' (Asians, Hispanics, Black, etc.) and half the people got all butt hurt and offended. Colored should not be offensive, if you find it to be then you're way too sensitive because that term is actually the most technically educated word according to Anthropology/Sociology.  It's not meant to be hurtful unless its used out of context.|`|xXxj6S6waa	LOLWUT, LOTSA DAMN COLORED ******* UP IN DA HOUSE TODAY.|`|h1HyWqqeaa	I agree w/ Bella...its not only Blacks that are colored...|`|CnzIrGp1aa	when your born your pink  when you choke you turn purple  when you get sick you turn green    but for me my friend   when I was born im black  if I choked im black  when im sick im black and you got the nerve to call me coloured?|`|DUicCMGFaa	Well in different areas of the world coloured doesn't mean black people. In South Africa & South America if you had a parent of two different races you would be considered coloured.     I think people would rather just be called by their names. but I think black sounds better than "coloured".|`|obaPQtJ9aa	We don't have to explain it. It's a white man's word for us just like the N word. We don't like it. Get over it.|`|rh8szekzaa	I'm not black but I would assume it would be offensive. I would never say that about a black person.    It's like you're implying they're the ones who are "coloured" and you are not. We have different skin colours. We are all coloured, not just black people. It's not cool to call anyone coloured.|`|BgCrYu2faa	No.    its better then being called 'black' - i have yet to see someone whos skin tone is charcoal black....i see people of all skins tones.....light browns,bieges,cream,caramel,chocolate coloured...but not black...funny tisnt it.|`|fr5ImqW9aa	The same reason white people get offended when someone calls them a cracker, honkey or whatever.|`|n1Ga3kdYaa	If you want to get technical, we're all colored. So none of it makes any sense at all.|`|92iuiuZKaa	I take it very offensive if someone calls me that!|`|DfDss68haa	I use it humorously. I would be offended if someone was using it seriously.     And it's not like horrible offensive. You can still say people of color but not colored people. It's all very confusing, just call us by our names. Thanks.

EjHUJOpEaa	First, the point of praying is not to get what you want as if God were a genie in a bottle.  Prayer is to build intimacy with God. It is to bring you closer to Him and bring you thoughts in line with His will.    Second, our ways are not His ways.  What may seem unfair or evil to us simply is that way from our perspective.  You're challenging the design of an ultimate creator.  It is like having a piec of clay argue with the potter about the pieces he removes.    Third, challenge all you want, that is your right.  No one is thrusting anything upon you.  You taking that mentality means that you don't like considering the option.  Ultimately if you don't want to believe in God you won't and that's the end of it.      As far as your views on creation, yes your parents did but if you go back far enough there has to be an ultimate creator.  A First Cause if you will.  Nothing cannot begat something.  Nowhere in nature is this found.  And yes it is a divine plan, but we do not see the whole plan for exactly that purpose.  We would lose our desire to do anything if we knew everything there is to know about life.  You don't have to agree with it for it to be true.  Many indigenous tribes donb't believe that an airplane can fly, but guess what?  It can and does.  The world didn't believe anything was smaller than the aom but guess what? we split one and found smaller things.    With this in mind and our constant state of learning and all the knowledge out there how can you say so concretely (I use the term loosely) that there can be no God?  You and I know less than 5 % of what is to know and yet you wave around this limited intelligience as if you are superior to the Creator of all things.    A fool thinks himself to be wise.|`|e058c73752697cb2225cc562af0316b3aa	you really don't understand basic concepts of planning huh?    God has it planned but we have free will to not follow along.    That's why praying and trying are needed, nothing is set in stone.|`|hQDapmICaa	So, what you are saying is, why bother doing anything, cause God knows what you are going to next?      Don't move, cause that is what God thinks that you will do next.      Please!|`|tACJnpI1aa	Doesn't make sense. That's why I can't believe it.|`|NGpztOIMaa	I might answer your question tomarrow, but rite now I'm So tired it is 2 in the morning.|`|7uVjp0QKaa	Your going to sleep or I mean going to sleep over the question is part of the divine plan.|`|AA10409657	God created man to have free will, just because he knows what you are going to do does not mean that it's what he wants you to do. And horrific acts happen because God puts his people through trials. When you go through a hardship, it makes you stronger. If you pray through that hardship and God helps you, it builds your faith.   I have also found doubt with prayer. I have seen the power of prayer in action, but when you are praying for something that doesn't fit with God's will, he won't give it to you. So how do you know what to pray for? If someone is sick, and you don't want them to die, you pray for their health. But what if it is their time to go? If you pray for them to get healthy and they die, do you lose your faith? The best I've come up with is to pray that God give you the strength to handle the trials he puts you through and for him to help you stay on the right path.    God Bless!|`|Vd0a8fb7aa	I'm honestly too tired to give a full answer to this question... but I don't think God necessarily has a devine plan so much as a devine goal. He gave us free will, and bad things happen because there is both good and evil in the world. Sometimes bad things that happen are the result of the bad in the world, even if that bad is simply bad luck that caused your car to break down in the desert and you to die of thirst. I think the point of praying is because God listens. It won't always change anything, but He listens and I feel better. Just to touch on the last, religion was not thrust upon me. I found it for myself, and I although I attend church my beliefs are not purely Christian. I have my own beliefs that came of my own experiences with God. I can understand your choice not to believe, but I can't understand your apparent yearning to thrust no religion upon others, just as you say they had religion thrust upon them. Just because you can't see what we see doesn't mean we're wrong or that you are. Just that we agree to disagree.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	"If what you are hoping for does not fall under His plan, is he going to change it just for you?".  That question is one that is asked a lot- and the answer that I have learned from personally be someone who loves to pray is this- "Praying is not to get God ready to do our will, it is getting us ready to do His".  Prayer isn't like a list that we sent to Santa Claus when we were children. That said, you should read that account of scripture in the OT where Moses continually interceded for the Israelites- God wanted to completely destroy them because of their disobedience,and Moses kept reminder God of His mercy toward His people, and God did "change his mind."  God sometimes chooses not to do something until a person prayer.  And please do not disrespect my God, by calling him the big guy upstairs. He is God and we are not, and He can whatever He chooses, and sometimes He chooses to answer our prayers the way we would like Him too, and sometimes He answers them in ways that we cannot understand at the moment, but down then road we can see why He chose to do what He did. I think it is pretty amazing that the Sovereign God who holds the world in His hands would care enough about His Children, to allow them (me) to be apart of His divine plan, by praying FOR HIS WILL TO BE DONE.|`|860c6e6cbb0a45ed8571556722c3f97aaa	God's divine plan is to save all mankind and that plan is in the form of Christ Jesus. To feed our fellow man is the responsible of man not God. The suffering we go through is from sin, the consequences of it.    Jas 1:12  Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.   Jas 1:13  Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:   Jas 1:14  But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.   Jas 1:15  Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.   Jas 1:16  Do not err, my beloved brethren.   Jas 1:17  Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.   Jas 1:18  Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.|`|5hbNtQDIaa	its all pointless. dont bother. humans made up all religions to have a meaning. even if there made up humans r just too scared to live without an anwser for everything. not all of us have to be that way tho. its a load of bull. theres no god, heaven, hell, and the bible was written by a person than re written by more ppl later on to fit in with todays society. and do bother praying ur absolutly right its a waste of time.
GqEqFSdpaa	I'm not a Scientoligist. But know more about the tech then I ever wanted to learn. Every thing I'm writting is true and what happened to me at one of there rehabs called NARCONON.    Scientology has nothing to do with Religion or Science. It is a Scam and a Cult!    It is a bunch of twisted facts and some bull crap tech on how man should live his life. Their idea of Ethics is nothing as you and I would want to follow.    They believe that any problem you have from a bad marriage to drug addiction can be cured by their tech. This includes getting a better job and coming out of a deep depression. They claim to fix it by using the same tech on everyone.    Here is a one of their dangerous beliefs:    They believe that "All illnesses to a greater or lesser degree and all fowl ups stem directly and only from what they call a PTS (Potential Trouble Source) condition." To be PTS means you are being supressed by an SP. An SP (Supressive Person). 1)So if you get sick they believe that it is caused by an SP, find out who the SP is and dissconect from that person and you will not be ill. You will not need a doctor or meds.2) Let say you work for them. You are driving one of their cars. You back up and hit something like a pole that was out of your veiwing range. This fowl up has been caused because you are PTS.Not because you just couldn't see it. Now you are put in one of their conditions. This would probably be The Condition of Treason. Treason definition: Betrayal after trust. They trusted you to drive the car and not hit a pole. You are now going to be put on an ethics cycle and relearn what you already paid for them to teach you. Manual labor and humilation. That's only part of the proccess to get back into their good graces.      Then the higher levels are right out of there founding fathers (LR Hubbard) Sci FI books. In order to learn that stuff you must pay lot of money to go through the classes to tell you this crazy secret.    Never take one of there personality test. That is how they tell you what is wrong in your life. A 200 question personality test that everyone takes. Same test for every problem. It is a money making scam that will turn you into a penniless cult member    I was scamed into one of their drug rehabs(NARCONON). They took   $ 30,000 from me and my family. They told me my family disowned me and I tried to killmy self three months later. My family loves me now and always have. Stay away from these people|`|GJdPuagzaa	YES!

hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|DOQ4bZQuaa	God came into the world through Christ. He did this out of absolute humility; to be fully human and fully God. While being human He testified to the good (because he was without sin; sin is anti-human) and was killed as a result.     Through His death He was able to take our sins upon Him so that we may be saved. He rose from the dead giving us eternal life.     So, you see that God did not really die (he did not cease to be). He always existed and always will exist as the Father (being) the Son (the logos, the word) and the Holy Spirit (love).    P.S.  Prophets bring revelation from God. Prophets do not say that they are God. If you believe that Jesus was just a "prophet" then you believe that He was a false prophet for claiming to be what He was.|`|OhhKRahTaa	Maybe because everyone dies yeah? Why should Jesus be any acception?|`|osCDXX2Jaa	Jesus is part of the Trinity which involves Him, God the Father, and God the Holy Spirit. The Father is not the Spirit, the Spirit is not the Son, and the Son is not the Father.    Jesus died to take away all our sins. Yours and mine. Past, present, and future sins.|`|9btru19waa	Hbr 1:1 Long ago God spoke many times and in many ways to our ancestors through the prophets.         Hbr 1:2 But now in these final days, he has spoken to us through his Son. God promised everything to the Son as an inheritance, and through the Son he made the universe and everything in it.         Hbr 1:3 The Son reflects God's own glory, and everything about him represents God exactly. He sustains the universe by the mighty power of his command. After he died to cleanse us from the stain of sin, he sat down in the place of honor at the right hand of the majestic God of heaven.         Hbr 1:4 This shows that God's Son is far greater than the angels, just as the name God gave him is far greater than their names.         Hbr 1:5 For God never said to any angel what he said to Jesus: "You are my Son. Today I have become your Father. [fn]" And again God said, "I will be his Father, and he will be my Son." [fn]         Hbr 1:6 And then, when he presented his honored [fn] Son to the world, God said, "Let all the angels of God worship him." [fn]         Hbr 1:7 God calls his angels "messengers swift as the wind, and servants made of flaming fire." [fn]         Hbr 1:8 But to his Son he says, "Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever. Your royal power is expressed in righteousness.         Hbr 1:9 You love what is right and hate what is wrong. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you, pouring out the oil of joy on you more than on anyone else." [fn]         Hbr 1:10 And, "Lord, in the beginning you laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.         Hbr 1:11 Even they will perish, but you remain forever. They will wear out like old clothing.         Hbr 1:12 You will roll them up like an old coat. They will fade away like old clothing. But you are always the same; you will never grow old." [fn]         Hbr 1:13 And God never said to an angel, as he did to his Son, "Sit in honor at my right hand until I humble your enemies, making them a footstool under your feet." [fn]         Hbr 1:14 But angels are only servants. They are spirits sent from God to care for those who will receive salvation.     Rom 5:6 When we were utterly helpless, Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners.         Rom 5:7 Now, no one is likely to die for a good person, though someone might be willing to die for a person who is especially good.         Rom 5:8 But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners.         Rom 5:9 And since we have been made right in God's sight by the blood of Christ, he will certainly save us from God's judgment.         Rom 5:10 For since we were restored to friendship with God by the death of his Son while we were still his enemies, we will certainly be delivered from eternal punishment by his life.         Rom 5:11 So now we can rejoice in our wonderful new relationship with God--all because of what our Lord Jesus Christ has done for us in making us friends of God.
zZxX5PXBaa	Evil is the desire to destroy, or damage; and the destruction that results. Particularly the desire to destroy other human beings, but also the desire to damage animals, anything beautiful or well-made or health-giving.    It includes physical violence, but also the emotional or psychological destruction of another human being, the desire to damage any aspect of a personality, or their functioning healthily in their family or community.    This is what lies behind a great deal of greed and ambition; it's about acquiring what others naturally need; it's as much about someone else NOT having it as it is about having it yourself. It's about acquiring the power, especially in our world the financial or political power, but it could equally be a weapon, such as a gun or car, which enables one person to damage other people without being hurt themselves.    It's a basic part of pride; pride is not simply about 'me on high', it's equally about 'you down in the mud'. You don't get pride without the desire to humiliate and degrade.    But if you want to reduce it to its simple, most visceral, most raw essence, evil is violence. There is a continuum from the immoral wars that nations wage, through mob violence and racism, to the violence a rapist commits. Whether the target is a whole country, or a race, or a religious group, or a woman or a child, it's violence. It may start in racist words, or in childish taunts against those whose beliefs are different, but it ends up in a bloody mess and in pain, grief and despair.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	At its most fundamental, evil ignores or rejects the sanctity of Life.  The most obvious evil, then, would be murder or indifference to the mortal peril of another.  But Life is much more than physical.  Evil is a negation of what I call the Life Principle.

What most people deem as evil is something that they don't see eye-to-eye with. Most everybody tries to do what they think is right, even if their definition of a perfect world is skewed, they see it as right and just.    Even Hitler, Stalin, and the KKK all thought/think that they are helping the world.    Sure they are full of hatred and the like, but they still think that they are doing "good".    If there were no human beings on Earth, I highly doubt "evil" would even exist.|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	evil is label for a human invented abstraction that is applied to various behaviors depending on cultural values|`|MUcINsQ3aa	Evil and righteousness reside in the hearts and minds of living creatures, and are not spawned by any external means.

As long as you're pleased by the outcome, it doesn't matter if anyone else has been hurt or defrauded in any way.     This is why we consider most crimes to be evil acts.  Theft deprives others of their hard-earned material possessions.  Rape causes emotional and physical pain to a woman, but the rapist does it anyway because it offers him the momentary satisfaction that he craves.  Murder obviously ends a life for the convenience of another.  Whether it exists beyond humanity's involvement is an interesting question.  I would be tempted to say no, but I have seen cats toying with mice and bugs for their own enjoyment.  I honestly don't know if evil can exist without humanity or not.|`|AjN6QGWvaa	To define evil would be making a generalization about something that could be good. In other words, it would probably best to say that evil is undefinable because of the fact that we, as humans, tend to be confused as to what evil truly is. For example, the Axis Powers considered the Big Three evil because of the fact that they posed a threat to their cause, and it's also the same way vice versa, evil could easily be define as the opposing force of good that is detrimental to good's very existence. Evil quite obviously exist, but it depends on the person. If a person's paradigm is that Homosexuals are ungodly ore unchristian, through that person they'll believe that homosexuals are evil. The determination of an act or thought being considered evil is also based on how we would see it through our beliefs, it the Quran says that Christians, even the oldest lady on her death bed, is evil because of her religion, we, as a society would define that thought as evil. The ideal that there is some similar evils between cultures is the fact that throughout human history, we as a species have found a way of saying that "we are better than he or she because of this or that" but in actuality it's the idea that a person's mistake can be deemed evil through the eyes of a person the world would see as good. Absent humanity's involvement? Definitely not, evil can be considered nature if you will, I mean if a three year old sees and Eagle eating a small, tiny mouse, the three year old will of course assume that the Eagle is mean, and evil, and vulgar for eating the innocent mouse. Without humanity's involvement evil would exist but it would just be considered...nature.|`|rh0dbQxxaa	evil is immorality the absense of good, and doin things that effects others with your own gain in mind is evil.. you should never do anything that you know will harm someone or something,, if you acknolege it and do it, thats evil,, the absence of Good, and God is evil

l3moIem5aa	I'd say trying to make Creationism sound plausible is more of an art than a science.|`|rYaqoPTHaa	The basis of intelligent design      Paraphrasing the creation story and approximate history until today  (Extremely old school style)    By David Watts 2/09    (Literal) Day 1 Genesis 1:1-5 states that God created the earth.  On this first day the earth was a void in space staring at the sun.  This was not the earth we know today.  No plants and animals, a complete barren ball of water as land had not yet been introduced.    (Literal) Day 2 Genesis 1:6-8 states that God separated the waters above and below.  A shield of ice or mist was introduced into the atmosphere.  The expanse between the waters was called sky and this was the second day.  Basically, this is when He made our atmosphere.    (Literal) Day 3 Genesis 1:9-13 states that God created land and divided it from the water.  The world looked somewhat Pangea like in form, as the continents were all together.  God than created all the plant life we see today.    (Literal) Day 4 Genesis 1:14-19 states that God created the stars in the sky and the moon and set the revolution of the earth in motion around the sun.  The Earth was not capable of sustaining life before this step.    (Literal) Day 5 Genesis 1:20-23 states that God created the creatures of the sea and the air and he blessed them.  Incidentally, this is the first blessing in the Bible.      (Literal) Day 6 Genesis 1:24-31 states that God created all the land animals and than humans and gave us humans dominion over the Earth and told us to take care of it.    (Literal) Day 7 Genesis 2:1-3 states that God rested on the seventh day and made it holy as an example for us to use one day a week as a day of rest.    There was about 2000 years between the great flood when the waters above came and flooded the land and creation.  Before the flood, people lived to be several hundred years old and the differing atmospheric conditions allowed for constant growth.  As for dinosaurs, there were never any different species than what we see today.  For example, if my dog never stopped growing over his 600-year life Im sure hed be as big as a house!  These truths have often been cast aside but never disproven.    During the flood the earth below the waters broke apart creating the continents we have today.  The flood also dramatically changed the atmosphere, as there is no longer water above the earth.  The new atmosphere accounts for the differing atmospheric changes and climate we see today as before the flood the earth would have been fairly temperate.    After the flood there was 2000 years before God came to Earth in the form of Jesus.  It has almost been 2000 years since Jesus came.  His return is foretold in Revelation and many prophesies about that return are being fulfilled now.    If you have any questions about creationism please feel free to let me know.|`|4yg7zZZ2aa	When I was a kid, in the City of Peter, there was this family of so-called Christian missionaries.     They used to give out free chocolate and books to tempt children to go to their "Sunday school."    I was a kid and I liked candy and books (especially for free!) so I went. Once.  When I went they were teaching how creationism really was science [and about that dear bloke Jebus, too].    Of course I knew that was not only ridiculous but a lie.  However I still kept the book they give me.    The name is "It's a Young World After All" by Paul D. Ackerman and I am pretty certain he and that family do think it is a "science of faith".

If the flood had not taken place, how many more millions of sinners would have roamed the earth back then, and even today?|`|uFAoq4idaa	God is perfect and his plans are perfect. He wants man to believe Him but instead man believe Satan's lies. So sorry for man. They all perished because of the flood. God started another civilization from Noah's righteous seed but Satan keep on intervening again. Because God had given him permission. He said to Eve and the devil who was also listening. Genesis 3:15 And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel. So this is a continuing activity of Satan to gather as many offspring he can have. While the offspring of the woman will be gathered through Jesus Christ because he is the would be offspring of a woman Israel. Please read Revelation 12:1-6. Satan had stricken Jesus heel on the cross and soon at the Second Coming Jesus will crush his head. This is the perfect plan of God. And sorry for those who will not believe for they are considered as the offspring of Satan. The enmity between him and the woman had already long began after the fall of Adam and Eve. All those who perished through the flood will face the final judgment and they will be thrown again into the lake of fire. No one can hinder the perfect plan of God for He had revealed this long ago for man to understand and be snatched from the fiery furnace.|`|CjRfJbncaa	The purpose of the flood was to provide foundation for faith in the soon-to-come Armageddon.  It was not intended to entirely rectify matters.  It was a foreshadow of both Armageddon, &, the last judgment at the end of the 1,000 year reign of God's heavenly kingdom.  http://watchtower.org/e/20020301/article...    It served both as a warning, &, a basis for strong faith that God will indeed bring about Armageddon, as described in the Bible book of Revelation.  http://watchtower.org/e/20051201/article...    With the Flood, God wiped off the face of the earth an entire race of Nephilim, hybrid angel-humans, who were terrorizing the earth.  God cleansed it from their extreme influence, & disabled evil spirits from materializing ever again.  This helped pave the way for building a nation dedicated to God, in which to have his son born---the Messiah to the nations.     By allowing Satan & his followers 'enough rope to hang themselves', God is establishing universal legal precedent, which will ensure that nothing like this will ever be allowed to happen again.  A parent doesn't always stop a child from making unwise decisions.  They know that more is often learned by witnessing the outcome of unwise choices, & that this usually has more influence than not allowing the choice to be carried out.  In this case, allowing Satan & his followers to play up to their last card, will leave no doubt in any reasonable mind that God is the one to follow, if one wants to attain true success in life!

Did perfection require that Adam and Eve be unable to do wrong?    The maker of a robot expects it to do exactly what he has programmed it to do. But a perfect robot would not be a perfect human. The qualities viewed as essential are not the same. Adam and Eve were humans, not robots. To humankind, God gave the ability to choose between right and wrong, between obedience and disobedience, to make moral decisions. Since this is the way humans were designed, the inability to make such decisions (and not an unwise decision) is what would have indicated imperfection.Compare Deuteronomy 30:19, 20; Joshua 24:15.    For Adam and Eve to qualify as being created perfect, must all their decisions thereafter be right?   That would be the same as saying that they had no choice. But God did not make them in such a way that their obedience would be automatic. God granted them the ability to choose, so that they could obey because they loved him. Or, if they allowed their hearts to become selfish, they would become disobedient. Which means more to youwhen someone does something for you because he is forced to do it or because he wants to?Compare Deuteronomy 11:1; 1 John 5:3.    How could such perfect humans become selfish, leading to acts of sin?   Although created perfect, their physical bodies would not continue to function perfectly if not provided with proper food. So, too, if they let the mind feed on wrong thoughts, this would cause moral deterioration, unholiness. James 1:14, 15 explains: Each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin. In the case of Eve, the wrong desires began to develop when she listened with interest to Satan, who used a serpent as his mouthpiece. Adam heeded the urging of his wife to join her in eating the forbidden fruit. Instead of rejecting the wrong thoughts, both nourished selfish desires. Acts of sin resulted.Gen. 3:1-6.

She had used "Love Me Tender" from Elvis Presley that day. Listening to Christian music is good too. I like to volunteer around town some to help the poor. There are lots of people everywhere these days that need a hopeful, helpful person -- like the rest homes to visit or do a Bible study, help with the food bank, youth shelter, church outreach efforts for the poor, working with a women's shelter, etc. Also, maybe taking a trip away for a while with your Bible and resting in God's Word in a new place for fresh insight.

UinOWcMUaa	Scripture teaches Antichrist to be a political, religious, individual, yet to come in the future (as of this writing), who is opposed to God and God's Christ and God's church. Although the only places in Scripture the name Antichrist is used are I and II John (I John 2:18,22,4:3, II John 7), the Bible is replete with instruction regarding the reality we call Antichrist. The key passages are Daniel 7, 8, 11; Matthew 24; II Thessalonians 2; and Revelation 13, 17 and 18 -- where Antichrist is referred to as a beast, a little horn, a false Christ, that wicked one, and the man of sin. ANTICHRIST'S METHODS   Antichrist goes about his business by speaking the lie. II Thessalonians 2 says that he comes "with all deceivableness of unrighteousness." Revelation 13:12 says, "and he spoke as a dragon...." Revelation 17 tells us that he was a false prophet, a prophet being one whose calling it is to speak and to teach. The armies of the world may have guns and tanks and bombs to bring people into submission; but the power of speech and ideas is a mighty power. In his initial attempts to destroy the cause of God, the devil used a serpent to deceive the woman with crooked speech: "You will be like God." Now he uses a "dragon" who speaks crafty, lying words. His speeches will be heard by millions who will hang on his persuasive rhetoric. The content as well as the form of his speech will attract. Like most false prophets, he will even be sincere and passionate. But he is a liar. He adds dashes of truth to the mix, so that his lie tastes like truth. He will use all the right catchwords, using the language of the church, even throwing in a Bible text or two. But he is the ultimate Liar, and will deceive many.     He will use every tool available: school teachers, politicians, news broadcasters, artists, musicians, scientists and doctors, lawyers and businessmen. All will be pressed into the service of Antichrist to deceive men. But especially he will use those whose calling it is to persuade and to teach -- men who claim to be preachers of the gospel of Jesus Christ.     What is this message that has such power to deceive? What is it that is preached by the now-apostate churches once rooted in true Christianity, that stirs up mankind to this ecumenical worship? What gospel will attract the hordes of men and women? What good news will knit the souls of such diverse peoples and nations and tongues?     The gospel of Antichrist is humanism -- the happiness of man, the glory of man, the peace and prosperity, the health and wealth of man. The number of the beast, do not forget, is 6-6-6, the number of man.     But we remind you, the Antichrist deceives. He will not tip his hand by declaring publicly, "I am the Antichrist." He will not claim that there is no God, no Christ, no salvation, and that the message of the Bible is a lie. But he will say, "I am your Messiah; you are God (Shirley MacLaine has comrades and consorts in the Rastifarians of Jamaica, whose word for "divine" is "I-vine"!); and an earthly life of peace and prosperity, of health and happiness -- that is salvation." The distant rumblings of Antichrist's thunder are growing louder.         You can learn all about him in the bible.. THe good news is if your already a believer in Christ you would need to worry to much about him..

Denial of Jesus as the Christ and as the Son of God of necessity embraces the denial of any or all of the Scriptural teachings concerning him: his origin, his place in Gods arrangement, his fulfillment of the prophecies in the Hebrew Scriptures as the promised Messiah, his ministry and teachings and prophecies, as well as any opposition to or efforts to replace him in his position as Gods appointed High Priest and King. This is evident from other texts, which, while not using the term antichrist, express essentially the same idea. Thus, Jesus stated: He that is not on my side is against me, and he that does not gather with me scatters. (Lu 11:23) Second John 7 shows that such ones might act as deceivers, and hence the antichrist would include those who are false Christs and false prophets, as well as those who perform powerful works in Jesus name and yet are classed by him as workers of lawlessness.Mt 24:24; 7:15, 22,?23.    In view of Jesus rule that what is done to his true followers is done to him (Mt 25:40,?45; Ac 9:5), the term must include those who persecute such ones, which means it would include the symbolic Babylon the Great and those described as the evil slave in Jesus parable.Lu 21:12; Re 17:5,?6; Mt 24:48-51.    John specifically mentions apostates as among those of the antichrist by referring to those who went out from us, abandoning the Christian congregation. (1Jo 2:18,?19) It therefore includes the man of lawlessness or son of destruction described by Paul, as well as the false teachers Peter denounces for forming destructive sects and who disown even the owner that bought them.2Th 2:3-5; 2Pe 2:1    Kingdoms, nations, and organizations are similarly shown to be part of the antichrist in the symbolic description at Revelation 17:8-15; 19:19-21.Compare Ps 2:1,?2.

Like all other religions' teachings about an afterlife, there's no evidence of any kind that it's real.  NONE.

So the essential reason is the being I worship is very real, manifests Himself in me sometimes, and I love Him.|`|UmdKqP5kaa	ISLAM ALREADY TEAMS UP WITH ALL RELIGIONS, IF ONLY YOU UNDERSTAND!  Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  I know if God turned out to be unreal, I won't lose anything, because there will be no one to judge me :)  I know if any of the prophets turned out to be right in the end, I'd win because I believe in them all :)  I know if God (most glorified) was real (and he is), and Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) existed and isn't fake (and he had), I'd win, non-Muslims won't :)  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|dFBccLExaa	Well, I don't think my religion is the only religion. I believe that all religions are possible, and upon death, we all go somewhere.   I cam to my religion when I got to college. I never felt any connection to christianity. It felt dead and cold to me. I then discovered wicca, which then moved my to the kemetic tradition. Didn't care for wicca either (too christianized for my tastes) but it was a critical stepping stone to getting where I am now.

I can not grasp as to why people call God as Father but no one have seen this father's face...and why can it be mother.  I have seen people walk on their knees in a Church center aisle, begging for a miracle yet the God they call remain callous and heartless that one almighty being, creator of all the heavens, that can hurl galaxies across the Universe but couldn't even budge an eyelash to heal a weary soul.    With all the religions of the world, and with all the pain an suffering that religious war some sort of my god is better than your god thing.  With all the unfounded belief on superstitions based on fear that logic can not reconcile to shear faith.  There were just too many whys than actual answers.  No one should questions the authority of the church...that if you say things you get excommunicated...some even charged with heresy.  Yet in history some priest are the cause of transgression and turmoil...but they still have to be called holy.    These are some of the many issues that lead me to search for the truth, though truth is relative to the believer, and answers just flow and gave me an Awareness and Consciousness that Logic can Rationalize to accept and relied on where abstract as it is, that Logic can not prove nor disapprove becomes believable and realizable faith.  A Faith in a philosophy that all can find end of suffering and that there are causes to such suffering other than others inflicting it on you.    Faith in the sense that justice will be given to those born poor, born sickly, born dead.  Justice to those born rich, born abusive, born tyrants, and are also causes of suffering.  All shall meet their equilibrium, that no one will say my god is better than your god...an that I own such and such including the church you worship on.  Power is addicting...head of religions have that power too...send the cardinal, send the bishop, the priest down to the deacons...but who talks to god the Pope?  How can it be exclusive... like he have his personal email or something and that they are buddies.  Possession is attachment, and attachment is an aggregate.     Aggregate can not exist if one is Holy.

Matthew 5:38 "You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'  39  But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person.

When it comes to dealing with unbelievers, we have these passages to guide our actions and attitudes.    1 Peter 3:15  But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect,  16  keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.    2 Timothy 2:23  Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels.  24  And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.  25  Those who oppose him he must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth,  26  and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.

Joseph sounds so much more biblical than just Joe, even though I bet Smith's family and friends called him Joe. Just like the Elizabethan English in which their stupid book is written is a lame attempt to make it sound biblical.    Mormons believe lies; blatant lies. They try to make other people believe their lies too. They are active proselytizers and if you ever encounter a Mormon, its almost guaranteed they will try to get you to join their organization and believe the lies that they believe. They claim things like, Oh, but I am a law abiding person and I have a happy life and a good family and even if my religion is based on untruths, I can live with that because I know it makes me a better person. Sure, believing nonsense can make people into decent law abiding folk who are good parents, but its such a trade off. They trade reason and accountability for delusion. They trade intellect and individuality for delusion. They trade their freakin humanity for delusion.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I'm Roman Catholic.

Now how reliable was that? If I wanted to, I could go to a number of websites that speak negatively about every religion known to man. But is that the best way to educate yourself?    If you don't wish to be a Mormon, fine. But why ridicule others who are Mormons? Does it make you feel superior to them by making fun of them? Is that what you're after?    You say: " I will share the truth as much as possible." WHAT TRUTH? I would hardly consider badmouthing others as "sharing the truth."|`|JWjlyztBaa	Not evil, just retarded.|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	I guess what Joesph Smith said is apt when he said that when you leave the church you leave neutral ground.     You can leave the church but you won't be able to leave it alone.     If you are truely 'cured' of being Mormon, I dare you to let go of your anmosity towards others of the church but I bet you cannot and that is because the evil one now has possesion of you.

AA11047076	The vast majority of Jews support Israel.  We see it as a country that will  be there for us regardless of where in the world we live.  Most Jews support the idea of a two state solution, but we insist that Israel be allowed secure borders and security, safety and peace for its residents.  As much as we would love to see peace in Israel, since many of us have family living there, we know that until terrorist groups like Hammas drop their genocidal agenda it is unlikely to happen.  Peace requires both sides to eb willing- and the Palestinian terrorists have no desire for peace.|`|wU0c3i7baa	@ Secksayy: It's true there's a distinction between Jews and Israelis, but it's not contingent upon support or opposition of Israel .You're an Israeli if you're from Israel.If you're Israeli, you're most likely Jewish.

Besides, everyone is an atheist about every god except the one they've been conditioned by culture or training to believe in. Every Christian knows the pagan gods of Rome and Greece and Scandinavia are nonsense. In fact the Romans called Christians atheists because they did not worship the gods. Every Muslim believes Yeshua (Jesus) was a prophet, but no Muslim believes that Jesus is God. They are atheists as regards the Holy Trinity. I do not believe in any of these gods, all patently mythical and invented by men. I do not positively assert that gods or a god cannot exist. I do positively assert that the gods humanity has invented do not exist. and most especially the god of desert monotheism, the one with nostrils that delight in the smell of burning entrails and who spends so much time on how they should be prepared (Exodus 12, 29, Leviticus 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9) , that one is especially ridiculous and un-god-like.|`|PKULDaC7aa	Awesome grammar.

There is no truely peaceful religion because they all think they are better in some way, except for perhaps budism wich isnt really a religion more a way of life.

WeRyMLE4aa	Tranqui con los hombres de la poca de piedra.  date cuenta de que esa forma de pensar en contra de la homosexualidad, corresponde casi siempre a gente anclada en la malisima tradicin catlica y son personas totalmente incultas, que aun no se han enterado que la homosexualidad es simplemente una variante o alternativa sexual.  Por supuesto que los homosexuales son personas ( ? que habran de ser ? ) y que tienen a nivel social las mismas obligaciones y los mismos derechos que el resto de mortales.  A veces, los " mamuts " mentales que abundan por aqu te pueden dar datos y resmenes de conferencias de cientficos ( que tambin forman parte de los " mamuts " mentales ), pero nunca leen o ponen lo que dice la mayora de la comunidad cientfica sobre el tema y que es lo dicho por ti y ahora por mi. La homosexualidad es una forma ms de vivir la sexualidad y por supuesto no son los nicos que transmiten el SIDA.  Normalmente estos " mamuts " , suele ser esa gente " buena " que pega a su mujer, que llegan borrachos a casa, que maltratan a los hijos y a los animales ,pero que son muy, pero que muy machos ante su dios y ante su iglesia.  Son una pena de criaturas.Pero que vamos hacer. No hay mas remedio que soportar sus impertinencias. Vivimos en democracia. Ellos no. Pero nosotros si.  As que tranqui. Cada vez son menos .

Mejor a disfrutar la vida sin pensar en los demas|`|2f4b8b44289523d1ae112ec942665800aa	Hola,    encontr esto para ti:    Si Dios quisiera que hubiera ciegos, sordos, lisiados, paralticos y dems, ?Jess habra hecho algn milagro para curarlos?   Obviamente, el que hayan ciegos, sordos, lisiados , paralticos y dems, NO ES LA VOLUNTAD DE DIOS. De lo contrario, Cristo habra actuado contra el querer del Padre, lo cual es ABSURDO.     Si fuera voluntad de Dios la libre ejecucin de los actos HOMOSEXUALES, la naturaleza misma - cuyas leyes fueron dadas por Dios - habra hecho sus concesiones. Pero te dars cuenta que NO LAS HIZO. La naturaleza slo admite lo masculino y lo femenino. El hecho que existan homosexuales y lesbianas, NO QUITA PARA NADA ESTE PRINCIPIO, PORQUE EN LA RELACIN HOMOSEXUAL, LOS ROLES MASCULINO Y FEMENINO SE ALTERNAN SUCESIVAMENTE , NO SE ANULAN.     El problema de la homosexualidad en un varn es que el principio femenino lo encarna una persona del mismo sexo, pero lo femenino y masculino sigue existiendo. El propio acto homosexual lo confirma. Es ms: Incluso en el momento en que t asumes el rol femeninno, TU CUERPO SIGUE TENIENDO LAS MISMAS REACCIONES FSICAS NORMALES DE UN VARN, a menos que te hayas mutilado.     Pero ah no queda el asunto. ?Te has preguntado por qu ustedes SON EL GRUPO DE MAYOR RIESGO DE CONTRAER EL SIDA?     La respuesta te la puede dar cualquier mdico. Una doctora que aqu participa puede confirmar lo que te digo: El riesgo es muchsimo mayor justamente POR EL ACTO HOMOSEXUAL PROPIAMENTE DICHO, dado que ciertas partes de nuestro cuerpo no son copuladoras sino EXCRETORAS. Las laceraciones y da?os que se originan por estos actos contranatura implican sangrado o microsangrado, segn sea el caso. La primera consecuencia es que las sustancias de desecho que deban ser naturalmente eliminadas, por causa de estas heridas vuelven al torrente sanguneo, aparte de que se genera infeccin.     Me pregunto si este tipo de da?o es propio de personas que dicen amarse. Por desgracia, esto tambin sucede entre heterosexuales, si bien con menor frecuencia. Pero el da?o es el mismo.     La segunda consecuencia es el contagio del Sida.?Por qu? Porque qued abierta una herida en esa zona. Si hay HIV, el contagio es inminente. ?Usar condn? Eso no quita para nada el da?o originado en el cuerpo de quien en esos momentos desempe?a el papel femenino o receptor . Igual queda lesionado y nada podr evitar que sus heridas abiertas tomen contacto directo con sus propias excretas.     Pero ah no queda el asunto. Me remito a lo expuesto por el Dr. Luis Espinoza, de Miami en el Congreso de Oncologa realizado aqu en Lima, en agosto del 2000. Palabras casi textuales fueron stas:   "Los homosexuales estn ms expuestos al cncer anal con mayor razn si hay HIV, por el tipo de acto antinatural que ejecutan"     La foto que ense? al pblico fue realmente impresionante. Todava la tengo en la memoria, porque la conferencia era dirigida a mdicos. Mis compa?eros y yo estbamos all porque vendamos programas contra el Cncer, pero fue casualidad que asistiramos justo a esa conferencia, que llevaba por ttulo: "Neoplasias asociadas al Sida" . Y algo que no puedo olvidar fue el rostro congestionado, mientras ense?aba esa foto. Rostro que pareca soltar una imprecacin o una maldicin, junto con una pregunta:     ? NO HAY ALGUIEN AQU QUE LE DIGA A ESTAS PERSONAS QUE HAY COSAS QUE NO SE DEBEN HACER???????????????     Si hay alguien,. Se llama Benedicto XVI. Y conste que l plantea cuestiones no mdicas, sino estrictamente de sentido comn y de Fe. Y la lgica dice que NADA QUE HAGAMOS CONTRA LA LEY DE DIOS VA A TRAERNOS ALGO BUENO. Dios no "necesita" castigar. Dios quiere que seamos felices. Si nos manda algo, no es por su capricho, sino porque de no cumplirse NOSOTROS SOMOS LOS NICOS PERJUDICADOS.     Por caridad cristiana es que tengo que hacer eco de lo que dice el Papa y detallarte estas cosas. A esta seccin ingresan mdicos y supongo que ms de uno ser onclogo, es decir, especialista en cncer. Pero si quieres documentarte ms sobre EL DA?O QUE HACE EL ACTO ANTINATURAL que tanto parece agradarte, basta que vayas al gastroenterlogo y al urlogo. Ellos pueden detallarte estas cosas mejor que yo.     www.courage-latino.org te ofrece la oportunidad de aprender a vivir la castidad. Si realmente amas, no creo que desees hacer da?o. Dadas las circunstancias, es preciso que aprendas a SUBLIMAR. Si lo deseas, Courage te ofrece tambin la posiblidad de la llamada Terapia Reparativa, es decir, el que inicies el proceso de bsqueda de las verdaderas causas que te llevaron a ser homosexual.    Por lo que he ledo, la causa primordial es la bsqueda no resuelta de la figura paterna. Como somos mayores, la libido se entremezcla y vienen los problemas.     Visita www.courage-latino.org, Y haz que otros que estn en tu situacin tambin la visiten.     ?crees que la guerra y la violencia justifican la homosexualidad?

(aclaro no solo el hombre es machista, las mujeres tambien lo son).    Las guerras tienen otros intereses y otras connotaciones,  para mi el principal causante del caos y de las guerras es el imperialismo gringo, siempre meten las narices en todo, pero no para ayudar sino para saciar sus intereses propios, es muy dificil que la guerra termine si estos sujetos siguen haciendo lo que hacen y peor aun si nosotros se lo permitimos.

He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.   Then the king will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed me, naked and you clothed me, ill and you cared for me, in prison and you visited me.' Then the righteous will answer him and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? When did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? When did we see you ill or in prison, and visit you?' And the king will say to them in reply, 'Amen, I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me.' Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you accursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, a stranger and you gave me no welcome, naked and you gave me no clothing, ill and in prison, and you did not care for me.' Then they will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or ill or in prison, and not minister to your needs?' He will answer them, 'Amen, I say to you, what you did not do for one of these least ones, you did not do for me.' And these will go off to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life."   Matthew 25:33-46    l For he will render every man according to his works . . ." (Rom. 2:6-8).   "For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified" (Rom. 2:13).   "For if we sin deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful prospect of judgments . . . (Heb. 10:26-27).   "What does it profit, my brethren, if a man says he has faith but has not works? Can his faith save him?" (Jas. 2:14).   "So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead" (Jas. 2:17).   "But some one will say, You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith apart from your works, and I by my works will show you my faith. . . .Do you want to be shown, you foolish fellow, that faith apart from works is barren? (Jas. 2:18-20).

Her aim was to give them dignity not eradicate poverty, that in her opinion was the task of politicians.    Even if she received money from shady people what do you believe she used it for ?   Rolex watches, private jet or yatchs ?    I believe the worst insult she received was being compared to princess Di.  --------------------------------------...  A tale of two funerals  by MGG Pillai    There died in the first half of this month two ladies, one known for her exemplary charitable works, the other famous because she is well-known. Both were given state funerals. It is a reflection of this age of intrusive television that the latter death, of Diana, Princess of Wales, hogged the screens, but it is the former, Mother Teresa, who would live on in history.    The state funerals that India and Britain gave to Mother Teresa and Diana respectively underlines in one slick clip the contrast between the genuinely historical figure of the "Saint of the Gutters" and the media-created, spoilt young woman caught up in the ersatz glitz of the "frenzy of renown" and wellknown because she was a wellknown figure artificially created by the media and its hangers on.     What brought this about is the gradual dominance of the graphical revolution in our lives, with modern advances in computer technology enabled instant, often, intrusive coverage that made wellknown the frippery. Conspiciousness passed for distinction and the society columns the roll of fame, as Edith Wharton notes in one of her novels written at the turn of the century.     Mother Teresa, on the other hand, sacrificed her life to the wretched of the hovels of Calcutta, bringing an enduring fame not easily captured on camera. So, the ersatz outpouring of grief seen in the Diana funeral was noticeably absent. The restraint in television coveraged added to the dignity of the occasion, and she joined the Gods in a ceremony that rested well on her; as Diana's did on hers.     Mother Teresa's good works could not be captured on the television screens without making people puke at the utter helplessness she faced every day. Television, after all, is a medium to make people comfortable, not to make them vomit over the dining table. So, that was reserved for the occasional special programmes that came to tell the world who it was honouring, whether it be the Nobel Prize or her death.     The press was irrelevant in Mother Teresa's cause, and the raison d'etre for Diana's fame. The press -- the papparazzi, if you will -- was the drug on which fameoholics like Diana, Princess of Wales, could not live without. The emptiness of the life that lurked beneath was accentuated by the high profile existence she led. And not she alone.    The graphical revolution, which changed for ever the structure of the media, ensured that there would be an insatiable apetite for media-created figures. That brings about the free-lance photographers and the court reporters doing anything possible to bring about the most irrelevant bit of news, coupled with a heavy dose of believable lies, to ensure that the person is intoxicated by it -- and like most drunk persons, turning on the drug dealers, occasionally.    Diana's death could not be blamed on the papparazzi alone. It is the graphical culture that pervades and emphasises the inconsequential and the irrelevant to sell newspapers and television programmes that made what happened happen. The papparazzi is one of a long chain of parasitical figures in the rush to be suckered in by the "frenzy of renown" as she was. That the only voice for hours that CNN could bring out to criticize the papparazzi was that of Tom Cruise, the actor, makes this point even more dramatic.     Mother Teresa's funeral attracted several presidents and kings; that of Diana's, only those monarchs who would normally attend, and those known to her personally. Mother Teresa's work goes on, even if she attracted criticism, as anyone who does anything selflessly would eventually. Diana's would fit in comfortably with the Andy Warholean dictum that everyone is entitled to 15 minutes of fame. Mother Teresa would not. And that would be how history would judge the the subjects in this tale of two funerals.|`|f00589104255977086e57a356d925224aa	What I know of her, she was a good women, helping other.

30973ca04342c6b1b6ba21a7cd9b39e7aa	Refer to notes at end if you don't understand some words.    The following is a hadith:    Hudhaifah bin Al-Yaman reported that the Messenger of Allah sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam said,    "Prophethood (meaning himself) will remain with you for as long as Allah wills it to remain, then Allah will raise it up wherever he wills to raise it up. Afterwards, there will be a Caliphate that follows the guidance of Prophethood remaining with you for as long as Allah wills it to remain. Then, He will raise it up whenever He wills to raise it up. Afterwards, there will be a reign of violently oppressive [The reign of Muslim kings who are partially unjust] rule and it will remain with you for as long as Allah wills it to remain. Then, there will be a reign of tyrannical rule and it will remain for as long as Allah wills it to remain. Then, Allah will raise it up whenever He wills to raise it up. Then, there will be a Caliphate that follows the guidance of Prophethood."    Then Hudhaifah said, "The Prophet stopped speaking." [As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, vol. 1, no. 5]    Scholars of hadith explain that the prophethood mentioned here is that of Muhammad (saw) and that what came next after that were the khulafaah (plural of khalifah which is the arabic for caliph) that followed the guidance of Muhammad (saw). Meaning they were on the right guidance and their rule was just and true (a right from Allah). Scholars explain that this refers to the rule of the four first khulafaah (Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Ali- may Allah be pleased with them) about whom Muhammad (saw) said in another narration were the rightly-guided khulafaah. He (saw0 also said, "The Caliphate will remain in my nation after me for thirty years. Then, it will be a monarchy after that." [Ahmad, Tirmidhi and others, Sahih Al-Jami` ' As-Saghir no. 3341]    The next stage is explained in the parentheses (by scholars)- that there were Muslim kings after the first four khulafaah who were not khalifahs- but kings (kings meaning monarchy) who were partially unjust. Scholars have excluded several who were among these kings- because of their rulership being akin to that of the first four who were rightly-guided and because they were from the lineage of the Quraysh, the tribe from which Muhammad belonged to.    Scholars consider the third stage to be of that after the Ottoman Empire (whose kings/sultans were considered the last), after whom were tyrannical leaders put in place by the colonizers and the Chrisitan or non-Muslim nations. This is the worst of times when fitnah (temptations, falsehood, evil, oppression , etc.) are near their highest.    Finally, the Mahdi (this is a title given to the khalifah who will be from the first in the return of a Caliphate that rules following the guidance of the Prophet (saw)), an ordinary man, born to an ordinary women raised by ordinary men and living an ordinary life with the people of his time. "In reality, Al-Mahdi will be an Imam and a Caliph, among other Caliphs who rule Muslims with justice. However, what differentiates Al-Mahdi from other Caliphs is that he will meet Jesus son of Mary sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam." (excerpt taken from article).    "Also, Jesus, the Prophet of Allah, will pray behind Al-Mahdi. Allah will give Al-Mahdi the ability to righteously rule the Muslim nation in the span of a night. He will fill the earth with justice, as it was filled with injustice. He will lead the Muslim nation to the second conquering of Constantinople and possibly Rome." (another excerpt taken from article).    "The Muslim should not wait for the emergence of the Mahdi, rather he has to strive hard and devote his efforts to support Islam, and to do whatever he can for the religion. He should not hope and wait for the emergence of the Mahdi or anyone else, rather he should correct himself, his family and the people around him, so that when he meets Allaah he meets Him having done his best." (excerpt taken from islamqa.com) The Muslim should work hard to propogate the message of Islam and practice it within his own life. Learning Islam, practicing it, calling others to Islam, and remaining patient (with whatever harm comes or in being consistent) is obligatory on the muslims. To be lazy and wait for the mahdi is not correct.    If you interested in more information, see sources below (they are very reliable because the information produced from them rely on ahadith and the qur'an, as well as muslim scholars who adhere to these two sources and use them to explain different matters).        My notes for non-muslim readers.    1.The word Messenger refers to Muhammad PBUH (PBUH stands for 'Peace Be Upon Him').  2. "sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam" is PBUH in arabic and is somtimes summarized as "(saw)".  3. Hadith record the narrations, sayings, or actions of Muhammad PBUH).  4. Hudhaifah was a companion of the prophet (his companions would hear him say something or see him doing something and make a mention of it- these narrations are hadith)  5. After the ahadith (plural of hadith), there are names and numbers. These are citations for the hadith. The names are names of books/scholars.|`|AA11800924	there were 4 Caliphates: Abu Bakr, Omar, Othman and Ali.  The fifth would be "Al-Mahdi" which means "the guided one" beause according to the prophecy, he would be a muslim, but not committed to his religion, then in his 40s, He would commit and become faithful to his religion.    There are several characteristics, his name would be "Muhammad Abdullah", if you would like to know more, try google on "al-Mahdi"|`|5e681d260650ad53a296c57b5ef169fdaa	yes,ther is a final caliphate in islam...according to holy koran,the final caliphate belongs to weak people...whom are annoyed...and the leader of world would be imam mahdi (peace be upon him) whom is alive but hidden...he will come and save human beings and vanish cruels and will do the real orders of god...|`|AA11684190	The final Calipha was Ali bin Abi Talib.    Ali is cousin of Mohammed (pbuh) and his son-in-law.  He is the first Imam, his son, Husain (who had Mohammed for a grandfather) is the 2nd and so on.  Al-Mahdi is not a Calipha, is the 12th Imam in the dynasty of Ali.  Imam is not a ruling position in the nation, it is a religious one, a man of religion.  Al-Mahdi will come when the end is near, as a sign of Judgment Day.  Its like when Jesus (pbuh) comes back and kill the anti Christ. Jesus will live for seven years.  So U C that THE END does not take one day.

I was a stupid thirteen year old when I started, and NO ONE put a gun to my head to make me smoke.    I wish to God I'd never started, and I pray even harder that I can someday kick the habit.  But, don't stand out there acting all smug and tell me to "just quit!"  Smoking is a physical & mental addiction, and it is very strong.      Don't gripe at me if you cannot give me a viable solution.  Show me something that works 100%, and I'll listen with both lungs open.
8583a592d8d297ab5bb092808dc83dafaa	How do people not see a problem? Because there isn't one. The problem is not of God changing his mind but man changing his own mind.    God is a god of justice, and for at least 100 years before the flood, man was at his absolute worst. God does not delight in killing, but at a certain point, even God must step in and discipline the people.    The only acceptable punishment for sin is death. God gave them 100 years to change, yet only 1 man listened; how patient would you be?    Think to the story of Sodom. God said that he would not destroy the city if there were even 10 good people in it. Counting Lot and his family, there were 7, had there even been 3 more, the whole city could have been saved, but instead, God had to punish them for their obvious sinful behaviour. In this case, God saved the righteous just as he did in the flood. Not that these people were perfect, but they at least tried to be faithful to him.    God never spoke out against stoning, the punishment, that I am aware of, but he did on many occaision point out that if people wanted to stone someone else, they should think to their own sins, and consider the fact that should they stone someone, they in fact are probably already deserving of the same punishment, and thus instead of acting out in hate, love one another instead.|`|b027b1fbbb8d38136719855b73cea566aa	I too am atheist, when I told my mother she said, "Do you think you know everything there is to know?

It shouldn`t be so hard for you, especially considering you speak English, most Croatians speak it too (apart from the 50+ generation).  My advice is: don`t judge him by the stereotype, but by who he is.    Hope this helps:)|`|323e545d3a114a67b6e216237d2cf0e2aa	It will really depend on his upbringing and how independent he is from his family's/community's influence.  Keep in mind, there are many Croatian guys who don't care about that, or whose family doesn't prescribe to that mentality.    However, most often the family and the guy, if he agrees, would prefer to have a Croatian girl and if not, at least one that is Catholic.  Take it slow.  No harm in dating.  If he introduces you to his parents, etc.  You can get a read on how he views you.      Croatian guys tend to have a bit of a player in them - they are flirty, but not always cheaters.  If you are a stong woman and can spell out your expectations, I think you will be ok.  Who wants to have a puppy dog anyway.    Good luck!|`|N3wY2l5Yaa	If he looks anything like the Croatian dude that played on the show "ER" (Luca, if that is spelled right) then I say go for it!  But his family will want any kids you have to be raised Catholic only. Good luck. Hope you make the right choice.

Renunciaremos  cincia porque existem ignorantes? E haver que abandonar a religi?o porque certas pessoas entendem-na mal e mal a praticam?  Saber a verdade, Querer o bem, Amar o belo e Fazer o que  Justo. Porque a verdade, o bem, o belo e o justo s?o inseparveis.  Quanto  religi?o, n?o h mais que uma. E n?o tem havido nunca, sen?o uma verdadeira.  a esta que chamo verdadeiramente de Catlica ou universal. Um mu?ulmano pode pratic-la como o tem demonstrado muito bem o emir Abd-el-Kader, quando salvou os Crist?os de Damasco. Esta religi?o  a Caridade; o smbolo da caridade  a Comunh?o; e o oposto da comunh?o  excomunh?o; comungar  evocar a Deus, excomungar  evocar ao diabo.  Fazer bem  triunfar; e, aquele que n?o triunfa,  mais ou menos responsvel por sua torpeza. As coisas, na realidade, est?o de tal forma ordenadas pela Sabedoria Suprema que o mal n?o poderia ter um xito real e durvel, e que o bem, apesar de todas as demoras e de todos os obstculos, chega sempre a seu fim. Falas do mal que se produziu a propsito do Cristianismo. Este mal passou em parte, e o que dele resta, passar. Porm, o bem ficou e ficar. N?o  em nome de Torquemada, e sim em nome de Vicente de Paula que as irm?s de Caridade cuidam dos pobres rf?os. Alexandre VI n?o publicou jamais uma constitui??o apostlica justificando o envenenamento e o incesto. A religi?o  santa, os homens  que s?o maus.  que esse absurdo  a fonte infinita da raz?o, a luz brota eternamente das trevas eternas, a cincia, essa Babel do esprito, pode torcer e sobrepor suas espirais subindo sempre; ela poder fazer oscilar a Terra, nunca tocar o cus.   Buscando a Deus no absurdo encontra-se ao diabo; porm, procurando ao diabo n?o se encontra a raz?o. Analisai a Deus e ao diabo do vulgo; encontrareis no Deus o ideal poetizado do diabo e no diabo a caricatura de Deus".

Nada jamais acontecer em desarmonia com as leis naturais. Esta prova, achava Hume,  t?o ntegra como qualquer argumento baseado em experincia contra a possibilidade de haver milagres;  Stephen W. Hawking, professor de matemtica na Universidade de Cambridge, ao considerar como o universo come?ou, disse: Na teoria clssica da relatividade geral .?.?. o come?o do universo tem de ser uma singularidade de infinita densidade e de curvatura espa?o-tempo. Em tais condi??es, todas as conhecidas leis da fsica entrariam em colapso. De modo que os cientistas hodiernos n?o concordam que, por algo ser contrrio s leis normais da natureza, nunca possa acontecer. Em condi??es incomuns, coisas incomuns podem acontecer.

Bom, estou disposto a lhe ajudar no que for possvel, mas preciso corrigir algumas coisas faladas aqui:    Vamos come?ar pelo nosso amigo:     - Geogrfo, a resposta  N?o, n?o doaremos sangue ao seu ``amigo. Quer saber por que? Leia: Atos 15:29.     - Perola, em nenhum desses textos foi falado que Jesus  Deus. Preste mais aten??o:      ``FP 2:6 Que, sendo em forma de Deus, n?o teve por usurpa??o ser igual a Deus,  7 Mas esvaziou-se a si mesmo, tomando a forma de servo, fazendo-se semelhante aos homens;  8 E, achado na forma de homem, humilhou-se a si mesmo, sendo obediente at  morte, e morte de cruz.    Nesse texto, o que se quiz dizer com sendo em forma de Deus,  que ele era poderoso, e poderia ser fcilmente chamado de Deus, porm veja o que diz logo em seguida, ``n?o teve por usurpa??o ser igual a Deus... isso quer dizer que ele n?o quiz se passar por Deus.  E o resto dos textos sitados tambm n?o d?o fundamento ao que vc disse (com todo respeito por vc).  uma simples quest?o de enterpreta??o de texto, se vc perguntar a qualquer professor, lhe dir a mesma coisa.     - Ktia F, n?o poderei te explicar o porque foi dito que ocorreria o ``fim do mundo nessas datas devido a grandeza que ficaria o texto se eu o colocasse aqui, mas se tiver alguma dvida me envie um email.     Apropsito: Seita  uma sociedade secreta onde os cultos s?o fechados, e apenas alguns s?o convidados.   As TJ tem suas reuni?es abertas a todos... n?o s?o secretas. Por tanto, n?o precisa mais nos chamar de seita.  Aprenda a n?o repetir tudo o que dizem. Pois seita n?o te nada a ver conosco.    - ``Eu, ns n?o contamos horas atravz desse mtodo simplesmente pq n?o  aconselhvel. Nossa nica inten??o aqui  ajudar a quem quizer a saber a verdade. Jamais usariamos isso apenas para ``contar milhos para nosso prprio benefcio.    - Fabio J, eu posso lhe explicar perfeitamente o porque ocorreram mudan?as em nossas cren?as ao longo desses anos, mas ds de j lhe adianto que seguimos a Bblia, e Jeov  o Deus do qual fala conosco atravz dela, mas n?o aqui pois ficaria um texto um tanto grande. Se realmente desejar saber o porque, mande-me um email.       - A todos vcs, quem tiver alguma dvida ou quiser que expliquemos o motivo de algumas de nossas a??es, pode falar e responderei com prazer.    Boa tarde a todos, e a vc tambm irm?o, seja bem vindo.  Mas cuidado com os apstatas e Cia.... te aconselho a n?o ficar entrando em conflitos, pois pode lhe ser prejudicial.  ======================================...    Muito Obrigado A.P, voc  a minha fonte de inspira??o. Quando cheguei nesse site e vi o como vc defende a verdade, me senti ridculo.

This magnifcient universe isn't running / working at its own, there has to be some one supreme being / power managing all this.    Thanks  :)|`|g7RnYMoNaa	From Psalm 19  A psalm of David.      1 The heavens declare the glory of God;          the skies proclaim the work of his hands.    2 Day after day they pour forth speech;          night after night they display knowledge.      3 There is no speech or language          where their voice is not heard. [a]      4 Their voice [b] goes out into all the earth,          their words to the ends of the world.          In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun,      5 which is like a bridegroom coming forth from his pavilion,          like a champion rejoicing to run his course.      6 It rises at one end of the heavens          and makes its circuit to the other;          nothing is hidden from its heat.      7 The law of the LORD is perfect,          reviving the soul.          The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy,          making wise the simple.      8 The precepts of the LORD are right,          giving joy to the heart.          The commands of the LORD are radiant,          giving light to the eyes.      9 The fear of the LORD is pure,          enduring forever.          The ordinances of the LORD are sure          and altogether righteous.      10 They are more precious than gold,          than much pure gold;          they are sweeter than honey,          than honey from the comb.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	Here's my top ten proofs that god exists:     10). .......  ..  .

The concept of a god is not (at least at this point) provable, falsifiable, testable, or grounded in any objective reality. It's unsubstantiated, and unkowable.|`|11b70cab8a6a69fef89e99846ac0cc19aa	I'm not 100% sure if God exists or not. In fact, no one can answer that with absolute certainty.    But as there is a choice, I like to believe that God exists. I believe God is an actual entity, but He is also the source of good and nobility.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	I do believe He's an actual person.  I've never understood the whole "God is an unknowable force floating through the universe" bit, because if He were, why would we think He cares about us?  Moses once chastised his people for worshiping and praying to idols, saying that an idol isn't capable of love and wouldn't bother to help us even if it could.  If God were this vague force, why would He be any different?  God is, instead, our creator and our spiritual father, and of course He loves us.    So how do I know He exists?  Simple: I asked.  I've always known and believed in God, because I've always seen His hand in my life.  There have been too many miracles for doubt.  Still, I once decided to actually make certain that God was there and knew me as His child.  I got down on my knees and began to pray, and since I truly wanted it, an answer wasn't long in coming.  I suddenly felt such an overwhelming sense of being loved, and since I'm just not capable of that much love, I knew it didn't come from me.  The answer was unmistakable and life-changing.  No matter what happens in my life, I'll never be able to doubt God's love for me, and of course this means that I'll never be able to doubt His existence.  God is there.  He is real, and He loves us.  He's not just some symbol, and He is definitely a person who watches over us.  I have no doubt at all of that.|`|d8zxbKduaa	God is spirit but can take on physical attributes/form e.g. Jesus Christ. His character is love and compassion and mercy and He's holy. Creation (nature) is proof of His existence.     Hebrews 3:4  For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.    I encourage you to seek Him.|`|Vd0a8fb7aa	It's hard to say how I know. One day I just knew. My seven year old cousin had just died and I had always gone to church and all that fun stuff but I don't think I "believed"... I was young, 18 I think, and you know how that is. I was selfish and I didn't spend any time with her. The last time I had seen her I had yelled at her and told her I didn't want to see her anymore because she was an unappreciative brat. I didn't see or talk to her for about 8 months because of some varying circumstances, but not because I had meant what I said. She died suddenly, she had an aneurysm and I never got to say bye to her. I know what you're thinking, why would this make you believe in God? Wouldn't that make you not believe? How could God do that to a 7 year old?    5 days before she died I went to my Mom's house. My Mom wasn't there, just my Dad, and we didn't get along very well without a mediator present, so usually I would have left without even going inside. But on this day, I didn't know why, but I went inside. My Dad and I talked for 3 hours. We actually had a real conversation for the first time since I was 15 and he found out I was dating a black guy. Not only did my relationship with him strengthen, but right before I left, my cousin called. 5 days before she died, she called my Mom's house and got me. I talked to her, told her I was sorry for the last time I talked to her. She said she understood. What 7 year old says that? She said she was sorry she was mean, and wanted to see how I was. I told her I loved her and promised her that a week from that day I would take her to see my new apartment. She told me that she would always love me and to never feel bad that I called her a brat, because she was one.     How could I have lived with myself if I hadn't had that conversation with her? That's why I know there's a God. He didn't prevent it from happening, that's just not what He does. But He gave me that conversation. Just like He strengthened my relationship with my Dad that day. Because of that, my Dad walked me down the aisle to marry my black husband- the same guy I had been dating when I was 15. My Daddy died this year and it makes me think even more about that day when I sat and talked to him and to Sierra. I think God was very present that day, making sure that I didn't regret my last days or even years with the people I loved. And when my Dad died, we had an excellent relationship. God takes away but He gives you the opportunity to appreciate and make things right.    So I doubt that will make any non-believers believe in God, and I'm sure a lot of people will read it and laugh. I've never posted that story on the answers and I've only told it once, at church before I was baptized. I hope it helps.|`|UmdKqP5kaa	Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  I know if God turned out to be unreal, I won't lose anything, because there will be no one to judge me :)  I know if any of the prophets turned out to be right in the end, I'd win because I believe in them all :)  I know if God (most glorified) was real (and he is), and Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) existed and isn't fake (and he had), I'd win, non-Muslims won't :)  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|MttoGF3Aaa	No one can 'know' that God exists.

Good things and bad things happen all the time, no matter where the planets are in their orbits, or what stars are visible in our sky at night.  Astrology is absolute, complete nonsense.

King Charles II (My favorite English Monarch) ruled during this time period. In the year 1649, King Charles I was executed, allowing an 11 year period called the Proctorate to follow. After the strict Puritan rule of Oliver Cromwell, and his son Richard, in which holidays such as Christmas canceled, the English people were glad to welcome back in a Stuart Court. On May 29th 1660, King Charles II was welcomed back to England. His rule, which lasted until 1685 was marked by a new interest in the arts. Many actresses, such as the famous Nell Gwynne (who was also the King's mistress) preformed in the theatre. This period was also marked by disaster, such as the Great Fire of London and an outbreak of the Plague. All in all though the Restoration period was marked by change in England, and its people were much happier than in the Procterate. In 1685, King Charles had a minor stroke while shaving. He died a few days later after the royal doctors treated him. (Today it would have been considered torture) He had no legitimate children by his wife Cathrine of Braganza, but had at least 10 by his mistresses. He was ssucceededby his brother James duke of York, who had to deal with rebellions from King Charles II's son, and his own child Mary and her husband William of Orange. He was forced to leave for France and was ssucceededby William and Mary.|`|T0xLpygfaa	the restoration of charles the second brought in a new hope that royalty would behave itself and serve the people instead of itself.    unfortunately these hopes were dashed. charles was a womanising and diffident monarch at best. the monarchs who followed charles were terrible, from james the second right thru the Hanoverian kings of the 18th century. respite from them came with victoria in the early 19th century

For some it's about worship. It can be about explaining the unknown. It's about power and money. It's about domination and it's about servitude.    Religion creates its own "truth" and makes it's own rules. Religion can be whatever you want it to be. That's how it's different than science. Science has to justify itself and it's forever subject to scrutiny. Religion has no such disadvantages.|`|T6n63ucqaa	F. Forrester Church said:   "Religion is the human response to being alive and having to die."  I would add to that (my personal view), that it was also a design of man in search of understanding or to fulfill the spirituality found in the universe, nature, mankind, in other words, the spiritual side of the scientific nature.    Historically, or as far as we know, Sumerians were the first to have "organized" religion. It would be useful if you did some research on them and the origin of their worship to what they called "the winged gods".    From then on, humans have created hundreds of religions, and variations of the same.    My personal opinion is that any belief system (faith based) should be looked into thoroughly, its history and doctrinal evolution over the course of time.|`|51afd07cd1a5581a02fcc12f3470d7ddaa	Brain washing and ignorance|`|d42449497807d301bb4d95ff401cf878aa	They want to believe and belong.

However , in John 3:3 Jesus said ' I assure you,unless you are born again,you will not see the Kingdom of Heaven'    He DIDN'T  say  'unless you are catholic,muslim,hindu..etc..etc..

It effects me so deeply because I know that Jesus came to this earth and died for my sins and then rose three days later.  I know he did this so I can have eternal life.  Thank you Jesus!|`|qtgDx6Wdaa	It's like politics.  When one believes something to be true, they defend it with their whole heart.  From a personal standpoint, the Lord Jesus Christ affects me so deeply and causes me to defend Him just as Atheists defend their belief in evolution, the big bang, etc.  We just want people to know our truths.  We believe that everyone deserves to know the truth (different truths for different people).  It is human nature to want to be right.  When we are told something and believe it to be true when others tell us that it is false, we become defensive.  Again weather it is true or false, we will defend it because we believe it.
AA10170818	Pulled right out of good ol' Wikipedia    -----------------------------    When Joseph Smith was asked about the basic beliefs of Mormonism, he summarized the teachings and doctrines in 13 points, which are today known as The Articles of Faith of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.    The Articles of Faith read as follows:    1. We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.    2. We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adams transgression.    3. We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.    4. We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.    5. We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.    6. We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth.    7. We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, and so forth.    8. We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.    9. We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.    10. We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon this the American continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.    11. We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.    12.We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.    13. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of PaulWe believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.    Additional details regarding basic beliefs of Mormons can be found on the LDS Church's official website: http://www.lds.org|`|e1b66078c7b461b89eff98c5ea27a4e9aa	They r creepy!|`|AA10809640	Yes, the Church of Mormon is quite different from Christians and Catholics (which are also different from each other).    Mormons believe that God was once a human, like we are now, who ascended into God-Hood.    They believe that with good deeds they too will ascend into God-Hood and receive their own little world to govern as God.    There are many other differences, such as Jesus and Lucifer being brothers (but not just the only two children of God....just two of many children of God).    I could go on and on and on.   Steer clear.|`|0d3b639ed877ac219218ac3814b29996aa	They believe the Christian and catholic are full of crap..|`|AA11145587	Well, the mormon religion started when a man had a little spirit visit him and told him where to go to find some gold plates (buried) and he got a crystal ball...that is where that comes from. They believe in plural marriages (although most don't practice it anymore) and the more wives they have, the higher they get in heaven. They also believe in blood atonement, which means that you can kill someone else for a sin they've done. They believe that Joseph Smith (the founder) is equal to Jesus Christ.   I don't want to trash others' religion, to each his own, but you have to form your own opinion.|`|AA11647043	You might want to try http://www.mormonbeliefs.com.      FYI.......A Catholic is a Christian because we believe in Jesus Christ. We aren't separate from the Christian faith.|`|AA12240727	Let's begin with the simple fact that LDS as they should be known ARE Christians as are Catholics and Orthodox.  The Christians as you call them are properly titled PROTESTANTS.  Join with me now as we look at the 15 and 16 century and learn all about this little thing called the Reformation ...    While I am a pagan, and therefore pretty much assured of roasting wienies and marshmallows with such luminaries as Oscar Wilde, Lord Byron and Ghandi, the only Christian church I truly respect at this point is the Church of LDS (sorry not typing it all guys)    They, in my simple opinion, are:  More forgiving of others  Believe you can go to heaven if you are not christian but have not been exposed to it.  So guess what, Dante, first circle of poets and prophets - EMPTY.  They take care of and police their own communities.  I don't see a lot of bishops being moved about different areas after diddling little boys.  They stop it.  They accept there are way more people on this planet than say - the 1 billion 'Christians' out there.    While I just can't sign up to a church that has a patron angel named Moron-i.  I truly do respect what they do, who they are and what they believed.    And if they want to be polygamists - more power to em.  Hell, women who live together cycle together.  More than one case of rampant pms?  EEEK!  But I'm up for polyandry - I want 3.  1 hubby to cook, 1 to do car maintenance and the 3rd for lawn care

V6qQlCbdaa	Evolution was mentioned in Quran many times in different forms.  -Quran states that human was created from water,dust,and clay in different parts of the book.It's not a contradiction,since water+dust=clay.Water consists about 70% of human body and it's known that human body contain trace elements just like the soil.  -Quran also states that human was created from clay in a (solala) which means (strain) and can be understood as something coming after somethhing like in a chain.This means that human was not created in the form we know today but he did undergo evolution.  If you want to understand the meaning of evolution,just look at the human embryo development stages.  The embryo begins with a one cell (zygote) attached to the uterus like a microbe,then it starts mitotic division into 2,4,8,16,...cells.The cells fuse to form a two-layered tissue composed of endoderm and ectoderm(like primitive hydras).Later,a third layer (mesoderm) is formed (like in worms).The endoderm later develops into viscera,glands,liver and pancreas.The ectoderm develops into skin,nerves,brain,eyes,ears,hair and nails.The mesoderm develops into muscles,heart,veins,arteries and bones.  At some stage of the embryo development,it looks like a small fish with gills.At another stage it grows a tail which later is gone.At a third stage,its body is covered by hair like a monkey then the hair is gone except at the head.|`|b899f0b6770dbd6aa7b45bd5f80c3577aa	If you want it to be there, it will be there.

Ah. J sei: ele ama toda a gente. Ora, ainda bem. Ent?o, se  sabido que Jesus ama toda a gente, n?o  preciso andar a encher o saco ssempre com a mesma cantiga. Toda a gente sabe que Jesus ama toda a gente, est o assunto arrumado. Imagine que voc estava debaixo de um baita tor, como vcs. dizem, e a cada passo algum dizia "est a chover". Voc n?o ficava irritado por toda a gente estar a dizer a voc aquilo que voc sabia e sentia?  Eu chamo a isso fanatismo, falta de sensibilidade, limita??o intelectual, idiotice.

041e6252efb55962f9628b5aef9cc230aa	 Perda de Pessoas Amadas. Mortes Prematuras    21. Quando a morte ceifa nas vossas famlias, arrebatando, sem restri??es, os mais mo?os antes dos velhos, costumais dizer: Deus n?o  justo, pois sacrifica um que est forte e tem grande futuro e conserva os que j viveram longos anos cheios de decep??es; pois leva os que s?o teis e deixa os que para nada mais servem; pois despeda?a o cora??o de uma m?e, privando-a da inocente criatura que era toda a sua alegria.    Humanos,  nesse ponto que precisais elevar-vos acima do terra-a-terra da vida, para compreenderdes que o bem, muitas vezes, est onde julgais ver o mal, a sbia previdncia onde pensais divisar a cega fatalidade do destino. Por que haveis de avaliar a justi?a divina pela vossa? Podeis supor que o Senhor dos mundos se aplique, por mero capricho, a vos infligir penas cruis? Nada se faz sem um fim inteligente e, seja o que for que aconte?a, tudo tem a sua raz?o de ser. Se perscrutsseis melhor todas as dores que vos advm, nelas encontrareis sempre a raz?o divina, raz?o regeneradora, e os vossos miserveis interesses se tornariam de t?o secundria considera??o, que os atirareis para o ltimo plano.    Crede-me, a morte  prefervel, numa encarna??o de vinte anos, a esses vergonhosos desregramentos que pungem famlias respeitveis, dilaceram cora??es de m?es e fazem que antes do tempo embranque?am os cabelos dos pais. Freqentemente, a morte prematura  um grande benefcio que Deus concede quele que se vai e que assim se preserva das misrias da vida, ou das sedu??es que talvez lhe acarretassem a perda. N?o  vtima da fatalidade aquele que morre na flor dos anos;  que Deus julga n?o convir que ele permane?a por mais tempo na Terra.     uma horrenda desgra?a, dizeis, ver cortado o fio de uma vida t?o prenhe de esperan?as! De que esperan?as falais? Das da Terra, onde o liberto houvera podido brilhar, abrir caminho e enriquecer? Sempre essa vis?o estreita, incapaz de elevar-se acima da matria. Sabeis qual teria sido a sorte dessa vida, ao vosso parecer t?o cheia de esperan?as? Quem vos diz que ela n?o seria saturada de amarguras? Desdenhais ent?o das esperan?as da vida futura, ao ponto de lhe preferirdes as da vida efmera que arrastais na Terra? Supondes ent?o que mais vale uma posi??o elevada entre os homens, do que entre os Espritos bem-aventurados?    Em vez de vos queixardes, regozijai-vos quando praz a Deus retirar deste vale de misrias um de seus filhos. N?o ser egostico desejardes que ele a continuasse para sofrer convosco? Ah! essa dor se concebe naquele que carece de f e que v na morte uma separa??o eterna. Vs, espritas, porm, sabeis que a alma vive melhor quando desembara?ada do seu invlucro corpreo. M?es, sabei que vossos filhos bem-amados est?o perto de vs; sim, est?o muito perto; seus corpos fludicos vos envolvem, seus pensamentos vos protegem, a lembran?a que deles guardais os transporta de alegria, mas tambm as vossas dores desarrazoadas os afligem, porque denotam falta de f e exprimem uma revolta contra a vontade de Deus.    Vs, que compreendeis a vida espiritual, escutai as pulsa??es do vosso cora??o a chamar esses entes bem-amados e, se pedirdes a Deus que os aben?oe, em vs sentireis fortes consola??es, dessas que secam as lgrimas; sentireis aspira??es grandiosas que vos mostrar?o o porvir que o soberano Senhor prometeu. - Sanson, ex-membro da Sociedade Esprita de  Paris. (1863.)|`|efd70501b95e0cee1ff33c4c66db6814aa	Faz parte da vida. Deus sabe o que faz!!!!|`|NeOWERf8aa	"N?o, a religi?o n?o  nada disso; a religi?o  a f, a esperan?a e a caridade.

Esta religi?o  a Caridade; o smbolo da caridade  a Comunh?o; e o oposto da comunh?o  excomunh?o; comungar  evocar a Deus, excomungar  evocar ao diabo.  Fazer bem  triunfar; e, aquele que n?o triunfa,  mais ou menos responsvel por sua torpeza. As coisas, na realidade, est?o de tal forma ordenadas pela Sabedoria Suprema que o mal n?o poderia ter um xito real e durvel, e que o bem, apesar de todas as demoras e de todos os obstculos, chega sempre a seu fim. Falas do mal que se produziu a propsito do Cristianismo. Este mal passou em parte, e o que dele resta, passar. Porm, o bem ficou e ficar. N?o  em nome de Torquemada, e sim em nome de Vicente de Paula que as irm?s de Caridade cuidam dos pobres rf?os. Alexandre VI n?o publicou jamais uma constitui??o apostlica justificando o envenenamento e o incesto. A religi?o  santa, os homens  que s?o maus.  que esse absurdo  a fonte infinita da raz?o, a luz brota eternamente das trevas eternas, a cincia, essa Babel do esprito, pode torcer e sobrepor suas espirais subindo sempre; ela poder fazer oscilar a Terra, nunca tocar o cus.   Buscando a Deus no absurdo encontra-se ao diabo; porm, procurando ao diabo n?o se encontra a raz?o. Analisai a Deus e ao diabo do vulgo; encontrareis no Deus o ideal poetizado do diabo e no diabo a caricatura de Deus".

gqgGgAf7aa	Ja, ich bin der Ansicht, keine staatlichen Subventionen an die Kirchen! Es ist Sache der Glaubensgemeinschaften, fr ihre eigenen Notwendigkeiten aufzukommen. Ich bin beispielsweise nicht bereit, Kosten fr den Erhalt unsinniger riesiger Kirchen ber die Steuer mit zu finanzieren. Ich bin Christin und geh?re zu einer Glaubensgemeinschaft, die keinerlei staatliche Untersttzungen erh?lt, sondern wo die Gl?ubigen selbst geben, was notwendig ist. Das ist meiner Meinung nach richtig und gesund. Der Staat hat mit Glaubensgemeinschaften nichts zu tun, weder mit Geld noch mit staatlicher " Anerkennung".|`|db5f60b1e09d593c01ac69d63f1696aaaa	Kommt ganz drauf an was damit gemacht wird, die Kirche ist wichtig fr unsere Menschen denen es nicht so gut geht.   Es gibt keine gr??ere Hilfsorganisation in DL.     Ich verstehe es nicht wieso ihr immer Subventionen streichen wollt. das Geld kann der Staat dann einsparen und es kommt sicher nicht beim Volk an. Die lachen sich dann ber unsere Doofheit Schrott.     Anderseit hat die katholishe Kirche mit ihrem Boykott gegen Amnesty International einen heftigen Schaden angerichtet, weil sie ohne Nachzudenken wieder ihre Intoleranz gezeigt haben. Das sollte man sicher nicht Untersttzen.     Aber solange die Kirche das Geld an die Brger weiter gibt(oder fr sie Einsetzt) sehe ich da kein Problem.  Wenn es da oben Leute geben wrde die sich Taschen voll packen wrden, dann wrde ich dir Recht geben.     Ich finde aber auch, das die Kirche zuviel Geld falsch anlegt(genau wie die Hilfsorganisationen) In Krefeld wurde ein Kirchturm saniert, das hat so viel Geld gekostet das die 3 ihrer Einrichtungen die seit 20 jahren existieren schlie?en mussten. Die Baustelle gibt es Heute noch und nur optisch hat sich was ver?ndert, das Ding war nicht Einsturzgef?hrdet.    ohman ich glaube die Solidarit?t ist grade mit nem Leichenwagen abtransportiert worden.|`|7ETbzHXFaa	Was glaubt ihr ist der unterschied zwischen der Pharis?er in den evangelien und den Papst.

In den neue Bundesl?ndern zerfallen eine gro?e Zahl hoch wertvoller romanischer Dorfkirchen, fr deren Renovierung das Geld fehlt. Private Initiativen mssen da einspringen, schaffen aber nicht alles. Daran beteiligen sich auch viele Atheisten, die ihre Dorfkirche lieben.  Soziale Einrichtungen werden nach dem Subsidiarit?tsprinzip untersttzt.

AA12158476	If you are looking for family, it is not that hard anymore via the internet. There are many avenues you can turn to. Google is a really good source. I am adopted and have found many of my family via court house records and other family members. I always thought I was an only child until I got my original birth certificate. I am the middle of seven. Once I found family members, they were more than willing to help me. Get your birth certificate and follow your heart. It may be hard or it might be easy. Either way, wanting to fill the void is something that only you can do. Good luck to you in your search. It's gonna be good for you, I know it.

Todas as coisas vieram  existncia por intermdio dele, e  parte dele nem mesmo uma s coisa veio  existncia.  O que veio  existncia ?por meio dele foi a vida, e a vida era a luz dos homens. ?E a luz est brilhando na escurid?o, mas a escurid?o n?o a tem vencido.  ?Surgiu um homem enviado como representante de Deus: seu nome era Jo?o. ?Este [homem] veio em testemunho, a fim de dar testemunho da luz, para que pessoas de toda sorte cressem por intermdio dele. ?Ele n?o era essa luz, mas havia de dar testemunho dessa luz.  ?A verdadeira luz que d luz a toda sorte de homem estava para vir ao mundo. ?Ele estava no mundo, e o mundo veio  existncia por intermdio dele, mas o mundo n?o o conheceu. ?Veio ao seu prprio lar, mas os seus n?o o acolheram. ?No entanto, a tantos quantos o receberam, a estes deu autoridade para se tornarem filhos de Deus, porque exerciam f no seu nome; ?e nasceram, n?o do sangue, nem da vontade carnal, nem da vontade do homem, mas de Deus.  ?De modo que a Palavra se tornou carne e residiu entre ns, e observamos a sua glria, uma glria tal como a de um filho unignito dum pai; e ele estava cheio de benignidade imerecida e de verdade. ?(Jo?o deu testemunho dele, sim, ele realmente clamou  este era aquele que [o] disse  dizendo: Aquele que vem atrs de mim avan?ou na minha frente, porque existiu antes de mim.) ?Pois todos ns recebemos de sua plenitude, sim, benignidade imerecida sobre benignidade imerecida. ?Porque a Lei foi dada por intermdio de Moiss, a benignidade imerecida e a verdade vieram  existncia por intermdio de Jesus Cristo. ?Nenhum homem jamais viu a Deus; o deus unignito, que est [na posi??o] junto ao seio do Pai,  quem o tem explicado.  No dia seguinte viu Jesus aproximar-se dele e disse: Eis o Cordeiro de Deus, que tira o pecado do mundo! ?Este  aquele a respeito de quem eu disse: Atrs de mim vem um homem que avan?ou na minha frente, porque existiu antes de mim. ?At eu n?o o conhecia, mas a raz?o por que vim batizar em gua era que ele fosse manifestado a Israel. ?Jo?o deu tambm testemunho, dizendo: Observei o esprito descer como pomba do cu; e permaneceu sobre ele. ?At eu n?o o conhecia, mas o Mesmo que me enviou a batizar em gua disse-me: Sobre quem for que vires descer o esprito e permanecer, este  quem batiza em esprito santo. ?E eu [o] vi e dei testemunho de que este  o FILHO DE DEUS.    Por que uma pomba?   Logo depois do batismo de Jesus em gua, desceu sobre ele o esprito santo, em forma corprea, semelhante a uma pomba. (Luc. 3:22) Esta descida do esprito pode ser comparvel ao adejar duma pomba ao se aproximar de seu pombal.  As pombas foram usadas pelos antigos israelitas para fins sacrificiais. (Mar. 11:15; Jo?o 2:14-16) A ave simbolizava a inocncia e a pureza, como se evidencia de Jesus dizer a seus seguidores: Mostrai-vos .?.?. inocentes como as pombas. (Mat. 10:16) Foi uma pomba que No soltou da arca que trouxe de volta um raminho de oliveira, indicando que as guas do dilvio estavam baixando. (Gn. 8:11) Isto apontava para o fato de que um tempo de descanso e paz estava s portas, pois tinha sido predito a respeito de No: Este nos trar consolo do nosso trabalho e da dor das nossas m?os, que resulta do solo que Jeov amaldi?oou. (Gn. 5:29) Assim, no batismo de Jesus, a pomba p?de, apropriadamente, trazer  aten??o o papel de Jesus como o Messias, o puro e imaculado Filho de Deus.

6hlrJDcCaa	De fato ainda n?o existe resposta para esta pergunta, pois ningum que tenha morrido, voltou a vida para relatar se h algo apo ela...Sendo racional, eu acredito que seja muitissimo pouco provavel que haja algo, justamente pelo fato de ningum ter comprovado e tambm por n?o fazer muito sentido. Tendo em vista que o que nos torna vivo  o nosso pensamento ("Eu penso e logo existo" DESCARTES) e todos estamos cansados de saber que o que gera nossos pensamentos, raciocinio, memoria e tudo mais que se forma em nossa mente,  o nosso cerebro, por intermedio de pulsos eletromagneticos que geram as lambdas (micro-ondas eletromagneticas que geram a comunica??o entre os neuronios e formam a sinapse (imagina??o, poder do cerebro em materializar o que imaginamos, pra que possamos analisar de forma ampla), que associada as fun??es motoras do nosso corpo, nos transforma em um ser pensante e aginte.     Sendo assim acho dificil que depois de nosso corpo e nosso cerebro serem organicamente reinterado ao meio ambiente, sem forma, vida ou liga??o alguma entre as celulas que o formavam, que ainda consigamos pensar, o que torna ainda menos provavel que haja conciencia na eternidade pos morte...    Embora se houvesse, acredito que seria uma furada, pois  obvio que apos algum tempo (mesmo que sejam alguns milenios), tudo sem duvidas se tornaria demaziadamente entediante, a ponto de tornar insuportavel o estado de existencia. At porque  fato que chegaria uma hora que n?o haveria mais o que fazer....    Se n?o for assim, existe ainda a ideia de magia, gerada por um ser cosmicamente conciente, mas mesmo nessas condi??es a existencia n?o poderia ter muita gra?a, pois isto nos tornaria infinitamente inferior ao nosso gerador, que certamente nos escravisaria, como os deuses de todas as religi?es escravisam os seres humanos que as seguem. Dizendo como devem, pensar, portarem-se, agirem, limitarem-se e com isso impedem que tenham uma vida feliz prometendo que apos a morte todos os males ser?o cessados. Porem ao mesmo tempo impoem muitas amea?as de puni??es severas ao que n?o aceitarem serem escravisados desde ja, o que por sua vez impede que a pessoa possa ter uma eternidade feliz apos a morte, pois se seguirmos a risca, n?o viveremos felizes, e se seguirmos a risaca, ficaremos eternamente tristes e desgostosos ao sabermos que muitos dos que amavamos foram castigados com dores e tristezas inimaginaveis. Pior de tudo  que saberiamos que quem aplicou esta puni??o e permitiu que isto acontcesse xom os que amavamos, foi o mesmo que nos colocou em situa??o "confortavel" por termos aceitado ser seu escravo, mas isto (ao menos para mim) seria motivo mais que suficiente para odia-lo, aponto que obviamente querer ate me vingar por tanta tirania contra minha gente, a mesma gente que sofreu a vida toda e agora suportaria penitencias em um mundo horrivel, denominado inferno, por um demonio horrivel, denominado satanas, mas que por outro lado foram criados pelo mesmo causador de tudo...    Portanto, acho que vida eterna  um termo impossivel de ser colocado em pratica e se ainda assim colocado, considero algo insuportavel e inviavel...    Vendo tudo assim t?o complicado, prefiro acreditar nas pessoas, nos humanos que coexistem com todos nos, o mesmo humano desprezil por muitos de seus atos, mas ao mesmo tempo admiravel pela sua capacidade em superar obstaculos e seguir sempre rumo a evolu??o... Prefiro acreditar que um dia o proprio ser humano descobrira uma forma de parar o envelhecimento das celular, fazer o tempo mover-se mais de vagar, ou para tras, ou ainda descobrir uma forma de rejuvenecer as celulas, tornando todos jovens de novo...Isto sim seria admiravel e faria a vida eterna ser t?o maravilhosa quanto a vida que vivemos, ou pelo mennos poderiamos viver sem doen?as, dores, incapaciades e tudo mais de ruim que um dia poder+a ser superado sem duvidas, pela tecnologia...|`|Bps5o5HKaa	Tenho que ler mais sobre o assunto, mas te adianto que, segundo a Bblia, todos aqueles quanto aceitarem a Cristo em vida herdar?o a vida eterna.

YZv8Ub3Haa	Christians claim the special pleading logical fallacy when asked about their god's origins.    http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies...|`|uxfacsgmaa	Sorry dude, but you are NOT going to get a straight answer. Most theists probably don't think about it too in-depth to really sort out how they themselves can believe it.|`|IYBTmH26aa	I don't follow your logic either.  Something that is created whether it is complex or simplistic has to come from somewhere and have a creator.      By pure scientific reason, it makes no sense for something to exist just because.  It doesn't follow any of the laws of physics.  Something just does not come out of nothing, the nought, spontaneously.  There must be matter to have it appear, react, be formed, develop.    The exception to all that is the creation of God which is a mystery all to itself.  Where did He come from?  Unfortunately, we have no other statement or evidence to show where He came from except books like the Holy Bible in which God states that He and Jesus always were, is and will be.  Perhaps He'll tell us one day, but we simply don't have any other answer available to us.  And the Bible was written as manual for human kind to follow to lead them to salvation from eternal death.  It was not written to have been the anthology of the cosmos and all of existence.  Maybe God will show us that book someday.  I don't know.     Since He, rather They (The Father and the Son), were first before anything, including matter, they are the origin of all things, and no one else is mentioned before them.  They create their own laws, rules, design things their way.  They are THE creator of creators      Believing in a creator is quite simple really.    By the way, "the eye being so complicated (you meant complex, right?) that is impossible"?  It exists, doesn't it?  So how is it impossible?    God is neither complex nor complicated, but we humans who have strayed away from God, have made things complicated.  Just by sheer cause and effect, something distracted us from God's way, that would be the Devil (who's good at tricking us).  If there was no Devil, there would be no distraction.  And God who created the Devil (a very complex and complicating being) is allowed to exist and perplex for now.     Because God is deliberate in His actions, He has a purpose for allowing the Devil to do His deeds to us.  It is a test for us to become a part of the Kingdom of Heaven, a place of eternal bliss.  If you don't meet the quals, you don't get to play kind of thing.  Since the Devil is the worst that they come by, we're being tested against the best obstacle.      So, yes, I would say I'm a theist in that I believe in God and His rules and His reasoning because they seem to hold and stick better than most other forms of reasoning.|`|Cf8VzXVZaa	"The answer I always see is "god exists outside of time/space" or "god is infinte, he always existed." Shouldn't that make believeing in the creator more difficult?"    Why would it? It makes more sense to me that if there was such a God, He would have always existed, otherwise he wouldn't really be God, because He would need a creator himself, then Him a creator, and you have an infinite regress of creators, which doesn't make much sense. In fact, if he was created by something else, and didn't eternally exist, I would argue that believing in him would then be more difficult. Not the other way around.    As of right now, I believe the universe is eternal, just like a theist would believe that God is eternal. Except God is God! IF one existed, it would make sense that He existed eternally, yet alone the universe He created.|`|HIskrREJaa	*chuckles*  you're asking them to question their god and religion and i don't think you are going to get an answer as "complex" as you want.    but, i do like brian's answer.|`|hQDapmICaa	Let Me Get This Straight (About god)?      why bother?      1Co 2:13  Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.     1Co 2:14  But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.       Peace!|`|l195kTc6aa	your wrong god is in the simplicity of life, the world and the universe works on a divine clock that seems to work for us....now here u are questioning the grestest artist ever...people can have belief without religion.|`|tW86bOMNaa	Logically-speaking, they dodge this conundrum at the outset.    They argue that there was a time before the existence of the eye (ditto, the Universe) and that now there is an eye. An eye was therefore created; it therefore needs a creator - and since it is a complex creation, it must necessarily therefore have had a complex creator.    By contrast, they argue, there was no time before there was a god; therefore there is no need for a creator of a god; therefore the complexity of the god becomes a moot (or even, an inadmissible and inarguable) aspect.    Frankly, I believe that they are barking up the wrong tree. The proposition of 'a god' is an enormously complicated one, especially when compared with the 'it just happened' naturalistic argument. But in many ways, they are right: the dismissal of the complicated proposition is itself based on the exercise of a particular belief system: that simple solutions are better than complex ones.    Nice try, though. Why not formulate the argument instead in terms of a (God, Universe) pair, and call that a UNIVERSE? That way, you don't need to separate god from the UNIVERSE in your argument?    BTW - the fallacy arises from the statement that 'a complex creation necessarily requires a more complex creator' This is logically indefensible and, of course, incorrect. But you knew that already, I assume?|`|YhQpJ1SFaa	I don't think positing god as the answer to the question "how it began" or "how was the eye created" and then answering the question "where did god come from" with "he is outside of time" is any more or less difficult to swallow than the idea of cosmic space and time. billions of years and light years is as difficult a concept as infinity. I'm not arguing against either. I'm just saying that the way we understand the universe around us takes a leap of faith. Its the nature of understanding something that you can never have a direct experience with. Really when you want to get down to brass tacks, can you prove that the concept of being grounded in reality isn't itself a trick of reality. Everything that we experience may be an illusion. One of the basic premises that needs to be accepted for the scientific principle to function is that the universe is "knowable" but until we can develop a test that negates the human perspective we can not prove that this is true. Personally, I think the idea of proving or disproving god, with logic or otherwise, is futile. Unless you've got some kind of philosophically objective viewpoint on the universe that none of the rest of us do, and if that is true hello nobel prize.|`|TFThZ9mgaa	God's power is beyond our scope of understanding b/c we see things with man's ability and man's ability is limited while God's is limitless. im a little confused by your question but take into consideration the human body. each organ does a specific function. together they make the whole human body work. if one organ fails then the others eventually follow suit and the body dies. what im saying is if we just appeared then how does it all work together so completely and so perfectly? also consider the planet and its ecosystem, each creature great and small coexist to help maintain one another. there is a purpose for everything and there is a purpose for man. if you take away our purpose (which is we were created to have fellowship with God) how are we different from any other animal. where does our soul and spirit come in to play. redemption and divine intervention are in God's word. the bible says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and was God. John 1:1. if we are to believe in a true God then we must indeed believe His word. it is a choice of faith. either you choose to believe on faith or you don't. how is it science is so easily accepted when it is an institution of man and all men are fallible. im not saying science is all fallible but it is not entirely reliable either. if we truly came from monkeys and evovled then why are we not still evoling? did evolution cease? why are there still apes that have never evolved? my beliefs are based on faith. faith is believing without seeing. have you ever seen a million dollars? i mean, laid your own eyes on it? i haven't but i know it exists. people believe in so many things. some believe in aliens, some believe in evolution, some believe in ghosts. my question is this, how come it is so easy to believe in these things but so hard to believe in a Father who loves and watches over us all? if we loved one another, forgave one another and laid all our cares upon Him, what a beautiful life that would be. if we just followed His word. i know i may have not satisfied your question, but consider this, if someone loses an eye, a synthetic can replace it. it will have the same look as a normal eye but it will never be the same. it will never function the same b/c man cannot create what God can, no matter how hard he tries. it is too complex for us but not for Him. everything we have the ability to do, He gave us the ability to do. it is a choice of faith. by the way, i have seen God. i have seen Him in His people and all He created and i feel Him in my heart. i feel His presence when i pray and that's real enough for me.|`|L7hXkIyiaa	Lets hone back in on the Eye for a minute.  Being the window to the soul and all...  How marvelous and beyond comprehension is it created?  Now think about the computer. Is it created? Yes I believe, by God though the minds and the eyes, hands of men.    Where ever you are, through this brilliant technology, within a minute I will send this off to you and if your in front of your computer, pretty much a few moments later you will receive it.    Now it is faster than the speed of light, the instant you look at my post, from the eyes to the spinal cord and into the brain,what you see is highly, -well insurmountable to comprehend.    It's miraculous, and how much, even now the thoughts I have being passed down to this gadget to feel the letters of as I press them, which relays instantaneously back to the brain, and write (hopefully) exactly what I want it too, then with a click of a button,  The information is relayed to millions of computers across the world, whether it is read or not,  ..but mainly to one man. Who basically (to most of us) looks at it and is stimulated with much the same process.    "There's way too much we take for granted, and way too little time to do it in" -Catherine Nancarrow.    Yes I believe in God, yep the One who created you and me.  I'm going to say a little prayer for you, Clarity, because unlike what our friend Tubberoot said,the Truth is God desires for all to be saved and come to know Him.  Ask people to pray for you!? the Christians that you know, and I'll have a good stab in the dark a couple somewhere have been, a least one for a Loong time *smile*.   As interceding(praying deeply) for some-one is another way God will start to draw some-one to Him and look favourably upon them.    He also knows when some-one is so hard-hearted, they would sooner spit at Him on their deathbed than ask forgiveness from their sins.    God IS a good God* my friend. He hasn't let me down once. And He says He is closer than a brother. Pretty cool ay!    I'll leave you with a Scripture:  2 Peter 3:9   The Lord is not slow in fulfilling His promise, in the sense in which some men speak of slowness. But He bears patiently with you, His desire being that no one should perish but that all should come to repentance.|`|AA10404869	God's existence can never be proven-nor can you prove that He doesn't exist.  As for all the rest, faith.  That and having a personal experience with the God of the universe that teaches us to trust in Him.    You pray.  He answers.  The more you pray, the more you hear from Him, the more you trust in Him.    Pretty simple.

The animals are found in the order they were buried, not the order they "evolved". Almost ALL fossils are found in sedimentary rock, which used to be sediment - FLOOD sediment.     There are no "millions of years". That's a crock. The layering of the rocks are not due to "millions of years" of soil deposition, but due to hydrologic sorting from a Flood. The fact that human artifacts and modern human skeletons are found in solid rock that is supposedly "hundreds of millions of years old" proves that the rocks are dated wrong.|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	there is no limit to the folly of delusional belief|`|mNyhRGowaa	Look at me I can dig and get grants from tax payers if I can put it together too look like what is really not!|`|5e50c0ab71cc45110b7754fc5ce9ee2daa	Living creatures have been dated by current methods to be 100's of thousands of years old.

As has been pointed out many times (here and elsewhere), only a small minority of Christians accept the literal Creation story, while the rest of us appreciate the beauty of the metaphor therein.    Satan didn't plant the fossils, and they aren't fake.  The majority of Christians believe that evolution, over hundreds of millions of years, happened at the behest of Almighty God.    The Bible talks about sickness being caused by demons.  The last time I was sick, I went to Mennonite Christian Hospital in Hualien (Taiwan).  The Christian nurse took my temperature and blood pressure, and the Christian doctor prescribed antiobiotics.  There was no laying on of hands, and no prayers--just practical medical treatment made available by the talent and brains and ability of intelligent Christians.  Preachers and prayers are for when there is no hope.  Or seems to be none.  We Christians believe that there is always hope-although not necessarily for our desired outcome.    By the way, the majority of Christians have a normal sense of humour.  Satan planting fossils to fake us out.  That's a good one!|`|AA12193600	Did god kill the talking snake after the garden thing--is that what all the hooplah with that big azz mother they found is?

snquiqTgaa	Anyone, anywhere, anytime can meet God. (Sorry, I know my answer's really long, but I just had to say all this stuff..it all comes together)  Don't be bothered by any of the rude answers--they have obviously made their decision about God. Everyone makes their own personal decision--to receive Him or reject Him, but don't let that affect your decision.. because you must give an account of yourself one day, not anyone else.     Ok, get this: God loves you..more than any other human being on the planet..He loves you more than you can fathom..God created you, He created all of us to have a relationship with Him..  This is why we all have a deep underlying desire to know God, to be loved, to be accepted--it's because true love and the need for true acceptance will NEVER be fully met unless a person has a relationship with God...It's what we were created for--to have eternal fellowship with God in Heaven. It's perfect. It's beautiful. It's the way things are supposed to be..    But wait..some people think that if you live a "good" life, you'll enter heaven.    False!    As far as going to heaven, no one can enter heaven off the basis of "good" works. You see, God is utterly perfect and holy, a righteous God who has higher standards than man. Our sin is unacceptable to Him; it separates us from Him and demands consequences..If you have broken even one of the ten commandments (God's law) then you are guilty before a holy God and will not be allowed access to heaven. You see, since God is JUST, he MUST punish sin. Hell is what we all deserve because we have transgressed God's standard and done evil. However, because God is also loving and merciful, He humbled himself as one of us, came to earth in the form of a man (Jesus Christ), lived a sinless life, died on the cross, and paid your "fine" for sin. He became the sacrifice for everyone's sin. If that's not a true testimony of love and God's goodness, redeeming us forever, then I don't know what is..All you must do is repent, trust Him as your Savior, and make Him the Lord of your life. And He is mighty to save! (John 3:16)     He promises to cast your sins "as far as the east is from the west." (Psalm 103:12)    :)    And don't be fooled..Listen, there's a BATTLE going on..a battle for your SOUL..there's a battle for everyone's soul..every member of your family, every friend or adult or any person you've ever known. God gave us all a desire to feel loved, to know Him..and He also wrote His laws on our heart..He gave us a conscience..This is why we feel wrong when we have done something wrong. Some people choose not to listen to that conscience, to drown it out, but that's a whole nother story..  Listen, God is real, yes, and you obviously already agree with that. But there is ALSO a devil who is just as real, and his goal was to defeat God. But he couldn't. You see, when Jesus defeated Satan on the cross, he took back the keys of hell and death, he won the battle--the struggle over good and evil! Jesus prevailed! He took our punishment and defeated Satan!     He also appointed a time for Himself to return--Jesus is coming back!!--but along with that, He is going to put an end to the devil and all evil in the lake of fire for ever and ever. The devil knows he has a short time..and because of this, he is doing everything he can to drown out the message of God, God's love, and drag as many people to hell with him as he can! He's doing it through deception--to convince people of LIES..  lies like,   "God's not real."   "You have plenty of time."   "A good God wouldn't really let anyone go to hell."    These are ALL lies from the devil..He's trying to deceive the multitudes..and look at society! look at the world! See the effects?  BUT GOD IS GOING TO END IT ALL! HE'S COMING BACK VERY VERY SOON!! He will put an end to the mess and reward those who trusted in Him.. though so so many will reject Him..it is very sad..     I never knew true peace before trusting God as my Savior. When I began to perceive life as a chapter of eternity,  L I F E  took on a completely different meaning. God IS real, heaven IS real, and so is hell. We all only have one life and one shot. Trust Christ today. And READ the Bible. IT is TRUTH. God loves you and wants nothing more than for you to spend eternity with Him in His kingdom. :)       If you want to accept Christ as your Savior, then ask God to forgive you of your sins, repent, turn away from them, and ask Jesus into your heart..Read the Bible and seek Him DAILY..He is the only hope for humanity...and He loves you so much!   Here is an example prayer:  Father, I know that I have broken your laws and my sins have separated me from you. I am truly sorry, and now I want to turn away from my past sinful life toward you. Please forgive me, and help me avoid sinning again. I believe that your son, Jesus Christ died for my sins, was resurrected from the dead, is alive, and hears my prayer. I invite Jesus to become the Lord of my life, to rule and reign in my heart from this day forward. Please send your Holy Spirit to help me obey You, and to do Your will for the rest of my life. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.    Best wishes and God bless! :)|`|a6JNx1tgaa	I want to meet Ron Weasly, but we can't have everything.|`|03c287c9e9e2feef723946b70ad122f4aa	Die      Ecc 12:7  Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.|`|AA11264399	You can't.

When you pray this prayer, God gives you forgiveness and blessing, guidance and protection plus you go to heaven to be with God forever after you die. To accept Jesus into your life, you can say a prayer like this: "Dear God, I know that I am a sinner and that Jesus Christ is the sacrifice for my sins. I have done the following sins (state these out) and I pray to discontinue these sins. I pray to receive Jesus Christ into my life as my Lord and Savior forever. In Jesus' name, amen." Praying this prayer makes you a born-again Christian. You could call a few Christian churches near you and see what they are doing.

I have no problem showing my name, face, or anything in regards to protest. I have nothing to hide.        Good for you pointing this out. I think at times, we become too complacent. We need to realize that we have a responsibility, that goes beyond national borders, to look out for each other.    Kudos to you, from me!!!!!!|`|fJA8zqe8aa	I am a soldier in the army of my God. The Lord Jesus Christ is my commanding officer. The Holy Bible is my code of conduct. Faith, prayer, and the Word are my weapons of warfare. I have been taught by the Holy Spirit, trained by experience, tried by adversity and tested by fire. I am a volunteer in this army, and I am enlisted for eternity. I will either retire in this army at the Rapture or die in this army; but I will not get out, sell out, be talked out, or pushed out. I am faithful, reliable, capable and dependable. If my God needs me, I am there. If He needs me in the Sunday school, to teach the children, work with the youth, help adults or just sit and learn, He can use me because I am there! I am a soldier. I am not a baby. I do not need to be pampered, petted, primed up, pumped up, picked up or pepped up. I am a soldier. No one has to call me, remind me, write me, visit me, entice me, or lure me. I am a soldier. I am not a wimp. I am in place, saluting my King, obeying His orders, praising His name, and building His kingdom! No one has to send me flowers, gifts, food, cards, candy or give me handouts. I do not need to be cuddled, cradled, cared for, or catered to. I am committed. I cannot have my feelings hurt bad enough to turn me around. I cannot be discouraged enough to turn me aside. I cannot lose enough to cause me to quit. When Jesus called me into this army, I had nothing. If I end up with nothing, I will still come out ahead. I will win. My God has and will continue to supply all of my needs. I am more than a conqueror. I will always triumph. I can do all things through Christ. Devils cannot defeat me. People cannot disillusion me. Weather cannot weary me. Sickness cannot stop me. Battles cannot beat me. Money cannot buy me. Governments cannot silence me and hell cannot handle me. I am a soldier. Even death cannot destroy me. For when my commander calls me from this battlefield, He will promote me to Captain and then allow me to rule with Him. I am a soldier in the army, and I'm marching claiming victory. I will not give up. I will not turn around. I am a soldier, marching heaven bound. Here I stand!                 Will you stand with me? Guess what? If you've accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior you're already enlisted! Question is, which part of the service are you in:     1. Active Duty: Serving the Lord faithfully, daily, and on duty     24-7?     2.      Reserve status: Serving only when called upon or twice a  year, Christmas and Easter?     3.      Guard status: Backing up the Active Duty group?        Or;     4.      AWOL! Absent without the Lord?              Steven|`|0JHi6Rxaaa	Nope.

It could be somewhat related to "hollow' which meant valley at first  with side meaning both shallow and deep. So, this meaning would go toward the deep, of course.    So, a connection could be made that to call over a valley, one had to yell.    The earliest meaning of "hall" meant something hidden so backward would be in plain sight.    The word "Allah" had something to do with the moon. So, it could be that when the moon was in sight it was "Allah" and not in sight "Halla".    This is just me, I'm sure someone will give a better answer.    It does not matter the language but the concept, if the concept is the same it can be similar in spelling, if correctly translated.

AA11232725	You don't have to pray, you just have to believe.    Philippians 1:21  For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.  22  But if I live on in the flesh, this will mean fruit from my labor; yet what I shall choose I cannot tell.  23  For I am hard-pressed between the two, having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.    Psalms 16:8  I have set the LORD always before me; Because  He is at my right hand I shall not be moved.  9  Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices; My flesh also will rest in hope.  10  For You will not leave my soul in Sheol, Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.  11  You will show me the path of life; In Your presence is fullness of joy; At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.    1 Thessalonians 4:14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus.  15  For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep.  16  For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first.  17  Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.

Not pressuring her into opening up, but just letting her know that you understand she is hurting, and that you can Not imagine her pain that she feels for her loss, and just explaining that when she is ready too talk, you will be there.

4e1b2eaf97f033fd20db1a0fa3c6abbbaa	Zen (Ch'an) Buddhism is one of the traditional schools of Mahayana Buddhism. Besides Mahayana (the predominant form of Buddhism in China, Vietnam, and Japan), there are also Theravada Buddhism (predominantly in Sri Lanka and Thailand) and Vajrayana (Tibetan Buddhism). On the whole, Zen has a marked anti-intellectual cast, compared to the rather scholastic Theravada schools; its focus is entirely on meditation, not on intellectual knowledge. Zen lacks the deity worship of Vajrayana, which is derived from the latter's syncretism with Tibetan animism (called Bon). If you're drawn to Buddhism, my advice is to experience all three major schools before deciding where to settle down and practice.    I'm a Christian, BTW, and I apologize for my ignorant co-religionist who made his comment above.|`|f16ee0e727e4acd5a2d1de588c80eb3aaa	None.

All that matters anyway is the basic teachings of buddha you shouldnt get lost in different sect meanings. All you need to do is apply the questions that buddha presents in a n unbiased way.|`|e385e5d6656bf6d068a4dc4b34fe4fb9aa	Details about Zen you can find at wikipedia (link below).    Now what's the difference?    Zen is daily life. Zen is simple.    The only problem is to remove all your waste in mind so that the pure and simple mind remains. That's not that easy. Zen Buddhists do this by practicing zazen, sitting meditation. In the beginning it is help full to have an experienced teacher, because your mind is so acquainted with certain structures in thinking. The teacher will know and apply a few very effective tools like koan practice, depending of the particular school.    Once, after a couple of years, you may have gained a little glimpse into the true nature of things. The rest of your life you have to struggle hard to get this experience into your everyday life.    Then in the end life is simple.    Now try to compare this kind of view to Theravada, Mahayana or Vajrayana-Buddhism (links below).|`|92922806f253b298060ad229182be081aa	Hi,    Ok. In essence, both Zen Buddhism and "traditional" Buddhism are no different. Both emphasises the understanding of emptiness.    What differs however, is the method and practice. Zen might emphasis more on meditation and the direct experiencing of "enlightenment". Traditional Buddhism would emphasise on purification to experience "enlightenment".    In fact, Buddha taught different methods to cater to different individuals.    Hope this helped.|`|33afa551b3e0d8c9490373b788041404aa	Hi,        I would like to add something to the answers here.       From what I know , Traditional Buddhism Schools and zen Buddhism are complimentary . They are not at opposites of each other .       Before one can gain the Supreme Enlightenment and see and experience one's Buddha Nature through Zen , one has to go through the various cultivation and practice offered by Traditional Buddhism.      Traditional Buddhism has progression levels , allowing a person who wished to become a Buddha , to study and practise from zero knowledge, zero spirtitual practice and progress stage by stage up .         Whereas Zen Buddhism has no levels , no teachings by the written  text , employs unorthodox methods, to let one gain the Supreme Enlightenment.         It is not easy. Without the foundation cultivation from Traditional Buddhism,  one could not really comprehend what Zen is all about, as you would be experiencing directly your Buddha Nature.        To use an analogy, you could think of Zen Buddhism as doing your Doctorate Degree while the Traditional Buddhism are your training to get your Diplomas and Bachelor Degrees .         Without the foundation training in your DIplomas and Bachelor Degrees , it is impossible for you to pursue your Doctorate Degree.            Hoped this helps.

b872e6109d83901f6b21430160dcadcaaa	It is a term that refers to people who abstain from drinking, drugs and smoking. Some straight edge people also do not have sex. Straight edge people commonly wear clothing or accessories marked with XXX. The XXX trend was started by a band called Minor Threat. When they played at venues, their patrons (underage) would be marked with and "X" on their hand to signify that they cannot drink, I believe they sang a song about being sober and having a straight edge (as in a ruler). This concept took on a cult following and was expanded to into three X's meaning that they do not drink, smoke or do drugs. Early hardcore fans would walk around with three x's on their hands, clothes and backpacks. So you are straight edge and you are XXX.|`|ed8063252588b7fe6a1028cc34a07c98aa	kinda like a punk or alternative type person who doesnt use drugs/acohol|`|14d9bbac6cde9e37dbacc727188cadfbaa	It's a punk or rocker who never has sex, do drugs or drink.

863c29ce97fba7d9fe5fe5ba2bbf1d8faa	The word n*gger is a derogatory term. It stirs up the pain of centuries of hate, hardship, and torment.     It dates back to the time when black people were forced to work as slaves for white people. Black people were considered to be animals or possessions that the white people could do with what they wanted. During this time, Black people were called n*ggers. They were brutally murdered, raped, beat, worked to death, sold on auction blocks and ripped from their families (plus every other possible horrible thing you could think of).    Black people have had to fight very hard to get the same things that white people automatically got just because they are born white. The race as a whole is still fighting to be viewed as equal.    The word n*gger is an insult that belittles a Black person when it is used by anyone that isn't Black. It can be used between close friends or family just the same as lesbians can jokingly call each other dykes and gay men can jokingly call each other fags.|`|LJRH8LPhaa	I think it's because they know that it's not meant to cause offence if they use it, because you wouldn't be derogatory about yourself; whereas if a non-black says it, then it might be due to prejudiced beliefs, and they might mean to hurt by using it.

uLjpvfrbaa	The same thing they have against blacks, whites and every other race for that matter.  There will always be people who will find fault with an entire race based on the actions of a few people.  However, I wouldn't base my view of racism on what you read on here.  There are too many trolls on here with absolutely nothing better to do but make over-the-top comments in the hopes of getting a lot of responses.  These are people who probably don't get any type of personal interaction in their daily lives and will take any attention - even negative - that they can get.  They're just lonely.  I'm not defending their words - just commenting that they are not the typical person you'd meet on the street because they're hiding behind their anonymity on line.  People like that are not really out in society - they're hiding in their rooms, getting more lonely and bitter my the second.  Most people are not like that.|`|wvfyfm8oaa	I love Asians!

Catless (?le maurice)         Prparation : 10 mn + 1  2 heures de repos  Cuisson : 2 -3 mn environ pour chaque catless      Ingrdients (pour 10 catless) :    - 750 g de boeuf hach   - 1 oeuf entier   - 1 oignon finement hach au couteau   - 2 gousses d'ail crases en pure   - 1 petit morceau de gingembre rap trs finement ou 1 cuillre  caf rase en poudre   - 3 pinces de piment de cayenne moulu (si vous aimez piquant)   - 1 cuillre  caf rase de cumin moulu   - 10 branches de coriandre fra?che haches   - sel     Pour la cuisson :   - 3 cuillres  soupe de farine   - 2 - 3 oeufs entiers   - de la chapelure   - huile      Prparation :    Mlanger la viande avec l'ail, le gingembre et l'oignon dans un saladier. Laisser reposer pendant minimum 1 heure  temprature ambiante sauf s'il fait chaud (alors vous placerez le saladier dans le bas du frigo).     Au bout de ce temps ajouter l'oeuf battu en omelette, le piment, le cumin et les feuilles de coriandre haches. Saler. Faire 10 boulettes ou + que vous aplatirez, que l'on appelle "catless" (paisseur 1 cm environ, mais pas plus). Poser dans un grand plat large.     Mettre 3 cuillres  soupe d'huile  chauffer dans une pole anti-adhsive. Passer une catless dans la farine en enlevant l'excdent en tapotant, puis dans l'oeuf battu en omelette et dernire passage dans la chapelure. Poser gentillement dans l'huile bien chaude. Laisser cuire environ 1 mn (faire juste colorer et ne pas laisser trop cuire sinon la viande sera trop cuite et ne sera pas juteuse). Retourner dlicatement et laisser cuire autant. La cuisson dpendra du feu, selon qu'il est fort ou pas et aussi de l'paisseur des catless.     Recommencer de mme avec les autres catless. Vous pouvez faire cuire plusieurs en mme temps, il suffit de surveiller ceux que l'on met en premier.     Servez chaud accompagns d'une salade compose (laitue, tomates, concombre...) sauce au yaourt  la ciboulette. Se mange chaud, tide ou froid.|`|6762b1bd4aece27efde426a6b0525802aa	http://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=TKz4qVmUz8...    un peu de musique..|`|Ll2Krn8Xaa	essaye et tu sauras|`|9eb5d8c77b6e6770fe05b9e1a93ea490aa	plus rien a dire apres puck...     http://www.estvideo.com/dew/images/2004_...|`|4KTOM3Fvaa	mon pnis est la partie male et ta queux est la partie femelle salle ptasse|`|DDbQhlvcaa	oh ben dis donc, t as bien fait de poser cette question, j avais des recettes a poser pour la suite du menu....  alors apres les accras, je peux aussi faire des petits pats a la fta, c est super bon....    pour l entre :    Christophine Farcie    Ingrdients    2 Christophines  3 Cives  2 Oignons  2 gousses d'   ail  150 g de lard de poitrine fum  1 Piment fort (tres hot le piment... tres HOT !!!!)

izY3JNhqaa	I've learned that there is usually a reason when our gaydar goes off ... it takes one to know one and all that.  I like to give them a smile and act friendly to them and see how they respond.  If they return the friendliness they are usually gay.  Str8 guys pick up on me flirting but they react differently.  They will be all happy but then you can tell when they figure it out and the smile drains from their face and they get this look like you just ran over their cat or something.  I hate it when that happens but would rather know then that AFTER asking him out on a date or something.    My gay dar rarely lies ... it did get me all wild over this German guy who was hitching and he told me that he was str8 but I let him stay at my house for a few days and we ran around and did all sorts of fun things and then this one night I asked him if he would mind fooling around and he thought about it and said "Sure".  I love it when str8 guys let you play.  It's kinda more fun than gay guys.  I think it jacks up my endorphins, among other things.    :-)  Peace ... str8 curious dudes|`|cf58090da8ac299442c062ff347f6194aa	It happens all the time.

There are still a lot of homophobic people out there and asking if someone is gay is still perceived as an attack on someone's character.  Seriously the best way to find out, I think, is to start talking about lesbians, and then move your way up from there.  Maybe point someone out walking by and be like, "that dude is so gay" just feel it out and see what his response to it is...if it's good, then move forward...but seriously with guys you don't know about, the friends first approach is always the safest!|`|AA11272787	yes, once and right now i have that trouble, since i have this workmate here, that seems so nice but and good to talk with, but im afraid to confide the feeling because he might turn it down, (duh)|`|bjaM7ABcaa	no|`|JuWYsd3saa	I've liked alot of guys, and still do.......I haven't pursued any of them as of yet.....I think they're all str8.

ieFRAtkRaa	Plusieurs rponses ci-dessus accumulent le tout et le n'importe quoi.  L'accent, voire les accents, du Qubec, sont effectivement la rsultante de l'volution des anciens accents des colons francophones du vieux continent. La plupart venaient en effet du nord de la France mais aussi de l'ouest.  N'oublions pas que les accents de France sont le rsultat de la transposition des systmes phonologiques des langues autochtones (langues rgionales) parles sur le territoire fran?ais.  En l'occurrence, la plupart des colons venaient du territoire de langue d'o?l (moiti nord de la France sauf priphries) et que par consquent la plupart parlaient avant tout un dialecte de langue d'o?l (picard, normand, poitevin...) ainsi que parfois un fran?ais, plus ou moins "standard" (pour peu que le standard du fran?ais  cette date ait un sens), largement matin du dialecte d'o?l en question. Ces idiomes d'o?l (fran?ais y compris) taient malgr tout proches entre eux de telle sorte que le fran?ais du Qubec, comme lingua franca, a merg sans difficult,  priori avec une forte influence du parler populaire de Paris si l'on en croit les dernires explications.  En l'occurrence, tous les Fran?ais, de toutes rgions, ont un accent.  Souvent, on considre l'accent standard (que quasiment personne ne possde au demeurant), comme une absence d'accent et de l notre manire de percevoir par degr d'loignement les accents s'en distinguant.   Il n'y a rien de plus erron linguistiquement.  Aujourd'hui, l'accent qubcois n'est pas davantage rest fig dans le temps que les accents de France. Toute langue change avec le temps. L'accent qubcois n'est pas le reflet de l'accent du temps de l'arrive des colons. Cependant, il en porte la trace.  L'accent poitevin contemporain (h oui, il est encore bien prsent) notamment fait largement penser  l'accent qubcois.   Il ne faut pas non plus ngliger l'influence des autres langues en contact avec le fran?ais du Qubec dans la formation de l'accent qubcois d'aujourd'hui.    Pour conclure, n'oublions pas non plus que d'autres langues de France ont migr sur le Nouveau continent : occitan, breton... et qu'il existe galement une autre varit "rgionale", bien loign du standard du fran?ais, au Qubec, qui est le joual.    Dernire prcision: l'accent est un phnomne linguistique, il n'existe pas hors la langue, il est partie prenante de la langue bien entendu, il s'agit d'un phnomne prosodique ; il est donc impossible de le distinguer de la langue qui le porte.|`|qitGkqNgaa	Pour eux, c' est nous qui avons un accent, on parle pointu !

Je crois bien que tu as raison|`|xjTHDfnwaa	il parait que c'est l'accent des fran?ais sont venus coloniser le Qubec (l'ancien accent fran?ais) tandis que le l'accent fran?ais c'est modifi au fil du temps en France ben au Qubec c'est rest le mme.  Donc lorsque tu entends un Qubecois parler avec son accent alors tu entends a quoi pouvait ressembler l'ancien accent fran?ais.  J'espre que j'ai pu t'clairer bizz!|`|YpfsGBMMaa	?a date du dbut des colonies,du vieux fran?ais.Mais je te ferai remarquer que chaque territoire francophone,y compris les territoires fran?ais du continent,possde son accent qui lui est propre.|`|yRQWuf9Maa	C'est le "bel" accent des rois de France ("L'tat, c'est mou", dixit Louis XIV), qui est rest dans la colonie canadienne, dfinitivement perdue en 1759, et coupe de la mtropole. Trente ans plus tard, les bourgeois de Paris faisaient leur petite rvolution, et imposaient leur accent "utilitaire", qui ncessitait d'ar-ti-cu-ler pour bien se faire comprendre dans les discours politiques et le commerce.    Il est  noter que les colons fran?ais du Canada parlaient (et leurs descendants qubcois parlent encore) le fran?ais, et non un crole de langues rgionales (mlange de breton, normand, venden, etc...), car le fran?ais, dialecte du bassin parisien, s'imposait naturellement comme langue de communication, alors que les langues maternelles taient justement le normand, le breton, le venden, etc...    Aujourd'hui, sur les 9 millions de canadiens francophones, il en existe environ 2 millions qui ne parlent pas exactement fran?ais, mais plut?t un crole franco-anglais (structures grammaticales anglaises + mots fran?ais), au mme titre que les croles antillais (structures grammaticales de langues africaines + mots fran?ais). Les "bons" francophones ont eux-mmes emprunt plusieurs expressions anglaises traduites littralement : "tomber en amour" (to fall in love) pour "tomber amoureux", "prendre une marche" (to take a walk) pour "faire une marche", "bon matin" (good morning) pour "bonjour", "bienvenue" (you're welcome) pour "je vous en prie", etc, etc... Il va sans dire que tous ces emprunts font aujourd'hui partie de la langue fran?aise telle qu'on la parle au Canada (et mme dans quelques communauts aux USA), et que vouloir imposer le fran?ais "standard" tel qu'il est parl  Paris, Lyon ou Bordeaux est une entreprise vaine et prtentieuse.|`|8UQ1Dyeraa	l'accent evolue avec la culture et l'environnement, l'accent canadien d'aujourd'hui n'a rien a voir avec la culture francaise, si ce n'est le fait que la langue a ete introduite dans le territoire par des personnes venant de France. cet accent a connu des mutations qui proviennent des melanges culturels, et de l'identite territoriale qui marque toujours les parlers. C'est exactement les memes raisons pour laquelle l'accent americain est tres different de celui de Londres.

When someone uses lol like this: "have you seen my wallet lol?", he is just trying to make the conversation lighter or less serious. Otherwise it might appear to be confrontational.

RlmkSfiJaa	The only place that can really make me happy is the RSC Courtyard Theatre in Stratford. I'm happpiest just sitting on the Return Tickets bench watching everyone go by and, whether or not I get in, it always cheers me up. I tend to hitchike my way there on a Saturday, take some homework and a bit of money, and just sit. It's nice to be around people that I don't know and that don't know me ... but it's getting to the stage now that everyone there knows who I am ... even some of the actors!

But I can go TO another member of the church... you forget that the church is NOT the building or organization! Church is the body of believers!  Christ does not dwell anywhere else.      So, yes, besides taking everything to the Lord in prayer, I sometimes do call up one of my fellow saints or get together and we talk and share and pray and lift one another up.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	I press the "Cheer" button on my tummy, seriously|`|b660102b2fc9513dd1125d9410450d92aa	Yes, I go to Mass, or Chapel. I also go to Church when I am at home praying, studying, or reflecting on what I have read. For me Church is not only a physical building to house the altar. Church is the scripture,traditions,dogmas, and the magisterium. Church is the entire package of my Catholic Faith.  My definition of Church can be applied in the abstract sense to any religion, teachings, or belief systems. (without the Catholic part of course) |`|iNn9mmOtaa	"Christ is the end of the law (oppression, depression)";  so I have a daily flush of law(dung) to feel perfectly fine.  For it was at churches I got oppressed and depressed,  by their law law: imputing sin and death for the 'hell' of it.

It must be a Puritan Victorian Era hangover.     Zachariah 9:17 (KJV-1611) For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty!

Gl9G8fNTaa	A way to stop overpopulation: opt to adopt. You give a chance to an individual for a better life, and not taking more space by having a new individual.  Marriage should be outlawed? You sound like a teenager saying that in public. People have a choice to get married. Sooner or later people who cheat the system will be caught. Besides, cheating a system is not just in marriage, there's a cheating in every single system, mortgage, bank account, school, etc. Does it mean everything should be outlawed just because some people misusing the system?
AA11703455	All of God's intelligent creatures have free will. (otherwise, any "love" expressed by them would be 'empty' because it would have programmed) and He gave us (angels and humans) the opportunity to develop a relationship as children of His.    One angel deviated from that course, developing a self importance and a desire to be like God, with creatures following him. Unfortunately for us, our parents followed his course.    God could have swatted them like flies (which is why I haven't been given the job). But He saw that he could recover his creation, and not let his original purpose be stopped.     Isaiah 45:18?For this is what Jehovah has said, the Creator of the heavens, He the [true] God, the Former of the earth and the Maker of it, He the One who firmly established it, who did not create it simply for nothing, who formed it even to be inhabited: I am Jehovah, and there is no one else.     So, while we have had to endure this time period, it was for a purpose.     1 John 3:8?He who carries on sin originates with the Devil, because the Devil has been sinning from [the] beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was made manifest, namely, to break up the works of the Devil.    Paul points out the end result for mankind, even though we deal with the futility, that God gave mankind hope for a return to being his children again, what Adam lost for us by his decisions.     Romans 8:18?Consequently I reckon that the sufferings of the present season do not amount to anything in comparison with the glory that is going to be revealed in us. 19?For the eager expectation of the creation is waiting for the revealing of the sons of God. 20?For the creation was subjected to futility, not by its own will but through him that subjected it, on the basis of hope 21?that the creation itself also will be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God. 22?For we know that all creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together until now. 23?Not only that, but we ourselves also who have the firstfruits, namely, the spirit, yes, we ourselves groan within ourselves, while we are earnestly waiting for adoption as sons, the release from our bodies by ransom.     So, the final 2 Chapters of Revelation, after all the humans who have died come back to life and final test for mankind, describes life without any more bad existing, with life everlasting as their future.     Jehovah God will not let his purpose be foiled.    If you would like to listen to a book that features what the Bible really teaches, go the site below and look for the book with that title. You will find chapters that cover these very questions.|`|UiUSsfuYaa	Because he wanted companionship from beings who freely chose to love him.|`|AA10189202	There is no bad without good and no good without bad.|`|iYYdGJV5aa	he is imaginary and most people are ignorant morons|`|r3TYEHMbaa	People make bad things happen.  God doesn't force His will on anyone. Just like He won't force atheists to believe in Him against their wills, He will not force all of the bad things to stop.   God will get rid of evil in His own time.|`|faaPGrsvaa	The whole Noah and his Ark thing was God just about to make man dissapear. He would of had to repent making us.( Say he is sorry and change his ways.) It was on the tip of his tongue and then noah made a boat like god asked him to.

Jesus points this out in Matthew 12's either or:  It's not good + corrupt, but either good or corrupt;  which is to say not grace + law, but grace or law,  which when analyzed is also to say life or death.|`|fOfJz9OMaa	For the trial of our sincerity toward Him.

O pobre homem, n?o escolhe, mas  apenas escolhido, por mais que acredite no contrrio.  O coitado do macho sai carimbando a torto e direito, tentando deixar seus genes imortalizados em alguma fmea, mas como na natureza, o macho nunca saber se a fmea j teve outra cpula, ele continua deseperadamente a sua persegui??o at tentar se imortalizar com um filho seu.

The name sting theory comes from a hypothesis that all energy is composed out of the same material referred to as strings. These stings can be 1-D 2-D 3-D, etc. and can be infinite in length. If this hypothesis proves true then this material has always existed and there is no such thing as nothing. After all, if there was ever nothing than nothing would exist so it's impossible for energy to not exist all throughout time.    Edit: I'm sure you've heard of the famous equation e=mc2. (I don't know how to type superscript) Its basically the best description of gravity we have. It works great but it completely breaks down at the sub-atomic level. So in science when a theory quits working or stops under different situations, you have to start working on a new hypothesis or through your theory out all together. It's been worked on for quite a while now (if I remember right it was the final thing Einstein was working on) but until recently was regarded as to far out there. Never the less some physicists continued to work on it and its slowly gaining momentum.|`|OZ2Ass9iaa	So you need a reason why an unprovable, invisible sky fairy doesn't exist.

I find it interesting that atheists typically claim that it is unreasonable to believe in anything for which there is no observable physical evidence,  even there is no observable physical evidence on which to base the claim that all beliefs should be based on physical evidence.    I think most atheists would be well served by a couple of good courses in Logic.    Peace be with you.|`|IYBTmH26aa	The only thing that bothers me about theories is that they're not certain. Laws no matter what form they come in are certain.     The Laws of Physics are certain and exist throughout the universe as well as on Earth.      Theories, because they are uncertain in nature, are nice, but not practically applicable.  They, too, are not solid proof of things that work.  It's just as silly to cling to a theory than the notion that there is no God.    However, since theories are normally based in scientific reasoning and scientific reasoning has been trustworthy, I see why people tend to cling to it, yet there is still no solid proof of a consistent and certain outcome.    I will accept that you don't believe in God because scientifically He has not been proven to you, but I cannot except that would subscribe to a theory which is just as iffy.     If you choose to believe in a theory because you like it and the sensibilities behind it, then I choose to believe in a God because I like the benefit package He offers better.  It's not the benefit package every Christian seems to subscribe to, but the benefit package that is offered as the Bible subscribes.    His words do make sense on a spiritual level.  They are spiritual laws that work both on Earth, Heaven and the Universe.     Man seems to master scientific, mathematical and physical laws very well, but they seem to do very poorly with spiritual laws.  To prevent one from suffering from bad things, simply don't do them.  Yet, this seems to be a problem for all of human kind.  I wonder why.|`|l3moIem5aa	So you've never eaten food that wasn't cooked?|`|aNycRVC9aa	If you're looking for something less original why are you asking a question that is posted every 5 minutes?

Oh and we don't get bent out of shape when someone tells us we are going to hell.There is no hell and I for one consider it extremely childish when I'm told that.|`|5Smw52iTaa	If the universe was created by a supernatural being, Then who created that supernatural being? You can either assume that something can come into existence without being created, or you have an endless line of creators who were created by an even greater creator. Given these two options, we come to the conclusion, that the universe was not necessarily created by a supreme being. As we today didn't find any physical evidence or even hint to a supernatural creator, and we also know how religious systems and dogmatics work and how religions were invented, it seems most likely that there was no god in the first place.    And about the prophecies:   If you give a great number of different prophecies and make them as vague as possible, it's absolutely likely that some of them might come true.|`|11b70cab8a6a69fef89e99846ac0cc19aa	Well, when you say everything came from God, then you have to answer where God came from.    Can you answer that?    The biggest argument is that why is it more logical for God to exist from nothing than it is for the universe to exist from nothing. I don't have an answer to that myself.    Secondly, getting condemned to a place of eternal punishment is personally offensive. I can't blame them for getting upset or angry, because if someone condemned me to hell for not subscribing to his beliefs with a sadist laugh I'd be upset too.    And about prophecies being fulfilled in Holy books, you have to be more specific as to which Holy book and which prophecies you're talking about. Most of them are in doubt of the authenticity of the Holy books itself.|`|473ccf4ea2cfb964f9c69e3f165455e3aa	I don't profess to know where we came from, or if there's a reason that we're here  These are not things that anybody knows.  I came to my present views by looking at the world and myself without the fuzzy effect of past conditioning.  I was honest with myself, and when I asked myself if I had ever truly felt the presence of God, the answer was no.      and I don't like being told to go to hell by anybody, man!|`|oDxTEqdraa	Prophecies are always acknowledged AFTER the fact, and the interpretation of the so-called prophecy is twisted to fit the foretold with the already-happened. It's all a hoax!    And just because we are puny little humans that can't figure out how the Universe was created (because we don't know ANYTHING about it) and just because we can appreciate beauty and look at the planet as a marvel .... doesn't mean that a god did it!|`|91XGHfSaaa	Okay. Here's my reasoning:    1: there's no evidence for any deity (not just yours)  2: there are thousands of recorded deities; this abundance strongly suggests a mythological basis for all of them  3: there are non-supernatural explanations for everything attributed to a deity  4: because of 3, a deity isn't necessary  5: because of 1 thru 4, I don't believe a deity exists    As for the "prophesies"... scripture tends to be written in such a vague manner that it can be applied any situation.

My biggest reason for not believing is that I don't need to have an answer for everything I can't explain.  I fully believe that's why people invented Gods in the first place.    For me, if science can't answer it now, eventually it will be answered and I'm perfectly fine postulating an answer without having to devote myself to some God that is supposedly bothering to watch my every move in order to judge me at some later date.    I live for the now, in the now, with the golden rule in my heart and compassion for my fellow man.  I don't need a God to help me do right by others or fill in my knowledge gaps.  My heart is full with my anti-theologic family, my children are well behaved and loved, and if that means I go to hell, why would I want your God in the first place?|`|MttoGF3Aaa	The best answer that anyone of faith can give you is that atheists have no faith.  That is what suggests to them, that there is nothing more than meets the eye, their lack of faith.    To an atheist, he (or humanity) is the supreme power.  If he can't explain something, it is because he (or humanity) has not yet reached that "level".    But of course Men of Faith understand that the only way humans reach any level at all, is only by the Will of the God; the Supremest of the Supreme.|`|AA11955963	Everything resides in Belief.

We search for the answers, the truth.  We may never know it all,  but we believe that objective inquary to the truth will give us answers if we stick to the facts.  we do not believe that you should focus energy on something of which is not testable or knowable in any way like the idea of god.  If we give god footing in our minds then it should also be fair and practical to also give believe to zeus, thor, ghosts, aliens, fairies, the teapot orbiting the moon, and any other infinite amount of things that "could" be true but we otherwise have no other proof.  That would be incredibly exuasting wouldn't it?|`|bbb941465ccc4a1ec3a57d5ff0a4b17baa	You're looking at everything backwards.  What evidence do you have that any god exists, and then why do you think he's your specific god rather than any of the thousands of other gods that humanity has invented throughout history?  First you have to prove god before you can say that he created so much as an atom, you can't start at the universe and work backwards.  I don't believe in a god because there is no evidence for any god, so, simply put, there is no good reason to believe that any god exists.|`|iFyCfwlPaa	"I can't believe in something I can't see.."  The mere fact that one can see should speak volumes to people.  Even Darwin wrote that complexities of the eye and the ability to see was something his atheist beliefs could not explain.  The things that we see is what the creator has made.  The earth, the planets, the universe and all of creation.  When you see a picture hanging on the wall, in most cases, you can't see, hear or speak to the person who drew it.  Most people would  believe that there was an artist who drew the picture.  Very few people would believe that the drawing was made by an accident.  But most people would believe that there was an artist who created the drawing.  How can anyone deny creation itself?

Since this is its largest potential source of converts, Iglesia relies on anti-Catholic scare tactics as support for its own doctrines, which cannot withstand biblical scrutiny.

Indeed, I hope they are misguided and not liars.    In any case, they are not correct about this core Catholic belief.    I pray for their well-being.  I pray for their salvation.  It is often for people such as this that I find myself reflecting on the Church's teachings on culpability with respect to wrongful actions.  I truly hope that this group is genuinely mistaken and not obstinately defiant.  I also pray that they come to know and accept the Truth.    Thank you for a great question that led me to learn something about which I previously knew nothing.    Peace be with you.|`|lj9FXex8aa	Because of this: Sacrilege - Smashing holy images; One record of their Sacrilege tells that during the annual Black Nazarene feast in Quiapo, Manila, The original image paraded on a street where a local INC church stands, A one member of the INC, saw the image at the front of their church, As a non-idolater, he shoots the head of the original Nazarene image, leaving a bullet mark on the right cheek of the image, The bullet mark can be seen even today. Apostasy - If INC considers the RC church to be a Apostate church, The RC considers INC the REAL apostates, because according to a version on the bible, Jesus told Peter that he on this rock he will establish his Church. The bible says: "His church" not "HIS CHURCHES", For INC rejects the Catholic teachings. Apostacy is one of the three sins against the Roman Catholic church, And these sins are from the devil whose plan is to destroy the unity of the Church. False witnesses - Felix Manalo claimed that INC is the restoration of the true Christ church, However, He restored nothing, he didn't restored the priesthood and the missing doctrines and his claim that he is God's messenger is only himself. He is a false prophet, Christ and all of his apostles didn't ordained him. One also says that Felix Manalo is addicted to women, Saying that he's also a sinner.     GOD BLESS YOU.

Many of the earliest Christians knew Jesus before and after He was crucified.  Some of them wrote down what they knew about Jesus.  Most of the New testament was written within a few years or decades of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.  Many of the earliest Christians were tortured and even crucified for teaching what they knew about Jesus.  They accepted torture and death rather than deny what they knew to be the Truth.  The new testament tells about such things extensively.    You asked "Where are the miracles?"  Read the Bible.  Many miracles are recorded there.  Remember as you read The Bible that many people who personally knew Jesus on Earth died for their beliefs.    They did so because they knew some very important Truth about God, and they would rather be killed by mortal men than have to face God in eternity and stand in judgment as liars who denied knowing Jesus was God even when they had first-hand knowledge that Jesus was in fact God.

Lu:16:19: There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:  Lu:16:20: And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,  Lu:16:21: And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.  Lu:16:22: And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;  Lu:16:23: And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.  Lu:16:24: And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.  Lu:16:25: But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.    Lu:6:20: And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.  Lu:6:21: Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.  Lu:6:22: Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.  Lu:6:23: Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.

Many goths wear black, though it's not a strict dress code. Purples, dark blues, greens, and reds often make it into the typical goth wardrobe. Despair is often a common mood; for some these feelings are genuine, while others utilize the emotion for theatrics. Despite this, there are many cheerful goths as well (occasionally referred to as perky goffs)    Gothic rock itself typically utilizes jangly guitars with light to moderate distortion, vocals which range from deep mournful dirges, to clean melodic mid-ranges, to high pitched energetic cries, a prominent bass, in some instances a keyboard (often an organ, saw wave, or strings patch) and tribal, rock, or occasionally electronic style drumming. The music itself is often composed, and performed in minor scales. It is not a form of metal, it is not a form of industrial (though industrial elements occasionally make their way into gothic music, and vice versa).    Marlyn Manson is NOT gothic rock. If you'd like to know what goth music actually sounds like, Bauhaus ("In the Flat Field" or "Mask") , The Sisters of Mercy ( "First and Last and Always" or "Floodlands"), and Xmal Deutschland ( "Fetisch" or "Tocsin") would be a good place to start.|`|DHzwr1braa	Go to hell|`|zlQo7WMoaa	They follow goth subculture, I think.|`|dKi2R2oHaa	Yep.  You are allowed some purple, red or grungy green amongst the black if you want.      It is mostly young girls "rebelling" by conforming to a pretty unimaginative subculture. Black clothes seem to be compulsary, died hair, silver coloured jewelry etc is common.    Music tastes vary amongst Goths, but it tends to all be downbeat.    Anthropologist Ted Polhemus describes Goth fashion as    "A profusion of black velvets, lace, fishnets and leather tinged with scarlet or purple, accessorized with tightly laced corsets, gloves, precarious stilettos and silver jewelry depicting religious or occult themes"    Goths are rejecting modern culture in a passive way.  It seems to me though that they don't need to be so restrictive and negative in their behaviour.  Having been to some Goth party's I wonder why they bother.  The Hippie and punk movement's  were liberating, the Goth's I find are a little sad.     One advantage Goth culture does have is that you don't need to be wealthy or attractive to fit in easily.      Goth fashion does seem to be getting more glam, which suggests that the sub-culture is evolving into something else.      http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/northeast...    ===================    Noddy Holder shows how you can dress like a Goth and still have a good time in the classic film Slade film "Flame".    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12zNUvgYr...    and the less talented but equally upbeat Screaming Lord Sutch, with a totally tasteless song ...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY1NDujmx...|`|GKJEgidzaa	Most Goths are actually just as scummy as Chavs...

82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	You need to address it with your mom. She wouldn't go over to a friend's house and do that would she? Say something like, "Hey Mom, we understand if you get hungry or thirsty but we'd rather you tell us instead of just helping yourself. Sometimes we have food or drinks in there that are for special occasions."    For those who are saying that you didn't have to ask when you were growing up...you LIVED there, therefore you didn't have to ask. If she LIVED with you, it would be a different story. But since you live in separate houses and lead separate lives, it's common courtesy for her to ask to look through your fridge. If she's looking through your fridge, soon she's going to look through kitchen cabinets, then bathroom cabinets, and where does it stop? Is she going to start going through your bedside table? Your underwear drawer?|`|V0287T2Vaa	I'd say, "sit, sit, let me get you something!" and lead her consistently to the kitchen table.  If she doesn't get the hint after a few times you'll have to be honest with her.  If it bothers your husband it's an issue that needs addressing, and she needs to have respect for his feelings.  All families have their own dynamics and I am 50 and don't go into my parent's pantry or fridge without saying "I'm getting a few cookies ok?" so it's not fair to say "she's your mom so it's ok" if maybe his family is different.|`|QIQNzE11aa	Next time walk into the kitchen with her. Smile when she is looking through everything and ask her very nicely, maybe with a hint of a laugh in your voice.. Are you done snooping yet? Is there anything you'd like or i can get you? Then smile at her. She'll get the message.     It is odd she goes through every cabinet and fridge. She may be concerned you don't have enough food in the house. Which is probably why your husband is annoyed. He probably takes it that she's looking to see if he is providing enough.     If you wanted, you could do something totally funny. Like stick a box of condoms and your diaphram into one of the known cabinets. Or get some pornography. Smile and tell her that you just wanted to make it interesting when she was looking. She'd get the hint there as well.     Or do what someone did to my grandma. They put marbles in the medicine cabinet when the church group met. When grandma went in to snoop (she says to look for a q-tip for her make up) the marbles all came crashing down. Leaving grandma embarassed and never wanting to open up someone else's stuff again.    I'm more laid back like you and don't care much if someone helps themselves in my home. Though, this has backfired on me as one friend's kid thought she could run into my bedroom into my night stand to get my stress ball to play with. I made the mistake of saying, it's in my bedroom i'll get it in a moment and then not watching her. Well, she found stuff i'd rather not think about. UGH. hahahaha!     You can also just go over and visit you rmother and have a heart to hert with her. This is how i think you should truly handle it. Tell her that neither of you love that she goes through your cupboards. Don't put it on your husband or it will be her against him... and that would be harder to deal with. I'd make it a we thing. Tell her you don't mind her getting a drink or something, but you feel invaded when she goes through all your cabinets and fridge like that. Ask her if there is a purpose and listen to it. Then just go back to saying that you wish she wouldn't do so. Yes, she is your mom. But many things she had were off limits to you when you were a child. Her mom probably wasn't coming to her house and rummaging through her pantry. That you woudl happily feed your mother if she asked, would be sufficient pay back for her raising and feeding you. Her going through your stuff isn't right. As for your husband, tell him you completely understand what he's saying and are working on it. Tell him to give you time to work it out, tell him it will take a month or two after the talk to truly get it through to her. But stay on top of it and work through it nicely with both of them.     Best of luck!|`|7dGpL4mSaa	In my opinion, she is your mom, and I think it's fine if she eats without asking. When you were a child, did she ever tell you to ask before eating?|`|VMY7No0eaa	She is checking ... not hungry.  I would ask her "MOM please ask and we will get you something"   At least she isn't checking your bedside table or videos for porn!|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	it's your mother. he needs to deal with it.|`|jz9CnL2Eaa	Next time she is over, beat her to the punch as soon as she gets there.  "Mom, can I offer you anything to eat or drink?"  If she says yes, serve her, if she says no, let it go.  Should she wander into the kitchen, I'd confront her.  "Mom, what are you looking for?"  Ask her to please stop rummaging.      Yes, she fed you for many years.  That was her job as your mom.  It doesn't give her carte blanche to rummage through your cupboards or your fridge now, especially if your husband, whom she didn't raise, and whose food it also is, is irritated by it.    Your first responsibility is to him.    Period.  It's that leave and cleave thing.  Treat your mom with respect, but respectfully put her in her place, which is, a guest in your home who is not entitled to snoop through things that do not belong to her.  (By the way, the same thing is now true for you in her house.  You are no longer her responsibility and are a guest in her home as well.)|`|pN0EOoepaa	Stop being so stingy; this is your mother. I wouldnt say a thing to my mom but I would tell my husband "deal with it this my mom".|`|EjyD1sXeaa	cherish her while you have her  I think it's quite sweet, she feels at home and comfortable just like you did growing up in her house.|`|lKsgF8bOaa	You and your husband just need to deal with it.  She's your mom, not a stranger.  I don't think she made you ask for food when you were living with her, did she?  I think her actions show that she is comfortable with you as her daughter and that she does not draw lines (which is a healthy thing between mother-and-daughter). It's a beautiful thing, don't ruin it.|`|5vO61nuvaa	I don't really see why this is such a big deal. She's your mom.. if she is hungry she should be able to raid your fridge. If it was his mom would there be such a big fuss over it??? I mean really, to stir something up over her looking into your fridge is just ridiculous.|`|RF52FRdyaa	I really don't understand why it frustrates you, unless you and your mother aren't that close.  If that's the case, then I guess it makes sense to treat her like she's company. If you grew up with her all your life, and you have a loving relationship, then its only natural that she feels comfortable to raid your fridge. She's your mother! Do you ask for a drink of water when you go to her house?|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	she's your mother and fed you without condition or frustration when you were young.  how in god's name do you have a problem with this?  what kind of husband do you have that he has a problem with this?  who cares if your mother comes and goes through your fridge for food.  wow, you and your husband sound snooty and selfish.  glad i'm not related to either of you.|`|AA11601031	Man, you two are pretty finicky.  She's your mom, for God's sakes.

I don't know the answer.  I would go by how often she does it.  If she really has no food at her home and works then she should take care of getting food for herself.  Maybe you could go grocery shopping with her or help her plan a budget.   However if she is like my mother, who chooses to eat out all the time, then that may be the problem.  She might have to budget better or get some assistance.

There were 4 more guys in the picture, and three girls, then one said she was lesbian, and in the next picture she was holding hands with another girl, which leaves only one straight girl.... In the same picture, there are two guys holding hands (which I suppose is Sir Rupert and one of the other 4 guys), which leaves only 3 guys for one straight girl, unless she just ran out of girls to chose from and threesomes are not allowed in the town. Lets suppose she is straight and she has a kid with one of the guys, that kid will grow in that mostly homosexual environment and have a 50/50 chance of liking the opposite sex, which leaves the town in serious danger.

SCkhQc2Caa	Its one of his Companion.  _________________________    The Quraan states that Eesa (peace be upon him) was not crucified or killed, and that he was lifted up to heaven.     There is no text of the Revelation that tells us the details of what happened on the day when that was made to appear to the Jews, but there is a saheeh report from Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messiah (peace be upon him) said to those of his companions who were with him in the house: Which of you will be made to look like me and be killed in my stead, and he will be with me in the same level as me (in Paradise)? A young man who was one of the youngest of them stood up, and he said to him: Sit down.     Then he repeated it and that young man stood up again, and he said: Sit down. Then he repeated it again and that young man stood up and said, I (will do it). He said: You are the one. So he was caused to look like Eesa and Eesa was lifted up from a window in the house to heaven.     Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer (4/337), commenting on this report: This is a saheeh isnaad going back to Ibn Abbaas. Similarly it was narrated from more than one of the salaf that he said to them: Which of you will be made to look like me and be killed in my stead, and he will be my companion in Paradise? End quote.     Then he (may Allaah have mercy on him) said (4/341): Ibn Jareer favoured the view that all of his companions were made to look like Eesa. End quote. This was mentioned in a report narrated from Wahb ibn Munabbih which was narrated by Ibn Jareer (may Allaah have mercy on him) and quoted by Ibn Katheer (4/337), in which it states that when they surrounded Eesa and his companions and entered upon them, Allaah made them all appear in the form of Eesa and they said to them, You have bewitched us; send forth to us Eesa or we will kill you all, until they sent forth one of their number after Eesa promised Paradise to him, and they took him and crucified him.     But Ibn Katheer said after that: This is a very strange story.     He also (may Allaah have mercy on him) said (4/341): Some of the Christians claim that Judas Iscariot  who is the one who led the Jews to Eesa  is the one who was made to look like Eesa so they crucified him, and he said: I am not the one you want, I am the one who led you to him. Allaah knows best what really happened.     With that, Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) concluded his discussion of this topic: Allaah knows best what really happened.   ____________________|`|UxYkISitaa	he had a name starting from the letter J, according to the gospel of barnabas i dont remember the name  sorry.  salam alaikum|`|7JnzGOkhaa	Funny you ask this question but some Muslims I know deny that the crucifixion ever took place.|`|tfkpNh89aa	His Name is Jesus and His Body was Resurrected onto Heaven on the third day of His Crucifixion.|`|AA10589890	There was no other.

At this point, just as the collective personality of Christianity will kill the fearsome collective personality of irreligion with the sword of heavenly Revelation, so too, representing the collective personality of Christianity, Jesus (Upon whom be peace) will kill the Dajjal, who represents the collective personality of irreligion, that is, he will kill atheistic thought.    http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2932&...|`|7Bj4AAo8aa	Jesus(pbuh) was put on the cross but he did not die on it.

If you really want to know where the Quranic story comes from, I recommend that you read the gnostic gospels.  They are frighteningly similar.    These gospels were written between 100 and 200 years after the death of Christ by people who possibly couldn't have been living at the time of the crucifixion.    The gospel of Barnabas is not a gospel at all.  These writings are dated to the 16th century and were first written in Italian and Spanish.    The gospel of Judas' original Coptic text has been carbon-dated to the late 3rd century.     Try these books:    The Gnostic Gospels by Elaine Pagels  Lost Scriptures by Bart D.

Very unlikely ---------------The Punisher (Frank Castle) is a fictional comic book character, an antihero in Marvel Comics' main shared universe. Created by writer Gerry Conway and artists John Romita, Sr. and Ross Andru, the character first appears in The Amazing Spider-Man  129 (February 1974).    The Punisher is a vigilante who considers killing, kidnapping, extortion, coercion, threats of violence and torture to be acceptable crime-fighting tactics. Driven by the deaths of his family, who were killed by the mob when they witnessed a gangland execution in New York City's Central Park, the Punisher wages a one-man war on the mob and all criminals in general by using all manner of weaponry.[1] His family's killers were the first to be slain.[2] A war veteran, Castle is a master of martial arts, stealth tactics, and a wide variety of weapons.    The Punisher's brutal nature and willingness to kill made him a novel character in mainstream American comic books in 1974. By the late 1980s, he was part of a wave of psychologically troubled antiheroes and was featured in several monthly publications, including The Punisher War Journal, The Punisher War Zone, and The Punisher Armory. Several movie adaptations have been released, one in 1989, which features Dolph Lundgren as the Punisher, another in 2004, with the character played by Thomas Jane and a third in 2008 with Ray Stevenson as the character.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punisher|`|PeuFnqQwaa	When you are born again, you shall be in a different form...insect, reptile other mammal, tree, virus etc.

Who is "they"?     2. The concept of abiogenesis expanded a great deal as mankinds understanding of science has grown, but all forms of abiogenesis have one thing in common: they are all scientifically unsupportable. There have been no experiments demonstrating abiogenesis in action. It has never been observed in a natural or artificial environment. Conditions believed to have existed on earth are either incapable of producing the building blocks needed, or self-contradictory. No evidence has been found suggesting where or when such life might have generated. In fact, everything we know of science today seems to indicate that abiogenesis could not have happened under any naturally possible conditions.    3. Genesis; this is the English translation to the Hebrew words "In the beginning..."   "???????????," translated "B'reshit".    4. Hope this helps.

Something always comes from something else. But where did the first "something" come from? Since "something" can't come from "nothing", then the first "something" had to come from a source that doesn't have a life span: God.    It's only logic.    By the way, abiogenesis is now a discredited theory which suggested that living organisms can arise spontaneously from inanimate matter.  Now lets assume that abiogenesis is real and living organisms can come from inanimate matter. Where did the inanimate matter come from? Since inanimate matter also has a LIFE SPAN, and this "something" can't come from "nothing", then the first "something" had to come from a source that doesn't have a life span: God.    Its logical and scientific.

ZSznCJhSaa	The American equivilant to Jorge is George, in that way your mother is right. Just like Francios is Francis from French to American.    However, his name is Jorge... that is what is on his birth certificate and that is what he answers to and what he wants to be called. Its ethnocentric to force the American version of the name on him.     Its like, for example with my friends name. Telling him his name has to be George because he is in the US is just like telling my friends whose name is Lisi and pronounces it Lee C that you refuse to call her by her name but instead insist on calling her Lih see.     His name is Jorge, you are right.|`|AA11447210	It is appropriate to pronouce a person's name the way it's done in their country of origin. The American version of Jorge is George, but that doesn't mean it's appropriate to call a person with that name George, nor would I answer to George if my name was Jorge.|`|YupMCYHlaa	We have many people in the US with foreign names. George is the English version of Jorge, so you might change your name to George to sound more American, or you might keep the name Jorge to sound more Hispanic.  I live in California where there are many Hispanic and Spanish-speaking people, and I know people called Juan (not John), Jose (not Joe or Joseph), etc.  And others that have taken the English equivalent of their names.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Most people keep the pronunciation of their names the same, no matter where they live, unless the people where they are going to would have lots of trouble pronouncing it, and they might come up with an easier-to-say version for those people's use, while keeping the original pronunciation with friends and family, for instance.  The name doesn't change "automatically" simply because there happens to be a direct-translation-version.  There are lots of Jesus' here in the USA and they are all called "hey-soos"  So, much as I don't like to cross another adult, I'd say your mother is totally wrong.|`|9dd2ac44728dd565acf459d4a4e730d0aa	Many people change the pronunciation of their names when they are abroad, especially when they are names which can be translated into a local form, such as Jorge. It's likely that such a person would be called Jorge for official purposes but George by friends and colleagues.    A lot of the names in the New Testament are Greek versions of the actual Hebrew names of the people concerned. The name Jesus, for example, is actually Yeshua in Hebrew and Aramaic.|`|76sNllS0aa	Your name won't change just because you moved somewhere else.

SqPVrEaCaa	The holiday, which began as a Pennsylvania German custom in southeastern and central Pennsylvania in the 18th and 19th centuries, has its origins in ancient European weather lore, wherein a badger or sacred bear is the prognosticator as opposed to a groundhog. The holiday also bears some similarities to the medieval Catholic holiday of Candlemas It also bears similarities to the Pagan festival of Imbolc, the seasonal turning point of the Celtic year, which is celebrated on February 1 and also involves weather prognostication.    i think they just like a party!  no idea why

She has blonde corkscrew curls and blue-green eyes.     As for me, I am a good five or six inches shorter than her, with the very curvy, Renaissance body. I have hair color that changes by the month, very, very dark brown eyes, and smaller, more delicate features. We are the same ethnic group, though.     We work, despite being so radically different physically, I think, because she can overwhelm me by being bigger than my, but my personality is bigger than hers. So in this case it is the balance of difference that works, not the common resemblance.     As for personality, which seems to commonly be what attracts someone to another, I think that this theory might have more basis there. I think most people take what they like in themselves and look for someone who compliments it, then sees what they don't like in themselves and looks for the opposite.     For example, my girlfriend is more quiet and cautious, but likes that I am more outgoing and a go-for-it type person. Whereas I have the life skills of a three year old and like that she can be responsible, cares about the little things, and is more stable and reliable than me. But we do have a similar intellect, as we are both very intelligent and can talk about lots of things, and a wicked, sarcastic sense of humor that we both enjoy.|`|36b213c16926132fde2d00722cbf60d3aa	The thing that attracted me to her was the personality she has behind that beautiful smile.|`|ostvx6Myaa	for me yeah there does have to be some similarity maybe not in  physique or eye color, but what im into and music what i like to do im a "butch" woman if you want to stereotype and i like butch women|`|714a3c260d916f907af43aeeb3d020f3aa	My shiny hair, and my beautiful bottom, with a gorgeous wide smile, I'm sure none can survive in 5 minutes. Hahaha!|`|X74UF72Daa	hmm...this question has me thinking back    NONE of my partners were physically similar to me.  I'm small...somewhat muscular with dreds and I'm mostly attracted to bigger women...so it seems.    but what attracted me to my partner was her personality. we were just friends for a while first.  she would bring up things about me in conversation that even I forgot that I told her.... :) I like that she listens|`|sLaoidXqaa	That totally dont apply to me and my girlfriend. I have brown hair and eyes and dont wear femme femme clothes, my girlfriend on the other hand is blonde with green eyes is extremely feminine.|`|ezNSyvqeaa	I think it totally depends on the person!  I am very tall, quite thin/athletic, have light hair and a very fair complexion and I tend to be a bit on the androgynous side.  I am generally attracted to feminine girls who are short with dark hair and curves.     When it comes to intelligence tho I look for someone with a similar intelligence level.  I like to be mentally stimulated in a relationship so I wouldnt want to be with someone stupid, but I also wouldnt want to look stupid compared to them.  I think that it is more important to have similarities when it comes to values and goals - the internal stuff, rather than physical appearance.|`|kjWqxBPXaa	I meet my partner on a photo shoot and he spilled a coffee on me !!! That was three years ago and we have been together ever since. I was attracted to Adam ( My Boyfreind). His good body looks smile personality and kindness and his manners. xxsamxx|`|PeQ40WcWaa	The thing that first attracted me to my partner was the way she appeared quite private yet to-the-point.... then a few days later, I saw her laughing with a colleague and both of these things combined intrigued me and made me want to find out about her! There was something very magnetic about her.    Looks-wise... I suppose she is similar to me in a way! She is petite, a bit thinner than me, we both have brown hair and blue eyes. Intelligence-wise... we are a little different.    I think that to be honest, attraction initially comes from things other than similarities. I think it comes from random, unpredictable chemistry - not necessarily similarities. I have been attracted to women of all different shapes and sizes, blonde hair, red hair, pink hair, brown hair, black hair... I love them all ;-)    But it may be true that for anything *long term*, people tend to stay with partners who have similar attributes and backgrounds.|`|QWMPWia4aa	He was physically very cute and had a sweet smile and that attracted me to him physically and he was very sweet and shy and funny and treated me with respect and kindness.  That's what hooked me.|`|03f6d70aa511193e6f0a3fd450df20e2aa	The fact of how...  Fast we clicked  we have a lot of things in common|`|N73oZyY8aa	Oh yes.

What attracted me to her was her personality she's so kind & loving, funny & cute    Xx|`|nisfxpXHaa	Everything, she is the complete package. Attractive, intelligent, humorous, compassionate, family oriented, ethical.    I am 4" taller than her, curvier than her, not nearly as intelligent as her, blonder than her, blue eyed compared to her brown. I don't think this theory works at all.    Personality is the thing that keeps most people together.      L

The original intent was to prevent a situation as you have in England, where the Church of England is the established church. At the time the Bill of Rights was passed, other churches had few or no rights to practice in England.    There was never an intent by the Founders to prevent any expression of religion in connection with government. The intent was to ensure that all religions were treated equally by the state and that the state did not favor any one religion above others. The Bill of Rights is a list of limits on the power of the state, not a list of rights allowed by the state.

TQW5E6olaa	I hear you. What about fast food though? Like McDonalds? Do I have to tip them? Because many drive-through's ask for it now too....|`|QIQNzE11aa	first and foremost, you've been fed a line by the industry and seem to have falled for it. The companies would not have to double their prices for everyone to make enough money.     Next, many places do pay minimum wage, which is now at 7.15 an hour for those who work in the to go area. At minimum wage, it's almost expected that they will not be receiving tips. government and job wise that is, not clientelle wise.     Yes, most would rather go in and pay one particular price and never have to deal with tipping again. It would not be such a bad thing. Go in and pay 15 dollars for a meal and no tip would be comfortable for most.     Most people who say they can't spend much on a tip are really not enjoying the quality of the servers. I tip accordingly to what my server has worked for. A great server can expect up to 20% tip from me. A bad one, down as low as a 5% tip from me and a comment on how to better their skills or possibly a comment to the management that they need to be retrained.     I worked in the food industry for many years. Doing line work while becoming a chef. I've waitressed as well. I never once let someone sit around waiting and wishing for a drink, no matter how slammed i was. I took the time and spent the energy managing all my customers. I tended to make far more than the other waitresses who didn't bother as much. Now and then i'd help them and people would pull me aside and tip me saying i did more than their own waitress.     Now, going curb side shouldn't be tip worthy. It's ridiculous to expect me to pay a tip for work you are not doing. You should be making the minimum wage, or more, and many families live on that. People who have no chance of getting tips from anyone, like food stockers, cashiers and many others. I do not expect a tip to answer my business line and write down someone's order. I receive no tips what so ever. It's my job.     It's another form of blackmail on the part of these restaraunts. To pay the employee's what they should be paying instead of them making so much money while the employee's starve. They might not make 60 million in a year and own 11 houses and a yacht worth more than you or i will make in a life time. They might have to step down to only earning around 36 mill a year... how hard would that be on them?     You are yelling at the wrong people.|`|AA10067344	I think a lot of people don't tip on to go because they were not provided with a service.    I've worked in restaurants and I've always though to go people should be paid more.  Most customers just don't see anything that merits a tip.|`|Q06InngZaa	First off, I do have a problem paying $25 for a DVD. I refuse to do. Second, I do have a problem with tipping, yet most of the time I do at least 15%. The only problem I dont have a problem tipping is my bartender....lol. If your making 2.13 and hour your living in the wrong state. Yeah,  I think if you are gonna complain about it, then maybe you should find another job. There are plenty of people who have no job and would be willing to do yours with just an hourly wage.|`|dCewrtXaaa	I hope you are a member or leader of a union like UNITE HERE. You are very articulate and explain the situation very well. I feel as though if people are going to eat out, they should be prepared to tip at least 15%. If they can't afford to, they can't afford to eat out. Otherwise they are forcing the server to absorb the cost of a portion of their meal. That isn't fair.|`|Ao3Fl3iSaa	I have no problem on tipping, when I'm sitting down and receiving good service.  What I don't understand is why I should tip on a to-go order.  I place the order over the phone, drive to the restaurant, pick it up, go back home, eat it at home.  Why am I suppose to tip in that situation? Where's the service?|`|rThIVk2maa	I hate the tipping system. It makes incomes of servers unstable and and dependent upon the fairness of a public that is not always fair. It causes worry about how much to tip to good customers, allows rude customers to get away without paying service fees and places an unfair burden upon its patrons and staff alike.    But until restaurants stop using such practices and actually pay their employees and charge customers a flat rate for a service fee, there's little we can do about it.     My rule is, I tip when I am served. I don't use carryout service, and don't tip when I am merely handed a bag. If that is unfair to the bartender or whoever, that person needs to take it up with management and devise a better way of getting carryout orders to the bar.     At alll the places I worked, everybody just picked them up in the kitchen and took them up as they became available.|`|YCnDnHh5aa	I tip some on to go orders, but not near as much for full service sitting in the restaurant.  I am  also not holding up a table when I get it to go.      I appreciate servers.    But remember times are hard right now and some people don't realize that servers need tips to make a living.|`|lKsgF8bOaa	I do not agree with your argument. If people stopped tipping, and servers went ahead and found new jobs; restaurants will be forced to raise the pay of the servers. Then this whole corrupt tipping system will be put to an end.    I do tip, usually 20% regardless of the quality of service (unless it was too horrible to get over). So I do not want you to think that I am cheap or that I'm one of those who would not tip you if you were my server.    However, I am totally against tipping. When you buy something or go to a restaurant; the service should be included in the bill. For example, if you buy a cake from a bakery, the calculate the cost of the ingredients, the cost of the electricity, the rent of the place, and the cost of the baker - and then they sell the cake for you with a price reasonable for them to cover all their bills and pay the baker a decent salary. This should apply to restaurants too. It's really not the costumers' fault that the restaurant is underpaying the servers. It's the restaurants' problem and I do not see why a place like Applebee's (which makes millions and trillions more than me) gets to make crazy profits while I have to pay for the compensation of its workers. It's just morally unfair and wrong.    From a customers point of view, Id rather pay $10 for a $8 dish then go home thinking did I tip that waiter enough to pay his bills this month. Its not something comfortable at all for a customer like myself, even though as I mentioned earlier, I usually tip at least 20%.|`|4ESlizXraa	How often do you actually get stiffed on a tip?  When I was a waitress I rarely got nothing as a tip and sometimes I got what I considered a bad tip, but the vast majority of the time I got about what I expected or more.    I think two things are at play here.  First, wait staff expect more for a tip now than they use to.  Not dollar wise, but percentage wise.  20%?  Standard?  A lot of people don't agree with that so you're setting yourself up for disappointment with that one.  Its far from widely accepted in most places.    Second, people focus on the negative.  So if someone gives you a $10 tip on a $20 dollar meal you tend to think you deserved that where if you get $1 on the same meal you feel slighted and remember that more.    Tipping is one of the downfalls of being a waitress.  You smile and be friendly even if you feel bad.  You hustle even when you're tired and it seems like a personal affront when someone gives you no recognition for that, but its not like it was a suprise that you would be making the majority of your pay from tips and tipping is subjective.    I think some wait staff shoot themselves in the foot with this whole "omg we're underappreciated" thing.  It comes across as some kind of entitlement attitude and that rubs people the wrong way.    Anyway, there's been a flurry of questions about this lately and I just think its obvious that people have widely held and widely dissimilar opinions and those opinions aren't going to change very easily.|`|AA11788494	I agree with Grace.  Plus to add, I will never tip on a to go order.  I hardly ever get food to go but I think that would be one of the perks of carry out.  The American system just isn't right and everyone agrees but does nothing to change it.|`|mnEkv7xdaa	It's the restaurant's job to pay their staff, not mine. If I am SERVED a meal at my table, I will tip very well, even with average service. I refuse to pay part of an employee's wage for an order I am picking up myself, for a meal I will take home and serve myself and my family. Unless these "regular servers" plan on following me home, plating up my dish, and periodically asking me if I need a refill, they don't get jack from me.     I don't expect people to make a living off of $3 an hour; but frankly, they are employed, and I'm sure they are making more money when they are serving tables and not packing to-go orders. Until something changes and minimum raise goes up, I see no reason why servers shouldn't have to either cut back on buying THEIR $25 dvds or get a 2nd job. I had to when I was younger and had a peanut-paying job. And I didn't cry about not being tipped for shoving a box at someone over the counter.
UpIjgNV5aa	Unity another question . . . there can be no unity unless we respect each other and there is complete tolerance of others views . . . and it's not just Shias. Of course disrespect of any Sahaba(R) will not be tolerated neither will imposition or intolerance.     Now Hassan(R), first "Their"???? . . . so you have NO respect for our beloved Prophet(PBUH) Grandson? That said Hassan(R) didn't pledge allegiance may try reading history I know it must be difficult but give it a shot. Prophet(PBUH) had predicted Hassan(R) would bring two sides together for unity. So it was exactly that for the sake of unity accepted Muawiya's call for talks.    Muawiya was the same person who took arms against Ali(R), caused Fitna and Broke the Caliphate . . replacing it with Totalitarian Monarchy. Hassan(R) didn't pledge any allegiance simply for the sake of unity agreed, with VERY STRICT conditions, which in turn Muawiya will break MOST of them. You do know even the closest Sahaba(R) of our beloved Prophet(PBUH) had a dislike for Muawiya. Not to mention his enmity of Ali(R) was well known even after Ali(R) were martyred.     Unity does not come from few feel good slogans, if we had been adhering to heart and soul of Islam there would've been NO NEED for call to Unity!!|`|3E2EQH12aa	agreed with ninety9    people had stopped with that mess for like 1 whole day, but theres always someone to ruin it. wallah im so sick of hearing about it all just shut up|`|sE94HgDBaa	I am anti unity when it comes to religion.|`|xTRMSm7yaa	it was going fine until u started filling up the page with "why shias do this? why shias do that? why shias lie? why shias cheat?"    everything is the Shias fault, and everyone else is innocent and defending themselves...

Now of course none of them have done it directly out of fear of distancing the sunni from themselves.    Now i would like everyone to see how the shia (esp this user, KTP) is a clear enemy of the sahabah. Here is a response i wrote to KTP about his comment to a user called blossom:    Okay now take note of the above shia answers edit to blossom:    "@ Blossom  Ohh thats why you are following omar instead of Prophet Muhammad"    1. So he belittles Umar (ra) and then tomorrow they will ask when did we ever belittle them    2. NOTE how a shia will NEVER forget to write "A.S" after the name of Ali (ra), but for the prophet Muhammed (saw) they write nothing.    3. NOTE how he does not do dua for Umar (Ra) by not putting down RA. And then they will say, we dont hate him, yet they will not even do dua for him.  _________  Now read the response of KTP to my above response. Please note that in the above response of mine i wrote UMAR (ra) no other sahabee was mentioned. Now to ALLLL sunnis Umar (ra) was a noble companion of the prophet Muhammed (saw) and he is one who we say about "May Allah (swt) be please with him" i.e. RA. Now lets see what this shia user, KTP, has to say about Umar (ra). REMEMBER i did not mention ANY other sahabee in the above response of mine. Therefore, KTP, DIRECTLY attacked Umar (ra). Below is KTPs response:    "@Noub  Im Personally Instate Of War with whom they were with Ahlibayt and Martyerd his daughter"    And Friend With their friend    And till my last breath i will Write and i will say    Muhammad (saww)  Ali (as)  Fatima (sa)  Hassan (as)  Hussain (as) .....................    and i will put (ra) only For salman Al farsi ,, Abu dar al ghafari  ,,ammar e yasir ,, malik ashter (ra)  _________________________    So as we can see from the initial answer of KTP he slandered the sahabah and on top of that insisted on taking part in gheebah and nameemah (slander and spreading of false tales) and on top of that he said that he is in a state of war with the sahabah of the prophet Muhammed (saw)    So this answer goes out to all the unity fans.
e3PWZYsAaa	Salam,    a God fearing muslims wouldn't make the prophet of Allah SWT curse him........    Sahih Muslim    Book 032, Number 6298:   Ibn Abbas reported: I was playing with children that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) happened to pass by (us). I hid myself behind the door. He (the Holy Prophet) came and he patted upon my shoulders and said: Go and call Mu'awiya. I returned and said: He is busy in taking food. He again asked me to go and call Mu'swiya to him. I went (and came back) and said that he was busy in taking food, whereupon he said: May Allah not fill his belly! Ibn Muthanna, said: I asked Umm Umayya what he meant by the word Hatani. He said: It means" he patted my shoulders".        now let the thumb downs commence........        Peace.|`|HnX6qyuGaa	So u dont know except this same question ?  to ask it over and over again????      i wonder why some repeat his questions over and over again unless he was trolling like u doing now :))))|`|d1i3ac5baa	the truth is after mohammad died. a power struggle started as to who would lead the muslims and get the 20% of the booty from all the raids and the taxes collected from muslims. as mohammad had did.|`|KqiiT1WSaa	Okay so you want to curse Mu'awiyah (ra)     and then you want unity with the sunnis.    BUT PLEASE DO NOT STOP AND MUAWIYAH and continue with all the other companions as well just like KTP did. He is a PROPER SHIA !!    Right, now yesterday some shia users asked me when a shia user has ever cursed the sahabah (raa).

BUT THE SIMPLE ISSUE IS:    If you are saying this for Mu'awiyah (ra)     THEN YOU MUST !!!!!!! say it for Aisha (ra) as well    otherwise you are being a hypocrite    As sunnis we say that whatever came between them then it was as the prophet (saw) said that once he come then there will be trials for his companions.    But regarding ALL the companions of the prophet (saw) then we say May Allah be Pleased with them. May Allah Forgive their sins. And may Allah (swt) unite them with the prophet Muhammed (saw) on the day of judgement and May Allah (swt) give them the highest portion of Jannah.    Whereas you shia just like to lie and slander and curse against them.    P.S. I should note that the shia version of history is FULL to the teeth of lies and slander  _____    @ 99 - so what - the action were the same. BUT the only difference is that we have love for the sahabah and you dont.    We ask Allah (swt) good for them, but you want Allah (swt) to curse them. Only the enemies of Islam would not want Allah (swt) to be pleased with them i.e. only the enemies of Islam would not put RA after thier names.|`|hFxJ02NSaa	Regarding this ongoing Sunni/Shia battle here, I think each side has some things right and each side has some things wrong.|`|472e38086de52f52e7089f1f29ef15ddaa	They do it from stupidity and ignorance.  Muhammed said that any muslim who kills a muslim is going to hell ..both in fact will go to hell.  Alas if only Hamas and other muslims would think about what that means.  Islam claims all people are born muslim and many just do not yet realize it..yet islam also simulataneously has in the quran the command to slay the UNbelievers.. if we make these things match up LOGICALLY ..NO muslim is EVER allowed to murder or kill or torture anyone else ever or they will go to hell.     God clearly states ALL people must appear before him on the day of judgement.  What person standing before God could possibly pretend he is not there.  That makes NO sense so ALL will be believers in GOD when time ends.  All people become believers in GOD because God requires it. ( try very hard here also to remember NO religion is God, ONLY GOD IS GOD.  so ALL will believe in God and are thus BELIEVERS eternally before God because God is eternal )     I wish islamists would read their own holy book with their own eyes and use the logic from the wonderful brain God gave each and every one of us .... females and males alike ALL are children before God, not one exception ) .|`|p5cglKf0aa	YOUR THIRD QUESTION    What was the wisdom in the tragic and cruel treatment those blessed persons received?    T h e A n s w e r : As explained above, there were three basic reasons that gave rise to the pitiless cruelty of Husains opponents during Umayyad rule:    One was the pitiless principle of politics: Individuals may be sacrificed for the well-being of the government and preservation of public order.    The second was the cruel rule of nationalism, Everything may be sacrificed for the well-being of the nation, since their rule was based on racialism and nationalism.    The Third: Since the traditional vein of rivalry of the Umayyads towards the Hashimites was found in some people like Yazid, he displayed a merciless ability to be cruel.    A Fourth Reason: The Umayyads, taking Arab nationalism as the basis, looked on the members of other nations - who were found among Husain's supporters - as slaves, and had wounded their national pride. So, since the other nations had joined Husain's community with mixed intentions and to take revenge, the Umayyads fanatic nationalism was excessively affronted, and the other nations were the cause of the extremely cruel and pitiless well-known tragedy.    The four reasons mentioned above are outward and apparent. When it is considered from the point of view of Divine Determining, the results pertaining to the Hereafter and the spiritual rule and spiritual progress that the tragedy gained for Hazrat Husain and his relatives were of such high worth that the distress they suffered due to it became extremely easy and cheap. Like if a soldier dies after an hours torture and becomes a martyr, he attains such a rank that another could reach it only if he strove for ten years. If the soldier was to be asked after he had died, he would reply that he had gained much for very little.    ...    THE MEANING OF YOUR SECOND QUESTION    What was the nature of the wars that started in the time of Ali {May God be pleased with him)? In what way should we describe those who took part in them, and those who died and those who killed?    T h e A n s w e r : The war called the Event of the Camel between Ali and Talha, and Zubayr and Aysha the Veracious (May God be pleased with all of them) was the struggle between pure justice and relative justice. It was as follows:    Ali took pure justice as the basis and in accordance with his judgement of the Law, proceeded on that basis, as was the case in the time of the Caliphs Abu Bakr and Umar. Those who opposed him said that at that time the purity of Islam permitted pure justice, but since with the passage of time various peoples whose Islam was weak had entered Islamic social life, to apply pure justice was extremely difficult. For this reason, their judgement of the Law was to proceed on the basis of relative justice, known as the lesser of two evils. Dispute over interpretation of the Law led to war. Since the interpretations had been purely for Gods sake and for the benefit of Islam, and war was born of interpretation of the Law, we may surely say that both those who killed and those who were killed gained Paradise, and both acted rightfully. However accurate was Alis interpretation, and however much in error those who opposed him, they still did not deserve punishment. For if one who interprets the Law extracts the truth, he gains two rewards, but if he does not extract it, he still earns one reward, the reward for interpreting which is a form of worship; he is forgiven his error. A learned person who is widely known amongst us, and who speaks the truth, wrote in Kurdish: Dont gossip about the war between the Companions, for both killer and killed were destined for Paradise.    http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2946&...|`|zBqt99avaa	"...Muslims were not supposed to go to war with one another."    "Bin Tamaya, the Islamic thinker, was born around 1268 or 1269... succeeded his father as a teacher of the rigidly orthodox Hannibal School of Islam, was able to solve for them. [the problem of inter-Islamic warfare]    His solution was that an unrighteous Muslim ruler can be lawfully resisted, if he does not live piously according to the strictly interpreted criteria of the Quran.  To him...were not legally Muslim but apostates, whatever their outward profession...jihad...could be waged against them..."    I'm not saying I agree with what he decided, but this is when it was determined that Muslims could go to war with each other.  If you're interested, it was the Mamluks (based out of Egypt) who wanted to go to war against the Il-Khans (at that time based in present day Iran/Iraq), who were Mongolian converts to Islam.

"He (Muawiyah) should abandon cursing the Commander of the faithful (Ali) as well as the practice of using personal prayer (Qunut) against him (al-Hassan) in Salat (the prescribed ritual prayers), and that he should not mention the name of All except in good manner."    _____________    These first 3 conditions tell us what kinda Muslim Muawiya(l) was.    ________    @NOUB- you are being a hypocrite   Go find out why Muawiya(l) fight Ali(as) and why Aisha(ra) fight Ali(as) ...........you will get your answer.|`|8FbJjRpwaa	They wouldnt if they both properly feared God =]  edit:- oh i didnt read ur paragraph only ur title so i edited  wow u have strong feelings but i agree normal ppl shouldnt judge others especially sahabi!

pN0EOoepaa	yeah it is rude....I try not to smoke where non smokers are. If a non smoker walks by me as I'm smoking how is that my fault. Why would they come near someone who smokes. Who made them air police?    Until smoking is 100% illegal everyone smoker or not needs to deal with it. Besides there are far more important things to focus there energy on.|`|LICzadWCaa	I'm not a smoker and I think dirty looks are rude. However, walking around and coughing may just be a reaction to the smoke itself, not disapproval of the smoker.|`|HV3H73UZaa	Well I try to stay away from the non-smokers because if you don't smoke, you probably don't want to be surrounded you know?    If someone gives me a dirty look or makes a comment I just make one back...this one girl gave me a dirty look and I responded, "Hun, you are gonna die a lot faster with all that fake and bake s***!" She just gave me this ugh sound and walked away...|`|QYnpwoKSaa	yea I do, I try not to block the entrance way, and some people look at you like your a leper!|`|VMY7No0eaa	NO... your smoke filters over to their air space.  And smokers often do not ralize the stench  cig's make or how far the smoke travels.     How do you feel when someone cuts a really stinky fart... don't you react?  wouldn't you move away from them     consider them and move to an area where they would not  be walking in (in other words check the prevailing winds)|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	I admit I'm guilty of doing this myself.  It's not like I think people will work on their addiction because I look at them, but honestly it's like walking by someone who is reeking of B.O.  It's offensive I'm afraid, and it stays on you if you are in their presence for any length of time.  It makes me nauseous and sometimes I do cough, so that's where the face comes from.|`|AA10067344	They aren't walking around the smoke to be rude.  They're doing it because it smells bad.|`|dCewrtXaaa	No. Many people are highly sensitive to cigarette smoke, or even allergic to it. You are taking up more than your fair share of sidewalk space with a cloud of foul-smelling smoke, and they should not be expected to walk through a toxic area without doing everything they can to avoid breathing it in. The cough is not out of rudeness, but out of respiratory distress. And some of those "dirty looks" may be concern and pity for your own health status. You should never smoke in front of a business because it may drive away customers. Find another area, either more secluded or with more open space. You are the transgressor in this situation, not the victim.|`|63c46881d0aa0376d34c1858ee0f160faa	yes in fact i would rather them walk all the way around me then anything else if they don't like it they can hold there breath or what ever they think they have to do if they think coughing bothers me it doesn't but don't give me dirty looks it bothering them not me i fallow the laws about how far a way i have to be & in some places that same look will get some people to confront u about it|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Indeed, that is rude.  And nasty.  I don't see why those who don't smoke feel free to be so rude to others.    I haven't smoked for 7 years, now.  But I remember how I felt when people were rude towards me, when I did smoke.  And so, when I walk past smokers,  I just smile, and am pleasant about it.|`|rThIVk2maa	I used to ignore dirty looks, which are ruder than what they apparently thought I was doing.|`|yvDzvIbBaa	well, I smoke at work indoors. the law says not to, but everyone just ignores that here.    if anyone gave me a dirty look for smoking i'd probably flick my cigarette at them.|`|lKsgF8bOaa	They walk around because smoke makes them chock, or because they do not want to be second-hand smokers; which is more dangerous than smoking.    Any smoker who smokes in a non-smoking-designated area deserves the look you are talking about.|`|DcUoZntOaa	yes! i just refer them to the chemical plant down the street.  as if i don't know it's a bad habit. but i smoke 5 a day and have alot of stress in my life and find it hard to quit.  peanut butter paste anyone?  peace!|`|U8pIm7Sbaa	it is rude, but at the same time some people don't like the smell of cigarettes and some people are asthmatic so walking around isn't a big deal but when they give you dirty looks or pretend to cough because they don't think people should smoke, personally I think if a person wants to smoke let them it's their body no need to be rude to them, if you don't smoke good for you but get off my back|`|AA11788494	Yes dirty looks are very rude.
Sn0CViR7aa	Once-saved-always-saved is not just unbiblical: It is a direct contradiction to Jesus' teachings about salvation.    Jesus taught that salvation requires endurance to the end:    Matthew 10:22: And you will be hated by all for My names sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.  Matthew 24:13: But he who endures to the end shall be saved.  Mark 13:13: And you will be hated by all for My names sake. But he who endures to the end shall be saved.  Luke 21:16-18: You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death. All men will hate you because of me. But not a hair of your head will perish. By standing firm you will gain life.    By implication, those who do not endure to the end, who abandon God to chase after the false gods of this world, will not not gain eternal life.  As you say, they may take sin to new depths, demonstrating how horrible a person can be.  While they can repent and seek reconciiation with God as long as they live, not everyone has the opportunity to take stock on one's life when death comes. Death may arrive suddenly, as in a car crash, closing the window on repentance.    CJ misunderstands Jesus in John 6: "And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day." Jesus is saying that God's will is that none would be lost, but not everyone obeys God.     Later in the same chapter, Jesus says, "Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!" (He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)"  Now read John 17:12: "While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled."    In other words, despite God's will and Jesus' perfect work, Judas rejected Christ and was lost.    Cheers,  Bruce|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Once saved always saved is the Gospel of Jesus Christ.      It is IMPOSSIBLE to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13).     If you think you can lose or "leave" salvation, then you might not be saved at all. Because Jesus gives ETERNAL life, not "temporary" or "probationary" life. So if you think you can lose it, then you don't understand the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Instead, what you have is a false gospel of works, and no false gospel will get you into heaven (Galatians 1:6-9).     In other words, until a person believes that what he has received from the Lord Jesus is permanent and cannot be lost, he is not yet born again. A person cannot believe in Christ alone for his eternal destiny and also believe that he must do something (or avoid doing something) to keep it.|`|AA10034051	No it is not right. Salvation is a life long process, not a one time thing of saying you believe in Jesus.    The apostle John wrote us a wonderful promise from God: John 3:16-17 "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."    Does this mean that once we accept Jesus in our heart by faith, and thus are saved, that we can do anything even immoral things, and we still will be saved? Let's see what the Scriptures says about this.    1 Tim 4:1: "The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons."    This text shows that Christians can loose their salvation if they follow deceiving spirits.    2 Peter 2:20-22: "If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning. It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them. Of them the proverbs are true: 'A dog returns to its vomit," and, "A sow that is washed goes back to her wallowing in the mud.'"    The apostle Peter indicates clearly here that it is worst for someone who has accepted Jesus in his life to return to his old ways than "not to have known the way of righteousness". Why? The book of Hebrews explains this for us.    Heb 6:4-6: "It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age, if they fall away, to be brought back to repentance, because to their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace."    This text describes Christians who not only accepted Jesus by faith into their life, but also personally tasted God's Holy Spirit. What happens to them if they "fall away'? This text is clear. It is impossible for them to be brought back to repentance, and thus obtain eternal salvation, because they did sin against the Holy Spirit. They have lost it!    Heb 10:26-28: "If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God."    Here we see clearly that once we have accepted Jesus in our life, we just can't go on living as if He did not exist, and "deliberately keep on sinning". What would be the result if you did? Would you still obtain eternal salvation? The Bible says that these will have "a fearful expectation of judgment". There again, they have lost their salvation.    The apostle Paul confirms this in 1 Cor 15:1-2: "Now, brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain."    In other words, if someone does not hold on firm to God's word, he/she has "believed in vain".    An example that one can loose his/her salvation is King Saul. He was chosen by God to be the first king of Israel. He was filled with God's Spirit at first (1 Samuel 10 6), but because of his pride and evil actions, never repenting from what he did wrong, eventually God's Spirit departed from him 1 Sam 16:14 "Now the Spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul" NIV King Saul had been saved, but he lost his salvation due to his unrepentant heart. How sad!    These texts clearly contradict the theory of "Once saved, always saved". This theory is simply not Biblical.  "As the Bible says, I am already saved (Rom. 8:24, Eph. 2:58), but Im also being saved (1 Cor. 1:8, 2 Cor. 2:15, Phil. 2:12), and I have the hope that I will be saved (Rom. 5:910, 1 Cor. 3:1215). Like the apostle Paul I am working out my salvation in fear and trembling (Phil. 2:12), with hopeful confidence in the promises of Christ (Rom. 5:2, 2 Tim. 2:1113)."|`|iHDYncuXaa	We already HAVE eternal life     When the Bible speaks of possessing eternal life, it speaks in the present tense (hath, have, etc.)  SOMETHING WE ALREADY HAVE! If we had to work or endure to keep our salvation, this could not be true.    "He that believeth on the Son HATH EVERLASTING LIFE:.. ." John 3:36    "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that YE HAVE ETERNAL LIFE,. . ." 1 John 5:13    "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, HATH EVERLASTING LIFE,. . ." John 5:24    Jesus will NOT cast you out       ". . . him that cometh to me I WILL IN NO WISE CAST OUT." John 6:37    We are COMPLETE in Jesus Christ       "And ye are COMPLETE IN HIM, which is the head of all principality and power:" Colossians 2:10    We are PERFECTED FOR EVER       We are "perfected for ever" by Jesus Christ. How could the Lord say such a bold statement if we had to earn or keep our salvation?      "By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ ONCE FOR ALL. . . For by one offering he hath PERFECTED FOR EVER them that are sanctified." Hebrews 10:10,14    We are PRESERVED in Christ Jesus       "Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and PRESERVED IN JESUS CHRIST, and called:" Jude 1      "And THE LORD. . . WILL PRESERVE ME unto his heavenly kingdom:. . ." 2 Timothy 4:18    We are KEPT by the POWER of God       "Who are KEPT BY THE POWER OF GOD through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time." 1 Peter 1:5    "Now unto him that is able TO KEEP YOU from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy," Jude 24    We are saved to the UTTERMOST       "Wherefore he is able also to save them to the UTTERMOST that come unto God by him,. . ." Hebrews 7:25    We are SEALED until the day of redemption     "And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby YE ARE SEALED unto the day of redemption."

I  sincerely believe the once saved always saved concept to be wrong. The implication that once someone becomes a real Christian (a definition would be handy) they are saved and that they cant backslide or commit a sin which would rob them of that inheritance.    From my experience, Christians can sin and they often do sin but to believe that a Christian can live any way he or she likes, and still be saved, is dangerous. Some argue that a real Christian wouldnt commit these sins and it is the almost Christians who fall foul of this type of entrapment from the enemy. I believe that would be wrong too. Committed Christians sin for all sorts of reasons and we are only saved by Gods amazing Grace, not our level of commitment. God knows our true heart!    If a Christian sins maliciously (deliberately breaks laws for his or her own advantage  say purchasing goods known, or strongly suspected, of being stolen) that is quite different from accidentally sinning  something we all do constantly.    God knows our true intention. We might be able to fool a police officer that we sinned accidentally, but God knows the real truth. I believe that if we deliberately go against the direction given by Jesus (who, you will remember, said to obey the laws of the land) then we must suffer the consequences  and that might mean the loss of eternal life.     Matthew 13:18-23  18 Listen then to what the parable of the sower means:  19 When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path.  20 The one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.  21 But since he has no root, he lasts only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away.  22 The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful.  23 But the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it. He produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. [NIV]    For people who believe that once saved, always saved I rhetorically ask: how do you relate your beliefs to Matthew 13: 20-21? If a man cannot lose his salvation then why would Jesus say: When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away?    Mark 13:13 says:  [Jesus said] All men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. [NIV]    Look again at the second half of that sentence. Jesus is saying that to be saved you must stand firm (for Him) until you die. Conversely He is therefore saying that those who do not stand firm will not be saved! Notice that I am not quoting Paul or any other Apostle or Disciple, but the Son of God Himself.    If God didnt want us to be able to choose He would not have given us the gift of freewill. It is this gift which places us above the animals. It is this gift which allows us to choose to either worship God or not worship God. It is this gift, and only this gift, which allows us to truly love Him like a son. It is this gift which proves that once saved, always saved must be wrong.    If we are saved in spite of ourselves then there is no freewill. If there is no freewill then the Bible is wrong!

You are not new in this dilemma. Chances are that if you are worried that you are not saved then you are. That is of course only if you and I are on the same page on what Salvation is. In Acts it is said "Sirs what must I do to be saved? And he said to them 'Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved'."     The idea behind salvation is that you are adopted into Gods "family." Think of him like your earthly father who is supposed to love you even when you make mistakes. Instead of God constantly punishing you for making mistakes he let his son take it for us all in one go.    In order to be saved you have to believe that Jesus was who he said he is, and that he did what he said he did. And finally you just have to ask for forgiveness.    So what did Jesus say he was? Well he said that "anyone who has seen me has seen the father." He said he was God. There is not denying or prancing around this issue. Once you are saved you ARE SAVED. If you believe these things then their are naturally things you should be doing. It is important to remember that Christianity is the only religion that does not require good works for salvation. You cannot lose salvation once you have it. But don't think of it as a "get out of hell free card." You still have responsibilities to do the right thing.     The second item on the list is that He did what he said he did. That is he died in your place. he took your punishment. Perhaps the single most loving thing anyone has ever done for anyone else. It was the perfect example of selfless sacrifice. This means that when he dies on the cross he knew he was dyeing for you. personally you. Scripture tells us that he knew you in your mother womb. Even before you existence God took care of the problem.    Yeah you are gonna make mistakes, everyone does. The cool thing about Christians is forgiveness. When you make a mistake all you have to do is admit it was a mistake and ask for forgiveness. The asking part is important. If you want to discuss the topic more just send me an email, I can find you on and Instant messaging system or something and answer any questions you might have. I could open a whole can of worms with the why Evil Exists in the first place but I don't want to bore you. if You want to know why evil exists you can like I said send me a message.    "And you also were included in Christ when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. Having believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are Gods possessionto the praise of his glory."|`|jQ5pz7BYaa	I was OSAS for almost 40 years until some life changing things happened to my family.  I have even taught this doctrine.  But after much studying and mediating on God's word in search of other answers God convicted me greatly of this false doctrine.  It was not the answer I expected from God.  Believe me I like the ear tickling doctrine of OSAS.  But through many scriptures God has shown me that salvation is conditional.  OSAS can cause you to lose you fear of a holy and righteous God.  It can cause you to start to let your guard down.  I am seeing the fruits of this bad and evil doctrine.  I was a Baptist and have now left the church in search for ones that do not teach OSAS.  I can from my own experience that the battle against sin is a whole lot easier if you know that there is severe consequences to sin.  Like not inheriting the kingdom of God.  Apostle Paul warned in 1 Cor.6:9-10, Gal. 5:19-21, Eph. 5:6 etc. that Christians that do these things will lose their salvation.    Please focus on the conditional passages and interpret everything from those. Eph. 5:6 "Let no man (including me) deceive you with vain words (words of no value): for because of these things (Sins Listed) cometh the wrath of God upon the Children of disobedience."    A healthy fear of God can do wonders for somebody that is sinning.    James 5:19-20 Brethren (believers), if any (whosoever) of you (one of the believers) do err (sin) from the truth, and one convert him; Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner (fallen christian) from the error of his way shall save a soul from death (spiritual), and shall hide a multitude of sins.    This is very serious! Note all are appointed to physical death.  This is talking about spiritual death which is a lose of spiritual life.    Stay in the word of God daily.  Memorize scriptures.  I hope you get back on track.  I hope I encouraged you in the right direction.

vEEeq7kYaa	I am copy-pasting from Isaiah here today.  While I am also PICKING passages, I respectfully suggest that rather than take my word for what the text says, you go back and peruse it at your leisure to confirm  the contextual meaning for yourself.    When Isaiah wrote his book, there were no chapter designations. They did not come  for more than a thousand years.  The narrative Isaiah is in the MIDDLE of telling by Chapter 53 actually begins in Chapter 41 and continues far beyond Chapter 53.  I will only start with the beginning of this particular narrative and we shall play detective ..Watson and Holmes, and count TOGETHER precisely how many times Isaiah specifically identifies beyond any doubt just WHO that suffering servant really is.  By the time he gets to Chapter 53, he has no need to keep identifying who the servant is, because youll see for yourself, he had repeated it more than a dozen times.  Lets begin:  41:8 "But you, Israel, My servant," (Okay, that's one Watson. Let's keep   track of how many times Israel is called "servant").   41:9 "To whom I said: You are My servant; (Two).   42:1 "This is My servant, whom I uphold,   My chosen one, in whom I delight.   I have put My spirit upon him,   He shall teach the true way to the nations.   He shall not cry out or shout aloud," (Three)   42:6 "I the LORD, in My grace have summoned you,   And I have grasped you by the hand.   I created you, and appointed you   A COVENANT PEOPLE, A LIGHT OF NATIONS-   Opening eyes deprived of light,"(It's clear that the servant described   in 42:1 is Israel).   42:19 "Who is so blind as My servant, (Four)   So deaf as the messenger I send?   Who is so blind as the chosen one,   So blind as the servant of the LORD" (Five)   42:21 "The LORD desires His (servant's) vindication,   That he may magnify and glorify (His) Teaching."   (This Isaiah chap seems to be saying Watson that a FORMERLY   sinful Israel will BECOME righteous and serve as a good example   for the nations).   43:10 "My servant, whom I have chosen." (Six)   44:1 "But hear, now, O Jacob My servant,   Israel whom I have chosen!" (Seven)   44:2 "Fear not, My servant Jacob,   Jeshurun whom I have chosen," (Eight)   44:21 "Remember these things, O Jacob   For you, O Israel, are My servant:" (Nine)   44:21 "I fashioned you, you are My servant-   O Israel, never forget Me." (Ten)   44:26 "But confirm the word of My servant   And fulfill the prediction of My messengers." (Eleven)   45:4 "For the sake of My servant Jacob,   Israel My chosen one," (Twelve)   48:16 "And now the Lord God has sent me, endowed with His spirit"   (It would seem Watson that Isaiah is the messenger or servant to   Israel).   48:21 "Say: "The LORD has redeemed His servant Jacob!" (Thirteen).   49: The LORD appointed me before I was born,    And He said to me, "You are My servant, Israel in whom I glory"      And now the Lord has resolved- He who formed me in the womb to be his servant-to bring back Jacob to Himself, that Israel may be restored to Him.  And I have been honored in the sight of the Lord, My God has been my strength.  For He has said:  It is too little that you should be My servant in that I raise up the tribes of Jacob and restore the survivors of Israel; I will also make you a light of nations, that my salvation may reach the ends of the earth.  (Ahaah. So Isaiah is the servant to Israel and Israel is the servant to   the nations).   50:4 "The Lord GOD gave me a skilled tongue,   To know how to speak timely words to the weary." (Isaiah)   50:10 "Who among you reveres the LORD   And heeds the voice of His servant?- (Isaiah)   52:13 "Indeed, My servant shall prosper," (Fourteen)      I first read the Tanakh in full while in grade school.  I had no one explain it to me then, the context is actually rather clear to anyone, Jew or not, if you actually read it IN context.  To impose another entity into the text ( Jesus) requires taking an arbitrary portion out of context, and imposing concepts that are forbidden to Judaism, as well.    Other things are fairly clear if you've read both the Tanakh in context and then the New Testament.     Jesus doesn't fit several of the details in the chapter.   Jesus was never written about as sick.  Some say that he was sick during the crucifixion, but physical trauma (e.g. execution) is not considered sickness in the normal sense of the word.  b) Jesus had no children.  Some say this refers to disciples or spiritual children, but the word "zera" is common in the Tanach and, when applied to people, always means linear descendants, not someone's disciples or followers.  c) Jesus was not buried with the wicked.  One cannot even say he died with the wicked since the Hebrew "rashaeem" is plural and, according to the crucifixion story, one of the thieves next to him ended up in heaven and so was not wicked.  d) Jesus did not have long life.  Missionaries say he had long life in heaven, but that, again, is stretching the meaning of the word.  e) verse 9 "Nor was there deceit in his mouth." doesn't apply because, according to the gospel accounts, Jesus lied to his family about going to Jerusalem. (John 7:8-10), and lied in saying that he never taught in secret (see John 18:20, vs. Matt. 16:20, Mark 8:30 and others).       In addition, The Jews for Judaism analysis of Isaiah 53 points out that a) contrary to verse 2, Jesus is never described as physically unattractive;   b) far from being rejected and despised as verse 3 says, the Gospel writers describe him as being popular; crowds give him hosannahs  c) contrary to verse 7, Jesus did a lot of talking; and  d) instead of being non-violent (verse 9), Jesus overturned tables, chased people from their jobs, and |`|P6atY3xXaa	It is about Jesus.  He was bruised/killed for our iniquity (sin).  He made his grave with the wicked (he was killed between 2 real sinners while he did no sin), he was buried with the rich (the tomb of rich Joseph of Arimatea was where he was laid)....lots of verses cross reference with these but I don't know them from memory though.

Contrary to what most Jews today allege, NONE of their early scholars (whom they call "sages") taught that Isaiah 53 pertained to the Jewish people.  Variously, these "sages" taught that Isaiah 53 pertained to the Messiah; to the prophet Jeremiah; or to some other individual.  NONE of them taught that Isaiah 53 pertained to the Jews as a whole ... until Rashi came along in the 11th Century.    @ Kismet:  you allege Isaiah 53 pertains to the Jews.  The JPS Tanakh reads as follows:    10 Yet it pleased HaShem to crush him by disease; to see if his soul would offer itself in restitution, that he might see his seed, prolong his days, and that the purpose of HaShem might prosper by his hand:    11 Of the travail of his soul he shall see to the full, even My servant, who by his knowledge did justify the Righteous One to the many, and their iniquities he did bear.    12 Therefore will I divide him a portion among the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the mighty; because he bared his soul unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.    By your view, the Scriptures say that God permitted the righteous Jews to be slain as a sacrifice for the iniquities of the ungodly Gentiles.  Yet, when disputing with Messianic Jews/Gentile Christians, Jews ALSO claim that God doesn't approve of human sacrifice.  These points are hopelessly contradictory.  WHICH ONE IS IT?  Does He approve or doesn't He?  If He doesn't, then the Jews cannot be the "Suffering Servant" of Isaiah 53.    Additionally, this position contradicts Deuteronomy 28, where God promises to protect the Jewish people if they are righteous -- and not permit them to be slain by the ungodly.  So either God is a liar, or the Jewish position is mistaken.|`|AA10747442	Christian version: The Abba Father laid on Jesus [Yashua] the sins of us all !!!

He is the Messiah, the Saviour of the world. It portrays His sufferings as the Passover Lamb sacrifice, which was foreshadowed in Exodus 12. During the Passover about 2000 years ago, Jesus was betrayed in the garden of Gethsemane, and was delivered to the Romans to be scourged, mocked and crucified outside the gates of Jerusalem. It was part of God's plan of salvation, because at the cross, Jesus carried all our sins and sicknesses, and bore the full punishment on our behalf, until the divine justice of God was satisfied, and Jesus cried out, "It is finished!" (John 19:30)    Brother Andrew has given an excellent explanation of Isaiah 53, as taught by the Holy Spirit, so I shan't go into details. :)  Sister Tamil has summarised it well. Sister Tallulah pointed out the reason many of the Jews did not believe in Jesus and rejected Him as their Messiah. It was part of God's salvation plan - "that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: 'The Deliverer will come out of Zion, and He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob; for this is My covenant with them, when I take away their sins.'" (Romans 11:25-27; Isaiah 59:20-21) Sister Suzanne pointed out that God made the suffering Servant's soul "an offering for sin" (Isaiah 53:10, NKJV). Many Jews believe that God is against human sacrifices and yet they choose to believe Israel (as a nation) is the suffering servant being described here as a sacrifice for sin. I'm afraid this belief is not consistent.    Isaiah means "Salvation is Yahweh", and rightly so, for the book of Isaiah is about Jesus as our salvation, for Jesus is Yahweh, the covenant-keeping God (or YHWH). The book of Isaiah has 66 chapters - the first 39 chapters are mainly about prophecies on the doom for a sinful Judah and for all the nations of the world who oppose God; the next 27 chapters prophesy the restoration of the nation of Israel, and include the Songs of the Suffering Servant. This is interesting because the book of Isaiah is like a mini Bible, which comprises 66 books as well - the first 39 books making up the Old Testament, and the next 27 books the New Testament. This shows that the whole Bible that we have today in Christian churches is divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit - that through careful and prayerful selection by the early church fathers, the 66 books form a composite whole we have today.    In the book of Isaiah, we see glimpses of Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world as early as in Isaiah 1:18 "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool" We see Jesus glorified, high and lifted up, in Isaiah's vision in Isaiah 6:1 "I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His robe filled the temple." We see the birth of Jesus prophesised in Isaiah 9:6 "For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." Let's fast forward to Isaiah 40, the beginning of the Book of comfort, where John the baptist was prophesised to point everyone to Jesus as the Messiah - "Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God." (verse 3) Next, we see Jesus in His ministry on earth, whom God anointed with the Holy Spirit and He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, and He was later arrested, beaten, scourged, mocked and spat upon by the Roman soldiers - "The Lord God has given Me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him who is weary. He awakens Me morning by morning, He awakens My ear to hear as the learned. The Lord God has opened My ear; and I was not rebellious, nor did I turn away. I gave My back to those who struck Me, and My cheeks to those who plucked out the beard; I did not hide My face from shame and spitting." (Isaiah 50:4-6, Matthew 27:27-31) Jesus was born of a virgin by the power of the Holy Spirit, so He is without sin, and He must have been good-looking in his sinless flesh, but during the Passion or suffering, His visage was beaten beyond recognition. Isaiah 52:14-15 reveals that "Just as many were astonished at you, so His visage was marred more than any man, and His form more than the sons of men; so shall He sprinkle (or startle) many nations."    And so we have come to Isaiah 53 which describes Jesus' sufferings for our sakes - Surely He bore our sicknesses and pains, so that we are redeemed from sicknesses and pain through faith in Him. (Matthew 8:17) At the cross, God made Him who knew no sin to be a sin offering for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. (2 Corinthians 5:21) That is the gospel that Paul preached - that we are made righteous by the blood of Jesus shed on the cross. (Romans 5:9) But many Jews refuse to believe the gospel, choosing to trust in their own righteousness by the works of the law instead of trusting Jesus to be their Righteousness. (Romans 9:32-33) Hence, Paul continued to write "But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our report.' So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ." (Romans 10:16-17) The context tells us that the gospel of grace of Christ that we are preaching to the world is built on the finished work of Jesus Christ at the cross - through His death, burial and resurrection, we who believe in Him have received forgiveness of sins and the gift of righteousness (right standing with God), and Isaiah 53 is one of the key passages that support the gospel. :) Thanks for the question for our Bible study, and may God bless you richly as always, sister ashmarie. :)|`|73n1SExgaa	It is talking about Jesus.

It is found in Jewish Bibles today, though it is left out of the weekly synagogue readings, as are many other texts of the Bible. When people read Isaiah 53 without knowing which part of the Bible it comes from, they often wrongly assume is from the New Testament. Did Isaiah foresee the sufferings of Jesus to pay for our sins? Though many modern rabbis --and some ancient rabbis-- say the sufferings described are those of the nation of Israel, most ancient rabbis said it refers to Messiah's sufferings. We have provided a link to some of the great rabbinic sources which interpreted the passage as referring to the Messiah, even though they did not believe in Jesus. We have also provided a link demonstrating why Isaiah 53 cannot refer to Israel and who it must necessarily refer to. You will also find some other interesting links below. The passage actually begins with the end of Isaiah chapter 52. Read it for yourself.        --------------------------------------...    52:13 Behold, my servant shall prosper,   he shall be exalted and lifted up,   and shall be very high.   52:14 As many were astonished at him --   his appearance was so marred, beyond human semblance,   and his form beyond that of the sons of men --   52:15 so shall he sprinkle many nations;   kings shall shut their mouths because of him;   for that which has not been told them they shall see,   and that which they have not heard they shall understand.   53:1 Who has believed our message?   And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?   53:2 For he grew up before him like a young plant,   and like a root out of dry ground;   he had no form or comeliness that we should look at him,   and no beauty that we should desire him.   53:3 He was despised and rejected by men;   a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief;   and as one from whom men hide their faces   he was despised, and we esteemed him not.   53:4 Surely he has borne our griefs   and carried our sorrows;   yet we esteemed him stricken,   smitten by God, and afflicted.   53:5 But he was wounded for our transgressions,   he was bruised for our iniquities;   upon him was the chastisement that made us whole,   and with his stripes we are healed.   53:6 All we like sheep have gone astray;   we have turned every one to his own way;   and the LORD has laid on him   the iniquity of us all.   53:7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,   yet he opened not his mouth;   like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,   and like a sheep that before its shearers is dumb,   so he opened not his mouth.   53:8 By oppression and judgment he was taken away;   and as for his generation, who considered   that he was cut off out of the land of the living,   stricken for the transgression of my people?   53:9 And they made his grave with the wicked   and with a rich man in his death,   although he had done no violence,   and there was no deceit in his mouth.   53:10 Yet it was the will of the LORD to bruise him;   he has put him to grief;   when he makes himself an offering for sin,   he shall see his offspring, he shall prolong his days;   the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand;   53:11 he shall see the fruit of the travail of his soul and be satisfied;   by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant,   make many to be accounted righteous;   and he shall bear their iniquities.   53:12 Therefore I will divide him a portion with the great,   and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;   because he poured out his soul to death,   and was numbered with the transgressors;   yet he bore the sin of many,   and made intercession for the transgressors.|`|RB7RjINwaa	Scripture = Bullshit.

Isaiah 53:1 Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?    " And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed "? Jesus is called the arm of the  Lord in other places in the Bible too, we know that Jesus sits at the right hand of God ( Mark 16:19;Luke 22:69; Rom.8:34 ) We can see in the New Testament when this verse was fulfilled:     John 12:37 But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:   38 That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?      Isaiah 53:2 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.   3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.     We see how it says the " He ( Jesus ) shall grow up before Him ( The Father ) as a tender plant, and as a root out of dry ground: " The words " grow up " shows that the Lord would be born, and from a child grow before the Lord. These other verses describe so much about Jesus, His heart, the things that He endured, how He was treated by people.    Isaiah 53:4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.   5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.    6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.    We see the purpose of Christ coming, it was to pay the debt for our sins, He bore our griefs, and carried our sorrows. How much Jesus loves us! He took our place, the punishment that we deserve He took on Himself, He suffered for us, so that we could go free.    1 Peter 2:24 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.   25 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.    Isaiah 53:7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.    This shows how Jesus would be brought to be put to death, and even though He was oppressed and afflicted He didn't speak, so much so that Pilate marveled.      Mark 15:3 And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.   4 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.   5 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.     We can also see from Acts that this scripture is speaking of Jesus:    Acts 8:30 And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?   31 And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.   32 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:   33 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.   34 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?   35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.     Isaiah 53:8 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.   9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.     This shows that Jesus would die, " for He was cut off out of the land of the living: " and it was us that He died. By saying, " He made His grave with the wicked, " it was speaking of how He was crucified with the wicked, ( the criminals who had done wrong ) " and with the rich in His death " it was speaking of the tomb that Jesus was laid in. After the Lord's death a rich man that believed in Jesus gave the tomb that he had carved out of the rock.    Matthew 27:57 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:   58 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.   59 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,  60 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.    That ninth verse not only shows how Jesus was killed among the wicked, and how He was buried in a rich man's tomb, but also that Jesus had done no wrong, or anything worthy of death, " because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. " Jesus was and is perfect, without sin.    Isaiah 53:10 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.    We see that it was God's plan for Christ to die for us, it was because God loves us so much a|`|SBL1t3ZSaa	The way it is written in any Christian Bible, Christians will say it is about Jesus. The truth is that it is about the people Israel.    You need the correct translation from the Hebrew Bible, The correct translation of Isaiah 53:8 (from the Hebrew bible) "as a result of the transgression of my people, THEY were afflicted."     The correct translation is THEY, not He! This Hebrew word for THEY appears over 40 times in the Hebrew bible - but it is always mistranslated as HE in the Christian Bible.    This is one part of the Tanakh that many Christians use to *prove* to us that Jesus is mentioned/referenced, it is this.    The problem is, they are not only mistranslating but also misinterpreting it.     Isaiah 53 actually starts with Chapter 52:13. In Hebrew, the scripture portions are divided by stumas. A space of several letters can be found at the closing of a passage before the next passage begins.     This can ONLY be found in a Hebrew Bible. By reading the passage in its entirety, you learn that God is speaking to his servant and that the servant shall prosper and be exalted and be very high (Isaiah 52:13).     Who is the "suffering servant'?  Christians say it is Jesus.    But in fact, it is Israel, as clearly shown in Isaiah 41:8 & 44:1-2 & 45:4. These verses continue to describe the amazement of the world when they see the Jewish people redeemed. In particular, they are written in an exclamatory fashion to describe how the nations "despised" the Jewish people and gave "no regard" for them. The reason it is written in the singular is because the Jews are regarded as one body, called "Israel." There are many instances of the Jewish people being referred to with a singular pronoun throughout the Torah.|`|qNkFMv8Naa	Im jewish.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Isaiah 53 is probably the most cited Scripture among Jewish believers in Jesus.      Until POPE LUTHER took the book out of the Bible, folks could see something very similar in Chapter 2 of the Book of Wisdom :    12   2 3 Let us beset the just one, because he is obnoxious to us; he sets himself against our doings, Reproaches us for transgressions of the law and charges us with violations of our training.   13   He professes to have knowledge of God and styles himself a child of the LORD.   14   To us he is the censure of our thoughts; merely to see him is a hardship for us,   15   Because his life is not like other men's, and different are his ways.   16   He judges us debased; he holds aloof from our paths as from things impure. He calls blest the destiny of the just and boasts that God is his Father.   17   Let us see whether his words be true; let us find out what will happen to him.   18   For if the just one be the son of God, he will defend him and deliver him from the hand of his foes.   19   With revilement and torture let us put him to the test that we may have proof of his gentleness and try his patience.   20   Let us condemn him to a shameful death; for according to his own words, God will take care of him."   21   These were their thoughts, but they erred; for their wickedness blinded them,   22   And they knew not the hidden counsels of God; neither did they count on a recompense of holiness nor discern the innocent souls' reward.|`|7kJFmyxdaa	Jesus Christ.

In actuality, Isaiah 53 directly follows the theme of chapter 52, describing the exile and redemption of the Jewish people. The prophecies are written in the singular form because the Jews ("Israel") are regarded as one unit. Throughout Jewish scripture, Israel is repeatedly called, in the singular, the "Servant of God" (see Isaiah 43:8). In fact, Isaiah states no less than 11 times in the chapters prior to 53 that the Servant of God is Israel. When read correctly, Isaiah 53 clearly [and ironically] refers to the Jewish people being "bruised, crushed and as sheep brought to slaughter" at the hands of the nations of the world. These descriptions are used throughout Jewish scripture to graphically describe the suffering of the Jewish people (see Psalm 44). Isaiah 53 concludes that when the Jewish people are redeemed, the nations will recognize and accept responsibility for the inordinate suffering and death of the Jews.|`|r8rykCkGaa	It's a wonderfully written chapter about Christ, most concerning his death and why, etc.  It's worth memorizing and it proves Jesus is the Messiah as well as other Scriptures and better.

2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Personally I don't think Ne  gro  is that bad. It's a lot better than that offensive word that rhymes with trigger.      Seems like things change all the time.  In 48 years, my ascribed race has been referred to a variety of names. When I was born in '61 (4 generations away from slavery) we were referred to as Ne  gro or even Ne gress believe it or not!  By the time I hit high school it became Black...although my high school transcripts have me listed as "colored."  By 1990, we were "African American" but am sometimes referred to as a "woman of color."  For a few years, I lived in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood, the Mexicans I lived near used to refer to me as a "morenita" if they liked me, or a "mayate" if they didn't.      Through it all, I just wished people could call me by my given name, not my perceived color of skin.|`|icTmbLjfaa	Well the word itself is not bad, its the way it is portrayed. the word has evolved.

Can you imagine the struggle and strife that our race has had to endure? So how could you say that it is a double standard when you do not live the struggle of our people? caucasian people do not have to struggle as we still do today. there can be no comparison with any other race.

MAAxboH7aa	Yes, Islam is a peaceful religion. Brother, you are misinterpreting what the Quran says.  One of Islam's principles is that prevention is better than cure. For the wife to be considered not submissive or nusyuz and warrants beating up, it takes a lot. The husband must first give multiple warnings before he can actually beat up his wife; and even then he cannot beat her up with more than one stroke. The ayat was included in the Quran in the hope that any woman who reads it will realise her role as a wife and the importance for her to be loyal to her husband, because in Islam a woman has an easier route to heaven in the first place; they only have to diligently execute all their ibadah wajib and be a good wife.    Yeah, there are some verses saying that we should slay Jews and Christians, but you're leaving out the subsequent ayats. It says we should attack Jews and Christians if they pose any harm upon us (read: Gaza and Hamas). Back in the days, Islam was the most powerful religion in the world and was under constant threat from the Romans and other religion's extremists.|`|6bC1HnyHaa	1  The Quraan enjoins good treatment of one's wife: she is to be honoured and treated kindly, even when one no longer feels love in one's heart towards her. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):     and live with them honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good    [al-Nisa 4:19]     2  The Quraan explains that women have rights over their husbands, just as their husbands have rights over them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):     And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them. And Allaah is All-Mighty, All-Wise    [al-Baqarah 2:228]     This verse indicates that the man has additional rights, commensurate with his role as protector and maintainer and his responsibility of spending (on his wife) etc.     3  The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined kind treatment and honouring of ones wife, and he described the best of people as those who are best to their wives. He said: The best of you are those who are the best to their wives, and I am the best of you to my wives. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3895; Ibn Maajah, 1977; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.     4  The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) spoke beautiful word concerning kind treatment of ones wife, stating that when the husband feeds his wife and puts a morsel of food in her mouth, he earns the reward of doing an act of charity. He said, You never spend anything but you will be rewarded for it, even the morsel of food that you lift to your wifes mouth. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6352; Muslim, 1628.     4  And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Fear Allaah with regard to women, for you have taken them as a trust from Allaah and intimacy with them has become permissible to you by the words of Allaah. Your right over them is that they should not allow anyone to sit on your furniture whom you dislike; if they do that then hit them but not in a harsh manner. And their right over you is that you should provide for them and clothe them on a reasonable basis. Narrated by Muslim, 1218.     What is meant by they should not allow anyone to sit on your furniture whom you dislike is that they should not allow anyone whom you dislike to enter your houses, whether the person disliked is a man or a woman, or any of the womans mahrams [close relatives to whom marriage is forbidden]. The prohibition includes all of them. From the words of al-Nawawi.     The hadeeth may be understood as meaning that a man has the right to hit his wife, in a manner that is not harsh and does not cause injury if if there is a reason for that, such as her going against his wishes or disobeying him.     This is like the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):     As to those women on whose part you see ill?conduct, admonish them (first), (next) refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allaah is Ever Most High, Most Great    [al-Nisa 4:34]     If a woman rebels against her husband and disobeys his commands, then he should follow this method of admonishing her, forsaking her in bed and hitting her. Hitting is subject to the condition that it should not be harsh or cause injury. Al-Hasan al-Basri said: this means that it should not cause pain.     Ata said: I said to Ibn Abbaas, what is the kind of hitting that is not harsh? He said, Hitting with a siwaak and the like. [A siwaak is a small stick or twig used for cleaning the teeth - Translator]     The purpose behind this is not to hurt or humiliate the woman, rather it is intended to make her realize that she has transgressed against her husbands rights, and that her husband has the right to set her straight and discipline her.     And Allaah knows best.|`|ae92e8a121c399eb3751b67c6557c92aaa	"Is Islam truly a religon of peace?"    No. Even muslims will tell you that islam is a religion of submission to Allah, not peace.|`|472e38086de52f52e7089f1f29ef15ddaa	It is the religion of taqiyya.    Muhammed ( peace be upon him ) describes how to perfect this religion by his own example.    By the way , in qur'an in arabic it says scourging ..not beating.  Look up the word scrourge to see what Muhammed wanted disobedient women to receive from the men who own them.  He himself condemned a pregnant women to be stoned ..but he made her wait until after the baby was born because he wanted to appear to be fair and merciful in his judgement of her. ( when I read the hadith i believed she had been wrongly accused of the crime and was unjustly punished in anycase by stoning .  Islam says it is not violent and then points to extreme violence in scriptures and criminal behavior worldwide to excuse its own violence while calling itself peaceful  Makes NO sense whatsoever and no one in islam is allowed to question the ridiculous premises made by this theocracy. )       In islam a woman is worth half a man..less than a dog or a donkey ..property to be used or seeded as a man who owns wants whenever he wants.     Most other religious practices evolve toward maturity as people come to understand the meaning of the word peace and change to leave evil ownership and torture and murder behind. ..Islam brags that it has not changed at all and by reading the qur'an in NON watered down english, it is easy to see it is not changed one tiny bit since Muhammed began it.  Muhammed hit Ayesha himself and also allowed other men to slap her around in his presence.     Islam still owns slaves, sex slaves ,etc.|`|373KJjiOaa	The empirical evidence indicates otherwise.|`|1MoPewupaa	Islam was made by a man....like any toher...man makes mistakes...and obiously arent perfect...except Jesus...now what the people made of him because of his teaching is were we leave off...the Islamic people today place muhhamed today in the seat of god...which  he is not. so thats why there are many confusions|`|PWankIUpaa	We know that it is NOt!|`|XPnIjCoEaa	This will be debated until the end of time. And the fact that you pinpointed these phrases as opposed to peaceful ones shows  the propaganda these days.  After 9/11, Islam has been studied and eace phrase has been put out in the open for the public to comment on. I do not advocate what happened on that day, but people have gotten a very warped idea of Muslims. And I guess, I cannot do anything about that. I know what it feels like. I wear the Muslim head scarf and people do look at me a little differently.  Islam is definitely a religion of peace, just as other religions are. I think you can find similar "violent" phrases in scriptures of other religions. The media is very one sided on this issue.  However, I think you should not be aksing this question on something so open like yahoo! answers. If you want a correct answer with examples I suggest you go to a Muslim Mosque and talk to someone there. This is a common question among non-Muslims and perhaps if you seek the advice of a Muslim expert, you will get the correct knowledge, and you can pass this on to others who do not understand Islam.|`|Nx8DG1YGaa	If you want to really know     Ask someone who really know ISLAM     Visit a mosque or Islamic center  Ask a shiekh     Do not ask Christians about ISLAM   Or Jews about Christianity     Ask the shekh for the follwoing :  When Mohamed conquered the city which exciled him & killed his friend & relaitvies for more than 10 years.

No ever  Ask why his enemies was keeping their precious stuff at him  When we escaped from a killing plot  He did not take it with him   He left Aly to return the stuff to their owners  Ask him what did he ordered his soldiers to do?    Ask about him to know the kindest person ever walked on the earth   Read about him to know what person he was .

I haven't read all about Islam either, but I'm sure there just as contradictory.|`|RVWyPicKaa	fredg     Did you know that back in the day in any other religion, that used to happen to a woman if she was not submissive? But because of how society is changing, many religions have changed their ways to fit in with society and claim themselves "free" and "not too harsh" and because many muslims have decided to preserve our teachings and the revelation of the qura'an that is why people are criticizing us muslims, not realizing that perhaps there religions had done worse.|`|PKULDaC7aa	Its about as peaceful as any other religion.|`|T0xLpygfaa	no it is not a religion of peace, it is a violent and repressive form of religion.|`|WdAuncq9aa	Islam is peace     ? The word "Islam" is closely related to the word "salam or silm" which means peace. Muhammad, sallallahu alayhe wa sallam, himself had a very peaceful nature, was extremely tolerant, and highly protective of the non-Muslim minorities living in the Muslim state.    However, there are times when states find war inevitable, but Islam only permits war in specific and dire circumstances. It keeps warfare at a level of mercy and respect for the enemy that no other army has been able to reach. The Prophet sometimes had to fight for the mere survival of his people and message, but once their security was ensured, he immediately reverted to peace and diplomacy.    There is a rigid code Muslims must abide by in deciding when they can fight and how the fighting should be conducted. War itself is despised, and is only a last-resort option when all other attempts at peace have been made.    A Muslim is never allowed to initiate hostilities. "And fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but transgress not the limits. Surely, Allah likes not the transgressors." [2: 190].    The only times in which believers are allowed to take up arms are when they are defending their own lives and the lives of their people, when they see the weak being oppressed in acts of tyranny, and when they are prohibited from practicing their religion:    "And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter. And fight not with them at the Inviolable Place of Worship until they first attack you there, but if they attack you (there) then slay them. Such is the reward of disbelievers." [2: 191].    "They question thee (O Muhammad) with regard to warfare in the sacred month. Say: Warfare therein is a great (transgression), but to turn (men) from the way of Allah, and to disbelieve in Him and in the Inviolable Place of Worship, and to expel His people thence, is a greater with Allah; for persecution is worse than killing. And they will not cease from fighting against you till they have made you renegades from your religion, if they can. And whoso be cometh a renegade and dieth in his disbelief: such are they whose works have fallen both in the world and the Hereafter, Such are rightful owners of the Fire: they will abide therein," [2:217].    Aside from these circumstances, there is no legitimate fighting in Islam.    The conditions placed upon the soldier in battle are of utmost respect for the enemy and for human life. Islam makes a clear distinction between combatants and noncombatants, forbidding soldiers to harm defenseless civilian in any way. The Prophet said: "Do not kill the women, children, aged or the ill." He also prohibited Muslims from harming monks in their monasteries or hermits in their caves. Cutting down trees, destroying livestock, wells, homes or land of the enemy is likewise forbidden. Upon seeing the corpse of a woman in a battlefield, Prophet Muhammad asked his companions why she had been killed, and condemned it.    There is no excuse for any expedition or attack resulting in the killing of civilians, no one has the right to take innocent lives.    For those enemies active in combat and those taken prisoner of war, the list of rights is lengthy. There is no torture, no killing of the wounded or defenseless, and the return of corpses to the enemy is honored. There is no mutilation of the enemy bodies. Even after Hind bint Utbah, a powerful lady of Makkah, chewed the liver of the Prophet's uncle, Hamzah, after he was killed in a battle between Muhammad and her non-Muslim people, Muhammad still forbade his men from disrespecting a creation of God in such a way    The Prophet commanded the believers to treat the prisoners of war with kindness. One prisoner by the name of Abu Aziz told how surprised he was to see the Muslims giving the better part of their meal-the bread-to the prisoners while they themselves just had dates. "Not a crumb of bread would fall into their hands without them giving it to me," he narrated, "and I would be so embarrassed that I would reject it. But then they would return it back to me."    The Qur'an lays down strict guidelines for the declaration of war by a Muslim army, and Muslims are prohibited from breaching any treaty to which they have agreed.  "If you fear treachery from any people throw back (their covenant) to them (so as to be) on equal terms (that there will be no more covenant between you and them), Certainly Allah likes not the treacherous. [8:58].    The extent of the Prophet's mercy can be seen in the Muslim conquest of Makkah, which happened towards the end of his life. The Makkan tribe of Quraish had blatantly violated the significant "Treaty of Hudaybiyya" by supplying men and arms in an effort to attack a Muslim-allied tribe. They had slaughtered ruthlessly, even killing inside the Holy Sanctuary, and knew they could expect retaliation for such a weighty crime.|`|GRAYktltaa	Any religion that says my husband has the right to hit me isn't a religion of peace, it's a religion of control.

It was written for people in the first century filled with imagery and symbols that only they can understand. It was not written for people 2000 years later. Because it was written for first century people, Paul did not need to explain the things he used because people already understood them. It is nearly impossible to understand most of this stuff unless we really really study it.    For example. One of the horsemen is the Antichrist right? Well consider other parts of the bible. 2 John 1:7 "Many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the Antichrist." How many people out there don't believe in Jesus? Billions. Or 1 John 2:18 which states that there have been many Antichrists already.    My point is, just don't take this too serious. Cause chances are, you will completely misinterpret it and look like one of those other Christian fundamentalists who don't know what they're talking about.|`|QIQNzE11aa	John was in a cave when he wrote those "Revelations". A cave known to have gasses in them that caused hallucinations, much like hallucinatory drugs now a days.     Many of those items can be attributed to what was happening in the world at that time. And truly, the Roman empire was totally destroyed finally.     If you want to read it as to what will truly happen to us? Think on this. God says that NO one will know when the end of times will be. So, how do these people always supposedly KNOW? As early as 62 BC people have claimed it was the end of times.... it happens just about every 10 years or so.. going to be the end of times. Remember when it was 1999 and everyone knew the end would be the year 2000? Now another date... A date that isn't even shared by all of the rest of the world. How is it that God would be wrong and that supposedly some would know the end of times and when it would be? Did God lie then?  Or did man lie about knowing it was the end of times. How many groups have killed themselves off for the end of times predictions over the last 100 years? Far too many.     Ok.. so lets pretend that God lied and that someone did know how the end of times would be. Even though God, Himself, claims no one will be wise of such things. So, God lied. Now, let's pretend that it wasn't a hermit who lived in a cave with hallucinogenic gasses. Let's pretend it wasn't about the times he was living in. Oddly enough, the Roman Empire was quartered and destroyed iteself due to the quartering. But let's pretend that has no bearing.     In Revelations it clearly says that there will be one leader and one religion at the end of times. So, 4 sections of the world would be be what is being stated by John in Revelations. One world nation, with one leader, with one religion is what is claimed at the end of times.     If you want to believe that hard into Revelations, why not just believe what it is saying. Why couldn't God send down four horsemen to usher in the apocolypse? Why believe in only parts of it? John also states that two men will come back from Heaven and will not be able to be harmed or killed until a certain date.     How do you know that the time has not already come? It does not state that the world will die off. It states that the devil will win  and rule here for 1000 years. Then it states that the devil will be thrown into the abyss for 1000 years while good reigns. Then the devil will be released again. BUt, there is a new heaven and a new earth.

These are the signs:    "While he was sitting upon the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached him privately, saying: Tell us, When will these things be, and what will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things??And in answer Jesus said to them: Look out that nobody misleads YOU; ?for many will come on the basis of my name, saying, I am the Christ, and will mislead many. ?YOU are going to hear of wars and reports of wars; see that YOU are not terrified. For these things must take place, but the end is not yet. ?For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another. ?All these things are a beginning of pangs of distress." -- Matt 24:3-8.    "But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. ?For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, ?having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, ?betrayers, headstrong, puffed up [with pride], lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, ?having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power; and from these turn away." --2 Tim 3:1-5.    Do we not see these things happening world wide?|`|2Gve5Xigaa	yeahh.  but NOT quiete yet,|`|elVryMQUaa	Not for a second, didn't Jesus say some of his followers would live to see the end?

According to the Bible writers, ONE SUREST SIGN of Jesus coming back and the Rapture? is the slaughter of innocent children in the end of days! The Bible writers made it into a pattern that before any major event in Bible stories innocent children get slaughtered right and left! This is a primitive trick to scare the heck out of religious people into catching their attention! They wrote that before Israel was liberated from Egypt (there is not a trace of historical evidence that the Jews were ever slaves in Egypt, but what the heck!) God had ALL the innocent first born children of Egyptian parents slaughtered on the spot without any mercy! When Jesus was born in Judea ALL the innocent male children 2 years of age and under got slaughtered in a way that not even God the Holy Ghost was able to comfort the grieving mothers! It was a massacre of humongous proportions unlike Hitlers holocausting the Jews! (Mat 2:18) So it will be when Jesus comes back a lot of the wrong Churches will loose ALL their CHILDREN The Jewish Messiah Jesus Christ will have them slaughtered not in Babylon, but in the Churches! Christians are brainwashed into believing that Jesus doesnt do that! As far as sadistic religions go not even Islam can match Christianity! It is all in the Bible! Now Christianity survives picking on new sins like abortion, equal sex marriages, stem cell research, etc. Even the newly elect President Obama honors the Most Reverend Pastor Dick Warren damning gays, equal sex marriage and so on! In fact, soon the Clergy will visit Obama to force him to comply with some popular Christian dogmas, or else he wont be re-elected!     Revelation 2:23 (NIV) (Jesus says in his apocalyptic REVELATION NOW for the last days) I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD* (*Abortionists deal only with the fetus when necessary so they cant beat Jesus at killing babies! Jesus is doing the killing of the innocent children to announce his expected return and at the same time teach everybody a lesson on WHO IS THE BOSS! In our society today Christians are very selective in what they want to believe from the Bible! Their political PRO-LIFE stand is only an attempt to disassociate from this kind of Jesus REVELATION!) Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW* (*Bully Mafia talk) that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.    Im the BOSS says Jesus Christ the LORD and I take it on the kids in the Churches! This make believe Bible Jesus is promoting the killing of children of the wrong Christian brand to set an EXAMPLE! All Christians claim to be of the right faith! Most of them will be up for a big surprise! Jesus infanticide mania comes from way back when the Jewish Bible writers had God the Father highly favoring anyone killing the innocent children of his enemies!     Psalm 137:8-9 (NIV) O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us* (*Israel) --he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.    That is why Jesus Christ knows that the enemies of TRUE Christianity (whatever that is) ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them! In Bible times hardly anybody practiced abortions because it was easier and much safer to dash the infants against the rocks after they are born than having them aborted. Unwanted children were put out without any accountability to anybody right after they were born like it was done in Egypt to the willing Hebrew ladies. Christianity is not much of a civilized religion at all!     Luke 19:27 (NIV) (Jesus is very excited telling this story most Christians prefer to ignore, although the Clergy and the Westboro class Christians love it!) But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over thembring them here and kill them in front of me.    I'm telling you what the HOLY BIBLE writers say...!!! ESPECIALLY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT that is strongly believed in Christianity today...!!!!    The Bible writers made Christianity into a very violent religion. Turning the other cheek is a joke! They have Jesus suggesting the slaughter by drowning of anybody causing a Christian who is a moron in the Faith to stumble (Mat 18:6) The shedding of body parts to make it into the Fairy Kingdom of Heaven! (Mat 5:29-30), INCLUDING male castration (Mat 19:12). The carving out of the female clitoris today is still widely done by the local butchers and practiced almost exclusively in Islam! Christian ladies in America are very lucky! BTW virginity and male castration is forbidden in Gods Law Be fruitful and multiply, but what the heck! Nunnery stuff is a Heathen sourced idea of the Early Church Fathers. Most Christians today dont pay attention to Jesus gory suggestions, but throughout history many Christians got castrated for the Kingdom Sake. See Wikipedia castration. Christians are very gullible and willing to do anything that their preachers tell them. Christianity survives today only because it is disregarding most of the primitive and uncivilized pronouncements of the Early Church Fathers. Now the Clergy promote the be good, get well, get rich quick, pay your tithes and offerings on time and when you die you go to Heaven to be with Jesus! In fact, Christians are promised that at the moment that they will see Jesus they will be transformed to be like HIM!!! Like this children killing JESUS! Please give me a break!|`|R4dcGCVDaa	Only God knows.|`|buiHdl0Gaa	Yes - a lot of people - but they're nuts - and don't even know what that means.

To avoid offending citizens of the countries that IMHO practice racism, I shall refrain from name the countries.|`|WUuO6wbAaa	I think it's kind of unnecessary. There's a lot less importance put on it in Canada than in America. In Canada, they actually give you the choice of being a ''visibile minority'' or not on Census forms. In America, the contradictions are countless. For one, our Census made up the term ''Hispanic'' in 1970, but barely anyone knew what it meant at the time. In the 1970 Census, 5 percent of people just marked ''South American'', because loads of white southerner's actually thought that was their ethnicity. By 1980, people had a better idea of what it meant. By 1990 and 2000, it was in full effect, but in 2000, the government craftily revoked it from being a ''race.'' Yet the media never mentioned that and claimed in that same year that ''Hispanics'' were the largest minority in the U.S. How can you be a ''racial minority'' if the government doesn't acknowledge it was a ''race?''    In America, you don't have a choice in ''minority status.'' In Canada, Australia, most of Europe and in the rest of the modern world, it is a choice. For example, 3/4 of Latin American Canadians don't consider themselves to be racial minority. Yet more than 80 percent of Arabics consider themselves this. Meanwhile, in America, Middle Easterners would be considered ''white'', without choice. Meanwhile, if you asked the average white American if Saddam Hussein was white, they'd probably tell you no and occasionally freak out on you.    ''Race'' is a human creation. It's not biological. I'm ''white'' and of Italian background, but we bleed the same color. The systems of ''white'', ''black'' and ''Asian'' are formed out of multiple continents coming together. It's a product of colonialism, imperialism, greed and hate.    The truth is though, if you're a Chinese immigrant to Canada, you, or your parents chose to voluntarily move there. It may have taken patience to wait to get to do this too. Therefore, this is where you chose to live, for the better or worst.    Also, Canada is a bi-lingual country. Their country actually expects most immigrants to speak French and English, if possible, so you aren't vulnerable in any part of America. America is an English speaking country. We have territories, such as Puerto Rico, which are primary Spanish speaking territory, as well as some officially bilingual communities in southern Texas, but you really only need to know English in America. In Canada, if you plan on not being in Quebec or parts of New Brunswick, I guess you could say the same thing.    Honestly, I agree with much of what you're saying about racial classification systems. It perpetuates class. I don't think most American's see through the lines on this issue though. American's rely too much on the media for their thinking. The amount of independent thinking goes down by the year with technology in this country. People are lazy. There's exception to this, of course, but the overwhelming majority of American's are clueless simpletons who rely on labels to get by. Just put on CNN and see if a complicated discussion ever comes up. Words like ''conservative'' and ''Democrat'' are about the furthest complication they can handle. American's love being spoon fed too. Sadly, I'm an American telling you this. The second things begin to get complicated, people complain.    Also, there's large differentiations between Canada and America culturally. For example, 59 percent of the U.S. considers religion to be significant. Only 30 percent of Canadian's do, which is actually 3 percent less than England. America's around 2 or 3 percent formally Atheist, meanwhile 17 percent of Canada is. Canada's a much more liberal, intelligent and peaceful country than we are. They have more in common with Europe, Japan, Australia and other modern world country's than they do with us.

vDIBCj1vaa	Lol I totally see what you mean girlfriend see, I live in India, and the culture here is totally different, and this pastor tried to convince me to not have guy friends or even talk to the opposite sex, And that falling in love before marriage is totally wrong!!     See, you dont have to listen to what people say, look in the bible yourself. I dont remember where but it does say somewhere that when you do something in faith, its not a sin.    Pray for god to show you the right guy, and when youre going out with someone think of them as a friend. The bible does say that looking at a person with lust is sin, but it doesnt say that evaluating a person as a future spouse is wrong.     Hope I helped. :) Will pray for you. Love in Christ, Jay.|`|hJX6Ur3taa	It doesn't say anywhere in the Bible that you shouldn't have a boyfriend.  It does say however that if you don't have to get married don't.  But what the guy was trying to explain is that when we get a boyfriend, there are feelings of what we think are love, but it is actually a new and exciting feeling.  Most of these are because of sexual desires.  But when you have been with the same person for a few years, those types of feels seem to disappear.  We can't always rely on our feelings to tell us what is right.  Marriage is a lifelong commitment to love another person regardless of their shortcomings.  Marriage is not easy and we should not take it lightly.  This will be the person that after you have been married to for a while, that starts to do things that drive you nuts.  The real meaning of love is to be understanding and patient with someone even when they drive you crazy.  If you have patience and ask God to help you and your spouse, you can have a lasting relationship, after all the googly eye, kissy face phase is over.  This type of love and commitment is what keeps marriages together.  I hope this helps.|`|lXgCj1RJaa	I hate to contradict another answer, but dating did not start with the first car; cars led to a new kind of dating, but dating (or "stepping out") goes back way before the automobile. That said, the kind of romantic relationship you are talking about is relatively new (using the age of the Bible as a yardstick) and was pretty much invented by the romantic poets of a few centuries ago. The idea of marrying someone for love would not, in olden times, have been regarded as the norm. Marriage was invented to create a stable environment in which to raise children. This has ceased to be the case nowadays, but don't fall into the trap of judgeing other ages by the standards of our age; you only have to go back to the 1950s to realise that people from the past are more alien than anything in science fiction.|`|u4af7B2Iaa	You can have a boyfriend/girlfriend; the point is just to not have pre-marital sex.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Don't ask that man anything else.  Nowhere in the bible does it say that you can't have a boyfriend.|`|RKQTD9Dhaa	Don't let anyone define love for you.  It is subjective.    By the way, one of the easiest ways to scare even a nice guy off is to start talking about marriage from the beginning.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	It doesnt.. but you should not put yourself in the position of lusting or fornication.  It does say no sex outside of marriage..... are you guilty???|`|AA11598520	Sounds a bit backward to me. Sure, you can have 10 boyfriends but only 1 husband; the difference would be the commitment you make to each other and to God.     I agree with you that you won't find a husband if you don't date. Our society doesn't do arranged marriages anymore. Love is a feeling shown through action as well as words. You can't love someone if you don't know them.    I agree that sex should be saved for marriage or at least until you know who the person is that you will spend your life with. You don't need to have sex to find out if you love someone enough to want to spend a life with them. Really, if you think about it, sex takes up a very small part of a marriage so it's important to know a lot more about that person and like what you know to spend a lifetime together.|`|bsHkZH1kaa	yes, called the commandments in the old testament.  The thing called dating is very new; it started when the first car was made; before that at your age you would be getting married and wouldn't have to date.  It was unlawful for a man and woman to be together out of wedlock or unmarried and it is still against the law; God's Law/Ten Commandments.  The 5 books written on the Law of Moses; 5 first books in the bible.  You can be friends, but nothing more.  Because first starts a kiss; then it leads on.  Friends and that is it.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	Love is an active emotion that compels someone to serve someone or something.  It is fine to have a boyfriend and learn about them, except sexually of course.  There were period where marriages were arraigned and times when they were not. Isaac got his wife under a somewhat "arraignment", Jacob worked for them. David courted them and married.    They should be your friend before your husband.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	bible does not say you can not have a boyfriend or girlfriend    it says no sex until marriage.    having a boyfriend or girlfriend does not mean it is ok to engage in any kind of sex or touching.|`|2ogimlBxaa	Whoever told you that is kinda crazy. Of course you have to date before you get married. This guy sounds like he's going to be single for a long time.     Date all you want, and ignore the crazy person.|`|hj76FSKdaa	I think the idea comes mostly from a book written by Josh Harris called "I kissed Dating Goodbye."|`|F4Wu6JXyaa	Sorry, no intention of offending you, but    "The definition of love is to express affectionate feelings for a certain person."    is an extremely shallow definition, even in English, for that verb.  Do you think that when Jesus speaks of love in scripture, or Paul speaks of love, that's what they are talking about?  Expressing affectionate feelings?      Love is a deliberate act of will; it requires discipline.  A person who loves another works for the happiness, health, and growth of that other; a person who loves another gets joy from giving joy to the other.  Look up the passage in Corinthians that begins: Love is patient, love is kind...  It doesn't apply only to boyfriend/girlfriend relationships.|`|LG1IkLUJaa	well i have to tell you it doesn't say anything in the bible about having a boyfriend/girlfriend. But i have to tell you, you don't have to hold hands too know a person. here below is link you can look at if you want more info.|`|ReH5EoR0aa	Wow looks like you have a strong sense of morals, and that is great!    Seems like this person doesn't know and is trying to find something to answer your question anyway.      In bible days,  parents chose wives and husbands for their kids.  The kids usually didn't even know the other person.   That was a cultural thing.  There were also harems,  guys had lots of wives and hundreds of children sometimes.   It was important to know who the children belonged to, without DNA testing at that time.  So, virginity was  1.  No sex before marriage to the stranger.   If a girl did, she was stoned to death.  They still do that there, in some areas.    The law was also, if your husband died, his brother had to take you on as his wife and raise your kids as his own.    All kinds of ancient laws that people forget no longer apply in this day and age.      I think people hold on to these old ideas because there really aren't any new moral codes any more.   They might use only a few of the rules they pick and ignore the others.  Doesn't seem right to me.      The bible days had plenty of moral codes and rules to live by, like how to prepare food and when to eat it, etc.  We don't do that any more either.       The only moral code I know of now, is called the "Way to Happiness", and it is going into all the schools and places where a bible is not allowed, since it is a legal, non religious moral code that follows bible rules but makes sense in todays times.|`|Sxlcyua5aa	The answer is no where in the bible does it say that you cannot have a boy friend or girl friend.   Love can be many things, but in the bible it is an action.    It is what you do unconditionally for your spouse.   The feelings that you have with a boy friend or girl friend involve lust.   And that is what everyone has to control.   We all lust and we need to control these feelings in order to find that potential spouse.   Lust alone does not make a good husband or wife.   It is the qualities that they have that we are to look at in determining who we want to be with.   Just keep in mind that when you do find that boy friend that you pay close attention to him after you have been dating for several weeks.   Then they start to get comfortable with you and start letting down their guard, showing you their true colors.   This is when you decide if his flaws are worth living with.   If they are not then move on.   Good luck.|`|bfP9vz9Naa	No where in the bible does it say that you can't have a boyfriend/girlfriend.  Steady dating and getting to know each other is a healthy way to choose a spouse.     However the modern practice of teenagers parring off as boyfriend and girlfriend is kind of stupid if your not old enough to be looking for marriage, you should date because it's important to learn how to socialize with the opposite sex but you shouldn't pair off for two reasons.  One it limits your opportunities to meet new people and make new friends and learn what you like and don't like in a potential mate.  If you just go with the first guy who comes around you haven't made a very informed decision and you've locked yourself off from other contacts at a time when you're not ready to be married and so not ready to be seriously dating either.  Second, yeah it's a premarital sex thing.  If your always hanging out with the same guy then you get comfortable with each other and stuff can (not saying it will saying it can) happen.

Open discussion can never be bad and is often very good.    I find that I do learn a lot from theists on forums like this and this has influenced my thinking of the subject of religion.

That is something that has to be acknowledged.     I come here because I want to know more about how that belief in God influences the way people think and their view of the world.

And my honesty can only be attributed to the God of the Bible.         You are entitled to your own opinions, but so are Christians, but you can TEST the God of the Bible anytime in your life, and if your heart is right, God will bless you.  You know the drill ma'am.  Simply repent, that is to say, give an account of your sins and your sincere apology for them, and KNOW that there is a God!  The TEST  is that when you see the results of what God can do in your life, all the positive things that occur in your life from that point, you should know that God is working in your life.  If you stray , you should come to realize that God will leave your presence until you return and try again until you get it right.         As for the "atheists" on R&S, I have no problems with telling them the same thing.  I have no problems with answering their many sincere and serious questions, but you can go on any R&S page and count the real, sincere and serious questions and you will be amazed how many are there just ridiculing and mocking Christians and the many other religions.  What intrigues me more is how much of the mocking and ridiculing is directed specifically towards Christians alone.  That may be merely because there are so many Christians defending the Word of God   TEST GOD  In God's love  Cajunboy
UIJorsD7aa	Shabbos or Shabbat is s the weekly Sabbath or day of rest in Judaism, Seventh-day Adventism, or Seventh Day Baptism, starting at sundown on Friday till sundown on Saturday, symbolizing the seventh day in Genesis, after the six days of creation. Though it is commonly said to be the Saturday of each week, it is observed from sundown on Friday until the appearance of three stars in the sky on Saturday night.     For more:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabat|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	I thought it was the Sabbath?    "Saturday, Donny, is Shabbos, the Jewish day of rest."|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	It was a terrific idea, thought up by slaves to get a day off.|`|AA11114869	...

Shema Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength, and your neighbor as yourself.|`|TVJsOEKNaa	Shabbat is the Jewish day of rest and begins at sundown on Friday evening, until sundown on Saturday evening.      Judaism follows a lunar calendar, not a Gregorian one, and it is important to note that Genesis says: "There was night, then there was day" a number of times to elaborate this point.    It's often said that "Jews didn't keep Shabbos, rather Shabbos kept the Jews", meaning, Shabbos kept many from straying away from Judaism and is literally a time to relax and let weekly worries and cares rest. The purpose is to commemorate the day God rested.    Jews primarily do not work on Fridays/Saturdays because of the amount of preparation that is done for this observance weekly.    It is a time when people invite guests to their home and spend time with family without any distractions (no television, computer, radio etc..).  People go to Synagogue, discuss Torah in the home, and of course eat awesome food!    Shabbos involves main two concepts:    1) Remembering: In Hebrew, zakhor  2) Observing all 39 commandments: In Hebrew, shomer    Customs and food:    Challah (braided bread), cholent, kugel, wine and any kind of feast foods are generally prepared.    Here is a link with different foods/recipes:  http://www.aish.com/shabbatrecipes/    The holiday is started with the lighting of candles.  One waves their hands over the candles three times and covers their eyes while reciting a prayer. It is also a tradition to bless children during this time.    Here is a video that shows how it's done:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kb-LcBU1...    Basically, after Synagogue people say prayers for the food/wine and begin eating.  People talk about everything, children play around the table, and others stay late until saying their goodbyes.    The next day people attend Synagogue again, discuss and read Torah, sleep, and spend time with their children during the day.    There is one last service in the evening before Shabbos is concluded and the "Havdalah" (ceremony to separate Shabbos from a regular day) is performed.      This video explains shows the process of Havdalah:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlV-raq52...|`|xgNqU41Vaa	idk i am a muslim|`|KVBTtF9faa	A day or rest and worship for the jews.

YvvnTrxDaa	I was in Tunisia in the 90s, I passed by the Camel innocently.  It cocked it's head winked and eye and glob!! hit me right in the chest.  I growled in annoyance and with a great gurgling and a bringing back of my head, letting out a cry and Spat at the beast betwixt it's eyes.  The Camel bit the dust and it's great bulk sent sand from the ground up into the air.    I then ran,  a crowd of suited coated Camel handlers on my trail.  Thinking quickly I ripped off my wooden leg and made my escape down the near by river.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	the camel at disneyworld spit on me.|`|dCewrtXaaa	A camel can and will outspit you any day of the week. Bigger, nastier, and stickier. Always a losing battle if you are fool enough to engage in it. And camels, like llamas, wage preemptive war. They will spit at you even if you don't spit first. Rather like Bush in Iraq.|`|fa8Ch1yKaa	LOL this made my day.  I'm not sure.. he may grunt at you.

I would beat the breaks off them and then molly whop them in the mouth with my genitalia...|`|zHX9tlnWaa	Yes, they do. My fiance grew up with camels and he said they spit back at you! Who would of thought...|`|XxPhbwNfaa	Below this explanation are 2 links to utube and camels spitting    Myth  2    "Watch out for camels or they'll spit on you when you aren't looking!"    There are two misrepresentations in the statement above. First, camels do not spit frequently and only do so when provoked. Second, they do not really truly "spit" since the substance they are spraying is not saliva.     This is a photograph of a Dromedary camel native to the deserts of Africa and the Middle East, but also commonly found in North America and Australia.  The warning statement above is a bit extreme. Camels do not spit unless they become agitated and upset. Camels that are trained and handled on a regular basis are usually very cooperative animals and very rarely will "spit." Animals that are worked with less frequency tend to be more resistant, and when forced to do things they are not accustomed to doing have been know to spray the agitator.    What camels do is not really spitting in the sense that humans spit. Agitators do get sprayed, but they are not being sprayed with saliva. When a person spits what they are really doing is forcing saliva out of their mouth with a rush of air. To focus the spray, humans will contract their lips making a smaller opening and resulting in more air pressure.    What a camel does is entirely different. Instead of emitting saliva, camels will emit some of the partially digested contents of one of the chambers of their fore-stomachs. Similar to cows, camels are ruminants. When they get mad they will burp up some of their cud (the semi-digested contents of their fore-stomach). Once this is in their mouth they flapped their heads. The cud slides out of their mouth onto their limp, droopy lips which then fling the cud into the air. In this way they can completely cover the upper half of a human. The color of their "spit" is tied to their recent dietary intake. If the animal has been eating grass or alfalfa it will be greenish.     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrod6hl4o...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WQuRCWnh...

That almost look like a man?    I find it absurd as well. they get women with arms no bigger round than a 2 year olds arm and i am supposed to believe they could hit a guy so hard he's out cold? A big, strong, body builder type??     It's comedy and action put together. Watch that sickly Angelina and know that the man would have killed her in a moment, that she probably had a hard enough time standing through a strong wind. But it's all in fun.

o9cAl8xhaa	You just need to get out and meet lots of new people- join some LGBT organizations, teams, or clubs. Try to expand your circle of friends and acquaintances. Get friends to talk about you to other eligible guys they know. Sooner or later you'lll meet a special guy and things will 'click.'    As part of this, be sure to talk and associate with all types and ages of guys. While they themselves may not be your 'type' they may have a friend- who knows? And you have established yourself as someone who is decent and not stuck up.    Someone is out there, and probably just as frustrated as you. There are a lot of decent guys around that have given up and don't get out at all.|`|eDgVY0sAaa	because they're all taken. Dude you'll find the right guy you just aint looking in the right places.

It sounds like you might be battling with depression  Here are some symptoms of depression, and warning signs of suicide:    Saying things like:        * "I shouldn't be here."      * "I'm going to run away."      * "I wish I were dead."      * "I'm going to kill myself."      * "I wish I could disappear forever."      * "If a person did this or that... would he/she die?"      * "The voices tell me to kill myself."      * "Maybe if I died, people would love me more."      * "I want to see what it feels like to die."      * "My parent's won't even miss me."      * "My boy/girlfriend wont care anyway."    If you are feeling this way, you really do need to get some professional help. The first step is to make one call.

Moved to another state, far far away from my first home and family and friends,  ditched the original career choice.    It DID help.      I rather think sometimes radical changes are good for me.  Why should I have stayed in the rut I was in?    Maybe take a good hard look at your life- and uncomplicate it as much as possible.

Allah Says:     And I did not Create the jinn and humans except they should worship Me. [Noble Quran 51:56]    He created us for the purpose of worshiping Him, Alone and without any partners.     And He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds. But if you were to say to them: "You shall indeed be raised up after death," those who disbelieve would be sure to say, "This is nothing but obvious magic." [Noble Quran 11:7]    Allah has created all we call the universe as a test for us. This is not our final destination. What we might consider to be "bad" or "good" could actually be quite the opposite.     Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion, and He has the Ability to do all things.   (He's the One) Who has created death and life, so He may test you which of you is best in deed. And He is the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving;   (He's the One) Who has created the seven heavens one above another, you can see no fault in the creations of the Most Beneficent. Then look again: "Can you see any rifts?"   Then look again and yet again, your sight will return to you in a state of humiliation and worn out. [Noble Quran 67:1-4]    The Quran tells us about the nature of mankind and how quickly we forget the many wonderful blessings provided to us daily. Allah describes our attitude clearly in His Quran:     And when some hurt touches man, he cries to his Lord (Allah Alone), turning to Him in repentance, but when He bestows a favor upon him from Himself, he forgets that for which he cried for before, and he sets up rivals to Allah, in order to mislead others from His Path. Say: "Take pleasure in your disbelief for a while: surely, you are (one) of the dwellers of the Fire!" [Noble Quran 39:8]     We forget, as we were created to forget. And this is a part of our test. Will we only use a selective memory and overlook what we owe to our Creator and Sustainer? Or will we be appreciative even when we are suffering some hardship or setback in this life?     As for mankind, whenever his Lord tests him giving him honor and gifts, he says (bragging): "My Lord honors me."   But whenever He tests him by withholding his livelihood, he says: "My Lord has disgraced me!" [Noble Quran 89:15-16]     Then Allah makes clear to us the real reasoning behind all that is taking place:     Nay! But (it is because) you do not treat orphans with kindness and generosity.   And you do not encourage feeding of the poor!   And you devour inheritance with greed,   And you love wealth with abounding love! [Noble Quran 89:17-20]    Allah has created us and given us so much, yet we are so careless concerning His Right to be worshipped exclusively and deny the Day of Judgment wherein we will all be asked concerning His Generosity.     O man! What has made you careless concerning your Lord, the Most Generous?   Who created you, fashioned you perfectly, and gave you due proportion;   In whatever form He willed, He put you together.   Nay! But you deny the Recompense (reward for good deeds and punishment for evil deeds). [Noble Quran 82:6-9]     And how will we view our condition and surroundings? And how will we treat others around us? Are we considerate of others and are we quick to blame or quick to forgive? All of these things are a part of our test, the things we will be asked about on the Day of Judgment.    Allah could have put everyone in their respective places from the very beginning, but the people would complain as to why they were thrown in Hell without being given a chance. This life is exactly that; a chance to prove to ourselves who we really are and what we would really do if we indeed had a free choice.    Allah Knows everything that will happen, but we don't. That is why the test is fair.

There is  no logical reason for having "women's" clothes and "men's clothes.   Women wear "mens" clothes (pants etc) all the time and no one automatically thinks they are lesbians or bi.

j5uO9LL7aa	You and others here are not going to appreciate my thoughts, but here they are anyhow.      I think it would be beneficial for blacks and nonblacks alike to discuss the causes and negative repurcussions of false education and propaganda.  I'm applying it here to black history, cause that's what the question is about, but ultimately I think these topics should be discussed in terms of all history.      For example, why are many kids wrongly taught that black people invented the light bulb and traffic light?  Does this not actually belittle the true work of Lewis Latimer and Garrett Morgan?  Is the truth not much more interesting?  Why do you think people do this, and what do you think the result of teaching such not-quite-the-truths could be?  What can be done to improve the veracity of such lessons and interest students to the more amazing true stories of black inventors?    Why are many kids taught that the slave trade was an evil perpetuated solely by whites?  If we are to ensure history does not repeat itself, is it not more appropriate to teach the truth?  Should we not discuss the involvement of nonwhites in the capture, sale, and transport of slaves?  Should we not discuss nonwhite slave owners in the US?  Of those kids that are taught of nonwhite slave owners, what are we gaining by teaching them that blacks owned slaves solely to liberate their families, when slave narratives and court records show otherwise?    These are just a few of many examples I have on this issue.  On first glance, I'm sure that the reaction of many will be to be offended or debate facts.  But let me clarify that I am an unbiased historian, and am very much aware of the impact of blacks in America and throughout the globe.  I am also, however, aware of the negative effects of outright lies or lies of omission, unnecessary exagerations (unnecessary because the actual truth tends to be just as admirable and interesting), and propaganda.    The counterweapon to a "Eurocentric" view of history is not to be just as biasely ethnocentric, dishonest, or omitting as those who wrote the Eurocentric history books.  Kids of all colors deserve more.|`|24cde8bf3f4cbca12a1379054950f95aaa	what decade did african americans make the largest strides and why?what has worked to advance african americans and what have been the draw backs? do you have a different opinion of white americans for helping (by the largest numbers)to elect barack obama? hope this helps sounds like a great night|`|aaRMPDIDaa	Well, yesterday, on 107.5 fm in Ohio, the DJ had a question of the day....He (a black male) asked "Should we get rid of black history month?" and his reasoning behind this question was the following:    Days like sweetest day, and St. Patricks day are more publicized than black history month.  He claimed that schools (colleges and highschools) don't do much at all for black history month, and all in all, it seems like people don't care about black history month, so should we just get rid of it?    It spawned a TON of very interesting answers.  My favorite answer was from a gentlemen who resides in Columbus and LA.  He said "We are making black history every day...ex: Barack Obama becoming president, etc...and he spoke of some other important obstacles that black people have overcome." He beleived that people shouldn't be upset that it is only a month.  People should be proud that America has recognized the importance of african american heritage....he said "let us have our thing in February"    I found that very interesting...it was a very contraversial question.|`|0hsh000waa	What progress still needs to be made?

0NOiAlJOaa	You don't seem to understand ......Both men and women are created in the image and likeness of God (Gen. 1:26). Simple reproduction is not the only reason God created the two distinct sexes of the human race. God created humans for a far, far greater purpose, destiny and potential than animals. Genesis 1:26 begins to hint at the incredible truth that humans were created to one day enter in the eternal, spirit family of Godthe God Family!   God is the One who created the institutions of human marriage and the family. Human marriage and family life are the very type (i.e., the picture or human-plane representation) of the coming marriage of the Fathers Son, Jesus Christ, to His bridewhich presently is comprised of humans in the Church of God. Human marriage includes the close, intimate relationship between a man and a womantwo similaryet very differentgenders made in Gods image. This intimate relationship is allowed by God ONLY within the marriage relationship, and ONLY between a married man and woman because of what it is all picturing and foreshadowing in Gods plan and creation.|`|QIQNzE11aa	One persons interpretation is not always another persons.     Does it really matter what a man wrote that got into the bible? In the end, God wrote none of the Bible, nor does He claim to have. It's a guideline, supposedly by the good and just, on what they felt was right or wrong. In the end, i can't take someoen's word about Heaven who wasn't there, and if they were still alive enough to write, then they weren't in Heaven.     I've done the whole death thing and came back. So i know what i believe is right.     In every tale of death, those you knew and love are always there, waiting for you. Can you simply ignore that?     Never dedicate your entire life to someone else. That wouldn't be good for anyone. I am very happily married, never would consider cheating, never would do a thing to destroy my marriage in any way. But i still work on having time for me in life. And how is being loved and giving love in this world unworthwhile ever?|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	The bible does not say in heaven male and female will not matter.  It does say there won't be marriage in heaven.  The bible does not indicate that we won't know each other in heaven, either.  I do believe we will know each other.  So if you are a born again Christian and so is the one you love, I have little doubt you will know each other for eternity; but it will not be an earthly, "marriage" relationship.      I don't consider anything I do here a waste of time by the way.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	The earthly marriage is a picture of the heavenly  marriage between the believer and the Lord Jesus Christ  :)|`|DRSv6SOLaa	Of course not!!

In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize his or her divine destiny as an heir of eternal life.

But there is ONLY 1 GOD  From the first beginning till the end of the world   He was never born.  He does not have wife.  He does not have son.  There is nothing like him whatsoever  He created everything from the tiny electron to the huge galaxies.   He created humans to worship him & ONLY him.  He does not want or need any thing from humans except that worship voluntarily.    As a Muslim I believe that:  If my wife & me were good & lucky enough so that GOD let me go to heaven with his mercy.  She will be my wife in the heaven   But not on her human shape  She will be as EVE in her beauty  She will be very beautiful   So our marriage on earth will continue to the heaven   Also, she will help me and herself to meet in the heaven   May Allah bless all of Muslims and meet us all with prophet Mohamed , Jesus ,Moses and all prophets in his heaven|`|e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	I don't recall a verse saying that male and female will not matter.  I believe that Jesus said we would not be given in marriage IN heaven.  He then proceeded to give his apostles the authority to seal on earth and it would be sealed in heaven.  If married under that authority, the bonds endure for more than a lifetime.    Matthew 16:19 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.|`|PzLNmecsaa	because we are just human and God will forgive us and Bible does not say not to marriage.|`|fccb1a44398bcc77a8a9270a1df27cefaa	Dear Friend,    The language of the scriptures should be studied carefully. The terms used in your question is NOT an abolishment of communion or bonds of marriage, but in heaven such bonds begun on earth will be fully realized (celarly expressed, lived, and fulfilled) in heaven.        What the scriptures are getting at is no longer will the status of either being male or female be used to show domination or superiority over the other. Both male in female are equal in dignity (as the Church still teaches) and the compatibility of their natures will be fulfilled by God in heaven (the ability to acheive communion beyond what we are used to i.e. marriage and sex).         The bonds God creates and man and woman enter into will be there, but once again a much grander and more indepth communion than we are used to on earth. Hence, Jesus' words, "In heaven they (man and woman) are not given to one another in marriage. Why? Because in heaven there is already the full communion marriage is demonstrating on earth.          The sacramental bonds of marriage between a man and woman are a visible symbol of the unseen reality. A man and woman meet and demonstrate affections and commitment to one another, but can you tell me what the love between them looks like? Of course not it is unseen. However, we know the reality of love between them exists. So, it is with sacraments like marriage. They are the visible symbol of the invisibile reality. In heaven we will no longer need symbols, but already become the reality that is signified through them.            Also, in heaven no one forgets who they are or who they know. Ask yourself. Do you forget the one's you love? Of course not. You still remember them and know them. And since God is love, then can God and anyone of us be forgotten and unimportant?            I hope this has been helpful. May the Lord bless and keep you. May the light of His face shine upon you.

You don't need a priest.    However, I'd imagine that priests hearing confessions would be under the same privacy practices as counselors: they can't release anything you tell them unless it causes imminent danger to yourself or others. (ie: they CAN go to the authorities if you tell them you plan on murdering your mother and then killing yourself or if you threaten self harm or suicide or something.)    However, I'm not sure the laws on that, so if you're that worried, check it out before you say anything.

During this life, the spirit of the individual is housed in a physical body, which was born of mortal parents.      The scriptures teach that at the time of physical death, the spirit does not die. It separates from the body and lives in the postmortal spirit world. At the time of resurrection, the spirit is reunited with the body, "never to be divided; thus the whole becoming spiritual and immortal" (Alma 11:45).     The scriptures also teach about the nature of spirits. Through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord revealed that "all spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes" (D&C 131:7). The Lord also revealed that "the spirit of man [is] in the likeness of his person, as also the spirit of the beast, and every other creature which God has created" (D&C 77:2; see also Ether 3:716).|`|JCnSm91uaa	In your case it probably looks like a square block!

I think the spirit fits inside the body like a hand in a glove until physical death. They probably look like the physical body but with no defects at all. With Jairus' daughter the account says that when she came back from the dead the spirit returned so spirits don't have to be physically embodied, but it would appear the spirit is normally in the body till it dies. A few christians, e g John G Lake, have translated in the spirit. I.e their body is one place but their spirit moves rapidly to another location, or moves instantly to another location, to do some miraculous deed such as healing someone in a hospital.    I have heard of a chap called Ronald Coyne, who died about 5 years ago, but had no physical eye in one socket due to a childhood accident. But in the ministry of the healing evangelist TL Osbourne, his spiritual eye was opened up to see in the natural as a special miracle from God. This annoyed sceptics a lot when they tried to disprove things as he could read etc with the other eye covered up to their satisfaction.   The Holy Spirit of course is a spirit and hasn't got a physical body and most christians have been very aware of his presence at one time or another; I imagine him in form to be like a cloud that can be in infinitely many places and very concentrated in some believers. I have also encountered one demon assailing my body - demons are spirits opposed to God with no physical bodies but with a desire to assail human bodies and minds for some reason.

qpYyGd5Gaa	You write English very well. I understand how you feel. I can read and write in Spanish but when I open my mouth, I feel like the words sound bad. The best way to speak better is to practice. Perhaps see if you can find some conversation partners and the two of you spend a great deal of time speaking only in English. Try watching English television shows or movies and practice what they say as well by listening to their pronunciation. It takes time, but with practice, you will be great.|`|rW4bt6ZAaa	Maybe you can try to add some people to whatever you use to chat that are native English speakers.

If you'd like, you can add me on MSN. I am an English major, so I can help some. I'm still very early in my major, but I've always been decent at speaking.

I don't focus on my hands shaking, I focus on breathing and usually the problem takes care of itself.  You get up there and you're a little nervous and your breathing becomes more shallow and you get shaky.  Maybe deep breathes would help you.  Is there any way that you could use a podium or something similar to put your note cards on and do something else with your hands?  Of course, you wouldn't want to put them in your pockets or anything like that... but you could use them to gesture or simply casually grasp them together in front of you for the first couple of minutes until you get more comfortable.|`|AA11366224	The problem with controlling the adrenaline rush is that you lose the buzz.  Relaxation therapy works.  Get a CD at the chemists (they have all sorts of silly names - but they all use the same technique).  Then do the exercises the night before and about an hour before you go on.    Some people also find the homoeopathic remedy Argent Nit 6c to be helpful.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	Alright - here's an idea. Can you get your friends/family to help you? If so, give them a speech in a situation where you would more likely shake. For example if you weren't prepared or were worried about what someone in the room might say, or the topic is uncomfortable.   Get up, and start to speak. When your hands shake, stop, and stretch out your arms and relax. When you have control, you start again. What you are doing here is gaining concious control of your shaking and giving your body the consequences (stopping the speech) if your hands do shake.   This is where you need your family and friends, but truely, you shouldnt need to do this exercise more than 2-3 times before you find you can control this new habit.   Good luck.

1aa8b20a9151f0263c0e250dfc8c3448aa	Several possible origins are commonly given. The practice of blessing a sneeze, dating as far back as at least 77 AD, however, is far older than most specific explanations can account for.    A legend holds that it was believed that the heart stops when you sneeze, and the phrase "bless you" is meant to ensure the return of life or to encourage your heart to continue beating.    One explanation holds that the custom originally began as an actual blessing. Gregory I became Pope in 590 as an outbreak of the bubonic plague was reaching Rome. In hopes of fighting off the disease, he ordered unending prayer and parades of chanters through the streets. At the time, sneezing was thought to be an early symptom of the plague. The blessing ("God bless you!") became a common effort to halt the disease.    A variant of the Pope Gregory I story places it with Pope Gregory VII, then tells the common (though untrue) story of "Ring Around the Rosey" being connected to the same plague.    Another version says that people used to believe that your soul can be thrown from your body when you sneeze, that sneezing otherwise opened your body to invasion by the Devil or evil spirits, or that sneezing was your body's effort to force out an invading evil spirit. Thus, "bless you" or "God bless you" is used as a sort of shield against evil.    Alternatively, it may be possible that the phrase began simply as a response for an event that was not well understood at the time.    Another belief is that people used to see sneezing as a sign that God would answer your prayers or an omen of good fortune or good luck.  In this case, "Bless you" would be in recognition of that luck.    Tibetan Buddhists believe a sneeze (like meditation, falling asleep, preparing to die) can provide a moment of "clear consciousness," when people are opened to greater understanding.|`|Qim0aSKtaa	They don't quite know the answer of that (whoever they is)        http://www.snopes.com/language/phrases/b...|`|Kkxl8jchaa	some one told me that you do that because your hart stops while you sneeze|`|VUqlQmJcaa	One explanation holds that the custom originally began as an actual blessing.

Some of them, like love, are very wonderful.  You can appreciate them whether you believe we were deliberately designed and created this way, or whether we evolved this way. And there is a third school that believes evolution was just God's way of designing us this way.    Creationism says that God created us male and female and makes us fall in love with one another and need on another so that we will have a life partner and will perpetuate the race.  Evolution suggests that we evolved this way so that the gene pool could be refined over many generations, and that nature favors those creatures that reproduce their own kind.  Either explanation has the same result--people fall in love and have desire for one another.    Whether you are a creationist or believe in evolution, you know that aspirin will cure a headache.  You know what kinds of foods are good for you.  You know when you hit it off with a person of the opposite sex, when there is 'chemistry' there.

She's finally grown out of that fussy period, so we decided we had to stop being lazy and take the tree down!

u6zUhcUHaa	It is sad but a lot of people really do believe that. I am an American (unfortunately) and it really pisses me off when people say that all of the British are stuck up and snobbish and just absolutely hate Americans. I always correct them but I think it might be because England is such a small country compared to America that they get this idiotic idea that there are almost no people there and assume that every body is related. It is really ridiculous but some people can be so stupid. It could also be because Americans think that the British hate them so they have decided to hate them back, so they find these stupid little things to pick at and the British stereo type has resulted from that. But we aren't all ignorant idiots. I can think of at least three other Americans that actually know what they are talking about.    Hope this helped!!!|`|0ixBWT6Xaa	I'm an American and have never heard of this stereotype stuff.

jHwWMwDRaa	If you can, just enjoy the friendship and companionship.  You can't change anyone from straight to gay (or vice versa).    If it becomes too painful for you to be with him, explain it to him, how much it bothers you.  Tell him you might be able to be friends in 6 months or so, but now you have to get some space.|`|fR2Geezcaa	If he is straight then he is straight. Just like if your gay your gay.     He does come across as mature and very self confident where he has no fear as to if others are questioning his sexuality. His self confidence alone can be a huge turn on! It sounds like you have an awesome friend, one that accepts you for who you are, it's time for you to accept him for who he is, a great friend.    Not to feed in to your hopes and dreams, but there is a chance that he is simply bi-curious. Especially since he has found such a good friend in you. This is not something most act on and you should prepare yourself for that or you may end up being hurt in the end.|`|hZiwiboRaa	How do you turn a straight guy gay?

Be patient, your friendship is the most important thing now,without that there is no chance of a relationship.Good luck.|`|ROVhLgH7aa	Either he is a closet case or he is just experimenting or maybe he just doesnt know how to say he is inlove with you. Not too many guys are that friendly, especially in high school(I am assuming thats where u are) with a gay guy. I wouldnt take any offense to it. Just be his friend and see where it goes|`|967a4775c02dc2dd40b45608b213d540aa	you can't MAKE someone be gay or straight.  It just is what it is.  He may have a crush on you as well but may be suppressing the feelings.  Maybe he doesn't see himself as gay.  I think people can fall in love with a very good friend.  I think if you had any kind of respect for him, you would respect him and what he says.  If he says he is not gay or into you, then leave it at that and leave it alone.  At the same time, he shouldn't flirt and play with you the way you say he does.  That way he is not crossing that line with you. You can't help how you feel towards your friend but I think it's unfair for him to encourage those feelings by being "friendly."  Maybe you should distance yourself from him.  My guess is you won't and you'll continue to allow him to flirt with you and  play with your emotions.  If he says he is straight then he should leave it at that and not be crossing any boundaries.  He could very well be bi or gay.  But you can not force him to be gay.|`|swkhohjgaa	Doesnt work that way. Cant turn someone gay|`|LrWIu1N0aa	He sounds curious but not gay, esp if he has an on off thing with a girl. My guess is he probably wants to try something with you or is curious, but wont start anything as he knows how you feel and wouldnt want to hurt you or lead you on any more. he just wants to try it for fun. where as your whole heart is out there.     its up to you really, if you made a move he may go along with it, but it could ultimatly ruin your friendship. as you would get alot close to him and end uo getting hurt. and he would feel bad for hurting you but would still like girls

HzkRpjhEaa	Basically what it comes down to is this:  If she loves you as much as you love her, she will be loyal to you and wait until the two of you can be together.  There is no way you can really know for sure, but the fact that you are uncomfortable is not a good sign.  Pay attention to these feelings.  They're often right.  If she is right for you and she loves you, than waiting a year is nothing.  If it's that hard for her to wait one year, than don't count on her being there for the rest of your lives.  I'm in a long distance relationship right now because my fiance is deployed.  I don't get to see him at all for at least a year, if not longer, and I am still very happy with him.  My point is that the long distance thing is no excuse.  Trying calling her up when you both have some time to spend on the phone, and just tell her that you've been feeling a little neglected lately.  If she gets defensive, she is probably cheating on you.  But if she's not hiding anything, there's no reason why she shouldn't want to work on this with you to make things better until you can move out to where she is in a year.  Good luck.|`|MJhGi8Wuaa	?????????/ hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|`|DUOoMBqoaa	Are you sure not wanting to ask her directly means you "want to trust her". Sounds like you don't want to hear the truth. Why would you be reading the comments on her facebook all the time if you "trusted" her? No offense, but it sounds like you are expecting someone to wait for you because you are waiting for them. She is probably tired of waiting. Guys love to wait, the anticipation of the "girl in the future" gives them the focus and drive they need to prove something to themselves. Really though, women don't like waiting. They need attention and love, and she's not getting that from you if you see her every 2 months. If she's the one, than find a way to be with her. If she's not, stop kidding yourself by hiding behind a fantasy and focus your attention on who is available, and who you can be avaliable for...if you are really ready for a relationship.  Good luck.|`|L4BFp2mNaa	try to put it out of your mind.

da373172b148b65a63b8ba387b1d63afaa	There are few feelings in the world that are as wonderful as the feeling of pulling a pair of silky, sheer pantyhose up legs that have just been shaved or waxed!    Yes, I've dressed up as a woman wearing skirts or dresses, a bra, a slip, pantyhose and heels.  That said I would rather just wear a pair of pantyhose under jeans or shorts. But no matter if I'm wearing pantyhose with a dress or jeans, I will always shave.    Not only does it just look wrong to see anyone's hairy legs when they're wearing a dress and pantyhose it feels much better. The wispy material of the pantyhose clings better to your legs and that also helps them stay up better throughout the day.    MMmmmm!   If you haven't shaved your legs before you've put on pantyhose you need to try it!   So get out your razor, shave your legs and then when your legs are dry, realize there is a right way to put on hosiery. Take a few minutes to put them on properly, and follow these simple directions:     Remove all jewelry, and check fingernails and toenails for rough edges. This greatly reduces those maddening "they ran as soon as I put them on" mornings.    Sitting on the edge of your bed or chair roll each leg of the pantyhose down and place the toe of the garment over the foot. Gently pull your pantyhose up to just below your knee and then repeat on the other leg.     Stand up and pull your pantyhose up to your waist, gently pulling your pantyhose up but don't pull them too tight. Once you have them on you can check for twists or sags, making sure you have a smooth, sexy look!  Lastly, when it's time to get out of your dress or skirt and take off your pantyhose, be just as careful.  You don't want to ruin your pantyhose!    I'm confident that once you've worn your pantyhose after you have shaved you'll ALWAYS find the time to shave before dressing up!    I know I just love the anticipation I feel just before I slip each foot into my pantyhose, watching my my legs change colors from white to barely there, barely black or little color when as I slide my sheer, silky  pantyhose up my smooth, hair-free legs.     ENJOY!|`|wPnJekdqaa	I usually keep my legs shaved when I crossdress, although there's times when I either can't be bothered or forget. As for pantyhose, I much prefer stockings and suspenders. Hose are too much trouble when you need the toilet.|`|zX80VRbmaa	Pantyhose stays on better when legs are shaved.  THe feeling is just so much nicer.

BUT most of the people are just like everyone else, trying to make a living. I am surprised sometimes because you'd think that the people living in projects don't have any money, but a lot of the times there an Escalade or a really high end car parked in there. So I think some people take advantage of the free living. Not all, but I've seen it happen.

So yes, that use of the word "Lycanthropy" refers to something that could legitimately be classified as a mental illness...particularly when violent behavior is associated with it.    honestly, if someone believes they physically transform into a wolf/werewolf, then goes on a violent rampage while they are 100% convinced that they actually *have* transformed into an animal...there is no reason to say that that person is NOT mentally ill.    Whereas the more spiritual use of the term, I wouldn't classify that as a mental illness.  That's one reason many Therians favor therianthropy to lycanthropy. Psychologists would generally go for "zooanthropy" for the generalized form of "lycanthropy".    I suspect that many clinical lycanthropes are actually therianthropes with other problems. There are not many of us around in comparison to the larger human population but there are still plenty enough to have a lot of variety. I know of three Therians who also have schizophrenia. Since the only Therians that psychologists ever see have mental illnesses (since they wouldn't be at the clinic if they didn't), I would be surprised if they didn't think that therianthropy was a disease.    http://forum.werewolfcafe.com/viewtopic....

b6cd9d6fe5a0ec1d495444c45c2b75f2aa	Pluto and Prosperine (or Hades and Persephone as their Greek names) is a very popular myth. Persephone (I prefer the Greek names if you don't mind.) was the daughter of Demeter (Roman name Ceres) and Zeus. (Roman name Jupiter) Persephone was just minding her own business when Hades, her uncle, comes up from his kingdom, the Underworld and snatches her away. Demeter is very upset at this, she goes off looking for her daughter. Now Demeter is a very important goddess, the was the Goddess of the Harvest. While she was off looking for her daughter, she left her duties untended. Many crops died and famine took over the land. It got so bad, that Zeus had to intervene. He declared that Persephone had to be released to Demeter, unless she had eaten something while in the Underworld. Hades had persuaded Persephone to eat a few pomegranate seeds, so Persephone ended up spending part of the year with Demeter and part of the year with Hades in the Underworld. So Persephone ended up Hades' wife, Queen of the Underworld. Whenever Persephone was with Hades, Demeter grew depressed and forgot about her duties. For a short while, the crops would die. Hope this helps.|`|9dd2ac44728dd565acf459d4a4e730d0aa	http://www.proserpine.com/proserpine.htm...|`|OqHPJGcaaa	Basically, the story explains the seasons.

At the moment, you are wasting your life moping around and feeling sorry for yourself, and lusting after something you can't have, and will never have. Yes you are in love, but love is supposed to be a great feeling of joy and happiness inside you, not this darkness that you are feeling at the moment.    Whilst you feel down, and spending all your time thinking about this guy, you are sending out negative signals to other guys who might fancy you. Plus you are not likely to see the other guys whilst you have such intense feelings for someone else.    Perhaps in time, he will come round a bit and the two of you can become friends again. This is more likely to happen once he sees you have your eye on someone else, or you are in a relationship with someone else, so that you don't appear to be as much of a threat.    Falling in love with this guy wasn't your fault, it just happened. Use the experience as a lesson, and move on to someone who can return the love to you, and make you feel happy and warm and fuzzy inside.    If what I have written above sounds brutal, I'm sorry, but you do have to realise that as a gay guy, you are going to have crushes on many more straight guys over the years. It's unfortunate, but every time it happens, it makes us stronger better people, if we handle it correctly.    You sound like a really nice, senstive guy, and if you are caring as your question portrays you, then there is a very lucky guy waiting to come into your life one day, and you will both be very happy.|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	I wish I could help.    My advice is to find a kind sympathetic friend you can confide in about all this.    You're welcome to email    Good luck!|`|K6cHlzAkaa	do what you gotta do to keep from letting this pull you down rock bottom. Surround yourself with positive friends and family. Talk to a counseler or trusted adult or best best friend. Don't approach this guy no more; let him come to you if he wants to be friends with you again(gotta put your foot down). Branch out; join some clubs or groups on or off campus and meet new ppl (better yet; join groups or organizations with ppl like us(GLBT), so you can have a better selection if you get another crush). just study as best as you can, surround yourself with those in your corner and do some recreational stuff outside of school too. Act like you dont care either if you see him again. stuff like this should not affect a true friendship.|`|PC6SC6jyaa	Hi, first of all - I am in love with a guy at my school, he doesn't know it (or if he ever did know it, I had to deny it to protect myself from bullying) and I know that with 15 months of school left. The chances are slipping away.     I've been in love with him for 3 years.     I know what the pain is like, it hurts, like nothing before.     But I have got to tell you that, you can't let it interfere with you're studies. I know this is hard, but you have to move on.     I know at the moment you are down, but pick yourself up, brush the dirt off and start moving forward.     I know that you can never truly "get over it" but you learn to accept it, and live with it. And maybe one day, truly get over it. But time heals the wound.     I am here for you anytime, day or night.

fa8Ch1yKaa	I think its sad.  I'm 16, and I know people my age that are alcoholics.  Personally, I blame the parents.   They just let them go gallavanting off to party with their friends and what not. The parents could also supply the alcohol, and a space for partying.  The kids could also be sneaking alcohol without their parents knowledge, or sneaking of to party somewhere in the middle of the night.  Some kids will do whatever it takes to get that buzz.  God knows what else they're doing?|`|JnLoHaoAaa	We've all been there and done that and it never results into anything good|`|AA11601031	They're stupid - just like old people who drink too much alcohol.|`|B4dJINsbaa	They are wasting away the best years of their lives.|`|WFZWlGA0aa	I think that it is stupid and they are just trying to be cool.|`|jHHVkKQvaa	i think its sad tht we hav came 2 this low point really|`|0adde2725ea90445eb116c6f500bdd2daa	i'm 17 and i think its gross and they're spending there money on nothing!!!!!!!!!!!!! its discusting|`|gSwobfujaa	its bad...? i personally dont know how that is enjoyable anyways. i am a social drinker. i drink maybe once or twice a month on the weekends. i drink until im buzzed and sometimes slightly drunk and thats all i need. anything more than that is no fun, it doesnt loosen me up and lay back it makes me feel sick and tired and cranky. and even when im just a little drunk...its never fun enough to be worth the slight headache i have the next morning from drenching myself in those terrible sugar and carbs.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	Personally they annoy the crap out of me. It shows immaturity that he they don't know what their limit is.  I had a 22 year old co-worker who was working at our company for less than 2 months, went to our holiday party and got so drunk that he was saying inappropriate things to some of the female employees and had to call out the next day. After that, I never invited him to another Happy Hour that I planned at the office.|`|40476bbce9e2f1306244d82795226962aa	I am young myself but yeah know what it feels to drink when you are young.

But they should make Marijuana( weed, grass, pot, mary jane, reefer, dat good shyt...) legal so these kids wont drink so damn much...  It should really depend on the person. No drinking no younger than 16.|`|05cf231e05cdb402ee0f96c54afd036daa	Well, depends on what you mean by 'young' I guess. It seems a lot of younger kids these days think they're above everyone else. Perhaps it stems from the garbage they see on ehmTV and the rest of materialistic television. A friend of mine was cooking at a local restaurant and he told me they interviewed half a dozen kids for a dish washing position and they all wanted $15 per hour to wash dishes. When I was 14 I was making $4.00 per hour, washing dishes from 4 in the afternoon and would leave at 3 in the morning. I didn't complain and I was happy to make any money. Many parents spoil their children and I think many kids are not being taught to appreciate enough and respect older people; they're getting nearly everything they want and their parents are giving in to their kids' wants. I can't fully understand wanting to give my children the best as I have no children, but I can understand wanting to keep your family happy and give them the best you can. Personally, I think a lot more kids should join the military, or a similar program that would give them more discipline and teach them more about life, culture, history and reality. I'm not saying send them to war, especially not into some other country to fight for their freedom, but is really about blood, oil and power.    If by too much you mean they drink every day, I feel they may be neglected by their parents and they're reaching out for attention and acceptance. Most problems people have stem from prior experiences. Parents too busy working, drinking, solcializing, or whatnot end up giving their children much needed attention and those children end up failing at school or staying out late and partying with their friends. Sadly, these days, it seems 'the economy / capitalism' is more important to be seen by people rather than what's 'right'. This being via' television, the internet, the media and unfortunately more and more kids these days are not outside playing or out working any ole job, instead they're online all day and all night or watching TV. They learn from what they see and sublimially, they're being sold on cell phones and clothing, etc.    I guess, if you're referring to young people, of legal age to drink, 21 years in the U.S.A., I think their attitudes get the best of them and they think they're the sh*t. Honestly, I've noticed when I speak about age differences to people, usually the people that say it doesn't matter are younger and the older folks feeling that way, are dating a younger person or something to that affect. The common phrase, "if I knew then what I know now" makes more sense to me as I get older and gain more experience. There are some words I can think of that have come about because of such things, such as "naive", "ignorant  ", inexperienced. The thing is, many people feel offended when you try to explain they're "naive" and will defend themselves to no end. I suppose it is because they're somewhat in denial, but honestly, being young and having a good time is one thing, but spending so much time, energy and money on alcohol can lead to regret later in life. I'd like to see these young drinkers put a little more effort into doing good for the world while they're still young and vibrant and later on in life, they'll be happy they did so. Though, I know some people that didn't drink when they were younger and now they do and they seem to have a real problem with it. Had they been drinking for years prior, they might have a different attitude towards alcohol and not spend their later years, drunk and depressed all the time. Then again, body chemistry changes as someone gets older and plenty of people wish they were young again and drinking makes them feel less "plain" and more alive.|`|KGRikkJeaa	irresponsible and not trust worthy....i dont like it but hey, they arent my kid|`|ez5BjZdRaa	It's sad.

It's bad enough when people who are sick themselves, come to work that way.  Passes nasty germs to the coworkers.    To bring a sick child in is very bad.  Exposes the coworkers with a child who doesn't even work there.  And it's very bad for the child to have to hang around all day, when they're sick.  They really should be home, in bed.    It's heartless of that mother to make that kid hang out there all day. Say so!|`|5vO61nuvaa	I would mention it to HR as well if I were you.    Edit: I have something to add that I didn't want to before because I felt like everyone would get on my case, but, to hell with it. This seems like its just another advantage that mothers/married people have over single/non-parents at work. I realize that having children/being married brings along allot of other situations but in most work places it seems like married/parents time is just more valuable then singles/non-parents. For example... I used to work with this lady who was a parents but not married and she LITERALLY took a day off every other week due to 'child issues'... understandable.. but, after not taking a day off for about six months I took one.. and the owner was all over me about it. Like, just because I am not married and don't have children then I MUST be out partying instead of being sick. That's the kind of thing that grinds my gears. Like, because I made different choices then my coworker my time is less important. Not cool... so yea, I got a chip on my shoulder.. but so what?? Just because someone doesn't have children doesn't mean that their time is any less important then someone with children.|`|rThIVk2maa	You should take it up with your manager or HR. It is pretty tolerant of them to allow children to come in, but she needs to make other child care arrangements when the little tyke is sick, kids are germ factories.    If you want to say something yourself, you could give her the information of a friend who babysits, or a list of babysitters collected from other coworkers :)|`|t3eJ0Y3caa	Wow, you shouldn't  go to work sick, let alone bring your sick child! I think getting a policy in place would help. The child would be more comfortable at home. I realize she may not be able to afford to take off work, but that is just unacceptable. Maybe if they told her she won't be penalized that would help.|`|8HnLYjK4aa	call in sick and mention you must have got it from your co-worker's kid.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	You aren't being heartless, you're being pragmatic.  Your co-worker should be using her own sick or vacation days to stay home to take care of a sick child.  I would address a note to HR this way:    Dear HR:    I wanted to get some clarification on our benefits regarding the use of sick and vacation days.  It is my understanding that employees are permitted to use their sick days to care for a sick child--they do not need to personally be sick.  If they do not have enough sick days, they then must use vacation days.    The reason I ask is because an employee brought a sick child to work.  While I don't know the details surrounding this, the potential of other employees becoming ill as a result would have a negative impact on productivity and cause them to lose their sick and vacation time.  It is my opinion that the person should have stayed home with their sick child.      If I am correct in my assumption, I would like to request a reminder be sent out.  Thank you for your time.|`|hXFndli2aa	Is your manager aware of this?  Maybe your manager has allowed your co-worker to bring in her child?  So if i were you i'd communicate this concern with the manager before escalating this complain of yours to HR and getting this woman fire.

AA11879371	The Lion Gate of Mycenae, c. 1250 BCE  "The Choice of Heracles", invented by the sophist Prodicus (ca. 400 BC)    In cruising several sites I found these dates.  One article mentioned that the myths and legends of Herakles was added piece by piece and that it grew and changed throughout the centuries.  So, i can't give a definitive date.  Most of the writings seem to date back to around 400 BCE.  However, the Lion Gate of Mycenae dates back to 1250 BCE so some of the legends may have been orally transmitted down the ages.    Best I could do, good luck with the info.|`|shVgCizBaa	What time period did the Legend of Herakles appear? He might have been a Bronze Age historical figure, perhaps a king from Tiryns in the Peloponnesos -----------------------------HERAKLES  Both gods and heroes were worshipped in ancient Greece, each with their special class of rituals and respect paid. It is in the case of Herakles, who straddled - or perhaps bridged - the line between the two, that we find the key exception, where worship has taken frequently on both forms. The body of legends on him is vast, and of course, not always consistent; depending on which one is consulted, Herakles' "level of divinity" may vary. Still, given that many legendary figures were based on real personalities, one might wonder if this may not apply to the great hero as well - and indeed it is sometimes conjectured that he might have been a Bronze Age historical figure, perhaps a king from Tiryns in the Peloponnesos. In any case, having emerged beyond historical recognition in Homeric Archaic Greece, his veneration spread throughout the Greek realm - from "his own" pillars (i.e. Gibraltar) in the West, to the farthest reaches of Hellenistic India. As mentioned, this cult took many forms - some of which we know regrettably little about today, like the special games and festivals in his honor, known as Herakleia. But his depictions on coins are plentiful yet subtly different enough, and in this section we feature some of those issues that don't fall into the other, more specific Heraklean themes presented here.       http://www.rudnik.com/greece/herakles/ --------------------------                       Herakles is best known as the strongest of all mortals. Stronger then many gods. So strong he was the deciding factor in allowing the Olympian Gods to win their battle with the giants. He was the last mortal son of Zeus. He is the only man born of mortal woman to become a god upon his death.     Offsetting his strength was a noticeable lack of intelligence or wisdom. Once when he became too hot he pulled his bow out and threaten to shoot the sun. This coupled with strong emotions in one so powerful frequently got Herakles in trouble. While his friend and cousin Theseus ruled Athens, Heracles had trouble ruling himself. His pride was easily offended. He took up grudges easily and never forgot them. His appetites for food, wine, and women were as massive as his strength. Many of Herakles great deeds occurred while doing penance for stupid acts done in anger or carelessness.     It would be easy to view Herakles as a muscle bound buffoon. Indeed, many of the comic Greek playwrights used him this way. Even among serious critics he was often seen as a primitive, brutal, and violent. There is much to support this view. His chosen weapon was a massive club. His customary garment a lion skin, head still attached. He impiously wounded some of the gods. He threatened Apollo priestess at Delphi when a answer to his questions was not forthcoming. He created most of his own problems.    However, Herakles as simply a macho buffoon is unfair. If he held grudges, he would also do anything to help a friend. Once his anger passed he was the most critical judge of his own actions. He was too strong for anyone to force a punishment on him. That he willing did severe penance shows a fundamental sense of justice. During his punishments he shows patience, fortitude and endurance that are as heroic as his strength. Terrible things happen to him because of Hera's hatred, a hatred that he is not responsible for. That he perseveres through it all is a moral victory beyond simple strength.    The view of Herakles shifted considerable over time. The early view focused on how badly he managed despite his obvious gifts. As time passed the focus shifted to his virtues. The Romans valued him highly as he best fit their idea of a hero. He eventually had a fair sized cult that worshiped him as a god.

After all, you're not intending to do an Dissertation, nor did you say ongoing research, so I have to assume in Thesis, we want to get in done within the 2 years you'll be studying your Master's.|`|4WqvTAfmaa	Occutl: ceremonial magicians, magicians, magic users, witches, hedge witches, shamans, urban shamans, chaos magicians, Magical Qabalists, some astrologers, some psychics, hoodo, voodo, vodoun, santaria, condomble, lacumbe,     Makes for a very big subject.    Wicca: 150 years of history. Lots of room for theories to prove in that.     So what was the question?|`|KJHt4hiYaa	And?|`|m3f0Pa5oaa	First, "occult" can mean paranormal.  "Cults" are fanatical religious factions.|`|09409387b5e563591bca040cbb27b777aa	They're the basis of a very lucrative business.|`|JMOLRKRraa	So what is the point you are trying to make? Occult means hidden knowledge and wicca is a practicing earth pagan religion craft. That's it. I think you fail.|`|paRGbr7Xaa	....You going to elaborate on what the paper is about or something? Can't give suggestions for a thesis statement if we don't know what the hell you're writing about.|`|wZpahhHzaa	What specifically are you trying to discuss? How much do you know about Wicca and what is the point of your essay?|`|MoUtk7cUaa	maybe try to be careful with this one.  wicca, and other forms of witchcraft, are generally harmless worship of the earth and nature much like american indians and sometimes use ordinary natural chemistry for cures, salves, 'potions', etc. occult is generally not the same thing and could be found to be offensive to witches to be lumped in with the occult.|`|8bNaX89Daa	As per the definition of the word:     1.  a particular system of religious worship, esp. with reference to its rites and ceremonies.  2.  an instance of great veneration of a person, ideal, or thing, esp. as manifested by a body of admirers: the physical fitness cult.  3.  the object of such devotion.  4.  a group or sect bound together by veneration of the same thing, person, ideal, etc.    It would behoove you to include all the modern religions under this word, while you write your thesis. Do not let active religious persons tell you that they are not in a Cult because they are.    To those of you Christians, Jews and Muslim's. Yes, as much as you want to think that Jehovah's Witness or Mormons are "cult" or "occult". Your religions are the greatest example's of Cult's on this planet. You venerate the same god(s) and come together for formal meetings and ritual ceremonies. Ie; ... communion and passover. It is no different than gathering in the woods to worship the wind. Just a different belief system.|`|Lk4aCBACaa	Could you be a tad more specific?    I shudder whenever I see someone writing a report or "thesis" on something they obviously know nothing about.    At any rate, ALL religions are cults. Only one definition of cult means extremist religious sects, and I do hope you're not lumping Wicca under that definition. Otherwise, your thesis will do nothing more than spread more misinformation about an already maligned religion.    "Occult" as another poster said merely means "hidden knowledge" and implies no religious belief in particular.

Of0H9i4Vaa	The first resurrection is for Jesus'  apostles that will rule with Jesus for the thousand years of the judgement day...They go to Heaven. They number 144,000 and they are from every nationality on the Planet. They are called the firstfruits of mankind,for the Kingdom of our God.    The second resurrection is those who will live on the earth , they will be judged from the new scrolls that will be opened in the new system of things that Jesus spoke of......he called it paradise...This is what the Bible really teaches..|`|P6atY3xXaa	First resurrection is for saints, the judges, holy ones.  Rev. 20:4, 6...1 Cor. 6:2, 3.    The second occurs during the 1,000 years and is for ALL who are not saints/judges.  Rev. 20:5, Ps. 45:16, Acts 24:15....that includes the OT faithful servants who get to be "princes" instead of kings, the great crowd, ones who never knew anything and ones who were unrighteous but didn't commit unpardonable sin.    Debbie|`|46e820e9ba704c6776305bf6a1b991efaa	The 144,000 anointed will be the first ones resurrected to heaven.  Then the second resurrection will be all those who will live on the earth in the paradise.|`|KDrztUEpaa	Revelation 20:6 - Happy and holy s anyone having part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of the Christ, and will rule as kings with him for the thousand years -     The first resurrection refers to the anointed individuals who will rule in heaven with Jesus and God.     According to Rev. 14:1 only 144,000 humans will be anointed to rule as kings in heaven with God and Jesus.   (Rev. 14:1 - And I saw, and, look! the Lamb [the 'lamb' symbolizes Jesus] standing on Mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand having his name and the name of his father [Jesus' father Jehovah God] written on their foreheads-)    as a note I added the text in [ ] to help understand better.     I'm pretty sure that the second resurrection is what is mentioned at Rev. 14:13   I'm not 100% positive, but I will do research and email it to you|`|U7Rh7KNSaa	The first Resurrection is for those that live there life right now follow God and keep his commandment. The Second Resurrection is for those that will be in the judgment day.|`|UokQ7fAzaa	The first Resurrection refers to the dead and the living found in Christ. At that time, they will all be transformed and basically be with God forever. (ie. the first resurrection guys go to Heaven).    There is a second Resurrection; it's a little later in Chapter 20. This resurrection is for those who aren't found in Christ, after the 1000 years. Those people will be judged and sent to Hell.|`|BEafTcLwaa	Luke 21:22 says that "these are the days of vengeance, in which all that is written shall be fulfilled."  Using the key to interpretation called "audience relevance," we must seek to understand how the original intended audience (1st Century Christians) would have understood this verse.  If this verse was written 2000 years ago, "these" days are days long past.  They cannot be days in the future, it is not logical to assume that.  So, that said, Revelation is fulfilled already and everything written therein is not for OUR future, but for THEIR future, which is now in our past.  Much of Revelation was fulfilled during the Roman Jewish War (66-70AD).  Reigning for 1000 years is figurative language, as 1000 has a greater meaning than its literal significance.  See link below.|`|J31X7h3iaa	Seen Romans 6 for a very clear statement of the first resurrection.  The first resurrection is our spiritual resurrection.  It is when we are baptized/born again.   Also see 2 Cor. 5:17 If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.    The second resurrection is the physical resurrection of the body -- the new body.    This explanation is consistent with Rev. 20:6 where the SOULS of the saints are spoken of and where they have received the first resurrection but are waiting the second resurrection.    For those who have been spiritually reborn, the second resurrection -- the resurrection of the body is a JOYFUL occasion.  It is the second DEATH, spiritual death, that one should fear.    All who are born again are part of and are experiencing the 1st resurrection -- the spiritual rebirth and resurrection.  [see also Eph 2:4 "because of the great love with which he loved us, 5even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ"]    All people living and death, born again or not born again, are part of the 2nd, physical resurrection.|`|ffb16e0ffc6a4152dbf3d94c25cd5995aa	First resurrection is for the ones who follow the Law of YHWH and the true gospel of Yeshua the Messiah. The second resurrection is for the rest, which includes the nonbelievers, sinners and the people that never heard the good news( people that live in remote areas where the good news couldn't reach them, people that lived before the time of Yeshua).  You have to ask your self why would Satan be released after 1000 years to deceive the saints again? Because there are still God's people living on earth. And why is the book of life being opened to see if people's names are in there if everyone in the second resurrection is being punished. Judgment means that people will be judged according to they works. Some will be found in the book of life and some won't.    That's what the second resurrection means according to Revelation 20:7-15.|`|VncSMLMpaa	The first resurrection presumably refers to 'the firstfruits of the dead'.  Jesus was the first and sinless son of God, he was and is that firstfruit..    1 Corinthians 15  20 But now is Christ risen from the dead, [and] become the firstfruits of them that slept.      Those who are Christ's at his coming will be raised and, if found worthy through God's grace, will be given eternal life.|`|QnH9QuQwaa	Read on, you'll see the second.  Oh I'm so happy someone finally stumbled across this.  Good job!    The first one is for those whom God called and they were righteous.  It's the best resurrection there is.    The second one is a physical resurrection.  It's for those who never knew God or Jesus and never got a chance to know them.  It's also a second chance for everyone else.  This is where the children who died early, the people who never knew what a Bible was, and those who plain ol' simply didn't get a chance to show what they were made of.  In this resurrection mankind will see God on Earth.  There will be no Satan on the planet and they will finally have no excuse for not knowing or believing in God.    The third resurrection is a spiritual resurrection.  Those in the second resurrection will finally become spirits.  Those who still refused God will then join Satan and the other demons.      This is a summary, but read for yourself.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	The 'First' one is The Rapture!  (The second one will not be so good.)  It will be the resurrection of the dead/ungodly for Judgement.|`|k03dYskYaa	Anointed members of the Israel of God must join the Lord Jesus Christ in heavenly glory, where they will always be with the Lord. (Galatians 6:16; 1?Thessalonians 4:17) That event is called the earlier resurrection or the first resurrection. (Philippians 3:10, 11; Revelation 20:6)  Revelation 14:1 shows these number 144,000.    In his first letter to the Corinthians, Paul raises a question about the first resurrection: How are the dead to be raised up? Yes, with what sort of body are they coming? He then answers the question: What you sow is not made alive unless first it dies .?.?. but God gives it a body just as it has pleased him .?.?. The glory of the heavenly bodies is one sort, and that of the earthly bodies is a different sort.1?Corinthians 15:35-40.    Pauls words show that Christians anointed with holy spirit must die before they can receive their heavenly reward. At their death, their earthly body returns to the dust. (Genesis 3:19) At Gods appointed time, they are resurrected with a body of a kind suitable for life in the heavens. (1?John 3:2) God also grants them immortality. That is not something they possess from birth, as if a so-called immortal soul were breathed into them. This which is mortal must put on immortality, says Paul. Immortality is a gift from God, put on by those who share in the first resurrection.1?Corinthians 15:50, 53; Genesis 2:7; 2?Corinthians 5:1, 2,?8.    Only 144,000 share in the first resurrection. Jehovah began selecting them at Pentecost 33?C.E., shortly after he resurrected Jesus. All of them have [Jesus] name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads. (Revelation 14:1,?3)|`|flrOp5YLaa	Read the two verses before that one.  It explains the first resurrection.  The second resurrection is for those who were not a part of the first.    Rev. 20:4-5    "I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given the authority to judge.  And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the word of God.  They had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received the mark on their foreheads or hands.  they came to life and reigned with christ a thousand years.    (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.)  This is the first resurrection.|`|JZxZ8mKRaa	FOR HEY -    Revelation 14:13 also refers to the 144,000.    Check the Revelation book and the scripture itself - "who die in union with the Lord" "go right with them" (immediate resurrection) "from this time onward" (during the presence - Look at 1st Corinthians 15:23.)|`|0a2c15282819d7b30bdcecbde5be9249aa	the first resurrection refers to those living in south america and the second resurrection is for those in europe|`|stAeoUeSaa	The saved are at the Bema Seat Judgement- The first resurrection.  The others are judged a 1000 years later at the horrific Great White Throne Judgment- The second resurrection of the damned.|`|HDbMh2YBaa	You definitely dont want to be apart of the second.|`|AA11220299	That resurrection is the people who died during the tribulation for their faith in God. They are raised and rule with Christ in the Millennium. It is not Christians who would already be in Heaven with Christ by this time.

There is a commandment that says not to worship other gods.  There is no rule against NOT worshiping god.  This concludes that worshiping the "wrong" god is worse than being a non-believer.    Let's assume all religions agree to this.  So your chance of worshiping the "right" god are several thousand to one. So if you worship any god it's most likely that you will anger the true god in case he exists.    This makes atheism the safest way...|`|JbGbU6guaa	The Lord Jesus Christ.

He sent Prophets to teach humans how to worship him   The first prophet was our father Adam  But the humans forget, change & loose the correct way.  So GOD sent other prophets with the same message.

Both of those questions give the answerer a way to tell you what they paid (if they choose - "it was $240,000, but we got it for $210,000"), they can just stick with the information that was publicly available anyway - "the house listed for $240,000."|`|TXddP0uxaa	Absolutely.

WhUV9k6Jaa	Fourth child of Cronos and Rhea, he was their oldest male child.  Like his three sisters and brother Poseidon, he was swallowed by his father after birth because Cronos feared being overthrown by one of his children.  When Zeus fulfilled that prophecy, the three male sons, Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, drew lots for the universe.  Zeus drew the heavens, Poseidon the seas, and Hades the Underworld.  As Lord of the Underworld he was not deemed the best of company by the other gods and did not dwell in Olympus.  He lived alone until his gaze fell upon his niece, Persephone, and he fell in love.  He abducted her and made her his bride.  After a compromise with her grieving mother, Demeter, Persephone spends half the year (winter) in the Underworld with her husband and half the year (summer) above ground with her mother.

BNlSh53faa	New plasma center to open in Provo  By Kimberly McLean Daily Universe Staff Reporter - 28 Oct 2005     E-mail or Print this story            Photo by Robb Costello.  Bio-Medics Plasma center on State St. in Orem across from the University Mall. Travis Fitch donating plasma on Wednesday afternoon.With her right elbow bruised and throbbing from two days ago, Jessica Ford is glad she hasnt donated from her left arm in quite some time. Her veins are pleasantly large enough for the oversized needle to extract the plasma and return the rest of her blood into her arm nicely, a condition that delights many nurses at the facility.    In no time at all, Ford, an Orem resident, leaves the Orem Bio-Medics plasma center with $25 more for weekend spending.    Offering donors as much as $180 per month, Bio-Medics will open their second plasma donation center in Utah Valley in mid-November in the building that was once Club Omni on 155 W. Center St., eight blocks south of BYU.    We look forward to serving the community in Provo, said Reed Smith, a manager at the Orem Bio-Medics Center. Several students have told us that they and their friends would donate more frequently if there was a plasma center at a more convenient location.    Bio-Medics estimates reception of around 1,000 donations a week in the new Provo facility from both BYU students and local residents.    Plasma is the clear yellowish fluid portion of the blood that transports water and nutrients to cells throughout the body. It constitutes 55 percent of the blood.    Donated plasma is primarily used for making drugs that have a longer shelf life than non-plasma-based drugs, which help to control blood viscosity. Hemophiliacs particularly benefit from these drugs as well as victims of excessive blood loss from surgeries or accidents and those with impaired immune systems.    Gary Crandall, from the Food and Drug Administration, said he encourages students to donate plasma.    This is a great opportunity for both parties, he said. We provide a safe and clean environment to donate in as well as a reliable, life-saving product, and students provide the means for the operation and earn some extra cash on the side.    Since plasma regenerates within 24 hours in most cases, Bio-Medics allows students to donate a maximum of twice in seven days with at least one day between donations. Donors receive $20 for their first donation in a week and $25 for their second.    Ryan Hancock, a junior studying recreation management from Heber, Ariz., donates on a semi-weekly schedule.    I eat lots of tuna and other meat to make sure my protein levels stay high so I can continue donating, he said. It will be a lot more convenient to have a closer center too so I dont have to travel as far.    To be eligible to donate, donors must pass a rigorous health screening and physical examination. The donation process takes an hour and a half to two hours.    Reed Smith from the Orem Bio-Medics said if donors drink plenty of fluids, especially water, in the 24 hours prior to donating, they can cut down the donation time because the blood will flow quicker.    Provos previous solitaire plasma facility on Center St., Alpha Plasma Center, shut down in November 2003 due to a lack of business. Smith said he is confident that Bio-Medics will have enough business to keep both their Orem and Provo facilities thriving.    Worldwide, the demand for plasma is more than 20 million liters and about 11 million are collected at plasma centers, Smith said. College towns tend to be the ideal place for plasma donation centers because everyone can use some extra money.

DIlNnjf8aa	Say it as often as possible, because each time you get a reward for it.    -    The importance of saying salaam and returning the greeting  CAN YOU TELL ME A DETAIL INFORMATION ON THE IMPORTANCE OF SAYING SALAAM AND SAYING WAALAIKUM-AS-SALAAM    Praise be to Allaah.    All people have the custom of greeting one another, and every group has its own distinctive greeting that distinguishes them from other people.    The Arabs used to greet one another with the words Anim sabaahan or Animu sabaahan [equivalent to Good morning  Translator], using words derived from al-nimah, which means good living after the morning. The idea was that because the morning is the first part of the day, if a person encounters something good in the morning, the rest of the day will be good too.    When Islam came, Allaah prescribed that the manner of greeting among Muslims should be Al-salaamu alaykum, and that this greeting should only be used among Muslims and not for other nations. The meaning of salaam (literally, peace) is harmlessness, safety and protection from evil and from faults. The name al-Salaam is a Name of Allaah, may He be exalted, so the meaning of the greeting of salaam which is required among Muslims is, May the blessing of His Name descend upon you. The usage of the preposition ala in alaykum (upon you) indicates that the greeting is inclusive.    Ibn al-Qayyim said in Badaai' al-Fawaaid (144):    Allaah, the Sovereign, the Most Holy, the Peace, prescribed that the greeting among the people of Islam should be al-salaamu alaykum, which is better than all the greetings of other nations which include impossible ideas or lies, such as saying, May you live for a thousand years, or things that are not accurate, such as Anim sabaahan (Good morning), or actions that are not right, such as prostrating in greeting. Thus the greeting of salaam is better than all of these, because it has the meaning of safety which is life, without which nothing else can be achieved. So this takes precedence over all other aims or objectives. A person has two main aims in life: to keep himself safe from evil, and to get something good. Keeping safe from evil takes precedence over getting something good    The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made spreading salaam a part of faith. Al-Bukhaari (12, 28 and 6236), Muslim (39), Ahmad (2/169), Abu Dawood (5494), al-Nisaai, (8/107) and Ibn Hibbaan (505) narrated from Abd-Allaah ibn Umar that a man asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): What is the best thing in Islam? He said, Feeding others and giving the greeting of salaam to those whom you know and those whom you do not know.    Ibn Hajar said in al-Fath (1/56):    i.e., do not single out anybody out of arrogance or to impress them, but do it to honour the symbols of Islam and to foster Islamic brotherhood.    Ibn Rajab said in al-Fath (1/43):    The hadeeth makes the connection between feeding others and spreading salaam because this combines good actions in both word and deed, which is perfect good treatment (ihsaan). Indeed, this is the best thing that you can do in Islam after the obligatory duties.    Al-Sanoosi said in Ikmaal al-Muallim (1/244):    What is meant by salaam is the greeting between people, which sows seeds of love and friendship in their hearts, as does giving food. There may be some weakness in the heart of one of them, which is dispelled when he is greeted, or there may be some hostility, which is turned to friendship by the greeting.    Al-Qaadi said in Ikmaal al-Muallim (1:276):    Here the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was urging the believers to soften their hearts. The best Islamic attitude is to love one another and greet one another, and this is achieved by words and deeds. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) urged the Muslims to foster love between one another by exchanging gifts and food, and by spreading salaam, and he forbade the opposite, namely forsaking one another, turning away from one another, spying on one another, seeking out information about one another, stirring up trouble and being two faced.    Love is one of the duties of Islam and one of the pillars of the Islamic system. One should give salaams to those whom one knows and those whom one does not know, out of sincerity towards Allaah; one should not try to impress other people by giving salaams only to those whom one knows and no-one else. This also entails an attitude of humility and spreading the symbols of this ummah through the word of salaam.    Thus the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained that this salaam spreads love and brotherhood. Muslim (54), Ahmad (2/391), and al-Tirmidhi (2513) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:    You will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another. Shall I not tell you about something which, if you do it, you will love one another? Spread salaam amongst yourselves.    Al-Qaadi Ayaad said in al-Ikmaal (1/304):    This is urging us to spread salaam, as mentioned above, among those whom we know and those whom we do not know. Salaam is the first level of righteousness and the first quality of brotherhood, and it is the key to creating love. By spreading salaam the Muslims love for one another grows stronger and they demonstrate their distinctive symbols and spread a feeling of security amongst themselves. This is the meaning of Islam.    The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also explained the reward earned by the one who sa|`|3180e2b368500ca94cbac1a023253d3caa	First of I'm happy your thinking of converting so congrats.  Second a lot of people have trouble with pronouncing the words correctly.    Most people believe the correct way is this.    "The complete form for the Islamic greeting is Assalamu Alilkum Wa Rahmatulah Wa Barakatuh meaning peace, mercy, and blessings be upon from Allah (S.W.T.). This is because Imams Abu-Dawood and At-Termithi reported in a good hadith that a man came to the prophet (S.A.W.) and said, "Assalamu Alikum." The prophet responded and the man sat down. The prophet said, "Ten rewards." Another man came and said, "Assalamu Alikum Wa Rahmatullh." The prophet responded and the man sat down. The prophet said, "twenty rewards." "  The most common is just Assalamu Alikum.    Assalamu Alikum, reply is Walaikum Assalam    Assalamu Alikum Wa Rahmatullh, reply is Walaikum Assalam Wa Rahmatullh    Assalamu Alilkum Wa Rahmatulah Wa Barakatuh, reply is Walaikum Assalam Wa Rahmatulah Wa Barakatuh.    Again the common replies to all these greetings are Walaikum Assalam.  And the common greeting Asslamu Alikum.    You can greet anyway you want, it doesn't matter much.    If you see him every hour, it's enough to say it one time i think.But again it's up to you, whatever you feel comfortable with.

I don't give money to charitable organizations with religious foundations, but I absolutely support their right to exist.  They believe that part of their helping includes their religious message.    Where I have a problem is with charitable organizations that don't disclose their religious foundations.  Scientology in particular is notorious for their front organizations that are used to target the weak and vulnerable for active recruitment.

His motto is not to allow the poor die of hunger and poverty while he saw the rich enjoying life while having no interest in taking care of the ones who work to make them rich.  The Church came out like him, but instead of robbing the way Robin Hood does they came to you first to spread the Good News and they ask you to help them spread it more and widely buy giving them donations (which they got the idea from tithing in the Book) that may sustain their livelihood to give them time to spread the news farther and further. They also see the opportunity to use their system to help the more needy in places they have seen and that was where their charity work started. Now they are robbing ( I mean begging) from the Ultra rich, the regular rich, the Noveau rich, the ordinary rich, the average and the less poor to help the very poor in so many remote places.   Their primary purpose is to spread God's words, If you separate charity from them, do not be surprise if they will be far richer than what you can already see from their Mosques, Basilicas, Cathedrals,Temples, churches and synagogues not to mention the luxurious mansions, congregation halls, expensive cars and limousines their highest leaders have.Think wisely.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	Yes.

So what... tell them to take a hike- find someone of their own to kiss and stay the heck out of your business!!!!|`|fuvSSi9aaa	its none of their business|`|71yXXY3eaa	The best way to deal with this situation is to turn it into a joke.  If you go on the offensive you could damage your relationships with your friends or even your boyfriend.  You should counter their pleas by telling them something that is particularly uncomfortable for them to hear.  You can do this with someone else to help.|`|k5tmEjHfaa	Ohh someone did that  to me once, don't do it! It's so embarassing!

They are pretty much the same. God Bless your walk with the Lord!|`|bVROvLNSaa	In order to know what Baptists believe, I would suggest that you log onto a website of one of your local Baptist Churches - they should have their beliefs stated.    The biggest change for you as a Roman Catholic is the number and type of sacraments as well as the Pope.    You might also want to enrol your children in an AWANAS programme near you - they will LOVE it!!    The links below will help you to understand Baptist beliefs.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	Check out Charles Stanley!  (He is a great Baptist Preacher and teaches the Truth about Jesus!)  |`|9mLjDa5kaa	The bottom line is salvation in Jesus!      Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	Obviously, Catholics are going to say you should remain Catholic and Protestants will think it's fine if you choose a Protestant church.  You could also choose to be Mormon, JW, Jewish, Muslim or Hindu.    However, God is not going to punish you no matter what you pick, and that would include atheism.  So relax.|`|YyEEAJBkaa	My thoughts, if they have to  capitalise 'free gift' and 'full payment', then they are trying to flog you a pup.    Nobody thought to also say that American Baptists hate Catholics    I agree with the guy who said don't tkae anyone elses word for it, you must research long and hard.|`|8rbQBaIeaa	I am a Nazarene, we believe simular to the Baptist. They are a wonderful group.  Some of the Baptist believe in ....once saved always saved...we don't  I found this a minuet ago...surf around, looking up baptist doctrine until you find something that is helpful to you ....God Bless  BAPTISTS ARE DEFINED BY DOCTRINE   What We Believe     1. We believe that the Bible is the only rule of faith and practice.   2. We believe that there is one God and in this being there exists eternally three co-equal persons namely the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.   3. We believe that Christ is the only head of His church - no Popes.   4. We believe that Christ started His church during his earthly ministry which first included the Apostles.   5. We believe for membership in a New Testament church are regeneration with a confession of faith in Christ and baptism by immersion in water and in that order.   6. We believe in the independence of the local church.   7. We believe the church is local and visible.   8. We believe the church has only two ordinances - believer's baptism by immersion in water and the Lord's Supper.   9. We believe and hold to a closed communion.   10. We believe in ecclesiastical separation from other institutions which do not conform to the New Testament pattern for a church.   11. We believe that there are two offices - Pastors and Deacons.   12. We believe in the separation of Church and State - The State does not run the church.   13. We believe in the right of the individual to interpret Scripture privately and to have direct access to God.   14. We believe in the right of others to be wrong and so we do not persecute those that believe different.   15. We believe that faith in Christ and faith alone in Christ is the way to salvation and that faith is from God.   16. We believe in man's spiritual deadness and his inability to come to Christ outside the work of God.   17. We believe in the election of God in His choosing of His people before the foundation of the world.   18. We believe in the substitutionary sacrifice and propitiation of Christ for His people and only His people.   19. We believe in the absolute sovereignty of God over all things and people.   20. We believe that the way to finance the Lord's work is by tithes and offerings.   21. We believe in Congregational rule.   22. We believe in and are Premillennial.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	Do not take a chance with your immortal soul.

There are different types of Baptists. I have been to some great Baptist churches, and some not so great ones. Whether or not it's wrong to change denominations, I can't help you with that. Best of luck.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	I suppose Baptists are more interesting than a typical Catholic mass, but all protestants make up the rules as they go along and their preachers are more than likely to be crooks.    There are other more productive ways to feed the spirit.|`|4b1ceaa46aa120eb6b53d8602b81f757aa	Baptists are protestants, in other words an offshoot religion protesting the catholics.  True baptists hold to the "priesthood of the believer", ie... you don't need a priest to exonerate your sins, you can ask God yourself.  You don't need a priest to speak to God, again you can do that yourself.  The Baptist faith teaches a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, an inerrant view of the Bible, and has foundation in the trinity... God the Father, Jesus the Son who was sent to Earth to die for our sins, and the Holy Spirit who remains in our hearts to lead us away from sinful desires.  Ironically, Baptists will "baptize" members but do not believe this is neccesary for salvation.  Many branches of the religion have developed their own "unwritten rules" over the years but these are the basic tenaments and any addition that doesn't jibe with Biblical teaching, isn't appropiate.  Hope this helps.|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	"Baptist" has become such a misused label it has little meaning left....  Independent would still apply I guess... and conservative perhaps.. but even that is not universal....I am a member of a small Conservative Baptist congregation. but .... dispite what the Catholics claim... there is only One True Church... and the Catholics ain't it... and neither are the Baptists or any other "denomination" or sect, or cult....

Their theology is based on the beliefs of their individual pastors who are their popes. Essentually, they are free to teach anything that comes to their mind whether truth of heresy. Often there is more heresy than truth. Among those claiming Christianity only one Church has the promise from Christ as being the "pillar and ground of the truth that will endure for all times and never fall into apostasy. That Church is the Church of your youth, the Catholic Church. God bless!    My blog may help you with some of your questions:    http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-S6YMuFYya...    In Christ  Fr. Joseph|`|4fTiCNiKaa	Yes the Baptist's are far different than Catholics. Your best bet is to search the Scriptures for guidance. God's Word will never led you astray. One this is important, and that is to get connected with a sound, Bible preaching, Spirit filled church. I understand you may be busy, but if you pray about it the Lord will help. I can testify to that!    As to some uplifting videos you can watch until you can make it to church, check out some of these church videos and let me know what you think.

Don't go looking for someone to explain it to you...because if you are looking for your own real faith, you won't find it by doing what someone else tells you to do.      I suggest getting the Thomas Jefferson Bible, also the book "Who Wrote the Bible" by Richard E. Friedman.  I suggest getting an NIV bible, a King James version, and also a concordance to help you find information within it.  But, don't go on the internet to find videos to tell you how to get your faith together.  Read it.  Take what is real and true to you and keep it.  Find what Jesus said and see if it makes sense.  After you understand what he said, then read the rest and see if what they say make sense, and if it doesn't, toss it.  I think it is important to make your own decisions, because if you let someone else do this thinking for you, it won't be your faith...it will be theirs.  Good luck to you.|`|buiHdl0Gaa	Please read "God is Not Great" by Christopher Hitchens. It's an atheist treatise and I dare you to read it.

That's the best way to approach the subject of God the almighty. This being made you in his/her own image (If the creationist route is the one you go down) and made your life possible. They've given you the greatest gift of all, yes? Then why listen to a corrupt organised religion that will only preach a 'fire-and-brimstone' mentality and say 'No, don't do that, that or that and don't touch that and that's bad!' I believe there is a God and that they're generally pissed about the state of organised religion in the world today. People are killing others in God's name and many are being persecuted by the chuch because they're not believers. All organised religions do is give you a guideline to live your life by. Forget that and make your own beliefs, live how you'd want to live.

But since this is more in the sense of a proverb I would translate it like this:    Nicht was man sagt, sondern was man macht, zeigt wer man ist.    If you wanted to use the more impersonal, you would say:    Nicht was Du sagst, sondern was Du machst, zeigt wer Du bist.    Or as the very formal and stilted version:    Nicht was Sie sagen, sondern, was Sie machen, zeigt wer Sie sind.    I would not use the literal translation of 'defines' (definiert).  Although there are many Anglicisms in use in the German language it still sounds awkward.

It is a genetic fact that one species CAN become another species, but it does not "magically" happens, it is a long complicated evolutionary process of chromosomal crossover, mutations, environmental pressure, natural selection and so on.

Now hear this! If it were not for an explosion you and everything you see would not exist. All of the atoms that make up the world, yourself included, came from inside of a star. It takes tremendous heat to fuse atoms together,that's why they call it fusion. Things like carbon,iron,oxygen,gold,copper,and the list goes on for ninety plus other elements would not exist if they had not been formed in the heart of a star. Now you must ask how did those elements get out of the star to make all the things around you? The answer is there was an explosion called a super nova. So your very first known fact is in fact completely false. I'm sure that won't stop you from providing everyone with your idiotic interpretation of the Universe though. Just so you know that is why people like me hang out here. Someone needs to give people the truth instead of the drivel you are putting out. You should try posting this in the science section though.

I could offer you any number of utterly devastating disproofs, which creationists will not be able to recognize as such because they suffer from a cognitive disorder.  I have learned that I would be wasting my breath.  There is an overwhelming consensus among scientists and bible scholars of all persuasions that the earth is very very old, that evolution happens, and that Genesis can tell us absolutely nothing about our origins.  I love the Bible and I will not stand by while it is recruited for the most idiotic philosophy ever to take hold of a civilized nation in modern times.<br>  .|`|qY9svA3taa	First of all, you clearly don't understand the big bang theory and evolution.  The big bang was not a BANG like a bomb went off.  It was more of a controlled explosion.  The reason is because the universe would be in a lot more disorder if it were a true explosion.  To say that one species cannot evolve into another species is a scientific misunderstanding on your part.  If one species becomes geographically isolated, then it can evolve into another species.  Thus, the one that has become isolated will be a different species than the one not isolated.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	You can't possibly be this stupid, so I must assume you're being disingenuous instead (look it up). An explosion scatters mass over a wider area than the source of the explosion. Yes, that certainly is a "known fact". Additionally since evolution does not describe a "magical" process where one species "becomes" another, your argument there i specious and utterly lame. Get an education and a clue, in that order.|`|7K2HVodhaa	Wow. Such levels of ignorance. Like nothing I've ever read before. You clearly don't understand the points you're arguing.

Consider the evidence:<br>  <br>  Evolution is set of proven facts. People will respond by saying it is "Only a Theory", but they don't understand (or refuse to accept) that a scientific theory is a model supported by many facts that nobody has yet disproved. Other scientific theories include: the theory of relativity, the germ theory of disease, and tectonic plate theory - all are scientific "theories", and we can reliably bet our lives on them every day.  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory#Science" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_...</a><br>  <br>  To be considered scientific, a theory must be based on ideas that are "falsifiable".  Here are MANY ways you could falsify the basic concepts of evolution, but it is not proved false because... it's TRUE.  Follow the links, read the citations, this is all real science backed by real evidence.   <br>  <a href="http://www.toarchive.org/faqs/comdesc/section1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.toarchive.org/faqs/comdesc/se...</a><br>  <br>  Common sense says: if we see small changes today within species, that small changes over a long time will become large changes.  Walking for a minute gets you across the street.  Walking for a year gets you across a continent.

A LOT can happen in a million years.<br>  <br>  Paleontology and the fossil record completely support evolution. The theory of evolution even predicts some fossils before we find them.

AA11922696	Allah says in the Holy Quran     ?????????? ?????????? ?????? ????????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ?????? ??????????? ???????    (This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.)     meaning    This, indeed, is the biggest favor from Allah to this Ummah, for He has completed their religion for them, and they, thus, do not need any other religion or any other Prophet except Muhammad . This is why Allah made Muhammad the Final Prophet and sent him to all humans and Jinn. Therefore, the permissible is what he allows, the impermissible is what he prohibits, the Law is what he legislates and everything that he conveys is true and authentic and does not contain lies or contradictions. Allah said;    ?????????? ???????? ??????? ??????? ??????????    (And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice,) meaning, it is true in what it conveys and just in what it commands and forbids. When Allah completed the religion for Muslims, His favor became complete for them as well. Allah said,    ?????????? ?????????? ?????? ????????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ?????? ??????????? ???????    (This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.) meaning, accept Islam for yourselves, for it is the religion that Allah likes and which He chose for you, and it is that with which He sent the best of the honorable Messengers and the most glorious of His Books. Ibn Jarir recorded that Harun bin `Antarah said that his father said, "When the Ayah,    ?????????? ?????????? ?????? ??????????    (This day, I have perfected your religion for you...) was revealed, during the great day of Hajj (the Day of `Arafah, the ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah) `Umar cried. The Prophet said, `What makes you cry' He said, `What made me cry is that our religion is being perfected for us. Now it is perfect, nothing is perfect, but it is bound to deteriorate.' The Prophet said,    ?????????    (You have said the truth.)'' What supports the meaning of this Hadith is the authentic Hadith,    ?????? ???????????? ?????? ????????? ??????????? ????????? ???????? ?????????????    (Islam was strange in its beginning and will return strange once more. Therefore, Tuba for the strangers.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Tariq bin Shihab said, "A Jewish man said to `Umar bin Al-Khattab, `O Leader of the Believers! There is a verse in your Book, which is read by all of you (Muslims), and had it been revealed to us, we would have taken that day (on which it was revealed) as a day of celebration.' `Umar bin Al-Khattab asked, `Which is that verse' The Jew replied, s    ?????????? ?????????? ?????? ????????? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????    (This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you...) `Umar replied, `By Allah! I know when and where this verse was revealed to Allah's Messenger . It was the evening on the Day of `Arafah on a Friday.    Tafsir Ibn Kathir   http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=...|`|0BHiaVZ9aa	Many of the verses in the Qur'an which have the word "deen" in them have the word translated to "religion." or way of life. You might know these few examples...    The deen before Allah (accepted by Allah) is Islam (Imran 19)    Today, I have completed your deen, and have completed my bliss upon you and accepted for you Islam as a deen. (Maida 3)    "Whosoever seeks, other than Islam, a deen, it will not be accepted from him and he, in the Hereafter, is among the losers. (Imran 85)    Also, if you've heard the Hadith Jibrael  at the end the Companions ask the Prophet, saws, who it was asking these questions (he asks what is Islam, Iman, and Ihsan, and for Signs of the Last Day). The Prophet saws tells them, "That was Gabriel, who came to teach you your deen."    Muslims believe in the One, Unique, Incomparable, Merciful God - the Sole Creator and Sustainer of the Universe; in the Angels created by Him; in the Prophets through whom His revelations were brought to humankind; in the Day of Judgment and in individual accountability for actions; in God's complete authority over destiny, be it good or bad; and in life after death. Muslims believe that God sent His messengers and prophets to all people and God's final message to humanity, a reconfirmation of the eternal message and a summing up of all that had gone before, was revealed to the Last Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) through the Archangel Gabriel.     God instructed the Muslims to practice what they believe in. In Islam there are five pillars, namely:       1. Creed (Shahada): The verbal commitment and pledge that there is only One God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God, is considered to be the Creed of Islam.       2. Prayers (Salat): The performance of the five daily prayers is required of Muslims.       3. Fasting (Saum): Fasting is total abstinence from food, liquids and intimate intercourse (between married couples) from dawn to sunset during the entire month of Ramadan.       4. Purifying Tax (Zakat): This is an annual payment of a certain percentage of a Muslim's property which is distributed among the poor or other rightful beneficiaries.       5. Pilgrimage (Hajj): The performance of pilgrimage to Makkah is required once in a life time if means are available. Hajj is in part in memory of the trials and tribulations of Prophet Abraham, his wife Hagar and his eldest son Prophet Ishmael.|`|5sMZrmqjaa	i think u r speaking abt quran verse  i dont know which it is it says  .on this day i have completed my deen that is islam    b4 revelations were given to jesus ,moses and all prophets(pbut)  .so ther were changes in law for those people   when quran was reveled it was the last law ,there is no more rules to come after quran|`|BPFDMFitaa	I am Muslim, and Islam only became complete after Prophet Muhammad (s) announced to the people the  successorship of Imam Ali (as).......

People cried and answered: Yes, O Messenger of God. Then Prophet (PBUH) held up the hand of Ali and said: Whoever I am his leader (Mawla), Ali is his leader (Mawla). O God, love those who love him, and be hostile to those who are hostile to him.    Immediately after Prophet (PBUH&HF) finished his speech, the following verse of Holy Quran was revealed:    Today I have perfected your religion and completed my bounty upon  you, and I was satisfied that Islam be your religion. (Quran 5:3)              and that was the EXACT moment when our "deen" (religion/Islam) was completed....    the message was sent......  ....the leader was announced    we had the message.....  ...and we had the leader    all we had to do was to follow.......      and no need for excuses....|`|4PbjKk7Vaa	Praise be to Allah, who blessed us to be among -those who cling and hold to the "Wilayaat" (love, friendship and authority) of Ameer Al Momineen and all the Imams, peace be on them all........      On 18th Zilhajjah of the year 10 A.H. (10 March 632 CE) ,After completing the last pilgrimage the Holy Prophet(S.A.W.) along with the Muslims set out of Makkah. On their way back the Muslims reached a place called Ghadir-e-khumm. The following verse was revealed to the Holy Prophet(S.A.W.): " O Apostle! Deliver what has been sent down to you from your Lord; and if you don't do it, you have not delivered His message (at all); and Allah will protect you from the people ..." (Quran 5:67)    Delivery of the sermon:    On receiving the above verse, the Holy Prophet stopped at that very place called Ghadir-e-khumm.     The following is a part of the lengthy speech of the Holy Prophet (S.A.W.) which has also been narrated by all the muslim authorities repeatedly:    "It seems the time has approached when I shall be called away (by Allah) and I shall answer that call. I am leaving for you two precious things and if you adhere to them both, you will never go astray after me. They are the Book of Allah and my Progeny, that is my Ahlul Bayt. The two shall never separate from each other until they come to me by the Pool (of Paradise)." Then the Holy Prophet (pbuh) in an attempt to remind Muslims of his own authority over them said: " Do I not have more right over the believers than what they have over themselves? " Muslims answered unanimously " Yes, O' Messenger of God ". This served as a stepping stone for the announcement of his hier and vicegerent. The Holy Prophet(pbuh) held out the hand of Ali(as) and said: " For whoever I am his Leader (mawla), 'Ali is his Leader (mawla)." The Holy Prophet then continued to say: " O' God, love those who love him, and be hostile to those who are hostile to him."       then this aya(vers) was sent to prophet muhammad (saww)  ?????????? ?????????? ?????? ????????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ?????? ??????????? ???????|`|mOWyzwubaa	Majority doesnt believe or diregards 5:3     "................Today I have perfected your Deen for you, and completed My blessings upon you, and I have accepted submission as the system for you.

Muslims believe in all the prophets from Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus (peace on all of them) and Muhammad. Muslims believe that all prophets came to a specific people\land for a specific message and that Muhammad came to all of mankind as the final prophet.    2. Muslims believe that all scriptures (torah, palms... ) were all revelead to prophets through an angle to a prophet (however man changed many of the scriptures text over time) and then God sent the Quran to be the final testament and in the quran God says that he will be the one that protects it from man's changes.    So this verse means that no more prophets and no more scriptures are to come (hence , this deen (deen means religion) is completed)  as Muhammed (peace be upon him) is the final prophet and the Quran is the final revelation.       take care|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	I completed my deen when I got married 2 years ago.

These represent the two aspects of every religious tradition, firstly, as a path to God, and next, as a socio-political ordering of human life. The followers of Islam derive their inspiration primarily from the Quran and secondly, as deriving from the Quran (from the Suriah and the Hadith). All the three contain elements, what the Indian Sanatan Dharma, or Hinduism calls, Sruti, representing the first, and Smrti, representing the second, in varying proportions.    [Note: For proper understanding of this article  The Message of Prophet Muhammad, the meanings of the two terms Sruti and Smrti should be understood.    Sruti stands for the eternal values of human freedom, dignity, equality, and fearlessness, irrespective of caste, creed, colour or sex. Sruti alone is eternal, because it deals with eternal varieties, universal and human. That is why in Indias long national history, we had many Smrtis but only one Sruti  the immortal Vedas, more particularly their spiritual and philosophical portions, the Upanishads. The message of the Upanishads is, therefore, called the Sanatan Dharma, Eternal Dharma, or perennial philosophy, as different from the teachings of the Smrti, which constitute only the Yuga Dharma, the dharma for a particular yuga or age. The Smrti, which is relevant in one age, or in one country, has no relevance in another age or another country; and all social changes involve abrogation of the current Smrti and adoption of a new Smrti relevant to the new times. ]

I'll take the teachings of Christ and Christ alone, interpret them the best I can, and move on positively.  And it would make sense that it was teachings that were meant.  To go from point A to point B, you need to use information.  Teachings are information.  <br>  <br>  Paul's take on the matter is of much less interest to me.|`|AA10198840	No. He meant that through Him... who He is  and what He has done... is the only way we are able to come to God. Salvation comes from the mercy and grace of God, who forgives those who He will... those who have asked to be forgiven and are repentant (have sorrow) for what they have done.<br>  <br>  There is nothing we can do to deserve or earn salvation and there are no passages that support this concept. There are some that state that our works shows our faith, but but like salvation our faith is not determined by what we do.<br>  <br>  The Gospel, or "Good News", is not about what we can do, but what He has done. Christianity is not about adherence to a "religion", but coming to the living God and having a relationship with Him... because of and through Jesus Christ.|`|AA11989753	Jesus is the Living word John 1:1 and the Bible is the living written word.<br>  <br>  Romans 10:9That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 10:10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.<br>  <br>  Jesus saith unto him, "I am the way and the truth and the life; no man commeth to the Father but by me."

AA10637643	There is no "doctrine" saying one way or the other... but we tend to be fine with modern medicine.  If someone needs it, and they want to take it, they do.<br>  My mother takes anti-anxiety medicine.  My husband does also.  Both are temple recommend holders.  Depression and anxiety are diseases.  Medicine helps.<br>  <br>  There is nothing stating "mind-altering" whatever is a no-no.  The Word of Wisdom clearly states coffee, tea, and tobacco, and a few other things.  IF the person was taking the drugs for a different reason other than intended, well, then that would be a problem.|`|2ZO7vFC1aa	I don't think merely saying that we avoid "anything mind-altering" gives an accurate picture.  We aren't against the medicinal uses of many substances.  I don't think taking morphine for the fun of it is something condoned by our beliefs, but taking it after having surgery is ok.<br>  <br>  If our religion prohibited anything "mind-altering", I think that would mean we didn't believe in anesthesia either...that's certainly mind-altering.|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	My dad was OCD and refused to get theraphy, my brother...well my parents would not tell me what ws worng with him, he is on mental disability from the state, my mom was depressed and refused to get help for her, I had an uncle who was schizo, I don;t know if he got any meds, he left the church.

We take prescription medication just like anyone else who needs it in their lives.  We don't agree with illegal drug use but what you mention is hardly that category of drug.  I know plenty of LDS folks who are on medications such as these.  We have nothing whatsoever in our beliefs or doctrines that exclude us from taking medications. Perhaps you misunderstood or else she misunderstands something or has some personal extreme beliefs that are her OWN and not the churches. We do have our fair share of fanatical notions that float around with people in the church.... as do most churches.|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	I'd say that's between the individual and his or her physician. :]|`|TzY9vkinaa	Depends on the Mormon.<br>  <br>  I am personally against it, I have seen too many bad results after friends used them.... or old friends. I've seen them become selfish and distant from the Spirit. My best friend (who is/was Mormon) all of the sudden became very mean to me after taking anti-depressants. He then told me he didn't want to be friends with me because I kept him from doing things he wanted to do (such as watching bad movies, swearing, flipping people off). I just don't like anti-depressants.<br>  <br>  I do understand that there are things that drugs can help. I work in a home for mentally handicapped people. I give a handful of drugs to some of them every morning, if I didn't they'd go crazy.<br>  <br>  The Church doesn't say they should not be used, many Mormons are on them.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	We believe we shouldn't abuse drugs.  We have no problem using them for medical purposes.  These questions are left up to the individual.  Regarding caffeine, some do, some don't.  The counsil is to be wise with what we bring into our bodies. <br>  <br>  Utah actually has a higher than average use of prozac.  Many speculate that it's because while many non-mormons self medicate with alcohol, cigarrettes, or tobacco, most LDS members do not.  <br>  <br>  I suspect he was refering to illegal drugs when he used the term "mind-altering".|`|xyIZv6iiaa	actually - one criticism of the lds church is that anti-depressant use is relatively high in the state of Utah (not that only LDS live there) (edit:  Oh.  I see oceanwoman and others have pointed that out already) - anyway, part of the reason for this oddity may be the fact that the LDS church is very open and encourages it's members to seek help for medical problems.  It is not frowned upon if needed, and it is not considered to be a 'bad thing'.  <br>  <br>  It is, as others have mentioned, between an individual and their physician.|`|8UTdi5G0aa	I believe that they have a "medical necessity" clause to the basic "no drugs" rule.  They are trying to avoid damage to the body ("temple").  When you think about it that way, it is a pretty good guideline for the rest of us too.

That should not be mistaken for hate of an imaginary god.<br>  <br>  Sometimes we point out how illogical one god or another is.  Again, that shouldn't be mistaken for hate.  Do you hate Thor, or do you just believe that he isn't the real cause of lightning and thunder?<br>  <br>  Sometimes we're appalled at the joy and anticipation with which theists look forward to our supposed eternal torture.

But I will make fun of what I want to.|`|355JLlcLaa	I don't hate what I believe is a mythical supernatural being.<br>  <br>  I realised in mid-teenage that faith was based upon nothing but itself, that science explained nature satisfactorily without needing supernatural beings, and that religious beliefs were no different to those of ancient beliefs in gods and goddesses. <br>  <br>  When I first had doubts about my faith - I was Catholic - I thought that maybe this was a test of my faith. So I made the effort to accept it even more so. But the doubts came again, and I wondered what would happen if we took faith out of the equation; the world and nature still made sense, so I saw no reason to get back into it. At the time this was difficult intellectually and emotionally (I was a teenager, after all).<br>  <br>  That was getting on for 40 years ago, and my escape from faith has freed me to embrace what science has to offer, which I consider far more plausible than belief in the supernatural, and is the nearest we can get to the truth about how nature and the universe work. I've felt a sense of freedom ever since, and am happy and at peace with this.<br>  <br>  I still have an interest in religions, mythology and related matters, and am fascinated that people still believe in things that to me are just not true.<br>  <br>  Belief in a god probably goes back to times when people didn't understand how the seasons worked. And when winter came and the crops no longer grew, some sort of sacrifice would have been made to the sun, and then it came back and the crops grew. The people would have associated the sacrifice with the positive outcome, and they wouldn't have dared not do it again because they couldn't risk famine.<br>  <br>  In time the sacrifice will have become more sophisticated, and perhaps the idea came about that the sun might be the gift of a god rather than the god itself. This might be a way, or similar to a way, that religion developed. <br>  <br>  People would then have assumed that the laws that their ancestors devised came from the god, so the religion would have become even more sophisticated still, providing authority for the laws and fear of a vengeful god if laws were disobeyed, and the same fear would make others stone to death anyone who breached a law to avoid vengeance being visited on the whole community. <br>  <br>  There are probably other elements, but it will have gone back to the dawn of civilisation.<br>  <br>  The idea of the biblical God changes throughout the course of the Bible as does the name, and there seem to be several changes of Deity. For example, when Moses encounters God, God introduces himself as Yahweh (I am who am, I will be what I will be, etc), which is a different name to that used at the beginning of Genesis, Elohim, a plural of El a Canaanite (Phoenician) deity; continuity with previous beliefs is maintained by claiming to be the God of Abraham, Jacob (Israel) and Isaac. In fact the first Creation myth in Genesis probably derives from the Babylonian Creation Epic, Enuma Elish in which the Creator God's name is Marduk, probably via the Canaanites.|`|LqyOHY37aa	You are misunderstanding the issue. We don't hate you imaginary friend because we don't believe in him. That would be silly. Also, disagreeing with your outrageous claims is not mean or hateful.

Seriously, if you're going to try to refute big bang theory, you really must learn what the theory says, first.

If the singularity was matter packed so tightly that everything in the universe was the size of a dot, how could individual atoms exist?  <br>  <br>  You seem to think that the Big Bang happened and within a few seconds, the earth formed.   Wrong.  Billions of years went by before our particular solar system formed.  It formed the same way the other trillions of stars and planets formed, and they all formed at different times.  <br>  <br>  There is life on earth because the earth can support life.  Theists always assume that the earth can support life because there is life on it, but that's backwards.  If the conditions that would support life did not exist here, we wouldn't be here to ask the question.  If the conditions on earth could support some kind of life but not the life we know now, a different kind of life would exist here.  Anything that couldn't survive in these conditions died and those species that thrived in earthly environments lived.  Why is that hard to understand?<br>  <br>  It's not blind faith when you understand it.  You think your lack of understanding proves that it can't be true.  All it proves is that you don't understand.|`|b1e7acd9969e11fd38ae40bfed0968bfaa	When we say that the Big Bang created our universe that is a bit misleading.

K3F3f8kKaa	I'll answer your questions in order as best I can:<br>  <br>  Matter can become solid by the particles being closer together. Basic chemisty.<br>  Matter being in a solid form has nothing to do with it. All that was requires was a strand of DNA or RNA, which is made, like everything else, from particles.<br>  Adaptation. I'm no biologists, and don't know the exact process, but mutations occur in mitoses (cell separation). If these mutations are benefitial to the enviroment then is greater chance of survival and passing on these traits.<br>  I doubt it would happen like that, but matter could.

That doesn't change the fact that you and apes and palm trees share common ancestry.<br>  <br>  How did it all happen?  Bear with me, as I'm no scientist and this not easy to squeeze into a short answer.<br>  <br>  Billions of years ago, something happened to create a group self-replicating organic molecules.  We don't know how, but there are theories, and it's been demonstrated in a lab recently.<br>  <br>  The molecules that were better at replicating "survived" while others stopped replicating.  There was some kind of random element to this replication, so some were a teeny tiny bit different than their "parents".  Now and then these differences resulted in benefits that helped them survive to replicate more.  This went on for as long as a BILLION years, these things slowly added complexity and beneficial features through this randomness, before even the first multi-celled creatures took form.<br>  <br>  Little by little these replicating creatures added beneficial features as they evolved to fit different environments.  At some point photosynthesis developed.  Later, once there was oxygen in the atmosphere, he ability to consume oxygen for energy also developed.  So around 1.6 million years ago, plants took one path and animals took another, around 900 million years ago early arthropods split from other animals, and so on. Bear in mind this is not an exact science yet because things didn't fossilize much back then.<br>  <br>  Fast forward through another billion years and a few major extinctions (including the dinosaurs) to some agile little creatures in Africa.  They'd developed grasping hands for living in trees, but some of them found a better living out in the grassy plains.  Those that could stand upright for long periods of time (like you see lemurs and meerkats do today) were able to see danger and food over the grass.  Eventually natural selection favored those that could stand so much that they developed the hips, legs and balance to be bipedal all the time.<br>  <br>  Through another 10 million years, those that stayed on the plains, little by little, got taller.  And at some point some clever critter learned that rocks and sticks made better weapons than bare hands.  Selection favored those that could use tools better than those that couldn't, and a bigger brain developed.  The bigger brain led to more complex social interactions which led to selection (natural and sexual) further favoring more intelligence.  So the steady pressure of time, variation and selection led inexorably to the development of what humans are today.<br>  <br>  So all because of a simple mechanism (replication with randomness), a simple principle (successful organisms live to replicate, others don't), an obvious trend (useful features are retained, leading to generally increasing complexity), and LOTS and LOTS of time, we went from pre-life to humanity.<br>  <br>  Oh, and it helped to be lucky.  We only had a few major extinctions.  Our planet has remained intact.  The Sun is fairly stable as stars go.  And we've not had any planet-frying gamma ray bursts in the past 4 billion years or so.

If you have a son that is born with 7 fingers, His offspring will have 5. Its just a genetic mistake that wont be repeated."<br>  to that i showed him the following video... i have yet to hear back from him, saying he was wrong.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQeDKjxMKbU&feature=rec-HM-fresh+div" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQeDKjxMK...</a>|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	Caboose is right, you're arguing abiogenesis. <br>  Here's an article about it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_life" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_l...</a><br>  And another:<br>  <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob...</a> (which is geared toward creationist arguments, so it should be very helpful to you)<br>  And another:<br>  <a href="http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-definition/Abiogenesis/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-defi...</a><br>  <br>  There are several hypothesis, as you will read, none so simplistic as what you've presented.<br>  <br>  Now, I don't want to see you out making assumptions again until you've done your reading! *waggles finger*|`|MYrwcjDSaa	With the points you have raised you've shown that you do not possess even a rudimentary understanding of evolution. <br>  <br>  I suggest reading the book "Your Inner Fish".

Many people seem to want to separate the theory of evolution from abiogenesis  That is because abiogenesis cannot be proven despite the claims of some that it has or that it will be soon. If you don't separate the two issues then it becomes a potential fatal flaw for evolution. How can people describe evolution as blind and unguided if life cannot be seen to start with blind unguided forces. Hence the anger directed to anyone who points this out. No one wants to hear these kind of truths when they have already full embraced the evolution theory without reservation. It doesn't matter that all lab research done has only hurt the cause. What has been shown in the labs is that life just doesn't come together like they thought or hoped it would and a variety of different scenarios have been used in the last 50 years hoping to imitate the conditions that are believed to exist during the primordial soup.|`|74b388eca668facf7bdd1f57af916ab9aa	1) Matter to solid - most matter is solid, liquid, and gas at varying temperatures.  You are asking why something is as it is and always will be, to which I answer that it is the only way it can be wish such an arrangement of molecules.  General magnetic, gravitational, and charge attraction fields explain why this is the case.<br>  <br>  2) Solid into life form - It did not necessarily have to be a solid that was the first life form.  Amino acids are created when an electrical current is run through salt water, all it would need to do is combine with a carboxyl (made of carbon and oxygen, the 3rd and 4th most abundant elements in the universe, next to hydrogen and helium) to make a protein, the building block of life.  If these proteins were to link up together near an energy or food source, it could start a series of automated reactions that would result in replicating single celled organisms.  This is not spontaneous, this took a very long time, certainly not a year or perhaps even a thousand.<br>  <br>  3) First life evolves - Single celled organisms developed the means to maximize energy input by living in a symbiotic relationship with one another or with other similar single celled organisms, which created the first multi-cellular system.  Eventually, these systems became refined enough to make fish, of which a few eventually became amphibians, of which a few eventually became reptiles, of which a few eventually became mammals, of which a few eventually became primates, of which a few became hominids, of which one group became humans.<br>  <br>  4) Solid to life form - A rock itself cannot become life, but parts of the rock can come together with parts of other things, in which amino and carboxyl acids are present and driving replication processes and conceivably become life.  We are not there technologically yet to make this happen, but seeing as how we can replicate and alter DNA relatively freely, I do not think technology to create synthetic life is that far off.  Give it another hundred or so years.  Just because we do not understand it now and cannot do it ourselves does not mean that we cannot.  Remember, TVs and airplanes did not exist and were thought impossible before the last century.  Now they are commonplace.<br>  <br>  5) Bars and wood pieces left outside - You don't understand what evolution is.  Evolution is change.  You are making an incorrect value judgment that evolution is more "advanced".  I will certainly argue that the iron rusting is more advanced and complicated because there used to just be a solid iron bar, not there is solid iron surrounded by a casing of ferrous oxide (rust), which is two things instead of one.  Just remember the law of conservation - nothing is being created or destroyed, just rearranged.  Everything tends toward decay without an outside energy source that builds it up.<br>  <br>  6) Everything else - There is no such thing as de-evolution.  There is only evolution.  Evolution means change.  It means that something has changed slightly (or even greatly, hypothetically).  If it works well in the new environment, it gets passed on to the organism's offspring.  If it doesn't, the organism dies, and the change was only a temporary shift that went way in favor of the old form.|`|AA11490975	Your questions.<br>  <br>  1) How did some matter turn into a solid?<br>  Does not deal with Evolution.<br>  <br>  2)How did a solid turn into a life form?<br>  Does not deal with Evolution.<br>  <br>  3)How & why did that first life form further evolve and turn into millions of other life forms?<br>  Finally evolution.  First, this took billions of years.  Imagine that.  Billions of years.  I don't think you imagined enough.  Billions of YEAAARS!    Single-cell to multicell to nucleus - membranes - cephalization to backbone/chordate - tetrapods - land animals and massive rapid diversification.  Evolution, in all, takes more than a text box.<br>  <br>  4) Can a solid -a rock turn into a life form?<br>  Does not deal with Evolution.<br>  <br>  5)Let's do an experiment:<br>  Place some things outside such as a solid iron bar, a solid steel bar, a solid plank of wood, a living flower with some grass around it, and a solid rock and leave them totally alone. Don't move them. Don't disrupt the setting they are in. Don't care for them in any manner.Leave them totally alone in the elements.Let nature take it from there.<br>  Now wait a year (or more if you can) and go back and inspect them. What has happened? Did the iron get more advanced or did it start to deteriorate? Did it get rust and decay on it? Will it evolve and get better/stronger or worse?<br>  Would it be about the same way with the raw steel? Was the flower still there? Did lesser foliage like dandelions, weeds, clover, spring up? Was the flower even alive? Was mold, mildue, insects, and rust present? So-did it further evolve and get better/stronger or worse? The wood. Better or show wear & deterioration?<br>  Does not deal with Evolution<br>  <br>  6) If you are in a climate such as the northern, eastern, or mid western USA, the climate changes a great deal season to season. Very cold in the winter, snow, etc. Very hot & humid in the summer-rain, storms, windy, etc. From these vast changes could the rock splinter, crack have mold on and under it? Is that evolving or dis-evolving?<br>  Does not deal with Evolution|`|AA12193600	Errr--clear you are totally uneducated.  But okay you're experiment was good--excellent with one tiny flaw.  Do everything you said--and then come back in `10,000,000 years.  Now--the iron bar should be gone according to chemistry and physics.  Plank of wood should be gone according to chemistry and physics.  Now--look at the local flora and fauna 10,000,000 years later.  Wow--although from the DNA of the fauna in this now tropical habitiat we can see it's forebearer millions of years ago was a dandelion--but wow--it's a whole different species now evolved to live in a different environment--and wow--it won't cross with a dandelion--which makes it a different species.

If everyone followed just the Ten Commandments alone, and threw everything else out.... the world would be very peaceful.  But the Christians whom do these awful things don't follow the commandments.  Many religious and non-religious people do horrible things on a daily basis.    Calling Paul the creator of Christianity is an old Atheist fallacy.  It's like a Creationist saying that a living mole was carbon dated to be a million years old.  It's old material and has no leg to stand on.    Mankind is just evil.  If you think Christianity causes violence, then you're guilty of two fallacies.  1.  If you're an Atheist, then you are hypocritical.  Blaming a man-made book for violence is admitting that a God wrote it.  An intelligent Atheist would not take this argument.  They would know that it is written by man, thus violence is man's fault.  Books don't carry guns my friend.  2.  You have turned your back on the history of your man.  Atheist regimes, such as those of Pot and Stalin, were quite ruthless and bloody.  They didn't use a religion for an excuse to execute and persecute innocent people.  Japan didn't need one when it invaded China during WWII.    edit:  Notice that they don't follow them.  I said "follow" them, not post them.

More people have been slaughtered in the name of the caring loving Christian god than for any other reason throughout history.  The followers are definitely a misguided and hypocritical bunch.  Among the fundamentalists, it's the same "if you aren't for me, you're against me" mentality that fundamentalist Muslims have.  If they don't believe the way they do, they should die.    As for gwhiz1052 comments, it's the perpetuation of this kind of ignorance that continues to breed the intolerance on both sides.  In all the time before the Roman Empire embraced Christianity, the biggest number of Christians killed you will find among actual SCHOLARS is 100,000--not "millions"--and it is realistically a lot less given the population.  And since when was "well, they did it" a valid argument except in the back seat of the station wagon on the way to the Grand Canyon when you were 7?

As long as we don't know what causes Evolution nor why it happens, it will stay a theory.  This is why it is compared to gravity.  We know it's there and that it happens, but don't know why or how.  But evolution is based on facts and observations.

And scientific  theories are ALWAYS provisional and open to alteration or abandonement based on new observations and data.    "According to Stephen Hawking in A Brief History of Time, "A theory is a good theory if it satisfies two requirements: It must accurately describe a large class of observations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definite predictions about the results of future observations." He goes on to state, "Any physical theory is always provisional, in the sense that it is only a hypothesis; you can never prove it. No matter how many times the results of experiments agree with some theory, you can never be sure that the next time the result will not contradict the theory.     On the other hand, you can disprove a theory by finding even a single observation that disagrees with the predictions of the theory."   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory    Such, however, is not the case with Darwinian evolution theory since there are many facts and observations which disagree with it's premise and predictions.     The fact that evidence from around the world shows that dinosaurs lived concurrently with man or the fact that there are many areas of missing transitional fossils which should have been discovered by now after 150 years of exhaustive searching. Even Darwin asserted this as well as many modern Professors, scientists, museum directors, etc such as Stephen Gould and David Raup...many of them evolutionists.   http://www.creationscience.com/onlineboo...    "Eldredge and Gould proposed that the degree of gradualism championed by Charles Darwin was virtually nonexistent in the fossil record, and that stasis dominates the history of most fossil species."  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_...    http://www.dinosaursandman.com/    Or population studies which show that mankind originated around 6000 years ago according to known and accepted mathematical formulas for population growth.    http://www.kolbecenter.org/heffner_popul...    The Bible states that flawed evolutionary thinking is not a new idea....some people in ancient times believed they originated from rocks and trees.

Firstly, there are so many different ways to express yourself as a lesbian.  There are no strict rules of behaviour, attitudes, dress or how we have sex! There are so many 'shades' of behaviour between lesbianism and transgenderism. What I'm saying is explore your lesbianism first. People get hooked up on butch and femme, but being a butch lesbian is a wide experience too.  It is not about wanting to be a man , it is about envying the freedom they have with women, the clothes they wear which are less restrictive and more comfortable than traditional women's clothes. it is about experimenting with and developing feelings about yourself and how you relate to other women.  Being a lesbian has nothing to do with being a man...we have nothing in common with men when you analyse it. Wanting to feel in control, or powerful does not have to come with disrespect, aggression or inverted sexism.  Lesbians who do ape the worst excesses of male behaviour directed at women are in my opinion reprehensible.  Basically, be yourself, be the sort of woman, lesbian you feel happy being, and then if you still feel that you are not fulfilled seek out those who have transitioned and ask their advice.  Sorry this was long too...good luck!|`|pIKZaa23aa	well personally i dont think going through with the surgery is the best idea for you especially since ur still unsure    also u might not be a trans u could just be an androgynous girl    but if u give it some time u might realize what u are later    dont feel like u have to rush through things

Just enough to get your dirt and then demand scriptural evidence!<br>  <br>  It's not a novel concept: <br>  <br>  The doctrines of faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost became distorted or forgotten.  Each generation inherited a state of apostasy, as people were influenced by what previous generations passed on, including changes to Christ’s gospel.  Some inspired people, such as Martin Luther and John Calvin, recognized that practices and doctrines had been changed or lost and tried to reform the churches to which they belonged.  Without the priesthood authority, however, Christ’s gospel could not be returned to its original form.  <br>  After centuries of spiritual darkness, a restoration of truth was needed.

When the 12 apostles were killed, priesthood authority to minister properly the affairs of the church was lost from the earth.   This apostasy started even before the apostles were all gone, as they Paul and others, referred to it in their Epistles found in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Here are some of many Biblical references to an "apostasy" or falling away from the true church.  All are from the Bible.<br>  <br>  Apostasy of the early Christian church: This people draw near me with their mouth, Isaiah  29: 10, 13. <br>  Darkness shall cover the earth, Isaiah  60: 2. <br>  The Lord will send a famine of hearing the words of the Lord, Amos 8: 11. <br>  There shall arise false Christs and false prophets, Matthew 24: 24. Grievous wolves shall enter in among you, Acts 20: 29. <br>  I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him, Galatians 1: 6. <br>  There will be a falling away before the Second Coming, 2 Thessalonians 2: 3. <br>  Some people err concerning the truth, 2 Timothy 2: 18. <br>  Some people have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof, 2 Timothy 3: 5. <br>  The time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, 2 Timothy 4: 3-4. <br>  There will be false prophets and false teachers among the people, 2 Peter 2: 1. <br>  Certain men crept in denying the only Lord God, Jude 1: 4. <br>  <br>  The need for a "restoration" and "resitituion" of the gospel is predicted in the Bible.<br>  <br>  God’s reestablishment of the truths and ordinances of his gospel among men on earth. The gospel of Jesus Christ was lost from the earth through the apostasy that took place following the earthly ministry of Christ’s Apostles. That apostasy made necessary the restoration of the gospel. Through visions, the ministering of angels, and revelations to men on the earth, God restored the gospel. <br>  <br>  LDS Church members believe that the Restoration started with the Prophet Joseph Smith and has continued to the present through the work of the Lord’s living prophets. <br>  <br>  The Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, Isaiah 2: 2 (Micah 4: 2). <br>  God will do a marvellous work and a wonder, Isaiah 29: 14. <br>  God shall set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed, Daniel 2: 44. <br>  Elias will come, and restore all things, Matthew 17: 11 (Mark 9: 12).   Mormons believe that Elias appeared to Joseph Smith in the Kirtland Temple as fulfillment of this prophesy.<br>  <br>  There will come times of RESTITUTION of all things, Acts 3: 21. <br>  In the dispensation of the fulness of times, God will gather together in one all things, Ephesians 1: 10. <br>  <br>  I saw another angel, having the everlasting gospel to preach, Revelations 14: 6.

Constant inflow, such as by watching TV or sitting at endless lectures in school instead of going out and participating in life....these are the things that blunt imagination!<br>  The greatest geniuses of all time were home-schooled and often spent little time at school and more time out there in life learning for themselves by their curiousity and yearning for knowledge!

6100f239c1abd562ada33e5323d1c871aa	As salaamu 'alaikym, my overly dramatic and unrealistic friend.    Bishillah ir Rahman ir Rahim,     Insha'Allah, always obey Allah, Subhanna wa Ta'ala, who has given you your parents a guides to assist you in following the revelation and teachings of the Holy Qur'an and the Sunnah al Hadiths.    You have chosen to make something an "absolute" when, in fact and in reality, is not.    Thoughts and emotions change with time, either growing with understanding or disappearing with the ever changing winds of life which blow and flow in an unconstant manner.    At the age of 24 years you should have already begun to realize such.  If you have not, you will in time, insha'Allah.    Love is ever changing from the first glimmers of a romantic ideal to the life long lived experience of mutual sharing, caring and support.  It is not well portrayed in romantic novels nor in the all too foolish love songs that fill the airways and croon out of a radio nor in the "Hollywood" depictions of such ideals.    Insha'Allah, marriage seems designed to teach one to love another more than ones self, to place others as equally as important as ones self and to teach such hard learned lessons to those who follow one, such as ones children.    Once we have learned such in a family setting, we learn, realize and can put into practice doing so outside of such a situation and, thereby, live the faith we profess as we strive to serve Allah, Subhanna wa Ta'ala, and Him alone and to demonstrate such servitude by how we love others.    This is similar to what we learn from obeying and following the directions of our parents which should be likened to following the revelations and teaching of Allah, Subhanna wa Ta'ala.  We learn that we do not always know what is best and that it is often wise to submit ones personal will and ego to those who are wiser and more knowledgeable just as we submit our own will and ego to the Will of Allah, Subhanna wa Ta'ala.    Insha'Allah, you have been shown and have been guided to the "straight path" which you have recognized but now seem to wish to choose not to follow.  One might ask how you can deny that which you have been given and shown simply so as to satisfy your own ego and pride in the delusion that "you" know better and that you know all that will happen in the future?      Insha'Allah, my friend, realize and admit that Allah, Subhanna wa Ta'ala knows best, place your trust in Him and live your life for Him.  If you choose to do otherwise, you will be making a "lie" out of the Holy Qur'an, out of the Sunnah al Hadiths and a liar out of Allah, subhanna wa Ta'ala, which can not be.  Alhumdulillah!    May you be rightly guided.     Anything that I may have said that is correct is from Allah, Subhanna wa Ta'ala and all praise and glory is for Him and for Him alone.  Alhumdulillah!  Anything that I have said that is incorrect is from myself and I pray that Allah, Subhanna wa Ta'ala, will, in His Mercy and Compassion, forgive my error and lead me on that straight path that is Islam.    Ma'a salaam.|`|MrnLdm9Uaa	well.. i guess u been with your parents for more than 20 years which is definitely less number of years with that girl.     After the Almighty, your parents knows much better about you. I appreciate you obey them and still have a respect for your elders. I will recommend just go ,,, with your parents and leave the result on Allah. Inshallah everything is gonna be fine.    Btw. I 26 and been with a girl for 7 years ... we had a breakup coz of our family decision. and Its been 2 months since i get married. I am quite satisfied with my life. Although it hurts a lot but you never know what Allah has chosen for you.     God Bless you.|`|I4vil6LRaa	"...tell them you are going to marry the person anyway and that you don't understand what is Islamic in them trying to deny you happiness in life or choosing your lover and then follow through and marry the person"    Choose that one, especially if the other person's muslim..i don't see the problem tbh :)|`|DO7lDtqxaa	First and Always obey Allah. Love and respect your parents.I know you probably do not want to hear that. Prayer and patience is the key to any thing. Nothing come but from the will of Allah.Alhumdulilah for everything. What you want may not be what Allah has planned for you.Ask for strength in accepting Allah's will.   Time changes things. Maybe in time your parents will agree. It took my husbands family a while to agree for him to marry me.Eventually they did accept and we all are very happy. Just give it some time. You are still young. Allah can do anything.. even change a heart and mind.|`|9QhnQNFyaa	love is such a fickle feeling that can always fade due to environmental factors.there is no movie-style  love  in the real world. and u wont ache for years like u think u will. we have all fell in and out of love many times and we all carried on..so try to see what your parents object in this girl and discuss matters. usually parents have an overall view that proves to be correct later on in life.  u seem a bit tooo romantic and i really  hope u take  a mature  decision.good luck|`|y5i8ITVpaa	I may be incapable to show you the verses of Qur'an which could tell about this kind of problem you have, but I will try to answer it as good as my heart told me about it. Please read my answer first, before you make any judgment.    It must be understood by everybody who lives in islamic environment that a muslim woman doesn't really have certain privilege to make her choice about whom she will marry. This privilege is (fortunately or unfortunately depends on each person) owned by her parents. As a muslim woman, I could only tell you that I will respect the choice made by my parents. But to respect this choice doesn't mean that I will immediately accept them. In Islam, there is a kind of prayer which is known as shalat istikharoh. By doing this prayer, you can ask Allah   to reveal the best choice for me. The answer won't come immediately and I must be very careful in differentiating whether the answer is really Allah's answer or shaitan's answer. When I know the answer with certainty, then I will act according to it.    But in your case, I believe, you have that certain privilege to choose your own spouse. You are a male, and male in Islam are known with their rationality and logic in making decision concerning their own lives and others. If I were you, first, I would bring the girl that I met online and introduced her to my parents. With that, maybe, my parents' heart would melt (if the girl that I loved happened to be a kind, gentle, and faithful girl). And do istikharoh as well (if you are muslim). Ask guidance from Allah SWT. And if you are very certain with your decision, do it and tell your parents that as a man, you are required to make your own decisions and take consequences from them. You are, after all, an adult and a male, and it's not your parents' place to rule your life. But remember to do it gently, never hurt your parents' heart. At all. Tell them that your decision is made with careful thinking and pondering and by reliance to Allah SWT.     You may say that I answered your questions easily by "blurting out that I would obey my parents". But you need to know that as long as I have been living (which is not very long at all) I always try to keep my heart for myself. I dare not to love someone as much as you have because I'm afraid that the one I love is actually not the one I'm destined to be with. Maybe it's different with us all.    Remember, that with effort, your struggles may be fruitful. Never give up! And also remember, that to love is to let go. Tell your lover this. If both of you are destined to be with each other, then don't worry, you would be. Even if it isn't in this world, it may be in the afterlife. Then, you will be with her immortally, loving, cherishing, and forever in peace..
4fTiCNiKaa	Yes I have lot's of experience just like that, and a few that were similar.<br>  <br>  Funny you should ask, but just last night after church service I was approached by a couple who asked me to agree in prayer with them. The woman worked at a hospital that deals with allot of babies born addicted to drug's, and she was wanting the Lord to give her the opportunity to be able to pray over each of those babies. As soon as they asked me, I asked a lady who had recently joined to church to agree with us right there in the foyer. After I explained to here what we were praying about, she asked me if I knew that she was a nurse, and that she too worked with children with such problem. Of course, I did not. So we all joined hands, and agreed in prayer and in faith for the doors to be opened.<br>  <br>  Praise God! He is the same yesterday, today, and forever!<br>  <br>  Great question.<br>  <br>  Elder Greg<br>  ~SFECU~<br>  pray4revival<br>  &<br>  pray4theR&S|`|AA10198840	Yes, especially if you are living by His Spirit. He knows the other person and their needs more than we do. Words, a verse... I have even seen just the mention of His name do profound things. God's love is a most wonderful and powerful thing. It is humbling to be used in such a way. To Him be all glory, power and praise.|`|AA11502346	Yes, it's happened before and it is strange.|`|Im9cwUIyaa	I think it's all in your head.  No offense.|`|VdTn7Gmbaa	Not strange, really.  <br>  My short-term memory is poor at times, anyway.  ((smile))   <br>  The Lord speaks through me in Yahoo Answers... <br>  and if I touch somebody's heart, it's not me.  It's the Holy Spirit.<br>  I would share an experience with you, but guess what?<br>  I've already forgotten! lol!  (only teasing)<br>  <br>  I find it profound, and am so blessed <br>  whenever someone tells me their heart has been touched by the Holy Spirit in this way.<br>  <br>  Just allow the Lord to have His way, <br>  the next time you talk or pray with someone.  <br>  I pray He opens your eyes to His presence.<br>  I think you already know.  You are blessed, as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  Interesting question.<br>  May you be blessed even more!|`|cIZS6Wr2aa	Yes!    That's how you know it's the Lord giving you the words to say.  I think we forget sometimes that it's His work not ours.  We are just His vessels and servants.|`|s2TJ6H1raa	I have had experiences like this but I think you have to be fully conscious to appreciate it, and you also have to be fully conscious to appreciate God.|`|u8SeGmnZaa	Sorta... I was nervous as heck due to the fact i'm 14 and was talking to like... 70? year olds.|`|rAXkpuzIaa	Yes, God has used me in several different ways to witness to others. Sometimes I forget what I have actually said or done, but when someone tells me that my words or actions have made a difference in their relationship with the Lord, my memory is restored! I give all honor & glory to our Heavenly Father & am very thankful to Him! The experience is sort of strange in "human understanding" & words cannot fully describe the feeling.|`|sYuTNoEJaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  I had someone ask me a very hard question once and (as he was speaking) I asked God to give me the answer.<br>  <br>  He did and as I spoke the answer just came out of my mouth..............I marveled at it because I had wondered about that myself.<br>  <br>  I've also had this happen in prayer when someone says, "You prayed exactly right for my situation" and I don't even remember what I said.|`|x3ZpztsVaa	*calls 911*<br>  <br>  "...and have had this happen myself..."<br>  <br>  How can you be so darn sure it wasn't SATAN???|`|xRUZkFU9aa	It's called tongues :)|`|mimykKnhaa	Yes. The words that have been brainwashed into your head will come out once in a while. Its like listening to a stop-smoking tape in your sleep.|`|lTx8Hoheaa	Yeah, I forget stuff all the time. It isn't the Holy Spirit, it's called a bad memory.|`|4sUek7ugaa	That has happened to me, too.   A couple of times I've found the exact right words with which to tear a creationist argument to pieces, then later couldn't remember what I had said.   And once when I was testifying in a court case I was able to snap out a great answer to the opposing lawyer's "gotcha" question without thinking.<br>  <br>  Still think that proves your god?|`|HBp5r76haa	I have been writing letters to a few people, prompted by their questions or circumstances, explaining my Faith and what I believe in and what the LORD has done in my life. Then, when I re-read those letters, I could not believe it was me writing. First of all, English is not my first language, but the style of my writing was impeccable (it normally isn't!). Second of, the level of doctrine and knowledge are by far above what I know I possess.<br>  <br>  I know it was the Holy Spirit writing.|`|bsHkZH1kaa	I have, but I don't forget because I usually write it down or type it on my laptop so I never forget.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Yes, I have had this happen, in prayer time too, either praying by myself or with someone else.
2AqU4SjYaa	You asked, "why does everyone see female strippers as slutty, whorey, coming from a bad background, no respect, and do drugs??"    The answer would probably be that (statistically speaking) most would fall in the above mentioned categories.   Ask any cop.  Yeah, on TV they are all college students working their way through law school . . . . but that's TV, not real life.  Talk to a cop.  Do some research.    Many were victims of rape or sexual abuse as kids, and so now THEY are going to be the one "in control" . . . calling the shots.      It is a sad, sad profession with lonely (horny) MARRIED men putting into a money of the g-string of a woman so he can imagine that she might want to sleep with him . . . just because he is a nice guy . . . not for money.  When, of course . . . exactly the opposite is true.  Without the money in his hand . . . the woman won't even go near his table, or look at him.    It is a sad, sad profession, . . . if you can call it that.   The only "winners" are the club owners.    Male strippers?  Oh please . . . . 90% are gay.  So stripping for women is just too funny . . . . stripping for other gay men . . . see above, same rules apply as the female stripper.  No cash . . . no interest.      Basically it is a legal form of quasi-prostitution.    Dan in Miami|`|VpR6qvb5aa	I think female strippers are sexy.  I do not feel the same way about male strippers.  So there is MY double standard.    I don't automatically assume that all strippers have problems. I wouldn't say that I assume they are sluts, but I certainly don't think of them as being sexually inexperienced, either.    I have a friend that used to be a server at a strip club. She claimed that "all" the strippers were drug addicts, that would readily turn tricks, if offered enough money. I always though that she was exaggerating.    I hope she was wrong- I actually am very fond of strippers (females, I mean).|`|4PQOiSfZaa	The reason people see strippers as unclassy is because they are dancing around half naked for money. That is unappealing to most people. And there is also a stigma about strippers, they generally live fast lives. Male strippers are no different. Their dancing is actually worse. I've been to Chip & Dales and it was gross.|`|28ace4b478f0d1936cd87055ad9fff5eaa	Chris Rock says the real double standard is that men with no money never have sex. But women with no money have no problem finding someone who will have sex with them.   This is the same thinking that applies to your question.|`|QkBJeSyeaa	I need pictures to answer this question....JK ummm probably bc history has made people think that the sexuality of women should be oppressed and kept behind closed doors.  Probably the same reason that a guy who has sex with multiple partners is the man but a girl who does the same is a slut or a tramp.|`|Ux9lRTaSaa	I hold the same views of male strippers as I do of females.  I don't like them.  I would never associate with them.  Same goes for men & women who sleep around with multiple people.  They're both sluts, in my opinion.      "why does everyone see female strippers as slutty, whorey, coming from a bad background, no respect, and do drugs"  Why? Because 97% of the time they are.  Same for male strippers, except most of them are gay.|`|2aab9990f44abc785cfb7c119b182bdeaa	being a stripper is just another job i guess  i dont see them any thing differently, sexy yes but only on stage    off stage they are all normal girls

However, the aim is not to try and convert people. We have been told that we should convey the message to the best of our individual ability and then leave the rest to God.<br>  <br>  There is a very in the Quran which says "There is no compulsion in religion" . contrary to a lot of the the other readers comments..<br>  <br>  I hope you found the above to be of some use.|`|iXI7n6Gmaa	It is misunderstood by many Muslims and Non-Muslims that Islam demands to convert people.<br>  <br>  What they do not understand that we are ordered by God to spread the word and tell the people and let it be a free choice. As the Quran declares it loud and clear there is no compulsion in religion.<br>  <br>  God tells Mohammad when he was so eager to convert His dying uncle who refused to believe that you do not guide whom you love but God guides whom He will (meaning He knows better who deserves guidance) <br>  <br>  What people fail to understand is Islam organizes State Matters and Regulated Politics, and certain political and defense actions enforces certain reactions that wrongly associated to the spiritual part of Islam. <br>  <br>  Spiritual and Social activities though separate are covered under one umbrella in Islam but they have different rulings and jurisdictions. In the west they claim that religion and politics are separate though they in many ways interact to the point of being inseparable.<br>  <br>  Just like USA took it upon itself to spread freedom of the word and democracy, Islam real mission was the same and had done so 1400 years ago. Just like USA failed to perform their mission of the just cause, in a perfect manner and caused many afflictions. Muslims too, due to Human weaknesses and errors did mistakes, but far less than what is happening now, read the history with open minds.  <br>  <br>  Just like USA (the freest country) made communism illegal as threat to the US security, Muslim States too made illegal to profess a paganism beliefs (like Arabs before Islam) that not based on a legal book (like Jews and Christians who were protected under Islamic Political system)|`|0DC6d8pOaa	Islam is definitely a proselytizing religion.|`|htQrkD8waa	because thier gun and torture devices do the proselytizing for them.

I think you can teach them, though it might be easier if you're using more parts of your body than just your hands as humans do in sign language.|`|GznItj4saa	Not sign language as such but yes, you can teach a dog to understand hand signals for things you would normally teach a dog.|`|dCewrtXaaa	Of course. Hunting dogs are trained that way. They have capabilities beyond what they are often given credit for. Not only in sign language, but in intuition. Take a look at this:    http://www.popularscience.co.uk/reviews/...|`|43df0b4a9c6483ef52c3528781726646aa	Yes.They can be taught what different signs mean.Make sure though that the signs are inthe right language.|`|5d37d4f98abd6f19efdef6def4ace044aa	Yes, dogs actually respond better to signals than words. My dog was deaf, and he was well trained. I also took care of my sisters dog for a bit, and even after 2 years he responds to the hand signals.     He could sit, lay down, play dead, come and go away. Don't worry about teaching him sign language words, just make sure you use a consistent signal that is simple (put you wouldn't use for another reason) and you are comfortable with.    Like for sit - I would put my hand out palm up and raise it up. Play dead I would make a gun with my fingers.

Through him all things were made   For us men and for our salvation   he came down from heaven:   by the power of the Holy Spirit   he became incarnate of the Virgin Mary,   and was made man.   For our sake he was crucified under Pontius    Pilate; He suffered death and was buried.   On the third day he rose again   in accordance with the Scriptures;   He ascended into heaven   and is seated at the right hand of the Father.   He will come again in glory to judge the living   and the dead,   and his kingdom shall have no end.   We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver   of live, who proceeds from the Father and the   Son.   With the Father and the Son He is worshiped   and glorified.   He has spoken through the Prophets.   We believe in the holy catholic and apostolic   Church.   We acknowledge baptism for the forgiveness   of sins.   We look for the resurrection of the dead,   and the life of the world to come. Amen      Catholics believe that Christ founded one Church and one Church only, of which He is the Head, and that this church will stand until the end of time. "Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it, not even till the end of time".|`|67e4501c0c56a505b86d4b14fc9a8330aa	Padua gave the correct answer, but I would like to respond to CJ's misconceptions:    "The first Christians in ACTS in the Bible were NOT CATHOLIC. They were fundamentalist in doctrine. Read Acts for yourself and see."    Funny, I do not see any mention of sola scriptura, "faith alone", the rapture, the symbolic nature of the Eucharist, altar calls, slain in the Spirit in the Boodk of Acts.     "Catholicism didn't exist for over 300 years later."    St. Ignatius of Antioc used the word "catholic" to describe the church in the year 100 a.d.  Catholic means "universal" as in the mission was to the entire world.      "Catholicism teaches a false gospel of works ("sacraments") that leads to eternal hell (Galatians 1:6-9). Catholicism is not Christian"    This is incorrect.  Catholicism teaches that slavation is by the grace of God.      "Jesus wants to have a personal relationship with you. Catholicism cannot give you this."    Obviously a very prejudiced statement.  How can a person who makes prejudiced statements such as this have a personal relationship with Jesus?     "Catholicism = faith + works = no salvation and eternal torment in hell"    Please read Jesus' parables.  He made it very clear that faith without works is dead.    "Christian = faith alone in Jesus for salvation, without our own works added = salvation and eternity in heaven with Jesus! :)"    You cannot find the man made doctrine of "faith alone" in the Bible.  The only reference to "faith alone" is in James letter, in which he states.  "Faith alone cannot save"      "Salvation is a FREE GIFT"     Wow, even CJ can get something correct    "that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation."    CJ, you need to listen to Jesus when He says that only those who endure to the end will be saved.
5oNwMqMiaa	Gald you're healthy again!  Protein comes in many forms, have you been having a lot of milk, yoghurts, cheese, eggs, fish, soya, quorn, beans or pulses?  It's not particularly a bad thing, but can place strain on some organs, especially kidneys and liver.  But without knowing what type of protein you're eating, it's difficult to judge.  On the Atkins diet, for example, it's usual to produce  protein and ketones in a sample.  It's also usual if you exercise a lot or are pregnant.  Just make sure you eat a balanced diet and have plenty of fruit and veg, steer clear of processed foods and eat protein in the above forms.  Your doctor should have advised you if he thought you were at risk, don't be afraid to contact him again to clarify what he said to you though, as it's usually not connected to diet.  Enjoy :-)|`|H7L66ynJaa	Cheese and dairy products, but consult uyour doctor and dietician|`|50UbJp14aa	read about it here  http://lowcarbdiets.about.com/od/whattoe...  eggs, beans, pork, nuts and seeds,, fish, chicken, beef.|`|R2mNsqSHaa	fish!!! meat. pulses, vit. supplements, lots of things :)|`|HLmdbcFzaa	Meat and beans are high in protein, there is nothing wrong with it, it just means that you fart alot, now everyone on Yahoo knows you fart all the time!|`|jAIFDXfEaa	Some examples of foods high in protein include meats, poultry, fish, dairy products, lentils, beans and soy products.|`|385371073e8d53b7e0a56851b570adabaa	It has little to do with what you are eating.

A second source of protein in urine is blood that may come from any part of the kidney or urinary pathway.    High levels of protein in the urine may therefore be due to diseases of the kidney such as glomerulonephritis. It may also be due to general illnesses that also affect the kidney as in high blood pressure or heart failure. Infections of the renal pathway may cause a high level of protein in the urine. This finding is an important part of investigations for several conditions and is extremely important when considered with other symptoms that together indicate the cause.    I guess you should ask your doctor, because high protein food is not the cause of it.  Good luck

Editionis Sixti Quinti Pontificis Maximi iussu recognita atque edita) is the edition most familiar to Catholics who have lived prior to the liturgical reforms following Vatican II.<br>  <br>  After the Reformation, when the Catholic Church strove to counter the attacks and refute the doctrines of Protestantism, the Vulgate was reaffirmed in the Council of Trent as the sole, authorized Latin text of the Bible.[32] To reinforce this declaration, the council commissioned the pope to make a standard text of the Vulgate out of the countless editions produced during the Renaissance and manuscripts produced during the Middle Ages. The actual first manifestation of this authorized text did not appear until 1590. It was sponsored by Pope Sixtus V (1585–90) and known as the Sistine Vulgate. It was based on the edition of Robertus Stephanus corrected to agree with the Greek, but it was hurried into print and suffered from many printing errors. It was soon replaced by a new edition by Clement VIII (1592–1605) who immediately ordered corrections and revisions to be made. This new revised version was based more on the Hentenian edition. It is called today the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate, or simply the Clementine, although it is Sixtus’ name which appears on the title page. Clement published three printings of this edition, in 1592, 1593 and 1598.<br>  <br>  The Clementine differed from the manuscripts on which it was ultimately based in that it grouped the various prefaces of St. Jerome together at the beginning, and it removed 3 and 4 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasses from the Old Testament and placed them in an appendix.<br>  <br>  The Psalter of the Clementine Vulgate, like that of almost all earlier editions, is the Gallicanum.<br>  <br>  The Clementine Vulgate of 1592 became the standard Bible text of the Roman Rite of the Roman Catholic Church until 1979, when the Nova Vulgata was promulgated.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  What's the problem??? What is at stake?!? I'm a protestant so I actually read a bible translated from pre-1592 manuscripts.. but whatever.. The stories are all the same... they were just moved. And additions in the beginning were added. None of the stories were completely re-written to say something different than they already said. Maybe you should actually read up on stuff instead of taking little nuggets and crapping them all over the internet.<br>  <br>  And people seem to forget that the New Testament is actually a compilation of letters written by the apostles od God inspired by God. Some of the letters have been lost, some where not included. Some still exist today, and many do not. If you just take the historical facts from the new testament and then compare them with writting from historians who were NOT christians or jews, they will back up all of it. So to believe it to be completely false is idiotic.|`|v7Wflu78aa	Regarding above answers: I really appreciated the history of translations - thank you.<br>  <br>  The other answers did not mention the problem of taking one specific translation as THE one LITERALLY to believe.<br>  <br>  That is one problem with taking a sacred text literally, and no one addressed that issue.|`|AA11103371	Great point!  <br>  <br>  Why is your book the right book and my book is the wrong book?

God gave us the 10 Commandments by "His own finger," the second set of stone tablets after Moses smashed the first because the people were sinning while he waited on God for 40 days on the mountain. Those rest in the ark of the covenant to this day...those were penned by God.<br>  <br>  For the rest He inspired His chosen followers, devout and honorable, and faithful, whom He gave the most important task they could ever be blessed with, to record His interaction, His Word, His commands for all humanity for our benefit. You don't really think they would take such a responsibility lightly do you? The Hebrew scribes had such a painstaking process when recording scripture...that if even one character was smudged or in error, they would burn the entire prepared skin they worked upon and would start over form scratch...preparing a new sheet, blessing the materials, etc...it was a highly ritualized and Holy process that was taken as seriously as a secular individual today might compare to handling the hope diamond coated with the hanta virus or weapons grade uranium.<br>  <br>  The Reformation was in response to the scriptures being corrupted by a government Theocracy for hundreds of years...it was a restoration to the original Hebrew and Greek Manuscripts (of which I mentioned earlier), which is why if you look up Martin Luther's 99 theses you can see a direct confrontation with Rome and the indulgences that were taken with scripture, pun intended. There was a deviation from scripture which he learned when he was sent to study the original Hebrew and Greek documents (Greek being the "common" tongue of the age). There was a major distinction because the people were falsely led to believe they needed to rely on the priesthood to have a relationship with God...that they could buy their salvation, or release a person in Hell for money to the government. The Vulgate was also written in Latin while all other translations were banned upon pain of death, and the vast majority of people could not read Latin, except the nobility and the priesthood. The fact that anyone could speak to God and have a real relationship with God was subverted by a theocracy that had become corrupted by power and which had the power to control information which is from where their power stemmed. <br>  <br>  The common translations we have today are all, if you cross reference, stating the exact same message, perhaps with additional explanation, or summary, but it is the same message that was translated from the original Hebrew and Greek. Scripture is not changed.<br>  <br>  What is condemned is when the Word of God is changed to bear false witness of Christ, that Jesus is not the Messiah, That He is not our only way to the Father, that Jesus is not the Way and the Truth and the Life, that He is not the Son of God, that Jesus is not the Word of God, that He is only a Prophet, that Jesus did not die on the cross and rise again, that Jesus is not God who came in the flesh. That He is not God. That there is no resurrection, all these things are condemned and are how you know a "version" is false doctrine. The Vulgate added purgatory, and indulgences...etc, read Luther's 99 Theses. Scripture says we die once and then the Judgment, there is no waiting period and no possibility of parole, no working off our sins, etc, this denies that Christ paid for our sins on the cross if we believe in Him. These additions are what is damning and so very dangerous to a person's soul. They cause confusion and take away from the work that Christ/God did on the cross. Islam says much of the above, Mormonism does not believe Jesus is God, Jehovah's Witnesses do not as well, nor does Islam.<br>  <br>  We are not to add to or take away from the Word of God, and just as Jesus summed up the Spirit of the Law of God when He said to love God with all your heart mind and soul, and love your neighbor as yourself, the Spirit of the Word is unchangeable and eternal.<br>  <br>  It is easy to see many translations and mistakenly believe that there is error because of the use of the word "literal." Yes the meaning of the Word of God is taken by many Christians literally, but is the "exact" word used in the German version translated so simply in English? Perhaps not, but the true meaning is maintained. The three translations that I find most easy to read are the NKJV, NAS, NIV, and sometimes I will cross reference the HCSV.<br>  <br>  They are not written in divine ink, and they were not handed to me by an angel. They are copies, carefully preserved throughout history by those who love God and seek to do His will. If I had no other means but to copy God's Word in my own handwriting, just so I could have a copy of my very own, I would do so, and I would be very careful not to leave anything out. This is just my own personal principle...and I believe that the people who risked life and limb and were often executed for it, also took the task just as if not much more zealously than I do who am not under constant persecution.<br>  <br>  Take Care<br>  <br>  Edit* As for the word virgin...the Hebrew word for maid was used...or maiden. In Jewish culture, anyone considered maid or maiden was referring to an unwed female. It was a death sentence to be other than a virgin if unmarried, so the word virgin was most likely used to clarify. Mary would have been a virgin "because" she was a maiden. It was not something that needed explanation to Jews, but to the Gentile believers it would have been.|`|mSFjbetxaa	NONE are correct.<br>  <br>  "The KJV because it is most accurate. There was a study done on all the versions, and the KJV has the least amount of syllables which relates to why the KJV is most accurate." - a really dumb fundie who needs words with less syllables.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The origin of the English Bibles of today can be traced to a time when men, SUPPOSEDLY under the divine inspiration of God, first wrote the books of the Bible. Before the fourth century CE, there were more that 30 different gospels, some of which can be found on the Gnostic & Apocrypha page. Many were officially outlawed during the Council Nicaea in 325 CE and the Council of Laodicea in 364 CE. These councils eventually agreed on what is now considered the "word of God", under the direction of Constantine, collating the ACCEPTED teachings into a single comprehensive book. <br>  <br>  Most of what we now know as the Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew, and the New Testament largely in Aramaic or common (koine) Greek. Since no printing press existed until 1450 AD, all of the original compilations of the Bible were done by hand. <br>  <br>  The history and development of the English Bible can be divided into 3 sections; ancient versions, in other languages, early English versions, and New English versions (since 1901). Brief descriptions of the significant versions in those time periods follows. <br>  <br>  Ancient Versions in <br>  other Languages<br>  <br>  · The Septuagint Version (285 BC) - This was a translation of the Old Testament Hebrew Scriptures into Greek. Probably done in Alexandria. <br>  <br>  · The Samaritan Pentateuch (BC?) - A copy of the Hebrew text done in Samaritan characters. <br>  <br>  · The Peshito or Syriac (1st or 2nd century AD) - A common language translation of the entire Bible used in parts of Syria. <br>  <br>  · The Codex Sinaiticus (330 AD) - A manuscript that contained the Greek Bible. It was purchased from Russia in 1933 by Great Britain and is now housed in the British Museum. <br>  <br>  · The Codex Vaticanus (340 AD) - This manuscript is currently housed in the Vatican library in Rome. It originally contained the whole Bible plus the apocrypha, but parts have been lost. <br>  <br>  · The Vulgate (400 AD) - A Roman Catholic scholar in Bethlehem by the name of Jerome translated the entire Bible into Latin. This Bible became the standard in the Catholic church for well over 1,000 years. <br>  <br>  · The Codex Alexandrinus (425 AD) - This Bible is another Greek translation. Currently housed in the British Museum, it is complete except for 40 leaves. <br>  <br>  Early English Versions<br>  <br>  All of the earliest attempts at translating the Bible into English were fragmented. For example, Bishop Aldhelm of Sherbourne translated the Psalms into Old English around 709. Venerable Bede, a monk at Jarrow, translated a portion of the Gospel of John. By 900 AD all of the Gospels and most of the Old Testament had been translated into Old English. <br>  <br>  · John Wycliffe (1380) - John Wycliffe was the first to plan a complete English translation of the Bible from Latin. His translation was based on the Latin Vulgate. He completed the New Testament prior to his death, and his friends completed the work after his death. <br>  <br>  · PRINTING PRESS INVENTED - 1450<br>  <br>  · William Tyndale ( 1525-1530) - Driven from England by persecution, William Tyndale, shared Wycliffe's desire to produce a Bible that the common English-speaking person could understand. Using the Latin Vulgate and other ancient sources, Tyndale was able to translate the New Testament and Pentateuch before he was martyred. <br>  <br>  · Miles Coverdale (1535) - A friend of Tyndale's, Coverdale was able to publish a complete Bible. It is generally believed Coverdale used Tyndale's work in producing his New Testament. This Bible was done to honor King Henry the VIII. <br>  <br>  · Matthews Bible (1537) - Despite the name, it is widely accepted that a friend of Tyndale, John Rogus, did most of the work on this Bible. Based largely on Tyndale's previous work, it also contains evidences of Coverdale's work as well. This might well be considered an updated Tyndale Bible. <br>  <br>  · The Great Bible (1539) - This Bible takes its name from its great physical size. Based on the Tyndale, Coverdale, and Matthews Bibles, it was used mainly in churches. Often chained to a reading desk in a church, people would come to listen as a minister read from the Great Bible. <br>  <br>  · The Geneva Bible (1560) - Produced in Geneva by scholars who had fled persecution in England under Queen Mary, this Bible was based not only on the Great Bible, but also on the other English translations of that day. Though very scholarly, it was a popular Bible because of its small size. <br>  <br>  · The Bishops Bible (1568) - This was a revision of the Great Bible and Geneva Bible done under the direction of the Archbishop of Canterbury during the reign of Elizabeth. <br>  <br>  · Douay-Rheims Bible (1582-1610) - The New Testament was published in Rheims in 1582 and the Old Testament in Douay in 1610. A revision of the Latin Vulgate, this has become the generally accepted English Version for the Roman Catholic Church. <br>  <br>  · King James Version, KJV (1611) - The most popular translation ever produced, this Bible was done during the reign and at the urging of King James the I of England. 47 scholars, divided into 6 groups, worked on this translation. Based largely on the Bishop's Bible, many Hebrew and Greek texts were also studied as well as all the other available English translations, to insure the best results. By choosing men of many different theological and educational backgrounds, it was hoped individual prejudices of the translators could be minimized. Printed in a handy size and in clear type, the KJV was suppose to please clergy and congregation alike. Despite initial resistance, the KJV became and still is the largest selling translation of the Bible. <br>  <br>  · Revised Version (1881-1884) - Designed to be a revision of the KJV, the Revised Version, had the advantage of being able to access some of the ancient manuscripts. Although this revision was sponsored by the Church of England, many American scholars were invited to participate. <br>  <br>  New English Versions <br>  (1901 to Present)<br>  <br>  · American Standard Version, ASV (1901) - This revision of the Revised Version incorporates many of the readings first suggested by the American members of the Revision committee of 1881-1885. <br>  <br>  · Complete Bible: An American Translation (1939) -Often referred to as the Goodspeed version, this translation was done by Edgar J. Goodspeed and J.M. Powis Smith. Using as many ancient texts as possible, Smith and Goodspeed produced a very readable and yet accurate translation. Also included in this translation was the Apocrypha. <br>  <br>  · Revised Standard Version, RSV (1952) - The National Council of Churches of Christ procured the copyright to the 1901 ASV Bible in the 1920's. Work began on a revision to the ASV, but was abandoned in favor of an entirely new translation. Since many more Hebrew and Greek manuscripts were available to these scholars than were available in 1901, the RSV is considered to be much more accurate. A Very readable translation, the RSV is used in many Protestant denominations today. The revision committee continues to meet at regular intervals and in 1971 a new release was made of the RSV. This has been dubbed the RSV II edition. <br>  <br>  · New Testament in Modern English (1958) - First published in 1958 and revised in 1973, this translation done by British writer J. B. Phillips is one of the best readings of the New Testament. It is published today by MacMillan Publishers fo New York.|`|lJ2baVliaa	I have the KJV, NKJV, NIV, NCV, ESV... and I cross references with the NASB and NLT... compared side by side, which I do every day... they say the same thing just in a different way.<br>  <br>  The best way to explain it is this...<br>  <br>  If I'm talking to you about God, I'll talk like I do to any adult.

Ok, so we don't know if Solomon had 500 horses, or 5,000 horses, but we still know that we are to repent of our sins.  How does a translation problem with the number of horses Solomon had remove our moral responsibility before God?  (I used this particular example because it was thrown in my face, so to speak, as "proving" that the Bible is inaccurate!  It really doesn't prove a thing.)<br>  <br>  The Bible still says that we have all sinned and fall short of God's glory, and it still says that the payback for those sins is death, and it still says that Jesus is the only one who can rescue us and set us free from those sins and their eternal consequences.<br>  <br>  As far as the minor discrepancies, I'll find out in heaven.

"And they slew of Moab ... about 10,000 men ... and their escaped not a man." 3:28-29<br>  <br>  # Shamgar kills 600 Philistines with an ox goad. Praise God. 3:31<br>  <br>  # "The Lord discomfited Sisera ... with the edge of the sword ... and there was not a man left." 4:15-16<br>  <br>  # Jael (our heroine) offers food and shelter to a traveler (Sisera, Jabin's captain), saying "turn in my Lord ... fear not." Then after giving him a glass of milk and tucking him in, she drives a tent stake through his head. "So God subdued on that day Jabin." 4:17-23<br>  <br>  # For murdering her guest while he slept, Jael is "blessed above women." (Hail Jael, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women....?) 5:24-26<br>  <br>  # "So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord." (Let them all have their temples pierced by blessed women.) 5:31<br>  <br>  # "The LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man." God promises to help Gideon kill all the Midianites. 6:16<br>  <br>  # When Gideon and his water-lapping companions blow their trumpets, God forces all the enemy soldiers to kill each other, killing 120,000. 7:22, 8:10<br>  <br>  # Two princes are killed and their heads are brought to Gideon. 7:25<br>  <br>  # For refusing to feed him and his army, Gideon tears the flesh off the elders of Succoth and kills the men of the city. 8:7, 16<br>  <br>  # Gideon orders his son to kill two kings, but he refuses. So Gideon has to do it himself since his son isn't "man" enough to do it. 8:20<br>  <br>  # Abimelech kills 69 brothers "upon one stone." (He was trying to get in the Guinness Book of World Records.) 9:5<br>  <br>  # God sends evil spirits that cause humans to deal treacherously with each other. 9:23-24<br>  <br>  # God smites Sihon and all his people and gives their land to Israel. 11:21<br>  <br>  # "Whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we [the Israelites] possess." 11:24<br>  <br>  # When "the spirit of the Lord" comes upon Jephthah, he makes a deal with God: If God will help him kill the Ammonites, then he (Jephthah) will offer to God as a burnt offering whatever comes out of his house to greet him. God keeps his end of the deal by providing Jephthah with "a very great slaughter." But when Jephthah returns, his nameless daughter comes out to greet him (who'd he expect, his wife?). Well, a deal's a deal, so he delivers her to God as a burnt offering -- after letting her spend a couple of months going up and down on the mountains bewailing her virginity. 11:29-39<br>  <br>  # 42,000 men are killed because someone mispronounces "shibboleth." 12:6<br>  <br>  # Samson rips up a young lion when "the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him." Later, when going to "take" his Philistine wife he notices a swarm of bees and honey in the lion's carcass (a Divine miracle -- or just rotting flesh and maggots?). 14:5-8<br>  <br>  # "And the spirit of the Lord came upon him [Samson], and he ... slew thirty men." (Samson might have been a decent person if he could have kept the spirit of the Lord off him.) 14:19<br>  <br>  # Samson catches 300 foxes, ties their tails together, and sets them on fire; the Philistines burn Samson's ex-wife and father-in-law; and Samson smites them "hip and thigh with a great slaughter." 15:4-8<br>  <br>  *******<br>  <br>  Those of you touting one version over the other have no evidence to back up that they are more accurate than any other (except the actual Hebrew texts).  That's what people told you, so that's the way it is.

In January 2000, Entwicklung und Zusammenarbeit, the German development magazine, described de Soto as one of the most important development theoreticians of the last millennium. In October 2005, over 20,000 readers of Prospect magazine of the UK and Foreign Policy magazine of the U.S. ranked him among the top 13 "public intellectuals" in the world from the magazines joint list of 100.    De Soto has been praised by U.S. presidents from both major parties, with Bill Clinton calling him "The worlds greatest living economist", George H. W. Bush saying that "De Sotos prescription offers a clear and promising alternative to economic stagnation"and Ronald Reagan saying "De Soto and his colleagues have examined the only ladder for upward mobility. The free market is the other path to development and the one true path. It is the peoples path it leads somewhere. It works." He has also received praise from United Nations Secretaries-General Kofi Annan"Hernando de Soto is absolutely right, that we need to rethink how we capture economic growth and development"and Javier Perez de Cuellar"A crucial contribution. A new proposal for change that is valid for the whole world."De Soto is also mentioned prominently in The Age of Turbulence by Alan Greenspan."

When Western countries competed to develop their prosperity in medieval period, Eastern countries just became the places to be exploited, just for westerner richness. So, something that made them in poverty is not religion, but the lack of well educated people. they need time to progress.

There is a lot of debate about it because it is one of the major religious icons of the Christian faiths.<br>  <br>  There's also a lot of speculation that the Holy Grail is actually something else because, in French, San Greal (Holy Grail) and Sang Real (Royal Blood) are so similar.  The DaVinci Code speculated that the Holy Grail was actually the living descendant of Jesus.  This, of course, has raised a lot of ire amongst Christians because they believe Jesus was celibate.  However, in the DaVinci Code, Dan Brown (the author) pointed out that it was the duty of Jewish Rabbis to raise families in the time of Jesus, and he was a Rabbi.

If you are truly a friend you will stop wrrying so much about whether he is gay or not and just be there for him through thick and thin like any good friend would be.|`|875b8a67d51aea3c2aba301f8e93dbe2aa	The fart test.

He's not had boyfriends has he?|`|Xgm680dCaa	hes your best friend it shouldn't matter if hes straight or gay    just be his friend if he feels the need to tell you he will    unless your interested in him romantically let it go or ask him|`|AA10067344	If he has sex with another man, that's a dead giveaway.|`|aPcw0sz7aa	Why do you really think he is gay? Because he didnt have alot of girlfriends? Or because his 2 bestfriends are girls?     These are stereotypical questions, im sorry but being gay doesnt  mean you hang around girls and you had a low amount of girlfriends. He doesnt sound gay to me at all. If he starts making out with another guy, then start drawing conclusions, but for now, dont worry about it|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	He doesn't act like it, he doesn't say he is, and he's had 2 girlfriends.  No, he's almost certainly not gay, unless he's deeply in denial about it.  It's still possible that he's bisexual, though.  Why don't you ask him?|`|OsxQNDHzaa	If he's your best friend, just ask him!!!  :@)|`|vRPqfdlaaa	Does he like to look at male crotches?|`|W6mVWqGFaa	OK go to the mall point out how nice a man's butt looks if he agrees he is gay or possibly bisexual!!!|`|MyzX8WcEaa	He doesn't show any signs of being gay, and he has had two girlfriends, unless he is in denial, he is almost certainly not gay.
NOTc1b9saa	That is sad..I*m so sorry..I lost my girlfriend many years ago when she was 23..I know how it feels..<br>  <br>  People dont usually do that without their being unbalanced on some inner level..That doesnt mean crazy, it means being out of emotional balance at that moment for it is not normal behaviour, obviously..<br>  <br>  What folks who do that dont realize is that they will be the same person with the same feelings five minutes after they die to what they were five minutes before, except that they will have denied themselves the physical means to sort things out..<br>  <br>  It is highly likely, however, that he will have been met by either a loved one or an Angel, for we are greeted with Love and compassion when we pass over, and NEVER judgement and condemnation, which are products of humanity or the church teachings, not of God*s.<br>  <br>  Another thing we dont realize is how important our thoughts are, for when we pass over, whatever our thoughts turn to, we find ourselves there or with that person..Thus, if your bf was *lost* he might well think of his home and might therefore find himself there, but of course he would think of you also, so you might feel his presence sometimes also, but as I write this, I dont sense he is lost, but quietly being helped by the Angels to come to terms with what has happened...<br>  <br>  Prayers are always valuable, as is sending your Love to him, for he will be aware of your thoughts and, obviously, needs your Love and support rather than your understandable frustration and grief, so try to be positive..Love heals, and what you send our will come back to you many times over..Email me if you feel to do so..|`|dFBccLExaa	Usually, if the death is violent, they will stay where they died. Though that's not always teh case. I'd say that either way, you're likely to be able to communicate with him, as most spirits linger for a while before headingto an afterlife anyways. <br>  I'm sorry to hear of your loss. I know it's rough.|`|XBI9ekydaa	Sorry about your friend, but ghosts aren't real.  Your boyfriend is no more in that apartment than he is in the graveyard he was buried.<br>  <br>  Nobody can say with absolute certainty what happens when life as we know it ceases.  Anyone that tells you otherwise is either a liar or a fool chasing fairy tales.|`|6f0e45a91719820a0d453b3ba6acce13aa	No. He is gone, and the idea of ghosts are nothing more than a demonic trick.<br>  To try to communicate with one that has died is sin, and can cause great grief.<br>  Sorry for your loss, but the fact is, he cannot be contacted.
140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	Science itself, and particularly the continued studies and advancement of DNA is the best argument against evolution.    Recent DNA studies reveal that the DNA of each species in more unique to the species than ever before. While a variety is similariteis do exist, there is still no "missing link."|`|hYzfzu9yaa	No such thing as an "evolutionist"    Evolution has NOTHING to do with the origins of the universe, Earth or the beginning of life on Earth, or whether or not there is a "creator". It is not the alternative to creationist thinking - it is a verifiable fact supported by years of research and evidence. Please open and book and learn what evolution REALLY is before jumping to incorrect conclusions.    Evolution has NOTHING to do with atheism. There are people of faith - even Christians - who accept evolution. And there are atheists who do not.    No, you can't prove your god, or any others. If you could, it would have been done by now.|`|kFpFU97zaa	Evolution has nothing to do with how we got here.|`|4Mg2sSdkaa	Evolution does not attempt to explain the origin of life on Earth.  Understanding that evolution occurred once organisms appeared and investigating how this happens does not depend on understanding exactly how life began.    See abiogenesis.    M-O-O-N that spells "GAWD been done did it!".    The beginning of knowledge is fear.  What a twisted, cult mind set you have.|`|qRue8Xdraa	:) There are none.     Evolution isn't even the theory of the beginning.|`|dDhHSB6vaa	The FSM did it!    He changes all of the evidence with His Noodly Appendage.  We do not know why He does these things, for He has a strange sense of humor.    May you be touched by His Noodly Appendage!    R'Amen.|`|hj76FSKdaa	Trying to disprove evolution is pointless.  Even if the theory was discredited, it does not lead to the conclusion that God must have created the universe.  The better question is what specific evidence there is that the world was created by intelligent design.  Of course, no one is going to prove absolutely that God created the world, otherwise there would be no need of faith.|`|138I80Dkaa	It is impossible to teach someone there is a GOD.  Only the Holy Ghost enlightens individuals to the precepts of Christ and Spiritually borns them.   God bless,  Hoyt D. F. Sparks, SL|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	There is no way anyone can prove God to a person who has no interest in believing in Him.  This goes for anything in His word, the bible, as well.    Jesus told a parable of a man who was in hell.  He begged father Abraham to go back and warn those still living of the consequence of rejecting the one true God.  The reply?  If they desire not to know, not even a person come back from the dead will convince them.    There is no amount of "evidence" anyone will believe.  Only God can open the eyes of those who are blind.|`|p6wwiQG3aa	Yes. Have every evolutionist stop breathing for 15 minutes. Proof will then be available. Otherwise..   there is no proof available besides faith      And evoltuion is an attempt to explain the creation...without the creator|`|dE9OmE71aa	Well, there is a bit of proof to support either side. I (atheist) choose to not believe either theory until something with full fledged proof is found. The fact is, they are both just THEORIES. There are ways to prove and ways to disprove them both.    ~~~Salaam~~~

8d3c310ed6ead7da8c8134d693b622b6aa	"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."-1Corinthians 13:4-7    "what shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means. We died to sin, how can we live in it any longer?

fmHyfVmVaa	In a very real sense Loving others as you Love self can happen when your concept of self expands to include your brothers.  There are 2 ways to see this statement. One is to Love your neighbor as you Love yourself. Or, to Love your neighbor as yourself. The self Jesus refers to is the part of us that is real, the part without the programs & error.   Blessings!

You must become that you would Love!|`|3acdeb00c5e3b78aa35777fb098bdcc6aa	The Lakota have a phrase, "MItakuye Oyasin", which translates as "All my relations" or "All my brothers and sisters of Tunkashila". As though to say that we, with "we" denoting all living things right down to the dirt we walk upon, are all interconnected and related to each other by living together in this mysterious and often mad world. It's essentially a kind of oneness, one family of creatures, beings, sticks and stones, sea and air.

'Self' is referred to the 'ego' that has to be curbed.|`|cd90bdbfbdbc932425e85fdd6f03e510aa	It's all about levels, isn't it.    If I am stuck at the level of the ego, the 'selfish self' of which Buddhism speaks, then self love is a process of discovery, an effort of will. I feel pain and I undertake a journey to discover what it is that I am doing or have done to cause that pain. Then I do that which will alleviate my suffering.    Later I may discover an 'essence', a silent presence, lovely but unseen because it is itself that which is doing the seeing.     There may come a point at which I, the seen, and the very act of seeing itself all vanish for a period. When one comes back from this state of 'not being', there is the knowing that one has been love.|`|Rc9SNllPaa	All love is to be directed toward the Supreme Absolute Personality of Godhead. He is the only One who can fully reciprocate with our love. He Knows us perfectly and what will satisfy us. So we should surrender our love and devotion to Him in His loving service and become free from our own egotistic lusty selfish desires and give the Supreme Personality the love, devotion and full respect that He is due as the creator and owner of everything. Then our life and love propensity will be fully satisfied when in harmony and service with our eternal Lord and lover.

I now have a most difficult type of P.T.S.D. and need to find a reason each and every day to go on, and love of self is very far down on the list of reasons to make one more day worth living. I have spent most of my life holding the regard for others higher than for myself. I have treated others the way I would so love for them to treat me (and they never do) for as long as I can remember.     I have always (As far back as I can remember) considered myself but a tool of the Maker in all the many names "He/She/It" used. There are many times when answering one of these questions when my answer seems to write itself, like now... I have always used the royal plural to mean that the "Ourselves" he was referring to was himself and the FATHER... Many have told me I am wrong. Many of a Tribal Nature have told me that we are all a part of GOD. The next time I get a chance to do a face to face with old J.C. I'll ask him for the both of us!    ME!    It was just brought to my attention that I should share that I have LIVED with my daily reason to go on one more day for over 30 years now! Thank You for your caring, and you all know who you are! I am not saying I will not go on, but rather that for me to go on I have to have a reason... and getting 20 people to smile, 10 people to laugh, 5 people to think about a better way to do something, and save one life a day... these are the ways I can be worthy of yet one more day.  .|`|6dL7UGvfaa	I dare say I have studied or even read original or even about it. Yet, I may hasten to add my understanding of what you have presented. By loving God with all heart and soul first, you imbibe Him, you become Him ( anything shown to light become light, you see ). Then, that is you, self, ourselves.And, secondly, that embodiment of Love/Him/now you, should spread to all/neighbors. It may be a very wild imagination of mine on what you have presented, but I am aware/experience of such a process!|`|08H81poqaa	The self-love is to be directed toward the spark of the child within.  Once we turn the love towards the Divine in us, then this allows a love for all other "selves" or a Oneness love for all others.    God is in us, we are the Divine and this gives us the natural Divine love for our neighbors.    If we hate our enemies, we hate ourselves.  If we are angry at a friend it is only hurt which is within and this is being angry with the self, for example.    Excellent question.    Peace.  Amanda.|`|n3Rx3PYyaa	.  To love others as ourselves is to not treat others any less than we treat our own self.    Problem with that is some don't value or treat their own self very well.  If they don't value and love their own self then it's no suprise that they don't (or don't know how to) love others in valuing way.    I like the phrase. . ."Value self and others".  Some say it's selfish to love self . . .To like, care for, cherish and value your own self.  To love self is celebrating that Light within that is of the One Light (God).  Cherish and value that Light within and understand that Light is one stream that's connected to Light of all beings.  We are all varied streams of Light of the one Light . . .The One Light God.  We are all one.    A child is taught and learns to love his parents, family home.  He is loved as part of that family unit. i.e. self-love.  With that foundation, understanding and value of love in the family and home (self love)...that child then understands the value of loving self and others.    It starts in the "home" within.  The self within is that "home".  Child not raised in emotionally healthy home?  That core of Knowingness is still within all beings.  It's understood.  With focus, children as that grow to love self . . .and love others.  Care...focus...free will.    We are part of same Light.  We are all one.  To dishonor any aspect of that Light (self, neighbors, the One Light (God), is dishonoring self, others, the One Light (God).    "Man did not weave the web of life, he is merely a strand in it.  What he does to the web, he does to himself." ~Chief Seattle ~   . . . (Valuing self and others.  Love our neighbors as our ourselves.) . . .  .|`|OUbNSXjJaa	By adding 'self', it is not going to change the question.|`|AA12391873	The self is a convenience of language. Jesus was pointing to the the oneness of all being.  He was teaching the recognition of the One consciousness within all that is. God, self or other all are expressions of the One that we are.    Love is not directed out to specific others. It is not a commodity to be portioned out or sold for well wishes and beautiful sentiments. Jesus knew this. Love is our natural state of being. By directing awareness towards the love that we are Jesus was pointing us towards awakening.|`|jpTl3o5naa	Yourself. Jesus says to love one another just as I have loved you. I think it goes without saying that in order to love, you must love yourself as well. To not love yourself and being created in the image of the Lord, would be self defeating and not in alignment with the Holy Trinity. The love is not of outer beauty or material possessions, but the love that shines forth as being one of God's own and live as He would have us live. They can't be seperated.  If you have no love of oneself, how can you even begin to love others? Love is universal, kind , peaceful and  forgiving.|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	Self is you, or to to me, self is me.

vDG0iA8laa	Double standards do prevail.. It's always been pretty much acceptable that female are permitted to wear somewhat male attire, and "get away with it"..  Take for example the past term of "Tomboy" wherein a young girl could do "masculine" things, - playing ball, climbing trees, wearing slacks cropped hair, etc etc and no one really thought much about it except to say "she'll grow out of it"..  War time saw females working in ammunition plants and airplane factories and other male related functions, and they wore slacks as they were involved in some non-female tasks, and could have skirts / dresses getting in the way - not only from a sexual aspect, but safety facroes as well. So it was very acceptable for them to dress in the manner they did.  The world never did, and never will accept males dressing "en femme".. They will constantly be made "sport" of, ridiculed, scorned, and on and on..  They say it's not the thing to do as males SHOULD dress like males..  To which I say, "pony pucks"...   I am a long time married transvestite, love it to the nines, regardless of how people feel and think...  My wife is fully accepting, understanding, helpful, and basically got me started, and has done all the pics on my website, so I'm not going around pussy footing about this lifestyle unbeknownst to her.  And this is why women do have more acceptable "things" going for them, but by the same token they are also "abused" in some respect - salary discrepancy versus males, in many cases sexual abused, beaten, taken advantage of, and all by GUESS WHO...?  I love being what I am, and emulate females as best I can.. I do own a very extensive wardrobe including 42 pair of HIGH HEELS, so I am you mite say "quite versed" within the lifestyle..

DmuB8vf1aa	not gay but i can tell you it's because they have no straight guy friends and only hang out with girls. i listen to the tom leykis show, he's a man who knows everything men need to know about getting laid with chicks and the gays who call in with the lispy voices all claim to only hang out with girls. psychologically, you reinforce behavior by nature of your environment i've learned in cognitive psychology. there is a gentleman by the name of bf skinner who experimented with parakeets. basically he proved that the parakeets will respond to the mechanisms that produce rewards. as in the case with gay men who only hang out with girls, this can explain his reinforcement theory as the reward for gay men is social acceptance and girly behavior is rewarded with this.|`|WDbE5gffaa	I'm glad you've recognised not all gay guys do!<br>  There are lots of gay guys out there you'd never guess are gay, cause they don't fit the stereotype, like not having the voice.<br>  There are straight guys who have girly voices. A voice is something you can't really change. <br>  Also, i suppose gay guys feel they should carry themselves well if they want to look attractive. No guy likes a slob :/|`|SkLeo8C3aa	They have a lot of femininity in there genes would be one guess. Another would be that they spend a lot of time with girls.|`|N73oZyY8aa	It's just who they are, that's all.|`|4GyEpzpBaa	No one knows but de-masculinising to function as female is naturally to admit feminine traits and characterisation. Maybe its to enable gays to recognise each other just as opposite genger find it easier to recognise a suitable mate.<br>  <br>  Many Gays wish to become more feminine or even to switch completely.<br>  <br>  I have to admit I am not Gay but I am sure both sexes have a deep down desire to experience the full range of sexuality. Even those of us not gay may exhibit opposite gender characteristics without knowing it.|`|XuhQS9wsaa	I'm gay and I have always been pretty masculine and into sports and what not. But once I came out I noticed myself becoming more feminine acting.  I think it is just a natural thing that gay guys do to separate themselves from straight guys so that other people will know that they are gay. Its literally impossible to tell otherwise, right? And then I guess we all just fall into habit. But also, there are gay guys that tend to be more girly just because they always kinda wanted to be girls... and so I guess it is out of envy and jealousy that they talk and walk that way.|`|e28a64e47925b1138ef0125d3fe2ec66aa	The answers provided up to this point assume that the cause is, in some way or another, nature. On the particular questions of "gay lisps", etc., I believe the cause is more on the "nurture" side of the "nature/nurture" divide.<br>  <br>  My educated guess is that a fair bit of it is culturally and geogaphically bound, in the same way as any other accent or dialectic, along with other behavioral norms.|`|xKoNt1h5aa	Ive always noticed this thing about gay guys lol but enever actually questioed it lol hmmm<br>  <br>  yeh its true, I can know if a guy uis gay just by listening to their voice and looking at their walk.... they are so distuinguishable isnt it?<br>  <br>  i dunno the answer to this, maybe they have flexible body|`|4mZd0Abnaa	I think it's something that's there, and you can't change. I wish my voice were deeper, but what can I do? Choke up a fake deep voice and hear it crack? Lol. <br>  <br>  For the walk, it's just something that happens. No one plans on walking a way, except for the few that do. It's something that we do without looking at ourself do it.|`|eKeWnkguaa	some gays are like that because they just like to be femmine it is called camp lol. i dont realy like camp guys so no offence to ppl who are and others guys just act normal becuase that is who they are. most people when they become gay they start getting more camp|`|9Ur1VL9Paa	Because some gay men are more in touch with their feminine side<br>  <br>  The same way some gay woman are more in touch with their masculine side.|`|KYhuDbFjaa	well umm.....I am not actually to be considered what you call gay but i am bisexual but i do have ppl say tht i walk like a woman at times but idk|`|1hS27eJuaa	it's just there personality, I know several guys who are super straight, yet if you met them you would swear there gay.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	Well I wouldn't say they are "abnormal" on par with your use of the word "normal". I would say there are gay guys who act average (verses saying "straight" or "normal") and gay guys who act feminine. I honestly don't know why they act like that or if they do it on purpose or not. Guys who act like that remind me of drama an vally girls, an I don't personally find that attractive...
pbsrCPRAaa	lol you're right there wouldn't be anything|`|6093550b9308429b874e5a267fb27439aa	If there were no God, there would be no anything.|`|AA10852244	No, this will make everyone atheist|`|2Xh1ywWRaa	excellent|`|xfmMeJx0aa	I prefer "If there were no men then there wouldn't be a need to imagine a God".|`|HJ9eOk37aa	Not entirely true though.

Even if your deity had never "existed", countless others would have taken its place.    The quoted individual is rather silly in ignoring other religions.|`|QMbaeva9aa	Well, obviously. That's a general truth. It's like saying "If we didn't exist then we wouldn't know we didn't exist."|`|b2bMy1EAaa	That should say "If there was no IDEA of God, there would be no Atheists".    If the idea was never created for any god, atheists wouldn't exist as we would just be deemed to be everyday humans. Everybody would be an atheist so there would be no need for the name.|`|YIatciCBaa	No, I don't. It's actually a piss poor quote.|`|sSjdtI7Eaa	if there were no believers there would be no god|`|RCn1Y3Ogaa	Actually, if there were no God, EVERYONE would be an Atheist.    See the logic in MY side here?    -  Kilo: actually, there will still be a term. We will be Atheist, even though we have no need for the term to call ourselves.|`|11b70cab8a6a69fef89e99846ac0cc19aa	Meaningless. No one can prove if there is really a God or not. It all goes down to faith and reasoning, but on a strictly scientific level, it can't be ascertained.    So the quote is quite dumb, to be honest.|`|X548yCR6aa	If everyone were atheists, there would be no gods.|`|c813ebd7befa92a754c60338a09d92cfaa	yes good quote indeed, very true.  GBU|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Instead of atheists you would call them believers in scientific fact (as opposed to the superstitionists). Which is a mouthful but the same thing in practise.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	Its not a logical premise to suppose this means a god actually exists. To be correct it should read if there were no concept of god then there would be no atheists. Just because some people believe in something doesn't make it true. It only proves some people believe the thing.|`|AA11992885	nope, it should read...."If God CARED, there would be no atheists"|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	That makes no sense :P
AA12022384	Edge Witch is right the only time was a peck on the cheek after his investiture.    The British, especially the older generation were bought up very much with the "stiff upper lip" idea where showing affection in public was definitely not done.  Often not done in private either.    Many of us older Brits were shown very little affection in the way of kisses and cuddles from our parents. Although we knew our parents loved us it was not something expressed often in this way.    Princess Diana was the first royal to break with this tradition and openly showed her love and affection for her boys in public. She was often shown hugging and kissing them  Though she never did so with her husband, who again is very much from the old school where public shows of affection would be looked on as "bad form"|`|T0xLpygfaa	no they are incapable of showing emotion, it's bred out of them.    but they are pretty good at hating.|`|loM8cdAVaa	No she believes that private emotions should not be display in public|`|NYU37jfGaa	They don't go in for displays of affection in public.  Maybe in private.  But we have no way of knowing. Making a parade of private feelings in public is not a notable feature of the older generation of the royal family.|`|uzVaMiMUaa	I believe the 1st time she did so was at his investiture as Prince of Wales. If a remember correctly she kissed him on the cheek.|`|1LUhUdhHaa	Not in public.|`|006ed0be5fe4d5038edb0687a8ef5597aa	If she did, the media would analyze the way she did it, if it was sincere, ect...I don't blame her for keeping her feelings at home.

gPvOcB6oaa	No MP is permitted to take there seat in the House of Commons until he/she swears an oath of allegiance to  HM Queen and her heirs and successors, you may be thinking of the Scottish Parliament, MSP,s  prefer to swear allegiance to the electorate rather than the Queen|`|H7L66ynJaa	No they all have to swear alligience to the Queen|`|ToztjpAsaa	Republic, the organisation that campaigns for an elected head of state, has been running a campaign called "Challenge the oath" which seeks to challenge the requirement for Republicans to have to swear an unjust and discriminatory oath of allegiance to the monarch.    The site lists those members of society who have to swear such an oath (including MPs), and suggests an alternative oath that might be used to replace the current one.|`|Hi1xY7sGaa	No, they still have to swear allegiance to the Queen because she is the Head of State and it is the Queen's Parliament. Not sure if any changes have been made in way of the Queen.xxx|`|9XAqnmOQaa	This from a country without a written constitution.|`|qCdRgRweaa	Unfortunately, that is not true. We are still tied to the pathetic, ridiculous notion that a monarchy is good for us.|`|2GyBTCfpaa	Do u mean swearing to queen? like saying fuc||`|APtZhqAGaa	No it is not true and it is time it was changed to allegiance to the people and the country! Possibly that way the MP's would think twice before being dishonest!|`|83637fe27d3c76bc131c9bc1b0b42c64aa	Tony Blair changed the rules so that Sinn Fein MPs who do not swear the oath could still get offices and expense accounts even though they never sit in the chamber. There have been no other recent changes.|`|155e47baf8efe28f58e95f4efe9cf546aa	No she is head of state so they have to swear a oath of allegiance it would not surprise me if Chairman Brown would prefer if they swear an oath to him after all he is going to save the world.
uSkNn9YFaa	yes... earth's lifespan probably would be 50 million years till the sun become red giant then become blackhole so within those times... expect another man that will introduce himself as another prophet and his words will be added to the bible which will be the 3rd testament|`|7a1853a34fef93b27c82b0bacf06c7c6aa	yes, the mormons tried it.|`|G9VBTg47aa	Can I write it? It would be fun...|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	Jim the baptist is right - Revelation ends with a warning not to add on to the words of the Bible.  It's complete as it is.|`|v1dnnMQuaa	Newer? Newest?     No, it's not possible, unless I am called to write one, but if I am, you're probably not going to like it.|`|qnt1wAfiaa	Yes, and no.    If there is a 'third Testament'  it will mean that the religion has changed yet again, and it probably wouldn't be the Christian religion.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	oh the begining of the new is like a mini testement|`|PjwWWMu4aa	I think, though I'm not sure, that there's some kind of caveat in the Revelation that says, "that's it, there's no more to come after this".    However, there is a book that markets itself as the third testament, of a sort. Its called the Koran. Which also says at the end, "That's it, there's no more to follow".    Either that or there's the Mormon bible, of course... I wonder if that would be the fourth testament?|`|oSME7B23aa	Why not? People have been adding to and taking away from the bible willy-nilly for centuries.|`|KT7cllsLaa	I think, Scientology and ID attempt just that|`|iX0CoNkXaa	Revelation ends with a sinless eternity, Gods plan of redemption.     If you know the Bible you will see there is no need for a third testament.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Yes, that is what happened when Mohamed founded Islam, the Muslim religion.  They still respect the New and Old Testaments as the words of older prophets. But the Koran is like the third and final testament.    So the idea of a third testament is not new.    I think some of the little religions also have a third, like the Druze, which is an off-shoot of Christianity.    And, of course, the Catholics treat alot of their later Church books almost like a Third Testament.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Nope. The bible is complete. No need to add anymore that what is already there. As Jesus says on the Cross, it is finished!|`|rUjQM1biaa	There are many book that were not put in the bible That could be a third testament     http://www.pohick.org/sts/extra.html|`|gqhoCu3faa	For The most important facts of your question, please visit the web side http://www.mormon.org   &  THE GOOD SECRET EVIDENCE  There have to be a purpose for life otherwise we will miss the peaceful path of happiness to choose truly what is right & wrong. In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.    Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings & conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?  Did you make this promise; I will never going to settle less than I can be?  Do you have the must realistic measurable rules, goals & best clear image of what you really want in all aspects of your life?  Do you live your life as a mission for your vision purpose?  Breaking down your vision into mini-goals & give must time for them regularly  Write it down the answers to be more real  Try to know all the basics to manage your life & Ask: Is it enjoyable? Rather than believing the progress is hard  Be aware of your believe which is holding you back to take actions   The Power is focus; choose wisely  http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=O061waey5g...

One source that cannot be argued with unless the person is bias in their thinking is "The Complete Works of Josephus". Josephus was a Jewish historian of the first century AD that mentions the miracles and fact that there were many followers of his doctrine at the time he was crucified. Factor in the burial ossuaries of the first century AD that were recently unearthed during a parking lot renovation near the Mt. of Olives in Jerusalem that were marked with Christian symbols. But believing that someone existed is different than having a personal relationship with them. I believe that George Washington existed but I did not know him personally. A belief is something that people hold to, faith is the knowledge that he is real. But if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost.|`|c6b79e08ad6e9a1ede6f3d56766f9ec4aa	I have never questioned the existence of Jesus Christ.

CORRECT!  christians.  ( so u see why it doesnt help that much)|`|AA11178704	No.  All the extra-biblical references (Josephus and later) came too late to have been recording anything but hearsay.  The blurb about Jesus in Josephus' writings is even admitted to be a forgery by many Christian scholars.  But even if it is genuine, it merely demonstrates that Josephus was familiar with Christianity.  It does not demonstrate that his knowledge was more than just urban legend.    The NT itself is also nothing but an elaborate system of hearsay, with many of the books being penned possibly 120 years after the purported facts, and a minimum of about 40 years.    Paul's writings are the earliest, and he seems to know almost nothing at all about the man Jesus.  If you read the Christian writings in chronological order (to include those outside the Bible), you can see the myth unfolding.  Jesus starts off mystical and is gradually transformed into a real human being over the decades, with details about his life being tacked on as they go.      For real history, details appear in earlier writings and get lost over time, not the other way around.|`|4466a7aa2f561ef70afbad1a0ef806dcaa	There is no doubt that a man who called himself "Jesus the Christ" lived on earth and was crucified on a cross.

Ahora si le incomoda tanto tener relaciones con mujeres mejor debera de no tenerlas.    Analiza tu relacin y piensa si en verdad vale la pena y ests dispuesta a vivir tu relacin en la oscuridad.    Creo que a tu novia le hace falta algo de valor...|`|AA10533958	Por lo visto ella es bisexual. Mira, si estas dispuesta a vivir una relacin a escondidas, buena suerte!     Que caso tiene vivir as si no vas a poder disfrutar abiertamente de la belleza de tener una pareja? Y es todava peor si vas a vivir con la zozobra de que podra enga?arte con un chico!    No vale la pena. Por lo visto ella no valora tus sentimientos.   Yo estuve en una relacin similar, por eso me atrevo a pedirte que abras los ojos y tomes una decisin lo antes posible, antes de que pase mas tiempo y sea mas difcil una separacin. Hablen, traten de llegar a un acuerdo donde ambas se beneficien, si no es posible tal acuerdo, pues la decisin es obvia, aunque tal vez dolorosa.    SUERTE!|`|4aaf86b9cc1b46833fe0db9612abf458aa	Pues valla que es un a dificil situacion, pues en realidad no sabes a ciencia cierta q es lo q pasa con ella, para mi forma de ver las cosas, si ella no esta totalmente fuera del closet, es por q no ha decidido lo que quiere en realidad, y no te da tu lugar pues si tu ya tienes asumida tu homosexualidad no es muy comodo tener que fingir ante los demas algo q no eres, piensa que es lo que quieres para tu vida, si realmente estas dispuesta a vivir de la apariencia o si lo que quieres es en realidad vivir plenamente tu vida lesbica, ahora bien, si a ella tambien le gustan los chicos y sabes que ha sido infiel antes... pues siento que no es una persoona muy confieble, en fin chica, piensa que es lo que quieres para ti y decide pues solo tu puedes hacerlo  suerte|`|f96457bc5afd63f2c79d6b0db4d4e600aa	no se|`|595d3b4c1fac65c691f8b57a441814f0aa	pues que tu chava no sabe ni lo que quiere todavia, si te quiere no tiene quer hacer esos panchos de que le de pena que los miren en la calle juntas, pues se supone que para eso son pareja que no? mejor cortala y buscate otras...|`|b306ee869bdb974a3f1e4d7dd813abe3aa	bueno, entre ms miedo y ms lejano sea salir del closet, ms problemas le causar, no tiene que salir y gritarlo pero pues ya viste que resulta una limitante, y para el tiempo que llevan juntas, es demasiado tarde para evitar el shock que les dara a los padres cuando se den cuenta si es que realmente no lo saben|`|a3413532a8f9532175e56766635ea741aa	opino q vos y ella son due?as de su vida y los dems q se pierdan la lengua en el cuyanito (como dira mi suegra) mientras no molesten a los dems, les deseo a las 2 q sean felices y no s si les gustan las perdices, ?ustedes 2 se llevan bien? bueno, entonces lo dems q se los lleve put..... vivan su vida como mejor les plazca, no discrimino.|`|227ac8c6431ccde9d352f9fac4bfa558aa	En el trabajo ya se enteraron, y ahora quiere ocultar o desimular? esa parte no la entend muy bien.

Si su familia sabe, no entiendo porque no lo dice!  Me parece que no es muy madura su posicion ante esta relacin.  Creo que deben platicar mucho y tu decirle  que esto as no te hace sentir bien.  Yo me pregunto cuanto tiempo ms podrn seguir as?  Supongo que viven con muchas presiones. No son libres....  Si se quieren, por favor dialoguen, lleguen a acuerdos.|`|8fb45f32f7a8cfdf40b8fb628967cfe9aa	No se si te vaya a doler lo que te voy a decir, he leido varios comentarios, y veo que dicen que ella debera de decirle a los paps...sinceramente yo creo que no les va a decir nada. Por lo que dices se nota que los paps son muy conservadores...que ella ya tiene unas ciertas ideas preestablecidas en la cabeza. Me imagino que hasta cierto punto te debe de decir cosas hirientes...debes de tener claro que cuando te dice cosas hirientes es por la misma razn. Qu haces pdele mucho a Dios, no te sueltes de l...piensa que ella necesita mucho Amor de Dios tambin...trata tu de no caer en depresiones. Acurdate que por ms que intentemos salvar a alguien, aun por encima de nosotros, no podemos hacerlo solos porque el Unico y Verdadero es Dios quien puede salvar verdaderamente.    Trata de acudir con ayuda psicolgica o/y espiritual. Personas que te puedan orientar y ayudar a sobrellevar este proceso o este paso.

Asi que tu sabes si sigues con esa relacion, si vas a seguir con ella y seguir ocultandole a sus papas la verdad pues tu tambien se como ella, es decir vistete femeninamente y arreglate, y cuando los hombre te lancen piropos fijate que cara pone, a lo mejor y le es indiferente y eso es prueba mas que suficiente de que TU NO LE INTERESAS.

Eso de ocultar las cosas indica que en algn punto le da vergenza.    Supongo que hay dos opciones:  O tratar de que se acepte a s misma sin resquemores como lesbiana o bisexual, o terminar la relacin porque es feo ser ocultado.    La sabidura popular dice que hablando se entiende la gente. Quizs lo mejor sera hablar el tema todas las veces que haga falta para llegar a una solucin satisfactoria para amabas.|`|2dbd6d178f324185b39a886dfe834f75aa	soy lesbiana y te hablo por mi experiencia.

Por lo que veo no es lesbiana, es bisexual!.  Y si asi es su comportamiento no espero q contigo haga la diferencia.  Y si te amara no deberia estar con tapujos a la hora de andar contigo.

Me parece que no es una cuestion como dijeron por ahi de que no se quiere mostrar con vos o vergenza, sino que es una cuestion de miedos a enfrentarse a un situacion complicada como es el hecho de blanquear una relacion homosexual ante personas que pueden llegar a no aceptarlo (y por eso el hecho de que no quiera que la llames a su casa y todo eso). Si vos la ams y ella te ama te diria que intentes seguir con esta relacion, no la obligues a blanquear su situacion ahora, sino que lo haga cuando ella este segura de que es lo que quiere y se sienta preparada para afrontar las consecuencias , tenes que tener en cuenta de que si lo hace y no esta segura y la respuesta de sus padres o amigos no es la mejor eso puede afectar terriblemente a la pareja (no todos los casos son iguales, hay algunos que lo toman bien y te brindan apoyo, pero otros te cierran las puertas completamente, te dan vuelta la cara y desapareces para siempre de sus vidas). Con respecto a lo que decis de que le gustan los chicos: yo soy lesbiana, siento cosas por mujeres, pero he estado con tipos y no siento nada (no me refiero al sexo), si ella esta con vos es porque siente cosas por vos, sino estaria con un tipo... Me parece que por ahi lo que tenes que hacer es intentar hablar con ella, decirle que es lo que te pasa, que es lo que sentis, que es lo que esperas de la relacion, pero sin presionarla con respecto a lo de salir del closet, eso es algo que requiere demasiada seguridad por parte de la persona que sale.|`|358695b5f4ef54316906168a11b9c189aa	hola! yo tb estoy en una sit similar... mi novia tiene 24 y yo 27; trabajamos juntas; cada una lo blanque con alguien de la familia y el resto se lo imagina... mi pensamiento es este: nosotras estamos muy bien, nos llevamos de maravillas, nos divertimos mucho y nos amamos ms... ?el resto? qu me importa!!! si nosotras no vamos por la vida opinando sobre la sexualidad de cada uno, por qu deberia influirnos lo que alguien piense de nosotras.... disfruten y sean felices!!!|`|c34115524a5a35beb1316ef17d7e78f5aa	Yo creo que tendras que dejarla, no es para vos. al menos no es su momento.

d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	Yes and no.  During the time of the First and Second Temples, the kohanim (direct male descendent of Aaron) were the priests, and the Levites were charged with attending to them.  Today, people who are descendents of those groups have last names like Levi, Cohen, Kahn, Levine, and so on.  They do have particular functions within traditionally observant communities; see below.  However, they are *not* priests in the Christian sense of the word at all.  Today, there is no high priest, nor are there lower priests.  That disappeared with the destruction of the Second Temple.|`|Bi1W5U35aa	When the Lord Restored his Jewish church with Apostles and Prophets to Joseph Smith, He also restored the Priesthoods, both Melchizedek and Aaronic.

While the Temple has not yet been rebuilt, they have few functions, the main one of which is to convey the three-fold blessing to the people.

And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,   not a result of works, so that no one may boast.     You cannot win favor with God by works, thus showing that God does not have favorites.  God offers the free gift of His grace to all.

AA12166394	From my understanding the bible says that your life is not your own, and so by taking your life it is murder, and the way to be forgiven is to ask for forgiveness, but you can do that if you've killed yourself. Make sense?    I am uncertain if you go to hell for killing yourself, I believe that every instance is looked at in a different light.    I know that the bible says that people who are either under the age of accountability or mentally instable are not damned, so depending on the mental state at the time, that could also have something to do with it.    It's really hard to answer though, it's something I guess you can't REALLY know until you are in His presence, because there is some gray area in matters of personal conviction.    That's my opinion anyway.|`|28027ad98c1a1c5e7056e622327609efaa	That's murder! If you are a christian that's not even an option.|`|AA11610725	Nobody knows who is saved and unsaved.

The Lord brought to mind, my cousin going to church camp.  That he had been born again.  A child of God.    The following Sunday the Pastor preached that there were 2 people before God.  The first, the Lord said "Well done my faithful servant, great is your reward.".  Etc....  The second person, The Lord said that he had fallen away, but he was still his child."  The Lord let him into the Kingdom, but couldn't give him the rewards, the Lord had purposed to give. (I sent a copy of the message to my Aunt.)    To me, this was cofirmation that what I felt in my spirit was true.  That my cousin was in heaven with the Lord.  (Just that all the lies of the devil & unforgiveness got fried & didn't go to heaven with.)  The other person who had also died that year, people were saved at her funeral.  She was a great young woman of faith.  She died because of doctor errors.  So, also my Uncles Nephew died young, and people were saved at his funeral also.  Doctors errors too.  (Chemotherapy ruined their bodies)

3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Yes I do believe we are in the end times.  However, Revelation speaks about what is know as the great tribulation, which last seven years.  We have not entered that time yet.    My personal opinion, in having studied the bible and prophecy, is that the next major event to happen will be the rapture of the church, which means born again believers in Christ will be taken out of the world, off the planet.  This allows the rise of the antichrist, which will start the clock on the seven year tribulation period.  After that, Jesus returns WITH His church.

You are not white. quit torturing yourself.    add: I swear, i am so sick of self haters...hating who they are, making it seem as if black, asian, or mexican is just not good enough- trying to tweek every bit of 'ancient' ancestry to feel like you are something else than what you are---looking like one race and claiming another.Talking down on your black side, or asian side and praising your european side. Some of ya'll belong in a mental hospital.    add: my point is that you want to be considered as white, due to the way that race is classified and the division in landmass- etc...But, you dont want to mention the link Asia has to Africa, no, you dont mention that because you want to be white. But, the point is- your look will never allow a person to see you as a white person, even if, just for you, they reclassify landmass- you still will be grouped seperate from them.

YupMCYHlaa	Jesus healed lots of people in  his ministry, but every person he healed, it was by driving out demons.  He never set a broken bone and put a cast on it.  He never did surgery.  He never prescribed antibiotics.<br>  <br>  From this we (well I) gather either one of two things.  Either Jesus was only able to heal those people who were 'infected' with demons, or else people in those days thought ALL disease was caused by demons, so when they saw Jesus miraculously heal someone they figured he was just driving out a demon.<br>  <br>  Personally I believe the Bible just reflects what people knew, and how they felt about things, at the time.  Medical science has come a long way since then.  But if you believe the Bible was inspired by God, meant as a revelation to inform and instruct believers down through the ages, then you still have to admit it was written by humans, in their own language, based on what they knew at the time.  Acupuncture and chiropractic were being practiced in some parts of the world even back then, but people in the Middle East, where the Bible was being written, weren't aware of them.  That certainly doesn't make them wrong.<br>  <br>  I have never used either of them, but I have friends who swear they helped them.  If you're in pain, or sick for a long time, and doctors can't do anything for you, you are ready to try new things.  Even health insurance companies cover chiropractic and acupuncture these days, they are both becoming very well accepted.<br>  <br>  So I would say give your mom the benefit of the doubt.

I don't know that they would accept Chiropractors or accupuncture, either though.<br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses see Medical Doctors but won't get blood transfusions.<br>  <br>  I don't think the Bible really says much about seeing doctors, Luke was a physician, but it does not say anywhere that he did or did not practice medicine after the became a Christian. Most 'medicine' in Biblical times was probably done by women, midwives, etc. not actual doctors so there is probably little in the Bible about it.<br>  <br>  The Bible, I do believe says the body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, or at least I always heard that saying. But that means to take care of the body, and seeing a doctor is often a way to take care of the 'temple'. <br>  <br>  The fact that so many hospitals are associated or run by religious groups, Catholic, Jewish, various Protestant denominations, it does not seem that the Bible or religion and medicine should be opposed to each other for the most part. <br>  <br>  But it is her choice, she is not a child and can accept or not accept medical care for what ever reason, including religous ones.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	I can understand your concern but this is not a religious question at all.

If you get sick, its your own damn fault. Here are the references:<br>  <br>  If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee. -- Exodus 15:26 <br>  <br>  2.  When you are sick, rely on faith-based medicine. Prayer and faith alone will cure you.

AA11155676	Thanksgiving could be a negative experience as you suggest, but I think you are better served by taking a more positive approach:  use the day to truly appreciate all the good things in your life.

AA12270622	Why is "being evil" wrong?  Because it's ultimately detrimental to the group to which you belong.  You're forgetting that human beings are social animals, so it isn't just what each individual member of our species does that affects how our species fares as a whole.  It's how groups within our species fare that influences how we evolve.    The group which develops the most successful model will be able to propogate its membership most effectively, reduce the burdens it has to face, more effectively raise a greater number of offspring to reproduce the next generation, and so forth.    Since some organisms are going to be adapted to some tasks more than others, those groups in which members best suited to gather food not only do so, but bring the food back and share, give their group a better chance to survive, thus encouraging cooperation.  Those animals who steal from what the group has ultimately harm the good of the group as a whole, even though they benefit the individual.  So, it is in the best interest of the rest of the group to punish that individual and deter him or her from stealing again.    On the other hand, when you have competing groups, it is in the group's best interest to drive other, competing groups within its own species away, claim the best territory and access to resource, access to shelter and safety, etc.  So, in that context it is within the group's best interest to be aggressive, and cooperate with each other in a fight.    Well, that pretty much sums up human society, when you get right down to it.  The reason it looks different has to do with size and complexity.  If you run more on instinct than you do on reason, you can't really codify your behavior in a rational way; you simply do what your instinctual brain tells you that you should do.  If you only have a few members in your group, two or three dozen, then there's no need to codify what is and isn't acceptable, even if you can reason things out.  You can just wing it, wait for someone to do something, then get together as a group and go "get 'em!" if you don't like what they did.    However, if you go beyond both of those things, your group tends to start fracturing and falls into chaos as the members of your group form smaller groups (that usually go back to the "get 'em" rules... think gang rule), begin competing with each other, etc.  That destroys the larger group.    So, if you're able to think matters through, as your membership grows and you begin to see the inevitable fracturing of your group into smaller ones, you have to come up with one standard everyone uses to judge behavior, and a way to apply it so what "competition" takes place can do so in a friendly way while keeping everyone cooperating for the good of your group.    That's human society in specific.  Cliques form (gangs, bowling leagues, those creepy goth kids who hang out behind the school), social groups (churches, political parties) form within society, but they use a common standard set to the common good in order to judge behavior with.  If an individual or group within a society begins to violate the rules set for the good of the society, we have a formalized way of punishing them, and formalized members of society who do so (goes back to that, "those best at gathering food do so, then bring it back to share"... "those best at fairly judging others do so, and provide their ability to the group as a whole).    Notice, however, that by and large we only apply the set of rules (such as "do not murder") to what our membership does to our own group, and not so much to what our group does to other groups.  If we get together as a group and decide we want to take another group's resources, or we perceive another group as a threat to ours, we become aggressive, bond together, and do what's necessary to achieve the goals of our group and most effectively ensure it's survival.    We even have a word for it:  War.    If you want proof of that, check to see how often we mourn all the dead in war, as opposed to mourning only those members of our own group while dispassionately thinking people die in war, so the other side's losses were only to be expected by them, and not feeling any particular sympathy.    There's nothing either mysterious or circular about how moral and legal codes have evolved within the human race.  It can be explained in naturalistic ways, and we can find evidence of it by observing other social life forms.|`|QIQNzE11aa	Atheists tend to not be evil worshipers, nor do they tend to be evil. Just do not wish to believe in a God in any form.     So why lump them in this way?|`|JO8YzDNVaa	Evil is objective to societal norms.   Probably every "evil" thing you can think of has been an acceptable social norm in some culture group somewhere at some point in time.    Societal norms are kinda like fashion.  You think corduroy pants and bell bottoms would never come back into fashion, but there they are.|`|NlzlBV8Haa	That's a big if :)|`|AA11297267	It depends on what you mean by "evil" (the definition of which is by no means universal!).    I don't care what anybody does as long as they don't harm anyone else.  I object to harming anyone else because doing so means taking away the other person's same right to do whatever they want to be happy.  The old "my right to swing my fist ends at your nose" kind of thing.    We don't have a "purpose," by the way.  There is no purpose to life -- you're simply here because your parents had sex.  If you want to give yourself a purpose, that's fine -- but none is imposed on you, not even the "purpose" of reproducing or furthering the evolution of the species.    Morals do and have changed throughout history.  "morals" are simply the set of rules that a particular society agrees to live by, nothing more.  I personally *hope* that it never becomes "moral" to kill any human beings for any reason, weak or not.  Human beings should be able to determine their own fate, and someone else killing them takes that away.    Peace.|`|vx4QvCosaa	If one is happy with themself. Then why would they want to hurt others?.

And they abuse others just to make themself laugh, and brag to others. then it becomes personal. and that person feels they are right in what they do. because they see no wrong in it.

Evolution is a side issue and perhaps one of the means of this continuance.    Morality is a separate issue and deals with how various societies are maintained.  Morality does not strictly involve biology.  Plus morality does not need to involve religion.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	There is no "evil" in the first place.    There are logical choices and bad mistakes. That is all.    Evil is a biblical term that refers to an opinion of a God.

Also, your thing about morals is actually rather right, and changing morals is usually a good thing. Just a short fifty years ago it was moral to be racist...now, it is not in most of the U.S. As for the killing four weak humans to save three strong humans, weak and strong is a matter of perspective. The Rock might be stronger physically than Hawking's, but Hawking's is stronger mentally than the Rock. So it's all a matter of perspective.|`|97ca6663adad94c1f5fa4d010bf0ce51aa	evil is wrong more or less by definition.    its like asking why is red a color if you can not see it in the dark ?    you have to be a bit more specific, name something that is evil and then ask if this is wrong.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Humans are a social species with social rules in place to make coexistence with one another fairly harmonious and reduce conflict amongst individuals. Evil actions break that cohesion by sowing conflict and discord.    When you speak of the goal of creating a stronger race, that is eugenics not atheism. Eugenics is an ideology of creating an ideal race, like that put forward by the nationalistic Nazis.    Drugs and polygamy are also frowned upon irrespective of religion, simply because they disrupt harmony in society. Polygamy is a problem because it leaves a large number of men with no prospect of finding a partner (since polygamy is almost always a single man with multiple wives, it results in a shortage of available women).|`|KOecCLjLaa	because you aren't alone in the world|`|YfbC1m3haa	My purpose as a human is to pass on to my children the values I believe that are required for them to live peacefully on a sustainable planet.

Assuming on what you wrote, morality is just evolutionary psychology, it's what's best for us as a whole. Why do you think our population is exploding, not because our society wants death upon others. I could go on to mention: God killing the entire world in the bible, taking down cities, the crusades, and the hate that is in the world because of religion. But why would I do that, that would just bring out evil.|`|AA12181796	We might only be here because of evolution. But we're still here. We still have feelings.

9ee8dcc2934057939567eae607a331c6aa	Hi Jake,     This one is simple - I went through this turmoil myself.    Girls liked me (and I them) because we got along like 'sisters'.      Guys liked me (and I them) because we explored each deeper than just friends.    My preference (keyword here) was guys because the connection was that much more (pardon the pun) solid.  It was like an understandng which confirmed my doubts whether or not it was right.    I believe you can in fact love both, however, it has been my learning that bi-sexuality is a 'temporary' phase where one day you'll have enough of fooling yourself and just accept who you are (notice how I didn't say 'what' you are?)

Pero a mi si me gustara que se reconstruyera ya que fue el principal protagonista de la consquita.

I would not attend a church where they honor the cross. But the cross does have it's own honor I need not give anything to it. The cross didn't take His life, God did. Then, He ressurected. So, yeah - He who died on the cross is the One to Honor. It is an important symbol for some beautiful concepts that are slowing eroding away in this culture, concepts like forgiveness, mercy, grace, propitiation, atonement and the like. I think it's more what the cross represents that we focus on in music and worship. The song, the Old Rugged Cross doesn't honor the cross but it does focus on what happened there and the depth of the pain and suffering because it was no ordinary crucifiction.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	The crucifix did not take Jesus' life.  It is just an inanimate object with no will of it's own.  It was the Romans who nailed Jesus to the crucifix that took his life at the behest of the Jewish religious leaders who were tired of his rabble rousing.  <br>  <br>  Now as to why Christians use a cross as a symbol to represent their faith, it is because they believe that Jesus' sacrifice for the sins of everyone else is the most important message of the faith.  The cross is meant to symbolize that sacrifice.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|500b0fe5bfd90198931c2235e47b33efaa	It is the key to evangelisation.<br>  <br>  For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.<br>  -1 Corinthians 1:18|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	nothing TOOK His life -- He gave it willingly.

The Cross is a symbol that reminds us of the sacrafice that was made for our spiritual freedom, much like the flag reminds us of the sacrafices that were made for our natural freedom. I know this answer will not sit well with many but I cannot honor the flag unless I honor the cross, for their symbolic meaning is freedom.|`|YW9ouYhQaa	Not all of us Christans honor the cross. I am an LDS and believe it or not we are Christians, we dont honor the cross because we dont worship images, but my main reason is i like to think of my savior as the Resurected being He is now, some people honor it to remember He died for our sins, but the do nothing about it, i'd rather honor him with my actions.|`|ifj1Mgypaa	The Cross is just as much a stumbling block or folly for people today as it was 2,000 years ago. The mindset of the world wants us to preach Christ the Philosopher, Christ the Wise Man, Christ the Healer. Anything but Christ the Crucified Son of God. This is a great temptation for the Church today-to modify the message of Christ to be more appealing to modern ears, to present Christ as people want Him to be. But carrying the message of the Cross to the world is the only way to truly give them Christ. The Cross is the message of God for the world.<br>  <br>  The Cross shows us that the world is broken; the world is evil; terrible things happen in this fallen world. The fulfillment of man is not to be found in the fleeting pleasures and desires of this life. God came into the world, lived a perfect life, revealed Himself to mankind, and the result is the Cross. Of all of the things that have happened over the course of human history, the Cross points most clearly to the fallen-ness of the world.<br>  <br>  The Cross also shows us that in spite of sin and brokenness, God loves us. The love displayed on the Cross is unfathomable. The pain, the humiliation, the degradation that God allows Himself to be put through is beyond our ability to comprehend or understand. The Creator of all allows Himself to go through all of this humiliation, and ultimately to be murdered on the Cross. A God who would never naturally feel physical pain or suffering, allows Himself to suffer on the Cross, placed there by His own creation. And He does it all to show us His love-to show that no matter what we do to Him, God will offer us forgiveness, and God will love us.|`|K07MXHjRaa	jesus died on the cross for our sins. its our symbol of what happened to jesus in order for us to be able to go to him and ask for forgiveness and he will put in word for god to make a place for us. instead of having to sacrifice for every sin we commit. it its just a symbol of or faith and religion.and even though crucifiction took his life it was for us and i am very greatful to him for that.|`|N4Ct35GFaa	I'm no expert but I'm pretty sure they are honoring the sacrifice, not the cross itself.

10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	You are correct in your interpretation and your friend is mistaken.    "I am crazy about kids" is:"Je raffole des enfants" in French.  "Lunatique" as a noun, or as a "familiarly used adjective" defines a person who has changeable moods and displays erratic or unpredictable behaviour.    The source is myself since I am a native French person and a professor in Linguistics, but since you request authentication, please look at the official French dictionary definition below:  http://www.le-dictionnaire.com/definitio...    "Crazy" does not necessarily mean "demented " or "mad" and has numerous meanings, some of which are actually positive. It also has the same shade of meaning in English as "lunatique" has in French. See 10 and 11 in these English dictionary  definitions:   http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/c...  Some people just assume that it only has one meaning and that it is automatically bad.  The origin of  lunatique/lunatic comes from "luna"( the moon) in Latin, and refers to the continuously changing phases of the moon which were blamed for people's erratic behaviour.|`|f9cfa1f729b01fa77295b7bdb5bcab17aa	whimsical children|`|HA3wlq2Taa	mad kids it is!!|`|qVcQA4aTaa	You are right - crazy kids!|`|PpvgDNZ4aa	Hi  It means crazy kids sorry   hope that helps =D xxx|`|fQd2DAyGaa	From my understanding of French so far, I think you might be right as "enfants" is children, and "lunatiques" is lunatics, so it translates into, as you said, crazy kids. =]|`|dbCCpr58aa	children lunatics.

6aIuZZi7aa	Most Satanists consider ritual magic to be a form of psychodrama, in which one's suppressed desires, emotions, etc. are appropriately released during ritual. Therefore, most Satanists represent Satan, Lucifer, Belial, and Leviathan as specific archetypes, elements and directions during ritual. Satan represents the adversary, fire, south -- Lucifer represents the enlightenment, air, east -- Belial represents the independent, earth, north -- Leviathan represents the serpent, water, west. However, each can be represented as an impersonal entity during ritual if a Satanist chooses, as Anton LaVey wrote in The Satanic Rituals, "the magician should treat the entities he calls upon as friends and companions, for even an impersonal device will respond better to a conscientious and respectful user."|`|v80N4JB0aa	Not really.  In the ritual chamber some Satanists may suspend disbelief and believe for the moment that satan is real if it helps with the emotions,  satanic rituals are all about the emotions and whatever imagery helps with that is valid.

It's simply a neurological reaction to the pain and endorphin rush.<br>  <br>  However, I find it advantageous to react AS THOUGH it were a real experience, because the conversations Fenris and I have often reflect deep personal truths I had not seen or had been trying to avoid, in a way where I cannot avoid them.

In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.    Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings & conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?  Did you make this promise; I will never going to settle less than I can be?  Do you have the must realistic measurable rules, goals & best clear image of what you really want in all aspects of your life?  Do you live your life as a mission for your vision purpose?  Breaking down your vision into mini-goals & give must time for them regularly  Write it down the answers to be more real  Try to know all the basics to manage your life & Ask: Is it enjoyable?

I think if I were you I would explain to your parents why you are not getting married and although you are gay you will never commit any gay acts   That means to fulfil your life you need to find other outlets that will make you happy . The first is obviously finding a career in which you can succeed and the second would be social life including sports .  Many people never marry for various reasons and some guys go through life without having sex   Of course we could suggest getting married having a couple of children , but your views that this would be living a lie say to me that you are a genuine and nice guy   I can't answer for what your parents will think when you tell them , but from all you say you are finding it difficult not being open   Take each decision one at a time and tackle each object gradually . Please do not consider suicide as the world needs decent guys like you appear to be .

All i can say is that its your choice now. I am atheist cause i dont believe human should be born to torture themself of thing like this.    So you have to choose...you can have the best of both option:be gay and please God the way its written in Quran    Try to find some muslim support group.....and listen to your therapist.

Sometimes, the "intrepretation" of holy scriptures leaves a lot to be desired.  I have a problem with most religions; not spirituality, but fundamentalism.  It's true that you sound like a sincere and honest person.  Why would God punish you this way?  There is not a reason.  I firmly believe that we, as Gay people, are made the way we are to help shine a light into an otherwise dark place.       Not everything is so neat and tidy as to say:"this is naram and this is not".  I believe that each person holds the key to their future in their own hearts and I do not believe that it goes against God's will for people to love each other, no matter what the sex.      If you believe that God made us, why would you think he put you here?  I do believe that you are a very serious and gifted young man.  I also believe that there is love possible for everyone on earth.  It's up to us to sseek it out.  Please do not commit suicide!  This is the worst possible thing for you. I would recommend becomming a pen-pal to someone who is gay and can talk with you on-line to give you encouragement and platonic affection.  You need this from someone.   As for telling your parents about your sexuality, I would refrain from it, unless you have no choice.  Peace and love be there for you,  Bret|`|MSASVtyXaa	If you are unable to give up Islam, then I'm sorry life will be very tough for you. It's your choice brother. Imo, don't tell your parents though, just think how bad it will affect them. Keep it to yourself. You are right, you shouldn't marry. Being celibate isn't that bad. And if you think you can handle it, then it's your call.    But I'd still suggest you try to look at life beyond religion. Whatever you do, hope you find inner peace.    Take care.

Let's go with Britain (because I live there) and the US together- most of us who post here are from these countries- along with a fair few Australians and Canadians.<br>  <br>  12-20 probably quite a high percentage- about 70%<br>  21-35 about the same<br>  36-60 50% tops<br>  over 60- haha, probably not many- I would say about 10% and that's allowing for those who have had operations on their abdomen where the doctors have to shave off some of your pubes.<br>  <br>  I'm 21, my pubes are kept short and I take the hair away from the bikini line and a little further in. I look really young so it's best to leave a little hair there to make sure people know I'm an adult :P|`|cd9ccdfe958b07ea5c171be4be17c922aa	I'm 18 male and I shave down there.

This creates habit, and social standards<br>  <br>  As people get older, they havn't had the influence of easy access porn to set moral standards, but some probably still did it. I also find it mroe comfortable to shave them, it keeps me tidy down there, makes odor less powerful, easier to clean, and comfort (ever get your pubs caught in the fibers of your clothes or zipper etc.) But the worst is when it first starts growing back, you need to shave it again or risk painful chaffing.|`|MsdDPUKmaa	12-20 = 90%?<br>  21-35= 55%?<br>  36-60= 15%?<br>  Over60=5%<br>   <br>  I think as we get older, we start to care less about being shaved or unshaved, and that's why I put the percentages going down.

dlV6OoaLaa	I am a wife of a freemason, and I may have been against it at first, as it was taking him away from spending time with me,and I didn't know alot about it at first, but it should not change him in a sense that he is different.My parents were highly against freemasons my whole life, but are completely fine being that my husband is a  Master Mason. Freemasonry is to make good men better and enhance their morals etc. If this is a religious thing, there are many freemasons we are christians as well as ministers that are still going to church. Freemasonry is not to replace his current religious beliefs, just maybe enhance them. I would suggest talking to your husband and getting some more information, as he is able to tell you some stuff. You could also ask him to arrange a meeting with the Worshipful Master of his lodge to get some information, you could probably even see the lodge?  Some added information - It sounds like you are just where I was a couple years ago. I agree the "ladies nights" are not the greatest but I go so that I can be a part of his Lodge experiences. And my husband is also a member of the Scottish Rite.From my understanding you would not want to go to a meeting, depending on the lodge they can be pretty boring, talking about lodge events etc. I feel that since he joined it has greatly improved our marriage. I am sure there are other things in your husbands daily life that you don't know about, like who he talks to and what they talk about - things at his job etc., you need to just give it some time ( that is how I got through it) and make sure to ask him questions that you have - he may or may not answer, but it may help you just to talk about it? Maybe you should consider the both of you going to a counselor. Maybe reading the book "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Freemasonry" will give you some basic information on the fraternity to see what they are really about. Good luck.|`|UQTAN7cgaa	It sounds as if you haven't discussed freemasonry with your husband or the lodge he joined. You should mention these concerns to him and he should be willing to talk with you.    Freemasonry does NOT use secrecy, nor does it put barriers between a husband and wife. If you are experiencing this then you definately need to talk to him (you can also email me what Lodge he belongs to, because there are "bogus" Lodges out there that are not associated with Freemasonry)....    In every Degree we are instructed that in Freemasonry there is nothing that will conflict with out duty to our God, family, country,  career, neighbor or ourselves. That is the order of responsibility we are taught, God first, family second, etc... freemasonry is way at the bottom of that list after everything else has been taken care of.     Why were you against his joining freemasonry? it is a good group that studies morality, attempts to make good men better (note, it cannot make a bad man good), and provides more charity than any other group on the planet.    please let me know if you have further questions.|`|7gHnVJpyaa	Are the freemasons getting in the way of your marriage, imposing rules or anything like that? If so, then that is a worry, and I don't think every chapter of the freemasons would do that (without knowing much about them, and If I did, I suppose I'd have to keep it secret...)  You could perhaps suggest that he joins a different chapter. If he will not compromise, and do his part to rescue your relationship, then you should tell him that either he leaves them, or he can use his secret handshake to keep himself company at night.  Without knowing your situation, the simple reality is that you shouldn't spend your life with someone that won't make you happy, or who would prioritise a secret club over his own wife.|`|Q7ovix19aa	Join the Eastern Star.|`|bVJDV6QPaa	There are no barriers, just the ones you make up. You know you could try to be meek: enduring injury with patience and without resentment.  It means you have to endure and do not make the mistake of thinking this does not require a change in how you think and perceive of your present circumstances.  It is a marriage, you should be doing everything you can to support your husband.  I mean, he is not cheating and he is still a good man. Right?    I understand you feel there is a rift but when we do something that another person feels goes against the grain, we must not feed the anger and resentment.  It is okay to be disappointed in your husband but it is not okay throw all the resentment and anger you feel towards Freemasons at him.  That is a little unfair.  One thing that is helpful, may be to spend a vacation day.  Do not even think about Freemasons. Let your family know that you are doing this so they know not to bring up any thing that will trigger your resentment.  Let the day be about things you and your husband do together.  Take in a movie or see a show.  Go for a long walk together,  because ultimately no one can help you understand your husband if you do not first reach out to him in a more loving and accepting way.  Hate and understanding never made great companions.  The other thing you can do is make use of your time in better ways, more constructive ways.  Make a decision that your time is more important than to spend it one more day angry with the man you know you love.  Remember people will always disappoint us but God's love is unfailing. It comforts us, it holds us, it nurtures us, it is more than enough to satisfy us even when we think are hearts are breaking beyond repair.  My wish for you is that even if you do not believe in God, that you mend, that you visualize yourself as healed and whole again and that the healing you see, the person you see does not come from what your husband does but it comes from you wanting it beyond the breach.  What happens now is up to you?  Use this time to rethink, regroup, and to show mercy to the one you love.  I know he will be kicking himself if he loses a terrific and beautiful person such as you.  Take care and remember, this too shall pass.|`|F7YzHVyUaa	How did I get so lucky?  My girl actually encouraged me to become a Mason.  She has no jealousy, she's not overbearing, she's not insecure, she understands that boys need some "guy time" away from her.  All of these qualities that my girl has, I believe the question asker lacks.    I don't think this is about freemasonry, it's about your insecurities, because if it weren't, you would know that freemasonry encourages a man to make himself better in every aspect including a better husband, father, and citizen.  Give the guy some space.  At least you know he's not cheating on you, there are only dudes at the lodge.  It could be worse, he could be at the strip joint.|`|pNxuvKUOaa	Please give it some time.  It sounds as if your objection is not to Freemasonry, but to your husband being out without you.  I am not married myself, but I think a good marriage should be flexible enough that the two of you do not have to do everything as a couple. Do you have similarly strong feelings about other differences of opinion, such as politics?    Talk to the wives and friends of other Masons in your husband's lodge.|`|fuujE5Peaa	Your husband is trying to become a better person, husband and (if he is one) father.  Sometimes, this takes involvement with other like-minded and moral men.  I think you'll find that your husband will be encouraged by the other members of his lodge to be a better husband and father.  Masonry teaches us to set our priorities and encourages us to be the best husbands and fathers we can.    If he continues into the Shrine, you'll find that there are many, many things you can do together and attend together and there is at least one unit (the Hillbilly Clan) that both men and women can join once he is a Shriner.  The only thing you will not be able to actively join in are business meetings, degree work and dinners, like you said.  This, being about 3-5 hours a month, is pretty minimal compared to all the things you could join him with.  However, there is also (if they have one in your area) the Eastern Star.  Both Masons and their wives and daughters can also both participate in all aspects of Eastern Star...check it out.

Here is the Facts God the Father is a personage of Flesh and Bone. Jesus Christ is also a personage of flesh and bones. the Holy Ghost also a member of the Godhead is a personage of spirit. As we all were before we came here. Christ was not stupid He would not pray to himself. If you read in Genesis We were made in there image not one person image. This is a truth that was lost from the earth and restored when Joseph Smith had his vision God the Father introduced his son as He always does. www.mormon.org|`|lJUyhMceaa	There are two major views on the trinity.  The first view is that God has manifested Himself to us in three ways, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  All three are the same God, yet manifested in three ways.<br>  <br>  I could use myself for an example.  My wife looks to me as "her Husband".  My children look to me as "their Father", and the youth at my church look to me as "their Pastor".  I am manifested to each group as a different person, yet I am only one person.<br>  <br>  Another way of looking at the Trinity is that their are three distinct persons, who, together make up one God.  <br>  <br>  An example of this would be the head of a large corporation.  There are three people who together share the power of CEO.  Each have their own personal function, and, when working together, make one decision together.<br>  <br>  There are some Scriptures that a person could use to support both viewpoints, but I believe the context of the whole Bible support the first view.....one God, who has revealed Himself to us in three ways...As our Father,  As the Son, and As the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  Consider the following verse from the Old Testament:<br>  <br>  Mal 3:1  Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts. <br>  <br>  Jehovah God (Father) is speaking and He is saying that He will send John the Baptist to prepare the way "BEFORE ME".  God the Father is saying that HE is coming.  And then He goes on to say that the "Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come".  God the Father is saying that He is coming and that He is the promised Messiah.<br>  <br>  Consider this Verse from the New Testament...<br>  <br>  1Ti 3:16  And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory. <br>  <br>  In this verse we are told that God was manifest in the flesh.

Es respetable que cada quien piense lo que se le antoje, al fin y al cabo nacimos con libertad.  Lo que se me hace injusto es afirmar tanjantemente ideas anticlericales o anticatlicas sin verdad examinar la situacin.  Me supongo que todos los que han afirmado que la Iglesia esta en contra de los homosexuales, o que la iglesia ha creado guerras o que se yo tantas cosas ms (como el afirmar que los legionarios de Cristo los creo un depravado sexual) es por que tiene pruebas contundentes, es por que se a puesto a investigar detalladamente y que sin temor a equivocarse y con las evidencias claras y contundentes habla.    En cuanto a que dicen que creen en Dios pero no en la Iglesia, entonces quieren decir que creen en un Ser Supremo, pero no creen en la humanidad, ya que la Iglesia la forman los seres humanos, ya que si existe dios, quiere decir que alguien nos creo por lo tanto todos somos creacin de un solo Ser Supremo, por lo tanto creyentes o no creyentes formamos parte de un solo Ser.  Entonces al formar parte de un solo Ser Supremo, eso quiere decir que somos imagen y semejanza de l, es decir, formamos parte del mismo, por lo tanto si crees en Dios como un Ser Supremo que te creo, pues como consecuencia debes creer en la Iglesia ya que forma parte de ese Ser.

40dbbfa18d3405078eb8bceef0913a9aaa	You will find throughout mythology (especially in Native American spirituality) that the believe in more than one god is very misleading. In fact, most of these groups believe that there is one main Creator deity -- who is both male and female and encompasses all things and characteristics. However, Pagan religions split the Creator into a male and female deity (the God and Goddess) because they feel they are able to identify with God/dess on a more personal level this way. I am Pagan and I believe in one God, but when I do ritual I invite the God and Goddes for balance and because I can relate to God/dess more personally by relating to them as separate genders with different characteristics.    However, there are pagan religions that do believe in many Gods, they are usually those that focus on a specific mythology, such as Asatru, which is Norse, and Hellinism, which is Greek.    I am an Eclectic Pagan Witch. I would love to chat with you if you want someone to discuss your spiritual path with.

I now do not categorize myself into any religion.  I believe that many of the major religions of today all have something to offer.  They all teach peace and understanding and acceptance..and I think that is something that many people are missing.  It doesn't matter if one person believes there are 50 Gods and another believes there is 1 God....if each person feels spiritually fulfilled personally and are kind and accepting to others, then really who are they harming?  God, the Gods....gave us a cognitive mind for a reason.... He/She/It does not want us to be brainwashed and just accept things without thinking about it...what a waste that would be....almost an insult to His/Hers/its magnificent creation... the mind.    Anyway...I am happy to see that you found what works for you.  Oh, and if you want a cool book to read....it is philosophical but lots to do with religion and acceptance...read Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder.

It's a result of your consciousness shifting from your physical body to your etheric body - which doesn't need glasses.  It's known as etheric sight.  What you see at this point is the contents of the etheric plane that coincide with your bedroom, which won't necessarily be fully identical to your bedroom.  This divergence increases once you go fully out of body (as the etheric plane is just your starting point), so proof is usually awkward - over the years I've gathered enough to convince myself, but convincing third parties is an awful lot harder...  The last validation I saw was a tree (previously unchanged since my childhood) unexpectedly pruned back incredibly vigorously and stripped of all its bark.  Unbeknownst to me at the time, this had happened to it in real life just a single day earlier.  The tree was half an hour's drive away from my bed.
lMmhkeZ0aa	There is no history indicating the efficacy of prayer.  An example.  In WW2 there were thousands and thousands of people praying for peace.  We got peace just about the time the enemy ran out of bullets.  For thousands of years, the Jews have been praying, yet for thousands of years, they remained enslaved to some other society.<br>  <br>  We have a very sophisticated view of prayer these days.  If I pray for something and I receive it, god loves me.  If I pray for something and do not receive it, it isn't good for me and god loves me.  If I pray for something and receive it, but it turns out not to be good for me, then god had a lesson for me to learn and he loves me.  We tend to give god a lot of slack, so these days, prayer always works.  Try this for a month with your cat.  You'll find it works.  He'll love you.<br>  <br>  I'm always amazed at how someone can believe in an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent god yet there seems to be things god needs to be told.  If this is the case, then god is either not omniscient as he is withholding or he is not omnipresent as he was unaware of a particular need.  And what about omnipotent?  If god is all powerful, then there would be no power left over for anything else, yet god is doing battle against the power of satan.  Evidently, he is not doing a very good job because there is still lack an man's inhumanity to man in the world.|`|53508c26f5cd4045c5bf39c8169c3ffcaa	2 Peter 3:9<br>  The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness.

INJSpV4haa	Coolness - I'd go for it with a g/f.<br>  <br>  It's called pegging and lots of people do it. Maybe it's a fetish if it is an absolute obssession with you, otherwise it's just adventurous and a little kinky. I wouldn't worry about whether it is "normal" or not -- what defines "normal" anyway? By the way, guys like it because it strokes the prostate gland, your friend probably meant G spot.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it!!!
SaQ5d420aa	Perfectly normal. <br>   All men have a "sweet spot" located between  the pubic bone and in front of the rectum wall.  It has to be reached in the anal cavity.  Not only is that gland -prostate - able to heighten the orgasmic reaction, it is also able to send great feelings though out the body by just being massage.<br>  Many men also enjoy having the gluts massaged as well as the anal lips.  <br>  It takes a man who is really secure in his sexual identity (in this case straight)  to ask his girlfriend to help him fully enjoy himself. You should feel trusted and loved to have this knowledge of his likes. <br>  Too many people in this country have a long list of what is wrong with sex and very short list of what is correct about sex.   As long as both of you enjoy each others company enough to get naked and bear the truth, then you have a good relationship.  <br>  Enjoy the benefits of fully trusting and loving each other.

As a teenager I had very low esteem and confident, but after years I am now confident enough to be a community leader. I made myself a leader, nobody else, just me. I think other leaders are the same - their life could have hindered their chances, but then they overcame them.<br>  <br>  I also believe that everyone has the ability to lead.
42DjF8Ckaa	I also felt the same way for a long time in my life. I would be angry all the time at loved ones for no reason at all and new things would irritate me and old things will make me feel hopeless. I got over it and finally started being happy again when I started to look into the Spiritual side of life. A trouble or problem comes along in life when something in self needs to be changed or there is some better way of living that one is expected to achieve. This situation that you are facing right now seems like a very big trouble to me so I think you finally have reached that point when you need to change and have a better life. My trouble that I faced me gave me more understanding of life, calm, peace, meaningfulness. I would suggest you start meditating, here is the link : http://www.edgarcayce.org/Meditation/wel...  I do the same meditation and it has helped me in such ways that words that I cannot explain.    I also suggest you try buying and reading these books:  Star Signs by Linda Goodman  Discovering Your Soul's Purpose by Mark Thurston  Manifest Your Desires by Esther and Jerry Hicks  The Life Everlasting by Marie Correlli  The Secret by Rhonda Byrne    The Secret is really in spotlight right now but the other books are also the same helpful. Any book from that list can get you right back on track and make you happy again. You can choose to trust me because I have been through the same thing and these were the medicines that healed me.    I hope you find what you are looking for soon. Try to see why you are having these depressing feelings. Try to listen to your situation and I am sure it will tell you something.    Peace and Love|`|M1E7rN6Qaa	I agree with "The Ranger" and also with "Stop Dialoging".  It generally happens during teenage bcoz of pubic hormones.

You have not changed, only your thoughts are changed. Change your thoughts, think of yourself as a person who helps others. Start helping others, talk with everyone, and start being with others.    Don't escape from problems, if they come just face them.    I know spirituality is Good, and my temperament is also spiritual, but you should not be alone all the time, that would make you distant from people, being always alone you cannot work in a group, and we need to work in a group to get work done, even a small work or great work needs help of others.

9Wi2eNInaa	Because Einstein was a true scientist and knew science can only discover what is already here and analyze that.     You can as a scientist make theories of relativity and big bang theories of origin of the universe, but ultimately your only finding out what was already here.    Every scientist in the back of their head always says about origins "I see how this might of been made, but where did hydrogen come from?, where did any element come from? Where did an atom get it's structure? How does life know how to take lifeless inorganic materials and organic materials and put a life force into those previously "dead" materials during cell division? How does DNA know what to do?    I mean there are so many questions that science can't possibly answer ,especially on origins of anything and where those materials came from, that it is actually kind of ignorant to take the stance of atheism.    I myself being a scientist, am more of an agnostic, because I know there is a lot of strange stuff out there, but I also believe the religious guys don't have any more of an idea about origins or what God is or isn't then anybody else. How could they know anything? To me preachers that tell you what God said are the biggest liars of all, because they don't question the source of the material and just say that is the way it is. God gave us intelligence and it is the purpose of us to use our God given logic to question and analyze what we are told. That is what a scientist does- --they question , analyze and verify or dismiss|`|lVSDB0Hwaa	Because he felt like it?

He often used "god" as a socially acceptable term for what most of us would call "nature."  He didn't believe in any kind of personal god, in the bible, in any religion, or in anything supernatural.  He generally preferred the term "agnostic" and gave good reasons for it:    "You may call me an agnostic, but I do not share the crusading spirit of the professional atheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from the fetters of religious indoctrination received in youth. I prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being. "    If you insist on going beyond that, you would have had to have asked him -- I can't answer for him beyond the clues in his writings.    Why does it matter, anyway?

One problem with atheism is that to say that there 'is absolutely no God' which stakes the claim that the atheist is omniscient (meaning: all-knowing).  Where there are NO humans that can claim that.  Not even any organized religion can claim omniscience because that is why it is 'faith based'.  Einstein could have came to that realization and moved on to a possible 'something' out there, but could not (nor would not) claim an absolute.  There is so much more detail that could go into this explanation, but I'm hoping you can get the gist of where I'm going with this.  I hope this answers your question :)|`|AA11932246	The difference between a pantheist and an atheist is that a pantheist calls the universe "god" while an atheist just calls the universe, "the universe".    As for cosmotheism, what you are probably referring to (there are a few different things going by that name) is not something that Albert Einstein (an ethnic Jew) would have wanted to be associated with (considering that it originated from a neo-Nazi), not to mention that it wasn't created until long after relativity came about.

Did you know that Bongernet has:    "Remember, "god" is nothing more than a nonsense word created by   man to explain away all of the things we can't yet understand. Religion is a disease of the mind, born of fear, which has done nothing but bring untold misery down upon the human race."    written on his yahoo answers profile.    It seems to me that Bongernet thought that this would be a great time to impose his philosophies on you.  How very clever.  I checked Matt Butler's myspace page and no such question was asked of him. Unless he is Matt Butler (AceBlade), himself, he could not have gotten such a quick response.    If he really wanted your opinion Bongernet (or whatever your real name is), I'm sure he would have asked.

vDIBCj1vaa	Hebrews 12:3-17    CONCENTRATE ON VERSE 6    Do Not Grow Weary  3 Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted.     4 In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.     5 And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons?    My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,  nor be weary when reproved by him.    6 For the Lord disciplines the one he loves,  and chastises every son whom he receives.    7 It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?     8 If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.     9 Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live?     10 For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness.     11 For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.    12 Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees,     13 and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed.     14 Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.     15 See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God; that no root of bitterness springs up and causes trouble, and by it many become defiled;     16 that no one is sexually immoral or unholy like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.     17 For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no chance to repent, though he sought it with tears.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	2 Kings 5:1-19 The Healing of Naaman the Leper   I'll give you the whole story and at the end a line I suggest that epitomizes his attitude   =======================  Elisha Heals Naaman   1Naaman was the commander of the Syrian army. The LORD had helped him and his troops defeat their enemies, so the king of Syria respected Naaman very much. Naaman was a brave soldier, but he had leprosy. [a] 2One day while the Syrian troops were raiding Israel, they captured a girl, and she became a servant of Naaman's wife. 3Some time later the girl said, "If your husband Naaman would go to the prophet in Samaria, he would be cured of his leprosy."       4When Naaman told the king what the girl had said, 5the king replied, "Go ahead! I will give you a letter to take to the king of Israel."        Naaman left and took along seven hundred fifty pounds of silver, one hundred fifty pounds of gold, and ten new outfits. 6He also carried the letter to the king of Israel. It said, "I am sending my servant Naaman to you. Would you cure him of his leprosy?"         7When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes in fear and shouted, "That Syrian king believes I can cure this man of leprosy! Does he think I'm God with power over life and death? He must be trying to pick a fight with me."         8As soon as Elisha the prophet [b] heard what had happened, he sent the Israelite king this message: "Why are you so afraid? Send the man to me, so that he will know there is a prophet in Israel." 9Naaman left with his horses and chariots and stopped at the door of Elisha's house. 10Elisha sent someone outside to say to him, "Go wash seven times in the Jordan River. Then you'll be completely cured."         11But Naaman stormed off, grumbling, "Why couldn't he come out and talk to me? I thought for sure he would stand in front of me and pray to the LORD his God, then wave his hand over my skin and cure me. 12What about the Abana River [c] or the Pharpar River? Those rivers in Damascus are just as good as any river in Israel. I could have washed in them and been cured." 13His servants went over to him and said, "Sir, if the prophet had told you to do something difficult, you would have done it. So why don't you do what he said? Go wash and be cured."         14Naaman walked down to the Jordan; he waded out into the water and stooped down in it seven times, just as Elisha had told him. Right away, he was cured, and his skin became as smooth as a child's.  =============================  I suggest two possibilities     1)  Sir, if the prophet had told you to do something difficult, you would have done it. So why don't you do what he said?     2) I thought for sure he would stand in front of me and pray to the LORD his God, then wave his hand over my skin and cure me|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Well...I'd point him to the story of Noah.

The first story that came to me and could be engraved easily on a dogtag is the story of the prodigal son.    You could just engrave prodigal son on the tag andhe would be able to read it and remember the story.    The story of King David and no matter how much he loved the Lord, and he did love the lord with all his heart, he still screwed up repeatedly and needed to learn the very hard way.  To the point of losing his new born son to death as part of the fall out for his adulterous relationship with bathsheba and the murder of her husband to cover up the adulty and resulting pregnancy.    There are so very many more, including Paul and how he had to be blinded in order to "SEE" the light of truth.    EDIT: Esther honey, its Jonah that you are speaking of and yes, that is a very good one also.  Not only did Jonah run the opposite way at first, after he finally did God's biding, he got mad that the people repented and he couldnt watch them get destroyed from his hilltop vantage point and started to pout about how he knew he shouldnt have had to come to those people anyway.|`|b0AvMRqbaa	KARMA    not a religious word, not a principle I believe in.

2wUvFmrhaa	The LDS church aka Mormonism.  As a former member, I was not old very much at all before baptism, and very little after that. Mormon youth and new converts are kept in the dark. The history is sugarcoated and much vital information in never taught.     Mormon Leaders and Or THE Mormon Church Teaches that:           1. Our God is an exalted man of flesh and bone.    "Christ was begotten of God. He was NOT born without the aid of man and that man was God!" (Doctrines of Salvation, Vol. 1:18)      * He physically lives with His many wives near the star Kolob     Quotes....      "If none but gods will be permitted to multiply immortal children, it follows that each God must have one or more wives. God, the Father of our spirits, became the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ according to the flesh." (Orson Pratt, The Seer, page 158)  AND  Joseph was Her Second Husband        * Inasmuch as God was the first husband to her, it may be that He only gave her to be the wife of Joseph while in the mortal state, and that He intended after the resurrection to again take her as one of his own wives to raise up immortal spirits in eternity. (Orson Pratt, The Seer, page 158)      * The man Joseph, the husband of Mary, did not, that we know of, have more than one wife, but Mary the wife of Joseph had another husband. (Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, 11:268)    2. Worthy Mormon men can also become Gods, like Him  3.Our God is one of many Gods and serves a God of His own!  4. God came down to earth in the flesh and was the physical father of Jesus      * You should not trust the Bible in this matter. It is wrong. It has been translated wrong.    Joseph Fielding Smith, 10th Prophet of the Mormon Church: "They tell us the Book of Mormon states that Jesus was begotten of the Holy Ghost. I challenge that statement. The Book of Mormon teaches No Such Thing! Neither does the Bible!" (Doctrines of Salvation, Vol. 1:18)      5. Trust their prophets.        6. Read what the Mormon leaders say about our Savior and the Virgin Mary.      Polygamy, polyandrous marriages, Bigamy, Blood atonement, Adam is God, Racism,  ETC...See,     Real mormon history HERE..http://www.realmormonhistory.com/    The ONLY MEN WHO BECOME GODS, even the Sons of God, are those WHO ENTER INTO POLYGAMY.(Journal of Discourses, Vol. 11, page 269)    When I found out this information and teachings, I was Done.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	ALL Cults!!

As in, paying you to do a job?  Can we trust you with our kids as in schools or day care?  Each day we must judge people.    It is especially true about whom we claim to represent in worship.  If we claim to worship the God of the Bible, do we show by our dress and actions and behavior that we are good representatives of that God?    If we claim one way yet behave differently, how can anything we say be trusted?  How can anyone believe your word?    On the other hand, must all people love you?

Please call them and invite them over.|`|tC1hF1y5aa	That's a good idea, but they might also recommend that you take a Gospel Essentials class to learn about it, too.  This class teaches all the fundamentals of the gospel, and the missionaries usually attend if they have a recent convert or somebody they're teaching.  You might also want to visit LDS.org, and search by topic for answers to specific questions you have.  You can't go wrong if you go to the source, pray about it, and follow your instincts.

ntdhO8wsaa	Christ?  Which messiah are you talking about?    Christ means messiah and nothing more.|`|I2I843Myaa	Yes, because He is my Savior.|`|ncXMA6rsaa	I think it's possible a man named Jesus existed back then. I don't believe in any of the miracles, god, virgin birth, anything like that. Just a man named Jesus.|`|NCRfZRopaa	No as one, I'm Jewish, and two, I'm also an atheist.|`|VR9Yjvt8aa	Do I believe Jesus Christ is the savior of humanity, having died for me on the cross and risen to heaven? No, absolutely not.    Do I believe that a man named Jesus of Nazareth was later referred to as Jesus the Anointed one? No, absolutely not.    The life and exploits of one Iesu Nazarene are mythology, cooked up by Paul (nee Saul of Tarsus) for the purpose of developing a new faith system for the impoverished and underprivileged masses of the Roman Empire. Whatever good his intentions may have sought to bring about, he failed.|`|FmazIF6Maa	No.    The Bible is too inconsistant and has too many mistakes to consider evidence. There's no evidence any of the books that they did include in it were written in Jesus' time.    There is no evidence-- no physical evidence, no writings by Jesus' contemporaries, no Roman records, not even writings by Jews (who would write about people claiming to be the messiah)-- nothing to prove Jesus' existance. If he did exist, he wasn't as important in his own time and there's no way to know who he actually was.    The earliest writings we can confirm about Jesus were not written until more than 35 years after his alleged death, and were tertiary accounts at best (the writer heard of a guy who heard of someone named Jesus who did (fill in the myth)). Josephus' work is believed to be tampered with later. Tacitus' work didn't come till 70 years after Jesus' alleged death.    Jesus, based on the stories we have about them if you do want to believe them, did not meet the requirements to be the Jewish messiah. He did not rebuild the temple physically, he did not gather all the Jews in Israel, there has not been peace since then. Even the concept of God being incarnated into flesh or the scriptures being changed or added to are fundamentally against Judaism.|`|0yTM98Odaa	Yes, why? Because he is our Savior and God|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	Yup. because He lives!|`|idRvGHOEaa	I believe in Christ because He died for everyone's sins so we wouldn't have to die a second death.|`|c3zUqmdXaa	DO WANT TO TAKE NOTE? SO HERE WE GO...    I BELIEVE IN JESUS BECAUSE HE IS GOD...     Proof 1  Jesus said He is eternal  And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. (Rv 1?17-18) Much clear, isn`t it? Jesus is the firs (none nor the Father ) is before him; and is the last; none is after him. It gets clearer when we read declaration of the Father: Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last. (Is 48:12) So, who is the first and the last? Jesus or the Father? Jesus and the Father are only one first and last because they are only one divinity: For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. (1o Jo 5:7)    Proof 2  Jesus is all-knowing  And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the minds and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works. (Rv 2:23) Lets interrogate then: Who is able to search the minds and hearts unless someone who is all-knowing? Other thing: Jesus said: Im he which (SINGULAR). It means theres only one who is able to search the minds and hearts, and who is he unless God?    Proof 3  Jesus is omnipresent  For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. (Mt 18:20) Can it be clearer? God is omnipresent (Psalm 139). Jesus is omnipresent (Mt 18:20). So, Jesus is God (Tt 2:13).     Proof 4  Jesus is all-mighty  And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth; (Rv 3:7). Who is able to be mightier than that? He opens and NOBODY shuts and He shuts and NOBODY opens. To complement this argument check Mt 28:18: And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. (Mt 28:18)     Proof 5  Jesus forgive sins  When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. (Mc 2:5)  In that moment Jesus was accused of saying blasphemy because he was forgiving the man. Then Jesus corrected them saying that he could forgive the man of his sins (verse 10). Interesting detail: Who was accusing Jesus was the Pharisees, but they accused him on their minds. But Jesus did not correct the Pharisees in one thing: ONLY GOD is able to forgive sin: (verse 7) and Micah 7:18: Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage?    Proof 6  Jesus and the Father are one  I and my Father are one. (Jo 10:30) About that verse some people argument: One in purpose. But if we read from the verse 27, it gets clear that Jesus wasnt meaning one in purpose. Jesus said that none is able to take his sheeps away from his hand and that none is able to take them away from the hand of the Father; then He said: I and I the Father are one. Of course he wasnt meaning one in purpose but that he and the Father are one (IN AUTHORITY; IN MIGHT). We can confirm that in the verses 33 UNTIL the verse 36.    Proof 7 Jesus is YHWH (Jehovah)  He said: "Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am." John 13:9    YHWH means "I am what I am". It's the title or "name" of God, the Father. Check Exodus 3:14 where the Father introduces himself as "I am what I am". So, when Jesus says "I am" he means "I'm YHWH". But it means he is also "I am what I am" with the Father and the Holy Spirit, not that he is literally the Father, okay?. See also ... "Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am." (John 8:58).

And on what level?|`|AA12341690	I haven't seen any concrete evidence that he does. No records from his lifetime mention him, and the Romans kept meticulous records about their crucifixions.     I don't rule out that he might have existed, but I also haven't seen any evidence that he did.|`|SygvUa0Eaa	Well, there WAS a Jesus Christ, obviously. However, I don't believe he was the Son-of-God. In my opinion, he was a very intelligent, cunning human-being.

Obviously, Christianity is a result of cultural diffusion.|`|AA10802033	I dont. I believe that he was a real person, and that he did good things for humanity, but i dont believe that he is the Lord. i dont believe that any human can be the ultimate power over the world.

I believe that Jesus is God, in the same way that I believe you are God; in the same way that I am God.     Got it?|`|UVa9cRISaa	To everyone saying Christ means "messiah"...    "Christ" simply means "cross." Back in the day, there were no last names.    Messiah means "anointed one."    And, no, I don't believe he is the messiah.     I govern my thoughts by the laws of logic, and according to logic, you cannot validly prove Jesus (or anyone for that matter) as a messiah.

AA12187900	Isaiah, chapters 15,16 apparently around the time of King Ahaz' death and while Assyria dominated in the eighth century B.C.E., referred to one Moabite city after another as being in line for calamity. There is evidence that Moab did come under the Assyrian yoke. There is also archaeological evidence that many places in Moab were depopulated about the eighth century B.C.E.|`|AA11110297	the prophet describes the woful lamentations heard through the country of Moab, when it became a prey to the Assyrian army. The country should be plundered. And famine is usually the sad effect of war.

While we warn our enemies to escape from ruin, let us pray for them, that they may seek and find forgiveness of their sins.

e60ed1802006f020f1f9d435be819df7aa	People, you are missing the point here. Rock 'n' Roll is about one thing. Crack and whores (techincally two things, I know but who's complaining). That's why they bother.      Is it just me or does byhisgrace's first song, can't remember what it was called without going back, sound a little bit like Rick Astley?    "I just wanna tell you how Im feeling  Gotta make you, understand    Never gonna give you up  Never gonna let you down  Never gonna run around and desert you  Never gonna make you cry  Never gonna say goodbye  Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you"    I'm with the South Park theory. You pick any rock song and replace the word 'Baby' with with the word 'Jesus' and it becomes a Christian rock classic.    And the people who buy it have probably had sex with their sister at some point down the line.|`|5131a0ca8e47654d632c9edceb854025aa	1They have faith so they live in hope.    2They think that they can beat the devil at his own game.    3They hope to seduce the young into joining them.    4They just lack a sense of rhythm.    5Ditto humour    6In heaven they will be the only band on the bill, so they have to keep practising.|`|7ea123abcd5379074910679ad12f4d49aa	I like a Christian rock band.

EDIT:  Yes - TFK.     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Fo...    I first heard of them at the online radio station christianrock.com. That's where they put put their demo & were signed from there to stardom. Like many bands, they are not overtly Christian anymore so you won't blow them off. That way they can get your attention & then let you know that these rockers are spreading the message of the Gospel. It even continues today (the Art of Breaking is about our relationship with Christ -  hitting bottom or realizing that you can't live without God's help).     "I'll pick you up, won't let you fall  I'll build your trust and it won't hurt at all,  Your only drug will let you down,  I'm through now, so take me and blow me away    [Chorus]  When I feel numb I'll let you know,  I won't become what I was before,  You cannot kill what's not your creation,  This is the Art of Breaking"    Reminds me of a Scripture:  "Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell." - Matt 10:28    When they sing we want the absolute, that's the absolute truth of Christ.

The methods to be successful as mentioned in the bible are as follows:  1. Love others as yourself  2. Repent  3. Believe in Jesus  4. Follow 10 commandments and others instruction from God  5.

My cousin who just passed his CCNA exam thinks he is successful too.     What are your goals ? is a question you should ask and maybe sit down on a quiet evening and write them down and then prioritize your achievement path, set your sight on it and start working to get them, once you have identified what you need to do in life, then you will be clear of where to find help and what direction to take.    This journey you will take towards achieving your goals is a difficult one so you need guidance and support this is where religion plays a vital role cause there are limitations in humans help, I have taken the time to write this but its up to you to act on it I cant help more than that right .. So the only power which can help you above anything is god am a Muslim so Allah can help anyone there is no stopping him .. Basically towards achieving your goals and maintaining a balance in your life is given by religion.    To be positive you need a lot of faith if you dont have faith you will break down into pieces you need to reassure yourself that god is there to help you in every good step you take and yes he will, So basic ingredient to be positive is faith ironically the first step in Islam also faith !|`|bf46bce66a7c425add448485a4bc1d84aa	One of the best steps you can take is to develop an open and inquisitive mind, especially a mind that is not influenced by predetermined ideas until you can (in an adult world) verify the factual basis of any idea. Religion is one of most destructive influences on Earth.    My studies and research shows that religious people are not exactly rocket scientists, they tend to be below average intelligence, and also have a tendency to be more violent than non-believers. In some cases, the more violent the person, the more religious they are. I suspect that the vast majority of religious people are well below average intelligence.     I wonder if trying to improve the intellectual standard of our global community, would help remove the various religions from our culture, and thereby improve happiness and peace for humanity.    Its a statistical fact that the higher your education, income, and intelligence, the more likely you are not to believe in a god. For every college student that converts to a religious belief system, 17 college students convert to atheist beliefs.     Atheists have an average intelligence of 25 IQ points above their Christian counterparts. Ever wondered why the USA (75% Christian) is so arrogant, aggressive or violent towards others in this world?|`|d8530e798fb043e36f4872c4f333ee00aa	By leaving the world a better place than what is was like when they got here.

Se trata de una copa propiamente dicha, a la   que se le ha a?adido una estructura de oro con dos asas que los une. El   conjunto mide 17 centmetros de altura. La copa es de forma semiesfrica,   con un dimetro de 9 centmetros y constituida por gata, de color rojo   obscuro, cuyo estudio arqueolgico muestra que fue labrada en su taller de   Palestina o Egipto entre el siglo IV a.c. y el primero de nuestra era.     En los albores del cristianismo   Este vaso de suma trascendencia no pudo ser olvidado tras la muerte del   Redentor, tanto ms cuanto los discpulos se reunieron varias veces en el   Cenculo. As se explica el que el Santo Cliz apareciese en Roma, llevado   segn la tradicin desde Jerusaln por san Pedro. Transcurrieron, pues, dos   siglos y medio en los que existen claros indicios de que el cliz fue   utilizado por los pontfices para celebrar la Eucarista. Segn ha indicado   Antu?ano, ?lo que ms impresiona al investigador es que el canon litrgico   romano de los primeros Papas, en el momento de la consagracin, deca   textualmente: "tomando este glorioso cliz", refirindose a "este" solamente?.     La historia del Cliz cuenta que, en la persecucin del emperador Valeriano   antes de morir, el Papa Sixto II entreg las reliquias, las alhajas y el   dinero a su dicono Lorenzo, natural de Huesca (Espa?a), quien tambin fue   martirizado, no sin que antes enviara a la ciudad natal el Cliz de la   Eucarista acompa?ado de una carta suya. Ocurra todo ello el a?o 258 o,   segn algunos autores, el 261.     La copa permaneci en Huesca hasta la invasin musulmana. El obispo de la   ciudad, Audeberto abandon con el Santo Caliz su tierra en el 713 para   refugiarse en la cueva del monte Pano donde viva el ermita?o Juan de   Atars; lugar en el que posteriormente se fund y se desarroll el   monasterio de San Juan de la Pe?a; del que surgi un ncleo de hombres   esforzados que acometieron la reconquista contra los mahometanos. Tuvo esta   lucha caracteres picos, que no dejaron de ser aprovechados por la creacin   literaria, ya que, segn historiadores de la literatura, constituyen el   origen o la fuente de poemas tan clebres como los de Cristin de Troyes o   Wolfram de Eschenbach, con su hroe Parceval o Parzival, que es   posteriormente al Parsifal de Ricardo Wagner. En todos estos poemas hay un   Vaso maravilloso, al que se denomina ?Graal? o ?Grial? y cuya relacin con   el Santo Cliz es fcil comprender.     La presencia del Santo Caliz en San Juan de la Pe?a est testificada por un   documento del 14 de diciembre de 1134. El 26 de septiembre de 1399 el Cliz   pas a ser custodiado en Zaragoza, a peticin del rey de Aragn, don Martn   el Humano. En el texto de entrega, que se conserva en Barcelona, se hace   constar que el Santo Cliz fue remitido desde Roma con una carta de San   Lorenzo. Durante el reinado de don Alfonso el Magnnimo la reliquia fue   trasladada a Valencia. Desde el 18 de marzo de 1437 se conserva en la   catedral de esa ciudad, segn un documento en el que se refiere al ?Cliz   en que Jesucristo consagr la sangre el jueves de la Cena?.     La historia ms dramtica y sublime de la humanidad   ?El Santo Cliz no se conoce suficientemente ni dentro ni fuera de Espa?a?,   asegura Antu?ano, mexicano residente en Espa?a,  que considera que ?su   valor no est en un rigor cientfico plenamente demostrado, por ms que la   arqueologa misma no tenga nada que objetar contra su autenticidad, sino   por el simbolismo que tiene con la Cena del Se?or: vale porque es signo y   figura de la institucin de la Eucarista y esto es mucho ms grande que   cualquier vestigio histrico?. Segn Antu?ano, ?cuando se desvela el   misterio del Grial, uno se da cuenta de que no tiene nada de enigma   esotrico, aunque lo que encierra es la historia ms dramtica, romntica y   sublime que la humanidad ha vivido: la historia del Verbo hecho Hombre y   Eucarista?.|`|abfc0cbd9085359bed1269a256972544aa	a todos les preocupa donde qued el grial .. y a nadie le preocupa donde qued la sagrada KK ?|`|33b1a6e2c05c88ebe7cda420c1644592aa	Segn la leyenda, el Santo Grial, era el cliz, copa o vaso que us Jos de Arimatea para recoger la sangre de Jesucristo en la Cruz.

4cfa2f8d5b2034431cf172500c7e4bf2aa	Faith, for me, is believing something that my Reason tells me is correct.  Faith without Reason is weak.  Each person has the responsibility to reason through their beliefs as best they can, with what brain power God has given them.    Reason doesn't mean that you have complete proof, only that you take what you have and think logically with it.  Some information may be to high for us to understand completely, but we can use Reason in order to figure out whether or not to trust the source of that information.|`|c814d92b315d2f982e1078a83d40b8d2aa	Faith is supposed to be knowledgeable.

There will be some things though about our creator that are beyond our understanding and we must take it on faith alone.  But it is because of what we KNOW about God's character that makes it possible to take these things on faith alone.|`|093b368d01bbdc03231061bf6fc4d520aa	Faith is believing in something you can't prove.

Faith stand alone because to believe and omnipresent being made the world and is invisible and had winged people help you and people parted the red sea doesn't sound believeable becuase it's not much that seperates the bible from a comic book of the x-men. Lol  it's hard to bring in reason to faith.  Because what really is too improvable to believe or what is too insignificant to believe.  So you just have to believe or our head would just explode. LOL|`|AA11898425	yes reasoning and faith are compatible.  Dont let others convince you because you cannot verbalize a rational for what you feel or what you believe that it isn't real.

Get it?|`|1afc11fb93b4efc0fa574231da275befaa	Faith is distinct from hope in that faith is typically general, rather than specific to an aspect, and in contrast to a "false hope" in a fantasy, the object of faith typically transcends what can be proven scientifically and sometimes exceeds what can be objectively defined.     Faith can mean believing unconditionally. It can be acceptance of something that one has been told by one who is considered trustworthy. Faith, by its very nature, requires belief outside of known fact. Faith is formed through instinct, intuition, meditation, communing with nature, prayer, or perceived usefulness of a belief system.      Religious belief, and membership in a faith community are important factors in the lives of many individuals. For a certain individuals, religious beliefs become compulsive, joyless behaviors. Religious faith and religious education are not generally the causes of scrupulosity. Actually, scrupulosity is a form of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.            1. Confident belief in the truth, value, or trustworthiness of a person, idea, or thing.     2. Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence. See Synonyms at belief.     I hope you learned something about faith.  It has nothing to do with reason.|`|7c266455658e58ad0a4647c365e8660eaa	Yes, you do need reasons to back up your faith or you will be like what jesus said and be lead by a blind man off the cliff.  you have to have a reason or you are blindly following something that you cannot explain.  We humans are flawed and it may seem strange to us what is perfectly clear to god.  God says that your ways are not my ways.  we have to have faith and in our faith we will find the reasons that we are searching for.|`|AA10691438	Well for faith to truly BE faith, there has to be an element of doubt. What good is faith if it's on a sure thing? Faith becomes, when you have reason to think it might not work. We don't use faith for the sun to rise every day... it just does. The sun will set tonight, is that my faith speaking? No, because it's a sure thing.     So yes, there needs to be some reason why something might not happen for the faith you exorcise to be real. It might be a small reason or a big reason but it doesn't have to be a hopeless situation... just has to be a shadow of doubt.|`|3f647176bf9e1c85857251c249f010a3aa	Well isn't it obvious, you do not believe something if you think it's false.    And besides faith is also a supernatural infused virtue, a gift from God making you capable of believing things that are supernatural and by that means unreachable for reason, but never contrary to reason.|`|2006b8954c1947b9429c00b39378e779aa	" I am The Way, The Truth, and The Life; no man can come to the Father except through me". -- Jesus Christ    " I am the resurrection and the life; he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live ; and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die". - Jesus (Jn. 11:25)

The apostle Paul has said that, once removed from this life, the church will be forever "with the Lord" (1 Thessalonians 4:17). It seems likely that we Christians of the Church Age will join the Lord Jesus in His ministry behind the scenes during the Tribulation.

087ecce1cdfbbce661780b5377ba0535aa	Your question is a very good question but I find it very hard to answer. I have personally experienced the hand of God working in my life. Miracles have happened that if I tell no one would believe.     The very recent lesson I learned is that, if a gift of love (can be material gift like striking jackpot) is given to us by God, it should not be taken lightly. That there is a reason for everything that comes into our life. Otherwise it would not have come in the first place. I recently overlooked such a gift and did not use it for the right purpose and due to that I am in financial difficulties now. In fact am unemployed.     The next time I get a gift from God, I know I am going to fully use it to the correct purpose it was given.  Now I know for a fact that God do help us when we are really in need but we have to have done everything we can possibly do to improve our condition. That means taking total responsibility about ourself and our condition in life.     This lesson helps me become more humble and understand the meaning of humility a little bit more.|`|77af20dd5cdb33c8a173cc7dc07c3fd2aa	Late last year I started to take my faith as a step by step process instead of a milestone by milestone one.

The associated trust is from Jesus, reflected by me, to Him for His glory.  My faith does not depend of how much God does for me, how well God meets my demands. how timely God meets my demands, etc.  Faith is simply a choice.  There is no need to worry once you set your mind to trust Christ.  He is in total control, whether or not I realize it.|`|AA11009744	One cannot have God for his Father, who will not have the Church for his Mother, and likewise, one cannot have the Word of God for his faith who will not have the Church for his teacher.

(Sermon by Paul Tillich).  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tillic...  http://www.religion-online.org/showchapt...    We cannot transform our lives, unless we allow them to be transformed by that stroke of grace. It happens; or it does not happen. And certainly it does not happen if we try to force it upon ourselves, just as it shall not happen so long as we think, in our self-complacency, that we have no need of it. Grace strikes us when we are in great pain and restlessness. It strikes us when we walk through the dark valley of a meaningless and empty life. It strikes us when we feel that our separation is deeper than usual, because we have violated another life, a life which we loved, or from which we were estranged. It strikes us when our disgust for our own being, our indifference, our weakness, our hostility, and our lack of direction and composure have become intolerable to us. It strikes us when, year after year, the longed-for perfection of life does not appear, when the old compulsions reign within us as they have for decades, when despair destroys all joy and courage. Sometimes at that moment a wave of light breaks into our darkness, and it is as though a voice were saying: "You are accepted. You are accepted, accepted by that which is greater than you, and the name of which you do not know. Do not ask for the name now; perhaps you will find it later. Do not try to do anything now; perhaps later you will do much. Do not seek for anything; do not perform anything; do not intend anything. Simply accept the fact that you are accepted!" If that happens to us, we experience grace After such an experience we may not be better than before, and we may not believe more than before. But everything is transformed. In that moment, grace conquers sin, and reconciliation bridges the gulf of estrangement. And nothing is demanded of this experience, no religious or moral or intellectual presupposition, nothing but acceptance.|`|ecdfa0306ec947fcbc5f28c00541bd41aa	Therefore a man should derive benefit from himself for himself, from the living for the dead, from the mortal, for the lasting and from the departer for the stayer. A man should fear God (Allah) while he is given age to live upto his death, and is allowed time to act. A man should control his self by the rein and hold it with its bridle, thus by the rein he should prevent it from disobedience towards Allah, and by the bridle he should lead it towards obedience to God (Allah).|`|AA10781920	You get one shot to make a difference.

If he is Omniscient then why is he testing us when he already knows the outcome.  If he is omnipotent then he can stop the problems.  I believe there is a God.  He works in his own ways.  I also believe that the religion is created by human beings.  All the inhibitions we see today are because at certain time our priests failed to meet some of their worldly pleasures or a personal goal and hence they came up with a big "NO! NO!" for that thing.  God doesn't mind what we eat or wear or see or do as long as we are not hurting anyone's rights.    The rights of fellow humans are more important then God's.  This is one of the basics of Islam.

One of our instincts is to be able to pick out complex and elaborate patterns in our lives. However, we're able to do this a little too well so that we sometimes find patterns where there are none leading to superstition and the root of most religious beliefs.    Many people believe that they can "feel" their deity/deities by just living, that there is some sort of pattern in the world or something similar that indicates the existance of a higher power. This is, again, our ability to make something out of seemingly nothing, sometimes even when it really *is* nothing.    This usually takes place when the variables are too many or too complex. When presented with a number sequence such as "1 3 5 7 9...", for someone with an average intelligence it would go without saying that the next number is "11". That is a small set of numbers.    Similarly, hunter-gatherers who often find themselves being ambushed by lions could figure out how to tell when there are lions nearby. But that is a small set of variables -- they only need take into account situations where lions are nearby.    More complex problems, such as "the meaning of life", "the existence of a higher power", or various numerological problems even, require us to take ALL of our experience, and all of the universe, into consideration as variables when seeking a pattern. Our brains cannot handle this, our defence is to use subconcious "shortcuts" and see patterns where there really are none.    That's not to say there are no patterns in nature that could be argued to point to the existence of some higher power (the recurrance of the Fibonacci numbers, the Golden Section, and the Golden String are the most popular), it's just that we perceive many more patterns in our lives than there really are.|`|AA10380815	Programmed?

God doesn't need to test us, cause your right, he already knows whats gonna happen, but the world and the people and satan test our belief and our faith...which is not the will of God. As far as religion, that too is man made decisions--on what they think God would approve of.

Of course one fights  to survive that is in the human mind automatically and can not be avoided, except by the very few.     Rules and laws apply to very part of our lives and always will. Religion is like a lock on a door, the lock keeps honest people honest and the others just break the lock. In that sense life is a test, but one that can be easily passed.     The sex part though has lead to countless fatherless children, single parenting, daycare, latchkey children, and other things that cause harm to the family system. Today being a single parent is all about the parent not the child. If you think that is a good thing then you have your wish already. Religion teaches that the family group as the basis of all other things and that is righteous and right. In my humble opinion.|`|j6XEAiL4aa	To answer your question, yes, it's a series of test.  God tests humans not for knowing whether we can handle or not.  God wants to know how far would we go to do what our religion wants us to do. In time, the tests will be a lot more difficult to accomplish. We will need to conquer ourselves.    Why testing then?  God gives us the advantage of being a human with our mind.  God knows we can handle any tests that are given to us.  But God wants to know if we are willing to do so.

Facebook seems like a ghetto version of facebook in my opinion.    e-mail me about facebook if you want another friend or just want some more info!|`|AA11115991	Facebook would be safer because of the networking system. Anyone can easily find you on myspace, but with Facebook you are networked to your school, not to the infinate capacity of the world. At least with Facebook, you are surrounded by those near you.|`|gWNwvYvkaa	i've never heard of facebook|`|ea479b35f910e9095503d0b3ef57df9caa	I don't know about safety, but I opted to join Myspace rather than Facebook, because it looked boring.|`|3e62h2fWaa	Well, Facebook is more private and not just anyone can see your profile but I would like to point out that on Facebook you are using your full name which isn't usually posted on Myspace and your network almost always would tell a stranger what town you live in and school you go to/company you work for.  So in that aspect, it's not safer at all.    But... there also are fewer naive eleven year olds on facebook, I don't feel like it has the amount of creepy folks that Myspace does and Facebook is almost purely used to network with people that you already know in person, whereas myspace, internet strangers are always bothering you.
AA11125228	You should remember that racism exists in ALL communities.      As a white person I'm ashamed of racism, but I've been on the receiving end of it too, from member of other races.      You are totally correct though, many many people do not think of themselves as "racist" - but demonstrate that they are in subtle ways.  I didn't realize I was being taught to be racist by my family, until I was a young adult.  The most important thing is to recognize the signs and then fight like he__ to overcome it.|`|6758c821b132686ab57ec075ec135491aa	WHY? WHY ? would you smart, decent and intelligent people, keep paying attention to that poor guy that calls himself Robert S???  He is just sad and lonely, because a beautiful successful black woman dumped him, for a hot, sexy, better looking black guy....    Plus , I don't think so I am white and I am not racist at all|`|KoHCAQifaa	That number sounds accurate; hell, if the number increased that would probably be more like it. White people are sneaky, greedy, whining people who do their share of dirt, and when they are exposed, they start crying and whining until they get their way, and that irks the hell out of me. That doesn't make me racist because I'm not discriminating against them...I give everybody a chance, but when they start that crybaby sh!t then that's when I get pissed off. If anybody thinks that's racist, then OH WELL. What are you going to do about it?    That website was accurate, and we don't need to do a big azz research project by finding all kinds of articles and pointless sh*t just to avoid the numbers... Yeah, 80% of you white people are latent racists because it's in your blood... If you don't think so, then tell me why when these white women walk 2 feet away from a group of white trashy boys, they're all fine and dandy, twisting their pancake butts, but then when they walk past a group of nice black kids, they clench their purses with all their might? Or else when a biker dude walks in a store, every thing is fine, but when a clean-cut black man walks in, white folks everywhere are ambushing him, peeking their long noses around the corners, and following his every step like he was a terrorist? Or if a gel-haired, acne-faced white boy is driving a cadillac, it's all good, but when a black guy drives one, he's selling dope? These are the countless stereotypes you people come up with...that's what makes you racist and not know it...    And Robert Shelton, you WISH your KKK, white trash, beer-bellied, inbred, snaggle-tooth, skoll-dipping azz could be 1/4 of the man discovery is because he is ALL that--unlike you and the rest of your sorry Klan members...|`|6cb5e153678d9974cb9cd79e9212d53caa	No not all white people are racist. Man when will all this black and white sh** end. It has about got on my nerves. That's is like saying all black people wear weave and are ghetto. Now all black people are not the same and neither are white people.|`|7be3f4155dcd42f2a8721e0033593ea7aa	Actually, I have noticed that black people seem to be the most outwardly racist in the US here keeping in mind that Japan is the most racist country there is..  Anyhoo.. Black people tend to be much more sensitive about race and race issues and relations than white on average. They are racist against themselves too which I find sad.    I bet you will find much different data if you look at different articles. Also, people who have the time to write articles like that tend to find the hypothesys they were looking for in the first place. You have to find who funded the research.  ;0) Don't let some research CNN does sway your opinions too much. It's hard to really believe the numbers.    We are naturally cautious against what we are not. It's very natural.  Hanging out with people our own age, social groups, sex, very normal. Where does one draw the line and call this natural caution and grouping 'racist'?   Of course we will hang out with people most like us. It would be plain old weird for me to just go up to a group of black fellows to ask them a question. As a white female, it just makes sense to go up to someone white or female to ask a question. I personally don't think any less of the people who are not like me, it's just a comfort zone thing.    Personally, I have also tended to be one of those overcompensators, if someone who is not like me asks me something, I will go out of my way to help them. Funny eh?    I am sure we have all been caught in an unpleasant -ism. I know I have. Ageism and Sexism. The world is full of that. :0(|`|AA11059890	i can see you're in dire need of special help here, the survey was done on both whites and blacks nor did they find much difference between either of them, as for the 80% that MAY not even know they have these feelings is by no means solid. hey you know what? i MAY have some swamp land in florida to sell you i don't but i MAY get the idea?|`|Dl7xtjH9aa	Well the question was are all whites. I said they were not. if 80% are then that's still not all. I'm Black I honestly wouldn't say more than 60% based on my experience but I didn't read your link so maybe 80% is more accurate. If so I would be surprised.|`|68fd562bcc726b3ad41ca79d43597ce4aa	I wouldn't say 80 percent.  I'd say 95% or more.  This applies to other races as well.  It's really hard not to be racist when socializing, learning and living in a racist society.

Pero se a donde va tu pregunta y sin ser tan exigente, puedo asegurar que son los genocidas mas grandes de la historia de la humanidad. Empezando si se quiere por las cruzadas, pasando por la poca de la conquista de Amrica [ac es donde los nmeros aumentan a cifras desconsideras (*) ] y siguiendo por los financiamientos realizados en cuanta guerra se te cruce por la cabeza.  (*) Recomiendo que leas "Las venas abiertas de Amrica Latina" de Eduardo Galeano y porque no su antitesis; el pattico (si se me permite) "Manual del perfecto idiota latinoamericano". En el primero vas a poder leer por ejemplo que cuando los africanos trados a Amrica se suicidaban, porque crean que la transmigracin de su alma los devolvera a frica, los conquistadores cortaban las cabezas de los cuerpos y les decan a los que todava no se haban suicidado que si de alguna manera volvan a nacer en frica, naceran sin cabeza o el miembro que sea.

Analizo y dedusco que: Si cualquier empresario  o persona poderosa y que tiene mucho dinero, tiene muchos emprendimientos, muchos negocios, muchas maneras de hacer crecer sus bienes materiales, y sigue creciendo economicamente, porque puede, y porque quiere, pues su condicion lo permite.   De igual manera Dios siendo creador de los cielos, y de la tierra, y todas las demas cosas creadas, visibles e invisibles.  Ademas esta cientificamente comprobado que en otros planetas hubieron o hay vestigios de elementos tales como el agua, polvo, aire, etc.  Cree solamente, no especules, Dios es tan grande, poderoso, eterno, omniciente, omnipresente, grandioso, imprecionantemente creador, y me dio vida a mi y a ti...

Por experiencia personal si tu das el ejemplo alguien te seguir, creeme, lo he comprobado en demaciadas ocasiones, en muchos pases, culturas y toda clase de discriminacin, La gente me miraba y se burlaba a mis espaldas, como diciendo que tarado, pero lentamente se daban cuenta de que sus preconceptos no tenan sentido y que solo bastaba con abrir nuestra mente para encontrar la armona, Basta dar el ejemplo, tu eres la semilla, y ellos son los frutos    Muchos creen que el racismo es parte del ser humano, es TOTALMENTE FALSO, es algo que nos ense?an desde peque?os, hasta que lo catalogamos como verdad, si no me crees, por que no vas a un jardin de ni?os de un pais no racista, veraz que a los ni?os no les importa en lo mas minimo la raza, hasta que comienzan a escuchar comentarios de racismo o preguntas como esta, que inconsientemente los programa a ser racistas incluso sin saberlo, al igual que el racismo varia de cultura en cultura, no es lo mismo el racismo en USA que en China o en Egipto|`|2e1b95c480bd72ae87f092ab127420d3aa	Excelente pregunta.    Creo (muy a mi pesar) que el racismo es inherente a la raza humana, por lo tanto dudo mucho que termine, aunque debo de reconocer que han existido esfuerzos de muchos lderes y personas comunes para tratar de erradicar este mal que aqueja a la comunidad mundial.    En la medida que las naciones poderosas sigan con sus modelos de poltica exterior e interior, este problema seguir latente, pero lo peor de todo es que an en las naciones sub-desarrolladas existe esta ignorancia hacia otras razas, preferencias sexuales y religiones. Por lo tanto ya sea, por ignorancia o poder la discriminacin seguir tal vez por el resto de nuestros das.    Las alternativas que puedo observar para ir paulatinamente acabando con esto son dos, la educacin familiar con nustros hijos y la ms importante, cambiar modelos educativos que sigan fomentando esta actividad discriminatoria.    UN SALUDO!!

POR FAVOR NO ME DIGAS QUE LA DISCRIMINACION, RACISMO Y SEXISMO NO ES INHERENTE A LA RAZA HUMANA.

whfbEPPeaa	I think your mum should be able to go to whichever home suits you both best. Location is always key with these kind of things. Make sure you visit a few and ask plenty of questions about the kind of care she will be receiving. See if you can find out if there's any reports or reviews available about your chosen homes or chat to anyone you might know who's known a friend or relative in one of the homes. Then you can make an informed decision.
zZxX5PXBaa	Unless there's more information in the essay topic as you were given it, I think you should go back to your tutor for more clarification, because 'traditional Christian marriage system' is not an expression that has any generally accepted meaning within any academic discipline that I'm aware of, and almost anything could be meant by it.    It could be that the question asks you to consider TCMS within a particular cultural context, say Western Europe or North America, or in a particular time, or within a particular denomination, and then it might have some meaning, but as it stands it's such a broad expression as to be virtually pointless. All your speculations are reasonable.    It could include the system of theology within which marriage is understood (within Catholicism it is considered a sacraments, which brings in a huge swathe of theological implications; within most of Protestantism it isn't considered a sacrament).    It could include the relationship between civil and religious marriage ideas, which is interesting because in some countries there is a close constitutional link between the civil and the religious (as for instance, traditionally in the Republic of Ireland, the link between the state and the Catholic church ... though that is of course a tradition that goes back only to the 1920s when the Republic was formed).    It could include the connection between New Testament (Christian) and Old Testament (Jewish, Christian) traditions on marriage and divorce, and the theological issues that arise from differences and continuities between the testaments.    It could include the similarties and differences between Christian and Secular notions of the marriage contract, and the marriage ceremony as variously conceived either as an occasion of contract-making, or as an occasion of (Christian or secular) celebration. It could  include an examination of different conceptions of the marriage contract, different Christian understandings of that, different secular conceptions of that, and the way that in many civil legal traditions the Christian and secular have been combined.    It could mean looking at traditional gender roles, in Christian as opposed to secular marriages, and the variation in different Christian or secular traditions ... and there are huge variations.    It could involve parenting, partner-selection, the relation between marriage and economics, the difference between the traditional extended family and the modern nuclear family.    It's so wide as to be virtually meaningless, I'm afraid. Alternatively, see it as being so wide as to give you the freedom to explore anything that interests you.

You could also include the more traditional elements from history, like the fact that once upon a time marriages were arranged by the parents of the boy and girl; or the boy wooed the girl and petitioned her father to marry her.  The girl would be a virgin until marriage, because they had no birth control, and the boy would want a guarantee that the first child she bore would be his. Since virginity was the only way to prove parentage, if she were not a virgin, then he would never know if the child was really his.    Divorce was also not traditionally possible. The man was expected to take care of his wife and children no matter what. It was a protection really for the women and children, so they would not be abandoned. In the past women couldn't work, and if they were abandoned they would be destitute.|`|T0xLpygfaa	errr.... it means the process of marriage  carried out in the tradition of  chistian ceremony.      just a stab in the dark.|`|xHfl4yzSaa	Two idiots of opposite gender agreeing to stay together no matter what?|`|45Mmu3SFaa	Whatever they want it to be ...

Think about the chances of that egg and sperm coming together to make you. You are unique, no two  people are exactly alike. I live for the world. I love earth. Earth is unique. There is no other planet like it. I live to see what becomes of people. I love studying people. Life is this big play. Everyone has a story. I love learning about them and how they handle life. I live for the birds that sings in the morning in my window. Can't you hear them? I love the smell of spring. I love the summer heat and the beach. I live to see what new technology the future will bring us. I would like to see a flying car? I live to be financially independent so that some day I can travel the world to learn about different culture and to play with the sand there.

I know for sure that I'm straight.  Having a crush on another girl is normal (I had one when I was thirteen) and it doesn't necessarily mean you're bi or lesbian.    Most girls are bisexual/bi-curious, by the way, more or less. For some reason it's a lot easier for girls to experiment with girls than for boys with boys, when they're confused.|`|bMVJkCShaa	Where do your lusts lie? What turns you on more? The thought of being with a guy or a girl? Many people go through bouts of "am I straight/bi/gay" whilst they're going through puberty; as you said, it's perfectly normal.    The only way to find out what you are is to experiment, talk to mates about it, relax into it and see what happens!

x0ipxGk6aa	I would have to say that it would really depend upon the Puertorican woman.  <br>  <br>  Then you need to wonder that even if a particular Puertorican woman did dig black men, would she be attracted to the specific black man in question.<br>  <br>  You see, when you lump a group together and treat evey Puertorican woman, or black man, the same - just because they are a Puertorican woman or a black man, that is prejudice.<br>  <br>  You have prejudged all Puertorica females and expect them to act in a certain way based on your beliefs - you've left no room for any one of those women to be different, to be who they are - and often you miss the beauty of who a person really is because you're all caught up in what you think they should be.<br>  <br>  I hope you don't take this the wrong way - we all think like this until we start to think differently.  Its just time for us to start thinking differently.<br>  <br>  I know you didn't mean this in a racist way, but I think its important to point it out because the sooner we stop supporting the infrastructures that keep racism and sexism in place the sooner they can crumble into history and be forgotten...
IRH71dwIaa	I consider myself black simply because I am of mixed descent. Technically I am mostly African American and about 1/8 Seminole Indian and a tiny part Irish.

If somebody from the hills go to some Government offices then they are considered as nothing and treat that they are some kind of servants. It is simply because their looks is Nepali and they want to hate them. <br>  So Color, Cast, religion do indeed makes a difference.|`|441002ba222c31246fd283fc8f2694bfaa	The answer will be different for anyone you ask.

0pVXLyGhaa	I would quit because you don't need that drama in your life.  Your brother has to own up to his own life and the consequences.<br>  <br>  He has been very passive and will not stand up for you or protect you.  He has chosen the woman business partner over you.  He is keeping her in his life even though she is dangerous and attacked you.  <br>  <br>  The brother should go back to his wife, but I'm sure it's complicated because his affair partner is also his business partner.  He sounds very passive......... but that's his choice.  <br>  <br>  Nothing will get better.|`|441002ba222c31246fd283fc8f2694bfaa	Personally, I would quit the job, tell my brother to do what he feels is best about the woman, (which would be tell her to get the **** out and own up to his wife) and if she is gone and you want to come back, that option is still viable.

At the time their motto might have been seen as an affirmation of their position of fighting for their rights, but truly it wasn't the numberous Panther related violence that got the African Americans their place in society it was the nonviolent marches of Dr. Rev. Martin Luther King and his subsequent bus boycotts and eventually his murder.  The politicians knew it would be a matter of time before "Black Power" slayed a few men and women to prove their seriousness so Dr.Rev. King attempted to step up before it became too ugly.<br>  <br>  Brown Pride just seems silly to me.  Don't misquote me, I understand the nature of the matter, but the slogan Brown Pride just screams out Gangland on History Channel.  Viva La Raza! is a much better slogan to go by.<br>  <br>  White Power is a reference to the KKK, Knights of the Klu Klux Klan.  Damn bunch of rednecks interested in terror and power and dominance.  I don't think the KKK ever realized that the civil war is over and that the South lost.<br>  <br>  Hearing the term White Power, only screams out that you have no sensitivity to the number of others who were murdered, tortured, terrorized and hated for just breathing.  Saying White Power means you have no attention to the law. <br>  <br>  Displaying any slogan that screams White/Black/Brown Pride/Power just announces to the world that you identify with the party that made this slogan popular and they all revolved around violence and seperatism.  Any and all of them are going to jerk up someone's ire somewhere due to the events of their past.<br>  <br>  It is true that a slight minority can get away with a display of pride for their heritage, while others can not.  But eitherway, no one should feel confident in brash display of stupidity.|`|AA11883252	There is no big deal. Black people just could care less what anyone else thinks about them wearing black power shirts.  Black power was a way of blacks to accept themselves and empower themselves.

For other uses, see ***** (disambiguation).<br>  Look up ***** in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.<br>  <br>  *****, a term for the female of a canine species in general, is frequently used as a term for a malicious, spiteful, domineering, intrusive, or unpleasant person, especially a woman. This second meaning has been in use since around 1400.[1] When used to describe a male, it may also confer the meaning of "subordinate", especially to another male, as in prison. Generally, this term is used to indicate that the person is acting outside the confines of their gender roles, such as when women are assertive or aggressive, or when men are passive or servile. More recent variants of ***** are bitchy, ill-tempered (1925), and to *****, to complain (1930).[1]|`|Q5KFND17aa	the simpsons and yahoo! answers are two different things, believe it or not.|`|3urQfMffaa	They say it on all the TV shows w/o censorship.

Try to discover yourself.  Good luck.|`|mGfCY4Ytaa	hmm. thats interesting. If I had to label you I would say that you are gay. maybe watching some porn can fix your situation. or maybe you just haven't met the right guy<br>  <br>  can you get hard for men that look like women? some transgender people don't get the bottom surgery so maybe you should look for a MTF that isn't planning on getting the SRS and isn't afriad to use what she's got.

lKICC1I5aa	(a) Itsumademo: Means "forever". This word is frequently used in conversation. <br>  <br>  (b) Eiei: Probably misspelling? "Eien" means "eternity". Offen used in an expression as "eien ni", which means "eternally". This word is commonly used. <br>  <br>  (c) Matsudai: Offen used in an expression as "matsudai made", which means "for generations to come". This word is often associated with the idea of what will happen to the descendants. An old-fashioned Japanese word. <br>  <br>  (d) Suenagaku: Means "for many years to come"  This word is often followed by a word representing happiness. E.g. "Suenagaku Oshiawaseni"<br>  <br>  (e) Sueshijuu: Means "in the future" This word is found in old Japanese literatures. Rarely used in a modern Japanese.

He tried to tell the nurse and doctors of his experience but they would not believe his because of what he had done to him self, they thought that he was crazy for trying to commit suicide and believed nothing that he tried saying, so he keep his story to him self for over 20 years .When one day we were talking and I said that I believe that people have near death experiences . Then my brother said I had one ,I said real tell me. It took a wail for him to tell me the story because of what he experienced with the doctors that they would not believe him, so he thought that I to would not believe him. His story he said that he tried to take his own life with pill and OD I new nothing of this my self and he said that he died and went to heaven and was told that it is wrong for any one to take there own life and that his time was not yet ,and that he would die when he will be 50 years old. At this time when he told me his story he look forward to dieing for he was no longer scared of death for he hade seen beyond and knows the truth that there is a heaven. My brother told me this story about 10 years ago. And my brother is  49 years old today. He has just over one year to live for we no not the time or day when he will die in his 50th age. It could be in the middle of his 50th age or the end or begging he does not know that answer. Today he does not want to die at that age of 50.because he has a wife and dose not want to leave her because of his love for her. I told him that what the lord has stated must come to pass .

6aIuZZi7aa	I want to thank you for your interest in studying other religions, as most individuals here are not interested in learning others' religious beliefs. Satanism is a non-theistic religion and philosophy as developed by Anton LaVey, therefore Satanists do not profess a belief in an afterlife, including "Hell" in Christian doctrine. I recommend that you purchase a copy of "The Satanic Bible" by Anton LaVey to develop a greater understanding of Satanism.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	It does not much matter what they believe, but they will go with satan, their daddy, he will pick them up, when they die, and take them to his house...<br>  That's a sure thing...just as sure as the Word of God is true...|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	No.<br>  <br>  Most Satanists are followers of LaVeyan Satanism, which is essentially an atheistic philosophy that rejects supernaturalism while upholding the very real fact that the human psychology is wired for ritual and storytelling, for gluttony, perversion, and pleasure.  Instead of forbidding these things, it elevates them to High Ritual, despite the absence of supernatural belief, and teaches responsibility in their use.|`|v80N4JB0aa	Satanism is a religion of life, not death|`|LUiiAlsJaa	No. live life now as there is no afterlife|`|9q95w6vyaa	I think they prefer the term Afterburn...|`|mPc0ZxbRaa	They believe exactly what Christians do except they are on the other side.|`|YaB5bpv7aa	im sure satanist and ppl wo serve him dont believe they are going to hell but if tehy dont change they are|`|Wkljv4DFaa	yup

You made them freely, accept the consequences.<br>  <br>  Number two -- if you are close and he knows you are gay -- tell him you are worried that you may be falling for him.  Have REAL communication, not the stilted bull that most Americans call communication, REAL communication, where you BOTH share your feelings and do so openly -- together you can better decide what to do.<br>  <br>  Number three -- accept initially that you at least have a best friend -- many people spend their life without ever having a real one.<br>  <br>  Kind thoughts,<br>  <br>  Hermes|`|758f1c16f8aa9b1d1195f3f7d3415ca4aa	Just slow down your spending...

IjKndeVvaa	I hate the logic, if you want to call it that, behind people's claims that you should have to present proof that souls do no exist. It basically goes along with the premise our judicial system has developed: innocent until proven guilty. Criminals don't have to prove they did nothing wrong. Lack of proof is considered proof of their innocence. <br>  <br>  Just as lack of proof of a god or soul is circumstantial evidence that one does not exist. <br>  <br>  "So the absence of evidence is the proof that something doesn't exist?"<br>  Precisely.<br>  <br>  "To me, with out a soul, there would be no reason for life. There certainly would be no love, caring, no education, no reason for it.

It is proven that other primates are capable of forming life-long friendships. They also have a system of education, it just is not as sophisticated as our own. They teach their young how to survive, how to use tools to obtain food. I'd call that an education. They care for their young. Even animals with brains as simple as birds care for their young, thus showing evidence of love. Other mammals also. You go and try to hurt a raccoon's offspring, and I guarantee you'll be attacked. A soul is not necessary for this, unless you're claiming all animals have a soul.|`|k6x2lVLYaa	I think I have a soul, I have thought there was something about me before I even heard the word when I was six years old. <br>  <br>  I believe I have a soul, because I feel something locked away in my chest, that is a glowing beautiful light, and I just know that god loves and will save this soul ....|`|wgiVLVdGaa	You're way too prideful.

i6Mi8uWIaa	Catholicism never taught Limbo. Here is what the Catholic Church ACTUALLY teaches regarding the unbaptized babies, in the Catechism of the Catholic Church:<br>  <br>  1261: "As regards children who have died without Baptism, the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God, as she does in her funeral rites for them. Indeed, the great mercy of God who desires that all men should be saved, and Jesus' tenderness toward children which caused Him to say: 'Let the children come to me, do not hinder them,' allow us to hop that there is a way of salvation for children who have died without Baptism. All the more urgent is the Church's call not to prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy Baptism." <br>  <br>  Such teaching is closely related to the larger concept of baptism of desire, which the Church has long held. <br>  <br>  CCC 1258: "The Church has always held the firm conviction that those who suffer death for the sake of the faith without having received Baptism are baptized by their death for and with Christ. This Baptism of blood, like the desire for Baptism, brings aout the fruits of Baptism without being a sacrament." <br>  <br>  1259: "For catechumens who die before their Baptism, their explicit desire to receive it, together with repentance for their sins, and charity, assures them the salvation that they were not able to receive through the sacrament." <br>  <br>  This all, of course, also applies to the smallest victims of abortion, the unborn child, killed in the name of "choice." <br>  <br>  And yes, we still have purgatory. The Bible tells us quite a bit about it. In order to stand in God's presence, we must be cleansed of actual sin (Hebrews 12:14, Revelation 21:27). This cleansing is a process. It's kind of like childbirth. You go through a lot of pain, but all with joyful anticipation of what will happen when that pain ends. <br>  <br>  The clearest, most indisputable passage from the Bible regarding Purgatory is 1 Corinthians 3:13-15:<br>  <br>  "Each man's work will become manifest; for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done. If the work which any man has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward. If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire." <br>  <br>  We enter purgatory when we die with sin still on our souls, having had no chance to confess our sins and receive absolution for them prior to our death. This is why the "last rites" are so important. It provides a final opportunity for a last confession and absolution.|`|FGcwxZz0aa	Limbo was always theological speculation. It was never a doctrine. You are opposed to Limbo which is confusing, why would you prefer these unbaptized babies go to hell? The Bible clearly states that one must be baptized for eternal life. All are born with original sin and the Bible states that no sin will enter heaven.<br>  <br>  The doctrine of Purgatory remains the same as doctrines never change. God bless!<br>  <br>  In Christ<br>  Fr. Joseph|`|z74a7wvlaa	Limbo/purgatory is the intermediary, lower heaven, paradise [ the bossom of abraham].<br>  We will be cleansed as refined in silver and by fire in gold,  in order to be perfect before we see God face to face. Purgatory is real.|`|8IHfytEvaa	While purgatory is official teaching of the Roman Catholic Denomination, the Bible teaches otherwise.<br>  <br>  Hebrews chapter nine says:<br>  <br>  27  Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment|`|qOGh6ODLaa	It was never a true Church teaching. The Catholic Church never "believed" in limbo. The existence of limbo for unbaptized infants is not part of divine revelation, but rather was and is an educated theological "guess." The term was coined by St. Augustine of Hippo and literally means "fringe." This came about because God has not chosen to reveal what happens to deceased unbaptized infants. We trust these precious babies to God's mercy knowing He loves them.|`|N6cCc9dOaa	I don`t know what church you go to buddy but hey in my religion Limbo is real and so is Purgatory and Heaven and Hell.The church you are going to is very wrong.God would never said a innocent Unbaptized soul to Hell.He would said them to a natural place of happiness.Yes Limbo is not as great as Heaven but it is better then Hell.You aught to avoid going back to your church because they are teaching you heresies.And heresies are very dangerous to believe in if you hope to get to Heaven.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	They have never declared there is a Limbo, they have never declared there isn't a Limbo. It is Speculative Theology, speculation about what happens to unbaptized children and the like. <br>  <br>  Purgatory is a fact. Limbo was a speculative attempt to answer a question for which revelation has not given us an answer.|`|AA11796124	<<Catholic church Limbo? Can you tell me when exactly the catholic church declared that there is no Limbo. In the first place who could believe that God would have innocent babies go to Limbo just because their parents did not have them baptized?????? Alos according to the church, is their still a purgatory??>><br>  <br>  Limbo has NEVER been an element of Catholic Dogma. Purgatory, on the other hand, has always been and always will be an element of Catholic Dogma.

BKxAt8mNaa	My horse always talks to me. He sounds alot like Napoleon Dynamite...Oh and I know I am not crazy!|`|AA10945101	Laugh!<br>  <br>  Well, we do know that dogs can't talk...they lack the physical "equipment" to do so...we don't know (and can't know) that a superior life form can't talk to people.  In other words, one is impossible, the other is merely improbable. Believing that the impossible is true earns you a trip to the loony bin, but believing that the improbable is true simply makes you a dreamer (or a lottery winner!).  <br>  <br>  ...but I couldn't help wondering what would happen to a person that claimed God was talking to them through their dog???<br>  <br>  Edit (related to what Major Trouble said)...having been blessed with the opportunity to meet a lot of crazy people in my life, I know that we don't really lock people up if they claim aliens (or their dog) is talking to them...we only lock them up when those aliens (or dogs) are telling them to do something that's against the law and they listen!! Having said that, I would agree with what you said if you focused solely on those who justify criminal activity because God or aliens or their dog told them to do it.  I do think that people are more likely to get away with doing more when God rather than aliens or a dog is the reported source.  HOWEVER, I would point out that the person hearing voices of aliens or dogs is a lot more likely to be judged "not guilty by reason of insanity".  Someone that blew up a building because aliens told him to do it is going to the loony bin...but the one says he did it because God told him to do it is more likely to go to jail!|`|HbCWNCQzaa	For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.

People accept this dual standard because it has always been there and they never think about it.   We need as many people in as many places as possible to point out, clearly and concisely, how much of a fallacy this is and how the entire basis of religion is spun from blind acceptance of dogma, the desire for a warm fuzzy feeling about the universe and not a lot else.|`|aHfC0VX8aa	haha thats a good one, here is a funny vid this reminded me of! <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?sourceid=navclient&rlz=1T4DKUS_enUS271US271&q=brian%20regan%20talking%20to%20ghosts&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wv#q=brian+regan+psychics&hl=en&emb=0" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videosearch?sour...</a><br>  <br>  Brian Regan is hilarious!|`|18be83adf26491424d29aa61ef0530d6aa	I actually have a cat that meows in a way that sounds like "I wuv you" and people have flocked to hear him.<br>  <br>  That's the God's honest truth.|`|IxR6Akpwaa	Because we all had imaginary friends when we were kids.

Jesus tells us and his listeners at the time that evil comes from within a man (or woman). Then he goes on to list all the sinful things people do. We can't blame them on anyone else - it is us that resist God's ways just as in the Garden of Eden so long ago.<br>  <br>  Mar 7:20 And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. <br>  <br>  21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, <br>  <br>  22 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: <br>  <br>  23 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man. <br>  <br>  The LORD God has said that there is none beside Him. There is not some supremely evil creature enticing us as some churches have been pleased to teach in the past for there own reasons.

OoOJr1fIaa	look no further my man, I have the evidence, real concrete evidence taken during a summer thunderstorm in 1989. unfortunately, regardless of how mind-boggling this video evidence of a real supernatural encounter may be. there are those who will disbelieve it, even after seeing it with their own two eyes. <br>  <br>  I tried to present it on "You Tube and God Tube" in a slow scan video format. however,i was not successful for only 5 people on one site and 24 on the other actually viewed the video. I would take that million-dollar challenge right now this second and collect that reward for finally providing this doubting Thomas world with some real supernatural images that truly explore every aspect of that spiritual realm.  unfortunately, they're now asking for real proof of these paranormal psyche powers, and not videotape evidence of an angelic being,or a demon. <br>  <br>  why would they be interested in a video recording that features cloud like objects that look like human skulls before they transform before the cameras all seeing lens into recognizable spiritual entity's? big deal many of the objects appeared in a huge killer tornado like an F-5 with absolutely no rotation in it. big deal,the people are more interested in their soap opera stars, sports heroes and rock musicians. with the end of days quickly approaching us at a record pace. I was quite disappointed after freely releasing this video,that received very little response. yes Mr. millionaire I accept the challenge to provide you with some real concrete supernatural evidence that will literally shake the very foundation of this earth.<br>  <br>  any takers?|`|f0JLp4hFaa	There's only one such offer that matters.<br>  <br>  The James Randi Educational Foundation has offered a million dollars for over a decade to anyone who could prove, under reasonable test conditions, any form of supernatural ability.  <br>  <br>  Why is the Randi offer the only one that matters?  Because Randi and his administrators put the energy into following up, performing the tests, providing the opportunities, and documenting the results.  The money actually exists, or did before they finally shut the challenge down, and obviously nobody ever won it.<br>  <br>  If you look on youtube for James Randi, you'll find many videos of him debunking people with mental powers.<br>  <br>  In the end, you can't get away from one fact that has ALWAYS been true:<br>  <br>  Natural effects have natural causes.|`|kEWknILEaa	Because it's a pretty safe bet.  If something is "supernatural"--above the natural world--how can it be proven?  What qualifies as proof?<br>  <br>  These guys believe that superstition is destructive, and they want to disabuse others of the notion that anything beyond the physical world ought to enter into a human's thought processes.<br>  <br>  I'm a little more tolerant, as long as we can avoid dogmatism.|`|i46hr7duaa	"The great spirit will not contact me if I am under test conditions."|`|0DC6d8pOaa	It is a very safe bet.

Unless you can make a chimp evolve into a human right in front of their eyes, you won't get the money.  These rewards are just as foolish when it comes to proof of spirits.  What am I supposed to do, capture one?<br>  They're all just foolish rewards that will never be given out.|`|0DwHIBUbaa	I guess you mean the James Randi challenge.

cdpBdzZtaa	I don't know about North America but in my view Christian and Islam are intolerant religions|`|D9lMg7A2aa	The early colonies pioneered (excuse the pun) religious toleration in the world !! It is a wonderful story told by William J Federer<br>  <br>  <br>  THE ORIGINAL 13-A Documentary History of Religion in America's Original Thirteen States - "The whole power over the subject of religion is left exclusively to the State governments, to be acted upon according to their sense of justice and the State Constitutions," wrote Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story in his Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, 1833. Who was Joseph Story? He was the founder of Harvard Law School and appointed to the Supreme Court by President James Madison - the same James Madison who introduced the First Amendment in the first session of Congress. To understand the progression of religious freedom in America, it is necessary to review the Constitutions of the original thirteen States, together with the Colonial Charters that preceded them, i.e.: VIRGINIA CHARTER OF KING JAMES I, 1606 "...propagating of Christian Religion to such People as yet live in Darkness..." DELAWARE CHARTER OF KING ADOLPHUS, 1626 "...further propagation of the Holy Gospel..." MASSACHUSETTS CONSTITUTION, 1780, Part 1, Article 3 "Every denomination of Christians...shall be equally under the protection of the law and no subordination of any one sect or denomination to another shall ever be established..." PENNSYLVANIA CONSTITUTION, 1968, Article 1, Section 3 "All men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences..." NORTH CAROLINA CONSTITUTION, 1971, Article 11, Section 4 "Beneficent provision for the poor, the unfortunate, and the orphan is one of the first duties of a civilized and a Christian state..." Examining Charters, Constitutions, Court Decisions and Correspondence, this overview of history is intended as a study help for those interested in discovering the role religion played in America's original thirteen States. The process of how the Federal Courts used the 14th Amendment to remove religion from States' jurisdiction, most notably in the 1947 Everson v. Board of Education case, and subsequently evolved it into its present interpretation, is the subject of another book. (Paperback, 416 pages, illustrations)|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, New York and originally Maryland were havens for religious dissidents.  Most of the remaining colonies had less religious tolerance than the mother country.|`|KVVD3B9vaa	The word is "tolerance", "toleration" is a lazy fiction.<br>  <br>  Constitutionally, the USA has complete religious tolerance. In reality, Fundamentalist Christians have far too much influence.

The clergy would get to wear really cool utility belts.  And the maxim would be that all beliefs are rejected until and unless modern methodology proves the utility of the beliefs.  Our most useful belief, in terms of understanding the word around us, comes from research in microbiology.  As it turns out, bacteria have collective consciousness.  They, the first life to evolve on our planet, the rulers of the world for the first billion years, when addressed through the proper methods, will supply the answers we're all yearning for.  In fact, they've never stopped ruling the planet, and are responsible for the Intelligent design of life.  Multicellular life forms were built (or evolved) by bacteria to serve as housing, food sources  and transportation devices.  This is why no life form on the planet isn't inhabited by millions, if not billions, of bacteria.  But the various species of bacteria formed factions and went to war against one another.  Yes, that's right, human beings (and all our antibacterial technology) are the result of unicellular arms race.  We're the nukes of bacterial world.|`|4AxBMYpUaa	A religion that doesn't worship one single thing, lets people decide things about their beliefs for themselves instead of telling them what to believe, and has lots of food.

Ku3A8kkzaa	Its the idea that an adult porn star is well aware of what they are doing but a child doesn't know what they are doing and is forced into doing something.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  What I am saying is that even it the child feels emotionally prepared etc. They can not be ready to something like this as they would not be Physically or Psychologically mature enough.<br>  <br>  Edit,<br>  In the UK the age of consent is 16, people do have sex around this age but it does not compare to the acts performed in some films. The fact is your argument has changed to say basically all porn is wrong, which I agree with. <br>  <br>  The fact is during puberty the body changes rapidly so the differences between the few years you talk of will very dramatic.|`|daBtvDv7aa	i agree|`|AA10067344	Exploiting children is considered immoral because they don't have the mental faculties to protect themselves.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  It's unreasonable to judge the mental capacity of a child on a case-by-case basis, therefore the law sets a legal age of majority and that's that.  Some minors may have the mental capacity to be morally included in a pornographic photo shoot but it's always better to work with absolutes when possible in legal matters.|`|rUgC7SPsaa	In order to make child porn, children must be forced into sex.  I use the word forced because by societal and legal norms, they aren't emotionally developed enough to decide consciously to have sex.<br>  <br>  Child porn is morally wrong because it is supporting and industry that thrives off of the exploitation of children, not consenting adults as per normal pornography.|`|0rAgtGNgaa	Because its just disgusting.  That is a child you are looking at; an innocent.   I wish i knew how or why any man/woman would see a child the way that normal people see adults.|`|spbqfjvbaa	It boils down to consent.  A 13yr old may THINK they are old enough to know what they want/give consent to sex acts, but the human brain that controls emotions, impulses & reasoning (aka the conscious brain) isn't fully developed until at the earliest 18yrs old.   That's why everyone in porn is supposed to be at least 18.<br>  <br>  If you talk about kids who haven't even hit puberty yet, they don't even know about sexual acts (unless they were abused) & have someone else cohersing them into doing those acts or being naked in front of a camera in sexy ways.  They can't consent to what they're doing & are usually trusting of people (innocent), so you're doing harm to them by providing them with knowlege that they are not ready to handle, & can scar any future intimate relationships they have in their future.<br>  <br>  What it boils down to is it is a CHILD.  Even if they matured fast & developed secondary sex characteristics, they are still CHILDREN.  They can't give consent to participating in porn because their brain is STILL not developmentally, emotionally, & cognitively ready to participate in this type of activity.   <br>  <br>  If the child was aware of sex & wasn't forced to do anything against their will, it's still a CHILD.  They may know the basics of sex, but they don't know the ramifications of being looked at, objectified, etc because their Brains are not developmentally ready yet.  And there's going to be a point that they just won't understand what they are doing (even if the are aware of sex) until their brain is ready to comprehend.  ANd that comes with time.|`|b2528d457cd58cf870fc6327e2248294aa	"I mentioned above that if the child is aware of what they are doing, not being forced to, and emotionally prepared then it would then be okay?"<br>  <br>  You're missing the point. If a child did hold these traits, then yeah, it probably would be okay. But they don't. They never will. They are still growing and no child that young will ever be mentally prepared for something like that, even if they claim to be. It's not necessarily wrong because it's a kid but because kids having sex aren't ready for it and are usually forced.|`|RD05jXYwaa	your comment about 13 vs 18 is valid. the powers that determine these things are going off on the concept that a 13 yr old does not have the right or the maturity to decided to pose nude where as an 18yr old is an adult and can make that decision for her/him self. neither position is absolutely true so what is the difference?  the powers that be. that's all. not right morality of justice just an arbitrary dividing line established by age. tmm|`|lFlapW8maa	neither is right when if you think about it morally.  so yes you are right.  that is what is wrong with society.  it is mostly morally corrupt.  <br>  <br>  so, yeah i agree with you.  looking at naked people who you have no relationship with is wrong.|`|u6ExZKkJaa	I personally think that looking at any porn is gross and it is even worse if the person or people under the age of 21 if your not old enough the buy alcohol then you're to young to be in porn movies!|`|UZ8wsmuFaa	Looking at porn can lead to action.<br>  <br>  If you are looking at non violent erotica with consenting adults then a little action might be a good thing.<br>  <br>  If you are getting off on rape or thoughts of sex with children then it may lead to illegal acts.<br>  <br>  As a teacher I split my mind into different modes. With my students my focus is on protection of my charges. <br>  <br>  Our brains have certain cues built into our genes which decide whether we are triggered to see people as family, friends or romantic interest. E.g. if someone lives with us under the same roof and is fed and fussed over by the maternal figure of the house we automacally see them as family and romanitic interest usually disapears. <br>  <br>  Or society is based on assumptions that certain situations are expected to be safe from sexual advances. Children are expected to be safe from parents, teachers etc. <br>  <br>  One of the reasons homosexuality and pedeaphilia have been taboo is that we expected our children to be safe from sexual advances of adluts or members of the same sex. <br>  <br>  E.g. Having a attractive female in charge of an boys scout group may increase concerns of the boys being distracted or taken advantage of sexually. If a gay male were in charge similar concerns might apply. <br>  <br>  Our laws set arbitrary lines such as being able to be a porn star at 18. Where ever we draw such lines there will be problems but having lines  allws us to feel safe while under their protection. We can then focus attention to provide extra moral guidance etc to protect people from legally being taken advantage of.<br>  <br>  Acceptance of homosexuality and changes to roles where men become take on caring roles has required great changes in what types of behaviors people are comfortable with. <br>  <br>  E.g. when I was young a man who kissed his son as he dropped him off to school would be looked on with suspician.

That is what will happen to the rest of us.<br>  <br>  Archangel Micheal <br>  Rev. 12:7-9 Micheal kicked Satan and his minions out of heaven (who would be strong enough to do that?) Most people say that Jesus threw Satan out of heaven anyway<br>  Dan. 12:1 Micheal is called great prince (which angel would be considered a prince other than Jesus)<br>  Jude 9 talks about Micheal being the archangel<br>  1Thess. 4:16 says the Lord himself will descend with an Archangel voice. (this is the only other reference to an archangel)<br>  <br>  That is why we believe it's Jesus.<br>  <br>  We don't have any prophecies we do our best at following and understanding the Bible. <br>  <br>  Jesus not Equal to God<br>  <br>  The Bible says at John 14:28 Jesus announces that the Father is greater than I am. So Jesus and God are NOT one.<br>  <br>  Also Colossians 1:15 says that Jesus is the firstborn of all creation. How can God create himself? Jesus is also called God's only begotten son John 3:16. In a family, are the father and son one person? No they are different people and the father is the head of the house. The same is in heaven. God created the family unit. God is the father and head over Jesus. 1 Cor. 11:3. How can God be head over the Christ if they are one person?<br>  <br>  John 1:1 which reads: "In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God." This is often presented from the Gospel of John to prove that Jesus was God. There are however several problems with this claim:<br>  <br>  There is also another reason, considering the Greek of the above verse which disproves the assertion that Jesus is referred to as God in the verse. In the verse above, the first time the word God is used, the Greek is HOTHEOS, which means The God. The second time the word God is used,"....and the word was God," the word for God is TONTHEOS, which means A God. Europeans have evolved a system of capital and small letters non-existent in Greek. The God, HOTHEOS is translated as God with a capital G, whereas Tontheos, which means A or ANY God is translated with a small g, god. In this case however, we see the unlawful translators trying to prove Jesus being God by putting capital G for both whereas it doesn't belong in the case of the "word".<br>  <br>  Also John 5:30 Jesus said I'm here to do the will of the one whom sent me. How can Jesus be sent forth if he and God are one person?<br>  <br>  .(Mark 10:18) Jesus said to him: 'Why do you call me good? Nobody is good, except one, God.<br>  <br>  (Philippians 2:5-6) Christ Jesus, who, although he was existing in God's form, gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God<br>  <br>  John 12:49) I have not spoken out of my own impulse, but the Father himself who sent me has given me a commandment as to what to tell and what to speak<br>  <br>  (John 14:28) I am going my way to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am<br>  <br>  (John 20:17) (Jesus speaking) I am ascending to my Father and your Father and to my God and your God.<br>  On the night of his arrest our Lord prayed in the garden of Gethsemane. He prayed vehemently for the well being of his Apostles. He asks God that "they all may be ONE, as you Father, are in me, and I in you; that they also may be ONE in us, that the world may believe that you sent me. And the glory which you gave me I have given them, and that they may be ONE just as we are ONE." (John 17:21-22) Clearly Jesus was not asking his Father to make his apostles one in the same person. He was requesting that they be one in thought, purpose, and deed. Jesus Christ and Jehovah, his God and our God, are indeed one, but it is a oneness in their mission. This oneness of purpose can be compared to having a President and a Vice President. They are not the same literal persons, but they are one in representing the office of the presidency.<br>  <br>  John 14:26 Jesus says that his Father will send a helper the holy spirit. How can a helper be sent forth if they were one?<br>  <br>  John 5:43 Jesus said he came in his Father's name.<br>  <br>  So as one can see Jesus even said he is not equal to God and that his FATHER had sent him (in human form). Jesus is very important to us and he is one of the foundations of our teachings but as you can see even from your own Bible they are not equal.<br>  <br>  There is no Smith founder.<br>  <br>  Holidays and BirthDays<br>  The only thing Jesus celebrated was the Passover and he went to a wedding. The rest are not supported by the Bible.<br>  <br>  Easter<br>  Catholic Encyclopedia said that a great many pagan customs celebrating the return of spring gravitated to Easter. The egg is the symbol of germinating life and the rabbit is the pagan symbol of fertility. <br>  <br>  Halloween<br>  Encyclopedia Americana says it's can be traced back to a Druid ceremony dated in pre-christian times.

Would you kill Hitler before he did anything wrong if you knew what would happen?   It's the same dilemma with different details, meant only to get people thinking about maximizing benefit or minimizing harm when making moral decisions.  There is no implication of a desire or policy to kill infants for convenience.<br>  <br>  Those who said they would not kill the child just killed ten people including the kid, so where is their morality and how does it help the child or the others?

Either way I don't see how this can be extrapolated to a general not valuing human life since those who choose to try to silence the child were motivated by the lives that would be lost by not doing so as well.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Link please.

Don't expect everyone to understand that though.<br>  <br>  It is possible to be both religious, and spiritual... it is possible to be irreligious... and more spiritual... it is possible to be nonspiritual... and more religious.|`|XZbYHcHiaa	Being religious is following religious practices without ever thinking about anything about else and believing it to be a means to an end.<br>  <br>  Being spirtual means being enlightened and being at peace and understanding god's method. You can only be enlightened if you question everything and try to find a meaningful solution without blindly conforming to religous practises.<br>  <br>  Thats what Buddha did, he sat under a tree and thought and questioned god's methods and his will and in the end he was enlgihtened and he understood and thus was at spiritual peace.<br>  He didnt practice any of the ritual which existed at that time.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	True religion leads to true spirituality.|`|Spixxn8Gaa	spirituality is the foundation for religion|`|veISMip0aa	Being spiritual is believing in something greater than yourself from your heart.  Being religious means following man-made dogma|`|D9lMg7A2aa	The philosopher Santayana said it best, <br>  <br>  "To attempt to be religious without practicing a specific religion is as possible as attempting to speak without a specific language."<br>  -- George Santayana<br>  <br>  I disagree totally with you.

This is a formal period of spiritual instruction and development which cumulates with reception into the church.<br>  <br>  If you have never been baptised then your full entry into the church will be marked by baptism. But if you have already been baptised (even in a non-catholic church) then that baptism will not need to be repeated. Either way, your full entry will also be marked by your receipt of the sacraments of confession and the eucharist.

The facination with all things female can take many forms over time. It does not have to include snipping off pieces of your anatomy. Enjoy the fantasy of being female. Imagine sex with other men if that's something that gets stuck in your head. But please don't take this too seriously right now. There are plenty of less obsessive and more productive ways to use your imagination. <br>  <br>  I live with three chronic illnesses. I have often imagined, wished, cried for a different body. But you know what? You could cut my legs completely off (instead of just having them be useless appendages at times), but I'd still be me. Simple human kindness is a powerful force and it starts by being kind to yourself. Accepting who you are. Understanding that your "female" feelings are in fact coming from your male body. Weird but true. Playing with hormones to make you more "female" will just make your feelings even more mixed up.<br>  <br>  If you can't get these thought out of your head, or they are disrupting your life, you could be depressed or obsessed rather than transgendered. Tell SOMEone about it, but probably NOT your mom or dad. Chances are they won't believe you, or will be very uncomfortable and make rude, thoughtless comments--hey, that's what family are for! <br>  <br>  My hope is that you won't let this get too far. It is possible to enjoy the paradoxes in life and the power of your imagination without it leading to unhappiness and misery. Don't hate who you are. Enjoy it! You are complicated and powerful and fun! Accept yourself as you are and learn to live with GUSTO!|`|Vfv92UZQaa	Talk to your counselor 1st and make sure this is something you want to go through with..

Nowadays we live in a modern era where the society is more liberal and acceptable, and since your parents live in it, their level of being upset, if so, will be much less in comparison of a parent being told this a couple of decades of centuries ago. In this case you have to be a realist, with a hint of an optimist, because being a pessimist will keep you in emotional confinement forever and being an idealist will not protect you from the possibility of your parents being angry with you. Realistically , you will have to tell your parents at some point, and if you know there is a possibility they might kick you out (which i hope will not occur)  you should wait till you 18 (that is if your parents are extremely traditional and conservative), but if you have a close relationship with your parents you might as well tell them now, they will probably be shocked and possibly upset for a while, but eventually they will acknowledge and accept it, since reality is what people have to accept. Obviously they will look at you differently, its implied within such a change, but they will not look at you differently in terms of you being their son, and how dear you are to them, only in terms of factual aspect of it, not psychological. Take it easy, as complicated as it is, since being a stranger to the situation it is easier for me to say than for you to do, but some things will happen regardless of your control, and time will settle it all down, right now youre hesitant, but eventually everyone will get used to the change and will bother with new things to worry about, you just have to let people adapt to who you are, and let yourself adapt to the people's reaction to who you are.

You must not assume that the progression of the church of Christ ends with the writings of Paul.|`|UI79JnJVaa	"The RECORDINGS of miraculous miracles<br>   in the Holy Bible, ended with Apostle Paul."|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	God is using us as vessels for miracles, just because you do not believe in them does not mean that they are not happening...I have seen many miracles in the last few years..|`|FgRUdQOBaa	I can only speak for myself but when I held the tiny little hands of my children when they were born, it was a miracle of God. <br>  Absolutely beyond any doubt.|`|EiiVMtjyaa	Dear Friend,<br>  <br>  If you say miracles happen every now and then, then..they have NOT stopped.  In fact,  Joh 14:12-15 Jesus said,  "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. <br>  13  And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. <br>  14  If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. <br>  <br>  By the way, leading those to Jesus Christ that their soul might be saved is more imporant that physical healing.  The physical body is temporary.  The soul is eternal.  And believe me, those who come to "know" the saving grace of Jesus Christ and live for Him and die to self.  That is a miracle, which only by the Power of the Holy Spirit can be manifested.<br>  <br>  Oh, and by the way...How do you "know"  Benny Hinn is a fake?|`|tW86bOMNaa	*Cough* Fantasy! *cough*|`|pxgIsS0Maa	Why do you say that?  Do you have proof?|`|246ef99fe9f19ae4da709934694ddcd8aa	The Second Coming was supposed to have happened withing the lifetime of the Apostles. When he had not returned by the end of their lives things started getting a little strained. Many of the miracles were learned by word of mouth and had not been confirmed, but that was OK because Jesus was going to show up real soon; there is no need to verify.<br>  <br>  By then the belief had gotten mixed up with other Roman religions and the Apostles had lost control of it. The First Council of Nicaea put a cap on which books could be canon and anything else that happened was no longer added to the Bible.
jTVbjyghaa	I'll have nothing to say. I'm not ashamed of my beliefs.|`|SzqCD0G0aa	I agree with the person above me. <br>  <br>  Atheists (well many) won't deny that a guy named Jesus existed then, MANY will challenge and want evidence of his divinity (which is what you take on faith, as you weren't there to see it).<br>  <br>  But my question to you, why would an atheist who, one seeks evidence of christs divinity and two, has no belief in deities (yours or anyone else's) NEED to make up excuses on your supposed "Judgement Day".<br>  <br>  According to many of your fellow christians, on your god knows the true heart of everyone (though I see on this site christians making the same claim, that they know the minds hearts thoughts of every nonbeliever), so there would be no excuse needed.|`|c8828614b563cd3de41253b6a9e40991aa	When the moment really comes and they actually find themselves in His presence, they won't be able to say a word.

Do you really think any of US atheists would care? If you are an atheist do you think they would have an answer to that question? If anything all the crazy christians would be saying, "What the hell?" "Thanks God, you are killing off my great family and loved ones". I think if there was a "Final day", I think that everyone, including yourself, would hate the fact you put so much time in effort in believing in a book that has been translated and rewritten so many times throughout the houndreds of years. If you dig deep enough into the bible, it's very hypocritical on so many levels. So the real question is what would you do? Would you just stand there or try everything just to survive. It's funny that so many christians say they will be on there knees when the crap hits the fan, but yet so many christians will fight to survive in everyday life. If people would just except that it's their day to die on any day, the population of our earth would dramatically decrease. I guess you should have asked what the true definition of the "Final Day" really is on an individual basis. What to tell the lord, hmmm... I think I'd be a little pissed and ask alot of questions that he wouldn't be able to answer logically.|`|kR8S9jTyaa	I am sorry!

Christ has chosen us, we have chosen Him, and by this choice we become united to Him and are to live from henceforth, not unto ourselves, but unto Him who has died for us. But this union can only be preserved by constant watchfulness, lest we fall into temptation and make a different choice, for we are free always to take another master if we so desire. Union with Christ means an unfailing preference for Him in every act and thought.<br>  <br>   We are to consider ourselves as constituting the family of Christ, and we are to follow Him as dear children. Adopted into the household of God, shall we not honor our Father and our kindred? .<br>  <br>  We must establish an unyielding enmity between our souls and our foe, but we must open our hearts to the power and influence of the Holy Spirit. We want Satan's darkness to be shut out and the light of Heaven to flow in. We want to become so sensitive to holy influences that the lightest whisper of Jesus will move our souls. . . . Then we shall delight to do the will of God, and Christ can own us before the Father and before the holy angels as those who abide in Him. <br>  <br>       But we shall not boast of our holiness. As we have clearer views of Christ's spotless and infinite purity we shall feel as did Daniel when he beheld the glory of the Lord and said, "My comeliness was turned in me into corruption" (Dan. 10:8). We cannot say, "I am sinless" till this vile body is changed and fashioned like unto His glorious body. But if we constantly seek to follow Jesus, the blessed hope is ours of standing before the throne of God without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing, complete in Christ, robed in His righteousness and perfection.|`|rThIVk2maa	You're a horrible god.|`|yoKHoKXjaa	Get your shotguns people!

When you present the Gospels to people, you need to use the Bible to show them what God will do for mankind in the near future.  Below are 7 basic questions that you need to be able to show people the answer from the Bible.<br>  <br>  1.  Who is God?<br>  2.  Is God a Real Person?<br>  3.  Does God Have a Name?<br>  4.  Is Jesus Almighty God?<br>  5.  Does God Care About Me?<br>  6.  What's God's Purpose For Mankind?<br>  7.  Does God Accept All Forms of Worship and why?<br>  <br>  If you can answer those basic questions with your Bible, then you good to go.|`|8OeulLkmaa	I have learned so much about many religions and I have found this place very educational to say the least.  I can't say I agree with everything I have learned but it has been enlightening.  <br>  <br>  I don't learn anything from the "haters" though. <br>  <br>  I am a christian btw.|`|8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	No you can't change people's belief nor enlighten anyone. But you can get enlightened yourself on the fact that lots of different beliefs exist and on the fact that lots of people are openly aggressive toward those who don't share their own beliefs.|`|v7Wflu78aa	Yes - there was a very good answer about the history leading up to English translations of the Bible.  That was in the past hour or two.<br>  <br>  There is an emotional or psychological problem called "poor boundaries."  This is when a person doesn't know where he ends and the next person begins.  For example, a person with weak boundaries would believe that if she likes strawberry, then every body must like strawberry.   Or, weak boundaries might allow a person to think, "My best friend doesn't like chocolate, so maybe there is something wrong with me for liking chocolate."<br>  <br>  Parents show weak boundaries when they assume a child is hungry or hot or cold just because the parent is.<br>  <br>  Religion - especially when it involves missionaries - is a major player in the universe of poor boundaries.  A person with poor boundaries thinks that their beliefs, their matters of faith, are better than another person's faith.  I am not going to try to convince you that licorice is better than gummy bears.  Your truth is yours, mine is mine.<br>  <br>  Your plans to become a missionary are disturbing.  You are taught to be so arrogant that you are willing to spend time to convince other people that they are wrong and you are right.<br>  <br>  How can I be so sure that poor boundaries is a bad thing, rather than a good thing?  Because symptoms of poor boundaries include being an over-protective parent, insisting your spouse feel and act the way you do, stealing, reading other people's private email, and molesting children.  People with healthy boundaries just don't do these things - they are not even TEMPTED to do those things.<br>  <br>  I do respect some missionaries: I know a Catholic Nun who has lived with the poor in Asia for over 40 years - except when she was head of her order.  She is 100% devoted to making the society around her better: more education, better health care, organizing groups of villages to increase their political awareness, and so on.<br>  <br>  She is appalled at missionaries who seek to teach a religion, rather than simply help the people.  In fact, the missionaries who are dedicated to good work help to deport missionaries whose mission is to convert people.<br>  <br>  Please, do not try to convert anyone when you are a missionary.|`|xopIi2Vfaa	I think you have the right idea. The only way to convince somebody that you mean what you say about your religion is by acting it. <br>  A lot of people talk about following Jesus, but like the young man in the bible story, when it comes to act on it and literally give everything they own away, they turn away from it. <br>  I would furthermore recommend to you to be concerned in saving the body first and not worry too much about the soul. If people are homeless and hungry they will be less concerned about things which don't affect their immediate survival than when they have enough to eat and a safe shelter. <br>  Keep in mind: preach the gospel but use words only if unavoidable.<br>  I would particularly avoid preaching the end times, as this is so hard to transmit by example. It also doesn't do people much good. Rather help them to cope with life today.|`|AA11521494	Nobody ever changed their opinion about religion just from words, unless there is "something" there that makes them interested already and then being here can bring more understanding.

Second, I think that we are helping ourselves out by writing our testimonies out.  Lastly, we will touch the lives of many, and we will not know it.  <br>  I spent two years knocking on doors everyday.  If you think that you are going to go on a mission similar to what I did and think that you are going to “save” all the peoples lives that you talk to, you are dead wrong.  It is a similar process to what you are doing now.  There is a lot of rejection, but when you find one who gets it that is what makes it all worth it!  Keep up the good work!  Think of all that Christ had to suffer!  Though we might have to suffer a little now it will all pay off in the end!|`|K8QTdUnfaa	This is a place for asking questions and receiving answers, not for proselytizing.<br>  <br>  If you answer a religious question honestly and provide sources, then its up to the asker to decide how they feel about your answer.  Pushing your beliefs doesn't do anything for anybody.|`|0XR15Dbuaa	Probably not.<br>  I think folks come here because they enjoy arguing, or playful banter, whatever you call it.<br>  I would hope that someone looking for "enlightenment" of some kind would not limit their search to Y!A.|`|BcHbEdliaa	I don't know if Yahoo Answers specifically has any distinct advantages or disadvantages over other mediums when it comes to changing people's religious beliefs. I think there are some people who are looking for answers wherever they can find them, people who aren't sure whether or not God exists and could easily be swayed by a sincere, respectful, honest expression of your beliefs. Just be sure not to take it too far and avoid preaching at people who don't want to be preached at.<br>  <br>  The real problem is, most people already have very strong beliefs when it comes to religion, and nothing you say in either direction is going to sway them from what they believe. Most people will believe, of course, that their own religion (or lack thereof) is the correct one, and no matter what it is, it's often deeply linked to their identity as a person through family traditions or ethical values. So when you ask them to change their religion, they might see it as a personal affront against their own judgment.<br>  <br>  Then there are people like myself who are simply tired of hearing about religion not because it's such a personal issue to us, but because, like politics, women's rights, animal rights and the like, it's been debated to the point that new points are almost never made, and instead we're forced to hear the same four arguments and counter-arguments repeated over and over and over again until they all sound meaningless. Occasional friendly debate can be very fun and enlightening sometimes, but there are many times when I don't want to get into an argument about it because it uses up so much effort with so little reward.<br>  <br>  Since this is a site devoted to giving users answers to all sorts of questions, I think that there IS a high possibility you could be a positive influence to people who are still unsure about their faith. Just make certain that you are respectful in what you say and don't try to force them to agree with your views. Give them information, give them your own experiences, but if they decide not to agree with you, respect that and move on. It's so easy on the internet to start up flame wars on the topic of the religion, but they're really not worth it. They're great for venting your frustration at the world, but probably of very little use in convincing others of the justness of your cause.<br>  <br>  Personally, I prefer the aspect of Christianity that calls for relieving the suffering of your fellow man, but if you are trying to "save" people, especially in such an anonymous place where someone can easily misinterpret your intentions, stick to the people who want to be saved.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I was working on this awhile so I didn't see all the comments posted before mine, but I want to say that I highly agree with tigris' post, and if I'd seen that before I might not have bothered writing this one. Tigris is awesome.

They talk about less spending and fewer taxes, yet all of the Republican presidents since Reagan have spent more, put us in debt from wars than any other president.  They use "no new taxes" to keep the votes rolling in...oblivious to the fact that taxes need to pay the debts that they keep accumulating.  The GOP is evil to our society and the mess we are in proves it.

Absolutely riveting. <br>  An Essay On Development Of Christian Doctrine (Notre Dame Series in the Great Books, No 4) (Paperback)<br>  by John Henry Newman <br>   "He demonstrates that the basic "rule" under which Christianity proceeded through the centuries is to be found in the principle of development, and emphasizes that thoughout the entire life of the Church this law of development has been in effect and safeguards the faith from any real corruption. "<br>  <br>  3) Belief is as much in the will as in the mind, if not more. And -- not to be annoying -- that is the only rational way to see things. <br>  “Man can be compelled to do a good many things. There are a good many other things he can do in a halfhearted fashion, as it were, against his will. But belief can never be halfhearted. One can believe only if one wishes to. Perhap the credibility of a given person will be revealed to me so persuasively that I cannot help but think: It is wrong not to believe him; I “must” believe him. But this last step can be taken only in complete freedom, and that means that it can also not be taken. There may be plenty of compelling arguments for a man’s cedibility; but no argument can force us to believe him.<br>  <br>  The unanimity of statements on this point is astonishing; and the agreement ranges all the way from Augustine and Thomas to Kierkegaard, Newman and Andre Gide. Augustine’s phrase from the Commentary on John is famous; “Nemo credit nisi volens”: No one believes except of his own free will. Kierkegaard says that one man can do much for another, “but give him belief, he cannot”. Newman is forever stressing, in one guise or another, the one idea that belief is something other than the result of a logical process; it is precisely not “a conclusion from premises”. “For directly you have a conviction that you ought to believe, reason has done its part, and what is wanted for faith is, not proof, but will.” And Andre Gide? In the last jottings he published after his Journals we may read these sentences: “There is more light in Christ’s words than in any other human word. This is not enough, it seems, to be a Christian: in addition, one must believe. Well, I do not believe.” Taken all together, these statements obviously mean the following: It is one thing to regard what someone else has said as interesting, clever, important, magnificent, the product of genius or absolutely “true”. We may feel compelled to to think and say any and all these things in utter sincerity. But it is quite a different matter to accept precisely the same statements in the way of belief. In order for this other matter, belief, to come about, a further step is necessary. A free assent of will must be performed. Belief rests upon volition” (Josef Pieper, Faith, Hope, Love, p 35-36).<br>  <br>  ==============================<br>  I seem to annoy everybody and to be thought a loud-mouth jerk. But I DO THINK and research whatever I answer. Just wish someone would take me up on it and argue me to the ground, so to speak.|`|WalnRzfGaa	yes and that would be the belief of no God/Gods

These scientists assume there is no God, and then try to find explanations. It's not always the case, but often is. However, there are many, many things that were once thought to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but were later shown to be quite inaccurate. For instance, the belief in abiogenesis (that life can come from non-life), persisted for millenia, if I remember correctly. Pasteur proved in a series of experiments, however, that it could not possibly be true. There's lots of other examples, so I'm just going to wait until these ideas are proven wrong (which many have been), and the rest of the world figures out what Christians already know: that things really did happen like the Bible says. FYI, if someone is a straightforward evolutionist, then they believe in abiogenesis (if everything living evolved from something, and there was a time when nothing was alive, where did the first living thing come from?), which seems pretty foolish to me.|`|LYnuEdKUaa	The Creation story is a form of writing called allegory.

I always try to look for a sign from the Lady to give me some clue as to if I am on the right track or not. These can be as simple as a stone you see while walking or a phone call, or as complex as someone coming to you and saying they have been sent to initiate you. The latter hardly ever happens but the former is something to keep your eyes open for. It's always nice to get a little bit of confirmation from above so when you do find your sign be sure to treat it with respect and give it a place of honor either on your altar or carried on your person. I hope this has been helpful.|`|OYG8vWhSaa	Do it when you feel the need. That's the trick with paganism- there's no overlord telling you what and when to do things.

The oath that you gave at your dedication is to seal that path. A Wiccan Dedication is a dedication to a select purpose for a select period of time. <br>  <br>  Initiation (ini?ti?a?tion) by definition is;<br>  1.The act or an instance of initiating. <br>  2.The process of being initiated.<br>  3.The rites, ceremonies, ordeals, or instructions with which one is made a member of a sect or society or is invested with a particular function or status.<br>  4.The condition of being initiated into some experience or sphere of activity.<br>  5.A ceremony, ritual, test, or period of instruction with which a new member is admitted to an organization or office or to knowledge. <br>  <br>  As a Wiccan or Witch an Initiation is placing your self into a new life, a new state of being. By participating in an Initiation Rite, you are entering into a new state of spiritual consciousness. <br>  <br>  Both a Dedication and an Initiation are life passage rites, and can assist in the development of your spiritual potential. It must be stressed that a Dedication Rite or an Initiation Rite cannot alter a person from their natural nature, nor should these rites be unwillingly imposed upon anyone. In the Craft both a Dedication and Initiation Rite are rites of passage based in magick and used to mark a person’s transition from one point in their life to another. Neither should be sought without proper understanding or undertaken lightly.<br>  <br>  Most Covens, Circles and Groves ask individuals to study or work with them on some level or another for a set period of time before ever seeking a dedication or initiation with them. So remember that in the Craft a dedication is like a short term commitment to a task, and an initiation is a long term commitment to a way. <br>  <br>  In contrast to a Dedication or an Initiation performed by a leader or superior of an organization or group, there are the self performed versions of the same rites done by a Coven, Circle or Grove. This growing trend is called a self-dedication or self-initiation, and is surrounded by a lot of controversy in the Craft. Most of the time people who have been dedicated or initiated into Covens, Circles or Groves or who have had those same rites performed for them by Esoteric Traditions tend to look differently at those who choose to perform their dedication or initiation themselves.<br>  <br>  The validity of a Self-Dedication or Self-Initiation is one of the greatest topics of debate in the Pagan community today and really is a matter of personal opinion and choice, especially since there is no set doctrine in the Craft other than the Wiccan Rede and the Law of the Craft. Clearly what’s most important is an individual’s true spiritual and magickal attainment between themselves and the Goddess and God, as well as between their teacher and/or mentor if there is one, not the public recognition. In many cases when there is a serious lack of teachers or mentors in a community, a self performed Dedication or Initiation Rite would be the only avenue available to a seeker or student of the Craft. <br>  <br>  I hope this excerpt from the SCWF Year and One Day Lesson Course helps you out.<br>  <br>  Blessed Be<br>  <br>  Nyjh|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	If you believe the tenents of a religion, you are ready for its initiation rites.

AA11938604	Boy, you sure got under the skin of all those pro abortionists...I mean, anti lifers (sorry).  I think it's funny too that they hold animals in higher regard than humans who have not been born yet.  I find it very interesting too that their bleeding hearts scream with agony when a murderer finally gets what he deserves when his death sentence is finally carried out...30 years after the fact.  Isn't if funny that some people are all for taking the life of an unborn, and saving the life of a vicious criminal?  Isn't if funny they support the idea of removing an unborn child from a mother piece by piece, but won't eat eggs because that's considered cruel? (I know such a person personally!)  Isn't it funny too, that many people rant and rave about your question (without even answering the question), because it makes abortion sound negative, yet call somebody like you ANTI abortion?  What about the phrase PRO life?  That sounds much more positive.  I guess that's just one of many streets that run through liberal land that only goes one way.  Great question by the way, thanks for asking.|`|WNWKDw4uaa	Yes.|`|SsB7aRExaa	When the ONLY "choice" you offer is abortion, you are pro-abortion.  When you pass laws that make adoption more difficult and expensive, you are pro-abortion.<br>  <br>  But to answer your question, no, it's not.  Generally, the pro-aborts are pagans, and pagans often perform animal sacrifice as part of their rites, so there is no contradiction.<br>  <br>  And of course, the point is, if you are going to try to make a philosophical point in a public forum, spelling counts, lest you wind up looking stupid and thereby discrediting your viewpoint.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	No, that would be begging the question. It is precisely the point of contention whether or not a fetus should be considered equal to a child.|`|29X6EEsKaa	Animal rites? You mean sacrifices?|`|qbelhflAaa	You are a wee bit biased, aren't you?<br>  <br>  No one is pro-abortion.<br>  I don't know anyone who is anti-life either.|`|7ylYxklsaa	You can't be something that doesn't exist. There's no such thing as pro-abortion.|`|AA11796124	<<do you feel its contradictory to be pro abortion and stand up for animal rites?>><br>  <br>  It's not necessarily a contradiction, just evidence that someone's clouded judgment when it comes to the Dignity of Life; human life in particular.<br>  <br>  Such a person, who is pro-aboriton but also stands up for animal rights, has made the mistake of either elevating the level of animal life to human or lowered human life to that of animal.<br>  <br>  This sort of thing is exactly what leads one to make such curious conclusions as being pro-abortion yet pro-animals life.<br>  <br>  Human life IS a higher order of life. It is human beings, not animals, that are made in His Image and Likeness. This is not to say that animals don't count. They certainly do. God took the time to create a seemingly endless variety of animal life - with a purpose too. Animals serve the Will of God by serving humanity.<br>  <br>  Therefore, despite being a lower order of life, animals are a valuable God-given resource that should not be misused or abused. Same as human life.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	I would say I see a difference between being pro-abortion and being pro-choice. I am pro-choice and don't see it as inconsistent with wanting animals to be treated humanely where they are shown to be sentient and capable of experience trauma and suffering. A fetus lacks the brain development for consciousness and ability to experience pain until somewhere in the third trimester. I would prefer that no one need an abortion and that birth control or abstinence be practiced. Where that fails though I know its not possible for both to have equal rights when a potential human relies on the body and sustenance as host of a fully formed one and give precedence and freedom of choice to the conscious, sentient, and feeling person who must bear the child. I don't in any way see this as inconsistent with advocating animals be treated humanely.<br>  <br>  You did mean to write rights rather then rites, right? => Rites are ceremonies.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	There is no more anyone who is pro abortion than there is anyone who is pro-appendectomy.

So if you like a girl (man), and she (he) likes you, and you have sex then you become married in God's eyes.<br>  <br>  Exodus 22:16 "If a man seduces a virgin who is not pledged to be married and sleeps with her, he must pay the bride-price, and she shall be his wife."<br>  <br>  It's not a necessity to be ceremonially married first to have sex. Yes it's better to be betrothed (engaged) first, but it's not a sin if a couple do it before, but they need to consider God's word on the matter, they are bound to live married together for the rest of their lives.<br>  <br>  EDIT: however, I should add, that sex outside the confines of marriage is sin, as in uncommitted (that's not a life-long committment) sex. Fornication is also defined as the sexual sins as defined in the Law (Torah). When you join together with another person you become married to that person, that's the Biblical definition of marriage, the civil wedding ceremony is not beginning of marriage, but the sexual act that consumates the marriages.|`|AA11227341	ya, not sure of the percentage no one is out getting numbers as for commitment to abstain, I would think, no, believe that all real Christians do practice abstinence (not that we make a "commitment" and if some do that's fine), we all have needs sure but we know that we are not to fornicate--to have sex out of marriage; sex with anyone or to commit adultery--having sex with a married person or a married person having sex outside his or her marriage.  There are still some innocent people out there (innocent---virgins) keeping themselves pure till marriage.  Peace out|`|lJ2baVliaa	Ok I think there may be some confusion here.

e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  No rational, thinking person (who had not been indoctrinated from an early age) could possibly believe in belief systems like calvinism, radical fundamentalism, and blind-faith evangelicalism.<br>  <br>  And sad as it is, most people in my country (USA) confuse calvinism and evangelism with Christianity.

God will provide you with everything you need, and bless you with thing you want. but you have to accept him as ur savoir first. and going by his laws and living a good life wont get you to heaven. you have to confess and admit you are a sinner. and want to live ur life for himfor ever, so he can bless you and you can go to heaven. and i am prolly gonna get so many thumbs down for answering this question, but i dont ccare, i am stating the trueth. whether you believe it or not.|`|KmnbjZIdaa	What I understand is that God is in no obligation to reveal Himself to everybody through faith.

SNJgLxQzaa	Contradiction does not necessarily imply falsehood. There are contradictions throughout creation -- in science, quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity appear to contradict one another, and in mathematical set theory, there's Cantor's Paradise and Russell's Paradox.<br>  <br>  Do contradictions in math mean that mathematics is false? Do contradictions in science mean that science is false? Do contradictions in creation imply that the creation in which we live is false?<br>  <br>  Hardly...<br>  <br>  "[Man] has always cared more for truth than for consistency. If he saw two truths that seemed to contradict each other, he would take the two truths and the contradiction along with them. His spiritual sight is stereoscopic, like his physical sight: he sees two different pictures at once and yet sees all the better for that."<br>  <br>  If you really want to consider a mind-blowing paradox/contradiction, just read John chapter 10.<br>  <br>  In John chapter 10, Jesus states that, "The Father... is greater than all," and moments later declares that He and the Father "are one."<br>  <br>  But the transitive property of equivalence relations states that all things are numerically equal to themselves. Since the Father is greater than all, and the Father and Son are one, this implies that Christ must also be greater than all. So there must be two things - namely, the Father and the Son - that are greater than everything else; but no thing can be greater than everything if there is something else that is equal to it!<br>  <br>  Yes, this is an apparently hopeless contradiction. But this hopeless contradiction lead to the development of set theory in mathematics almost 2,000 years after the fact... Now, math theorists consider questions such as the paradox of the set of all sets, the null/empty set, the set containing the set of all sets, the infinite of infinities, etc.<br>  <br>  Look up some of Cantor's theories, such as the transfinite, the absolute infinite, the cardinality of infinite sets, etc.... All of these theories were 20th century mathematical discoveries which resulted from studying an apparent contradiction in the words of Christ. Cantor eventually dedicated all of his discoveries to the God of the Bible.<br>  <br>  Bottom line? If religion is crazy, it's because the universe is crazy, and if there are contradictions in the Bible, it's because there are contradictions in the laws of nature. Since God created the laws of nature, He can do with them whatever He desires. So if God says that a man can be 8 years old and 18 years old at the same point in time, then so be it!<br>  <br>  And finally, to respond directly to your "question".... I believe that the contradictions you point out could possibly be scientifically reconciled using Einstein's Theory of Relativity:<br>  <br>  "[D]o not forget this one thing, brethren: With the Lord a day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day." - II Peter 3:8 (ref. Psalm 90:4)|`|0sDDwlk1aa	Your not reading it right your just looking for contradictions. <br>   <br>  2 Samuel 24:1 <br>  Again the anger of the Lord was aroused against Israel, and He moved David against them to say, "Go, number Israel and Judah."<br>  <br>  1 Chronicles 21:1-2 <br>  Now Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel. 2  So David said to Joab and to the leaders of the people,"Go, number Isreael from Beersheba to Dan, and bring the nember of them to me that I may know it."<br>  <br>  see the difference.<br>  Read all of it and it will make since.|`|d5d3d49e305b06c6f5252e0d0508cd4baa	Well...you made some valid points, but ....you know.....the Bible's definition of faith is: Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.

Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?<br>  <br>  We think we are smart and try to tell God and man how smart we are...but ...Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.<br>  <br>  Nothing to argue about.  Let's just love each other.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Readers should not fail to see that the 2 verses that chowderhead dislikes in the Bible, the only two really (since the above are text-critical questions, not dogmatic ones, certainly nothing related to the Faith -- Who gives a hang how old Ahaziah was !!!) are these.<br>  <br>  Galatians !<br>  8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. 9 As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.<br>  <br>  <br>  And Chowderhead knows that ISLAM is reduced to saying the same sorts of things about Moonies and Mormons. Okay, Chowderhead, the revelation that preceded Islam by 700 years is wrong, and the only angel that we will allow to give a new 'revelation' is your special angel. <br>  <br>  I'm so damn logical it scares me.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	I say that the Bible was not written to be contradiction free, and not written to be read literally 100% of the time.<br>  <br>  You're approaching the Bible as if it were supposed to be a history book, in the vein of many fundamentalists and evangelicals.  It can't be done without bending logic to ridiculous degrees.<br>  <br>  The people who wrote the Old Testament didn't have the same view of history as we in the post-Gibbons, west.

We can see that the difference in ages is 20 years. The system of number notation used by the Jews at the time of Ezra consisted of horizontal hooks that represented decades.  would equal the number 14 where  would be 24. If one or both of the hooks were smudged or flaked off of a papyri, then the dates would be off by ten years or a factor of ten.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.carm.org/bible-difficulties/joshua-esther/how-old-was-ahaziah-when-he-began-rule-over-jerusalem" rel="nofollow">http://www.carm.org/bible-difficulties/j...</a><br>  <br>  II Kings 24:8 vs II Chronicles 36:9<br>  <br>  The correct age of Jehoiachin was 18, not 8. Obviously, Jehoiachin was 18 when he began his rule since it says he did evil in the site of the Lord which suggests maturity and responsibility.<br>  <br>  The discrepancy in ages is probably due to a copyist error. We can see that the difference in ages is 10 years. The system of number notation used by the Jews at the time of Ezra consisted of horizontal hooks that represented values of ten.  would equal the number 14 where  would be 24.

It means, "men of valor, army, host, etc." It seems to mean that the men numbered in 2 Samuel 24:9 were those with battle experience where the men of 1 Chronicles 21:5 were not. It was most probably true that there were an additional 300,000 men ready for battle who had not yet experienced it. Therefore, 2 Sam. 24:9 numbers only the experienced men, where 1 Chronicles 21:5 numbers all men of battle ready age.<br>  <br>  Regarding Judah's number difference:<br>  The solution seems to provided for us in the following verse six which says, "But he did not number Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king’s command was abhorrent to Joab," (NASB). Verse six states that the numbering process had not yet been completed since the tribes of Levi and Benjamin had not been numbered.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.carm.org/bible-difficulties/joshua-esther/how-many-fighting-men-were-found-judah-and-israel" rel="nofollow">http://www.carm.org/bible-difficulties/j...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The fact that this is a copyist error does not invalidate the inspiration or authority of Scripture. <br>  <br>  Remember, God inspired the originals. They were without error. <br>  <br>  The copies have problems, though very very few. The copies are copies of inspired documents and, unfortunately, some copyist errors did creep into the manuscripts. However, they do not affect any doctrinal areas and are very rare.<br>  <br>  If you want to claim the bible is wrong because of man's errors then there really is nothing that can be done to change your mind. If on the other hand you are really looking for the truth regarding these false claims then read through CARM and other sites that deal with them.|`|YaB5bpv7aa	these are not contradictions these men only served as kind at different times in their lvies and different ages is all. god is real the bible is real and im sorry but  real christians who are serving god to teh best of their ability are not gonna go to hell .ur saying christians are being stupid well im sorry but its u who is being stupid|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	And don't forget that this omniscient deity doesn't know that rabbits do not chew the cud (they don't even have the right number of stomachs for it) and that bats are mammals (not birds as stated in the Bible).|`|oFiStmkGaa	All your questions answered as the following link: <a href="http://prophetofdoom.net/Bible_contradictions.Islam" rel="nofollow">http://prophetofdoom.net/Bible_contradic...</a>|`|b30632dc722205bf91353bbc7a7158acaa	Wow!<br>  Somebody's been a busy bee!<br>  <><|`|da807e7e17ab4dd2a5d678db7a393207aa	My faith isn't rocked by your ' revelations.'

No big deal. The Bible is an excellent record of God's dealings with mankind and a person can be enlightened by studying it.

g54tGcRvaa	Your English is already better than that of most people on Yahoo Answers.<br>  <br>  English's worldwide status has nothing to do with its merits as a language, it's about England's achievements in colonization, and American globalization.  English is an imperfect language that will never go away.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	I believe English is much harder to learn than Russian. Although Russian grammar can be complex, English is made more difficult by being based on two different language groups, Germanic and Romance, with grammar rules from both. This leads to many exceptions to rules. That, and the fact that our spelling hasn't matched pronunciation in hundreds of years, make English very difficult. But it's a world language because of history: The British Empire spread over much of the world, and they brought English with them.<br>  <br>  Russian, by the way, is a very useful language in the world, too. It has a rich literature, and I love the way it sounds.<br>  <br>  Я люблю русский язык!|`|EUVr6uNVaa	Your English is very good if you have only been learning it a year. Personally I think its a tricky language to grasp. The grammar and basics is very simple compared to other languages. However the pronounciation and understanding of the language is the hardest thing. Pronounciation of some English words often seems so random because it is not written phonetically. Also English is such an advanced language with so many words and slang, just take a look in the Oxford dictionary. It does depend though, I hear many people say English it is a very easy language, and others say it is very difficult<br>  <br>  So in short, English is easy to learn at first (simple grammar), but to master it is very difficult for a non-native speaker|`|NFyQWFoGaa	English is spoken in many places, so it has become the language of business.
1a42bf28fe11e609b0c68795bce43d6baa	You are confusing 2 different views of the Beginning. Jesus was a Jew, so He would be a darker color, but not black. Adam and Eve from the Bible were from the area of the Fertile Crescent, near Egypt, so they would not have been black either, but dark, like Jesus.|`|AA11364538	what does it matter?  it is usually a cultural thing as to how each culture depicts Jesus, Adam and Eve.  Most of the paintings that we are familiar with come from Europe, so they usually depict Christ as being of European desant.  Doesn't mean that is is acurate, but it is mute point, who cares what they look like.|`|PwD3slrTaa	Humans didn't "evolve" but the garden of Eden was in Iraq.  There were no ethnicities at that time, those didn't come until Genesis 9.<br>  <br>  You're right, Jesus was Jewish.  He was from Israel.  He wasn't a white guy.<br>  <br>  So- the paintings are wrong!  Very good!  You are now smarter than 86.2% of Yahoo Answers!|`|iHDYncuXaa	There weren't such pictures during the days of Adam and Eve and Jesus. The pictures you see today come from people who like to depict them as being white. They are from the Middle East, thus they are more likely of olive complexion.|`|Ynsow6qbaa	Evolved from Africa?

I think Jesus had a darker skin, (not black, but darker than Mel Gibson's for one example) others describe it as "olive skinned".<br>  <br>  On Adam & Eve, I do not know if God altered Adam's DNA in the rib He used before finishing the creation of Eve.  Which skin tone (or tones?) He gave them I have no idea.<br>  <br>  I know about the "out of Africa model" theory regarding development of human races.<br>  ---<br>  Besides that, the definition of "white" have changed many times in history.  According to our the goverment of USA (US Inmigration, Bureau of the Census, FBI, Homeland Security, other agencies) people of Middle East and some regions of North Africa are "white".  <br>  <br>  So the answer to your question is subject to the "white" definition being used:<br>  * current USA goverment definition?<br>  * KKK / White supremacist / neo nazi definition?<br>  * Oxford's dictionary definition?<br>  * any other worth mentioning?|`|mOaG5ueZaa	Humans didn't evolve from Africa. They were made of the dust of the ground, and Eve from Adam's rib (see Genesis 2). Evolution is a man-made doctrine to convince themselves that the Bible is wrong. But you are right, in that Jesus was a Jew so He shouldn't be depicted as white. Neither should Adam and Eve, they should likewise be darker skinned, like Jesus.|`|gM454VF8aa	How you know that Jesus was white and not black, or Adam and Eve were white and not black?

The "color of skin" gene (which determines the amount of melanin present in the derma) has several alleles which have co-dominance, which means that if you have an allele for black skin and one for white skin the baby will be an intermediate color. But he/she will carry alleles for both skin tonality.<br>  <br>  I can explain more in scientific terms, if you are interested.<br>  <br>  ----<br>  Skin Colour<br>  <br>  Skin colour is an excellent example of genetic control at work. Skin colour depends on the degree of melanin found in skin cells. The amount of melanin is pre-determined by the genetic blueprint of some genes in each cell. To be exact, there are two genes that control the production of melanin, each of which has a dominant and recessive expression. This leads to a possible 16 combinations of genotype when coding for skin colour, as seen below.<br>  <br>  Possible combinations of genotype coding for skin colour via melanin:<br>  <br>  Genotype<br>  1 M1M1M2M2<br>  2 M1M1M2m2<br>  3 M1M1m2m2<br>  4 M1m1m2m2<br>  5 m1m1m2m2<br>   <br>  Phenotype<br>  1 Black Skin<br>  2 Dark Brown Skin<br>  3 Brown Skin<br>  4 Light Brown Skin<br>  5 White Skin<br>  <br>  Although there are 16 possible combinations in expressing the skin phenotype, there are 5 different possible genotypes that the genes of melanin can express for, as indicated above. Each expression of melanin has an accumulating effect on skin tone, until maximum expression of melanin through 4 dominant alleles leads to a black skin phenotype.<br>  <br>  Therefore, when any person is born, they will be one of five colours. After this, external factors such as UV sunlight from the sun will change the skin colour away from the genetic expression of its initial colour.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	There were  no photographers when Jesus was alive.

The artists of these pictures paint him in ways that their culture can most easily identify with.<br>  <br>  The story of Adam and Eve in the creation stories of Genesis are allegories.  The authors of those stories never meant for them to be read as literal history.|`|0312ec6bd9788b0c6bf89b026c84d0c6aa	Jesus would have been olive-skinned which is common for the area, as for Adam and Eve we cannot really be sure on the matter, but surely the factor that decides this issue for people is how they connect and identify their Saviour with themselves,white people naturally see Jesus as white and black people see Him as as black, I doubt if Jesus is too concerned about this as He is about righteousness and fellowship.<br>  God bless.|`|6jAVElX7aa	No one know what Christ Jesus looks like except Isaiah who gave a description of Him in chapter 53.
