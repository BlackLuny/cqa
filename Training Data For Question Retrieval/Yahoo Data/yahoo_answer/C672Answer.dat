b1VlP6Wwaa	My wife and I managed to save about 7500 for our wedding. It was very nice and conservative . Our parents were tapped at the time so we really didnt expect much help. Good Question|`|QP46eVi4aa	Me and my husband paid for it we had a small church wedding at our church no reception as our honeymoon was planned before hand and so we just picked a day that we was leaving we got married at 2 and left at 2:30<br>  <br>  <br>  The whole total cost of my wedding including my 1500.00 dress was 241.00 and that was cause we went cheap and i got my dress for 50.00 at a going out of buisness sale at a dress shop live in a very small town only dress shop we had <br>  <br>  But brides family usally pays <br>  <br>  Saved the wedding money from my parents for the honeymoon was better then a big weddng anyway cause it was just us to celebrating becoming husband and wife|`|b8fac288f95255af7dc35ecaf1615256aa	My parents are paying for everything (the brides).

Neither of us has any parents, but even if we did, we would have paid for it all.|`|AW1dCzH0aa	Our wedding will end up being around $10,000.  Pretty much everyone is contributing.  My parents are divorced, so are my fiance's parents.  My dad has already given us $1500.  My mom has given us $1000.  My future SIL is paying for our DJ in lieu of getting us an engagement gift, wedding gift or bridal shower gifts.  The DJ is $650.  My future MIL is paying for the alcohol at our wedding.  It will likely end up being $1200.  The rest of it - is all on the fiance and me!  So, we'll be doing about $5650 all on our own!  I think that's very reasonable and I totally appreciate everyone helping out!|`|QmXyD7evaa	Myself and my husband. (we just had a court wedding)<br>  <br>  However, traditionally it is the bride's family that pays for most of the church/party style weddings.|`|iN27E3WCaa	I paid for the entire wedding and the honeymoon too.  Hubby is still in grad school so he wasn't any help and we didn't want to depend on our parents for anything (they gave us nice gifts after the wedding though).|`|fSR4bgHPaa	My parents (bride) paid for EVERYTHING! <br>  His parents paid for the rehearsal dinner
dFHsAXDMaa	spreading rumors about someone is about as immature as you can get and they can actually have serious effects on someones life you might not realize... as a nurse and a high school cheering coach  I have seen kids who have had rumors started about them at school by a hateful ex  or a ex friend and it got so bad and they felt so bad they actually tried to kill themselves it is worth it to ruin someones life like that and for what just to be a hateful immature jerk.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Rumours are a way to physical and emotionally hurt the person.  I really don't know why people does it except they feel like it.   I really hate when people believe it.|`|C9z5g6pVaa	i hate rumours!<br>  so many people believe everything that they hear|`|tIlGkrgqaa	Rumors<br>  <br>  hmmm. Well<br>  i know your expecting people to say <br>  "ohh there terrible!"<br>  well ill say what people really are thinking.<br>  Rumors are hurtful but when you come across one<br>  you have an instict to continue it. everyone has<br>  that instict. <br>  <br>  so yeah, rumors are bad, but when you get one<br>  you have to spread it<br>  <br>  BUT TRY TO AVOID THE SITUATION!|`|jK8xy3VUaa	They can ruin a friendship, relationship, etc, etc. Some people just do that for fun.

People that walk away from a rumor are  Leaders and Trustworthy. Usually a rumor is started on a person that is special and gifted. Therefore the person that started the rumor is envious and jealous.|`|ve1eCOKgaa	Rumors are hurtful.  They are immature way of telling someone you hate them or you don't like them. But I got use to them I've been made fun of alot, sometimes I laugh at the person who ever made it up, and think "what was this guy thinking".
Re8d6PJkaa	How about you compromise with him and have him keep the lap top in his room at night and u can only use it during the day. That way he knows when u are using it and he'll feel secure that at night your not having any crazy internet sex with some 40 year old guy claiming he's this hot 24 year old blonde with sea blue eyes.|`|E5sgD6hlaa	write the essay....explain that it is how law students (actually most students these days) take notes and research....that you are smart and responsible and plan to use it to help you learn and grow. it is the nature of the world these days, and saying no to something like technology isn't helping you, it is holding you back?|`|mirOK6Bzaa	Don't treat your dad like school. No essays. lol But tell him most people need use the computers for homework for school. Such as research for school projects and things like that. Since you need to use the computer you wouldn't think it would be fair to tie up the family computer from anyone using it. Try that and see if it works. Tell him you promise to stay out of chat rooms and not to meet people off the internet.
uT9avos5aa	I am a 28 year old male, and I think that he should still pay the $200 a month, or at least half,  as let's face it you are already heavily subsidising him.  I don't know if you get paid or not during National Guard boot camp, but if he can't afford to pay you during this time then he probably shouldn't be going.  <br>  <br>  Let's be honest, life can be tough, and keeping children in cotton wool too long can actually hurt them later on.  Budgeting, doing your share, <br>  working hard to make money, these are all essential life skills. I'm 28, and sometimes I think if my parents had indulged me less I might be a stronger person.|`|mirOK6Bzaa	I think you shouldn't charge anything. I'm 20 and still live at home. Free everything but I help out a lot around here. I want to start looking for a job and my mom just says I don't need a job. (I'm not the typical poor college student you hear stories about) But at an apartment they would keep charging him rent. But as a parent...why would you do that in the first place?|`|WPhTM74kaa	Offer a compromise. Perhaps half?|`|461411165b47f11271f6827674ccc7ddaa	But you are not a landlord you are his family and it seems unfair to make him pay full whack whjen he wont be there. <br>  What about asking him for a nominal anount for keeping his cars and stuff at your house - say $50 dollars per month - if you dont want to let him keep the stuff there fo nothing.|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	You could charge him rent, or you could support his decision to serve his country and give him a break for a few months.  With all the stress of boot camp, the last thing he needs to worry about is paying rent for a place that he is not living in.  He will not be using your utilities or eating your food while he is gone.  Is it really fair to charge him as though he is using those things?

Actually, I don't even call her my mother in law. I call her my monster in law because she is always saying she is sick for attention, she wines if my husband doesn't call her atleast once a day, she always nags me about what I'm not doing right when taking care of my child, or my house. I mean this women walked into my bathroom and came out and said "Honey, your mother must of not taught you how to clean". And the thing is I AM A GOOD MOTHER and I am a NEAT FREAK! So therefore my house is clean...ahhh she's so aggervating!<br>  <br>  And noo your defintely not alone|`|IvMPh09baa	haha.. funny.<br>  <br>  my mother in law does not speak english, and actually lives in another country (italy).  You know what they say about Italian mama... yes, well... we email each other with a translator at times, but not much to say to each other and I have only met her and my father in law once for our wedding.  We are planning to go back to Italy sometime this year, so I don't know how she will act then.  But when she was visiting for the wedding she was... well... she soso ....  she treated my husband like a little child still ALOT, folded his clothes, organized his closet, she even came over in the morning while we were both still in bed and she came into our bedroom with an espresso and kissed him EVERY morning... i was thinking, oh boy, im naked and his mama is bringing him espresso in our bed... what the hell!  where is my espresso???|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	at one time, before my husband and i married, my "future" mother in law and i bumped heads a few times. and of course it had to do with her son and my fiance. i took the high road. i sat down and talked to her, face to face, woman to woman, to assure her that we had one thing in common:  we both loved this man. i explained to her that he was a grown man, fully capable of making his own decisions and that her life was hers, and she was entitled to the right to let go. i promised her that i would 1) not bring her into any arguments and i asked her to 2) not allow her son to bring her into our arguments. after much discussion about HIM she agreed to step back and give US as chance.<br>  <br>  we have been best friends since. my husband and my relationship has continued to improve since then, because we were forced to begin to figure out how to work things out instead of him running to his mom, telling his story, and then getting biased advice based on his version, without knowing both sides (my mom passed away a few years ago so i cant do that). she has travelled all over the country since we made our pact and is retired and happy. and we are learning to respect each other more as we figure our own issues out.<br>  <br>  i love my mother in law.|`|AA11538662	I tolerate my MIL because I simply adore her son, my hubby. Her & I will NEVER see eye to eye & I feel like I have been deprived of a good relationship with her because of her past actions.

Always polite and friendly, but not even close to a friendship family anything. she is  the complete opposite of me.But since my daughters are now a little older and  she treats them wonderful. my husband and I together 20 years, it is o.k.  I lost my mother young , it would of been super nice to be close.. Actually had the best relationship with my high school sweethearts mother( was motherly, and sweet) But not the case with my mother-in-lawl. I have a lot of family and wonderful friends.. One person, should never cause us to be unhappy.. Thank her for giving you your husband,  expect nothing, and enjoy.. You are NOT alone!!!|`|krQiDGCHaa	My MIL and I do not get along well.  Well, let me rephrase.  We PRETEND to get along well.  She calls me "honey" and "sweetie" and tells me she loves me all the time, when just last summer she was saying she hated my guts and wanted me out of her life for good -- LOL.  I won't write you a book here, but lets just say there ARE some things that cannot be forgiven.  Also, she's crazy.  We've had a LOT of problems with her.<br>  <br>  They aren't as bad now, because I don't let her bother me anymore.  A friend of mine from Y/A once told me that *I* am allowing her to upset me.  I do not NEED to get upset over what she says or does.  At the time, that advice annoyed me, but now I realize how right he was.  Happy-2 -- he's a smart man. :)  Anyway, she still get one my nerves occasionally, but I try to remember this: "She can say and do whatever she wants, and try to intrude and make us do things her way.  However, My life is MY life, and she cannot run it OR my emotions unless I give her the power to."<br>  <br>  So, now I laugh it off when she says something ridiculous, rude, or overbearing.  :)<br>  <br>  OH, and a hilarious pointer for all you girls out there with Mother in Law problems.. <br>  <br>  M.I.L.D.E.W<br>  <br>  You can say you have a "Mildew" problem now when you're having MIL issues.  MILDEW stands for.. "Mothers In Law Do Everything Wrong."  HAHA!  Seriously, buy the book "M.I.L.D.E.W" -- it's AMAZINGLY FUNNY and really helped me laugh some stuff off. :)|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	I have had two mothers-in-law.  One was overbearing and the other was ok... <br>  <br>  As for the overbearing one, i ignored her, "uh huh'd" a lot, did things my own way with my kids and in my life.  My life is mine to conduct in the way i see fit, and if i needed advice, i'd have asked for it.  In other words, i did not let her rule my emotions... it wasn't worth the stress.<br>  <br>  take care.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	I can never understand this.  My MIL and I get along just fine.  Just pretend that everything she says is okay.  Trust me, it will make your life much easier.  <br>  Don't waste time on minor things my dear.  There is a lot of major things in life to enjoy.|`|3f04d9ffb6ff4f3a0291d329acc40e45aa	Now that my mother in law doesn't live with us anymore i don't have anything against her.

The reason behind this is probably because we dont talk as much so let me rephrase this; Due to the lack of communication, my mother n law and I get along very well.|`|n1Ga3kdYaa	Before she passed away, she was a very nice lady.

Re8d6PJkaa	I would say yes, but your not well planned and if you were to move out and your baby's father doesn't pay for the rent then where will you go. You can't go back to mommy and daddy after that. I would suggest that you pay your mom back when you can and take Jayden to the doctor. Try helping out at the house and keep your dad calm. Tell you baby's father to give you that rent money for other things like paying your parents for the help. Any way find a job first or apply for sec 8 housing it's really cheap for single mothers that don't have a lot of cash. Try finding a job or try going to school to study for something that will make you graduate quick and earn you more money than the typical minimum wage like a medical assistant hopefully you'll get financial aid. Please don't act on impulse, think rationally your still young and your parents will understand.|`|MXRXG62oaa	MOVE OUT i am in the same situation as you and it sucks. get outta there|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	Life sucks, but since you have no job, perhaps you should do things their way for a while.  You will need to get a job to get an apartment.  <br>  <br>  As a parent you sometimes have to do things you don't want to do for the sake of your child.  Would your child's life be better if you were to accept help from his father?  Unless he is abusive you might want to consider encouraging visitation.  It would be better for your son to know his father.|`|jQ2K7y9Haa	yes move out i have family problems to but you lucky ur old enough to move out|`|AA12006899	move next door thn use ur parents as laundry services|`|c2fb4365c45b260693539c9ad4af6fd1aa	It doesn't sound as if your option to move out is a good one. Unfortunately, until you can find a job and make your own way-completely independently- you should just suck it up and stay with your folks. I know their complaining is a pain, but guess what, It's their house! Learn to say "Yes, Ma'am" and "Yes, Sir " with a smile and keep doing what you have to until you can afford to take care of yourself and your child. Remember there is a reason you are not with your ex. He could very easily get pissy with you and stop paying the rent for you. Then you're right back where you started...plus your parents have another reason to complain.|`|hARy7nsMaa	are you rihanna?
AcgDcQG0aa	He either is too shy with you.  Or he isn't physically attracted to you.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you give him a friendly hug once in a while.  And see how he reacts to it.<br>  <br>  If he is just shy.  Then your hugging him will make it easier for him to hug you too.  And he probably will start to respond to your hugs with some hugs of his own.<br>  <br>  But if he isn't physically attracted to you.  Then your hugging him either won't change his behavior.  Or he might increase his distance away from you.<br>  <br>  If he isn't physically attracted to you.  Then you would be better off looking for another boyfriend.  Because guys don't usually change their mind about things like that.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Just flirt with him.|`|oOU6XJOqaa	If you have never done it in person...<br>  A. he does not truly love you and is only dating you b/c of lust.<br>  B. He is REALLY into you and gets nervous around you. If this is the problem, simply ask him if he gets nervous around you. If he answers no, it may be C.<br>  C. he doesn't like you and you may have to expect a break up.<br>  D. If you can't figure it out, make the first move: kiss him and tell him you love him.|`|p0QCWtYEaa	kiss, hug, and say i love you in rl life. Its that simple. I mean really|`|dNJG3EDCaa	cuz you ugly, *****|`|WbWudqUvaa	You say WE, meaning you haven't either think on that.|`|901eafc186c995cb8a7e6e8ce846775faa	You really need to be able to ask him.  If he starts acting shady or twitchy, it may be time to move on.  Don't be afraid to come right out and tell him that you are not feeling as secure in the relationship lately, and maybe it's time to redefine it (i.e, just be friends, take it to another level, etc).<br>  <br>  I have found with boys (and later, men), they are much better at true/false or multiple choice questions than essay.  So, it is better to ask direct questions.  If it doesn't work out, don't be fatally discouraged.  It is so worth it to finally find a guy who is willing and has the courage to be generous with a few details of his heart.<br>  <br>  Take Care.|`|fYXyIiVAaa	im sorry to hear that but my ex all of a sudden did that to me and i found out he was cheating on me
hid5HDqfaa	You probably wouldn't wanna do it this way, but I save being sociable for university, when it really matters. Keep talking to various people and inviting them until a couple agree to go out with you and become your friend. A couple of good friends is all you need to get by in highschool.

You should be glad he wants to hold your hand.  :)|`|w12mELoEaa	It means he likes touching you & enjoys it, he feels comfortable.|`|jpimg8doaa	Awe, maybe it helps him to concentrate.

Talk about the events you are training for.  Ask her if she ran track at her other school.  Discuss your school day and ask her about her teachers.  Just keep it friendly as you are running side by side.  Then say, "Well, it was nice talking to ya!" and take off.  Next time you get a chance, approach her and say hi again.  How is it going?  Did you watch American Idol or Lost last night?  What shows do you catch during the week?  Again, just relax and ask her questions about her life.  Then take off.

FXX3SxYJaa	Letting them go if they don't love you back. It takes true surrender and destruction of the heart to allow someone you love to follow a path that doesn't include you simply because you love them so much that you cannot see them any other way besides happy-even if that means they're with someone else and you'll be forever miserable. That's like sacrificing your life-except that you have to live with it.|`|0PdYYeBFaa	The biggest sacrifices i would do and this is just me:<br>  - Forgive my husband of pass error (humans, we all make mistakes, it is whether mistakes can change the being for the better making)<br>  - Move abroad with my husband<br>  - (Touch wood and i mean touch wood) If an accident happened to him that left him with limit ability, lost of part of his body, burns or depression i would stay by his side.<br>  <br>  So far this is what i could think of..some can call me mad...but this is how deep my love for my husband.|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	total commitment. marriage is hard and you got two people, from two different value systems coming together. it does take a lot of sacrifice:  give and take of values and belief systems to make a marriage successful. too many times people want to give up instead of commiting to becoming one.<br>  <br>  good question.|`|uTIKbS2paa	i love someone so much one year ago . since he came into my life i change mylife style my frens and alot of things. my life is just focus on him . when he came to my country i sacrifice my time , work etc etc but things didnt turn to be wat i want . he just didnt treasured me. my heart feel so much pain now and i dunno if the sacrifice i've made is worthwhile .|`|VAI6MtPIaa	Dying for someone you love or Moving to another state or country for someone.|`|jVOapeKVaa	Definitely a threesome|`|M43M4KZxaa	accept mistakes and apologize.its a big thing!|`|sOpIMeJSaa	giving that person up to someone else.|`|LxfqUaaIaa	Allowing yourself to live without them for their own good.

Especially if they carry on acknowledging that love without asking anything at all from the other party.|`|GgkMrwCiaa	The biggest sacrifice for love in almost everyone's answer is dying to protect/save their lives. For instance, say a couple were together for two years and married for five years. One of them gets severely injured or falls ill of a disorder/disease that requires a major organ transplant (heart, lungs, etc) and that their partner is a perfect match. If the choice was the affected partner's life or their's they would rather have the previous live. That is my example of a major love sacrifice.|`|znZxydq5aa	giveing everything that iz yourz to a person that you absolutly hate and u didnt even have the choich i mean being striped of your charecter, house, family, and everything that waz wonce in your name even ur personality and not even by cchoice did u give this all up 2 a person u despize and despizez u back.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	After we are dead, i'm sure we don't know the difference.<br>  <br>  There are many types of sacrifice and when we love someone, be it our spouse, children or a friend, we will be there when they need us most.

So, more realistically, I think moving from where you grew up/have family and friends to go with them to a new place/job would be a big sacrifice and it is one that many people are facing now.  That would be a complete change of your comfort zone and is a sacrifice.|`|jKdVtDx7aa	My  cousin died so others would live. He died but he will never be forgotten.

IvMPh09baa	Well, honestly... no matter how you feel about it, and no matter comfortable you can get with the idea... you wrote that you are planning to flip this house and move in a few years, so think about it this way... this house needs to be saleable to another couple/person in the next few years... there is a reason its not sold yet and its priced so low, because NOBODY wants to live next to a cemetery.  No matter what work you put into flipping this house, the location is awful and you are going to have a very hard time reselling it and potentially your plans to move in a few years could be prolonged due to this.<br>  <br>  So logically speaking, not a good idea to buy this one just because you are planning to move in a few years and resell it and the probability of it being sold is very very low.|`|89dbda5201b9cd4a4f9e174ecf63f9f7aa	I'd snap it up so fast!  What are you afraid of?  Dead people are dead.  A graveyard is only spooky if you let it be spooky.  Hide your view of it as best you can, enjoy your yard, make it look like fun, and as the foliage grows over the next several years, it'll be ready for you to sell and move on!|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Hey, ya got one thing goin' for ya - the neighbors will never complain about your noisy kids!|`|GYoNyoWtaa	It really depends on you...If you think it would become a problem...then don't do it...I know people who live right beside a graveyard and have no problems, although I never would EVER live near that!|`|8IfePMa3aa	It really comes down to what bugs you. I live across the street from a graveyard and it doesn't really bother me; it's a wonderful house with an amazing view of the ocean. I have seen some very strange things, and sometimes kids like to go around and dare each other at night, but it's really not a big deal.|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	that's probably why its so cheap.<br>  <br>  me? no way. i dont think i would want my kids wandering out to the tombstones to play...<br>  <br>  but if you all want it that much, go for it. but remember, if its such a great home and you all are buying below market value, then there are probably alot of people who would not buy it because of the neighbors...and how hard would it be to resale it if you all decided to upgrade?|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Personally, I would not purchase it if I did not plan on living there my entire life. It will be very difficult to resell. Many would be completely freaked out by the cemetery. However, I do not worry about the dead, it is those alive and walking around that we need to fear.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I think I would buy it and budget in a 7-foot wood fence.<br>  <br>  But then every night I heard strange noises downstairs, I'd be worrying about the undead burrowing into my basement!|`|cdQryr7paa	Don't even worry about it.<br>  Buy it.<br>  Who knows whether or not another opportunity like this will come along.<br>  If the cemetery bothers you, put up a fence so you can't see it.<br>  I'd grab it in a heartbeat.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	If you want the house then take it and living close to a cemetery is really no big deal at all.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	I think that it really explains why it is so cheap, and it could be an issue in the future when you plan to resell. Others will probably be just as creeped out as you are.|`|xUCXXb73aa	flip that house,Lil get real|`|ekr6BBe3aa	Wouldn't bother me a bit, but the real question is will it bother the two of you. If you have doubts so will many of the prospective buyers when you go to sell it. See if you can stay there a couple nights before you buy and if it does in fact creep you out. If the cemetary is almost full and needs to expand that may be your next buyer also.|`|Iac8nfK1aa	Well, it sounds like the reason it is so cheap is because of location. Of course that is not the only thing you go off of. If you really like the house go after it. It can lead to a really cool story after you move out.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Since i haven't any fear of cemetaries, and if i liked the home, yes i'd buy it.  <br>  <br>  You are fortunate.  Where i live, a house such as you've described here would be about $750,000 +<br>  <br>  take care and all the best of luck reselling.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	the fact of living next to a grave yard would not bother me at all.  However, I am not a flipper so I would be looking to stay for life.|`|lckgvz2laa	Personally, no I wouldn't. But if you and your husband have no qualms about it, then go ahead.|`|1fbf02e1452cd78e340d80c11af19502aa	I once worked in Real Estate and we could not sell a house across the road from a Cemetary. We couldn't even give it away so unless you are caring for those kids in your day care centre just for the hell of it (and not to get ahead) I wouldn't do it sweetie...you are too kind...consider this a gift from God to direct you to looking at another place.<br>  <br>  No I would NEVER buy it and I don't believe in ghosts or anything like that.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Do you believe in ghosts?<br>  I don't. <br>  I would not live there though.<br>  Do you believe in Heaven and Hell?<br>  My husband believes there are some things you do not do. We have kids and I would not want them to have nightmares or such.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Yes, we kinda like quiet and you can't get any more quiet in neighbors then a graveyard.  It would not bother us and would be kinda cool to just visit the graves and read the stones.
ln6m0dVoaa	Lmao. Sounds to me like he's wound a little too tight. Seriously, I honestly believe that pretty much any other guy (except a gay guy) would have responded to that, since guys are pretty much horny by nature lol. Anyway, I'm sorry to say that some people just don't know how to take a joke. Somebody needs to tell him..."It's okay to laugh once in a while! It's not that serious!" Lol.<br>  Taking all things into consideration though, I have to say that he feels awkward by it either because your younger than him (that's most likely it), or because he's just not interested. Also, are you sure he's not interested in anyone else? That might also have something to do with it.|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	....<br>  <br>  <br>  When u texted him u should've said " Tell me before next time, I'd love to join you! lol jk"<br>  <br>  U have to make it seem like a joke!|`|PLWdgGNeaa	LOL why did he get serious bout it for? And don't worry it might take some time before he lets it go and if he doesnt then forget him!! there are more people how can take jokes lol<br>  And saying that doesnt make me feel awkward i say/hear it from my girl friends and we just messing around (except my gf lol) anddd dont worry you never did nothing wrong its just him...|`|qif1TQtnaa	maybe he thinks you aren't attractive|`|CajKowXcaa	yeah that actually would make me feel awkward. Its a little over the edge, but maybe apologize to him? And talk to him a lot, try to make it blow over.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I want to help but idk how|`|eALcHp1Raa	He's gay|`|S852p6SXaa	eh just dont bring up again. he'll forget eventually.|`|CIGRQqd7aa	Well, he's 16 and you're 14.<br>  <br>  Right now at my age I would take it as a joke, a flirty joke but a joke nonetheless, I'll be 22 in May though.<br>  <br>  At his age I might take it a bit more serious, like you are turned on by him and you would like to sleep with him.<br>  <br>  Would it feel awkward? Kind of, but not uncomfortable, it would be a bit cruel if you have absolutely no interest in him, but now he's probably going to think that you do.|`|rb65dlmdaa	i am sorry but it sounds like he likes boys|`|36Tlzwnpaa	haha it's a little weird.<br>  <br>  guys have said that to me.. but they're my friends, and yeah,, they're joking...<br>  <br>  its a little awkward with the age difference as well.<br>  but its more awkward because you like him. so treat the situation like he's just a friend. be like, i'm a freshman, i thought it was funny, ur a junior thought by then you'd understand. or something like that|`|MXGFGBtZaa	It obviously just made him uncomfortable. It was quite a forward thing to say, even though it was just a joke. He'll forget it soon...don't worry about it. If he holds on to it, he's the one with the problem.|`|V8L1OhH5aa	He sounds extremely awkward. Just let him go...|`|IkAtIQumaa	Any other guy would have made a sexual remark , maybe he is not attracted to you sexually.|`|qkWmI8W9aa	First of all, thanks for answering my question. And it was really supposed to be a joke and he should've got it as a joke also...|`|GBvaDCxAaa	well u asked me ta answer so um let go maybe 1 month or he may try to hav sex wit u watch out|`|4SWvHCzfaa	well he might feel awkward because your a freshman and hes a junior but i wouldn't think it would take him long to let it go. It was really awkward for me and my boyfriend in the beginning to joke around because im a freshman and hes a senior. At times its still uncomfortable but we've been together for 6 months. I would say you shouldn't worry about it and he will start to be the same again eventually. It shouldn't take too long though.|`|AA11088786	Not really. Since the girl I like does that to me very often and I see it as a playful flirt/joke. I know she really does want to do those things, but is waiting for my reaction. Usually though, when I flirt over texting to my girl, I put a smiley so that they know it's a joke. If it said, "Tell me before next time, I'd love to join you. =) haha.". Then he would've been like, "Oh, haha, funny joke!".|`|oT6er7BOaa	That means he is stupid and that he can't take a joke. If he keeps being like this just move on girl!|`|UebWhbD6aa	why don't u kneel down and beg on til he forgives u!|`|64guaxaPaa	their is no reason for him not to let it go, it's really not a big deal at all. he's the only 16year old guy i can think of who would actually be offended by that..haha bake him a pie and apologize if he's gonna still be upset about nothing.|`|YYdtd47baa	could he be gay? most guys I know would jump if a girl said that! they would not address it in the way that your friend did...they'd be discouraged that they didn't let me know sooner.. he sounds like he might not be interested in girls - or he doesnt find you attractive.<br>  izy|`|0OpKpEbEaa	Uhh, he's 16 and you're 14.  Maybe that's what he finds wrong.  I'd feel awkward, too.  A lot of people don't like to joke about things that could get them thrown into jail.|`|IdKUf5WGaa	I think he just took it the wrong way.<br>  If he doesnt get over it soon, then he's just wierd.<br>  And It would have made me feel a little ackward but I would have known it was a joke.<br>  Hope I helped :)|`|cMPVyFiXaa	well you did mention your close friends maybe he felt uncomfortable <br>  at having a friend sending him somthing like that.<br>  don't worry he will get over it<br>  <br>  and by the way dont reveal you like him just yet that will make him more uncomfortable then he is|`|yJ3IaT4Gaa	I know you were just being silly but with guys you just can not joke like that, anything to do with sex they take VERY seriously. Just don't mention it again and I bet he's already forgotten.|`|FY5FwWzsaa	hmmm, i don't know. maybe he just didn't get it at first. or maybe it kinda scared him, which is weird for a guy! lol<br>  you guys are both really young... maybe that's why he was acting awkward.. tough one|`|ZzTJ1A3Baa	lol,that's funny,it will happen naturally|`|ep74N9Wpaa	I think anyone would feel awkward if someone said that to them.|`|4ZpFIfieaa	I'm a guy and we feel kinda offended when girls say that sometimes.  Idk why we just do.<br>  <br>  If you pick me as your best answer ill put you as mine!|`|4StO2m0iaa	get somebody ur own age.|`|CQxVZkDPaa	if you dont pay attention to him he might let it go|`|7f8EVUn5aa	ahhh.<br>  well from what i kno, guys take sex extremely seriously.  so when you said that he probably got all freaked.  like maybe he doesn't like you but he was like, omg she does oh god what now.  or maybe he does like you and was happy you said that but when you said it was a joke, now he's like what the ****.<br>  <br>  do you know what i mean? either way, he took it seriously.<br>  that's a very flirty thing to say if it was a joke.|`|6U25bcWBaa	hmm, well if he didnt already get the joke in that, them tell him clearly.<br>  Or, maybe he thinks that you like him and he doesnt like you that way thats why he might be disturbed by that message.<br>  <br>  And yes, it would make me feel awkward if the girl wasn't my girlfriend.<br>  (this, to me, is like hinting... maybe he thought the same?)|`|ElvVcdcgaa	ok do this:<br>  <br>  NEVER mention it again! enless he brings it up....<br>  always change the subject if he does bring it up though!<br>  act all sad about it if u can't change it!<br>  <br>  thats what u do!|`|2GI2VWqyaa	He won't forget - you just put the image of your naked wet body into his brain. Time may pass, and the image may get hazy... but he won't forget. Just put it behind you, continue to be his friend, and don't flirt with him anymore. Let this crush go. I think his weirdness and awkwardness shows that he's not into you that way and can't handle friendly flirting otherwise, so it's best left alone. Or, here's a thought... maybe he's crushing on you too, and that's what caused the awkwardness... and now you just let your opportunity slide away by saying "oh, that was just a joke".<br>  <br>  BTW, what the hell is a 14 year old girl doing "joking" about taking a shower with a dude for? No matter how much fun sex may be, that's not a joke honey... please be responsible and make sure you're emotionally and physically ready for what sex can bring before you throw it out there like that. It's not like the movies show you.|`|iko1uqBnaa	He probably feels uncomfortable because he doesn't think of you that way I would suggest treating him the way you always do and don't mention anything sexual between the two of you again and he will eventually get over it.|`|J3TTiF4Haa	oooppps bout that.<br>  the issue is maybe he likes u but wud wonder why of all things u wud come up with that line which is way beyond a crush he wud doubt ur intentions.<br>  so it wud make him feel unconfortable.<br>  he will let go but if u really nid him just tell him how hemakes u feel|`|w9i1Gax6aa	maybe try to start a relationship with another kind of person? somebody who fits your personality best!|`|Feu5DYe6aa	You're 14, you shouldn't be talking like that. Maybe he was a little shocked. It kind of sounds like he doesn't like you. Sorry hun. At least you tried.
2C2WY3H1aa	You can have your dreams, grow up, THEN make the decision.  It's something to shoot for, though.  You just need to have a plan, and put the plan into action.  Parents/siblings/relatives NEVER want us to leave.  But we all must do what makes us happy.  Hope your plans work out, missy!  Good luck.  By the way, I grew up in Europe, and I STILL miss it desperately.  I know what you mean by feeling at home there.|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	Start much simpler.

You may not have the same freedoms and rights there that you do here.  Depending on your situation, that may be a big deal.|`|mirOK6Bzaa	You can always plan, wish, and hope for the future.

2C2WY3H1aa	5'4", 110 lbs?  Well, you're NOT fat, but if you want to lose the 5 lbs due to medical reasons because of your diabetes, then lose it.  If it's because of your parents, to heck with what THEY think.  I am only looking at the medical aspect of this.  What do you snack on?  Is it carbs/sugar all the time?  Try fruits, they taste great and satisfy that sweet tooth.  Drink a lot of water, because water promotes weight loss.  If you want to feel full, eat a banana, and drink 16 oz. of water with it.  You can always snack on healthy things instead of the unhealthy ones.|`|13f8355359652cfde88b26bd8b3d6c6caa	Are you serious?  You are already quite thin.

What might be a good thing is look into local gyms that have pilates classes, find a flexible one to try it out. It focuses on core strength and will tone your muscles giving your arms and legs a sleeker look.<br>  Aside from that, just take a look at what you eat, and what things that you eat that tend to trigger more hunger, try to plan ahead for particular snacks that you will have at hand that are better than the ones that trigger your hunger.|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	Tell them that you need a treadmill to maintain your proper exercise level.

They probably don't think your fat but they don't want you to die so they tell you ur fat so u don't feel the need to eat. Honestly if you have diabetes and your parents tell you please stop, you've had to much your gonna be like "WHAT? HELL NAH THIS IS GOOD" but if they're like hey your gaining weight you'll be like " maybe i should stop i don't want to hear my parents b***h"
yjyBbVJoaa	I think that you should talk to your mum and come to an arrangement eg. how much time and when. Show her how much school work you are doing and the books you are reading. Of course you should't give up. Your mum let you get it. Maybe try to involve her in a couple of games too it makes it more fun!  No problem is too big if you talk honestly to each other. Good luck. Also tell her how you feel.|`|rwBh07Ncaa	Compromise with her. Make an official schedule and record when you are on Xbox. Keep the Xbox in a public room so she can know when you're playing.
RO5fRyIvaa	Don't force yourself to date him. If i were you, I'd get to know him more. You need to see if he has that capacity to be serious, because if he doesn't and you date him, you're only setting yourself up for unhappiness.|`|A6LNyBUtaa	I think you should try it out.<br>  Maybe when he's with a small group or just you he will mellow down.<br>  Hysterical boys can be good because they can make you laugh but can be bad because if you wanna be serious and have some sort of conversation.. it might be difficult if hes always joking around...|`|hPNgeU2saa	try out and see<br>  <br>  answer mine<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307173247AAtaXUc&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Well, it is important for a guy who have a great sense of humour, but they are some times that he needs to be serious such as his schoolwork and someone who would be there when you have a life problem.  You don't want a guy who doesn't take everything seriously and his life as well.|`|cOqVGdL8aa	I would try dating him. But don't get to serious about it. Try him out and see if he takes situations serious that he needs to. If hes around a bunch of people and everyone is in a serious mood and hes the only one laughing that's a bad sign. People like that can get annoying if they don't take life seriously. But he may just have a good attitude and when it comes to serious situations he's not serious.|`|O7xYvttsaa	ugh. funny guys are great and all, but not boyfriend material. at least not for me. <br>  i need someone who i can talk to. i love when a guy can make me laugh and tell me funny stories, but i can't stand it when a guy makes a joke out of everything. it's like, immaturity in my eyes.|`|0Yqjaj15aa	you should still try it out you never know who he really can be like.Maybe that is his way of being flirty and outgoing.Alot of "hysterical" boys can be very sensative and serious too Give it a shot whats the worst that can happend?<br>  good luck!=)|`|69qn7muFaa	Just try it out. <br>  Everyone has a little bit of serious in him..

Maybe that is his way of dealing with being around you. I had a friend in high school that dated a guy and I was pretty sure the guy believed he was Jim Carey...which was fun, but not all the time, and when she talked to him about it, he told her it was the only way he could think to see her smile. He was a great guy, just needed to tone it down some. Maybe if you talk to him he will do the same for you. :-)|`|9d312c80f895f20c08272dd2fd60c61aaa	he could be serious, he just sounds confident to me, which is good.  just because he's funny doesn't mean he doesn't have other personalities.  i would go out with him if i were you, your not marrying the guy, if you go out for a couple of weeks and it doesn't work out, so what?  at least you never have to say "what if"  :)|`|we8adFNkaa	their good trust me. I thought the same thing about my friend donovan. he is one of those guys constanly making your mom jokes and laughing at pretty much everything.

BBZ9VTxWaa	Firstly, you are young and that means - you have a lot on your side, including government! <br>  <br>  Number one, we do not choose who we have as family. However, we do get to choose what we do with that family. you can get away. its hard - i cannot even begin to imagine how you must feel, but i have had friends who suffered same things which me and my family sheltered until they got a good home. <br>  <br>  Number 2, does your mother know what is going on? Is she aware of the things that you go through and if so can she prevent it? or is she not helping? <br>  <br>  Number three, the police would take your brother and father into custody, would get you to a nice and safe place, if you prefer they can take you to your mum. On top of that your brother and father will be issued a warrant to stay away from you and also, they will be taken to court and prosecuted under assault, if you press charges... <br>  <br>  The police will help hun. it is what they are there for. Trust yourself - you do not have to live like that.|`|Mw8RehZOaa	no, its not a family tiff its abuse. women leave marriages like this every day, what makes u think you have less right to be takn seriously than them?<br>  <br>  if you can try and take a viseo on ur fone of this happening as evidence but my sugestion to u is to go to ur doc, explaint he situation, ask for help and try and speak to a family member u trust. stay with them if you can and try and get outa ur house before something worse happens|`|WO5O1UFiaa	First you should tell the police, they are not just going to ignore it is their job to help people. then you should move in with your mom, your old enough to get a job so you can help your mom out|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Call Child Protective Services (or whatever it is called in glasgow).

Your brother has a serious  problem and he will  continue to treat you and other women like this and I bet it just keeps progressing.<br>  Someday your brother may not stop and someone could end up dead.<br>  <br>  I am sorry you have endure this abuse for so long. <br>  Do other friends or family members know this is happening?  Does your mom?  Your mom may not earn much and you might not like where she lives right now, those things can change in time. You can not change death or erase this type of mental and emotion abuse you are enduring.<br>  Good Luck..I will keep you in my prayers.|`|9Duha1k4aa	You need to tell someone, phone your mum or something. The police will do something about it, have more faith in them. Furthermore, for someone to just talk to, you can phone childline at 0800 1111.<br>  <br>  This classes as abuse, do you know that? You could even tell your teacher, surely they would've noticed your fat lip. Or, you can stay with your friends for a few days and ask her for help. Either way, you cannot stay with them any longer, because if you do, matters will get worse.|`|J5zqZp7Qaa	I can GUARANTEE you that the police will not blow it off. Please find the courage to get outside help... do call the police. You might not like where your mum lives or how much she earns, but you will be happier and safer there.

It'll worsen the situation. Talk to her & say sorry. Ask for her help in taking you out of this awkwardness & not ***** about it. Quite possible that (concerning your age) she is paniced & worried about you & asking for suggestions and help from different people on how should she deal with this. Thats why all of them know about it. You have to understand that she herself might be in the same kind of delimna. She might be feeling shy in facing you after she saw you in the act with your bf. Go talk her & give comfort to each other. If she loves you then she'll listen & understand & forgive you.|`|etNVFqUcaa	you and your bf should go to your house and talk to your mother because you had sex because you wanted to you maybe should have tgold your mother but it is to late now she is your mother and loves you even if she doesn't think you always make the right choices. forget about her telling your friends and family if they are so talkitive about that then they need their own sex lives to talk about.|`|AA11829392	Go home... talk to her.

Where are the parents in this episode?  She will be upset now but later will thank you for it.   To ignore it will not be the best thing.  you will hear others say that she might want to experiment but if it was a gun, would you let her experiment with it?  Hell, No!  It is a drug.  Remember.

jpimg8doaa	that should not piss you off.  There are weird people everywhere and it is their loss that they make asses of themselves.  I would have made it clear in front of your guy that they were doing this.  He probably sensed it and wondered why you didn't say anything to him.  Be honest with him about what is happening.  Then they will really look like asses.  Let him defend you.  Give him that chance.|`|9e3mxs6waa	More power to you<br>  that's going to happen any where you go<br>  people are narrow minded and think it's wrong<br>  but as long as you love him and he loves you ,sweety you have a beautiful thing.....and they're all jealous! :)|`|6EWvW3Kiaa	if you love him as much as you say u do why are u caring what other ppl think and say just ignore them. i know easier said then done but i dont feel it should be bothering u this much if u love him as much as u say you do|`|KR6pBFLVaa	Awwh, I think it's cute... does he need the cane in bed- thats a bonus I would say!!!|`|93r3nCM1aa	One time I went out with my fiance (now husband) to this coffee place and he had a cold so he was acting a bit out of it, and I asked him if he would get me a napkin and he kinda looked around all confused and I had to point to where the napkins were, and I put the lid on his coffee cup just to be nice and all that stuff.<br>  <br>  But I guess from an outsiders perspective it looked like he was retarted or something because I ran into my ex-bf's sister and when I was talking to my ex later that night (telling him I saw his sister and all that) he said "oh ya...abby wants to know who that special needs guy was that you were with. He looked like an incompetent moron."<br>  <br>  Oh believe me...I was PISSED! I can laugh about it now, but at the time I was livid.<br>  <br>  That doesn't really have anything to do with your situation, since your bf is actually blind (whereas mine wasn't actually special needs), but who really cares what other people think?<br>  <br>  They don't know you, they don't him...and if they really think that him being blind means that he can't have a gf, then they need to just go get over themselves. <br>  <br>  Next time people say mean stuff say "he may not have sight, but you don't have a brain."|`|RPVl5jvIaa	I had a stroke when I was 6 and a half. I'm now 21. I have been dating my bf since I was 18. Most of them stare, most of them mutter things, some of them stay away, and nearly none of them ask. I ignore them and so does my bf. I'm sure it bothers him sometimes as it does my family and me. He can't help being blind and you can't change it. Say something like leave me alone to the jackass and ignore everything else. You love him so that's all that matters and f**k anyone who says anything otherwise. You guys don't adapt to them, you let them adapt to you.<br>  <br>  Ignorance is the biggest disability
Zc8MvCp8aa	first try not to make lizzie mad b/c that would be ugly. u need to just ignore her and make some space. make some other friends and when she wants to be friends again remind her that she hadnt been treating u right. dont tell her you read her journal. and maybe u guys shouldnt even be friends and after you get away from her youll see that. hope i helped. : D|`|HT1ar9m4aa	Halle, maybe the old invite is gone and she needs time by herself. Some people get tired of their own existence or even get bored with the people their around all of the time. Its not you so don't think that you are the problem. As far as letting you read what she was writing in her journal, that was on purpose and sooner or later or years from now she may pick it up and read what she wrote and regret what she said and did that day that started your relationship on the fast downhill slide. Everyone goes through different phases in their lives and you will too. But as you grow, don't forget the times you had with your friends, the memories are just as good as the picture albums you only take out once in a while. As far as what to do, go on with your life and keep making new friends as you grow into adulthood. After high school everything changes, like me, I haven't seen nor heard from anyone but my best friend since 4th grade to graduation and a few years beyond. she's married to a good man and have two great boys. I hope you can have that kind of life and I hope I have helped you.    Julie|`|Q0HEpw3jaa	Oh wow. I'm so sorry that you had to find out like that. Please ditch her. Find some new friends. It sounds as if she has her own issues and that she's trying to make herself feel better by writing nasty things about the person that she is jealous of.  Try to ignore her and if she asks why just tell her the truth. If she tries to cover anything or gloss over the truth just tell her it's ok and go off and find some new friends. You're better than that and you don't deserve to be treated that way.|`|lF3ME5Kgaa	U should tell her that it is just a bad habit of not walking in a straight line.

If she intimidates you or is dishonest with how she feels about you, she is not your friend - you are just someone she is using (for what reason, only she knows).<br>  <br>  Do not continue in a relationship that makes you feel that you are beneath someone.  If what you are saying is true, I would move on, or use it as an opportunity to let her know how you feel, and ask her to have the courage to do the same.  It doesn't sound like she knows much about being a true friend.|`|fYXyIiVAaa	tell her you thought she was writeing u back so u peered over her shoulder to read it so she didnt have to hand u the note and risk getting caught and say by time you figured out it wasnt the note it was to late and ask why she wrote such hatefull things about you cause you thought yall were friends<br>  <br>  i hope i helped and sorry to hear you have a 2faced friend i had some of those and i chose to put them out my life and now it is much better without all the drama|`|1a195e834f21aad260c9607f401e83c4aa	A TRUE friend who never do that, find new ones who care =) and treat you as a friend should.|`|3kCmqrnzaa	Even if you are afraid do it<br>  Cause if you don't do it soon god forbid but maybe other people would c the book & start calling you a lesbian & you don't want that<br>  Ask her why she would do something like that 2 you if you guys were best friends<br>  Apologize 2 her for going through her stuff<br>  & ask her 2 rip the page out & throw it in the garabage<br>  Tell her your not a lesbian & what she put hurt your feelings a lot

jK5qZ1zDaa	As a junior in high school i know what i look for in a girl. First of all the only guys that look for Huge Breasts and Sex Drive is boys who want to hook up and move on (thats how i was when i was a freshmen, immature really) but what i look for when im looking for a relationship is somebody who can hold up a conversation and isnt a complete ditz, I look for a girl who isnt afraid to say what she's thinking but shes also not a B**** and disrespectful. Pretty much just a girl i can be around have fun with, enjoy their company and they enjoy mine back...

She has a high temperate and an untold pain. In this circumstance, I badly need a 30 minute extra break before my lunch time. I have to go to home and make sure everything is okay. It will take all east 40 minutes to get there and back. I will get only 20 minutes to look after her. So, please grant me an extra 30 minutes. She really needs my assistance.<br>  <br>  <br>  Thank you,<br>  <br>  <br>  Julia<br>  <br>  <br>  (dont forget to sign your name)
dFHsAXDMaa	No do not mail it to her is it possible for you to have a face to face conversation with her... if not talk to her on the phone and have the conversation... I am telling you this as a nurse who has worked with emotionally and physically abused kids for years... you will not feel at peace and be able to let it go unless you talk it out with her and are able to hear her reaction.. she is your mother.. it will hurt her to know the extent of it but she needs to face it as well especially if she is still with him.. because you are her daughter and you deserve to have a relationship with her but she needs to know it can not include him and why in can not..and you need to do this not only for yourself but for any other kids he may come into contact with as well say cousins that way your mother can make sure he is not alone with them.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Yes, you should tell your mother right now so that she can see what a terrible guy he is.|`|XqHPQIOtaa	U should go 2 the ****** police!!!! and ur mom 2|`|3kCmqrnzaa	Well he should b confronted because what he did was wrong & your mom doesn't deserve someone like that<br>  Tell your mom in person without him around<br>  Then when she confronts him go with her just in case & if he gets realy mad then take your mom 2 your house & let her stay there<br>  If you live way 1 far from her & you can't c her in person then tell her 2 call the cops before confronting him so they are there with her & nothing happens <br>  Tell her 2 go 2 a close relatives house or a friends house & stay there because you don't want him 2 hurt her even if she thinks she will be safe|`|jK8xy3VUaa	Maybe not the whole personal journal but you could call her, and make sure he isn't around. You can write a letter to her. I am so sorry what has happened to you. I hope you are getting better by the minute. You are brave for wanting to write a letter, and I think it is a good idea. But just call her, because you never know if he reads it. But you can talk to her (face-to-face or by phone). You can talk to me anytime. Hope this helps and good luck. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ~ needsadvice|`|1a195e834f21aad260c9607f401e83c4aa	Aww I am so sorry to hear this I been looking at videos of those who go through same in one my modules this term. That's so sad. Maybe you should not send your journal but have some private time away somewhere where you can tell your mum and show her the journals. She does need to know what your step dad has done to you. This must be so difficult to go through and I hope your able to heal emotionally soon and have a much happier life from now. I think I will do my presentation on this type of abuse and essay. All the best *huggles*|`|WHNqkraGaa	Yes you should deffinatly tell her! I know it will be hard to tell her because she is still with him. And it might actually be a good idea to see her face to face privately and show her your journal and tell her what you have been going through, I think if she sees you talking about it and letting her really see your emotion she will understand. If not at the very least send her your journal. It would also be good to tell her about your fears of your step dad hurting her so that she can think about the right moment to confront him.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK! I will pray for you and your moms safety|`|yw7AeZn2aa	I hope you are getting some help from a doctor- I wouldnt do this unless you have a drs help- you might need to get yourself a bit stronger first before taking on your mom- especially if you are not sure she believes you. <br>  <br>  Your number 1 obligation is to yourself and getting stronger.  Hang in there|`|DjuTSbeqaa	It's a good idea. Your step-dad is a sick man, and should be in prison. Tell your mom how you feel, and she has a choice to make. You are her daughter, and you should come first. She probably believes you, and i'll pray you get better.|`|KBFOaEMJaa	you are pregnant you mean by your stepfather? if yes, you must tell your mother definitely and  to some authority for dna test!|`|XGYjygdraa	Tell her good luck so much I will be praying for you and her|`|8JcuKJ6Zaa	yes you should tell her and u should send him to jail!|`|901eafc186c995cb8a7e6e8ce846775faa	Before you take any action, you need to get treatment for your trauma if you have not already.  A counselor can guide you through the steps of your recovery and also help you to include everything you need to say when you confront your mother and stepfather, which you will need to do.  Remember that this will be traumatic for your mother as well, and she, too, will need couseling.   A good counselor can even help you through a psychodrama (not what it sounds like), so that you may practice and try to get a feel for what it might be like to confront your parents.  You should do this in person.  With help, you will have this strength.  There was disparity of power btwn you and your stepfather, and he exploited this for his own gratification.  You need to look him in the eye and let him know that you see that.  You need to take back your power this way.<br>  <br>  It's a lot of pressure, but the way that you and everyone in your generation handles this kind of trauma paves the way for future little girls and boys who do not have to be victims to this kind of bullshit.  <br>  <br>  Important question - are there any other minors in the house?  Is he abusive to your mom?  Is there any reason that anyone at this very moment is in danger?  If not, take time for your own recovery.  Become involved with a group that uses the 12 steps for recovery.<br>  <br>  Take Care.  Feel whole.
fuia2Z6Maa	no idea sorry :(
MXGFGBtZaa	That's unfortunate...I'm your age and know exactly what you mean about people making assumptions about your feelings because of your age. Guys do weird things. Really unexplainable things. But you get girls who want to gradually build a strong friendship with a guy they get into...and wait for the romantic beginning of a loving relationship. Some girls want it straight away. Now. They meet them, say "i'm really into you. Let's go out" and the guy thinks "why not?" <br>  It doesn't mean he doesn't care about you. If he started a relationship with someone he really didn't know, there's a high chance he'll realize it was a mistake jumping into it so soon. With any luck, she won't look anything like her pretty pictures in real life. Good luck.|`|comuT2fkaa	oh my gosh! i was in this same situation.<br>  i know how it feels and all the questions that buzz<br>  through your mind about it.|`|IkAtIQumaa	Um no if I thought we were close, we were! lol simple as that.|`|V8L1OhH5aa	You'll probaby always be there. He's thinknig he 'll get to go out with this chick, and when they break up go out with you.|`|rNUB8B6Vaa	i think maybe he saw you as only a friend. maybe he didnt have the balls to tell you. you never really never know. guys are weird|`|5AYEWCdTaa	While I do admit I usually ignore the kids on here, you are in the minority of 15 year olds who actually need some advice.  Most of them are OMG I'm like 12 years ols and haven't been kissed, am I doomed to be a cat lady!I haven't been kissed but that is another story,<br>  <br>  I think I know what he is thinking.  I think he does like you a lot but is afraid to go out with you because he cares about you too much.  He is nervous that if you didn't see him that way it would destroy the friendship.  Just stay good friends with him.  Don't try to break them up of course, becasue that can be petty and will hurt you in the long run.  When they break  up, which i am sure they will, probably withen a couple years let him know how you feel.|`|5itFktgLaa	By the way, most  people who post here are under 15, so i think you've asked your question at the right place. Of course im the exception (21).<br>  <br>  I think i'm a lot like that guy, at high school my prob was that I got a lot of attention from a few girls at once, often. Some of the other girls who liked me (one in particular) got a bit b***** and i didn't really understand why back then.<br>  <br>  What you've got to realize is that most guys your age are immature and inexperienced. He probably did like you, but did you ever give him any obvious hints that you liked him? If you didn't, well, he may very well have been contemplating asking you out, but without a green light/hint from you, it just won't happen a lot of the time(it could, true, but its unlikely).<br>  <br>  Look, best advice is: you had a bit of a crush on him, now you're jealous of this new girl. It happens. Accept it and move on. Hey, who knows? Maybe it doesn't work out between them and you'll get another chance to tell him how you feel about him.<br>  <br>  Regardless, i'm assuming you new to Yahoo answers, so i'd just like to say mature, linguistic minded people are always welcome here, so, welcome!|`|9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	you do seem pretty mature. kudos.<br>  <br>  to get to your problem, though, it seems like there probably was something going on between the two of you but, for whatever reason (I imagine you're probably both somewhat responsible), things didn't advance.  So, when this other chick came around and that advanced more quickly, he just hopped onto that train.  so, it doesn't necessarily mean that he's that much more interested in her than you (although it could), it's probably just an unfortunate situation.<br>  <br>  Given your age, though, the relationship probably won't last very long.  So, my advice is to try to keep the line of contact open between the two of you, and if he breaks up with his girlfriend in the near future, try to advance things a little more next time.<br>  <br>  if you get a chance, take a look at my conundrum: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Av4E2bRZjDyzTxyqWvP1qXbty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307170204AACzK40">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|9d312c80f895f20c08272dd2fd60c61aaa	well, for starters, you don't sound that mature.  people used to think i was 17 at the age of 14,  and you sound pretty 15ish to me.  sorry, just making a point.  this question sounds like your 15.  anyhow...<br>  <br>  it's probably like that because you were talking more as friends rather than flirting, and you never mentioned that you or him ever made a move, so i'm gonna assume you didn't.  this girl he's going out with probably wasn't talking about broad topics when they were talking, they were probably talking more about themselves, their likes, their disslikes, rather than opinions.<br>  <br>  i don't really know what your question is rather than you wanted to vent and the internet seemed like a fine place to do that.<br>  <br>  try and fix this as much as you can, tell him how you feel about this if you can talk to him so much.|`|Xa7TaXDRaa	im a guy, so ill tell you exactly what happened.  he started hanging out with you and he enjoyed being around you because youre interesting to him.  you always acted like nothing more than a good friend and he never put a lot of thought into it (idk maybe you just dont dress slutty, which is good actually).  then some other girl he knew seemed to show a different side to him, a side that he could easily imagine kissing, and one that made his hormones flow a little.  guys have souls too, but our actions are based around our hormones until were about 40, so you have to do your best to see the person behind the hormones.  anyway, he started dating her because it seemed like a good idea at the time.  BUT (i dont really know this guy so i could be a little off) he might like you in THAT way but could be intimidated by a close friendly relationship and doesnt want to admit it, or maybe he doesnt think about that at all.  the good news for you is, youre young and now is the time to build friendships, not intimate relationships, and you will be friends for a long time, which will probably lead to wanting each other in a different way.  it just happens with time, all you need is that friendly love in the beginning, then it turns into other things and one day you will both realize it.  WARNING:  if you really like him that way you should admit it to him before he gets into a serious relationship because you never did.  just get the nerve to do it, and you will not regret the results, i promise.  also, dont forget that if you become very good friends, you must make sure that a relationship doesnt ruin a great friendship, and if you decide to go for it, make sure that it will be worth it.  either way, you should tell him you like him, or hint some one-on-one time here and there, maybe he'll get a clue.  if not, tell him straight out.  there ya go...sorry for the wall of text!|`|se3EnpZqaa	well tragic u have two definite choices..<br>  1. move on...u r 15. theres plenty of fish in the sea for u. i know it'll be hard at first but u'll get over him. trust me <br>  2. u can wait for him to break up with her, but that'll just show how desperate u r for him (which is a huge NO NO) that and who knows how long they'll stay together. <br>  If i was you hun, i'd pick the first choice its healthier for ur heart. <br>  whatever u chose just dont try breaking them up, not only will u lose his trust in u as a friend but he might never think of u that way if u do.|`|vU3IMRIIaa	For all those months did you ever tell him how you felt about him? Maybe he needed to know. Sometimes guys aren't able to make the first move, so they think girls can read minds and expect us to do what they want....dumba$$es!! I would stay friends with him, if he really likes you he will be back, and you will know what to do then and how to do it. Don't be so hard on yourself...Keep your head up and your smile on your face...it will all come out in the wash....it always does! :-)|`|coQ3EPTbaa	well, id much rather be able to talk to someone more than look at someone. if its a girl thats fun, id be with that. thats all i can say really.|`|35nxJsdbaa	I totally understand where you're coming from, but from experience I can tell you that you should move on and forget about him.  Either it will drive him crazy and he'll realize what he's missing out on or you'll find someone better than him.  Even if you two would ever get together your relationship would be strained just by this event alone.  You're fifteen.  Trust me he's not worth it.|`|JpjwUfBTaa	Hey, I'm a guy - 18. Sorry, but he just doesn't think of you as girlfriend material. Looks aren't everything, but they do play a pretty big role. If he talked to you that much, but never made a move, either he's extremely shy about having relationships (which obviously isn't the case, considering he dated that girl after only 4 days) or you've managed to fall into the "friend" category. You should just be having a good time at your age rather than getting really attached. I know that can be hard at times, but trust me, guys don't know what they want at your age, so you can't blame him entirely. Being in the friend category isn't a bad thing - you really should be glad to have that good of a friend - but if you want to get out, you should just tell him how you feel. Because his views aren't going to change unless you give him a reason to. Don't be hard on yourself if it doesn't work out though, it's not a big deal this early in your life. Hope I helped.|`|cOqVGdL8aa	Well yeah that sucks but what's your question exactly? Everyone has felt like the unimportant one at some point..|`|TJiGs8S4aa	You are overthinking this.  There could be lots of reasons that he chooses to date her and not you.  Maybe he is older.  Maybe she is older.  Maybe he just feels friendly like a sibling to you, not romantic.  Maybe he thinks you are over-dramatic and over-think things way, way way too much, and he found it maddening to be around. <br>  <br>  And please do yourself  and the rest of humankind a favor - it makes me want to scream when I read commenter after commenter expressing angst over the relative merits of their prettiness compared to the level of attractiveness of some rival, real or imagined. Beauty is, as they say, in the eye of the beholder, and beyond that, a person's overall attractiveness is not just in their physical appearance, but also in their manner and attitude and how they treat other people.  Dating is not a beauty contest, so please drop the obsession with appearance.
FiCl71flaa	While I understand and sympathize with your continuing love for your ex, I believe that it is time for you to move on. It has been more than 5months since she broke up with you, refused to  take you back, and in spite of it being valentine's day  and agreeing to be your valentine, she still refused to take you back. It appears that she is trying to let you down gently without resorting to drastic measures  but it is over and done with. You have only two options left open to you-continue to remain her friend ,  if you can handle not being her boyfriend or walk away and lose the friendship. I wish you the best.|`|S852p6SXaa	drop her. find another girl, you can and you will.|`|lK3TXGBOaa	aaawwww thats sooo cute.... but why did she brake up with you...? did you do something maybe she doesnt want to get hurt.....<br>  <br>  can you please answer mine...<br>  <br>  go to my profile under my questions and its the first one that says  <br>  <br>  " HELP!! need advice......."<br>  <br>  i would gladly appreciate it<br>  <br>  thanx :)|`|3l7IkyX4aa	Forget her man<br>  go out with her best friend|`|1ba96d5712bb7b62869d2c341295e4b7aa	u had to have done something wrong for her to break up with u.. just give it up already.... let her go|`|1Lo34oEDaa	maybe its something your doing|`|ZzPD423paa	Mike,<br>  <br>  She is just playing with your emotions.  I have to agree with your other Yahoo answer--you really should move on.  Somewhere there is another person just as sweet and lovely.  You just have to open your eyes and heart and you will see who I mean.....Oh, and don't ask her to be anything else....forget about her for awhile if possible.|`|oXDlzp2qaa	i agree move on! women are funny and i know what she's doing!! she didnt have anyone else to take her out on the day for "lovers" so she just settled for you! she probably needs a swift kick and tough love just move on...us women dont like it when attention is given to another women of interest!|`|vU3IMRIIaa	Maybe you are coming on to strong for her. Take it slow, if you are a good guy you will respect her wishes and leave it alone. Maybe she needs to play the Field for a few to see what she really wants. Patience is a virtue, keep that in mind! :-)|`|V8L1OhH5aa	just move on. shes not worth it.|`|v8Xr0Mn9aa	she just wanted a gift. maybe she's cool with being your friend but not your girlfriend. take what she gives. you would hate to not have no communication with her|`|IkAtIQumaa	]= its time to move on sweetie.|`|4p4ILuw2aa	at least you went out with her. the girl of my dreams...:(<br>  <br>  she hates me|`|0sI33S9Kaa	oh man move on|`|eRi7M7KIaa	Maybe she is not ready to get too serious<br>  Because being ur valentine is not too serious<br>  If u really want to know why, then you should talk to her<br>  Hope i helped :)|`|oT6er7BOaa	Well, maybe, because if she broke up with you it means that maybe she is afraid of taking you back.<br>  And if she agrees on being your valentine..it doesn't mean ANYTHING!|`|Dv4NHEYbaa	dudee, she might have felt bad, or just wanted a valentine<br>  not all girls like you for you<br>  move on<br>  shes really not worth it|`|wRsHdF62aa	just because she's your valentine doesnt mean she wants you back.  but be her friend for now.  and itll all fall right where its supposed to|`|coQ3EPTbaa	i think she mightv been your valentine to spare your feelings or she had no1 else. :( sorry mate but you gotta move on|`|ZwweGkoFaa	ok i def think you should move on because you could be wasting you time one her instead of finding someone else
xBd96wvRaa	Do NOT marry her. <br>  <br>  If the relationship is no good after 10 months then let the chips fall as they may.|`|aGOBuJtKaa	Just take a break from each other, and maybe you guys can pick it back up where you left off, if she hasn't found anyone. Marrying her really doesn't seem it would make a bit of a difference as the problem isn't you, its the fact you will be gone for 10 months.|`|LxfqUaaIaa	Don't just marry her before you go @_@ that might actually end up really badly because if you marry her and "leave" her (she'll feel like this) for 10 months she'll prolly consider herself tricked into staying in a really difficult situation.<br>  <br>  Long distance relationships are incredibly straining especially if you haven't experienced anything of the sort before. I'm not completely sure why you're going away (army, work, school) so I can't say things like 'take her with you' or anything but at least plan to see her at least once during the time you're away if possible. If at all possible, make committed promises you know you can keep that'll take the edge away such as constant phone calls, video calls etc.<br>  <br>  10 months is such a long time and I know that she's probably thinking that the relationship isn't worth the pain the distance will cause.|`|R1MrfZqtaa	Ask her to come with you <br>  that will be really fun, and plus you will get to marry the girl you love.|`|IkAtIQumaa	Marry her before you go.|`|rNUB8B6Vaa	marry her|`|5pnl6uoPaa	That's crazy do not marry her just to keep her because obviously if she has doubt and already giving up..isn't that Sign that she does love you that much her faith in you isn't very strong. If you marry her it is for the wrong reasons and is that away to spend your first year.I got married 2 weeks before i left to iraq when i was in the marines.. and let me tell you I wish i would have waited im still with her but there was so many problems and if we loved each other that much it wouldn't have matter. im very blunt and honest but that's the best truth....|`|ZtTtLpWvaa	Do not marry her before you go.  If she thinks the 10 month commitment is too much while dating, she'll think it is too much while married.  A ceremony doesn't change emotions or character.  <br>  <br>  I know it will be difficult, but wait this out. Her true character and love for you will come out over the 10 months.  If you all make it through, give her the wedding she deserves when you get back.  If not, she can kick rocks.  But at least you won't have to endure a divorce.|`|bFIKTjQVaa	I see most ppl are suggesting that you marry her before you go, but I don't agree with that. How long have ya'll been together? Honestly, ten months away will show you where she really want to be. My best friend's husband is in the military and he is gone for 6 months at a time. He was stationed in Japan for 2 years while they were dating. I know it is going to be hard, but you deserve someone who will think that "10 months of missing you is worth waiting to spend a lifetime with you".  <br>  <br>  That's just my thoughts on it...marrying her before you go will only complicate things...esp if she already feels like she might not be able to stay with you.... I wish ya'll the best though!|`|HTbSiEVqaa	There probably isn't anything you could say that's right, She may be having a trust issue. Once a trust has been broken, it is hard to get back.

AA11103763	This is going to sound weird, but talk to your Mom about what is going on and ask if she can "adopt" your friend.

You should probably get help from another adult that you can trust or maybe you could gather up the courage to talk to her mother about how she feels about the situation.

Daughter has cancer and is doing nothing but slowing her down. <br>  <br>  but like WTF. get a job women. get some job like at a school, even cafeteria ladies get benefits. Get some ******* health insurance. And get ur daugher some damn surgery. <br>  <br>  People these days...everybody is trash. and they make babies and their babies are raised and turn into trash. Just keeps getting worse and worse. <br>  <br>  sorry, but i can't think of anything for you to do. There is nothing really. Not like you can drive her yourself, hospitalize her, pay for it all, keep all of her missed schoolwork in a profile. And find a way to assassinate the mother. Its gonna be tough. Shes is probably not 18..and the mother has legal custody. You can't do much. Or you can get the school involved. But that can lead to police and other crap. Then she will have to be a foster chick. Even harder to get hospitalized. Nobody wants a chick with cancer.|`|tbdPLC1Aaa	I'm sorry to hear about your friend. You are an incredible person! who should be commended for your compassion as well as concern. <br>     I know that her mother seems very cold and callous about her right now, yet could it be that she is grieving over the loss of her husband and best friend?  We do not completely understand the grieving process, however, the loss of a loved one and possible loss of another loved one can destroy the strongest individual.  <br>     I'm wondering if maybe, her mother is grieving so hard for her husband and daughter's illness, that she just might be lashing out as a  defense mechanism.  Sometimes people become so angry with God and themselves because they feel helpless and don't know what to do.  Or they become distant thinking that if they disassociate themselves from the problem they won't hurt so bad.She may even need grief counseling. Pain associated with frief can make a person lose their mind.  And to be honest this lady has a lot on her plate.<br>     Believe me I am not trying to make excuses or justify the mother's behaviour; just trying to give you some understanding.Try talking with the mother and offer her your assistance as well as your frien.  After the guneral everyone leaves and goes back to their normal routine, but don't realize it is after the funeralgriever'sneed friends and family the most....because nothing isnormal again and change as well as acceptance of change takes time.<br>     Pray for her & be there when you can for love & moral support. They both need you!<br>    Please think about it. I am a fifthteen year survivor, Oncology nurse, and Grief Minister.  Love and support is what they both need.<br>     God bless and good luck!
IpzapGwgaa	I think this would look good, it is called a elbow length veil,<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.everafterbridalveils.com/image/obj8geo10pg1p8.png" rel="nofollow">http://www.everafterbridalveils.com/imag...</a><br>  <br>  a picture close to it from the back:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bridalfashionmall.com/images/VS-403-mod.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.bridalfashionmall.com/images/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wed-shopping.com/photos/veil_W1071_1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.wed-shopping.com/photos/veil_...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!!!! I hope you find your veil!|`|n4d7rqr4aa	I think an elbow-length veil with some kind of design at the hem would be beautiful.  It would also need to not be poofy.  <a href="http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplayView?storeId=10052&catalogId=10051&categoryId=-49997486&currentIdx=7&subCategory=-49998498|-49997998|-49997486&catentryId=1000655" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/s...</a>  Something like that could be really nice|`|wVp7hgaNaa	I think a tiara with a veil that comes down to your waist.|`|QP46eVi4aa	First that is a beautiful dress man is that nice <br>  <br>  I think the way the back is made you could do a simple tiara would be better then something covering the back but if you do want a veil i would get one that don't cover way to much of the back cause it is to pretty to cover|`|TDPX04jtaa	i think one that goes down to your waist would be nice. also i think  it would be very pretty if you put some small white flowers in your hair too.|`|xwzKlPFSaa	I agree... elbow length veil would look great!
KSK22vHUaa	Saturn's right.  I was with my ex for 4 years and it took me a year to feel normal.  That's a year of no dating, focusing on friendship and family, hanging out with my "toy", and just being independent.<br>  <br>  It doesn't have to take that long and it doesn't need to take that little time.  Different people take different amounts of time.  Just be careful you aren't rebounding and have fun!|`|GQUaFGHLaa	There is no certain amount of time that you have to adjust to when you are divorced. It sometimes takes longer for some people than it does for others. I am divorced and it did not take me very long at all and I was used to doing things on my own.|`|AA10065812	???????<br>  Many men never get over it and end up committing suicide at a rate 7X that of women after a divorce.|`|xmRTzE41aa	it takes a while but then again some people never get over it so who knows and who can really tell you|`|djUMvICoaa	They say look at a divorce as you would a death, because that's what it is, a death of a relationship.  Then you have to do the grieving to get over the person/relationship and that they say is about 6 months.  After that time you should be rid of the "baggage" of that relationship, of being used to that person being around or telling you what to  do.  Just getting used to doing things on your own I would think should come a little earlier than that, depending upon what all you did before.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	A while - you just have to let it happen.<br>  <br>   Try and remember who you were before you dated them.  Deal with one thing at a time, and rely upon friends who have your best interests in mind.  It's OK. And let yourself feel what you need to feel, whatever that may be, and whenever it hits you. Once you are done with your divorce, try not to discuss your ex anymore.  Who cares.<br>  <br>   The best people you can find are a great mechanic, and a great plumber.  They will know everyone else you will need.<br>   <br>   There will come a day when you realize you are whistling or singing - and you're OK.  Do whatever it takes, but I promise you, it will be worth it, and you will be yourself again.  Not Mrs. somebody, but you.<br>  <br>    Take care of yourself.  You'll be fine.|`|VBJOR4YRaa	It was not easy to get over when my ex kept sending me mixed signals which she says she didn't mean ?? I am very independent and did things by myself before with no problem and can do it again. I was just w/this person for 20 years and that part is really the hardest to deal with. The time should be better to deal with if the ex doesn't want the communication, when they say who's to say sometime people get back together kinda stuff it really tears your heart out when they don't seem to mean it. So keeping contact to me was not a good thing.<br>  Good luck to you.|`|9851deb6f5776ae6834cf0b79571e624aa	About a 1/4 of the time you were married. For example if you were married a year then it will take about 3 months. This is based on the fact that you are really over the person.|`|yHEk5IJoaa	It actually takes a while, but you might not still have feelings for this person. It will take a while to get used to...but i think you'll be ok.|`|ixRkfLjIaa	It will take me less than one second for happiness to kick in.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Can take weeks, months or years.  Depends more on why the divorce.  Everyone is different and there is no "timetable".  You just take it one day at a time to adjust.|`|n8lXItGraa	Every ones different.  Many people take as long as 5 years to truly start feeling normal again.  Some are ready to move on in a few months.  Alot depends on how long the relationship was, and if you were the one who got dumped.  Hope this helps...
Vv7a31pmaa	Go.<br>  <br>  it is an event in your life that will mean a lot to you.<br>  <br>  if you go without a date, you still can dance and then go out afterwards to the after prom parties and activities.<br>  <br>  you will have fun.<br>  <br>  would the good captain steer you wrong??
TJiGs8S4aa	Different attitudes towards money can destroy your relationship.  Spenders will spend, and you will always be broke, and you will grow to hate them while having no financial security.  Savers shouldn't be stuck with spenders.  <br>  <br>  Find someone who thinks the way you do.  This is critical.|`|s3Zbnj77aa	If you plan to be in a serious relationship with a person with the intention of maybe getting married or combining finances, you should be on the same page when it comes to money. If one of you likes to save every penny and the other spends their whole check every month, you'll probably have a lot of arguments concerning your finances if they were joined together. <br>  <br>  My fiance and I are both savers and I think this helps us a lot when it comes to everyday decisions and long term goals. For example, we decide to eat out no more than once a week and cook the other meals to conserve. We also try to build a nice safety net by living modestly in case one of us ever became unemployed or just to one day use towards a house, etc.  <br>  <br>  You should have an honest conversation with your partner and discuss the way you feel towards money and ask him/her their thoughts and feelings towards it. You should be able to come up with some sort of compromise and meet in a middle ground.
ce53a9f68093b2a6cf60a521947320d0aa	ummmmmm id wait awhile before doing anything drastic.. SOME men tend to shy away from "babies" because they are scared of not doing something right.. like holding the baby wrong or worry about dropping them ect.. men tend to really get involved when the baby starts being more of a toddler and has the capabilities of playing more.. so wait and see what happens when she gets a bit older.. besides he's a kid himself and he's probably scared out of his mind based on the sheer fact that he is a dad.. let them both grow up alittle more|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	oooo...he's immature because you married a kid. and as a kid (young adult) he's consumed about self, like anyone else his age.<br>  <br>  you have two kids on your hands to raise. sorry so frank. either you will end up putting up with him in the hope that he will mature earlier than the average age of 26, or you will get fed up and move on. he doesnt even have a job? your family is enabling him to act irresponsibly.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	You answered you own question about halfway through.... "He doesn't have to work, my father is very wealthy"....<br>  <br>  Both he and your father should be ashamed of this arrangement. It does neither of them, and you, no good.|`|3iNobwVraa	He's 18!  What is the attraction?  I mean...well...I'm sure I can guess the attraction, but is this how you imagine your husband?  Not I, that's for sure!!|`|TXB5wVlSaa	It doesn't sound like he cares about being a father.  Talk to him about how you feel and work on it.  If after that this continues, I would definitley consider moving on.  He's obviously more interested in a social life other than a family life.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	18?  <br>  <br>  he's just a kid.  nothing adult about most 18 year old boys,and he's no different.<br>  <br>  if your father is rich, your guy should still work... or doesn't he have any dignity?  (probably not).<br>  <br>  this situation is a mess by far.|`|dHPA390Qaa	How mature are you wanting an 18 year old teenager to be?  Guys mature slower then girls do, so he needs another 10 years to be the man you are wishing he would be.|`|a09f31fab9e4e5a637346b086ea3ef92aa	he is young and immature. only as he gets older will he be a better family man.<br>  why didn't you marry me instead? oh well better luck next time.|`|uUjQBKQaaa	Tell him he has to get a job for starters.He lives off your dads money & takes no responsibility for his family,just does what he wants..hhmm?|`|AB5erhhUaa	I think you should kick him out and get a real man!|`|Sgm0RrMQaa	he's immature. talk to him, tell him he NEEDS to stay home and be with his family. if he can't handle it maybe he shouldn't have got married|`|UMdbmE24aa	i think he wants you for you fathers money.

My boyfriend is younger than me and he drives me crazy also but I love him and I realize that he hasn't matured to the level where I am at. So I just try to be an example to what a family should be(not be a slave).I would say don't give up just yet. Communicate your feelings to him and take it from there.|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	You're allowing him to neglect his own daughter. Disgusting.|`|IvMPh09baa	you could talk to him and tell him how you feel when he does this.  you could tell him that you don't believe he is ready to settle down and have this family if he's not spending any time with you or his daughter, and if he doesn't rearrange his schedule to make time for you and your daughter then perhaps you and your daughter would be better off on your own.  oh dear... he's only 18.. wow... what the hell are you doing having an 18 year olds baby??? Seriously girl! <br>  <br>  YOu married a young boy, not a man.... guys at 18 years old are at about the same maturity level as a 13 year old.  goodluck with this, you made a big mistake and if you stay with him you will have a good 10 years of bullcrap to put up with before he becomes a mature grown man.
B24W8w43aa	Just accept them. You've done your job. Nothing else you can do.|`|901eafc186c995cb8a7e6e8ce846775faa	My mother was addicted to prescription drugs.  I told her that I resented that I had to take care of her because she refused to do it herself.  So, she told me to just leave her alone.  I got real close to her face and I said, "You know damn well that I won't leave you if you need help.  Dad taught us better than that.  So if you choose to stay in this mess, you are sentencing your children to clean it up.  You either pull yourself together, or watch us clean up after you".<br>  <br>  After hearing that we would aggressively clean up after her (even if we weren't nice about it), she decided to really reclaim her independence, and she has been sober with the help of the 12 step program.  But she had to want it, and she had to feel as if she were in a corner, because she was.  And it came to a point where even her drugs could not diminish that fact any longer.<br>  <br>  All in all, it took intervention after intervention and a refusal to abondon her, even when I wanted to.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little.

0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	I'm so sorry that this has happened to your sister. I went through a nasty divorce many years ago and remarried only recently. At that time, there was not very much information available and not very much help or support other than divorce lawyers and courts, and a few experienced family members. <br>  <br>  From my experience it really does have all of the aspects of any other grief related situation. She will go through the stages of grief. Elizabeth Kubler-ross formulated a theoretical model and she put her theories into 5 stages. Although her basic theory was in regards to death and the grief process, your sister is experiencing the death of a marriage and the loss of her future as she had planned it to be.<br>  <br>  Anyone who is in a supportive position, as you and your family are, would certainly benefit from understanding this theory and how it can help a person work through the emotional challenges that will become evident as she goes through this process.<br>  <br>  With my own divorce in mind, it took so much longer to identify the issues and work though them. I'm thinking that a counsellor who is able to help your sister work through her emotions would be of great benefit to her.<br>  <br>  My present wife lost her husband many years ago in a bad accident. What she described was so similar to what a divorcing person experiences as they too suffer the pains of bereavement.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if you see the similarities, but I do.|`|wzqahEqiaa	I have the deepest sympathy for your sister.  I don't know why the guy got married if he was going to have an affair.  Many people are selfish, base everything on emotions, and don't take commitment seriously.  I'm tired of society treating relationships and people like everything is disposable.  Hopefully your sister can find a good man that respects her.|`|UJD2eYebaa	Because he is a selfish, inconsiderate jerk!  Good for your sister for moving on & immediately filing.  It really is shocking that someone could be so cruel to have an affair at all, but give me a break - so soon into the marriage?!  He is just a selfish pig & this has nothing to do with your sister, it's a huge character flaw which he owns alone.  It's great she has family to help her through this - good luck to all!|`|cdQryr7paa	Only he could actually answer that.<br>  But if he was with her for 5 years before they got married, I would bet he had cheated before the next door neighbor came along.<br>  He most likely just started taking your sister for granted and expected her to always be there no matter what he did.|`|89dbda5201b9cd4a4f9e174ecf63f9f7aa	Number one, there was a problem in the marriage.  The problem was large enough or damaging enough that there was room for a stranger.  Now what that problem was, your sister and her husband will have to figure out.  Could he be addicted to sex?  Could he need more reassurance and support than your sister realized?  Were they able to communicate and fulfill each other?  Something was wrong, or he would have protected the marriage.  I am sorry that your sister has to go through this pain, but can she work with him and find out what went wrong for him?  Can they work it out and rebuild?  If not, can she take this blow as a life lesson and grow as woman herself?  The bottom line here is that she will live on.  I hope she can find happiness again with him or without him, and not be a bitter person forever.  You can be a wonderful support to her.  God bless!|`|jVOapeKVaa	There are a lot of factors as to why.<br>  The other chick probably was hotter in every way (thus the saying "the girl next door")<br>  He probably was bored after 5 years <br>  She probably never did anything to spice it up<br>  He couldnt control his "in the moment" emotions (meaning when he saw a beautiful woman he completely forgot he has a girl, or just didnt care until after)<br>  All these things could have led to him cheating. Its truly sad.|`|KSK22vHUaa	Sounds like he lost his confidence in women with the first wife.  Unfortunately this can be a difficult thing to fix, even in yourself.  But having no confidence in women (not your sister specifically at all--just women in general) lets him see his bitterness towards the first woman in all women, to a degree.  It makes it easier to cheat.<br>  <br>  But what he did was wrong, whether he has a good explanation, a crappy explanation, or nothing.  I wish her the best of luck.  And don't let her become bitter!|`|a09f31fab9e4e5a637346b086ea3ef92aa	I mainly blame the neighbor, she lured him in, women can be devils at times and men are just weak when it comes to temptation.<br>  <br>  I am not saying that he is an angel, of course he should have known what he is doing and resist the temptation.<br>  Only the couple themselves will be able to settle this, if he is truly sorry and know what a huge wrong thing he did, then maybe she can give him a 2nd chance...if he deserve it.|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	It could be " I'll get her before she gets me " his first wife hurt him so he isn't going to let that happen to him ever again.|`|C4rVwbi7aa	it is nothing ur sister did or did not do there r simply very self centerd people in this world who disregard others feelings an fullfill there own twisted desires she needs to clearly understand ITS NOT HER FAULT|`|Ps9eOIchaa	He was just immature and horny and didn't know how to appreciate what he had.Maybe he'll learn next time.I hope things get better for her and that she finds a man who will love her and respect her|`|982b63b7af7d35aa88514fbe563f2b78aa	there is NO excuse for his behavior and your sister should move on <br>  and cut her losses.|`|ee2eb688bade7663b57e940f752dc454aa	The guy chose to break his marriage vows for a quick piece of ***. It has nothing to do with your sister and everything to do with her husband.<br>  Maybe he's afraid of real commitment and being married was too "suffocating" for him. He might not even know 'why' he did what he did..<br>  What you can do for your sister is be there for her, give her as much unconditional love as you can, provide positive emotional support. Right now her self-confidence and self-esteem are probably at an all-time low. Remind her of her sterling qualities, let her know she is appreciated and valued. Realize that she has a right and need to mourn the loss (and disappointment) of this relationship. Try to keep her from beating herself up about it, however.<br>  And, whatever you do, don't try to be a go-between with her husband.<br>  Plus, although there may be some clues there, what his first wife did doesn't have to have anything to do with how he treated your sister. It's really not worth the time and energy to try and figure him out.|`|FprrMexEaa	plain and simple,<br>  he wasnt interested in her anymore<br>  <br>  or he jusst got problems<br>  maybe is is mentally unstable|`|7MtjF084aa	hmmmm. how long did your sister know him before they got into a relationship.....if not very long it could be she was a rebound.. but noone really knows WHY men cheat...you just need to really get to know the one your about to spend your life with.|`|znZxydq5aa	straght up stupidity....im sorry but hez a dumb *** i mean really the next door neighbor why not hiz own grandmother i mean damn that waz so obviouse!|`|eVY7Oilbaa	I would think the other woman could have seduced him.<br>  Or maybe he's just not a trustworthy person.|`|y3XXQm1saa	yea she should run for the hills and divorce him there are alot of better man outthere...<br>  he is a pig..|`|pzLDXL6gaa	There often isn't a cause - you can't put it down to anything specific.

AA10065812	???????<br>  I wrote this five years ago for a possible newspaper story.<br>  <br>  Young Women Playing Older Men<br>  <br>  Female, Age 20;<br>  Slender, But Not Skinny;<br>  Dresses Well, But Not Overly Sexual;<br>  Education: 9th Grade, No College;<br>  Pregnant Twice, Both Miscarried;<br>  Lives In Section 8 Housing;<br>  Occupation: Playing Older Men For Money.<br>  <br>  In my travels as a taxi cab driver I'm seen all types of people. I see people from both ends of the economic community, from the low to the ultra high income. I've seen people so drunk that you have to wonder if they are trying to pickle their brains. Then, there are the ladies that get tipsy after half a glass of "Near Beer," and who are experiencing wardrobe problems. There's the people going to work, and the ones looking for work. There are the givers, the takers, and the players. This story is about one such player, the young woman described above, and for the purposes of this article, we'll call her Clariette. <br>  <br>  Clariette considers herself as someone who is owed better things in life than what has been handed her, but without punching a time clock. Her trip into adulthood started early, at age fourteen, when she moved away from her mother and in with her boyfriend, age 15. They lived in the home of his widowed father, who drank heavily ever since the passing of the boy's mother. This is where she began to learn the art of playing an older man. She would manipulate the father sympathies by claiming the need for money to pay for personal items. Later, she would play on his loneliness, by claiming to know a young woman who may like to be with him, and even suggesting that she may consider it, though she never does either.<br>  <br>  Finally, after three years, and two miscarriages, fathered by the son, she breaks up with him, and moves back home with her mother. However, having seen how easy it was to get money from the old man, she begins looking for new ways to meet older men to elicit money from.<br>  <br>  Generally, since 17-year-olds and 40+ year old men do not run in the same circles, she must find a different way to meet them. A cousin suggests calling a 1-900 phone number.<br>  <br>  Nine hundred numbers. The bane of many a parent of teenagers. First introduced by ABC News in 1980 for receiving comments about the nomination of Ronald Reagan, the 900-phone line system, and other related numbers, take in millions of dollars, daily. They have many uses, from giving out useful information, to the more exotic for people of alternate lifestyles. One of those uses became the primary way for Clariette to meet older men, a 900 dating line.<br>  <br>  Clariette found that she could meet all kinds of men using the service. She could get to know some things about them, such as whether they worked a good paying job, or otherwise had money. As much as men think women are vane, men can be just as vane when it comes to talking about their jobs, or where they are economically. As such whittling information out of a man who has already spent 20+ years in the work force, becomes quite easy. You just have to tickle their ego a little, and because of the anonymity of the 900 line, other than catching certain phrases that don't sound right, the men don't know they are talking to a smart child.<br>  <br>  Once she picks her targets, she arranges to meet each one, in person during the coming week. She has already been playing the men, telling each one that she may not be able to talk to them for much longer, because she has run up her phone bill. This will be the first item on her list of things she will need to "borrow" money to pay, though if one or more of the men is particularly lonely, he will offer to pay it, before she asks. She continues this practice regarding other expenses, such as the utility bill, rent, and even claiming to have children, that need clothes, or their teeth done.<br>  <br>  When one or more of the men realize that they have given her a few hundred (or a few thousand) dollars with no specific commitment to a future, she feigns being upset over not being trusted and leaves. Being well practiced at this, she already has three or four other men on the hook, and can always add more with a few phone calls, or a wink..<br>  <br>  I spoke with Clariette for over 30-minutes on her life as a player of men. She seemed proud of how easy it was to get money out of older men, without even the need for sex, though she did use subtle hints of the possibility. It did not matter how old they were, or even how they looked, only how much money they had, and was willing to part with.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	Talk to your sister about .  Since she's friends with the girl, she should have some idea of what type of person she is.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	Attractive, rich, and a 36 year old virgin?<br>  <br>  Closet fag or psycho?|`|ZvhtPCWQaa	you know what, i actually believe your story. being a 36 yearold virgin who makes $1.2mil a year and is a vp of an investment seems very believable.<br>  <br>  oh, and you fail at life.|`|UJD2eYebaa	What investment bank are you working for that's still making money?|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	I call BS.

What a turn off.|`|3iNobwVraa	Bring up the subject of pre-nups and note her reaction, lol.  I don't know, honestly.  I would guess that a preoccupation with expensive things MAY give some insight.  Take her out to a total fun dive(not a four star restaurant), and talk to her.  <br>  <br>  Mention that sometimes you wonder if your job is worth all the stress.  Tell her you sometimes dream of being a high school teacher.  Ask what she wants out of life.  Ask how she would choose a mate for life.<br>  <br>  It will probably become obvious.|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	she's interested in you. if she's a golddigger she will want you to spend the HELL out of money on her behalf. want you to take her shopping or her focus will always be on YOUR money and not her own self sufficency.<br>  <br>  no disrespect, but it seems that you're insecure about your own success and being used by the opposite sex. taking your time in relationships always brings the truth out sooner or later.<br>  <br>  and as mentioned, if you have concerns about being used, just specify your need for a prenup, if things get that serious. the truth will come out with that request, if you ever get to that point.<br>  <br>  life is so much more fun without all of the social hangups. dont be so afraid to have fun. spend a little and get spent on. did you get to the point to make all of that money just to be alone because you're afraid of being used?<br>  <br>  that would be a very sad sort of life...if you truly want to share your life with someone one day...|`|yOHCXiaMaa	ok so she asked you out to dinner.  In my book that means the night is on her.  But imagine she knew her friend has a brother..she walks in and see's all that glitters is gold..and suddenly..bam.. want to go out? She is probably thinking that you will feel awkward and she can be sooo sweet and you will fall for that act... I mean you are a virgin.. after all.<br>  <br>  what is sounds like to me is that you need to agree to meet her for the dinner but be prepared to pay.  Don't pick her up, after all, she asked you.  Meet and talk and then decide what to do but don't forget to leave the finances at home and stay away from tiffany's.<br>  <br>  Also...add a dash of humility with that 7 course meal your serving.

Money makes men A LOT more attractive. They were just talking about the research into this. They showed some guys to women, then made up salaries for the guys. The guy who previously scored lowest in attractiveness suddenly became a 10 when his imaginary salary was 365,000 dollars a year. Discover channel will replay the show again later tonight. Lucky for some of us, there are plenty of other factors, too. But money is a big one. If it is too much trouble for you just get rid of all your money-- you can write me a nice big check!|`|a09f31fab9e4e5a637346b086ea3ef92aa	didn't you post yesterday asking why ppl were checking out your fancy outfit while dining alone?<br>  man now I envy you more, please tell me some tips of how to become financially successful, I'm extremely broke with a very little income.<br>  at the same time I'm extremely successful with women "crazy world eh?" <br>  <br>  so about the question, it is very hard especially at this time to know her intentions towards you, it is not how she acts or what she "request" of you, but more of what you can know about her.<br>  if you like her,try to get to know her,what she is like and how she deals with life,it is only by getting to know her really well will you be able to determine if she's into your wallet or not.
TDPX04jtaa	i suggest saving up enough for the wedding and honeymoon it self so you dont have to take out a loan and make more bills but as for waiting until you graduate and make more money no i dont think you have to wait for that.  it will not make you more in love....<br>  <br>  <br>  i see like as  " why not now...if not now then when...."  it could be never you know.|`|iDfRTLklaa	The only advice I would give you is don't get into a huge debt trying to have the perfect day.  If you happy about having a wedding which wont cost the earth, get married when ever you both feel like your ready.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Before you set a budget, you need to sit down with your fiance and make 3 lists. First is wedding stuff that you must have. The second is a list of things that are nice to have but you can live without. The last list is things that you don't want to include or that aren't important to you.<br>  <br>  Then you need to figure out what things cost in your area. The ladies on the local boards at <a href="http://talk.theknot.com" rel="nofollow">http://talk.theknot.com</a> are helpful in that area. Then you will have an idea of how much money to set aside and you can start working on your budget.
VkVyuq5baa	My parents are long gone. I have good reason to hate my dad but for some strange reason I don't. Now I live with my aunt, uncle and cousin and have done for over 14 years. My resentment has built up towards each of them for various reasons over time. When I first came to live with them I never understood their rules. My aunt is a ******* control freak. From living in the estate as a 5 year old kid allowed to do anything > not being able to leave the house without permission, become a perfect student at school and accept constant criticism/ignorance as their son had to know that he will ALWAYS come first. After a few years when I did well in my A-levels, found a girlfriend and was able to stand up for myself they give me a little bit of slack and I had a little less hate for them. But even today, my aunt will piss me off beyond belief. She is constantly ******* chattering away at me... "are you going to classes, WHY NOT?!! Are you not looking after yourself??!!! Have you done any work towards..." and yes she may want the best for me but there is a certain way she should be going about it. Yesterday she cracked at me for taking the wrong exit at a roundabout and destroyed any progress (confidence-wise) that I had made over the past week. So yea, I have loved my aunt a lot but there are times when I feel I despise her. I'm not ashamed of saying this, I think it's a normal emotion and someone who says "your a spoiled brat for feeling that way" is a **** (k is to avoid censorship) and probably feels in retrospect that they should have appreciated their parents more. To these people, let others make their own mistakes, it's a necessary part in growing up. In summation, I think that you are normal and I hope you get to move out soon too. I'd try to keep them onside as much as possible and if it is possible to salvage a relationship with new circumstances then do so :)|`|3QqLYCJCaa	Wow.  You've got some deep-seeded anger there.<br>  It doesn't seem that normal to me, but if neither you nor they care about it, then why ask?<br>  If it does bother you, you might want to consider seeing a therapist.<br>  Do you hate other people this much as well, or just your parents?|`|vuEyUbsgaa	I dont think you truly hate your parents. If they died right now I bet you would feel sad. You may really angry at them but you dont hate them. I think you just dont value them...|`|ShHOAf4daa	no i do not think so.|`|ZRv94Pdtaa	no it is not normal. You should love your parents. So you are either a bad person and turned out to be trash. Or your parents are trash and your hate for them is understandable. <br>  <br>  of course everybody has a time when they really really hate their parents. But that is usually during the middle school-high school years. And its not even that bad. Maybe like if u stay out late till 2 u get in trouble. And u get mad at them for a week or so. Or if you get some bad grades. you feel disappointment not hate. <br>  <br>  I mean think about it. They took care of u for 9 months. tried to feed u the best stuff. Then ur born. They wasted a crap load of time when u were a baby. Then they took u to school. Think of all of the money wasted on you. Even if it was soccer camp. they paid for all the food, clothes and all. How could you hate them. Even if they overworked u at school. you don't have to hate them like that. They just want to u be great and all of that other bull ****. <br>  <br>  So you hating them that much is not normal. you crackhead.|`|73nSUKNKaa	This is PERFECTLY normal as your body is releasing a hormone telling you "You need to get out of the nest" this induces a natural "hate" for family members, especially those who give you commands.<br>  <br>  Just hang in there and it WILL pass.<br>  <br>  All the Best|`|XRFlcSX3aa	RELAX.<br>  <br>  unless your parents did something to provoke your hatred of them then YOU are the one with the problem and need to chill. could be hormones from puberty or maybe you're just a sociopath, if the latter is true then get ready for a tough life.|`|l5bOjv8paa	Do you have logical reasons to hate them? Because if you did, I think that would be normal. Just because they're your parents, doesn't mean you have to love them.<br>  <br>  If you hate them just for no apparent reason at all, then I don't think that's very normal..|`|9mHubBVgaa	actually it is..but when you begin your life on your own you begin to value your parents so much more...guarantee 10 years from now your going to call your parents and tell them i really appreciate what you did for me!<br>  <br>  one love.|`|296wZyhmaa	Well now that depends.. Was your relationship with them really bad? Because I feel the exact same way about my dad, but that's 'cause I have good reasons.|`|o6IiYw6baa	it is normal to hate them somewhat but i think that it is abnormal for u to hate them that much|`|u70ecVvBaa	uh no.|`|SdlEr5zqaa	Obviously everyone who is "normal" has some form of teenage angst towards their parents because they aren't interested in what they have to say anymore. I think you need to try and preserve a relationship with them by getting out of there. When I moved out at 18 I couldn't wait to be under my own roof. Now my parents and I have an amazing relationship. <br>  <br>  Try not to use the word "hate", but instead say "dislike". because when you grow out of it, and you will, you will only "hate" yourself for feeling this way about them.|`|R4BiS011aa	i understand, but i cannot say it is normal, but i have the same thing! well kinda i love my dad but i hate my mom whenever i am around her everything just makes me so mad like i cant even describe it i moved in with my dad but he makes me visit my mom if i had a choice i would not even see my mom like i cant stand her and i cant wait until i don't have to visit her.<br>  <br>  so your not the only one,|`|UBxKqdPwaa	This is normal for young people who are spoiled and think they should always have their own way, rolling over the top of parents and anyone else in authority.  You would really be doing them a favor if you were to move out soon.|`|40a3d5b0131213ad65d94bbb95fb579aaa	Hate is a very strong word. You haven't given reason for this hatred so it's impossible to judge whether it's justified or not. Teenagers often find their parents to be disagreeable but by the time most kids reach your age they've begun to see them in a more respectable light. Don't be too quick to alienate them. Some parents aren't as forgiving as you may need them to be.Think before you leap and put yourself in their position. How pleasant has life been with you for them?
zdu3gh8jaa	Try asking your mum for pictures of extended family and ask her about the people in them, or ask to see her wedding photos, they are usually full of relatives. You could also get your parents to talk to you more about your grand parents, aunts and uncles etc if you were making/researching your family tree. I'm sure if you ask them they will be able to tell you something. As for your brother, don't worry, most brothers don't get on with their sisters when you are growing up, another few years down the line and things will be different.<br>  <br>  Have a hug (((((hug))))) you sound like you could do with one, and as for having no relatives to talk to, well neither have I but then I am much much older than yourself and there is always the 'yahoo family' that you can talk to, you know all us people here - we are always ready with an open ear. :-)    :-)|`|o6IiYw6baa	well i cant really explain it but i wud call the child protective service and leave
t8c9S3kDaa	ignore her... she's playing the jealousy game.  and ignoring her is your ace in the pocket.  because when she tries to make you jealous, nothing drives her more crazy than a cold shoulder|`|s3Zbnj77aa	He might have brought her just to make you jealous. It sounds like he might still like you as well. Why don't you tell him how you feel and he might very well feel the same way.|`|sgfGvjs0aa	well in my opinion he still has feelings for you and his new girlfriend is jealous, since your prettier than her and by bringing her friend it was a way to intimidate you.<br>  <br>  My BF's Opinion: he's a total a-hole and just wants to F you and make you jealous.|`|gUjVUF31aa	Let him make the first move
gtec2vZIaa	spend some real time with her just hanging out and talking...some people really just change and grow apart. so find out if you want to "drift apart" or if you wanna stay friends with her.|`|1cBV1V3iaa	just tell teh damn girl|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Yes.  Don't hint - tell her clearly and explicitly.|`|3Z7B0dcaaa	Get her to understand??<br>  Just tell her!<br>  <br>  If you're afraid she's going to be a *****,<br>  don't be.<br>  <br>  If she is, or "quits being friends with you"<br>  after you tell her,<br>  obviously she isn't worth your time.<br>  <br>  There's better people out there.|`|PBUTpWpIaa	just tell her|`|RyU5XDmuaa	even i haven't a clue as to what you said and I'm pretty good at this
AA10088948	Get over him.<br>  <br>  You love the idea of him more than the reality of him.<br>  <br>  He has a new GF and wants to get on with her.  You are in the way.<br>  <br>  It hurts now but guess what in a while like six months.|`|FiCl71flaa	I sympathize with your pain and disappointment at the break up of your romance.Based on what you have written, it appears that you soon to be ex is confused,in a panic about something,maybe has issues that he does not want you to know about,and is using all of these platitudes to end it with you.There is nothing you can do in a case like this since he has already made up his mind to leave the relationship. I know it hurts like crazy right now and you probably do not know what to do but I will advise that you let time be your ally.Time will not only let you see what any future plans will bring but also allow you to decide what your next move should be  .Try to keep the faith and belief.|`|lK3TXGBOaa	idk....i think i got dumped too..... i miss him soo much and ive been crying alot because he did me sooo wrong..... <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  can you please answer mine...

If you love him, let him know that you are there when he is ready to talk.  Please, do not try to force him to expose all his feelings. That may be one reason he is wanting to have time alone.<br>  Be cool, don't become all weepy.  Be a big girl.  Then wait for him, he will call, and when he does, do not pressure him in any way.|`|F1c2HFkwaa	Well that happend to M€ if Y?? really love him and he loves you Y?? should break up with him because yaw gonna be thinking of each shouder every time...|`|abTZX46faa	watch the rocky films, they are good.|`|mLqRBioaaa	i have an idea. since you both need time don't break up! your still in love, he's just going through something. stay with your parents, friends, exteneded family members, sisters, brothers, or even a hotel until this gets cleared up. HOWEVER, he may need you right now! he may not know it or realize it yet, but he probably needs you just to be there for him until he is ready to talk! DON'T move out unless he agrees to it. just give it time, this will all work out. Everything happens for a reason. :) listen to hide and seek by imogen heap. it's a great song, and makes me feel better. has nothing to do with your situation, it's just a good song. also speeding cars by imogen heap is good too, i wish you luck. :)|`|oXDlzp2qaa	I really feel like if you love someone you are not going to want to break up with them...i think breaking up makes things worst...you miss the person and in the end the person your with should be able to help you to figure things out. you guys have been together 2 years so it shouldnt have to come to a break up that just seems like jumping to conclusions too, too fast|`|vDdedQ2eaa	Don't break up. Still be with him because later on both of you guys will regret it. because, when he is having hard times in his life he would have no one to be with nor talk to. Trust me I had many hard times in my life and I had no one. Now I'm 18 still having hard times and I regret of having no one in my life. So if you still love him and so still be with him.|`|6e68ce4ae0cc1fabdc0a003e64178809aa	offer to do pretty much anything to help him, to be there to support him.... atleast show him that there's nothing you wouldn't do to make it work.

I wish I could tell you a magic word of spell that would make all you pain go away, but fact is there just is not any. I know it dosent help at all right now to hear the saying...... Time heals wounds but fact is, Its very true! I to have had my heart ripped out, so I do understand your pain.  Its very painful for your other 1/2 to say they are not happy in life and needs time to figure it out. Even if you dont see it as a blessing.. well maybe it is, He must know that is at this point cant be the man you need him to be, so he loves you enough to set you free for awhile. Would you want someone who would not be honest, or someone who would lie, and let you believe all was ok when it was not.<br>  I know it does not stop the pain.

Q0HEpw3jaa	Go! Don't let your friend hold you back. You are going to be separated after high school most likely and you shouldn't let her stop you from going. Just don't tell her you're going and don't lie. It's not like she didn't get invited and it was one of her friends. If you don't go you'll regret it!|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Go ahead and go; if your best friend gets jealous, there's really nothing you can do except encourage her that you'll go to her party if she throws one. And she'll get over it if she does get jealous even if she gets really mad. =) Have fun!|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	you should just go, and who cares if she gets yellest..<br>  shes yellest of you..,<br>  hahaha.|`|1a195e834f21aad260c9607f401e83c4aa	You should go and don't mention it unless your asked just say you went to a party and don't talk too much about it. And she will not feel bad if she has never talked to the person whose invited you! Enjoy the party! Don't feel bad as you  have nothing to feel bad about!
7DcozMvSaa	i think he likes you.<br>  i think his kinda afraid that you dont like him anymore because he said no to the dance or else his playing with your feelings.<br>  you should ask him what's going on.
zdu3gh8jaa	That's a really good start. <br>  <br>  Tell her that you will always be grateful for having her in your life and you are thankful that you know that you can always turn to her. Explain that hopefully the two of you will grow closer still and that you know that she loves and cares for you. Talk about the lovely experiences that you have shared and how you hope that there will be many more to come.<br>  <br>  Once you start to write it will just flow from your heart. Good luck to you and I truly wish for you a wonderful and happy future.  :-)|`|AA11103763	What you have is great.

lIpjuMTHaa	I think that its wrong. The secrecy just makes it too hard. Your parents are the people you should confide in. I think that they would be less mad knowing than they would not knowing and finding out in 2 years.|`|mefxIQP9aa	It sucks that you have to hide stuff like that from your parents. You really like him and you want to show him off.<br>  <br>  Parents are tough to deal with sometimes. <br>  <br>  If the relationship is still on after a year, you're going to have to tell them sooner or later.|`|lK3TXGBOaa	idk i was in a secret relationship too and my parents didnt know about him but i think you should tell them because what if your sneaking out wiht him and god forbid something happens to both of you your parents wont know where you are....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  can you please answer mine...<br>  <br>  go to my profile under my questions and its the first one that says  <br>  <br>  " HELP!! need advice......."<br>  <br>  i would gladly appreciate it<br>  <br>  thanx :)|`|1Lo34oEDaa	you are better off being honest tell them that you are old enough and that you really like this guy dont say love cause they will just be stupid but yeah just deffinantly tell them cause its better that way and you are less likely to get in trouble and honestly they cant make you break up with him no one can make you do any thing you dont want to do <br>  <br>  good luck =)|`|R1MrfZqtaa	I know you aren't aloud to go out with someone, but bring him over one day, and maybe they will get a good impression on him, and change their minds, I don't think they would make you break up with him if you really love him.|`|J74pbAmHaa	Probably you should tell your parents about your relationship because if you keep it a secret they would probably figure out themselves and they would make you break up with him so you should tell them right away.<br>  I Hope you guys won't break up.<br>  <br>  Peace. =)|`|BJ6Fxorgaa	i think it depends on how old you are and how serious the relationship is. If you guys are young, like middle school, then i dont think its that big of a deal to keep it from your parents. But if you older than that, i would tell them. <br>  <br>  sit down and tell your parents that your happy and safe, and that he is nice and respects you. You could even ease them into the idea by hanging out with him (with them knowing) and then telling them once they see that hes a nice guy and you really like him.<br>  <br>  good luck and i hope things work out :)|`|b5a3lKFSaa	if you don't tell your parents, then when they find out, they are going to lose all trust in you.<br>  that is the worst thing you want especially with your parents.<br>  <br>  sit them down and talk.  let them know about this boy..  explain why you two are ready.. why you two are together..  ect.<br>  don't keep it a secret-it will haunt you in the end and give you more of a problem then breaking up with your boyfriend (if that is what your parents will make you do)<br>  <br>  i hope everything works out.<br>  goood luck :]|`|Feu5DYe6aa	you should probably tell them. they would want to hear it from you and not someone else. im sure they wont make u break up with him, but they will probably want to meet him
D20JGTwXaa	I think your friend shouldnt have told him to begin with . This exact thing happened to me when I was in the 6th grade but the boy didnt have that reaction. Anyway back to you...you should just act normal and be yourself. If he doesnt like you there are plenty of boys who will. Just make sure you dont make a fool of yourself and dont stare at him too much or anything ..cuz den he probably think your "feenin" or something. On the bright side if he does say something on Monday ..atleast u kno he notices you now lol.|`|fqgbAVi9aa	OMG OMG calm DOWNNNNNNNNN eeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!<br>  <br>  if he says ew, thats a definite no. sorry. better luck next time?|`|XikuCXuVaa	just be cool and act like it never happend, the last thing you want to do is act scared around him because then your going to bring more attention to your self|`|7XizbF6Caa	like listen to your favorite song an d get pumped up or something ar be like whatever yeah i like you life is too short to be scared and not blunt i mean so what all he could say  to is get mad and if he does he a jerk.:)

It's quite sad that most (not all) women don't listen to the good stuff, only what's on the radio. But when I was in high school, there were a few. Usually they have boyfriends already though =[<br>  <br>  Most women who hate metal dislike it because it's loud and unpopular. They also tend to think (not ALL the time however) that all metalheads are stupid people living in trailers. This is NOT true. I'm an example of that. Not to brag, but I don't fit the typical mold. I had a 3.5 GPA throughout high school, yet all my friends were the outsiders- the emo kids, scene kids, the nerds, the druggies, and the losers. I was a warm, friendly person, I dressed cleanly, yet I didn't associate with the so-called "popular kids." Chances are, women don't want you because you fit one of those typical stereotypes. If not, well, you WILL find a girl eventually. Just don't give up being who you are.|`|lFzFtiCBaa	confining yourself to 1 fashion and not being versatile only limits your opportunities to be with someone in that genre. Mix it up, dont be so 1 trended.|`|AA10088948	Your 15 you can't drive and your spending too much time with the bands.<br>  <br>  Grow up, than worry about girls.|`|sx8MsmPSaa	Um, not generally.

Maybe you come off as someone who is angry because of the music you listen to but other than that it is definitely not the music. Maybe the right girl hasn't come along.<br>  I don't like the music my boyfriend listens to (Nonstop mind you) but that doesn't mean I don't want to not date him for it. <br>  Also maybe you aren't in the right places... perhaps go somewhere that girls enjoy metal?<br>  Hope you find what you are looking for!|`|WwTxboY9aa	I love metal myself, so yes some chicks do like metalheads. Be patient, you'll meet one that absolutely loves it, and im sure the fact that you are in a band will be very attractive. Personally , I love it when a guy can play the guitar, but heaps of chicks love a drummer. <br>  Also , maybe you are looking in the wrong places for a girlfriend, try meeting girls with common interests....like at a gig or a metal party or something? <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|R532kalcaa	dude, no. its gay because when you think of a failure you think of someone living in a trailer playing guitar that dropped out of high school and skipped college and plays in a crappy metal or 70's band. if u do any 2 of those your doomed|`|B7XNIGmiaa	cut your hair stop being a metalhead and change you style chicks would dig you. and not really girls dont really like metaheads|`|pPyovJljaa	They freaking rock <33<br>  <br>  You're probably really really awesome (:<br>  <br>  I would totally hang out with you...|`|Ijx7a94iaa	Personally for me i love metal-heads more then anything. <br>  And what do you play in your 2 bands??|`|WucVTqv9aa	get rid of the long hair and girls will LUV you!!!!|`|mcmOslOFaa	no way...cowboy butts drive me nuts!!
088b2f23da252d7364143178b0433b20aa	Im usually really really shy around guys. The thing that works for me is to act over-the-top in your personality. Since your shy, it will come of as normal confidence. Also, sometimes I like to pretend that I'm the hottest girl in the world and all the guys want me. (I'm not ugly, just shy) That usually makes me act pretty flirty.|`|uff3kOoFaa	dont freak! she's probably just as afraid of talking to you as you are of her. just go up and say hi. idk if she has a facebook add her. dont worry, she wont bite your head off unless you are a REAL jerk. so just be nice, and flirt just a little.|`|1Lo34oEDaa	well... you just need to be cool just act like its one of your buddys till you get comfortable with the situation then you can just be urself make her laugj aand want to keep talking i like a guy that can make me laugh and keep me entertain for a while but i also like a guy that can be serious and can comfort me when i had a rough day <br>  <br>  hope this helps <br>  good luck =)|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	well first of all you gotta know the girl, NO GiRL would go out with a guy they dont know, but if you do know the girl enough approach her by flirting with her then getting like serious like "i've been thinking...." you know what i mean.<br>  Well good luck, and you dont got to try to act cool because girls think that;s just wackk.<br>  yes, including mehh..<br>  shhea.<br>  haha.<br>  good luck anyways!|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Just be yourself.

You should work on that before you talk to a girl because I know that one thing that girls love (not all) is a guy who feels comfortable in his own skin... if you don't feel comfortable then how will she be comfortable with you? Work on that... then what to say to a girl will be easy because you know that whatever happens you are still a strong person.... maybe then when you show that girls will approach you instead. <br>  Hope this helped! Good Luck|`|oLOHh8q9aa	it's ok if ur nervous, some girls do find it cute when a guy is really trying hard to ask her out. <br>  <br>  but if you don't want to come on too strong, try starting a conversation first so that u can mellow down a bit and mention what u plan to do and ask her if she would be interested in going out with you. <br>  <br>  it's all about taking it slow and make sure u take deep breaths. <br>  <br>  and u know everybody has been rejected at least once in their life, it's no big deal nor worth going for an incubation period to lick your wounds, just keep your head up and keep going.<br>  <br>  good luck =]|`|pqdIwbwQaa	I think you can talk to her like you talk to your female friends.
iZfHSwi3aa	You might have better luck with assistance if you asked this in the adoption section.  There are alot of people there who have done successful biological parent searches.  <br>  <br>  However, be careful in your search.  You were put into foster care for a reason, and your bio-mom might not be ready to re-establish all ties.|`|hcpgD6hBaa	Call a DEPED or try to find a Police that can find your mom.|`|iwgPtnW7aa	well you could try the website find my family,u no the tv show in aus<br>  <br>  they might help if u r lucky,its woth a shot,good luck ok<br>  try googling it,should come up|`|F47MyGDSaa	Try www.zabasearch.com and type her first name and last, and the state she lives in (if you know). Sometimes it'll give numbers and addresses (sometimes old ones too...) but you can find a lot of people on it.<br>  <br>  you can contact the adoption agency, but they probably won't be able to tell you much until you're 18. what about your adoptive parents, would they be willing to help you search for her?|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	Start by doing a search on www.ancestry.com - you can get a free 2 week trial.  They have some recent records like phone book and marriage records.  If you have a last known address, you might get lucky and find out that she still lives there.  Also, check with the adoption agency.  I'm sure they have these questions all the time.  They might be able to send you off in the right direction.
bBkpQXwnaa	tell ur friend to change her hair style or sumthin....that might get his attention. Or tell her to go up and talk to him and just be friends!!! maybe he'll start to like her again!<br>  <br>  You can also go talk to her ex and see how he feels bout her and stuff. maybe u can work something out.

2o3BHgCCaa	Go for the size that fits your largest measurement. I am guessing this will be your waist.<br>  For davids bridal you would be a size 24W as you waist needs 44 inches or more to fit in the dress. You may get away with a 22W. You would then need the other measurements altered down (bust and hips)<br>  <br>  Woman:.14W...16W...18W...20W...22W.. 24W.. 26W <br>  Bust ..... ..41......43.......45......47 ......49.......51.......53 <br>  Waist.......34.....36 ?...38 ?..40 ?...43.......45 ?...47 ? <br>  Hip..........43 ?..45 ? ..47 ?..49 ?...51 ?...53 ?...55 ?|`|QP46eVi4aa	the best thing thing to do is go to a bridal store try a few different dresses on and then when you order yours offline to get it to the best size you think would be best and remember you can have it let out or taken in a size or 2|`|vyL7yEleaa	if you are getting a davids bridal dress i would go into their store and try the dress on there and find the exact size. <br>  <br>  it is never a good idea to buy online as you never really know what you are getting until it's there. and unless you have tried it on already you won't know if the dress even looks good on you. so i would just go in instead of trying to order online unless ordering online is the aboslute last resort.<br>  <br>  i know from my own trying for Davids bridal you will need  a woman's size probably 14+ <br>  <br>  i have a 42 35 42 and a size 14W fit me like a glove. so i would suggest maybe a 16 or 18 w (W is women which is mainly if you have big boobs! lol) but you won't know unless you try it on.. either way your going to need alterations.|`|l4bPFEhUaa	I just got my dress a month ago. Go into Davids Bridal and try on some dresses! that way you can see which dresses fit you and look good on you. Also it will give you a good idea on what areas of the dress you will need to get altered. hardly any women can get a dress in a certain size and not have to get it altered in at least 1 way. Also, some dresses look fab online and don't look so fab on the person. Good luck!|`|TDPX04jtaa	i would not order online!  davids bridal sizes are differnt then most.  i ordered my size shirt online and it was way too small.   i am a size 8 but my dress size there is a 10  so the best thing to do is go to the store. besides you could love the picture of the dress on the model but it could look totally differnt on you and in person!|`|6q4E96hgaa	<a href="http://www.sheshopping.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sheshopping.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sheshopping.com/weddingdress.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.sheshopping.com/weddingdress....</a><br>  <br>  And so on!
fwRGZTvFaa	You asked him the question. Did you give any thought to how you were going to feel if he said yes. <br>  When you ask a question about something so sensitive, be sure you can handle the Truth. <br>  He was you Ex-? Right? <br>  <br>  What would be the best thing for you? I believe you know the answer or you would not have left him for playing mind games with you.  Mind games are no fun and they can hurt you.<br>  <br>  You need to do the best thing for yourself.|`|Vv7a31pmaa	run away like you would rom a burning house.  really!|`|UgRjdNRoaa	to be honest anyone who says that they want to get back with someone and then tell them all of that is not worth the trouble... he doesnt sound like hes sorry for what he did and by the sounds of it he wants to hurt you.. dont let him play you, you can do better than someone like that anyone can good luck with what you decide but dont let him in to easily if you are thinking about taking him back
ThvZUhKQaa	you dont tell him to stop, its not really up to you, that would be like motzart saying noone could play the piano, its just one of those things you can be angry about but you just have to sit ack and accept it ,im sorry and like the one above me music dosnt have to be your only thing|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Nothing wrong with him being into music. Get over it! <br>  <br>  I bet you're just worried he'll be a better musician than you. The solution: practise really hard and stay ahead of him!|`|gSEYcN67aa	are you afraid he'll be better then you or what|`|pCU3kLFBaa	Music doesnt have to be only your thing.<br>  :/<br>  EDIT: Either way you will most likely always be better than your brother since You started before him. I have been playing Piano for 5 years, Singing for 7 years, Guitar and Bass for 2 years, and Drums for 3 years and I have faced many people who wanted to play just because they thought they would be better than me and make me look like an idiot. People like that made me work even harder! Youre brother will probobly grow out of it anyway.|`|296wZyhmaa	Music is not only your thing. There are many people that like music. Why can't you enjoy it with him or something?|`|nTATyynJaa	Well either way.. you'll always be better at it cause you started at a younger age!
GIPIjD2Oaa	maybe to the people around you or family if they're religious but many people get through that if they love eachother.|`|vqqxD6Teaa	It depends on the person. For some people it won't be a problem at all for others it would be a huge one. For me race wouldn't matter at all. Religion is another story though. It wouldn't matter that much if we were just dating but if we were married it could be an issue.|`|vvLC5zaaaa	no it wont if you both love each other, though it might be hard with your families if they dont get along, but if you really love each other, it shouldnt matter|`|wuZXqYPGaa	race should DEFINATELY NOT MATTER... never ever :)<br>  i find it soo great when i see a couple datin that have complete different race.. we need more ppl that arent afriad of societys typical couples. and relgion is kinda a different thing, cuz religion can be someone LIFE whut they base all their values on, so if its a different religion than yours, just accept it or get into it whutevs :)|`|1NPIFIkGaa	No it should'nt, a person is not defined by the color of his skin and religion is just spirituality of self. So as long a your religion makes you content it shoulnt matter what your partner believes. also never push your religion on to others that gets really old quick.|`|KDLAfwgKaa	you shouldnt care about that as long as you guys love or at least like each other everything should be fine.|`|xnJxMaq8aa	Who cares? if you have feeling for them the little things like that shouldnt matter.

That is great for you. Unfortunately, the true cure to the common cold is the essence of time. Just stay strong, stay in-doors, and stay healthy. Another tip is that love is the predominant healing "potion" to a humans body. I am not saying go have sex, but i am saying that love can secure the mental state in which a person suffers. If you realize that someone cares for you it is proven that you will heal faster.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|NpZ5sW0Jaa	1) Go to the doctor of course<br>  2) Drink lots and lots of water, your urine should be pale and plentiful, you should be going lots.<br>  3) Lots of sleep/rest/relaxation - Your body needs time to recharge and repair itself and to get rid of this cold<br>  4) Clear your nose, get rid of anything blocking your airways, A nice hot steamy shower should help with this.<br>  5) You can gargle some salt water to help keep your throat clear, or use some honey dissolved in tea, Because honey is excellent for killing bacteria.<br>  6) Eat healthy. Try to get more vitamin C than usual.<br>  7) Don't stress or strain yourself, Just take it easy.<br>  <br>  Overall I would suggest staying in bed, drinking lots of fluids, keeping your airways clean, making sure you're in a clean environment, and eating well.|`|DjuTSbeqaa	I was just going through the same thing!Ask your parents to take you to the doctor in the morning for some medicine. Get some orange juice (drink a lot, water's good too), take antibiotics, and most importantly, rest. Lay down in your bed with a box of tissues.

You may have to change your sheets in the morning because it will make you sweat it out, but you will be healthy in the morning.  <br>  <br>  But remember, I don't advocate the use of alcohol, this seriously does work, I've seen it work and it does without fail, I just don't do it because I personally couldn't stand the thought of myself drinking.... but|`|b5a3lKFSaa	zicam, cold remedy swabs<br>  they work like magic!  it feels weird shoving a swab up your nose but really, you feel soo much better!  and just remember even after you feel normal, keep doing it for another 2 weeks.  <br>  <br>  hope you feel better :]|`|AA10744666	if you are that sick you need to go to the doctor because i thought i had a cold for like three weeks and it turned out to be bronchitis which was about 1 degree above being pneumonia..|`|v0FLxYVdaa	dude i had the same thing. it was a cold for like 3 weeks. i know it dosent sound like it will help but ALOT of sleep and juices<br>  hope it helps :)|`|yicsOxqWaa	You need to relax.

I wish you wrote that for mee!|`|9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	I liked the general direction of it...it was definitely cliched at times but for a valentines day poem corny isn't that bad.  I also very much liked the closing line.<br>  <br>  I do need to be a grammar nitpick here...you seem to be very confused about how to use the word "that".<br>  <br>  "no radiance except that of the moon" is grammatically sound but "your smile shine[s] like that of the sun" isn't since you're not trying to say that her smile shines like the shine of the sun (the shine of the sun doesn't shine; the sun shines!).  it should be "your smile shines like the sun"<br>  <br>  "i could tell for me, that you were the only one"  has a misplaced "that"; "i could tell that for me, you were the only one" is presumably what you intended to say.<br>  <br>  "...more things than that I have already told you" should be "...more things than that (or those) which I have already told you"  but "...more things than what I have already told you" is fine for informal writing.<br>  <br>  so, if your girlfriend is as much of a grammar nazi as I am, then you now know why she wasn't thrilled with your poem.  Otherwise, I don't really know what to tell you, I honestly thought it was pretty good.<br>  <br>  check out my question if you get a chance: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Av4E2bRZjDyzTxyqWvP1qXbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307170204AACzK40">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|xvbRcg4maa	WOW <br>  <br>  this is SOOOO AMAZING  i would dorp deadd if someone wrote something as cute as this for me|`|zCb9Y9T5aa	yeah, gf needs to appreciate your efforts more than just saying, "oh thats cool", how many guys compose a poem for their girls? she should feel lucky....|`|B7XNIGmiaa	if i where her you were writing that to i would cry and kiss you its romantic but not so much for valentines|`|dIWpXN6gaa	wow<br>  that's really good. but for valentine's day? isn't that awhile off?|`|sgfGvjs0aa	dude you are awesome! my boyfriend writes me poems and they make me feel like the most awesome person in the world. i bet your gf will LOVE it.|`|wRsHdF62aa	that is the sweetest thing!!!!!  ur girlfriend is a butt for not melting into a puddle of love.. i wish someone would write me a poem like that ;)|`|vU3IMRIIaa	Very sweet.

You might be able to get French citizenship, through a passport, and then you won't need a visa, because France is an EU country. <br>  <br>  You would need a residency permit, but that's only when you have your French passport.|`|EAdZnaI6aa	How'd you get here with no passport?

Ff7mCzlPaa	The guy's sisters have nothing to do with the success or failure your sister's marriage.<br>  <br>  neither does your relationship or opinion of the boy's sisters.  <br>  <br>  if they are stuck up and liars, then don't associate with the sisters.<br>  <br>  that's the best you can do.|`|TD5Wqe4maa	You always keep that kind of stuff to yourself.<br>  <br>  You may think her relationship will fail, but that doesn't mean it definitely will. You bringing this up to her would more than likely bequeath her negative and insecure emotions. Not to mention she might become a little angry with you and might think you want it to happen.<br>  <br>  I doesn't even matter about his sisters, they got nothing to do with the success of her relationship and you chances are skinny that you would even see them that much. <br>  <br>  I say you grin and bear it. If she makes a mistake than she makes a mistake; all of us make them and let her make hers for herself. You don't know for a fact it would be anyway.|`|KR1FdEZgaa	i agree with the other person. the legal world is all about the female. i have 2 boys, there 7 & 5. it took me 5 years to get custody and she is abusive. she has 16 cps reports, 5 on physical abuse. i have police reports,sheriff reports, school records and a lot more. and still had all kinds of problems because i am the male parent. if you say something you might have problems with your sister. so talk to your mom and dad, if you want but do not say anything to her.|`|ytGaDM7Haa	It depends on how close you are to your sister, and how you bring it up.<br>  But, it's probably best not to say anything. I'm sure they've thought it over themselves, and is your opinion really going to sway them? Probably not. It will only make you appear to be against them and turn you into a "bad guy".|`|AA11103763	Grin and bear it. You are not the one marrying into that family. You are not always going to like your in-laws, but you will have to deal with them if that boy is your sister's choice.|`|9e3mxs6waa	it's not your place to say anything<br>  she wont listen anyways especially if she "loves" him<br>  so keep your distance who says you have to be involved with them<br>  that's what i do teehee|`|nGwbqpQCaa	i think you should tell your sister how you feel and remind her that she should put her family before anything|`|AwUN5uyIaa	grin and bare it|`|7MtjF084aa	I dont think you should tell your sister simply because if she loves him enough to marry him she's gonna want her sister to be there for her in the time in her life. If you tell her you dont think they will work out she may just begin to despise you..if you really think about it who would want someone telling them that there not going to work out right before they get married? <br>  <br>  if i were you i would just be the best sister that i could..and be there for her when she needs you and IF something comes up in the future (i.e. if he cheats on her) thats when shes going to need you the most... so i would say keep your opinions to yourself for now and let your sister be happy.. <br>  <br>  :-)|`|Re8d6PJkaa	That's really not your decision it's hers and i don't see why his sisters lie to you and if they are doing it to you and your sister then you should but if it's only to you then let her marry him and then take half his money. Or get a group of friends and jump his sisters lol no that;s wrong don't do that.|`|nzaVWIaQaa	you should tell your sister how you feel. sisters know best. and if you have a feeling it won't turn out good, tell her! listen to your feeling! she might be upset, but she'll thank you. besides you don't want her to get a divorce that's worse.|`|vHMgPxc2aa	let your sister decide.she is the one getting married|`|PBUTpWpIaa	you should tell your sister|`|ZvhtPCWQaa	don't worry about it. the american legal system is made in a way where the woman wins no matter what during the divorce, so if anything bad happens, and they get divorced, she'll get half his money.|`|Wb1ydezNaa	I think in relationships like this there is always a flaw that the family will see,but it is really up to the couple to go through and experience their relationship on their own,if it were something like abuse,drugs controlling behavior than I would want to step in and talk to my sister.|`|57j6hSjNaa	This happens alot in families.. A loved one getting married to someone we really may not care for. <br>  <br>  I don't know what gives you the impression their relationship is not going to turn out well, but unless you caught him cheating or knows for a fact he's lying to your sister about a serious matter, then grin and bare it..<br>  <br>  And as for his stuck up sisters.. Your not marrying him or his sisters, so you don't have to deal with them. Don't worry your sister about petty thing like that, because [she] getting married should be a happy occasion for her.<br>  <br>  Your there to be your sister's support system, not their's...|`|RaV7SidDaa	i think if you and your sister are close then you should let her know you feelings before they get married.. because if you hold it all in side then it will only make it worse.. because say they get divorced  and then if you say" man i always knew he wasn't right for you, then she would be all :why didn't you tell me<br>  <br>  Shes your sister.. she will listen|`|hcpgD6hBaa	bare to her...and tell the sister that they do lie to you...it would end up a cruel things with that...|`|hYP6akCYaa	u have to be honest with your family or u will get nowhere

It is far kinder to him to tell him now, rather than go through with it and end up in divorce court.<br>  <br>   This is not your fault - relationships sometimes fail, but I think this is a situation where you started to realize things were not right.  No marriage will fix that - just let him not it's not happening, make sure he goes to speak to his professional, and perhaps let his parents know as well.  This isn't your fault, and it isn't completely yours to fix, either.|`|KSK22vHUaa	Don't stay with someone because they threaten to hurt themself.  That's going to make you feel guilty and bitter.  If he's willing to hurt himself to keep you, that isn't romantic.  It's pathetic.<br>  <br>  If you don't love him, leave.  But don't marry someone and stay with them forever and be miserable so they won't go emo and cut themself or something.  Let him do it if he needs to do that to grieve, but leave if you want to leave.  Don't let him keep you out of guilt.<br>  <br>  Lots of people try to do that--guilt people into staying with them.  It's really crappy.  Don't let it happen!|`|znZxydq5aa	oh love poor u...herez what u do u sit him down and say thiz " sweet heart i love you like the air i breath i just need some time to think ok im not saying no but im allso not saying yes not yet letz just wait it out and ill tell u whene im ready 2 get married." easy and done covered all the basez b-cuz now he knowz u love him and if hez a  real man hell take it like a man and not go emo and do stuff 2 himself <br>  ps. a hand job would probly get him happy.|`|y3XXQm1saa	just b honest with your self..|`|rlUUaSgqaa	You have to be honest with him and leave him.  My sister and my best friend were both in this exact same situation.  They ended up just going along with things until it was too late and they felt like they had to marry the guys.  They both ended up filing for a divorce less than a year later, and if you ask either of them, they would have told you they really wish they'd just left the guy before they married him as it would have made things much easier.|`|89dbda5201b9cd4a4f9e174ecf63f9f7aa	You need to step up and end this situation as soon as possible.  It's not fair to him to keep leading him on.  It'll be a relief once you do the right thing.  Marriage is expensive.  Divorce is even more expensive.  Breaking up with a boy friend is free.|`|85V6cHe4aa	Be honest with him,you say he might do stuff to himself  do you mean harm himself?<br>  <br>  If so its very sad but his well being isn't your responsibility in the sense that you shouldnt feel blackmailed into a marriage you are not sure about,things will only get worse if you marry him and it doesnt work out.<br>  <br>  Time for some straight talking.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	You can't be what he wants.  If he hurts himself, that's not because of you, it's because of something within him that's sick.  You are not responsible for him.<br>  <br>  Tell him the truth gently.  If he threatens to hurt himself or kill himself that's not your responsibility.  That's a sign of his sickness.|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	if there's a possibility that you still love him and are afraid of the commitment part of marriage do one of two things:  one either be honest and tell him that you are not ready for the big step, or two:  have a long engagement to give yourself time to sort your feelings before you kick the dude to the curb.<br>  <br>  so down. dont be in such a hurry. if he's rushing you, then speak up.|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	Time for you to worry about your life and not what will or won't make him happy or sad.

b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	How about a little compromising on both sides you know give a little take a little. You both can't have it your own way your marriage will never last. Talk it out that's the key don't just let her walk away if you do you will pay for it for the rest of your life. Thinking everyday what if !|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I would get marriage counseling and also just continue being open with her about everything.  Good luck.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	You meed to be in COUPLES counseling with her. I was an addict, and you don't sound like one, but you do have an obsession to use porn as a aspirin occasionally, which is still problematic. Find something else to use a release. Something that you can do out in the open for all to see, like softball, racquetball, music or oooh lightbulb---- dancing lessons with the wife! You'd be suprised how much crud you can work out with a swing dancing.|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	marriage is about give and take. if it bothers her that much, then what do you value more? her or your porn addiciton? <br>  <br>  i would seek counseling, not just for the marriage but also for the porn addiction. i dont like porn myself, because i would prefer for my husband to get off watching ME, not some stranger doing crazy stuff in the bed with other strangers. but that's my opinion, and to each his own....|`|KSK22vHUaa	Uhh, why is it wrong for you to look at porn?  Every guy I've ever dated looks at porn.  I'm a plus size woman.  It doesn't make me feel inadequate.  It's just what guys do!  They look at porn!<br>  <br>  I'm assuming she's around your age, but dear if she's too immature to just understand that this is something guys DO, she's not worth keeping.  She won't grow out of something like that very easily.  <br>  <br>  Guys watch porn, scratch themselves in public, and don't take subtle hints.  That's just how guys are.  It isn't something to change in them, it's something to accept.  If it's that big of a deal to her, she needs to check herself, not make you stop.|`|dQrBlk4qaa	You have to realize on major thing - your watching porn is an addiction - you are looking to that "release" just as an alcoholic looks to a drink for a distraction from your stresses. <br>  <br>  You and your wife should have a discussion about your habit on this level - that you need to find a way to cope with the depth of this addiction, and a willing partner who will help you find a constructive outlet for your need to escape reality for a few minutes. <br>  <br>  She also has to realize that this is not your need to be unfaithful - it seldom is, and that you are merely practicing escapism. <br>  <br>  Good luck - dealing with issues like this is seldom easy. Maybe you can do it alone, and maybe you need a therapist - it depends upon you and what you think you need to get this done before your marriage ends!|`|ixRkfLjIaa	You married someone who hates something you like.  <br>  <br>  Also I would guess that there are other problems and that if porn was the only problem you two had then the marriage wouldn't be failing.<br>  There's probably lots of people who wish that the worse thing about their spouse was that they watched porn.<br>  <br>  Look at your question, you sound like a kid being caught by his mother.|`|a09f31fab9e4e5a637346b086ea3ef92aa	Porn is very addictive,and destructive as those porn stars are getting so freaking hot! it is very hard to find a match for them in real life!<br>  <br>  My advice would be to delete/stay away from all porn access you got, and use your time doing other stuff, even stay away from the computer if you can ,and resort to your wife for your needs, no cold screen with sound can replace a touch of a woman's body.|`|874EAxkfaa	you lied to her because you are only 20yrs old! both of you need to mature, so you won't feel the panic,then lie. divorce? give me a break, every time you have a problem ,is the remedy going to be divorce? marriage takes a lot of EFFORT by both of you,learn to communicate with each other an stop acting like babes in the woods!|`|0PdYYeBFaa	wow...okay she wants to divorce you over watching porn.<br>  <br>  Well sorry i am shocked...i like watching porn myself and so does my husband. We watch it both together as a matter. But in regards to your situation your wife should try to understand as it should be a comprise from both sides. Can't you tell her that watching porn will allow you to establish further ways of pleasuring her in different positions.<br>  <br>  I don't know|`|bea2c50e30c8c234aeb6e88e02424208aa	Whether or not it is an "addiction" is entirely beside the point. That's a question of semantics.<br>  <br>  If it's causing strife in your marriage, it's a PROBLEM.<br>  If you're lying to your wife about it, it's a PROBLEM.<br>  If you know it's a problem and want to change, but keep going back anyway, then it's DEFINITELY a problem. A lack of trust in your relationship is something you should take very seriously.<br>  <br>  I agree with "D"s answer. The question isn't whether or not it wrong, or whether it's an addiction, the question is this: How much do you love your wife? How much do you respect her wishes? Which do you value more, your wife, or porn?<br>  <br>  "Building trust" is easy. <br>  1) Don't lie. <br>  2) If you say you're not going to do something, DON'T DO IT. <br>  3) If you *do* lie or do something you said you wouldn't, then admit your mistake and ask for forgiveness. Nobody's perfect.<br>  <br>  Now, I've also got a few suggestions. The first is not to use the computer if you're home alone, or better yet, cancel your internet connection if possible. (If you were on a diet, would you go to the store and buy a bunch of junk food to fill your pantry? Hopefully not.) "Discretion is the better part of valor" ~William Shakespeare<br>  <br>  The second is whenever you feel like watching porn, go call your wife instead and tell her you love her, or something....that's a good way to heal your relationship instead of damaging it. There are other ways of relieving stress, for example, ask your wife for a shoulder rub.....<br>  <br>  anyways, good luck.
AA10065812	???????<br>  He's under stress, both from becoming a new father, and not knowing if he's going to have a job next week to feed his family with.  This is the absolute worse time to start a family.  Add to this, if he's under 30, he was not ready for this decision.

Counseling would a great idea however he needs to be open to the idea. It sounds as though he is most certainly having and affair and may have already emotionally checked out of the relationship. However, you will not know until he is honest with you. I would give it a try, but if he is unwilling to work on the relationship. Then you need to do what is best for you and the child. And that is to be happy and not cheated on or treated like a door mat. Good luck.|`|xUCXXb73aa	he is feeling the pressure.|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	did you tell him that his relationship with this chick is offensive to you? we women know the games that women play. and any chick knows that its not right to be closer to a dude than his woman. it is so hard to convince men that women play cat games-some out of spite, some because that is what they do, some because they really want your man. <br>  <br>  i would consider counseling. if it dont work out (and believe me this is NOT what i wish for any couple) you can rest in the fact that you tried all of your resources.<br>  <br>  change has to be an individual decision. i would hope he sees the value in his family to want to do so. especially with a precious little newborn baby.<br>  <br>  best wishes...and i really mean that...|`|LT5HlW3kaa	I don't think you should find out what the other girl is doing that you are not. That is crazy. It sounds like he is just taking you forgranted. I would not put up with him texting and talking on the phone with any girl. Stand firm and tell him like it is! If he doesn't want to stop drinking and talking down to you. Take your baby and go, and any place would be better than putting up with that.|`|a09f31fab9e4e5a637346b086ea3ef92aa	you need to have a serious talk with him about this.<br>  there is a baby involved and his duty as a family man and a father is to take responsibility and address his issues of possible flirting and drinking and stuff.<br>  <br>  I hope a long understanding talk with him will get him to his senses.|`|uUjQBKQaaa	He may not have been ready to be a daddy. You decided TOGETHER to start a family? Without getting married first?If he is willing to go to counseling, i would do that, or go by yourself.What he is doing is unacceptable.|`|3iNobwVraa	You can't take off across the country even if you want to--you can't just leave with a child that is also his.  <br>  <br>  Ask him to be honest with you.  Explain how you are feeling and what you are contemplating.  If he tells you they honestly are just friends, believe him.  It does happen!  <br>  <br>  Ask him if you guys can all go out together.  This may help you resolve your concerns.  All of the changes in his behavior may be because of the baby.  Newborn are stressful, no one is sleeping, and life is different in every way.  Don't compound these stresses by jumping to extreme conclusions.  BTW, if you are feeling 'not yourself,' you should talk to your Doctor.  Don't keep quiet, post partum depression is a very big problem.  Don't suffer in silence.|`|C6jxKYu8aa	First of all....I am very sorry that this has happened to you. Are you sure that you are not just suffering from post par tum depression? Sometimes that can really do a number on you. Talk, Talk, Talk is my best advice. Find out the truth and go from there. If he is truly talking and conspiring with someone else, then you must do what is right for your baby and get joint custody. The two of you should get together enough to at least love this baby and give the child the best of both of your worlds. In a perfect world, you and this man would have married and made this beautiful baby out of committed love. Since this obviously isn't the perfect world scenario, you must do what is second best and make the baby's best interest come first now. Be sure to BOTH be in this baby's life and be constructive in the baby's raising between the both of you. God bless the baby.......|`|FU4TyghIaa	wow, that's heavy for you to handle Rachel.<br>  The only thing i could think is that maybe, with the baby and everything, he's not sure he wants that in his life or just feels that you're not the lover you used to be and he's looking for that elsewhere instead.<br>  Then he turns to drinking and putting you down?<br>  He is having trouble coming to grips with the parenting deal?<br>  Unless there's something else going on.<br>  Maybe he does want you to go to the other side of the country?  Sounds like he's trying to send you there with all that behaviour.  <br>  You ask therapy?  Therapy can't just be lumbered on him.  He has to want it.<br>  Maybe the other side of the country would hammer home what he stands to lose if he doesn't come up to scratch?<br>  It's up to you, and you know the situation, i really don't.<br>  Good luck, with the bub and everything you need support more than anything.  Can't he see that, do you tell him?<br>  <br>  Actions speak louder than words.  After six years maybe he's taking you for granted?  And with the child and everything changing he's resentful of that?  <br>  <br>  Can't answer it, nobody could.  Not with a question and an answer deal.  There's too much at stake.<br>  Good luck.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	You aren't the one who needs therapy.  between the two of you, it seems he could use it more.<br>  <br>  i'm not trying to be rude but i can't believe women these days who have kids without a commitment.  I wouldn't do it.  Too much at stake, and there is no true and solid commitment between the two of you without being married.<br>  <br>  I'm not against people having kids without being married, but i am against making a decision like this with someone who isn't terribly stable.<br>  <br>  You are also enabling him to behave this way by caretaking.  You say you could go to the other side of the country but "don't want to do that to him" -- as if he considers your feelings?  I don't see that he gives a damn. <br>  <br>  Do what is in your best interest.  And if you have to attend therapy for a while to 'see' what is going on in the relationship and to find direction, then do so.<br>  <br>  all the best.|`|YHcyuka3aa	Well ind-sight is 20/20 but the wedding should have been first.I would confront the girl and tell her is has a child to help you raise and that she is interfering. You can't run from him nor the situation your in. He needs to help support the child so make sure you see a lawyer or make sure he does his part. I am not sure you would want to be married to someone like him so while the baby is still young, make your mind up that this child is your responsibility and he is just a jerk. Concentrate on your life and the child's and let him know that he will help support and then leave him.|`|znZxydq5aa	uh sorry love but i think ur lover boy is bloody bipolor or he could just be insane yea thatz not puting ur kid at risk at all....but no take it from me love u really dnt want him aroun if hez acting thiz way and cheeting on u i mean u have a bloody child now for godz sake!!!!!|`|jpimg8doaa	First of all this is a boyfriend which means he doesn't want to marry you if he hasn't yet.  Get rid of him and try to collect child support.  If he can afford a cell phone he can afford to support his child|`|GYoNyoWtaa	COMMUNICATION is the key.<br>  Find out what your not giving him that the other woman is. <br>  Is she talking more to him?<br>  Paying him more attention.<br>  <br>  TALK TO HIM...FIND OUT....|`|IvMPh09baa	so how do you feel about deciding on a family with no ring on your finger and also at a very young age now?  Didn't quite work out the way you thought now did it.... you are the prime example why people should not start families first off without a stable married partner and also why they shouldnt have children so young... this kind of crap happens... and guess who suffers, the baby!
6090e9e976038fa53ea3ba180daa45adaa	He's just someone that wants revenge... he doesn't have much of a life so he wants to fill it with hate ... it somehow makes him feel like he has power when he can get a reaction out of you.  Ignore him and he will eventually go nuts (no more feelings of control)....|`|V8L1OhH5aa	rockbottom his candy ***!|`|PVR0y9eOaa	boys lie... a lot especially about who they like or he just has mixed feelings maybe he likes you, but doens't see you two going out maybe YOU try and make the move or tell him how you feel bout him (if you life him) or you can try and asks him why the heck he stares at you!|`|zbSBwhDhaa	I don't know what YOU think... But rats are H-O-T. Jk But in all seriousness STALKER. Or like some other peope have said he has no clue what he ever saw in you and thinks you're hideous, but I don't think that ones an option.|`|2MtDp74raa	He either is lying, or he REALLY doesnt like you.|`|1NPIFIkGaa	He just doesnt like you and if your still wasting your time on him youll end up looking like the crazy one...move on!!!|`|GRegSLA4aa	Weird how? I mean... you usually know by a look if the guy likes yo or not. And maybe, all guy's plans are to mke one jealous by flrtin with another - so uncool and so old. Hey, normally "ratty" lookin girls have a great personality (lmao - yes I am spiteful and ...), but they normally know how to have a good time, that's what gets him :/ <br>  watever. you shouldn't have 2 crushes :/ that's just plain weird. In my opinion. I mean you have the guy you like, then the good looking guy, then the friendly guy etc... but the crush is that stupid idiot who is all that is good and all that is bad for you. suckish. <br>  don't give yur friend any mind, if you don't pay attention to it and act like your friend is just bein an idiot then he wont notice wat she says. but if you react then OBVIOISLY it affected you ... basic girl's ehaviour rules... you learn them as ythe world begins to be a ... unpleasant place to you :/ <br>  ... i get wat you feel. mleh. just act like yu dont give a damn.|`|7GL815olaa	it is strange huh well I think he likes u or u being funny. if U don say anything that iant that funny n  he stares at ya wierdly again well he likes u. well the best way to get a guy talk is u to flirt with another guys  and talk about how other guys look and every thing when he is around. it works cause my gf did that to me to get me talk and I did cause I could not take it any more.|`|wp7vdcLCaa	... why does it matter? If he said he didn't like you then you are better off without him. Don't be so involved with what he thinking. What do you think? I mean he had his chance and he rejected you so just be the wonderful person you are and if he really does like you he will have to up his game just to be with you.<br>  I hope you figure things out!|`|vU3IMRIIaa	If he said he didn't like you that way and then is trying to make you jealous by talking to someone else that means you don't need him, he can't tell the truth and he plays head games.

QqSDskeRaa	im in the same dilemma. my friend who ive known for like nine years (since first grade) is a lesbian and i has a crush on her. she has a girlfriend but that relationship doesn't seem to be going too well. i think you should have a talk with her and see how she feels about it. if she likes you back than you'll be glad you said something. if not than you wont wonder what if for the remainder of your life with her. if she's a good friend (and im assuming she is) then she will be honest no matter what her feelings are.<br>  <br>  i say go for it. tell her how you feel.<br>  meanwhile- i will take my own advice and do the same. i wish you luck. could you do the same for me?|`|Vv7a31pmaa	The Bisexual thing matters not.<br>  <br>  Reduce it to a simplier thought.<br>  <br>  This is my friend and i want to date them.<br>  <br>  it will be wierd because your current relationship with her will color her thoughts of you.<br>  <br>  you just need to talk it out with her.<br>  <br>  do not give up friendship if she turns you down.
dYSjzqPSaa	My mother 'n sister are like that (my mom is actually freaking out at my father right now...i'm trying to keep it from turning in to an all out war..) best thing you can do is ignore it (as long as it's only verbal, if it gets physical call the police or tell an adult). Some ppl are very temperamental, yelling back just makes then angrier. If you calmly apologize and walk away they can't do anything. As for the spider/garden thing, a computer is a privilege. You don't need it, so if he says no computer then no computer but you need to eat to survive lol so he has no right to tell you that you can't. I highly doubt he'll let you starve over some thing that minor. Lots of times when parents say things like that, they're just blowing off steam. If you actually grew up with a mother like mine, you would be great full for your father. Not saying my life is THAT bad, 'cus it could be a lot worse but if you only have one angry father to deal with be thank full. Not saying it's healthy to have parents like that but you can't change the way people are, you can just adapt to it and remember you'll never be that way with your children. If anything it'll teach you to be a better father when you get older. Know that your father does love you and is proud of you, some parents have a hard to time saying it for whatever the reason. My mother acts the way she does because she grew up in an unstable home and was abused. Your father may have grew up in an enviornment like that, try to sit down with him and explain how much your hurting. Maybe he'll realize yelling isn't the answer to everything. Anyway good luck, hope you get everything sorted out with your father :)|`|AcgDcQG0aa	I suggest that you ask a counselor at your school about it.<br>  <br>  There is not much a kid like you can do about it.  Because at 13 years of age you are still completely dependent on your parents.  And they do have authority over you.<br>  <br>  But a school counselor might be able to help you in some way.  Perhaps the counselor might even talk with your parents and persuade your father to be a little more nice and less aggressive.|`|c5b60ac3242a47478e9f3294c17cf65faa	Talk to your school counselor.<br>  Request the phone numbers and URL's<br>  of  "abuse"  hot lines.<br>  The Catholic church has one.<br>  Even if you're not Catholic, any priest can<br>  point you in the right direction.<br>  Also check out abuse against children<br>  on  your computer's search engine.|`|ZtyqiUwCaa	omigosh i dont think its ur fault maybe go to someone you can open up to like a councler or a teacher talk to someone does he ever hit you if he does immediatly call 911 or ur mom especially if he hits her|`|lVIdENvqaa	The above answers are very good advice.<br>  I grew up with a very abusive father who never gave me or my siblings a good word. All he did was call us degrading names and never showed us any love. With him in the house it was a constant scream at one of us or mom.<br>  In the 50's and 60's there was no such thing as a child advocate or Casa or child protective services of any kind in our area so we had to suffer with the problem of abuse.<br>  I blame my father for the mental problems that my family members have now. There was nothing we could do and no one seemed to know what we went through because our father was so nice to others but the devil at home.<br>  So, if you believe you are being abused, please get help from someone.<br>  Don't grow up like many others who think they have no control over their young lives.

He is trying break you both up it sounds like. <br>  He is hoping you keep complaining to your boyfriend about him, and your boyfriend will get sick and tie rd of the BS .<br>  What do bully's' like?  A REACTION: The friend is getting your attention, he is getting you mad, he is getting you all worked up over lies he is telling. These are all reactions. I wonder how much he will keep it up when you stop reacting?
JhvqUvlsaa	Your boyfriend's brother shouldn't be touching you and making those comments. Tell your boyfriend that you don't like it and that it creeps you out and that you don't want to hang out at his house anymore. I am afraid that if you keep going over there when  he's home that it could escalate. So just hang out at your house or around town or at school. Get away from this guy; this is not okay! =)|`|DuGAysygaa	Tell your boyfriend!|`|AA11103763	You need to stay away from him (the brother) and talk to your boyfriend and your parents about him. His behavior could escalate to something worse.|`|CRozjN6vaa	Tell him his appalling behavior is the reason his little brother will always have the love life he dreams about.|`|AA10785723	Maybe his brother is just being funny with inside joke and if he's not tell your mom or tell your boyfriend you dont want to be with him when his brothers around|`|vvLC5zaaaa	yeah tell your boyfriend, or ask your mom what is best to do

He wouldn't do all that if he didn't.|`|ZoeS825Kaa	yeah you guys should totally bang|`|yCMrOQE9aa	yeah it sounds like he does<br>  he probably keeps denying it because he isnt sure if you do too|`|Vv7a31pmaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Show more interest.|`|2z5yV9Jraa	I'm not sure about LOVE, but i have to say, i think he definitely likes you. He shows signs of paying attention to you more, even when you two are around other friends. And getting calls from him, even if theyre just for a minute, are always a good sign. It probably means he just wants to hear your voice.<br>  <br>  I think you should just go for it. Be spontaneous, and ask him straight out if he would want to go on a date sometime. Confidence is a great quality
2M68xiN5aa	It sounds like you are in the phase after a break up where you are extremely vulnerable and not making clear decisions.....we've all been there. If you ask me the friend you went home with TOTALLY took advantage of the situation. Even had you not had sex with him he should NOT have gotten you undressed even if he was taking care of you while you were drunk! My best GAY friend wouldn't have even done that.....you body is private and he shouldn't have done that without you being coherant to consent.....it's embarassing which I'm sure you know. <br>  <br>  Talk to BOTH of your friends about it. Be honest with both of them but especially with the guy you are interested in. I would tell him (your friend you are interested in) that it was a drunken mistake and you are very vulnerable right now. Try not to get too emotionally involved with anyone right now....after a long term relationship has ended you aren't able to clearly make decisions about romance. Personally, I didn't get into a serious relationship after I divorced my ex (we were together for 5 years also) until 2 years after my divorce.....that's not to say that is how long you should wait that was just what was right for me. <br>  <br>  When you are in such a long term relationship you adapte and change. Once it ends you need to figure out things and do thing for yourself. Don't cheat yourself of this time to heal, process, and figure things out.|`|tnQOy5kdaa	I think you shoudn't feel guilty because you were drunk. if the other guy you like more knows this happened, subtly say that you regret it because you like "someone" else. If he doesn't knwo, he doesn't need to. It's not like you cheated or anything|`|vuEyUbsgaa	Calm down on your drinking|`|PpYl2dFVaa	wow<br>  umm <br>  i am at a loss for words but pretty sure you blew your chances with the other guy|`|OxtDZOyuaa	You probably hurt your chances with the other guy, but i wouldnt say you blew it. You still have a chance if  you explain the whole situation to him and everything that happened. If you like him, tell him that and say that you kinda wanna take it slow because you just came out of a different relationship. You really need to slow down on the whole drinking deal, that is terrible for your health and it will make you do things you regret, like in this case.|`|wp7vdcLCaa	... In my honest opinion... You sound like you are in a bad place right now. You should try to get to know yourself sober... and maybe find a healthy respect for yourself. Breaking a relationship that has been going on for that long can really mess a person up. So I would say slow down... Relax... find out what is really going on inside of your head and try to become a strong person..<br>  I hope everything works out for you!|`|txrItklBaa	the guy who helped you the night you were drunk seems the more considerate type.. give him a chance.. and since you just came out of a long relationship it seems that your choosing the guy who you wouldn't become emotionally attached too..|`|xMnN99T8aa	Alcohol and relationships.

It is a well-known scientific fact that the human brain doesn't fully develop until 25 and you aren't always able to make adult decisions before then. Plus your whole outlook on life changes at 25. It is also a well-known fact that very few if any people who are 18-24 can tell you without a doubt that they know what they want from life and still want the same thing a few months or years down the road. <br>  <br>  If you beat the odds, good for you. But you will be a rarity if you do.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	People are judgmental of young marriages because so many couples that marry young end up divorced.  And those who have lived through their twenties insist that you grow up and change so much during that decade and they assume that there's no way the things you want now are the things you'll want when you're 30.  They also assume that the things your boyfriend wants will change, and no doubt, the things each of you want when you're 30 won't be compatible and you'll just end up unhappy or divorced.  I don't agree with all of that.  I was 21 when my husband and I got engaged and 22 when we got married.  He was 23.  We're both still in our twenties and yes, things change.  You have children, you finish college, you begin working, life happens.  But you go through those changes together and you work through any issues that arise together.  Keyword being together.  It can work if both of you are willing to make it work.  But a lot of times young couples don't put in all the effort it takes to make it work.  They hit a rough patch and give up.  That's not how a marriage works.  But unfortunately, that's what happens and people tend to focus on the negative.  <br>  <br>  There are also those who believe that marriage ties you down and you can't truly experience all there is to life if you're married.  And of course, you're supposed to gain those life experiences while you're young, like in your twenties (as if life stops and new experiences don't exists once you hit 30).  I can't tell you how many people questioned why I was marrying so young when I announced that I was engaged.  They said I should travel, experience life, blah, blah, blah.  Well I already had my Bachelor's degree and was working full time so being able to support myself wasn't the issue.  And all the things they said I should experience while I'm young, I wanted to experience with my husband.  Marriage hasn't held me back or tied me down at all.  It makes me happy to know that I have someone that I love who loves me supporting me and sharing in those many life experiences.  <br>  <br>  So from another "married young" I say, ignore the pessimists who think we're making a mistake by marrying at our age.  And now, I'll get off of my soap box...:)|`|8IA3d3NNaa	I'm 20 and my fiance just turned 21 on Feb 28th, we have been together for four years in June 2009, five years when we are going to get married next june no one inside our family thinks we are too young, as we have been together for quite some time, and lived together for most of our relationship, we have been independently living on our own since July 2006 (a week after I turned 18). In my opinion it really depends on the couple, if the people telling you that you are too young, outside the family or outside of people who REALLY, know you, screw them, they don't know you or your fiance's relationship with you.<br>  <br>  Good luck. =)|`|AA10802202	I have no idea. My boyfriend and I have been dating since I was 15 (I'm almost 18 now), and we have a wedding date in June 2010. I can objectively look at our relationship and attest to the fact that we are more stable than some couples years older. I would be the first to vouch for anyone's "right" to get married--in any case, age is hardly a factor worth being nasty over, when you look at how much it takes to make a marriage work.|`|PfE6bg5iaa	I'm 21 and my fiance is 22. We're getting married May 2010 after almost 8 years of dating. I'm graduating college this December and he's graduating next April.<br>  <br>  I haven't really experienced any negativity about how young we are, mostly because we've been together for 6 years and living together for 2. What I have experienced tho, is that family are so used to us being bf/gf that they're somehow shocked that we're engaged now. I guess they thought we were just going to be bf/gf forever haha.<br>  <br>  I think that you're experiencing trouble for two reasons (not that I necessarily agree).<br>  1. you haven't been together that long. A year and a half for young couples doesn't seem long enough. Basically, there's so much changing left as far as personality goes. And being in a committed relationship in college makes it very difficult to balance school, your relationship, and having a social life with friends. Socially, many young people in these types of relationships are "stunted" because they only know how to hang out with one person -- their S.O.<br>  <br>  2.Young marriages have a bad name! There's so many 16 year olds that get on here and indignantly say "I'm getting married and we're going to start having babies. What do you think about that!?" It just proves their immaturity, you know? Like they're just being little kids in puppy love throwing temper tantrums. I think there's generally a growing problem in society, kids are growing up too fast! I mean, go back to your hometown and look at the 4th graders and think about how you were in 4th grade. Those kids in my hometown are *way* past the boys have cooties stage. I know 18 year old girls that graduate high school and think it's time to get married, buy a house, and have kids. <br>  <br>  It's rare, but it sounds like you are one of the couples that is actually mature and have a promising future. But I think you should just ignore the nay-sayers. Maybe it's that I'm one year your senior ;-) but I've learned that it's near impossible to change someone and usually not worth it to even let them rile you up and say something. If you really don't mind being b*tchy, just tell them "You know, I really appreciate your interest but I think we're doing just fine thanks." in a snotty tone. They'll get the point, but maybe don't expect a gift from them!<br>  <br>  I'm sure you've heard it before, but just be aware that it's VERY hard to go back to school after you've been out for a while and started your married life. Just something to consider.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|hMavMBo4aa	Because most people probably felt and sounded exactly like you when they got married the first time lol.<br>  That's close to me.  We're 22 and 23 now (married at 21/22).  He finished school before we married, and I'm graduating in May.  Everything else is a "ditto."<br>  I think most people probably just change a lot in their twenties....I don't know, though...I'm still too young.|`|0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	A lot of people think that young people don't know what they're getting into. From what I've read, it sounds to me like you've got a good head on your shoulders. I can't really come up with anything you can say to change their minds. But, as time goes on and your relationship is still going on strong, they'll know they were wrong. Just prove them wrong, that's all I can tell you.|`|Likst1Mxaa	Because you're still young! travel, study, finish study, DO STUFF before you make a huge committment, get a house, have kids. That's the advice that my granddad gave me.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	They are skeptical because the divorce rate is very high for young marriages.|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	The answer is in the facts. The truth being that the majority of couples that marry under the age of 25 are more likely to end up in divorce than couples that wait until they are older.<br>  <br>  But if you feel that you are ready then that is your prerogative and no one else's business. But just because you are very much in love doesn't mean that you are mature enough for the complications of marriage. I suggest taking a marriage / couples counseling before you marry. It will help you tackle the tough decisions you will confront.<br>  <br>  When people give you a hard time, just tell them you appreciate their concern but you do not agree, then walk away.|`|3MDY29gnaa	I am 20 and i am engaged. Well i'll be 21 on monday! But i've been with my fiance for 5years. We were best friends growing up and everyone has been so supportive. I think it really doesnt matter what other people say because it's you and him in the end. I do however have a problem with woung couples getting married just to do it. A year and a half isn't that long, but i am nobody to judge. I myself just needed to be 100% sure. Lot's of young couples get divorced because they thought they were ready. And that gives a bad name for marriages. Now people look at all young couples and say "it's not going to work" Just because of the chunk of youngins that messed up. I know i am 100% sure, we both are that's why were comfortable with it. We dont care what everyone else thinks. This is our marriage. Some people say that you "change" around 21-24 but u just think that's bullsh*t. If your not comfortable and are out and not in with your "husband/ fiance" Then you have no business being married. Some people are just assholes. But i say if you and he are comfortable, then go for it! You must be 100% sure Though, not even 99% will work because you must put in your all. <br>  I hope i helped out a little bit. <br>  If you need anything or need advice feel free to email me!|`|Q3ibC4Rnaa	When you look at the stats, they're against you, that's why. A lot of young couples don't make it. But that isn't to say they all don't. Plus our generation is changing. I've been with my guy for over 7years and we're getting married next weekend. It's more common for couples to wait until after college and to have long relationships before jumping into marriage. <br>  <br>  You're marriage is about you and your fiance. Don't worry about other people, if you've talked about the big questions such as money, kids, religion, future careers, where you wish to live, so on, and believe you can still make it work - then go for it. It's your choice! <br>  <br>  On a personal note - my mother married her first time at 16 and got married a 2nd time to my Dad at 19. He was 22 but that only lasted 8 years. So before the time my mother was 30 she had already been divorced 2x. Again, the stats are against you, and stories like mine aren't too uncommon. But - again - this doesn't mean that my mom's story is your story - only you and your fiance can know that!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|TDPX04jtaa	i think its just because most people our age ARE still immature and dont realize all the aspects of being married...i got married at 18 and divorce at 20 because the guy i married was still very immature. i was ready but he wasnt.  now i am getting remarried at 23.   you know what you feel and that you are ready so no one elses opinion matters.  are these negitive people in bad relationships or divorced??  they may have a biest opinion because of there own life experiences but that doesnt mean what happened to them will happen to you....|`|vyL7yEleaa	alot of people look at one thing.. they look at the age and think that anyone under the age of 25 is still to immature and are just reacting off emotions. they don't look at the person them selves they just look at the age. <br>  <br>  my parents were the same way because my fiance and myself have a 4 year age gap and my dad keeps saying that even though he is only 4 years younger then me he is 9 years younger maturity wise and that was before he ever met him! now it was upgraded to 5 years younger on the maturity aspect. a lot of young teens that think they are in love general aren't.. i fell for that whole looking through rose colored glasses as my dad used to say with my ex. we got engaged at 15 (him 16) and were suppose to marry when i was 19, we got tied down way to young and in turn to rebel against that my ex started to drink heavily when he went into the military and smoke and had been cheating on me for years. after living it that is why i am against 18 and under marriages.. 19..i can't say anything since my fiance is 19.. and 20 and older i have no problem with most kids by that time have already gotten a taste of life. <br>  <br>  but most older people will just look at the age. don't let them get to you. do what makes you happy no matter what the old fuss buckets think|`|7d3edabfdc27c4ba2c6cd571f70d965daa	As someone who got engaged fairly early myself, in my experience people are judgemental because in most cases, young marriages fail because the two people were too immature to be in a real marriage.  <br>  <br>  As far as dealing with the people who criticize you, you shouldn't have to unless they're your family, which you said they're fine with it, or your friends.  If anyone else criticizes you, you have every right to just shake your head and walk away.  It's your life, and they have no right to judge.<br>  <br>  Make completely sure that you've covered every single base with him before you really decide to get married though.  Marriage is tough, and that's why most older people criticize.  They think it's too difficult for young people to deal with.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|l4bPFEhUaa	I am in the same situation as you! The difference is I'm 17 and my boyfriend/fiance is 18. We are in no hurry to have children (and take precautions not to!). Our main goal is our careers. We are also both in college and working on a degree in nursing. We have announced to everyone that we are getting married in July, after I turn 18 and no one can just be happy for us. We also are not like most people our age, we were both pushed to be mature and responsible at a young age. We also experienced a life threatening car accident last year. It really let us know how short life can be. No one understands that we have the right goals in mind and are simply getting married because we love each other and want to be together for the rest of our lives.<br>  <br>  It makes me upset that everyone is so quick to judge, without looking into who people really are.<br>  <br>  We just ignore people (politely) We let them know that for us there is no reason to wait and that's all that matters. We let them know that we have our goals set in the right place and that getting married isn't going to change that for us. <br>  <br>  Good luck! Hope hearing of another one in your position helps out!

RuJhWnS5aa	The things you've done to him make you sound a wee bit immature.  And him too, in that respect.  One of the hardest love lessons a girl can learn is that sometimes, certain guys are better off without us - especially if we KNOW we're crazy.  The things he has to worry about now are much more serious.  If you keep toying with his heart, you'll only be a painful distraction for him.  He'll need a clear mind over there.  <br>  <br>  If you want to apologize, that might be a good idea.  But don't expect him to want to be with you.  You hurt him.  Just ask yourself if you think you can change.  Hopefully you can, and you two can find happiness.<br>  <br>  If you write him letters, or e-mail him, just be honest and open and try not to be overly dramatic.

You have been together over a year. That means you started dating her when she was Eleven. Okay lets try to look at this from another vantage. <br>  <br>  You are 17 and she is 12. When you are 18 she will be 13 and you will go to Jail. Or you are 21 and at the Bars and she is 16, but wait you will not be drinking. You will be in Jail. Someone will report you and you will be rotting in prison getting to know your new Butt Buddy Bubba. <br>  <br>  I think you Mom just doesn't want you to get Butt raped and is being protective. If I were you I would care just as much about your *** as she does and stop dating her.|`|A5p9g4tMaa	First of all It is Inappropriate for you to date a preteen when you are almost and adult when your 20 she will only be 15 kinda young for an adult to be with a child. But I understand your mother not liking her I think she just feels you should date someone your own age. If you truly love this girl you will be willing to put the relationship on hold to cool off for awhile. your mother will always be there for you a 12 year old girl can't hell she is just hitting puberty. at your girl friends age there is no way she even truly can love a man and understand what that means. Hell most people don't understand till there in there twenty's.|`|Jly7xMU6aa	i feel your pain. Firstly the next time she comes over watch how they both interact with one another and look for the things that your mom says she's rude about. And be open to truthful criticism. Dont let nething go because she's your girlfriend. I want you to prove your  mom wrong but you have to be open to finding out if what your mom is saying  is the truth or if  she's making everything up. Understand. Could you let me know what the outcome is?|`|AA10407839	I agree with sean s...<br>  She's probably ecstatic with you cuz you're so much older and thats cool for her.<br>  <br>  But to answer your question just tell her not to worry about your mum cuz its not her fault really. Just tell your mum that she's very important to you and your mum needs to respect that and not be so rude, at least be civil in front of her. Tell her you understand but she needs to see your point of view as well.|`|TrwsmIy0aa	tell your mom to put up with it. you love this girl, and she loves you. it really doesnt matter about the age difference (just dont get caught) if your love is genuine, tell your mom to accept it.<br>  your mom may not like her, but she is not your moms girlfreind!<br>  <br>  tell her mate<br>  go for it!<br>  pearants should respect your choise, not slate it!|`|DUneZEEXaa	i agree with rosebunnie. I think you should talk to your mom and ask her how she feels about the situation. then talk to your gf and try to make her understand . You will have some bad times but u will be onceagain happy very soon.|`|8bP67U8Taa	She is 12 and yall are in "love" you mean puppy love.. She is not even a teenager yet.. Goodness date someone your own age. I would not let my 12 year daughter to date.. WAyyyyy to young|`|6hZTGCKXaa	Man, your lying.
Mubj1o2eaa	Sweetie, it isnt your fault. Just because your not interested, doesn't mean it's your fault at all. The guy you turned down's friend is a total jerk. So you should be glad you said no, esspecially since he did that. Imagine what he would do if you were dating him and broke up with him! You should confront him saying, "Hey pal. I feel sorry for you. Your never going to get a girl by that stupid stunt you pulled to make me look shallow. Your the shallow one, because you pulled something like that. You probably will never get a girl, and you will be lonely for the rest of your life if you keep that up. You already looked shallow for doing that, so that might have ruined your chances of finding anyone." Don't wait for a reply, just turn your head and walk away. If it helps, bring some friends to stick by yor side. You shouldn't feel bad, it wasnt your fault. (p.s, make sure you say it infront of a lot of people, so he will be sure not to do it again :p)Good luck =)|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	First off, it's not like you told the guy, sorry, I'm taken, or something along those lines. You told him you weren't interested and wanted to be friends. basically that still leaves you available to date anyone you want. So, with that being said, it's terrible the better looking friend went behind his friend's back (I sure hope I've read your story right) just to make him look bad. I wouldn't feel sorry for him, because that might make you go on a date with him and give him false hope. basically, I would have punched the guy who asked you out, and you said yes to, in the face for being such a terrible friend.|`|8Xk8vItYaa	if you weren't interested then you shouldn't feel bad. as for the whole prank, kids get pranked all the time it's not your fault.|`|JjS4ARPYaa	I have no idea, that was crule of the dudes friend|`|WucVTqv9aa	i reallydon't know what to say!<br>  that was harsh<br>  not your fault<br>  don't go out with someone you dont like!|`|ohM82iHhaa	That was messed up! Why would he do such a thing? <br>  <br>  Actually, knowing that they are friends you should have said no to both of them.<br>   <br>  But I understand, maybe you can apologize to the other guy and give a great excuse, like you "thought he was too shy" or something like that.|`|QfcHNlJVaa	hmmm ma buddy zack said no don't feel bad. you didn't deserve that. they screwed them over.|`|IkAtIQumaa	Im so buzzzd I didint get ti lol
5d9211d38d6935bc0d08850b222ec434aa	I looked for my gown at about 10 months out, and ordered it about a month after that...course, because it was a david's bridal gown, it only took 3 months to come in, so I actually had my dress for 7 months before my wedding-which made me crazy! I wanted to sit around the house wearing it! (I didn't, of course, but I did open the bag and swoon over it a bunch of times...). <br>  <br>  When you have time to go out and look, then go...depending on where you'll be going, some places can take up to 8 months to get a dress in, and that doesn't include fittings. So, don't let it being too early stand in your way.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I started looking right after we got engaged, which was just under 2 years away from our chosen wedding date.<br>  I decided that since I had so much time I was going to take a risk and order a gown off of eBay from a seller in China that makes the gown to your measurements.  Because it was a risk and I didn't want to have to worry about finding another dress in the event it arrived and was crap I ordered 18 months before the wedding.<br>  <br>  Lucky for me, it arrived and was absolutely perfect.  So now I've been storing my dress since March 2008 and the wedding isn't until 10/31/09.|`|7CKipTZOaa	I found mine 8 months before our ceremony but I had been looking for a couple months and ended up being frustrated. I stopped looking and one day while having coffee with a friend we walked by a bridal shop and there it was. Depending on where you buy your gown it may need to be ordered in on your size and altered so I think its ideal to have it a few months before the wedding at least|`|xFv6LirIaa	I got mine about 6-7 months before the wedding, but i did have a time finding shoes and a veil with tiarra.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	I ordered mine a month ago and am getting married in June. Since its from a local designer and custom made, it won't come in til April 10th, and I want to make sure that if any additional alterations need to be done, I'm not panicking 2 weeks before the wedding. So I'm getting it 2 months before. I started looking as soon as I was engaged.<br>  <br>  ADD: BlushingBride, I totally agree about trying on a ton of styles, even if it looks ugly on the hanger. The dress I am going to be wearing was one suggested by the boutique employee, and I hated it when she showed me it, but decided to try it on anyway. I ADORE it. I would never have found that dress on my own because I would have walked right on by. I'm so glad I did.|`|sLLgERQWaa	In 1974 it was 6 months.....it came 3 months before the wedding and I had the first fitting then to make sure it was the right size and then the last two fittings 2 weeks before (they had to take in the waist and shorten the skirt an inch), then freshen up the dress. I bought from a private bridal boutique thus avoiding chain stores like the plague.....<br>  The dress was gorgeous.<br>  <br>  The second time I married I wore a formal 3 piece beaded pants suit I found at Macy's...only the pants needed hemming and my local seamstress did that.It was a delicate chiffon material with a satin lining, I bought 3 weeks before my wedding and had the pants altered the next day, and the cleaners then 'freshened up' the outfit....good luck.|`|AA11082914	Started looking at magazines and stuff from the moment my guy proposed (over 2 years before the wedding). Went to David's Bridal a year and 5 months before (this past January) to look at bridesmaid gowns. My mom and MOH talked me into trying some on, and we ended up ordering. I know it's really early compared to most people, but I absolutely love my gown and don't know what I'd do if I had waited and found out that it was discontinued. *ADD* Won't actually have it in my hands until 13 months before the wedding. (Takes David's 4 months for special orders.)|`|F6fI9tG7aa	I was engaged for about 2 years before the wedding and would randomly look online at dresses.  I went to actually try a few on about a year before the wedding, but just randomly/casually.  Someone once told me to wait till 9 months beforehand as well because they said you'll change your mind a million times...I didn't change my mind though.  Once I found the dress I knew it was the one.  I ordered it about 7 months before the wedding.  Most places tell you to order about 6 months in advance, especially during peak wedding season.|`|di6p10Ifaa	I got engaged in March 2008, and got my gown Jan. 2009, which is about 15 months before my wedding. I tried on a few gowns but when I had that one I just knew it was the one. There was no doubt about it. My advice is to just go and try some gowns on. I had a style set in my head of what I was getting from looking in magazines, I went to the bridal shop and bought something that was the complete opposite of what I had originally planned and I am so glad my mom begged me to try it on because it looks great on me and I feel gorgeous in it. Be completely opened. Try on every style. I am glad my mom pulled me from being closed to one style, if she hadn't I would have never found my gown of my dreams! So just make yourself available to several styles even if you think it is ugly on the hanger. You may surprise yourself! :) happy shopping!|`|D9ufwiMXaa	I bought mine 1 yrs before, we had just gotten engaged and I was spending the weekend with my mom and sister and we just wanted to LOOK at dress' and I tried on a few, and then my sister came up to me with this ivory and cChampagnedress that just wwasn'twhat I was looking for but I tried it on and I just knew that was the dress so we bought it.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	I got engaged 18 months before our wedding. I found my dress a week after I got engaged, 17 months and 3 weeks before the weedding. It took six weeks to arrive. It was easy for me to find a dress, I knew that the 5th dress I tried on was "the dress". Different people have different experiences. I tried on many styles and got on a classic dress I knew I loved from the moment I saw it. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|St7Y2Ldkaa	I've always been told 18 months to start looking and 12 months to buy. That way you've tried on loads of dresses and know which one you want! But I guess it really depends on how much time you've got! If you've got a long time, then I would take more time... The less time you have, the quicker you need to buy!|`|nbv6Z01iaa	I looked two months before my wedding and decided on it 2 weeks before the date.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	Well, my engagment was only 7 months long, so I bought my dress 6 months before the wedding.  I don't think it's a good idea to buy it any sooner than a year beforehand, because you might gain or lose weight and have to do last minute alterations.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	I bought mine about 7.5 months before the wedding. I knew which dress I would end up with because I have been looking online for a year. I knew what I wanted and only went to one store and walked out with it the same day :)
PXuoxlwbaa	make a list of things you like and don't like about each of them. Then see who wins out. Factor in things like how they treat you, how happy they make you, who you have more fun with, who you trust more, who you can see yourself with longer, who your family would like more, all of that stuff. Not just the stuff like who's cuter. Think about who you would work with. You can only have one man, not two.|`|OhhKRahTaa	I don't think you need that much exclamation marks.|`|3ozaCLYqaa	Stay with the guy you are with.  At least you know that you two work well together.|`|AA11925334	okay - IF you really loved the first guy you would have never started having feelings for the second guy! grow up....before you lose them both- atleast now maybe you can maintain one FRIENDSHIP and one relationship.|`|cHF1PwRdaa	I would suggest taking it nice and easy with both of them. You do not say how old you are. Get to know these two first before you get ready to get intimate with either one. Good luck|`|NleWQOqyaa	well....do whatever you think is right...<br>  stay with the guy you have now...<br>  good luck...|`|C47ItT5eaa	hmmmm i would stick with the one you have been with the longest. Makes sense right? You know him extremely well, you have been with him for over a year, and you say this other guy is just like him. okay so why should you even have to think about this? <br>  <br>  lets think about them as clones...since you say they are exactly the same. The one you choose will have an effect on the one you dump. You have a long great history with one who will be hurt a lot more by the dumping.<br>  <br>  Now if you are just looking for a new "male member" to play with who cares about feelings right???|`|ifCMP0dnaa	its not about simple pro and con. In the end you have to make a choice. But keep in mind this problem will never go away. Even after marriage there are always going to be moments of doubt as to whether you should be with someone else, someone new or exciting. But I think you will find that if you stick it out with one person, the rewards will be much greater and more profound than by not being faithful.|`|rd50Q2v1aa	i think you should stay wiht the guy you have but do look at the other one a see if hes someone who you would consider dating. If he is think about both and whichever one you like more date but just make sure whoever you chose the one taht isnt chosen doesnt like follow you and try to get u back taht would piss the guy who you chose off|`|TLYk4KRJaa	dont pick either of them<br>  this happened to me before and if you choose one hes still going to be mad at you for waiting so long for deciding who you wanted to be with<br>  <br>  <br>  if you are trying to have a long distance relationship <br>  thats dumb as ****|`|eBEfZO9eaa	I think that you shouldn't throw away what you definitely have with your current guy for something new that just seems like what you already have.

You only have to go to school get decent grades and prepare for your future.After that unless you are born into money you will be like the rest of us; have to work to pay the bills.You will see it is no fun just ask someone older;and not all that much older either; ask someone in their middle 20's who have a place of their own and working.Ask them how much they party.<br>  Enjoy what you have.|`|QRBi7feQaa	your lucky you have parents who care some kids don't have parent and r living on the street or in foster care or have parents who don't care about them or who abuse them don't try growing up to fast i did that and now i wish i had listen to most of what the older adults in my life told me|`|7d3edabfdc27c4ba2c6cd571f70d965daa	You could talk to friends on the phone, have the friends that aren't grounded come pick you up, talk to friends online, be good so your parents will let you go to a party.<br>  <br>  Life's not fair.|`|7e8950aee924cd077d83c3a855698a57aa	wishing your life away is pointless... you're asking what can you do, but do you really want to know what to do to feel differently or do you just want someone to justify how you feel? i will tell you what i think you should do: appreciate and cherish every moment of your life. every moment that passes is a moment you won't get back. everyday you are growing, inside and out and inner growth is what's most important. inner growth comes from appreciation of the good and bad times in life, and from learning about yourself and your external world. life is life, and you are the age you are. it's up to you how you look at it. you might as well make the best of every moment in your life. it could be over before you know it or you could live to be 100. either way, you should cherish it.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Life is not fair now and it will never be fair no matter how old you get.  Life is going to kick you in the butt at 16,17,18,19 and so on.  You think this is a horrible thing happening to you?  Maybe you should take some time to look outside of yourself and realize how many kids your age do not have a home, food, clothes and at least one parent that cares.<br>  <br>  Quit feeling sorry for yourself.  Pick your little self up and do something worthwhile besides sitting around thinking you are the only one in the world that is not "having fun".<br>  <br>  There are many things you could be doing to help people less fortunate than you.  Prove something to yourself.  How unselfish you can be.

nM8eelmAaa	well the first thing ima tell you i went through the exact same thing with my boyfriend.<br>  <br>  && what ima say you might want to hear but you have to hear it sometime. your insecurities is pushing her away. when you always ask her whats wrong ans wont leave her alone about it, it makes her feel like there is something that is bothering you. and it makes her think that your not happy and you dont think she is happy either. you know what im saying?<br>  <br>  && when it seems like she is hinding things from you, its really nothing bad, its that since you ask her whats wrong all the time she thinks that something is wrong with you and she dont want to say or do anything that might make it worse.<br>  <br>  the next thing ima tell you is that pretty much every girl goes through this when they lose their virginity, everything is rushing through her head and she dont know what to do. just give her some space i know it will be hard but it the best thing.you dont want to push her away more.<br>  <br>  sex is what caused me and my X to break up..i was with him for 7 months i thought i could trust him. he said he would never leave me and he didnt want me for sex. but after we did things started going wrong as well and i(just as youre doing) always bothered him about it. i wouldnt leave him alone and it drove him away from me. i couldnt of never imagined my self with out him..its been about 5 months and i just got a new boyfriend(my every first love that i loved secretly) but i still think about what if i would of just left him alone..<br>  <br>  to be truthfull i know everything is runninh through her mind right now.<br>  and she keeps saying her mind loves you but her heart dont. well you cant love with your mind..so either she dont know how to explain her feeling or she is testing you to see if you will move on right away. so if you really love this girl..dont try to fix a broken heart by going out with someone else..because alot of people do..just wait it out and see where it takes you.<br>  <br>  i cant tell you how it will honestly go because everyone thinks differently but i gave you an idea..take it how you want it all i  can do now is wish you luck|`|tO8ey3o8aa	she might be feeling confused after the sex<br>  for some couples, sex makes the bond stronger and for others it can ruin it<br>  she might be regretting it, also the fact that she is a Christian might be adding to her confusion and regret|`|QYahxUEWaa	Sometimes its normal for a girl to feel confused specially after she just have sex so don't leave her alone she might be doing this just to see if you are going to stay with her. So just tell her  you know what i promised you that i will not leave you and if you need time take it but i will be here for you. She is going to smile and hug you its guaranty.
DuTeclwuaa	I am ABSOLUTELY APPALLED that women here are saying "have a baby as a test of your relationship strength."<br>  <br>  NO WONDER THERE ARE SO MANY F*CKED UP KIDS ON THIS PLANET!!!<br>  <br>  Despite what many MANY women think - it does not solve any problems or draw husband and wife closer together. Too many women think "we'll have a baby and he'll join the team and work with me to raise it."<br>  <br>  And it NEVER works out that way.<br>  <br>  Children are not the death of a relationship, but they are CERTAINLY not the savior of any, either.|`|qs9QHvy9aa	First off, you see questions like that a lot, because, people who have a child and it doesn't make the relationship worse, aren't asking questions about it lol.<br>  <br>  Theres two things that help make the relationship worse when a child comes along.  First, how was the relationship before the child?  If you start off with a bad relationship, bringing a child into it, is most likely going to make it worse, because of the additional strain and work needed to be done, not to mention the new finacial burden.  Next, you have to think, did BOTH partners want a child at the time?  If she just quit taking the pill, without talking it over with her partner, then of course he may not be ecstatic about it when she turns up pregnant.|`|o5jSID4Jaa	I definitely think it can be the final nail in the coffin if the relationship is already on shaky ground. That is why people shouldn't have kids to "fix" a marriage. I think a lot of people think kids can be a magic solution to all their marital problems. Raising a family is hard work and can put strain on even a strong marriage so if the marriage isn't strong then it can be what finally causes the marriage to fall apart.|`|237ab7a90e5b9d51488ea4a1c42d65dcaa	Well here's the thing.  You have to realize that people on here that need to ask questions about their relationships are obviously not in strong relationships to begin with.  So naturally, a baby is a true test and if that hinders the relationship, it's obvious the relationship wasn't meant to last.|`|djUMvICoaa	I think the answer is yes for the players, no for the hardcore parents.  The problem is that you don't hear from the parents here because they have no beef.  It's the ones who weren't expecting to get pregnant and they get guys who feel trapped and want no part of what is going on, they wanted the free life.  They have been thinking and staying in a relationship because the little head was doing the thinking again.|`|5GPDrBPLaa	No, not necessarily.  It does change the dynamics a lot.  If your relationship is not strong, it will cause a lot of problems.  Having kids is so stressful.  I have two boys and both my husband and I have to "tagteam" on the parenting bit.  We've had our rough moments, but nothing close to divorce.|`|KUhZX3Hbaa	It can tear apart a relationship that wasn't very strong to begin with, or it can enhance and entwine two lives all the more. It jsut depends on the relationship and the personalities involved.|`|KSK22vHUaa	If a child makes a marriage happier and better and stronger, people aren't going to ask for advice from strangers on Y!A.  Gotta keep that in mind ( :|`|geg7rsIHaa	Only if you neglect your relationship with your spouse.  This happens a lot, so people attribute the problem to the arrival of a child, when the real problem is a married couple ceasing to work on their own relationship.  Sometimes the kid or kids get all the attention and effort, and it can kill a marriage if the spouses aren't mindful of their own, separate relationship with each other.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I don't think babies screw up marriages usually.  If they do, it was because only one person wanted them and the other person and it caused friction when the children were there.  Otherwise, the marriage would have probably started failing anyway.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	Man, I love babies.  I can't believe a man wouldn't look at his own child and not want to do everything in his power to protect the kid and give it every chance.  To me, it makes everything better.|`|WKtakdsOaa	No way. Having children makes you marriage even better, its makes you closer and more family orientated and there are no downsides to it imo. <br>  <br>  My husband and I dont really go anywhere apart now only now and again as we are so wrapped up in being a family. We have both said the feeling we get when we all hug each other is like a drug and its hard to explain. Its a bit like the afterglow of sex when you feel warm and fuzzy.  You get joy in things that you wouldnt have before and you feel more fulfilled. We have a level of contentment that we never ha before and we dont really care about going out and spending money or useless thinsg like that now.<br>  <br>  It changes your life in the most remarkable way and nothing can compare to it. The pride I feel when I am with my husband and daughter makes me want to burst sometimes and my husband is hands on and nothing is too much for me or my daughter.<br>  <br>  He did night feeds, changes nappies, takes her out to give me a break, doesnt go out drinking or getting wrecked without me except once every couple of months.|`|iZDsMCghaa	If the relationship goes sour after baby or marriage, it was toxic to begin with. <br>  Neither should be used to improve a relationship, yet Im sure theres a percentage of people who do. Then you have people who change after one or the other or both for their various reasons but that basically goes back to being toxic from the start.<br>  I am married, have had 3 babies and our marriage has only improved. I think what some women forget is to be a girlfriend. not just the wife or the mom. And I think what too many men spend too much time at strip clubs or regular bars or just out wherever and not at home where they belong, expecting the woman to do it all and still want him, eh, dosnt happen.|`|AA10199093	It changed my marriage, but it didn't wreck it, that's for sure. We had a great relationship before we were married, once we were married and now that we have two awesome boys.|`|q3KCDrMAaa	No, having a baby DOES NOT kill a relationship. HOWEVER, having a baby with someone whose been half a s s i n g it through the relationship is...

mAAkRNzlaa	i definately wouldnt be worried! u sound wayy too safisticated to be worried over one guy! theres alot of other guys out there but i would ask him out the next time u see him! if he hesitates then forget about him and find yourself another guy!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>                                            hope it helps! good luck<br>                                                       C.J.|`|6Xoz12FNaa	uhh...rule#1 miss....when a guys wants to have sex with you before he knows u really welll....HES A PLAYER...her just want ur body not u...stay away from him...or stay with him and ruin ur life...|`|IkjSbxO1aa	He sounds cool but if he's usted to girls i think ll hell do is use u he has experience talking 2 girlsand thinks he can ignore u and get another girl<br>  thats only my opinion wait and take it smooth find out more about him sounds like hes true<br>  u definetly did the right thing like dat other girl said its completely his loss no where near yours<br>  <br>  <br>  From a guys perspective<br>  (\__/) (\_(\<br>  (='.'=) (=' :')<br>  (")_(") (, (')( ')<br>  no such thing as an ugly girl....<br>  dats wat men r 4|`|wp7vdcLCaa	He is not into you. He just wants sex. You shouldn't be worried. You don't know him and you don't know what goes through your head so go with what your heart tells you to....<br>  I would suggest find someone who will respect you to actually say that he likes you instead of saying you are "cool" that is really stupid. So if you really want a good relationship stop wasting your time with meaningless flings and find the guy who will be committed. <br>  Be respectful to yourself and know that you are better than "cool"<br>  I hope you find what you are looking for!|`|qIxTWt1Gaa	I think the only thing he wants with you is take you to bed. And if he respects women why did he ask you to have sex? A man that respects women would ask you to have a date and know each other better (When I say "better" means NO sex) not go straight to bed.|`|kadloxkgaa	The guys shows specific interest in you. But he seriously does Not want a relationship. He's letting you know you're cool. But he enjoys his freedom. So answers for you. He likes you, but does not want to date Anyone (not just you). And worried about wat?|`|hYP6akCYaa	chillax u did the right thing and he will call and if not its his loss!!<br>  <br>  o and dont have sex until ur married|`|JjS4ARPYaa	If you really like him, kinda, but I'm not sure you would want to date a guy that tried to get in your pants and said we will see about dating
Ddfff5psaa	Me! I'm 19 and I too feel like a baby.  Not a baby but a young teen, and I think it's ok to be like us.  We are young, we need to enjoy our lives!|`|Tm8qguoXaa	I do, but im 22.|`|YNd65b3kaa	I'm a lot older than that and sometimes my wife makes me feel like one.  Which is okay, I guess.|`|RhKhyol0aa	Count me in i'm like 29 and feel like a friggin 18 year old. I really think something is wrong with me....|`|zur8kdD2aa	Ya, I always get this feeling that sex isn't as good as I think it is so I always say to myself, might as well just fantasize about it rather then disappoint myself in doing it in real life :D.
W0KQTXrvaa	return to condoms|`|AA11806606	And who are you kidding?  You definitely are trying to get pregnant!  If you are not on the pill or using contraception; you WILL get pregnant.  Guys aren't stupid.. Don't lie; none of us believe you.  Sounds like a pretty smart guy to me.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Dump him.|`|kEtYEmhqaa	I side with him.  We really need a male birth control pill.  It would change the world.|`|uBssj3Znaa	unfortunately girls pull that kind of sh*t all the time. Put his fears to rest by getting yourself back on birth control or just by using a condom during sex. It is always better to be safe than sorry. And if you really don't want to have a kid right now, what's a better way to make sure of that.|`|POHWTDPRaa	Uh... if you aren't using protection you aren't trying not to get pregnant. So either you are trying to trap him or you don't get that. If it is the latter I'm not sure how you don't realize that but thank Christ your boyfriend does.|`|0Id85yiYaa	dude, you're wanting to have unprotected sex. what do you expect him to think?! if you're not ready to have kids right now, perhaps you should listen to your boyfriend. he sounds like the mature party here.|`|34b40Vu3aa	um, if you're not taking bc and not using a condom, then you probably will get pregnant.  just an fyi there.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	i think that HE can start wearing condoms if he's SO concerned.<br>  <br>  as for you, if you dont want a baby, use protection. PERIOD.<br>  <br>  also, i think it's weird that he accusing you of trying to get pregnant. odd.  a 6 month relationship is not worth this much drama.<br>  <br>  EDIT: i just want to make note that i think it's HORRIBLE that everyone is putting pressure on HER to prevent pregnancy. he CAN WEAR CONDOMS. he's not an invalid. he can get his *ss up and go buy condoms if he's THAT concerned.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Why are you having unprotected sex if you are not on the pill and not trying to get pregnant???? Of course he's not going to have sex with you if he doesn't want kids. Why not go on another form or birth control or insist he wear a condom if you really aren't trying to get pregnant?|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	The bizarre part of this question, to me, is that your bf apparently isn't wearing condoms when he has sex with you.  You should always use two forms of birth control, one of which should always be a condom.  They not only prevent pregnancy, they also greatly lower the risk of the transmission of STDs.|`|cGbTJobeaa	Your bf is a smart man. You should not be having unprotected sex together.  Unprotected sex is the leading cause of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  What are you going to do if you did get pregnant? Have the baby sucked into a sink or saddle him with a kid when he isn't ready to be a family man yet?|`|8PDzaAJcaa	if you don't want to have kids right now then why would you take the chance of becoming pregnant? Grow up........it's a good thing your boyfriend has some common sense.|`|GvamTVqAaa	Even if you aren't "trying" not being on birth control are using condoms - you will get pregnant.<br>  <br>  Seriously..kids these days :(|`|0AShsMsoaa	unprotected sex always leads to pregnancy.  <br>  <br>  thank god your boyfriend has a brain.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	Um...if you aren't on the pill and want to have unprotected sex, then what other conclusion can he come to other than you want to get pregnant? You can't prevent pregnancy by simply saying you don't want to get pregnant. You may be having doubts about this relationship, but frankly, I'm having doubts about your maturity and intelligence. He's very wise to refuse to have sex with you.<br>  <br>  marypoppins - in the question she states SHE WANTS to have unprotected sex and he won't do it. <br>  Besides all that, until men can get pregnant, like it or not, women will always bear the brunt of the birth control responsibility.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Use industrial strength Hefty bags. No, just use condoms.|`|xGshAiXOaa	Anytime you have sex at all, it could result in pregnancy.  Not taking birth control greatly increases that chance, and not wanting to use condoms increases that chance even further.  I think your boyfriend is actually being very smart in not wanting to have unprotected sex with a woman who is on no form of birth control.  You say you are not going to have kids right now, but your actions tell a completely different story.|`|15Uz3lO2aa	Did you want to have sex without a condom because it feels better? If so, it won't feel "better" when you have an unwanted pregnancy. Your bf is right to flip out. It's a big deal! <br>  <br>  Just tell him you were thinking foolishly, that you do not want kids right now, and you're sorry for trying to tempt him into having sex with you without protection, that your horniness got the better of you, and it won't happen again.|`|yNNnkze5aa	go on the pill to shut him up|`|lzooHi0Baa	Bringing children into this world is a very important decision and I admire your boyfriend for avoiding it at this time in particular, when the economy is upside down and jobs are scarce.   The fact that he does not want that responsibility right now does not mean he does not love you, so get that out of your head.   You must know about his true feelings.   There must be good virtues and actions from this guy that might show his love for you.   If you cannot find any, then you have a problem.  Go back to condoms while you find out.|`|AqU180claa	If you are trying to get preg by him. I think that he won't be of much help if you do get preg. And I a friend that had to raise her kids, with no help from the father.  Wait till your married to have sex and to start a family. It will be such a blessing if you do wait.|`|IXskJPlVaa	He is probably scared of a commit ed relationship and responsibilities. If you have any such expectations - he may not be your guy. Trust is also another point in question - if he can not trust you for your words - what future can you see. Better move on. Best of luck.|`|qAR26vRFaa	If your not trying to get pregnant then why are you trying to have unprotected sex and you're not on birth control?  I wouldn't trust you either.   Why don't you go get on birth control or use the condoms, that will resolve your "problem".|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Don't have unprotected sex and your problem will be solved. Why aren't you on any form of birth control? Realize that having unprotected sex is like Russian Roulette. You can get pregnant even if he pulls out....not to get graphic....but it definitely happens.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	So if you don't want to have kids right now, why are you sometimes wanting to have unprotected sex? Use condoms or something else if you are not using the pill.  After all he has a right to feel the way he does.|`|p6QizgmRaa	Your boyfriend is smart. <br>  Unprotected sex isn't very intelligent.<br>  Sorry.|`|uuMCGT9taa	get plan b and show him and get busy why just not use condoms until u get BACK on the PILL <br>  <br>  the pill is a good thing to get on if u wanna be unprotected ! still get check for std's even if u only sleep w ur man !|`|cHiv6eTWaa	Leave his stupid @$$ you are not compatible and do not want the same things in life. Go find someone who wants children with you. If a guy can't see his children in your eyes than he is not "The One"|`|99cb7ed23f0df048795281980a96543baa	I think your boyfriend is really smart.  <br>  <br>  I give him a lot of credit for thinking ahead and not getting "trapped" because you don't want to take any precautions.<br>  <br>  Good for him!!|`|IOsrDhrJaa	You know, it seems to me that you do want to have children. There is no reason as to why you want to have unprotected sex but not get pregnant. Maybe you just want to feel a deeper connection by him ejaculating inside you.. But you know, tricking men into having a child with you rarely ever works out. It would be a lot better if you wait to have children with a guy who actually wants to have children with you or wait until your boyfriend is ready to have kids. Really though, there is absolutely no reason to have unprotected sex for no reason unless you are trying to get pregnant. I completely understand if deep down inside you want to have children, but tricking someone into pregnancy is not the way to go. I have to agree with your bf. I think it is suspicious too. Oh and DO NOT HAVE DOUBTS!!! You have only been dating a half a year! That is too early for anyone in a relationship in that short of a term to get pregnant. Wait it out! This might be the man you have been waiting for your whole life!|`|xNWqqlcYaa	well, if you tell him you'll only have anal then i'm sure he'll come around.  and if he doesn't my number is 555-1234.|`|2r7dudZCaa	yeah why the hell would you wanna have unpro sex when "you're not going to have kids right now"??? if having a kid is really NOT in your plan right now then he is damn right. go prep for the future first<br>  <br>  but girl, if you could just stop whining about being pissed and sad and blabbing that you just wanna have unpro sex when in fact you absolutely know that that could lead to pregnancy, i could have sympathized with you.<br>  <br>  but to put things in perspective, why wouldn't he wanna have kids with u right now? does he really wanna have kids with you EVER? ahahha. now you should think about THAT|`|fsElHa74aa	Thank GOD finally a smart guy....good for him....at least one of you has a brain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|SU69rTD0aa	Do you realize what you just said. You will not go on the pill, but you want to have sex, and you don't want kids. It's like on sesame street - which of these things don't belong. It's like saying, I want to eat nothing but deep fried chicken, and not work out, but i want to lose weight.  Wake up and Good luck.|`|9zM6QFEOaa	do you know that if you have unprotected ssex you will be pregnant.<br>  ther is no, "i won't get pregnant"YOU WILL GET PREGNANT so your your b/f is right.<br>  getting pregnant is the last thing you want to do.and if you get pregnant your b/f will leave you.|`|a7VkyZLfaa	condoms is the best . He has the right to suspect that you want babies . Many women do this I mean the tricky way . This is doesnt mean that he dont love you . Just go back to the pills and let him see you taking it or let him use condom and buy it for him .|`|d44703065e36cd1dd93fc03103f892d9aa	I think you bf is not yet ready to have a committed relationship or he just needs you for sex. If you have doubts with your relationship, try thinking it over.|`|3lxagSP7aa	To be honest I would think the same. I think you have to start being honest with yoursle, if you dont want to get pregnant you would use contraception.
167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	ROFLMAO|`|T3BXC8qXaa	lol|`|Iac8nfK1aa	well i have eaten it and my marriage is hurting so ????
0PjLdkh7aa	my lunch table is almost all guys<br>  they talk about:<br>  bras---they talk about what the numbers actually mean<br>  boobs<br>  girlfriend's moms boobs<br>  sex, porn,<br>  sports<br>  eating girls out vs. giving head<br>  gossip<br>  and semen.<br>  <br>  i'm completely serious.|`|yIgd5vDAaa	sometimes,<br>  alot of times we're talking about guy stuff.<br>  music, movies, etc etc etc.|`|AJhx8zUVaa	yah we aren't allowed to tell you. its apart of the guy code. Srry what do you think we talk about|`|AA10266072	We're not allowed to say... you know... it's guy stuff.  Haha.
gEd1jlOEaa	Yes it  is very Pleasurable too! Just make sure it's done right! Because if you pierce it wrong you can loose feeling down there!|`|90zcKChJaa	First off, it's not a vaginal piercing. If you were to get a piercing down there you would either get your clitoris or the skin surrounding it.<br>  Second, this question is only for you to make, of course you are going to negative feed back from people with any questions about body modification because most people are closed minded. If you want to do this, then just do it.<br>  <br>  It does not hurt to get the outer skin pierced, and it's quite nice in my opinion.|`|EFGKxSsVaa	I'm gonna agree, it's really slutty.<br>  I was with a girl once who had one, it's good for them, definately makes sex and masterbation, whatever else, a whole lot better! But she told me once that it's a pain in the a$$ to even walk down the street, because the piercing rubs up against her pants and.. well I'm sure you can guess the rest!<br>  <br>  I wouldn't do it! hahah|`|2S2onP86aa	Nope. That's too "porny" lol.<br>  Belly button piercing is nice though. <br>  <br>  But it's your choice, darling.|`|eYuIsNk1aa	it can be sexy also from what I been told if you get your cl it pierced it will keep you aroused all the time|`|4293T0LNaa	Well my friend Arthur said its a major turn off!!! He said that is the skankiest sh*t ever!!!! Don't do it unless your a hoe.. but yeah..|`|BNcExYEeaa	no that's soooo gross y would u even think of that i mean come on that's not cool at all i bet ur parents won't even let!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|SzXyQR4maa	it's not sexy, but as long as you take it out before he puts it in, it's whatever|`|C0xoYXDvaa	the definition of "piercing" makes your question a very confusing and tantalizing one ... maybe u should change the wording or something. but yeah you should definetly have it "performed"  asap.|`|CejKLjtcaa	if you are looking toward a serious relationship no if you arent and just wanna hump and dump then go ahead but the person who peirces it might wanna get busy if boy|`|V0xSZDBUaa	I mean it not really a bad idea but you need to be prepared for a good time with it because you will *** at just walk...|`|OMY1rsz2aa	NO THATS DISGUSTING. what if it gets caught on some guys dick or tounge? or what if it got infected? thats just grosss.|`|FyckN1HBaa	No i think it is very unattractive and it's gotta hurt like hell that is my opinion|`|AasmEGrdaa	yea if you a freak. Hahahaha thats what hoes do no disrespect but thats nasty.|`|BPqK0c5taa	No I think that's unattractive. Just my opinion though, some guys might like it though who knows.|`|PREcj1STaa	If you dont like orgams sure go for it|`|78zLeWLSaa	Oh Yes, I have a #12 spike in mine|`|K9VfjAWYaa	thats sound soo painful..i wouldnt|`|31DmUQhSaa	I am young, but this is my opinion. I think it isn'tsuch a good idea because the vagina is a very sensitive area. Also, you can get more infections in the vaginal area, especially if it is pierced and the equiptment isn't sterile enough. Also, it would probably hurt a lot. Sexual intercourse could easily rip the piercing, and your vagina would bleed a lot and you would probably need stitches. That is just my opinion, but you can do whatever you want. If you decide to get the piercing, reserach piercing places by you and read the reviews.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	No...First of all, you risk infection down there...Second, most guys I know(myself included) think its not attractive at all...and if my woman did it, I would be wondering if she paid with cash or...AHEM...something else...what she had pierced...<br>  <br>  To put it bluntly...its slutty...|`|3ozaCLYqaa	not at all. <br>  my friend got her's done and it got all infected and nasty.<br>  she said it was the worst mistake of her life.|`|JXrvbW7caa	Maybe. If you're boyfriend is into that, then go for it.|`|AA10529674	I know I would never do it. It's just not my style.|`|VO1zmW4daa	ummm no lol
LCg7Wd9gaa	I have been where you are, and could be again if I don't learn from my mistakes. It is very upsetting when a someone you thought was a soul mate dissapears. He might come back and if & when he does you must be on your guard. <br>  <br>  We must be more sensitive than others. I am trying to make friends off the internet now, you can read body language and facial expressions ect. <br>  <br>  When you are lonely its so easy to fall for the friend who sounds sincere. <br>  <br>  Its just too easy to get hurt. <br>  <br>  Take Care anna|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	He didn't call you back for one night, and you got spastic and delete him and act like the world is going to end?

Suck it up princess.|`|0e4wLPhgaa	i think you were TOO drastic! he might have left it on and gone of somewhere... he doesnt always have to be with you and no one else. he isnt your property! he CAN not return your calls u know? im sorry if i sound a bit rude but seriously you OVER REACTED COMPLEATLY. maybe he just didnt have his cell phone at the time|`|wTYPomqQaa	CAN YOU SAY NEEDY? im sorry but you did overeact how bout if he was sleeping? left his phone? was taking a shower? his phone accidently disconnected? it had a low bat and turned of? was on silent/vibrate didnt hear it, lost it around his bed? was busy playing video games he wasnt paying attention to the phone? dude add him back|`|AA12164862	did you ever stop to think perhaps his phone was left home and that is why he didn't answer..what's the problem, maybe he had something else to do tonight ... leave a message and he will call you back when he can, jeeze.|`|ygPCDOskaa	yeah you really over reacted. he didn't respond one time? jeeze...<br>  <br>  also, its not really recommend to share all your personal info|`|NVn5e4AEaa	Um...are you insane? He didn't call you for ONE night and u go crazy? You need to take a look at the big picture! He might have left his phone at home by accident. You need professional help.|`|D20JGTwXaa	I think that he may have been busy or something and you should give him another chance before assuming and jumping to conclusions.|`|AA11275104	I think your over reacting. Maybe he was busy? Did you ask him why and if he still didn't respond then get over it .Life will still go on regardless.|`|9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	hahahaahahahahaah.  dude. chill|`|bmu6uhQ3aa	Smile, be happy and WAIT!

I hope i am not coming across as the old guy in target who files complaints about the quality of the customer service b/c he spent over 5 dollars on a pair of slippers. But shamefully, the odds are that he has probably lost interest in your texting relationship. My advice would be to pursue a face to face, talking to each other relationship. This allows you to truly see how a person you like behaves up close. ANYONE can mask their identity, and emotions, behind a simple text message.|`|hRQRuwU8aa	No, I disagree with those who said you're over-thinking. Think about this: if you don't love someone, will it be easy for you to look her in the eye and say you love her? Most people probably find that difficult. I believe the same logic applies here. If he can't say "baby" or "love" to you, I think something's wrong. Perhaps he got tired, bored; either way, I think cooling down and giving yourself space is the best solution.<br>  <br>  If you got time, I'd appreciate if you take a look at my question with my ex-girlfriend.

I recommend you do it before he does it first...|`|HtUhb3fXaa	It's ok, and saying lol over text doesn't sound bad, just wait til he gets back and hopefully itll all be okay again|`|A9Vh63V5aa	perhaps you guys should hang out more in person, like in the REAL WORLD. if you don't like him outside of texting and what he says, then break up with him.|`|ohfQyowlaa	dont think too much into it,<br>  maybe its something little.<br>  <br>  dont worry sweetheart,<br>  he'll come around :)<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|6Xv6D4h6aa	Just ask why he doesn't call u that anymore.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	I think you are overthinking this too. girls do this. the phase of your relationship is where the infatuation is gone and this is what you are missing.|`|cLATPkjkaa	Relationships don't stay crushes forever.<br>  <br>  <br>  As far as I'm concerned, this is the beginning of your actual relationship.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Sounds like he's lost interest andtrying to blame you for it calling you crazy and everything.<br>  Either dump him or play the fool.|`|MXGFGBtZaa	I know the feeling. Sometimes I want to just have a huge conversation with all these pissed off girls and have a huge rant about guys.|`|PpYl2dFVaa	u have to deal with it<br>  it will happen all over again all your life<br>  it wears off with the newness|`|JjS4ARPYaa	Try calling him.

You have an excellent body that is the prefect size and shape. Your hips are really hot and your face is really sexy. You would not be considered chubby at all, I would say you would be considered perfect.|`|NCvvwPEdaa	You are hot. Girls hips are definately very strong.

TFsEP7ktaa	Okay, I didn't click the links because my computer is too slow.<br>  <br>  But if I was commenting a friend's pic I'd probably say something like:<br>  Omg, you're sooo pretty! xx<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  I love this pic, you're gorgeous.(:<br>  <br>  Or something along the lines of that. It's not a big deal, it's just a picture comment. Don't stress about it. :)|`|Jly7xMU6aa	eb honest just say you like her picture. I just told one of my gurl frenz that I liked her pic and their wasn't any animosity. so go for it
jXnpJM0Oaa	I like them in briefs, and out of briefs, if you know what I mean *wink wink*. ;)  Actually, if the guy has a tight bod, briefs can be very sexy.|`|ezT7xruoaa	I like them too! To everyone going EEW, we're not talking tighty-whities on a skinny dude of course, something more like this: <a href="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/I/41nHn7ZF3-L.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/I/...</a>|`|8l4y6gxlaa	like for underwear? Ummm i guess they are ok haha I kind of like boxers better though becasue I always think of whitey tities when people say briefs. haha|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Eww|`|SWYrUxxhaa	Yeh, I Love them =) My boyfriends always worn them, i think ther sexy =)|`|XXbZAriNaa	they show the bulge better|`|Zi2Sw3ngaa	helz yeah...jk i dont even know why i answered this one
813fd7f9abc437f38c4101127f891d3eaa	If he still lives with his ex that's a bad sign.<br>  Don't do anything romantic until he is officially moved out.<br>  Living with his ex doesn't make him sound too successful...<br>  Make sure he's not lying about anything...guys do that.<br>  Establish a good relationship before you try, or let him try anything!!|`|OMY1rsz2aa	yeah i think its a good call not to start anything serious untill your positive that there's nothing still going on with him and his ex.|`|hHjPFxEdaa	I wouldn't trust any guy who is hitting on me while living with another woman and he sure wouldn't be in my bed.|`|uLHtXibRaa	I think that you are very silly..do you really believe all that crap about his g/f...anyway he stil has a g/f and you did stuff with him..?What does that make you?He will tell you all this ' my g/f dont understand me we are spliting up' crap.. to get sex from you..this so you feel sorry for him and arnt able to see whats really going on here..you are being used for sex!!!..but he has no plan to have his girl move out or he move out..why would he?..I mean..he has the best of both worlds.. comfort of a nice home where she does everything for him and two women to have sex with when he wants it..so,its up to you..?|`|62dfb7ea071ca9af65c41faf6cc6de0baa	It's the best call you could make. I met an ex of mine while he was going through a divorce but still living with his ex. I told him to come back and find me when he at least moved out. I didn't see him again for several months, but at least it was several months of wondering what was really going on and ex-filled drama that I didn't have to go through.|`|GbnIA76Maa	Sounds like, he is telling you one thing but telling his 'ex' girlfriend another. <br>  Do you know for sure if shes an ex?<br>  If she is then, i say go for it, and learn from your mistakes (if you need to).<br>  But if your not comfortable and dont know, just ask him?|`|MOALoKWdaa	yea i think you should wait a while, if he doesnt move out then that means he still cares for her and as well hes using you just for some talk|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Nobody knows.. We don't know this guy..|`|eBEfZO9eaa	If he is financially successful, then there's no reason to just try to move out--he should be able to break it off with his current gf if he really wants to and even move out if he has to.  Sounds like he's just playing.  You are right not to get intimate.  Find someone who isn't already involved with someone.|`|qmyYzBolaa	If he wants a booty call then why is he trying with you? booty calls are for people you already had sex with, if you never slept together then its not a booty call. its a one night stand. if he really just wanted sex i am sure he could have made a booty call. you know there is lots you can do without having sex! just make sure you finish him off.. blue ball SUCKS!|`|tdG5409Uaa	I give him a plus for not trying to try harder after you told him know. But, you might be getting him though. Just watch careful for that girl of his, cause guys love to use girls as back up plans just in case this one don't go right. And plus when we know were hot, theres many others jocking on us. If he;s given all his time to you then you might be specail to him.|`|lQ4wv1gIaa	I think its totally good... i mean he sounds really ito you and especially since when u told him no sex he agreed so that means he would be willing to be serious with you. So i think u should wait till hes not with his ex and then see what happens...<br>  hope this helps :D|`|GDoxT1qWaa	I <br>   <br>  I think its totally good... i mean he sounds really ito you and especially since when u told him no sex he agreed so that means he would be willing to be serious with you. So i think u should wait till hes not with his ex and then see what happens...<br>  hope this helps :D|`|rd50Q2v1aa	i think you should wait. Because of the fact that many "hot" guys these days just want sex and nothing else so wait and make him want it bad so you know hes commited to you and that he and u are both ready for it|`|cHF1PwRdaa	He sounds  as though he may be interested in you. The no sex on your part was good. A good relationship blooms through a good friendship. Please keep that in mind. Hope this helps. Good Luck|`|HM70Xllhaa	Dont worry im a girl on brothers account. Invite him to stay ast ur house but not to over do it. Tell him not 2 tell his gf ur at ur house just at a guys house idk if it will work
ZoPln7vaaa	I may not answer all your questions but let me tell you something that I felt the way you felt now, what I know is... when you don't know someone, its okay but after you get to know each other and started sharing love and affection and when it gets stronger.. its really hard for us to forget them as its really pains.. now I'm facing the same situations and don't seem to be interested to marry another man... its really sucks.... but I guess love is a sweet pain and its too late for me to realize that only GOD deserves our love... NEVER EVER should we fall in love... so deeply.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I think it just takes time to be sure.  When it's a new relationship, you have a lot of hormones running through you making it feel like everything will always be perfect and you'll always be in love.  At that point, your feelings are often misleading.  Usually by the time you've been together for a couple of years, many of the hormones have worn off, and you've also gotten to see the bad side as well as the good side of the other person.  By that point, I think you do usually know.  I have seen people lie to themselves at that point of a relationship and say they really wanted to be with somebody even though their actions were obviously saying they didn't, and these relationships haven't worked.  But if your heart and your mind are still saying it's right at that point in the relationship, then the chances are very good that it is.   It's such a major part of your life, that I don't see how you can really NOT know at that point.  It's like saying you don't know if you like your job or not.  You devote such a big portion of your time to it, you must have a feeling one way or the other about it.  Same thing with a mate.  When you spend that much time with somebody, you get a feeling one way or another if this is something you want to continue the rest of your life or not.  Again, I am not talking about the honeymoon stage of a relationship where you say you know, but you're really just caught up in the high of falling in love.  I'm talking about when somebody has been in your life for a while.<br>  <br>  As far as how much is in your head versus your heart, it needs to be complete in BOTH.  If either your heart or your head is not 100% behind this, then it's not the right person for you.|`|MDgVPwU3aa	Unfortunately, It was my reality. But, no longer romantic.<br>  <br>  I sacraficed alot because I felt he was my soulmate, I don't know if that really exists now. I felt I couldn't live without him & he said the same then.....years later we divorced and I am the only one with the same feelings...can't live without him. But, he has moved on with other women. Mmmm..heart and mind, good question. I followed my heart. But, I should have followed my mind and had common sense.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	when I met my Fiance the thing that did it for me was he was on time to the second for our first date and every other date he was early.... No other man has ever done that for me and he is the first person that my mind and heart can agree on not only is he good for me but I love him a whole lot as well|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	i dont know about the warts part, but love is a feeling. its a connection. its an urge and a desire to share your life with the person who makes you happy, plucks your nerves, but encourages you all at the same time. maybe the vows are taken literally for a lot of folks, which seals the commitment. maybe its the sex for some. maybe its the intimacy. the trust in the fact that this person promises to have your back, come hell or high water.<br>  <br>  essentially its all based on love...an emotion that we all feel that drives us to the monogomous commitment of one love and oneness in marriage for life.<br>  <br>  i love being married. he plucks my nerves about something at least twice a week, and i know i pluck his, but i know that he has my back and i have his. because that's one of the aspects of love-samefold with children, family and best friends.
NtSQcyHLaa	Yes, it sounds like he's interested. Give it some more time, but make sure that you're being friendly to him so that he'll feel comfortable with coming out of his shell and talking to you. If by the end of the term he hasn't made any sort of move, think about giving him some way of contacting you so that you can continue the exchanges once school is over.|`|bac56376717ea35d80831d3370c0f54baa	He sound shy, Ask him out, Shy people open up when you take the lead, He might be a great bloke, Dont let it slip through your hands|`|tnQOy5kdaa	Do something, or ask him straight out why he does that because you would feel stupid if you thought he liked you and he didn't but was just doing that for a different reason... Ya, you should just ask him|`|WQ4hXvzmaa	You should ask him out.  Take the lead|`|AZKNjg68aa	in this case you have to have the balls and approach this guy with conviction and determination...just dont come on too strong.....but open up and let him know what the deal is.i think hes feeling you and like some men hes probably afraid to tell you in fear of rejection.|`|6BwCwuHwaa	i most definitely think that he's interested in you. & i do believe he may be shy while being alone with you .. yeah.... i don't see why not take the next step ...|`|wqhvfFtgaa	Ahh! I know exactly what you mean!!<br>  I'm so glad to know someone else is in the same situation! lol<br>  <br>  But all my friends have recently told me that I just need to take the lead and step up and ask him out... I'm thinking maybe prom... Not sure tho...<br>  <br>  But yeah, I'd definately say make the first move... =)<br>  <br>  Good luck! =]
7OuNY2q9aa	wow, too specific good look finding one.|`|n7BuH75gaa	Wow. Good luck. LOL|`|Gbg7UaYVaa	wow that is not gonna be easy. Im 17, straightedge but not a vegetarian & believe in sex before marriage personally if you REALLY care about that person|`|oQcDZI9Daa	that guy sounds boring.
7OuNY2q9aa	it means she's a lunatic|`|PwHQSAxvaa	It means she would like you to just discreetly maul her norks.|`|uw2lRgmeaa	She wants your body, fool.|`|3ozaCLYqaa	I think you are looking too much into it.  Some people just like being close to other people, and sometimes they take it a little bit too far.  I mean, if it really really bothers you, then maybe you can talk to her about it, but I really don't see the point in doing that considering the fact that you may just end up hurting her feelings and ruining your chances at being with her.<br>  <br>  But other than that, i think that she likes you!|`|kCbJ89nXaa	Come on brother you're embarrassing me.  The only reason one animal creature would rub shoulders with another is because "they want something".|`|MczmTftTaa	She's got a shoulder fetish, animals do this in the wild. <br>  <br>  Haha she likes you dude! Make a move|`|15e58edf21f33dd475298413b3cd6d8caa	she likes u go 4 it|`|25Whzu2waa	Yeah, she likes you .  .. that, or she's got some **** on her shoulder she'd like to rub off . . . =]<br>  <br>  Yeah, dude, try flirting with her, play it cool, but DO make it seem like you're interested (since you are), just not too obviously. Things'll work out.|`|8l4y6gxlaa	I think she likes you and maybe she is trying to give you a hint that she likes you. That's what I would do if I like some guy! Good Luck|`|EvpoKO4Jaa	shes doing the mating dance|`|8bP67U8Taa	She wants some...|`|R9fsNpYPaa	Know that she is flirting xP|`|lijNJznEaa	don't you see?! she fancies you!!!! she is totally mad on you, mate!!!|`|e4317ce8f4113b0065b75473f383c255aa	jajaj shes a 1 night stander. she was just looking for a good time and wanted to have sex with you and leave u! lol|`|etdZZZLhaa	Maybe she likes you. <br>  <br>  Or maybe, brushing shoulders is one of her habits<br>  <br>  or maybe, she's just asking for you attention
ytGaDM7Haa	If you can return it, get one way nicer and don't tell her until the last minute (like as you're getting ready for the prom). Then say "Didn't you notice how fat and lumpy the *** on that dress is? Plus, it's way out of fashion already!" or something like like that to make her feel insecure about it when it's to late to do anything about it.<br>  <br>  Obviously she cares about your opinion (or else she wouldn't have stolen your dress option), so that would be a good, evil comeback.<br>  <br>  If you can't return it, just tell everyone she loved your dress so much she bought the same one!|`|9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	hahahaha. are you serious?  of course you shouldn't.  if she didn't want the two of you to look the same, she shouldn't have bought a dress that looks like yours.  To be blunt, I think you're being a bit of a pushover for even considering this.  your friend is being a ***** and you need to lay the law down! hah<br>  <br>  check out my question if you get a chance: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Av4E2bRZjDyzTxyqWvP1qXbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307170204AACzK40">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AOwZNtQuaa	Omg I can't believi your friend would do tht to you. Definitely don't buy a new dress. Tell her that you bought it first and she even knew that so why would she be telling you to buy a new one|`|D20JGTwXaa	I think you should not buy another dress. She knew you had the dress  first so she should buy a new dress and if she doesnt make sure you wear it better. :-D|`|j41BEfMAaa	NO! DO NOT BUY A NEW DRESS!<br>  You bought yours first and its her fault she copied you.<br>  If she wont buy a new one, go there as look-a-like twins.<br>  Everyone knows that you are bffs so dont worry and just have fun!|`|r6bSSVKbaa	hell no! She is obviously jealous and stole your dress!! I'm surprised that you even asked that question! Make her get a new dress!|`|8JcuKJ6Zaa	i think u should use yours...u bought it first and omg there's a lot of girls with the same style is a prom...and u should tell her|`|N4AtHOOLaa	humhumhum... your friend seems like a ***** to me.. sory :) tell her to get off cuz u bought it first and slap her jkjkjk<br>  <br>  suggest  politely she wears other|`|MKfMKg2naa	what ever you do do NOT buy a new dress!! ur friends a poser! its ok to like the dress, but not to buy the same exact one and then tell you that you should buy a new dress so she can keep the one she bought after you. you should tell her that you bought your's firsty and that if she has a problem with it she should buy a new dress. u got yours firts and she should deal with it. i personally would be pissed.|`|prOk1P72aa	Your friend seems like a b****. Tell her to go get a new dress you had that one first!|`|5L1djYCMaa	Hey.. hi.. You don't really have to buy another dress just because ur friend copied you and bought the same kind of dress... :)  I can remember how my best friend and I used to buy all the similar items when we go for shopping... it doesn't mean that we like to copy each other but we do that for fun.. :P it's different in your cas e<br>  I know it's ur prom dress and u want to look nice on that occasion .. but u have done nothing wrong... just ignore it, and dont ever waste your money on another dress.. .. if she wants u to buy another dress tell her that she should get another one.....|`|yegDdZfRaa	2 options:<br>  <br>  Keep your dress. You chose it first. If she wears the same one at prom, that's her problem. <br>  <br>  Now if you decide you want to get something different because she did that, do NOT show her the new one. Just make sure it's something better than what you you had before!<br>  <br>  Frankly, I'd go w/ option #1. If she thinks you're not going to bend, she might choose something else.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	no, remind her of the conversation you both had before she went and bought the same dress. she can return hers.|`|MwgYibwgaa	he say she say.<br>  <br>  Sound like girls problem to me. Why dont you just get a new simple n classic  out dress, hell it aint like prom is a once in a life time looser. Plus its the worst night ever.cause they cant dance. Learn from this next dont let her know wa up<br>  <br>  M out <br>  <br>  Peace<br>  <br>  <br>  You welcome|`|xZI6noJiaa	If it doesn't bother you for people to say your dresses look similar- don't. Personally I wouldn't, because it sounds like she wants you to find another dress because she doesn't want people to say that about her, not really out of concern for you.|`|Unk4zu2Naa	omg that is so rude <br>  no you shouldn't buy a new dress tell her to buy a new dress cause you got yours first <br>  that is like way mean of  her to do that!|`|Wb59rFmgaa	I wouldn't buy a new dress, forget her. Wear yours with pride! Who cares what others think.
q1VebxuAaa	It really depends on the person. If you have a good, close family, you might consider them more important to you than a friend. But if ur family kind of sucks, you might have a really great friend you consider family. <br>  I mean you can choose ur friends but you cant choose ur family, but sometimes, family will be the only people you have left. Idk... it really depends on the person.|`|eKcQ41DHaa	I would save my family member first, because if my friend is a true friend, he or she would understand and not be selfish.
2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	Personally, I think it is the responsibility of the guests to have a designated driver so they can drink responsibly.  That said, there are other considerations you mentioned- like some people not being very good at night driving, or being tired from all the eating and dancing- that could cause out-of-town guests to not want to drive too far back to their hotel.  I think anything in a 10-15 minute radius is acceptable, though.  I think what I would do in your case is keep the reception venue but change the hotel location, or block off some rooms at several area hotels so guests can make the final choice about where to stay.  It doesn't cost anything to block off hotel rooms, so why not give the guests a few options?<br>  <br>  The hotel in which I blocked some rooms for my wedding is about 15 miles away from the actual ceremony and reception venues, but it is very close to our apartment and my mom's apartment, which I think is more important since our out-of-town guests will likely be spending lots of time at our places in the days prior to and after the wedding.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I have to agree if there is drinking involved they should be able to walk to their rooms (so having a reception in the hotel is probably best).<br>  <br>  But that isn't always possible, so I'd say within 10 minutes drive so that cab fare isn't crazy expensive if someone drinks too much OR it would be close enough so the people who didn't over indulge could drive & drop off those that did with little or no inconvenience.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	If there's drinking you should contact the closest hotel about getting a taxi service for your guests. Some hotels will run shuttles for a very low cost. <br>  <br>  If I wasn't drinking I would drive however far it takes. I drive an hour to work each way every day so nothing is too far for me! I would say about 30 minutes or less is average. <br>  Good luck!|`|sGP6s7uraa	I would say maybe 20 minutes tops.  Don't be surprised, though, if a lot of people head out early during the reception to make it to the hotel room before it got "too dark."  My grandparents say this all the time when they go visiting or are invited somewhere.|`|ODYrypwaaa	Well, if they are drinking - any distance is too far to drive.  However, if you offer transportation (a friend with an SUV, Cab, or limo) then any distance is fine really.  If I was driving myself, sober, from a reception to my hotel, that the bride paid for, I would be fine with 15-20 miles.  If I paid for it myself I would prefer it be closer.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	Drinking? Anwhere is too far!<br>  <br>  Other than that... I would say 20 mins.|`|AA11380378	Our hotel where we blocked our rooms was about 13 miles frrom the venue, a 20 minute drive.<br>  <br>  Since we were serving alcohol at the reception, we hired a limo service to transport all of or guests to and from the hotel and venue. That way, everyone got there safe, no one got lost and everyone was able to have a drink and get back to the hotel safely. We hired a luxury coach so everyone could fit.<br>  <br>  Good luck
R6TFrDtxaa	Calm down. You are a great mom. Three kids? that would be hard on everyone. First thing- Set every ones clothes ,including yours out the night before.This means all clothes including underpants and socks and shoes. Have every ones book bags by the door and everything in them the night before. Try setting the table the night before with cereal bowls etc... Work on the mornings first, get everyone ,everywhere they need to be with what they need. On the weekend, HUSBAND takes the kids to ball or just out for a few hours. EVERY sat. That is when you tackle ,kitchen first, then go through the rest of the house as you can. COOK on the weekends, cook meat for spaghetti  etc. plan leftovers thru the week etc. Go to FLYLADY on the internet it will give you hints. Church on Sunday as a family. (if you go) Everything will not turn around asap. It will take awhile. Also Make your kids help. They need to learn how to do stuff,its not being mean to them. They can keep their rooms clean and clear table etc... Good luck. Lots of mommies are in the same shape you are. It will get better.|`|pxygDg7Aaa	My experience has found that if you are always late and things aren't getting done at home, you are just lazy and selfish.  Don't put more on your plate that you cannot handle and for God's sake, quit getting your kids into your own mess at school.  It is time to grow up and be an adult and a parent.  That means you have to make some sacrifices and do things that you don't want to do sometimes.<br>  Have your husband do the bills and help with the housework.  <br>  I don't know how much he works but you seem busy too.  It doesn't excuse the fact that your kids are late for school.  That's awful that your children feel the brunt of your irresponsibility and they are going to grow up with your same troubles because you aren't strong enough to stop it.<br>  My advice to you is suck it up and lighten your load.|`|MvisyrRVaa	If there isnt to much going on, on the weekends the that will be a prime time to get stuff done. Ask your kids to help around the house, and that will take some stress off you to finish your online class work that needs to be done. To stop making or kids late for school that must mean you have to leave the house earlier, it sucks I know, but it must be done.
EFGKxSsVaa	a girls looks definately make it so that i want to get to know her, <br>  but if shes got a shitty personality, i don't really want anything to do with her! at the end of the day, a good attitude and a really nice girl, will win over a gorgeous girl with a crappy attitude, any day.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Both. If a woman is beautiful and a nasty individual. I don't want to be around her. She can have the greatest personality in the world. But if she looks like a bulldog I will tell her "Go find a blind man, you have a great personality".|`|0s93q8Ocaa	Looks is what you can see.  The person must have a certain look that attracts you before you can get to know the personality.  After that, it's the personality.|`|7OuNY2q9aa	a combination of both|`|C47ItT5eaa	Looks: that is what gets you noticed..starts the dialog. Buys her a drink..and if you too young for the drink...buys you a pepsi..or some candy from the school vending machine :P<br>  <br>  Personality: that's after the drink/candy when they sit next to you and start a conversation. How you act in the situation can turn it all around in the other direction....Of course then  there are the shallow guys and girls that are hearing nothing coming out of your mouth....just thinking about what it would be like in the bedroom with you....<br>  <br>  Personality should be the corner stone of beautiful...Like i said in an earlier answer...I have seen Hot chicks become ugly once they open their mouth to utter words :P|`|qGy9fR7xaa	Well, that kind of tough -  i mean, obviously the person has to be nice and have a good personality, but before you get to know people and people get to know you, you often judge them straight away by the way they look. Unless a person has a strong personality, or is easy to read and get to know, then really it all starts of judging them by looks.<br>  At the beginning, i think there's a lot about looks, but in the long run, you want someone who's lovely, not some one who's hot but has a crappy personality. x|`|h32OwXACaa	a combination of both but sometimes personality beats out looks.
Likst1Mxaa	Final year? Suck it up. There's not much you can do now to "reedeem" yourself. Maybe you could talk to someone about harrassment, but other than that, fourth year is not the time to make new friends and influence people. Sorry sunshine. Just keep your head down, study and don't make a fuss about being left out.

Karma is a b****.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	be a guy who she thinks about all the time. give her a ton of attention and be really nice and then pull away for a bit. she'll be thinking about you.<br>  <br>  you could also find a poem with her name in it and read it to her and say it's your favourite poem/verse|`|PXimiZCdaa	you do realize if you are capable of pulling this off, then some other guy can do exactly the same. either way, you lose in the end.|`|hYP6akCYaa	FREAK!!!!!!!!!  r u that desperate|`|R1MrfZqtaa	Shes gonna hate you. You don't just go ask a girl to be your girlfriend when she has a boyfriend. The guy will hate you and the girl will think you are... retarded! You have to wait for the girl, she won't like you unless she doesn't have a boy friend, so i wouldn't give it a shot until she is single. Then, you just act flirty and protective toard her, and she catch on (that you like her)|`|kgfcc4PUaa	Back off she has a boyfriend she obviously doesnt care about you.

If she leaves her boyfriend for you she'll leave you for someone else.|`|JjS4ARPYaa	Don't make her cheat on her boyfriend, that will give you a bad rep.|`|kaEwHqvxaa	what the hell. no.|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	uh not loser find another chick|`|Klf3orZlaa	If she likes you then she shouldn't be with her boyfriend. Do you really want someone who is willing to cheat on her bf of a year and a half!?<br>  As for you don't put yourself in the position of a prick! If you like the girl keep your distance, be her friend and if she ever breaks up with her boyfriend and she likes you she'll come to you. Don't be a homewrecker!|`|tnQOy5kdaa	I don't think that you want her to cheat. You have to make sure you can commit to her and would want to be with her for more than a year and a half so she knows you feel it's worth it. If it is worth it, you could sit tight and wait for the break up. Just make sure you're feelings are known and ask her to think about it.|`|ynj2FPAgaa	What the **** is your problem?<br>  You don't make someone cheat on their boyfriend just because you're a dick. If you really care about her, you wouldn't do that.<br>  But obviously you just want her.<br>  If you're that desperate for her though, maybe find a way to get her to break up with her boyfriend. That's AT LEAST a LITTLE better than making her cheat. But if you're just gonna **** her and then end it, don't even try. Leave her with her boyfriend, she deserves better than an asshole like you.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped :)|`|P3OWfxi5aa	ur a jerk<br>  **** you|`|6Xoz12FNaa	if ur love is true.. then do this<br>  <br>  make her boyfriend look bad or do something bad in front of her..and at the same time u do something spectacluar....the u got her 100%|`|A5nZFjEoaa	You can't interfere like that. If it's meant to happen it will! If you truly cared about her you wouldn't be trying to put her in a position where she would have to do something she might regret. Be her friend for now. Help her through problems, but DON'T(no matter what) even if she makes a move, do anything with her that would count as her cheating on her boyfriend.|`|s6itMDRTaa	that sucks she is dating someone <br>  just try and adsert yourself as a good guy <br>  when and if she breaks up with this be there for her <br>  try and get her attention talk to her more and try and spend more time with her <br>  btu not 2 much other wise the boyfriend will see what your doing tand that'll create problems|`|4SWvHCzfaa	if they have been going out for a year and a half they obviously have something going on. It would be f***** up to have he cheat on him. Move on. chances are you and her wouldnt last as long as she and him will|`|kQgSi1MEaa	Drug her, put her in the trunk of your car, bring her to a dark alleyway, and kiss her.  <br>  <br>  There.  she cheated.|`|qXFACB58aa	You can't MAKE people like you, and besides that who wants to be with someone who tries to wreck other people? Piss off|`|MuSYw7m3aa	no dont do that if you really like her at all then you would want her to be happy and she wont be happy if shes cheating on her bf with you thats wrong and just stop and try to find someone who is avalible|`|jf1o7TFHaa	don't make her cheat. maybe if you tell her how you feel and if she likes you enough she will go out with you.|`|nV4hP0HOaa	Yo you're an ***!

And why would you want to be with a cheater anyway?|`|W9ZHgU0taa	you are awful!!!|`|wp7vdcLCaa	You shouldn't want to date a girl who is willing to cheat. If she doesn't want to leave her boyfriend then don't force her to. Just let her be and if she wants to be with you then let her make the choice of ending it with her boyfriend. Because if she would do that with you then she will do it to you... <br>  You should have a better respect for other people and yourself.|`|gUjVUF31aa	get her drunk|`|x7E6PDhhaa	okay first of all, don't be a "home wrecker. in my opinion, if a girl cheats on her boyfriend, the guy she had an affair with seems even worse than the girl because he is purposely trying to ruin her relationship. if you really care about this girl, you would RESPECT her feelings for her boyfriend and you wouldn't try to sabotage her relationship. if she falls for you on her own, great. if not, give up.|`|DsXyMuAiaa	Trust me you don't want any part of this...|`|txrItklBaa	If you were a good person, you wouldn't even be considering this question. If it was meant to be it would happen.|`|qIxTWt1Gaa	You are sick! There's more people out there!|`|kadloxkgaa	You're a loser dude. Get a life.
uBssj3Znaa	if she is into you, she will totally consider this a date. The best way to know is to feel her out when you two are hanging out. Be flirtly, maybe try to hold her hand. If she goes for it, then it is a date.|`|3ozaCLYqaa	I'd assume that she would realize that you were into her and think it was a date.|`|ekfdyQxyaa	i think she's considers it a date. ASK HER!|`|8RCANzJvaa	could go either way.<br>  <br>  you could be bold and give her a peck on the cheek, see what she does. put your arm around her at the movies. take her out to dinner, and YOU pay for it... dont let her.<br>  <br>  it took me and my bf a couple weeks to, i guess, say were dating. we had gone out to the mandarin, the movies, and i was over at his house two weekends in a row, all weekend before we finally said... hey remember that time we went to the movies.. that was a first date right?<br>  <br>  going strong, ever since.|`|I6dIkhbOaa	If you are hanging out after dancing and making out, I am pretty sure she considers this dating. It sounds like she likes you if she has responded so well to you each time you've approached. If she didn't and was just drunk that first night or something, she would have just ignored your attempts. I think it's strange that people are afraid to just ask the other person straight up but then again, I am 32 and have been married for almost 11 years so I am probably a little rusty on the whole dating game . . .

That is the quickest way to get closer and maybe tell him that you kind of have feelings for him but want to get to know him first. That way, he will know what's going on and why you're calling him. If he seems into you still, then ask him to the dance, maybe just as friends and use this as another way to get closer to him. If all goes well, he'll ask you out eventually or at least he will like you more.|`|JjS4ARPYaa	I bet he would, and if your not sure about a date ask him to go with you as friends and see how it goes to see if you want to date (ask him that whole thing)|`|cXm6cLcpaa	Take the chance...

If you are skinny or normal size, then thats ok. Just don't go crazy with trying to be too skinny, like anorexic, because then the guy will NOT like that and it is just bad for your health.<br>  If you are skinny or normal size, don't worry about how your looks are, or your body, because a guy that really likes you will like you for who you are.<br>  <br>  Ok, now if someone is obese, thats a different story because being obese is a disorder and a health problem and they should lose some weight.

06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Your mother is bringing this on herself. It is possible you might have to cut out more of your family to get that peace you want. By the way cutting someone off includes blocking them so they cannot email you, so you havent truly cut her out of your life yet.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	by the sound of your version, you're doing the right thing and your mother is a manipulative control freak.<br>  love those who love you<br>  forget those who forget you|`|1sWrXm9qaa	I to have a mother that I talk to only maybe once a year because of evil and spitefull things she has done I used to always try and fix the problems with her but have grown cold and worn out over time trying to fix problems which in turn would always bring me down and cause fights between me and my wife so now I just dont make any attempts any more which is sad but I no longer have the stress of her harrassing me any more.

The best you should do after your wedding is try to sell the house or save up some money so you can move away from your mom. It's not good to live around people who make your life miserable or just tell you what to do. Good luck with your situation and again im sorry.|`|RMgyEgJsaa	As a family counselor of 14 years I have come across situations so similar to this, I thought I would give my input. First of all, I will say that when it comes to matters of family - No one is right or wrong in how they feel. You are allowed to dislike, and even ignore your mother if she has become abusive, controlling, and as it sounds very manipulating towards you and your fiancee. Even as a family counselor, I can see that sometimes a person is a person, and parents can use things against their children just as children can manipulate parents, and so on. So first of all, you are allowed to feel this way and if you do - Then you need to understand that not everyone in your family may feel this way. Especially in families where there are disabled members, unfortunately it is only human nature for us to simply side with that of the disabled person because generally they are viewed as vulnerable and weak - But we all know this is not always the case. Your family may not understand this, even if they see how she overreacts they may always 'side with' her and you cannot change their opinion.<br>  <br>  Secondly, this is your wedding. Your special day in which you can plan the festivites where you want, eat the food you want, play the music you want and wear what you want. Do not feel guilty because you have tried to work with her and she will not listen, because you HAVE tried. A wedding is the cause of many mother/daughter relations to become hostile. Mothers can sometimes go a little overboard and not realize that they dont have to like every detail of the wedding, in fact, it is not their day at all - And therefore they do not need to like any of it. But, they should support and love you no matter your choices.<br>  <br>  This is getting long, my suggestions are as follows. Follow your heart, and if you do not want to speak with her and cannot get along with her, that is your choice to end contact. Maybe have a meeting with your immediate family, excluding your mother, and explain that although they may not like it, it is between the two of you and you are choosing to go ahead with plans as you see them. If anyone has a problem, they need to know it has nothing to do with them, that you still love her but are choosing to continue with the plans because it is YOUR wedding and you are the one paying for it.|`|ef900587f42a3006a5209f45881cb638aa	Wow, your wedding day is YOUR day .....not sure what to say about yor mom as I have been there done that....the bottom line is that this is your day and should choose what you want to day....your color choice sounds awesome....listen you are now at an age wherein you have to make your own choices and live life the way yo want to NOT the way others do.....I say continue with your plans and if you mother chooses not to show up then that is sad and her loss....congrats on your wedding day|`|56NoZzT3aa	Yes i know how you feel my mom is the old fashion way she us to let my tree brothers beat me up like if i was a dog she wouldn't even let us go out side to sit on the porch she would always say that she regret the day she had girls in her stomach that she should of never had me and my sister.wen she found out i had a boyfriend she got the vacuum cord and beat me up till she got tired.i got pregnant at 14 she kick me out of my house saying i was dead for her not to ever talk to her again.the day i was about have my baby things got complicated i almost died doctor called her to let her know what was go in on wit me.i dint feel no pain of the surgery i had pain in my heart asking my self what kind of mother leaves her 15 year old daughter alone.well now i have 2 daughters .what am trying to say my family ruin my life so if ur mom is acting like that not bean happy for u she don't really deserves for u to be sad enjoy the happiest day off ur life don't let them ruin it for u. if ur happy she should be happy for u and if u get a divorce like she said u would as a mother she should always be there for u to love and protect u.cuz that's how she should be showing u her love.am a mom and am always go in to be there for my girls wen they are sad or happy please don't let ur family ruin a happy moment like ur wedding day.move to another neighborhood and try to work things out wit ur mom cuz u should be glad u still have her anger and hate will only damage ur heart just try to stay away from her visit every other week cuz at the end she still ur mom. i don't have any anger against my mom what they did to me help me be a better mom my my kids.

As for not enjoying sex well maybe she just didn't like it with you.|`|z0XRuVwSaa	just like virgin men experament|`|GGSSxFsUaa	LMAO!!!|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	You can masturbate and still be a virgin.  A woman can have clitoral stimulation to orgasm.  It's above the vaginal opening.  When you have vaginal stimulation or intercourse that is when you are no longer a virgin.<br>  And yes, sex feels good for women too if it's done right with an experienced partner.|`|FKMKQbqPaa	stimulating your clitoris will give you an orgasm without any penetration.  i guess it depends on your definition of virginity.  if you define it as never having been penetrated, you could use your fingers or a vibrator to give yourself an orgasm without penetrating yourself.|`|p6QizgmRaa	Shouldn't you still be in school?

jj44Po4eaa	No. That's stupid. Guys like pretty girls in all colors.|`|bFDeOXvYaa	Some really desperate older white men do try for Asian women. Usually this is more common in some of (definitely not all!) the non-English speaking White countries.<br>  <br>  In places like Australia and The USA and Canada this is less common because there isn't that pressure to have a family.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	I'm pretty sure someone is just pulling your leg on that one. If a guy would date an Asian girl it is probably because he likes her and her personality not because she is the closest thing to a white girl.|`|ZoeS825Kaa	Is that something you heard from a jealous white girl?<br>  No that's bullshit. <br>  Trust me being an asain girl is going to work out for you in the boys department, I know i like em.|`|EmC8wvMsaa	Kay wow, no. <br>  <br>  answer mine <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsHxz91mDueRrEGo5dbeTzPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307182256AAa30AB">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|PTyYSdxbaa	Generalize much?|`|W3hAzpHaaa	and where did u hear this from?|`|3y0w1qIBaa	That's not true at all.|`|kWjy7uzAaa	I think you got it twisted, Asian girls are way hotter than white women. White women in America are all now fat ungraceful pigs who have no idea how to please a man. Asian women know exactly how make their man fell important and respected, plus they are feminine graceful and know how to act like ladies. Some white women are still  a very good catch like the Southern Bells but the city women are just cows who have no idea how to be sexy, but they know how to be sluts.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	If a white guy is not concerned about race he is likely to find women of all races very attractive. Many Asians are really of the same race we call white, since Japanese and Persian, Russian may all be Asian but also their ancestry is largely white.<br>  <br>  But all women are very attractive to a heterosexual male.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	no, not even close.  i don't care if you're white, black, asian, hispanic, orange or purple.  if you're hot and smart, i'll take a try.|`|1N3wmqz7aa	No.|`|Io7x29vhaa	No
aPGPbbz7aa	you kind of answered the question for yourself when you typed the first sentence. If this is what your hearing and believeing i don't think youu should even try to get to know him. Depends on who he is really, not who you want him to be. Up to you kid-oh . high school relationships aren't that serious, in year 8 i went out with this guy i hardly knew because when i looked at him i just got love stoned? lol yea lame i know and then i got to know him and it was over after 4 months ? weird .. about how long it lasted LOL ! off topic now but its really up to you, best way to get to know him is chat on msn? bump into him at school and talk etc.|`|ns1F0p8Laa	you should be scared.  if u see him doing all of this why would you want to date this guy.  im sure there are more nicer and well respected guys that would love to date you.  never settle for less than you're worth sweetheart.|`|geL6jbdpaa	no <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmxwlRKzcCZSvKKWrhRFpsnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307183415AAZ2v5Z">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|YIvIVvWFaa	I'm wondering why you like him? For his smile? Because he's handsome? Because he's popular? Because he's just full of self-confidence? Or is it because you have a lot in common?<br>  <br>  I have had the experience of liking someone who didn't have the qualities he should, for me to be happy. Thank goodness I didn't marry him! It takes a little effort to forget people like that, but you can do it.<br>  <br>  I grant that some unsuitable boys can seem attractive, but it's time to learn an important lesson that will help you have a happier life: Decide what kind of character (honest or dishonest, cheater or faithful, hard-working or lazy, kind or mean, and so on) and personality (gloomy or cheerful, very outgoing or quiet, party-loving or intellectual--you get the idea) you want in a guy and make a little list to help you remember. When you are attracted to someone for any reason, think about how he measures up to your list. You'll have a happier life.<br>  <br>  As he is two grades above you, you probably don't have much in common, so there is also the problem that he might take advantage of you just for sex. That is never a fun experience for a girl because the "love" doesn't last, and if he is cheating on all the girls he dates, he will cheat on you. Would you like that? If not, then there is no point whatsoever in trying to become friends. Let it go and forget about him. You will find a bf who really makes you happy some day.|`|FiCl71flaa	I assume that every thing you know about this guy came from other people like friends since you indicated that you don't know him and he does not know you. Before you conclude that he is a cheater, why don't you get to know him first and draw your own conclusions.If he is a cheater then you may have to choose to remain his friend or cut him off. But if he is not a cheater  I  hope it works out well for the both of you, and you like him and he likes you,then you have the beginnings    of a beautiful relationship. I hope things work out well for you.|`|AA11324847	You are really naive. Take that "chance", and then go cry on the shoulders of the guys you deserve but never noticed. He's a pro, and you WON'T come out of it better I gaurantee.|`|8ZbgUeBIaa	You probably shouldn't go out with him, since he is a big cheater and everything. Also, he's in grade 10, and you're in grade 8. I'm not saying the age difference is bad, but it is most likely that he'll try to do things that you might not be comfortable with.<br>  Girls are attracted to what they hear, unlike guys who are attracted to what they see. That's why girls like songs like that "I don't want another pretty face" song, and why you don't see pictures of men's legs in ladies washrooms; but you see pictures of women's legs some times in men's washrooms. What does that mean? He'll try to sweet talk you, so he can see you...in that way<br>  <br>  But you could always try to be friends with him. <br>  And if you do think you could give him a chance for dating, you should probably take it slow, and you'll find out whether or not he's worth it|`|x7E6PDhhaa	NO NO NO NO NO. this is like a red flag, if he's cheated numerous times, its highly unlikely that he will stop his cheating ways. he sounds like a d-bag, and you should stay away from him. also, since you're younger than him he will most likely want to take advantage of you sexually, because you're vulnerable, possibly naive, and guys take advantage of girls like that. my advice, don't bother with him|`|wp7vdcLCaa	If you don't respect this person then he isn't worth being friends with. Don't put yourself in a position to get hurt. Try someone who you do respect that you don't have doubtful feelings toward. Listen to your heart because it is obviously telling you that you don't want this relationship. Don't listen to your head because it will mess you up every time.<br>  I hope you find what you are looking for!|`|tnQOy5kdaa	I don' think so. You'll just get your heart broken. Odds are if your so much younger than him emotionally you will get turned down. If you don't he'll probably cheat on you. If you like each other i would say go for it but you don't even know him so...|`|BjyXKFpRaa	if you want to be used like a whore then talk to him but if you want to treated like a lady don't talk to him.|`|blirKov3aa	if he wont cheat on his friends,u can try to be his friend,<br>  but not to date him,becos he cheats all the girls he dates!|`|FprrMexEaa	girl u do NOT need to be even THINKING about dating a 10th grader when ur in the 8th grade<br>  <br>  do u wanna get rapped?!|`|o1pwdWWXaa	dont date a guy with a bad record|`|hLxCqYAGaa	He sounds like trouble. If he is disrespecting girls this early on he's only out to get some. Being friends often leads to unexpected incidents especially when dogs are involved and there is a physical attraction. So do your self a favor and forget about him because he will only run through you too.|`|ptIOvGSaaa	Are you mental??(no ofense) He is 10th you are in 8th, date someone in 8th or 9th, because in two years, a lot can happen, also why would you want to date someone who has cheated on every girl he has dated???|`|0eBYV1ikaa	Please don't underestimate yourself, go with your vibe. You're first instinct is usually right. If he cheated on those other women, he will probably cheat on you. Trust me, you'll find someone better.|`|1GSMGJWJaa	just be friends first if he gets to no you bettter there is less chance

It's probably illegal in your state.

Even if now it would be for "personal viewing only," who's to say that after a nasty break-up it wouldn't be aired online (and cause a very expensive lawsuit)? Don't do that.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	It is very wrong in video taping someone without their knowledge. If someone else gets the tape then they would not be too happy knowing someone else had seen the video. The person could end up divorced.|`|ibaLRXY2aa	Yes. It has to be consensual for both partners. Otherwise it's just wrong and possibly illegal.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Yes.

0880ac45fbb6456e1e6cd4a33571a64faa	It does not mean he's gay.  Interesting how many people are assuming that to be the case.  I wonder....if you were a woman and it was a woman saying this to you no one would think twice about this.<br>  <br>   Sounds like he is in tune with his emotions and considers you his best friend/brother.   Soul mate?  Just means that you are very important to him and that he leans on you for support.  Nothing wrong with that.|`|e9Mp8Zrraa	I think he just trusts you and is happy that you are there for him.|`|VZFEB85Iaa	he's gay.|`|jpAzVmG0aa	Aww I think that's so sweet. Don't push him away if he does turn out gay, but I highly doubt he is. He's just so grateful to have you that's he's probably gone a bit soft when expressing how he feels for you as a friend. Don't worry too much about it, it's like when you have a friend you love SO much, not romantically necessarily, but totally grateful to them and there's no word to describe how you feel about them...so I say that's what he meant.|`|6sJhoXAAaa	I think he just means you know what he's been going through and you have stood by him, and probably that he would do the same for you.|`|ygPCDOskaa	in this situation, i think that he just means that you guys are really good friends. if after time passes and you think that he's coming on to you, ask him about it lol.|`|cv222GL1aa	well it could mean that you've helped him and he respects you for that, but I do see the possibility of him liking you. I hope your question gets answered|`|01kEv36Faa	He thinks he may have known you in another life.  Your soul mate doesnt have to be a romantic interest.  Thats a misconception of the term.  It means your souls are friends.|`|a315d4b46f075e0544a1da68a65bc218aa	He's Gay Your Gay So you Guys may say|`|bmu6uhQ3aa	Well... he definitely likes you. I think you should be straight forward and just ask him.|`|AzQKdIAxaa	he likes you :)<br>  <br>  i dont think in the gay way...<br>  <br>  probably likes you as a best friend|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	Well... either he's wanting to test the waters before he openly comes out of the closet, or... you are just his heterosexual life partner. My best friend and I call each other that because we are super close. But we've never gone as far as to call each other our soul mates. I did tell her a couple times that if I was a man I'd date her... but since I'm not she's tough outta luck.|`|Lutgw5Z9aa	Being someones 'soul mate' doesn't really necessarily mean being someone's 'lover'. He probably considers you as a sort of role model for him, and that he sees you as a model figure. But I do suggest asking him if his feelings for you are more intamate.|`|TXYBYFLHaa	it means he's been hurt and he trusts you, maybe he loves you more than he would a normal friend, but that doesn't mean he's gay, okay.|`|D20JGTwXaa	I think he meant he can confide in yo and that he thinks you guys are meant to be bestfriends. Im not seem gay but if yourso concerned just ask him what h means ...that is your best friend so just ask.|`|Rh7XsCL5aa	no clue could mean anything but hes probably gay|`|7GL815olaa	he is falling in love with u since you have done so much for him|`|JhvqUvlsaa	I agree with a couple of the answers; he is really grateful for your help, and feels a special bond between the two of you. I wouldn't worry about it unless he starts drawing closer to you and getting more intimate. Have no worries.|`|ZvhtPCWQaa	lmao, i think you know exactly what it means. now don't drop the soap.
AfnQ95Z5aa	There is ZERO legal requirement for a landlord to do anything like that based on a petition.  Even with a trillion signatures, there is no legal penalty or motivation for your landlord to do anything.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	Decide what behaviours you want changed, and document the observations of that behaviour, plus the damage it is causing.<br>  <br>  You can not ask for eviction without evidence of harm done, and evidence that this particular tenant has caused it. If the complaint is one that should be dealt with by police, such as noise infractions, you have to use that service first to document the problem in a way that the landlord can take to court.<br>  <br>  In all of this remember that the landlord must be able to get a legal eviction, and do not just hope the landlord  will take the time to document this problem for you.<br>  <br>  Now, in general, you should not have to request eviction, your first request should ask that the behaviour  stop. If it does not stop, then you advise the landlord that it has not stopped, and request that the landlord take all necessary action to prevent this behaviour causing damage to you.<br>  <br>  In general we can not call for eviction on the basis of behaviour that is not illegal and is not causing harm. But the case is still open to interpretation if no request from the landlord has been made to discontinue it.

And you are with him for two years, like you are not going to let go of that right - for just a guy you don't even know very well.<br>  I say leave the other guy; stick to you man, and enjoy your break.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you're going to make the right choice.|`|25Whzu2waa	Choose the one you think about the most.<br>  <br>  If you think about them equally, do spin the bottle. =]|`|e4317ce8f4113b0065b75473f383c255aa	hahha the old good guy bad guy.....<br>  <br>  I say go with the good guy. In the end, the bad guy will eff you over. Seriously. you might have a good time with him in the beginning, but he will screw you over! I SWEAR! IT ALWAYS HAPPENS.<br>  <br>  The good guy (the guy you are taking a break from), he will do you good. If you are losing feelings for him, then I suggest you just take a break from guys until you find someone who cares about you and you trully "care" about them.<br>  Or if you are the kinky, go crazy and be with aLLL GUYYSss''s<br>  jh kljkf fsa jblah blah|`|mrF6N9fiaa	I am in a similar situation. What I learned from it though is that the guy who is a hardass and is not boyfriend material won't ever change until he is ready. He will do what he wants, when he wants and doesn't care how it will affect you and or anybody for that matter. For example, my guy who would be the not boyfriend material type likes drinking and working and has never really had a actual girlfriend he just does the whole hook up thing and is fine with it he tries to say he wants a relationship and cares about me but I can tell you from experience regardless of if they care, sometimes it's not worth the fight. You shouldn't have to change him. If he can't see what he has when he has you then so be it, his loss. Move on. And as far as your boyfriend, if you are only with him for security you should let that go as well and start over entirely fresh and be friends with him. (I should take my own advice actually) But anyways, I wish you luck! Let me know how it turns out :)|`|w9f1EPLZaa	I had this same issue. I was dating a guy and then another guy from high school over christmasbreak confessed he liked me. i knoe its difficult..because you want to make the right decision and be happy. it seems like ure b/f is really into you, but maybe ure not ready to be tied down...ure young...date a little. when i had this problem...this is the advice i received that ill pass on to you...<br>         Look at ureself in the mirror and say these two statements to ureself:<br>  1. I am going to break up with my boyfriend who is a great guy that gives me security so I can date another guy who is a hardass and can't express his feelings.<br>  2. I am going to reject this other guy,who is a hardass because I have a sweet boyfriend worth working on a relationship with.<br>  <br>  Now make one of the statements actually come true. it should the statement you feel less guilty saying out loud to yourself in front of a mirror.|`|98LDN0Quaa	Are you going to marry your Bf?

The new guy seems like a rebound from your breakup with your ex. This new guy sounds like a jerk. Why?:<br>  1)He's a hard ***<br>  2)he doesnt express his feelings<br>  3)you don't know him that well, and he's only shows you the beginning stages of infatution because you're new<br>  Your ex is obviously still crazy about you too and plus he gives you the secuity you deserve. But in the end you either choose one, or don't choose anyone at all if its causing you stress. I don't know why you and ur ex broke up in the first place, but if its something that you two can work through together then talk to him & work it out.|`|HEWZfmLQaa	I had the same problem. Bad boys are good in the beginning but the novelty soon wears off, if your bf respects you and genuinly wants to be with you he sounds like a nice guy. But if your having to choose he's obviously not everything you want. Perhaps you need your bf to be a bit more exciting..?<br>  <br>  I would ignore them both for a bit. See which one you miss the most, think about what you like about each of them, and which of these characteristics is most important to you. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|HM70Xllhaa	Hey im a girl on my older brothers account.I know how it's like because that happend to me once. This is one thing u can try friend get a list of each thing  like about each guy if its still to hard to decide tell both that you need some time to decide so you can get more awnsers to who you like if one guy it just not being right to you see if any of your friends are friends with him so u can take both guys out some where ,but its not a date, so you can get to know them more. If at the end you know your awnser thats great. Turning down one guy will be har but dont just break his heart give him your sorry and tell him that you think its just not gonna work out. I hope this helped you!

unVj43Xxaa	I think that's normal at the beginning of a relationship. You don't want someone you are seriously attracted to see you in any bad way whether it's food on your face or something nasty hanging out of your nose. I think after you get more used to each other you'll get past it. Now if you can't eat or eat very little around anyone then that's more of an eating disorder.|`|SRZza0cWaa	give it time.. maybe you've not been with him for long..x|`|tO8ey3o8aa	u jus gotta get comfortable<br>  how about u two have a lil whip cream fight so u can get comfortable wit being messy around each other|`|M6QvkEBEaa	you are still shy around him becuase you care too much about him and what he thinks of you. Next time force it out and purposely flick some food at him ( if he wont get nmad at you) or better yet hang some spaghetti over yourlip like a moustache and make a face.

No good guy gives up his gf because of the lack of sex.  Neither would he compare you to any other girl.  You can't worry about him leaving you.  He can still leave you after taking your virginity.

That's all I'm sayin'.<br>  <br>  I say you need to find out if he is in love with you or just with you for sex. Since I know that women find it hard to tell if a guy is genuine or not, so here are some guidelines to tell if a guy loves you and not just for the sex: <br>  1) he spends time with you just because he wants to and not because it's expected of him <br>  2) he tries to impress you; act manly, tries to show smarts and cunning<br>  3) he calls you about once or so a day just to say hi<br>  4) he gets nervous around you<br>  5) this one is the real teller. When you guys just started to go out, was he rushing you and all touching you, or was he more of a chauffeur and touching you on your arms, back but not your legs or ***. It's a thing that he wants you to like him and not see him as the type of guy who just wants a girl for her body. When a guy does that, he wants the girl to know that he wants her for her and not her body.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

My advice would be to move forward and find someone who respects you and deserves you.  Good luck to you.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	I would say if you two were already broken up then if he messed around with another girl it wouldn't be cheating or anything but he didn't have to tell you all the details about it because that's just rude and I don't think you want to know anyways.

If he's stubborn then he's wanting attention from you. Sometimes they need that. Even though your getting older and doing different things still try to take time out for him again, he will appreciate it and as you two get older he will understand what happened then as he goes and does his own thing and may forget about you for awhile. I was the oldest of 5 and they all did it to get my attention. We all miss that time in our lives when we were close knit and played together and couldn't be separated.

73nSUKNKaa	Love is one of the most awesome things you can have in your life, and if you lose it, it HURTS BAD. But, there is a way to avoid this emotional trauma. <br>  <br>  <br>  1. Stay Calm- Don't overreact to breaking up- everyone does it once in their life.<br>  <br>  2. Bury yourself in happy things- Watch comedies, hang out with friends, do anything to laugh and be happy.<br>  <br>  3. If ANYTHING about him comes up, ignore it- Whether it's his name, or a question like "Are you still with him?" might get in the way of your happiness which is the most important thing if you break up<br>  <br>  4. Accept it- Accept the fact that you two are not dating. So what? There are other leaves on a tree, some are better than others. Don't stay in denial and torture yourself.<br>  <br>  <br>  All the best.|`|UgRjdNRoaa	yes it hurts and im not gonna lie and say it doesnt its one of the worst feelings... if it does happen you will feel really down wont want to do anything the best thing to do is keep friends close if it goes upside down for you they will be there to build you back up but it doesnt always happen good luck :)|`|BjyXKFpRaa	to hold on to that love you must Communicate,be honest,and just make sure that you have time for each other,and most of all don't make any rush decisons but and pray about it.|`|coQ3EPTbaa	well it kinda hurts for us guys at first, it depends how serious it is. but time heals all wounds.
Mubj1o2eaa	Don't invite her. But make sure to keep it on the down low so she doesn't get her feelings hurt. Good luck =)|`|bmu6uhQ3aa	I don't think you should feel guilty. She has new friends already. Does she invite you guys to her outings?|`|3y0w1qIBaa	No, you shouldn't be guilty, but she is the one who ditched you.|`|Likst1Mxaa	Just coz she used to be friends with you, doesn't mean you have to friends now. Move on, clearly she has too.
oOU6XJOqaa	Hopefully, you will hit your growth spurt in high school and not have too worry about this problem, but any retarded crack head can tell you that. My advice may sound a little dim witted, but if you really wanted to get with a girl, try not to appeal as an aggressive short teenager. Girls open up easier to guys with a good sense of comedy, good personality, and someone who respects her feminism and treats her as if she is a princess. Try to keep it cool though, and if all else fails, you have plenty of time, trust me, the chicks come.... they always do.|`|4ASENeVWaa	I would love to go out with you and its cute but uh it depends what type of girl  who is attractive to you. Also I have a 19 year old cousin and im like taller then her and she's short but not  midget short also she has a lot of boys who are attractive to her she popular and everything to bad though she taken but yeah . she's the average size of a 12 or 13 year old and looks like  she's 14.So yeah it won't affect you getting a girl friend.|`|SDXhdNAqaa	hey man im a guy so let me give you some advice. Its pretty cool that you beat the Sh!% out of kids who call you short and i dont think it would matters if your small.  if you talk to alot of girls and if they dont care if your short just be cool. and trust me the perfect girl will come for you trust me i know. and if they know you will beable to stand up for yourself because your short then they'll like you and the best part(dont take this the wrong way) your small enough to fit in the hole.<br>  Thats what she said but seriouslly take my advice|`|EpHdThEwaa	girls who dont date someone because they are short, are retarted. its whats in the heart. im 5 foot three and will be for the rest of my life because im half asian. and yet this guy wants to have sex. and im only in the seventh grade and hes in eighth. i know if i got to know you although your height and if i liked you id date you.|`|1j2TsvQWaa	to tell you the truth you wont get girls now. when u get to high school then you will sadly girls in 8th grade like guys who look older such as guys in high school iam 5'5 in the eigth grade and they think thats short... but anyway sadly girls liek older looking guys but dont worry your still young you will grow big time in high school|`|4CebuvRhaa	At your age hight shouldnt be the sole criterion. what matters more is how good are you at making the girl laugh, comfortable and make the time spent togather plesurable..hight does have some benefit but hey you still have time to grow pal...do some exercise and stretch...|`|VF9yqFM2aa	well obviously a tall girl wouldn't date a really short guy. but at about 5'3 and under i dont think any girls would really have a problem with it. As long as you can still dance with them, that would be my biggest concern.|`|BwDyi4ESaa	well, im in your grade too and im 5'1 and im pretty short. but that doesn't mean you cant get a girl freind but you just have to work harder for one. and you will grow so dont worry and just have fun with your life(:|`|p0QCWtYEaa	You can get a GF. i like short guys better for some reason..Dont ask haha just talk to the ones you like alot and figure out if they mind or not|`|JIliSm46aa	if you come off tough its sorta weird. fake girls will care<br>  the ones that are real wont. but its hard to tell the dif, girls will say whatever just to get what they want|`|B22h0TI9aa	Hold up i think i know you is you elijah? cuz dat f**er beat up 2 bois (at diff. times tho) that were at least 1 foot taller then him they were literaly almost 6ft and he made one of them bleed hes my lil buddi|`|OnTEn16saa	i know ALOT of grls shorter than u. <br>  (yeah i make fun of them 2) but they ALWAYS get bf. they have new ones evry week. its not fun :( so no its not becouse ur short|`|4StO2m0iaa	u will grow in time guys mature slower than girls anyway and if u don't theres always some grow pill once u turn 18!|`|qAd0QmZEaa	well i am 5'6" so..... sorry!|`|bf5b66f1bb788d21b8a5b9272febaed2aa	HELL YA i would never go out with a guy that short .........<br>  sorry|`|FprrMexEaa	if a girl really likes u<br>  she wudnt care how tall u r|`|08jvhNLDaa	4'9 lol man u wont be beatin up no one for much longer lol|`|Q7vMH7akaa	Uhhh yeah that would be a problem for most girls I know. Good thing you're not weak though. Luckily for you you probably haven't started your growth spurt. If you add how tall your parents are, I can probably tell you what height you might get to. Anyway, find another short girl in your grade and try to get with her. It's okay if she is around 3" taller than you (around 5'0). There are some really short girls out there, so I don't think it's the end of the world for you. Good luck bro. Btw, make sure you're doing everything needed to grow correctly (8+ hours of sleep daily, eating right, not smoking/doing drugs), and buy some taller shoes.|`|g6Vci5SUaa	Most boys I've known have had a growth spurt between the end of 8th grade and freshman year.  My nephew grew six inches one summer.  You haven't stopped growing yet.  Give it time.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Dude, you are going to grow, a lot. Don't think you are done. Men usually grow from 16-19 so you have a long way to go. Also, it is based on genes. How tall are your parents. I know my mom is 5'4" and my dad is 6'0" and I take after my mom. I am 17 and 5'3" and I am short for my age, but no matter. <br>  <br>  And kids won't pick on you because you are short. When I was in high school, kids picked on anyone who they thought was worth picking on. This could be the biggest kid, the tallest kid, the toughest kid. It doesn't matter. My brother was big and they picked on him because he was quiet, so it isn't just height.|`|1Lo34oEDaa	i really dont look at the outside i care more wats on the inside i like a guy with a good personality and i really didnt hear anything about your personality so i cant really answer this fully. but trust me you will eventually grow just wait till about 9 or 10 grade =)|`|Geqb39wxaa	hey there bud! im in 8th grade 2! to honestly answer your question, at first i would probably be bothered by your height. but if you had a great personality and i knew you were a nice guy i would get over your shortness. <br>  and dont worry, we are only in 8th grade so you have plenty of time to find a gf!<br>  <br>  Good Luckkk!!|`|0ktcvglRaa	You will probably get taller after you enter high school, so I wouldn't worry about it just yet.|`|0w9tY32uaa	well your in 8th grade, so you just haven't gone through a growth spurt yet.<br>  <br>  and i'm only 5'1, so i wouldn't mind at all.<br>  and i don't think any girl really would let your height stop them from going out with you if they really liked you for you!<br>  only a superficial snobby girl would do that, and if she does, she is not the right girl for you.|`|a7Fk95l6aa	You probably couldn't beat anyone up. Stop watching DragonBall or whatever is giving you the impression that you can.<br>  <br>  Anyway, kid, please don't worry about this. It's way better than being tall but small-membered (that's just an example, I'm not referencing anyone in particular *ahem*)|`|d8LyjT8Xaa	well, i am tall and i'm in 8th grade. If a short guy asked me out that was 4'9, iwould say no only because im 5'6. but if i was around 5'3 or something, i wouldnt have a problem with it. I only would say no though because is would be kinda akward hugging and stuff.|`|xaiNyZSVaa	lol im also short ( 5'0) but don't let that get to you if someone really likes you it won't matter to them how tall you are. There is a big chance you are going to get taller so don't let that be a barrier. And you're not short you're funsized :) Hope i helped!|`|69fa948353d1dbf575b7e1dd974f6570aa	welll I'm 5'8........that's almost a whole foot.And a really tall person and a really shory person don't match. But it's good that you would beat the crap out of some one|`|tnQOy5kdaa	truthfully, if i was you're age and 5'2" or taller i wouldn't go out with you cuz it would be ackward, but you are likely to hit a growth spurt soon so don't even worry about it|`|msvyruUSaa	how fat is your pecker?<br>  move that thing fast and faster and the chicks will wonder where the heck you came from.|`|BjyXKFpRaa	height does not matter all that matters is how you feel about each other and where your heart is.
lVIdENvqaa	I am very much in favor of assisted suicide.<br>  If a person is terminal and is suffering they sholud have that right to end their own lives.<br>  Thousands of good people do it every day to end their suffering physically.<br>  Why spend a minute in endless pain when you know there is no cure?<br>  That's just my opinion, and only my opinion. I don't know how others feel about it.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	I don't want some doctor getting rich from my death.  Unplug the machine, put a pillow over my head, inject me with a morphine overdose, whatever it takes to put me out of my misery when the time comes.  I do not want my lingering demise to be the reason my family goes bankrupt.  And once I'm gone, cremate me or at most, put me in the pine box, which is now actually cardboard.<br>  <br>  These are my wishes and following them is respectful.  A lengthy hospital stay and big funeral is disrespectful if I tell you not to do it and you do it anyway.

dda7rjTMaa	remember... you are not leaving mentally, only physically. Phones, email, etc. make it possible to still have old friends. Another thing, don't wait (I waited until a day b4 i transfered and it hurt them alot [well i found out about it 2 days b4 but thats not the point]) Just say that you have to leave, keep it short, the longer that you spend saying goodbye the harder it will be.|`|ROPLbLW9aa	Hi Abby<br>  <br>  the answer is simple. you dont die. you put up with being sad for a time and then you meet new people and a new phase of your life begins. keeping in constant contact with your friends throughout is essential. these days mobile phones and the internet make this very easy. when i was a teen my gf and her family moved to Australia. i had no phone and there was no internet. i got passed it and i'm sure you will. i'm guessing it wont be too long before you can travel to visit them all again. talk regularly to your folks and your pals about how this makes you feel. it will help keep you grounded. best of luck. remember that most of us here at Y!A are your friends too. keep in touch. :)|`|jJjfeylmaa	just stay in touch! and remember that these friendships will be forever, even if there is distance separating you. my boyfriend moved to switzerland (we live in WI) awhile ago, and had to say goodbye to all his friends and me. but he stays in touch through the internet, and talking on the phone, and we're almost in college, when he'll move back home to be with all of us again! :)|`|SD2agVWFaa	I've moved several times in my life. Change is something I've become accustomed to because of that. I used to HATE moving, having to say good-bye to old friends/boyfriends, etc..but I was strong and pushed through..which is what you'll have to do. Get used to the real world, sweetie..Life is tough.|`|lhrMI9f5aa	Well maybe throw a goodbye party to say bye to all of your friends and make them promise to call you often and visit them when your having a holiday.
lMKy9Ho8aa	oh, wow! it almost sounds like you are shallow. But, if you are not, then all you have to do is ACCEPT people for who they are. They are not their ambitions. What is their HEART like??

Some people are stuck with trying to make it on there own.  You can't judge someones life or personality based on their success. <br>  <br>  Maybe the person that your dating hasn't had the privilege to have that support.  Maybe in his eyes he is successful because of the accomplishments he's over come.  Which, isn't as great as your accomplishments.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Therefore, try to put yourself in other peoples shoes and start to see the bigger picture.  Also, maybe its your attitude towards this situation that's making it difficult for successful guys to find you attractive.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	Well if you want to be with this man that you are currently with, then I would suggest that you try to motivate him a little bit and see how he does. Most of the time though you are not going to be able to change the person so you might have to just put up with him. If you decide that you don't want to be with him later on down the road, then I would say try to seek out men that are more on your level. I think you already know what kind of guy you want but for some reason you choose the opposite.|`|WI9fN0vQaa	Try to focus on the things that are important: How does he treat you? What are his values?  Is he hard working and take pride in what he does?

Take this relationship as something fun. Be with this person because you want to hang out with him not because of his ambitions. Just be with him because he is fun. <br>  I would suggest find like minded people such as yourself.<br>  You need to explore the world and find the person who excites you and gets you moving to your full potential.<br>  I hope you find what you are looking for!|`|hRQRuwU8aa	I think ambitious and successful are vague terms. Vague in the sense that people can be ambitious, but introverted. Perhaps he just doesn't show how much he wants to succeed. As for success, is it financial or personal? If he's a slacker, then by all means, ditch him--you guys won't be compatible.|`|8I9laA15aa	It seems to me that maybe your choosing the wrong people for yourself.

Both our names our Sydney and we never had a boyfriend.<br>  <br>  But the best thing to do is to ask him. I am unsure if he likes you or not back because you didn't say anything about it in the summary. But you can sit him down and ask him in person, but if you are to scared to do so, when he texts you, or you text him first, tell him how you feel about him. Just say in the text that you are something you need to get off of your chest and then express away. He may put you down gently or he may like you back. Also, he seems very mature enough not to be a jerk about it. I mean age has nothing to do with "settling down." It depends on how that person is, and not their age. So just ask him is your best bet if you want the relationship to move somewhere. <br>  <br>  Good Luck

KSK22vHUaa	Look up the US census numbers.  It'll show you stats on couples who are married with no children and married with children.  Compare these figures to the US census from a few years earlier and you'll see a trend.  I know you asked for world statistics, but they don't really exist in a reliable medium.<br>  <br>  And for the record... spanking is a very good thing for young children.  When you get to college, you'll be able to pick out the spoiled wimpy kids who weren't spanked from the strong independent ones who were.  I definitely noticed.|`|AA10065812	???????<br>  First off, in the U.S., 55% of all children are now being born to single mothers, by choice.<br>  <br>  Second, there's nothing wrong with spanking, as long as it's in moderation and with love.  The main thing is uniformity.  Pick a discipline and stick with it for all object lessons.  Under the age of puberty, children have no concept of right or wrong, just action and reaction.  They act, you react.  It takes six times doing something for it to become a permanent memory path in the brain.  If your reaction to their action changes from one event to the next, you have created two separate memory paths, making your job twice as hard.  If you swat them for something, and they go back and do it again, just swat them again, until their brain connects your reaction to their action, and they stop doing it.  And find something new for you to react to.  <br>  <br>  It's been over 40 years, but I remember the times my brother drove my mother crazy.  Like the time, as age 3, he got his hands on some tools.  He took the back off the roll around dishwasher, took a lot of things apart inside, than put the back, back on.  The next time dishes gone washed, so did the whole kitchen floor.  The repairman was laughing so hard that he put it back together and didn't charge my parents for the work.  He also took a before and after photo, with my brother standing beside it, for his shop wall.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	I  have four young  children  and I am a FIRM believer in spanking children I think it gives them a small amount of discipline that they need|`|IvMPh09baa	your asking us to do your  homework for you?  are you seriuos?? <br>  <br>  Listen, obviously you can get on YA to ask this, so that means you can also type this question into google and DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.  <br>  <br>  Do your own work, don't try to get us to do this for you.<br>  <br>  And by the way, disciplined children is necessary.... otherwise you have a bunch of ill behaved children running amuck.|`|n8lXItGraa	I was married...and had 2 children..I'm not sure if that will help or not...but it's all I got!<br>  <br>  Oh...the no spanking of children.  I totally disagree.  I gave my kids a SWAK when needed, and they grew up with respect.  My grandson has absolutely no respect for most people.  It's taught in school that spanking is bad, and parents are afraid to lay a hand on their children...and the kids know this.  There aren't any consequences for their actions.  I have seen a change in just the past 10 years of today's youth..it's not a good change either.  So...no I don't agree with NOT spanking a child.

If both you and your husband have talked about i...what would happen, what the results would be of it...and you decide it's okay and want to do it, that's your choice...go for it. But be aware of the fact that if it does happen, one or both of you might regret it later and feel awkward and then it would put strain on your relationship.<br>  <br>  If you both want to experience it, then go for it.

lBZkXzr0aa	When her "peoples"  are talking to him and passing notes his way,  your boyfriend should be standing by your side and not talking to them or associating himself with them.  They (including Monkey-face) are acting petty and jealous.  Your boyfriend needs to stand up for you and himself.  Tell these little girls to grow the hell up and get over it.   When they are approaching him to talk to him he should ignore and walk the other way.  <br>  <br>  It would make more of an impact if he tells them to respect you and your realtionship in front of Monkey-face and her friends.  It can't be one sided that you are sick of the treatment,  he has to back u up all the way!  <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|cce40468b79d350af3a0e1388f5dd17eaa	To answer your question...it's not your place to get rid of your ex's problem, it's your man's position to put her in her place... he should be willing to say, "look, I am with so and so know, so I would appreciate it if you respect our relationship." You shouldn't have to say a thing!

3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	If they both make minimum wage, it will probably be around 200 a month, maybe a bit more (that is what my husband and uncle had to pay when they made minimum, but he can be reevaluated every 3 years). As far as back support, he will more than likely be slammed with that as well. I have a friend that didn't know he had a daughter until she was almost 5 (one night stand) When he took the DNA test and was proved to be the father he had to pay back support + the medical bills from delivery because the mother used the medical card. My husband's uncle had something similar happen too.<br>  I think your son would be wise to consult with an attorney. He may think he can't afford one, but sometimes you can't afford not to have one.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	Yes your son will have to pay back child support.  In Ohio they have tables that set the amount of support.  I think it is about $60 per week per child.  If both mom and dad work then they will share in the amount according to the percentage of their income.  I.e. The dad makes 75% and mom makes 25%.  They will divide the support accordingly.  Hope this helps.|`|AA11806606	If your son was stupid enough to have unprotected sex; he will have the pleasure of supporting that child until it is 18 years old.  If he does not pay child support; he will be sitting in a jail cell where he will become someone else's lover.  The courts may require him to get two jobs to pay for HIS child.  He made this child and it's his responsibility to care for it.|`|AA10065812	Yes, child support will be retroactive.  The amount will be 15-20% of his gross income, not taking into consideration related factors.<br>  <br>  Now, here's a life lesson for him.<br>  <br>  I've worked with divorced and single fathers for 20 years.  <br>  <br>  AS A REMINDER TO ALL SINGLE MEN SHACKING UP WITH A WOMAN.

ONLY THE COURTS CAN GRANT YOU ANY RIGHTS.<br>  <br>  I REPEAT, SINGLE FATHERS IN 97% OF THE U.S. AND ITS TERRITORIES HAVE NO RIGHTS.   YOU ARE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE, BUT YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS UNTIL YOU ARE GRANTED THEM.  THE MOTHER HAS AUTOMATIC SOLE LEGAL CUSTODY OF THE CHILD.  <br>  <br>  SINGLE MEN MAKE THEMSELVES INTO A SLAVE CLASS THAT MUST ASK PERMISSION OF THE MASTER (THE MOTHER) OR HER LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE (THE COURTS) FOR PERMISSION TO SEE YOUR CHILD.  AND EVEN THAN, 60% OF THE TIME, ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT STUDIES, YOU WILL BE DENIED ACCESS TO YOUR CHILD, LOSING ALL CONTACT WITHIN FIVE YEARS.<br>  <br>  SHE GOES TO CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT TO REQUEST AN ORDER PLACED ON YOU.<br>  <br>  YOU GET SERVED.<br>  <br>  YOU PAY FOR THE DNA TEST.<br>  <br>  YOU PAY ALL COURT COSTS.<br>  <br>  YOU PAY ATTORNEY FEES.<br>  <br>  IF THE CHILD IS UP TO 18 YEARS OLD, YOU PAY RETROACTIVE CHILD SUPPORT, PLUS UP TO 18 YEARS INTEREST PENALTIES, BASED ON YOUR CURRENT INCOME, NOT WHAT YOU’VE EARNED OVER THE YEARS, EVEN IF YOU WERE UNDERAGE AND NOT WORKING AT THE TIME SHE GOT PREGNANT.<br>  <br>  SINCE THE HEARING IS STRICKLY MEANT TO ESTABLISH SUPPORT, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FILE FOR CUSTODY AND/OR VISITATION RIGHTS.  THAT REQUIRES A SEPARATE HEARING, WHICH YOU WILL ALSO PAY FOR.  <br>  <br>  WHETHER YOU ARE LIVING WITH HER OR NOT, YOU VOLUNTARILY SELL YOURSELF INTO SLAVERY THE MOMENT YOU TOOK YOUR PECKER OUT OF YOUR PANTS WITH A WOMAN YOU WERE NOT MARRIED TO.  SHE HAS 100% OF THE RIGHTS AND YOU HAVE NONE.<br>  <br>  You have an up mountain, not hill, battle ahead of you.  In a word, prepare, prepare, prepare.<br>  <br>  Get an order enter forcing a DNA test, unless one has already been done.<br>  <br>  DO NOT PAY ANY KIND OF SUPPORT FOR THE CHILD UNTIL A DNA TEST IS DONE, AS IT ACKNOWLEDGES YOUR FINANCIALY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CHILD.<br>  <br>  Once you begin paying child support, regardless of whether you are the father or not, you can be required to continue paying.<br>  <br>  If one has been done, go to the child support enforcement to setup a voluntary order.

The court is going to order you to take it anyway, so by showing you’ve taken it only looks good to them.<br>  <br>  Start keeping a daily journal of all you activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.  <br>  <br>  Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  You’re that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,<br>  <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/taping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcfp.org/taping/</a><br>  <br>  The court will order you into mediation, so take the lead first.  Instead of hiring attorneys, suggest to her to go to a mediator and try to hammer out an agreement.  A mediator is an attorney or paralegal with certified training as a mediator.  You each have to pay half the fees in order for the mediator to have the appearance of being unbiased.<br>  <br>  If you and the mother are civil, consider Bird Nest Custody.  In this the child lives in one home and each parent live there for 3-4 weeks, than switch.  You live with friends, family, rent a room, etc. on the off time.  In this manner, your child’s life is not disrupted.  They are not being shifted back and forth.  They keep their own room, friends, school, etc.  It is hard on the parents, but than the child comes first.

She's the one up side down, her mouth will be right in front of where she needs to be.  She will put her hands at your back and bottom to make sure not to fall.  So, the weight you have to carry is less than her body weight.  You are standing up.  Make sure to put her thighs on your shoulders (like sitting on your face), that allows your shoulders to carry the weight.  You can't rely on your arms to hold her body steadily.  Cuz when you are sweating, you will drop her.  Then you grab her hip (like lifting things up) and do your thing with your mouth.<br>  <br>  When both of you feel good, you'll start to lose concentration, that's the more dangerous part.  Make sure you concentrate.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|215646253ac5e0903ab28bc43e031fd3aa	Ha. <br>  <br>  The only safe way to do a stand up 69 is to hang someone from<br>  gravity inversion (perversion) boots. <br>  <br>  It is totally cool.|`|afsAAunIaa	There are certainly worse problems to have lol.

I know what it feels like to be an outcast, because when I was in high school everyone knew I enjoyed singing, dancing and acting so when ever their were any auditions in the city they would invite me. Eventually because my mom hears so many bad things about north Philadelphia, west and south she never allowed me to go.  So the outcome was that they stopped inviting me to come along. I wish I could tell you how to fit in but I can't because I am now 21 and she still doesn't want me to go anywhere because she's so afraid of everything. What makes it worse is that she's glued to the news on the tv so she's constantly paranoid. Best of luck and I hope you do not follow my same path. Could you let me know what happens? Alex

MyxJ3REhaa	This question is a bit hard to understand.  Both you and this boy love each other, yes?  If you love each other, the other friend should have nothing to do with what you call each other.  It does depend on the cultural situation, but in most cultures, you are free to address one another as you would like.<br>  <br>  I would say that if his friend is being offensive and trying to ruin the relationship that you have, it is time for your boyfriend (or the boy that you love) to stand up to his friend and explain that his behavior is offensive and to stop.  If his friend does not, it is clear that he is not a true friend.  You should not have to change because of what others think or say – if you are of age to make adult decisions, make those decisions for yourself.  If you are underage, ask advice of parents, teachers, or other trusted adults.
kCbJ89nXaa	Good men are raised by their mothers and shaped by their fathers.  But if either one of them falls down on the job then society and culture fills in the blanks.

8cN4e8Vmaa	You are spoiling her with soft love and she needs tough love. I was a brat just like her. she needs her dads love. My mom was just like you and for some reason I couldn't honestly feel love for my mom until now. BUT!!! I always found my dad and have him in my life (somewhat) you are just going to have to be patient with her. She has to grow up and learn what you went through for her to understand why are you who you are. So (nicely) she's a brat. Mind you I was and is one too. I"m 26 now. I don't have time to read your whole text but what I did read she sounds like me. Let her mature and understand life. Toughen up a bit. Don't push her away but...you'll figure out what I mean...Good Luck!|`|XQe8rlH7aa	Unfortunately, there is no hand book for raising teens!!  I wish there were...<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are extremely understanding to her needs and you seem to have open communication.  It appears to me to be the angst of being a teenager, your mom never really understands at this age.  From the text I gathered there was a situation but before it was over you both apologized and went on with your day, I'd say that was a success.<br>  <br>  Your daughter is extremely bright for her age, however, she is still only 16, being in college does not automatically mature you.  She is probably experiencing some feelings of not belonging and maybe some insecurity being that she is unable to completely socialize at the college level, she may be able to compete academically, but not socially, because of the age difference.<br>  <br>  Give her time and just keep reassuring her that you love her and are proud of her.  In time she will learn to appreciate the sacrifices that you have made for her happiness, it's a growing process.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps, good luck.
5SCD87hTaa	ask them to sit down and talk with you about it. they know you know whats going on but most parents are scared to talk to their kids about it. everyone will keep telling you its not your fault its not your fault but you know that. i always hated that when my councilor would tell me that. i am not stupid and i know you are not either. you Just want to know whats going on and unfortunately for my case a probably yours too they will not tell you. my parents still will not talk about it and that happened 7 years ago for me. people fall in and out of love and when this happens they fight a lot. by letting your parents know that you love them both and support what ever decision they make it will help them open up a little more. you might never know what went wrong and i wish there was something that i could tell you to make this easier but there is nothing but time. in the end, if it goes that far, you will still see your parents, not as much as you will like, but enough to make it through till college. in the long run if they are fighting as much as mine did it will be better after they are divorced. they are happier apart and they are always glad to see you. when you get older you will be able to make things work a little better because what you tell them they will listen too a little more, i had to tell my mom to stop yelling at my dad every time she dropped me off or picked me up. after 16 you will be able to just drive over on the weekends and avoid all that uncomfertableness. you ever need to talk about it talk to a minister a church or a counciler at school. or if your parents get crazy like mine a private divorce counciler. all three will always tell you its not your fault cause they dont understand what you are going through, only someone that has been there before really knows. counciler's are not good for relating to what you are going through but they are good to vent to. just remember what ever you tell them is like telling it to your parents, you can use that to your advantage just be careful. you want to ever talk just message me ill get you my email address. i hope this helps a little.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	nothing you can do. this is adult business. you dont know the dymanics of their relationship. if she's always crying, something is going on. <br>  <br>  just dont chose sides. talk to a cousnelor to vent. and let your parents know you love them, but it wiil take an adjustment to cope with their divorce. <br>  <br>  dont try to fix this.|`|AA10684513	It really is between your mom and dad but you can help by not taking sides and being there if they need you.|`|4RgXh3ftaa	Sit down and talk to them and let them know how it affecting you.

My parents got divorced a couple of years ago over some things.. but! arguing doesn't necessarily mean that they are gonna divorce. <br>  <br>  the best thing to do is have a private word with someone close to your mum. an older person like an Uncle or Auntie or your mums best friend to see if every thing's alright and be there to help.

YbwDFvEaaa	You could try talking to your friend, but I wouldn't become involved any more than voicing your concerns. I certainly would not go as far as helping her ex-husband in court.<br>  <br>  Tell her that you really care for her, and that is why you're concerned that her neglectful behavior will hurt her chances at gaining custody of her children. It is a difficult time in her life and she obviously isn't handling it in the healthiest of ways, by avoiding the pain of the situation by consistent partying. If she keeps it up, the pain of losing her children will be far worse than the pain of losing a husband. <br>  <br>  Beyond telling her that you care about her and are concerned, there's really not much else you can do. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	You should step in.

Being that close to her it's your duty to tell her when she's wrong and I'm sure you want to help her in anyway you can.|`|AA10874773	you probably have the best view of the entire situation - dont stay out of it.  your the unbiased opinion here.  tell her what you think, for everyones sake!|`|vR4k5iVCaa	i think you should tell her and then step out of it. being a mother she should already know but the fact is she doesn't and maybe no one has actually told her how selfish she is being.|`|FhrCLLzFaa	She might not listen to you and get mad at you, but if you care that much I really think that you should intervene|`|YZddsudlaa	confront her now! if that doesnt work report her|`|aBwQ06A6aa	Yes, thats what u need to do. If she doesnt listen to u then go to her ex husband, or CPS. If something happens to her kids and u knew they were in danger and did nothing, u could have some of the blame. So u need to talk to someone. I wish u and ur friends family the best! I'll be praying. God Bless. :)<br>  <br>  PS- usually u shouldnt get involved, but if there are lives in danger, u have to! If shes an alcoholic or a druggy or whatever tell her to get some help.|`|8bP67U8Taa	Well is she is your friend then why are you trying to help the husband. And if she doesn't care about her kids, then let the husband keep them and let her make her own decision. She obviously doesn't want the kids. You actually think she is going to change her mind because of your opinion?|`|ksKQspiNaa	Tell her EXACTLY what you just said. She needs to hear it now more then ever. Do what you think is best for the kids. Although it's not your children, "It takes a village" which means you should step in when you see that something is wrong.|`|lk83yunLaa	Always have the childrens best interest at heart.  If you are a real friend you will have a private talk with her about it.  If she chooses to think your meddling and gets mad then you have done what you could for her.|`|nBjvf8Kqaa	call up CPS they'll send the kids to a good home|`|EDBRoNGsaa	Kids cannot fend for themselves, they rely on their parents to take care of them.  Being that young and if they have always lived their lives in this situation, they know no other way of life.  They are young, innocent children and it is the responsibility of adults to step in to protect children from abuse of any form.  Even though you have been friends for many years, it is about the safety and well-being of the children.  If she is being irresponsible, it won't look good in the court's eyes anyway.  If you feel it necessary, you could always speak to the husband and tell him that you would be willing to testify should he need it.  Hopefully this mother will wake up and realize that she has little ones that depend on her for love, affection, and stability.  It is not the fault of the children that they were brought into this world by an uncaring parent.  We can only hope that through people like you who care about them that they will grow up to be caring people themselves.
0fVtHNtmaa	Why would you marry someone who tells strange lies?|`|Zi2Sw3ngaa	umm..i dont really know..but it dosent sound natural..id just try to fix things between you two..ask him what hes up to and talk to him<br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA11603529	Rings made of copper will leave am ugly blackish green mark around your finger. But it sounds like a bad omen anyway! Force that boy to tell the truth! And if you think he's going to cheat on you, there must be a legitimate reason for your woes.|`|CRk1goz4aa	I'm not sure if it's a bad omen, but it could be a sign. Plus, I'm a firm believer in trusting your intuition. There is a reason something inside of you is telling you something is wrong. Check into that. It's better to find out what's going on before you get married. Good luck!|`|Wrn6WH7xaa	It could be, if you believe in those kinds of things.<br>  <br>  Bruises can take time to appear on the skin, are you sure you didn't bang it the day before? Or maybe hit a night stand in your sleep?<br>  <br>  It is pretty weird that it was on your ring finger though. Spooky.|`|AJhx8zUVaa	no it isn't maybe he is trying to plan something for you. I know bad omens and that not one i have heard of before but i can be wrong|`|1p0bWVKGaa	Yes. Hunny if he is already lieing to you then hes a DOG. That's the first step. And bruises that is MOST DEFINITELY a sign.|`|csBUWm4raa	BAD 4 sure!!! LOL|`|UXgGGwAdaa	yes...duh!|`|LETd2hQwaa	If you're having doubts about your fiance then you need to get the bottom of it quickly. How well do you really know this man? A woman's intuition rarely leads her wrong. I suggest you watch Tyler Perry's Madea videos--- I love those plays/movies because aside from being absolutely funny, there is a lot of truth in them about people and relationships. If he's telling lies, strange or not, that's a problem alone. You need to be able to trust him because you will be spending the rest of your life with him. Don't rush into this marriage without having it out with him. Don't worry about whether he will still want to marry you if you nag him about it or not because at the end of the day, you'll want to be happy, secure and confident with your decision. If he has a problem with you trying to get the bottom of it, then he obviously has something to hide. You're gonna be marrying this man after all, communication is key. If you can't talk it out now, then you may as well walk away before you end up regretting the fact that you stayed years later when you've been married for years with children and his strange lies have gotten even stranger and more obvious. I don't believe in omens (could be something unreal about the ring or maybe you just had a bad reaction to it) but I do believe in common sense. Goodluck.

FhrCLLzFaa	infatuation silly goose|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	for the first 6 to 18 months it's infatuation.

Who doesnt love their friends! Secondly, time will only tell if this relationship will work out so just wait and see if things start to pick up. If they don't, you will always have a best friend and we all need one of those! But to be honest, I was quite infatuated with my boyfriend before I fell in love with him. Truly falling in love takes time. I have to say I feel much more in love after 5 yrs than I did at the beginning and boy was I ever hooked on him even then!|`|R0ncW2wNaa	what a person is meant for u?u only get the ans when u r far from him.if he is not with u and u r not getting any joy from anything that means that person is more imp.then u think.that means u love him otherwise it is .......................................|`|0UqOwLCjaa	That's something only you can know for sure.

CRk1goz4aa	Your friends seem like the type of women that think that having a man is the only way to be happy. That's on them. I'm in the same boat and my friends are more concerned with me being single than I am. BUT! All you need to say that when you meet the right guy for you...then you'll settle down and until then you will get as much out of single life as you can. I dont' mind being single because the past couple of guys that have came my way have had issues and baggage and I just don't. So, I had to make a choice to let them go. Maybe they don't understand...but they only mean well. They are giving you the advise they would want for themselves. Just understand you are different and going at a different pace. Nothing wrong with that, Miss Independent! Besides, when you live your life and meet the right person and settle down, I'm pretty sure you won't ever feel like you missed out on something else. Most of my friends that have the situations like your friends will constantly tell me they are jealous at how free I am and how they wish they had done.......(whatever it is they wish). They always feel like they missed out on something. <br>  Good luck!|`|R0ncW2wNaa	every body has his own idea.so what ever they think does't matter.the real thing which matter is what do u want from ur life.if u have ur ideas clear then do it ur way.
lNlL0Ag2aa	In Dubai, the man will win under Muslim traditions, that's why he's begging you to do it in Dubai. Remember that Islamic countries consider women as inferior.

E2X6B1Iaaa	Well, I wouldn't dump him just because of bad sex because you can improve that. Have you told him how you feel? If not, do that first. <br>  <br>  Try bringing in toys, try different positions..in other words, try out a variety of things and see what works. It is worth the effort, right?<br>  <br>  If none of these things work, I would seriously consider that maybe its just not meant to be. If you're not physically attracted to someone and if the sex stinks, you won't be happy.|`|uuMCGT9taa	i think sex is a huge factor in a relationship and it doenst have to be the best but it does have to have passion and heat and love and its all good.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	Hey  I think my question would probably look just like yours...:P <br>  we are in the same situation and i think it'll be great to talk to someone about it..i think all the advice you can get is good to a certain point..but really if you want to talk add me.

Bad sex doesn't lead to infidelity, you cheat only because you want to and you make the decision to! It's not something sex causes! And I don't see where being a provider includes anything about sex! Sex should never make a relationship, it should just be a part!|`|Wrn6WH7xaa	I think it would be best to seek professional help if you have already tried everything you can think of. I don't think leaving him is a good idea, but you deffinately deserve satisfaction. <br>  <br>  Maybe discuss fantasies and act them out? Also, look up online how to have your man last longer. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|cIJ960Wbaa	Sex can improve maybe you are just use to the last guy with the bigger penis and your body still strives for that. But there are plenty of things you could do to spice up and get yourself to the point were you are screaming for it. Try watching flicks together I know it sounds stupid but it works also have you ever read any zane novels the best one is addicted after I read it we were sexing like monkeys 2 to 3 times a day for about a mth or so and last but not least put a cap fool of vinegar in your bath water it will tighten you back up so you will feel him more.|`|di6p10Ifaa	Don't get rid of a great guy just because there is some mis communication in the bed. Buy some Kama Sutra books or something. See a sex therapist, have him read up and learn about how to control his orgasms. My fiance, i have no idea how he has done this, but he always holds back until I orgasm. Maybe two or three times in our 2 year sexual relationship has he gone before me. He usually has to slow down and just sit still for about 3 sec. It is like he has put some kind of restraint on himself until I get off...he absolutely will not until i have! lol, also try thrusting your hips against him so the clitoris is stimulated against his lower stomach, this works for me if I am having trouble getting there. Just hang in there!|`|AA11497994	well wat a situation u found urself in...u mentioned alot of things except toys and games,ever thought of that.give it a try after all u have nothing to lose|`|nbv6Z01iaa	b4 I married my husband the sex was wonderful, but now that is a different story.  I used to have multiple orgasms and now I am lucky to have one a month.  Your sex drive does go down after getting married and it isn't spontaneous anymore.  It is almost like you have to pull out your planner and schedule it.  <br>  <br>  If you really love him that much and want to marry him, I say go for it.  Just add toys and do things that turn you on before sex.  Have you tried more foreplay?  It sounds like you really want this man for the long haul.|`|2G8lOPN8aa	That's a real tough one, I'm afraid.  If you are questioning the relationship--then I think it is not the one for you... You should never settle, I think.  Sure, sex is only one part of a marriage and people can stay in a loving committed relationship even after the passionate and intensity dies down... but would you chose that up front?  I don't think so.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like you have tried to work this out with him and talk to him about your dissatisfaction, but that you have not found an acceptable solution.  FWIW--men ALWAYS orgasm...that's no big woof. And though people may tell you differently, I do believe that size does matter. <br>  <br>  The two of you are just not sexually compatible.  I don't think I would want to face the rest of my days knowing that if I were knowledgeable of that fact prior to marriage.<br>  <br>  Many marriages involve a large investment of time and money--but more than half of them fail anyway.  Why not quit while you are ahead if you are not satisfied?  Would you rather walk away from the relationship when you have 2 kids, have quit your job to stay home with them, and own a house and a timeshare and have two car payments together and 2 kids to put through college?  Your investment of time, money and emotion will only get larger going forward--making it harder to walk away if you are not completely happy.<br>  <br>  I'd rather hold out and have it all.|`|4HoVVCenaa	I would work for improvement. Get a checkup. Perhaps see a Sex Therapist. Have hubby you with more foreplay until you are almost there, and then.... Good love making is an art form and like all art forms, it requires feedback. (Dear Abby's column this week).|`|yQdA5rHnaa	sex can always improve, finding a person you're compatible with and love would be more difficult.  it depends on what is more important to you sex or a good relationship|`|4UUVrWXtaa	I think from what you've said he might be the one..<br>  But if you are best friends and plan to get married and you really love him..  you should be able to talk with him about it.. <br>  In a private real conversation.. don't tell him you don't feel anything though 'cause that would make him feel very bad.. Tell him what you like and how you like it.. And ask him what you can do to make the sex better too.. maybe you are not really into it either and you are not doing you job, so is hard for him to know what You want..<br>  If things are not really looking to chance and it really bothers you... don't marry him.. but remember!! sex can always get better.. and from my own words: "is how YOU ride the horse what matters"..|`|8IA3d3NNaa	Sex can change and get better over time, I have to agree that you shouldn't give up a man who loves you just because of sex, there is a lot more to a marriage then sex.|`|cfarZGPCaa	First and foremost, stop comparing him to your previous lovers. That is Always a mistake. When I first made love to my FH I was like.... is that it? I couldn't stop comparing him and his performance to my previous lovers and I spent almost the whole first month waiting for it to be over. Then we actually started doing what I wanted. Turns out I could bring in elements of what I had enjoyed about my previous escapades and mix them with our love. It def took awhile, probably yeah about 4-5 months but now when we have sex its about BOTH of us not just orgasming but enjoying each other.<br>  <br>  And I would suggest using condoms, not just great for safe sex, but they help him.. well last longer. Maybe condom rings or you can try having him masturbate several hours before hand and then try sex. When he's less focused on getting off, he's more focused on pleasing you.<br>  <br>  And to give you hope, mine wont stop until I have at least TWICE everytime. So hang in there ;)

But when he's spending so much time or money at a club that he can't take you out for a nice dinner or buy groceries, then it's time to have a talk.

Confront him, talk to him, and hold a steady conversation for about 3 minutes or more. Do this for about a week, make sure you think of things to talk about. Stop talking to him for one day and see if he attempts to talk to you. If he does like you as much as you like him, he will probably start up a conversation. If he avoids you, he is not the right guy for you.|`|4StO2m0iaa	ok its either yes he likes u and he's just acting out like some guys do when they like a girl and they don't know how to show it <br>  or either, no he doesn't really like u like that. <br>  be nice to him and if hes a jerk a little time will tell u nevr know! good luck gurl!|`|6f8eb1df236b453d41b94b11467cd780aa	he probably wants all your attention not 50% of it.

Maybe you need to show him that you like him in a way that you are comfortable with. Being a guy, i would know a simple sign from a girl.  hope this helps?|`|pcUAErpQaa	Well that guy is keeping quiet! My opinion is if you really like a guy try to befriend him start by saying a simple "Hello". No one will expect a thing. He might tell you.             <br>       Start by looking at simple things like does he always look at you.<br>  Well who knows if he doesn't like you yet you can and no, no love potions! Figure out his type.<br>           If he does like you dont take a risky step. ex turn goth or emo or whatever.  Just be who you are<br>   Love's risky.|`|uNvF299Caa	He likes you but probably not in the same way you like him.  It could be there you are too desperate and he notices that and doesn't like that.

Like you have a game, play very well, try to score the most and get the most points, work hard in this game. You will be praised by the people watching and by your teammates, and him.

Don't like, smother him, but just show him support. Sometimes it takes ages to get to you match so use that time wisely. Talk to him. Just ask him if he's ready, how he thinks he'll do, and from there tell him if you think you're really and how you think you will do. If that goes well, it should be easier to move into more personal subjects beacuse the ice would already be cracked.

First do not let her suspect you are thinking of leaving and to be extra sure try being even nicer (if there is arguing and tension).  Now I don't mean change over night, that is too obvious Just be gradual...you need time anyway.  Now as time goes on you need to start cashing out all the assets you have.  If you have been married over seven years and you are still young cash out you retirement...this is risky for you but this way she will not get any of it now or in the future.  Also start selling all stocks and any other bonds,CDs, or accounts with her name on it.  Basically you are going to just clean her out.  And if you want to be a real *** you can convince her to sell you r house now and move into a rental while you look for a new one.  This way you will have cash from the sell and you can then remove it from your joint account and hide it.  Thus not splitting the profit at all.  Now while you are moving out of the home you can take things and tell her you are just getting rid of them while really you rent a storage and put the stuff there until you move out.  After you have removed all assets and you in essence have "nothing" left,  (no one will be able to prove you have all the money, because you will be smart enough to hide it well) you will go in one day while she is at work and clean out the rental house and move into a new home you have just rented...making sure it is the same amount of note as hers.  <br>  If you have children leave them alone...let them see there mother and just get 50/50 jointcustody so you will not have to pay as much in child support...but really just destroy her financially and try not to **** up the kids...

26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	If you don't register, be prepared to get alot of stuff that you can't return anywhere if you don't like it. A registry doesn't have to be huge. Honeymoon and cash registries are considered rude by most. <br>  <br>  Bed Bath and Beyond is very reputable and popular (and it isn't going anywhere because it is successful). Some place like Target has bad customer service where it comes to registries so most people avoid that one.|`|4lL34wJnaa	Another idea is that in lieu of gifts, have your guests donate to your favorite charity!  That way you don't accumulate all that stuff you don't want/need and it gives back to a worthy cause!<br>  <br>  I set up a registry at idofoundation.org.  THey let you set up a honeymoon registry, as well as registries at partner stores (we chose Target and Amazon).  On top of that, each purchase made has a percentage donated to the charity of your choice.  It also has a section for your guests to donate to your charity of choice without purchasing gifts!  Remember, you could always ask for non-traditional gifts, like DVDs or books or camping equipment or a new digital camera!|`|AW1dCzH0aa	I agree that you should register or people will buy you things that you don't want/need.  While people may give you cash for your reception, they will not likely give you cash at your shower.  They are supposed to be "showering" you with gifts!  I would register for things that you could one day pass down to the next generation.  Here are some ideas:<br>  <br>  Wine glasses<br>  Vases<br>  Nice picture frames<br>  Candlesticks<br>  Centerpiece bowls<br>  Serving platters<br>  Serving pieces<br>  Salad servers<br>  Nice salt/pepper shakers<br>  Holiday serving pieces<br>  Holiday napkins, tablecloths, napkin rings<br>  Nice placemats<br>  <br>  If you go to a place like Macy's or Crate and Barrel - you can register for things as simple as 8.00/ea. placemats.  Then people can buy you a few pieces if they can't afford to buy one of the nicer/more expensive things on your registry.  Just remember - people will want to buy you "once in a lifetime" wedding gifts.  So you should register for a few things to avoid getting things you really do not want!  Good luck!|`|QP46eVi4aa	Well i do not like register cause some people feel they have to buy from that and just can not afford it and then end up not showing up <br>  <br>  i would put in the invites that if you would like a little money for our honey moon would be appreicated <br>  <br>  and i am sure it woud go nice also you could have a raffle at your shower buy one nice gift and charge a little for the tickets someone did it for our shower it was nice we charged i think it was like 5.00 for a ticket is what was charged and people loved buying them tickets we got like a few hundred dollars from it was kinda neat and everyone had fun <br>  <br>  but i think shower registers are for people who only want certain things

I wouldn't let my 13 year old brother hang around malls all day.|`|lhrMI9f5aa	I had that problem when I was your age too!!! What I did was I sat down and had a talk and got my older sis to back me up. I planned a perfect time, (when they are in a good mood) to talk to them and made a list of reasons why they should let me go alone or with friends, I also made a list of friends I have who do that and then turned it into a speech and learned how to say it in a way that didn't sound like I had been practicing it. What one them over was when my sister stepped in and said that she was allowed to go alone or with friends so why shouldn't I be :). <br>  <br>  xox<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!!<br>  <br>  Sienna <3|`|gfJcgbQ5aa	i know how u feel im 11 i live in wilmington nc nothing ever happens at my mall and she wont let me go with my friend in 5th grade and im in 5th grade she has an older sibling in 7th grade and she can take our backs but my mom doesnt trust me if ur mom is acting like that she doesnt trust you. or she thinks your not responsible enough to go. my mom never told i was non-responsible she just told me she didnt want me to get hurt. i convince her to let me go and i wont get hurt she just never lets me even walk down the street by myself i know how you feel i just keep on trying to gain responsiblty|`|BOfWh3YDaa	My mum is overprotective too, im 15 and she has finally trusted me to go with my friends, but i cant go to the city with my friends yet. i also think 12 1/2 is really young to go alone. but that's my opinion.|`|AOwZNtQuaa	Yeah I definitely think tht you R old enough. By it's really your moms decision. But if you wanna convince her just help out around the house more and try not to get I to fights with her and do well in school
BKr3y30maa	I think that there are some women out there that aren't willingly to commit and are satisified just being "sex buddies" with a man.  HOWEVER, I think that eventually that changes and they are seeking more than just a fling.  I personally have never had "sex buddies"....I don't think that it's a smart thing to do. I would want a relationship with someone that I would be giving myself sexually to.... but to each their own.|`|85V6cHe4aa	I think there are certainly women who at any age have stages in life that they are happy with just having a man there for sex but those stages normally pass.<br>  <br>  I am 31 and married so for me its a no go,i reached a point where i wanted a solid commited relationship and where love was important but i know single women my age who are happy to have casual sex,eventually they want more but it can work for a while.<br>  <br>  I personally feel that if i were single i could get sex alone if i wanted it but it wouldnt be something i would want to spend my life doing-besides that i adore my male friends and in the past have felt that friendships like that are easily rocked when sex comes into it.|`|ZvhtPCWQaa	it's become a very common thing over the past ten or so years. i'm sure it's been around for much longer, but people weren't as open about it in terms of discussion.<br>  <br>  not everyone is meant for a committed relationship (could be any reason), and so they choose a quick lay instead with a steady partner (not boyfriend/girlfriend, but someone who would sleep with them, and keep the chances of catching std's to a minimum).|`|S852p6SXaa	im the type of girl who wants to be in a relationship first then sex, girls like that are not looking for anything serious and still want to play the field. yeah but i kind of agree with you, i think older woman are looking for something alot more cause dating and trying to find that one person  can be a struggle and sometimes it takes alot of time.  people who are in their early 20 are most likely to to do the one night stand thing cause they just want to have fun and nothing  serious.|`|AA11324847	Funny, since I'm the kinda guy who wants a lifelong thing, and starting to feel like most women are only good for sex....I DEFINITELY think women "settle" for sex definitely. They feel like that's all they can get sadly, just because they can't see the alternatives for whatever reason...|`|0ktcvglRaa	Trust me, age has nothing to do with it. I know plenty of teenage girls who are like that, as well as plenty of older women who are like that.|`|AA11151503	If a woman is in love with a man and is his friend she will have sex with him but deep down she will want more of a trusting relationship type of friendship.  Then she will want to be the woman in his life.  The man just needs to be man enough to talk to her and be honest.  When a woman offers you her body it is truly her greatest gift,  it is herself and it is totally an unselfish act.  It touches her heart not just her body.|`|n09TKFj9aa	Not all women think that way. Even those that at one point were more inclined at having a sex buddy, will eventually want more than just sex. <br>  I agree with you though. After the age of 27, I too think that most women are ready to settle down. Mostly because we're all crazy and carefree when we're younger. After a while, we get tired and bored. We also understand better the difference between right and wrong. It's just a matter of growing up.|`|DsXyMuAiaa	I don't think its an age thing.  It depends on what's going on in your life at the time.  Like if you just got out of a long relationship & aren't looking to start another one right away.  This is a better option then going out & having 1 night stands.  As long as u realize this is a sexual relationship & possibly a friendship but it's not magically going to turn into more.|`|tnQOy5kdaa	It depends on the girl. Some times girls get their hearts crapped on and don't feel like dealing with a relationship but it's human nature to want to have sex. Sometimes they start out as sex-buddies hoping the guy will eventually want more.|`|xHh3Xnf6aa	It depends on the woman.  Not every woman is at the same place in their life at 27.  At that age, some want to settle down, some don't, and some end up settling for what they can get.  Like I said, it all depends.|`|Fue5b9wmaa	Well from my experience with a girl who had a sex buddy... I started dating her and found that out that she had a sex buddy before and it kinda broke my heart. I think it's stupid in general.. Sex should be about love.. but I don't know.. that's just me.|`|U2w775zZaa	Personally i hate being with a guy just for sex it isnt real and doesnt mean anything meaningful but sometimes a bit of fun is ok.|`|PATpTF9saa	are you asking me to be your sex buddy? because the answer's yes|`|bac56376717ea35d80831d3370c0f54baa	Some do, but I think most women want to be in a relationship, I hope so any way,
KSK22vHUaa	If a pill will fix it, take a pill.  It isn't a crutch if you're depressed.  It's a helping hand to get you back to the point where you can take care of yourself.<br>  <br>  Don't stay with someone for money.  Find yourself a room mate, get rid of the car and start paying off the debt and leave him if you want to leave him.  It isn't your responsibility alone to go get counseling and anti-depressants to save a marriage, though.  He should do what he can as well, like joining you to marriage counseling and compromising with you where you need help, like doing more chores or helping more financially.<br>  <br>  School is very important.  Try to stick with it.  If you need to leave, file for bankruptcy or get the debt divided between you.  But don't stay if you're unhappy.  Wait for the semester end when you'll be less stressed by school, and pack up, and find someone in the paper who's got a room for rent.|`|3678a63c227fb95efdb295c02f4aa475aa	You just have to decide what you need, and once a decision is made, follow through.  You don't have kids, so that is going to be a bit of an easier split, as you can sever all ties.  I wish I could do so with my ex, but we have 3 kids.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I digress.  Get a bus ticket back home, re-invent yourself, and don't get into a relationship until you have sorted yourself out.<br>  <br>  I didn't date for almost 4 years following my divorce...now I have an amazing man in my life. I took time out to discover who I am, and it made such a difference.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ibaLRXY2aa	Is it possible to move back with your family and switch colleges? Without kids, the government's not going to give a **** about you and help you out. (Found this out the hard way when I was down on my luck.) Or maybe you could start working full time and going to school part time.<br>  <br>  Also, don't be so quick to dismiss antidepressants. Depression is a biologically based illness, just like diabetes or heart disease. It is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. It's not a sign of weakness. Drugs may help you get through this rough patch. You may even see things differently once your mind is cleared. They changed my life for the better.|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	when you're an emotional rollarcoaster, especially if you know it, is not the time to contemplate divorce. <br>  <br>  you need an outlet. you have a lot on your plate. <br>  give the counseling a chance. you will either work things out together or choose to end your marriage.<br>  <br>  i hope your marriage works out, and your burnout is a short thing. there are many people who talk about spouses who cheat, beat and steal or lie to them. yours is mainly stress.<br>  <br>  best wishes...|`|CMo0Fh1Zaa	you are under some major stress there.  You said you were going to school and working a job at the same time.  That alone is depressing.   I think you should stick with your husband.  It's really not going to any different if you divorce him.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	You are under a great deal of pressure right now, with school and work and financial difficulties. I would keep the counseling appointment. Now is not the time to make life changing decisions. If you doctor suggests medication, give it a try. I believe they help many people.. What you want is to run away, I really understand that feeling, but none of us can do that. You may leave your marriage, but that isn't going to solve all your problems. Try to get healthy and not an "emotional roller coaster" first, get through school, give it time and go to counseling. Then, make your decision. Hang in there and good luck.
7d3edabfdc27c4ba2c6cd571f70d965daa	Really, there's nothing you can do about it.  Try to be happy for your dad and stepmom.  Once you see your little brother or sister, you'll probably feel different.<br>  <br>  I certainly wasn't thrilled with my mom and step-dad having a baby when I was a teenager, but I realized over time my mom wasn't replacing me, and you will too.<br>  <br>  Also, it's like, a man's natural reaction to want a boy.  Men generally are worried about how to deal with daughters at first.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	Time to get over it.  You can't change it, so there's nothing to do.|`|7e8950aee924cd077d83c3a855698a57aa	maybe you should try to talk to your dad. tell him how much he means to you and try to get involved with how excited they are about the new baby. everything in life helps us grow within ourselves, try to grow from the situation and look on the bright side. be open with your family.
rlUUaSgqaa	Both parents need to give their consent, and most of the counties in Georgia won't let 16 year olds get married even with parental consent.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Honey, you see your parents are divorced right? You must know already that marriage is very hard and you are very young. Why do you want to get married? Look at the economy? They are saying kids graduating from college are going to have a tough time finding employment, what are you going to do? Please................don't do it! Wait, wait, wait.|`|o5jSID4Jaa	I think you need both parents' consent. What's the rush to get married?? You are so young. Don't get into such a rush to grow up! You have plenty of time to get married. If you are really meant to marry this person then it won't matter if you wait a bit longer until you're at least of age to not need parental consent. Good luck.
kkTjyeKNaa	I do that too. YOu have a stalker on your hands.......maybe go to the police if it get's to extreme.|`|up92xwOWaa	My girlfriend says, unplug your phone or turn your cell phone off until the a.m. or whenever you wake up.<br>  <br>  <br>  lol, i don't know how this will help you, but i don't argue with my girlfriend, so. It's all on you bud.|`|wp7vdcLCaa	Yea... it means she is a bit obsessed...

How old are the two of you? I can't imagine her doing this because she likes you. She must no that it isnt a real turn on for you, instead kinda annoying, unless she is really young..<br>  <br>  Its hard to say why she would be doing it without knowing more about who she is to you...|`|yULnOJUwaa	Maybe she just wants to know if you are home but doesn't want you to know she is checking.  I don't think it necessarily means she is a stalker.  She may just be thinking of you and wants to hear your voice.|`|ajXfV65jaa	Girls don't do that. Don't ask why they do it. She is being a sketch ball, to hell with that girl. Find some new *ss|`|o5jSID4Jaa	She needs to grow up or quit being a stalker.

You will feel that it is impossible right now. You have to find a hobby, avoid places and things that reminds you so much of him. Spend more time with friends. Live one day at a time. In time, you will feel the pain lessens and sometimes it comes back and you will cry again. But you move on again, in time the interval will lessen and you will be ok.

You can video tape them in the process. Take photos on the digital camera and make a book with a story. Take photos of nature and let them fill in captions, Have them make up a new board game. There are many science fun projects to do, like make moon mud and paper mache figures.|`|Dv4NHEYbaa	Nothing, everything costs money
Ybo6HS8Caa	I just answered this same question in the parenting section.....|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Stick to your college. When your Mom says these things to you, you need to hear it as noise. It is only that, just noise. She is trying to wind you up and of course she is being cruel. She might think it's funny, but we don't hear you laughing!<br>  <br>  What are your chances of getting room and board somewhere until you can get through college?<br>  <br>  My question is: Who is she really angry with? Does she seem to have an issue with men?|`|wzqahEqiaa	Wow, I'm sorry your mom is hurting you.  Distance yourself from your mom if she doesn't respect you.  You don't need to disappear from anything.  Try doing some volunteer work and it will boost your self esteem.  Thank you for serving our country and you are a wonderful person!  I don't know if you're a religious person but try watching EWTN.  There are many good programs about family.  Good Luck!|`|5c40baa93c7ba8164e45f151f1878025aa	I say things to my kids but they know I am just kidding around.  How old are you? Do you live at home? Can you move out?  If not, then you will just have to let it roll off your back.  Ignore her.  Some people are just like that in that they have lousy senses of humor.  Take care and good luck.  Thanks for your service.|`|IcH5gMICaa	so the answer to all your problems is to just leave.  just because your mom pokes fun at you??  ok, my mom is a LOT meaner than that.  A LOT meaner.  Calling me gay wouldn't even cross her radar, instead she'd rather point out my REAL flaws -bi-polar, alcoholic, depressive, former pot head, whatever she can think of.  but instead of it driving me back to drinking (literally) -I just tell her like it is:  "You got pushed around too much by your brothers and you have had a lot of bad things happen to you and it makes you lash out on the people you WANT to love but can't because you're too afraid of getting hurt again."  <br>  <br>  There is some reason your mom does this.  It could be attention she's craving -tell her she's going about it the wrong way.  Or if she calls you gay say, "hey, I understand you've been thinking about it and you don't need my approval.  just go out and get that woman you've obviously been wanting.  but try not to dress so butch" lol see if that changes her tune.  <br>  <br>  If you leave, she wins.  That's what people like her want.  If you don't leave, she has to continue finding more ways to get a rise out of you, and it's obvious that's what she finds joy in.  So just turn it back on her.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	if someone repeatedly hurts my feelings or makes me mad,i kick them out of my life and i dont care what relationship or relative it is. if you live with her then you should move out, if you dont live with her,then just dont answer to her.<br>  <br>  my sister in law started making fun of me for gaining weight during my pregnancy,calling me disgusting for this and that body part,so i quit talking to her,if i accidently answered to her,i would say i was busy and i would call her back later,but i never did.|`|c6cd54d9f59d521fd8b4ad2103988fe3aa	In rebuttal to her razzing you, you just throw everything away and run away??<br>  You can tell her to stop or you wont come around><br>  You could ask her if the reason she says that is because she is trying to cover up something in her life?<br>  Or maybe you have given reason to say that? Like NOT stepping up to the plate and defending yourself?|`|UAd5x6Awaa	I don't think you should go to those extremes. However, I can see your point. If you are living with her, then maybe you should consider moving out. Since you feel that her calling you gay is derogatory, then thoroughly let that be known to her. And if she can't refrain from saying that to you then as hard as it may be, you will have to limit your time around her. Best of wishes!|`|XrtmT2kUaa	Look, it seems to me that you are old enough to get over it. Not everyone is a great parent. I think we should have parenting class like, we have driving classes or college courses. Try to over look her. She will regret it in the future but, for now you be the better/bigger person.|`|LRJmHA7vaa	NO, no, no,who gives a crap what your Mother says. She sounds sort immature. To thine own self be true....|`|yULnOJUwaa	I'm so sorry.  You say you've talked to your mother but have you asked her WHY she says that.  It doesn't really make sense to me.  Don't drop out of college and put your future in jeopardy.  First try talking to her one more time and try to find out why she is doing this.  Do you date - is she voicing one of her deep concerns because of not seeing you with a girl?  If you cannot reach any kind of resolution with her, then try to put a little distance between the two of you to show her how unacceptable her accusations are.  If you live at home, move out on your own (if you can afford to).
JhvqUvlsaa	Go up to her and try to strike up a conversation; if she bites great if not then just let it go and let her think about it for a while. Then if she approaches you then talk. And if you guys keep talking, then invite her to come over and hang out. Tell her you're sorry and hope the two of you can reconcile.<br>  <br>  If she never comes up to you or doesn't let you start talking when you go up to her then ignore her stares; she's not ready yet to get back together.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|Likst1Mxaa	don't make a big fuss/speech about becoming friends again. sometimes friendships can just be repaired by talking about the normal things in life. Just start by saying 'hey, how you doing?' and go from there|`|TT5EvqCgaa	Walk up to her and say hey, wanna hang out or something. Then if she makes an excuse then atleast you were the bigger person,right. If she wants to hang out then hang out and talk about what you all can do instead of ignoring each other when you have your next fall out.|`|fqVxw8HMaa	maybe send her a txt first or say hi on face book.|`|2owUaw1paa	Give me a thumbs down if this is a stupid question
GQUaFGHLaa	If your ex has lied to you already then he could still be lying again. You can try to find out if what he has told you is the truth. If he has friends then ask his friends if his dad is really dying of cancer. Let them know that is what you have heard.|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	my goodness its a bind, especially if you care about his family. <br>  <br>  i would contact a family member who knows of his addiction, explain to them my concern and just ask if its true because if so, you want to extend your condolescences. if its true you have shared your concern. if not, it is not you but him who will look bad.<br>  <br>  i wouldnt drop a penny without some sort of truth being revealed. drug addicts will do and say ANYTHING for funds to get high. And i do mean ANYTHING. they are not thinking rationally but being driven and desperate for the drugs.|`|wp7vdcLCaa	...I think calling them and telling them how sorry for what is happening to them and see what they say is a good idea... but In my honest opinion... Don't bother yourself with worrying about him... You broke up with him for a reason. Just be happy. Don't let this waste your energy you could be using to improve your happiness.|`|djUMvICoaa	So what if there really isn't any sickness and your cards show up what are they going to think then.  You have no obligation to his family any more nor to him.  Stay away, he still sounds like bad news.|`|ajXfV65jaa	Tell him you care, but he really needs to get his act together, you want nothing to do with his drug issues.|`|ITx2jZGkaa	no its not a good idea, you left him for a reason

I know im pretty just the way i am and i dont need to me 6 feet tall to be hot. accept your self. maybe you dont get as many guys because you arent juggling your boobs around their faces but atleast when you do get a guy, he'll respect you and love u for (not only whats outside) but whats inside too... and he wont be looking at your breasts all the time. =) <br>  <br>  third... my bff is like 5' 8'' too, and im even shorter than u! im 4'8''!!! i know im super short but i like it that way... and when the guys come to flirt with your friend talk to them too... then they'll see how pretty u really r!|`|NrCh5mqyaa	uhm whoa.<br>  first of all, you just said she always wears sweatshirts and sweatpants to the mall<br>  then @ the bottom you were like, she shows cleavage and wears mini micro skirts.<br>  ?<br>  yeah idk what to tell you, except if she tells you you're ugly, then she's probably not a very good friend.|`|cN1uw7dNaa	in my experience, guys prefer slutty over classy and you sound like the classier one. girls probably think you're more attractive. also, it'll be different once you get to college. perceptions change on what is attractive. dont let it get to you =]|`|du5MNrQ6aa	blah blah blah stop fishing for compliments.|`|TT5EvqCgaa	Man, if she is your friend and she is calling you ugly, you don't need enemies. Who cares if they all look at her. Its because she is comfortable with herself and your not. Be aware of your own beauties and not just hers. Strut your stuff girl and maybe you are wearing too much makeup at the mall...be yourself. the way you talk about her like she is easy and stuff, you both need to get new friends. I would hate fro my friend to think that about me. Thanks for reminding me why i used to hang with the guys in school. Girls are evil. I dont just say that to you either, I tell my boys that all the time. They think that the girls they go o school with are crazy when they cant be them selves and they are teenagers. My bys would prefer the sweat pants and baggy shirt and no make up. they like the real girls. Ones that can play basketball and football with them with out being scared of the dirt. Think about it.

Easy as that.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, be respectful of their rules, they are obviously taking care of you financially still even though you are engaged.<br>  <br>  I think its okay that youve been sexual with him (im not aganist pre marital sex) but, again, you are living under your parents roof and you should respect their rules or work out with them some rules that can be bended so it still respects them and honors what you want as well!!|`|AA11829392	You still need to respect your parents if you live with them.  Sure you have had sex with him and they don't approve.

Why not wait? Nobody can tell you what to do. You are 18 and you already been doing what you want to do. If you feel that you cant change your parents mind then the rest is up to you. No body is perfect we all have done things...good luck|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	Just appease your parents until you are married by letting them think you are pure. If you spend the night with him it will ruin that for them.|`|ePFZ5tHqaa	No I do not agree with your parents your 18 and your an adult old enough to make your own choices because it's not there choice if you can spend time/have sex/make out with your fiance IT'S YOURS!|`|QRBi7feQaa	no offense but if u live there house its there rules if u break them they may kick u out so becareful|`|fpS90nx4aa	well since your 18 i dont think its up to ur parents to decide for you because your an adult|`|SBTbYr7baa	Your 18 do whatever you want they can't stop you|`|ACbmLR8faa	Go to school, trust me, your life will be a living hell if you get married, I've been through it|`|CSyBGcLYaa	just wait till you  get married|`|isCMHiYeaa	if you're 18 how can they stop you?
WHK4omegaa	that doesn't make any sense. maybe you should ask him more questions about why he is court ordered to pay child support in the first place if he has custody. does he have legal custody ? and, if it's anything like what i'm going through right now, maybe the child used to live with the mother and he owes back child support from before the child came to lived with him. if that's the case, he'll have to pay that.<br>  if they go for modification, and the mother is reasonable, they could probably work it out in mediation.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	This could occur here in Tennessee, but is extremely rare.  In order for it to occur, the father's parenting time would have to be either a 50/50 split or the father could potentially have 55/45 and in either instance, the father's income is higher than the mother's income.<br>  <br>  Very, very rare.  It could not occur if the mother had every other weekend visitation.<br>  <br>  It's just the way it is when two people make a baby--that baby has to be supported.  Now, as to why your guy cannot pay, if it was based on his income, perhaps his income has changed?  The remedy is a modification and yes, although it may take a few months to get into court, the filing date is the date used for mod purposes, so he needs to get the thing filed right away.  But you're being melodramatic--the same court taking that long on a mod is going to take that long on a contempt.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	So get the modification....what's the problem?|`|0KLu4hRaaa	As a mom I will say if they are having financial difficulties that make it impossible for them to pay then I think the case should be brought to the judge for modification (even if it is only a temporary modification). I think the mom should be understanding if it is a legit financial strain.<br>  <br>  If the father refuses to pay (meaning he can but won't) then yes the dad should be forced to pay or go to jail.|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Child support should go to the custodial parent. Why would any court order child support to the non-custodial parent? How screwed up are your state laws? After all, child  support money is to pay for the child's support, not the parent.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan|`|ed9c52fcc32bc21499c8007eec999f5faa	If he has custody, why was he ordered to pay child support to Mom?  If you're talking about joint custody, that's a different matter and *if* that's the case, you need to clarify it.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	if its ordered by law he has to he can go to court and get amodification if there is problems. its not uncommon and it can be set back if there is problems like losing job etc.|`|UUrqECXIaa	By "custodial" you are referring to the father having shared custody but not shared placement correct? If that is the case, yes I think they should be treated the same as a father who does not share custody but is still ordered to pay support. Go to court to get it reduced.<br>  <br>  If you are saying that the child lives with the father but he is still ordered to pay "child" support that is really messed up. The mother should be paying him. Alimony would be a separate issue.|`|riOQ4Jveaa	Child Support should be paid to the custodial parent, it shouldn't make a difference if it is the mother or the father. It is money for the kids no for the custodial parent

Are there some quirks you'd be willing to put up with if you befriended one of them? It may take some soul searching and you may not find a close friend during this school year but at least you'll have some knowledge for when summer comes and the following school year.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

A lot of younger people do not want to spend time with there parents.|`|vg2xABZjaa	I don't know if you will like this anser but as long as you can spend time with her go ahead and be the one that makes the plans all the time. It is her personality not to do that. Its not that she doesnt love you, it is just the way she is. People can change for a short time but they always revert back. Accept it and just play the part of the planner and do not stop scheduling things for you two to do.|`|uNvF299Caa	It's okay if she is like that.  Does she seem happy while you are hanging out? Or is she still cold? Well, anyway, not everyone is perfect.  It's great that you love spending time with your parents, you won't regret.  At least she says yes when you ask her to hang out, right? So, don't worry about it.  I don't think it's that important.  Just keep reminding her then, if it bothers you.  Maybe remind her every two weeks.  Hopefully she'll change a little.
Wy0lUjP9aa	Well you not talking to him probably made him think he did something wrong. A bad move I should say. No worries, when you see him on Mon, smile at him or even say "hi" let him know you never lost interest. Maybe you just weren't happy that day. If he asks, just tell him you were nervous. He will understand, and he may comfort you.|`|0ktcvglRaa	Perhaps he didn't reply because he thought you didn't like him since you didn't talk to him in person.

And don' text him and ask if he's mad, just ask him what's up, and do it face to face. then based on his reaction, if it's an in-depth and revealing answer, then tell him you like him.|`|2nc9k9BSaa	If he asks for your number, he CLEARLY likes you. Since he didn't respond, it's simply possible that he didn't have his phone on him or was unable to reply.<br>  <br>  Wait 'til you see him at school, or call him.

You may develop new habits in a 'crisis mode', but be mindful not to carry them forward when the crisis is over.  If each of you puts in enough work to accomplish 60% of what needs to get done in the household, then you'll be able to carve out a little sleep or breathing-room time.<br>  <br>  A death so close to the heart can be a serious blow, so there is nothing at all unusual or incorrect about suffering three weeks after the fact.  Try to notice that next week will be better than this week, and visualize normalcy, knowing that your father is gone for good.  (Sorry if this is too tough-lovey.)|`|9KOuOEy9aa	You are both under a lot of stress right now, it is completely understandable.  Just take time for yourself every once in a while.  Put a sign on the bathroom door take a bubble bath with some good music and tell everyone unless there is blood, puke or the house is on fire you don;t want to be disturbed.<br>  <br>  You and your husband should also start a date night so you are spending some stress free quality time with one another.|`|q84KT11saa	Sounds to me like you both really need to sit down and have a talk.  Open up some communication and dialog.  It could be as simple as you expressing your feelings, him expressing his, and you realize that your issues with one another or your situation really are not as bad as you thought they were.  If sitting down and talking together is not an option, I suggest you talk to a councilor of sorts.  Also, try finding some time to yourself.  Even if its taking a long shower/bath in peace.|`|mABE76Dhaa	I see youve earned 433 points this week. erhaps a little less time on the computer will help.

Maybe he will step in and take some of the chores off your shoulders.  Good Luck.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	I would say its normal that things are worse right now. You just lost your father and you sound overwhelmed. I can relate! Could you try to sit down and possibly talk to him about your feelings? Or, maybe you could go to counseling yourself for a little while, just for you. Since these are his grandchildren, maybe you need to set some boundaries about what is your responsibility and what is his. That is alot, it sounds like you are raising someone else's children.I am sorry about your father.|`|djUMvICoaa	Yeah, you need a break, you are going through a trying time and  need some time to do some greiving.  without that you are going to continue to have trouble with little things because it is all piling up on you now.  I hope he understands and gets you out of the house for an afternoon.  I'm sorry about your dad.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	You both need to sit down and have a talk and stop all the arguing. Arguing all the time never solves anything. It can sometimes make things worse.

You don't have to give him an exact time, and you don't even have to sell it if you don't want to. <br>  <br>  You need to take some time out for you. Do not feel guilty telling your husband that.

There is so much to do to get that house ready for sale.  Getting rid of all furniture, clothes, and miscellaneous things.  This all takes time.  Yes, the money would be great but emotionally right now you are having a rough time dealing with it.<br>  <br>  Is your husband willing to help you with all that needs to be done?  And the market is slow right now and will take you a long time once you have ready for sale.   I think he needs to be there for you and help with all that needs to be done.  But you need some time before diving into all this.    Just ask him to slow down some.  Talk with him and ask why he is in such a hurry.    Communication is necessary.|`|O8JUyZL9aa	Your dad just passed, you're obviously not ready for a big decisions...you need time to grief.

U5dCFomCaa	ok, yes i do think he likes you. his friends called him over to leave with them, but he made an excuse not to go. "it's cold outside". uhhh, okay great. not so good excuse. so if he's choosing you over his friends, that's a pretty good sign. and he probably went with that person because he doesn't want to be too clingy. hopefully you guys get to spend more time with each other again(=<br>  <br>  if you're not busy..

He'll say yes
kN0Qr52Jaa	It is never wrong to want a break from anyone, including your parents. When you're around someone for a long time, you actually need a break. It's not like you're planning to leave forever. You're just asking for up to 1 week with another family member to clear your head. So don't feel guilty. Don't feel selfish. It's far from wrong. It's completely natural. So  take that break and believe me, things should most likely turn out better than they were. (I don't guarantee it because some parents hold grudges, but from my experience when I got away from my mom I came back and we both felt refreshed.) I wish you the best of luck!!!|`|o6IiYw6baa	o its not wrong or selfish u need me time it sounds like ur parents need it too so have fun at a spa or shoppin|`|uNvF299Caa	It's not wrong to feel that way.  But you shouldn't do it.  Just talk to them, let them know what's in your mind.  Be their friend, let them in your life - it's not that bad.  You'll need them so much throughout your life.  Don't take them for granted.  Even if they don't let you do some stuff, don't worry about it. Because soon, you'll be going off to college and making your own decisions and you're gonna wish you were still living with them.  Tell them that you would just like to do things, and remember these things when you get older. You want to live life, because you only live it once, you're only 15 once, you're only 16 once.  Maybe what they need from you is trust.  They need to trust that you are not going to get in trouble or do stupid things.  So, talk to them. It's hard to see now, but they actually know what's best for you most of the time. And they probably say that you'll only understand when you have kids of your own.  It took me a while to finally see that.  I'm 25 now and I have a one year old son.  I know he is little, but he gets mad when I don't let him eat things from the floor, I tell him I'm sorry, but I know what's best for you. (it's not exactly the same, but I you get the picture).|`|dc04cc16355f7402c67d1515087137a0aa	No it is not wrong.<br>  I am a teen and feel like that probably 50% of the time.<br>  I have 3 brothers too so that makes it all very stressful.<br>  <br>  It's kind of selfish for you getting close to making plans to leave for a bit. Like you can't handle it yourself and you just give up.<br>  Teenagers do that a lot. They don't know how to handle a problem so they just leave it.<br>  Try to get closer with your parents..no matter how weird that may sound.<br>  Watch TV together..go to the grocery store with them or even something as small complimenting them when they look nice when they are going out to eat or to work or something.<br>  Find ways to relate to them and spend a little more time and soon enough you will feel more connect to them.<br>  <br>  Insted of spending a week trying to get things straight, just think about it over night. You could write out all the things you guys struggle with, then make solutions for some of them and casually mention others like, "Mom how come whenever I ask if I can go to friends you always say no?"<br>  <br>  Sorry that was all a bit jumbled and confusing...but I hope I helped.<br>  I can relate and I know many others can too.|`|jf1o7TFHaa	of course you're young and a teenager, we ALL get annoyed with parents and don't get along. its in our nature. maybe stay a few nights at a friends house to cool off.
5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	Babysitting drunk people is never fun. If she continually does this, then I would just stop going out with her. Maybe when she's sober sit her down and really talk to her. Make sure she understands. And if she drinks more often than not, maybe you need to look into an AA meeting?<br>  I would be mad at her for ruining all your nights that are supposed to be fun. I wish there was a way to limit her drinking, but, if she's already pre-gaming at her house, there really isn't anything you can do. At least not anything you can do that doesn't involve being her babysitter.<br>  Good luck! I'm sorry your friend is so inconsiderate.|`|bmu6uhQ3aa	No, you have a right to be angry.

7sA8HwTzaa	You cannot change your sister, so stop trying.  She's going through some things that you may find yourself doing in the next few years, too.  Try to remember how you view it if it happens.<br>  <br>  For now, go to your parents and tell them how you feel.  You can tell them specific things if you want, but you don't have to.  Your parents aren't as stupid as your sister makes them out to be, so don't be too surprised if they tell you that they already know.  Tell them that you'd like to help and ask them if there is anything you can do.  Just being a good daughter for now may be enough, but if you see her doing things that you're genuinely concerned about, please tell them.|`|aA5rlNUTaa	tHERE IS REALLY NOTHING YOU CAN DO.

e7KoyoWsaa	Sean, the short answer is no.  But, it's not for the reason you think.<br>  <br>  I know your 14, I've had a lot more experience with this sort of stuff than you, so I'm about to give you gold.  GOLD buddy, and it's 'cause I really relate to you - I was you at 14.<br>  <br>  A girl doesn't decide if a boy has a chance.  She doesn't decide weather he's good enough or not.  She doesn't decide if he's got any chance at all.  He does.  You don't have a chance because YOU have already decided that your not good enough for her.  So, what do you think she will think?  Honestly, will she read your small talk banter and suddenly be swapping spit with you?<br>  <br>  You have to get it in your head, you are good enough.  In fact, she might not be good enough for you.  I mean, your good looking, smart, can see through people.  What's she got?  Popularity.  Boy attention.. that's nothing in the long run.  So, know that not only are you good enough, she might not be.<br>  <br>  Now, what do you think is going to happen when she realizes she might not be good enough for you?  She'll know, trust me, if that's how you feel.  You become a challenge.<br>  .. a "yea, see, I AM good enough for you."<br>  <br>  I dunno what other people wrote in the question, but it's likely some will be positive and some super negative.  I suggest you ignore every one of them.  You don't need the public to tell you if your good enough or not.<br>  <br>  This won't work all the time, but it works.  If it doesn't work with her, well, there are others.  Don't ever feel rejected, and don't ever be the victim.  Also, learn to flirt..  It's not easy at first, but it is a safe way of saying "hey i like you" without being direct about it.<br>  <br>  I'd be curious to know how you'd do. message me if i've helped|`|wqhvfFtgaa	ur cute.<br>  <br>  she's pretty.<br>  <br>  =)<br>  <br>  what's the problem?<br>  go for it!<br>  <br>  Good luck! =]|`|VDSHt23Aaa	ya just dont mess up<br>  answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhawDCBv5CQvWOYhqG0_YKvsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307143640AAjS7al">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|0ktcvglRaa	It's a Hannah Montana/Jonas Brothers match made in heaven.|`|dJrJYLBFaa	you better hope she doesnt use yahoo answers and see this question and that you saved her pictures. hahaha|`|ePFZ5tHqaa	You never know she may simply like you for your personality, you don't have to look great because personality matters the most, for example she may look pretty but could be a real jerk (not saying she is its just an example).|`|mTqkcTtWaa	shes ugly and u look a little nerdy sorry, but ur hair is great lol, , just tlk to her and umm i dnt think she knows ur posting pics of her so dont post pics of other people without their permission thts ilegal so dont do it ever think maybe she doesnt want random people seeing her.....despicable....pathetic losseerrrr hahahaha sorry but its truu.|`|pnxEgqQuaa	She's ugly. ewwww....<br>  and you look kind of weedy and geeky.|`|riO929X4aa	I'm not sure do what you think you should.|`|kQFp0xYcaa	CAMEL TOE!|`|YgB6SgrOaa	i think you do so far i dont see a reason why you wouldn't|`|dIxOyTcLaa	U arnt really asking a question but if u want to ask her out just go for it|`|ACbmLR8faa	Ask her out( ALONE) but don't come on too strong|`|ptIOvGSaaa	neither of you are good  looking......|`|6tLcc85Xaa	yea why do you think shes pretty???

If you like her, just be her friend. Take the opportunity that you'll be doing a project together, it doesn't have to get awkward. Just be yourself.

UBdt4Wm0aa	Oh dear...I'm so sorry you are going through this. <br>  <br>  He's trying to make you think you're nuts for questioning him about that email...by saying it's over your head and such. Give me a break. He's just angry that he got caught. <br>  <br>  There is a way out! Call 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) and they will point you in the right direction. <br>  <br>  Personally, I woudn't leave. He already has. I'd have all the locks changed and I'd get a restraining order immediately by calling the police and letting them know that he is abusive. Mental abuse is no better than physical. Sounds like he's had quite a bit of control in the relationship and you're better off without him. <br>  <br>  He has A LOT of growing up to do. Good thing you are finding out things now instead of 20 years down the road! He's not worth begging. You shouldn't have to beg for his love! If he can't give it to you freely, he's not worthy of you and that seems to be the case here. <br>  <br>  Don't let your son be raised in a home with a dad who doesn't truly love his mom (even though she's a great person and deserving of love). That won't show your son a good example of how men should treat women. <br>  <br>  Don't be afraid that you won't be able to survive without him. You WILL be able to make it. There are SO MANY resources out there for women in your situation. I know it's scary, but you can do this. Don't give up your self respect because you don't feel like you can do it without someone who clearly doesn't know how to treat a woman.|`|aWgdX0pZaa	Well, "THE ONE" if she wouldn't have done that she would've never found out about this jerk talking to another girl. Don't listen to him and do yourself a favor LEAVE HIM! he doesn't deserve you not even his son. I mean you tried to fix things but he couldn't put it more clear that he doesn't want you so.... DIVORCE HIM please, not only for you but for your son, he needs to grow up in a loving home.<br>  <br>  AND when you hear people tell you that you shouldn't SNOOP don't listen to that either b/c people like them end up being cheated on. If your partner doesn't want you to check up on him then he's up to something, there should be no secrets in a marriage and NO is nothing to do with insecurity. If it wasn't b/c you checked his e-mail you would've never found out and he would've being talking,sleeping, seeing, etc her and who knows how many more women|`|jdcexBKfaa	i think the best thing is divorce, if u think u love him u dont, u think u do but u rlly dont. look at how he treats u and all the horrible things he did, that is not a good start, a man like this is extremely hard to change and looks like it wont happen ne time soon. Another thing is if u run after him and stuff that gives him more power and he will kno ur weakness and take advantage of him, stay strong and act like it doesnt bother u when it rlly does, dont let it show and do ne thing u can to get u and ur son out. your son will be with u, they give the son to the mother ALWAYS, unless shes a drug addict or sumthing. good luck adn i hope u help ur self and ur son|`|wJ0iLG0raa	he does want a divorce.give it to him.<br>  <br>  he's giving u hell for his actions.<br>  <br>  he shouldnt have gotten involved with u when emotionally he wasnt 'in the right place'<br>  <br>  sorry but sounds like u were a rebound.<br>  <br>  the man for u hasnt come ur way yet, but if u let it be, he will.<br>  <br>  get out for you&your baby's sake.|`|geg7rsIHaa	Damn!<br>  <br>  <br>  Get. a. divorce.  Then move on.  And, in moving on, don't do that snooping around crap anymore.  Respect privacy.|`|TZ815QKDaa	Wow you could fight more gracefully if you drove lol-you should get your license!|`|VsCLZdFkaa	The key phrase is "I don't feel anyone should have to be near that negativity".  <br>  <br>  The more you try to fix something out of your control, the worse you feel...the worse you feel, the more you try, the more you try the more you fail, the more you fail the worse you feel, the worse you feel, the more try, the more you try, the more you fail....it's cycle...a negative, destructive cycle for you and will have an impact on everyone.<br>  <br>  You've tried.  Remove your son from this negativity and cycle of self destruction.... without anger and hostility. Your self worth, as well as your son's self worth will flourish.  I know, I've been there.|`|njgF24Tbaa	Well, you could always file for divorce on your own even if he doesn't want one and take half of the equity of the house and half of his earnings at work and retirement.  <br>  <br>  But you asked him for marriage counseling and that's probably better to stay in the marriage. He seems like an asshole though. Usually I have no problem when somebody is financially destroyed in divorce if the husband cheated or beat the wife, but this situation seems like murky ground however. <br>  <br>  Install a key-logger which records his keystrokes, and find out more about this ex-fiance. She really should be out of the picture and looking for a new man, what is her problem.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	1) I would not have snooped<br>  2) Since you did snoop I would of asked him about it too<br>  3) When he stormed out I would not have chased after him<br>  4) When he said the context was beyond me I would have said "Let me be the judge of that."<br>  5) If he came back it would be to find his belongings at the curb and the locks on the house changed.<br>  6) I would of dumped him on his rear when he wanted me to have an abortion<br>  7) When you move on with your life and find someone new make sure they really want you and that they are not emotionally abusive<br>  8) If you want a divorce then get one -- it is your life and you have to call the shots and you will more than likely have to be the one to explain to your son that "Momma and Daddy just could not get along anymore." Don't expect him (your husband) to step up to bat on that one.
3y0w1qIBaa	The first thing you may want to watch very closely on them.  It really depends on how many years that you guys have been off.  If it is been a while, then, there is a chance that they matured and respect you as a human being.  I am not sure if you can trust them or not, but trust your instincts is all I can tell you.
gfmTgLDKaa	Yes, Taken is a good movie! It's very action packed and it has kids involved and everything. <br>  <br>  I love that movie, I hope you guys have a good time, Enjoy! :D|`|0lnamekJaa	Both... But as an "Uber Fan"... I've not heard much good about Push...|`|am3TZ7p9aa	taken is PERFECT WATCH THAT ONE.|`|9nqVABVtaa	taken would be perfect!!!<br>  i did the same thing with my dad and it went great. perfect father daughter movie... depending how old you are. im sixteen, sooo|`|hvBeLr6Oaa	taken!|`|BW3Ga4Mtaa	Push was stupid and i hated it and the friend that I saw it with fell asleep.|`|X4X7bv97aa	PUSh|`|E6tkzPsbaa	In the movie Taken, there are prostitudes and such things, so I don't recomend seeing that for father daughter bonding. I don't know about Push though, good luck!|`|doHNEvf8aa	Taken! its amazing! <br>  and its about a father and a daughter.|`|czd8Nk9Naa	I saw Taken and it was really good! I don't think it would be awkward. It's  got action in it.|`|dEvkWEbXaa	Taken is a very good movie to see and i have not seen Push yet|`|D9iE2JBKaa	no a movie is a movie so i think you and your dad will like any of them|`|9YWvGTjuaa	yea i guess. my dad said they were both good. sounds good to me. just make sure ur over 12 for taken!|`|Suf8Giy6aa	push..but i never heard about taken!! beside your dad is a man and he'll probably enjoy push!!|`|kgrT3NuAaa	taken kicks @$$.<br>  <br>  I think it'd be perfect for you and your dad to have some bonding time... after all, that's what the entire movie is about. Liam Neeson plays the part of an under appreciated father/husband and does his best to protect people and it isn't until his own daughter gets kidnapped that his ex-wife (and daughter) realize how dedicated he is towards the things that he cares about. <br>  <br>  I've watched it about 5 times now because @ss kicking has never been more satisfying.|`|ItYSaSt1aa	i just saw taken last night (im 16). great movie, really cool. funny i dont know if you know this or not but the whole movie is about a father finding his daughter. great movie, nothing awkward really for u about it. nothing scary, and one girl just says she wants to get laid (big deal). go see it!|`|YMFunEr3aa	I disagree, taken is more like a horror movie so if you're in to that go ahead. Push is action packed, it has a small sexual scene but I think its a much better movie than taken|`|j2hvbwLQaa	Never saw Push, but Taken was really good and actually has to do with a father and daughter..if you like action it is definitely a good one to see..and nothing too awkward or scary.|`|5ktP8taqaa	i think push is a better idea to watch with ur dadcause taken has prostitution in it, and it'll probably cause akwardness.|`|biv6gKOXaa	I liked the movie Taken. I watched it with my dad. It has good action in it.|`|2J1Ca4Bbaa	Push is a GREAT movie!<br>  You should go see it, it's awesome :)<br>  They don't have like any make out scene, no awkwardness trust me.|`|xUDbzhWfaa	Taken was great, and it kind of fits the Father/Daughter thing.... since it's about a father and a daughter...|`|JdRcgAgvaa	yes
zdu3gh8jaa	What about jigsaws? The charity shops usually have loads that they sell for just a few pence. You could also try crossword puzzles, these would keep her mind active. Could she knit or crochet? If so how about doing cuddly animals for charity? Again many charity shops have balls of wool or you could unravel some old woolies and recycle the wool from those. Another suggestion would be to make a patchwork blanket using the wool. Does she like to read? If so get lots of books from the library and have a 'reading club'. She could invite friends over and they culd tell each other what they are reading, what it is about and whether or not it is worth reading. Can she still bake or cook? If she can, spend one day a week baking treats for you to share. Do you have a garden that she can look out onto, try putting bird seed hangers in a position so that she can watch her feathered visitors. What about gardening, could she plant and tend some easy salad veg - radish, cut and come again salad leaves, spring onions etc. <br>  <br>  I hope some of these suggestions help in some way.|`|CDBRXtnLaa	sign her up for a knitting club or a book club|`|HT1ar9m4aa	What really interests her, walking, cards, good old movies some that made you cry, talking to old friends, what? My Step dad died of Alzheimer's in 2006. Once I figured that out we did it. after lunch and dinner he liked to take a walk. Sometimes several times around the mobile home park where he lived, they didn't like my freightliner parked  in the park but oh well they can live with it for a few days. He was a truck and diesel mechanic most of his life and he loved talking about it. The nice thing is they want you to spend time with them even if its just for a few days at a time and then gone and back  in a month. No matter what it is companionable time is the key.

n09TKFj9aa	Whoo! Sometimes it's just easy to tell by the way they look at you. When a guy is interested in you, you just get it. In your head you ask yourself, is this true? Does he like me?<br>  If you have to ask yourself that, after gestures you get and friends of his who go over to talk to you, then he most likely likes you too. Like I said, sometimes you just know, it's natural.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	He'll stare at you a lot (and when you catch him, he will smile or look away quickly) <br>  When you are talking to others (say in a group, including him) he will face you.<br>  When you talk, he will touch your arm or shoulder.<br>  When you talk, he will lean in towards you<br>  When you talk (lol), his toes will be pointed toward you and his shoulders will be relaxed.<br>  He will try to show off when you are around him to catch you attention.<br>  He'll look you in the eye.<br>  Want to know a lot about you.<br>  When you talk, he will really listen.<br>  I could go on for day's about this..<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AA11324847	Usually if we smile at you, it's a sign of approval, that's your cue to smile back if you do....|`|7eV6SM5Naa	When he tells you . Duh !|`|blDGgrv5aa	I know when I like someone who I don't really talk to that much, I show some very distinct signs. Usually every day, I either can't keep my eyes off the girl I like, or either I try to avoid looking at her at all costs. Either extreme usually says he likes you. But if you like him back, then try talking to him more. He's probably just shy like I am and is just too afraid to start a conversation. Then maybe if he can muster up the courage, he will ask you out to a date.|`|JavoRs6Raa	Depends on the guy.  He might be really shy around and seem like he's avoiding you but if you see him stare or glance at you every few minutes he probably digs you.  <br>  Other guys will just be straight up with you.  <br>  If the guy seems to get nervous everytime you talk theres a fair chance he's into you also.|`|Fv337tR1aa	Usually when guys like you they tease you and kinda bug you a lot, those other things you mentioned are usually signs too, you can also tell if they like you if they keep glancing back at you like every chance they get...<br>  Hope this helped!|`|AA10182949	Long time after you really think he likes you.  all the eye contact and private conversations are well known to boys as ways to make girls like them.|`|daZdspqtaa	well apparently da guy with the gestures sort of likes u but hes trying to stay as far away form u bcuz his friend likes u........|`|VDSHt23Aaa	if hes says he does<br>  answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhawDCBv5CQvWOYhqG0_YKvsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307143640AAjS7al">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|vN9HxLo7aa	Well a lot of guys will immediately look at you when you enter a room that they are in.

AaG5ashYaa	It'll be tough and awkward seeing her again but if you truly do love her then say something to her about it.  You won't ever let go of regret unless you do.  Just look her in the eyes and tell her you love her, flat out, no regrets.  Tell her what you love about her and what made you fall in love in the first place.  Never break eye contact with her.  When you first see her and its not too awkward kiss her hand instead of hugging her,  because hugging seems to friendly.  Hope this helped you..<br>  ~Kc~|`|qInosbWXaa	hahahah oreomilk. <br>  just smile and say hi|`|U5dCFomCaa	when you see her it will probably be awkward. so let the awkwardness sink in and once you know it is awkward, you have control of the situation. you can make a goof of yourself and make her laugh. you can let the awkwardness continue by not saying anything. so just say something and things will come naturally! (=|`|kkTjyeKNaa	Hit her in the face..it's always lucky. That's what my bf does to me to get me in the mood.

0ktcvglRaa	Actually, that is perfectly normal! Not every couple goes to a ton of places together. I think the reason you two have been together for so long is because you don't get sick of each other. You don't see each other often enough to get annoyed or bothered by the other person.|`|oVGOW3xPaa	wha|`|s3Zbnj77aa	Different people have different relationships. If YOU (and him) are happy with the way things are, they it's fine! You might just like more independence from your significant other.<br>  <br>  My fiance and I belong to the other class, we do everything together (and live together). It's mainly because we don't have very many friends other than each other who we actually enjoy spending time with and can trust. If you two have separate friends that you enjoy being with outside of being with each other, that's great.<br>  <br>  If you feel you should do more together (not because other people do, but because it's what YOU want), then just talk to him and tell him how you feel.<br>  <br>  The most important thing in a relationship is COMMUNICATION. Maybe since your relationship has always been that way, he doesn't even realize you want to join him (if you even do!).<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope it works out for you guys!|`|BkMjabPvaa	well not everywhere but he should take you more|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	you shouldn't go everywhere with him. you both need your own lives. as long as you are happy with the amount of time you spend together, there's absolutely no problem. it wouldn't bother me if i were happy with him and got to spend some time with him.|`|geL6jbdpaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AspiUJKz_8W2mzdwjlI.SaPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307183415AAZ2v5Z">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|vMY3EF8baa	SQUISHY!|`|AA12133859	My parents recently celebrated their 42nd marriage.

I think so, but who knows..maybt other people might think differently.|`|b7Z3OSRwaa	I have been with my bf 12 years.

Its good to give each other some space from time to time.|`|3kpZrtmdaa	Maybe If You Asked Him Ta Go Places With You|`|2nc9k9BSaa	Actually, I applaud you. It's a healthy part of a relationship to spend time away from each other consistently. In that way, you both grow as people individually.<br>  <br>  As long as both of you find time to be together when you want to be, and your hearts don't stray, it's perfectly fine.|`|EJMwqU3caa	I think that there are a lot of variables on this.  How old and your guy?  Do you live together?  Do you go out together at other times?  Do you go out without him?  Is he showing signs of having inappropriate behavior?  Are you planning on getting married to this guy?<br>   <br>  If you are comfortable with your relationship, then don't let it get to you.  If you are beginning to 'worry' about it, maybe you should ask him about it, talk to him.  Try planning more date nights together.  See if he's willing to say no to some (not all) of his "boy-time."  Maybe try going out on double/group dates with mutual friends.  Or let him know that you wouldn't mind hanging out with the guys every once in a while - see if he's willing to bring you with for a guys weekend every once in a while.  Hopefully, this helps!  Ultimately, any good relationship needs good communication.  Make sure you are keeping "the lines" flowing between you!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|NtSQcyHLaa	No, I don't think there's anything wrong with him not taking you places, if that's how you've always been. But it could possibly mean something, and if it bothers you then you should talk to him about it. Ask him why it is that he does this, and see if there's a compromise that you two can come to on the matter. And I don't think there's anything wrong with the cabin thing at all. It sounds like it's just a "guy thing," which you should respect, as you have. I hang out with my girlfriend as much as I possibly can, but we both agree that having "girl/guy time" is necessary to maintain other important friendships.|`|sede5Hd2aa	I personally think you are doing the right thing. You can be with your boyfriend or girlfriend too much...this is what happened to me and my boyfriend. We were together all the time and in the end..that is what broke us apart. It is good that you and your boyfriend have your own lives. As long as you spend some time together you are fine. Good luck!!|`|V9qmbFQOaa	My husband and I have nothing in common except our kids and grand-kids. We met and married within two months. He loves his sports and I love the theatre. So many people are surprised when they discover I do have a husband. We have always had our own interests and really enjoy the quality time we do spend together. Couples do need to be individuals and not get lost in just one's interests. Couples who are only ever together must get sick of each other or else one of them has lost their own individuality.<br>  Give each other space but make sure you do have time together.<br>  We've been married for 42 years!!!!!|`|NTC6g8hYaa	No its okay if you dont go everywhere together! It builds trust ( cuz you can trust that they wont cheat) and it builds space. Like he knows you wont mind. But if you want to go with him to these places, ask him in a polite, flirty way. Im sure he'll be thrilled that youre showing interest! Good luck!|`|TfWanpwNaa	Hey, my realtionship has been a year and let me tell you.

Nothing is wrong.|`|HTbSiEVqaa	You ever heard of Cheaters. It was a t,v. show that would catch their significant other cheating. Find the truth and don't be naive.|`|SOqxJkobaa	if youre happy and hes happy then youre fine. dont worry about what other people think about your relationship. as long as it works for the 2 of you thats all that matters|`|HnkmYdYnaa	He may act differently with them then with you and might feel weird acting that way around you.|`|lPJSF3vRaa	If you are happy why worry|`|24i1jQBgaa	There are some  affairs you would not be comfortable. I would not want to be the only female at a all male week end at a cabin.You have a good relationship because you let him enjoy his male friends. No man wants to have his mate hanging on to him all the time. You are a smart girl. How long does the together always couples last?Keep doing what you are doing and enjoy each other. Sounds like you have a real,lasting love to me.|`|XTSiJBv4aa	guys need to be able to hang out with their friends, just like you should be able to leave him for a few hours and hang out with your friends. why does it bother you so much now, since you have been together 3 years and never had a problem with it before? if he is going places with other girls, then i would be very, very worried, but if he is hanging out with his guy friends, then give him a break.|`|Rp0XXwicaa	he needs him time|`|SDXhdNAqaa	well it just means hes just likes to hang out with his friends but if hes doing it A lot you should ask him when are we going to go on a date again its been a while or go out with your Friends and just have fun because the boy and the girl just might want some time to spend with there friends. So get all your friends together and hang out at a mall and talk or do what you do best.|`|6yX6ILMTaa	if it's just guys going to the cabin, it's probably good you don't go. first, something could happen despite your attempts, and two, i've been going to a cabin with only men in the U.P. since i was 3, and trust me, it probably would no be fun for you ;p|`|uNvF299Caa	I don't think so.  I think you guys have a very healthy relationship.  It's really good that he has a social life that doesn't involve you all the time.  And that you have a social life that doesn't involve him all the time.  Don't listen to what people say.  If you trust him, and he trusts you who cares what other people say.  Women don't need as much as men, but men need to hang out with the guys, do guy things. Enjoy single life.  If you guys get married, it will change a little, you'll probably be doing a lot more things together.  When you get married keep doing the same thing, you'll see your relationship will always be healthy.  <br>  But, it doesn't hurt to ask him why he doesn't invite you to go with him.  It doesn't hurt to let him know that you are concerned that people ask why are you not together at these places.  And even ask if you can trust him, or tell him that you trust him.|`|B22h0TI9aa	no i mean yall need yor space and if you feel like your relationship is fine then there you go but other wise if your still not fur sur go more places with him ask him to go with You|`|daZdspqtaa	i think dat wat ur doin is fine cuz guys need time to chill with their homeboys............. if u went with him everywhere he would get annoyed .............ur relationship would be messed up if u did this..............|`|bexpzOGfaa	its just how he date.

If you think he is sleeping with the maid you might want some evidence on that first. But try to remember why you married him in the first place.

uNvF299Caa	I understand where you are coming from.  It's a very expensive TV and you don't want anything to happen with it. It's ok to have that rule.  But at the same time it's just a TV and your family should be able to enjoy as much as you do.  If they are doing their homework, being good kids, tell them the TV is expensive and they need to be careful.  Maybe try it slowly letting them watch while you are in the house, not necessarily in the TV room, see how they behave. If they are doing well, then, let them watch while you are not home.  <br>  <br>  If you still think they shouldn't watch while you're not with them, don't worry about what the rest of the family say.  I think they should do things outside anyway and not watch so much TV. :)|`|vg2xABZjaa	when i brought hom the 62" and tried the same move I was accused of spending allot of money on something just for me.

After a few weeks of her being pissed and telling everyone how i bought a tv just for me i gave up..now i just say when it breaks everyone can pitch in on fixing it. I have considered mounting a box to the wall with a slot for change and just charging fifty cents a day to watch it.|`|Azengymsaa	Depends how old they are.|`|PV9YFZNmaa	ask your family are they going to pay for it if the children bust it and if they say no then tell them to mind their own business
vg2xABZjaa	I wouldn't let them ride in it either. It is weird that people think you should be driving your kids around in your new car. They must not have kids or see what they do to the backseats. I say do what you want to do and tell people the GTO is your sunday driver.|`|aPxmZq00aa	Don't worry about what others say. You have to haul kids around with their stuff and their dirty shoes, etc. Of course you can let your kids have a ride to the ice cream store or somewhere with you, but keep your old car for everyday chores of driving the kids around.

NB4h4jTyaa	Threatening to have an abortion because you're mad at your ex is the worst kind of blackmail and the worst reason to have an abortion. I support a woman's right to choose, but you need to get a grip on yourself.|`|WgIZUcYfaa	This guy sounds crazy. It doesn't sound like a healthy relationship. I wouldn't want to bring a kid into a situation like that.<br>  <br>  I think you should seriously think about what YOU want to do. What is going to be the BEST thing for your child.<br>  <br>  If you think getting an abortion is in the best interest for you both then you should do it. It is your life and your choice. Nobody else has the right to tell you what to do.<br>  <br>  If he has threatened to kill you already though, I would tell him that you had a miscarriage...as messed up as that is. He sounds like a REALLY big crazy! Do what is best for you. And no matter what just remember that it will all be okay sooner than later. Good luck! My heart goes out to you.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	So you're getting an abortion bc of him? Sad reason.<br>  <br>  He has no romantic connection to you anymore. That's what ex means. The only obligation he has is to the child. He's no longer committed to you. It's unrealistic for you to expect him to act like you're still together. You might want to check the law regarding whether he needs to be informed or not prior to the procedure.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	like okay. Please both of you grow up and stop playing childish games. The word like is not meant to be used that often, and makes any one sound uneducated. <br>  <br>  As for the abortion that one is completely on you.|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	FOLLOW YOUR HEART about make a right choice to do with the baby right now.<br>  <br>  He need GROW UP!!!

If you're already down in the thought of abortion than I don't know what else to say. Just know that this baby didn't do anything wrong. & lying to him would be wrong because whether you like it or not he is the father.<br>  <br>  Live your own life however you choose and keep the baby or not remember you're the one who's going to live this life.<br>  He has no right to threaten you about a baby that he doesn't even care about. Try to talk to him and if things don't work out it's always up to your choices.<br>  <br>  Take care|`|Q5DF9LpHaa	You need two things..To do what is right for you, and a restraining order against this man.<br>  <br>  Do not let him play games with your heart or your mind, he is your ex and neither of these is any concern to him any longer.<br>  <br>  If you decide to keep the baby (and that decision is yours) only speak to him when it concerns the child you two create together otherwise it seems that your relationship with him is purely toxic.|`|081168f28573ebfa7f89cf91f00a1e36aa	He sounds like a jerk!!! And girl let me tell you if you have this baby, it's going to get worse!!! I'm not telling you what you should do, but just be careful with this guy because he sounds crazy!!!|`|Qsu6OSqwaa	Please you are allowing him to ruin your life.  If you do not want him in it then don't answer his text.  It is that simple.  As far as the baby goes God does not make mistakes when choosing to give life to someone.  There are other options besides an abortion.  If you decide to keep your baby don't put his name on the birth certificate, trust me you will have less problems if you go that route unless you want child support.  Also, nothing is stop you from going out and having fun just like anyone else, it may just be a different kind of fun from what you imagined.  Pray and you will figure out what you need to do.|`|jdcexBKfaa	omg wat the hell is his problem?? he is ur ex for a reason y does he still talk to u nad make u feel mad when he isnt with u ne more, i dont think u should care about him either. i feel its wrong ur taking ur anger out on the baby, u never kno, that baby might be the best thing that happened for u, everything happens for a reason and god gave u a life, and not for u to take, i kno he is a jerk but this is ur baby and its such a precious gift that u should never think like that about, besides hes just talk about the killing thing, but if he rlly wanted to maybe he could since he is in the military and has connections to track u down, but like i said, do not get and abortion!!!|`|naequcqlaa	You do what you KNOW is the rite thing for yourself & the baby.  If it was NOT meant that you have this baby, only YOU know the answer to this.  This is YOUR body to do whatever YOU feel is the rite thing for YOU.  He is not there w/you, it's NOT really any of his business as to what you decide to do, nor is it any of his business as to "what happened".  There would be NO WAY he would know for sure just what happened unless you tell someone.  It's NO ONE"S business but your own as to the choice you end up making.  He is NOT "father material" & it also appears he's not even "husband material".  Do as YOU see fit & it's NONE of his business whatsoever.  I do NOT even believe he would or even could bring any happiness into a child's life!  He sure isn't bringing any happiness into yours. I guess you can pretty well read between my "lines" as to the total fact that you & only you are the decision maker in this case.  Do as you see fit for all those who would be involved.  Things do happen for reasons, do what you feel would be the BEST reason, then get out of his life completely as you could have NO reason to keep him even in it.  I DO wish you all the best...:)

Set up an xbox, wii, ps3 9whatever gaming console you have) on the tv for the guys. For the girls have some nail polish, hand cream, massage things etc. also have set up a heap of food and some board games.<br>  <br>  Don't expect the guys and girls to mix together well. that's why i recommend the xbox/gaming console. <br>  <br>  Don't have the TV/DVD on. Watching movies (unless it is a "movie night" party) is the boringest thing EVER to do at parties.<br>  <br>  On my coffee table I have 'toys' like stress balls, liquid timers, a set of russian dolls, little gift books etc. People love having something to play with in their hands.<br>  <br>  if you want to make sure your friends don't feel left out, don't spend lots of time kissing and hugging your boyfriend. Spend time with your friends and let him spent time with him.<br>  <br>  Games like "never have I ever" (where you have a bowl of peanuts in the middle, you say "never have I ever..." (eg: snuck out of the house) and everyone who has done that takes a peanut and eats it), truth or dare, 2 truths and a lie, etc etc and a fun way of people getting to bond better.|`|KqCeRQHUaa	play games<br>  <br>  ask for opinions about what they want to do|`|7OFf25Nkaa	it really depends on what they like some of my friends like to play poker when they come over and some of them like to play the xbox or something and sometimes they just like to chill. my point is ask your friends i mean were not the ones that are gonna be hangin out at your house right?

S3Mqe64Aaa	hahahahah...drop your pen in class and then pick it up, and say...excuse me..is this yours and try to hand it to him. OR YOU CAN DO THE BEND AND SNAP (: <3|`|NtSQcyHLaa	If he's really dying for you to talk to him (and it sounds like he is), then he's not going to sound like a creeper if you go up to him and say something. I was the shy kid, too, and I would have loved it if some of the girls I liked would have helped me out because of my shyness. So just say hi and strike up a short conversation. Then let it go from there.|`|on93gZmxaa	if he has a myspace, or facebook, request to be his friend and try to create small talk. or ask for his phone number. but dont talk too much on myspace or txting cuz that makes it akword at school. just ask him if he wants to hang out or something. if hes looking at you he obviously thinks your hott, so play that to your advantage.|`|aNPphuHhaa	Just when one of your friends are talking to him go up to him and say hi to him and join in on there conversation and sence one of your friends are they and your talking to both of them it wont be so wierd, then later in the day just go up to him alone and say hey.|`|5PWmGqzTaa	Just something random, like asking for a pencil, then after class return it and try to start a conversation. <br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|D9iE2JBKaa	sit beside him in class, then ask him for a pencil and tell him your name|`|JavoRs6Raa	I'm the kind of guy that goes and talks to the ladies instead of them coming to talk to me but heres some advice from my perspective.  You say he's dying to talk to you, so you walk by him some day and "accidentaly" bump into him.  Give him a 'cute''sorry' look when you do that and then say sorry(of course).  Then say 'so, what's your name', he will ask yours if he's interested, now all you have to do is keep the conversation flowing.  So, all it takes is that easy conversation starter.  Theres other ways you can first meet him but this one seems to work out most of the time.|`|oOU6XJOqaa	First off, never use the word creeper in your life span ever, ever, freaking ever again. I hate that word, its so douchey. But i am not just going to sit here and lecture you about the use of your vocabulary. I will offer you my advice on how you may be able to befriend this guy. <br>  <br>  Steadily observe how he acts around other students that may be declared as a friend of his. Then attempt to imitate their style and strike a conversation in which he can relate too. If he is "dying to talk to you," he will pick up on what your working at and play along. This may bind you two together and create an amazing friendship, or it may fail. Good Luck :)<br>  <br>  P.S. don't use the word rubbish either, its douchier than creeper.|`|GNa37oJXaa	well if he plays a sport or something or is in a club anything like that just bring up something like if hes in a sport be like hey _______ that was a great game you played the other night or hey whens ur next game?? if you wanna be friends first just keep it casual and things can go from there you wont look like a creeper if you just say hi ppl say hi to ppl everyday|`|Fv337tR1aa	If I was you, like in class if there was an assignment, I would like ask him for either help on it, or like ask him if he finished it, like after that then I would just keep gradually keep talking to him... Then you will probably talk a lot, Ta Da! Hope this helps!|`|tFMnB4DIaa	I might be a guy but I think you should say hello to him when he turns around. Or in a class you should ask him to borrow his text book or calculator or something and then say thanks in a sweet voice.... trust me even though I'm a guy I've had alot of experience with girls.<br>  <br>       hope that helped|`|oSodcAWraa	Just say hey.It's not weird if your just saying hey or whats up, and just be yourself. It's not like you have to change one bit for him. Just casual heys and smiles will work perfectly fine. It seems like he already does so you just have to get things started. :D<br>  Good Luck!|`|uNvF299Caa	You could just start by asking him if he likes something and then ask something else. Just be yourself and try to be friends.|`|LRC5ns2xaa	use convo starters<br>  or have a friend be good friends with him and then start talking!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|K9BT12kpaa	u wont just say hey really sutaly and talk to him about hw or something|`|coQ3EPTbaa	walk up to him and say hi, lol its not rocket science|`|L7KqUuEZaa	Ok this is funny for some reason to me...lol ok lets see...When you think your homework was hard for one of the classes go up to him and ask him"Hi, i am _____. Do you think our homework was hard?" or somthing like that. Then he will say something and then keep talking and change the subject after a while. AND smile alot. (let your smile-feeling touch your eyes) But don't smile so much that he might think its weird. Ask your friends to have a small party and let them invite him and you go too and start talking to him again and asked basic stuff "Do you like sports?" "what sports you play" (if he does?) And if you are not too shy to pretend his hair is messed up and sooth it(its a flirt thing).(if he lets you. also)|`|Wv8hdSTAaa	If he turns around to look at you smile at him and then look away, then after class instead of just leaving make an effort to walk next to him on your way, start a conversation like did you finish this? or can you explain this to me? or just say hi and he'll say hi, ask him if he knows one of ur friends,,,,,,or have a friend introduce you to him!! or if you want real results have ur friend tell him tht you like him.. it might be akward for awhile but it will pay off!!! thts how me & my bf got 2gether!! lol|`|geL6jbdpaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AspiUJKz_8W2mzdwjlI.SaPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307183415AAZ2v5Z">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|SYs8OEHlaa	Well i think you should ask him "why are you staring at me" after class. He will most likely stutter or be lost for words, and be slightly embarrased. But quickly after (dont let him get too embarrassed) say you are kidding and that you dont mind or something showing him you are kind of interested. This will make him relieved and most likely will break the tension between the two of you. Then just go onto a conversation. Good luck !|`|PGQoh45Uaa	If you can tell hes dying to talk to you, then just go and talk to him..that easy.. just start a conversation, and if you talk to him, he won't think you are a creep. because you think he is dying to talk to you, wouldn't that be a good thing for him ?|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well you won't look like a creeper, he will be so happy you talked to him. Just do so, just say "hey" or when he looks at you, smile at him. It will not look creepy, you will look confident. Just go for it, I mean, what can you lose. It is not like you guys talked or anything.|`|7eV6SM5Naa	Just introduce yourself & talk about something that relates to some of your classes. <br>  Example:<br>  You: Hi, My name's ___. You're in my ___ class, right ?<br>  Him: Yeah, I'm ___.<br>  You: So ___ class is pretty hard.

I have given much consideration to possible fates for the person who broke my relationship with my spouse, but now, it is the spouse herself to whom I now seek to mete out justice.  It was, after all, my spouse who broke my relationship with my spouse, so she is the one from whom I should seek my revenge.<br>  <br>  Murder is never a solution to anything, as far as I'm concerned.  Dead people don't suffer.  It's the ones left behind, like kids and family, who do all the suffering.  So murder is right out, however natural it might be to contemplate.<br>  <br>  So what is it that really terrifies people?  If you want revenge, it makes sense that realizing a person's worst fears would be a great way to punish that person, no?  Do you know what more people fear than death?  Public speaking.  And that's scary because what people truly fear more than anything is embarrassment.  And there are many ways to embarrass a person, but each should be tailored to suit the target.|`|mcmOslOFaa	I don't think I would do anything...i would just move peacefully because I am a good person and obviously that person is not so why should I sink to their level?  behave and never wish death on anyone or say you would kill somebody, that's just sick and twisted in your own demented way.  For thos of you that said that......get a life...a real one!|`|SOqxJkobaa	the best revenge is living the best life you can and living to the fullest despite what they've done to you. cause when they see how marevlous you're doing and that you're doing it without them it'll kill them|`|1hYvPqkBaa	well if a boy breaks up for you for example start hangin around a other guy. or if soemone breaks something of yours at night time well their sleeping do something involved of what their scared of most exapmle snakes put a gardner snake in their bed|`|Ph01lBawaa	Revenge is a dish best served cold.

QNG0zkQRaa	That's a tough one...the best answer that I could give is when your hanging out do things that will keep you guys busy, like going to the arcade, playing pool, go bowling. If your hanging  indoors play card anything that involves keeping the mind and body busy. Try talking as much as possible (not always about yourself) but just about things in genral maybe current events, i dunno.

You're talking about a ho, not a garden tool. I don't mean to be an annoying grammar Nazi, I'm just correcting you so you know.<br>  B) No, she's not. It was a bad decision, though. She should wait until she's married, not just so she doesn't seem easy, but to have a bit of self-respect. She's no ho though. Ho means whore, and whore means prostitute. Prostitutes are people who have sex for money, you know that. This girl doesn't do it for money, does she? But anyway, I know what you meant. You meant a ****. And no, it doesn't make her a **** either. You don't know her situation either, who knows why she decided to lose her virginity? And maybe she's just done it once or twice. That's not slutty.<br>  Or, maybe she's done it quite a few times and with many people. That would seem slutty to me.<br>  But, having a boyfriend and having sex isn't the best decision either. Wait until you're MARRIED! It's the best way to do it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: She's clearly afraid of what you'll think of her when she tells you. And judging by how you phrased the question, I don't blame her. Be as understanding as you can and make sure she knows you won't judge. You're her friend for her personality, not how many times her vagina has been entered. When she tells you, decide for yourself. But don't tell anyone or show your reaction. It'll hurt her feelings.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	No, she's not.|`|BitAsc8daa	hoe fo' sho'|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Ever think that she might have been raped?|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	Way more complex.<br>  There's a reason for everything.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Much more complex.

lwG6tvOqaa	I guess being in Mexico has brought something out in him that he didn't realize existed until he came back and saw how life is for your son. He probably feels that your son is spoiled, and wishes that he could've had what he has.<br>  <br>  I think that your husband should get some therapy. There seems to be some deep rooted issues that he hasn't worked out. It is a shame when an adult is jealous of a little kid. However, i do know some adults out there like that in my life.<br>  <br>  If the abuse continues, then maybe you should take a break from him to let him get his issues worked out. I would hate to hear about another story of domestic violence ending in someone getting severly hurt or worse. That is how one of my good friends was killed and she was only 14. Her stepdad had some rage issues, and killed her, her 13 year old brother, and her mom.<br>  <br>  PS: Please try and get these issues worked out before they destroy your family.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	Because your husband is really a monster and you need to get your kid away from him now.|`|uAzToWC7aa	maybe his family told hin\m to do that when he was in mexico. so sit  down awnd talk with him|`|4S6V4sb4aa	OK first of all,, him being poor and having a bad childhood is no excuse at all..

It's nothing agaisnt you or your son, it's because all of his memories have come back from spending so much time in Mexico visiting his family.

He is just having a rough time. After visiting Mexico, his childhood memories flashed in front of him and that brought out pain and anger. <br>  He is a jerk for abusing your son and saying mean things. And a grown man shouldn't be dumping his issues on you and your son. talk to him personally and tell him that you are trying to be understanding. But your son is 3 and he doesn't understand what this is all about. Maybe you and your husband can be truthful to your son and teach him that there are kids out there who are very unfortunate. Make him learn the reality at an early age. (nothing gruesome, just that other kids don't have toys etc etc). Just try to calm your husband down. <br>  If he is still very rude and abusive...then I think you know what to do.|`|loG7TrLMaa	Guyanese

But until then, stay faithfull, your boss won't respect you and value knowing you're cheating on your husband, what would stop you from doing the same to him and you got serious with him?

Aren't  you smarter than to make a mistake that you already know is stupid?!  Do not get involved w/someone else's husband.  Trust me on this one, IF you break up another marriage, there is NO WAY the two of you w/ever be happy.  Reason?  Because happiness cannot be built on something that caused others to be hurt by your actions.  Take it from someone who did it, someone who now is divorced because of it.  You just cannot be happy at someone else's expense.  It just does NOT work that way.  Stay away from him, keep away from him, & do in your heart what you know is the rite thing to do by everyone involved.  I cannot say it any planer, I cannot say it more truthful.  Do what you KNOW is the rite thing or you're going to pay dearly for making one BIG mistake...Good luck to you...:)|`|o5jSID4Jaa	Sounds like a disaster waiting to happen!

If you and he just ABSOLUTELY can not get along for this assignment, then you should ask your teacher to consider a switch before immaturity leads to a failing grade.|`|bmhT1IrTaa	i wouldnt even try... i tried to get this guy to talk to me again and it failed miserably <br>  unless yor relationship ended with an ok<br>  which hardly ever happens<br>  good luck on your decision

jBigEy0Caa	Maybe he doesn't want to be your friend.  There are some people you just don't care to talk to and it sounds like he is being very kind by just ignoring you.  I would leave him alone, he probably has a new girlfriend.|`|J7GTIE5raa	why worry about it if you arent together anymore?<br>  <br>  find someone new|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	He's acting that way because you dumped him. Why should he be your friend now?|`|8ilHQMq5aa	because hes your ex. and wants to move on|`|b87ee7794207ceaf35296b9c24769096aa	There is a reason why he is your EX. It is by Definition that he should ignore you.<br>  <br>  Besides he must have bad MEMORY flashes looking at you. <br>  <br>  BTW, are you Blond? (stupid comment)|`|oB4KxwuJaa	He wants to move on. You need to move on to so he won't think that you are a psycho.  Maybe he has found someone else.|`|MMBrsrbcaa	HELLO............. He dumped you now move on.  Quit bothering him and going on his Myspace.  As the movies says He is just not into you.|`|XrtmT2kUaa	Maybe he got hurt and he is reacting to it. No one takes well to rejection. Give it time.|`|du5MNrQ6aa	because he is your ex.|`|nGT1SJYKaa	not everyone wants to be friend with their ex's...there's a reason you broke up|`|DuTeclwuaa	that's because you stopped putting out.<br>  <br>  <br>  simple.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	hes probably acting this way because you guys are broke up and hes not interested in friendship with you. why did you break up with him? could he still be mad about it? or maybe hes just not over you and it hurts to be just friends. it really depends on what kind of guy he is.|`|85V6cHe4aa	I think he wants to move on and i think you should too.
vt8dJNhdaa	hey at least she didnt really stab you in the back cause that would hurt|`|fPN2KV1Taa	There are many fish in the sea. She's not a good friend. You should look for better friends. She's not worth your kindness. You should move on. Let God be the judge. Don't do revenge, because God will do it for you. :)<br>  <br>  By the way, you should minimize the use of exclamation points since it makes you look like you're shouting. :) (Although you really aren't)|`|WnQn8sYOaa	if she was a best friend, she would of helped you get that guy to ask you out but she made out with him that is not what a best friends do <br>  <br>  leave her|`|D20JGTwXaa	You told the situation bt where is thequestion? "my bf stabbed me in the back isastatement not a question. And if you wondering what to do ...stop bein her friend . She is unloyal and if your forgive her she will continue to backstab you and hurt you.True best friends know not to like a boy you like so let her go. She obviously doesnt care about yu or your feelings.|`|lYoIO2JVaa	your best friends is a b!tchface.<br>  friends like that arent worth it, they arent true friends.<br>  if i were you id just let karma get her and never talk to her again.<br>  there are way more guys out there too.<br>  just be careful whio you trust from now on, you get screwed over, and it happens so easily.|`|7U23Ru3iaa	she obviously isnt your friend if she asked him out. a true friend wouldnt hurt another like that. communication is key in any relationship, and friendships, and if she aint talkin, it aint worth it.

gfmTgLDKaa	Start with small talk, and try to talk to boys more often. Don't be afraid to talk to them!<br>  <br>  More importantly, always be yourself, and if they don't like how you are then screw them they are not worth it. :D<br>  <br>  Good Luck! Enjoy. :D|`|coQ3EPTbaa	well start talking to guys with girls with you, then you'll just have a flowing conversation. then you'll get your confidence up.
VPOVFc6laa	itis impossible for you to be freinds with people who u dont feel comfortable with! it'll be for your own good if you do change freinds! cuz it seems you're their follower and you're in their shadoes only! ure a very good person and i can tell, so its not nice that people are not seeing that, just because oof your freinds doings!<br>  <br>  countinue being freinds with them, like talking into class and all,,,, but just dont hang with em much. your mama knows whats best for you.<br>  and it seems youre not happy by the way ure freinds are!|`|oQq1rqDVaa	I am with your Mom on this one.  Unfortunately you are judged by the people you hang out with and this lot are not a good influence on you.  Find friends that are not so wild.  You don't have to fit in with this crowd and would just lose your self respect if you did.|`|ded67a0b2e7e52c2691947fb4e226735aa	Your mother is just concern about you. They are your friends and they can influence you. She does not want you to be like them, knowing and having lots of bf. Choose your friends well, they are a reflection of you.|`|easm1TkYaa	You don't need to surround yourself with those kinds of people. You don't "seduce" guys until marriage! Grrr...|`|kWyatjbRaa	Um..you're a good girl.<br>  Um..they are bad girls..<br>  <br>  Good girls and bad girls don't mix.<br>  <br>  Ditch 'em.|`|o1pwdWWXaa	whats the question? thnx 4 2 points...|`|F4fjT1bLaa	wtf is dat?|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	you can pick your friends, you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friend's nose.|`|kWjy7uzAaa	Your friends sound like sluts , and you are who you hang out with so thats why I think your parents don't want you to hang out with them. Dating a bunch of older guys who use you and can you doesn't make you cool it makes you slutty and stupid.
Lp27eolgaa	personally I treat women with respect and dont view them as that.  but no it never really crosses my mind how they would feel about it other than I know women like to be liked for their personality and not their looks, as do I.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	Here's the thing: girls like you are impossible.  Let me explain.<br>  <br>  You don't want to be ugly.  You wouldn't want to be so ugly that no one looked at you.<br>  <br>  You call us "pervy" but really, if you're attractive of course you're going to get looked at.  Of course guys are going to want to have you based completely on your sexual attractiveness.  That's why it's called "attraction".  We are literally attracted to you.  And that's not wrong, or pervy, it's the healthy natural response to seeing a sexually attractive person.<br>  <br>  What you want is to be noticed only by guys (or girls, I don't know your preference) that you find attractive.  Well, it doesn't work that way.  Grow up.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	All I want a girl to have a hearty appetite and a normal human beings.  I really hate when girls are full of themselves and matters only their body images.  I don't really mind girls who are vegetarians.|`|EuJTvGkxaa	I know what you mean. Most of my friends are like that, only wanting a girl for sex so they dont really care about them. But yea most dudes are like that =/ It sucks, even for dudes like me who arn't like that because their friends totally change to impress a girl they only want for sex.|`|AA11324847	Do you ever think how a guy feels about being seen as "the friend"? I rest my case.|`|aPGPbbz7aa	Yea totally , i know what you mean its so frustrating|`|lFzFtiCBaa	never crosses our minds....we're too busy grabbin our junk and checkin out girls.|`|9CeBI6gAaa	Yes, I agree completely. I had a conversation about this with my friend once. She has REALLY big breasts and all the guys stare at her. Some even follow her around. The thing is, she kind of causes it herself because she shows a ton of cleavage. That's the thing I don't get. If you're so offended by us looking, then don't give us a reason to look!|`|lF7oQWk6aa	I do because I have sister and if a guy looks at my sister like that than there is also my 2 other brothers and we will mess the guy up. But your making it seem like you don't ever look at a guy. When a guy looks at a girl they're not always thinking I want to do that.|`|AA10415277	it has crossed my mind, but the women that get starred at the most are the ones who dress like they are a piece of meat.  <br>  <br>  it's like putting a cookie in front of a child, then tell them not to eat it.  we all know how that is going end up.|`|2qjIcSY6aa	well, personally, i don't think of a girl as a piece of meat because i don't fantasize about having sex with a steak.|`|WQ4hXvzmaa	Of course some guys do.  not all of them unfortunately.|`|Qzhb7zYEaa	sadly, yes i have.<br>  <br>  because i'm the only guy in a house of 5 girls.|`|dEvkWEbXaa	every now and then|`|NtSQcyHLaa	No offense to you, but a lot of girls put themselves out there to be treated or viewed as a "piece of meat" because of how they dress and handle themselves in public. It's still not right for a guy to objectify women like that, but women have to keep themselves in check, too. With that said, I do not see women as pieces of meat. I know guys who do, and it's disgusting. But some women need to clean up there act, too.|`|4StO2m0iaa	I'm a girl, and i don't buy into tha whole u gotta be a size 1 thing. i just care about being healthy and staying fit! and when these girls finally do grow up they will see the stupid decions they made like starving themselves. and in tha long run if they had just focused on being healthy and staying fit, they will see that they would be a lot healthier when they are older.|`|bac56376717ea35d80831d3370c0f54baa	not realy that much, If i am checking out a pretty girl i dont think of her as a piece of meat, I think of her as a person<br>  <br>  I am happy for girls to check me out!!!!!|`|1673qFROaa	haha wow.<br>  seems like your talking about pervry teens.<br>  <br>  not ALL men are like that.<br>  <br>  i mean seriously....you expect us to believe you girls dont do that too?<br>  <br>  not ALL guys are like that.|`|2nc9k9BSaa	Erm, guys will stare at girls because they think she's hot and confident. It doesn't mean that the guys are perverted, but rather because they are astounded that such a hot girl exists.|`|AA11741696	No, we think girls like it, cuz they dress up to look pretty and sexy.  What do you girls think we are going to think when you wear short skirts and low cut shirts.....|`|Fue5b9wmaa	You know.. i'm a sensitive guy.. but it really never has crossed my mind that staring could be annoying. I guess that is something I should make sure I don't do in the future...|`|sBLxU6J0aa	Sometimes it does.|`|o1pwdWWXaa	sssooommmeeeooonnneee just got dumped >.>|`|qWSfV7vNaa	Yep, I think about it alot actually, trying to put myself in her shoes...Its hard.|`|zByvkeexaa	How do you know what we're thinking when we're staring? Maybe we're thinking about you in a non-pervert way.|`|08jvhNLDaa	u prolly hate me but idc and the answer is not really

wzqahEqiaa	I'm sorry you are hurting so much!  I know it's hard but try and distance yourself from your parents problems.  You are an individual and your parents are responsible for their own choices.  I don't know if you're a religious person but try watching EWTN.  There is a wonderful series on EWTN called Super Saints.  I wish I was there to give you a hug and I hope EWTN helps you!  Good Luck!|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I'm sorry, honey.  There's nothing you can do to keep them together.  The decision to stay together or break up is completely between them and has nothing to do with you.|`|pg0q9eoUaa	Unfortunately when moms & dads fight hurtful things are said;words are something you cannot take back; if they decide to divorce the children are also hurt; but if that is what they choose it does not mean that they don't both love you; it means they are not happy with each other and it is not working for them.There is nothing you can do; and you don't have to choose between them because you love them both.|`|djUMvICoaa	That was no question to ask a child, he should be ashamed of himself.  But it is when people are insensitive that things happen in a marriage that break it down too, not just your dad, but your mom too.  Try to remember this, that you love them both but you don't have to like what they do.  If you feel you have to hate one it plays tricks in your mind because how do you hate someone who has done so much for you and up until now loved with all your heart?  best of luck to you.|`|j7ZIK7imaa	Look my parents have been divorced and have been asking me this question for years. They got divorced when I was two and now i am 15. <br>  <br>  Just say I'll wait until somebody moves and stay with the parent where your friends and school are. Hang tough I know it is hard.|`|bkgBLjuvaa	i know, it hurts... but if your parents decide to get a divorce there is nothing you can do..|`|vCfPaWdGaa	tell them how you really feel then they might think about u b4 they think about each other

That would be abuse.|`|hfGE5jieaa	Hmmm. I wonder what would happen if they saw this question.|`|ULooBcT0aa	Listen I guess they thinking slapping is a way to learn. I don't think they mean it in person. My parents never slapped me because they knew yelling at me would get my mistake through me. Don't Worry!|`|ntdTJtqxaa	call your local child support center.

wp7vdcLCaa	Well You should try and plan a trip... it sounds like they are in a cycle that needs to break. If they don't want to fix their relationship however then you cannot change this. It is up to them. They obviously are unhappy but that is what they chose. Maybe buy them this book called "The Mastery of Love" by don Miguel Ruiz... if they want to change then this book will help. If they don't want to change then you can't help that... <br>  I hope you find the happiness you are looking for...|`|BUQSSTsOaa	talk to them and see what is going on
xaiNyZSVaa	i can't give a straight answer because its complex but i do know that you are an exceptional friend for caring about her so much that you would confront her for the things she was doing. If she doesn't see that your friendship isn't really worth it. I think you are a really great person so don't bag on yourself.|`|6BwCwuHwaa	she may feel that your her only real friend because your the one who's complained about the things she doing wrong.. your the one who actually cares  and i think she notices that i don't think you should feel bad at all  because i can relate to getting frustrated with a best friend because you only wants to  see the best of her .. & i believe she realizes that too i think she  just may get frustrated with hearing it over & over it may just b too much for her to hear at once i think maybe you should just chill  i understand you may not want her to do the things shes doing but it's obvious she doesn't really care too much about how you feel about it so i would just accept her as she is or maybe take sometime apart from her maybe.. i understand where your coming from don't feel bad you showed you care what more could you do .. if she loves you enough she would be willing to make some changes even if it's minor changes...=) GOOD-lUCK!!|`|Q14GCTgZaa	No you didn't. A good friend would tell their friend if they are going down the wrong road, which is what you did. A true friend is able to get mad at the other and forgive, so I think you were totally in the right. (Plus her ex-boyfriend sounds like a big jerk!)|`|AA11275104	No i would have done the same thing with my friend. If she wouldn't have listened I probably would have told her to forget being my friend and that's not the person I was friends with.|`|D20JGTwXaa	I think your a good friend. Your friend should find a new wy to deal with her emotions. Cutting yourself using drugs and abusing yourself on purpose is bad and althogh her other friends were ok with it you knew it was wrong and tried tp help her see right from wrong. I hope your friend is ok and you are entitled to your opinions. I dont think what you did was wrong. You both made mistakes but you gys are friends, so admit to your mistakes and move on. Hope this helps.|`|bmu6uhQ3aa	Ok, first of all that's a lot to read. lol. I don't think you should feel that you're an awful friend, I would have done the same. Tell her that you only try to change her because you care about her and her safety. Tell her also you don't want to lose this friendship. You decide if you still want to be her friend. good luck.|`|1b2ac8b579aba22af36184fccad80eb3aa	i now how  how u feel my friend cuts herself and is in  love with this gey who wants her to sneak out and have sex with her and its changed her u just have to say look u hurting  yourself and cutting yourself is not the way to get out of eneyting and  put her in a room made of sponge jk jk but u just got to keep a eye on her! trust me all good friends come to be friends again|`|HTj6AROQaa	(this is all assuming you are a girl) i think you did the right thing by telling her that it bugged you and she should stop, but if you really love her (as a friend) and you want to be friends again apoligize and make her a nice gift, or type up a letter to her saying that you are sorry for calling her names, tell her how much she means to you, and list some fun memories and decorate it or something. If you dont want to be friends then i think you should still write her a letter with the same stuff but also saying that things between yall will never be the same and that you had fun being her friend while you were friends and that you hope that she will make wise decisions in her future.|`|OnTEn16saa	don't call us EMO we HATE IT!!!! but u could of handled it better.<br>  she is messed up in the head. keep on helping her to stop all that crap.<br>  ......=jesus helps EVERYTHING!!!|`|kEAdzb6maa	I'm in the seventh grade and am one of the "Nerds."  I think, too much, and am always thinking of scenarios in my mind. She sounds like a very bad influence, but if you feel that you really betrayed her then you should but your differences aside and be friends. What she really needs is help, mentally and physically.  <br>  1. Tell her parents, or your parents what is happenening. <br>  2. Try to get her help. <br>  3. If she is your real friend, she'll understand you are trying to help you.|`|u1ByCgMGaa	you are just a good friend. <br>  being a good friend is not bad , good friends are honest. <br>  being honest & expressing how you felt about the situation was the best thing you could do. you should encourage your friend to take into account your opinion and try to make her understand that what you want is the best for her. <br>  <br>  ohh remember you are older, your level of maturity is higher therefore she probably does not understand about life as much as you. give her advice
lzEuuseJaa	Just say NO. <br>  Why on earth would you quit? That makes no sense whatsoever.<br>  Geesh, if I quit every job where I got hit on buy customers, etc, I'd never have a job.<br>  The parent is probably doing it because they know it makes you nervous and it's fun to get a reaction. <br>  Make sure your supervisor has your concern in writing, and you have a copy. Because who knows what the parent might do, they might get mad at being rejected and switch the story onto you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|EQeX35dWaa	I would go to my union.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	next time this person is going to be there make sure ur girl friend is there(if you dont have one, get a pretend one.) or get a wedding band and say you just got married over the weekend.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	If your supervisor is blowing it off you do need to contact the union, and have your union rep contact the sup. asap. This is also a parent, who you don't have to have that much contact with. Such contact can be limited to open meeting areas.|`|jBigEy0Caa	No, you need to tell this person her advances are inappropriate and put an end to it.  Stand up for yourself, you don't need your supervisor.|`|HRIbmp67aa	No, I'd schedule a meeting with my boss and his/her boss and try to resolve it.  If that didn't work, I'd take them to the next highest boss.  If still nothing, I'd press charges for sexual harassment.|`|9KOuOEy9aa	That's crap.  Are you part of any organization like NEA?  I would be very tempted to file sexual harassment charges and raise hell.  But before you do, let your supervisor know you will if this situation is not taken care of.  They are more likely to ban the parent from the building than have this sort of story plastered all over the TV.|`|oB4KxwuJaa	You need to tell the parent that they need to stop. You need to have a sit down with the supervisor and the parent and figure it out.  Good luck.

Call your Crisis Center in your area , get him into treatment and report it tell the person  about the families difficulties and his reasons for doing this . and then you pray for him. that's loving him.
SDXhdNAqaa	well i think you should talk to him casually and talk about different things and see what you have in common first and then be like hey can i ask you a question "i really like you and i was just wondering if you like me.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	He might just be shy, your only move here is to ask him if he does, then you will get your answer.|`|IVPZkJnvaa	He might just be shy<br>  Or afraid that you're not interested because he's a junior.<br>  ^thats the case with one of my friends thats a junior who likes this one girl I know, he's afraid the age difference will screw things up.<br>  Please answer mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjYPI.n04bBBFt.A8wuNPIXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307175442AAOc6mT">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|K9BT12kpaa	ask him why he did that and if its bull **** then break up<br>  <br>  <br>  bull ****=something caring that u know he probably thought up of on the spot.|`|0k85cJv2aa	Just freaken ask him what the deal is: if he likes you he should stop avoiding you.|`|RaeLHLHnaa	i did not understand any of that story.|`|daZdspqtaa	keep trying..................<br>  diz gut appearently likes u<br>  hes jst shy...............................<br>  maybe he getz nervous around u.........good luck ;]|`|6yX6ILMTaa	unfortunately, he probably is just playing you, and popcorn and tickets shouldn't win your heart. if he really likes you, the way i love my gf, he will NOT ignore you, and when he's around you he won't look at anybody but you for a long time.|`|riO929X4aa	Keep trying! ;)|`|9Zeyupt5aa	OK u have a big problem he's really shy but still likes you so try talking to him and b nice if u bring it up or it will b more weird|`|B22h0TI9aa	maybe try a lil more to see whats really wrong with him if you get nowhere just leave that fool to be wierd all by himself
wzqahEqiaa	It's not love.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	It's one of the most common fantasies married men have.  Usually it remains in the realm of fantasy.|`|EQeX35dWaa	Not love.|`|2n93DU71aa	My husband asked my to do that as well.... and I did because I wanted to  make him happy. I know that he loves me but I have noticed that if we are not having sex on a regular basis, things like that come out of his mouth. I believe, after being in your situation, that men are extreme sexual creatures. What works for some men doesn't work for others. I will tell you this, please for your sake DONT DO IT! It was extremely wierd and then after I never felt so dirty and cheap. I spoke with him about it and we both came to the conclusion that we need to be physical at least three times a week. It has really helped us, but remember that how they  feel is not going to just go away, just keep in close sommunication with each other and let him know that you don't want to do it. If he needs to see it, there is always videos. I know that my husband is still in love with me and I love him very much. You will be able to work through this. Be strong and stand your ground.|`|tEy9hvebaa	yes he can.<br>  <br>  especially if he feels he may not be satisfying her and wants to make sure she understand she can have whatever kind of sex she wants, that's just sex, but he doesn't want her to do it behind his back, or even worse have an affair and fall in love with the other guy|`|D3hYbsVJaa	First of all, you're not dumb, Scott is just a ho. If your husband has mentioned this three times or less, let it go. If it's more, he needs to realize this is just a fantasy, and if it happened it would pretty much suck.|`|jeCp0zWtaa	No, it is only psychologically possible to care about someone and have strong feelings of attraction if you've also had the concept that seeing them with someone else is painful driven into you successfully. Just as there is absolutely no way that you could possibly want something without wanting it all to yourself, there is no way a human could ever love someone without it going along with the fact that they'd be distraught of another person had sexual relations with them. Similarily, caring parents won't even think about a baby-sitter.<br>  Am I being a bit /too/ obvious?<br>  <br>  I was being sarcastic. I am personally monogamously inclined, but it's more along the lines of personal preference or tradition, there's no universal connection between giving a **** about someone and not seeing that as a valid way of "spicing things up". Now, if you're 100% monogamously inclined, um, tell him. Because then it's not valid beyond the realm of fantasy and such.|`|mcmOslOFaa	maybe he is bored and thinks this is another way to spice things up.  I honestly would tell him that it is not a good idea because you do not want this to affect the two of you later on.  Maybe watch a porn together and role play to add another advantage into the bedroom!!  I really think maybe he is just trying to be open with you and talking about his real fantasy, but it is unrealistic for a marriage and you marriage will fail if you two do this...so like I said add some spice!|`|aErUKUvVaa	Yes.  Men love it in general, particularly the other femal part.  The other guy part i'm not so sure about....  Women I know u see it differently, but men are pigs.  Face facts.|`|ieJwpnozaa	This is not love. That's just weird im not really a jealous guy but i  would never let my wife sleep with someone else that's just sick.|`|wp7vdcLCaa	If this bothers you so much then talk to him about it... If this doesn't make you happy then you should stop what isn't making you happy and replace it with something that does... Just be happy...|`|ITx2jZGkaa	that crazy, not in a million years would i let that happen, no

GGr0pKBZaa	A mans pride is a mans pride, and sometime you have to allow him to work through somethings as you already know. However, your position as the woman is to keep him encouraged and don't look for the reciprocation because eventually it will come out.  write him little notes from time to time, and put them in odd places like his shoe or under his pillow, or even the back pocket of a pair of jeans he's going to wear the next day... Be creative. your encouragement will help a lot. Be led by your gut ultimately.|`|85V6cHe4aa	A male friend of mine is going through the same thing and its very hard on him with this male pride thing,he has a fantastic girlfriend but feels very alone.<br>  <br>  I also try to support him because hes my friend but on a practical level there is very little you can do apart frm letting him know you are there when he needs you-my friend adores his girlfriend but tends to feel more pressured talking to her about it...i just say to him i am here if you need me and he calls if he does but as a woman i feel i just dont understand it.<br>  <br>  Maybe time to rally some of his male friends to cheer him up a bit?|`|GgBdQqrdaa	rim job does it for me|`|uNvF299Caa	He knows that you are in this together, but he is too proud.  Don't worry.  Tell him if he needs to talk, you're there, you'll listen.  Tell him that he can ask you anything, you'll be there.   And everyday, just call him, invite him to watch a movie together (his favorite type of movies), cook him something.  Just be yourself.  It's hard, but hang in there.  Good luck for him, I hope he gets a job soon.|`|riO929X4aa	Go to a romantic dinner or a movie or something, maybe that'll cheer him up :) Or maybe something like.. I'm not sure, but you should go out with him and do something special.|`|BjyXKFpRaa	just give him some space or even take him to a movie or some cause loosing your job is very stressful.|`|mABE76Dhaa	Try a threesome .

FUNhlpiqaa	Everyone makes mistakes.  The fact that you feel remorse is important in not letting it happen again.  You can only tell your mom you are sorry.  She still loves you and just want you to learn from this experience.  She might be a little hard on you while the situation is still fresh so you will never do it again.  <br>  <br>  If this is your worst of crimes... you are a good girl.  Especially these days.  <br>  <br>  xxoo|`|9nqVABVtaa	you are going to have to tell her you are very sorry and then tell her some things that are going on in your life. dont make it sound like you are trying to make it ok that you broke the law but do tell her that you are in a hard place right now. she loves you im sure and she will forgive you sooner or later, you just cant decide which one that is|`|AA11230809	never shoplift again, and dont worry, everyone makes mistakes. im sure your mom forgives you for doing that.|`|5MFBoWSAaa	Slowly earn back her trust by behaving and doing well in school. It takes a lot of time, trust me, but it's worth it.|`|du5MNrQ6aa	hahahah nice.|`|PV9YFZNmaa	well i don't think your mom is what you should worry about worry what the judge is going to do. you will have to pay a fine and pay for the item that was taken ask the judge if it is passable to be put on a community service detail in tell everything is paid in full then worry about what your mother is going to do. ask her if you can figure out your own punishment and be hard on your self like grounding a week for every 20 dollars it cost to pay the fine|`|OojlfDlBaa	I think you need to learn from your mistake, re-evaluate the people around you (friends) and have a long mature discussion with your mom. Remember: She may be angry with you but she will always love you no matter what.|`|HUcGxeSkaa	Tell her you're sorry and don't do it again. This should be enough proof. If she loves you she will trust you. We're all sinful by nature, but let this be a lesson. "Behold, your sin will find you out." Eventually we all have to pay for our wrong-doings.|`|bq8Dbscvaa	just do your best to earn her trust back like do what she tells you and always listen to her all the time|`|D9iE2JBKaa	oh, ummm ack really sad for a month with out talking and cry and stuff, then your mom will forgive you...............maybe|`|RplkclzJaa	get her a pair of earrings|`|CDBRXtnLaa	get her a pair of earings!<br>  also my older sister shopliftid its not that bad your gonna be in jail for at least a day then come back home and go to court at least twice a month and go to shoplifting classes teaching you to do the right thing every month

Otherwise get married at your reception venue, in a local park or garden, etc.
iqCwoiFXaa	I was in a kind of similar situation.<br>  What I did was just be really mean to him, and so then he asked (jokingly) why are you so mean, and I said, fine, I'll be supernice from now on. <br>  I pretty much just messed with him alot to get him to say that, and so from then on I was just nice and didn't make fun of him and stuff. So thats how I started.<br>  If you don't talk to him, you're just gonna have to use some retarded icebreaker or something.<br>  Haha, good luck!

qpmGLd7laa	If you honestly believe he's a threat to your safety, get a restraining order.  But, don't go to such extremes for some creepy loser who just likes you.

603831edd1ddf6cfe0beaaf123e071acaa	Yahoo! Chat has always been a very vulnerable tool to what is called a bot.  The bot is a program that someone creates to automatically respond to the victim no matter what you choose to reply with.  It is really identify-able by the immediate offer to see porno related material by clicking on a link that is underlined in blue text.  This is the hyperlink that will take you directly to the website the user wants you you see.  Be very aware that some hyperlinks can take you to portal websites that will either infect your computer with spy/adware or just make it very difficult to leave such material by having to battle a plethora of pop ups.  If the link is in the message from the sender, or even if all they say is something to the nature of..."nude pics, new pics, come and see me"  Then your significant other is the clear.|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	I would LEAVE HIM~!|`|1f5H6kfvaa	He's watching porn.

I understand loving someone but, it is not fair to you or him to not understand each other.The only hope you have now is to talk to him and explain how you feel. Maybe you can come to an understanding. You both owe it to each other to work together and an open line of communication is the best place to start. Good luck.|`|AA11996507	You are not wrong for believing that when both spouses work outside of the home, they should share the household chores between them.<br>  <br>  You are however wrong for not having discussed this before you got married and possibly made a different decision as to whether or not you should marry this particular guy.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Marriage and parenting is a two way street.  You're not super woman!  You work just as hard, if not harder than he does, he can't expect you to do everything at home.

You are not in a good relationship, if you can't tell him how you feel.  If 2 people work out of the home, then 2 people should do the household things.  If one stays home (no matter who) then it's that person's responsibilty.  It's only fair.  That's how it has always worked for us.  When we both worked, we both did EVERYTHING.  Now I stay at home and I do it.  He does help with the kids when he's at home, and lends a hand with things when I need it.  A marriage is two.  I have tried to tell my sister that for years.  She can't get her husband do anything when she works, and he's at home.|`|IbEuqbDxaa	i was married to an african but honestly he was the woman in the relationship but we held an understanding that it was always 100 percent from both of us regardless of who was working<br>  some times an ultimatum is appropriate <br>  let him knoww what is expected and put your foot down<br>  you have to be very strong and let him in on some fierceness that a woman has when she is being treaded unfairly<br>  tell him it time to get **** together and work and be a real family like you agreed to when you got married<br>  a womans work is what she wants it to be not wat another man beleives it should be <br>  you are grown just the same as him<br>  tell him if he is so grown then be a man and help out|`|KOjVWXOCaa	No sweetheart, you are not wrong its 50/50, well it should be. I also have that same problem, but I had to tell my husband to get off his a** and do something. My  husband and I work 3 12hr shifts 7pm-7am, we have three children (7yo, 4yo and 21mos) and we do not put them in daycare. My mother watch my children at night while we are working. Its tough when you are expected to do it all except for taking out the trash. He thinks if he takes out the trash and do the yard thats all he has to do. If you continue to do it all you will be too exhausted to enjoy life. Baby, tell him to back off, get off his a** and help do something. Tell him that if you have to be a housewife you should stop working and he get a second job. Don't let him send you to an early grave.|`|081168f28573ebfa7f89cf91f00a1e36aa	No it's not just your responsibilty!!

That's part of marriage here in the USA.  That makes him a man here.  Tell him how it is.  You shouldn't have to shoulder the whole responsibility of parenting and domestic issues.

Either talk to him or reverse it, meaning don't do anything like cook for him, don't do his laundry.|`|NCvX4I0baa	I think that you should try to talk about this with your husband. Tell him you'll try your best when you can but it would be nice if he could give you a hand. He's not the only one who's working for the family ..You're both in the army. I think that maybe he doesn't realize that it only works out for the wife to be a stay at home mom if she's at home 24/7 or close to. <br>  Maybe he will come to his senses and realize that he needs to respect you for what you do.

IIKwBSrxaa	You said it because you are secretly in love with her, but you're so confused you won't admit it.  So you insulted her to make her think you didn't love her, even though insulting her when she doesn't know you would make it pretty obvious you're trying to cover up the fact that you love her with an obscene gesture and comment, but you realize all of this half a second before you make the obscene gesture and comment, so you end up saying it in a very quiet voice, hoping she doesn't hear you.  She secretly does hear you and doesn't acknowledge it, because what she's really thinking is that you insulted her so she wouldn't have a clue that you love her, but you realized that insulting her would only make it known that you are trying to hide that you love her with something mean to say and that you realized you shouldn't say it right before you say it so you whispered it.  After she realizes all this, the girl you insulted understands that she loves you too.  She can't take her eyes away from your @$$.  And... let me tell you another secret that I shouldn't be telling you... I'm psychic.  And I can plainly see in my crystal ball the two of you, both wearing black wedding dresses with thigh-high leather boots, getting married by an unqualified priest who just so happens to be drunk just like you two in a Vegas chapel at two in the morning.|`|ZpR57jbBaa	i could help you if you told us what you said. i mean you couldve just said<br>  i eat dirt<br>  <br>  i mean what did you say|`|TNNSHdypaa	lol maybe you were so immersed in the "gross stuff" you were thinking about that you didn't realize what you were doing.|`|Ti1xO4GDaa	lol dont worry!! weird stuff like that happens sometimes :P thinking out loud, totally not a big deal .dont sweat the small stuff =]|`|du5MNrQ6aa	because you're a pervert.|`|bmu6uhQ3aa	Maybe you think out loud?|`|ZBnvveT3aa	let me know what you said and it could help more... anywasy if you want to say it private email me yungboss12castillo@yahoo.com just let me know who you are.|`|x9EyB6ojaa	**** IF I KNOW LOL|`|kFOxlebDaa	I catch my self thinking out loud all the time.<br>  Lol its normal|`|ceVb8qdNaa	what did you say?
iVmSh1iVaa	OK first of all....LOL, you're like me...you compare yourself with everyone else....BAD habit to get into...take it from an old bag who is 38 and a big horn dog...I gripe and compare me and my husband's cr@ppy sex life to everyone else and it brings me nothing but grief.... The best advice I can give is to be happy with what you DO have, and you will continue to get more in life...versus griping about it...trust me you will get less in life....<br>  <br>  Honestly, from what I have heard couples in their 20's do have sex more often...but hey your partner may just have a low sex drive. High stress can cause it, and people in their mid 20's are under a lot of stress...with getting their lives started...breaking away from parents and so forth...the best suggestion I can give is to communicate...and let your partner know you are happy with what you have you would just like to see it improve because you are turned on by him....good luck sis!|`|OlS4uijKaa	I agree that you should not compare yourself to everyone else. I am 26, been married 7 years and we have sex about 3 times a week, sometimes more, sometimes less. But I am very satisfied with it. I know some have more sex than I do and some have less, but that is them.  If you are being taken care of then you need to let him know. In almost every relationship one of the people wants more sex than the other. You have to work it out and meet in the middle. Talk to your man and tell him what you expect from him and find out what he expects from you.  A lot of times if you are nonconfronting about it you will find out the real reasons behind why he doesn't want to do it. Try acting out some of his fantasies so that he can get more into it. I guarantee that after some open communication and some serious foreplay, everyone will be a lot happier!|`|VaGUYYIHaa	When I was 21 I was in a relationship with a man 19 years older and we did as much as we could and certainly way more than 1-3 times a month.  That relationship lasted over 10 years.  It was so that I discovered that sex is not the most important thing in a relationship, but still it is very important, and so if you are not happy with the frequency you are experiencing then you need to talk to him and both of you should compromise to meet the other at the very least halfway.|`|jdcexBKfaa	talk to him about it, tell him how u feel and that ur not satisfied, maybe its getting boring and u need to spice it up a bit, when he comes from work let him c u in a sexy outfit with heels on and make up, or dance for him and be his fantasy, try to be creative, im sure that will give u more hits a month|`|rX4ti0Nsaa	yes having sex 1-3 times a month is normal at your age.  but you should try it a few times a week with each other, too.  so you dont have to go outside the marriage 1 to 3 times a month.|`|du5MNrQ6aa	well i'm married, i'm 21, and my husband is 23, we have sex just about everyday... and we've been together four years, married for two.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	i dont have sex,my husband is deployed,we have not had sex in 9 months,and we still wont for another 5 months!!<br>  <br>  if you both work i think a few times a week is good,like every other day.|`|J7GTIE5raa	WOW i feel sorry for you two.  me and my hubby are almost 30 and been together for 12 years married for 8. We have sex 3-4 times a day, 5-6 days a week. We get a lot of quickies in but good long love making as well.|`|p8yphpjYaa	Ah, kindred spirit! I would LOVE to have sex at least 3 times a week, but end up in the same boat as you. Believe me, I try. My husband knows that anytime he wants it, he's pretty much guaranteed to get it. I think I've told him no once? His sex drive is much lower than mine, which can be very disappointing and frustrating. We are 30 and 32.|`|djUMvICoaa	I would suggest you invest in a little pocket rocket, those little things that go buzz and learn how to use it because you are going to wear this guy out the way you're going, but it's a great little fill-in in between.|`|lMbYgBtQaa	im 21 and my wife is 24 and we have sex at least 4 times a week. Have you tried getting it and he doesnt want to or what? cause sometimes you have to try also|`|5GPDrBPLaa	I would say at least once a week, minimum.  Then again, everyone is different, so it really depends.
ztxkW7WKaa	Im sorry but i dont think if he was.<br>  If he was really into u he would have made u his official girl.<br>  U cant settle for half as.s relationships. U should have asked him r u his girl or not.<br>  He was just playing u i think. i dont want to get too personal but were u two hooking up too??<br>  and if u  were then yea he definitely just used u until he got what he wanted. and a relationship is obviously not what he wanted, or else u would have been called his girlfirend and he wouldnt have been seeing other girls|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Kissing isn't everything. How did he treat you otherwise? He was dating another girls, so obviously not great. Just move on as hard as that is.<br>  There's nicer guys out there. You're young and will meet lots of guys before you pick one. Hay in there!|`|StJGeiFyaa	i can't imagine that there was a point in the relationship that he wasn't into you: because he stayed with you. when he was done with you, he moved on. i know that's a harsh way to put it, i'm sorry. <br>  <br>  even if he WAS into you, he's just not that into you now. move on, girl, and find a hotter one to take his place.|`|n09TKFj9aa	Maybe at the beginning when he first started dating you he was into you. When we got his other girlfriend, that probably ended. I mean like, why would he get another girlfriend if he was still into you?<br>  Those kind of guys aren't worth it. The only think that you can do now is move on and learn.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well him dating someone else shows that he was slowly losing interest in you. So he may have either been into you and then gotten bored with you or he could of been trying to be a player and act like he can date multiple girls, so he can look cool.|`|AA11310052	if he really liked you he wouldnt have been with that other girl. he just wanted to fool around with the both of you. sorry|`|IbEuqbDxaa	first off he probably was but is just not the person for real commitment and wanted to end you and him before he had to stay attatched<br>  him having another woman was probably testing himself to see what he really wanted to do be a bachelor or a commited man<br>  he is very shallow for leading you on and its time for you to move on <br>  he may have just enjoyed that friends with benifits thing its best to let it go and find one that is not conceited and a total idiot|`|bq8Dbscvaa	wow that's a long time not going to lie and i really think he was into you but then there is always going to be another girl that is going to stand out more then you sometimes but i think he was really into you but i don't know how you can trust him.<br>  <br>  <br>  And please answer my question<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Anj2rWyvhtmQ1u3PHcUYFnfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307191244AAN8TDs">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|5H64mGX1aa	he was, but he was just playing you.<br>  and now hes lost interest and is moving on...<br>  wat can u do...<br>  get bak out there and find someone hotter for revenge girl!<br>  good luck!|`|Juio2N24aa	he was obviously into u the problem is he wasn't into only u, move on he doesn't know what he wants and its a waste of your time.|`|L3wJDWFWaa	i think he was js into you on a realli shallow level and nvr planned to take things much further|`|F4fjT1bLaa	wtf is dat?|`|L1EnPN67aa	Yeah, he probably liked you but if you guys weren't official, then I think we both know that it wasn't really intended to be a long time thing. Especially if it's 11-12 months AND he was with another girl "talking" to her too. <br>  <br>  Trust me, I've been there, but don't waste your time asking if he was really into you, he was into you in a way that apparently wasn't very deeply emotionally. Like in a "in love" type of way.<br>  <br>  It's better to just be real friends with a male anyways and if you want to get involved in a different way, then at least you can say you genuinely liked or cared for them more than just physically.|`|iko1uqBnaa	Hate to say this but I will cause I had it done to me and demanded answers from every guy I knew. the basics are if he wanted to date you he would have asked the fact that he did ask someone else means it wasn't any personal issues he had basically he used you cause you were available when he wanted you and let me guess you didn't bug him when he didn't want to hang out with you. You deserve much much better than that but don't change the way you are cause there is someone out there who will appreciate you just cause he was a jerk and a user has nothing to do with you if you weren't cool he never would have stuck around so long.|`|IbSwlGsiaa	Well this is something that you need to know.  He was into you but not in the right kind of way.  Take this advice from someone who will give it to you straight.  You can not measure a mans love by the physical connection that you have.  First of all respect and love yourself first, if you were never officially dating he was never your guy.  You were in the relationship by yourself, because he was doing his thing with you and someone else.  You went wrong by sleeping with him with no commitment.  Babygirl you are young, and you deserve so much better than that. let me tell you a secret; the longer you make them wait, the better they'll treat you.  hard lesson to learn, but from woman to woman, Pick your head up, put your sexy on and get ready for Summer  cause trust me the brothers have been working out all winter long. And I know at 18,  you can take your pick. lol  keep ur head up.
mFDeVvj2aa	Thats kinda the same situation im in. the guy is just busy nd he's probably shy. Sorry to brake it to u, but maybe he just doesnt like u. u should take things slow and talk to him. nd get to know him a little better. then askk him to sadie's again|`|ztxkW7WKaa	give it up... he's just stalling. he's just not into u. sorry|`|HtUhb3fXaa	THAT means that either he doesn't really like you and doesn't want to be mean and flatout say no, or he wants to see if anyone else asks him that he may like better. Sorry, just trying to be honest.|`|F4fjT1bLaa	wtf is dat?|`|JCZ2oqZGaa	go out wif another guy...guys like the chase no?
fuia2Z6Maa	he is trying to forget u and trying to start hating u... which is not possible for him
UBdt4Wm0aa	You're both complicating things way too much. Both of you need to lighten up, lower your expectations of marriage and not take yourselves and life so seriously. Remember how it was when you were dating and do everything you can to recapture some of those moments and create new and exciting memories. If you keep it fresh and new, there's no reason to have mixed emotions about being married. <br>  <br>  You're always going to have down moments now and then, finances to worry about from time to time and everyday stresses from a number of things that can pop up (regardless if married or not)...but I can tell you after 23 years of marriage that the good outweighs the bad so long as you are both committed and refuse to give up on one another, have common goals, trust for each other and realistic expectations. <br>  <br>  If you feel it's necessary to go to counseling together, go for it. It never hurts to learn how to communicate effectively since that's one of the most important factors in any relationship, married or not.|`|0d22uiaaaa	He sounds to me like he might be getting a kick out of having some sort of control over you because you love him. The next time he said that I would tell him that you don't enjoy him saying that and if he keeps it up you can find a way to make it happen. Be ready to back it up. Just because you love him doesn't mean that you will be happily married. It takes two. I have left men that I still loved because they turned out to be a sorry sack of s---. I have never regreted it.|`|EJMwqU3caa	Marriage is work.  If you're not both willing to work on it, then there is no marriage.  I don't know how big of a reader you are, but a few books that have helped my marriage are:<br>  "The Five Love Languages" <br>  "10 Steps to a Lasting Marriage"<br>  "Marriage Takes More than Love"<br>  I'm sorry I can't remember the authors names, but there is some great advise in all of them.  Couseling is always a good option, a 3rd party may be able to help you and your spouse find the rout of the problem...<br>  Good Luck!|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	Gawd, men are at their best when they are solid, confident leaders of their family.  His waffling undermines all of that.  To hear him talk this way, it makes you wonder if he'll just leave someday, I bet.  My advice is to get in his face and tell him that you and your kids (or future kids) need a man they can count on, to be there and protect them and raise them.  Tell him if he can't be that man, let you know now so you can make future plans.  Don't be afraid to be blunt like this - a lot rides on his attitude.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	No, that's not normal. If you guys didn't do pre-marital counseling, it might be a good idea now.
lUhuGyOAaa	well if you really love her then forget wat your parents say and wat do u mean when you said they think that u deserve better is she ugly or somethin??|`|7pxJdyRcaa	Remember, you will always have your parents and most likely you will have  many girl friends before you marry.  Being abusive is a trait which She will not get over and you really don't need that do you?
OojlfDlBaa	As far as your mom being overprotective, you may not see it now but she is only doing this so you don't end up in a life you don't want. My parents never really protected me from life. I ended up being a high school drop out and cocaine addict. When I was 18 I got pregnant with my son. I got clean from drugs when I got pregnant but now I'm 22 years old and a stay at home mom with a 3 year old and a 2 month old. I am married now but I look back on my life and I regret a lot of things I did. A lot of the time I am depressed with my life because I always wanted to do so much more and I know it will be a huge challenge to accomplish those things and really it just seems hopeless. She doesn't want you to be like that. A lot of people think, "oh that won't happen to me!" but the truth is, it can happen to anyone at anytime, even you.<br>  <br>  If you want to go out and be with your friends then talk with her. See how she feels and heck, even let her know you've tried to get some adivce on how to talk with her. Don't ever be secretive with her if she does allow you to go out. Hope this helps.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	Good for your mom, she should be overprotective.|`|akIpddDSaa	13.....highschool!?!?!? wtf man.|`|XrtmT2kUaa	Okay you are 13.You don't date or go out by yourself friends without parents. There are so many things that can happen to a young girl. I say good for mom, She is doing what a lot of kids need these days. Give her a break.You need to enjoy being young because one day you will be grown with lots of responsibility...|`|gWFB8kVraa	Bottom line she doesnt want you to get pregnant.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	This is going to be hard, but you seem really exceptional and I think you might be able to handle it.  Go to your Mom and Dad and say that you understand why they've been turning you down on your requests to go to the mall with friends, but you would like to know how old you will have to be before you can go.  Be polite and don't lose your temper, no matter how they answer you.  If they say they don't know, tell them that you'd appreciate them giving it some thought and you'll check back with them in a week and ask if that sounds reasonable.  Being mature about hearing their answer is key in getting your way.<br>  <br>  If they tell you that they think the mall is a bad place for kids to hang out, ask them if there was a place where they used to hang out.  Then tell them that things have changed and this is where kids go now.  Again, remaining calm is key.<br>  <br>  Just do your best to both understand and to give your opinion calmly.<br>  <br>  As far as the dating is concerned, what you said is a really good way to open the dialog.  Dating at your age is usually a lot less formal a situation with more pairing off at school events than anything.  Anyway, you're likely to have a phone romance for a while and that's when you'll want to talk to your mom about it.  Ask the guy over for dinner or to watch a DVD.  If your parents see that you're not hiding him, they'll be put at ease, so ask him to hang with you at home.  From there on, going out alone will be no problem, I guarantee.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|MlCWsBcwaa	Well, I think if your mom is very protective, trying to go out AND wear make-up to school at the same time AND going out on dates on your own might be asking a bit much.  Start slowly and earn and build on trust (and be willing to be a bit patient).<br>  <br>  Make-up: I think you are too young to need to wear make up, really.  Especially every day like to school.  The boys won't care about it (and it fact probably think it is silly).  I would ask your mom about make-up and get her to teach you about it a bit at a time.  Maybe start with good skin care including sun cream and lip gloss.  It is not necessary to wear mascara at your age (your eyes are beautiful as they are, you are not old enough to need it (really, despite what your friends might think) and besides, if you get a bit teary for some reason, you can end up with major panda eyes).<br>  <br>  Mall: Do your friends come over and see you too, or do they just go out without you?  I hope they do.  Maybe you could find a relative that is old enough to keep an eye on you that your mom would trust (e.g. older brother or sister, cousin, neighbour etc).  Maybe you could get her to let you go for a few hours if you call her every hour or so and she drops you off and picks you up. Start small and earn her trust.  I think you are old enough to be allowed to do that a bit.  Has your mom explained why you are not allowed to go to the mall without supervision.  Maybe some bad things have happened to kids before in your area or something like that.<br>  <br>  Boyfriend: at your age, having a boyfriend should not be such a big deal (in terms of dates, what you do etc), and not the same as older teenagers - what I mean is it is really just another friend, not much more than that at all (you are pretty young).  I think you are right about spending time with him at home first so your mom can trust him.  Maybe it might help if she meets his parents too.  I would start by trying to talk about it first as if she is protective, just springing it on her might be an automatic no.  Also, even though it might seem a bit uncomfortable to talk to your mom, she was a girl once, and might appreciate talking to you about boys and dating before it starts to happen.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|kMoC5dJ1aa	lol your mom is just not ready for you to be a teen. All you have to do is say that her actions are making you unhappy. But when you tell her say it sincerely, and look upset. and you need to say " mom i know you are just trying to protect me from being hurt" and add how you feel. works every Time|`|lUhuGyOAaa	well ask her if you can sit down and tlk and then just say mom i am growing up and i need some space because your hogging my life and controllliing me<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  but take it easy on her and that is a good idea to let her meet him forst that way she could feel more safe|`|ogVAkWT3aa	ur 13.....|`|1oKardRKaa	here's the deal! i know exactly what you are going through because i myself went thru it.  i know how it feels for your parents not to let you do anything. and for sure you will be upset because you will start loosing friends and mainly start thinking that your life is pretty boring just the fact that you can do anything about it.  in most cases, parents that are like this to their kids thier kids will end up doing anything they want behind their parents back. even if it means to have a boyfriend in school and not to go out with then outside of school. if you feel like you are wanting to be with your friends and your parents dont let you go out bring them to you, let them hang around with you at your house, so like this your parents will see who your friends are and how u act around them.  this really helped me wen i was growing up.  but just the fact that your are 13 dosent give you all the privileged to do anything you want. you have to show your parents that you are responsible and that you are able to take care of yourself. eventually they will start gaining trust in you. the key word here is trust. now, about the boyfriend thing, although you are still young most girls at your age will end up going out with a guy at school whether your parents know or dont know. i suggest that you just talk to your mom and let her know whats going on. tell her that theres this kid at school that he likes you and all that stuff. talk to your mom as a best friend of yours, but dont give out so much details, i mean you wouldnt want for your mom to find out about your whole life at school. just be normal. maybe if you guys do end up being together you can invite him to dinner at your house or so. its always best to talk to your parents first to get their approval. after all they are the one with the rules around the house. talk to your mom on when she had her first boyfriend and try to relate to her. your mom is your best friend and she knows whats up. well i hope this helps!!!!!
x7mtcya1aa	i think you should wait untill he has graduated. i understand where your husband is coming from when he says that hes not in the right mindset to work on your marriage yet, however thats really an aweful way for someone to be. the angry side of me would make him resolve his feeling and intentions now and not let him leave you hanging, but if you do that, the chances of the result being something good and constructive is way less. so if you wait... there are 2 possible outcomes::<br>  -your husband after a long while of being stuck in his own little world, without thinking of you and the state of your relationship, he is finished with school, and has more time to spend with you. but where are you? living under a different roof, and pissed. so he will ...<br>  1) come to the conclusion that he really has fallen out of love with you, and wants to move on. or<br>  2) realize that he would be so completely miserable without you, and now that he knows that, and is willing to change himself a bit to make things work, he will appreciate you even more.<br>  <br>  -i also agree with dan... this behavior is very childish|`|9cf23c09de792ddcc3862acdd45d9e36aa	it sounds like he has some big time issues.There's no way your marriage could work without some counseling.If he's going to cheat on you there's no reason to try and work it out unless he stops- in my humble opinion.If the kids are ok so far that's a good thing.Good luck to you!|`|Gl20z152aa	Adultery is serious business.

He cheated on you "out of pure anger towards you"? And now he's angry because you got a job and moved out? <br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but your husband is an immature, irresponsible, inconsiderate creep, and you can do a zillion times better than him. It amazes me the sleazy way that adulterers justify their cheating ways, "It was all my wife/husband's fault that I screwed that other person". (If you are interested, take a look at Greg Norman's recent comments on his marriage break up, he and your husband would get on like a house on fire). <br>  <br>  Your husband will NEVER be ready to work on your marriage, he will come up with excuse after excuse when he graduates. And, even if he did want to "work on it", why would you want him back after he cheated on you? <br>  <br>  The only positive thing I can say about him is that he owned up to his cheating, and hasn't condemned you to a life of deception. Other than that, you're wasting your time with him. Once a cheat, always a cheat. You can never trust him again, and it's time you found yourself someone you can trust. God bless!|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	You both, separate and together, need to see a marriage counsellor. Unless he is willing to get honest with himself, he's not going to be honest with you.<br>  <br>  I can understand his wanting to get his education done without distraction, but isn't an affair a distraction? I think he's making excuses and I also think he's very confused. I would suggest you give him his space until he graduates or is done classes, then you suggest counselling for him, yourself, and as a couple.<br>  <br>  I can't even begin to imagine what his intentions are as he sounds like he's on an emotional roller coaster.<br>  <br>  Encourage and support him to get his education and a good paying job. It will come in handy if you need to ask for child support.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Since lots of people will tell you all about him, I won't.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself who was pushing who away, or was it both of you? If he's up and down about his feelings, you know what they are, you just aren't getting the answer to make it all his fault are you? You push him away and wonder why he cheated. You pushed more and you wonder why he leaves so willingly.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	I think you should take your time and figure out what YOU want.  You have no obligation to sit and wait and be there for him, and you have a right to a little selfishness now.  You should look ahead, to your future, and try to figure out if your best, happiest path includes this man or not.  Take care.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	He's YOUR HUSBAND...you're supposed to know him better than we do!|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Ronni, it sounds as though you have married a child. He still has not figured out what he wants, even though he has sired two children. It is not long until May, and I suggest that if nothing has happened by the time he graduates, you file for divorce. It will take some time, and by the time you get it  going, he will have either made up his mind as to what he wants, or will have a new job with his degree. Since he will be making more money, you will be able to get more child support and alimony from him. <br>  <br>  I wish you well.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan|`|DQkDQraOaa	Personally, I wouldn't wait around to see IF he will want you back when he is ready to decide. What kind of an answer is that? He's lucky that YOU would take HIM back after what he did. He sounds very self-centered, selfish, and immature.|`|gwTLvop6aa	just give it time and talk to him about his anger towards you|`|1s2LSgqPaa	it isn't worth it divorce!|`|jHWEEZmCaa	to hell with him|`|40b38b62d7defc90cd285a9a06a65e69aa	It's probably a waste of time, but it is hard to let go of someone you love no matter what they have done, especially when kids are involved.  I always belive in trying to work things out when you have kids just for their sake.  However, he doesn't seem like he wants to fool with fixing your relationship, which should be more important than school.  But maybe he is just trying to get his career in order so your future together can be more stable.  Just wait until after he is finished with school.  You don't have anything else to loose, even if it is a waste of time.  It won't hurt to try.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Sounds like you both want to make it work, but neither of you have the skills to recover from the damage that's been done.  I think it would be a good idea to try some couples counseling - most schools offer it for free to their students.  If counseling isn't an option, you could try gradually talking things out until you two are on good standing again, then try out living together.|`|djUMvICoaa	That's not a good history at all.  You say you have two kids, did they come before the marriage or after?  Did he feel pressured into marrying you?  If so he ended up feeling trapped, that he wasn't ready to settle down and now this is him acting out.  If it wasn't about having to get married, he might be feeling the pressure of school, but that's no reason to cheat.  If that was a good reason the whole world would be out there doing it.  But with him saying what he said about divorce is one good indicator of where he really is.  Even in a heated discussion you don't throw around stuff that isn't true, it is.  He may have been sorry for having said it but in his heart of hearts it was true.  So do what you must, but I would advise you to move on and find someone who won't go running around at the drop of a hat.  The last thing is do you think you could ever trust him after that?|`|qs9QHvy9aa	It sounds like hes not into the relationship at all.  Going only by the information here, I'd start moving on if I were you.  <br>  <br>  There are three sides to every story however, your side, his side, and the real story.  The third side almost never comes out.  <br>  <br>  From Your side, it looks like your convenient, he already has you and therefor there's no reason to put any work into it.  He was angry about you leaving, because either he can except that you're going to be gone, or he'll have to work to be with someone else, or the third option, he can just be alone which honestly no one really likes.  Hes a lazy lover.  Until he straitens out his own priorities about having a relationship I'd consider this over.  Because, it sounds like hes not going to come around.
OojlfDlBaa	He probably 1. doesn't know how to approach the subject without embarrassing you and himself or 2. He understands the sexual changes that teens go through and would rather you look at porn than go out and actually do something of the sort.|`|GkH5NoFyaa	Don't say anything about it.

You should ask if he saw what you were looking at and talk about it.
U5dCFomCaa	haha the question sounds pretty funny. well i think it shouldn't matter whether he was "hott" or not, but someone you really liked. anyways, he's gonna stay on your mind for a very long time. maybe you'll start falling for someone else. haha idk. anything can happen. just try to find funny people or something. talk to people you haven't talked to before and you may learn something new about them and yourself. you'll find yourself thinking about him but you will not feel that way forever|`|GOwVCwdsaa	their are plenty of other hot guys out there|`|OEATSehSaa	find some other hot guy|`|j2hvbwLQaa	Find a new guy to focus your attention on ;)|`|synqEKEaaa	try and have a girls day.

C8DOT8Y7aa	Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. <br>  Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  <br>  <br>  His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually. <br>  Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company. <br>  Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you, unless he's a bit of a "playboy" who flirts with a lot of girls. See if he uses any of the tricks in How to Touch a Girl, and see if he uses them more with you than with anyone else. <br>  Watch his actions around other girls and see if he treats you differently. Some guys flirt with other girls to get your attention. It gives them a chance to see your reaction. It helps them know if you really do like them or not. The way you can tell that they are trying to make you jealous is that they find little times when they're flirting with the other girl to look at you. His eyes will flick over and look at you. Another sign is that when you leave, he stops flirting with the other girl. That will be a harder one to pick up on, but you can have a friend look for you or something like that. You have to be sneaky sometimes to find out if a guy likes you. <br>  Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well. <br>  Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. <br>  Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't?|`|A3Rq88Qmaa	ah can't beat Live 4 Life Cena, but I think he's got it right on the money (:|`|F4fjT1bLaa	flirt
IbEuqbDxaa	it depends on the state that you got married in<br>  most states the oldest age of consent is 18 but if you are really unsure call the county clerks office where you were married at and ask them<br>  i'm sure they would not have let you marry if you were to young<br>  i was married at 18 in illinois and there was no need for parental consent|`|J7GTIE5raa	you have to be 18 without parents consent|`|naequcqlaa	I believe 18 is legal age, & you would be free to do as you wish.  A simple phone call to your local court house would give you the info you need to  know tho.  Just please make sure you DO want to marry at this young age tho.  You've barely gotten dating out of your system at your age.  oh i know TOO WELL you cannot tell anyone what to do.  I can speak from experience tho, I got married just after I turned 19, he was 22.  BUT, neither of us had had the opportunity to date enuf others to be honestly sure enuf to know.  NO, we did NOT "jave" o get married, but nonetheless had our first child a little over a yr.later, another one 16 mons. later.  Needless to say, this marriage lased just under 5 yrs.  We BOTH made a mistake.  Who suffered?  Yes, the two children did.  I again married after that, had another child 7 yrs. later by that husband.  Needless to say, that marriage too did not last.  I then was an active alcoholic & kept meeting & marrying the wrong men,  Unfortunately, now 3 children suffered because of my mistakes!  I now have een sober 18+ yrs., my children are grown ups, but by my actions they all DID suffer because of it.  This I learned thru countless AA mtgs. & one on one counseling.  Unfortunateluit's just too late to riteeeee ALL MY WRONGS!  I now howeer am available for all 3 of them & have beentold MANY TIMES just how glad they are to have their mother back again...so am I!  So, above ALL ELSE, just MAKE SURE you're doing it for ALL the rite reasons as if it's meant to be,it w'be, regrdless as to how long you do have to wait.  Far better safe than sorry.  Seems to be just TOO FAR easy to get married, BUT not as easy to "un do it...The best to you>>>::)|`|ByTmzw8Taa	i'm pretty that if you are over 18 years old you can get married without your parents consent. why? are you planning on doing that??? *i put on my curious face*|`|dlGZebDmaa	Are you you want to get married at such young age?

Like so many others have said at 18 (in most states) you are a legal adult and your parents can't do anything about it.  Go the the Court House in your County and go to the County Clerk.  If you go about it the right way and sign all the forms that are required, it will still be legal and valid.  Just a word of adivce...You should always discuss you wanting to get married with your parents.  You don't want to burn the bridges so to speak.  Hope this is what you wanted to hear.|`|oB4KxwuJaa	You are adults. You don't need any consent.

qIVy4eloaa	maybe she have problems. talk to her and try to solve it. there's nothing wrong with talking personally as long as she agrees that you help her. show her what life truly is, give her reasons to change. Cheer her up and always be by her side. if you have time, talk to her more often, she need a friend. she needs someone she can lean on.|`|ySP23xTtaa	Wow...I didn't think Wisconsin was like that...<br>  I think you should tell her about the good things you're doing and how happy it makes you that you're doing the right thing. Maybe you could say it casually not like you're trying to sound all goody goody...she's probably just insecure and she thinks doing the bad things the other kids will help her feel better about herself. Hopefully she'll want to be happy like you and start doing the right things. I hope that helps a little.
q84KT11saa	Depending on the amount of people you are having you could consider having the reception at your home (if your home is not large enough then a friend/relatives home).  This would save you some money and you could make it a very warm/close celebration.  If you don't mind spending some money, other options would be having it at a hall.  If you know someone, or live in a condo they usually have a "party room" which costs very little and is designed around entertaining.  <br>  <br>  Depending on the amount of people you have you could consider doing the following:<br>  <br>  o Having the reception in your home or at a friends home if yours is not large enough.<br>  <br>  o Most condos/townhouse/apartments have a "party room" and are usually very classy and inexpensive.<br>  <br>  o Depending on the type of celebration you are having after, you can have friends/family/yourself make the food which saves having it catered<br>  <br>  o For photos you can hire a young photographer fresh out of school or starting out . . . they do not charge a lot and they usually do a good job . .if your unsure have them provide a portfolio<br>  <br>  o Depending on the amount of people you have and if you want, you can scrap the whole reception and go to a nice restaurant.  Saves on the clean up.<br>  <br>  o For wedding favors you can usually find a decent shop that does engraving which typically has inexpensive items, and of good quality.  Things like lighters, pocket watches, key chains, pens, etc. with your name and date engraved into them.  <br>  <br>  Hope you find this helpful.

MLFtMnvOaa	If you guys were in a good relationship just relax I'm sure she still cares about you. Don't pressure her and let her just live her life for the moment. If you ever do see a clearing where she's single or something just (if you're comfortable enough) ask her if she ever thinks about "the good ol' days" when you guys were together. Bring up something funny from your relationship, hang out with her alone but don't try and make any moves. If you keep bringing up the good times it'll make her remanice and soon you'll be in the clear to ask her out, even on a date or something at first.

I would consider that flirting and I bet you'll two be dating (if you want to) in no time!|`|A3ZXYbOTaa	Lol, that's cute! Yeah, i think it may be flirting, but it really depends on what you think about it.<br>  Lol, if you want to go out with him now instead of waiting for him to ask you out, then ask him out first, that rarely happens and might take him by suprise...XD|`|n8b48Nvvaa	if ur in middle school that " he picks on u cuz he likes u" rule shouldnt apply but here i guess it does.
azE51WGRaa	Honey, if it was true love, your man would accept your faults and embrace the real you instead of throwing hurtful, untrue accusations up in your face every time you argue.

Sometimes the truth come out of a person when they are angry.|`|B359bLqsaa	Those are not the kinds of things you say to your wife!  I understand people say things when they are angry.  I say things about my husband too when I'm angry, but I dont say those kinds of things.  I think he has absolutely no respect for you.  I would not forgive my husband if she totally insulted me to my face like that.  That is not true love, and I cant believe you even asked.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	If its a heated argument, you were slinging stuff back at him. Whyyd id you trap him with someone who has to lie about what they do?<br>  <br>  I love how everyone just assumes it's all  his fault. Probably Lifetime producers.
wck4MHREaa	"Fat" is noticeably overweight. You know, you can see their rolls over their jeans, or they have "cankles". You're smart, I'm sure you can tell the difference between a fat woman and a skinny one.<br>  <br>   I really shouldn't be so picky, considering I'm "fat" as well (like 15 pounds overweight- but I used to be around 50 lbs overweight, so I'm happy with myself), but I can't help it- I'm attractive to dainty, petite women. That's just who I am, and those are my preferences, but I do know guys that love "thick" women, so that's out there for anyone who feels unappreciated because of their weight.
1YdeUn1Caa	If your parents smoke, use that to your advantage. Tell them they taught you. It's hard for a parent to punish when they smoke themselves.<br>  If they don't. Tough break.|`|G1fDp1PEaa	Do not smoke, it is not cool. You are setting yourself up for lung cancer in the not so distant future. The punishment does not matter, I'm sure your parents just want you to have healthy lungs...|`|MVY8xhXlaa	I would take you to a hospital ward where people are dying of lung cancer (that's your future).|`|qj2KzBDFaa	to me, i will not punish them because they are over 18, they know how to think what good and bad for them.<br>  but i will not give them money to buy smoking stuffs, they have to use their own money|`|db4310b357e8b8155cfe1bd956cf7660aa	When my father found my smokes, i was made to smoke the whole entire pack , one right after the other. It sure taught me a lesson. I'll never do that again. I wait at least two minutes between them.|`|bgLQYEAIaa	Give you a fresh pack and a lighter, then make you smoke every one of them in a row.<br>  That will stop you from smoking!<br>  Stupid habit.....|`|MlCWsBcwaa	If you are using cigarettes at your age to calm you down, maybe you should reconsider whether you are addicted or not. Nicotine is a drug and you are relying on it already a bit.  I think you need to stop now while it is easy enough to do.  If you are stressed, maybe you should tell your folks that so they can help you find ways to reduce the stress and better ways to deal with it e.g. sport/exercise.  If it wasn't considered child abuse, I would make the kid smoke the cigarettes, one after the other.  If they weren't sick by the end of the packet, then get them another one until they can't take it physically any more.  Alternatively, I would cut all pocket money (actually buy the things they need rather than give them the money to do it), ground them and make them earn my trust again.  Good luck, I hope this leads to you giving up smoking.  The odds of it not stuffing your body and health up and costing you a lot of money are not worth it.  And, without knowing your folks, I would say the punishment might be more about getting you to stop smoking than being a fair thing for that crime.|`|cOce5YbRaa	I found out my 13 now 14 year old daughter was smoking. I am a smoker myself. I talked to her and told her I wish she wouldn't smoke because once you get hooked it is so very hard to quit. I have tried to quit several times. That's what I did when I found out the first time-I simply talked to her. She continued so I grounded her for a week. This still didn't work so we now let her smoke. We don't like it and wish she wouldn't, but she is going to anyway so I much rather her do it than hide things from me. We have a good relationship-Mom and Daughter-and talk about just about everything and I don't want that to be destroyed. So if she wants to smoke for now, she's going to smoke. She doesn't smoke in the house in front of us though. She goes outside.|`|nEn6EPuqaa	if you're 18 then I say no punishment. But if you live with them and smoke around the house (which you dont), it would be fair to punish them. I think death by the guillotine sounds fair dont you?<br>  <br>  smoking is pretty unattractive btw, smells bad. I don't hold anything against people who do cuz I also do very rarely, but it does smell bad :P<br>  <br>  there are plenty of healthy ways to reduce stresss. Excercise, stretching, yoga, tai chi, meditation, prayer, playing an instrument, drawing (my favorite :)  ), writting. yahoo answers maybe :P     <br>  <br>  find a fun alternative. Over the past four years i've picked up countless hobbies and now I'm so much better at them! it's so cool|`|e7KoyoWsaa	Well, if it were me, I would show my firm disaproval, but no punishment... if there is a rule that your not allowed to smoke then thats diffrent.  I would be more worried that they are hiding things from me.  Whats the next think I'll find?  Condom?  Birth Control? Pot?   If we're upfront about this stuff and parents act reasonably then a teenager will reflect on that.|`|31Y7QUmkaa	lung cancer<br>  <br>  you parents should just say that you were wrong and ground you. you really hurt them im sure. just consider that and please stop|`|LVarIBqkaa	my friends parents caught her smoking and they made her smoke five packs straight and now she hates them. soo idk if thats fair, but its effictive|`|Nw6DbfCcaa	I don't think punishment is called for at all.|`|zXfA7yYoaa	i would make him/her smoke the whole pack until he/she threw up.|`|yvugbHpRaa	When my dad was a kid, my grandfather found cigarettes in his room and made my dad eat what was left in the pack.<br>  <br>  My dad doesn't smoke, so I guess it worked. ha.|`|USsjb7YLaa	Never giving them money if they want to smoke they go to make there own money for them|`|J6o0ZYAHaa	make them eat the whole pack

oRQQRGlVaa	I agree with everyone because things are really tough.  Times were different and it isn't something that has just started.  There was a time where households could live on one income and then two incomes were needed.  I want to comment on your question as well as some of the people that answered.  My husband and I live on one income, a factory workers income.  We own a home and have two children and two dogs.  We are trying to start up a business but have no start up money, so that makes it really hard.  We don't go to restaurants once a week or even once a month, maybe once every few months for a special occasion.  The odd time, maybe once a month we may get the odd thing at MacDonald's.  We don't go on vacations and we have no medical insurance.  We count on our income tax return to have a nice summer holidays of camping and parks with the kids during the holidays.  We don't feel we are missing anything.  We pay our bills on time and enjoy long walks and site seeing, free passes and events.  When people I talk to say, that they can only afford 1 vacation a year, or once a week at a restaurant.  Or they need four jobs and still cant pay the rent.  Do you smoke or drink or drive an expensive car?  Do you fill your house with toys and go out to clubs or spend money on things you dont need?  We dont make payments on anything, and own two cars.  We dont buy extras and we still have a few toys.  We have a nice home on a large property and we still pay mortgage.  We can survive, barely, but we do survive on one income and we dont have a lot of things that a lot of people take for granted.  Give up everything, and live with no vacation and no restaurant and live on one income and get rid or the cars and toys, that is the only way to really say that you have nothing.  If anyone still has all of those things, they should be willing to give it up and then they can say that life is tuff.  If they dont give it up, then life isnt tuff enough for them yet.|`|veZLfnGFaa	It's the economy.  I used to have a lot more money than I do now - make the same thing - pay the same bills - but it seems as though there's never enough money now.  I can feel your pain.  :)|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	yep. the recession is hitting mostly all of us in some way, shape or form.<br>  <br>  thank goodness we have each other though. some people are struggling as singles and/or single parents.|`|yhcyvBOHaa	yes|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	The world really sucks for the working class and its probably going to get much worse here soon. What bothers me is all the peope who put us in this situation are all doing fine thru this why we suffer> Even our government officials who are suppoed to work for us, are drawing their full salaries and having us pay for the healthcare so this mess doesnt bother them ether. Youd figure they would give something as its going to take every one of us working together to correct this mess. But they figure they are immune to this I guess. These officials dont realize that if we cant pay our taxes because of no money, they dont get paid. either. The ripple down effect is going to affect us all even these highly paid sports figures as I know damn well that anyone of us would love to have a multi million dollar contract like these guys are getting. No one is ever worth a million a year especially why so many people are starving and struggling just to get by right now. I would really have to say that the world actually doesnt suck but the people running it sure do|`|c07v7O80aa	That's not the world sucking. That's just economics. Stuff happens. What's happening now isn't even close to the worst that's happened before. People at various times have gotten by on less. They just had to accomodate it. And they didn't have any programs to help. They just did without. They trimmed their grocery bill by a third to a half (sure you can - it's not even that hard). They found free and cheap entertainment. One thing today is that there are many things people think they must have that they really don't need. They don't really need to text, to watch 148 channels of television, or to have high-speed Internet. They don't NEED a phone for everyone to carry around. Many, many people in the past and today lived and live on what they have. You've just been spoiled to having enough money to spend on things just because you wanted them and have come to feel deprived if you don't have them. Sit down and figure out what you would do if you had even less money.|`|1b5728f019d41475becb84dd96477ca3aa	you haven't seen anything yet!|`|NrEyfsDYaa	I feel your pain.

I told a friend a couple years ago that we were heading into a time where people were no longer going to be buying acessories for every outfit.  There are pretty significant flaws in a society that is uber focused on the consumption of material goods.  The cracks in the system are approaching a point where they can no longer be easily bridged by stop gap measures.  And, I agree with the person who said we haven't seen anything yet.  It's going to get worse.  <br>  <br>  How long will it be until we change our philosophies and develop a sustainable social economic system? (ie.e one not so focused on goods intended to prove our value!  How long until brands/logos are totally irrelevant?!?)<br>  <br>  I have said a few times in different arguments, and firmly believe: Marx was only wrong about the timeline.  His fundamental arguments remain solid, and are currently being proven.|`|djUMvICoaa	We've been pretty much living off one income for the last several years, while the other picks up some extra income once in a while.  Things have gotten tight but usually due to unforseen bills, like doctor, but we still manage to end up hanging onto some extra most of the time.|`|fPOg9DuXaa	I agree with you. Life is not very fun right now. My husband and I are both working two jobs each just to afford our rent, bills, gas and groceries. As a result, we never see eachother. We eat out on Sunday nights because that's the only time we see eachother for the whole week. We do not spend money on anything extra. We don't have cable TV or high speed internet. We don't go to movies or do anything extravagent together. The money is just very, very short. We live in California, and the cost of living is increasing and our pay is not. It's not fun. Just like we have to keep telling eachother, hang in there! good luck!

d5479b73829d5fa0818d9eec2850a058aa	Honey - nobody knows what to do in life or what they want.  Just worry about tomorrow.  You need to be taking your meds and taking care of yourself - things are moving a little fast for you right now and a lot of things are going to change but it'll be ok.  <br>  You don't have to tell your past to anyone - it's yours - so that makes it your decision, but maybe you could talk to the new counsellor (or even your current counsellor) about your relationship with this man.  He clearly means a great deal to you but you can't put your life on hold for this person, you need to go on and get on with your life.  <br>  A lot of your concerns may be because so much in your life is changing right now, please talk to your counsellor about it, get some information about the new place and maybe get to know new people from there before you go.  Talk to your counsellor honey, and take care.
T864ejaiaa	people say mean things. you have to learn to put it past you. i was once told by a dr that kids are the cruelest creatures on this planet. no matter where they come from. they say things and do things that hurt. and when they become adults they change. maybe you should talk to the guy your self and tell him you don't think your pretty. and what he said hurt your feelings. if he listens then good. if he does not listen then it's on him. it will be his lose, not yours.  you know what kinda person you are. you seem to be a nice kid and your no dummy from what i read that you write. when people say bad things about me and other people tell me. i say well, as long as they don't say it to my face it's all good. i'm the type of person that is in your face and very blunt about it. there's this girl i can't stand. she always talks behind peoples backs. and she knows if she gets in my face i'll give it to her. life is a learning experience, when i get in a situation that's not a happy one. i put it down as god is testing me to see if i'm strong enough to deal with life. no depression. if you let depression get in side of you it will eat at you and destroy you. if this boy really liked you then he would not have said what he said and he is no friend. good luck and god bless you in your life. try not to be to sensitive to what ignorant people say to you or about you. you should not have deleted  youtub and your contacts. i was one of them. i'll keep you on as long as i have this account.|`|UHfA9yHPaa	and think she's soo pretty but you know what shes not<br>  <br>  No, he means that he thinks you're arrogant, because you boast about your beauty.<br>  <br>  I don't know if it's true or not, but anyhow you shouldn't delete youtube and wipe your contacts just because of one person.

I would say if you dont like your school and the people at your school are treating you like **** move schools because being there is only hurting you more. I've been through this before where i felt like everyone hated me, rumors, and people talking **** about me- not because it was my fault but because of other people that like to see people get hurt. I know it sounds ridiculous for me to say this but i would say to talk to the guy in person alone and ask him about this if you dont talk about yourself being gorgeous then ask him why he has to talk **** about you? dont you think you deserve an answer but at the same time he is an asshole and if he dislikes you without any reason then forget him he is an asshole and is stupid.. just 2 days ago there was a group of guys with my ex and his friend asked me a question simply because i said i dont know he told me to **** off .. dont pay attention to guys that dont know who you are but treat you like crap!<br>  <br>  EDIT: and because the guy told me to **** off i was really hurt by it and cried for half an hour or so but then i got over it because i realized that he is a jerk, he doesnt even know me, so why should i care what he tells me if he doesnt know me? also i think you deleting people on your emails is just a sign that you want to be left alone and your done with dealing with people i know its hard to be in this situation but there will always be at least someone you can talk to<br>  <br>  p.s dont over analyze what that *** said to you it's not true you know deep down inside of you that it's not true|`|1ncmAVadaa	He's not saying that he hates you because you are ugly, but rather that you think you are ugly.just think and make sure you don't come off as arrogant and cocky ever.|`|YSOOvYzoaa	u shud hav confidence in yourself<br>  everyone is pretty in there own way.<br>  just because you dont look/or possible act like them doesnt make you ugly. jus different(and everyone is)<br>  and makes them superficial|`|uvvPusctaa	ITS OKAY<br>  HES A JERK!
9tcTtw6Vaa	What you should do is talk to your guidance counselor or another teacher and find another place to live IMMEDIATELY. You are not in a safe place right now, no matter that it wasn't rape. A 21-year-old man should know better than to sleep with a 14 year old girl. It is not your fault but his. I'm sure that if you talk to a neighbor, teacher, relative, anyone, they will agree that you living with a 21 year old man is not appropriate. You also should not have to have the responsibility of cooking and cleaning for someone at your age. Since your parents kicked you out of your house, you have the option of being put into foster care, where you would be living with responsible adults who would look after your safety. You don't need to live in this situation any longer, take some action and help yourself have a better life. Good luck:) I'd love to know how it works out.|`|xo9QndoXaa	You're gonna be getting an A in that class|`|47e7f174343942df4985e92180812d30aa	Even tho it was consental on your part.. its wrong for both of you.. he can get into serious trouble, more likely go to jail.. and be on the sex offender list.. you need to talk to someone about it. like ur school counseler.. get some help.. good  luck.. and dont do it anymore..|`|HSADGmMMaa	Well, since you are 14 you should know that your parents are doing something illegal by kicking you out. Go get some help, go to a teacher, or the police.<br>  Your teacher boyfriend is also doing something illegal...really stupid of him. <br>  You need to get out of there.|`|aizHCizlaa	You need to speak with your parents and the police, in that order. This is child abuse, plain and simple, among other things.|`|bspT5rkeaa	he could get in serious trouble for that...|`|blirKov3aa	u love him?|`|k6D3QY4Uaa	you are 14, and you had sex with your teacher at school? first off it sounds like your his slave cause you're working like cinderella. and technically it is STATUTORY rape since you are under the age of 18, your story does not make sense, "... but I'm afraid of the thought of me, and him doing it." doing it as in having sex again or talking again? go to your parents they love you since after all you are their offspring.|`|9RDSNzK8aa	ok here's what you should do:<br>  <br>  I don't think you're meant to get him into this kinda trouble. Do you regret having sex with him? If you want to stay with him, then transfer school and continue the relationship. Then you have to wonder what would people think of you. Then maybe you can wait 'til 18 before you can date him. If you don't wanna get him into trouble now, simply transfer school and the rest his history. Goodluck! I'm starting to fear if he's taking advantage of you cuz he knows better. Talk to a mentor and ask him or her what she thinks. I wish you well!|`|rJCkXOMAaa	He is  doing something real illegal by having sex with you his a dumb as but Im not the one to judge <br>  <br>  please answer my question <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvEaQZRuEp6SFt5usOYli57sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306172843AAdIFyd">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|KBL6sE7Naa	lol have you ever seen the movie Lolita?
PfE6bg5iaa	We plan on getting titanium. It really depends on your man.<br>  <br>  Does he work with his hands alot, either for his job or just working on his car? If so he should consider titanium or tungsten carbide. White gold, platinum, and silver are softer metals than these two and will scratch.<br>  <br>  Tungsten is stronger than titanium but also heavier. And it generally cannot be engraved or re-sized. If your husbands finger size changes, you will have to get a new ring entirely! BUT a lot of jewelers and ring companies now have warranties on theirs tungsten rings so it's free if you even need a new one. You'll have to talk to your jeweler about that. <br>  <br>  White gold and silver are very easy to scratch. Also, white gold will start to become yellow-ish tinged after a while from handwashing and just the chemicals on your skin. You should ask your jeweler if they offer this specific type of refinishing for white gold (I can't remember exactly what it's called). Obviously, softer metals are easier to resize and engrave.<br>  <br>  I personally don't think plantinum is worth the money! We're going with titanium, it seems to be the happy medium!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|vyL7yEleaa	i bought my fiance a tungsten ring, there are many designs now and you can have them look like a gold ring. but those rings are of such a hard metal that in order to engrave on it they needed a military grade laser. <br>  <br>  the man who sold me the ring showed me the toughness by taking the very ring i bought and smashed it against the wall of the mall and the metal stand of the store many many times and handed me the ring.. there was NOT a SINGLE scratch dent or scuff on the ring. i was bloody amazed. <br>  <br>  i saw the strength of the ring to as one of my coworkers had 3 on one hand and ever day as we patrolled the mall (yes i was a mall cop) he would smack the rings hard against the stone walls outside. he was TRYING to dent the rings.. after a year of doing this.. still... not a scratch.<br>  <br>  i would defiantly recommend looking into tungsten they are cheaper then gold and platinum and ten times better for lasting. just make sure the ring is really tungsten.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	I know a lot of guys who like titanium rings because they're so light. I love silver jewelry but it's very soft for a wedding ring. White gold yellows over time so you would have to keep getting it rhodium-plated to keep that bright white gold.<br>  <br>  Look at Palladium. It's as bright as platinum but MUCH cheaper.|`|EyhML4GPaa	get tungsten my sis got her fiance one and boy those things are great. they filed it with a wood file and it didnt scratch it they are TOUGH|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Whatever he wants. My husband wanted tungsten and it is very cheap online.|`|YQoG8jVtaa	My husband has a white gold one. I know that a lot of people argue that the white gold yellows over time, but nowadays when you purchase a ring at a jeweler you can get a warranty or protection plan of sorts. This usually allows you to get it cleaned and re-dipped for free. If you don't want to throw down a bunch of money right now on a platinum one, this might be a good choice. I will say though that the one I bought my husband had a brushed metal sort of look to it, and that is pretty much gone now. He has a pretty hands on job in the military so I'm sure that doesn't help, but definitely consider where he might be wearing it.|`|AA11139669	It depends on how often your fiance will wear it--some people work in jobs where they cannot wear rings.<br>  If you want to get it engraved, steer away from platinum--it too hard to be easily engraved.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	The hardness of the metals is white gold and silver, platinum then titanium in terms of wear.   This is an issue as over time gold and silver will wear, over greater time platinum will as well and over more time still titanium - but gold, silver and platinum can all be sized - not so with titanium which is worked very differently.   Depends on what you want, they all have their attributes, and each has their drawbacks.
GMIsOYYCaa	Aww, that idea is so incredibly clever! It's very romantic! ^_^<br>  <br>  Definitely go with B. Don't rush a wonderful idea just because the Canadian and American governmental systems of mail deliveries are horrid and it won't get to him on time. I think you should tell him that you have something planned but it's going to take you a bit longer than usual to get it done, and he'll get it later than your anniversary. It will honestly not be a bad thing.. I was in a long distance relationship too and I have shipped many late presents, which they were very excited about getting, late or not. It's all about you two being together!<br>  <br>  With that being said, I don't think you should do more than that. That is an incredibly romantic gift and if he is the romantic type of guy he'll see that it took a lot of effort to do. Even though I think he probably did get you a gift, let's say for hypothetical reasons he didn't, he'd feel really bad that you put that much time and energy into your wonderful gift for him! So I'd drop a hint like "sorry but your gift is going to be a little late, it's taking me awhile to put it together" to have him understand that this is something you are putting a lot of energy into. Even if it doesn't matter for you if you get a gift, it will matter for him if he doesn't get you something and you get him one.<br>  <br>  hope that helps!|`|TRrTunqvaa	b... but dont rush things because of time! make it worth it... better late than never...|`|E4TQE4RVaa	I think that you should go with Plan B.  The 365 reasons why you love him thing sounds really sweet, and so do the origami hearts!  I think you should finish all of it, even if it's a little late. Hopefully he'll understand after you put so much time and effort into it!  He better appreciate it after you did all that work.  I know I'm not a guy, but if I was I would sure love something like that! (;  Good luck, and happy anniversary!

It is not just about sex, they are more keen on sharing love and emotions and are for togetherness. <br>  <br>  The women usually go for men with sex only when 'in love' contrary to men's desire to have women irrespective of their feelings. <br>  <br>  that is why in rapes a woman is a victim.|`|hQ7UGldvaa	when you're in a committed relationship and after being with that person for a long period of time its only natural to be in sync with what your partner wants.. some women's libido is a lot higher than others so they crave it more often then other women.

88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	I got lash extensions for my wedding, and they looked great.  I had a professional add the individual lashes on to my own lashes.  They helped thicken up my lashes, but were not really long, and not at all fake-looking. They lasted a good ten days.  I didn't have to wear mascara on my upper lashes, either, so no worries about running, smudging or clumping.  I used a bit of waterproof mascara on my lower lashes.  (You can't wear mascara on extensions, and you can't get extensions on your lower lashes.)|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	I don't see anything wrong with the look.

As long as the liner isn't too heavy on bottom it can look very romantic and glam at the same time. Also, your eyes will stand out in pictures. <br>  If you're not going with lash extensions - I'd suggest trying out different lengths and glues if you have time. There's nothing worse than having itchy eyes during the ceremony.. you want to be crying for the right reasons! :D|`|aipChC3haa	I think it is a good idea.<br>  I'm using it, they make you look very pretty, just make sure you don't over do it because that will look bad.|`|Kbz8XEf9aa	As long as they look natural they can be your best friend...just gives you that extra glam..try them out before your big day and make sure they fit right.|`|HJlyGzCtaa	As long as they are trimmed nicely so that they don't look exaggerated it should be fine if you want them go for it.|`|YsiJiOqXaa	I am all for a more natural look on a bride.

But you should decide yourself, it is you choice after all, though i think it is best not to tell him if you don't know him relatively well. but if you are trying to express your personality to show you want a relationship, then you decide. this will let him know a little bit about who you are.|`|ibeFIUpkaa	I think that's a little forward myself.<br>  But do you want just sex from this guy or a "RELATIONSHIP"<br>  <br>  if you want a relationship, telling him this may just make him think you want a 1 night stand...<br>  <br>  If you are a slut, sure tell him.

Don't pursue.|`|ui7SOSi1aa	Sounds like she probably likes talking to you and getting the attention. Girls love attention no matter who it's coming from. But it doesn't sound like she wants to make a commitment towards a relationship. So by saying what she did she is hoping you'll still pursue her ( cause she wants the attention) but isn't going to have a relationship with you. So if it is a relationship you want yeah you are wasting your time. I promise you she'll keep you waiting on the side as long as she can but she'll never be in a relationship with you from the way it sounds. I was like that once. I had a guy that was my best friend that I did that to. I didn't want him as a boyfriend but loved the fact that he loved me so much. But I didn't want anyone else to have him either it took away his attention on me and I'd get jealous. I wound up hurting him bad and loosing a really good friend. I'm glad I grew up though. Just wish I could go back and change somethings. But you are probably wasting your time
YQoG8jVtaa	My husband and I eloped, I guess you could say. A little over a year ago we decided that we were tired of waiting around for the right time to have some big event and we went to Vegas! It was so easy and we absolutely loved it. We actually ended up telling our parents about 2 weeks ahead of time so there weren't any hard feelings. You just don't want your family to feel like you just didn't want them to be there. We got married in December of 07 and then ended up having a wedding back home with family and friends in August of 08. I found that there was virtually no stress in planning the wedding and I was able to let my mom and my husbands mom just kind of run with the ideas they had because I already got what I wanted, which was a great husband and a memorable wedding. I will say though, as soon as I made a public announcement (which consisted of me changing my relationship status on facebook!) the response was overwhelming. Most of my friends were happy for me. They were surprised but not shocked because everyone knew that we would end up married some day. So long story short, we eloped and we loved it but do your best to be sensitive to your parents if you are close with them :)|`|EyhML4GPaa	holy cow yes...ive been asking so many questions on her about it and im not getting any answers. were only telling one of our closet friends each and were going to save up the money for there trips also and fly somewhere like cancun or somewhere romantic and tropical because we live in montana and its cold as ice here and were going to get an elopement package and go do it... woo hoo its the way... my family is going to be very upset. but i dont want to take my sissys spotlight because shes also getting married this year|`|b6aba9d8544ca19789fd92b0c9a7b4c9aa	great idea; it is your wedding and no one else;s .

onbwN4csaa	Nelly<br>  You had said you wanted a small wedding at the Court house. therefore keeping the wedding to your desire and wishes.  After all it is your day.  Family and friends should understand.<br>  You did not say how many will be at the reception<br>  or the size of the reception hall.  Talk to you father tell him the you've been dreaming of this day for many years and that you had the perfect day planned. tell him that you love and respect him but ask him to understand that this time you would like him to respect your wishes. Tell him that you don't want the disruption and confusion that this would cause. Tell him that you want your self and you future Husband to make the date decision together when he gets home.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|b6e3e5765ea9340b4ffd975bfca501aaaa	Just tell your dad that as much as you would like to honor his wishes, you simply can NOT pin down a date because YOU DON'T KNOW.  Tell him that you would feel terrible if grandma came into town, only to find out he's been delayed a week.  Tell him she can either fly in on short notice (which she is unlikely to do) or perhaps he can arrange to have reception on a set day that works for everyone.  <br>  <br>  Grandma can come to that (yes, I said she can come :) ), you watch the video of your ceremony on a big screen, and you celebrate with all the people that couldn't make the private ceremony on short notice.  It's a good way to be able to celebrate with friends and extended family.<br>  <br>  However, if your other grandparents are out of town, then the same rules have to apply to them.  Hopefully for you they are local.|`|7G4hisdzaa	Can you tell her that you are unsure of when he will arrive home, and explain your intentions for a courthouse wedding?

I'm not inviting my mother to my wedding!<br>  I hate her guts and all she does is create drama, and make every little thing about herself. <br>  Best thing to do is tell him a date you know for sure will be past the "real date", and then "suprisingly" change it when you fiancee comes back...<br>  Personally, I am not telling my brother nor my favorite grandma till a few weeks before, and even then, I'll give them the "wrong" date... Then I'll call and tell them I had to make it sooner for some mysterious reason... <br>  I really hope she doesn't crash my wedding!<br>  <br>  EDIT- I didn't invite her to the first wedding either (but then again, we eloped, so no one was invited)|`|RuKK1LYiaa	Just flat out tell your parents that you only want them there cause its not a big deal, if your dads still throwing a fit the moment you get to the courthouse call your mom and have her come only, or your fiance and you could just go and not tell anyone until after the fact. I understand by you not likeing your grandma i have one that i'm not inviting to my wedding but shes  step-grandma but the only one i've known and after my grandpa passed last year she hasnt talked to any of and she had the nerve to say i was going to hell cause of my kids and the last time i saw her she wouldnt even give my children a hug or talk to them she came to my moms house to get my dog like my grandpa used to do and after that happened i told my mom to not let her have the dog for the day anymore. Do what you want and what makes you happy its your day and you get to choose whose there or not.|`|iDfRTLklaa	I would just plan your wedding, and let your dads side of the family know about it at the last minute, that way she might not be able to make it.  Or maybe you can make it an immediate family wedding only, and don't invite the extended family at all.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your wedding.|`|4IQRDtoAaa	...a tough one.  I was married a month ago and truthfully did NOT want to see the faces of certain people on my wedding day either.  In the end, those people were invited and did attend the wedding...and honestly it turned out just fine.  Please try to remember that your wedding day is YOUR day, and no one can ruin that for you unless you allow them to.  Look at it this way....if you don't invite your grandmother, you upset your father and your grandmother and YOU get to be "the bad guy"....if you do invite her, she may pleasantly surprise you and be decent....and if she decides to act in poor taste, well SHE is in the wrong....at least you were the bigger person and tried to do the right thing.

If he was laughing because he thought it was cute, you would think that he would have stopped and apologised when you got upset.  Sounds like he might enjoy putting you down to make himself more important.  Had you done anything to make him laugh about it at all e.g. making a real fuss about having that boyfriend etc.  Not suggesting it, but just asking?  If you had, maybe it is a good idea to keep it a bit more low key next time, and don't tell him much.  Otherwise, I wouldn't worry about getting him back - just remember that he is the loser in this situation.  Hopefully when you say one of the older brothers, there is more than one and he is the only annoying one that would laugh at you.  Good luck.  At least you don't have to put up with that every day.|`|ozbaqOyoaa	i think the best thing to do is just sit down with your brother and really tell him how you feel!<br>  it will help you get over your ex and get your "friendship" with your brother back.. and probably make it stronger!<br>  dont let him get you down! <br>  there are plenty of guys out there,, <br>  and im your age and i will tell you the same thing my mom tells mee..<br>  if a boy doesnt treat you like a princess 100% of the time then he doesnt deserve your heart!! <br>  if that poor s.o.b. broke up with you valentines day over a text.. im sorry but it seems to me that he was an ***.. no offence,, but thats what i see.. he doesnt deserve you and you can do better<br>  Best of Luck<br>  ~Elizabeth~

1YcKHGLqaa	Try to spice the relationship up yourself :) I've been in a long-distance relationship with my beau for several years now, but when we see each other, we really focus on just that: each other. One of the best dates we ever had was when he was driving to see me, I set up a romantic spaghetti dinner "picnic" on the floor of my dorm. I played a list of romantic songs that meant something special to us, and the meal itself cost me about six bucks to throw together, including a pint of Ben & Jerry's. He LOVED it and we just sat and talked and enjoyed each other, and we had an absolute blast with it. Go for walks and find random things to ask the other person, like "what is your favorite breakfast food?" or "what were your favorite cartoons when you were little?"  <br>  <br>  Also, even though you go to the same school, try putting together a care package. Ask little questions over a few weeks, like what his favorite candies are, what his favorite toy was when he was little, etc. Put things (favorite candies, little dorky toys, stuff like that) in a box and either mail/leave it somewhere he'll get it. Leave a long love-letter in it and spray the box with your perfume. Mine goes NUTS for these. <br>  <br>  Take the initiative and make up things to do together. Make up surprises; I once blindfolded mine, had a tote with a thermos of hot cocoa and a blanket in it, and took mine to a scenic part of my campus to sit on a bench, enjoy the view, snuggle, and drink hot cocoa. <br>  <br>  Just... think :) You know your guy. Think up things that would make him smile, even if they seem silly. Everyone likes to know that they're cared for, and knowing that you took the time to put something together will mean a lot to him, spice up your relationship, and give you guys something to do together :)<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|16f56c46047f5f5b2957d5079fa23edeaa	I've been married for 5 years...certainly sometimes I feel like this, especially now that we have a baby.  Maybe it's like they tell new parents though-- make sure to make time for each other. You say you go to his place, have friends over, party, fall asleep.  Maybe you guys should be spending time with EACH OTHER.  Not all the time, because friends are fun and important, but getting to know each other is really, really important too. You said money is tight, so you don't have to go on expensive dates. Just got for walks. Or eat dinner together (even if it is only peanut butter sandwiches).  Ask each other questions. Find out about each other's childhoods, parents, siblings, rivalries, interests, tragedies, etc. Good luck.

She does not deserve to be put through that.<br>  <br>   If this were her situation and she said these things about you, would you still want to be with her?|`|x4Irx79Gaa	It depends how serious u are about ur girlfriend<br>  and u shudnt cheet on her either way but if u like this girl bettr and use 2 arent tht seriouse then break up with her and go for it with the other if u dont want to ruin the relationship u have now then u dont excactly have the tell the hot girl to stop lol just show no intrest at her. <br>  <br>  please answer mine and i hope i helped <br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnFiFfxQHFigKZ.4w8YAAg7g5gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090309222559AA6vYEF">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|6DZsZbjFaa	Dude, do you really need people to tell you that your value system in relation to the poor girl your dating, severely needs to be re-evaluated? try walking a mile in her shoes after telling the world about what you think of her & what you've actually let cross your mind.|`|kl4uqG0Laa	forget miss hot girl and continue with ur relationship i cant believe u just called ur gf looks ZERO. cheat on her OHH EMM GEE i award u with the worst bf in the universe. poor girl [ur current gf] wait u know break up with ur gf cause she deserves WAY BETTER|`|nYzcP5V9aa	I feel sorry for girlfriend and I think you should break up with her because no girl should ever be put in that position the poor girl should go find a guy who is actually worth 3 months and would respect her.|`|v811KD7raa	you should do what you would want your girlfriend to do if she was in that situation and a smoking hot guy was flirting with her|`|AA10831821	This is one of the most shallow questions I've ever read.  Under no circumstances should you cheat on your current girlfriend.  If you care only about physical appearance, by all means dump the "zero" and date the "smoking hot" girl.  However, if you aren't as shallow as your question leads me to believe, stay with your current girlfriend and let the "smoking hot" girl know you are taken and happy.  I hope you will do the right thing.|`|8qSx7CKOaa	Remember beatuy is only skin deep. If the girl who is hitting on you is really hot but is a total ditz, that prettiness will only last till her like 50's. Plus how the hell could you talk seriously with a ditz! If your girlfriend has an amazing personality keep her because those are qualities that last forever regardless of age. <br>  <br>  You could also propose a threesome to your girlfriend. She'll probably get freaked out and dump you or maybe she'll go along with it. If she dumps you than you can go date the hot chick. If she goes along with it than you get both girls. Either way its a win-win situation. It worked for George Constanza!|`|lumJDhIJaa	Even though she may be a zero its not right to cheat because eventually she probably will find out. If you really like the girl you are dating now keep her and ignore the other. Do you know anything about the other "smoking hot" girl? Looks aren't everything.|`|NuaXMa5waa	alright not to be mean, but what the **** kinda question is that?!<br>  you have to tell the hot one your taken. if shes a "smart" hot one she will wait. <br>  also it depends on how much u like ur curret girlfriend. <br>  this hot girl could be completely stupid weird,loose,and just a whore?<br>  plus then u have to watch out for other guys.<br>  i saw tell her to knock it off if your any kind of good byfriend. <br>  looks schouldnt matter.|`|4jdYKzV5aa	The 'hot' girl is probably just flirting for fun. She might just want a fling thing and thats dumb. Don't leave your girlfriend now and definetly dont cheat. If girls find out that you cheated once they won't trust you again.|`|AA12064281	Tell me when you figure it out. Im in the same damn situation.<br>  Im gonna stick with what i have. But its SUPER hard to not be curious.<br>  Good luck|`|1WjP7JKRaa	Well first off cheating it the LAST thing you should be thinking about.<br>  <br>  See how it goes with this girl<br>  she could just be leading you on. Lots of girls are like that.<br>  <br>  keep talking to her.<br>  If you start to see that you really like you and your pretty sure she likes you back take a minute to think and then see whether or not you really wanna be with your girlfriend or this girl.<br>  <br>  If you find you wanna be with this girl, then dump your girl and go out with that chick. <br>  just dont hurt your girlfriend by going behind her back because then she'll have stupid trust issuses and her whole lifes gonna be ****** up.|`|jxshK9mnaa	Just because she's smoking hot then you like her? Are you serious with your current gf? I think personality is a huge part of the relationship. Looks can fade over time. And a lot of girls flirt... I know a female friend that flirts every guys she sees, it's really annoying, but she doesnt like any of them. So you gotta consider that. Anyway, I dont think it's a good idea to dump your gf on a hot girl. Cus there's always a hotter one, so you'll never be stable. And cheating behind someone is a big no no.. don't you have some sense of guiltyness in you??
Od73sfkxaa	I was very nervous...and then when he said his first I got veryyyyy tearful. I got even more nervous when I said mine:<br>  <br>  Preacher: "To love and to cherish..."<br>  <br>  Me: "To hold and to cherish"<br>  <br>  Then I started getting giggly and the preacher started to laugh and my husband laughed too. I can't believe I said the wrong word! LOL <br>  <br>  I am so thankful that I just laughed it off and so did they because I was horrified when I realized I made a mistake. I don't think anyone was really paying that much attention, but of course we just HAD to videotape our wedding...lol|`|UUrqECXIaa	Cheerful. We are an easy going fun-loving couple. Our wedding was at an out door chapel. pretty setting but the music was taped. After we had exchanged our vows and turned to face friends and family, a wedding march song played. My husband thought it sounded like the theme from Rocky (it did at first) and he broke out into this play fight stance in front of our guests. He is very impulsive, and this action was so like him. I busted out laughing, as did every one else.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	My husband kept fidgeting and making faces through the whole ceremony, but during the vows he was all choked up.

I went home and told my sister about this guy i had just seen she knew exactly who i was talking about. She said you better leave him alone i saw him first i said to late because I'm going to marry him. Now I hadn't even been introduced to him yet and he didn't even know i existed i just knew he was going to be mine. One week later we were introduced he was really nice and cute as can be and he knew it.  He knew how to flirt without really flirting if you know what i mean but in an innocent way. 3 months later we started dating he had just turned 19 and i was 25. We dated for 20 months then we were married that was over 30 years ago. I still look at him and see that same guy who captivated me the very first time i saw him. It's been  32 years and i still think to myself how did i get so lucky.|`|u1uECuFNaa	His hair was too big and he was wearing a long sleeve dress shirt in hot weather. It took a second then I realized that he was 'dressy' for me. He was grinning like a loon. (thrilled to see I was as lovely as he thought, he claims.)<br>  He was polite and nice....and his gaze made me blush.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	When i first met my husband i thought he was a very nice and sweet guy and nice looking and i still think those things about him.<br>  <br>  Edit...Faith that's was NOT me saying i was unhappily married so why would you assume it was?..It was some other chick who goes by the name blonde wife who says she has been unhappily married 18 yrs to her loser husband lol...I would never say that about my husband because he isn't a loser plus im not a blonde so why would i change my name to blonde wife?..I'm still convinced she was mocking me.|`|AA12095067	I thought he was cute with the most adorable smile, and I was definitely interested. He tells me that he thought I was pretty with a very sexy figure.<br>  <br>  The first time we spoke with each other we just couldn't stop - we kept walking around in circles because we were so engrossed in our conversation!|`|GHH1i6d3aa	I thought "Wow, this guy is SO funny and intelligent!

hJLrcDCWaa	Always ask him how he is doing. ALWAYS! And if he says he's just ok or bad, ask him why and help him through it. This can give him a small clue. And act kind of mysterious,down to earth, wise. The first thing you have to do is make sure he cares about you. Usually what I want him to think of me is fragile, precious,gorgeous. Once you feel like that's where you are with him, you need to find the right area for some real chemistry. Like if you find him sitting on like a bench or something at night, go and sit next to him and talk to him, look him straight in the eyes, and kiss him. Then he'll really just feel like he can't live without you. You just have to keep building up the suspense like a romance movie.|`|4HnmVpRiaa	I would flirt just a little, not much, but enough for someone to notice<br>  <br>  and if you can, text, or IM him and just make a little comment about ur love life/ his love life.

Then if you both have cell phones or instant messengers text him and say "did u like my little suprise?" and see what he says after that say "Well there's more where that came from!" then if its online sign off so its like<br>  <br>  You: Did u like my lil suprise<br>  Him: Yeah! :) But..<br>  You: Well there's more where that came from!<br>  <br>  You is now offline<br>  <br>  Try that and see what happens|`|PgFGRVOyaa	this happened to me last year too. Well me and the kid were great friends and we always flirted. i knew he liked me allot cause his friend always said i am going to be his girlfriend.

DcrI9zmkaa	If you don't want to talk to him, then don't.<br>  <br>  The next time he comes around calmly but firmly tell him you aren't interested and that you want him to leave you alone because he makes you uncomfortable.  Then, just walk away and let that be the end of it.<br>  <br>  P.S.  For future reference, don't say "I'll think about it" if you don't want to go out.  Reject him outright (nicely, of course).  Otherwise, you're just giving him hope that he can ask later and get a different answer.
uegmmnOpaa	In my experience, there is only one way pouring your heart out is worth it, when the relationship lasts forever.  If not once things go south you think of how pathetic you were.  Sure, there is nothing wrong with swallowing your pride.  In the end you realize you worked way too hard for something that the other person was so-so about.  Is he coming to you pouring his heart out?  Or is he perfectly happy marrying some one else?  It may be all you can think about, but obviously he is doing just fine without you.  Don't be a fool.  The desperate need to do something is not a sign from God you were meant to be.  God doesn't think love is suppose to hurt.  Does this feel like a good thing?  Run....and maybe consider an al-anon meeting.|`|0a2631023a167d302b5b7dc7049ca206aa	Nothing will happen if you don't say anything.

But make new friends More friends dont' stick to her too much . or at least try to be Autumn's friend at least try and if not just make new friends cause people change you're not going to be friends with her forever if shes going to snap at you|`|5YdcrgGoaa	story of my life. i am just as jealous as you are. thats just life. friends come and friends go . plenty of my friends have met new friends since middle school and im mad that im not the center of attention anymore because this new girl takes everyone away and turns them against me . i also feel like the old dog that everyone forgets when a pupppy enters the house. what ive learned is to have alot of friends so when they all turn there is atleast one person there foryou. also try becoming friends with plenty of boys. they will never "ignore" or start "drama" . so much easier being a boy|`|L49hkJzAaa	Though i am a guy, i am like your friend jennifer. She has a lot of personality traits. I can tell that you may like her a bit, but i may be wrong, im sorry if i am. You need to let your friend know how you feel, this will help the situation. If i were in your situation i would probably be friends with both girls. "If you cant beat them, join them"|`|4XVqIalFaa	yeah thats jealousy alright, believe ive been through the sameee thing lol. but i think that your growing apart from your friend jennifer. this happened to me, and i just left my friends, and now i feel soo much better. pleasee jsut ditch them, stand up for yourself!!!! if she wants to be a skank and ignore you just cuz this girl that has a cool name came in the picture, than it just isnt worth. if your not happy, then i think u should move on to biger and better things lol =] gooood luck!|`|gkVd0encaa	get a cellphone and try to get along with the new girl so you dont loose the old friend...|`|2PDhpyuGaa	i can say 2 things...one i dnt like a  girl named autumn cause there all bit**es... and 2 get a life...|`|I6Yomm21aa	change sumthin, <br>  <br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  <br>  start a fight|`|RSWsmYAYaa	damn u do|`|ydamVlhHaa	It's understandable to be jealous about it.<br>  Maybe you guys can talk on the phone instead of text.<br>  Tell Jennifer that she acts wayyy different around Autumn and that it bothers you. Don't be mad about it, but try to have a serious conversation about it. Sometimes people feed off other people's energy so they will act different around others (like when someone is all excited they will catch the excitement) so that could be a possibility.<br>  Ok good luck with your friend, hopefully everything goes well.<br>  :D|`|KPgKm0KOaa	if she was your real friend she wouldn't do that to you. i know its hard but i would stop being friends with her. you dont want to be around something like that. and you the power to change the situation. if jennifer doesnt realize that she cares that your not friends with her thn forget about it. friends are temporary anyways. if your in elementary school, you'll find new friends in middle school, if your in middle school, you'll  find new friends in high school, if your in high school you'll find new friends in college, if your in college, you'll find new friends the job you will work out. dont worry about it. it might just be a phase and it will blow over!|`|yOEgoTsxaa	maybe you should try talking to autumn, and see what she is all about. maybe that will help you figure out why you are so jealous. that's happened to me before too; i would try to be in their conversation with them, but they would give me weird looks. so i would mostly suggest trying to get to know autumn better. :/|`|WREJnokXaa	sounds like you guys are still in junior high time to grow up and get more friends if she was a good friend she would have time for you and still treat you good and try to get you and autumn to be friends if she was a true friend|`|FhPTIU08aa	U HONESTLY NEED 2 HAVE A TALK WIT JENNIFER.....IF THINGZ DNT TURN OUT RIGHT CANCEL THE FRIENDSHIP A.S.A.P|`|UF9MVdSXaa	That is happing to me with my "friend" who ditched me for her old friend. It really sucks how friends we think we can trust do this. Well anyways, try talking to Jennifer about it (it might not work but you never know) If that doesn't work just try making new friends, or get a cell phone, even if it's a Virgin Mobile or Tracfone. (If your parents will let you) And try texting them.<br>  <br>  And yes you do have jealousy problems!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  And good luck!|`|g6sNQ7p1aa	Sounds like you're experiencing good old change. I've got news for ya, and it's not gonna be pleasant, but everyone goes through changes. Looks like your friend here is trying to please Autumn at the sacrifice of who she is. I don't care how long she's been your friend, you don't have to put up with it. You don't deserve to be loyal to someone who's just going to be an idiot and ignore you. So stop beating yourself up about Jennifer and Autumn and go make some new friends. Your real friends won't ditch you or forget about you or change when you're not around. Friends come and go, and it looks like Jennifer's about to leave.

Q3ibC4Rnaa	Our budget it 8.5k, and there have been times when we've gone over, but I've been able to cut corners here or there and come back to being right on! It works to over estimate on somethings, that way when you budget $550 for your cake and it costs $350 you have already saved $200 instead of going over. Also, if you're on a budget, talk to MANY different places. This can take time, but you'll save $100s. Trust me! <br>  <br>  Be sure to put your budget into excel and write out all the things that you need to buy, how much you think it'll be, and then how much you really spent, and keep updating it. The best way for me to figure out these numbers (because it's really hard to pull out of the blue) find a friend or someone else who has just done a wedding and ask for a run down of their costs. Most people are okay with giving out this information. And remember things are always going to come up - so have something put aside for that as well. <br>  <br>  The internet is a great source for looking for cheap things that are unique to do at a wedding as well. Be sure to ask your friends some fun things they have seen at weddings they've been to. Not saying you should do those things, but it might spark ideas. And buy your decorations online - I can't tell you how much money I've saved by using certain websites for my decorations instead of going to Michaels or where ever else.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|QP46eVi4aa	a little over 240.00 dollars just a small church service no reception and i bought eveyrthing at a going out of buisness sale there last day open and everything had to go <br>  <br>  my 1400.00 dress for 50.00<br>  <br>  Also we took what we was going to spend on the wedding and went towards the honeymoon cause it was our celebration adn why waist money on things we did not need when we had a wonderful 3 week honeymoon awesome <br>  <br>  Remember when you are planning a wedding why spend so much on things that are only goign to be seen once when you can have a small wedding reception and then teh rest of the money can be spend on the honeymoon where the most fun is goign to happen|`|q84KT11saa	I spent $2500 on my wedding.  It really depends on what you "want".  I personally look at it as a big party.  Why spend all that money on a big party when you can put it towards something more important.  <br>  <br>  I cut my guest list back to family and VERY close friends, as did my husband.  We had approx. 50 people.  The costs broke down to something like this:<br>  <br>  Dinner/Cake: $1000 (the cake cost $400) If I could do it again, I'd go with a cup cake tower and make it myself.<br>  Minister: $500<br>  Marriage License: $100<br>  Dress/Outfit: $400<br>  Flowers: $300<br>  Chairs/Tables: $200<br>  <br>  We got married at the beach (free).  The pictures were taking by a relative who did an excellent job, they turned out beautiful.  This was her wedding gift to us.  Then we went back to my mother in-law's house and had dinner/music outside.  Our back up plan was to have everything inside her house.  It was a wonderful day.  For me having all the bells and whistles was not why I was getting married.  As long as my husband was there, that was all I needed.  It turned out great, and I was happy I spent as little as possible.  <br>  <br>  If I could do it again, I would probably spend less on the dress and I would oust the cake for the cup cake tower. It was a good cake . .I love cake . .but it was very difficult to purchase a $400 cake lol.|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	Nearly Free, We got the hall and the tables chairs decorations, bishop, Dj, all for free and My husbands parents paid for all the attire, The wedding cake was given as a gift by a cake maker friend and she also did all the flower arrangements for free bouquets and everything.

We had friends cook several different homemade cakes for my "cake", and we had a friend make several different homemade cheesecakes for the groom's cake (no one REALLY likes wedding cake, anyhow).

As he feels pleasure, that pleasure will flow into you.  As you feel pleasure, that pleasure will flow into him.

Sex is not an intellectual exercise.|`|AA11789493	Yeah ok is right.  I guess that's why there are honeymoons. A lot of couples just collapse on their wedding night after all the preparations and festivities.  You are to be admired that you have held off having sex except for that one time.  It's not easy.  One of the most important things is trust in a marriage and another important thing as a woman is to not put yourself down and have self doubts because if you keep it up you'll start being what you think you are. So trust you man in what he says. Sex should please you as well and an orgasm for women is seldom accomplished by the sex act itself. I think you and your fiance should go shopping at a upscale sex store for some sex toys, lubrication and maybe an educational video that may put you both in the mood.  It doesn't take very much for a guy to finish sex before a woman even gets started, and then the woman feels like a sperm dump, so he has an obligation to you to be a thoughful lover and you need to know what you need and to tell him.  Some people say sex is more between the ears than legs--what your ego or psyche is telling you. Sex should never be a chore or something that you look forward to with apprehension,  You and your man can start watching "Talk Sex with Sue" on the Oxygen Network late on Sunday night or go to her web site where there are Q and As as well as link to toys, videos, etc.  I wish you a long and happy marriage.  It takes a lot of work by both the man and woman and you should remember you are equal partners--everything can't always be 50/50 but it should even out.|`|h3NJO9dWaa	Relax, your groom had sex once. He is in love with you, excited to marry you and excited for you two to sleep together as man and wife. He can't know too much if he only had sex once, and even if he is more experienced that is a plus for you. He knows you are a virgin and that makes it even more special for him. It can't go wrong, and you guys will have your whole lives to have sex and try new things and gain experience with each other. Trust me, he is not worrying about if you aren't awesome in bed. He is excited and can't wait to sleep with you, I'm sure. <br>  <br>  It will just come naturallly, and besides usually the embarassing sex things that happen are from the guy like if he can't get it up or comes to early. You will be fine, and he has extra worry on his mind because he feels he has to know what to do, do it right, and make your first time amazing. Lots of pressure on him! <br>  <br>  First times usually aren't the greatest, but it gets better! Especially if it's with your husband. Congratulations on waiting, I think that makes it more special and romantic.|`|3Zad0UuWaa	Honestly, the only advice I can give is to take it slow. Your first time will always suck, you just have to realize that the more you do it, the better youll become. Youll know what to do, what will give you and him orgasms and so on. My first time sucked, no fireworks, anything. My first time on top sucked, but the more I did it, the better I became. Dont panic, he said he didnt mind. Ask him, and ill assure you that his first time suck. Dont worry it is your wedding night, and if yall planned on being married for a long time, youll have plenty of time to become a pro or should I say "freak".  But, think of it as making love, put on some sexy relaxing music. Take your time with everything from foreplay to the intercourse.

6b8e59fd2fd02ff0fc91538b71ecd4d8aa	Being out of work can do odd things to people after such a long time.<br>  Your husband maybe feels he has failed you - men see their role as provider and when this is taken away a man can feel like he's no longer worthy of love or respect...<br>  <br>  If you can praise him and build up his self-esteem it might help.<br>  If you can try to ignore some of the things he says to you - (unless he becomes very abusive)  i'm sure he will at some point realize how much he's hurting you. I know it's hurtful, but i think it could be one of those times where your support of him means you might have to let some things go . . . <br>  <br>  Please talk to the Lord - He knows your every need and i know He will show you and your husband the way through.<br>  <br>  Your family here will pray for you - when we star a question our brothers and sisters set about praying.<br>  Help is on the way - the Lord is with you sister.<br>  <br>  <br>  Love and blessings<br>  T xx<br>  ~~~<br>  <br>  <br>  (((((( GARY ))))))<br>  <br>  (((((( DAUGHTER OF THE KING ))))))|`|U1chPjvPaa	Marriage is give and take, it sounds like you are trying to keep all your feelings inside, while he belittles you and your effort to bring money into the house.  <br>  Kinda sounds like  HIS problem to me!  Don't you think you should let him know you are not going to be demeaned by him WHILE you are supporting him. <br>  Stand up for yourself.  (there is nothing wrong with being understanding about his situation but don't be a floormat)|`|VzIWDuRzaa	There are so many going through bad times right now. I will pray for you and your husband. Pray about it and ask God to help. God Bless|`|MXYWSsM7aa	You see your husband is the classic case of a man who's hit rock bottom. Don't you know that this is a time for you to let him know that all will work out. Tell him that you respect him and that all of us in this country especially are feeling the crunch in these times. Just like a woman needs to hear words of love from her husband a man needs to hear that he's doing what he can to bring in the "bacon". His pride is involved here. He needs reassurance from you that you still look up to him. <br>  When he blows up and criticizes you then just lift up a prayer for him and tell him then that you love him and you will do what you can to look for another job. Let him know that his advice matters to you. Have some down time and make a plan with him. Make it a team effort and you'll see that things will change.<br>  Take care and let us know how you're doing. God Bless. :)|`|c07v7O80aa	You can't. That's one of the rules. You can't fix someone else. Only he can do that. All you can do is (1) understand that it's shame and fear being displaced toward you, and (2) that he won't be motivated to examine this and do anything about his behavior if you accept it. He's going to get loud and kick against it, but you are the only one who can make it clear to him that he can't direct his feelings to you and that you're not going to take it. If you're willing to take it, you're always going to be taking it about anything that happens. And it's not fair to him, even though he's acting badly, for you to hold in those feelings and one day explode. Start telling him, "No. You are NOT going to take out your frustration on me."|`|jWO10NN5aa	His problem is he is feeling small and insignificant because he has no job and you do.  The job that you have is more of a job than the job that he doesn't have.  Tell him to go out and get some job training for some other type of work if he has dead-ended himself.  The only other thing you can do to help ease the tensions is to wrap your legs around his head whenever you are home.  This is certain to distract him from his troubles.|`|briRpzL1aa	It sounds like he is very stressed... Also, guys assume that their role is to provide for their family.  When that ability is taken from them, then he feels less of a person.   That I can assure you...<br>  <br>  As far as how to ease the tension.... First, tell him you are very proud of him, and that he is your hero no matter whether he has a job or not... Second, give your husband allot of sex.  I promise it will do more than anything else to help ease the tension..|`|djUMvICoaa	Can't find a job?  I know that going out and flipping burgers or picking up trash helps one feel better for being able to add to the household income.  These jobs usually leave enough room to go looking if he needs time for that.  But the more time he is without doing something the worse his attitude is going to get.|`|oB4KxwuJaa	Right now he seems stressed because he does not have a job. He might feel as if he is no longer the provider.  Don't worry every relationship has its rough spot.  Good luck.|`|jVJMd5nQaa	You should go see a counseler  and tell her everything|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	he sounds angry about his situation and is taking it out on you. sounds like you all need counseling, because that's verbal abuse, and you dont deserve it. its not your fault that you are the breadwinner of the house right now.<br>  <br>  what a perfect world it would be if men who are stuck in those male/female ideologies would just GET IT that in a marriage its not about me or you but about US. and that each person contributing something should be appreciated. he sounds like a tough nut to crack and will probably blast you out for asking about counseling, but you have got to make your mind up that's what your marriage needs. if it means you go alone to learn how to refute or ignore his harsh treatment then do so. not only will you come to terms  with how to deal with the stress in your relationship you will, with the help of an independent objective third party come to terms with what you want out of the relationship. <br>  <br>  wishing you the best...|`|VG2X9Ihkaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Sorry to hear that situation at home.  It seems that your husband is suffering from depression and he is taking it out on you.  It is not fair but it is how humans normally behave.  They take out their frustration and anger on the ones they love the most.<br>  <br>  What he can do is to look into going to college for learning new skills which might help him get a job.<br>  <br>  In the meanwhile, I would suggest that you need to take some time out as 'Me time'.  This will help you and your self esteem.  You guys could also go out once in a while for a drink or a meal just to wine down and enjoy each others company.<br>  <br>  I know what you are going through is not right and fair at all but I think at this moment in time, you discussing your feelings might not help both of you guys.  There are charities organisations who provide counselling for cheap prices or even free.<br>  <br>  I hope my answer helps you a bit.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Talk to him.

xTWNkwdTaa	Definitely ask her in person! She seems interested in you and any guy that makes the effort to ask a girl in person is worth a chance. Asking online would make you seem lazy. Also consider what kind of person she is though. Maybe if she feels more comfortable talking to you online then maybe you should ask her then. Its your judgment call, but if she's looking back at you and your friend says she likes you...then it won't hurt to try =) good luck
jK5qZ1zDaa	1:  It's kinda hard to read the guy, the only way to know for sure is ask him... I've done the same thing you did a few times and it definatly sucks, telling someone you like them and getting no response, it may be hard but asking him is the only way to find out for sure<br>  <br>  2: Idk for this one its kinda hard to say, really depends on how old the kid is, maybe he likes you, maybe he just thought it would be funny, several different ways it could go<br>  <br>  3: No dont give up on something that you want that bad because theres always hope no matter what. Maybe he'll come around that is if he doesnt already like you|`|AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  2. he is little they make stuff<br>  3.nope|`|01f5341d0d029dbc96f058ba056b39abaa	1.  Jacob may like you only as a friend<br>  2.

Well my brother and many other little kids hear something and they think it's funny to change it up abit, alot. I was talking about my friends @ school which were boys and my brother was easedropping. The next day he decides to tell one of them that I'm madly in love with him and a whole bunch of other blah. Our friend ship went down the drain for a long time and when he decided to talk to me again, it's now very awkward. Anyways, back on topic. He seems like a really sweet guy, you shouldn't give up on him.<br>  :D Shelb|`|V7976L4Daa	Jay-jay, he is playin you! you need to stop talking to him and find someone who will treat you with respect and not call you bad names. no, jacob does not like you, if he did, he would say so! his friends and little bro said what they said to you because it is the truth. yes, give up on him. you can do much better than him. he is probably ugly anyway!
PhPwAGVNaa	Here's a question.. Do you even WANT to open up? ...<br>  <br>  I sense two different sides from you.  You obviously have not found somebody you feel comfortable enough with of which you can open up and spill your feelings to.  <br>  <br>  The other side is that you're confused.  You see other people around you opening up, sharing feelings and you're wondering why you can't do that either.  You're also letting that affect you.  I'm guessing you think that what you're supposed to do is to open up to a friend.<br>  <br>  Well, you really don't need to!  If you don't feel comfortable doing it, then why do it at all?<br>  <br>  Perhaps, what you're really looking for is an outlet.  Do you have any hobbies? Try immersing yourself in those.<br>  <br>  For me, it's writing.  I write all my feelings out & it really does relieve my stress.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|s4vZ2zRSaa	Talking to people about why your upset regardless of how they deal with it, will always make you feel better. just by saying it out loud and having someone listen. my best advice is to start by talking to someone you can really trust. someone whos always there for you. if there really your friend you dont have to worry about being judged. they are there to help you and most likely are having similar feelings. it will also bring you closer to them. If thinking about memories and other thoughts are what making you upset then think about something else. they are in the past and cant be changes so just focus on now and your future. things are never as bad as they seem and i guarentee you they always get better
K6TeDfEZaa	First, the truth is, the new thing is always the more interesting. Admit that and see how you can be a better friend.<br>  Second, your friends probably don't like you boyfriend for a reason, could just be plain jealousy of your attention, but I would ask them each (one on one). You may be surprised what you find out.<br>  PS. Don't tell your boyfriend, it will freak him out.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|9Duha1k4aa	Believe me, sometimes friends see things in your boyfriends that you can't see yourself. Friends will be there to pick up the pieces after a failed relationship. Friends will talk to you the way a bf can't. You should care for your friends more, really. There must be a reason why they don't like your bf. Ask them? <br>  <br>  You need to manage your time better. Maybe stay with your boyfriend one week, and with your friends the other. Or, alternate days. Either way, sort something out.<br>  <br>  There is a girl in my year who has drifted away from her friends because she spends every day with her boyfriend, its rather sad really. Don't be her, because you without friends, you'll be lost.|`|kWKZoQogaa	You just have to make time for your boyfriend, and time for your friends. Separate time. If they aren't going to get along, that's all you can do.

Your friends and family always come first before a boyfriend.... ALWAYS!!!!!!!|`|5UbC5hP9aa	You should really talk to your friends about how you feel. I am sure they are only doing it to see how much they can get away with. Once they know how much they are hurting you, if they are your real friends they will stop. And if they don't then they don't deserve you.|`|SmjfBcuZaa	Tell them if you mean enough to them. They would respect you and your boyfriend. if they can't do that for you well their obviously not your real friends-- or another conclusion is that thier all just being childish.|`|QDVXC0GMaa	first time i'm reading something like this. Maybe u should seperate time for each|`|coqTBB6baa	Have you tried to talk to your friends? I mean surely if you explain them that your boyfriend is important for you and on the other hand you don't want to lose your friends they might be a bit more understanding. <br>  If they are really good friend of yours they will make the effort to befriend a bit more with your boyfriend, otherwise they will lose you. <br>  On the other hand you might want to think over who are your real friends. real friends do not behave like that and at least accept your boyfriend. They do not have to be best friends but at least realize how important he is for you and tolerate this.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6o42rxK9aa	Is there a qualified reason why your friends dissaprove of your boyfriend?<br>  If so, i'd take it onbaord.<br>  Otherwise, i'd sit your friends down and have a discussion with them, let them know that what they are doing is only makin life hard for yourself.<br>  And trust me, make sure you aren't putting your friends second, its easy to do so and not realise.|`|LY1k1xvLaa	After a while, it won't work. You can't date someone that your friends dislike because most likely, one of the two will start getting jealous. And then eventually, either your friends or boyfriend will get fed up and you'll end up arguing with one of them.|`|kRN7SPiyaa	I would talk to them each individually and maybe do some really fun group/ individual activity such as LAZER TAG!

If not, than perhaps your friends aren't very good friends. You could have a talk with them and tell them how their negative attitudes make you feel, and explain why you care for your boyfriend. Then they may be able to see your point of view better, and be willing to hang out all together.|`|7ujOHxPnaa	Find time for both of them but make sure it's equal. Spend a little bit of time with your boyfriend and a little with your friends. But remember friends are forever and boyfriends are for now. Still spend equal time with both. Don't make either feel rejected and shut out.|`|9a1c7a457caa458522daacb449b9d0aaaa	SOUNDS LIKE A BUNCH OF INMATURE LITTLE KIDS|`|AOTM3QzTaa	there jeolous|`|RSWsmYAYaa	they need to grow up!
b4c080d0f4c39aa94fde4b1f35a009fbaa	Number of times I have answered such questions regarding inter-religious marriages apart from getting them solemnized before the marriage officer. You both belonging to different religion can marry in the court of the Registrar of Marriages/Marriage Officer without changing your individual religion. Registered/Court marriage as you call it is solemnized under the Special Marriage Act, 1954 all such marriages can take place between any two Indian citizens as well one Indian citizen with a foreigner irrespective of their religion, caste or creed, and you can say this is the secular form of marriage available in our country. Such a marriage is solemnized before the marriage officer/registrar usually D.C. deputy commissioner of the area /SDM where both or any of the parties to such a marriage reside permanently or for at least one month. Cost of such a marriage as the rate prevalent in your area. Now how you proceed? Both the parties to the marriage file a joint application before the marriage officer along with individual affidavit attested by notary public specifying the age(boy 21yrs &girl 18yrs), place of residence, marital status(unmarried or divorcee as the case maybe), mental status(not idiot or not with unfit mind), not related to each other. Along with this you have to give proof of age (School certificate, Passport, Pan card), proof of residence (Passport, ration card, voters ID card, rent agreement), & the application/notice of such a marriage maybe asked to be witnessed by 3 independent adult persons, affix one photograph of each of the parties & all the 3 witnesses. You have made such an application/notice to the marriage officer in person along with all the 3 witnesses. On receiving such an application/notice the marriage officer issues a month notice regarding the intended marriage & get such a notice affixed on the notice board out side his office, a copy of such notice is sent to the marriage officer under whose jurisdiction the other party lives, also a copy is sent to the individual parties permanent address. After expiry of the period of notice a date is fixed on which all the persons parties to the marriage & 3 witnesses appear again before the marriage officer who declare them married & issue a certificate to this regard. Incase of any objections raised the marriage officer will settle these objections. Now what can be objections that can be raised? These can ONLY BE REGARDING THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR SUCH MARIAGE & NOTHING ELSE. What are the conditions? As I stated above i.e. Age, martial status, mental status, prohibited relationship (related to each other by blood). This is the brief & general procedures I have told you here. It’s always better to engage a lawyer to get such marriage solemnized to avoid any legal impediments which he will be able to handle.|`|wuZXqYPGaa	oh i saw it on slice channel on tv once. they incorporated main religions into one. the pastor of each ethnic group spoke, so they kinda got married twice, it worked out well and there was not much tensions :)|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	change your oil every 3000 miles|`|drzkJ9ouaa	I agree with Mr.Vijay M|`|B359bLqsaa	I have absolutely no idea about hindu or muslim religions.  I dont even know what a bfrd is.  But I think if you guys cant even agree on how to perform the marriage then you are headed for all kinds of troubles in the future.  Both of you need to give up some of your ideals if you want the marriage to work and you need to compromise.  If neither of you want to give up your religion, how will you raise the children?  I can see it now where you will demand your way and the other will demand their way.  I think you should state what you are willing to give up in order to be with this other person.  If you are not willing to give up anything, then don't go forward.  It will be a disaster.|`|RGC2aDf2aa	oh honey do both in same day... many people do that it's not big deal... (*_*)
8MTN47C9aa	He's probably just tired form working. How long have you been together? Things do start to slow down after a while. He feels comfortable now. Sex once a week is actually VERY normal! At least your still having it! That's a good thing. Just try to relax and eventually he'll probably want more when he's not so tired. And my husband watches porn without me, Too. But I don't mind because it's better than him going to bars and cheating on me. I trust him enough to know he would never do that.|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	he don't want to have sex too much or would cause boring in marriage. just let it happen and have sex that best. <br>  <br>  My husband want more more more! I like sometimes because I don't like too much and saving in our future more years and saving some excited too.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	He is guilty of crimes against his gender. You need to be lecturing women on how this is done, he needs to man up.|`|nZPGdcKJaa	ME TOO!  I know EXACTLY how you feel.<br>  My husband can be fine with 1-3 times a month and I want it to go back to 3-4 times daily!<br>  <br>  I know he watches porn and masturbates in the shower, etc AND he knows how I feel.  I NEVER say no and I let him do anything he wants.  I've even offered to get another woman involved (if we ever found someone like that) just because I NEED MORE SEX.  I've tried getting him drunk and taking advantage of him, and that only works 50% of the time.  I tried walking around the house naked.  Seriously, I think I've tried it all!<br>  <br>  I'm in the military and he works on base as a civilian.  I've asked this same question on here too.  People will say "he's cheating" or "is he gay?"  I KNOW he isn't cheating.  I was paranoid for a little bit our first year married (2005-2006) but now I trust him 100% and have realized this is just how he is.  <br>  <br>  The thing that I found out is he was always happiest when he was doing things he loves and enjoys doing.  He didn't like his job a year a ago so I told him to find another.  It took him 2 months, but that was ok because I made enough money for both of us and he got to stay at home and cook. He LOVES to cook.  We had more sex when he was happy and not as stressed.<br>  <br>  Talking about this topic with your husband is awkward and not fun.  I've always found it easier to talk about when we were drunk.  I talk more with a little wine in my system.  Or, go out with another couple you're really good friends with. We are in our mid 20's and had really good friends tat were engaged we used to hang out with.  Sex would always come up.  Either talk about it together or tell a good friend (girl) who will then tell her bf/husband and he will talk to your husband.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I feel your pain!|`|jcXsclHYaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  You need to have an honest conversation with your husband and ask him what causes his behavior - avoiding sex. it might be many things and to be honest I do not think it is cheating. It might be a difficult age for him (yes, men have it sometimes), it might be problems at work you do not know of. So you need to talk to him honestly, find out and from there you can help.<br>  <br>  Good luck and Take care.|`|kTUL01tfaa	he is sucked into that fantasy world of fake girlfriends where he's in control [in his mind] and he doesn't need you for pleasure anymore, very selfish, love making between married people fills emotional needs too, but men who watch porn don't care about that, porn was the beginning of the ruination of our long marriage, but he still won't admit it, he ended up cheating.|`|svrrbZU0aa	Sex is an important part of any relationship, i suggest if he shows no interest in you to move on.|`|fjCxv2I4aa	checking out the porn is the problem.hes getting his jollies with it without you.he needs counseling in a bad way.|`|kSEO2w8Aaa	Might be cheating|`|wuZXqYPGaa	well im not gonna put the 'hes cheatin on you' theory in ur head, cuz u want to be positive. i think that since he masturbates all the time and watchs porn, that he has this fantasy of this amazing woman in his life, and porn does that to you.. you get so caught up in it that no reality is close to the sight of masturbatin n porn... im not sayin that he doesnt think ur good enough, cuz he knows you are, he just has this fairytale fantasy and no matter how many times you will attempt to mix a lil "fantasy" in ur sex life, he turns it down. i dunno i think that he honestly should get some help, im not sayin that hes a loonie or porn addict, i just think he needs to be guided and get his head on track. cuz SEX IS HUGE IN A RELATIONSHIP, you guys need it and boys should b the LAST to reject sex... GIRLS should never b the ones beggin for sex---- wish you all the best, hope i helped|`|B359bLqsaa	I understand exactly what you are talking about because I'm in the same exact situation.  My husband also tells me he loves me but he has a headache all the time.  I dont think he is masterbating but I know he is not interested in having sex with me.  I dont understand it.  I feel so unloved but he swears he loves me.  I have talked about it with him so much but it hasnt done any good.  Today I talked to him again, and he said all I ever think about is getting laid.  It was so mean of him to say that and it made me feel like a cheap whore.  I told him I did not want to get laid, and if I did want to get laid I could go get f'd  by 20 different men.  What I was asking for was love from my husband, instead I got insulted.  This is causing trust issues.|`|RtkB46peaa	Is he stressed out?  That can explain a lot about the lack of sex drive.
58ScqWG3aa	Well for one thing I've been told that the more wieght girls gain(like overtime) the worser their cramps are gonna get when they get their period so it's kinda good for them to be monitoring their weight.Although being skinny isn't always a good thing.The next time they talk about how fat they are,just say that tha's not fat,it's actually their hips.When skinny girls start gaining weight overtime it fills out their body a bit more,giving them a more appealing look.(sorry my answer is so long and confusing)|`|thOwKnWgaa	Don't surround yourself with people like that, If there that obsessed for get them, I don't know what the big thing with weight is anymore but come on. SO what if people are bigger or smaller, (what ever happened to peoples personality's count) Hope this answered your question.  Good Luck
06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Most likely because he doesnt get any positive attention at home. He needs it and so he is at the point where any kind of attention is better than none. Is anyone in the family showing a positive interest in him? Playing ball with him? Doing things with him he likes? Asking him how he is feeling and then actually listening? He sounds desperate for someone to look at him and care.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Unfortunately, your parents aren't very good at discipline with him.<br>  You can pretty powerless in this situation.|`|4AavBJy8aa	attention people will give u loads of shitty reasons but the answer is he is a little brother and little brothers are wankers , i am one and have one  its just the rules if your a little brother you allowed to be a twat  he grow up one day|`|fiXHKUc3aa	its not your fault,<br>  and you really cant do much in this situation.<br>  maybe your parents should discipline him better.
k4XLr4TUaa	Maybe when your gone they may do 'things' to her.. Ask her but be sensitive about it so be like, i have been seeing that your very clingy on me when i am around my friends, is there something that they have said/done to you? if she hesitates or takes long to answer something might of happened. Its not your fault for this happening, you never knew that this would happen..|`|VhHVjMe8aa	It sounds to me like one of your "friends" made a pass ay her when you weren't around.  Just ask her!  And no you aren't responsible for how your friends act.|`|KSlOL5Ueaa	maybe ask her about it.<br>  but dont like.. leave her with them alot.<br>  if you're there, you should be with her.<br>  <br>  but maybe she knew them previously and had a bad history <br>  w/ one of them.<br>  or something like that.<br>  <br>  just ask if she's okay &&<br>  ask her opinion.|`|NsyNTKZHaa	Maybe you shouldn't leave her with your friends anymore. Hang out with them when she's not there. Or maybe you could ask her"Have my friends done anything to you?" And then you'll be able to help her...Good luck....=)
JAruRfYqaa	a lot of times, guys read too far into what girls do. now i'm not saying that she doesn't like you, but there is no way anyone online is going to be able to tell you whether or not she likes you based on how you describe her. you are going to be totally biased, and it's not bad that you are, but we can't help you if you only see what you think is there.<br>  now, that said, if she is your stereotypical girl, no-strings-attached-plays-everything-by-... type, then yes she likes you. now usually girls have their own ways and quirks and what not. but from how you describe her, she is not hard to read at all.<br>  as for the whole "no talking on the phone", it isn't that big a deal. i hate talking on the phone, and i'm wicked fast at texting. so don't read too much into that one.<br>  you have a lot in common, that's good.<br>  ask her out.<br>  don't analyze her every move.|`|Xtk1NkLWaa	shes ones of those types of gurls<br>  that try to not show there inner<br>  feelings ur gonna have to get 2<br>  know her better to get to read her better<br>  maybe the reason shes like<br>  that is becuse she doesnt wanna get hurt<br>  thats y gurls tend to close up and'<br>  guys say there hard to read<br>  <br>  hope this helped|`|cZ05mysLaa	it seems like your sort of her "go- see guy friend". she  does probably like you because of the way your describing what she is doing. take it easy or a couple of days. if she ever flirts then of course that's a sign that she is very friendly. since she is single, she wants to mingle. and she seems very fond of you.|`|FhPTIU08aa	maybe she's likes you but she doesnt really know how to put it because she's still stuck on her ex .......so juz keep talkin to her let her breathe an maybe she'll be ready 4 you in atleast a week.|`|yICddWuoaa	Well, I too used to have trouble with reading girls. I found out that the best way to read a girl is by creating a special bond that ties you two together as great friends. So I wish you luck my good friend.|`|gRKp82diaa	she prolly likes you ask her out buddy|`|Ge6WhCf7aa	ask her to text a little better in a nice way?

xuDGrCSVaa	You can give thanks to the American educational system... we are all going downhill especially our poor children.   And yes, unfortunately, you are fighting a losing battle.  If you will also notice people switching the words "your" for "you're" all the time.  You can't do anything but get used to it....:(|`|OpwMuboqaa	I don't know the word loosing.  It is "I am losing my mind."

It just happens.  When the time comes you will know it.  Some people die virgins, but that is a choice.  Unless you hide in a cave the opportunity will arise, lol.  Personal values do dictate action, however, most people have been is a situation by the end of high school that could result in getting laid.|`|J4wTIhsoaa	when they feel the time is right... I was 14... I know people who didn't lose it until 18, or their late 20's. It depends on the person. But my advice, wait until you're in love, or if you're in your late 20's do it with a good friend lol. The biggest thing you will ever regret is losing your virginity and it not mean anything.|`|mTqkcTtWaa	haha as much as i wanna belive in the marriage b.s. i cnt haha there isnt a rate, just when they feel its right, and i dnt understand whats the diff if its after marriga or not if u love the person and ur above a certain age i dnt see the problem|`|GOwVCwdsaa	marriage bs :]<br>  idiot, ur only in the 8th grade.<br>  <br>  <br>  but you gotta find someone that will actually WANT to have sex with you|`|BcZTrENjaa	WHEN THEY ARE MARRIED.
DcrI9zmkaa	Sorry to be blunt, but you need counseling.  Your behavior is nothing less than self-destructive (not to mention it doesn't even make sense...you want *him* so you sleep with every guy *but* him).  There must be a reason why "missing out" has caused you to react this way, and you should be more concerned about finding that reason than finding out if you have a chance with this guy again.  Solve that problem and there won't be a need to worry about him.<br>  <br>  P.S.  Trust me, the solution to your problems is *never* found in a bottle.<br>  <br>  **EDIT**<br>  <br>  There is almost *always* a logical explanation for our behavior, we just don't always know it.  That's why I said you need to seek counseling.  If you keep making these "mistakes", you're going to end up destroying your life.  It's better to get to the root of the problem and deal with it.|`|fIXuFk6daa	So explain again why you are getting drunk and making out with random guys, but just want him?
IRlVBGWOaa	Divorce him.  First, if he says he wants a divorce, then there is no reason for you to waste your time on him because he obviously doesn't want a real relationship with you anymore.  Second, he probably has a problem with you having another man's baby because he was married to YOU, not the other girl. You two have a past and were once in love, so I'm sure it hurts him to see you with someone else's child. I think that he loves you, but can't get over everything that has happened between the two of you.  Third, stop having sex with him and definitely stop helping him so much.  You are worth more than that and you shouldn't put him before you.  Divorce him and live your life for you and your kids.|`|pg0q9eoUaa	Wow! You guys got a lot of issues.|`|KPgKm0KOaa	too lazy to read this whole thing but if you wanna ruin your childs life then go ahead and divorce. my mom got divorced twice and im so unhappy with my life. because of her i blame everythign bad that has ever happened to me on her. i get mad at her all the time and she wonders why im so mean to her. stupid ***** in my eyes. but not to the reatrds that keep marrying her.|`|xtmFBjO9aa	I think you should definitely gove this man a divorce.  You do not want to bring a baby in to this world with a man who does not accept the baby.  Thats how so many children get hurt and killed.  You need to be choosey who you have around your child.  You are only 20 and there will be other men.  He has a problem with you having another man's baby and not the other girl because you are his wife.  it probably eats him up that his wife is having a child with another man whether you were separated or not.  Another reason to give this man the divorce.|`|yOEgoTsxaa	have you gone into any marriage counseling? :/<br>  <br>  i dont know about the whole baby thing; maybe it's because she is new and a little younger? i mean, i dont mean to sound like you're "old" or anything, but really.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	This really sounds like its doomed from the start. You two would have soooo much to try to overcome. Is it worth it? Can you honestly say you or him wouldn't throw this stuff in each other face the next big fight you had?|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	the difference is he's married to you and you are having someone else's baby while the two of you are married.  It's an ego thing for a lot of guys and they can't get past it.<br>  <br>  Since you are keeping the child, if there is any risk of him mistreating the child then you would be better off divorced.
PdxMOlcaaa	It sounds like your mother has had trouble with relationships for a long time.  Would your mother seek medical help?  Her fast mood swings could be more than a simple depression, it is possible she is a fast cycling bi polar.  My reasons for suspecting this would be dysfunctional relationships, possibly harmful sexual behaviors.  Bi polars try to control people around them her envious behavior is typical.  She needs help and they are usually the last to think they need it.  You can't fix a person yourself and if they wont get help that's not your fault.  Tell her what you think she needs number one going to the Dr. and be honest about what is going on.  Don't let her problems damage your life.|`|2PDhpyuGaa	foe one how old our u,.. n 2 he is ur husband, so he should be with u.. and 3 put her *** in a home.. n 4 u said ur condo tell ur mom to get a job n get out... idc what ur mom been throught no need to do all that, n if i was in the family i wouldnt talk to her either.. so what i would do is tell my mom how it is. n ur husband shouldnt have to talk to her at all|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	Keep your mother at arm's length at least. She is sure that your husband will run away with another woman like your father did. Sometimes people get so attached to the bad things that happen in their lives that they project it on others. <br>  Please stay away with your husband. Don't cut her out of your life totally, but keep your husband away from her.|`|qQXeAAgHaa	okay 1st really long ? um thats a tough one um okay well i think that your mom is going through a tough time to like you said she has no friend ecept those that use her maybe she just needs someone there for her that will help her get out of the house she must not like your husband because he is a=taking you away then she will have no one you ahve to see from her point of veiw too you see she is just afraid of being alone and doesnt know how to show it try to get her to get out of the house more and do stuff with friends that will help allot help her move on|`|FDq7fEZMaa	take her to a physcatrist (sp?) becuase if she cannot accept that you have a Husband and friends, then wait till you have kids and get more friends. <br>  <br>  Or you can tell her straight up that you are all she has left and she can have no one if she keeps this up around you.|`|7F0baAbNaa	well honestly if that was my problem i would tell my mother off and she needs be nicer so she can have friends u could also get her to go to a anger management session just to c if it helps any then i would tell her she needs to get a job and get some friends|`|JRATgHLqaa	tell your husband to **** your mother this way their relationship will improve|`|o6tLojhlaa	i dont understnad all of this. do you live with your mom? and did your husband sleep over at your moms house? she has a right to not like him if thats the case. you decide your mature enough to get married but you continue living with mommy? i dont know him, but my jeezums.. i hate your husband too.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	I am confused as well. You and your husband are planning to move in together next year at some point. Where do you live now? or him? if you living in her house you have to abide by her rules. If you don't like it move out. Perhaps with your husband.|`|0muvYszmaa	Call Dr. Phil or something honestly I would just be like mom I love you but you need to get therapy and become social you also need medication and I think that you need to start talking to your family and like I said become social. I would also see if I could get her a job.
RCIrU23laa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I know how you feel! Im pretty much similar to you. I've been with my bf for 8 years! I have been bringing up the whole marriage topic since 2005.I, too want to get married so bad but he tells me until "we" are financially ready.Im in school and is waiting for me to finish so we can jump into it.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you can feel desperate and overwhelm when time goes by and you see your family and friends getting married that are around your age. <br>  <br>  Dont worry. He will eventually do it. I think he is waiting for the right time when both of you guys are financially ready and you mentioning hardship in the relationship. Its common. I go through that. He probably doesnt want to encounter any hardships upon you getting married in the long run.<br>  <br>  I wish you good luck! <br>  <br>  I hope you will eventually marry him!|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	You can be engaged and wait a LONG time to get married...You shouldn't pressure him first of all but my guy proposed a year a half ago and our wedding date will be just under 2 years from when we were engaged...My friend has been engaged 3 years and my other friend just booked her wedding which is also 2 years over the time her man proposed.|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	It sounds like it is purely financial reasons. He just can't afford it. He wants to buy you an nice ring and give you a nice wedding. But it's just not possible for him right now. Don't worry about it, it will happen when the time is right.|`|HcboXOmjaa	Who knows? But if you can only talk about marriage stuff when you guys are drunk than you are not ready to get engaged.  Wait a while longer and see what happens. He may just be trying to surprise you.|`|oRtNwvGoaa	Maybe if he thinks he will loose you he might be a little more motivated. I'm not saying to break up. Be more independant! He could propose, it does take time to plan the wedding.|`|4IQRDtoAaa	Having a wedding and getting married are not the same thing.  People can get married and hardly spend more than twenty bucks (USD)...it's the wedding that can get ridiculously costly.  If his ONLY hesitation in marrying you is having money for a wedding, you might ask him to marry you now and have a wedding later on down the line once you've saved up some money.  His answer to that will give you some insight into whether he'd really like to make you his wife, or whether he's trying to buy some time to make sure this is what he actually wants to do with the rest of his life.<br>  <br>  That being said, stop being so "desperate" to get married...especially when you say your urgency comes from "having been through so many bad times together"...I'd hope your relationship is on more solid ground than this...marriage is not going to make bad times go away.  You should really consider whether or not you should even be in a relationship with this guy, let alone spending the rest of your life with him.
njgF24Tbaa	What do you do for a living? <br>  <br>  Do you work or do you just live off your husband like a lazy bum, and used your looks to make your husband pay for your existence in the form of food, clothing and shelter?

AND the competition is fierce! I heard that MCI did lots of layoffs last year...|`|UJD2eYebaa	Must be other reasons that you want a divorce and to you, his transfer probably seems like the ideal time to do that.  If you really love your husband, you would move anywhere to stay together.  Does your husband want a divorce also?  Definitely need to discuss this with him and make your decision or get counseling to work out the real issues if that is what you want.  Good luck.|`|djUMvICoaa	So him moving to keep his job in this time is your reason for a divorce?  What did you ever base your marriage on then?  I think in the next few years you would want to have been married to him but that's only a guess on my part.  So why can't you stay there and allow the kids to go to school or whatever and see what happens if you and hubby can work it our or not.  It would be like a trial separation and there is nothing wrong with that.|`|AA11525464	In my view, your reasons do not justify you in seeking a divorce from your husband, but he might consider getting one from you.|`|yULnOJUwaa	Not wanting to move is not a valid reason for a divorce.  Don't you love him anymroe?  Home is where the heart is - where's your heart?  The man is trying to provide for you and the kids by keeping his job and you want a divorce!  I don't understand your reasoning.  No you should not get divorced if the only reason is you don't want to move.|`|UGOse5Dvaa	Yes. Get a divorce.<br>  <br>  Any woman that contemplates divorce because her husband got a transfer should cut her husband lose to find someone that cares about him more than you clearly do.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  How sad for him to be stuck with a shallow, selfish person such as yourself.<br>  <br>  How sad for your kids that YOU would raise them, given you selfish nature.<br>  Hope they grow up to be like Dad.

If you feel it would help.....see a counsellor...and work out how better you could work on your relationship.....because like....if your car had a problem....and you didnt know how to fix it...you wouldnt leave it broken....and hope it would fix itself,,,you would take it to a specialist .....I would definitly see a counsellor in your case.....as marriage is one of the most important things you will do in your life.

Its like he totally does not understand anything I'm saying and sometimes I get angry and say stupid things too.  Now its even worse because he blames me for having an anger problem.  I don't have an anger problem, I think  he has an emotional brick wall problem but is blaming me and not taking responsibility.  We are trying to work on it, but still its like we are talking in totally different languages or something.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes I wish I could slap some sense into  him so he could know I love him.

I think most women's expectations change when they get married, but what I am learning is marriage dont change men. Men have to change themselves, so if your husband was the same way before you were married, to expect anything different would be a mistake. One thing I have learned with age (I am 40) is that men do not hear women when they are screaming. He is not going to open up because he has tuned you out the minute you raise your voice or say something he has heard before. His suggestion to get a divorce is simply a solution since men tend to think in terms of final solutions. We, as women tend to ponder and disect issues or problems. So he probably dont mean it he just wants to end the fighting. Give your guy a break. Ease up and make your marriage work. You are going to have to let some things go for the sake of peace. Vocalizing your concerns are good to keep you from harboring resentments, but try to pay attention to your words and tone. If you are always saying stuff like.."you always this..or you never that.." he is going to feel as if he is being attacked and bottle up. Try telling him how you feel in a different way and he may be more perceptive. And chose your battles wisely, if its something simple, let it go.

5yfSIsXNaa	Alright, I don't condone cheating and while my other answers show that I am a very sexual person being honest and faithful in a relationship is extremely important.  I read your question and I don't think you should leave him, nor do I think he should leave you, I think you need to talk this out and find a way to move on with your relationship.<br>  <br>  Think about it, it's been 6 years, has he given you any indication that he's done the same thing since?  (If he has done this since then, yea leaving him would make sense, if not, keep reading)  <br>  <br>  The man has stayed with you for 6 years, I highly doubt it's just out of laziness and I really wouldn't be surprised if he was celebrating, got really drunk, and happened to make out with a woman who bit him.  Think about it, the average guy doesn't have an affair but then come back immediately afterward and then stay for 6 years.  Also, while I know it's a weak excuse, as you mentioned he did pass out as soon as he got back, it's very possible that he really was too drunk to remember, or as he said nothing happened, meaning he got drunk, kissed a girl and in the process she bit him on the neck.  That doesn't mean he had sex with her or that he had an affair, it means he got drunk and somehow got bitten, pants don't have to come off to get bitten on the neck, hell a shirt doesn't even have to come off to get bitten on the neck.<br>  <br>  Finally, it's been 6 years, you're still with him, there must be a reason why you're still with him and if I had to guess I'd say part of it is because you care for him.  Talk it out, put your fears aside, and be with the man you care for because honestly if you don't even care for him anymore, why are you still with him or asking the question?|`|ZGHDw6sxaa	leave if you want to leave.  if you want to stay, stay and live in the present and let the past stay in the past.  6 years have passed and at this point the problem is you not him in my eyes.  Whether he cheated or not, how many more years are you gonna let this consume you?  What are you getting out of staying with him yet not letting the two of you move past the incident; it sounds like you just want to prove you were right and punish him sufficiently. Free yourself from this one way or another, if he won't leave and you don't want to be with him, then you leave.|`|djUMvICoaa	If you truly can't get past it get a lawyer, it's the only way to move on.|`|WwBSnPMMaa	GET A DIVORCE.

bwKZ8MWWaa	A woman whose mom was bullied is more likely to be bullied|`|m81dfyOYaa	No I think it depends on the personality of the woman. I came to the states, married, had no family here except the family I created and certainly didn't let my ex bully me.|`|BlA60kDVaa	No child of mine should ever be bullied.|`|DQkDQraOaa	Possibly. Since she has no family, her support system will consist of only friends and coworkers, who cannot always be depended on to help out like family would.|`|YlyOFrrKaa	Nothing to do with it. I think it would be more likely if they had family Because the family could annoy him and he could take it out on the girl.|`|UAh16Trtaa	Well I am sure having a protective father in law is going to make a man a lot more timid.|`|D9AUzmZRaa	Yes. But probably only if the woman and her family are close, and are involved in each other's lives. You know - spontaneous visits, frequent phone calls, birthday cards and gifts sent in the mail... the guy would have to see and experience firsthand that the woman had people who cared about her and "had her back."|`|9KOuOEy9aa	No, I think it depends on your personality  I have told my husband he was an asss for making jokes about abuse and I think h knows I wouldn't tolerate any BS.  Family or no family, you choose to stay or leave when you get hit first....you should always leave.|`|ENsdS2N6aa	Not really, most abused women don't even tell their family what's going on in their relationship, until it's too late.|`|djUMvICoaa	No family is never around anyway, it has nothing to do with the temperament of the guy.|`|dlGZebDmaa	Doesn't matter if you have family or not. Look at Rhianna.
GhML3DyIaa	Yes it is, either they don't know how you feel inside or they are feeling awful inside themselves. Sometimes they yell at you for your own good if you've done something stupid.|`|B12E4rYiaa	This kind of relationship is a love hate relationship and is dysfunctional it only gets worse not better without counseling for both parties. Too much baggage on both sides.|`|EM5rQOGBaa	it is possible but it not right , some people av different ways of dealing with things like when people are upset sum will comfort u , other will tell u 2 stop crying,my mum is the tough love kind who thinks what doesn't kill u only makes u stonger which is prob why am like dat in someways when it comes 2 break ups , i don't think some1 should yell at u when ur upset cus thats just plain nasty|`|djUMvICoaa	It's possible but it's a sick and twisted love.  Pure love isn't like that, but love you settle for thinking you won't find better is a trap a lot of people fall into.  They have strong feelings for the person, love from the heart. but end up yelling at them for dumb things, hate from the brain.  Remember love is a strong emotion and most people have trouble walking away for that reason, it overrides the brains common sense.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Yes definitely.  Some people just have anger issues and don't know how to properly express their love.  My aunt is always yelling at her daughters, but they are her world.  Unfortunately she's pushing them away with her abusive behavior.|`|rX4ti0Nsaa	oh absolutely yes.  women who get punched in the face by their husbands still love them and wouldn't eve think of leaving them|`|AA11359690	I agree with Dougals B.  This is not true love.  When you care and love someone then you can never yell at them.  My husband yells at me when he is even a little bit upset but I have seen him laughing with otehrs at the same time.  If you are suspicious about love then it does not exist.|`|ZtHamUrzaa	YES
yThJq8Dyaa	That's stupid of him. Re-evaluate your relationship with him and pose him the question if he really loves you or not. To cope you should write down your feelings, paint, draw, exercise, and or pray. Talk to true friends and try nature walks. They relax you and allow you to time to think clearly.|`|9tcTtw6Vaa	If he needs to be "free" before he marries you then he's obviously not ready right now. Maybe he will be at some point, but maybe not...and you need to make decisions that are right for you. It may feel like getting back together with him is the right thing, but if he's not ready, then maybe you need to step back and figure out where this relationship is really headed.|`|ztxkW7WKaa	dump him he's stupid. he wants to see other people before he marries u, what kind of crap is that??? Sorry i just got a little angry.<br>  I think u should see other people because he is obviously seeing other people.|`|OEATSehSaa	maybe he is doing this because he realy loves you.he may have a reason and dont want to hurt your feelings|`|AA11324847	Sorry, anyone who loves you will never WANT to be away from you guy OR girl. "space" is an excuse I don't care what anybody says.|`|AA10250756	Sounds like he has cold feet. On the other hand, you don't want to marry someone who really is not sure he wants to marry you. I suggest you say okay and you also date other men. I don't know how old the two of you are, which does make a difference, but it sounds to me like he does not enjoy the long distance relationship and wants to date other women. This is something that happens frequently when one person in a relationship goes out of town to go to college. They usually do find someone else, so be prepared for that, and you should go out with other men as well.
RtxKqeMFaa	I suggest u get new friends. Or maybe talk to Your guidance counsellor for help.|`|YmwzubmFaa	give her a suprise vist one weekend, phone her mum/dad and ask them if its okay for you to stay and surprise her :D

Is it long, short, bob cut what? If its long and you always wear it down you could consider doing an elegant up sweep. It could be curled or flat ironed with a flower stuck at the side. Wearing a fringe can be really classy or sophisticated as well.<br>  <br>  If its short you could have it curled, wear it out of your face, do a pixie cut if its needing a cut, have it streaked or coloured. Your best bet would be to consult a hairstylist to see which would best suite your face. <br>  <br>  If you can't afford one have one of your best mates come over and you experiment with the suggestions you get here and have her vote. Hope I helped.|`|aipChC3haa	Your mom should be the prettiest one there!<br>  I would put it up like this, keep it low key and let your mom let her moment:<br>  <a href="http://www.women-hairstyles.com/images/half-updo.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.women-hairstyles.com/images/h...</a><br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.visual-makeover.com/images/Blog/UpDo-Hairstyle.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.visual-makeover.com/images/Bl...</a>|`|2LmfQUbKaa	i think curles are very pertty split your hair in the front down the middle and curl aroung in tight curls it will be great!
XlOZRYWwaa	I know it may seem hard. I have a child from a previous relationship and my husband had a hard time at first. When my ex started dating the women he is now enagaged to I was awful to her. After a while I realized how incredibly immature and ridiculous I was being and that my behavior was non productive as well as bad for my son. This may sound lame, but can you write her a letter explaining why the way she is acting is hurtful to her child and takes away from responsability as a mother? She sounds like a very hurtful, insecure person. I know I felt horrible for the way I had acted ( though it wasnt any where as mean as what your describing. I would never invovle my son in name calling) Maybe in time she will see how stupid she is being. And not loving the child like he is your own is terrible advice. Your a family. Love each other as a whole, not by an individual basis.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Stepping is not for the weak.  I wouldn't do it from all of the terrible stories I hear.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	That's one of the challenges of being a step mom, unfortunately your situation is even more challenging.  Just remember that your step-son and his mother are separate people.  He can love you even if she doesn't.   Teach him to respect you and never call you names, even if she is disrespectful.  You have to consciously make a point to give him hugs and kisses at those very moments that you feel yourself drawing away.  When he sees you overcoming the intimacy barrier, it will teach him through example that he can do it too.|`|UGOse5Dvaa	Where is Dad in all this?<br>  <br>  Is he a man or a mouse?<br>  He should squeak up!<br>  <br>  This woman is doing this to drive a wedge between you and those you care about.<br>  <br>  If you back away from the stepson, doesn't she win?<br>  <br>  How about this: your husband grows a spine and gets control of this situation by showing support for his wife and son against any and all that seek to cause problems.<br>  <br>  Or: dump this spineless bags of corn meal and find a someone that will stand up for his family.<br>  <br>  You know: like a real man does.|`|AA11785285	You may be the step mother, honey, but there is nothing written anywhere that you must take verbal abuse.<br>  <br>  However, when you married this guy, all this baggage came with him... that's why lots of women and men never marry anyone with children from a previous relationship.... just tooooooooooo much drama.<br>  <br>  The kids and the ex, really are your husband's problem, not yours.  Don't try to discipline this kid, and for sure don't treat him as if he were yours.  He isn't.  And as he enters his teen years, you are going to have difficulties avoiding comments from him such as, "I don't have to listen to you, you aren't even my real mom!!!"  Oh, yes, hon.  I promise.<br>  <br>  So make no errors like that now.  Dad makes the rules, and dad carries them out, and dad deals with the ex.  His baggage, his problem.<br>  <br>  And your life will feel much better.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	I get you. I was in the same boat. It sounds like your step son is young if he is calling you names because of his mom. I went through this with my step son as well. I also pulled back from him. I was still nice to him, but I was more of an observer than a participant.<br>  All I can say is keep telling yourself it's not his fault. He is a kid stuck in the middle, and with time it will get better. My step son was 3. He would call me names, say I smacked him, and was mean to him and I know it was to make his mom happy. This did go on for a few years, but as he got older and realized I wasn't the wicked woman his mom made me out to be he came around. Keep trying to interact with him. Play games with him, read with him, and hang in there. It will get better. I can't say how his ex will be with time. I know my husband's ex girlfriend calmed down some when she found a new man.<br>  Good Luck..<br>  <br>  I wanted to add:<br>  I don't know if you have children of your own, but once I did, I realized how moldable young children can be. Since he is 2 the more you have fun with him, the more he will come to like you. He will still feel pulled by his loyalty to his mom, but it will set up some invaluable groundwork for when he is older. My step son is almost 15 now. We get along good, but we still aren't as close as we could be if I had just ignored his mother and been more open with him. What his mother is doing is terrible, and you feel like you are suffering the brunt of it, but in reality he is. Maybe remind yourself of that too. it may help you connect with him. He's a victim in all of this...the more happy memories you can make with him, the easier it will be to not think of his mom when you are with him.
NRyNbgnZaa	I personally believe emotional is worse. <br>    Your physical health can nearly always improve, but emotional scars never go away. You can never forget the pain you have undergone emotionally, and there is nothing in the world that can compare to it.|`|fwLW0cUQaa	emotional because it tears up all ur insides, and it is always there and never goes away. plus its harder for loved ones to notice because its easier to hide so u sit there hiding it forever keeping it bottled up, getting worse and worse, making u feel like ur gonna explode.it kills ur hopes and dreams and makes u feel like a worthless piece of crap.personally i think it hurts worse. it can also drive one to physically abuse themselves|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	Both are bad.|`|XzicOcyeaa	well both suck obviously.<br>  i'd have to say that in my personal opinion only, emotional abuse is worse. Having been subjected to it for a part of my life i know that i would much have prefered the perpetrators to actually have hit me at times, rather then going through the phsycological trauma which will most likely stay with me forever. My reason for this was that at least then the pain would have been external, rather then in my head driving me crazy if you know what i mean. Please keep in mind that i was very messed up at the time and not thinking straight. Obviously emotional/physical abuse is a very serious issue, and i mean no offence to anyone with this answer. My perspective now, being in a healthy state of mind, is that it would completley depend on the situation.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Emotional abuse is worse. However I'm going to cheat a little by saying that the emotional scars that come with physical abuse are the most damaging part of the physical abuse.|`|l7VVNBrIaa	Physical cause it involves emotional abuse as well.  Think about it: an abuser doesn't slap you and act nice at the same time.|`|t7jiSmjVaa	Emotional abuse because physical scares can heal where as emotional scares are long remembered.|`|bmhT1IrTaa	physical can cause emotional as well. <br>  but if you think about it emotional can cause selfinflicted physical abuse as well<br>  based on personal experience i would say emotional <br>  <br>  my dad used to beat the snit outa my sister and that made her stronger<br>  i was forced to watch, and that left me with a crying problem<br>  anytime someone yells at me in a certain way, i freak out and cant control my crying<br>  its all good now, were teens and we help each other through our problems<br>  sisters are important|`|rJCkXOMAaa	I'll say physical because in a way your are being emotionally abuse when ur being physically abuse because I' went througth it also <br>  <br>  Please answer my question  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvEaQZRuEp6SFt5usOYli57sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306172843AAdIFyd">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|2SHBgVEiaa	any type of abuse is bad.but in my personal opinion, emotional scars take much longer to heal. physical wounds can heal in a few days, emotional wounds can take months, years, or may never fully heal.|`|KBL1t21taa	emotional<br>  <br>  although physical abuse DOES come with emotional trauma, emotional is so hard to shake off|`|sq3fDsiJaa	I personally would say emotional, because physical injuries can heal, but its the emotional injuries that can really mess someone up!!<br>  (trust me I would know...)|`|DOUWdX9Oaa	both are pretty messed up
LknYI7FFaa	Hugs, a shoulder for him to cry on. Be there for him to talk to. Let him know that he isn't alone that your there for him. My dad killed himself 22 years ago. Its a very hard thing to go through. But I had one good friend who was there for me. And still is to this day when I need to call her up and talk to. A good friend is what he needs right now.|`|NDbhRbFJaa	Be nice to him, but not too nice. No one likes pity.
rX4ti0Nsaa	try being active in your church. they usually have stuff going on and appreciate volunteers. whether its for the youth group or a couples thing, they could use the help.  sometimes only the ladies show up to the couples group and offer advice. ( their husbands are working) or you can find groups that are interested in things you like. your on the computer, look for them|`|njgF24Tbaa	I stayed in because I'm sick and didn't sleep last night due to nasal congestion.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	Well, here I am, on the computer answering your question.  You know what?  Marriage has this way of making people feel lonely sometimes.  It can feel like a box, where you subvert your true self for the sake of this unit.  It shouldn't be that way - freedom of expression should not die with marriage, but it happens sometimes anyways.  I only recommend finding other outlets to help yourself through the lonely times.  Good luck!!|`|djUMvICoaa	What do you feel that you are missing, having babies, moving to big cities or having someone to confide in?  Wait, where is your hubby, don't you confide in him?  Don't you know how to make a baby? What is your problem?  Hit that power switch and go seduce the sucker, do things that will drive him crazy.  You are only going to be a loser if you allow yourself to  be one and that can happen in little town or big city.  So do your thing and change what you don't like.|`|m4yvTqj1aa	What is it you think you should be doing? Is not loving your husband enough? If you like a friend you can im me|`|D3hYbsVJaa	This happens. Your friend set will change. They have their own lives to lead and choices to make.

On the other end of your story though.  I left and moved on to a "bigger better city", got a cool job, got married and have a baby.  I'm still home on a sat night.  I think it's just the way it goes with friends.  When I got married, I was different from my friends who were single, and now with a kiddo I'm different from the people who don't have kids.  I know if I ever really needed any of "my girls"  I could call and they would talk.   But when I complain about being sleepy due to a crabby sick 2 year old and they complain about the "new guy" not calling back since thursday...its just different.  But you're not the only loser...lol!|`|tawgKlOpaa	Cheer up sweet pea!<br>  I want you to know that you are the absolute best!<br>  You are everything that is lovely in the world!|`|qBjF0hjIaa	I enjoy cream cheese danishes and Dr. Scholls wart removers.
Qsu6OSqwaa	You break up because you are immature and you really do not know what you have until it is gone.  My husband and I got married when we both were in our twenties, nine months later welcome to the world unexpected beautiful baby boy, along with a move to the in-laws put a strain on a new marriage that crumbled like a wet cookie.  So we got divorced, matured a lot and realized what a HUGE mistake we had both made.  Now we are married again with a new perspective on our relationship, why it failed the first time and what we do every day to prevent it from happening again.  True love will always prevail and God knows best whether we do or not.|`|081168f28573ebfa7f89cf91f00a1e36aa	Most do it out of fear. You are talking to the #1 break up and get back together girl. I love my man but I've been on my own for so long, so it's hard for me to realize that it's just not me and it's us now. Couples have to learn how to compromise, to get to the next level.|`|dlGZebDmaa	The process happens slowly. Both show their best selves when they start dating and that's what they keep as the first impression which obviously makes a strong impression.<br>  The fights start but both think that they will go back to that first stage.<br>  It's like an addiction. Love is a chemical either way.|`|OEATSehSaa	its because after a while they remember why they make it the first time and they also remember all the good times they have been through together maybe and the bad times which means care and true love|`|9KOuOEy9aa	Because they are immature, which is why it happens in high school so much.  If they are out of high school they need to grow the fudge up.|`|fGtIMyMXaa	Yes they love each other and they also know they loose more when they broke up.|`|DOUWdX9Oaa	because they really care for eachother...|`|rX4ti0Nsaa	yeah... or maybe they're not getting it as much as they use to and figure once month is better none at all.|`|8WQXu4T7aa	They break becos both their love is not balanced.Either one is in more love or the other is less. when they expect the same love from their partners, there arise the problem.<br>  Mostly they bond together, becos they dont want to try once again with another partner. And mostly as Indian women accept the insult as they dont have anyone to take care in society.<br>  This scenario has to change and has to understand each other.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	It's because they are immature.|`|J7GTIE5raa	many different reasons.<br>  one reason is because you really dont know what you got until its gone. and some people believe that after they have broken up, they realize that they would be better off with each other.<br>  <br>  they need time to grow and mature, better themselves|`|EM5rQOGBaa	this it a stupid 1 which av say av done in the past myself , think thers alot reasons,like<br>  * not wanna to give in so easy <br>  * thinking they can sort it out now they have time to think when 9 times out 10 they can't<br>  * it better to be in a crap relationship than nt be in 1 at all<br>  *think they love them when really they don't <br>  * think they won't get any1 else ( which is wot i thought as bf at time told me i was fat,ugly & who would want go out wif u ?)<br>  <br>  i don't think it can work out the second time as most the reasons u split in 1st place will still be there,<br>  <br>  i have never knowen any1 to split & get back together it work out for them|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Because a lot of times, it takes losing something to realize what you had. They learn the grass isn't any greener on the other side. <br>  <br>  There are couples who repeatedly break up and get back together. Those couples are co-dependant and need counseling.|`|djUMvICoaa	The head tells them to get out but that one emotion we have, one of the strongest to man, love, gets people missing something they once had.  When the heart is empty it is so easy to recall what we once had and have those heart strings tugged on real hard, so hard to override the logic of the  brain and give it one more try.  Usually with the same results.|`|BlA60kDVaa	Remembrance?

UHfA9yHPaa	She sounds really sensitive. Which I'm not surprised by.<br>  <br>  And it is kind of creepy to have someone watch you eat, but if you're just looking at them while eating at the dinner table and talking there's nothing wrong with it. <br>  <br>  Tell her that you're there to support her and you aren't judging her. You're her friend, after all.<br>  <br>  But because you're her friend, it's not really up to you to make her decisions for her. Willpower comes from within, and sometimes no matter how much you goad or try to persuade someone to do something, they refuse to do it unless they themselves actually WANT to.<br>  <br>  However, if you feel that it is really serious, like this girl is on the verge of getting diabetes...you could set her down for a serious talk. Tell her that you're concerned for her health and you don't want to see her dying prematurely. Tell her you are there for her all the way. <br>  <br>  If she keeps snacking and etc after the talk, then you should probably step aside|`|T01cXWwmaa	Maybe you can try doing it together like going on a diet WITH her even though you already said you lost alot of weight already it can't hurt to eat healthy :) I have a friend who wants to loose weight but can't seem to stop eating so me and some of our other friends are doing it with her and she's lost quite a bit so far|`|coPtU10Laa	Tell your Friend you love her and wouldn't change her for the world but your trying to get healthy and when she eats all this junk food around you it makes it hard for you to stay on your diet. You would like it if she would diet with you but that's her decision but please don't make it harder for you.|`|L1EnPN67aa	Hmm, I had a similar situation, but it wasn't with weight. Perhaps she is jealous of you. You should tell her she'd have a better chance of getting a boyfriend (because everyone has emotional needs). I would still be nice and understanding toward her, but if she doen't treat you like she supposed to after awhile you'll get sick of her and you'll probably just go hang out with other thin people. lol Just try to connect with her a little more about her weight- like tell her that she is going to regret no dieting when she starts having blood sugar probs, not saying all over weight people do, but there is a possiblity, Hope she gets herself checked out regularly, because that's really unhealthy to be 300 pounds.<br>  <br>   I wish you guys the best.|`|gT0SJYfnaa	The next time she says you are making her feel "self-concious", you tell her she's not "self-concious" enough or she would be taking better care of herself.  Tell her to take a long look at herself in a large mirror and decide if that is her life or she wants something better.  Don't let her drag yo down into cheesecake with her.|`|FSEmskNraa	just tell her that ur not judging her and you feel like it best for you to change your lifestyle or eating habits because it is whats best for you. just make sure you let her know that you like no matter how she chooses to be. just try to be understanding to her feelings and opinons. good luck!|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Doesn't sound like she's ready to be helped; if she ever is ready, she will come to you. But with someone who is as obese as she is, I think she needs professional help first and foremost. <br>  <br>  Just continue to be her friend, and politely suggest healthier snacks or healthier alternatives when you go out to eat. <br>  <br>  Good luck! And good luck to her!|`|AA10731562	tell her that you care about her and help her get a good diet. If she says something like that then say something to insult her (not to be mean) to like get her mad so then she is like "fine i will start to lose weight". Then at the end tell her you didnt really mean to insult her.

XjBKV2ohaa	I think I know a little of what you're going through, because that sounds similar to the kind of relationship I had with my two brothers (one older, one younger) when I was a child and a teenager.<br>  <br>  What I found was that as we got into our early 20's and shed some immaturity, we started to develop new relationships between ourselves.  We're all close buddies, now (in our 40's and 50's).<br>  <br>  Some things about your brother will probably change as he matures - maybe he will start to become more comfortable with himself, and won't feel the need to have such disparate faces in private and in public.  Other things may never change - speaking before thinking, for example, and being prideful.  But that doesn't mean you can't have a good relationship with him.  Give it some time.
BqqDJXkjaa	Well dating is putting your self out there and getting hurt happens,so I think the only reason you shouldn't do this is if you are worried about work.

In the end, I made him very sad that he made me afraid, and I ended up losing him. <br>  <br>  If you like this guy, go for it. You know it doesn't matter what people say. It's very important to protect yourself, but don't make the same mistake I did. I hope this helped and good luck!|`|C5bhtFXpaa	The best thing to do is ask him something you know he'll lie about  a few times and see what it looks like when he's lying.

This just sounds fishy to me.  In my experience, if a man refuses to take you somewhere like this it is because he's up to no good.  If you don't want to take the chance of starting an argument, send a couple of your girls in to "spy" for you.  I would definitely look into this though.|`|x2EBjOataa	ask him|`|0tZqkiDdaa	Since you guys are bf&gf, I think that he should be more than happy to take you out to the club with him. I don't know what he is really thinking....maybe he just won't feel comfortable and needs to be there on his own, with his guy friends...but still... i don't buy it! BC he should want to be with YOU. You are nice to even let him dance with other girls. I know I would not tolerate that. GOOD LUCK hun! <br>  ~Just talking to him will make him change the way he feels about this problem~

e7KoyoWsaa	when he asks, before you give it to him, make sure there is an understanding that he will return the favor.  A verbal contract.  When you ask him for the laptop, if he refuses, don't make a big deal about it, just remind him in a pleasant tone that next time you won't be so accommodating.  Then, when he asks from you the next time, simply refuse.  No arguments, no justifications.  Let him know he can have it if he really commits to sharing.  If it happens again, stop being nice and just refuse it from him.<br>  <br>  Don't yell, and don't loose your temper.  It's not an argument of a fight that needs to be one, it's an understanding that needs to be met.  Him loosing it is simply showing he can't make that understanding and he should get no reward from it.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Tell your mum<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Could you please answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307190603AAvQ6mU">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|0AUPrCMZaa	easy, say no.  eventually he will catch the drift.|`|cOce5YbRaa	Your brother sounds a little immature. If I was you, next time he asks for the laptop, I would tell him no for a change and let him see how it feels. It will probably shock him since you always let him use it. When he asks you why you won't let him have it or if he throws a fit about it I would tell him "See-this is how it feels when I ask you and you scream no at me everytime." Sometimes when you give someone just a little bit of their own medicine they will quit being so selfish and spoiled.|`|USsjb7YLaa	next time he ask you to use urs be like hell no foo u dont let me use urs then beak out in a wrestling fight and put him in a head lock untill he agrees to let you use his laptop|`|J6o0ZYAHaa	do the same thing to him

The more you do it, the less your body will think you're choking.|`|xQn3rR6Naa	You can't get rid of your gag reflex. The only thing you could do would be to use a medical grade anesthetic spray on the back of your throat. This of course would remove your ability to swallow properly and and result in choking and aspiration . This reflex is there to protect your life.|`|0PdYYeBFaa	I understand what you mean about the gagging reflex. I don't know if this helps but when i find myself having a lot of saliva in my mouth which could possibly piss me off when i am trying to indulge in giving my husband oral.

Maybe she had plans and shes trying to figure out what she wants to do... Don't go crazy because she didn't answer you asap, maybe you asked her at a bad time, don't think negative, it makes things worse. If she really did feel that way just have a back up plan, like asking someone else or don't rely so much on her answer.

Just because she didnt answer doesnt mean shes doesnt want to! Give her time, she may be thinking omg he finally asked me out! And was jsut too shy to say yes in person.

Remember no matter what you do right now she really does know her answer, she isn't really "thinking" ... being a girl I know there really is no way to tell this one unless you know the person, it's one of the 2 extremes ... she either really does want to go out with you and wants to make sure she can handle it she doesn't want to seem to eager and just scream yes OR she's figuring out a way to say no ... in a nice way. You can never know what she's thinking but be calm I'm sure no matter what happens she cares about you enough to think of the best response for the both of you. Hope this helps.|`|HaXknQDaaa	Since you guys are close friends, it is probably hard for her to take in all at once.  She might feel the same way that you do but you can't push it. Let her take her time in deciding out what she wants to do. It will all work out for the best, and if it doesn't work out between you guys your friendship is to close for anything to be ruined.|`|2kox7VKlaa	In my opinion, she is just as confused as you are. I think in this situation that she either liked you before and you never seemed interested in her so she got over you and liking you that way. when you asked her, it caught her off guard and she needs to discuss it with her friends or she is not sure she wants to go out with you and ruin the friendship she has with you.
Kyokb1AIaa	Bro... first of all and only from what you have shared your relationship was build on falsehood/make believe/ lies. So you could make an argument about that. However, as for being the man, I"m assuming that you asked her to marry you, which means that you pursued her. What did you see in her. What made you decided after 5 months of dating that you want to marry her. These are the things that should be going through your mind.<br>  Lets say that your fiancee didn't have RA and you guys go on and get married. What would you do and how would you react if you found out that she had RA after being married. Are you going to quite on her? Did you marry her for Love or for your personal pleasure.? these are thee things that I have to wonder. I'm not judging you, but you really have to challenge your character and integrity. Bottom line is she worth it to serve her and love her the rest of your life, OR cut her loose while your still early into it. B/c remember you initiated! Be the man and see that your LOVE meets her where she is..<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Take what you can and leave what you don't need from this!<br>  <br>  Cheer!|`|0AShsMsoaa	oh for petes sakes, get their resume and medical records before you buy a ring.  <br>  <br>  you smell  strange milk in the fridge before you drink it, dont you?|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	call it off you are not inlove with her and that is sad. but if you did love her all that stuff wouldn't bother you so move on and say good bye yes its too bad you had given her ring but i would take it back and move on.|`|n68tCJ7zaa	call it off<br>  <br>  you obviously don't LOVE her, so don't put her through the trauma of dealing with a person like you<br>  <br>  look, attraction is a necessary part of a relationship, and if that is keeping you from loving her, then so be it.<br>  <br>  if her condition is an obstacle for your love, then so be it. it might be shallow, but it's the truth.|`|Likst1Mxaa	If you don't like her much now you won't like her at all in a few months. Just break up with her now and save yourselves some heartache.|`|AA11996507	Break up with her.

She rides her harley, works full time for the government and enjoys out door activities. Going to take her sky diving this year.  Yes, she hurts and yes she was told to limit herself. But the thing with life, if you want to live it, you have to do it. <br>  <br>  So in reality, you are putting a limit to this girl's life by thinking she has a disability that will only limit her life to boredom. That is very wrong.<br>  <br>  Now her lying to do you, I agree with. That is wrong. But, maybe she got tired of people judging her conditions that she figured only way to get someone to see her for who she is to actually lie to them first.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't of asked her after 5 months. You shouldn't of asked a girl for marriage even 2 and half months into the relationship.<br>  <br>  You are at fault for alot of it too. <br>  <br>  She can find better.<br>  <br>  Best you two split and go on with your lifes.|`|3gljWitCaa	look<br>  if you want to break it off then do so<br>  but dont do it because she has medical problem, thats just pathetic<br>  <br>  but if you're not in love with her 110% dont get married, itll just hurt yu both in the long run<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  hollyy|`|S0n3DinFaa	First off you were engaged to early.

If you're so hot- no let me say something differently- If you got engaged within 5 months obviously there is something there...That's pretty quick to me to say you want to spend your life someone. I'd rather wait for at least 2 years, personally. No need of jumping in commitments...there are too many options, opportunites and options out here. <br>  <br>  I wish you both the best. ;)|`|q84KT11saa	As rough as her condition/situation is.  You shouldn't stay with her just because you feel bad for her.  If you already have your doubts, then she probably isn't the one.  Besides, 5 months is not a long time, to be jumping into things.  If I were you, I would call it quits now and move on.  Especially if you think your just going to get married and end up calling it off anyway.  This will save you some paper work.
7LS5HmFjaa	When friends go out, it is to spend time together. Is ist possible that she may have wanted one on one time with you. Perhaps she was jealous of the other friend therefore felt justified to not give you her total attention. If the friendship is worth saving to you, let her know so. Have a heart to heart talk with her....agreeing ahead of time to answer phone only if it's an emergency. If that is difficult at this time consider a note or card in the mail. Focus on the good in your friendship and given time you will have it back.|`|0kqMU4ySaa	that is really hard but if u were to exclude her more often she would realize that it was rude to be on the phone...you might not hang out for a few days but she will get over it if she is a really good friend|`|da1naDaOaa	No you aren't being unreasonable. That is really annoying when ppl do that. But it sounds like she realized she was wrong so maybe give her another chance.|`|YSOOvYzoaa	u shud let her do wat she feels..<br>  act like it doesnt bother you and move on.<br>  it'll make her look like an a**.|`|fpS90nx4aa	i dont think its unreasonable only because i know where your coming from and i agree that putting down the phone and giving me some attention isnt too much to ask for but there r girls out there that are phone addicts and sometimes it is too much to ask for
ijLewIjnaa	You say you two are best friends.  Part of a friendship that close is being able to trust and support one another.  I'm sure you have confided many secrets, thoughts, beliefs, ideas into her and you deserve the same treatment.  However, you may want to think carefully about why she lied.  She most likely had no intentions of hurting you on purpose and she probably did not really WANT to lie to her best friend.  But perhaps she has some insecurities or issues that need to be dealt with, especially by her own best friend, you.  She may feel the need to create lies about her social life to overcome her insecurities and seem like a popular, loved girl.  My advice to you would be to immediately sit her down and talk to her.  Tell her that you two are the best of friends and that you know for a fact that she has been lying to you for a while.  Tell her that as her best friend, you deserve nothing but the truth and that you will be understanding as to her reason why.  Be supportive, calm, and caring...there is definitely some secret she is hiding as to why she is behaving this way.  Ask her what it was that made her lie to you and try to solve her situation with her...together.  Best friends are key in life because they help each other grow stronger through support and trust.  Be there for her in her time of need.<br>  Good luck, dudette (:|`|tU5NJVL3aa	YOU don't want to ruin your friendship, but she is willing to base it all on lies... to me that's a strange choice.  So, given that you want to stay friends I guess you first need to be sure that you really want to confront her.  If you still do, then my approach would be to just lay it on the table -- tell her you don't feel it will affect your friendship but you are dying of curiosity and want to know why she made it all up.|`|UHfA9yHPaa	Um, but it's not like she lied to get you to do something. She lied to make herself feel better, but not to hurt anyone. <br>  <br>  I don't see what's the big deal about pretending you have some boyfriend out of town. It makes people feel better about themselves, so be it. If I were you I'd just keep quiet about it.|`|da1naDaOaa	if she was a real best friend she wouldn't have lied to you in the first place...

Try hanging out with him when your friends are there so that you get comfortable around him and when the timing is Perfectt ask him just how he feels. Trust me this really works.|`|jyMWGdGQaa	ohh man  i have this problem too.. im telling ya i always end up thinking im in love because all the think about is my crush... but then i like another guy and i end up tinking about them all the time. love is rough buisness but i  think you tell this kid u like him.. it will make u feel better and f he dsnt like u it wasnt ment to be , but u will find that special guy one day : )|`|BU5jkgZAaa	It's normal to think about him,<br>  you like him, <br>  it might also be because you know you don't have him yet <br>  so the more you want him, the more you'll think of him|`|OEATSehSaa	that you like him ofcourse.jsut get to know him.and open yourself to him so he will get to know you too|`|Bo1FHj88aa	LOL!

But more likely hat u re jus obsessed with it. U ll get over it and stop thinking about him all the time soon. It jus keeps running in your mind cuz u cant get him for now. U now, people always want what they are unable to get haha. Dont ask him out, these guys on yahoo always keep pushing girls to ask a guy out which it totally crap. Try to know if he likes you through other means like how he talks to u. And try to get t know him more. Because there are so many cases where u jus crush on someone without knowing anything about them. And later when u really get to know them, u discover that he wasnt realy the one u thought he was. And in that case, if u confess to him now, its a waste of courage and pride. Well... try to understand urself more and goodluck|`|e3c42ef395315308e4c8b36f63f9c038aa	it means that you have a really big crush on him.. you cannot say that you are already inlove with him because love is a very different thing..<br>  <br>  so why don't you ask him (the way a woman would do) if he likes you back.. if he does well good for you and if he doesn't, atleast you got everything clear..<br>  <br>  if you really can't approach him why don't you ask somebody you really trust to do it for you..<br>  <br>  goodluck..|`|f34f90B9aa	That means you really wanna be with him. And just go for it. To make it easier,  you should ask as a joke and say ,"hey do you have me (and start laughing) :]]|`|NVElNdBHaa	you are simply infatuated.|`|sxnt92moaa	Lol obviously you like him?<br>  Hahahahaha.. that's what it means.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Have a friend ask him if he likes you?|`|aXEj8WmMaa	you just like him! lol simple as that. everyone does that:)|`|YQOEppNnaa	It means that you have a crush on your crush. duh?

m16gf9mzaa	First off, I think you need to finish high school or get a GED. Trust me, it will really help you support your kids if you have any with this guy. Second thing is, the reason I said that, is because if you had finished school you probably would have taken a history class or two plus a civics class that would have taught you about this little principle of the U.S. Constitution, called the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Faith_and_Credit_Clause" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Faith_...</a> will tell you more about it, but what it means is that, amongst other things, if you are married in one state, you are married in all the states.  <br>  <br>  You wanna marry this guy, when he's already married? Make sure you see the divorce papers before you sign on the dotted line.  If he can't find her, he had better find himself a decent lawyer.  Also, if he ends up doing unto you what he's doing unto his first wife, don't be surprised.|`|djUMvICoaa	How can he still be married to his ex?|`|QaTrgghWaa	If the guy is still married then the answer to your question is......NO, you cannot get married to him.  He has to get a legal divorce from his current wife.  <br>  <br>      If he was to marry you, this would be considered bigamy and is a crime in every state.  So it dosen't matter at all if you two married in a different state than he married his "ex" in.<br>  <br>       My question for you, is why is he even seeing you if he is still married?  Most people who are serious about a new person would divorce the first one, before becoming engaged to another.  It could be that he is not in a big hurry to divorce his current wife, for whatever reason......may sound mean, but just something to think about.|`|Ar2XADGOaa	No, that's called polygamy he needs to get completely divorced with papers from a court to prove he is divorced otherwise to marry someone else in the mean time is illegal.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Nope, he has to get divorced first.
M7dcTAEzaa	I think you should change groups<br>  what's the point in hanging out with people who make you bored and have nothing to talk about?<br>  Your best friend sounds like a friend i know. Sometimes she is happy and hyper, sometimes she is moody and mean (doesn't care about anyone).<br>  Give your best friend some time to think about things (whatever she is thinking about), but if she continues to be moody and everything, DO SOMETHING. I know exactly how  you feel. If she isnt talking to anyone it's sorta her OWN problem if she doesn't want support. But if you really want to stay with her, talk to her, but if she doesnt listen, leave. What's the point in worrying about something that won't change?|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Yes, you should give your depressed friend some time until she is ready to talk to you.  If your friends cannot accept for who you are since that they ditched you, then why waste your time?  You deserve better friends out there.

Also whenever you guys are together try to do fun stuff together, play old skool games (those are fun trust me), be silly with each other, do something outside the routine you may or may not have.

I have been with my boyfriend for three years, and I also wish that he would "sweep me off my feet." I have thought about breaking up with him because of it before, but I know that it would be stupid. There is nothing wrong with your relationship really, but if you are bored with a four year relationship, how are you going to live with a 40 year wedding anniversary, if you get married. You should talk to him, and plan something special, though it depends on how old you are. My older sister, who is nineteen, planned a trip to a lodge, and took her boyfriend for four days. They connected a lot, and I could tell they were closer than before, and they haven't had sex either. Really, planning something special usually helps.|`|d617gOaUaa	It's completely normal. You should talk to him, tell him you feel like everythings a routine and he's neglecting you and you want a change. Go on a road trip together, or go to the beach. Quality quality quality time. You don't need money for that. You don't have to change and your relationship does not need help just a little boost. A friend of mine once told me that in long term relationships it's when you start THINKING of cheating thats when the relationship is coming to an end.|`|83zdK7xDaa	After four years, I would think you'd want to be married by now.  If not, then break it off, because you're just wasting your time and his.  Pain is inevitable at that point.
KaF0nNFmaa	It's long distance!  Stop answering your phone and responding to his e-mail.  Give him the message you are serious and mean business, and don't give in if you want to end it.  Otherwise you will give mixed messages and it'll be harder to get rid of him.|`|8uvLG8Lbaa	you have to end it. my case was a lot different, but you both have to move on|`|PeJnA85Raa	It sounds like you have serious doubts about the relationship, so you should just end it. Staying together longer won't change your feelings, and you'll be happier once it's over! You should just tell him how you feel, and even though he doesn't agree, you're not happy.It's not fair to you to keep continuing in the relationship because he isn't ready to let go just yet.|`|KOjVWXOCaa	Tell him that you are sorry but its not going to work out. If he continues to pursue you, ignore his calls and all his messages. He can not make you stay with him. If he began to stalk you notify police.|`|kSEO2w8Aaa	Long distance sucks because you can REALLY REALLY love the guy but still drift apart.. and later down the road you look back and can't believe you let him slip away!|`|wdNl0BB6aa	do what you want to do. <br>  plus he made you pay for anything..find a guy with money that will treat his girl right.|`|7VmIgqviaa	well i've been in 3 long-distance relationship they don't work out. i dated a guy for 7 months and he lived two states away like 11 hour drive and he always made an excuse to not come see me. our relationship went horrible and i gained nothing and was emotionally hurt a lot.<br>  save your self and dump the guy. it's soo not worth it especially if you don't want to be with him.|`|uvj8kbD0aa	yeah i say leave 'em......cant you see that you are allowing hime to leach off of you??? of course he doesnt want to break up cause he will lose his backup lifestyle.|`|5o5cprtVaa	ya it does if u have da right phone. likeLOL WAIT  OMG|`|1oKardRKaa	ok this is my personal expireince: i went out with a guy over a couple of years like around seven. now he is a u.s military marine. our relationship started out good with some good and bad. you know like a normal relationship.  ever since he left to another country he started doing everything possible to keep me with him, and when he would come down he would spend it with me and everything but that was just at the beginning. as soon as he started getting used to the enviroment and the people around i started noticing that he would call, write, or message me less and less everyday.  and even if he did call me evry once in a while we would argue a lot. point blank is that it really didnt work at all. i found out that he was with someone else after so many lies while him being over there and that he ws using me to his advantage for when he was here where i am.  you problem is that he is also using you.  and the reason being why he dosent want to let go is because he knows that he has something to run back to in time to do whatever he wants whether its for pleasure or money.  all you siply need to do is just tell him straight out " look im getting bored, i barely hear from you , im starting to loose interest, this is hard, i cant take it and i simply think that this is not working out and i really need to just keep things different between me and you becus u r in a different place and i dont know wats up regardless whether i trust you or not" tell him like that and he would eventually understand and if he still keeps on persisting on it you do the same. tell him that no is no.|`|pU6fvgvIaa	I have been in the same situation two years ago. If he is a man, he will come to you and prove it. If he loves you he will show you. Either you go with him to that other country or he comes to you, or break loose. There's is no other way. If he has been there for three months, you need to see if he has anyone else there with him instead of you. Be careful cause I had the same problem only he was 6000 miles away, and had a gf for five years, and was flirting with me on the phone for another two years! I was sssssssooooooooooo heart broken, I was so in love with him too. But, I think you should fly to him if you can if you want your relationship to keep going, or find someone closer in your area. Lol Good luck!
9c2fd922de5a489187cce0008b9c1a19aa	make them trust you, call them and tell them were you are all the time, constantly tell them what is happening in your life and try telling the truth to them more, sometimes parents don't want you to do something stupid and so they try to protect you, but if you show them you can take care of yourself and that they can trust you and you won't get into trouble or anything they might let you do more things|`|HzUM8hVSaa	try showing them all the things you do to prove that you are responsible, tell them you are almost an adult and can make your own decisions and you need to learn from your own mistakes.
EU7CUy2aaa	you should go for it! obviously you guys get along great since you're best friends, but you'll have to try out a dating situation to find out if you're feeling the magic too. and once you know, just be honest with her so no one gets hurt|`|RVLTubfYaa	Ask yourself: are you better off with-or without her? Are you happier with her-or without her? It'll be good if you make a list-would it be better IF you felt the same, or IF you didn't feel the same? I'd say you don't feel the same, because you obviously wasn't thinking about it when she texted you. If you felt the same-lol I guess you never would've asked this question. I could be wrong, maybe you're discovering your true feelings for her as a result of her text message. Either way, I wish you luck, and I hope I helped.|`|kRN7SPiyaa	Um... well<br>  <br>  I would just tell what you feel.  It might hurt them but it probably won't hurt your relationship.  If you love them go for it but it sounds like you don't.  You weren't stupid in what you said, but if it were me I would just say I like you as a friend but I am not ready to take that step with you.  <br>  <br>  I friend of mine asked our best friend (also my crush) if he would go out with her.  He told her the truth and everything ended up okay.  It was awkward for a day or two but after a weekend, they were friends again.  Good luck! Hope I helped!|`|1jltjtjSaa	ok <br>  #1 thats what i would say under pressure too :P<br>  #2 i dont think you like her, i think you lik that she likes you.|`|sVsDPuhNaa	well it wasn`t dumb but you could of stated it in another way for example you could of said "well to tell you the truth i dont really know".<br>  well you can always give it a try and if you see that you start to like her then its going to work out but if you see that you like her more as a friend because you see her as a sister you can always tell her the trith because every girl wants a guy who is honest to her.<br>  so just tell her that you are not so sure about how you feel and you want to go out with her to see if its going to work out.|`|ryHdojcIaa	Yeah y not you know you are compatable if you are best friends but if you really only just like her as a friend it might make things weird between you.|`|MANvoL8vaa	if you're not sure...then dont do it. if there are doubts then go with your gut. or if you think you may like her then try it out! good luck :D|`|0muvYszmaa	okay it was pretty stupid, how can you not know honestly?

I'm an older woman dating a younger man also. What tends to happen is they want to know if they still have "it". Now he is walking a fine line due to the fact of how you two met. If he is infact still adding friends yes the door of possiblity is still open. Stop looking at his facebook, don't ask any more questions because what is done in the dark will always come to lite. I will caution don't move in just yet. Give it some time. You start to do your thing don't make his life yours "if you know what I mean". Funny this is my friend has done the same thing the difference is that he's on an adult site. Do I care not at all.

Have you been hurt too many times by boyfriends, do you just not feel pretty? At some point, you're going to have to trust and risk getting hurt. If you don't, you'll never find someone that you can stay happy with. How long has this guy been with you? Don't you think that if he were going to leave you for one of those cute, young b*tches, he would have by now? He's with you because there's something deeper than just attraction (although that's important too). <br>  <br>  Based on the information you've given here, I think you have a good guy that's fairly understanding and wants to work this out with you-- there's a lot of men out there that would be extremely hurt if you felt you needed their facebook password to check up on them. They'd probably tell you to get lost.<br>  <br>  You should really think about these feelings you're experiencing and figure out what exactly is to blame. You don't want to make your boyfriend feel like he can't talk to women without getting into trouble. What if he has female coworkers?! And certainly don't move in with him or get engaged until you think you can trust him.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Well, my husband has many female friends and still talks to some of his exes.

I've worked in a catering hall since I was 14, and worked a lot of weddings. She's 100% correct that you will have a lot of people on your guest list who simply will not attend the reception on a Thursday night. They may be able to come to the ceremony, but they won't be hanging out with you. Got kids? Knock them off the list now, because they're not going to stay out late. Even people with jobs won't want to get home from work in the afternoon, go out to a wedding til11PM/midnight, and then get up early the next morning to go to work! Thursdays are bad, bad nights for weddings.<br>  <br>  As to the alcohol - if they want to 'abuse' the open bar, they'd do it if it was Saturday or if it was a Tuesday without a second thought. And remember, 'her people' will be yours soon!<br>  <br>  Friday nights are cheaper then Saturdays too, keep that in mind. It could be a great compromise!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	She's not paying so she doesn't get a say. She already had her wedding, and back in that generation and those before, the mother planned the wedding and the daughter had no say, so she has to live with the choices she made and not live vicariously through you. This is your wedding that you plan with your fiance. No one else gets a final say in any of the decisions.<br>  <br>  Tell her you will take the idea into consideration and then move on to the next thing.|`|8IA3d3NNaa	I agree, you don't have to listen to JACK she says if she doesn't contribute and if she did contribute (IMO) she only gets say in things she did contribute to. I'm not having liquor (or even beer) because of my fiance's family being lushes. DON'T mention her pitching in (that may backfire). Your not overreacting but this is ONE of those times where you may have to be the bigger person. Politely tell her that "this is our (your and your fiance's) wedding and we will do it the way we want to." if she still goes on, tell her that if she has such a big problem with it, she can just not attend. She had her chance to do a wedding the way she wanted to, now it's your turn.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	It's YOUR Wedding. Your Dad's Wallet.  And Your Mother-in-Laws opinion. You're ALL entitled to your "contribution". -You have it your Way. Your Dad foots the Bill (& go "easy" on the Guy- huh?- Weddings are EXPENSIVE- & times are tight... :)  ). And your Mother-in-Law can sit Home & miss one of the most Important Days in her Son's life. 3 People. 3 "Choices". 3 Decisions. -And may You ALL live "Happily Ever After..."   :)|`|Likst1Mxaa	Nah.<br>  <br>  Potential mother-in-laws can be such b!tches.<br>  <br>  Just say that you and your fiancee want to be different and you'll give them more details when they come to hand.<br>  <br>  I've known of a few people who get married weekdays. Nothing wrong with it.|`|200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	I would of commented to that "Well people are coming to my wedding to see us get married, not to have a free range at a bar. I think a Thursday night works best for our schedules and the hardship on my father's wallet". <br>  <br>  If people don't show up because they can't drink, then those are the people you won't want to show up as they wouldn't be there for the wedding in the first place.<br>  <br>  I would understand if people leave the reception early if they have to get the kids to bed or wake up very early (like 4am) to head to work, but an excuse to not get blastered drunk is just very rude.<br>  <br>  I would also reconsider having a open bar. In a lot of states, the hosts of the party can get in legal trouble for allowing members of the party to leave intoxicated, since accidents have occured and people have died in these accidents.<br>  <br>  So I do recommend for people to know responsible non intoxicated drivers are allowed and request of keys will be made at the bar with breath testers before they can gain them back.<br>  <br>  I am 100% big on trying to stop drunk drivers.|`|aipChC3haa	It would be polite to, but if your dad is paying, then don't listen to that b1tch!<br>  And, take a day off from work on Friday! <br>  You don't get married (hopefully) more than once in your life!<br>  <br>  And, it's really considerate of you to move it to a Thursday.|`|ddXDh7rCaa	Go ahead and plan the wedding that you want.  If your in-laws are not contributing to the wedding they don't get a say in the planning.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your wedding|`|YsiJiOqXaa	umm, NO!|`|FzS3aphWaa	There are several points to consider.  <br>  <br>  1 You are being very considerate in thinking about the difference in cost even though it does not affect you personally.  I would commend you for making that decision.<br>  <br>  2  On the other hand, your mother in law will be part of your life for the rest of it.  Your fiancee does not sound like he will stand up for you so it will be just you and her trying to deal with your situation.<br>  <br>  3  I would seriously reconsider having an open bar.  You already know that one side of the family will take advantage and you will have to deal with the effects of too much alcohol.  You can be held responsible for any accidents that occur, either at the celebration or on their way home.   Are you prepared to take keys and send everyone home in a cab? or are you prepared to pick up the hotel bill for everyone that is too drunk to drive home?  Have you designated a couple of people to be at the door to make sure that everyone who has been drinking gets home safely or does not leave the venue until they are sober?  When you pick up the liquor license, make sure that all the servers have passed the "Serving it Right" course and are prepared to follow all the legal guidelines.  Make sure that you have enough insurance to cover any costs related to the unlimited serving of alcohol|`|Hfp80ylEaa	Well lets start off by saying the whole "time off work" excuse has always annoyed me.  It's a convenient excuse that isn't usually grounded in reality.  Unless you really work for a slave driver you get plenty of PTO in a year.  I have been at my current employer less than a year and I get 25 paid days off per year and 3 floating holidays.  From what I hear and from experience working at other places this is actually on the low end of generous.  I can also carry over 10 days to the next year.  This is also just PAID time off.  Certain days off don't count and are still paid like obviously holidays and funeral leave.  If you run out of PTO you can still take unpaid time off.  It does look bad on your personnel file but hey when you're looking back at life would you rather remember going to support a wedding or having a clean personnel file?   Anyway the question wasn't asking "how generous is your employer" so the point of all that was to say you need to either be a walking medical journal of problems to use up your PTO or prone to all kinds of BS excuses like I imagine a family of drunks may be.  <br>  <br>  You may want to consider cutting costs elsewhere if it's that important.  OPEN BAR is definitely a good place to start.  Consider a limited bar like for example serving a few types of beer, a signature drink and wine/champagne for toasts.<br>  <br>  It seems to be your belief that you don't need to have alcohol to have a good time so why not cut that down to size before worrying about the venue.  People with kids may have additional concerns making it on Thursday besides the work BS excuse that I beat with a huge stick earlier.<br>  <br>  I do my share of drinking but at least I know my place.  I wouldn't ever use "but I want to get drunk!" as a reason that someone should or shouldn't make major changes to their plans.  I'm a drunk not a baby.|`|Q3ibC4Rnaa	I agree with your soon-to-be-mother-in-law, but she seems to have gone about it in a rude way. Is there a way you can talk your finance's father instead about what works for that side of the family? Or maybe have him around (only if he helps to calm her down). You should consider a Sunday wedding. While I was looking many places told me if I had it on a Sunday we could get a certain discount. Maybe it wont be as cheap as Thursday, but it's an awkward time. Think about your out of towners and how much they have to invest to come? Taking off many days from work instead of one of two, paying for planes and hotels, while this is YOUR wedding, there are many others you need to consider. <br>  <br>  Another way to keep it cheaper, is to have just a wine bar instead of an open bar. You can get 4 different types of wine (and maybe some beer as well) and plan on having 1 bottle for every 2 guests (you'll know your guests better then anyone, but I've seen that that's a good equation in general). Many places will give you discounts after 10 bottles. This way you'll save lots of money on special drinks, still have something great to offer everyone, and maybe save enough money to have the ceremony and reception on a weekend to make it easier on your guests. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hsZnjZvoaa	You may be overreacting just a hair, but she should not have been blunt.  It's not her choice, it is up to you, your FI, and your parents who are paying for it. <br>  <br>  You should LISTEN to what she has to say.  Thank her.  Think about it and decide what you need to do.  <br>  <br>  She does have a valid point that a weeknight wedding may leave people unable to attend, she maybe didn't handle it the way a parent should.  <br>  <br>  I understand your father is paying- and you're awesome to consider his finances.  Do make sure you and your FI are okay with people not being able to travel.  (I'd imagine your immediate family and closest friends are probably in the area anyway). <br>  <br>  If people will only go to have free booze, I'd seriously consider a no-alcohol or just wine w/dinner and champagne toast ; )|`|tvUAO4ioaa	Well, I can tell you from experience, she is more or less correct. Less people will come on a weekday. The last thing most people want to do after working all day is get all gussied up and go out, especially when they have to work the next day.<br>  <br>  Now, as far as feeling like you FMIL is giving too much input, I find it best to just listen and say, "That is definitely something to consider." It doesn't mean you agree with them, but it allows you to bypass a confrontation.|`|1VDuMZuyaa	Its plain and simple, if you don't put into the wedding financially then you can't put in verbally.|`|6B0CpWWfaa	Its your special day, And since shes not helping financially then don't worry about it.  Just tell her you will take her advice into consideration then do it your way...|`|aIPrL5sFaa	dont listen|`|2LmfQUbKaa	i think you should have your soon to be tell her the truth this is your day not hers and if that sid edont come fine! i know that isnt what you want but you have to do what is best for you! i do know that if you look at some of these halls you can get one for cheap on a weekend you just have to look and if she dont like it tell her to pay for somthing other wise shut up! i know you dont want to b enasty to her! but your man will have to stand up and tell her somthing! you can also make it cheaper for dad by going to the party place and getting the little things for the table and the lace table clothes you can do all that for under a thousand and have money left for the hall on a weekend! good luck to you honey it sounds like you are in for a ride with the new mother n law!|`|AA11139669	If you're worried about costs but still trying to appease her, have you considered a late Sunday morning wedding with an afternoon brunch to follow? The food will be less expensive, but people will still feel free to drink. You could even choose to have passed bloody marys or mimosas if you wanted.<br>  <br>  Thursday night would be hard to get people, just because of work the next day. A lot of people will want to be home early and not want to take a day off...especially in this economy. You could always suggest that she might want to pay the difference in cost between Thursday and Saturday. If not, she'll have to deal.|`|ZZp4AekAaa	Congrats on the Wedding and best wishes for the marriage. Unlucky that you might end up with the mother in law from hell though! How rude to suggest that people wont come.... if they are your friends and family they will go anywhere anytime to watch you get married. The day is about you and your fiance as long as you guys are happy that is all that matters. The best way around her comments is to say something like "Well seem as my Dad is paying for everything then I have to keep costs low. If your family are prepared to pay for their own drinks then we can do Saturday night instead." Believe me free drinks on a Thursday are always better......|`|vyL7yEleaa	Thursday nights you are going to have a lot harder time getting people to come to a wedding as many have to be at work the next day and a lot can not get the middle of the week off.  Saturday's may be more expensive but you are most likely going to yield the most people on your guest list. <br>  <br>  and if you want my humble opinion.. having an open bar is the fastest way to ruin your wedding specially if there are known alcoholics coming. a lot of brides don't do alcohol anymore just for that reason. you can have just as pleasant and fun wedding with out all the drunken idiots running around puking on your dress. <br>  <br>  but you need to do what YOU want.. not her.

7LS5HmFjaa	First, you don't have low self-esteem. If anything, it seems to me you are pretty rich in friends. No matter what their status is they chose to have you as their friend. No need to be jealous...just accept who you are in every way and your friends in every way. Remember that things even good looks don't last forever.....good friends do.|`|0muvYszmaa	well think higher of yourself and if your jealous and they are bragging tell them to stop but if you just have low self esteem you may want to look at therapy.|`|0qspJSt9aa	well you can ask this advice on jamrie.com<br>  its more of a personal advice website.<br>  people over there might be able to help you out.<br>  <br>  i go there all the time!|`|4XVqIalFaa	just focus on your life, and cherish the things that you have. im sure there are plenty of things about you that they envy too.<br>  but stop worrying about them and just focus on you, nobody likes a jealous person..
a88e0ddeeeff55ba5f050b6b1e4f5406aa	Sounds to me as though you may have taken one too many puffs if your heart was beating fast. One or two puffs should be plenty enough to get the relaxed feeling. There are many different kinds of decaffeinated herbal teas on the market now that to a tremendous job of relaxing the nerves and its more affordable then marijuana. I tend to beleive that pot is for us older folks who don't like to drink and want to relax and feel silly once in awhile.|`|D0VfZYyDaa	red eyes come with the territory.don't smoke till you drop.there is no regulations on how it is produced and they treat it with chemicals that make it more potent.you never know what your getting so best choice is not to partake in it.|`|6a9AfhsLaa	Ahhh. The first after-the-buzz bad experience. Yeah. It can do that. You get kind of paranoid. And your eyes will freak out. It just does that to you, and its worse for some people than others. Keep some eye drops around! You shouldn't smoke it at all, you never get those brain cells back. But you don;t know me, so why the hell would you listen to me about stopping? So lets get back to reality. To be as safe as you can, you need to NEVER smoke anything you did not see before it was rolled, or prepared for smoking in any way. You need to make sure it is pure, so that no other drugs get into it. Its really popular to find xanax or even ecstasy crushed and in marijuana, and that is really dangerous and can give you an instant heart attack if not handled properly. And if you are having abnormalities, an add in is likely to be the cause. Or it could just be a bit purer or stronger. But always, always be on the look out for add ins. They can be really dangerous. (Like mixing redbull in with alcohol, its an upper and a downer and can make your heart stop.) Always know what is going into your body. Its a really bad idea to smoke it, because of what it does. Its so much harder on your lungs than tobacco, and like I said, you never get those brain cells back. But I am assuming you know what  you are doing and are making decisions that being handled in the mature way. Please be safe.|`|qsx4IyQsaa	sounds like you need to chill out i been Smokin for years and have never freaked out the red eyes is cool thats normal just drop some eyedrops in and chill i think that the more you smoke the less intense the experiance remember you got to crawl before you can walk with the big dogs|`|yrEQq2vsaa	maby you shouldnt smoke then... thats allways an option just throwing that out there. if your not enjoying it why do it|`|e95c60def7314e19e9021c46eaa5fea1aa	Its normal for them to get extremely red depending on how high you are. if you haven't smoked, or haven't done it in a while then it will be more intense then if you've been doing it for about a couple of weeks assuming you did it sparingly throughout those weeks.<br>  <br>  When your heart pounds its usually just from paranoia, just reassure your self that you are in a safe place and that everything is alright. if this continues and you don't like it, i suggest you lay off the weed for a while, and then slowly build up your self control after that.|`|bcGgcPteaa	it would affect your eyes pretty badly im not sure how to deal with that and i've smoked for about 2 years and up until october and november i would trip out just like you did and i quit since then. and it was stress i needed to go to college, my licence, deep thoughts, and everything that was negative i concentrated and i felt like my mind and heart was going to explode, but it's really you who is in control and i'm not saying i'm a stoner expert but you probably need to deal with whats bothering you. good luck bro!
dGFSQPlUaa	a) i really dont know. you could have done something unintentionally that upset them. you could have thought something you said or did was nothing but it really made them mad? but that's only a guess.<br>  b)i really dont know...<br>  c) if you've tried to fix it twice and they completely blow you off. i wouldn't bother. they have their issues. and though it might hurt, you should waste your time with jerks. <br>  but if you really do want to work it out. just send a another message saying something like "im sorry if i did something to upset you but you have to tell me if i did anything wrong. i have no idea what i did but it wasn't intentional. i would never deliberately hurt you! so please tell me if somethings wrong!" <br>  if he refuses to answer back then try and find out his number.|`|WDk8t80raa	Try to talk to them personally instead of through e-mails.

ejvCttS6aa	Go some place where you two can interact with each other and be yourselves.... a relationship should always have some type of fun friendship to it. Dave and Busters, a skating rink, a laser tag place, go carts, six flags, a carnival, a concert, bowling, bumper cars... some place where you guys can be kids and have pure fun!!!|`|kxMDFPnbaa	swingfest 09..its a convention where couples can go in and have sex...|`|h99Mcg6taa	A fair, 6 flags...cirque du soleil show|`|DWLbXd79aa	i like going to the zoo, then obviously sneeking over the bars as often as u can and feeding the monkeys and stuff, go during a school day, way way cool, and fun|`|ZOXP3HKlaa	Ice skating, bowling, shooting range. just try new things its easy|`|QdcmctmJaa	go on a picnic.<br>  its so sweet.
7LS5HmFjaa	You're a good cousin for wanting to help her. She really does need to make her parents aware as well as her aunt and uncle. Though this may seem harmless it really isn't. It is causing her emotional distress which could affect her schoolwork and other relationships. This is a form of bullying and if it isn't taken care of now this could get worse. This cousin will not stay 'little' forever so I'm concerned what could happen when that time comes. One suggestion, record what's going on as evidence. Perhaps a school social worker or other family member could be of help. Don't give up.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	she should go to her mom and her aunt and tell them how it is making her feel she is young and has the rest of her life to go through these things but if your friend cant get it under control now she will never do it! go to her mom her aunt and dont let them blow it off i dont care how young the girl is she know right from wrong an dif sh edont then your friend should go off on her dont hold back! you let people walk on you now they will never stop!|`|S0zbFmcMaa	i guess this is how i would solved it. to stop somebody bullying u, u just have to kill them in the nonviolence way. Tell your cousins to act like softly i guess so like if her sister say she's fat or something says " oh thank you or jfjdudhfj|`|kRN7SPiyaa	She should talk to her cousin's parents, or maybe her parents.  Tell her to ignore the comments and tell her how beautiful her eyes look or something to burst her self esteem.<br>  <br>  Someone told me this once:<br>  <br>  "Someone who calls someone names like FAT and MEAN really is just jealous.  Kill them with kindness."  <br>  <br>  If her cousin calls her fat, she should comment on how cute they look or how nice they are.  Don't say it angerly, just smile and say something nice back.  They can try to push her down but if your friend says something nice back she will feel too good about herself to let it hurt her.  It actually works!
Njgof6hNaa	There's always hope. I personally haven't had that happen. I think it's all about chemistry. You both have to like one another and maybe it'll develop into something else. Sometimes absence makes the heart fonder. Like not seeing the person for a while and then seeing them again with a new haircut or hairstyle and flirting a little. It makes them see you differently. Maybe that'll work. Hope so.
uRbeSOMwaa	trust is an issue, talk to her about it.<br>  <br>  long distance relationships never really work

1vaqtRI2aa	This is a toughy.<br>  <br>  First, she has every right to be angry. You physically harmed her, and that's painful (emotionally and physically) to know that someone who is supposed to love you and keep you from harm would do that.<br>  Let her know she has every right to be angry, and listen. The only way to really understand is if you listen and get her side.<br>  <br>  Second, you may want to stop drinking, or at least put a limit on it. Even if you have to go to AA, it seems like drinking isn't making you relax or have fun, it's turning you into someone scary and hurting the people around you. If you decide to get help for this, you should let her know.<br>  <br>  Apologize, but be sincere. Have you tried calling her? Explaining what you did wrong? Know what it is you did wrong and then explain it to her so she knows you're honest and truely mean it. She's in a pretty bad situation right now and she must be really hurting. <br>  <br>  Consider going through couples counseling before you tie the knot.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you, I'd love to know what happens.

I don't think she deserved that from you. Apologize to her  and explain to her that it will never happen again. The alcohol made you lose your temper and you would never have hit her if you were sober. It is obvious that your drinking is what is causing a rift in the relationship. If you love her as much as you think you do you will do anything to win her back even if it means giving up your vices.<br>   I know all about this because I used to smoke weed and my boyfriend hated it, and for my love of him I did what he asked.<br>  <br>  Personally If I was her i would not take you back because I believe that once a man puts his hands on you he will do it again. For your relationship's sake I hope you quit drinking because I believe all of  the issues your fiance has with you will be resolved.|`|oylb7RNBaa	It may not be possible. But just don't drink enough to get drunk, because once you're drunk, your judgment slowly diminishes, and enough alcohol can, and apparently has, gotten you that bad that you just have no control whatsoever.<br>  <br>  The thing about these types of scenarios is that they never want to listen. If you ever get a chance to talk to her and she actually pays attention, don't waste time with apologies- she's gonna begin ignoring you any second. Given a "They won't listen" scenario, its nearly impossible to make your point. Move on, and you will no longer need her.

OpwMuboqaa	Can you support yourself?  The law says that a father must support his child.  He might feel jealousy toward the child now because the child is dependent upon you and he sees you giving love to your child.<br>  <br>  If you aren't married, then you aren't obligated to stay with a dud of a guy.  Women now can be very strong and have it all without having to put up with immature men.

HnEcgVGiaa	I'm sorry that this has happened to you. What's worse was that this guy was your best friend, and your friendship has been altered because he has gotten into this relationship. But with a relationship comes a commitment to someone. I'm sure if you get a boyfriend, he will have some concern about you being best friends with a guy.<br>  <br>  And to make things worse, you were in love with him! Of course you're heartbroken! =/<br>  <br>  You must realize that guys will come and go in your life. The present would seem like it's going to last and you know what the future might hold. But in the end, it changes like you've never expected or wanted. Because of this, you have to remain strong and be able to move forward with your life no matter what happens. To relieve your heart, find a shoulder to cry on - perhaps a family member or another close friend. Let it out to them. Then wipe those tears away and move on. It will be a difficult journey, but along the way, you will find someone special who's right for you.<br>  <br>  Don't lose hope or let your heart wither away by such events. Keep it beating and kicking. Your life is constantly changing, so you won't be in this situation forever. You'll look back within a few years and see.<br>  <br>  Kind regards,<br>  <br>  Brian|`|BbT3DCHvaa	Keep yourself busy.

Start up the conversation by asking something simple about school, the class, homework etc. then move on from there like ask how her weekend was and keep the conversation going..after knowing her for a little bit get her number and talk to her and text her. Then you can ask her out by saying you'd like to hangout with her and if hanging out goes well ask her out!<br>  Good luck! :]|`|bd9815b095e3714dc17fddcae12e61d1aa	Unless you guys are close friends, I wouldn't express my feelings just yet. <br>  <br>  It would be weird if you just went up to her and told her you had feelings for her.

Good luck!|`|mD4fD1KBaa	Be honest.

wpi36XBAaa	Legally, if the child is proven to be the husband's the child, as his dependant, would be entitled to a share of his estate along with the widow, just as the child would have been entitled to support from the father should the father have lived. A new court order for a re-distribution of the estate would be required, if probate has already gone through. If probate wasn't finalised, the child's needs would have to be factored in.<br>  She cannot divorce him if her husband has died. She'd already be free, as she's his widow. She may choose to change her name if she want too. <br>  As to what (if any) legal or moral obligation the widow has towards the illegitimate child, that would largely depend on her attitude towards it. She cannot be forced to take on a child who's no blood connection. The girlfriend leaving the child to the woman's husband does not obligate her, as his wife/widow, to take the child, as she was not named as a possible co-parent. <br>  But she may want the child with her for altruistic reasons - to have a living part of her husband in her life. She may want the child for monetary reasons - to not have to divide the estate between them.|`|0bYcYz2jaa	I don't think the widow has a responsibility to her husband's legacy.  She does have a right to the child, if she chooses to exercise it, seeing as the baby is his.  I think it would be most likely that the other woman's family would take responsibility for the child and they would have a right to the child, being family.  So I don't think she would be required to take the baby, but she would likely be given the option.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	The widow has absolutely no responsibility to the child.<br>  <br>  She cannot divorce him - he's dead. She can change her name, for a fee whenever she feels like it.  He didn't have to die for her to do that. No, she does not have to take the baby.  It isn't hers - why would she?<br>  <br>  Children are not like property - you don't "leave them" to someone when you die.  The child becomes a ward of the state until an adoptive family can be found.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	Actually to the baby none.   No she does not have to take the baby.  Any further you will need an attorney in your state to explain..   Don't think divorce is necessary as the man is dead.   Don't know if his estate owes the child though ???   After his death you can go to s.s. and use maiden name.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	She has no legal responsibility to the child. She of course can change her last name at any time (even if hubby was still alive), and no she can not divorce a dead man.|`|5ajPMlrqaa	Makes me wonder if the pregnant woman wasn't dying. Did she even know that the man was married? <br>  <br>  No, she probably knew that he was married but needed someone to leave the child to & didn't think that the man would die, nobody thinks they will die like that, but they make their will just in case.<br>  <br>  I say... the wife owes the man nothing - he cheated on her. The baby is not hers. The baby belongs to the father.<br>  <br>  The father is passed on & technically the wife has probably inherited all of the father's assets, which would include the child.<br>  <br>  It is up to the wife whether or not she wants to keep that "asset" or place it for adoption.<br>  <br>  She might want to keep the child because it reminds her of her husband.<br>  Who could blame her if she wants to place it for adoption, because it looks like the mistress?<br>  <br>  Best bet: if possible, for the sake of the child, the wife finds the mistress' next of kin to place the child with.|`|09k5GLLkaa	Isn't that cheating by asking us to help you out? <br>  By the way, that is a pretty bizarre scenario.|`|m5CqJbYDaa	Of all the answers here I can honestly say there all 100% correct cause theres no right or wrong answer ,its an ethical question of protcol in that situation,what should be done, not what has to! As for the divorce, to try and get out of it, its irrelevant cause he's dead,which is where the ethical part comes into play, was she cheating on him first to create the situation of an affair by him,so whose to blame for the eligitamate child? Many factors need to be explored in this question ,but still theres no right or wrong answer only understanding in the ethical sense,so when you do your report think of it in many different perspectives and im sure your gonna do fine with it!! In fact i would love to read it and hear how you did on it!   ****SWEET MILDRED SENT ME TO HELP YOU***

He gave me the silent treatment for a long time and even rushed off to Mexico without telling me. We both know we are just friends. He did my taxes and I took him to Outback as a thanks. We talk almost every day, but I don't think either one of us want to get back together. But we both need each other for some reason. We rarely see each other. Keep it to the phone.

To the best of my knowledge, they have counselors who are anxious for you to talk about problems and yours are obviously NOT entirely food oriented, so you should campaign heavily for some help with or even FOR your father.  He obviously believes in therapy, but why is he unable to get any for himself?<br>  <br>  If your father agrees that you being with your mother is not an option, he'll be available to you.  And if for some reason he isn't,  you'll be in some kind of a position to try to get help for him, too.<br>  <br>  I feel really bad for you, but I'm glad that you recognize the need to get help.  Stick with it until life levels off for you.  You'll be in my thoughts.|`|DQkDQraOaa	Please try to explain to your dad how you are feeling. Tell him that he is making this decision very hard for you because he is making you feel so insecure. Tell him that you are afraid that you will not recover without treatment, but that you truly need his support. However, whatever your dad says or does, you know that you still need to go to the hospital. You need to get yourself healthy in order to have any kind of life, no matter where it will be. I sure hope that your dad will come around and help you out. Good luck and God bless.|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	Is there any way that you can get counselling for the eating disorder instead?<br>  <br>  I know you don't want to risk going to stay at the hospital in case your dad doesn't let you back - and having no home would make things worse.<br>  <br>  You do need a stable home so I think you could go to an eating disorder counsellor 3 times a week or something and try to battle it while you are living at home. Also have you explained your situation to the hospital? If the hospital is near where you live then they may be able to change the rules slightly and let you come in for counselling daily but let you live at home. I think if you explained it to the staff there they would try to do everything they could to help you given the circumstances.|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	If you can't live with your mom and your dad is too (insert descriptive here) to take care of you, staying out of the hospital is not going to help you.  Let your parents live/destroy their own lives with their own choices.  You have to do what is right for you.  Don't worry about where you will go when you are discharged, only concern yourself with getting better.  Go to the hospital, get better and healthy then deal with your home situation with the help of your counselors at the hospital.|`|jeNxVE3paa	Remember that it's impossible to predict the future.  You can't just think if you go your dad will throw you out.  That's really making a leap.  Go and do your therapy and focus on getting better.  Dad and other stuff will work itself out later.  Get better and don't make this an excuse for not going.  Good luck|`|E5fCbgfVaa	When its a matter of your health you should not feel guilty about doing what's best for you.

And i do realize your emotional health is on the line here, too.<br>  <br>  Now is the time to start taking care of you....i think that your improvement might be of some benefit to your father.  And you deserve help and treatment... please do what you have to do for you first.. and when you are able to make phone calls while in the hospital, call dad to see how he is, and let him know how you're doing too.<br>  sending hugs and all best wishes to you and your family xo|`|dQ0LpBiZaa	I think that health is very important. If you don't go to the hospital and you feel like your eating disorder is serious, you might wind up in trouble(you know, health related troubles...). i agree, I don't get why a parent would hesitate to let a child come home. If he doesn't let you come back,which is odd, you can go to a friend's place maybe. I think you would feel better if you tell someone close about this, they can probably help you.|`|l6EO5pDDaa	go to the hospital. you need to get better for yourself, its the best for your health nd your future. <br>  if you cant go live with your dad, i know there are homes for young girls with eating disorders that is not hospital treatment. <br>  <br>  part of the hospital treatment will be counseling and you need to talk to them about this situation. they will help you with your plans and help you make arrangements for your discharge if you cannot live with your dad. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|mirOK6Bzaa	I think you should go. Talk to a FAMILY therapist about all of this while you're there and also talk to you dad. Maybe even drag Social Services into the matter and they will help you out and the hospital will give you the help you need for being suicidal. I hope everything works out.|`|0pKjDxj4aa	i say you should go to the hospital..it will be best for you..also you should have a talk with your dad..i dont understand why he wouldnt want you back..but take my word and go to the hospital asap..:)|`|2C2WY3H1aa	I read it, and am glad I did.  Go to long term, sweetie!  Eating disorders are never "cured".  They are always there.  I have had an eating disorder all of my life.  You see, it was a way to get me through a dysfunctional childhood.  It's the ONLY thing I had control over.  So what if your dad won't let you come back...sounds like he is unhealthy (mentally).  I think that you should start thinking about yourself and your future.  YOU are the only one that can fix YOU.  YOU are important!  Get the help you DESERVE.  It's the only way for you to fully understand why your mind is doing this.  There are lots of issues...go to aftercare as well.  Do you have any relatives you could live with?  Friends?|`|GSFH3Hvgaa	Well that is a problem hmm. Well i think the best thing you could do do is to try to sneak there. Say your going to a friends or something. Or if you can't do that you could try trusting your dad. And if that doesn't work out and he does kick you out you can always try to spend a little time at a friends house until you get a good enough job to pay for an apartment. Or if you have any cousins or relatives. But getting kicked out would be better then going and killing yourself.|`|Klf3orZlaa	Your life is more important. It sounds like your dad has some issues to deal with himself. But I believe you will be a stronger more confident woman if you get your life back on track. Go get the help you deserve and then deal with your dad when the time comes. If he lets you back then you two can start trying to rebuild your relationship if not then you are just going to have to be strong and find another way to stand on your feet. Taking care of your disorder is the most impotant thing for you right now. Your future will be a whole lot brighter once you help yourself! <br>  All the best. Hope this helps clear your head.|`|z2iz0oNKaa	Aww, I'm so sorry, that sounds terrible!<br>  I think you should go ahead and go, but maybe before you do try and tell your dad how you feel? Make sure he knows how he's making you feel.<br>  You need to go to the hospital though, because it's what's best for your health. <br>  <br>  Again, I'm so sorry, and I hope everything works out for you.

6EWvW3Kiaa	your moms overeacting in my opinon. I play video games almost every day. I would try to tlk to her about it be like lookif ur grades are good then she should lay off but if they start slipping or are  not so great then yeah u might have a problem
RDgyb7W8aa	1st you can't make him love you.  Question # 1 If a lady was 10 years younger than me and  wanted me to go out and become serious, I would be beating down the door.  Question #2.  He might think of you as a trophy wife to show everyone with the difference in age rather than loving you.  Either way nobody can read his mind. Good Luck|`|vHjYw1txaa	1. Yes, I would date someone that much older than me.  I don't think it's wrong.<br>  <br>  2. Did your man tell you he didn't love you?  If so.. why would you agree to marry him?  If you KNOW he is not in love with you then your marriage will end badly, like him cheating or something.  And there are many reasons a man will marry a woman, she got pregnant, he doesn't want to be alone or she has something to offer him like money or security in the material aspect|`|6BjZkRuYaa	Umm, yeah, your 20 and that shows.  Your too young to be engaged, not b/c your 20, but b/c you posted that your engaged and your not sure the guy loves you.  WHAT?  Give the ring back and grow up.|`|RMbZZpiEaa	If you were older id say it is ok. and the reason why he wants you is because if you are as attractive as you think you are then its because he wants a younger hotter piece of @$$ to show off|`|GdSzrtmAaa	HE DOESN"T LOVE YOU ...I think that is a good reason enough. Leave the loser and move on.
TphxwASlaa	you need to grow up and stop writing notes in school... do your work and get good grades
1k7LIZVWaa	No, you are more likely the reason they got married.  They have their issues and now they want to divorce.  It isn't your fault.  It's on them.  They didn't "have" to get married, they chose to given the circumstances.|`|iblT1HJpaa	You don't say how old you are now, but as one that has been in divorce care for a while.......I see it all the time. The child naturally "thinks" that the divorce is their fault. It's a natural choice for YOU are the only common thing between mom and dad. <br>  You will also notice that YOU are the main thing that they fight over. Why is this? Because they each love you so much and they like each other so little that you become the center of attention for their affections. They have switched allegiances from one another to YOU! <br>  Many children feel like pawns in the whole debacle which just proves how immature the parents are anyway. <br>  Want to find real healing for everyone involved? <br>  YOU goggle up divorcecare.com and see where and when it's in your area and get your parents to go. Preferably separately; different times / different churches and you go to it also. (or DivorceCare for Kids....DCFK) You all need an outside intervention of wisdom to come into the game here and this is it. <br>  For you to think this way - you need to come to understand the real truth. You were not the cause. THEY were the cause! 16 and 18? My shoes are 18.|`|AA11292270	Oh no.  I am sure your parents didn't get divorced because of you!  They got divorced because of them.  Possibly because they married too young.  But definitely not because of you!|`|Bt1D1wWuaa	It definitely is not your fault.  They were extremely young when they married and it was probably the best for everyone, including you that they divorced while you were so young.  Hopefully you see both your mom and dad on a regular basis.  That makes it even better cause then you can celebrate 2 Christmas's, 2 Birthday parties, etc.  Plus, there is no fighting that unfortunately goes on in so many households and the children get far more frightened and scared from having to listen to that constantly. I would say they did it because they knew that they just weren't ready for marriage and most likely had completely different ideas for the future so this way you actually got the better deal out of it.  But don't you ever, think for one second that it was because of you, because it wasn't!|`|RDgyb7W8aa	i sure the divorce was nothing do with anything you done.  They still love you. It is true they were young when they got together, but it seems that they tried to work things out over this many years.  People just grow apart.|`|RMbZZpiEaa	I dont think it is your fault. Dont blame yourself. I think they were just too young to have a kid and when they did, they couldnt handle their decision.
09db70825677bbcf722475d2959af94eaa	first of all you need to get help to deal with the suicidal thoughts.  Call Kids Help Phone 1 800 668 6868 or find a counsellor in your area.  Then you need to talk to your lawyer.  That is what they are for.  <br>  Buddy - I wish you the best of luck - keep your story straight, tell the truth and listen to your lawyer.|`|ukBULJtmaa	god works in mysterious ways.|`|h9TQxlVpaa	Im not reading all that.
c2fb4365c45b260693539c9ad4af6fd1aa	I don't think you should go to see him right now. It sounds like his mental illness has him irrationally angry. He doesn't hate you...Well, he might, but believe me when I say it's just for a little while. Part of his mental illness is that he will hate you today, and then think you are the best sister in the world the day after . Try not to take what he says to heart. I mean, if he were mentally retarded and said hurtful things you wouldn't let yourself get too upset because you would know he didn't know any better. Well, mental illness is kinda the same thing. When he's caught in the negative aspects of the illness, he doesn't know any better either. Be patient and know when he says hurtful things, he's speaking from his illness not from his heart.|`|2VtDIQrvaa	i don't think you should go see him or at least not yet. give him some time to cool down. maybe when your parents go visit him they can tell you how he's doing and they can talk to him about you so he can maybe not be so mad at you anymore or something. then when he's doing better you should go see him. btw you are def. not in the wrong.|`|mirOK6Bzaa	I think you should. They do and say things they sometimes don't even mean.
AA11829392	I have had problems with acne for a LOOOONNNGGG time, so I understand how you feel.<br>  <br>  You are young and it sounds like she is pretty superficial.. I would suggest looking for someone who will care for what is inside.<br>  <br>  Remember, one day she will be 50 and sagging all over the place.  She won't have anything because of what she values (appearance.)<br>  <br>  Look for the inner beauty that can shine past physical appearance... you will be more happy than you ever imagined.|`|J5zqZp7Qaa	I'm sorry that happened to you. It sounds cheesy, but honestly-- while physical attraction is important, an intellectual/emotional connection is what counts. Someday your acne will clear up, but she might still be shallow all her life. For that, you should be pitying her rather than feeling bad about yourself. Cheer up!|`|Vv7a31pmaa	You should be judged by what you are inside.<br>  <br>  Get some acne cream and fix that easy problem.<br>  <br>  Then date her best friend.|`|tnQOy5kdaa	Look, if she doesn't like you because of acne, she's probably a b**** and it would have ended anyway so w/e. Also, I'm guessing you're young because of the acne, you'll get a new girlfriend soon. My friend says that when people are young they get new girlfriends and boyfriends like tampons... "ooh, done with this one, ooh! a new one!" I recommend using clean and clear, but not to make others happy, just to make yourself happy because this probably emotionally scarred you and you'll be self-conscious afterwards.|`|2SHBgVEiaa	if your gf broke up with you because of acne, say oh well, her loss... she's more worried about appearances that someone's true self. i had bad acne in high school, and knew other people who had the same problem... we win in the long run. be patient. you'll get your hotties... :D<br>  <br>  and that girl that broke up with you now just may regret it later on...|`|7uIYkvrKaa	That's really low. Your better off without her. It's probably her loss anyways. (:<br>  Sorry.|`|wQtNf5CCaa	You find out what she is most self conscious about and then you exploit that.<br>  It is the most pleasing form of revenge in the world
D3hYbsVJaa	Of course they can. If you think you are or know someone who is, there are plenty of options to help. You can seek counseling, friends family, and I can even suggest many sites online to help.
NDXhxaJ9aa	We're going shopping!|`|3y0w1qIBaa	"I don't want you in my life anymore.  I am sick of you and tired of you and I feel that I am wasting my friendship with you".  That was two years ago and I still regret it.  She stopped talking to me, ignored me and avoided me.|`|7wULI7rvaa	I love you.|`|YTG3bCeDaa	You smell!
rNUB8B6Vaa	if neither parent has custody then prob yes
zzaScg0haa	Never heard of him
8ilHQMq5aa	being disowned isnt a legal matter.<br>  unless its a will. then he could have been written out of the will. and he can be put back in it.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	The only advantage to it would be if he stands to inherit a large sum upon their deaths.  I'm guessing that the disowning wasn't a legal situation, anyway and if they want to forgive each other, then that's just a nice thing.|`|jpimg8doaa	no|`|xZI6noJiaa	He's a legal adult, so this question has no relevance. If both he and his parents decide that they want to have a family relationship again there's nothing to stop it. Unless for some reason there was legal action taken in the first place to keep him away from them.
AA11879371	She could have anger management issues.  These can be reduced and sometimes eliminated with anger management counseling.<br>  <br>  Or she could have some serious  PMS issues, which require medication.<br>  <br>  In either case there are problems.<br>  <br>  I find it interesting that society generally accepts this type of behavior when males do it, but are intolerant when females exhibit these behaviors.   No matter, she needs help.  If you haven't the inclination to help her or stay in the relationship, at least tell her why you are leaving.  That puts the ball in her court to get treatment for herself.|`|htWw0OlCaa	Next time you two argue, make sure you are several hundred feet away from her, and don't get in a car with her again.... If you do, make sure you are driving, not her. And that way when she starts to get pissed at you, pull over and boot her a** out.. Make her walk and cool down. There, that ought to do it....LOL...|`|Vv7a31pmaa	She is crazy.<br>  <br>  She will continue to hurt you until you will not take it anymore.|`|SdlEr5zqaa	I think you have answered this question already. When asking about her twisting your arm, you replied saying "it looked pretty serious to me", and when asking about her fast driving you said "I thought we were going to have an accident and lose our lives". <br>  <br>  Sometimes you have to go with your gut instinct. The girl sounds unstable and maybe needs to mature before she ends up really messing you up either mentally for physically.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	I would be very, very, VERY concerned!!  Do not dismiss this!  That is abusive, controlling behavior, and it doesn't matter that she is a girl, it is still just as out of line as abusive controlling behavior in a guy.  <br>  <br>  It is time to dump her - she is justifying bad behavior by BLAMING IT ON YOU (!!!), so she is not open to change.  It will not get better, it will only get worse - run now, while you still can escape the nightmare.
