Today, after he  left,I was worried about him. So I went into his bathroom, and it looked terrible. There was ashes everywhere, and he is growing something in his bathroom closet. One sink has the plant in it, with a towell over it. When I went back to his bedroom, there was panthose and condoms in it.(my dad never told us about a GF)  I know i sound snoopy, but i was worried about him.

20090307080403AA8oTEt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this relationship possibly going anywhere?	Sorry if its kinda long :S   So theres this girl i talk to on msn, and ive noticed we're becoming kinda 'more than friends', or i at least i think thats whats happening.      So, before u say 'its some1 else pretending', its not cause i got her mobile number and have talked a bit on the phone. She usually flirts and stuff, and i kinda flirt back. the last convo i had with her was from about 10pm to 2am. We seem to be more comfortable to talk to each other bout stuff.      So, i asked her out, and she said 'ye, when im free'. Jus before the convo ended she said:      "bye hun, i g2g now, mwaaa xoxo, love ya"      She lives around 40-60km's from me, but i barely go around her areas.      The thing is, i learnt shes had a few bf's, and i told her ive never had a gf. She took it pretty maturely and didnt think it was weird or anythin. Btw under 18's party is guna be on in bout a month and i asked her to come along. She said 'ye probly il come'.       Were Both 15. Any advice?? thx

I am a 13 year old girl and very strong. Recently my father was trying move a lazyboy from our living room to his home office. He couldn't pick it up by himself and was about to get my brother to help him. I went over and picked up the chair easily and moved it. Then I realized he felt really embarrassed, and now so do I, because we both know that I am stronger than him.      and fyi, i'm also two inches taller and weigh more.  Should I tell him to start working out ?  Or maybe joke with him and ask him to armwrestle and if I win he doubles my allowance  LOL ?

20090307080407AAGCgJF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How does he really feel about me?	I know this question may be a little cliche but I'm so confused if this guy I've been seeing is really interested or if he just wants to get laid.   So we've been seeing each other for about a month but we aren't official, and I know he hasn't been seeing anyone else. Before we actually started seeing each other he told a mutual friend that he doesn't want a relationship, which is fine for now, because I'm not sure if I'm ready for one yet... Although I am really interested in him, and he makes me feel great, when we're driving he holds my hand, and he kisses it. Also, the other day he took me out to go watch the stars, it was really romantic and we made out for probably an hour. he would kiss my neck and kiss my forehead, and He told me I was beautiful. When he put his hand up my shirt he caressed my belly and then went up to my chest. That's what makes me confused. I'm not sure if he's just doing these things in order to have sex with me or if he just wants to take things slow with me.

20090307080732AAUdbXz	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I keep going on when all my husband does is play everquest?	Three years ago, the same week we got married, he started playing this game that he played in his bachelor days.  After about 6 months of this non-stop addiction, we had a huge fight about it and he chose us over this game.  Well, it's now 3 years later and on my birthday he signs up for EverCrack again.  He plays it at least 6-9 a day, after work.  He doesn't spend time with the kids.  When he sees that I've had enough and about to give him hell about it, then he will spend some, not a lot, time with us.  I'm getting used to doing things without him and getting to where I'd rather do things without him.  A lot of people ask me if I'm married, because they never see me with a husband, just with my kids.  My kids are my life, I have a full time job and do everything around the house, and I'm afraid that when my kids grow up and leave home I'm going to be stuck with my video game addicted husband.  I'm going to be alone.  The weekends are all about the game.  I know that I'm not alone on this matter.  I just need some solutions to this problem.  If anyone has anything that has worked, then please let me know?!?  I feel like I'm falling out of love with him..

My mum said she couldn't afford to live there alone because she still has to finish paying the mortgage, and the fact that the house is half my dads aswell. It's like I just can't leave this house, I love it so much. I grew up in it. I know ''it's just a house'' but it's not like that for me.

20090307081529AAHU7sn	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Well after the breakup, has a first love ever admitted to still being in love with you?	I'm facing this problem right now. I'm nearly 19, and my first love is 21. I am dating a new guy, and it was very upsetting for both my current boyfriend and me when Patrick, my first love, admitted to still being in love with me.   Patrick and I broke up about a year ago because of distance, which was about 900 miles. He lives in Phoenix, and I live near Kansas City, Kansas. We knew each other in person; it was no Internet romance.   The thing is, I really don't know how to stop stressing about this situation.   I love Scott to death. He's to die for, and I'm glad I found someone physically close to me to share my life with. We aren't married, but we love each other. We've been dating since November and have already talked about a future together.   However, Patrick has told me that "maybe he and I will find each other again sometime in the future," and I really wouldn't mind that happening.   I just feel like I'm in love with two guys at once. My head tells me to stay with Scott because he's close, but my heart tells me that I love them both.   How do I deal with this?      P.S.: Patrick and I are friends, so I cannot stop talking to him.

20090307080844AAGj8oW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So there is this boy.... help from girls and guys plzz?	So there is this guy at school that I am pretty sure he likes me.  He always says hi when he sees me and we text and sometimes talk at school. And he does flirty things like flipping my hood up and smiling really big.  Im 85% sure that he likes me, but I'm to shy to ask him.  And he is too shy to tell me!  I think that guys should be the ones to ask girls out, too, and that is a problem...      The only place I see him is coming out of first period and in the hallways a lot.  And he also has my lunch.  We are both athletic and we haven't been friends for very long - a few weeks maybe - but I'm pretty sure he is into me.  Some of my friends are friends with his friends, and they see him as often as I do... How do I get him to admit that he likes me (or maybe does not like me) without actually asking him?      I'm also planning on texting him later today so... if that makes a difference.

I need to know the best way to let him know that I don't want to go camping with him right now. He and I have been talking for nearly a month. We haven't been out on an official date yet, I want to get to know him better before going on a camping trip with him. I want to be with him for a while before we have sex. I need to know a good way to tell him to slow down without hurting his feelings. I don't want to make him feel rejected either. I really like this man.

I don't ever expect (or even want) a relationship with this man, it was purely sexual      Obviously, I can't talk about this freely yet, which is why I'm in here talking about it.  What should I expect???  Please comment, I'll have to get used to it soon anyway.
20090307082215AAkng6m	Family & Relationships;Friends	I am so worried and confused! Please help?	This is hard for me to explain. I never used to talk to anyone, I was shy and a loner. BUT that has all changed now, I am a completely different person now and I can talk to anyone. My problem used to be that I didn't fit in in school and weekends, but that is slowly improving as time goes on. (but I still worry about not being like everyone else)Sometimes I don't fit in which causes me to lose all my confidence but at other times things are great and I feel part of the group. What I am getting confused about is WHO to talk to, WHEN to talk to them and WHAT TO SAY. An example of this is in some lessons in school I am not familiar with the people I sit next to so I don't say anything. I look around and see everyone else talking and I worry that I am the odd one out. Another example is at lunch I usually have to go up to someone if I want to talk to them rather than viceversa. I worry about what to say to who and when. I rely on my two best friends too much but I have now realized that they're not very good friends and I want to get away from them as much as possible. One final example, yesterday I went on a school trip by coach (It went ok by the way) I was sat next to my best friend (Nick) infront was the Girl I fancy. At one point in the trip Nick said her name in a really low and peodafilioac vioce to get her attention. I would have done that except for the fact that I would have expected her to think it was really weird and not take it as a joke.       I worry about this everyday. I start collage soon which is a chance to start over because everyone new that I come across will have a completely open mind. A good first inpresstion is vital to be like everyone else. I am afraid that I will c*ck it up. I have changed so much but I am capable of being so much more. Please help.
20090307084049AANYmR8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Playing games or she wants me?	We do get along alot and are have very similar personalities.She often refers us like to old married couples.We do flirt,argue andt hen make up alot when together and email.She always wants to know what his going on in my life and now started telling me whats happening in hers. It seems to me she always wants to be close to me and often comes and stands by me or walk together in the office.We did dance together holding hands at the christmas party but i left early. She also asked me to come to another party two weeks ago but i refused.I told her i would be on my own she said so what.She keeps asking me to buy chocolates for her and tea from the vend machine She finds me really funny and once i sticked a parking ticket on her car with a message which she found really funny. I thought she go mad.She does not act like this with anyone else in the company. Also i once told her that i liked her she replied saying good.Alot of other things had happen but to much to write.This is going on for a while but i have always stopped myself doing anything with her because we are both married. She does flirt with other people in the office which i told her but she replied its alot different with you. Do you thinks she his just playing games and i am jumping to conclusion or there could be more to it

20090307083835AAMbTRr	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend problem...what should I do?	Okay so on Thursday my best friend suddenly stopped talking to me. I confronted her about it and she said it was because she was disappointed in me for helping spell a word during our biology test. I found this as a really stupid reason because she had no right to say that after all the things she's done, which are way worse, and I've never ignored her for it. So I went on to tell her that in a text message but she didn't reply and I expected that because I knew she knew I was right. But then my other friend told me that she told her I was just going to apologize to her by Monday so it didn't matter.       This got me mad because it's like every time something happens she gets so immature about it and instead of saying something she'll go on like nothing happened and I have to be the one to fix things. I'm tired of that and I don't want to have to be the one to do it again but I also don't want to stop talking to her for such a dumb reason. What should I do?

20090306163457AA84GvN	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Rehearsal BBQ without a rehearsal?	Hi!  I was wondering how to handle having a rehearsal dinner, without actually having a rehearsal?  The venue where we are having our wedding does not normally hold rehearsals.  We will be having a meeting with the coordinator there some time during the last couple months, but it's only for my fiancé and I.  She said it would be a good 3 hour meeting where we'll run through everything, but not the kind of thing she wanted us to bring our bridal party to...  Okay, whatever.  Anyways, so we still want to have a dinner, more of a BBQ in our backyard.  What I'm wondering is, during the BBQ, can we use that time to go over the details that normally would have been covered at a rehearsal?  Like, can I pull out my list of things and ask certain people to handle some of the tasks on the wedding day?  As in, assigning each of the bridal party members some tasks, such as setting out the favors, place cards, guest book, someone to bring out the unity sand kit and pick it up later...  I figure since we'll have the bridal party there at the BBQ, we can all talk then?  I guess that sounds like a silly question now that I've typed it, but I figure I'll ask anyway!  Any advice/tips are welcome!  Thanks!

20090505122811AAXXDga	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ok ! Some help here plz ! Confused & don't know what to do ! Thx.?	Hi!      Well I have been married for almost 2 years, I do love my husband deeply = ) He is a really nice person, due to his job he travels a lot = ( so we don't see each other that often.... sometimes he is gone for two weeks at the time, and he travels pretty often so is difficult for me, but I try to take things the best as I can, I know is not his fault at all !    The problem is that when he is back home, he doesn't give me that much attention, I want to mean, sometimes I get pretty sad because I would like to be touch, hugged and kissed, I am the one who always is requesting it, when we are having sex after he is finished right away falls asleep = ( that definitely drive me nuts, sometimes I just start crying and he doesn't care at all just still asleep... We have already talked about this, how I feel and how I need his understanding sometimes ! I though we were over it, but a couple days ago happened something similar, he falls asleep again and doesn't care at all, this time I woke him up and told him, that I didn't want to feel this way again, so he said "I don't know what to do"... so I start crying again ! and he just looked at me and closes his eyes (falls asleep again!) = ( that really hurt me... I know he loves me, because he has showed it to me in others ways, I know he is not having an affair or something like that, I just think he is being selfish.... So now he traveled again the day after we have this issue, he said he felt really bad about what happened that night (so he knows he did wrong and hurt me), and that he was sorry.... we have talked just a couple minutes over the phone = ( (I have been pretty distant because I do not know how to react to this, and I do not want to be a "drama queen"), he said again he was sorry and that he felt pretty bad... Now, I do not need to him to feel bad, I need to him to don't do it again.... = ( ... I do not want him to feel guilty forever about this that is not the idea, I was thinking just to be distant for a while, so maybe he will stop taking me for granted !!! I' m just not sure if this is the best way to fix things...          Sorry about the long story... = )    Sorry about the misspellings ! (learning english)...          Thx.

I know nobody dates in college anymore, but for the people who do:  How long of knowing each other does the girl usually expect the guy to sleep with her?      (I'm not saying this because I want to get in her pants anytime soon.  I just want to know the time-frame of how fast we should go)      We've been hanging out a LOT lately, lots of chemistry.  But we might we going too fast.  School's over in 2 months and we'll be split up for the summer.  We really like each other it's not even funny.  I think we both have a huge crush on each other and haven't admitted it yet and are simply "pretending" to go through with this dating crap haha.
20090307045026AAkuIlW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, what exactly is up with him?	I've always suspected a friend of being interested in me but i dont know. He's generally nice to me, but I've caught him staring in a group or like when we are in class. And sometimes, he just addresses me only although he's speaking to the whole group.      A few days ago, I told him I couldn't finish my group report because I was really stressed and procrastinated alot. He told me repeatedly not to worry and suddenly he mentioned that his new year resolution was not to procrastinate and he had a poem on it which he wanted me to read. so he sent it to me.      i thanked him the next morning via sms saying i liked it. during a break in class, we were standing near each other. he didnt say anything to me for awhile and then walked away slowly. what exactly is going on?!

20090307050610AAIWBsl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are teen girls so stupid?	No offense. But why are they so emotional in the most negative sense? they cry over nothing. I have had two separate girls tell me they felt suicidal cause they had a fight with one of their friends. Then they were fine and friends again like two days later. The some girls cry all the time. I was reading through some chick's myspace bulletins and it appears she has cried 3 or four times in less than a day. What the hell?  Its not just "special time of month" or anything like that its all the time.   is this normal or is it just the people i know?   This is kinda sexist so I'm sorry. And by teen i am referring to the 14 - 16 age group, more than the older ones.

20090307084442AAphCrs	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do you think of the movie "fireproof"?	Several people here on YA recommended it and I watched it today.  I agree it is a great movie.  The amazing thing was how similar it is to my own marriage.  90% of the movie happened to me or is still happening.  Many of the lines were almost identical to things my wife or I have said to each other.      However...      There are two basic conclusions to the movie:   1.  The woman is basically a status climbing, money-grubbing, self-centered b*tch who doesn't appreciate her husband.   2.  The man believes he is deficient and at fault.      This poor man is a good man, trying hard to do well at work and at home.  And he gets nothing in return.  There is no respect from his wife.  The movie shows him looking at porn but we all know he's only doing that because he ain't gettin any from his wife.      Then, she starts to flirt with a doctor.  And finally, she files for divorce.  All the while the poor man is pulling his hair out trying to please the woman.      The movie ends when the woman finds out that her husband, not the doctor, paid for some expensive medical equipment for her parents.  She then finally "realizes" that her husband is decent, and she finally shows him the love he deserves.  Why did it take her so long?  This man had worked hard his whole life, married her, and put in 7 faithful years into his marriage.  Yet, he has to spent $20,000 in order to get her to respect him.  He basically has to buy her love, she is unable or unwilling to give it to him out of respect.      The movie made me feel a whole lot better about my marriage, as obviously I'm not the only one experiencing this.  However, it's sad to think that my wife and any other women would torture their husbands like they do.  It's unnecessary and stupid.

20090307085345AAxqJ0i	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I get over what he has done to me?	My husband cheated on me last year and although it has been a few months since then, I can't stop thinking about it and obsessing about the time he spent with this other woman.  I decided to stay with him (not looking to be judged please) because I believe him when he says it was a huge mistake.  He has demonstrated true remorse and actually our marriage is stronger than ever now.  I still don't trust him 100% but am working on it, as is he in a big way.  He has let his life be an open book for me so there are no more secrets.     The bigger problem I have is the "getting over" what he did to me.  How am I supposed to forget about this woman who is haunting my mind on a daily basis?  I picture them in bed, I think about all the times he lied to me....it is ruining my life.   What can I do to move past it?

20090307052953AAsNk0g	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys & girls.. i need some opinions about my physical relation with my guy.?	well i have been with my guy for quite a long time, a few days time its 4years. we have gotten quite physical already, but no sex at all, no worries. It's just that i feel very insecure about my looks. Every time when we kiss, he tends to touch my breasts and when he is trying to kiss them, he kinda squeezes them together. As though he wished they were closer or something. =( my breasts are not together if i don't where a bra and i feel really ugly about this. And i have seen in movies that women's nipples are pointing straight or up, mine is kinda weird. It only is pointy and abit up when i am high. Also i am not a skinny girl. i have a little tummy.. my bf always asks me to lift up my top n lie down, but i feel very uncomfortable about this. Firstly because my boobs aren't together and i have a little flab on my tummy! I know, go exercise etc etc. I am starting to! I feel insecure when we watch movies and the naked girls have perfect boobs with a flat tummy. Btw my bf has said many times i am beautiful the way i am, but i just CANNOT agree with him. =( i wish i had nicer boobs and tummy.      Sorry for my super long story.    My question is, do guys feel weird when you see your girl bare, if her boobs aren't together or if she had some flesh on her tummy. Is it a turn off? AND my butt is soft.. not hard.. =( is that a turn off too? Its too soft. My mum at times make fun saying i have a jelly for a butt whereas my sister's one is super hard.      And girls, anyone out there in my place before? Any advice? Or exercise to push the boobs together besides surgery and to flatten tummy.      & a qns to both gender. I bleed almost 9/10 times when he fingers me.. i have no idea why. I am too embarrassed to consult a doctor. In my country the doctors will look at you super wierd, especially cause i am below 20. Can it be possible that he scratches me that many times? Do u think my inside part is disfigured or smth which can affect my future pregnancies etc..      Please, rude people take a pass on this one. I seriously have no mood for criticism or anything. If you think my questions are dumb, please dont answer. I just need kind honest opinions okay? and Yes you may say be happy with who i am. I am happy, i just need some opinions or advice.   Thank you to everyone in advance for answering my questions!! (:
20090307043309AAqkVAY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Will I have a fling?!?	When one experiences the real thing, the true love of your life, and it doesnt work out, your later relationships either end up by having flings and short relationships with men you're attracted to, or, you wait till the next special one comes along.       In my case, I am the latter, though i know itl be hard to find another special person soon, its been a year and a half already, i had 3 dates recently with this guy who obviously is just seeking a short term relationship, I wouldnt dream of more than that with him anyways. I am lonely, bored, and confused. I know if i went along with it i will feel aweful afterwards, i dont love my ex anymore, im ok, but i cant imagine being with someone, being kissed and touched by someone just for the hell of it, not after experiencing the real thing! Advise anyone?

20090307021018AAeNIyC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Love and Relationships: What to do about ex boyfriend, now friend?	I hate to sound like some sort of valley girl but "So... there's this guy..." He is in my best friend's band and I see him often. Our birthdays are a day apart and we went clubbing to celebrate with the group. He ended up getting drunk enough to be more comfortable around me and ended up kissing me, a lot. I asked him if that meant that we were dating and without hesitation he replied "Okay!" So we dated for a month and things were good overall and I was happy. The only thing that bothered me was that he did not ever pick up the phone and call me. He would rather text me than actually hear my voice and I usually had to initiate the texting. In front of our group of friends he was very shy about showing me any affection, I think the most he did once was grab my hand and it looked like that took a lot out of him. But whenever we were alone things got pretty hot and heavy and things were amazing if you know what I mean. We never actually slept together but we came close and I had to put the brakes on, because it was a little soon and I had no protection anyways. So I'm dealing with doing things his way, being very subtle in public and palling around like friends, coping with just the texting when away from eachother when Valentines Day rolls around. I hear from my best friend that he did not remember to agreeing to date me at the club, and that basically, he woke up drunk and found out soon after that he had a girlfriend. But he wouldn't say that that's not what he wanted, the only comment he made was that he was "okay with" and "used to" being single. So for Valentines Day I invite him over and he suggests we make italian food. I shop for the food, everything is ready and I'm getting excited. Then the night before Valentines Day he tells me that it's too much pressure for him to come over and wanted to know if we could just hang out with the group instead. I was very upset and I told him to think about if he really wanted to date me or not, and that I wouldn't be mad whatever choice he made. He said he was thinking but never gave me an answer, so finally I told him that we should just be friends and he agreed to it. Now we're friends and I find myself wanting him more and more. It's not an issue of wanting to get laid because I got some just last weekend for the first time in about six months and I'm still pining for him. He has now said to my best friend that he's glad he did not sleep with me because he doesn't want to be that guy that sleeps with the chick and then decides he can't handle a relationship and that if was very hard to restrain himself because he thinks I'm very pretty. He's 24, it's not like he's not capable of being in a long term relationship. I'm trying to understand why he's not interested. I feel like there's something wrong with me... like I'm not *fill in the blank* enough for him or if there's something I did to make him freak out. Anyways, I'm trying to show him that I am open to trying again whenever he is ready but I don't know how. If someone could give me some tips on how to show him in a subtle way while hanging out with others that this if how I feel that would be great. I don't want to freak him out even more by texting his phone exactly how I feel. He's shy obviously. I think he's worth waiting for, we get along very well and I'm very physically attracted to him. Some advice would be much appreciated, sorry for the long post. Please no rude, immature responses... this is sort of embarassing for me to write and not something I'm used to. Thanks!

20090306162504AA6vGjR	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Why is it important to propose to a girl when you both know you're getting married anyway?	Hi... i need a little help here. I'm about to marry my girlfriend of 3 years this June 2009. The last 2 years of our relationship have been long distance...and as I wanted her to be with me as soon as possible, I kinda asked her (over the phone) to get married. Of course she said yes.. and we we're both happy.      Last January I went back home to see her, and to help with the arrangements and details of our wedding. I stayed for 3 weeks.. everything was fine, we we're both happy, I didn't see any problems at all.      Then last week, all of a sudden my fiancee just asked me out of nowhere why I didn't propose, that she expected me to propose and that she was disappointed... Of course I was stumped. What do you say to that? I never planned on proposing when I was there, as I thought the money for the engagement ring might as well go to the marriage, right? But she was sad/mad/a little bit angry about it...and she's saying even though I will pop the question before our marriage, she isn't excited about it anymore.. and that I might as well not do it. I have no idea how to respond.      Sorry for the wall of text. But I'm really stumped... can anyone explain this to me? It just doesn't make sense... anyway, in case you're wondering, I'm still proposing once we see each other. =)

20090307072457AAPUT9n	Family & Relationships;Family	What would you do in this situation?	My sister-in-law (hubby's sis) and I have a really rocky relationship. When my husband and I first started dating (6yrs ago), his sister was a young stay at home mom (16) she didn't have a drivers license (so she was at the house every time we were there) or many friends. She sort of clung to me and we began to develop a friendship. Right from the start I wasn't all that impressed with her but did feel sorry for her, I would invite her out to lunch with me once in a while and such.      Lately, she's been driving me NUTS. I've really tried to distance myself from her but she continues to call and come by. She calls me to rant about her other friends, husband, parents, pretty much anyone she can ***** about. She's been telling me lies, and I HATE liars.       Now, here is my dilemma, if this weren't someone that I had to see in the future I would have told her off a LONG time ago, but since it is my husbands sister I don't want things between us to be awkward. Now, I know many of you will say to have my hubby deal with it, but I don't think that is wise. They already have a troubled relationship and he can be very hurtful with his words, especially to his 5 sisters.       My question is, do you think I should call her on it next time she is pissing me off, or should I just bite my tongue and let it go for the sake of it? My hubby tells me all the time that I should tell her, but she is a grudge holder and a **** talker, I'M POSITIVE that if I say something to her, she will turn around and ***** about me to the rest of the people she knows. Please help.

20090307072141AAT3UFs	Family & Relationships;Family	My mother is in bad shape financially?	My mom owns a house that is paid for but doesn't have any other assets. Without having any assets it is difficult to own a house. I currently live with her do to the economy and I lost my job. She often will mention things like her toilet is bad and needs replaced. I feel she must think I have a lot of money and that I can afford to get her a new one. Meanwhile I have no assets and just owe to credit card companies. I seem to avoid her since she seems to be negative to me about her financial life. What should I do when my mom mentions things that she would like replaced if she had the money? Since I have no money myself I can't afford to help her. Should I try to tell her it is her house and just tune her out when she feels I have money to help her or what?

20090307060211AAC81kC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do people frown on polygamy?	I am 29 years old, I am also married.       I have been with another man for 4 years now (living with us) My husband does not mind and they have actually become friends.    I am deeply in love with both men. I do not have sexual encounters with both of them at the same time..if you were wondering.       I would love to be married to both men, but it is illegal. We are not Mormons.      So many people have hateful comments toward me and my husbands. Why are people so upset by what we do behind closed doors? Why does this scare them? I even had a woman literally shield her husband (whom I just met) from me! I do not sleep around and I certainly do not flirt with other men. I just simply do not understand why this is so threatening to other people. We are three consenting adults, We have three incomes and because of this we have a beautiful home and we travel very often. The men have a wonderful friendship and there is rarely an argument that is left unresolved as we have a third party to call upon.  Please explain your reasoning?

20090307073238AA0jtaW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i keep my boyfriend hooked this time round, and stamp out the rumours?	Right, nicknames are gonna be A, B, C, D & E. A is a girl in a relationship with B, and C is a gril in a relationship with D. E is one of A's friends. I'm trying to keep this simple. A thinks B, is always with C, instead of herself. So A talks to E about it and E says she'll talk to B about it. When B finds out, he tells C, and a load of his mates, all his mates bombard A with questions about it. The story gets completely twisted. BTW A & C ARE FRIENDS. The day gets too much for A, so A, takes the next day off school, her and B have now split up because B said they should go on a break, and also called A a twat and a dick to E, because she said about him being with C all the time. C, starts accusing A, of being all over D, because A knew that D was also going to be off school, cause he was gonna' skive, a massive argument started out with A & C, and C told A to stay away from D. Now A is back with B, how can A keep B, hooked onto her, so she doesnt have to go through all that again, or not be so wary/jealous of B being near C?   SORRY ITS REALLY LONG, YOU DONT HAVE TO ANSWER BUT I FEEL ALOT BETTER NOW I'VE ACTUALLY TYPED IT ALL OUT LOL. xxx

20090307063309AALiTIk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She's rejected me several times, would this time be different?	I am sorry it's an essay, but I think the details are important. I met her about 6 months ago. We got close. She models, traveling 2-3 days a week. But spends a lot of time with me (a lot of dinners) when she's here. Then I told her how I felt. She said there's no future because of our different religions. I told her we should distance ourselves, and although we left the restaurant together, she was crying.      Her friend called me and told me she had been crying for days, so I called and said we could try being friends. Well being friends doesn't work. We've had 3 breaks from being "friends". The last one she wanted a 2 week break. Saying, she's so overwhelmed with our friendship. That she thinks we should only hang out in groups (we have no mutual friends), and not do anything personal for each other anymore.      So our break ends, and we got close again. Now every other night she crawls into bed, and we talk for hours on the phone before she falls asleep. Before she left for NYC this weekend. She asked if I wanted to come with her to a religious event of hers. I told her yes, but I am Christian, and not looking to convert. She said she's not asking me to, she just wants me more involved in her life. She was really happy I said yes. After that, she asked if I wanted to get dinner on Tuesday, and watch a movie on Monday. I said sure, even though the only time I asked her to the movies, she told me "no" because she hated movies and always fell asleep. Yesterday I get the text "Hey my plane just landed. I wanted to tell you that I am excited and looking forward to going to the movies on Monday!"      I really do care a lot about her. I've tried dating other girls. But it always comes back to her. But I don't want to constantly go in the on/off relationship, it's not healthy. She's rejected me so many times...am I crazy to think this time it might be different?
20090307073315AA0EvYF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like a girl. why didn't this work?	i like a girl that is a fully clothed strip club waitress. we have been friends at her job for 2 months. we have hung out twice. anyways i was supposed to hang out with her the other night and when those plans fell through i ended up hooking up with another girl. i went to the club and told the waitress about it. i want out of "friend zone" so another girl told me to talk about sexual things with her. so i told her about the girl i hooked up with. the waitress said "r u cheating on me?". i assumed she was just being flirty. i also got 2 dances from a girl she hates trying to make her jealous. i never get the dances out of respect for the waitress. after this she avoided me for over an hour which is unusual. she wouldnt even look at me. this makes no sense as ive asked this girl out before and she told me she didnt want to get involved with anyone right now. why didnt this work?
20090307070111AAMKGTu	Family & Relationships;Family	What do i do about this annoying problem?	My boyfriends mother lives across the street from us.  Dont get me wrong, I do not hate her, she's great.   But lately (the past month), she's really been getting on my nerves.      She sometimes waits outside her house for me to get home sometimes just so she can complain about something (ex- how she's mad at her boyfriend).  But she'll keep me there listening for like an hour....and when I say "okay mom I gotta go" she changes the subject and pretends she didnt hear me say it.        She complains a lot, she repeats herself A LOT.  For example, I have to hear about 10 times a day how she just lost 10lbs and asks me if I can notice it?  Actually, NO I cannot notice it.  But I tell her that she looks great anyway.        She calls at all weird hours of the night and day to ask if im hungry or if I need anything.... and when I tell her that i'm not hungry she'll still go through a list of everything she has to eat in her entire house... (typical italian mother..lol)      She makes things up in her head.  Ex- She has a boyfriend who she wont marry because she is SCARED that my boyfriend (her son) will be jealous of that, when in fact he just wants her to be happy and he doesnt care what she does.      And lately, when she calls the house, I roll my eyes - and then my boyfriend will ask me "why dont you like my mom anymore?"  and I tell him "its not that I dont like her, but she needs to let us have our own life over here and not bother us every 5 minutes"..      She insists that we eat dinner over there every night, and when we dont, she gets depressed.  If we dont go over there to see her for one day, she'll call and ask if we're mad at her...      Its really getting ridiculous.      She just thinks everything revolves around her and I'm really getting annoyed.         What do you guys think?

20090307073544AAfJjBK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me?!?!?!?	This question is for two people. Me and my friend. My friend will be story a (her and her crush) and mine will be story b.       a. I am 90 percent sure my crush likes me. He tells me his secrets, always stares at me, hes always sitting by me and making me laugh, and he hugs me and always tells me Im pretty and he invites me to his place. We are friends but I am pretty sure he likes me. What do you think?      b. My crush sits by me everyday. He always stares at me, and most of the time he doesnt care if Im looking or not. He is always making me laugh and hes starting to talk to ALL my friends. He will insult me in a joking way and if I look like I'm sad about that, he'll be like "Oh, im so sorry." And if my friend says something mean to me as a joke, he'll always defend me. He also defends me when anyone is insulting me. He lies that he has a girlfriend, and I'll see him talking and all with other girls, but I notice when Im not looking he stops talking to them. He knows I like him but I think he is too shy to admit that he likes me back. What do ya think?      Thanks! :)
20090227133305AAOpHiP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My friends made me boring?	I used to be such a hyper person who loved to have fun and was so outgoing. After I moved, all the new friends I made were boring and lazy! I go over to their house and all they want to do is watch anime for 12 hours and go on myspace :l fun! I dread going over there now, I miss the old me where I would party and just have fun. Now if I try and be my outgoing self around my friends they freak out and judge me! And when I go and hang out with my outgoing friend my boring friends get all jealous! It's soooo annoying. Ive turned into some couch potato when all I want to do is have fun because lifes too short for it to be boring. Idk what to tell my boring friends because they are there for me when I need advice, but I just cant take the boringness anymore! Ahh. I feel like a bad friend but now they are starting to not be there for me and cutting me off when I am talking to them about something important and go on and on about how excited they are about some new anime or video game :l Also, I love shorts and tank tops but I can't wear them around my boring friends because they call me a whore! They always wear soo many clothes that you can't see their skin. I feel like I HAVE to wear more when I go over there, even if I go to the beach with them I HAVE to wear shorts because I feel insecure if I wear just my bikini around them because they will judge me and pick on me :l Idk what to do..

Like a blooming rose      Like a poet's dream.      Like a bright ray of light.      Like a deer in the forest.      Like the moonlit night.      Like the talk of a song.

I was in an abusive relationship for about 2yrs...I was lucky enough to get out of it.  I met this guy about 6 months ago.  We started going to the movies, dinner...he is in the army, not that it matters...but lately we have been getting a bit more serious and now is when my insecurities start to come up again.  He tells me he is busy and that he will try to make time to meet with me during the week.  He does.  the problem is that my mind starts playing tricks on me and i start doubting him.  He is a great guy and he says he really likes me, and i really like him too.  We have a great time when we are together.  I know this might be a stupid question, but, if he is making time for me, does that mean he likes me??... He is an arms specialist, he teaches soldiers about all the equipment and arms before they are deployed.  That kind of job would take a lot of time from him,  right?  I feel like he is really honest, and he lets me know when hes going to be busy. But I dont know what to do about the way that I feel.  Any advise will be greatly appreciated.  thanks.

Thursday night, we got 2 slices of pie to take home from a restaurant, one for me and the other one for her. I eat a few bites of the first one, and come home the next day to find it is gone. Okay, that's not so bad, so I eat about half of the next one and when we come home from dinner IT'S GONE. Also whenever we get a huge hershey bar, she eats like the whole thing in 2 days and I get like, 2 pieces, and her and her friend are eating all of our chips! This is becoming extremely annoying, especially when I crave a food at school and come home starving only to find that she has eaten it! My parents also know about it, but haven't really done anything yet except hide the chocolate.

So i have been hanging out with this guy i like for almost idk like a month now and he that he didn't want a relationship  right now bc he just broke up with someone recently, which i said was fine and i understood. we would do little things like kiss and hold hands but it never got serious or sexual. he is normally a very outgoing and very very nice guy, but over the past 2 days he has been replying to my texts with very vague answers, not mean just vague. its weird because hes not a vague person, he usually talks the hell out of me every time we talk lol. I dont understand this bc we have a lot in common and we always have such a good time when we hangout. however 2 things might be playing into this, 1 he just got a job that is making him cut all his hair off and 2 he is going away to a college he doesnt want 2 go 2. so he might just be depressed or having a hard time? plz respond.........im actually really upset about this...

He has someone, but I don't know if she's his wife or girlfriend. I am confused - if she's his wife, then why we chat often via skype till late (in this case - she should be there in this time) and even one time we chatted in 5.30 AM (he woke up after he'd been fallen asleep in front of TV)? If she's not his wife, then why she often calls him to cook dinner? Last time, after we finished work, I said that I will take a taxi to go home, because I don't feel well. He suggested to drive me home with his car. His woman called and he told her that he's going to the shop to buy something and he winked at me.     I know he has a kid.   He'd been taken me to cafes a couple of times but just as friends, I guess (one time we met in the evening and we were in a cafe and drunk alcohol (a little).   So,this is the situation. Any opinion?

This morning my daughter went to take a shower she went into the shower and my mother starts banging on the door telling her to hurry up and that she needs a shower.      I told my mother there was another bathroom in our room and she was welcome to use it. She said she wanted to use THIS shower and refused to take a shower in our bedroom. Forcing my daughter to walk out of the shower soaking wet and move to our bathroom to take a shower.      She even threatened to urinate on our floor if my daughter did not get out of the bathroom. She refused to use our toilet even.      What can we do?
20090307054558AAjKJRd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need advice please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.........…	Ok, there is this guy I have known since kindergarten, a classmate. All through elementary school, he used to pick on me, and make me really sad/mad. But now he doesn't, he just sits behind me on the bus and pokes me and bugs me a little, but not hurtful whatsoever.       He lives a couple houses down from me, on the same road, and once one of his friends came up to me nad said "I know where you live. He showed me when we were walking down your road." and it's true, he does walk down the road because his other friend lives a ways down on the other side of my house.       Well, it's just now he pokes me, and does little things that are annoying, but I don't usually give it a second thought, and neither would anyone else if they were me.       So does he like me or is he just being the typical teenage boy? If it helps, we are both 14 turning 15 this year.         Thanks to anyone that leaves a response that isn't sarcastic!!!!!!! :-)

20090307071410AAtFCpJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are these signs of a shy guy?	My friend and I work on a project together. Since the beginning of the term, I've always caught him looking/gazing at me in the group and sometimes he says things which shows he observes me in class. He's pretty nice and is always able to hold long periods of eye contact and smiles alot when at it.      He's alright in a group but can become very quiet when alone with me. Once I saw him in a corridor and he waved without speaking. Recently, he sent me a poem saying it was part of his resolution and wanted me to read it.       The next day, he stood beside me for awhile before slowly walking away without speaking. However, hes quite vocal in class and talkative.. Is he.. interested?

Well basically i just recently gotten a girlfriend and she's nice and everything, and i really like her and she is doing the same course that i am doing at college so she's in all my classes. But the thing is that before we were a couple she always sat with her friends and talked with them and also she hangs out with them after classes and well basically i did the same things with my friends too. What i'm wondering is now since were a couple do you think i need be with her more often at school like instead of hanging out with my friends after classes (break and lunch) and in class do i need to like eat lunch with her and be with her all the time? Yes i know that i do have to spend more time with her because we are together now but do you think i should change her lifestyle in school or should we just keep it as it is? And basically be there for her when she needs me. Because i don't want her to think i'm too clingy. So what do you think? And also what other advice can you all give me about going along with my first relationship? Because i'm new at it and a bit nervous.

20090307065141AAAaSBe	Family & Relationships;Friends	Advice needed: My neighbour's sewing circle is getting out of hand...?	My neighbour is a vivacious 70-something lady, and keeps an impressive garden and home, and every Thursday afternoon she hosts a sewing circle of her friends.  These little old ladies are usually very pleasant, but lately things have gotten out of hand.      It all began with this last growing season; one of the ladies, Gladys, had brought over some fresh cuttings, and the ladies went inside the house for the usual sewing, but something strange happened.  Before an hour was over, there was loud Big Band music playing, wild shrieks of laughter, and what sounded like heavy furniture being thrown around next door!  This has always been a very quiet neighbourhood, so I was quite distressed, and wondered if everything was okay.      I went over to check and make sure everything was okay; when I knocked on the door, everything suddenly got real quiet inside, and I heard a voice inside say low, "Everybody, cool it!  Just let me check if it's the fuzz!"  Well, my neighbour, Mabel, opens the door and says, "Oh, it's just you, Jack.  Listen, can you do me a favour?  Can we borrow some of those rolling papers you have to make your cigarettes?  We need them for, uh, some sewing patterns....I would really appreciate it! "  I was a bit startled, as much by Mabel's appearance as anything else: her eyes were as red as hamburger!  I asked her if she thought her blood pressure was acting up, but she said, "Nooooooo!  I'm as mellow as a daisy, jus' a-wavin' in the sun."  She seemed a little unsteady on her feet, and I asked if she needed any help, but she assured me she was okay, just really wanted those papers.  As I was leaving to go get them, she called to me, "Hey!  Can you bring some snacks over?  These ladies are hungry and we need something to eat!"  A chorus of giggles wafted out from the door.      Ever since then, Mabel and her cohorts have had riotous Thursday sewing circles, and I just don't know what to do.  Her garden has gotten weird, too; half of it she keeps covered with netting, and one day I asked what was under the netting, and she turned on me quick and snarled, "Stay out of my garden, if you know what's good for you!  You ever wonder how a knitting needle would feel in your balls?!  Don't make me help you find out!"      The few times I have been allowed into her home during one of the sewing circles, the place is just overpowered with patchouli incense, and the smell of something else I can't quite place.  The ladies' sewing projects look bizarre, too; the last time I was in, they were making cozies for these strange bottle things with something like stems on them.  Some of the ladies tried to hide them when I came in, but Mabel said, "Don't worry about him, he knows I'll make a castrato out of him if he squeals to the pigs!"  I don't understand her barnyard reference, but I chalk it up to just more of the bizarre goings-on that have been taking place.      So, as you can see, things are really out of control, and I don't know what to do.  I am worried about my neighbour, but I want our quiet and peaceful neighbourhood back.  What can I do?
20090307072155AA3vaJj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help! I don't know what to do, i just can't get over it...any help?	I was best friends with this guy from america,and i think i fell for him pretty bad, i used to run home from school just to get to talk with him.   and he used to go on microphone with me and we'd compare our accents.   and i loved talking to him more than my boyfriend at somepoints.   and id even stay online til 5am cause i knew we could talk cause of time differance ( he pretended he liked me to me and my cousin ) But i was well aware of him not cause.he has no reason to like me. but one day  he introduced me to his crazy friend *ellie* and she had a massive crush on him,we both used to swooom over him. and he said he hated her, but then my cousin found out that they were both lying. cause he thought if he pretended to love me. then i wouldn't get upset. but he lied! so i flipped out and insulted him loads and loads. and *ellie* forgave me for what i said to her, but he didn't and he told me how much he hated me down the microphone while crying, it was horrible. this happened in 28 in june. and i still cry whenever i think about it..   what can i do?

If so, how long did it take you to get over that person and what was the reason?      I seriously fell for a guy that I was with technically for a year. Our relationship was awesome but whenever his ex was involved somehow, we didn't do so well. He had serious ex gf baggage and he had to leave me because he couldn't get rid of her. He loved her but loved me too.  He said only as a friend but who knows besides him, really.       It's been over a month without seeing him and I'm still not feeling well. More than ever these last few days for some reason.      I don't know what to do, just need some words from other people.
20090307071553AAvc1yv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I wrote this for my ex gf, should i show her it?	well my gf broke up with me a month ago. we dated for 3.5 months and we fell inlove with eachother and then she told me she lost feelings for me and was confused on wat she wanted.  we still talk everyday and are bestfriends.  we do hangout like once a week but with other ppl too.  i still hve feelings for her but they arent as strong but i still love her and care about her alot.  so i wrote her this so she could put this in her profile, should I show her?   Taylor-    She's one of the most amazing girls I know   She's always there for me when i need her   and always has my back.  I dont think there    was one moment where she hasnt put a smile    a on my face just by cheering me up or simply    just being there for me.  You are prob one   the prettiest girl I've ever seen and I'm so lucky   to have you as a friend.  I dont know where I'd be withought you.   We've had so many good times together.  We have    some good and bad times but we always pull through   and stay strong.  I'm gonna make    sure nothing bad ever happens to her and Im going to always    be there to keep her safe and i dont know what I'd do if something    happened to her    so if there any assholes or douchebags that   hurt her, you'll be hearing from me.  I always be there for you no   matter what.  Love you Tay<3 haha little miss sunshine =)

Don't get me wrong, my homies are the best, and I love going out and drinking and having fun, but I'm starting to ask myself, whats the point? I always end up being the wing man and it seems like girls are never genuinely interested in me. I still enjoy being able to have fun night out with the guys, its just that I feel like I never get closer with any girl.

So, she was basically talking with them about how AWESOME her party was going to be....but I wasn't invited, so she was basically saying how there was going to be a DJ and awesome and delicious snacks and everything like that.

I've been told that a husband can never be your best friend....this I've been puzzled with, but I am just wondering from anybody that is married if this is true? And why?      I know there are cases of people who are completely best friends with their husbands....but I'm not quite sure if they are just stories I've heard or there really are marriages out there like that. If so, please tell :)      I'm asking this stuff mainly because I have always approached my relationships in an honest way, always being logical with the guy and being down to earth. But then, one day I got frustrated about how my guy wasn't *listening* to me, and I took the advice of a friend on how I should deal with it and it totally and utterly worked. I was floored. Do you have to do some bit of manipulation to live in sanity with your spouse or is there a guy out there who can be logical about things?       Is it manipulation or "guy speak"?

When my bf fingers me, its absolutely fantastic, you couldn't ask for better pleasure coming from somebody's fingers.   However, just as I'm about to orgasm I feel like if I let myself get there i may slightly er, pee. (DISGUSTING I KNOW!)

I orgasm with ease (with out the pee!)      I am very open and comfortable with my bf so I don't think its that it's the issue of not being comfortable around him.   I never used to get this, it is something that has come over time.

And there's a boy I really like in the upper grade. I made the mistake of telling my best friend from my previous school, who he was and that I liked him. I normally wouldn't have told her because I'm not like that but I figured he doesn't go to her school it wouldn't matter. So she's seen him at a basketball game against my school and hers. She got his number from a friend and started texting him. Then, the other night she called him because her parents were "fighting." It was completely ridiculous. She always tells me how much she talks to him. So is it ok if I'm mad? I mean she knows that I like him and she's known from the start.

We met last saturday (we connected) haha, and yeah. So he asked me to hang out today and possibly do something with him, sort of a date? Well I broke out really really bad this morning and it's horrible! and I don't feel that well. He told me to call him if we are still hanging out (he didnt make any plans because he thinks we're hanging out) I dont want to sound like an idiot and say I can't hang out today ..because we have been planning this all week long. I was thinking of sending him an offline message over messenger because I'd feel pretty nervous if I called him to tell him I can't hang out. What should I say? I don't want him to get the impression I don't like him.. because I really really do :( ughh.

20090307062822AAL81Wx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this over for good?	my ex girlfriend is 18 and I am 23   I met her in work in october and started dating in november, things were fine with us and she seemed really into me, vice verser!   We became an official in december and I was the first person she had slept with   but in february she broke up with me because she said her mum wasnt happy with seeing anyone. It wasnt untill a week ago I got the truth and she told me she wasnt ready for relationship. I told her I respected that but when she said can we be friends I said I dont want to be because its weird as I still have feelings for her.      She really seemed like she wanted to be my friend and yesterday I told her I was silly and id like her to be my friend because she is one of the nicest girls ive met. Deep down I dont want to be just friends and am wondering if anyone knows if there could be a chance of us getting back together as I really like this girl?      will she have feelings for me as I was her first?   Or am I getting myself into the friends zone and gunna cause myself more pain in the long run?
20090307053559AAwO4VC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A ladies opinion please.....?	First off dont tell me what i do is bad because i do what i gotta do to survive you dont know how i was brought up and my circumstances some advice though would be nice.  Im 20 and ive always been a bit of a problem child i dont go out looking for trouble but it seems that trouble follows me.  I seem to always get into fights because dudes always want to disrespect me and my clique.  i also deal.... on the other hand 2 months ago a wonder full girl heather came into my life and when im with her my bad boy mentality seems to diminish i treat her with respect and i really care about her , she knows what i do and wants me to get out of the game and change the people i hang out with because they are bad influences.... ive been hangin with these dudes all my life and there not bad dudes its just were doin what we gotta do to get buy and yes we all hold down jobs 2 but minimum wage - 8 dollar an hour jobs jus dont cut it so we do what we gotta do.   I told her that i do what i do not by choice but to keep a roof over my head and survive.... but id really like to make her happy and try to get out of the constant trouble the fights related with dealin , and the cops.  She started crying the other day saying that if i was to get killed or arrested she wouldnt no what to do.  So ive been really stressed out latley realistically what should i do in order to keep us going shes a rich girl and has offered to help me out but i can not take her money im jus not like that.  I guess what im sayin is should i get out of the game, and if i do realistically what can i do to get the money i need to keep going...i cant loose this girl i have never found a girl ive cared for so much shes always there for me she holds me down...thanks for your time.

20090307072633AAYHDwI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Reunited with ex. Dont know what to do?	Hi everyone,      ok so at the end of January my boyfriend and I broke up. We had a pretty intense fight and it ended badly. Some nasty things were said and I left his house sure that I didnt want to go back. After I had some time to cool down, I called him and wanted to talk things out. I wanted us to both accept responsibility for how we acted and try to move on and work on resolving our problems in a more calm manner in the future. He didnt want to hear anything I said. He refused to meet up with me and stopped talking to me all together. I text and called a few times but each time I did he just kept making it more clear that he didnt want to be together anymore so I stopped cold turkey. I was hurting but I figured the worst thing to do was keep it up because it was just going to be pathetic and thus make him more annoyed and ruin any chance of him ever talking to me again cause I'd be pissing him off more. So I gave him space (totally convinced that he wouldnt ever call me again)       Well, some time passed (a full month) and he called me just a little under two weeks ago. At first when he called the conversation started off as if nothing happened. He said he was calling to say hi and catch up. Eventually we talked about what had happened and the fight that we had. He said that he didnt stop talking to me because he was playing games or anything like that but because we had been arguing a lot during that time and he thought that if we kept talking we would argue more and he would end up hating me and that he didnt want to hate me and that is why he had to cut me off for awhile. I guess this makes some sense?       Anyway, we've hung out a few times since that phone convo, although we didnt pick up where we left off, we are not back in a relationship. He said that he misses me and that he wants me in his life. We go on dates and hang out and watch movies and there is some physical intimacy.       I really love him and I miss what we had. I dont want to sound like im wanting to much too soon but I'm just afraid we will never get back what we had. He said that we have never known each other as friends and that we should try to take the time to get to know each other that way. He said he does not want to put me in the past and doesnt look at me as 'just a friend' but at the same time is not ready to throw it all out there and pick up where we left off. I can kind of understand that, but its very hard to not get attached and not say 'I love you' because even though the month that we didnt talk felt like an eternity, in reality a month really isnt that long of a time and my feelings didnt just go away. He was so so in love with me and it hurts to think that in the month that we were apart he just fell out of love. He said this time right now isnt about falling in love it's about getting to know each other in a way that we didnt before and see where it goes. I just dont know how to handle it. I make sure that I'm not the one putting it all out there and let him call and text first a lot because I dont want to seem desperate I just dont know how to approach it. As much as us talking again is progress, I still feel the space between us and know that he isnt over what happened. It hurts. GUYS I would love to know what you think from the male perspective. But all comments are much appreciated!!! thanks guys

20090307055129AAonY3k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Any one sided love stories similar to mine?	Im in a one sided love for about 5 years now. My story is rare because in my case, i barely knew this guy. i have hard time relating my sad love story to any of my friends, so i was wondering if you can read my story and if you can relate to it in anyway, pls tell me ur story!    5 years ago when i was 13, one of my friends told me that this guy in another class had a crush on me. i never found out if that was true, but that doesnt matter anymore. anyway, i started noticing him often and started wondering if he still likes me. before i knew it, i was always thinking about him and started to kinda like him. Because we were in a different class, we never got the chance to talk to each other, but we knew each other through msn(somehow). we talked on msn occasionally, so he said hi to me sometimes in real life, but never had a real conversation face to face cos i was so shy in which i hated myself for, and everytime he said hi to me, my heart will pound so fast, i would blush hardcore, and cant even think straight. i had ALOT of feelings for him, but refuse to get to know him because i was moving to another country the next school year..for that reason i thought it would be pointless. so the school year ended, i did nothing therefore nothing happened. 5 years later, im still in love with him. and i know you think how could i be in love with him when i dont even really know him..well dat ill never know, but im so sure his my only love. i had couple of boifriends after that, but i was never able to fall in love with any of them, even if they loved me. evertime i was with another guy, i would imagine being with my only love. every single day i regret not tryin harder when i had the chance. so wat if i was gonna leave? that shouldnt have been the obstacle of me getting to know him. i wouldve done longdistance relationship if it was for him..or i wouldve found someway to stay if it was for him. because i know at thisn point i would do anything for him. anyway..after 5 years, i still think about him almost everyday and i cant stop my tears everytime i think about him. i cant move on and i just know that it HAS to be him. but im thinkin its to late now. were miles and miles away, and his in a serisous relationship of 4 years now.   anyways if anybody has a story of themselves related to this in ANY way. pls lemme hear it! i feel like im alone in this=( i guess not everybody ends up with their one and only love.

She was gone for 3 days and when she came back I asked her if she needed help and she said yeah. I guess I overdid it but my friend points it out and me and her were like "Uhhhh this guy is weird".

Then there was this guy on my mind [yea i'm a girl]   and he's new to my school. Only 2days old at the time.   And i tried getting him out of my mind. For like 2-3hours and he wouldn't get out...   so the picture had me up till 2 tryin to get it out...   and then i fell asleep..   the next day i went to school friday 03/06   and he followed my crew to lunch,and during lunch some how   we sat across eachother again.   Well noticing that he looked at me every 5-30secs.   i kinda felt wierd being around him,   and i wasn't nervous.so i switch seats with my friend,lets call her mandy.   And she liked him,he looked a little confused but, it seemed like a whatever.   After i switch seats he didn't keep direction in one place and i stopped looking at him and talked with a group next to us.   Well,then walking to class out in the portables,   i walked with my friend sha-sha and he walked with my friend mandy.   We were talking and she said 'i think he likes you'   i'm like 'who?'   sha- 'matt,'   me -'how?,how you know this?'   sha-'he kept starin at you until we got to this portable'   me-'and? anyone could have looked at you and not like you..'   she-'no,i can tell,okay.I look at his eyes and they don't look normal'   so i turn around and he's not looking...so i was like whatever.   Teacher came I walked into class, seconds later i got up to the door and he was right there near the ramp.And started walking in.   HE sits right in front of me in this class we were in. I switched seats like 2-3 times and finally just sat in my regular seat.   it was awkward kinda...   really all i wanna know is what is it suppose to mean,   when i couldn't get him out of my mind?   the story was just in case you  needed more info.   [idk if this whole story made sense-i didn't proofread]

20090307062935AARLI3A	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm dating my best friend. Is this okay?	I'm dating my best friend. We have been friends for 4 years, but for the last year, we started feeling, more feelings for eachother. We acted on these feelings privately when it was just us, and always acted as though we were dating when we were alone. We finally took it public, and it just seems as though people are really concerned it will ruin our friendship. Should we have stayed less happy, and kept our feelings secret to protect our friendship, or should we have taken the risk, and been with eachother?      -thanks. :D

20090307071412AAJSOq2	Family & Relationships;Family	Sister disrespecting parents?	What do you do about a sister who ALWAYS disrespects her parents? She curses at her mom, yells at her dad. She talks back to her mom, she calls her stupid, she calls her a *****. The thing is, my mom doesn't understand english so the sister would curse to her in english.    Recently, my mom thought my sister did something wrong, but she really didn't. I understand if you're wrongfully accused of something, but that's no reason to go "**** you" and call her a *****, right?       WHAT TO DO? I don't want to watch my parents being put down like that.   My parents can't do anything because she doesn't listen to them. Everytime my parents try to talk some sense into that thing, she just goes SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP.
20090307073504AArdRxO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am looking for a suitable guy for marriage! But why do I give importance to physique?	Well I want to get married to a nice guy who would be genuine in his love towards me never cheat me, is a teetotaler and never does any thing bad in the society,Gives me respect, treats with responsibility and is good to my family too. I wish he has good respect in society. But whenever I look for a profile for marriage or if I see someone around I have the attitude to first confirm who good looking he is. What is his personality how well built he is. How good is he in personal hygiene. These are the qualities I care first even before I look into his character.      The problem is I don't get interest in knowing about a person's character before I am convinced I should think of a relationship with this guy for the wealth, personality and grace he has. To be precise I give much importance to physique age, charm etc in the first screening.      Am I misguided? Or is it natural to expect such things for my age.   I am 22 a virgin with a good profession and salary. I am ready to wait for even 3 years before I decide on my man. Advice me to get the best man for me. Guys will you feel me unreasonable? Girls is it the same you felt when you chose your partner or do you agree with my views is it normal for me?
20090307073134AAXWS7a	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I approach to this girl?	the girl next door, sexy, tall, pretty, ... she told me that she have broken up with his boyfriend and haven't been with anybody for four month, I like to ask her on a date, and I told her casually couple of times, it doesn't seem to be like she doesn't like me, but she said no, " I'm not feeling good ... I'm tired ..." she said. we have been out once to a coffee shop and I spoke about the school, I'm trying to get permission for my masters, she talked about her last boyfriends. I mean everything look like it is a perfect time for starting a new relationship for both of us, I haven't been in a relationship for almost a year.    I assume she is an INDOOR kind of person and she rarely goes out for dinner or something.   should I speak about my intention to start a new relationship with her in her place or like casually wherever I saw her if she doesn't like to go out for a dinner or something.   other thing is I think maybe she is not over her ex-boyfriend yet cuz she told me several times that she loved him, but he left the country and he is with another girl right now and is not responding to her calls and mails!   I think I can be a good friend to her!   thanks for the comment!

20090307054126AADLXDE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think this all means?	've been going out with this girl for around 2 months now but we have been friends for a long time. She says shes madly in love with me. We usually get in these little fights but its nothing big. But yesterday she said we should take a break from hanging out as much because we literally see each other all day whether its at school or home, some how we find a way to be with each other. What do you guys think this means for our relationship? She still says shes in love with me she just needs some alone time with her friends and family for a little bit      This past week has been different too, usually we have atleast 1 or 2 days to hangout with our friends but this week we were with one another all week so maybe that has something to do with it. Do you think this is leading to a break up though?      Do you think its because we see eachother too much? she just wants to spend time with her family and friends for a little bit?

20090307053638AA1OmTC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my girlfriend being shady?	Is my girlfriend being shady?      5 months ago, we would hang out and go on each others phone (I had internet) (she had games). Even if she wanted to sleep I could use her phone, sometimes I go through text but like playfully like, "ohhhh who's this from..." and read it out loud.      A month pass it was dec and she got the iphone, and through the month of dec I'd go on it a lot cause I wanted the phone, she still didn't care.       in early feb I found out she was talking to this new guy, and at first I didn't care, cause they were talking about chipotle and tattoo's, then 2 days after that I'd use her phone as usual and she snatch it from me.      I ask "what's wrong?", and she said "I don't like you going through my stuff" and I told her she didn't have a problem with it before, and you let everyone (guys and girls) go on it, and she said "so? I don't like people going through mystuff".      So now we're on vacation and I was playing a game while she was watching the phone, and that guy sends her "good morning sunshine :-*", and she starts flipping out saying stuff like "its not like that, why don't you believe me?" and all I did was hand her the phone, I didn't even asking a question.      So what I'm wondering is if this is really shady, and if so what to do?
20090307053657AAQA7Zu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend doesn't want/not ready to have sex?	My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. So about 1 1/2 into the relationship we had sex..followed by few more times. At that point..he started to freak out...and he's claiming he's not ready for it or worried about the risk of pregnancy and what not. It's about 1 1/2 later...and he's still not ready. Sometimes he even eludes to wanting to wait to marriage (would make sense if we were virgins, but we're not?) I'm not really sure how to approach this situation. He's a good guy...and he does care for me a lot...so should I just wait it out? Kind of confused...so suggestions would help.

20090307065459AA8oYDs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think that me and my boyfriend need a break...what should I do?	My boyfriend and I have been together for 15 months now, almost 16.  Lately, all we've done is fight about things and feel bad for ourselves.  We're both getting very sick of it, but he says that a break isn't going to help us.     We both have some big problems that I think we should work out separately.  And, sometimes I feel like we both just need to be apart from each other to take some time and work on ourselves.   Sometimes I question if I'm even still in love with him, and sometimes I wonder if he's still in love with me.   I'm afraid if I tell him I think I just want a break, he'll just break up with me right then, or feel like that's what I'm doing to him.   If I decide to tell him that I really do need a break, no and ifs or buts about it, do you think I'll regret it?  Do you think that this would even help us?      Any help is appreciate.   Thanks in advance.

20090307071417AAcYGwP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I ask this girl to prom?	I know that I would be able to deliver (i.e. not chicken out), but the question is... when would be the right time? I've only been talking to her consistently for two days, and if we go out together today then that would be a third, but only our first date. Think it would be a good idea to ask her to prom at the end of the first date, if everything goes okay? Prom tickets don't go on sale until early April, but I want to ask her sort of early, I think that'll increase my chances of getting a "yes" (less chance that someone else has asked her already). The question is whether or not I've spent enough time with her already. She is a very, very friendly girl, and probably the genuinely nicest one I've ever met, and has been rather receptive to me already, so I like my chances, but I'd like to hear what the rest of you think.      TL;DR version: Okay to ask a girl out to prom (tickets go on sale in about a month, prom is in about two months) on your first date with her?

20090307072354AAGrnls	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think we'll ever get back together?	Ok, so I kinda fell in love with my best friend. My friend Ashley set me and my best friend, Alex, up together and Ashley has been a big help to Alex and I. He asked me out, I said yes, and then automatically he starts making out with me. Sounds like the perfect love story, right? Wrong. He ended our relationship 2 days later because he was still in love with his ex-girlfriend, who was a major ***** to him, btw. I was somewhat okay with it, because he said that he would ask me out again after he felt like he was ready to move on. So that happened about 1 month ago, and a few days ago, our friend Robyn tried to get Alex to come back to me. She told it to him straight, "You need to get over your ex, and go out with Tia (that's me lol). Madison (ex-gf) moved on, and she's talking to someone else. Now go get Tia." After that little pep talk, he comes up to me and starts making out with me. I was sure that we were getting back together after that. Nope. The next day, he tells me that he wants so much to love me the way I love him (I've told him a countless amount of times that I truly love him), but when he tries, it doesn't feel right. He loves me, but just as his best friend. So I wrote a note explaining how I feel. No I didn't go off bitching to him about how much of a dick he is, but just my motive when it comes to dating. Do you think that if I give him the note, then he'll somehow fall in love with me?      ***The Note***      Hey,      This isn't really a love note, but I'm gonna call it an explanation note. I'll start out by saying that I don't want to sound like a ***** at all to you. I know that you said you feel really bad, but don't worry about it. It happens to me a lot and I'm pretty used to it now. I'm just trying to find someone that is seriously trying to find their other half, and I thought that since you have the same intentions, well, that's when I started liking you. You're smart, funny, super hot, and it seemed like you were the one. We're still gonna be best friends, but I'll tell you now that it's gonna be hard for me to hang around you. Not that I don't want to hang out with you anymore, but it's gonna take a while for me to get over you. Idk, you just seem so perfect for me, but I really should've known better. I was never able to find that was actually serious about a relationship. I have to ask you this: please don't lead me on. When you know whether you love for sure or not, then you can make out with me. I'm asking you to do this, because I seriously thought that we were gonna get back together after we made out a few days ago. I am somewhat proud of myself, though. At least you were being truthful, instead of faking love. That would've been at least 20 times worse, with 50 times more tears. I'm glad that we can still be best friends for life, though. I still love you, Alex.                       -Tia xoxo

20090227133515AAb6Uvg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Crazy girlfriend of my bestfriend's ex is still having a grudge on her. freaks me out too!help!?	few months back,my bestfriend hooked up with a guy not knowing he already has a girlfriend back in his hometown. as soon as she founds out on this, she immedietly backs off but the girlfriend already knew about the boyfriend's betrayal so plans her way to ruin my bestfriend's life when its not my bestfriend's fault. if she'd knew the guy was a liar, she would obviously can get another man cus she's pretty and kind in heart. knowing all this should stop, my bestfriend put up some courage trying to explain and tell the crazy 'gf' the truth hoping that she wouldnt intefere her life any more. at first she was ok but recently, i read the 'gf's blog expressing her angst and plans to destroy my bestfriend and she even reveals my bestfriend's idenity. although she wont find my bestie but i felt devastated and i know that if my bestfriend knows about this she would cry her hearts out. what should we do now?

She says she sees me more as a friend, but every time we hangout, she treats me like her boyfriend; I pay for everything we do, & she even messes with me a little, like tickles my ears & she did something else but I don't want to get into too much detail.

20090227133916AA0U9L1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Love, boyfriend advice?	okay so i'm in high school and have a pretty long-time boyfriend.  he's wonderful, loves me to death, always cheers me up, hilarious, we have a lot in common, etc.. he's basically perfect and i can see myself with him in the future.  i know this sounds like a mindless high school thing to say but i honestly can see myself marrying him one day, having a family with him, and growing old with him.  we really do have a great relationship!      the only problem is that i REALIZE i'm only in high school.  i feel like i should be able to see what else is out there before it's too late, even though i'm pretty positive i'll end up with this boy again.  before this boyfriend, i experienced some boyfriend-type things but definitely not enough.  i basically want to take some sort of break from this boy so i can actually hang out with other guys romantically/not just as friends if i want to.  but i know i'll still love him through everything...      i've hinted at something like this but all i've done is hurt him and then deny that i meant what he thought (which is what i did mean haha).  he DOESN'T want to experience other girls, he is happy with me, which makes this difficult and one-sided...      so am i out of line for thinking these thoughts? do i not deserve to be with him? should i ignore these feelings because i actually love him and am happy with him? or should i mention this further? if so, how can i tell him this without hurting him again?      hope anyone can help! thanks!

And when he himself asks me things like, "isn't there anything you want to ask me" blah blah, I never feel its the right time or place. And so far I've not told him. He recently moved but we're still close friends, and last night for the first time I wanted to come right out and just tell him how much I missed him. And of course, as always, we were texting when he abruptly stops and our conversation just died. Its like he has a sixth sense to these things or something. Ugh! Is it just a sign?!

20090307080349AAsICtM	Family & Relationships;Friends	Would you tell her off?	My sister-in-law (hubby's sis) and I have a really rocky relationship. When my husband and I first started dating (6yrs ago), his sister was a young stay at home mom (16) she didn't have a drivers license (so she was at the house every time we were there) or many friends. She sort of clung to me and we began to develop a friendship. Right from the start I wasn't all that impressed with her but did feel sorry for her, I would invite her out to lunch with me once in a while and such.      Lately, she's been driving me NUTS. I've really tried to distance myself from her but she continues to call and come by. She calls me to rant about her other friends, husband, parents, pretty much anyone she can whine about. She's been telling me lies, and I HATE liars.       Now, here is my dilemma, if this weren't someone that I had to see in the future I would have told her off a LONG time ago, but since it is my husbands sister I don't want things between us to be awkward. Now, I know many of you will say to have my hubby deal with it, but I don't think that is wise. They already have a troubled relationship and he can be very hurtful with his words, especially to his 5 sisters.       My question is, do you think I should call her on it next time she is pissing me off, or should I just bite my tongue and let it go for the sake of it? My hubby tells me all the time that I should tell her, but she is a grudge holder and a crap talker, I'M POSITIVE that if I say something to her, she will turn around and whine about me to the rest of the people she knows. Please help.

20090307090049AAVePqU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	10 points if you can figure this out?	An older woman, married, who rarely speaks to me at all in work, has made two statements to me. There is a man I still have feelings for, but we have fallen out and act like we barely know each other in work. There is no flirting and very little talk. He flirts with everyone else, including this woman.   1. One day he is in the office, he calls me over and offers me a biscuit in front of everyone. She is also there. I take it. Then he offers her one as well. 20 minutes later in another room, in front of loads of people, she announces that he is giving out biscuits, then singles me out and says 'didn't you take one?'   2. He and I were ignoring each other so much that people noticed on a particular occasion and the situation was awkward. Next day, she comes into the room where I was and says what a fab job he has, she just saw all these beautiful young girls all over him and kissing him. I say well yeah, he is a nice man and she agrees, but sits down beside me, is acting weird and when I meet her later in passing I catch her looking at me smiling to herself.Even when I talk to her, she keeps this grin on her face.   Is she A. Into him/ involved with him and letting me know?      B. Aware (though I don't know how) that I have feelings for him and is letting me know she likes him?      C. Sussing out how I feel about him?      D.Completely unaware of how I feel and is into him and is accidentally pushing my buttons?

20090307090110AATSOqT	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do you make of this?	I have been in and out of town on business. As a single father, I have not seen my daughter in a few months. I do not speak to my ex for being so vindictive after our divorce(she wanted divorce not me 3 yrs ago). I had dinner with all of of my friends the other night(something we usually do every 6 months) and my one friend asked if I had seen my daughter lately and I said no - out of town and he said that he got a Christmas pic of my ex with her and my daughter. He said I guess she got married and then further said he was a relative on his wife's side of the family. My question is this: is it strange that my ex would send a family pic to one of my friends for Christmas but not invite him(and wife) to her wedding? Also, when we were married this friend of mine we maybe saw once a year as a couple - so we were distant. Also,  he was the only one asking about what I was doing lately. My daughter is too young to communicate to my ex of my personal business and I don't discuss that with my daughter either. I find this whole thing very strange. Do you think my ex is trying to use my friend to dig info out of me about my personal life?

20090307082600AADEucV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you say this guy really likes me?	This guy and I have known each other for five years and have been good friends for about three, ever since I graduated from college, and have been flirting quite a bit since last summer.      He was a prof in my college major so I saw him often. There was one instance that stands out in my mind (three years ago but still) and continues to bring a  smile to my face:      Senior year I had him for a class along with three other classes. Right before finals I was hospitalized for two weeks. I told my dad to email my four profs (this particular prof included) to let them know what happened. He did. This particular prof was the only one to either call or visit me (he called me and talked for about 10 minutes). I said "hello?" and without a hello he asked "what the hell happened to you?" He has a distinct voice so I knew who it was. I told him and he asked me what I was doing. I told him watching TV and he said "good. You have to get better cause I have something for you." Three weeks later I was making my rounds to my profs to figure out which finals I needed to make up. I stopped by his and he said "Lazarus is back from the dead!" and he started laughing but had warm eyes. I asked him about the final and he told me not to worry about it. He asked me if I had any scars (honestly the only personal question he has asked me) and I told him yes, two. He then said "I have something for you." He came back and gave me two large books of the subject the class I took was. Granted it's not your ideal "gift-giving" after a recently hospitalized person, but I cherished them as I thought it was a really sweet gesture. When I left he smiled at me and patted me on the back. That ws three years ago and I've never forgotten that.      Fast-forward to now where we have been keeping in touch a lot (we live several states away and can't see each other) through email and over the phone. Both of us have been flirting a lot. I really, really like him and cannot stop thinking about him but the age difference is quite large: he's 59 and I'm 25. But I honestly think he really likes me, too, but since he is painfully shy as am I, he has never said anything. I'm coming home for Easter where I hope we can get together. I've already told him and he said that was great news and told me when he'd be off; sounds like he really wants to see me.      So my question is, do you think he really likes me and wants to take it past friendship and is too shy to do so?

20090307081143AAugIHx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He's been back and forth?	we went out, he broke up, was distant, then relaxed slowly. i got over him. he saw me getting closer to other guys and tries to attract my attention. a few times. only when he sees me close to other guys.  i get distant again, carefully now, and with effort.  we have many common acquaintances and activities and see one and other about every other week, impossible to avoid. we may organize something together in future project. and he seems to call me a tad more than needed.  i think he might really like me, but he's played or been unintentionally back and forth before. i think i need to take care and keep being vigilant. we have common wishes in organizing something in our community and he's very good at organizing and initiative in projects and i have some complimentary skills and it's much easier to organize together. if we don't do it, very possibly no one will and we won't have what we want in our community.    thankyou!
20090307074929AAcqiUf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl trying to get back with her ex that she dated for 3-years.?	Okay, here is the background information on the situation:      I have a friend and she is trying to get her ex back, who she dated for 3 years and was talking about marrying. They broke up because of some trust issues. She kissed a guy and he found out and demanded that she not not or see the guy she kissed anymore. She denied his request and continued to see the guy because her boyfriend, at the time, was not around much and was trying to keep tabs on her, and that's why she kissed the guy in the first place because he was there to comfort her. He, also, didn't really fulfill her "needs" so she turned to the new guy on campus and simultaneously cheated and broke up with her boyfriend to date the new guy on she found on her campus.      She found out the guy, she met on campus, was a pompous jerk and controlling on top of that. Now six months after breaking up with her ex, the one she dated for 3 years, she decides she wants to get him back.      My question is: Do you think there is anything good that will possibly come from this? Have you ever known a situation like this to work out for the better?      Girl is 20 and the ex she wants to get back with is 21, if that matters.      My reason for asking is: We like each other a lot, but she is too emotionally hung up on her ex to start anything with me. So she has decided to try and win him back.

Is it their trust we try to possess ? is it both ? or, is it our own part/heart that we have given them that we claim to be ours ?

20090307080331AAu81yO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I found this email from my husband to his ex-fiance?	He said:   I know I hurt you, I'm sorry. I never wanted any of this. Ive never made a bigger mistake, ever. I never wanted any of this. I am lost and don't know what to do, I have no one to turn to, I have no answers myself.   I can't stop thinking of you.      Her reply wasn't much better...      I confronted my husband and he got angry with me and said i was insane and didn't understand the context and i had no right to check his email anyways. I checked after calling him to ask if there was any truth a rumour going around that he told his ex he was still in love with her and wanted her back, he said he never said anything like that but he was in touch with her again, so i looked for myself.      we have a son, almost 1 yrs old, there are so many complications, if we divorce whoever gets custody will live with our son but the other person won't see him very often at all due to distance and that i'm originally from a different country and would go back there.      i don't know what to do or say, any advice?

20090307085443AAg8qJv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I miss him...what do I do?	So I have a great life, I'm always busy with classes, work, social life. I have everything I want, I'm always out with friends, and I'm half the time at parties as well. I've also been meeting people, and going on trips. But I miss my ex...I try not to think about him, but something just doesn't feel right. Every time something great happens, I get a bit sad because I can't share my happiness with him. Its been about 5 months now since the breakup, but I miss him so much. I don't know what to do...any advice?
20090307081808AACtZUP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do they see me as little sis?	The guys at school always treat me like I'm their little sister. If we're at a party they'll make sure I don't have too much to drink, and that I get home alright.. but they never try to have a relationship with me. I've never had a boyfriend. They tend to complement me on the way I look a lot. Also they call me a lot just to talk. There's this one guy in particular who has been doing this with me since grade 9, and I was the first person he told when he knew he would be captain of the football team. At parties they'll want to dance with me, but then when another guy does they tell him to stay away from me.       Why do they do this if I'm they are not interested? Do they see me as little sis?

20090307082223AAFcLCy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help, i'm jealous of this guy?	Hey, Im a 17 year old guy. There's this guy I know whos the same age as me called Toto who I know from parties and social things and once I stayed at his friend's house after a party and we got to know each other better. I'm soooo jealous of him because he's kissed loads of good looking girls and has a pretty, intelligent girlfriend who he thinks he's in love with. I've only got off with 4 girls and never had a girlfriend, and even though totos good looking, I am too (not being arrogant, i know its about other things), and in terms of personality there's nothing really that puts him massively above me. I Mean he's a really nice, intelligent, guy but I am too (we get on quite well).    So   do you think all that will happen for me? is it just a matter of time?   can you give me any justification/reassurance for totos superior situation      ps. Please only constructive/positive answers, I don't need to brought down more by people.
20090307082650AAJXRsY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about this situation...........?	ok so I really like my ex boyfriend. I broke up with him about 4 months ago for someone else. He knows there is a secret but doesn't know what it is! Recently I told him I liked him again and he was just like I don't think I can trust you, I like you and if you tell me the secret we can move on from this! I told him I didn't want to tell him! Last saturday I went with a couple of friends to the dog track were he works. He kind of ignored me when I spoke to him! So then I asked my friend to find out how he really feels! He told him that he likes me but is shy! Im not sure what to do now? Should I leave it and let him come out of his "cave" or should I make him come out?? btw im 16!       sarah x x x

20090307085920AAJ1mPZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Awh, Come on. Read the whole thing. I need help?	So theres this guy,   Lets call him "Bob"      READ THE WHOLE THING PLEASE! :]      Okay,Well Bob is those guys that a lot of girls like..And well i was new this year.So when i came and i first saw him, I felt like an instant connection and i thought he was really good looking!Then i find out everyone else likes him?SO i thought i was just another one of those girls.I heard he never went out with anyone except this one chick but they broke up and he had now hated her. I was NEVER the girl that 'the guy' in school liked..Actually, no one really liked me before? Haha.. And well we started talking just as friends.. School started on late August. And,again, i had this really big crush on him.. but i didn't think "I" would ever have anything to do with someone like "him". So i kinda started giving up on him, early December.. Then i found out by his best friend, "Billy" that "Bob" liked me. I really couldn't believe it. So.. I was really excited cause this was gonna be my first real boyfriend. And it was gonna be him, the guy that everyone liked. So he asked me out on 1/8, we broke up 1/29. I broke up with him because people would tell me bad things about him, and how he didn't treat me like his girlfriend and that maybe he was ashamed of me? Lame, i know :/ So i ended up regretting that. But the day after we broke up, we decided we wanted to try again. So we got back together 2/2, and we just broke up again on 2/24. I haven't talked to him since then. But i really think he truly,deeply had strong feelings for me. I mean, if the whole school liked him and he only liked me, that should mean something.. right? And i haven't talked to him since then! :[ I have him every other day for first and last. He keeps looking at me.. Theres times when he starts looking sad all of a sudden. :/ And i really miss him. Like, i really think he was a special person. But the second time, HE broke up with ME, and i understood why. We were always really nervous around eachother, there was times when we weren't and we actually had good/fun talks. But most of the time we had that kind of 'elevator talk'. And he said that was the reason he thought this wasn't working out. And he wanted to see how we were as friends. But he hasn't talked to me since then :/ He hasn't texted me or whatever. Oh! And he's one of those REALLY REALLY shy guys. I'm not even kidding:/ So, i don't know if i should go up to him and say hi first? And try "friends'. But the thing is, i'm still not OVER him! I try and try.. but i just can't. He was perfect. And i miss him.. a lot. I want to try again, and this time i really think i'd put my all into the relationship. I think he feels the same way? But i'm not sure..      So, the question for you guys is.. What do you think? What do you think he's feeling? What do you think i should do?      I'm not asking for you guys to know,   Just THINK.      Please help a girl out :)
20090307085415AADEAcF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girl friend wants to have a 3some with me and her friend ... should I do it?	My girl friend and I have been dating for almost 2 years now and she said she wants to have a 3some, but I'm not sure if i should ... should I? She wants it to be a 2 female 1 male 3some. She said it's ok that I can have sex and fool around with the other girl. With her allowing me to have sex with another girl makes me second guess our relationship ... wondering if she really does love me. I asked her if she'd get jealous seeing me having sex with another female, and she said that she'd be hella turned on a lot from watching me do that. I don't know ... should I have a 3some with my girl friend?
20090307084450AACvZHy	Family & Relationships;Friends	I am so worried and confused! Please help?	This is hard for me to explain. I never used to talk to anyone, I was shy and a loner. BUT that has all changed now, I am a completely different person now and I can talk to anyone. My problem used to be that I didn't fit in in school and weekends, but that is slowly improving as time goes on. (but I still worry about not being like everyone else)Sometimes I don't fit in which causes me to lose all my confidence but at other times things are great and I feel part of the group.IT'S MOSTLY LARGE GROUPS THAT I STRUGGLE WITH What I am getting confused about is WHO to talk to, WHEN to talk to them and WHAT TO SAY. An example of this is in some lessons in school I am not familiar with the people I sit next to so I don't say anything. I look around and see everyone else talking and I worry that I am the odd one out. Another example is at lunch I usually have to go up to someone if I want to talk to them rather than viceversa. I worry about what to say to who and when. I rely on my two best friends too much but I have now realized that they're not very good friends and I want to get away from them as much as possible. One final example, yesterday I went on a school trip by coach (It went ok by the way) I was sat next to my best friend (Nick) infront was the Girl I fancy. At one point in the trip Nick said her name in a really low and peodafilioac vioce to get her attention. I would have done that except for the fact that I would have expected her to think it was really weird and not take it as a joke.       I worry about this everyday. I start collage soon which is a chance to start over because everyone new that I come across will have a completely open mind. A good first inpresstion is vital to be like everyone else. I am afraid that I will c*ck it up. I have changed so much but I am capable of being so much more. Please help.

I was rejected by 2 women in the past month because they found out I was still a virgin.  I am 23 and both of the women were my age.  I was talking to both of these women on the phone for a couple of weeks and met them 1 or 2 times. But when they brought up conversation about sexual experience and I said I was still a virgin, it was liked they paused for a while and ran quickly in the other direction.        It didn't matter that I had other good qualities about me.  I am a nice guy who knows how to treat women right, I have an college degree and I have a good head on my shoulders.  I have goals in life, I want to have a family someday, I am a good kisser, I am a gentleman on dates, I have a job, and I am always on time for dates.        But I guess all of that isn't good anymore.  I guess how I am in the bedroom is a huge factor for women these days.  I guess I won't get far because I'm still a virgin.  Whatever happened to their being a first time for everything?      Could someone please help me here?

I mean me and my boyfriend love each other and we want to spend the rest of our lives together. We even planned our future out. So is it ok? Or just a waste of time? Help?!?

20090307083420AAD4kDt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im shy. How do I get my first girlfriend? I really want a girl?	I am 18 and never had a girlfriend. I am trying to work on my shyness. All of my friends have a girlfriend. Even my younger brother does.      Only my closest friends know it bothers me. They told me 7 months ago to just be patient and I will get a girlfriend. It didn't happen. They lied to me. So now I want to purposely find someone quickly.      I've waited too long for the "right girl" as everyone says. I would rather "rush things and get hurt". I just want my first kiss. My time is running out.
20090307075225AAUxgJp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm 18 and my girlfriend that I have been dating with for almost 2 years decided to wait on sex.?	We are convinced that its better to wait until we get married. so my question is...is it worth the wait. and is it the right thing to do? like is there any other couples doing the same? because all of my friends do it all the time... just currious         btw she's going to be 17 in april, i know it sounds like I'm a pedophile but we started dating back when I was 16 and she was 15
20090307085957AAtNnFf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I tell which guys like me?	I have a couple of friends at school that I think like me but I'm not sure. I need help!      The first ones name is Ricky. I kind of like him and he's always smiling at me. He really sweet at times but I'm not sure of what way he thinks of me. He's also really cute. And, another thing is that at my school, if you like someone you usually get your best friend to ask the person you like if they like you back. Well, Ricky's friend came up to me and said, "What's up?" and I said "Nothing." and he said "Do you like Ricky?" and i said, "No.".     To me, that seemed pretty random. And then after we were done talking, Ricky's friend walked away and went and said something to Ricky. Then for the rest of the day, Ricky wasn't being as nice as usual. If anything, he was being rude.      The second one is Nate. We were texting last night and i asked him who he liked. He said two of my friends and me a little. Then i told him i liked him a little too. But he's liked me before but it didn't work out because he asked me out through someone and i said no. But i've heard many things about Nate, one being that he only goes out with girls to get in their pants. And at school, Nate is rude and has no respect for anyone. But when were texting, he's really nice.       The 3rd one is a boy named Ron. I used to like him but not anymore. I dont know, i just look at him and i dont like him. He's always making jokes and tells EVERYONE that theyre beautiful like if you talking to him you could say hi and he would reply saying youre beautiful. He's wierd. But the closer we get the wierder his questions and jokes get. Like sometimes he'll ask me if i want to have sex with him and if i want to have a 3some or a 4some with him his friend and my friend. He also does this to my friend. I really need help with this guy figuring out if he likes me or not.      The 4th one is a boy named dalton. And i dont really like him but im not sure. He always says hi to me except for yesterday. He just looked at me and didnt say anything. And usually i like it when he talks to me but when he doesnt, i want him to really bad. And sometimes he doesnt pay attention to anything but me. For example, a few days ago, after school, he was riding his bike with his friend and i was walking home. And then he came up to me and we were talking. Then when i got to my house, i was opening my garage and then he turned around on his bike and said bye, ill see you tomorrow and then he ran into a trashcan. The he got all embarrassed and rode his bike away.       I dont know with ones like me. I dont even know if they like me for me or to have sex. PLEASE HELP!!

We talk to each other on MSN, in chatrooms and on the phone. We are not officially a couple yet, but things are slowly heading that way I hope.    My question is.....how often should I see her? She is online for hours every day and I could see her for 2-3 hours every day if I wanted to....but lately she just doesnt have the same excitement for me when I show up online. How often should I see her to hopefully ignite that spark again and not let her get tired of me?

20090307084904AA7MITA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why am I afraid of my own boyfriend?!?	I know I asked this question twice, but no one answered it and I really need help. At my friend's baby shower, I kissed another guy by accident. My boyfriend is very violent, dominant, and controlling. The guilt was eating me alive so I foolishly decided to tell him last night. He looked very upset. He asked me if I kissed him back, and I honestly said yes. He looked so pissed, like he was about to kick my ***. And like he was going to kick the other guy's ***. He scolded me for like an hour complaining how I didn't love him and we've never had sex in a year so I'm probably too busy sleeping with other guys. He started cussing at me and throwing stuff around the room, and it brought me to tears. I freaking cried myself to sleep. How should I talk to him now? I'm afraid if I try to even bring up this situation again he'll hit me. I'm also afraid that he'll come in contact with the guy who kissed me. How should I overcome being this scared?

20090307083922AAsDtHr	Family & Relationships;Friends	The one who did nothing got all the credit??? Pls advice im feeling depressed?	Ok, so me and my so called friend had to do this assignment and she is not the type who works. She is too lazy and not smart when it comes to studies. She kept postponing the work and delaying and i had to do everything on my own because i wasnt like her. I do everything on time and i am very responsible. All she did was the printing which anyone can do. Even that when i call her and tell her to print something she would say things like oh its too late now and that i should have told her earlier (when there is like an hour left for her to print one page).         Anyway, i did everything and it was now time for the lecturer to asess us where the lecturer would ask questions and we would be graded according to how much we answered. Before the assessment i sent every document to my friend. And she had memorized everything. I was nervous during the assessment so didnt know what i was talking and even the words didnt fit into a sentence.       Before the assessment i had talked with my lecturer many a times to clear my doubts about the assignment and answered many of her questions.          The reason i didnt com[plain to her about my friend was because i didnt want to ruin my friendship.      Anyway i am feeling depressed now because i did all the work and some one else is getting all the credit. And the lecturer doesnt know what i went through to put this assignment together.       The assessment hold only like 4% of the total marks, the rest is on an individual report. but I think about this every single day, even in my dreams i see it.          What should i do? Telling the lecturer now is of no use.And this has happened to me in the past so im sad when i think that when im doing a job people will start taking advantage of me like this and i want get my due credit

"ever since you left me everything has been falling apart. i need you." i still talk to her to make sure shes alright. she said that im the only thing thats keeping her alive. for about a week when i call her no reply. its never like this and if she cant talk she always sends a quick message explaining why. it kinda makes me worried. id hate it if something happened to her. i know i shouldnt get involved again but she makes it impossible...      so i guess my question is is there a way i cant get involved without worrying about her? is that possible?

20090307082744AAGdKWP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can a girl know if a guy is being nasty or flirting?	I'm just asking because it's very difficult for a 16+ teen nowadays I feel to tell if a guy is just being mean because he doesn't like you, or if it's code for "actually I quite like you"   In my case, a guy that sits by me in science will have no problem doing experiments with me, asking for help and we both help each over out if the teacher puts us on the spot with a question. He looks me in the eye and when happy he'll smile and say something that will make me smile. That's the good side of him however...   He will put me down sometimes when doing experiments saying how I will mess it up he will also sometimes use a swear word about me and my odd outbursts of paranoia will get him cross and he'll upset me.   But I don't know if it's brought on by friends of his, as he is often only mean when they around but he's had emails off me telling him not to do it and he'll be in the next day telling his mates about emails that were meant to be private.   Overall, I don't know what to think I've been trying to decide whether him or not myself, all the girls think he's attractive, which isn't a good thing in my case, so I need to know if I should be making more an effort to talk to him or just keep things as they are. Help!

20090307084650AAz8mEA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to tell what guys really think?	Okay, so I'm gonna make this as short as possible...      There's this guys that im pretty crazy about, and he knows it. We've met each other a good lot when we're out, and we usually just spend the night fooling around for like 2 hours..but in a totally mature way, if that makes sense?      So like we were always texting and stuff and flirting as much as possible and we were getting on great. So he asked me would it work if we tried goin out and i was like, we can only try. You see, our friends hate each other with a passion...      So after it didnt seem to work out in school, after we were technically "going out", we talked about it the next day in school for liike an hour..      He was like i really like you and i wanted this to work, but its not..      I agreed, but i didn tell him that if our friends hate each other, it shouldnt affect us the way he thinks it does. So anyway, we've decided to go back to the way it was, with like still talking and hooking-up, just not like officially..      And his best friend is having a party on the 16th, and me n my friends were invited because he wanted me there...      so we talked again, and he was like, after a while, when we know each other better, we could try going out again, but properly..i was ecstatic, but didn tell him obviously:)      So basically, I'm ask is, do you think things could work out? like, im not sure if he really does like me or what? Because if it doesnt work out now, because of our friends, how is it gonna work our after a while..?      any help much appreciated =]

E.G: mess around and get into trouble, etc.   I'm abit shy not that shy, people think i'm shy, but i'm not, it's just that i don't talk much.       Would girls like a boy like me that don't talk much or do they prefer a guy that a good talker?   And if there are girls on here about 14 - 16 what do you think of me?      I think thats another thing why girls don't want me or they stay with me and they will get bored of me cause i don't talk.      I can't help being quiet, i'm so used to it and i like being that way.      Thanks You

20090307084337AA07aWT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a problem, and It's eating me up inside!?	Ok people so here's the story. A few months ago, my cousins were at a wedding, and when they came back they were telling me about this guy that's really good looking, and a great guy and blah blah blah. So my cousins husband, was telling me how much he loves him (Because he knows him really well), and that he would love to hook him up with one of his relatives. So he showed me his picture, and to my surprise he really was a very attractive guy. So day by day, i started to think like any girl would "What if?" So one day my cousin sees the guy at the wedding, and tells him that he has someone for him, so the guy gives my cousins husband his number. A few days later the wedding guy calls my cousins husband, and tells him he really wants to see (me). So my cousins husband brings him by my work, and by this point i'm so nervous and excited. So he comes in my work and is the nicest guy ever! and even better looking in real life. After he left, my cousins husband didn't call be back until about 3 hrs later (mind you the unknown was eating me up inside). When he calls me, the first thing he says is , "I'm going to tell you everything straight up". Then i knew it was bad. The wedding guy said that I'm not his type...then said he thought i was going to be someone else. Now remember when i told you my cousins went to a wedding? Well that someone else was my cousin (and best friend) that he met at that wedding. He thought my cousins husband, was going to show him her. So while I was taking in the news, my heart sank, and I was a little upset. I mean, I didn't know the guy, but you just can't help how you feel. And now he still wants to see her. I love my cousin to death, her and I are inseperable, I just don't want to feel attraction to the guy that can potentially be hers. What do i do? How do i stop myself from feeling this way? I want them both to be happy.

20090307083509AACB5mH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So i like this guy but I don't know if he likes me?	Well, i like multiple guys. I'm going to give a description of each. Tell me which one you think is best for me. (Im very moody, but also nice, i can stand up for myself, extremely creative, i dont think im ugly, i can be a bit stubborn but overall most of the time understanding)      Guy #1) We call this one R. He likes to be annoying. I've liked him for 1 and 1/2 years. Asked him out twice, said no both times. Extremely smart. Very geeky, not that attractive, but great smile.      Guy #2) We'll call him B. He is very serious, he is good at his work and he likes to play sometimes. Knows when playtime is playtime and not to mix it with work time. Very attractive. Went out with my best friend (not on purpose, but she knew i liked him and were not friends anymore). Their relationship didn't last long.      Guy #3) We'll call him D. He is very obnoxious. I've known him for 4 years. He loves the Beatles(as do I) and he has curly blonde hair. We get along great but sometimes I just don't understand him. He never re-answers my emails sometimes. Sometimes we read eachothers minds. I've dated him 4 times before and I dumped him all 4 times because he's either ignored me, or I just didn't like him.      Guy #4) Lets call him J. He is not attractive at all, but he is very outgoing and he is very friendly. Very smart and talks to me alot. Just transferred onto my bus, and always sits with me. IHave all my classes with him except one period. I think he definitely likes me, but is too shy to say anything. I once admitted to liking him, but he had a gf at the time, and they broke up the same week.      All of these guys....which one is for me? Please be in-depth. I will give a Best Answer :-)   Thanks in advance.
20090307081835AApVDs4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do women say hurtful things when they are mad?	I know this goes for many other women as well, but my girlfriend and I recently got into a fight and she says some hurtful things to me. She broke up with me. It seems like she does not see all the great thigs I have done in ther life and is only pointing out the negative. I was jealous and possesive the past few weeks and i regret it. Why does she say things that hurt me when she is mad? I know my sister does the same thing, but why do you women say things you dont mean in a fit of rage?      Also If you had a good thing in a man, but were upset with him because he was neeedy and possesive for one weekend ( I felt insecure at a bad time for her) Do you evetually remember all the great things that I did? Do you begin to miss not seeing and talking to me? This was a good relationship up til this happened. All family loves me and mine loves her etc. Do you think she will come around? She has not taken my pictures off of her apartment wall.

20090307090332AAOKxg7	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding photography, what would you have?	I am a wedding Photographer from the UK and I work for wedding elegance by national photographer.    I have always wanted to do a little more at weddings as people seem to catch just a small part of their wedding (the day its self) and miss ff  all the planning and parties.      What I have done is offered a complete package that mixes photo and video, from the complete events.   with two photographers ( one male and one female)  we cover the stag and hen nights ( with select images)   give posing lesions  so that the photography on the day is easier and the couple look better.   we also cover the rehearsal, wedding day. receptions and first dance and some of the night.      I have been asked a few times by couple if I would come of honeymoon with them to shoot the romantic times and fun that they are having ( not the bedroom, but you know what I mean)      Do you think its a good idea to offer a complete package that covers everything?      I think that as my style of photography is unique to me, and that I can put together all the photos in to the albums as required and not have a mix. Also that honeymoon photos you would only really get one person from the couple in at any one time rather than them together doing things.      Have your say

20090307074030AAdpbzT	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is Love worth chasing?	Long *** story... so here goes...      I was in a semi-long relationship for 6 months... and have came to love this girl soo much, she meant/means the whole world to me... but there is a problem...      When we first started dating everything was fine and dandy but about a month into our relationship she began flirting with other guys and stuff...this made me angry/sad so i asked her to stop and i was going to break up with her...but she said she would and i belived her. so she stops for a few months. then starts back... and the same thing happend i asked her to stop and she did for a while...but recently, about feb. 5 or 6th she started that flirting again and was talking to some boy on the phone...i found out and she freaked out and was crying and said she loved me but liked him and she broke up with me... i mean i was hurt yea. because she IS the first love of my life, and she started dating him. but she broke up with him a day later and was begging me to date her again because she wanted to be with me forever and she said she loved me. so my friends and all tell me not to do it, but being blinded by love i started dating her again....but it felt different this time...i mean i still had the same feelings for her but i could tell she was different... like all the small things in love, she didnt do... kinda hurt and still does...but we were going along pretty good, other than a few SMALL arguments every NOW and THEN...not like everyday all day or anything... but this monday i was at her house, and she was all over me saying she loved me and having sex etc... but tuesday she told me she wanted to talk....so im like ok... and she tells me that she dont want to be with me anymore, that she doesnt love me and that getting back with me was the biggest mistake of her life... and that she wanted to be single. and that i was mature and she was immature and that she wasnt ready for a serious relationship. these words hurt sooooo bad.... the pain is hard to explain. but she started dating that ugly kid that she was talking to on the phone again... so i took my friends advise and told her not to talk to me and if she wanted to be with him then fine.       but she called me last night, and i asked her why and she said she dont know, that she NEEDS me to still be there for her and still be her friend...      im so confused about all of this.... this tells me that she maybe does love me, just afraid of love...         but i took it better this time than i did the first time...      but i really really really do love this girl, and i do want to marry her...i think about her 24-7 and dream about her and just cant get her out of my mind....even while we were dating but even more now...i guess you dont realize how much you love someone until you lose them.      but this comes to my question....      Should I wait around for her to grow up and mature? Most of my CLOSE friends tell me to slightly move on and that she will come around realize what she has done and she will be suprised to see that im there for her or that im not there for her. and she will see that i really do care about her..      but some of my friends tell me to move on that she's not worth it...but deep down i know she loves me... i just think she is immature and still a girl...she just is seeing what other options are out there... but she told me last night i was like her best friend....         So, should I keep in contact and stay friends with her? and just move on for now? but i find it hard to date when i know i love someone else....

20090307083843AAeQnJz	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What do I do about been my best friends bridesmaid when there is so much arguing?	I have been friends with V for eight years.  We work together and have been through so much.  One of them was when her ex husband walked out on her and her new born baby to shack up with some one else.  Now the lady in question is getting married again and she has asked me to be the bridesmaid..  Now the problem is that she has also asked a good friend from her school to be a bridesmaid who is going out of her way to make my life difficult.  First off she got so involved with the wedding plans and poo pooed any ideas that I tried to come up with and generally made me feel uncomfortable.  I thought the best thing to do is to step back and allow her to help V organise the wedding and for me to organise the hen weekend. Now she is trying to interfere with the hen week and sent an awful  e-mail to everyone going on the hen weekend saying that I'm a terrible friend as I haven't helped with the wedding organisation.     My close friend is spending a lot of time with her school friend and I feel like I'm been pushed to the way side.     I haven't spoke to the bride to be fully about this as its not fair for her to be bogged down with it all but I know full well the other bridesmaid has.  They are both out tonight and I asked if I could come along as well just to try and lighten the mood for the hen weekend and my close friend said no.      Now I feel that I don't want to go the hen weeknd or wedding.      Any ideas out there for me?

20090227135038AA1efLI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I need to feel that I'm not alone in this!!!!!?	I have always been very worried about what others thought of me. During my adolescent years and my adult years until I started becoming bitter and cynical after years of being betrayed and used up emotionally, bc of my "need to please "everyone around me. I started to speak up...and sure enough, people around me weren't used to it so then I went from the doormat to a ***** in their eyes...   I am so torn. A part of me now feels its my fault and only my fault that I'm not friends with certain people anymore and the other part of me tells me that they treated me like crap for years and I never said anything and when I treated them the same...they dumped me.      Anyone?
20090227134508AAmvwaX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get her to go further?	I'm an 18 year old guy, been going out with this girl I'm totally in love with for about a year now. We can never be alone, we always have to see each other in public places, although a couple of times we managed to be alone and it was really amazing. I know that she has a freak in her and i want that freak to come out, we make out and she's really into it. I always try to touch her boobs and sometimes I manage to, but not under the bra, she would take my hand off.   I never got under her pants either.    We don't plan on having sex, but i really want to go further with her.   Thanks in advance!
20090227134618AAsrVhc	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How to get my parents to think I'm a good kid again?	Okay so I've been a halfway decent child my whole life. I don't do drugs, smoke, drink, have sex. I don't do anything bad like that.      Recently I started talking to this friend of mine, he is a boy, I am a girl. He's 16, I'm 15. We talk every day right, ever since January 1st. Every day we've been talking. I tell my friend everything we talk about. Her grandma checked her daughters email (my friend) and saw one conversation me and this guy had. It was not a good conversation... about porn, sex, and stuff. I wasn't talking about that I ever did anything like that before and neither has he. I mean he watches porn, but that's just a problem he's working on stopping. We're all christians here so things are a lot worse in my parents eyes than in other parents eyes.      They want me to stop contact with this guy immediately. I can't just STOP talking to him altogether. Honestly, he isn't a bad guy. He's working on becoming a better person anyway. I can't believe how my parents can just think he's a bad influence just because of one conversation. They haven't even ever met the guy.      And now my parents know I still talk to him. But it's not about bad things. They think I need help and need new friends. What is up with that? I know they're trying to protect me, but this is just going waaay too far.      How can I gain the trust of my parents back with them thinking I'm a good kid again? And also let them realize that it's not nice to judge a person before they even meet them..

20090227134952AA1d9aI	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Help when I text my ex B/F that I was pregnent, he came to see me a week later & told he had a vasectomy?	It took him two days to reply to my text and he asked What do you mean? So I called him and he ignored me & was only texting me for almost a whole week he was asking to see me so we can talk, He kept changing the times when he can see me. And when he finally came down to speak to me in his car he looked at my test results and than told me he Had a vasectomy and asked me if I ever been with anyone while we were together, so I told him is that how he thought of me because we went out on & off for a year and half before I decided to get intimate with him. It took me over a year to get intimate with him and he thinks Im going to right away sleep with some other guy & if he had a vasectomy why was he wearing a condom most the time. I did not say anything else to him accept cry the whole time. He broke up with me for a very shallow reason, he made up some lie about how he cant see me because I was not a citizen yet & that it would be a risk to his career since he works for US customs. I know his coworker so I called him and asked if that was true and he told me that my ex b/f was a total lier. He also said that no one at work likes him, that he was arrogant and thinks he is better than everyone which was very suprising for me to hear. So since he has made outragious lies to me before I know he is lying about the vasectomy. Everyone that knows him outside his work tell me that he is a good guy, for our entire relationship he has treated me very well & has very good manners. He knows that if he abondens me I will have no choise but to get an abortion. He is really confusing me because he ignores me & wont even acknowledge that Im pregnent yet when I text him telling him that I got into an accident he came for a few minutes to check if i was ok, tried to hug me the whole time and left & never called again. So I text him telling him that I was going to pray for him, & he replied that he has been working double shifts 16 hours a day since I gave him the news & that he will leave to another state soon to relocate with his job, & he will try to come by to say Good bye to me before he leaves! He never mentioned leaving before, is he trying to run away from me? I dont understand, Maybe a guy can understand this? If he thinks I have been with another man, why would he want to come to say good bye to me or try to hug me? He is ignoring me most tthe time & when we do talk he is nice to me yet would not even mention or acknowledge that I am pregnent. He will talk about work or other stuff. I keep texting him & he wont reply. The only thing he keeps asking me is why I want to pray for him? My friends told me that if I keep texting him, the faster he will try to leave & want to get away even more! He does not like any drama & never argues with anyone, he speaks very calmly no matter what the situation is! I want to get through to him with out insulting him in any way becuase If I do he will avoid me & hang up. How do I get through to him with out any drama or involving his friends into this?

20090307075151AATB4Zx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He cheated on me... how can I move past this?	So  me and my boyfriend of 6 months broke up last night because he finally confessed that he cheated on me.  It was with one of his good friends and he said that he only did it once and that it was a moment of weakness and that it also screwed up her social life too.   We talked for hours because I wanted to work things out because I know the only reason he is acting like this is because he is afraid of what might be, he is afraid to be happy.  But in the end I realized that he doesn't have any feelings for me anymore because he has convinced himself that he won't be happy with anyone, that he deserves to feel numb inside for the rest of his life.  I am starting to wonder why I feel so bad after everything that has been said and done?  How can I move on with my life so I can be happy again?  And once I am over him how can I be happy with someone else?  Please give me advice on what I can do to make it all better.

20090307080659AAUErKF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my girlfriend is playing mind games with me....?	OK so a few weeks ago my gf went out on a girls night out and i didn't care at a cause i thought i could trust her. so a few weeks pass and this is guy and my best friends work recognizes my gf in a picture as they were looking at them with his camera. This shocked my best friend and he had no clue he knew her. so he asked him how they knew each other and he said they hang out all the time. A few weeks ago, when it was girls night out, they met up at the bar he went back to her place with all of the girls and "hung out". So my best friend continued to ask questions and he didn't tell him i was dating her yet. so he asked if they "did" anything and the kid replied "well we made out, that's it though".    Now with that story out there, she never admitted to making out with the kid but she did admit to him and his friend coming back to her place to hang out with all the other girls that night. I dont know if i should believe her. This kid has no reason to lie to me. He didnt even know she had a boyfriend. There is a lot more than just this problem but this is the one im mainly stuck on..      Is this lines to kick the ***** out the door?      keep in mind we've been together for 2 1/2 years.

20090307082643AA66Jiu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Pressured to sex but not exactly sex?	me and my boyfriend have been together for 2-3 months.we don't spend a lot of time together; i like to keep my space and let him breathe. he comes over to my house about once a week. he tells me that he doesn't have any boundaries, meaning he'd lose it to me if i wanted to. I'm not ready to have sex with him .. but the thing is, he sorta keeps pressuring me to do things close to sex. he tells me to do things and he constantly keeps begging and telling me to do it after i refuse.      the question is, am i being too strict for this since "it's normal for adolescents to do dirty things and have sex already" ??      should i just end it since it really seems like its lust not love?
20090307083152AAP4YDf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about him?	So....i've liked this kid for the longest time. I have him on both my msn and face book and we used to talk a lot. We also have the exact same classes, same time so we're always around.      After 4 months or so of liking this guy. I muster up enough courage and I told him i liked him and was rejected :(. Shortly after i noticed he also blocked me on msn and face book. I'm just wondering why he would do that.      Anyways, i still notice though, he's able to maintain eye contact for a longer period of time with me, other times, he looks away every time i look in his general direction usually at someone answering a question.      Since we also have the some of the same friends, we sometimes end up walking to the bus stop together with them.       The weirdest part about this all is..when we bump into each other, he finds it difficult to look me in the eye, when we're with friends, he's always asking me direct questions, and always wanting to know my opinion about things. When we're in class, we keep eye contact sometimes, and sometimes he turns away when i look in his direction.      Can someone please explain why he acts like that? like was he just really surprised when i told him about me liking him and he didn't know what to do at the time? does he like me but isn't sure whether to give it a shot, or is he just being "normal"?      What should I do, cause i don't want to make this situation any more awkward and worse than it already is?

She has only been to one party ever, but this is where it scares me.  This one party, and the only time she ever got drunk, she made out with another girl.  Now this is something she wouldn't do non drunk.  Which worries me what she will do at other parties, possible with another man.

20090307084541AAMXE7o	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are men such jerks?	Ok, I guess not all men are jerk, but seriously you decide. My husband works 2nd shift Monday through Thursday. So he goes into work at 2:30 and gets home about 2:30. While he is sleeping in the morning I am getting our kids up, getting them fed, bathed and so on. I try not to wake him up before 9:30. Our daughter who is 2 and a half is a complete brat. Our bedroom door is broken so she tends to just push it open and wake up my husband. I can understand that this is frustrating cause everyone needs there sleep. Now to my problem. On Friday, Saturday and Sundays he doesn't work. We just moved into this apartment and during the day with the two babies all week I unpacked all of the boxes and cleaned the house making it live-able for us. Last night being Friday we went through all of our clothes and organized them since we do not have a dresser it is still a mess, but at least it is all put away in the closest. Then he decides to go through one of the bags that has all the girl's shoes and just throws them on the living room floor and leaves them there. After I spent all the time cleaning and organizing that room. Anyways, I wake up with our kids every morning while he gets to sleep. Shouldn't he go to sleep normal one night so that I have a chance to sleep in? Why should I be the one doing everything with our kids? Why can't he just grow up and be a dad and a good husband? He isn't even romantic. You know what we did for Valentines Day? Absolutely nothing! We stayed the night before at a hotel that I booked and ate PIzza Hut and the night of Valentines Day I cooked Chicken Alfredo. I COOKED! How is this fair? Anyways, thanks for letting me vent and please feel free to post your feelings.

20090307085637AA1EiOo	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Question about Infidelity...?	Hey guys. I decided to ask this question in this category because I feel like I will get better and wiser advice.    I have a question that I think refers to infidelity but to answer it PLEASE watch this video first:       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVTyLqkez...       Here's my question:   In about the middle of the video, when beyonce is sitting down in front of a mirror and her man is confronting her about another guy, she turns to him and says, "why are you so jelous.. it's not like I slept with him"... and he looks shocked and says "what?... then it gets turned around and he actually says it to her.. well, what is the video trying to say by that? what is that statement implying? do you think her/him saying "its not like i slept with the other person" is actually saying that that did happen(because why would that thought even come to mind if there is nothing going on)?

My first girlfriend i agreed to go out with (because she asked me) because i was desperate. She is a ***** (also said for 3rd person views of others).      But this girl is the right girl i have the highest feelings for. But here is where the really question is. In these past 2 weeks, she has been discovering "turn ons". Its been happening to both of us. Because we've been always so romantic, till we've actually been doing the right things to turn each other on.      Last night i asked her, "If we actually could get a moment alone from everyone, would you have sex?" (a real question)   She replied "yeah...". I mean i really like her, but i don't know if i would be ready (much more than her). We are both virgins, could ya guess?      Thanks =)

She said she wanted a break because she didnt want to have to split time with her friends for me. I told her we should just break up and if we break up im not comming back. I looked on her mypace and she seems happy. I thought we had a good relationship and i took her virginity. Do you think she misses me at all? we havnt talked since we broke up. Should i just wait for her to contact me?
20090307090119AAPa0Uc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He lusted after an anorexic Canadian chick... is he just not that into me?	My boyfriend and I had a conversation a while ago about how it's inevitable for a guy to be attracted to women other than his girlfriend, and all he can do is not act on it. We talk about marriage often, and he treats me really well and goes out of his way to make my life easier. Last Saturday, he went to a party and there was this girl. She's gorgeous (I know this because of the photos of her with arm around my bf). I felt weird about these photos when I saw them, even though I had no idea at that point that he was into her. The night afterward, we talked about the attraction to other people and he commented that it doesn't happen often for him to get "worked up" over another girl and think about her for a couple days. I asked him how many times in our 9-month relationship it's happened, and he said only once. Eventually I pried it out of him that it was this Canadian party-girl, and now I'm super-jealous and pretty darn annoyed. Is lusting after unavailable girls just a guy thing, or should I be worried? Everyone says I'm prettier than she is, so I'm going to pretend they're not lying and it's not my problem. Yikes. Guys, do you still lust after hot chicks after you've found your wife-to-be, or is the lusting because she's not really the one you want?
20090307090143AANTEfO	Family & Relationships;Family	My father is drinking himslef to death?	my mother and father split recently and the sell of the house brought my father into some money, he is an alchoholic and bi polar. he has been drinking non stop since with no one stopping him and a girlfriend who is an x achoholic that just seems to be enabling him or maybe using him. i am 29 i have a brother 26 and two little ones 16 and 13. my 26y/o brother doesnt know what to do and just seems to be ignoring the situation b/c its to difficult and he has a family of his own. i want to stop my father! he is not stable, he is bipolar and he is going through his money like water what can i do legally to freeze money make him unable to use it and unable to say what is best for him legally? and then put him in treatment. believe me he is a train wreck and needs stopping before he kills himself or even worse someone else. i reallly need to swiftly stop him. he is in his late fifties never sober enough to speak to. help me stop him.
20090307090416AAdqnEg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do I feel so bad?	I met this guy that was in a bad marriage about 7 months ago. I automatically got the impression he was interested in me. I just brushed it off.. I met him through mutual friends and most of what I heard from his marriage was from our friends. we never brought it up. We both knew nothing would ever happen between us since he's married and I let him know that. I put it straight that I wasn't interested in an affair and would only have a romantic relationship if he wasn't married. From what I got from his wife who I only met once was that he talked to me online more then he talked to her and that he never wanted me to meet her and all this other stuff. I got worried and started analyzing everything between me and him trying to figure out what he was thinking. I finally got the impression that I was the girl after his marriage and wasn't sure how comfortable I was with that. I did get that impression when i told him i would have a relationship if he wasn't married but didn't know he'd keep out friendship a secret or make it out to be something that has to be a secret. Everyone always looked at us and I could tell they were wondering. I get nervous and it really effected me I told him I no longer wanted to talk to him online. He got mad and all of a sudden started saying how much he loves his wife.  then his wife and her friend started playing games online. Saying things like some people i swear ugh or i only have a few choice fews to say bout' those type of people and that chicks hit on married men. I got pissed and dealt with it in a immature way which i regret. I could have been over thinking also. Anywho now he won't talk to me since i put everything out in the open and I feel this is good. but also I feel bad b/c he was a good friend and I made it more then it had to be. His wife is a ***** (literally that's what everyone says) and he was unhappy I know but I just didn't want to be known as the girl after his marriage or the one having an affair so i felt overwhelmed with a situation I wasn't used to and ended up hurting him. I feel horrible. I wished I would have just let people think what they want and been friends with him. Maybe then I wouldn't have hurt him so much.

20090307090955AAXWBua	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What Should I Do About My EX Boyfriend?	My ex is a musician. Last year he thought he was "the sh*t" so he smoked cigs which led to smoking weed, which led to cocaine. He thought it fit his "rockstar lifestyle" (he got way to ahead of himself). Then it eventually caused a lot of problems, so he got clean for a few months.      When I met him, he hadn't done anything in about a month or two, but did cocaine on/off while we were dating. (Whenever he got depressed, he would resort to drugs) He always came to me when he was using, and I always talked him out of it. In fact, he tried to kill himself when he was high, but I stopped him.       He dropped out of high school to pursue his music/art career, and ever since then we've had a lot of problems. He became even more depressed, very lonely, he became really focused on his work, and I'd only get to see him once a week.      About a week or two ago he told me he was very depressed. I asked him to talk to me about it, and he agreed he'd call me when he wasn't busy. But a few hours later, we got into an arguement (online) and he didn't talk to me for a few days.      A few days later, I IM'ed him, and he was acting very, very strange. I asked him if he was high but he said no. He was acting like it though.   Then a few days after that he called me and told me he doesn't want to be "tied down" in a relationship because his music was going well for him.      A day after that, I saw him in the mall hanging out with his friends. Then I get a call from him several hours later. He sounded really paranoid, and told me he left me because he thinks I was going to f*ck him over, and he told me he never really loved me (bull)      We haven't spoke really after that, but a mutual friend of ours spoke to him, and found out my ex is smoking weed once a week. I think he's repeating the same mistakes as last year, he got way too ahead of himself, and when he saw his music could take off, he does drugs. I think the reason he broke up with me is because he wants his "rockstar lifestyle" and doesn't want me talking him out of doing drugs. ("tying him down")      Our friend doesn't know that he does...(or did?) cocaine, but I want him to be aware of it so he can keep an eye out for my ex, since my ex doesn't want to talk to me.      Do you think it'd be a good idea if I told his friend or not? I'm scared his friend might tell my ex I said something or I'm scared he might do something. I'm not so concered about the weed, I know it's not THAT dangerous, but I'm scared he might become addicted, or he may even go back to cocaine, or he could even be doing both.      What should I do?

20090307095234AAJ0Cr2	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is my friend like this?	Okay so my friend(annie) and I got in a fight 2 months ago, we're talking but to me I am not going to be fake and act like we're besties.       On an early release day (we get off of school 2hrs early) and I invited 2 girls to go see a movie with me. I assumed since we were not in good terms not to invite her, plus she had gotten together with these other girls for the past couple of weekends.    Long story short she asked what I did and I said I went to the movies, she found out I went with my 2 friends and she was like "Why wasn't I invited?", all day to my friend Holly who she hung out with.      So how come since I did not invite her to ONE thing she acted like this when she gets together every weekend with the same people.
20090307091154AADwO53	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I asking too much?	I don't know, me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 7months now. And he says he loves me. He is really sweet. LIke I know he cares about me...in someway. But I don't believe he loves me. or ever will as of right now.I don't know...like...he plays video games for about four hours a day, most of the time more. And I'll just be sitting there. And i'm not into video games, but he said that if I want to play I can tell him. And yesterday I was like "I'll play with you, if you want." and he's like "no." .....WHAT HTE HECK. he's done that like six times to me. And then I think about it now. he's only held me randomly like twice in our relationship. What's up with that? Even when we are alone which is only when I pick him up and drop him off we only kiss passionatly. Is it that bad for me to ask for him to hug me once in awhile without me doing something first/without asking?? hold me as if he didn't want to lose me. something? anything? Like a month ago. I kind of told him that I felt like he couldn't possibly have deep feelings for me if he never wants to hold my hand or hug me. and he said he'll try and get better at showing more compasion. has he? no. not at all. Yesterday I put my head on his shoulder for a split second and he told me NO. Am I just being selfish? or what? I'm always sitting there watching him play games like 5hours straight and what not. and then if I say something he'll tell me just to be quiet or shut up
20090307091652AALxjfJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm having feelings towards a friend, but I'm very shy and scared to tell her. What do you think?	That's right, another dating question. I'm 17 and in grade 12. For the longest time, I've struggled with feelings of insecurity and self-hatred. I isolated myself from people for a very long time. Last year, I decided to take a risk and I joined a club. I guess it's a good thing I did because I met this very nice and pretty girl. We have a lot of things in common. We pretty much like the same things and we have similar personalities, although she's much more social than I am. She was in grade 12 last year and came back for another semester this year. She's gone now though and I still try to keep in contact with her. She's going to university after the summer.      Something that kind of surprised me was when she opened up to me about problems she was having and has had in the past. It made me feel good that she was comfortable enough to tell me this, but it was hard for me to figure out why she was exactly. She hung out with a lot of her friends at lunch and I was there too. The nicest thing she said to me was that I was one of her close friends. I've even told her some things about myself and she has listened. She's pretty much everything I've ever wanted in a girl. She gives me hugs a lot and I give her some affection too. She told me I made this one guy jealous that had a crush on her because we were able to do this.      Basically, I think I'm in love with her. I have no idea what the future holds for us, but I want to try to get closer to her. I care so much about her and I want to do whatever it takes to make her happy. I'm going to wait a little bit until I'm comfortable, but I can't wait too long or else she'll slip away from me. I'm worried she may not return my feelings though. What do you think about this?

We are always arguing and we can't have one good day without a fight. I honestly don't feel like I love him and he probably feels the same way.

But he always come back, and I always want him back. We always feel completely in love again when we first get back together.      Anyway, what can we do to try and get along again? I want to give it a try before I end it for good.

However, they argue because each says the other must be the one to look after the baby!  Both have jobs.  However, her job as a teacher earns about ￡25,000 a year whereas he is a labourer on a building site and earns ￡15,000.  What do you think should happen?      Thanks

Ok, so the girl I like is in some club thing which is having a dance in a week and she still hasn't asked anyone yet.  I was just wondering if there's any way I could get her to ask me.        I just found out that last time they had this dance that she was going to ask me, but chickened out.  So, any ideas to get her to actually ask me this time?  And yeah, I can't ask her since I'm not in the club...

20090307100249AA7KqVh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So disappointing.....! is it just my though?	well, hear the story. I have almost one month to see my girlfriend, so I asked her to go out on the next saturday. I was really looking forward for that day, my confidence was so high that i managed to write 20 at all my tests at school. I was counting down day by day, continuously. I missed so much kissing her and hugging her, and i thought that this would make me better than just dreaming about it. I so missed her. So, the day came, all things were ok, but she didn't take her mothers permission. So, we couldnt go. I stayed home so that I can see her the next sat, but it is very disappointing, i feel very down. Well she wasnt allowed because she went on a party on the previous tuesday to escort her best friend, and at Sunday she went out again with her brother for the carnival, but I asked her not to bcz of our date. I feel shitty now, dont really know why. Is she selfish or I am the one who sees it so disappointing??

We never make it to dinner or to the movies and since he sometimes drives me to work, I have called in sick over 10 days in the last month. These sessions are never quick and go on for hours. Why does he like the car so much for such Intimate activity. (I bought it for him for St. Valentine's Day). Should I just be more assertive? I will never get anything else done and it is having a negative impact on my job.
20090307094446AAUlmLo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need some help figuring out this situation Im in with my boyfriend, he says he misses me but wont see me?	We are 22 and have been dating for over a year.      This week we made plans to see each other at 4pm on Tuesday when he called to cancel at 3pm saying he was going to the wellness center with a friend. I was upset and told him I didnt like that he cancelled on plans that we made.      Then on Thursday he wanted to stay the night, I said I dont think its a good idea because I needed to wake up early to do homework. But later I realized I didnt have that much work to do and asked if he could still come over. He said no because it was to late.      all week long he has sent me text messages saying i love you miss you cant wait to see you.      But then last night he decided to go out, and didnt tell me until I got a text message at 5 am saying "i want to come over" which I said no and freaked out on him.      This morning I told him i was sorry for freaking out last night but i was mad about this whole week, he said i had every right to be mad and that he wants to come over tonight at 11pm after a basketball game...      So what do you think should i let him come?    Im still mad...

20090307095156AA9dZ1v	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I deal with my sitsters's behavior? She is always so disrespectful it drives me nuts!!?	My sister is 17 and has had it rough growing up.  I'm 22 and I had it pretty bad too, but I handled it differently than she did. My sister, however, is rude ALL THE TIME and never follows our parents rules, so she's basically setting herself up to get in trouble a LOT.      I love my sister and know she's suffering and is stressed out 24/7, but I can't take her attitude and don't know how to handle it!  It's beyond the normal teenager attitude.       For instance, last night she comes in 1.5 hours late for her curfew, staying at some guy's house.  Our mom wakes up (I'm visiting home), finds out, and gets mad.      So what does my sister do?  She ARGUES with her!  And starts yelling about how she didn't do anything wrong!  That pisses Mom right off, who grounds her and tells her she's always hanging with deadbeat guys and my sister has to introduce her to the guy's parents, that she can't see him for a week, and all this stuff that makes my sister more mad.      The thing is, my sister walked right into it.  Even though she was late for curfew, if she'd just accepted that she was late and apologized, she would've been a lot better off.  But since she yelled and tried to say that she "didn't do anything wrong" and blah blah blah, she made it sooo much worse.  So she spends the night crying and rocking back and forth in the bathroom, freaking out.      This morning she drives like 20 miles out of town to a competition, misses it cuz she's late, doesn't get directions home, and gets lost.  She calls me to help her find her way, and gets MAD at me when she can't do what I ask (try and find a cross street, turn around, pull over, whatever) and raises her voice at me.  Then she finally hangs up on me.      But she has a program on her phone that can tell her exactly where she is and tell her step-by-step where to go!!! I was willing to walk her through using it, but she "DOESN'T WANT TO."  WTF??      I'm sick of her attitude and disrespect.  I don't know how to to get it to stop, because nothing we've tried is very effective against it.  If you call her out or try to discipline her like any other teen, she freaks out bigtime. If you don't discipline her, she keeps pushing the envelope more and more and is rude to you on top of it.      What can I do to make this easier to deal with?  She's living with me next fall when she starts college and I don't know how to set boundaries with her without her hating me and making life miserable.      Thank you!!!

20090307090854AAyT8ZD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I call him ........?	I had been dating this guy for the past 2 and a half months and decided to end it. During that time we got pretty close. My reasoning for ending it is that I wasn't sure that it was the right time for us to be having any kind of dating relationship. He told me from the beginning that he is going through a divorce and is trying to uphold his business. Both of which were putting him under a lot of stress and that he's not ready to be emotionally involved. I became concerned when we were sleeping in the same bed together almost every night and nothing physical was happening and I never felt like he wanted to be affectionate. The other problem is that while I was contemplating ending things I went out with another guy for dinner, nothing happened but I figured it would be a way for me to see what else is out there before I decided anything. I never told him about this but did mention the next day that I wanted to keep things open to see other people. During our breakup conversation I slipped and told him about the other guy. He was livid!! He said he is upset that I didn't tell him before I went out with the other guy but after. Since then we have been fighting and he doesn't want to even talk about it! I apologized to him in an email and he txted back saying he accepted it but to not bring it up again. I am really regretting that I did this. Now that a month has passed since this I feel like if I had never gone out with that guy and had been more patient things could have worked. I told him I made a mistake but he wont forgive me. He hasnt called or anything for the past 2 weeks.I left one last facebook message a few days ago apologizing but no response. I'm realizing he's not coming back and I really need to move even though I never wanted this to begin with. I really just feel like I screwed this up. I'm finding it hard to get motivated to move on again. What can I do to forget this and move on? I tried meeting a few new guys but its just not coming together for me.

20090307094502AALKGh5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do men always blame themselves?	when something happens to their wife? Not too long ago, I was attacked and raped when I was walking home. My husband was very furious because they never found out who did it.       And he was really caring and comforting. But he was hurt and blames himself. For letting me go alone, not being there, and not  being able to kill whoever did it.       But I always walk alone it's not his fault, and I know he can't be there all the time. And I know how mad he is at who did it,but there's nothing he can do.      Why is he being so hard on himself.

20090307095428AAUFPok	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ex boyfriend back with his ex girlfriend?	When i was seeing my ex boyfriend the girl he was with before me began calling him up and asking him to get back with her, saying she's changed and she realises how much she loves him now. Part of me thought it was just because she was sore that he had found someone new and was happy. I just found out that after dumping me 2 weeks ago my ex boyfriend is back with the girl he was with before me. She cheated on him 6 times in 8 months (that he knows of, maybe more?) and whilst he was with me he told me that he knows they would never have worked out. I don't want him back because of what he's done but it hurts all the same to know he wants to be with her. Do you think their relationship will work after all the cheating and lies or do you think the old problems will resurface? Thanks

20090307092737AA0J1hP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help this is urgent!?	I'm 16 and my ex is 17. We offically ended it.. but lately it seems I would want for us to work things out and he would too. But he would say he doesn't want what I want at the min which is seeing eachother more than friends. Basically it would be like me waiting for him, which is something I think nobody wants to do. I asked him to let me go and he said he could but he doesn't want to b/c he still can see things that can be worked out. The thing is that I've been hurt and cried so many times & I don't think I can handle being hurt again.. & that he says things that get my hopes up, but he never acts upon his words.. How can I move on from him & how can he stop?? Things have been like this for 3-4 months. I feel like I'm so lost and I try to make good decisions but it's like a constant circle and I want to break free.
20090307093312AAMpFiw	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend lies alot, does everybody?	Ok so I have this friend and we get along great and we have alot in common or so I thought. It turns out that he lies alot especially about stuff like what he likes, if he thinks I won't like it he pretends not to either even if he does, same for if he thinks I like it he'll pretend to like it even if he doesnt. He also pretends to not play world of warcraft (i asked him before if he played it he said not in years) but I found out (not through him) that he does in face play it and is still playing it. My question is is this common of people and should I cut him off for this? I really don't like fake people and it makes me wonder what else hes lying about too.

The relationship is long distance but it was been great. Now I am going to enter college in a few months and I want to get a masters degree or PHD. I told my boyfriend because I wanted to make him clear about what may happen. He wants to marry me and he wants to have kids. I told him were gonna have to wait a while because that will be too much responsibility for us. He told me I am being selfish and just thinking about myself and forgetting about his feelings. I spoke to him yesterday and he told me he didnt want to speak to me and I message him but he has not respond. He is such a great person and he tells me he wants to make a family with him but that hes gonna have to wait to long if i decide on being in college for so long for those degrees. I dont know what to do, should I just go for a shorter degree? By the way should I text him again, or wait? I think its my fault but it wasnt my intention to sound selfish to him I really love him. What should I do?                               Thanks so much guys!

20090307094438AAllD9a	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I have a chance or is she just being nice?	I got to know this girl for about a month now and we talk almost every day after class on our way to our dorms. We joke around a lot and talk about random things in our life.       When I first asked her out on a date she said yes at first but when I asked if she was sure she said that she "kind" of have someone and that it is "really weird" between them. When I asked her to clarify she wouldn't elaborate and just said her life was really complicated and she needs to think about it.      So I dropped it and and backed off a bit but we continue to talk everyday after class as if I haven't asked her out. For the last few days she seemed to be a bit different when we talk now. She would laugh a lot more when we talk and and give me really random details about her plans for the weekend and started telling me things about her family.      I'm just really confused if she likes me or not. She is really shy (so am I) and innocent so idk if her initial response was just her way of rejecting me. Should I ask her to clarify her feelings again or just keep talking to her and perhaps move on?

20090307100207AARM4ov	Family & Relationships;Family	My dad has a new girlfriend.?	My father got a new girlfriend      I never see him anymore. I feel like I don't know him.      He is always with her now, before they met my parents were still together and everything was going fine. We were so close and we shared the fatherly son bond. I call him all the time and he is either in work or with that whore.      Last week I rang him and I asked him if he wanted to do something, He told me he was in Portugal with Amy (gf). He didn't even tell me!!      I feel like I'm going to lose him, I have tests coming up and I just feel like ****, I really can't take this. I have told my friends but they don't understand, their fathers care about them, I have been to a counsellor, and I have explained this to my father, it goes in one hear and out the other.      Help me please. :(
20090307093321AA6Xs6r	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I in love? Please help it's a serious question!?	Every time I talk to my best girl friend my chest feels like its contracted or as if someone is sitting on my chest, at some points when she's with another guy talking this feeling gets even worse.  Not only that, but every time we talk, I lose track of time and we could be going on for hours and I just enjoy talking to her in general and she says she enjoys talking to me too.  She's told me so many personal things and she says she trusts me with everything, but I don't want to ruin this if I do love her. Please help me!            Does it make me a bad person to like my best friend even though she already has a boy friend?  I just can't help it, just talking to her makes my day, especially when she says "Where have you been Kev? I was trying to contact you for a while."  I really can't explain this feeling.  Is there any chance she would like me too?      Thanks to everyone that replies

20090307091738AAnGf84	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Bam..What should go down with this girl!?	At least one serious answer would be appreciated....      In 10th grade I had a crush on her for a while but I just didn't do anything like a *****. She might have even liked me but I was never for sure. (she sat at my lunch table but didn't really have any friends at the table) But this year I don't have any classes with her and only see her one time in the hallway. But every time we see each other we look right at each other. So last night I went out to Watchmen (killer movie!) with my friends and strange enough she is a good friend with my best friend, and she was there. After the movie we went to get some food. I have this thing with little balled up paper (don't ask why, I don't know) and I hate it. Like balled up straw wrappers bother me greatly. So she figured this out and started to doing it knowing it would bother me, and I didn't really mind that she was. Our eyes we constantly meeting and we talked for a bit not to much.      I would like to ask her on a date but I want a little recognition that she would say yes because it would be too awkward later on. Talking to my guy friend is out of the question cause that's too emotional or whatever....So you think there is a chance?

20090307091503AADlgsI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Advice please: is it my business?	I'm dating this really great guy right now. We're both in high school, and we had been friends long before we actually started dating, which was about a month ago.       Everything about him is great, except for one thing; he's a hard-core partier. While we're in school, he doesn't do anything, but when he goes back home, I know for a fact that he goes to wild parties and clubs, and he drinks and smokes pot.    He cheated on his last girlfriend "by accident" (he was drunk and high). I'd trust him with my life, but I also know that who people become when they're drunk/high are different from when they are sober.    I've also lost a lot of friends to drugs; for the most part, they started off with pot and then went on to do harder things. Two of my friends have died from overdose, and many of them are alive but aren't the same.       So I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm really against drugs, and I'm a little worried that he might cheat on me. But he only smokes pot once in a while, and he likes me so much that he practically calls me as soon as he wakes up in the morning.   Am I worrying too much about nothing?    Should I tell him how I feel about his partying, or keep my mouth shut and let his business be his business?       Advice appreciated. :)

Yesterday(Friday), his friends told him that I like him but he did not believe them, I thought he knew until my best mate asked him if he knew on msn last night and he said no. So she told him.

20090307092211AAkSPqI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE HELP OR I WILL DIE OUT OF CONFUSION........ Is it love?	During the most awful days of my life, when i was passing through a state of mental depression due to some personal problems, I happened to meet a boy in my school. I am the topper of my school and he is also my competitor.   However, He is a master of religious topics and really his knowledge and sweet friendship took me away from my all troubles. His decency and sweetness is really admirable. I was always considered to be the most beautiful but quiet,pessimistic and sad girl of my institute. But after meeting him,  I really changed surprisingly. Now i am very happy, easy going, positive thinker with a charm and glow at my face all the day round. He is truly the one whom I can trust with closed eyes    He is a person without whom I can't imagine my life. He himself says that even he never used to talk girls earlier, an I am his first friend amongst girls in his life till now. We both miss each other when separated, and nowadays blush when see each other. I know that he likes me, but i still don't know whether I love him or not??? He is not of my religion and I know that we can never be together.    This is true that i have never felt like this for anyone else, and I just want to be close to him. There are several girls in my class who like him, but strangely, I feel angry when ,by mistake even, he happens to pass from the side of any of them. I miss him when he is away, and feel angry when he talks about any girl except me!!!   BUT STILL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I LOVE HIM OR NOT???

20090307092707AA9dzfg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he likes me? URGENT! i need to know by tomorrow?	i've known this guy since 7th grade (we're 9th graders) but i never actually really talked to him until the last week of january. We were at auditions for our school musical and there were 5 freshman including me and the audition took 6 hours. we talked for probably 5 hours and it was really fun. and he chose me as his partener for this lift thing. but so did alot of other guys bc they're my friends and im tiny and easy to lift.       so we started to talk after that and we'd be walking in the halls and i would realize its just the 2 of us. and he would always hug me before one of us has to go. and i sit next to him in health and the first thing he does when i sit down is ask me how i am and start a random conversation. last week we had an open book test and we could do it in groups of 3 or partners. so i usually work with one of my best friends and he knows that because she's been my partner for everything all year/ but this time he asked me if i wanted to work together. and i know his friends and him are cool with each other. so we work together and i had a lot of fun and my friend ended up working with us bc i felt bad.. i didnt mean to ditch her like that bc theres not a lot of our friends in our class. and then we walked all the way to class together until we had to  go own ways bc we dont have that class together      an in algebra an hour later he says "hey you" and hugs me and he always says my name if i pass by or if the teacher calls on me. and i catch him looking at me and im sure bc i sit all the way in the back and theres nothing there except a window and 3 other ppl. most of which are guys. so he cant be looking at the clock and theres a window in the front area too.       so i think i may like him but im not sure how i really feel yet. but he is a gentleman and all but i dont see him hugging other girls and stuff as much as he hugs me. but some of my friends said he had a girlfriend. but i heard they broke up. so do you think he likes me?       p.s. he was really happy when he found out we have musical theatre and chorus together and said he was glad that im in his class next year
20090307093027AAm0i9c	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really need some help. Please answer me?	This ones really confusing, so bear with me. I'll try my best to explain the best that I can.      Okay so, when I first entered high school, a guy (let's call him cody) that I had talked to maybe once before, started talking to me everyday. He was so sweet, and after a little while, I fell head-over-heels for him.   I'm one of those girls who doesn't date people unless I'm very sure of them and I know I can trust them. And cody, well he seemed to be perfect. Not only was he extremely gorgeous, he was also nice, understanding, and well-liked by pretty much everyone. We started to hang out, and I got to know him alot better.   A few weeks after, he heard something about me and another guy (which was my best friend.. we hang out all the time and do NOT see eachother that way) and cody got angry at me. For the record, we were not dating at this time. I tried to explain but he wouldn't listen. He didnt treat me the same, and I thought he didnt like me anymore. Apparently that wasn't true, because a week later he asked me out. I said no, because I didn't like the fact that he didn't trust me or my best friend. Cody didn't talk to me until my birthday 8 months later. We talked like nothing happened, and I found myself liking him again. Since my birthday which was a while ago, I havent stopped liking him because I know how he can be. The trouble is, he's moved on and has these weird mood swings where he won't talk to me at all for a little while. Now, I like him SO MUCH, but he doesnt see that. I apologized to him several times for rejecting him.. and I can see how he would be upset. But he can be such a sweetheart and I want to be with him again.. even after dating two people since me and him were 'seeing eachother'. what should i do to get him talking to me again? how do i tell him? is it worth it? Im so scared to talk to him at school. Please help me out, be honest. thanks so much :)

20090307093100AAp2j8o	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I pay for her?	Well I suggested to do something with this girl I haven't talked to for a while. She said how about lunch and I said sure, I told her I'd pick her up for the lunch date around 1. I meant lunch date as a generic term for a meeting over lunch but I don't know if she expects something more since I said lunch date. Should I pay for her even though we aren't dating or really going on a "date" per se? She had a small crush on me in the past and I don't know how she views this.       The place I'm going to is an old classic restaurant which has been around forever. It's not fancy or elegant in anyway, it just has a nice 40's feeling to it with great food. A blast to the past type of dinner shack. The entree's aren't too much either, only 5-6$ each.

But i got a little suspicious so every time i go to my dad's house i check the history. It's about the 15th time i have caught it on the history. I caught it the other day. He is on sick levee and I was over his house. I found more and deleted it. Then i clicked on Google 5 minutes ago and saw he looked up "****", "****" and really other disgusting stuff. I found stuff like this on his laptop before and figured that somebody else used it. But now that I am older, I understand. He is happily re-married ( i hope ) and it worries me that he could be cheating on my step-mom. Should i tell my step-mom  or keep it to myself? HELP!

And second (and most important) he is like a very big flirt.. I know hes not popular but he does have a lot of friends from other schools and stuff and like a lot of them are girls. And I would just be afraid that he would continue flirting while he was with me, because he did with his ex. We dont really talk a lot because I dont want to pursue anything while I'm so unsure about everything. And for a little back up, we kiiiinda dated for a while back in like grade 9.. Only for a short while and then I ended it. We're both in grade 11 now and in a few of the same classes. So any advice or anything on what I should do would be very much appreciated! Thanks!

20090307093848AA7UGCe	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can my ex use emails, texts and taped conversations in a child support hearing?	I have filed child support papers 11/08 and am still waiting for his employer to respond (he's LAPD police officer).  I used to allow him to get her anytime but then he never asked. His family always asks, but never him. So to be fair, at least to his family and maybe so he wouldn't take it for granted, I allowed him Fridays and every other weekend to have our daughter, which he cares for until something better comes along and then has his family members cares for her (he lives at his parents again). He buys her things at RANDOM times and I'm stuck with the joint bills at home, and he just bought a BMW 5 series, knowing about a pending child support order, quite an upgrade for him.  He has never picked her up or dropped her off, even when it is his turn to see her.  She has Gymborree class and I have I take her, even when he has her, which means picking her up, taking her there, and dropping her back.  She's 6months and has given me $400 total and most of that I used on joint bills of ours....As you can see he pisses me off and i mistakenly get angry at him.  I think he has taped our conversations and saved emails and texts and may use against me in court.  Can he do that? How much weight will that add?  I  have my own logs of our arguments, times he's seen her, not seen her, and receipts of my expenses, as well as my emails asking him to help.  Can I use that?

20090307094441AAD4mTH	Family & Relationships;Family	I saw my brother masturbate but he doesn't know, what should i do?	The other night when i was in bed my brother came in my room to use my computer, i was curious as to what he was doing so i pretended to be sleeping. He started off by just playing a game but then after 10 mins he started to watch naughty videos. I found it funny and thought to myself *haha you are so busted*. But then he got his thing out and started to masturbate, i was really shocked and couldn't believe what i was seeing, it was the first time i had seen a penis in real life and i couldn't take my eyes off what he was doing, after the initial shock went i started to become kinda hot and enjoyed watching. Does any one have any ideas on what i should do? I don't mind that he done it as i kinda liked seeing it, but i'm not sure if i should tell him i saw etc   oh btw i'm 19 and he's 22
20090307094603AAVCNnU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Shall I divorce or not? Why I am not able to take a decision? Please help me.?	I am not sure if this happens to everyone, but I am not able to reach a point where I can decide something for my marriage. A sincere request, people who are around 30 or more years old, I need help from you guys.       I am 31 and I came from India, 7 years back. Working here in US. Not sure about where to settle down, but chances r there that I might live here for ever as I spent sometime here not and got used to it.      I was married 2 years back to my husband. Before that I was in a relationship where my ex bf cheated on me and it was a devastating experience.I started drinking, depressed etc. And then my family jumped on, saying what now!?! Now they he has left me, I should marry someone else, that too as soon as possible. I have my siblings lined for their marriage as I am the eldest one. So I should get married first. Also, my husband, he never met me before and he was also behind me in a way to get married. Our relationship was always sour as I found him intriguing in my 'current relationship' that time. Then with all this mesh, family pressure, with no choice (as I was told), I got married to him. But the problem I don't love him. i am not attracted to him at all. We don't even stay together. He expects me to be like people who are in love. With him, I have absolutely no feelings, I can't even talk to him properly. Always tension is there in the environment when we talk. He knows that I don't like him. Why is he not leaving me? That is something I don't understand either. I have a job, no children. I have thinking shall I divorce him or shall I try to work on it? But please note that we can't even talk as friends, I don't love him, am not attracted to him. If I divorce including his and my parents, all will be disappointed. It also scares me that if I will be left alone all my life.    It's such a big story, please help me what should I do now? Thanks so much.

So, the other day I was hanging out with the girl I like who had been flirting with me a lot the week before.  She wasn't talking much and then after a little bit of talking she laughed at me for something and I jokingly called her a jerk.  Then she said that I was the jerk and named all these things I've said/done to her.        I didn't realise it before, but everytime I teeze someone I sound like a jerk.  Now it turns out that almost everyone hate's me because they think I'm a jerk, which I was never trying to be.  I thought I was just joking around with them.      Now, since it seems like the girl I like doesn't like me any more, I'm dying to appologyse to her, but I won't see her for another few days.        In the mean time I have nothing to do at all and this is all I'm thinking about.  How big of a jerk I am and how no one likes me.  This sucks, I hate it.  What should I do?

20090307100829AAaIQOG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	REALLY NEED HELP! please?	This ones really confusing, so bear with me. I'll try my best to explain the best that I can. Okay so, when I first entered high school, a guy (let's call him cody) that I had talked to maybe once before, started talking to me everyday. He was so sweet, and after a little while, I fell head-over-heels for him.   I'm one of those girls who doesn't date people unless I'm very sure of them and I know I can trust them. And cody, well he seemed to be perfect. Not only was he extremely gorgeous, he was also nice, understanding, and well-liked by pretty much everyone. We started to hang out, and I got to know him alot better.   A few weeks after, he heard something about me and another guy (which was my best friend.. we hang out all the time and do NOT see eachother that way) and cody got angry at me. For the record, we were not dating at this time. I tried to explain but he wouldn't listen. He didnt treat me the same, and I thought he didnt like me anymore. Apparently that wasn't true, because a week later he asked me out. I said no, because I didn't like the fact that he didn't trust me or my best friend. Cody didn't talk to me until my birthday 8 months later. We talked like nothing happened, and I found myself liking him again. Since my birthday which was a while ago, I havent stopped liking him because I know how he can be. The trouble is, he's moved on and has these weird mood swings where he won't talk to me at all for a little while. Now, I like him SO MUCH, but he doesnt see that. I apologized to him several times for rejecting him.. and I can see how he would be upset. But he can be such a sweetheart and I want to be with him again.. even after dating two people since me and him were 'seeing eachother'. what should i do to get him talking to me again? how do i tell him? is it worth it? Im so scared to talk to him at school. Please help me out, be honest. thanks so much :)
