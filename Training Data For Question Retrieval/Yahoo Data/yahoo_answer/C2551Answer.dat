f5ibT3WNaa	It could be just as easy as the tank failed, or the other that the head gasket is blown and putting to much pressure into the radiator.
6xyeYjkkaa	It depends on the car and what all they find once they're in there. If it's only a bad gasket then it could be very reasonable. However, until you take it apart and inspect and measure you don't know if it's just a bad gasket or possibly a cracked head or block or a warped head. Anything other than the gasket itself could get very expensive. That's why I usually advise against buying a car that the seller says "just needs a new head gasket". Too iffy. IF the head is warped could cost you for a resurfacing or a new head. IF the head is cracked will probably need a new head. IF the block is warped it could need resurfacing or replacing. IF the block is cracked you're likely going to need a new engine.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Give us a clue - make, model, year and engine size?|`|f5ibT3WNaa	it all depends on the motor and car. but it can run from a few hundred up and into the thousands|`|mTwn8p79aa	Average would be a little over a grand.

b2444f35a7f9696e20acbb1687b47466aa	First look at some of the web sites at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=replacing+brake+pads" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=rep...</a><br>  <br>  Then go to one of your local auto parts stores (Auto-Zone, NAPA, CarQuest, etc.) and get a "repair manual" for your make and model, (not a "car manual" like the one that came with the car).  <br>  While you are at the auto store ask them about the prices of different brands of pads, and what they recommend as far as how to replace them - advice is FREE. <br>  They can also tell you if that particular store can "Turn" (smooth down by grinding machine) the brake rotors, and if they can't they can recomend a place to get it done.  <br>  <br>  It has been my experience that the "caliper piston" may start leaking after a brake pad replacement.  This is because you have to squeeze the piston back into it's housing in order to make enough space for the new thicker pads to fit back onto the rotor, which forces the dirt and rust into the rubber seal.  Be careful with this step and clean it as good as you can. <br>  <br>  Good Luck - It's really not that hard.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/ownership/howto/articles/43787/article.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.edmunds.com/ownership/howto/a...</a><br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  P.S.  Don't let the caliper hang by the brake hose. Get a bucket (turned up side down), or other support device to rest it on, so it doesn't put the all the weight on the hose.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	they are simple to change if you got the know how. if your brakes are still working good and no shaking then you do,nt have to get the rotors done. you need a ratchet, an extention and either a allen head bit or a star bit to take the bolts out. you will need a c-clamp to push the piston back in and you will see 2 sleeves where the bolts goes through, you will need to tap them back so the caliper will fit back down over the rotor. make sure the slides where the caliper slides on that they are clean from rust and swipe a little grease, not too much on the slides. i could show you if i were there better then tell you. if your not really sure then you better not tackle tat job. brakes are 1 of the most important safety features on the car.|`|Qf6hKrAuaa	it shouldn't be too difficult if you know what you're doing, you have st of the tools that you will need and yes the manual will make it easier. You wouldn't have to take them to get checked but its better if you did.|`|ooTfG1e9aa	Brake jobs are fairly simple in nature, but with the newer vehicles, there are some things you will need to keep in mind.<br>  <br>  I would recommend a repair manual for your specific car, if you plan on performing maintenance activities. They usually contain illustrations and can sometimes give you tips on some of the :tricks of the trade"<br>  <br>  That being said, some things you will want to keep in mind. When pressing the caliper pistons back into the caliper, open the bleeder valve and allow the fluid to drain out as opposed to forcing it back into the master cylinder. This will help prevent an ABS problem. You will need to bleed the brakes when you are finished and this will flush the calipers of any sediment and debris. Apply an anti-squeal compound to the back of the brake pads before installing them to eliminate the brake "squeal" noise.<br>  <br>  When buying pads, spend the extra money on QUALITY parts. they will last longer, perform better, Remove the rotors and have them machined (if they are still thick enough). If they are too thin, replace them. The pads and rotors will overheat and braking can fade if you do not service the rotors. They can also warp under such heat. <br>  <br>  Always pump the brakes before test driving following brake repairs. The calipers must be pumped out to contact the pads/rotor or the pedal will go to the floor (good way to get your juices flowing if you forget).
VdJRuTIRaa	it sounds like your down to metal on metal in the brake department, you will find that its usually the front left disc brake as for some reason that is the side that comes on first and if its making that noise you may need to machine the rotor or replace it, real quick when your changing the brake pads.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	sounds like your brakes are down to the metal.|`|ND1nFEWSaa	front or rear brakes need replacing

My opinions.|`|YJVmL9Ubaa	since the economy is so bad and credit for a new car is harder to get people are having to buy more used cars,i would start out at $3,500.00,but take no less than $2,000.00,anything that cranks and gets you to point a to point b is worth at least 2,blue book value doesn't reflect this current economy.|`|AEHk87hmaa	$2,000
M79W3Ct9aa	Eh, I wouldn't say that.  First, they are intended to handle well on the dirt trails in the Colorado and Utah mountains while giving a great ride, comparable to SUVs.  Also, these trails can still be driven on with ANY vehicle so don't think these are rock crawlers or anything of the like.  <br> <br> The STi and Evolution are considered premium sports cars and are initially designed that way from the factory so, when in stock form, they are actually pretty crappy on the dirt trails compared to the regular AWD Subarus.  In fact, road tests from magazines have shown that the REGULAR WRX is better on the trail than the stock STi.  Of course, swap out the stock parts and turn it into a C Class Rally Car or something, roll cage and all, and it is more than capable of rallying on the dirt trails.|`|JGPuOE6Naa	<a href="http://yourinfo.daymy.com" rel="nofollow">http://yourinfo.daymy.com</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website

I have had different Vauxhalls. With the Carlton and a 52 plate astra had some parts replaced by my garage but some faults remained and the cause for the continuing faults were that my garage trying to save me money replaced parts with non vauxhall parts and the cars did not like them! so sometimes you need the authentic vauxhall part not a similar cheaper one.|`|ROIEoZh1aa	Crikey you seem to have an awful lot of problems on a 51 plate .Does this thing have an M.O.T.? If you've just purchased this car check to see if the mot is legit.|`|cgjbw1jKaa	Firstly i would guess its a fuse problem with the dashlights etc.You can find the fuse panel below and right of the steering wheel.Pop it open and there are pictures and numbers which tell you what the fuses are for.You may need to pop each one out if your not sure which one it is and check to see if the metal fillament has melted.It will be obvious if it has.Oh and they need to be the right colour so replace like for like ie. if its a red fuse then replace it with a red fuse(you can buy them at halfords or similar motor shop).<br>  Secondly it sounds like there is a problem with the brake shoes and or the drums you need to get that sorted or don`t park on hills (lol?)coz it won`t go through the mot like that.Fitting them yourself would save money but its a pain and you may discover the drums are shot.Let a garage/mechanic that is recommended to you by friends or family do it so you don`t get ripped of!<br>  Finally the jump to the left sounds odd.Tell the afore mentioned garage/mechanic about it while he/she is doing the brakes :)|`|OIbHnOcmaa	<a href="http://www.vectra-sport.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vectra-sport.com/</a><br>  <br>  join this mate i'm sure if you type up these faults they guys on hear other vectra owners will help you better than me, sounds like a possible wiring problem, handbrake may need tightening or as you say new shoes as for the suspension could need  new bushes or spring but unsure <br>  <br>  hope this makes some sense<br>  <br>  forgot to add i the dials are dim but not showing lit up to well prob is just new bulbs beams tanking out the dials but not to hard had same prob on 3.0 carlton with the digital dash!|`|wxeKRQCyaa	Almost definitely a fuse gone (or missing) for the dashboard fault. Get a circuit tester and check every fuse or remove each one in turn and check it visually. Get a spare fuse and insert it in all spare slots that have two electrical terminals. Put the sidelights on and watch the dash everytime you put the fuse into a new slot. You'd be amazed at the amount of people that have brought cars into us where they've actually removed fuses themselves previously!!!!<br>  <br>  The handbrake fault isn't a quick fix on a Vectra B with rear discs. You'll need to drop the calipers off, remove the discs and check the shoes inside. If they aren't worn out, you can clean them (use water or brake clean), rough them up with 80 grit paper as well as the internal surface of the discs and finally refit the discs. They must then be adjusted correctly with a screwdriver through a hole in the disc. If you aren't sure about tackling this yourself, take it to a garage! The handbrakes on these will lock the wheel at the slightest touch when working correctly!<br>  <br>  As far as the handling issue, they suffer with wear in the upper and lower hub bushes and trailing arm bushes but the fault maybe as simple as a shock absorber worn out. Get it checked at a garage if unsure. Hub bushes are easy to change but wouldn't really give you those symptoms. Trailing arm bushes are quite hard to change.|`|p5IjD7tnaa	Hello<br>  <br>  Does the Radio still work?<br>  If not check fuse 22   20 Amp Yellow<br>  2nd row up 2nd fuse from right ( 1st will be empty )<br>  <br>  Does the Electric Door Mirrors/Sun Roof/Windows still work?<br>  If none of them check fuse 29   10 Amp Red<br>  Bottom row 13th fuse from the right ( Centre of a bank of 3 ) <br>  <br>  Does the Brake/Reverse Lamps still work?<br>  If Neither of them then check fuse 38   10 Amp Red<br>  Bottom row 4th fuse from right ( 3rd will b empty )<br>  <br>  Other than that you are down to bulbs.<br>  <br>  Andy C|`|vgBK9F0eaa	Blimey...

VdJRuTIRaa	why don't you just buy a rear set of pads? they are cheap .<br>  After a while you will wear do a huge groove in the rotor and then you will need a new one and they are expensive.<br>  but if you really want to lube it then grab yourself some HTB grease that's high temperature bearing grease you will need to apply it every 15 mins of driving as the centrifugal motion will throw any lube off it .|`|zOIgzIy4aa	there is none. once the pads gets down to the metal then the damage is already done. all you can do is change the pads and rotors and maybe the caliper if it,s so bad that it,s wearing the pads into the rotor but there is nothing you can put on them to quieten them. you better get them fixed or you will be paying out more then just pads and rotors like (may god forbid) maybe hit a innocent person and either lay them up in the hospital of worse yet, kill them. when it comes to my safety i,am very funny about that stuff.|`|HQrMEkm0aa	There's none good lubricant.

r1D9P4Vyaa	You stated it does not leak any more, good, But some times the coolant system does not just fill all the way with no air in the system. This is what I call "burping" the system. When you are driving the car, the thermostat opens and will let the trapped air come to the top, then when you shut the car off, and it cools it will use the coolant from the over flow tank. This should have to be done only a few times though, not always. Still I would have him re-check the items that were replaced and removed to do the water pump for leaks, loose Etc. We all are human. As far as the coolant, always use a 50-50 mix for the best engine cooling all year round. some people think that straight coolant cools better, this is Not the case. I hope this will help to answer your question, Good Luck.  :-)<br>  Ps I forgot to say have him to check for leaks when the engine is up to normal running temp.|`|n9AvvZLjaa	i would have to agree with g-man although the are known for intake leaks as well internally as well as externally
AA10331789	Your engine has been plaqued with bad intake manifold gaskets and plastic manifold failures. Don't get a radiator from a junkyard because once they dry out they often can't be put back in service. Brand new radiators aren't that expensive and then you'll know for sure the new radiator isn't causing the overheating. If you put in a junkyard radiator, you'll never be sure it's good or not!<br>  <br>  You most likely have this plastic intake manifold described below. It's covered up by the top plastic cover. Remove that cover to check for leaks etc., but the problem may be hidden as in small cracks and bad gaskets etc.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bernardsblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/gm-38l-plastic-composite-intake.html" rel="nofollow">http://bernardsblog.blogspot.com/2008/12...</a>|`|Y5pgqBcAaa	I hope this might help.Check to see exactly what kind of coolant your supposed to have in your cooling system.My wife has a 1999 grand prix,and her car started to overheat on a nice day.come to find out,the car had the wrong kind of coolant in it.After having the mechanic check things out,this was the problem.Since then,her car no longer overheats.|`|E2NxDyOKaa	Sounds more like the thermostat is not working right.

fl60KL8oaa	Brings back old memories....   450cc twin in a frame that normally held a 250.  Would run with the 750s.  I had a new GS450E, added a Vetter Quicksilver fairing.  Sweet little street bike.  Ran it up I-5 from L.A. to north of San Francisco at 80-85 mph.  Very buzzy.

AA10721549	it's just a movie..<br>  <br>  find some real life missile launches, preferably AGM 65 Maverick /any version/ on youtube... the missile drops of the hardpoint and flies away , no rolling.<br>  <br>  Some missiles do fly quite a strange patterns, though - such as the BVR long range missiles - russian R27, US Phoenix.<br>  These are to fly a long way, part of it unpowwered, so they basically climb after the launch to gain altitude -even if the target is flyling the same altitude like the interceptor.<br>  <br>  If you are talking about the plane rolling away, this could be done with the fire-and-forget missiles, YET such a maneuver implies you are showing your *** to the enemy which is not the best thing to do in combat. Better to fly to him and engage from a pass. You never know whether or not does your missile score.<br>  <br>  <br>  The ONLY valid reason to maneuver after the missile launch is to ESCAPE from Area of engagement of the SAM sites. If you are attacking a SAM site or a SAM defended site, you would launch/drop your ammo and maneuver to leave the dangerous area as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  Missile evasive maneuvers are something another - in case of suspition your opponent launched as well, it is wise to take the countermeasures, including maneuver where applicable.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit> instead of a roll, if I should maneuver after the launch, i'd climb to gain altitude while the oponent maneuvers to avoid the missile - to have another attack position.|`|z3BxHrMpaa	They would not do this to fire an air to air missile.   A fighter may roll inverted before initiating a steep dive, that may be what you are thinking off.<br>      If a pilot starts a dive from straight and level flight by slamming the stick forward the plane will generate negative G forces. Enough negative G's produce a "red out" as blood rushes into the head and eyes.  It is harder to counteract negative G's than positive G's, and the airframe, and in particular the under-wing stores and mounts, are designed to accept more positive G's than negative.<br>      Correctly done, a roll is a 1 g maneuver, producing no additional stress on the plane. So a fully loaded  fighter under goes less stress by rolling inverted, then pulling positive G's to enter the dive. Once the downward angle is established the roll is continued until right side up again.    <br>         As an FYI, if you roll inverted and do a half  inside loop it's called a Split S.|`|o3Z0Xrjsaa	No fighter rolls over to fire its missile. The missile needs at least 10 feet of free fall to engage it's motor. Fighters do tend to turn away after firing for what reason I can't be for sure but I would presume to track another target or to fly away from the area. <br>  <br>  only the movies have planes roll over to dramatize the action seen. Other than that it is impractical to do.|`|b75427b8123ccfcf5f8c87fc21a99672aa	Hollywood likes to dramatize stuff. A missile is best launched flying straight and level preferably pointing towards the target. Any undesirable accelerations will adversely (negligible maybe) affect the missiles range and probability of kill.|`|zlPAVkUBaa	They don't, except in movies and maybe under special circumstances. The missile really needs to fall away from its pylon. Being upside down doesn't help.|`|LhU26YqJaa	I think the roll i for the pilot to get a better view of the kill and to keep the plane away from any bit of the explosion that may harm the attacking plane|`|TdrgZwnoaa	They don't normally roll away while firing. They do after the missile is 'away' though.<br>  <br>   With modern missile system there is no need to be pointed at the enemy after firing. The pilot may roll away to clear the exhaust plume of the missile or to seek another target. Also a good idea to roll away in case the enemy has also fired a missile. If you are in the engagement zone and you have expended all your missiles there really is no point in hanging around to see what happens next, is there? You roll away and head home to rearm your aircraft. Loitering in an engagement zone with no defences would be a trifle unprofessional and hazardous to your health.

Ee8w6NY4aa	If you go to www.bahn.de , then you can type in your connections and it'll show you all possibilities including prices and duration.<br>  <br>  For example, travel time by train would take 4-5 hours, change trains between 1-4 times, and it would cost you 29 Euro if you buy in advance (normal cost would be 56-86 Euro). That is for a one-way ticket.<br>  <br>  If you go to www.heidelberg.de , you'll find all the bus connections and various discount tickets explained (the City-Tarif would be great, it costs 1 Euro for the area from the Bahnhof/ train station to the Altstadt/ downtown). Usually, getting a 1-day pass or paying on the bus depends on how much traveling you'll need to do. If it's just for a few hours, pay at the bus station (automated machines are easy) before you board the bus. Or you can always ask at the tourist information stand outside the Bahnhof, should you not feel completely secure and they'll help you out.

Sobering thought.<br>  <br>  As a zoologist, I think that this is partly due to an effect called "hunting image" where a predator or foraging animal develops an ability to spot its prey, even when the prey or food is camouflaged or well hidden. Car drivers develop a hunting image for cars, which they encounter frequently, but not two-wheeled vehicles, which are too narrow to register.<br>  <br>  I'm afraid that the only safe course of action for the motorcyclist, apart from making themselves as visible as possible, is to drive as if no one can see them and to always assume that other vehicles may do the wrong thing.

Many times I just put a manual gauge in because if you have no oil, you have no truck. 1. Clean the battery terminals, and post on the battery, and make sure they are tight when you put them back on, especially the ground. 2. I would check your brake booster vacuum, the big hose right against the firewall there. It's probably a vacuum leak. Try to plug up the hose where you pull it off the connection to test if it doesn't run better. If you're going to try to drive it that way, be careful because now you have manual brakes, where you have to physically push the hydraulic through the brake lines with your feet, don't tap them too hard that way!

nAK8bm91aa	With some experience and skill you can do this "properly". You need to take the front wheels off and chock the wheels to keep it from rolling when jacked.<br>  Take the wheels off. Clean the entire brakes with brake cleaner before starting this project. Do what we call bath the brakes with the fluid.Remove all particles, you do not want to breathe any of this into your respiratory system. You need a socket, If I remember, a hex socket or it will be a star socket, you need the right size to remove this from the wheel hub on the back of the caliper. You will need to also have the rotors cut. Take the pads off by pulling away from you. The other comes right out held on by a clip. installation is opposite removal, then you are required to bleed the brake calipers, by having another person depress the brake when told to, when you open the bleeder valve and let go after you close it and this has to be done several times to get all the muck and air out. If you did not do this properly, your brake pedal will go to the floor, and you will crash your vehicle. Maybe injuring yourself and or others, and be responsible for everyone involved, medically, also any property damage.

OblSdMaaaa	Inspections and maintenance are conducted by certified aircraft mechanics.  Most major airlines have their own maintenance divisions, and those that do not contract their aircraft maintenance out to other airlines, or companies that specialize in aircraft maintenance.  <br>  <br>  The pilot (or first officer) also does a quick inspection of the aircraft prior to flight (just a walkaround to look for any obvious problems).|`|WrXY4Wm9aa	In addition to the above, the aircraft must be maintained in accordance with a program approved and monitored by the FAA.|`|JeUvm9NIaa	Most commerical airline operators have a progressive maintence program, where as inspections/ replacements of parts are done on time or cylce intervels regarldless if the part is worn. This provides the best maintene and most cost effective as it does not pull the aircraft out of service for very long man hour intensive inspections.

The idea is like this: Say you are driving 55 or 60 in 5th gear, chugging along around 2000 to maybe close to 3000  rpm, now you want to pass someone with a quickness, well, if you just punched it in 5th gear(the gear you currently are chugging along in right now) it would accelerate fairly slowly(especially a 4 cyl), so you quickly shift down to fourth and punch it. This brings your rpms up very quickly, then you can hit 5th gear when you get in the good "rev" (rpm) spot and this will get your speed up for passing quickly.  You must "know what you're doing" somewhat or you can possibly over rev your engine, or grind your gears trying to do it too quickly.|`|7f0c0084c06d4c9f3a8b466ac507eb15aa	The trick is to reach the optimum RPM at which bhp is highest. <br>  If you are travelling in 5th gear at a steady speed the rpm will be at the lower end at higher gear, by treading on accelerator it would take some time to increase the rpm , instead you can move to 4th or 3rd gear for sudden increase in rpm which is called downshifting and then accelerating , the car will move forward like a bullet , once the movement is gained go back to 5th gear otherwise you will not reach higher speed. In case of cars with turbo at cruising speeds in 5th gear probably the turbo is not working , while you down shift the turbo will rub and the car will produce additional power.

When the defrost or defrost and foot switch position is selected, the a/c runs even if the a/c button is off. The compressor and radiator fan may be cycling on and off because of a small leak in the a/c system and the low pressure switch is sensing low fluctuating 134a pressure. A common leak area is in the condenser which is in front of the radiator.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	the sensor could be bad.|`|AA10331789	The fan temperature sensor is a relatively inexpensive part to have changed.

Rwn0svq0aa	The 2007 Jeep SRT8 is a street legal race car. It is the truth.  I believe Jeep is second to none, and it has a track record to reinforce my belief starting with the Jeep Willy all the way to the Jeep SRT8.  The Jeep brand is one of the products that American manufacturing has done well. You would not be making a mistake in the purchase of such a venerable performance machine. Let me put it to you this way.  People from all walks of life own a Jeep for life. The service life of Jeep is legendary.  It has a cult following like Harley Motorcycles because it is a product that is viewed as the genuine article, warts and all. If you decide to purchase a Jeep it is synonymous to the word reliable.  <br>  To answer your question, in the American story it was Jeep that carried Patton to defeat Hitler's Rommel in WWII.  Jeep is a beloved iconic symbol of rugged determinism against all odds. The American Jeep began service in the military in the 1940's under the Willy banner, AMC eventually assumed manufacturing of the Jeep brand, then Chrysler. For a period of 40 years, in the early 80's the Jeep Willy was phased out for the Hummer. Should you purchase a Jeep SRT8 it is the great great grandson of Jeep Willy. I would say, the SRT8 has nothing to be ashamed of. Cheers.|`|5ITR6x6gaa	Im a Newzealander living in Australia and i have lived in CA for ten years,but i can tell you with experiance that american cars are the best, and i even drive a toyoto currently my last car was a honda ,american cars are better because theyare more solid, softer ride which i like,more comfortable interriors especially if it has leather, i remember i had a cadillac deville  nothing could match that for comfort.then a buick park avenue ultra, if i was back in US now i would buy a chevy or similiar, not a look alike import.|`|M79W3Ct9aa	a lot of them (not all) are built to last long.

AA10498232	First of all I would find a new shop if they don't have a wheel balancer they don't have much.<br>  <br>  Personally I have my balance and alignment checked every year!<br>  <br>  If you wait until you feel a vibration or pull you have already taken some life off your tires.<br>  <br>  You have also affected the ride or developed a tire noise! <br>  <br>  Why wait for symtoms?|`|zOIgzIy4aa	there is a lot of difference. balancing a tire means they use weights on the tires and alignment is when the set the toe end, camber and caster. as long as you did,nt hit nothing like a curb it still should be line. you don,t need to have it aligned if your just having the tires rotated.|`|AA10331789	In my opinion, you don't automatically need to balance tires and have the vehicle wheels aligned unless you have symptoms of a balance or alignment problem. You may never have to have your vehicle aligned and you may only have to have your tires balanced when you get new tires. Note that your car's owner's manual does not instruct you to get your car aligned and your tires balanced as a normal maintenance item, although you should check your tires for abnormal wear and have your wheel alignment CHECKED if your steering is pulling noticeably left or right on the highway (good tires assumed). Of course you may need an alignment if you have certain repairs done to the steering or suspension or your vehicle is involved in an accident, including hitting obstructions like pot holes or curbs etc.|`|yU7urgLxaa	There's no relationship between balance and alignment except both will cause wear of your tires. Unbalanced tires over time will cause a vibration. Front end alignment will cause a steering problem. If you are driving on a straight level street and turn loose of the wheel your car or truck should continue on a straight course. If not the front end should be aligned. In extreme cases you will need to hold pressure on the steering wheel in the same direction at all times.|`|OcSVkKsEaa	if the tires are wearing bad then alignment done.like the inside or out side of the tires are wearing faster then the rest of the tire.the more you rotate them the longer they will last as the front tires wear faster then the rear.|`|ATh0ciALaa	balancing you put them on a little machine and you put the little weights on the little meatl thing on the lip of ur wheel..... re alighning is fiddling with your front end its much more too it than just a simple wheel balance|`|e23hKMegaa	you need to balance them
cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	They will fit on the new rims but they might not be safe, every tire has a recommended rim size width fot the tire.|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Tires have minimum and maximum approved rim widths depending on the size of the tire (not its age).  Consult the tire manufacturers product specs available on their web site to see if your tires will fit the wheels you want to use.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	wouldnt be a problem ive been changing tires about 30 yrs now a inche is nothing

Your insurance will probably double as well.|`|AA12161154	Definitely going to increase substantially. Your insurance is always going to be high until your tickets are gone from your record and until you get older. Why do you even need a 1000 cc bike if you're already excessively speeding and doing wheelies on a 600 cc bike? Seems like you're already in over your head. Don't kill yourself. It's people like you that give guys on sportbikes a bad name.
MEOjwPCNaa	I've come close, after having parked a car in a new town and gone for a leisurely walk. I had *no* idea even what street I'd parked on, and I wandered for about an hour before I finally found it. I was so embarassed...but who do you even call about that? Will the police help you find it? How much will they laugh at an able-bodied, sound-minded 25-year-old man who's "lost" something as large and expensive as a car?    Anyway, that just served to remind me that I have no natural sense of direction and I must consciously, carefully take note of my surroundings. A while after that incident I purchased an iPhone, and now I'll mark my location with  GPS when I'm parking somewhere unfamiliar. Then I can get directions back no matter where I end up. Lifesaver!|`|AfbjU9Guaa	I tend to leave my car at the same spot in our local Tesco's car park, it's huge, but I always know where it is. Until the time comes when I've parked it elsewhere because there's nowhere to park in my usual area, and if I'm not concentrating at the time, that's when I lose it. I've only done it about twice but each time I'm wondering around for ages feeling like a right tw@t!|`|1NK1hK1Taa	Twice! Once i went shopping after buying a new car. Came out of the supermarket without thinking and couldn't find it...my old one.  The second time was when i went to Birmingham Airport to fly out to Dublin. I parked in the long term carpark and after walking for a minute realised i'd better take a note of where i had parked. I flew to Dublin and then came back. Remembered the carpark i'd parked in, and then couldn't find my car. I'd forgotten i'd walked for a minute before making a note. After wandering around for ten minutes i spotted a security guard coming towards me. Thinking he might be suspicious of my intentions, i went straight to him and asked if he had seen a mint  condition MK2 Ford Escort RS 2000 in Nordic Blue? He had.  That was good. For a while i was beginning to think it had been stolen. Another twenty minutes later he spotted it. I gotta say that thinking it had been stolen was not nice.|`|hc8U4Jbhaa	Yes in London you just have to park where you can and sometimes its ages before you need the car again and it can be streets away. Also when the Mall first opened,so many were losing their cars they actually had a van driving around to help locate them !  One of our cars was  actually stolen from a car park after running up and down all levels looking and thinking myself  crazy, I asked the man at the booth who said he thought it might be stolen so he took the number !|`|8dhe15MUaa	yes i have in meadowhall car park in sheffield . i live only 20 mins from meadowhall by car . last time i was in meadowhall was just before xmas me and wife went on bus|`|cqzZjRVwaa	No, as I don't currently own a car.    Perhaps you should just stick to boats Bob?|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	I have forgotten where I parked it many times...getting frantic thinking it has been stolen only to find it on the floor below at the shopping centre is a particular pastime with me !|`|nRzNSAu2aa	not really but my step mum managed to get into someone elses car once with her car key which was strange. and i used to own a very small car and people with landrovers etc would park next to it so i couldnt see it and i'd spend ages wandering around looking for it!|`|LuqZXXyBaa	Hahaha... no I haven't done that yet. But this question and answers is great! Love it
4biGrjPkaa	Generally ￡60-￡70 for pads supplied and fitted (eg. Ford Focus 1.6) but it does vary depending on the make and model of vehicle.<br>  <br>  As for brake fluid, expect to pay about the same. The fluid is cheap, it just takes a bit of time to free off the bleed nipples (especially on older vehicles), drain the system and then 2 mechanics to bleed the new fluid into the system.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|2Y2AFV7Kaa	It really does depend where you get your work done a main dealer (someone who only deals with one make of car) will charge considerably more than an independent .It also depends on what type of car you drive a popular car will cost less than a rarer car.shop around but it probably will be less than a hundred pounds|`|VouIeBzmaa	some time it depends upon are and some time on quality and time. any way get your part from good suppliers like euro car parts so at least you get it less price and get it done around those areas where you can find most of the garage.<br>  <br>  Thanks|`|zxPZ1wqbaa	depends where you live i bought a set of front pads yesterday  for escort van for a tenna|`|ROIEoZh1aa	Depends on the make of car your talking about.
ixHwF4apaa	as such i am unable to answer you now. wait for a day let me clarify and tell you
rBcC0ricaa	if it was the clutch it would act up in all gears, there are a couple of things that can cause this, one is worn sychro cones, these are the parts that allow the gears to engage smoothly by allowing them to spin free while they are unloaded, the other would be excessive wear in the shift linkage , this is usually caused by worn rod end bushings, and is only common in cars with very high miles, over 100,000. Check the shift bushings 1st.|`|KuWLNfYbaa	Sounds like the syncromesh isn't working properly on 1st speed but if your clutch pedal doesn't feel right then perhaps you have a hydraulic fault|`|e1ec036988398a4d89da52072850d37daa	it's a manual shift? Sounds like a bad syncro.
e54245b949fc37ae37c1c0d76403714daa	Risks are how do you know the vehicle is legally his?  Who knows if the original seller of this vehicle actually signed the title?  If they didn't, and you put it directly in your name, you could be charged with a stolen vehicle!  Perhaps the original owner lost the title, and a duplicate has been issued, thus voiding out the title that your neighbor has, and in reality is no good to you.  You will not be able to title or register the vehicle.   It is also called skipping title, and you can get in trouble for that too.   Beyond that, if the original owner of the vehicle just signed the title, and did not put a date, or buyers name or price paid, your neighbor could put any purchase price...say 1.00 or 100.00 and the tax would be minimum.   If the original seller put your neighbors name in the first assignment, and your neighbor uses the second assignment for you. That is illegal.  The assignments on the back of most state titles are for dealers only.  If that is what he wants to do, that will void the title completely and no good to anyone except the person who is on the front of the title, or the original owner.   <br>  I don't like paying taxes either, but I would want everything legal.  And the legal and safe way to do this is to have your neighbor put the car in his name, pay the taxes, then with the title in his name, sign it over to you.  I would not take the chance on purchasing a vehicle without it being in the persons name I am purchasing it from.   And I wouldn't buy the car until it is in your neighbors name.  But that is my opinion, and I think it is a risky deal and not worth the trouble it could cause.|`|DXbEnHUaaa	The first thing you need to do is make sure he has the OR title, ask him if you can see the title and look for this: - LIENHOLDER NAME, TYPE OF TITLE (Salvage, Memorandum) a regular OR title is BLUE and say at the very top 'CERTIFICATE OF TITLE" if there is a lienholder name on it see it he has the lien release letter. Make sure the previous owner signed on the seller section and NO additional NAMES OR SIGNATURES are on the title. If you everything is clear you can register and title the vehicle with no problems ... make sure there is no sale price on the title and the mileage is correct.. other than that you should be fine. My guess would be that he never took the time to register or title to void paying sales taxes or never really drove the vehicle; either way you will have to pay the sale taxes. If I was you I would try to get more details about the origin of the vehicle and don't let a good deal blind you, changes are if its too good to be true .... ....|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	either way your going to pay the tax and really all one needs is to have owner to sign it under sellers name and then buyer signs it under buyers name so if he didnt sign it  then its good to take to dmv and get tags and tittle switched and sure why would he want to go pay tax then sell it and then you pay tax i dont see anything wrong with wanting to save a buck and if tittle is ok dont see any problem|`|XsZsk55Jaa	Before buying check if you need a smog check and if the car passes.  You may not even be able to register the car in California.  Maybe he found out he couldn't register it.  Is that why he's selling it so soon after buying it?|`|AA10820533	In Indiana it is legal but you have to t ke it to the police department  or any policeman in your area and they run a car check on it to see if it is not stolen.  It costs us $5 When we bought a Blazer from someone in Illinois.<br>  I would call and check with your Dmv to see how much the tax would be for you.  It is a little higher coming from another state.<br>  It is still legal just to transfer it to you But If I were you I would make him take a little more off the price for out of state sales.

fbxqLErlaa	I too thought an exhaust leak.  <br>  Start up your machine, and put your hands close to the exhaust pipe and feel for the leak.  Also listen for said leak.  <br>  An intake leak will let your engine run lean if leak is between carb and engine.|`|2FT7sVkbaa	WHAT?<br>  are you talking about an exhaust backfire?<br>  an exhaust backfire is a result of combustion on the outside of the exhaust chamber.<br>  or a tire puncture? a quick release of a much higher pressure air hitting a lower pressure air makes a loud sound of air molecules hitting each other.|`|qT3bi1Ynaa	The sound is either a exhaust leak or a blown head gasket.  Without actu8ally hearing it run I can't tell for sure.|`|ghaETYwcaa	no puncture? a tire? what exactly are ya talking about?

WpqwaqcQaa	sorry but no one buys 40 cars and sets them aside.<br>  <br>  keep looking|`|fPLv0QrSaa	There is a chance that some seals have dried up. Other components like rubber hoses, belts and tires can dry rot over time. It does have a warranty but getting a car repaired can be a hassle even if you don't have to pay for it. If you do decide to get it, I would have them replace all of the fluids (oil, trans oil, brakes, etc...) in case any of them have become contaminated with water over the years.|`|M79W3Ct9aa	I have a very, very hard time believing a gorgeous BMW has been sitting for two years.<br> <br> But, if it has, then ALL fluids needs to be changed.  OIL BREAKS DOWN!!!!!!  That's why there is a date change AND a mileage change from oil change places.  Hoses, belts, and the like will also be weaker than normal.  Honestly, I dunno if it would be worth the trouble versus a used model that has all of this already taken care of.
E2NxDyOKaa	Usually gas is not pure and has sediments in it and when especially on an older car there is a lot of sediment in the bottom of the tank and when it runs low on gas it gets stirred up and can clog the fuel filter. It is not hard to change or too expensive to fix

0jxoZr7taa	pix, I recommend you find a nearby auto insurance agent to help. Since I live in New Mexico I can't recommend an agent in New York, but here is an online resource that can help you. <a href="http://www.goodinternetdeals.com/Auto-Insurance.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.goodinternetdeals.com/Auto-In...</a> <br> <br> Good Luck!|`|fQBfjdz1aa	Your auto insurance is based on several things.  they type of vehicle  you drive, where you live, and your age and driving record.<br>  <br>  Auto insurance covers you for liability and damge to your vehicle.<br>  <br>  Liability pays out if you have an accident and you hit someone and you are at fault then the other party collects under liability.  this would include, property damage, liability, uninsured/underinsured motorist and either PIP or MED PAY.  <br>  <br>  In some states you can decline the PIP/Med Pay or the uninsured motorist.  I would NEVER do that.  PIP/Med Pay pays you or any passenger in your vehicle that is isnjured due to an accident regardless of who is at fault.  Being a student this is not something you should skip out on.  Uninsured/underinsured motorist protects you against injuries should someone hit you that is not insured  or does not have enough insurance to take care of your injures.  Some states allow  for uninsured motorist property damage which would take care of the damages to your vehcile under the same scenario.  AGAIN DO NOT decline these.  The cost is pretty minimal and the coverage is too good.<br>  <br>  The next part of the insurance is damgae to your vehicle.<br>  <br>  Comprehensive covers your vehicle for things like vandalism, hail, fire, theft, animal collisions and things like that.  You usually have a deductilbe for this.<br>  <br>  Collission covers your vehicle due to collision impact being an accident or you losing control andhitting something regadless of fault.  it also carries a deductible.<br>  <br>  Comprehensive and Collision is not something you HAVE to have, however if you have a lien (vehicle financed) you will be required to have this.  Also keep in mind if something was to happen to your vehicle whether it was your fault or not, could you afford to fix your vehicle.  if the answer is no, then think long and hard on this.  $550 every six months is not a bad rate.  GEICO is a good insurance company but you might want to check around at some others.  I would stick with the major insurance companies like State farm, Geico, Allstate, Farmers, Travellers, Hartford and such.  <br>  <br>  You don't want to find that your insurance comany stinks when you need them the most.<br>  <br>  and this will complete your Insurance 101 class of today!!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|MiLz9j7Caa	autoinsurance.undonet.com - try this one. I personally have their car insurance, cause it is the cheapest for me in our area.|`|cFA6VFQ6aa	For car insurance the obvious way to get a great rate is do a policy comparison on car policies. Make sure that you pick similar options with the same deductibles, car make, location, etc so that all things are an accurate comparison.<br>  <br>  What I usually recommend is an internet comparison quote at <a href="http://www.lowratetoday.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lowratetoday.com</a> since they have big name insurers and will give several quotes on car insurance polices.
AA11997985	There are NO RETURNS! There is no federal law requiring a car dealer or a person selling a car to take a car back. The only exceptionsare  certain transactions in California that are covered by the California Car Buyers Bill of Rights or where the dealer voluntarily offers to take a car back.   Dealers may describe the right to cancel as a "cooling-off" period, a money-back guarantee or a "no questions asked" return policy. Before you purchase from a dealer, ask about the dealer's return policy, get it in writing in the contract and read it carefully.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/car-return" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/car-return</a> <br>  <a href="http://dmv.ca.gov/pubs/billrights_top.htm" rel="nofollow">http://dmv.ca.gov/pubs/billrights_top.ht...</a>|`|8GDBr2U9aa	Only if the dealer gave you a written 30-day return privilege. Used car sales are final, there is no right to return it.|`|TbiSBXclaa	No.   A used car purchase is not something you can return like a pair of jeans that don't fit.<br>  <br>  If you buy it, you own it. There is no return policy or warranty on any used car purchase unless specifically stated in a written policy when you bought the car.|`|k56mmj2eaa	that all depends on the person that sold it to you. if there is something in the contract that says sold as is where is. then I think your out of luck, most dealers do not give you 30 days. the vehicle is yours when you drive it away|`|MLMFWV1Qaa	no
dQUISy3Haa	It is under the light housing and also under the thick black plastic bracket that the grille and lights mount on. Many technicians cut an access panel into the bracket to change the cooling fan relay. Good luck.|`|7HDWtqhOaa	Its in your PDC on the driverside of the truck under the hood and if you look under the PDC cover should identify which relay is for the fan if not, check your owners manual|`|4a0Akgieaa	C-Tech is right. I replaced ours through the hole cut by the Chrysler techs. Funny thing is they still wanted to charge me full price to replace it again even though they would have a lot less work to do. They cut about a 2-1/2" diameter hole through the black plastic under the headlight on the passenger side.|`|OcSVkKsEaa	look for a fuse box under the hood it should tell you which one it is or call the dealer and ask or go to the parts store and ask for help they should know or find out for you.
1cc0530fb7fd6e139f507fa33c7d10f1aa	The rumour was true years ago. Back in the days of yore the CBT lasted for 3 years but you couldn't retake it without a year's break. Now you just retake CBT every 2 years for as long as you like. Plenty of people, who have no reason to ride a bike over 125cc or carry passengers, do it instead of taking their practical riding test.|`|i12tJmolaa	you can do it straight away|`|mWZ9BXIdaa	No, you can do it straight away. You can even redo it before your 2 years are up if you really wanted to.
ivH8tRtsaa	If the ABS light worked before you had the wheel bearings done, and it didn't work afterward, then chances are the mechanic who did the wheel bearings, also damaged the ABS wiring. If this is the case, the mechanic who replaced the wheel bearings is responsible for repairing your ABS system that apparently worked fine before the wheel bearing replacement. Explain this to your mechanic. Threaten to take him to court if necessary. I've worked in several different car dealerships, as well as privately owned shops. You wouldn't believe how many people are cheated and tricked into paying for things that are a direct result of a mechanics mistake. I, as a mechanic, know that accidents happen and mistakes are made. I've had jobs where I was supposed to make a couple of hundred dollars, but instead, the job would end up costing me a couple of hundred dollars. I could have easily made up a story, a real complicated story, stating how the car was unsafe to drive with this particular problem and should not leave the shop without repair. The consumer, not having a clue as to what I am talking about and wanting to be safe will usually up the extra cash. Your best defense is taking someone who knows the business with you. Even if you have to pay an independent mechanic for his time and advice, it will be worth it. If you feel the mechanic isn't the one to blame, Then find a shop that specializes in ABS systems. Its better to pay a mechanic who knows, than it is to pay one that is still trying to figure it out. This way you are paying for the repair instead of the education. The main thing is to let the mechanic know that you will not take him at his word. Threaten to make some calls, do some research, or take the car to another mechanic for a second opinion. Once the mechanic knows that you are not a push over, the bill will usually be somewhere in the realm of affordability. Hope this helps.|`|eed326a0722ca2d2c57d8a6bce5110a0aa	something doesnt sound right the only thing that would stop the light working is the brakelight switch on the pedal or a break in its wiring circuit its nothing to do with an abs light or sensor wiring if that isnt working, <br>  <br>  my suggestion is find another garage fast|`|k56mmj2eaa	If I were you I think I would go to another shop and have a second person look at it and tell me what they think. But don't tell them you were at another shop or what the first shop said. because they may tell you the same thing.|`|A2M6sAklaa	yes he is ripping you off,or hes thinking about it,take the car to a vauxhall main dealers,or ask family or friends if they know of anyone that they trust with there car..good luck|`|AA10498232	All these guys are liars! <br>  I would park the car and just walk from now on!<br>  Or you could find a shop you trust and have them fix it! <br>  If you trust no one then walk!|`|zOIgzIy4aa	if they did the wheel bearings then they probably knocked the wire off that goes to 1 of the wheel sensors. you can tell yourself if you look behind each wheel and see if the wire is attached to each wheel sensor. if the ABS light don,t come on then that,s what you want. if you have trouble with the ABS brakes then your light should come on. since your a woman some garages will tell you anything to just get your money because they think your just a dumb woman and that,s not right.|`|OcSVkKsEaa	maybe he broke them off.you have to be care full around those Sensors the break easily he could of done it and wants you to pay for it because they are exspencive and he doesnt want to pay for them.

It also wouldn't shift out of third gear. Turns out the anti-knock sensor was bad. Luckily it was a warranty item.<br>  <br>  If this is not the problem, your local Toyota dealer can scan your on-board computer and find the issue in a minute or two.|`|AA10331789	If the problem only occurred after the maintenance work you did, then you may have not reconnected the air duct correctly that leads from the air filter to the engine intake manifold.

It has probably just been made, and may have only a few miles on it. These miles may be test miles at the factory, or they may be from others test driving it. Other than that, there is nothing more about the history of the car that you should know before you buy. You want to know the features and safety issues, of course, but you know it’s never been in an accident. However, when you are buying any type of used car, you need to know the car history before you buy.<br>  <br>  What is important about the car history of a vehicle is where that car may have been. The most important thing you should find out is if the car has ever been in an accident. That might not be a bad thing so much, but you do want to know as much about the damage that was done and then fixed after that accident. Some repairs are not a worry, but others can be a problem. If you see that a car has had frame damage on the car history, you want to think twice about getting it.<br>  <br>  Though you can replace a door, a window, or a bumper without compromising the car, you can’t always say the same when the frame has been bent. It is almost impossible to get a frame back into original position once it has been in a serious accident. That means you may have more problems on your hands than you think. The car history should tell you if the frame was bent and how bad the damage really was. Once you have this information, you can decide if the car is worth buying, or if you should ask them to take something off the price of the car.<br>  <br>  It used to be that you were on your own when it came to the car history of any vehicle you were going to buy. Some people are very honest when selling used cars, but many more would rather not tell you what has really happened to that car. Today, however, you can always ask anyone selling you a car for a car history. There are companies that specializes in this, and if they won’t get you one, you can get one on your own for a price. When you want to be sure about a car, this is the way to go. Find a dealer that offers them up with any car, and you have found a great place to stop for your next vehicle.|`|0ab5d486a988dd6b7666dfb80c376412aa	carfax.com or ask the dealer where you got the car and they should be happy to give you one

c48nm70gaa	Absolutely. Full synthetic Mobil1 5W-30 pours at -47 below 0 Farenheit. Considering that 80% of engine wear occurs during cold starts it's to your oil pumps advantage to force the greatest *volume of oil to frictional surfaces quickly. <br>  <br>  Synthetic oil is much more fluid at low temperatures than regular oil. It has a great detergent package as well as EP (extreme pressure) and anti-oxidation properties.<br>  <br>  Check your handbook in the glove compartment for the proper oil viscosity for your car. I pulled 5W-30 off the mobil oil help website. Older (1999) 3800 Buick engines in Pontiac Grand Prix cars (mine) call for the use of 10W-30 in supercharged and naturally aspirated motors. In my Pontiac handbook it says to use 5W-30 when temperatures drop below 32 F.<br>  <br>  I recently switched from regular Quakerstate 10W-30 in my 99 Pontiac GP to Kendall full synthetic as the local hardware store runs terrific specials a few time a year for $3.50 per quart! I bought this car from my sister because it had only 62,000 miles and the body (red) is perfect and it's always been taken car of.|`|AA10331789	I have used <a href="http://www.mobilone.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mobilone.com</a> full synthetic oil in all my dozen cars or so since the late 1970's. Many of my cars have gone over 200,000 miles. I typically changed the oil and filter at 8500 miles. I have removed the valve covers on several of the engines including a 1981 VW diesel engine and always found the inside metal surfaces sparkling bright, clean surfaces with no carbon build up whatsoever. The fact that many vehicles come standard now with Mobil One installed is a testament to it's superiority over conventional oils even when compared on a cost basis. The first answer above also coincides with my experiences.|`|FsT54qh1aa	Use the synthetic....especially with a boosted engine. Synthetic oil stands up better to extreme temperatures and yes, your engine will live a longer life vs conventional oil.|`|e1ec036988398a4d89da52072850d37daa	The major benefit of Synthetic is that it can go alot longer between changes.  It stands up to abuse better. If you used regular oil and changed it more often it would be the same. I always use Synthetic Oil just to be on the safe side.

902bf06cc6e416f1757072330cfc5b9daa	Heh, heh, heh.<br>  <br>  Everybody is all over the place on this one.  The problem is the use of the word "gears".<br>  <br>  All diesel electrics have gears mounted on the traction motor and wheel.  The "pinion" gear is on the motor itself, while the "ring" gear is attached to the wheel.  Most freight locos have a 62:15 gear ratio allowing them to operate up to 72 MPH.  This information is stenciled right on the side of the trucks.  Passenger locos are geared higher, so they can operate at passenger train speeds of 79 MPH and up from there.<br>  <br>  If you mean "gear box," as in a transmission, the answer is no.  But, they do "shift gears" electrically.  When starting out, the motors are operating in "parallel" and at about 19 to 22 mph they take "transition," where contactors change their position and the traction motors are now operating in "series,"  essentially having been "rewired." These are probably the two "gears" most are referring to.  But, keep in mind the earlier diesel electric locomotives, while also taking transition, this action was performed by the engineer, via the transition lever (selector) on the control stand, rather than automatic, electric switch gear in use today.  This technology is not all that far gone, as first generation SD-40s still had the selector switches in place when I hired out, shortly after the dinosaurs went extinct.<br>  <br>  For a time, the SP experimented with German built Krause Maffei locomotives that incorporated a diesel hydraulic power system.  These had actual transmissions that operated essentially like an automatic transmission in an automobile.  They didn't make the grade as they were not designed to handle the high tonnage numbers for US freight trains, especially in the large amount of grade territory that the SP operated in and as a result they were constantly breaking the drive lines powering the wheels.<br>  <br>  And, with the semantics involved, it could be argued that steam engines were "geared" also.  This is because the engineer would change the position of the "power reverse," while out and running, which, through valve gear, shortened the stroke of the valve gear to allow for smoother, high speed operation.  Just for fun I'll add, when in full forward, the longest stroke and full power, it was said that the power reverse was "in the corner."  When running at speed, the power reverse was moved rearward, short of top dead center, and was said to be in "the company notch."<br>  <br>  Not a stupid question at all, and now you have your answer.|`|AA10164889	What a collection of answers and pseudo-answers.  Wow!<br>  <br>  The problem is that "gears" can mean several things.  A common meaning is "toothed wheels."  These transfer torque from a driving shaft to a driven shaft by engaging teeth with the teeth of adjoining gears.  There are lots of gears in the mechanisms of railroad locomotives, but I don't think that is what you are asking.<br>  <br>  Another meaning of "gears" is "selectable speed-to-torque ratios," which is what you are asking about.  As in the gearshifts or transmissions in cars and trucks.  You seem to be asking, "Do locomotive operators shift gears as they gain speed the same way truck drivers do?"<br>  <br>  The answer is "No."  Ninety-nine percent of all modern railroad locomotives are diesel-electric, which means that the locomotive has a transmission that uses electric devices to transfer the power from a diesel engine to the wheels.<br>  <br>  Basically, the diesel engine turns a generator and cables and contactors send the power to electric motors that turn the wheels.  The electric motors produce high torque from a standing start, and allow the locomotive to speed up gradually while still transmitting a high level of power to the wheels.<br>  <br>  There are large amounts of information about locomotives and how they work available on the internet and in your school library.<br>  <br>  Notes:  I remember the Krauss-Maffeis.  They were mean-looking, and awesome when they were working right.  They had lots of mechanical problems.  Indeed there have been diesel-hydraulic and diesel-mechanical locomotives, but they are so rare they do not relate to the asker's question.<br>  <br>  The reversing gear on a steam locomotive's valve gear is sort of like a transmission, but not really.  The ratio of speeds between the cylinders and the wheels does not change.  The cutoff mechanism only controls the portion of the piston motion that is done by live steam pressure, as opposed to that done by expansion of steam.  The asker can look this up on the internet under "steam locomotive valve gear."<br>  <br>  And only more modern and larger steam locomotives had power reverse.  The rest had manual reversing gear.  I got to operate one once, and it took all my strength and weight to move the lever from full reverse to full forward and back.  But girls rule!  I did it!|`|dUN468v3aa	The problem is that you're asking a generic question to get a specific answer. While none of the answers you have already got are wrong, you haven't yet got the answer you're looking for.<br>  <br>  It sounds like the type of train you're familiar with which has sparked this question is a modern electric train probably somewhere in London, the West Midlands or the North West. This being the case, it's either a train from the Networker family or a Class 323. (Google for images of each and see which one looks familiar.)<br>  <br>  These trains were among the first in the UK to have a new type of traction equipment using 3-phase AC electric motors instead of the more usual DC electric motors. The idea behind this was that they were lighter, more powerful and allowed the designers to fit regenerative braking, where the forward motion of the train could be converted back into electricity and returned to the grid. But in order for this to work the trains need quite a bit of complex control electronics.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure precisely where in the traction equipment this noise comes from, but these trains do make a sound very much like the driver is going up through a gearbox like on a road car. However, they are not. The electric motors are permanently meshed to the final drive with a single ratio, so there is no gearbox as such. The sound is purely electrical and comes from within the control equipment somewhere.<br>  <br>  **EDIT**<br>  <br>  Done a bit of reading and it's all very complicated. Unless you're seriously into electrical engineering the precise reason for the noises you hear is going to go right over your head (as it did mine).<br>  <br>  Basically it boils down to how the electronics that control the motors work. Modern electric trains use asynchronous AC motors with a 3-phase supply fed from a DC supply to an inverter and controlled using micro-processor controlled Gate Turn Off (GTO) thyristors. It is these GTO thyristors that create the "gearing" sound you hear as the 3-phase supply is modulated to match the motor speed.<br>  <br>  Even newer generations of electric trains, such as the Desiro and Electrostar, use newer technology that do away with the GTO thyristor. As a result there is almost none of the "gearing" sound that you get with the Class 323 or Networker trains, just a kind of higher pitched rippling whine.|`|d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	The 323 has no gears, just one 3-phase AC induction motor directly geared to each axle.   AC motors are very simple, but need very complex "chopper" controls that synthesize the very particular AC frequencies required to drive the motors.  That's what you're hearing. (listen to audio)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLNLmA4bj8Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLNLmA4bj...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwW0lcAJ4xI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwW0lcAJ4...</a><br>  <br>  A 3-phase AC induction motor works like a torque converter, but with magnetic fields instead of hydraulic.  Instead of an engine, you send it 3-phase AC power at certain frequencies.  That's where the complicated electronics comes in.  If you send a frequency that's faster than the motor's rotation, it'll try to speed up, more difference = more speed (like you'd expect from a torque converter).  Send too slow a frequency and it'll try to slow down (a torque converter would push the engine, here it'll try to regenerate electricity). <br>  <br>  Why do they make that crazy sound on startup and slowdown?  Obviously they're "ramping" the frequency several times, which will also "ramp" the torque several times. I'm guessing they're doing that to avoid possible wheelslip?  Maybe they can't detect individual wheelslip?  (AC chopper controllers are expensive, so often one chopper will drive several motors, one might be slipping.) <br>  <br>  GREAT question!<br>  <br>  Update: I talked to one of the senior design engineers at BART.  He thinks each "ramp" that you're hearing is an increase in voltage (and also frequency, as discussed.)  In an ideal world, they would simply create exactly the voltage and frequency that each motor needs in that moment, and you'd hear a very smooth sound.  But that would require a tremendous amount of computing power.  Modern PC's can just barely do that, it certainly wasn't possible when those railcars were designed.  (and updating computers isn't really practical either.)   That means the train has only a few choices of voltage, and it must cycle through the ones it has.  So in a sense it is like gears, electronic gears.   I hope I explained that adequately, it is complicated.|`|fbxqLErlaa	Engines are not equipped with any type of transmission.  Gear attached to electric motor drives gear attach to drive axle.  <br>  Electric motors can generate 100% of their torque at any rpms.  So as soon as you apply power (electricity) to the motor, motor will rotate, moving the engine and the string of cars.<br>  There is a locomotive shop outside our shop.  We manufacturer new axles and install the gears, wheels, and Timken AP bearings.|`|1e85b081f9cb68b21b9d1357e658f9ccaa	Almost all USA trains use Diesel motor to turn a generator. In turn that power generated runs electric motors that turn the wheels. Even Steam Locomotive's did not have gears. More speed larger driver wheels. Bullett trains may use turbine motors to turn generators and electric motors to drive the wheels. HOW THINGS WORK|`|QpP1xJ4Naa	To say no trains have/had gears is wrong! There were several geared locomotives (Shay, for example). But they did not have a selectable gears shift.<br>  In modern locomotives each axle is driven by an electric or hydraulic motor. through gears. But again it is a set gear ratio.<br>  If the engine (internal combustion) was connected through a gear box to the wheels, and the engine did not have enough horse power to get the train rolling, something would have to break. But by using electricity the power can be increased to a point that the train starts to roll. There is a limit to how much one locomotive can get moving, so multiple lash-ups are used.<br>  See the link it may help.|`|GtBOQPKqaa	Locomotives today don't have gears like you'd find in your car's transmission; electricity is provided from some source (diesel engine or overhead wire) that is sent to the traction motors on the wheelsets for propulsion.<br>  <br>  What you're probably hearing is the "transition" within the wiring. Locomotives are complex beasts; their traction motor wiring will switch ("transition") between being wired in series and wired in parallel, depending on speed, and whether it's moving from a dead stop, to maintaining movement.|`|TV47lmZ3aa	i didn't think that they had any TBH|`|9005158cdc6d6b908387138e47f519e0aa	Most diesel trains are actually diesel-electric and therefore - like any electric train - have no gears at all.<br>  <br>  But there are two other types:<br>  * Diesel-hydraulic: here the motor's power is transmitted by hydraulic converters that may have more than one adjustment - which could be interpreted as kind of 'gears'.<br>  * Diesel-mechanic: this type of transmission is used in some small railcars and is (literally) the same as in a truck with an automatic gearbox with typically somewhere around 4 to 6 gears. Some old diesel railcars even had manual transmission :-)<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Being no native english-speaker I might have confused something. I'm using 'gear' in the sense of 'gear change' oder 'gear shift'.<br>  All locomotives do of course have gears (in the sense of 'toothed wheels') to transmit the power from the motors to the wheels.<br>  <br>  Edit 2: @aviophage below: diesel-mechanic and diesel-hydraulic transmission might not be common in the US but it still is in Europe. However: diesel-electric is on the increase since it is much easier to handle, less delicate, and - especially with modern electronics - also more efficient.|`|TReglwOHaa	The only gears the have are to connect the electric motor to the wheels. What you refer to is the throttle notches and making transition.<br>  A normal locomotive has 8 throttel notches that can be selected. Transition accrues at 22-25mph and At this point, the locomotive will essentially cease to accelerate, unless on a downgrade. Since this plateau will usually be reached at a speed substantially less than the maximum that may be desired, something must be done to change the drive characteristics to allow continued acceleration. This change is referred to as "transition," a process that is analogous to shifting gears in an automobile.<br>  <br>  Transition methods include:<br>  <br>  Changing the traction motor connections from series or series/parallel to parallel. In parallel mode, the back EMF developed by the motors will not increase as rapidly as in series operation, as the now-parallel field will develop a magnetic flux strength that is independent of armature current. Therefore, armature current can continue to increase without causing an increase in field current, preventing the latter from changing the rate at which back EMF can increase. In some cases, resistance may be introduced in series with the field winding to accentuate this effect. This type of transition is known as "motor transition." <br>  Reducing motor field current while operating in series mode by placing resistance in parallel with the field. This has the effect of increasing the armature current, producing a corresponding increase in motor torque and speed. This method is variously termed "field shunting," "field diverting" or "weak fielding." <br>  Reconnecting the two separate internal MG stator windings from parallel to series to increase the output voltage. This is called "generator transition." <br>  In older locomotives, it was necessary for the engineer to manually execute transition by use of a separate control. As an aid to performing transition at the right time, the load meter (an indicator that informs the engineer on how much current is being drawn by the traction motors) was calibrated to indicate at which points forward or backward transition should take place. Automatic transition was subsequently developed to produce better operating efficiency, and to protect the MG and traction motors from overloading due to improper transition. This is the same for a diesel electric or a pure electric locomotive they only difference is a diesel carries its power source with it and an electric gets it power from overhead.

You need to get together with your instructor and assess exactly what errors you have made, and why, then you can concentrate on your weakness(es). Quite often a serious error is just 3 or 4 of the same minor error - the reason people fail is that they worry about having made an error instead of concentrating on avoiding repeating the same mistake. Remember you cannot change a mistake once it is made - you must put it out of your mind and not do the same thing again.

mKVFIklaaa	Someone told you wrong: The 1.4D-4D diesel has very similar performance to the 1.4VVTi petrol. The diesel is a second or so slower to 60, but it produces far more torque, and makes it's power lower in the rev range, so has far more overtaking power without the need for changing down, and far more flexibility in traffic. It will also average 16mpg more than the petrol. The same applies for most cars, to the extent that in the British touring car championships, Seat diesels (which are restricted to the same size as everyone else's petrol engines) are easily on par with their competitors, and have a huge torque advantage.

67K4awwDaa	If you are going through a dealer, just ask for the vehicle history and you will get it for free.  They purchase accounts to have all car information available to them.  If you know someone who has an unlimited account already for carfax, that's a good way to get the car history for a car not being sold by a dealer.  You could always try asking the seller to see if they already have the information on hand.|`|c7YlgvD5aa	tt<br>   If you go to a dealer or these days even a individual, if they won't let you see the history report then don't buy from them. Because they know the history.   good Luck bs

AA10503489	I have heard of it. I'm sure that squirting 200F washer fluid on a sub zero windshield caused cracked windshields, and that's why you don't hear about it anymore.|`|YwqfYVPbaa	Never heard of that before. Interesting. I have heard that you can make moonshine in a radiator but something tells me that's not a very good idea.|`|i5lk5eN2aa	Running the washer fluid hoses over or through the radiator will heat those hoses in close proximity to the radiator but would do nothing to heat the rest of the fluid in the reservoir tank and delivery system. There are also electrically heated washer fluid nozzles but they also have the same problem, they do nothing to heat the fluid in the reservoir tank and delivery system or to prevent the fluid from freezing on the windshield. Nothing works in sub-zero temps as well as Prestone de-Icer washer fluid. It will not freeze down to -34 F and it removes frost and ice from the windshield and helps clear ice from the wiper blades.|`|mTwn8p79aa	I think you're confusing windshield washers with wet intercoolers for turbo charged engines.    To get your washer's to work in subzero temperature you should be able to just use a good quality washer fluid.  You could also add alcohol or an antifreeze made for this purpose or look for cold temp fluid.  Running those plastic lines across hot components would be a good way to ensure melting the lines.  I lived in minnesota for years and only had my washer fluid not work on the very coldest mornings, you know -40 or so.  I never had problems down to -30.    Wet intercoolers spray washer fluid on the intercooler to get the air coming into the turbo/super charger colder.  Colder air is denser and makes the engine more efficient.|`|0CkFC43raa	never heard of it, but if you add some alcohol to your washer fluid, you lower the freezing point of water substantially. that is what they do with windshield washer fluid.
WO68RZdIaa	The only way to get the reinstatement of his license is to settle the debt with the insurance company- either by paying the owed amount in full or coming to an agreement on a payment plan.    And all driver's licenses are the property & controlled by the state from which it was issued. It was the state of FL that did the actual suspension, not the insurance company. The insurance company may have requested the suspension, but they have no authority to suspend someone's license.|`|IXtiKaOYaa	The insurance company's subrogation department will be going after you for the amount owed for the damage.  You will probably only get a letter stating they paid $XXX.    Most likely they are trying to get a payment plan set up to be paid in full.   Until that time,  the license maybe suspended.    I suggest you call the DMV and ask them what you will need in documents to get the license reinstated.  Even if you pay in full, the license will still show suspended and if he is driving could be arrested or have addtl court fees.   You may need to talk to a lawyer for advice.  Most lawyers will give you a free consultation on your rights.  The cost to hire a lawyer maybe less than if you go it alone.  But get your legal rights first.   A lawyer maybe able to get a temporary license for employment only.    Also, an insurance company maybe more cooperative to a lawyer vs the liable person.   Good luck,|`|tKWwZpOAaa	Its probably better to ask the state or a lawyer, not people on here.|`|5xU6079Baa	I love in MN and here it is up to the state DMV to suspend DL's not insurance companies. I would talk to the DMV of Florida.|`|84150d8c6cd9fc2e974272b0e0ddc3c3aa	So they said they would have it re-instated if you sent in cheques, and they would fax the itemized statement.  So you haven't sent the cheques, they haven't sent the statement.  Tough noogies.  Send the cheques, they will send the statement.  Eventually they will sue you, in the meantime, he doesn't get his licence because you people are refusing to take financial responsibility for his illegal actions in driving an uninsured vehicle.    And just for clarification, the insurance company hasn't suspended his licence, the DMV has, based on the report from the insurance company stating there was liability for the accident, but no insurance as required by law.  Until the liability is paid, either in whole, or by an agreed plan, the DMV will not re-instate.

Have you checked those?|`|a05jCTBRaa	Does it sound like it's trying to start or does it do nothing when turning the key?   If you are able to pull start it (pop the clutch) then it probably just needs a new starter on it. Very easy fix if you are at all handy with tools.|`|v77NR2WGaa	Most common solution is the replace the Starter, most likely it is the original one. I had that problem before before i decided to replace the starter and try a new one in it's place and it worked fine after that.  I checked everything from the battery connections and the relay. they were fine, but I found out the starter is worn out ,it will start a quarter of the time and all other times it will not.   But for your problem is I think it might be the starter teeth that is worn or misaglined ,you might want to check the mounting bolts on it to make sure it is tight and is connected to the flywheel teeth. easiest way is to take the starter off and look at it(teeth) and check it for sideways movement ,if it does move a little sideways it means the bearings are worn out
Z13CWyNGaa	Well two possibilities, either there is something wrong with the idle control system causing the car to die at idle and run extremely rich at lower rpm or you have a fuel leak. Fuel leak usually comes with low performance, and bad gas mileage. It will also be visible from the engine comparment, or underneath the car when the key is turned to "ON". A problem with the idle control system will show no real performance lost a cruising and mid range acceleration...|`|AA11557162	go to a mechanic<br>  its very dangerous to drive you car<br>  i think you have a leak from the gas tank<br>  they check that for smog now<br>  <br>  so you have to fix that.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	What kind of car is this????

BJERgbM5aa	By commercial pilot, you mean big passenger jets, right?  Most pilots for the big commercial airlines receive their initial training from the military.  Not all.  But most.  You can also attend flight school to learn how to pilot one of those big babies.  However, the airlines do have other qualifications besides pilot experience.  Age, education, personal background, health, etc.  Your best course of action is to:  find out requirements to become a pilot in the RAF.  find out requirements to become a pilot for an airline.  finish High School.  Start college, taking plenty of business courses, (the airlines like that).  If the RAF info is good for you, finish college, Join the RAF, and do your thing. Good Luck.|`|ampkZtrXaa	If you join the RAF, and learn to fly with them, be aware that when you leave, you will have absolutely no flying qualifications at all, not even a private pilots license.

t3Mq9Tooaa	boogie 4 was mostly right about everything. They have plenty of power, it just comes in the form of torque. I have no problem getting mine up to 80....well it says 90 because the 33" tires throw off the speedo. But they aren't without their problems. The early model engines had some weak walls, and poorly milled holes. But the later years 89-93 the engines were great. Mine has never run hot, and in fact over cooling is more likely in cooler weather. But yeah the first diesel for chevy was the 5.7 and it was used in a few trucks but mostly cars like the caddy. And they were converted gassers. I have a 84 K5 with a 1993 6.2, the heads were ported and polished, the manifolds were ported, and it runs like a champ. People can't believe it isn't turbo. I get anywhere from 17-25 mpg's. Check out my photobucket page for a some pics and a short video.|`|d9ECb7N8aa	They are not the gas converted... The converted were 350ci (5.7L) diesels found in the GM cars.    They were Detroits. They make little power, are naturally aspirated (stock form), are indirect injected (IDI) so they run hot.     They are like the old Cummins motors; they just run. They always run. They are dependable and cannot remember any major flaws at the moment. They did produce good fuel economy empty or loaded, you just never got anywhere really fast.    I towed a snow cat with a 1-ton (4.10 or 4.56 can't remember) with the 6.2L that was bone stock. My '97 half-ton (3.73 gears) (overloaded) with same cat, would outrun the 6.2L from a stop, pulling a hill was pretty similar. The 6.2L whooped the small-block gasser in fuel economy.|`|pckuIRhsaa	They have a tendency to blow head gaskets on a regular basis. The engine was designed as a gas engine and converted to diesel. It was never designed for the compression ratios encountered in a diesel.|`|AA10346371	You are asking about vehicles that are between 18 and 28 years old.

GAMkUH9Taa	The labor rate for this mirror is .6 hrs. so if the shop charges $100 per hour, the labor would be $60. Add the price of the mirror and you would probably be looking at between $100 to $150 total. Do not take the car to the dealership as it will be very expensive. Also you should go with a used mirror if you have the option. One other choice you may have is doing it yourself. Get a mirror off of Ebay and find some shop info either at your library or at autozone.com. They are not all that hard to replace. Hope this helps and your rents will get over it!|`|tlue10gAaa	Call a junk yard and see if you can buy the mirror your need. Might cost $50-100. It is not hard to replace. You may have to remove interior door panel but might not. The mirror is usually held on with three screws. Unscrew the broken mirror base and attach the new mirror. Reassemble. You can call a Chevrolet dealer to get a price of what they will charge for the part and labor. Then you will have more incentive for making the repair yourself.|`|807468dd664eb843d2688db5647b25b0aa	well it's cheaper to buy them on the internet than to buy them in a shop.

AA12339318	If there is only one piece of advice to give, I would answer, "Slow Down."    The number one contributing factor toward injuried and death in a vehicle collission is speed.  There is NO EXCUSE for driving over the posted speed limit, and, in less than perfect conditions, one shouldn't even drive AT the limit.    Slow down.    Slow down.    Slow down.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	Just obey the traffic rules and be aware of your surroundings and the road conditions. And keep repeating this mantra; "' What if, what if, what if, what if "'    example; what if that car does pull out. what if that car stops, what if that car doesn't stop.|`|XLXncQu9aa	Here are a list of ways to avoid car accidents.     *Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol or a Controlled Substance. Its never a good idea. Some of the worst accidents Ive seen are caused by drunk drivers. Most people who consume alcohol do not think they are too impaired to driving.    *Falling Asleep at the Wheel. If you get tired while driving, pull over and take a quick nap.     *Running a Red Light. Dont enter an intersection after the light turns red.    *Turning Left on a Yellow Light. When the light is turning yellow, vehicles going straight try to beat the light. But the person who needs to turn left has been waiting in the intersection.    * Following Too Closely. It is hard in crowded traffic to keep a safe distance between you and the car in front without someone cutting in front of you, but you have to discipline yourself to do it. Think of space as a big cushion or pad of safety. That buffer of space will save you from many accidents that occur when people in front of you have to slam on their brakes or take evasive action.    *Failure to Adjust Speed Given the Road Conditions. Too many people travel too fast, ignoring speed limits. Also, people fail to adjust their speed when hazardous conditions exist. Speed limits are maximum speeds, and if hazardous conditions exist, drop your speed below the maximum so you can have time to react to approaching conditions.    *Failure to Pay Attention. Many accidents also occur because people get distracted, talking on their hand-held cell phones, leaning down to pick something up, eating, talking to someone in the car, etc.|`|LV9l8EFkaa	leave the car at home, failing that dont aim your car at other cars|`|oojO4WAraa	Don't go too fast and stay on your own side of the road.

bGuRQqNmaa	It just means how many miles have been driven in the car. 300 miles is really good for a car. that means it's going to last a while and you won't need to get any serious repairs or replacements for a while. But if a salesmen tells you the car has like 200,000 miles or something on it, it should be really cheap because it won't last you that long.|`|9NSfJChaaa	That is how many miles the engine has already on the car.  Likewise, if it was a boat they would refer to it as hours the boat's engine has.<br>  <br>  Just because the car has 300 miles does NOT mean it is used.  As long as a car has never been titled it is considered a new car.  You can purchase a new car that was used as a demo with 3,000 miles on it... and it will be significantly cheaper than a like model with only 3 miles... but it is still considered new.|`|eVeWxvsHaa	It means that the car is used. When it was used it was driven a total of 300 miles. <br>  <br>  Lets say you drive it 200 more miles and then you sell it. You would tell the person it has 500 miles on it (300+200)|`|pMnMgt4Vaa	Hah, the car has been driven almost 300 miles.<br>  :] funny bro.<br>  Good Luck.|`|iP42ua07aa	are you 5? how do you not know what miles are?|`|8UOX4HU4aa	If you are just buying it, thats how much mileage it has, if it was used, if you are just bringing it in for a check up, that means either it has 300 miles till it dies, or 300 till your next checkup. check your warrenty if it is your car that you brought in.|`|EeSZf5qraa	I think he means the car has only done 300 miles.

dRozk0cCaa	hmmm what i usually do when that happen is while the alarm is going off close the door and turn the key from outside on your driver door usually that will turn it off.
AXNkmdbKaa	Not only are the push rods not interchangeable but most of the bolts are not.  Torque the rocker stud nuts to the torque shown in the manual and there should be not play in the rockers at that point.  You did soak them in oil before installation didn't you?  To fill up the compression chamber in them?|`|RmCzLQTVaa	there is no adjustment procedure, just tighten the pivot bolts (spec is somewhere around 25 ft lbs do not over tighten) you do know the int & the exh push rods are diff lenghts & CAN NOT be interchanged right?
MeeJWmGtaa	It's not an acronym, it's an English word.    fob 1 |f?b|  noun (also fob chain)  a chain attached to a watch for carrying in a waistcoat or waistband pocket.  ? a small ornament attached to a watch chain.  ? (also fob pocket) a small pocket for carrying a watch.  ? a tab on a key ring.  ORIGIN mid 17th cent. (denoting a fob pocket in a waistband): origin uncertain; probably related to German dialect Fuppe pocket.
sCqdisvnaa	It's humming because it doesn't know the words...    Seriously, if it's happening all the time, while it might be the tires, it could also be an indication that the tires are not wearing evenly.  Check the wear pattern across all 4 tires, and if it's uneven, get an alignment.    The pitch of the noise should change with speed, though, if it's related to the tires rotating.    Does the sound change with engine revs, as opposed to road speed?  If it does, look for problems in the serpentine belt system.|`|yQdA5rHnaa	if it's kind of an ossilating hum it could be a bad wheel bearing.  or if a steady hum it could just be noisy tires.|`|159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	I've got the same problem with my 2006 G-6. It sounds like a harmonic hum, and comes from the rear tires.    Run it in for a quick look-see at your tire dealer; they'll tell you if it's cupping tires or if the rear needs to be aligned. Weak struts can also cause the wear. Other than this, I'm extremely happy with the car and have had not problems. Good luck.
wXyoo8mNaa	It sounds like the head gasket,not good bigg$$$ .check your coolant is it low, the right color,should be green or orange,or is it milky and smell funny.check oil is it to high or to low and milky and foamy if u have a friend thats  good with cars have him/her take alook for u.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	Overheating?    I bet that plastic intake manifold cracked and the coils got soaked with coolant as well.    You best find the money to get it checked.|`|mTwn8p79aa	The last time it happened the engine died, all the lights always come on when that happens so the lights don't mean anything special.    This could be cheap or very expensive.  It sounds like you probably just needed a thermostat but I'm worried about it because you kept driving until the engine actually stopped running.  If you would have stopped driving when you over heated it would have probably only been about $150 - $200.  Now that it's stopped running, it could be completely seized.  That would mean a new engine and that would probably mean the end of that car as it would be cheaper to buy a new 2001 than it would be to replace the engine.    Does it still run?  After you stopped on the side of the road, did you try to start it?  What happened when you tried to start it.  Did it make the normal noise but wouldn't start?  (probably blown head gasket, very bad)  Did it just click? (that would be VERY bad, that's the seized engine refusing to turn over.)  Did it start but run rough?  (that would mean blown head gasket and possible damage internally, also very bad.)  Did it start but still ran hot (here's your best case scenario, could still be cheap to fix!)    I hope this isn't just a very expensive lesson on what to do when your car overheats.|`|vmNHuAKjaa	you are probably low on radiator fluid and maby a new fuel filter would help
mTwn8p79aa	Decent but honestly, less is more with alarms.  Just go with the one LED design so it looks like it came with an alarm instead of something that you know was purchased separately.|`|dRozk0cCaa	i agree with the guy above me.
WO68RZdIaa	According to the CA DMV Teen Driver website, you don't need to do anything until your license expires. The Provisional restrictions will automatically end once you turn 18. (See excerpt below)        "When you turn 18 years of age, the provisional part of your license ends. You may continue to drive as an adult using your photo license, which will expire on your 5th birthday after the date you applied."    CA DMV Teen Driver Website  http://dmv.ca.gov/teenweb/dl_btn2/dl.htm    And if you do get an updated license, you will have a fee to pay. Then when your license expires in probably a few more years, you will have to pay again for the renewal. If you don't have to do anything right now, it may be best to just keep the money until you are required to renew.
AA10458195	Take a bag of kitty litter and spread it where you will be driving on the ice. It will give you traction. Be careful out there tho.|`|o9GOoSJKaa	i would take the matter into my own hands and ask every neighbor to buy a bag of salt and just go to town on your parking lot|`|meqrA9ZZaa	I'd say 6 inches of ice is a bit much for trying to clear with salt, you'd probably have more success with pickaxes.    Anyway, the others have said it, slow is the keyword, and when you got rwd, be prepared for the car going straight when you want it to turn.|`|FB34DwJFaa	I copied this from an article:  If you skid, remain calm. Let off the gas but do not put on the brake. Pushing the gas will cause your tires to spin out due to the reduced traction. Braking to hard will cause your wheels to lock up and you will slide out of control. If it is your front wheels that are sliding, let off the gas and keep the steering wheel steady. If your rear wheels skid, let off the gas and turn the wheel in the same direction that back of the car is sliding. Standard brakes should be pumped gently, but anti-lock brakes require a light and steady pressure.|`|h0rt6YJ4aa	Sue em.  They have a duty to you to keep your living areas clean clear and safe.  Check your lease/building agreement|`|MEOjwPCNaa	Very slowly. Try not to brake or steer while you're on the ice. If you start to skid, turn into the skid (counter-intuitive, but it works.)    RWD is a disadvantage on ice, as you probably know, because there is less weight over the drive wheels compared to a FWD or AWD car. Just take it easy.    At parking lot speeds, ice is not too hard to negotiate. People get into trouble with ice when they suddenly hit a patch they didn't see.

AA10164889	There is one Class J locomotive still in existence, and it is stored at the Virginia Museum of Transportation in Roanoke VA.  It is in semi-operable condition and was last steamed in 1994.  The 611 belongs to the museum and is not for sale.<br>  <br>  You might get one made to order for you, but it would be very, very expensive--probably several hundred million dollars.  That's because the kind of foundry facilities required for the construction of a super-power steam locomotive like the Class J no longer exist in the United States.  You would come closer to finding a foundry that could cast the engine bed, cylinder linings, wheel centers and rods in China than you would in the United States.<br>  <br>  Sorry--it just isn't possible.

AA11435704	You should be scared. You were driving without a license. You did not have someone in the car with you. Your learners permit was expired so even if you did have a licensed driver with you, you still would have been in violation of the law. <br>  <br>  Go to court and provide proof that you have gotten the license (and insurance) and ask the judge for leniency. Expect to pay the fines. The officer will always tell you to just pay the fine. Always go to court instead. Dress nicely (think Church with Grandma, not club with friends) Be respectful and see what happens.<br>  <br>  Each state is different, but you have committed serious violations. Driving without a license (and most likely insurance) is not something that is taken lightly.

Lq2X7HEAaa	I'm sorry for your troubles.  It depends.  If you ran your car hot for too long you could've warped your heads, which is bad.  Have someone else look at it though.  If you did warp your heads, you could get replacement ones and that would be a lot cheaper than a new engine.  Talk to the guy and ask him why exactly you need a new engine.  Because replacing a head gasket isn't rocket science.|`|91365d1a40ff3d8ae08da3542098d99baa	it all depends on how hot your engine got after your head gasket blew  it it got extremely hot then you might|`|GAMkUH9Taa	Not necessarily, but depending on whether or not there was additional damage done, it may be cheaper to just swap out the engine.

AA10724010	Unless you want to spend $2200 on a new transmission you better have this car serviced while the problem is likely small.  Transmission fluid should be changed or flushed every 30,000 miles.  Have you checked the fluid level lately?

I'd love to see pics of it!|`|0WsA13VSaa	Congratulations ! on joining the step-thru fraternity.  It is a step in the right direction.  Believe me, I know this from experience.  I used my Honda Cub 100cc step-thru for 9 whole years and totally relished the experience.<br>  <br>  There is very little to go wrong with the vehicle.  Being one of the most successful models to come from the Honda stable, you can bet on it.<br>  <br>  Using the choke to start the vehicle is recommended.  However if you find your bike starts just as easily without it, then great.  Keep changing the engine oil.  It is a very hard working engine and that is the least we can give it in return.  Giving the air-cleaner sponge a nice rinse once in a while will ensure that you have an easy breathing engine and will return a better mileage.<br>  <br>  Keep smiling.  You are off to a smiling start.  Cheers !
cn0ALwwLaa	It is a tough call. If it looks good, it depends on how bad and how it was 'wrecked.'<br>  <br>  Dont ask for money back, sounds like you did good. Just see how much it will be to fix it.<br>  <br>  Maybe it should have cost $5000, but if it looks good it is still less than it would be. Even if it costs $1000 to fix, you still came in under the regular normal price, so I would say Yes, you did good and No, you did not overpay.|`|FsT54qh1aa	The price seems fair for the average 2002 Altima. I personally wouldn't drive a car that was previously wrecked for safety reasons though. If you bought it from a private seller that was selling it "as is" you are probably stuck with it and you won't get any money back. If you bought it from a dealership, you may be able to talk them into giving you back some money for it or allowing you to return it for a different vehicle. Threatening to contact the BBB or a lawyer might help too.

Gn0nR2S1aa	There is a sealer called " Blue Devil " on the market, available at most parts stores that i have used in this situation and have had great results.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	if your going to get rid of it pretty soon then throw some bars leak in it. it might hold it for awhile.|`|AA10419188	First thing is to try and figure out where the leak is!  True, - it may be in head, but generally speaking,- heads do not corrode so fast ,--- is this vehicle over 15-20 years old?  Now "pushing the envelope" driving when too hot may warp head, or blow headgasket..  Head may be saveable, but still taking apart and putting in new gasket etc is a lot of work if you do it yourself, --and expensive if you hire somebody!<br>  <br>  Yes sealer might seek out spot and stop the leaking, - if it is not a place that it is running out under compression - the pressure from combustion tends to push sealer back out of holes!     I would also check for leakage at radiator hoses, thermostat housing, and freeze plugs (on sides of block) these  plugs sometimes rust out over time, -- generally you will see signs of water  leaking down on ground under the engine, -- these are not fun to get to sometimes,- but if the probelm they are a whole lot cheaper than pulling head off!    Sealer will sometimes do temporary plugging off of leaks (in plugs), but the plug is already pretty rusty, and soon will break out somewhere else!  If you have somebody put a "pressure checker" on cooling system (just fits in place of radiator cap), -- it may be possible to detect water running out somewhere other than into cylinders of engine!  I have also seen a few water pumps that leaked only when engine was running, - but held pressure just fine when engine stopped!   "Brains and eyeballs" are still more dependable than machines under these conditions!|`|7a5085b19b90c46573ae023bb4086356aa	Have someone take the thermostat out of the engine, if it hasn't been done already. That would keep the engine a lot cooler and would probably help the car along until it's ready to be retired.

lM9NvSwnaa	What you are seeing is oil that has been sitting in an engine that has not been run in some time.  The metals in the engine "leach out" acids when they sit without running for extended times and cause the motor oil to look almost "milk like" (or gray).  <br>  <br>  Standard motor oil 10 W 30 or 10 W 40 goes in the crank case.

EfEqtdtTaa	i had an elantra (US version of avante) and i loved it. I did seel it to get a Tiburon (coupe) because I wanted a V6. You cant expect much pick-up power because it is just a 4 cylinder, but I thought mine had decent power, that being said. I dont know much about suzukis, but I think the avante will have more options and be nicer than the sx4 considering you get more than what you pay for when buying a Hyundai. I would definately reccommend it!|`|94d1acf25e2af629b7eb957530024002aa	I believe the Avante to be a downgrade from the SX4 for sure, economy and acceleration, due to typical Korean cars being built much heavier
GAMkUH9Taa	Yes it does matter
5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	Non union ones- for shipping or any other business too I suppose.    AMO, MEBA and MMP are officer unions in the US that might hire you, but it would take awhile to get a job, and probably you'd start off as third or even AB.
InWC84mgaa	Acceptable life expectancy is 6 years. It's not worth taking a chance.|`|wpgRMjgraa	1. They are very unsafe.<br>  <br>  2. They hold air but wont support the vehicle.<br>  <br>  3. 6 to 7 year old tires are when they need to be discarded.|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	I would only use them off road at slower speeds, if they are 13 years old they are probably Bias ply, and will probably puncture fairly easily.|`|JkTGq2BJaa	if you live in a state that has state inspections they will not pass one good pothole and they could blow out.|`|efad8b1ede4a36c25f7ed32273efa609aa	I would not dare get them on the street. they are weather check and dry rotting away.|`|AA10353490	no.

GAMkUH9Taa	Bad Knock Sensor or bad wiring to sensor. there are other possible things but those are the most likely.|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	Timing problem or poor gas causing the engine to ping, for starters.|`|efad8b1ede4a36c25f7ed32273efa609aa	Well lets see here, worst case, bad engine, best case, bad gas. Over heating engine can also cause this. Look at the basics first then dive in deeper

Get a manual and take your time. Not impossible but kind of tough.
M79W3Ct9aa	the only way to get it for free is through a dealer and that's only if you're considering a car on his or her lot.  It is illegal for someone who already has an account to do a check for you so you NEED TO PAY.  If you can't then you have no business buying a vehicle.|`|JkTGq2BJaa	If you are buying a car the dealer will usually give you one if you ask him for it. If you are looking for one on a car you own you will have to pay for it.|`|4KF2cZWkaa	nothing is free.
uL5772kCaa	Get a line out converter. Any one will do. Just make sure that they have adjustable gains. They shouldnt be more than 20 bucks...|`|L0H4iVHWaa	easy<br>  <br>  get a line output converter, with this you just simply splice the wires into your current speaker wires.. you can choose your rear speakers or front speakers<br>  <br>  i recomend splicing it into your rear speakers and running an rca cable to them<br>  <br>  you can buy a line output converter at best buy for 20-25bucks and it is VERY simple to install yourself|`|kpyve2b6aa	here you go. go to the link and its a converter that you tie into your factory head units speaker wires that provide rca output.|`|ZLSDqCnsaa	You could got to best buy (kinda expensive but it was the cheapest and only place i found it) and buy an adapter that converts the signal from your two rear speakers into rca jacks.. It works in my car.. <br>  <br>  Hope I could help..|`|4KF2cZWkaa	if your really good with wires, you can splice the rc jacks into a factory speaker wire but thats the cheap way. ive done it before.|`|g3HrRmaCaa	if your going to use the stock radio u have to buy a hi low convertor
D6t6SoFRaa	Won't work...entirely different electronics.  Get one for the'97 Altima.|`|LUVBrg3Maa	You may need one for the specific year model. Newer technology doesn't always work with older products. Or you could call a nissan dealership and ask. They are expensive when purchased through the dealership though, I paid $150 to get a new fob for a 2006 Sentra from my local Nissan Dealership.
uL5772kCaa	You need two amps to run speakers and subwoofers. You can't connect your speakers to ur subwoofer amp at the same time...<br>  <br>  I suggest you turn down ur bass in the head unit so you dont distort your speakers. Or just amp ur speakers.|`|L0H4iVHWaa	well make sure everything is wired to the head unit correctly(which you prolly did wrong) you might have positive and negative switched or some wires could be crossed or touching metal somehow<br>  <br>  or it could be your speakers are disorting, its only like this when the volume is up all the way right? it could be that too your speakers are distorting because theres too many watts going to them.. you have to replace all your speakers then<br>  <br>  if i was you, i would get a new head unit thats not walmart, thats not sony cuz sony is crap<br>  <br>  get a kenwood, you can get good ones between 70-130 bucks<br>  <br>  you wont need a line out converter either which is good|`|uDuwc7Yoaa	just use passive crossovers on your speakers. there are things called bass-blockers which are just a small capacitor in some jazzy packaging. <br>  here they are packaged<br>  <a href="http://www.crutchfield.com/p_127BB150A2/Bass-Blockers-150-Hz-cut-off.html?search=crossover&searchdisplay=crossover" rel="nofollow">http://www.crutchfield.com/p_127BB150A2/...</a><br>  here they are unpackaged<br>  <a href="http://www.parts-express.com/pe/showdetl.cfm?Partnumber=020-1162" rel="nofollow">http://www.parts-express.com/pe/showdetl...</a><br>  Those will take enough bass out of your 4 regular speakers that they won't distort when you turn it up loud. hook them up at the speaker so they wont block the bass frequencies b4 the signal gets to your line-out converter for your amp. That link is the correct value for your speakers.
hfyPGF8Xaa	if they arent polyurethane bushings then yeah you got robbed, and even if they are poly bushings then you still paid about 25 too much.  the job shouldnt cost more than 200 for labor and thats a bit on the high end of the estimate, i mean, ive changed the bushings on a new civic si and they only took about 30-40  minutes per side.  so i figure a good shop could change these in less than two hours at 50 bucks an hour. but as you know shops will rip u off too.
AA10346371	You can put any engine into any vehicle provided you have the money and fabrication skills.    In this case, as this is an engine from a different manufacturer, it will be like fitting a square peg in a round hole.    As you had to ask this question in the first place, you more than likely do not have the fabrication skills or access to the fabrication tools to make this happen.  You would have to pay someone else big bucks to have it done for you.    So in your case, I would say this is not possible.|`|MEOjwPCNaa	Possible, yes. Worth it, probably not. Unless you're a skilled fabricator and have a well-equipped machine shop at your disposal, you're looking at $10,000 minimum for a shoehorn job like this. Include the cost of the car, engine, and associated parts, and the cost quickly exceeds the worth of the vehicle.    Consider that you can buy a lease-return Porsche 911 for $40-50k, which will only be 2-3 years old and comes with a warranty. You could also buy a slightly used Z06 Corvette for that price. What you're proposing is not much of a value at all.|`|mTwn8p79aa	Yup, everyone's right.  Frankly, it's a silly idea unless you're racing in a class that other cars wouldn't qualify for.  But, if that's the case, running a 6 cyl. would probably break rules anyway.    Just for the cost of the engine and the install you'd be looking at the price of some of the competition you mentioned.  With over 100Nm of additional torque you're going to reek havoc on the stock drive-train too.  The four wheel drive in that car is expensive to repair and I'd imagine extremely expensive to upgrade.|`|HTRR0NhJaa	yes it is possible but stupid, the cost of building the frame to fit that streight 6 (longitudinal settings) vs the evo's transversed setting L4 with 4wd so yea it means loosing the 4wd and just getting the rear wheel drive it is a lot of unessesary effort. if you want that 2jz engine then i will sujest to you to think about investing on a car like the 01 s2k AP1 now they will handle the engine very well and put out more power stock withe the 2jz also the s2k is a 50/50 weight distributed car ready to run.|`|a0PPw5aOaa	You are talking about modding the 2jz to get 400hp, it can actually make alot more than that, you can go 500 with stock internals. But if you want 400hp the 4g63 will do that.|`|krzYtdc9aa	Other than lag why switch the engines? The 4G63 is a great engine... I have nothing against the 2JZ (as a matter of fact I love the engine) but still there's not too many reasons for you to swap... Also wouldn't the Supra being RWD and the Evo being AWD require more fabrication and unnecessary work?|`|TjsR0nc4aa	If I recall correctly, the supra engine is longitudinal, whereas Evos are transversed.  This may make it extremely difficult and time-consuming, (not to mention horribly expensive) but not impossible.
ncwQ6IYlaa	You have more to fear from the registration fees that are piling up. those don't stop just because you don't pay them. penalties and late fees keep right on climbing. If you EVER go in to register that car again they will want ALL the fees. you can do a NON-OP registration on the car and the fees stop - but of course it is illegal to drive the car. maybe you better take the bus! Usually cops wont stop you for an expired sticker - unless they just want to hassle you. but if you do get stopped for a ticket they may give you the late reg ticket too. Its probably $100 or more.
GaLw1qMwaa	it will stay on your credit for 7yrs.    doesnt matter if you paid it off or not.   you paid it off on your terms, not their terms.    thats not how the loan business works.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	Probably not. The only reason the car wasn't physically repossessed is because you concealed it from the lender. They still have an order of repossession against you. Repossessions stay on your credit for 7 years or so.|`|hfyPGF8Xaa	even if you paid the car off, the debt was still processed and sent to a repossession office for further pursuit. this processing means that the information was put on your driving record as well as your credit record. this information will remain on your records for a total of seven years in the united states. not much you can do against the us governments tracking systems.|`|igYM91eRaa	If they never took the car it can't be considered a repo.dispute it with the credit agencies. It should only show that you were late on payments. When the bank came to repo my car and seen that is was beyond repair from a car accident they just left it. Since they did not take the vehicle they could not classify it as a repo just a bad dept.
Fr6GdIQ3aa	The number of pistons + cylinders.    V6 = six  V8 = eight  V10 = ten  V12 = twelve    But a general rule of thumb, the more cylinders the larger the engine volume and horse power + torque.|`|hfyPGF8Xaa	v6 is 6 cylinders  v8 is 8 cylinders  v10 is 10 cylinders  v12 is 12 cylinders  other than the number of cylinders and the legnth of the block, the basic inner working of all v style engines is the same.  some are cam in block style and some are over head cam style designs but these are usually determined by the manufacturer, not deemed so by the number of cylinders an engine has.|`|IF5eFYHvaa	Well the obvious answer is cylinders.  That's what those numbers mean. The engine is a "V" design meaning the cylinders are placed at an angle off of a central crankshaft.  Engines like VW (air cooled), Subaru, Porsche and some Ferrari's are Boxer designs which only means the angle between cylinders is 180 degrees. "V" designs are less than 180 degrees. But anything less than 180 is considered a "V"x engine (V4,V5,V6 etc.|`|G2qc2k26aa	the amount of cylinders in a engine.|`|WTmIfRqNaa	lol simple...V6 is k...V8 now u talking V10 beats both of V6 n V8 and V12 now u see me, now u don't.....
ndxXPie9aa	Should be able to get to it behind the glove compartment.|`|lmSoNMhPaa	if its under the hood it will be on the pasagers side.it will must likely black, and have 6 to 8 bolts holding it in.over by the corner. if it under the dash it will still be on the pass. side. it will take 15 mintues to change at most. most likely be under the hood cause or the A/C
e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	Bad idea.  The maintenance will be about 50% more for the Benz, but maintenance should only be one of the factors in your decision.       Unless you put a ton of money down when you bought it, you will lose a lot of money trading in the Edge since Ford's depreciate quickly and you have had it for less than 2 years.     The GLK starts at $40,600.  Add options and you can get well over $50K.    Combine that with the negative equity from the Edge and taxes and you are essentially doubling your car payment....and for what?  the status of having the first one on the block for another 6 months?  Not worth it.    If you are worried about being able to pay for the maintenance costs, you can't afford the Mercedes.|`|SRFfaKbCaa	WOW if you can afford to by a 2010 Mercedes-Benz GLK you shouldn't be so worried about repairs..or are you thinking of leasing? if so if you can't afford the repairs haha|`|hRrCAewyaa	Oh pleeeezzzzzzzzz...   If you can afford the Benz, you don't have to worry about repair costs.|`|LLmDQN7raa	Well la-tee-da, aren't you special, bragging about buying a new Benz, you're just so wonderful aren't you. You think you're just so much better than everyone else cuz you're buying a brand new fancy car! You're just the best in the world!    Well, yes, they are very expensive, but since apparently you have cash shooting out your *** like an ATM, I'm sure you can easily afford it. You'll be like "look at me, I'm so wonderful because I have a brand new car, and that makes me just plain better than you."|`|mTwn8p79aa	As long as you plan on selling it in the next three years, like the Edge, who cares?  It's under warranty.    After the warranty is up, Merc's are notoriously unreliable and very expensive to repair.  They also depreciate very quickly, this is probably one of only a few cars that would be smart to lease if you absolutely have to have it.|`|0TVenxJyaa	If you are concerned about costs on maintaining or repairing such a vehicle then do yourself and the Mercedes agency there a favor by sticking with your Ford|`|E7GwqMotaa	HEHEHEHEHEEHHEEHHE    if you got the money for 2010 benz you shouldn't ask about fixing money ..........    wake up from the dream :)|`|YnG0Tjxjaa	Well, if you're buying a 2010 Mercedes, I'm assuming you have decent money to fix it if it is broken. However, it is a Mercedes, so I'm going to bank on the fact it is a quality built car and you shouldn't be running into many problems with that car. Good luck. Beautiful car you're getting and congrats.
