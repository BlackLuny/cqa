20090223025051AADCd0T	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Connecting wireless router to upstairs PC without extension?	I have a problem with my Netgear DG834G wireless router. The problem is that it disconnects quite frequently everyday. It's been doing this for quite a while, but it has been doing it more frequently since last week. I've tried everything so I am assuming it's something to do with the physical connection. Basically, I have a laptop upstairs and that's the only computer in the house. It's connected to the wireless router via an ethernet cable which is also upstairs, and there is only one telephone socket in the whole house which is downstairs. A DSL filter is plugged in to the telephone socket with the phone cable in one socket, and a telephone extension cable in the other that goes all the way up the stairs into the room the laptop is in, and then connects to the back of the router into the RJ-11 port. Now, I am assuming the extension cable that's under a wardrobe and also in the gap between the door is the main cause of the problem as it is getting squeezed every time the door is opened and closed, but there is no other way of actually getting it into the room. I have a wireless PCMCIA network card that I never use for my laptop, so I was wondering whether I could use that to establish a wireless connection between the router and the laptop. But the main thing I want to try and do is get rid of the extension cable and still be able to use my laptop upstairs. Is there any way of doing this while still being able to keep the wireless router upstairs, or would I have to move the router downstairs and then use the network card?

20090223031513AA0DwJ4	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Should I go with the iMac or the Mac Pro?	I use my computer for seriously heavy media.  I have thousands of pictures and I edit them all in Photoshop Elements.  I download and watch HD videos multiple times a day.  I also run multiple applications at a time, typically Photoshop Elements, Rhapsody, iTunes, and the internet all at once.  Lastly, I play the occasional game, like The Sims 2 (or 3, soon).      So the question is, do I go iMac or Mac Pro?  I've definitely decided on a Mac desktop.  I've gone through a series of awful PCs, each one more useless than the previous.  I'm currently using an outdated 2 year old Toshiba Satellite laptop that is a piece of junk.  The thing crashed 3 months after I got it and hasn't been the same since.  After spending a hundred bucks getting it diagnosed, I was told it had bad RAM.      Anyway, any advice would be much appreciated.  Price isn't much of an issue, but I would prefer not spending an arm and a leg (obviously).      Thanks!

Q6600 is technically better but the Q8200 is new .. your opinion?

20090223034508AAnxvc4	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Bizarre problem with laptop...?	I recently bought a new laptop (acer aspire 5535), the problem is that the screen randomly goes black for no reason, but the laptop is still turned on and i have to turn it off at the button and back on again to get it to work.    The thing is, this only happens when I'm using the laptop at my house, at the weekend when I'm using it at my parents it has never happened once (have used it there 3 weekends since I got the laptop). The black screen thing seems to happen too often for this to be a coincidence, I've never used it at my house for more than 4 hours without it happening and a lot of times its only been turned on for 5 minutes. Can anyone think of any reason why this only happens at my own house??

I know that as long as I have the CD in the CD ROM Drive, I can play it, but we are actually trying to send this to my father to play, and since he doesn't have the actual audio CD, he isn't able to hear the music.

I have it saved to itunes and windows media player, but when I try to "Add Sound from File," I can't seem to locate the songs!      If you have any advice, please let me know. Her funeral is on Tuesday and my dad is freaking out because he really wants this done asap. Thank you in advance!

I found the correct page, and I can select the choices that I was for embedding and video responses, but I can't find the "save button" which I've been told should be at both the top and bottom of the page. They are not there. So I can't save my selections, and when I navigate away from the page obviously they revert back to the original settings.       Why wouldn't they appear for me? And what can I do to get them back? It's a very odd question, but I'm hoping someone will be able to help me.       Thanks in advance.

Okay so im tryna download this torrent but its unusual instead of having 1 big file it has 13 small 14mb components. The first 1 says "part01.rar". If i download the file in this format can you watch each part individually. Since the files are probably in avi format if i add them all into windows movie maker in order. And then publish the movie it should come out as 1 complete file right?      So if i download the file in this format can i watch each part seperatly like part01 the part02. And if i can, can i use windows movie maker to make it a complete file?      Thanks

I need to look for this "255.255.255.255", and then replace it with the user newly inserted IP...      I know there is something called seekp(), but it needs me to determine where to point in the file. I do not know yet. Once i find the spot 255.255... I will have to write from the iso::beg, right?      1. I can go through the file line by line by using getline()...Is there another solution?      2. Assume i went through the file & i found 255.255.255.255, to overwrite it do i t have to start from 2, or before 2? I guess ios::beg has to be involved in someway.      Any idea?

I compare the manage site data and the file data and it all seems fine. But it is not.      When I preview the site in DW it looks just like I want it to. This is a simple one page site at this time. A little text and one jpeg and a contact us      I connect to the server and my files are uploaded. Everything looks groovy.      I type the web address and all I see is the generic Index of followed by parent directory and then all my files. If I click on my index.php the page I created pops up. It looks like I intend it to. The email button works      How do I get this so I am not on this generic index and my index is the primary?

So is it possible to just totally disable swap in XP Home, or can you only reduce its use?  (Adding more memory isn't an option in this case.)

I know that later microchips had more transistors that earlier ones and that made them superior. What materials were used to make these microchips better? How were they implemented? I would like some input and some sources to back up your claims. I just want to learn more about Intel microchips and at the moment, the internet is not giving me much.       Thank you.

I know that I most likely don't need a router with a very large range because her house is so small, but I still want one that is good quality, but one not so expensive that when I do leave it at her house I am not leaving $50+ dollars behind.  I'm thinking I need a wireless N router but I am not sure. Any ideas and feedback would be great!!

20090223073324AAdaGFe	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Monitors	What's wrong with my monitor? Blank screen/Green light?	I've owned an Acer X221W flat screen monitor for about a year and a half now, up until 2 days ago it's worked perfectly fine. I got home and started up the PC only to have the screen go blank within seconds after seeing "Windows XP is loading". I Turned off the screen and turned it back on, after clicking the login icon the screen again goes blank. I can hear everything starting up like it normally would, just no picture. Turning the monitor off and on again seemed to bring back the picture for only about 5 seconds, then went back to a blank screen. The entire time, the green light stayed lit and everything over than visibility was business as usual. Attempting to Google the problem while constantly turning it off and on caused a Buzz sound followed by the monitor returning to life. Fearing my troubles weren't over, I went to Acer's website to try and troubleshoot the problem( shrunklink.com/bssa ). About an hour into it's use I heard the buzz sound again and the screen went blank, I turned the monitor off and back on and it repeated what I had done earlier, buzz sound>stays on.   I don't wanna have to spend money on a new one if it's not the monitor at fault, I suspected a loose connection at first but everything seemed to  check clear.       PLEASE HELP ME!

On XP, you type "shutdown -s -t 28800 (or whatever seconds you want)" in cmd.exe, you set up auto-shutdown to happen after 8 hours.      But in Crappy Vista, not only the command totally changed(to "shutdown /s /t) but also, all of a sudden, the system only supports up to 600 seconds waiting period for a auto-shutdown. that being said, if I wanna set up the computer to shutdown itself in 8 hours, well, THAT CAN'T HAPPEN IN GARBAGE VISTA, since the system only supports UP TO 10 MINS SYSTEM WAITING PERIOD.      Does anybody know how to set up computer to auto shut down in more than 10 mins in windows garbage vista?      thank you.

My laptop is getting to that point where I either need to get $300 in replacements & upgrades, or get a whole new computer. I am leaning toward just spending $500 - $600 on a new computer.       The last two computers I got were Dells and I gotta say - this only lasting for about 2 years each thing is a bit disappointing. So I want to see what others have to say.      By the way, at a minimum I will need 2GB of ram,15.4 inch screen, 1680x1050 resolution (wxga+ ?), and a 120GB hard drive. I am assuming that nowadays, a decent processor & graphics card go without saying.       I also really like my XP Media Center. But I can handle XP home or XP pro. ... And I have a home CD @ my house, so it isn't totally necessary that my new laptop come preloaded with it.

Basically, I have data measured each hour of each day of april for 1998-2001 and I need to find the total number of hours covered in this so I can take the mean of the data.       I know that there are soooo many basic formulas I could use to figure this out normally and through logic but unfortunately this is part of a project for my class and I need to assume that the table is sufficiently large so that I can't do any manual counting or computation, so I must use the spreadsheet capabilities of excel only.       I have been playing around with the various date functions and formatting of excel to no avail for hours and would appreciate any and all help on this matter and would definitely give a good answer a nice 10 points.

20090223041619AAeqWzT	Computers & Internet;Software	How do I dual boot Mac (Leopard 10.5.6) and Ubuntu (Intrepid 8.10)?	(I'll try to remember what I did when I attempted to install Ubuntu) I followed the following video  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hORXsK7jP...  I also used rEFIt. The situation I'm having is that after I select the partition I created specially for Ubuntu had a different listing from what was said in the video (Ext3) and right after that I was prompted to swap a partition. (This is when I left the installation process)      Should I swap anything or ignore it and continue installation of Ubuntu? I'd like to know what to do before I do anything else so I'd appreciate if I receive some sort of confirmation as soon as possible.      Thanks!

Basically I had a "TS16GJFV10"(16Gb) and lent it to a Friend, then my Friend tells me when put the drive in it kept messing up(i don't know) changing from 6 gbs to 4gbs to 2 gbs.      And before this happened its was a perfect 16gb which was use able      My Question is, is it possible that a USB that can be damaged enough that it can degrade it self.      And, Is it possible to repair it so it can revert back to its 16 gb state      I have no idea what my Friend has been doing to it.      When i go into properties to look at the space left its says 2gbs.   And when i go into properties and clicked on the hardware tab it calls the flash drive a "TS2GJFV30"(2Gb)"       yes, im 100% sure the computer is calling the "16gb" flash drive a "TS2GJFV30"(2Gb)

20090223051058AAnrclD	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	What's the best all in one programme for compressing and adding menus to a downloaded TV series?	Hi,       I have downloaded several episodes of a tv series (Legally I might add), and would ideally like to put them onto a single DVD with a menu so that I can watch on a separate DVD player.       The episodes are all in .AVI format, and are around 250MB each. I have converted them using DivxtoDVD, and can burn several seperately to a DVD using IMG Burn ( A process which usually works fine for movies), but the episodes just play back to back and I'd really like to have a menu to make selections from.       Any advice would be appreciated.       Many thanks      Simon

20090223071212AAvO5SQ	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Should i be worried about this?	hey everyone i suffer from OCD/anxiety and i have been worried sick for the past 11 months because while moving i threw out my old 40gb laptop hard drive without thinking..and have read alot about idenity theft and it just scared me sending me into a complete obsession over my personal information being found and someone finding out everything about me, even though eveything was deleted from the drive, i know things can still be recovered ..after 11 months odds are it has been destroyed right? i would have known by now if anyone had found it. Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?      I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..       I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.      I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.      Should i seek therapy? I have already checked my credit report and what not, but i always seem to just tell myself it just hasnt happened YET

A) Every method must have a precondition or it will not compile.     B) Including a precondition makes a method more efficient.     C) Including the precondition ensures that if, when the method is called, variable N is not greater than0, it will be set to 1 so that the precondition is satisfied.     D) Including the precondition provides information to users of the method, specifying what is expect to be true whenever the method is called.        This is an example of botom-up design.  The precondition is included to permit the method to be tested and debugged in isolation from the rest of the program.
