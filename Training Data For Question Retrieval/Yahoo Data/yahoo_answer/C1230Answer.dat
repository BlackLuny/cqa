8QKwz7W7aa	Asteroids within the Asteroid Belt are presumed to be the remnants of matter that did not clump during the formation of the solar system. Even if the materials did collide, the gravity from Jupiter pulled them apart from each other. Composed of rock, dust, and metal, the early asteroids were formed when the heavy metal within them sunk to the center of the rock, forming a metal core. Over time, the lighter rocks formed layers around the core. The rock would then cool steadily, eventually becoming a solid.<br>  <br>  The same mechanism probably also happens with another "Asteroid Belt" just outside the orbit of Neptune, the "Kuiper Belt". Neptune's gravity may have disabled the possibility of large object in the Kuiper Belt to clump into a planet. That's why Pluto (which is not a planet anymore) is also surrounded by millions of tiny objects, much like Ceres in the asteroid belt.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	No, because Jupiter's massive gravitational field controls (or at least influences) the asteroid belt objects.<br>  Its hard to explain in this forum, but Jupiter keeps the asteroids from clumping together in one area.<br>  <br>  In fact, it is theorized that the asteroid belt would have formed a planet (though a small one, since the total mass of the asteroid belt is less than the moon) if Jupiter hadn't been so close.|`|XiMQLv8Oaa	They'd been there, for who-knows-how-long. And if something has to happen, it could have happened already.<br>  <br>  It was generally the view of people that the planet Jupiter, due to its massiveness has something to do with these objects' not getting into a union of their own. Poor Jupe who has to get the blame for the separation!  I beg to differ from that view. <br>  <br>   There is another group of scattered fragments that litter the space just about the orbit of Neptune and extends way out to extra-solar space, beyond the orbit of Pluto. So, Pluto or Neptune gets the blame for their not forming into a planetoid or something?  I think we have to reconsider these views.<br>  <br>  Planets may influence another object in orbit by making perturbations on each other's orbital path. Another influence may be manifested by a bigger object on a smaller one by "capturing" the smaller object and making it its satellite. This might have been the case with our moon. And if the masses are identical, they would both orbit each other as do "binary stars."  And the extreme scenario would be such when the smaller object falls into the bigger object. <br>  <br>  Yet, none of these has happened to the asteroids in the Asteroid belt.  And the assumption that they were remnants of a disintegrated planet, is very highly probable. For each of them are still spinning on an axis, as the other planets do. And they have still their own definite orbit, wherein they might have orbitted once upon a time while still in planetary oneness.

N0UUmjDlaa	Number 1 would be the best scenario. If you distribute the weight such that it is equal on both axles but spread widely as in 2, "Force- times- distance" (torque) has to be increased to overcome the need to begin shifting the mass (rotating it about the centre, i.e. turning the car).<br>  If ALL the weight were exactly at the centre point of the 2 axles, that would be ideal, as no torque would need to be generated to rotate the mass. However, that's an impossibility. Best fit is central mass location.|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	1 is better, but only marginally. Statically, the weight distribution is the same for the two cases. But under acceleration or braking or on hills the weight shift from 2 will be more than it would be from 1, moving the center of gravity from it's ideal position.<br>  <br>  re cornering, you say nothing about L-R weight distribution for the two cases, so i can't comment on that.<br>  <br>  .|`|r2bbLMUZaa	For cornering, both of these would work out equally.<br>  <br>  This is because grip is determined by the amount of strain the wheels can take without coming unglued from the road, and this factor is determined by the weight on the axles.<br>  <br>  More weight on the front axle will cause oversteer, because the back will spin out, and more weight on the back will create understeer, because the front wheels will unglue easier.<br>  <br>  However, a mid-weighted car will be easier to brake, because it's weight shifts much less to the front, while a spread-weighted car will accelerate faster because more weight is transfered to the back.

d5Z21bnVaa	Of the worms, the Platyhelminthes ("flat worms") are considered the prototypes, having developed such innovations as bilateral symmetry, a head, tail, and three germinal tissue layers (stinging celled animals, comb-jellies... only have two). These simple soft-bodied animals use their skin to breath through and only have one body opening, the mouth serving also as an anus. <br>  <br>      The Flatworm Phylum includes two groups of well-known parasitic species; the Tapeworms (Class Cestoda) and Flukes (Class Trematoda). These are important species to humans directly and indirectly through their negative interactions with food and ornamental animal life, including fishes. There are many species of both cestodes and trematodes that live on/in fishes and their gill cavities. Fortunately, due to complex life histories and careful quarantine, dips/baths, most aquarists don't come in contact with these parasitic forms. <br>  <br>      The free-living (i.e. non-parasitic) species of Flatworms, the Class Turbellaria are more of note...

If not, it is the acronym for the order you do the equation in.<br>  Brackets<br>  Exponents<br>  Division<br>  Multiplication<br>  Addition<br>  Subtraction<br>  (the division and multiplication don't have to go in that order. for those questions, you just do whichever one comes first. the same goes for addition and subtraction. do whichever one comes in the equation first but division and multiplication ALWAYS come before addition and subtraction.)<br>  <br>  and you know the rules for negative signs.<br>  Negative times negative = positive<br>  Negative times positive = negative<br>  Positive times negative = negative<br>  Positive times positive = positive<br>  <br>  So what you do is for number one:<br>  1. You do multiply the things that are in brackets first so multiply (-3) by (-6) and multiply (4) and (-2). So the answer would be:<br>  18 + 8. Which equals 26.<br>  <br>  2. First do the exponent so in easier terms: (-3) x (-3) x (-3) which equals -27. So you equation would then be (-27)-(-8)(-2). So before you subtract (-8) from (-27), you have to multiply (-8) by (-2) which equals 16. So now you subtract: (-27) - 16 which equals: (-11)<br>  <br>  3. Yay! Last one! First exponents again. So (-9) x (-9) - (-6) x (-6). So, (-9) times (-9) equals 81. and (-6) times (-6) equals 36. So easy now: 81 - 36 which equals 45.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|AA10686659	1.

gCn6bXAFaa	Only honey bees produce propolis.|`|AA10854273	Propolis – The Other Healthy Gift From Bees<br>  Propolis is the forgotten health product produced by bees, but like honey which has been undergoing a resurgence, research efforts are leading to a re-discovery of its natural health benefits.<br>  Honeybees really are amazing animals. Apart from providing a vital role in much of our food supply through their help with pollination, they also provide us with fantastic, natural, healthy bee products. When thinking of bees, for most people it is honey that comes to mind.<br>  <br>  Over the past few years honey has been regaining its reputation for its naturally healthy qualities. Helped by more research effort, this has been particularly led by the unique healing properties, proven by proper research, found in some batches of active manuka honey.<br>  <br>  Bees do produce another product, that they make use of themselves, which makes a great natural remedy – propolis. Propolis is a resin type substance, produced mainly from bees collecting tree sap, mixed with some pollen. It has antibiotic properties due to its content of biologically active flavonoids.<br>  <br>  The source of your propolis is important, as its actual content varies by location, based on just what the bees in each area have available to them.<br>  <br>  Natural medicine practitioners have commonly used propolis for the relief of various conditions, including inflammations, viral diseases, ulcers, superficial burns and scalds. It can also help with some fungal infections.<br>  <br>  It is an old beekeepers trick to use a piece of propolis in the mouth as a remedy for a sore throat. This is now one of the common uses propolis products are aimed at, the winter ills such as sore throats, coughs and colds. You can of course now get a rather more pleasant tasting honey and propolis lozenge (or other flabour) to help with your sore throat.<br>  <br>  Some people who are sensitive to bee products do need to take care, as it may cause allergic reactions in them. Similar to the situation with many natural remedies, much of the evidence supporting it is still anecdotal. But with a growing number of scientific research studies underway around the world, a better understanding of propolis and what it can help with is occurring.<br>  <br>  A significant difficulty in getting good scientific evidence for any natural remedy such as porpolis is again the fact they naturally vary in composition and potency. Being produced by mother nature, and not to a set standard in a laboratory creates obstacles to getting consistent results.<br>  <br>  Taking a step towards dealing with this, and having a standard for measuring potency, New Zealand’s leading health bee products company Comvita has come up with a test and standard for their New Zealand sourced propolis tinctures and extracts. Comvita’s ‘PFL’ standard is a measure of Propolis Flavonoid Levels. An independent laboratory is used to have each batch of propolis certified. You then have information on the potency of their propolis products.<br>  <br>  Of course there is a wider range of options of propolis remedies. You can get combinations with honey, propolis soaps, and even propolis in a toothpaste.

8Y7LQ6TGaa	yes, you can wire them up in parallel, the capacitance adds. They must all be 50 volts or more, so you cannot use the 25 volt caps.<br>  <br>  In theory you can put them in series to increase the voltage rating, eg, two of the caps you have in series would make a 600uF 50 volt cap. But that is in theory. In practice that doesn't work, as the voltage across the caps will not share evenly, and one will be over voltage and burnout.<br>  <br>  <br>  Although if you were desperate, and had power to spare, you could put a 27k resistor across each cap, then put two in series to get 600uF 50 volt, with the resistors equalizing the voltage. then two of those in parallel, total 4 caps, to get to 1200uF 500 volts.  Check that the voltage is actually divided in half for each cap. If not, decrease the size of the resistors.<br>  <br>  .

AA10164889	Abram, get this straight and don't be foolish about it any more, okay?  The basic technology required for a manned flight to the moon was developed in Germany in the late 1930s through the mid 1940s.  This technology needed a lot of refinement to make a safe manned flight a reality.<br>  <br>  We worked on that technology through the 1950s and 60s, and made the first manned moon flight in 1969.  It all fits together, and if you read all the history and don't let the wackos lie to you, it will be impossible for you to continue to be fooled into believing that the moon missions did not take place.<br>  <br>  The American people were much better educated and more intelligent in the 1960s and 70s than they are now, and it would never have occurred to NASA engineers and managers that 35 years later a bunch of ignorant dolts with nothing to do would come up with a stupid conspiracy theory stating that the moon landings were faked.<br>  <br>  If that had occurred to them, I suspect the engineers would have gone to the trouble to create a larger and more visible object of proof, to compensate for the decline in the quality of the American mind and its education that occurred during and after the Reagan presidency.<br>  <br>  But there is a real physical proof available.  The astronauts who landed on the moon left behind reflectors that are used every day by astronomers to measure the irregularities of the moon's orbit.  This is done by bouncing laser beams off reflectors at known locations that were left by the astronauts.  Ask your science teacher for information about these experiments.  You can arrange to see this done with your own eyes.<br>  <br>  Let me put the question to you this way:  If you think the moon landings were faked, when did they become "fake?"  When did the idea become popular that NASA had invented the idea of an imaginary moon mission and created a huge technological empire to fool people?  When was all this fakery done?  In the 60s? 70s? 80s?<br>  <br>  And why?  What was the point?  And how did they fool all the people that reported the news, operated the machinery, built the moon rockets, and watched them take off and land?<br>  <br>  Do you realize that one American in 500 was a part of the Apollo program?

Zz6LjFmMaa	Nothing really.  The base pairs used for genes are called exons, while those not encoding genes are called introns.  After transcription from DNA to pre-mRNA, all the introns are spliced out to give us our mature mRNA that can then be translated to make proteins.<br>  <br>  Having only ~4% of DNA being used for genes, it greatly decreases the chance of getting a mutation in a gene necessary for humans.  If we had a higher percent of DNA being used for genes, the number of mutations in our genes would also increase, giving us undesirable results.

Hence both U1 and U2 contain the 0 vector, and that implies their intersection contains the 0 vector.<br>  <br>  Let: A, B be an arbitrary vectors such that, A is in the intersection of U1 and U2, and B is in the intersection of U1 and U2.<br>  <br>  By definition of intersection, then A in U1.

A is in U2, and A + B must also be in U2, again by the requirements that U2 is a subspace.  I have shown that A + B is in U1, and A + B is in U2, and hence A + B is in the intersection of U1 and U2.  I have proven that the intersection of U1 and U2 is closed under vector addition.<br>  <br>  Now, i need to prove for any scalar c in a Field, cA is closed under scalar multiplication, i.e. if A is in the intersection of U1 and U2, cA must be in the intersection of U1 and U2.<br>  <br>  Let A be in the intersection of U1 and U2, then A is U1.  When you multiply A by c, i.e. cA, then cA must be in U1, since U1 is a subspace.  Since A is in the intersection of U1 and U2, A is in U2.  Multiplying A by c, must result in cA being in U2, since U2 is a subspace.  I have shown that cA is in U1, and cA is in U2.  Thus i have shown cA is in the intersection of U1 and U2, i.e. the intersection of U1 and U2 is closed under scalar multiplication for any vector in the intersection of U1 and U2.<br>  <br>  Showing that the intersection of U1 and U2 is closed under addition, and closed under scalar multiplicatoin, has proven the fact that the intersection of U1 and U2 is a subspace.|`|TqiMnCv6aa	What needs to be proven to make U1 int.

FQvoUtwDaa	Bob: I see that you're taking both Vicodin and Tylenol. Depending on which Vicodin you're taking, it could contain anywhere from 500mg up to 750mg of Tylenol in it already. *Please* make sure you're not taking over 4,000mg of Tylenol each day together with the Tylenol and the Vicodin. If you are taking more than 4,000mg/day of Tylenol, this can lead to major problems with your liver later on. If you're taking it for sleep, why not just take Benadryl as it contains the same active ingredient that is causing the drowsiness as Tylenol PM. <br>  <br>  Jenny: Yes, there are potential negative effects of zolpidem. There is a less than 1% chance that it will cause complex sleep-related behavior such as sleep-walking and things like that. There is a 1-10% chance that it will cause things like hallucinations, mood swings, and things like that. If you feel the risks outweigh the benefits, then don't take it. Whatever you decide, it is not recommended that you take zolpidem for long-term use. If you are needing it for more than a couple weeks, you should talk to your doctor about possibly prescribing something else.

In other words it will reach 0.9999999999......... but won't ever get to 1.|`|AA10927246	I assume that you meant that you continue taking the square root of the number.  .9 = 9/10    Taking the square root you have:  (9/10)^(1/2)    That's 9^(1/2)/(9+1)^(1/2)    If you take another square root it is:  9^(1/4) / (9+1)^(1/4)  etc.    Basically if you take the limit, as n goes to infinity of:  9^(1/2^n) / (9+1)^(1/2^n)  You'll find this approaches 1.    The limit is 1.  It will never reach 1 and it will definitely never exceed 1.    To prove this, let's take the opposite assumption.  Let's say that you do reach a point where you get to 1.  That means you would have something where  1^n = 0.9    But 1 to any power can never be 0.9, it's always 1.  Similarly if you thought it could exceed 1, then you'd have something that would exceed 1 when squared multiply times.  It would never go down and reach 0.9.    Answer:  The limit as n -->  is 1.  It will never reach, nor will it exceed 1.|`|Oy5kkxrxaa	If you keep taking the square root it will approach 1 but never reach it.    If you keep squaring a number between 0 and 1 it will approach 0

It just needed revision.  Newton was mostly right about gravity, just not in certain cases he had no knowledge of.  We still use Newtonian theory for most things.  Big bang theory has gone under revision, but the basic idea is still the same - singularity that expanded - because the original evidence is still there, the expanding and cooling universe.  Theories will always be revised as more evidence emerges, but that doesn't mean they were 'false' before that - just less complete.|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	The Big Bang theory for example. What you today call Big Bang theory, is not the original, but more something like the 8th revision of it. Many predictions of it failed, and had to be improved. For example, the Big Bang theory had not been able to explain, why we can see light from 13.6 billion light years away.|`|hF8WGq4Baa	Most primitive theories turn out to be incomplete or wrong. "Primitive" in this case only means "early". Two good examples were already mentioned (the original iteration of the Big Bang theory and Steady State theory). By the way, the name "Big Bang" was originally used as a criticism of the theory, a way of making fun of it. Now it's the accepted name. :)    Another that comes to mind is the idea of epicycles to explain planetary motion as seen from Earth. Long ago, planetary retrograde motion was explained by a model that had planets on tiny orbits within their larger orbit (around the Earth, of course!). Once it was shown that the Sun was the center of our solar system, not the Earth, epicycles were discredited and discarded.    For the most part, epicycles explained and predicted retrograde motion of the planets. When it didn't predict things correctly, it was simply thought that the timing wasn't recorded correctly.     It was also once thought that the orbits of the planets around the sun were circular. It explained observations relatively well but there were problems. More observation and calculations showed that the orbits were slightly elliptical. This explained and predicted things MUCH better. Once all of the mathematics of the orbits was worked out, it explained the orbits perfectly. The mathematics and physics are understood so well that we now routinely send spacecraft to other planets and have the 2 rondezvous months or years after leaving Earth. That takes A LOT of precision.

This is due to nucleophiles being attracted to positive centres.(nucleo=positive, phile=loving)    Therefore the larger the negative charge the stronger the attraction to the positive centre will be and the better the nucleophile it will be.    As alkoxide ions only have a -1 charge and the sulfide ion has -2 the sulfide will have a stronger attraction to a positive centre and therefore it is a better nucleophile.    ~hope it helps|`|c30e2cd4342816ffab5be22eb14c292caa	2- charge on sulphide.

Y32zA5Mfaa	I answered a similar question a couple months ago.  Here's my answer again.  It still applies :).    In my multiple biology courses I have taken, this is a common topic of discussion. The general consensus seems to be that viruses are not alive, because even though they have genetic material, they cannot multiply by themselves. They have to use a host's body in order to do so. And this is different from parasites because parasites only have to rely on a host in order to survive. They can multiply all by themselves (by multiplying, I mean copying their genetic material using their own mechanisms, rather than relying on the host's mechanisms).    One quick interesting thought just for fun (since it comes up in discussions about life too). Think about fire. By many definitions of 'alive', it qualifies! Needs energy to thrive (both fuel and oxygen), can multiply by itself, etc. I know it is not alive. It's just a fun thought!|`|NIb8zWEHaa	virus display the living organisms feature only inside their host otherwise they are simply particle|`|8cDd70dSaa	It's not a theory; it is a fact that viruses are not living things. They are not made up of cells, they are simply a collection of RNA encased in a protein housing. They require a living host to grow and reproduce; they cannot do so otherwise. This proves that they are not living.|`|WVPYem5Vaa	Viruses blur the line between living and non-living.    There are seven characteristics that are seen as typical of living beings.    1/ Sensitivity. Viruses display this in that they sometimes sense when cells are nearby.    2/ Breathing. Viruses have no need to breathe anything.    3/ Movement. Viruses do not move by themselves, but they float around.    4/ Growth. Viruses do not grow once they have developed inside the host cell.    5/ Feeding. Viruses require no nourishment.    6/ Excretion. Viruses do not excrete.    7/ Reproduction. Viruses can only reproduce inside a host cell.    This gives 3 arguments against, 2 for, and 2 maybe living.    Also, the answer to the question is most likely cytoplasm.|`|iBditO5Kaa	One of the prerequisites for being classified as 'living' as agreed upon by biologists worldwide is that the organism must contain both RNA and DNA. Viruses only contain one or the other, and not both, and therefore are not alive.

To find this, you must first find the Mr (relative molecular mass) of butane.  This is the sum of all the atomic weights:    Carbon (12)     x 4  Hydrogen (1)   x 10    Mr = (12x4) + (1x10) = 58 g mol^(-1)    (grams per mole)    Moles = Mass/Mr = 3.50/58 = 0.0603 moles    To find out the number of molecules, we must use Avgadro's constant (6.022 x 10^23).  This is the number of molecules in one mole.    Number of molecules = Number of moles x Avogadros constant                            = 0.0603 x 6.022 x 10^23                            =3.63 x 10^22 molecules    As there are 4 carbon atoms in each molecule of butane, there must be (4 x the number of molecules) carbon atoms    4 x 3.63 x10^22 = 1.45 x 10^23
aYwXSyyzaa	The digestive system includes the digestive tract and its accessory organs, which process food into molecules that can be absorbed and utilized by the cells of the body. Food is broken down, bit by bit, until the molecules are small enough to be absorbed and the waste products are eliminated. The digestive tract, also called the alimentary canal or gastrointestinal (GI) tract, consists of a long continuous tube that extends from the mouth to the anus. It includes the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. The tongue and teeth are accessory structures located in the mouth. The salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, and    pancreas are major accessory organs that have a role in digestion. These organs secrete fluids into the digestive tract.     Food undergoes three types of processes in the body:     Digestion   Absorption   Elimination   Digestion and absorption occur in the digestive tract. After the nutrients are absorbed, they are available to all cells in the body and are utilized by the body cells in metabolism.     The digestive system prepares nutrients for utilization by body cells through six activities, or functions.    Ingestion  The first activity of the digestive system is to take in food through the mouth. This process, called ingestion, has to take place before anything else can happen.     Mechanical Digestion  The large pieces of food that are ingested have to be broken into smaller particles that can be acted upon by various enzymes. This is mechanical digestion, which begins in the mouth with chewing or mastication and continues with churning and mixing actions in the stomach.      Chemical Digestion   The complex molecules of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are transformed by chemical digestion into smaller molecules that can be absorbed and utilized by the cells. Chemical digestion, through a process called hydrolysis, uses water and digestive enzymes to break down the complex molecules. Digestive enzymes speed up the hydrolysis process, which is otherwise very slow.          Movements  After ingestion and mastication, the food particles move from the mouth into the pharynx, then into the esophagus. This movement is deglutition, or swallowing. Mixing movements occur in the stomach as a result of smooth muscle contraction. These repetitive contractions usually occur in small segments of the digestive tract and mix the food particles with enzymes and other fluids. The movements that propel the food particles through the digestive tract are called peristalsis. These are rhythmic waves of contractions that move the food particles through the various regions in which mechanical and chemical digestion takes place.     Absorption  The simple molecules that result from chemical digestion pass through cell membranes of the lining in the small intestine into the blood or lymph capillaries. This process is called absorption.     Elimination  The food molecules that cannot be digested or absorbed need to be eliminated from the body. The removal of indigestible wastes in the form of feces, is defecation or elimination.    ALL THE BEST

AA11513203	You are comparing apples and oranges.    First, I have never heard Biology 101 say that "life begets life" ... that word 'begets' is a Biblical word ... so I'm guessing you're getting your "Biology 101" information from a Creationist textbook or web site.    But you are probably referring to the law of biogenesis by Pasteur and Redi.   This says only that *MODERN* life forms cannot spring from non-living matter.   I.e. fruit flies do not spring from rotting fruit (but from fly eggs laid in the fruit) ... and rats do not spring from dirty rags (but from rats nests built in the rags).       Secondly, you are  completely wrong about evolution if you think that it conveys that "life began out of nothingness".   Evolution says NOTHING OF THE SORT.   Evolution is not about how life *began*.   Evolution is about how life *CHANGES* from previous life ... and thus it is absolutely compatible with the law of biogenesis.    So you are probably not thinking about evolution, but about *abiogenesis* ... the origins of life from non-life.   And even that does not violate the law of biogenesis because it does not claim that *modern* life forms as is, as is, from non-living matter.   But instead, *primitive* pre-cellular life, emerged over a *billion* years, out of organic materials.   That is completely, utterly different.    The only thing that violates the Biology 101 lesson that "modern life forms cannot emerge, as is, from non-living matter" would be Creationism.    So it is hypocritical to use "Biology 101" to refute "evolution", unless you are willing to apply that same logic to your own theory.|`|AA11564934	If biology 101 is remembered correctly, it says no such thing.|`|NIb8zWEHaa	read about oparin theory|`|AA11828439	Evolution theory conveys nothing of the kind.|`|pa7hVLAHaa	Response to Michelle Z...

But that statement if true in your mind would also apply to a creator who had to be created .Anyway...evolution does not address how life began but rather after it began it followed an evolutionary natural selection process. A creator per se..and evolution are not necessarily incompatible   BUT...BUT....evolution is the only scientifically based theory on the development of animal diversity since creationism must have participation of a supernatural entity which is not science as science is defined as a body of knowledge based on experiment, modeling, and observation of natural phenomena . If this is not held as the standard then any pseudoscience or mysticism could hold sway for scientific inquiry..from tarot card reading to ouija boards, tea leaf reading, astrology, necromancy, voodoo, shamanism, etc etc . Read the Dover decision and see how a conservative judge appointed by Bush showed how creationism and ID are not science and are generally nothing more that Biblical interpretation attempting to circumvent well-established scientific evidence from a multitude of sources. You would do well to expand your reading lists to include well refereed scientific books and monographs on evolution. Many people who oppose evolution do it on the basis of personal incredulity......that is not a legitimate argument.....put their "facts " to the test..if they have them...which by the classic "dragon in my garage " ploy...they never seem to have ..or they almost have..etc etc .|`|5d3f9fa6ccab4472bef9d88570b1af0caa	chemistry is the central science.  There have always been compounds around that could potentially produce life.  Some may argue that chemistry is the foundation for life itself and without it there would be no life. No anything.

Just a lack of structure to the chaos|`|X4UAMHhRaa	out of nothingness?  you mean how did organic compounds form from inorganic molecules in a chemical soup? refer back to your chemistry and see that this is possible.|`|AA11247202	We're still working on it, but two very promising have given us some clues. In Miller's classic experiment (and may I say the longest running-science experiment in history) a warm "soup" of oxygen, nitrogen, and simple hydrocarbons (which were definitively found in ancient Earth's atmosphere and are found in planets such as Venus and Mars) where left heated up and routinely shocked for long periods of time, some left as long as 56 years. The result? Several amino acids and more importantly RNA nitrogenous bases, the same ones your body uses to build proteins and bacteria use to reproduce. A second experiment also by Miller attempted to prove a completely opposite idea by freezing an ammonia-cyanide mixture (both also common in ancient Earth). The bubbles within the freezing mixture caused microscopic ultra pressured chambers for chemical reactions which caused everything from amines, nucleic acid bases, and amino acids.     This experiments combined with observation of unicellular organisms such as bacteria make it clear the first cells used asexual reproduction through a rudimentary chain of RNA. Perhaps they were no more than a chain of RNA that routinely got joined and divided due to the nucleotides' ability to form double and triple hydrogen bonds,  until this process yielded something slightly more advanced. And that's how evolution got started.|`|CCeRdaoLaa	It's a common misconception that the abiogenesis hypothesis states that "life came from nothing."  It definitely came from something, it's just that that something is different from life as we know it today.  A similar idea holds true for the Big Bang (it's not evolution, I know, but evolution-deniers love to lump it in there too) - it's not that the Big Bang gave rise to the universe out of nothingness, but rather gave rise to the universe from something very different from what we know now.    The primordial oceans were much different from our oceans today.  They were full of chemicals and regularly heated from volcanic activity and lightning strikes.  They were a soup full of chemical reactions.  When you think about it, simple life can be expressed as a series of chemical reactions, and complex life is just an elaboration on simple life.    Abiogenesis is sometimes (mistakenly) explained as life popping into existence from a bunch of chemicals.  It would have been orders of magnitude less complex than even the simplest modern bacteria.  In fact, the first life probably wasn't all that much different from the chemical reactions happening everywhere, so the transition from "chemical reaction" to "life" wouldn't have been a clear-cut moment.|`|qq5nceCXaa	Because evolution just looks at the conditions after the first self replicating structure (be that DNA, RNA or whatever) came into being.    Remember though that you are just one big chemical factory.  Life is just a series of chemical reactions, and all you need is a pathway and conditions that something self replicating with small variation can arise.

For instance, reptiles and aves (birds) have a common ancestor, but aves are a group of their own and not included in the class reptilia, so reptiles are paraphyletic.

However, bromine will react in cold and obscurity only with cyclohexene. If you want cyclohexane reacts too, it will require high temperature or an intense source of light. And both substance are almost the same, they have only a slight difference.|`|nMWTrSHraa	A substance will dissolve in liquid or react in a liquid by seeing<br>  1)if it's polar or not<br>  2)if it's ionic compound or not because only ionic compounds react easily<br>  3)if it's a metal then where is it's position in metal activity series..if it is at top then it will react vigorously as in the case of sodium(Na).

Or it tells you that 1 g of H2 would require 8g of O2 to make 9 grams water.(divide 4,32, &36 each by 4)<br>  You can readily see that you must have 8 times as much O2 than H2.     All you have is 2 g of O2  The amount of H2 that will react with 2.0g O2 will be 2/8 = 1/4 = 0.25 g<br>   Starting with 6 g H2 when only 0.25 will react leaves you with 5.75 g left over that does nothing.  The most water you can make( theoretical yield) is 2 + 0.25 or 2.025 g.    You did not get that much - you got 1.4 g<br>  The per cent yield will be 1.4/2.025 X100 = 69.1 %<br>  Note: since H2 will be left over, O2 is your limiting reagent.

Imagine the sources of error in finding the slope of the tangent line:<br>  <br>  Getting the proper angle, especially if the curvature is small.<br>  Measuring the x? and ?y on the tangent to get the slope ?y/?x.<br>  <br>  In effect, when you are drawing a tangent, you are doing "graphical" calculus.<br>  <br>  And then, what if you need an expression that gives you velocity vs time?  Even if you drew several tangents, plotted their slopes to get a velocity curve, you may not be able to find a mathematical formula for that.<br>  <br>  Similarly, you could argue that you don't need calculus to determine distance traveled under variable velocity--just plot velocty vs time and measure the area under the curve.

bqOvdGXxaa	Like the other responder pointed out if you discharge a capacitor that was charged to 250 Volts through a 1 ohm resistor the peak current will be 250 Amps. But capacitors are not rated for maximum current. Capacitors are rated for Maximum Voltage. A capacitor`s peak discharge current is limited only by the amplitude of the Voltage that it is charged up to and the external impedance that it discharges through.  A capacitor may damage a component that it discharges through somewhere in the circuit but a capacitor never damages itself by discharging too much current unless it is charged to a higher Voltage than it is rated at. Remember a capacitor only handles changes in current and not steady state current regardless of whether it`s charging or discharging. i of C = C de/dt. That is to say that if the Voltage across the capacitor is not changing then the capacitor`s current is zero. Of course the stored Voltage across the capacitor is decreasing as the capacitor discharges which accounts for de/dt required for current flow during discharge. <br>  <br>  You can see from the formula for i of C that a pulse Voltage which has a very high de/dt would create a very high instantaneous i of C during charge time which could possibly damage a capacitor like you said you heard from somewhere.<br>  <br>  Like say you put a few 200uF capacitors in a circuit (for what reason I don`t know) and charge them up to 250 Volts and then switch in a low resistance discharge path for them to discharge through then for sure you are going to create a lot of heat outside the capacitors. But when the discharge is finished the capacitors will be sitting there ready to be charged up to do it again but what ever they discharged through may be burned up and not so ready.|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	1 ohm means you will get a peak current of 250 amps.

UFteXlqwaa	When moist air rises, it cools down by adiabatic effect with altitude. If there is enough moist and warm air at the base, and it is very cold aloft, that air will keep rising and water drops will "fall" upward. That happens often in a thunderstorm.<br>  <br>  If there is enough energy to bring that moist air up to the tropopause; the top of all clouds, it will cool down to about -50 Celsius and become hail. Moving away from the strong convection at the center of the storm, it will fall down again at a speed of about 30 km/h.<br>  <br>  As it does, it warms up in the surrouding air. The average adiabatic lapse rate being 0.65 Celsius per 100 m, you can then calculate where is the isotherm in altitude; the place where the falling hail meets temperature above melting point. Of course, it takes some time for the ice to melt and in most cases, hail reaches the ground before it does. But the warmer the temperature at the surface, the higher the isotherm is and the longer hail will have to melt.<br>  <br>  Note that in the turbulent air of a tropical thunderstorm, many things happen and the hail can be caught not only by shear winds but also by what is called micro-bursts. That is exactly like a tornado but upside down. The air, usually dry but not always, is then pressed down all the way to the ground. This is extremely dangerous for aircraft on final approach, of course, as it can put the plane on the ground in a matter of seconds.<br>  <br>  But if you experience that type of turbulence associated with hail in a tropical region, there is certainly a big chance to see hail all the way to the ground.|`|2CBxqNcaaa	insufficient cold air aloft.|`|lnLVa1G2aa	it rains hard so thunder comes out. that is why andit does some damage|`|XfxXUNYqaa	because it doesnt get cold enough to freeze the rain.|`|fyA4uL6Taa	Not cold enough
F6IOLf3Aaa	There are four forces that govern the nature of matter and energy, these are: strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, electromagnetism, and gravity.<br>  <br>  The strong force, in the form of force carrier called pions, holds the protons and neutrons together strongly to form the nucleus of an atom. The weak force involves itself with radioactive decay.  All atomic particles feel the effects of the weak force.  However, more direct to your question: it is the electromagnetism along with something called angular momentum and charge attraction that keeps the electron (wave) in motion about the nucleus.  It's mathematically complex, but it has to do with something called quantum wave theory (quantum mechanics) where the photon is the "force carrier" for all electromagnetism phenomena.  The electrons and protons do interact -- through photon exchange.  It is the photons that tells the nucleus and the electron how to move and how to behave relative to one another. The photon exchange between a proton and an electron is quantized and "says" while your charge wants to "attract," I'm telling you, the photon seems to be saying, that you should repeal one another.<br>  <br>  For a more exact description, see: Exchange and sign-change: The Pauli exclusion<br>  <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/m374j0087014k572/" rel="nofollow">http://www.springerlink.com/content/m374...</a><br>  <br>  See: Particle Physics for Non-Physicsis<br>  by Professor Steven Polluck<br>  University of Colorado<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/CourseDescLong2.aspx?cid=1247" rel="nofollow">http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/CourseDescLo...</a>

CptGRMSlaa	Okay, I think maybe showing you might help.<br>  <br>  Think of the line y=x.<br>  <br>  If you plug 0 in for y, you get 0 for x.<br>  <br>  However, if you consider y=x+3, when you plug 0 in for y, you will be at the same place on the y axis, but since 0=X+3<br>  <br>  x=-3 ... x is shifted to the left 3 units from where it originally is when you consider the basic identity function.<br>  <br>  This pattern hold true with every time you add a number inside a function.  Likewise, you can establish a similar pattern and show that subtract a number from inside a function shifts it that many units to the right.|`|SYUcskEFaa	The function y=(x+3) is a horizontal shift of y=x.<br>  <br>  The reason is basically because they give you a new function, forcing each of the numbers you put in to have 3 added to them. (for instance, if i put in 1 for x, then y=4.  So YOU have to put in -3 to set the function back to its parent function, y=x.<br>  <br>  So if x = -3, then y = 0, just like when x is 0 in the parent function.<br>  <br>  It is a horizontal shift to the left because it forces you to compensate by putting in numbers for x that are more to the left.|`|Sroug6cIaa	This is a parabola in vertex form. <br>  <br>  y=a(x-h)^2+k where h is the x value of the vertex and k is the y value.<br>  <br>  As you can see, inside the brackets it says x MINUS h, so to find the actual value of h, you have to switch the sign that is given.<br>  <br>  So in this case, y=(x+3) tells you that h is actually -3 (the opposite of +3). If the value of h is negative, you move that number of units to the left, and if the value of h is positive, you move that number of units to the right. That's why.<br>  <br>  Another example:<br>  <br>  y = (x-4)<br>  <br>  This would move 4 units to the RIGHT, because the actual value of h (when you take it out of the equation) is the OPPOSITE of what's in the brackets. What's in the brackets is -4, so the opposite is +4. Positive 4 means it's a horizontal translation 4 units to the right.|`|7qpQSk0Paa	consider y = x<br>  now lets define a new parameter z such that when x = -3, z = 0 so z = x+3<br>  <br>  so the curve Y = z = x +3 the new curve Y is the same as the old curve y. However when x = a then y =a on the old curve. The new curve will have a value of a when x = a -3. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps. Take some time and plot some curves and it will be more obvious.

VLwox49Saa	Early in Earth's history (Hadean Eon) as it cooled down crustal rinds would form on the surface of magma, but because these crusts were weak and the earth was still really hot; this weak crustal rind was continuously reconsumed into the magma beneath the crust (i.e an early form of subduction). As earth cooled further (due to the formation of the primordial atmosphere and the decreasing intensity of the sun) the crust cooled substantially and became larger and thicker. However, Earth still maintains this recycling process of reconsuming its crust. How so? This is an attribute of Earth's hot interior. Because of the heat generated deep within Earths mantle and core, heat must rise and the cooler magma above must sink (convection) . Convection of the magma forces the plates lying above it to move slowly. This is Plate Tectonics. As plates PUSH together Earth's crust is pushed up as well generating Earthquakes and Mountains. There are places where the crust is very old and dense (oceanic crust), too dense to be upheld over the magma in the mantle- and it subducts (sinks back) into the mantle underneath less dense continental crust. As it goes down it scrapes the continental crust generating Earthquakes and also Volcanoes (Indonesia is famous for this). There are also places where two plates collide, but due to differences in plate motion they may not push up together but slide past eachother (i.e. the San Andreas Fault) and you can get Earthquakes here as well.<br>  <br>  Overall, when you have miles of hard rock pressing against and grinding against each other for millions of years eventually the stress becomes unbearble and the rocks buckle, break, slide and release all that pent up energy, which is the earthquake. The energy travels in waves (toss a rock in a pond and the rings that form are waves of energy). When rocks break along a fault the energy travels out side from the epicenter in waves. These waves cause the Earth's crust to move in waves as well. Of course, the crust is not very flexible and neither are the skyscrapers that sit upon  it, so when Earthquake waves hit a city all that brittle stuff collapses and breaks up too.|`|ouXbJLbOaa	i dont know really how to explane it, so i will the best i can.<br>  <br>  first of all the tectonic plates are always moving.<br>  <br>  so imagine you and a friend run rite into each other, fast.<br>  <br>  you would fall on the ground because of the force, rite?<br>  <br>  thats how earthquakes happen.<br>  <br>  one tries to move in a direction while another one is moving towards the same plate from the opposite direction.<br>  <br>  INSTEAD OF FALLING BACK, THEY FINALLY FORCEFULLY PUSH PAST EACH OTHER.<br>  <br>  and all that pressure that was building up is released upwards, moving the ground above [thats how earthquakes happen].|`|Om57h9N6aa	when rock underground suddenly breaks along a fault.

ArKT9O7Maa	This is caused by natural selection, and the size of the landmass.  As you may or may not know, an island is an ecologic area mostly independent of other landmasses.  This means that animals on them have to fill all the niches of an ecology while remaining within two restrictions:<br>  1: They have to fit on the island, or be able to swim to other islands.<br>  2: They have to be able to survive, and live off the vegetation of the island.<br>  <br>  These two factors cause species to shrink because all the animals depend on plants.  Only a small amount of plants can grow, so herbivores have to be able to eat enough to live, but little enough that the plants don't die out.  This means that carnivores have to be small enough that the herbivores can feed them in a similar matter.  In some cases, the carnivores are bigger than the herbivores by a wide margin.  This means that the herbivores are typically small rodents, etc., and the carnivore eats many of them.|`|eiim3tJuaa	<a href="http://www.nps.gov/chis/naturescience/island-fox.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nps.gov/chis/naturescience/is...</a><br>  The island fox (Urocyon littoralis) is the largest of the Channel Islands' native mammals.

We can rearrange this equation to solve for h in terms of Pi: h = V/(Pi * r^2). But we know V (342 cm^3) and we know r (r = d/2 = 3 cm, so r^2 = 9 cm^2). Hence V/r^2 = 342 cm^3 / 9 cm^2 = 38 cm. So the height of the cylinder is (38/Pi) cm. This is about 12.1 cm, or about 4.76 inches.<br>  <br>  If the distance between shelves if 36 cm, and we have to stack the soup cans on their bases, we can only stack them 2 cans high. This is because 2 cans has a height of 24.2 cm, which fits easily. But 3 cans would have a height of 36.3 cm, which is greater than 36 cm. So they wouldn't fit.

Then, distribute the 2 over the parenthesis resulting in: 6-2y-y=3.  Combine the two terms containing y, resulting in: 6-3y=3.  You can move the 6 to the other side by subtracting 6 from both sides resulting in: -3y=-3.  Now, divide both sides by -3, resulting in y=1.  Now, you can substitute this back into the equation x+y=3 to yield x+1=3.  Subtract 1 from both sides and you get x=2.  Ultimately this gives you the answer x=2, y=1, or the point (2,1)<br>  <br>  You can apply the same method to the other two questions.|`|Wagcdklxaa	<< What point is the intersection of the graphs of the lines 2x - y = 3 and x + y = 3 >><br>  <br>  Step 1 - Rewrite the given equations as:<br>  <br>  y = 2x - 3 and<br>  <br>  y = 3 - x<br>  <br>  <br>  Step 2 - Equate the two, i.e.,<br>  <br>  2x - 3 = 3 - x<br>  <br>  <br>  Step 3 - Combine terms and solve for "x"<br>  <br>  2x + x = 3 + 3<br>  <br>  3x = 6<br>  <br>  x = 2<br>  <br>  <br>  Step 4 -- solve for "y" (using either of the given equations)<br>  <br>  y = 3 - 2<br>  <br>  y = 1<br>  <br>  <br>  ANSWER:<br>  <br>  Point of intersection is (2,1) --- this is the first option in your listed choices.<br>  <br>  For Problems 2 and 3, follow the same steps enumerated above and you will get all your answers.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

Therefore, even if you placed the 15 and 20 lengths back to back, they wouldn't be able to connect to both ends of the 36 side (and so you can't form a triangle out of them).<br>  <br>  In the second case, you don't have this problem, so you can make a triangle.|`|AA11614996	Hi : <br>  <br>  because 20+15 = 35 and the 20 inch can't reach it by 1 inch; it fall 1 inch too short ; try it for your cut up some paper and you will <br>  <br>  the other 39- 24= 5 and the  the sum of the square of the two small sides is 38 and 39 is greater the 38 but it will make a triangle, a oblige one but it a triangle non the less think about or measure and cut some paper sides for a triangle and try it for yourself.

C3LiKhm8aa	You have to determine the diameter of the circle, which is the diagonal of the rectangle, since all four points of the rectangle touch the circle.  <br>  <br>  The diagonal is the solution of the hypotenuse of a triangle of height 48 inches and base leg of 14 inches.    Diagonal squared = height squared + base leg squared.<br>  <br>  Square each of these, 48^2 = 2304<br>  <br>  14^2 = 196<br>  <br>  Add them  196 + 2304 = 2500<br>  <br>  Take the square root of 2500, which is 50 inches.  This is the diameter of the circle. <br>  <br>  Area of a circle is 3.14159 * the radius squared (3.14159 is pi)<br>  <br>  The radius is half the diameter, or 25 inches.<br>  <br>  The area of the circle is 3.14159 * 25 * 25 = 1,963.49 sq in<br>  <br>  The rectangle is 48 * 14 = 672 sq in.<br>  <br>  Subtract the two and get 1,291.49 sq in as the area of the circle not in the rectangle.|`|XcxL6ZMqaa	well, to get the area of the rectangle is base times height. i dont know how to get the area of a circle.... but perimeter is either p=2(pie)r<br>  p= pie(d)

zYQFpJWNaa	Regarding your question, there are two basic designs of "v" type or in-line engines (radials are different), at least for gasoline: the two cycle engine and the four cycle engine. <br>  <br>  A two cycle engine fires once every time the crank goes around - every time the piston gets to the top of the cylinder (the exact position for ALL engines relative to the top varies and it is always at least slightly before the top, so that the effect of the explosion comes after the top.). <br>  <br>  A four cylinder engine, and that includes all diesel engines, fires every other time the piston gets to the top of the cylinder.<br>  <br>  So for 4 cylinder "v" type and in-line engines, the engine will fire half of its cylinders for each revolution. for a v4, that is 2 times, for a v8 that is 4 times, and so forth. I do not know what you mean by a  "14" or "15".<br>  <br>  Since in a V4, each cylinder is firing for 1 our of four of its cycles (intake, compression, explosion, exhaust), and each one is arranged to fire at a different time, yes, there is no power overlap from one cylinder to another, but the flywheel pretty much compensates by 'averaging' the power. And at higher rpms, there is not much of an interval between power strokes..

PgmsFBVlaa	The differential equation is y''''-6y'''+9y''=0, so let's study the polynomial k^4-6k^3+9k^2=k^2(k^2-6k+9)=k^2(k-3)^2; its roots are 0, 0, 3, 3. When the roots have degree strictly greater than 1 we need to multiply the elementary solutions for a monomial of increasing degree (1, x, x^2 and so on). In this case we have two roots of degree 2 so the elementary solutions are 1*e^(0x)=1, x*e^(0x)=x, 1*e^(3x)=e^(3x), x*e^(3x).<br>  <br>  The solution of the equation is y(x) = a*1 + b*x + c*e^(3x) + d*xe^(3x) = a + bx + ce^(3x) + dxe^(3x).<br>  <br>  y'(x) = b + 3ce^(3x) + 3dxe^(3x) + de^(3x)<br>  y''(x) = 9ce^(3x) + 6de^(3x) + 9dxe^(3x)<br>  y'''(x) = 27ce^(3x)+27de^(3x)+27dxe^(3x)<br>  <br>  We have the linear system<br>  <br>  y(0)=16<br>  y'(0)=14<br>  y''(0)=9<br>  y'''(0)=0<br>  <br>  The solution of the system is a=13, b=8, c=3, d=-3.<br>  <br>  Hence the answer to the problem is y(x) = 13 + 8x + 3e^(3x) - 3xe^(3x).

Its equation would be y=1x+0, or y=x with limits from x=0 to x=10. Integrate x and get x^2/2, which means it would look like a parabola.<br>  <br>  Line CE has a slope of -2. Its equation would be y=-2x+b. Find b by replacing x and y with one of the points on that line (like x=30 and y=10).<br>  10=-2(30)+b <br>  b=70<br>  The equation for line CE would be y=-2x+70. Integrate y with respect to x and get<br>   -x^2+70x, which is also an equation for a parabola.<br>  <br>  Regarding displacement vs. time graphs, AB would look like a U and CE would look like an upside down U (or a hill). You know these are parabolas because the equations have x to the second power.<br>  <br>  Now of course I know that when you integrate, you have a constant C which pinpoints your new curve, but without any initial conditions you can't find out where exactly to pinpoint this new curve. The integrated equations I gave you are the true shape of the displacement graphs, but as of if they are higher or lower in the y axis (just y translation), there is just not enough info and I doubt you would get docked for it.<br>  <br>  Edit: If you also have a line BC (it's hard for me to tell in your picture), its slope is 0 and its equation is y=10. Integrate that and you get 10x, which is a straight line that points to the right.<br>  <br>  Now the cool thing is that now you have like 3 things on your displacement curve, consisting of a U-shape... then the right part of the U goes straight into the line that points to the upper right at x=10... then at x=30 it curves into an upside down U-shape.

They want you to take that 78.69 and subtract 30 from that, which gives you 48.69.  You would then subtract this number from 180 and 360 because it is in the third and forth quadrant.

f2jjViwYaa	Yes, it is. The simplest justification for this is that its graph passes the vertical line test.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for a more rigorous explanation, it's because every value of x gets mapped to one, and EXACTLY one, value of y under y = x^2. In other words, no matter what number you give me, when I plug it in for x, there will be no ambiguity or confusion when it comes to determining y. I'll get only one number, and I'll know exactly what it is - all I have to do is square it. Note that this is not always the case: y = sqrt(x) (the square root of x) is NOT a function, because if you give me, say, 4, there are TWO possible y values that pop out of the function: +2 and -2.|`|vHTwS3E3aa	It is a function because one value of "x" can't have more than one value of "y"|`|a437a81a81df77e02521124f95502e21aa	It's a function if and only if you place restrictions on the domain of x and the range of y.  <br>  <br>  Doug

They do not need as much energy, so boiling happens at a lower temperature.  Which is why tea tastes bad at high altitudes - the water does not get hot enough to make decent tea.<br>  <br>  High pressures do the opposite - pushing down on the surface of the water, meaning the molecules need lots of energy (higher heat) to push against the air.  This is how pressure cookers work - keeping the pressure up, so boiling happens at a higher temperature, which speeds cooking.|`|Bp7Yfsqyaa	Normal water will always boil at 212 degrees Fahrenheit.  However, that number can fluctuate for a couple of reasons.  If there is a solute in the water (for example, salt), the boiling point will be raised.

Firstly, parallel lines always have the same gradient. Futhermore, you can always arrange an equation to be in the form y=mx+b. This is called 'point-gradient form'. In this form, m stands for the gradient. <br>  So the first step would be to find the gradient of -7x-5y+3=0. We can do this by rearranging it into point gradient form...remember we are trying to get y by itself.<br>  -7x-5y+3=0 .....................(now minus 3 from both sides)<br>  -7x-5y= -3..........................(now plus 7x to both sides)<br>  -5y= -3+7x ..........................(now divide both sides by -5)<br>  y= (-3+7x) / -5                     (put the product containing x at the front)<br>  y= 7x/5   -3/5                       (compare this to the point gradient form)<br>  <br>  so the point gradient form is y=mx+b and your equation looks like this: y= 7x/5  -3/5  so we can deduce that m= 7/5. Therefore the gradient of that equation is 7/5. And because the other line is parallel to it, its gradient is also 7/5.<br>  So now we now the gradient of that line and we also know a point on the line because we are given it (16, -17).<br>  So you can use the point gradient formula to find the equation of the line. For the point gradient formula, you only need a point (16, -17) and the gradient (7/5).<br>  The point gradient formula is y-y1 = m(x-x1)<br>  where x1 is the x coroinate of the point we are given and y1 is the y coordinate of the point we are given. The point we are given is (16, -17) so the x coordinate is 16 and the y coordinate is -17. And the gradient is 7/5. Remember the gradient is m. So just plug them into the formula..<br>  y-y1=m(x-x1)<br>  y-(-17) = (7/5)(x-16)<br>  y+17 = 7x/5 - 112/5            ......(now minus 17 from both sides)<br>  y= 7x/5 - 129/5        ..................(now times everything by 5)<br>  5y = 7x -129....(put every thing on one side by minusing 5 from both sides)<br>  7x-5y-129 = 0<br>  and that is the equation of the line. Yay! ;)

VxZl2hTcaa	We say Σa_n converges absolutely if and only if Σ|a_n| converges.  Let's see if our series converges absolutely (note: I will omit the limits of the series for clarity, so whenever you see "Σ," it means n runs from 0 to infinity).<br>  <br>  First note that |sin(5n)| <= 1 for any value of n.  This is true since sin(x) always outputs values from -1 to 1.  Thus we can see that:<br>  Σ|sin(5n)/(n^2)| <= Σ|1/(n^2)| = Σ1/(n^2)<br>  <br>  And we know that the series on the right converges since it is a p-series with p=2 (for more about p-series, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics)#P-series" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_se...</a> ).  Thus we know that the series on the left converges by the comparison test.<br>  <br>  Thus, we have showed that the series converges absolutely.<br>  <br>  P.S.  Is there a typo perhaps? Because actually, the series is defined to go from n=0 to infinity, but the n=0 case doesn't make any sense since division by zero is undefined.

Because of this, a completely new set of principles had to be developed that would apply to matter and energy on the atomic level, independent of normal physical properties of the universe that we observe on the larger scale; and these principles are the basis for the study of quantum physics.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|mJQheYGbaa	Very simple?  It is a very complicated thing!<br>  <br>  But if we must...<br>  <br>  I would say that quantum physics is juxtaposed to Newtonian physics.  Newton's physics describes the very big (apples, planets, balls, etc) macro particles very precisely.<br>  <br>  Quantum mechanics describes the very small (molecules, atoms, electrons, protons, neutrons, etc) by primarily using probabilities.<br>  <br>  In the quest to explain things precisely, quantum physicists had to settle on the fact that they simply can't know precisely how these subatomic particles behave - and had to use probabilities to explain them.  At the subatomic level, the common day to day logic breaks down, and the language of Newtonian physics couldn't explain the world of the atom.  <br>  <br>  As an example of the "weird" ness of it...The model of atoms as a nucleus with little "planet-like" electrons that has tainted high school chemistry books hasn't helped people understand quantum mechanics.  That model is false.  In fact, quantum theory says that electrons exist as "probabilities".  They have higher probabilities of being in some parts of the atom than others.  They can even be in two places at the same time.  <br>  <br>  Told you it gets weird!|`|03cLY4H8aa	I am not also good in science or math but i do hope that this one simplified what quantum mechanics is all about:<br>  <br>  Quantum Mechanics is the science that studies the sub-atomic particles and deals with the behavior of objects within their Compton wavelengths.<br>  <br>  While studying quantum mechanics, there are five points to keep in mind. <br>  <br>  First, more than eighty years of lab experiments proved that the principles of quantum mechanics are real and valid. Mathematics of quantum theory precisely predicts and reproduces the results of physical experiments. We are applying these principles in making delicate instruments and building precise computers. Therefore, Quantum Mechanics is an actual science. <br>  <br>  Second, Quantum mechanics is weird. In this arena, certainty of classic physics is replaced by the uncertainty and definite state observed in macro-world turns to chaotic world of super-position of states. Casualty (cause and effect) may reverse so that cause appears before effect (second Feynman diagram). Direction of time can reverse also and future arrives before the past. Entanglement between distant particles exists without apparent link. The law of conservation of energy gets pale in many instances. And so forth and so on.<br>  <br>  Third, apparently we cannot utilize the logic of classical physics to interpret the weirdness of quantum mechanical phenomena. We have to develop a new logic to accommodate a reality that is beyond our today's consensus reality. <br>  <br>  Fourth, quantum physics is not an abstract science that belongs to laboratories and scientists, it is the basic science which describes the building blocks of our body and our macro-world and it is the infra-structure of laws of classical physics.<br>  <br>  And fifth, Quantum mechanics laws are applied equally to micro and macro-world.<br>  <br>  Good news is quantum mechanics are set to explain the unexplained. Therefore the mysteries can be explained by scientists through scientific methodology not mystics approach with the usual misconceptions and delusions.|`|NhfKjvwcaa	Quantum physics is the study of how matter interacts at the atomic level. Quantum mechanics is especially useful for nanotechnology as matter as small as protons and electrons actually diffract through gaps of similar size of themselves and nano materials actually have different physical properties (i.e. gold starts to have different properties when at an atomic level rather than at a macro level). You also have phenomena such as the photoelectric effect, light having a momentum (Our teacher was discussing how computer companies are trying to design lasers that actually move matter around by picking it up).|`|805d5aa14fdca671ed6b65dfbb2b1962aa	In simple terms quantum physice refers to the quantization of light energy as descrete packets of energy called photons. Everything else about quantum physics is derrived from this first principle. Thus you have the contradictory duality of light existing as both a wave and a quantized particle, depending on the situation.<br>  <br>  By "light energy" here we mean all electromagnetic radiation. Furthermore this quantum principle has been extended to all forms of energy, including gravity.

Contrary to what you might expect, this is done by adjusting the finder, rather than the main telescope. First, in daylight get the main telescope pointing at a distant object, one way or another, say a chimney or antenna at least 1/4 mile away. Once you've found a target, don't move the main telescope. Then, while looking through the finder, adjust the two screws on the ring part of the finder bracket so that the crosshairs in the finder align with the object you're looking at through the main telescope. You can also do this at night, but it's easier during the day. At night you should use Polaris as the target, since any other object in the sky will be moving because of the Earth's rotation, making the alignment much harder.<br>  <br>  This is also described in detail in the users manual which comes with the scope.|`|QKO4f5q0aa	If it's the stock viewfinder, there should be a thumbwheel mounted horizontally under the back end of the viewfinder that will adjust it up and down, and a second thumbwheel mounted vertically on the right side, that will adjust it left/right.  <br>  <br>  Sight on a fixed distant object with the telescope (a light on a radio mast does very well for this) and adjust the viewfinder to hit the same object.

Or, matter may be converted into energy in a nuclear fission or fusion (the atomic bomb).<br>  <br>  I am not sure that what follows here, is a simple explanation but it is at least a simpler derivation of the famous energy-mass equivalence equation! <br>  <br>  The famous equation (E=mc2) was derived by Einstein as part of his 1905 paper 'On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies'. This theory is now better known as the ‘Theory of Special Relativity’. Its underlying concepts were that wherever an observer is located he or she must find the laws of physics to be the same and furthermore, whatever the observer’s velocity he or she must find the speed of light to have the same value. The speed of light is a universal upper limit to all velocities. To allow observers with different velocities to transform their results so that they agreed, Einstein provided a transform equation: -<br>  <br>  x = x'/sqrt(1 -(v/c)2)<br>  <br>  Thus measurement x for one observer, separating from another observer with a constant velocity v, can be transformed into the other observers measurement x’.<br>  <br>  The famous equation is derived from the expression for work energy. Work equals force times distance.<br>  <br>  dW = F.ds<br>  <br>  Since force F equals d(mv)/dt and ds/dt = v we can expand the expression for work into: -<br>  <br>  dW =(d(mv)/dt).ds<br>  <br>  or, expanding further: -<br>  <br>  dW=v2dm+mv.dv<br>  <br>  Using the observers transform equation for masses (x = m, x’ = m’) we can obtain<br>  <br>  m2c2 = m2v2 + m'2c2<br>  <br>  Differentiating, with c and m' as constants, gives: -<br>  <br>  2mc2dm = 2mv2dm + 2m2vdv<br>  <br>  When the 2m is divided out, we are left with: -<br>  <br>  dW = c2dm<br>  <br>  Thus integrating between limits m and m' (the rest mass) with c constant gives:-<br>  <br>  W = c2∫dm = c2(m - m')<br>  <br>  Or (since the total work is the energy): -<br>  <br>  E = mc2 + m'c2<br>  <br>  This is not Einstein's original derivation but I hope you find it perhaps a bit easier going than his briefer, but for all that, calculus rich approach.|`|1ByWZHNUaa	You'd have to understand relativity to begin to see why. Energy and mass are interchangeable. The speed of light is a constant, which means you cannot do anything to make light go faster, even if you are flying at high speeds and holding a light source in front of you. <br>  <br>  It's a really deep theory and an even more interesting equation that condenses Einstein's greatest discoveries into  e=mc2.|`|74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa	Work energy E = FS which is force times distance; so that an increment of energy in an increment of time is dE/dt = F dS/dt = Fc since we are talking about light speed c = dS/dt  Thus a unit of energy from motion (kinetic energy) is dE = F c dt<br>  <br>  Change in momentum dP = F dt = c dm as mass increases near light speed.  Note the velocity doesn't change as it is at or near light speed, but the mass does.<br>  <br>  Then the force F = c dm/dt from a unit of mass increase in a unit time.  This is the same force giving the mass kinetic energy.<br>  <br>  Then, combining the motion and mass increases sources of energy, we have dE = c dm/dt c dt = dm c^2 and, ta da, there you have the c^2 for an increment of mass dm yielding a unit of energy dE.

We are discovering new planets everyday in the same proximity from their suns as we are from ours - seemingly good conditions for life to evolve. <br>  <br>  I would say it's almost a certainty that other life does exist in the universe,  it's just a case of if we ever find it. Proof lies in the probability!|`|gLp7pvPnaa	If we knew the statistical chances of life evolving, compared to those of there being sufficiently suitable life bearing planets in the observable universe, then it might be possible to make a good guess. If the greater universe or multiverse exists, and it is truly infinite, then life forms too would be infinite. No one knows.|`|Ax54M1Dhaa	I believe it does, though I don't believe any life has visited this planet.  When you think about it, there are about 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone.  The number of planets orbiting those stars is likely in the trillions.  Now astronomers believe there are around 100 billion galaxies with similar numbers of stars to ours.  So that makes somewhere around 1 x 10^33 planets give or take a few orders of magnitude.  Statistically speaking our planet cannot be the only one out of all of those that can support life.  If that's true it is extremely likely there is other life somewhere in the universe, probably quite a few places.  My Cosmology professors estimation was 50 planets in our galaxy that may support life but of course that was just a guess.|`|8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	I'm not gonna actually do your coursework for you, but here's a few leads:<br>  <br>  Chemosynthesis: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemosynthesis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemosynthe...</a><br>  Hydrothermal vents: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrotherma...</a><br>  Possibility of life on Jupiter's moon Europa: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)#Possible_extraterrestrial_life" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moo...</a>|`|t27SvIPbaa	The mainstream media made sure this would not get out<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vyVe-6YdUk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vyVe-6Yd...</a><br>  (Disclosure project)|`|X3aD1wflaa	I thought they found life on Mars|`|wnyuH0aTaa	Hold on, I'll just nip out and check.|`|vMR0IqNCaa	statistically possible there are 30 billion billion planets in the universe roughly, likely more, organic matter can be created from no life by shooting lightining through the mix of gasses that were on earth millions of years ago then we get proteins used to make DNA and therefore life, this would take millions of years to join to become even a single cell so this can be given a low probibility of 1 in 100'000'000. from this point for these cells to become multicellular which is breaking a huge barrier it would take huge amounts of time and easily has a probibility of 1 in a billion this leaves roughly 1 in 1 billion billion which has a probobility of 30 planets in our universe which have a liklihood of spawning multicellular life|`|s9G56VH7aa	It's impossible to have any sort of proof, or even fully-grounded scientific reasoning.<br>  <br>  That said, there are more than 100,000,000,000 galaxies with up to 100,000,000,000 stars in each.

I'll just add that it is partially learned, but not all doctors possess the nerves of steel that some do.  I have personally had the unpleasant experience of working with a few doctors who did lots of yelling and falling apart in emergencies......it tended to spread chaos rather than to keep things running like a well oiled machine.  I think that if you are given to emotional outbursts and overreacting, some specialties should be avoided.

xIisVcLTaa	Velocity is speed with a direction. Use the example of driving in a car down the street from your home when you make a left turn out the driveway versus a right turn out of the driveway. Both directions you can travel the same speed and yet have completely opposite velocity! 20 mph east versus 20mph west, for example. <br>  <br>  Displacement is a measure of how far you have gone from some point. Let's use the example of driving from home again. If you let the home be your point of origin and drive to the left out of your driveway, we can say you have a displacement in the left direction. If you make a right turn and drive, you would have some displacement in the right direction (these could be east and west or north and south if you like). If from either journey, you turn around and come home and stop, you have zero displacement.|`|qPZPduLXaa	Velocity is a vector. That means that it has a direction. So your velocity would be "five miles per hour north". Speed is a scalar. That means it has no direction. Your speed would be "five miles per hour".

So for this u will be using pathagorous theorem and the displacement will be 5. see the fig below<br>  <br>  <br>                                          | A.<br>                                          |                                   <br>                                          |   4<br>                  3                      |<br>   C -----------------------------------| B<br>  <br>  Now draw a line from point A to C and this will be ur traingle and line ac will be the displacement..

vSkqJ813aa	The nuclear quantum theorist Eugene Wigner, commented that mathematics is a 'wondrous utility function'! It seems that mathematics is always 'there' to describe physical phenomena and perhaps it is the natural language of the universe! However, I would argue that mathematics is not the natural language of physical phenomena and in fact - 'so far' we have been 'lucky' that it has been 'there' for us when we need it! Please allow me to explain!<br>  <br>  In 1920, the German mathematician David Hilbert (January 23, 1862 – February 14, 1943) set out on a project to formalise mathematics. Wikipedia comments, '... ...he proposed explicitly a research project (in meta-mathematics, as it was then termed) that became known as Hilbert's program. He wanted mathematics to be formulated on a solid and complete logical foundation. He believed that in principle this could be done, by showing that:<br>  <br>  1.all of mathematics follows from a correctly-chosen finite system of axioms; and <br>  <br>  2.that some such axiom system is provably consistent through some means such as the epsilon calculus. <br>  <br>  He seems to have had both technical and philosophical reasons for formulating this proposal. It affirmed his dislike of what had become known as the ignorabimus, still an active issue in his time in German thought, and traced back in that formulation to Emil du Bois-Reymond.<br>  <br>  This program is still recognizable in the most popular philosophy of mathematics, where it is usually called formalism. For example, the Bourbaki group adopted a watered-down and selective version of it as adequate to the requirements of their twin projects of (a) writing encyclopaedic foundational works, and (b) supporting the axiomatic method as a research tool. This approach has been successful and influential in relation with Hilbert's work in algebra and functional analysis, but has failed to engage in the same way with his interests in physics and logic. ..'<br>  <br>  Thus, I now turn to my answer to your question. Until about 1931, it seemed that mathematics was some sort of universal language that could be used to 'describe' the 'reality' of the world. It seemed that mathematics was a innate, universal language that could be discovered in the 'same' form by all 'workers' (the use of ' ' is deliberate here). Newton co-discovered calculus and Euclid discovered geometry just as Riemann extended geometry and Einstein used this non-Euclidean geometry to extend Newton's gravity. Hence, mathematics appeared to be a 'universal' language of its own. <br>  <br>  However, and here is the ‘crunch point’, Wikipedia comments '... Hilbert and the talented mathematicians who worked with him in his enterprise were committed to the project. His attempt to support axiomatized mathematics with definitive principles, which could banish theoretical uncertainties, was however to end in failure.<br>  <br>  G?del demonstrated that any non-contradictory formal system, which was comprehensive enough to include at least arithmetic, cannot demonstrate its completeness by way of its own axioms. In 1931 his incompleteness theorem showed that Hilbert's grand plan was impossible as stated. The second point cannot in any reasonable way be combined with the first point, as long as the axiom system is genuinely finitary.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, the subsequent achievements of proof theory at the very least clarified consistency as it relates to theories of central concern to mathematicians. Hilbert's work had started logic on this course of clarification; the need to understand G?del's work then led to the development of recursion theory and then mathematical logic as an autonomous discipline in the 1930s. The basis for later theoretical computer science, in Alonzo Church and Alan Turing also grew directly out of this 'debate'. ...' <br>  <br>  From the work of Kurt G?del (April 28, 1906 Brno – January 14, 1978 Princeton, New Jersey), it seems that mathematics is incomplete in terms of its ability to logically prove itself! Wikipedia adds, '... A small number of scientists claim that G?del's incompleteness theorem proves that any attempt to construct a TOE is bound to fail. G?del's theorem, informally stated, asserts that any sufficiently complex mathematical theory that has a finite description is either inconsistent or incomplete. In his 1966 book The Relevance of Physics, Stanley Jaki pointed out that, because any "theory of everything" will certainly be a consistent non-trivial mathematical theory, it must be incomplete. He claims that this dooms searches for a deterministic theory of everything.<br>  <br>  Freeman Dyson has stated that<br>  <br>  “ G?del’s theorem implies that pure mathematics is inexhaustible. No matter how many problems we solve, there will always be other problems that cannot be solved within the existing rules. [...] Because of G?del's theorem, physics is inexhaustible too. The laws of physics are a finite set of rules, and include the rules for doing mathematics, so that G?del's theorem applies to them. ” <br>  <br>  Stephen Hawking was originally a believer in the Theory of Everything but, after considering G?del's Theorem, concluded that one was not obtainable.<br>  <br>  “ Some people will be very disappointed if there is not an ultimate theory, that can be formulated as a finite number of principles. I used to belong to that camp, but I have changed my mind. ” <br>  <br>  ...'<br>  <br>  Touching briefly, then, upon 'string' theories. These theories have encountered the usual problems associated with differential equations - that they have more than one solution - in fact, they have a family of solutions. Wikipedia comments, '... M-theory is not yet complete; however it can be applied in many situations (usually by exploiting string theoretic dualities). The theory of electromagnetism was also in such a state in the mid-19th century; there were separate theories for electricity and magnetism and, although they were known to be related, the exact relationship was not clear until James Clerk Maxwell published his equations, in his 1864 paper A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field. Witten has suggested that a general formulation of M-theory will probably require the development of new mathematical language. However, some scientists have questioned the tangible successes of M-theory given its current incompleteness, and limited predictive power, even after so many years of intense research. ...'. <br>  <br>  If these theories do extend our knowledge of the physical world then, like Einstein's work, they will be reduced to ordinary language! <br>  <br>  Hence, to summarise - it seems that mathematics has always provided a stable, natural (?) language in which to describe phenomena but it may not be the ultimate 'natural' language of the universe! Einstein sought to understand ‘his [God's] equations’ but perhaps the 'universe' has been having a 'bit of a laugh' at our feeble efforts to describe it using mathematics! Perhaps the universal 'picture' will be clearer when we understand the universes’ own hidden language?|`|t9iWZmmQaa	Remember that maths is used to model physical systems. On the other hand it is true that we have never seen an electron, proton or neutron far less a quark. We have only seen tracks in cloud chambers and bubble chambers and note how these tracks alter in the presence of magnetic and electric fields. To describe what we see we assign properties of mass, charge and spin to these particles and develop consistent theories using mathematical models.

I think it's more likely you saw the brightest star Sirius, which often flashes with blue and red light when low in the sky. But it's easy to tell which you saw. If you go outside around 7 p.m., Venus is a steady white light in the western sky and Sirius is a flashing light in the southeast. A couple of hours later, at 9 p.m., because of the Earth's rotation, Venus will be setting in the west and Sirius will be high in the southern sky.|`|dZKiXbhRaa	yeppers|`|kV9GlWDFaa	wheres your location??? homie!|`|qlOgQxnTaa	me 2saw that .. really wana know is thats true? i heard it was mars|`|bxlYleZkaa	Venus, probably, Mars, maybe.|`|gsQU85fIaa	yes and i just thought i was having a flash ack from all of the LSD that i took when i was younger

Here's why:<br>  1) The pace of technological change is increasing exponentially. We are now at the point where, if you plotted it on a graph, that pace is really starting to ramp upwards. <br>  2) 99% of all scientists who ever lived, are alive today. That number is only going to increase.<br>  3) A new technology is being born, one that has the potential to free mankind forever from material want, all disease, permanent injury, and perhaps even death itself, not to mention the potential to return the Earth to its former pristine state, and ending the problem of waste disposal. I'm referring to nanotechnology, and all thinking people should google that word and become educated on the topic, because its coming sooner than anyone thinks, and will, when mature, profoundly affect everything on this planet.<br>  No technology is without risks, of course, and the risks of nanotech are equally potentially great. If we do not exercise tremendous foresight and restraint in the development of this tech, it could get out of control in several very nasty ways. That's why I try to tell people about it; forewarned, is forearmed. If we as a society can somehow have the strength to not misuse this new tool, it's within our grasp to create a real paradise on Earth, for everyone, forever. That prospect appeals to me greatly, and I hope also to you.|`|jLe6GDu8aa	David C, I LOVE your answer (Fallout 3)!

The media even went as far as showing us how this was all possible. In fact, the media force fed us "the future" as if it could be no other way.

K79UmW7Uaa	The process that can occur only during the day (or at least while exposed to light) is photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is when the plant converts light energy into chemical energy. <br>  <br>  The "dark" process (this process has several names- I will call it the Calvin cycle here) then turns this chemical energy (created by the light process) into sugars that the plant can use as energy for itself- so that it can live. <br>  <br>  -->Basically, all the water, sunlight and carbondioxide is combined by these processes to create food (sugar) for the plant.<br>  <br>  As for oxygen and carbondioxide::: The plant actually "breathes" in carbondioxide and splits that molecule so that it can use the carbon atom from it. The plant does not use the oxygen atoms, and so it releases them into the environment (so we can breathe them in!). [the plant actually also releases unused oxygen atoms from the light process when it splits the water/H2O molecule. It uses the hydrogen atoms, but gets rid of the oxygen atoms.]<br>  <br>  SO.. plants do not release carbondioxide and uptake oxygen. it's the other way around.

AA11513203	Not really.<br>  <br>  Evolution is about how life *changes* ... not about how life *began* ... and CERTAINLY not how the universe began.<br>  <br>  Of course (to respond to Bob D's valid point), in a sense you could say that *EVERYTHING* in science is related to the Big Bang ... IF you see the Big Bang as the moment of origination of the laws of physics ... since EVERYTHING in science is assumed to obey those laws.   So it is fair to say the evolution is related to the big bang IF you also admit that so is photosynthesis; or how H and O molecules bind into water molecules; or the gravity governing the planets, tides, and falling apples; or global warming; to the electrons that power the computer you are using to read these words ... all are related to the Big Bang IF you accept the Big Bang as the origins of the laws of physics.<br>  <br>  But the main people who try to lump together evolution and the Big Bang ... are Creationists trying to lump together topics that have absolutely NOTHING in common except that Creationists reject them!<br>  <br>  They are usually lumped with a third topic ... abiogenesis (the origins of life), which is NOT a part of evolution.   But they try to wrap these things up into something they call "evolutionism" ... again, because this make it convenient to oppose ... as if "evolutionism" is the "only" part of science they disagree with, and are otherwise quite reasonable people who really do "respect science."   Never mind the fact that saying that you accept all of biology except the "evolution part" is like saying you accept all of chemistry except the "atoms and molecules part" ... or all of astronomy except the "gravity part".   And never mind that the Big Bang and evolution have as little to do with each other *scientifically* as the Big Bang and auto mechanics.  The point is to isolate and exclude these topics from the rest of science, and instead lump them together into an incoherent "philosophy", "doctrine", or "religion" they call 'evolutionism.'<br>  <br>  It is false.   It is dishonest.<br>  <br>  It is false to lump evolution in with the big bang because: <br>  (A) the two have *completely* different types of scientific evidence that support them.   <br>  and<br>  (B) either one could be absolutely false, and the other absolutely true.  As explanatory theories, they are not *LOGICALLY* dependent on each other in any way whatsoever.<br>  <br>  And it is dishonest because the Creationist is insisting on an infinite regress that they do not demand for other branches of science.   Evolution must be rejected until it can "explain" the origins of life, the organic molecules that started life, the origins of stars that formed those elements, all the way back to the origins of the universe itself.  In other words, it is dishonest because it demands that the 'evolutionists' answer ALL questions, or else we should accept NONE of it!<br>  <br>  So no, there is nothing in common *scientifically* between evolution and the big bang that does not include all other branches of science as well.   In short, they have nothing in common except that they are both called science.|`|ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	Only in the minds of the deliberately misinformed.|`|bxlYleZkaa	No doubt there are some who will say it does, but no, I don't think so.|`|TL1Jkqunaa	Not really, not directly.

If there were no quantum laws describing the nature of atomic and subatomic particles, there would be no atoms or molecules or larger molecular structures. There would be no change, nothing.  Do you not understand that biological evolution is based upon biochemical change (mutations) in which natural selection acts upon in certain fashion, and that these mechanisms of change has their own roots in the basic laws of classical physics and in quantum mechanics?  No process in our large 4 dimensional reality takes place independent of the basic laws of nature at the molecular, atomic, and subatomic level. How can it be otherwise?<br>  <br>  In short, all that we understand about the reality of our world and universe is orchestrated and revealed to us by way of the first laws of nature set down in a minuscule period of time just after the big bang.<br>  <br>  This has nothing to do with gods, devils, or religion, but has everything to do with truth and the very nature of the fabric of reality.<br>  <br>  Nothing large or small (dynamic or static) exists without the laws of classical and quantum physics defining it.  The origin of life, life itself and its own evolution, and consciousness of life have its own origins in the quantum vacuum dynamics, in quantum entanglement, and within Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa	No.  Gravity comes from sources other than the Moon and Earth.  The Sun, for example, exerts a force on that spaceship m between the Moon and Earth.  As do also the other masses in our solar system.<br>  <br>  However, there is a point between the two planets where the dominance of one source, like the Earth, gives way to the dominance from the other one, like the Moon.  This happens where GmE/R^2 = GmM/r^2 occurs.  That is the force from the Earth E equals but is opposite to the force from the Moon M.<br>  <br>  E/R^2 = M/r^2 so that R = sqrt(E/M) r; where R is the distance from Earth's center and r is the distance from the Moon's center when the two opposing forces are equal but opposite.  The center to center distance between the Moon and Earth is D = R + r.|`|AA10274801	Both the moon and the earth move in the gravitational field of the Sun.<br>  When the moon is between the Sun and the Earth there is a gravitational force.Here the force between the moon and the sun is greater than the  force between the earth and the moon.<br>  <br>  The gravitational energy between the Earth and the moon balances at a fulcrum called the Bary center. The force x distance to the fulcrum is equal to the gravitational energy of the system.<br>  The force experienced by a  moving mass always has a reacting force equal in magnitude:As per Newton 3rd law of motion.|`|NhfKjvwcaa	Theoretically there is a location where the gravitational force is zero if you just consider the moon and the Earth to be the only bodies in space (Since gravitational fields extend out to infinite lengths and with every celestial body in space there will be some form of gravitation acting on a body). <br>  <br>  To find this location we have to setup an equation where the gravitational force of the Earth equals the gravitational force of the moon. <br>  <br>  So we have these equations:<br>  <br>  M(Earth)/R(From Earth)^2 = M(Moon)/R(From Moon)^2<br>  <br>  5.9736×10^24 /R(From Earth)^2 = 7.347 7 × 10^22/R(From Moon)^2<br>  <br>  81.3/R(From Earth)^2 = 1/R(From Moon)<br>  <br>  R(From Moon) = 3.84x10^8 - R(From Earth)<br>  <br>  81.3(3.84x10^8 - R(Earth)) = R(From Earth)<br>  <br>  3.12x10^10 - 82.3R(Earth) = 0<br>  <br>  R(Earth) = 3.79x10^5km<br>  <br>  So if you travel 370,892km directly towards the surface of the moon you will theoretically have no net gravitational force acting on you.|`|8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	There will still be gravitational force from the Sun and the planets in our Solar System. Every point in space experiences gravitational force from one object or another. You can't have gravity-free space.<br>  <br>  Saying that, there is indeed a point between the Earth and the Moon where their respective gravitations are evened out. If you were to draw an imaginary line from the Moon to the Earth, that point would lie on the border of the Moon's Hill sphere.<br>  <br>  I have to explain what a Hill sphere is. It's the volume of space around a celestial body where that body's gravitation is predominant. For a planet to retain a moon, the moon must have an orbit that lies within the Hill sphere of the planet. That moon would, in turn, have a Hill sphere of its own. Any objects within that distance would tend to become satellites of the moon, rather than of the planet itself.<br>  <br>  So, the point between the Earth and the Moon where none of them have predominant gravitational pull, is the point where the Moon's Hill sphere ends and the Earth's Hill sphere takes effect. The Moon's Hill sphere has a radius of about 60,000 km.

N7JPzxiRaa	Wet Etching is an etching process that utilizes liquid chemicals or etchants to remove materials from the wafer, usually in specific patterns defined by photoresist masks on the wafer.  Materials not covered by these masks are 'etched away' by the chemicals while those covered by the masks are left almost intact.  These masks were deposited on the wafer in an earlier wafer fab step known as   'lithography.'
DRVSCxKpaa	We are changing because of breeding; but that's not what really drives evolutionary change, which comes about through gene changes.  There are some geneticists who point out that some of the factors that increase the likelihood of passing on gene mutation are becoming absent in modern society (such as large families, parents having children over several years, and isolated gene pools or inbreeding).  In addition, genetic mutation in humans and chromosomal abnormalities are nearly always deleterious to the health of the individual, and so are avoided.  Evolution has to go down many 'dead ends' before positive changes happen (changes that give the individuals a greater chance of survival).  This just doesn't happen, because for the most part, we won't take the risk of passing on chromosomal abnormalities.  These geneticists claim that human evolution has stagnated.<br>  <br>  There are others who point out that the male Y chromosome is getting shorter, and in a few hundred or thousand more generations, we may lose the ability to breed.  This is a controversial subject.<br>  Have a look at the following reference on chromosomal abnormalities, to see how they occur and how they are passed on.

4b95c896cc3b6856f49bf2c374b3e253aa	To answer this you need to know what precipitate is in each of these.<br>  <br>  The first one is Hg2Cl2<br>  <br>  This leaves you with Ba2+ and Fe2+<br>  What is odd is that the Ba2+ should precipitate with the sulfate. Since it doesn't, there is no net ionic equaiton.<br>  Meaning the last one is the Fe2+<br>  <br>  First net ionic equation:<br>  Hg2 2+ (aq) + 2Cl- (aq) --> Hg2Cl2 (s)<br>  <br>  Last net ionic equation:<br>  Fe2+ (aq) + CO3 2- (aq) --> FeCO3 (s)<br>  <br>  If BaSO4 is formed you would do it the same as the above.

It would be ridiculous to suggest someone would respect one and not the other. After careful examination, both mean deserve great respect. Though both certainly had their flaws.

They learn the refinery end and the production in the oil field end also.<br>  <br>  Look at this link:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_engineering" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_e...</a>|`|AA10332086	Petroleum engineering is primarily focused on the oil and gas reservoir, the drilling for and production of oil and gas and its preparation for shipment to a refinery or market.

I know pretty much nothing about oil until it shows up at a plant other than that it probably came from underground somewhere on the planet.  My understanding is that petroleum engineers learn a lot about finding and getting oil out of the ground and don't focus quite so much about what to do with it once it's out.  <br>  At the school I went to, chemical engineering was in the college of engineering. . . petroleum engineering was grouped with mining, geology, and other stuff-in-the-ground fields and not with most other engineering disciplines.|`|J3TGyOnDaa	I'm not sure, but I think there is more emphasis on geology in a petroleum engineering program than their is in chemical engineering.

There is a 1/3 chance of this happening.  Now box 2 has a total of 2 A's in it, so the chance of drawing an A is 2/5.

In our first branch, we have (2/3)*(4/5) = 8/15.  In the second branch we have (1/3)*(3/5) = 3/15.  Adding these two together gives the probability that A will not be drawn, 8/15 + 3/15 = 11/15.

How difficult is it for life to come into existence out of non-life.<br>  2. How unique is the Earth's environment and its environmental history in the universe and how necessary was that environmental history to the development of intelligent life (man).<br>  <br>  The first question addresses whether, given the right environment, would it be likely that life would start up anywhere?  We suspect that the answer to that question is: Very Likely.  The reason is that the more we look around the universe the more precursors to life we find.  The more we look around the Earth the more we find evidence that life on the Earth happened very soon after the Earth was created (geologically speaking).  The question of life elsewhere in our solar system is probably the most important question that all of our space exploration is aimed at answering.  We have not found any slam-dunk evidence for life elsewhere but we continue to find places where it could have developed and we continue to look.<br>  <br>  The second question addresses the nurturing of primitive life into complex organisms.  On Earth (our only example of life we currently have) it took over 3.5 billion years to come up with man; three and a half billion years where the environment on the Earth was relatively stable.  For about 3 billion of those years life was mostly single celled.  During this immense time period the environment on Earth was favorable to the continued development of life even in the face of a drastically changing solar environment.  Is it likely that such a planet would exist elsewhere in the universe?  The numbers of stars are staggering so it might seem a virtual certainty that there are “Earth-like Planets” elsewhere in the universe.   Consider this: the Earth has developed life and as far as we currently know Mars and Venus have not.  They are Earth-like planets - very similar planets to the Earth.  The answer must be more complicated than just “Earth-like planets.”<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider: our sun, Sol, has over the last 4 billion years increased its output by about 25% due to normal stellar evolution.  That is an enormous change in output and without some compensating factor the Earth, over that time period, would have gone from an ice ball to a barren Venus like planet.  It didn't- but we don't know what the factor or factors were that maintained such a constant environment.  It is highly unlikely that another “Earth-Like Planet” would have a continuously nurturing environment over a multi-billion year span.<br>  <br>  Now consider the likelihood of the Earth receiving visits from aliens.  The chances of alien life forms visiting us come down to three additional questions.  One addresses the spatial problem and one the temporal problem.  The third addresses actual travel possibilities.<br>  <br>  1. If a technologically sophisticated life form did develop elsewhere in the universe would it be likely that they would be contemporaneous with man when he is also technologically sophisticated. <br>  2. Is it likely that a technologically sophisticated life form could develop near enough to us so that they could reasonably visit the Earth?<br>  3. Does there really exist a “new physics” that would allow travel over immense distances in reasonable times?<br>  <br>  When alien extraterrestrial life is considered what we usually referred to is: technologically sophisticated life.  We aren’t usually talking about bacteria or worms or even Homo Erectus visiting the Earth.  Humans have been technologically sophisticated for only about 100 years with radio communications and rockets. Our first satellite to orbit another body was only 42 years ago. That is 100 years out of a total history for the Solar System of 4,500,000,000 years and of 13,500,000,000 years for the universe.  The chances of a second life form becoming technologically sophisticated and also overlapping in time with man- also being technologically sophisticated seem vanishing small.  Alien civilizations may have come into being, developed and become extinct hundreds of millions of years before or after Earth’s man became technologically sophisticated.<br>  <br>  The problem of travel is also daunting.  With all of our present sophistication we do not have the ability to travel to even the nearest star.  The development of super-sophisticated intelligent extraterrestrial life capable of traveling to nearby stars would first require a nurturing environment existing for billions of years and then the development of science and technology far beyond ours. Put all together- that in itself is very, very, very unlikely.  For intelligent life to happen a second time NEAR enough to our star, Sol, so travel would be possible is vanishingly unlikely.  In talking about alien visitors to Earth there is an implied uncovering of a ‘new physics’ that would allow what our present physics does not allow- travel over large distances in reasonable time frames.  It may be that that physics does not exist.  If you indulge in new physics then you are opening yourself up to creating a fantasy world that may not exist in reality<br>  <br>  Man presently might have the technology and ability to send a man to Neptune.  At the speed of 50,000 miles per hour we would need to provide life support to the astronauts for several years.  It would take 6.4 years at 50,000 mph to go to Neptune – one way.  Now consider the NEAREST star.  At a speed of 1,000,000 miles per hour it would take 2,885 years just to get there AND that is only to the nearest star!<br>  <br>  Unless there really is a new physics unknown to man there is essentially no way for aliens to visit the Earth.  If you accept physics as we know it- then there are too few nearby stars for there to be a high probability for the development of technologically sophisticated life forms.  <br>  <br>  Consider this: if the sun were about the size of a golf ball, 1 inch in diameter, the closest approach between Earth and Mars would be about four and a half feet and the orbit of Neptune would be 300 feet away.  At that scale the NEAREST star would be 461 MILES away.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Lightly grilled they are wonderful with chips.|`|sJegUB11aa	I think it's vastly likely that intelligent aliens exist somewhere else in the universe.<br>  <br>  I doubt very much that any of them have ever been to Earth.

FvoxgjbJaa	In plants the hormone auxin can affect different parts of the plant in different ways: it promotes initiation of branch root primordia, stimulates cell division in the vascular cambium and inhibits the abcission of leaves. So we can see that different cells respond in different ways to the same plant hormone.<br>  <br>  Hormones in animals that affect target cells in more than one organ have an effect on the target cells such that the same overall effect is accomplished. For instance PTH can affect target cells in the bone and kidneys with the same overall effect to increase calcium in body fluids.
RgSCstkAaa	The anatomical name for a vein which drains into a capillary system is portal vein. The most familiar portal vein is the hepatic portal vein, which receives blood from the veins draining the gut and the spleen and drains into the liver. However, this is not the only one. There is another portal vein at the base of the brain, running between the hypothalamus and the anterior (front) portion of the pituitary gland.|`|AA12266052	I can't find a specific answer to your question. <br>  Portal vein (common name)-a short, thick trunk formed by the union of superior mesentric and splenic vv behind the neck of pancreas; it ascends to right end of porta hepatis, where it divides into successively small branches, following branches of hepatic artery, until it forms a capillary like system of sinusoids that permeates entire substance of liver.<br>  In the case of portal vein, blood flows through the liver to form hepatic vein and thus joins inferior vena cava. But in the case of cirrhosis patients, portal venous blood bypasses the liver to join venules in the esophagus and joins directly to inferior vena cava. The portal venous pressure is high and blood pressure in inferior vena cava is low. This causes the capillaries in the esophagus to dilate causing esophageal varices.|`|EQz7DDsEaa	the veins in your body get smaller and smaller into arterioles and capillaries|`|bbc411996e4ce78be28c880823cac5b8aa	Portal vein runs between 2 capillary beds, but you need to go back and study your anatomy because "veins" do not "open into the heart"|`|OxqpSpGGaa	Actually it goes Artery (oxygenated, from heart), arteriole, capillary, venule, vein (deoxygenated, to heart) as I recall. <br>   Can't find proof for my theory but I suspect the answer to your question is either a) kidneys, the body's refuse treatment station or b) the heart. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ozmKAveYaa	The VENULE connects the VEIN to the capillaries, this is where gaseous exchange takes place as the ARTERIOLES connect the ARTERY to the capillaries<br>  <br>  And the VENA CAVA (largest vein) connects the the heart|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Veins all return blood toward the heart.  Each capillary has an arterial side, where blood comes into the capillary, and a venous side, where blood is directed toward a venule, which is a tiny vein that leads to a larger vein.  Venules terminate when they open into in larger veins, and the larger veins direct blood to the vena cava.  The vena cava is the largest vein, and collects blood from all of the veins that bring blood back to it from all of the organ systems of the body (except lungs).  The vena cava then directs the blood back into the right atrium of the heart.  The blood is then circulated through the lungs, and returns through pulmonary veins directly to the left atrium of the heart (not the vena cava) after picking up oxygen. <br>  <br>  The answer to your question is venules.....and they are not thought of as opening up into capillaries so much as opening out away from capillaries, since they direct the blood back out of the capillaries to be returned toward the heart..|`|79Hexe9Haa	Are you thinking of the hepatic portal vein?

70cf63c745874c449067b760725961e9aa	One thermometer is called dry bulb thermometer and the other one is called wet bulb thermometer.The difference between the two indicates the degree of saturation of the air. The value of relative humidity and the dew point temperature can be calculated from their readings.The greater the difference,the more the air is unsaturated or lower the relative humidity and vice versa.When the air becomes saturated,both the readings will be the same.<br>  Atmospheric air is generally unsaturated and the  temperature recorded by the dry bulb thermometer is the free air temperature.Cooling this air (using muslin cloth wrapped over the bulb and dipped in a store of water),by evaporating water into it ,is possible upto the limit of saturation and this temperature is the wet bulb temperature.Once the saturation is reached,evaporation stops and hence the cooling also ceases.Therefore,for an unsaturated air,the wet bulb temperature is lower than the dry bulb temperature.So,the differnce is purposely created to know the relative humidity and dew point.|`|UFteXlqwaa	Ah, a sling psychrometer! I haven't seen meteorologist using that for years!

xIisVcLTaa	This involves the principle of superposition. Which essentially says that if you stack waves in the same space, they will add together to produce a "sum" wave. <br>  <br>  Now if waves arrive at a particular point lined up, they are said to be in phase, and will add "constructively". This constructive interference produces a greater amplitude of wave. In this example, we could say that the waves sound louder than they would at some other point in the room. This is actually observed (or heard, as it were) in some famous cathedrals which names escape me at the moment, where you can hear a person whisper across the large room. <br>  <br>  Conversely, if waves arrive at a point out of alignment, they are said to be out of phase, and will add "destructively" (as a positive plus a negative). This has the effect of canceling amplitude of the wave, and if the phase difference is such that they are completely out of phase, the waves will cancel each other completely (provided they are equal in amplitude or in our case, come from the same sound source). In this case, no sound would be heard when listening at this point.|`|sCehoTIsaa	Is this to do with the deflection of the wave through a slit? if it is then if a slit separation and wavelength are similar, then maximum diffraction occurs thus sound is heard all round, if the wavelength and slit separation are different then minimum diffraction occurs thus dead spots will occur in the room.|`|t9iWZmmQaa	If waves bouncing off walls meet out of phase and with equal amplitude then they will exactly cancel and at that point you won't hear any sound.
G5QC5f5baa	I assume that “Synchronous drives” refers to synchronous motors. Very small single-phase synchronous motors used to be very common in electric clocks and in the electric timers used in dishwashers, laundry washers and in many other applications. Small to medium sized synchronous motors have also been used in industrial applications where speed must remain constant when the load changes or where two or more motors must operate at exactly the same speed. Since the required performance can be achieved with adjustable speed motor controls using tachometer feedback synchronous motors are used more often where tachometer feedback is difficult or expensive such as in certain types of synthetic fiber spinning applications.<br>  <br>  In large sizes, synchronous motors are less expensive and more efficient than induction motors. Since the physical size of a motor is determined more by its torque rating that its power rating, there is a rule of thumb that says that a synchronous motor should be used when the power rating in horsepower exceeds the speed rating in RPM. Thus a synchronous motor would be selected for a 2000 Hp 1800 RPM requirement or a 600 Hp 500 RPM requirement. <br>  <br>  Since pumps are one of the most common applications motors and since pumps can be built in very large sizes, synchronous motors are often used to drive them. Many industries use large synchronous motor driven pumps. Examples include sewage and fresh water pumps, oil pipeline pumps, pumps used in the pulp and paper industry, feed-water and cooling-water pumps in power plants and many others. Synchronous motors are also used for large fans and compressors in various industries. Other types of equipment driven by large synchronous motors include wood chippers and grinders in pulping mills, rock crushers, rubber mixers and mining shovels.

gReXjl6Kaa	Buffer capacity depends on the concentrations of the components of the buffer.<br>  The greater the concentrations of the conjugate acid-base pair, the greater the buffer capacity.<br>  A buffer consists of a solution of a weak acid (base) and the salt of weak acid (base). The addition of either acid or base converts acid (base) to the acid (base) salt, or the salt back to acid (base) when another acid or base is added to the solution.<br>  If there is not enough buffer present compared to the added acid or base, the buffer can be swamped, and the pH will change significantly. So it is only partially true that the buffer is independent of the buffer concentration.<br>  If the amount of acid or base added, is small compared to the buffer concentration then the pH is not sensitive to the amount of buffer present.<br>  The buffer concentration must be sufficiently larger than the amount of acid or base being added.<br>  The capacity of the buffer is determined by the actual amounts of acid and salt.<br>  <br>  a comprehensive explanation:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solution" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solu...</a>

Once their genetic material is in a host cell, they either choose to go into a lytic or lysogenic phase. <br>  <br>  In lytic phase they'll multiply using the host cell's enzymes, and eventually destroy the host cell; whereas in the lysogenic phase they'll integrate with the host cell's DNA and be replicated with each division of the host cell, but they'll be in a quiescent state.<br>  <br>  Peace :)

aiH9WmnKaa	Decide Which Variation Diagrams to Plot<br>  <br>  Obviously, variation diagrams are alot more useful than looking at tables of whole-rock data from a suite of samples. At the same time, the proper use of variation diagrams is definitely an acquired skill. To the practiced eye, they not only display the range of petrologic variation, but they may also convey important clues about geochemical and petrogenetic processes. At the same time, variation diagrams have important limitations. The mere presence of a well-correlated trend on a variation diagram is usually not enough to uniquely identify a particular geochemical process. Stated another way, similar trends may result from more than one process. In the absence of unambiguous interpretations from major-element variation diagrams, additional data (e.g., trace-elements, rare-earth elements, and isotopes) may help discriminate between processes.<br>  <br>  For a good discussion of variation diagrams, please consider reading p. 66-84 in Rollinson (1993) or p. 136-140 in Winter (2001) . For a web-based resource, consider downloading the Chapter 8 PowerPoint lecture in John Winter's Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology Class Materials (more info) . <br>  Getting started<br>  To some extent, the choice of which variation diagrams to plot depends on what specific petrologic questions (hypotheses) you are asking of the data. On the other hand, you will usually need to see some data plotted up before you can start formulating those petrologic questions and hypotheses in the first place. So don't worry that you don't yet know what the diagrams will be used for. Plot a bunch of them up that share the same variable on the x-axis as a place to start. You can always plot additional or more useful diagrams later. <br>  What goes on the x-axis?<br>  An important aspect of igneous suites (magmas presumably related in origin) is their range of chemical variation. This fundamental observation places limitations on the petrologic process(es) which could explain the origin of the suite. For the purpose of this exercise, we are mainly interested in comparing the petrologic ranges of the Yellowstone and Crater Lake datasets. To do this, we will need some indicator of petrologic variability to plot on the x-axis. Normally, the oxide that displays the greatest absolute range is chosen, and for most rocks, that oxide is SiO2. However, you should know that there are some graphical problems that result from choosing an oxide as abundant as SiO2 usually is in most rocks [Rollinson, 1993] . An alternative oxide to consider plotting on the x-axis is MgO. <br>  A list of suggested diagrams to plot<br>  For starters, I suggest making the following major-element variation diagrams for each caldera complex. <br>  SiO2 and/or MgO vs. TiO2 <br>  SiO2 and/or MgO vs. Al2O3 <br>  SiO2 and/or MgO vs. FeOT <br>  SiO2 vs. MgO <br>  SiO2 and/or MgO vs. CaO <br>  SiO2 and/or MgO vs. Na2O <br>  SiO2 and/or MgO vs. K2O <br>  SiO2 and/or MgO vs. P2O5 <br>  as well as a few variation diagrams using trace-element data... <br>  SiO2 and/or MgO vs. Rb <br>  SiO2 and/or MgO vs. Sr <br>  SiO2 and/or MgO vs. Ba <br>  Save yourself some time!<br>  Once you have made the first variation diagram, copy and paste to efficiently create new diagrams with similar size and formatting. Change the series and axis titles on each individually.

And here it is (be warned its a LITTLE complicated):<br>  <br>  First, we do some manipulation with sec x by multiplying the numerator and denominator by (secx + tanx). <br>  We will get secx(secx+tanx) / (secx+tanx).<br>  Next, we expand: (sec^2 x + secxtanx) / (secx + tanx).<br>  <br>  Then we do a substitution: u = secx + tanx.<br>  This means that du= (secxtanx + sec^2x)dx. (Remember that the derivative of secx is secxtanx, and the derivative of tanx is sec^2x).<br>  And now look! your denominator is u, and your numerator is du!<br>  <br>  This means integral(secx)dx = integral( (sec^2 x + secxtanx) / (secx + tanx). dx = integral( du / u ) = integral (1/u) du.<br>  <br>  And of course, we know that the integral of 1/u is ln |u| + C<br>  <br>  Substituting u= secx + tanx back, we have ln lsec x + tan xl + C.<br>  <br>  Whew!

TMB4d3FAaa	Non vegetable food is necessary for the procreation of  our greater ape cousins. Males in captivity were unable to produce viable sperm to impregnate female mates until they had some non vegetable protein.<br>  Goodall and others were intrigued by the observations of the great Apes collectively hunting, killing and eating monkeys and other small animals on occasion.  Nutritionists at the zoos experimented feeding meat to some of the non productive apes.  Most that had previously been unable to successfully mate, began producing progeny.. It appears males need the meat more than the females. Human studies are limited.  With a lot of the prior studies, both here in America and under the Nazis in WW2, this type of human study is often frowned upon. Because we are thinking animals with a free will. We can decide to not eat meat. if these studies were valid for humans as well as the great Apes, what would you say to your vegan offspring who was sterile?  Would this be a form of birth control?  What if vegans ate meat and still couldn't produce children. As individuals we can survive as vegans, but. can we survive as a race as vegans?|`|sbB0TpGXaa	We are omnivores.

It requires extreme stamina, tracking skills, and the ability to deduce which way the prey went when its trail is lost.   watch it on youtube.<br>  <br>  The last idea I want to leave you with is that children need the extra protein for normal development.

That can be your choice. Since, explanation required needs it scientifically, let me explain.<br>  <br>  1.  If you  consider the evolutionary pattern, our cousins like chimp.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/apes/chimp/" rel="nofollow">http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subject...</a><br>  <br>  They are basically omnivores, means they eat both. Man should also be one among them.<br>  <br>  2. Consider the dentition of human beings. First if you see the dentition of carnivores, they have well developed canine for shearing the meat.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.coryi.org/images/DCP01019.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.coryi.org/images/DCP01019.JPG</a><br>  <br>  When you have a look at the dentition of herbivore such as cow, you can see that canine is absent though it is present in some herbivores for defence like in hippo. However, note that an hippo can eat flesh!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.co.in/imgres?imgurl=http://www.d91.k12.id.us/skyline/teachers/robertsd/cow1.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.d91.k12.id.us/skyline/teachers/robertsd/cow.htm&usg=__cDV8ixgdz27Pg8XxPGMUFfvbGPc=&h=344&w=544&sz=24&hl=en&start=18&um=1&tbnid=fv68CBeySeidrM:&tbnh=84&tbnw=133&prev=/images%3Fq%3Ddentition%2Bin%2Bcow%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DG" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.co.in/imgres?imgurl...</a><br>  <br>  When you look at the dentition of human being it is obvious it is neither  .<br>  This again shows that man is an omnivore.<br>  <br>  3. When you consider a herbivores stomach and intestine, they have large stomach ( in cow 4 chambered and in horse single) and the length of the intestine is very large (about 20 times its length) and in the man it is only about 6 times while in big cats it is about 4 times. again, we can see why we are omnivorous.<br>  <br>  4. If you look at the cellulose digesting ability, it is only with herbivores and we cannot do that. <br>  <br>  These clearly indicate that we are omnivores than pure herbivore or carnivores.|`|FS0tDjHZaa	Humans are neither of them, they are omnivorous,ie, they can eat both veg and non-veg.<br>   Though every human can not eat flesh but those who can it is essential for them because it contains lot of carbohydrates,vitamins,calcium etc.<br>  which helps body to maintain its fitness.|`|5oWcj4bKaa	why a tiger or a lion can not eat plants or leaves<br>  because it's teeth & digestive system is made to eat only flesh.<br>  same is with cows or goats, their digestive system & teeth is adapted to eat grass & leaves only.<br>  <br>  human body can eat both ,thus it is a carnivore & a herbivore both<br>  why god has made us like this<br>  why our teeth can chew both the type of veg. & our system can treat(digest) both type of food<br>  <br>  so, why are u asking that non veg is essential for us or not.<br>  if ur talking because for the animal right.......if u care for their pain, may i tell u then one should not eat herbies too becuase acording to a new science plants feel pain & they cry or enjoys too.|`|xmORjfD0aa	human can eat both veg and non veg food so we human are omnivorous. <br>  no non veg food is not essential for us because the proteins we obtain from animal meat can also be acquired from veg food specially dal, soybean.<br>  the type of food one eat depends on the animals teeth types.|`|Cpi8QyV8aa	Human beings are omnivores.Non-veg food it is not very essential.

2aVe3kbOaa	I've taught mathematics for 20 years,  I teach from very low levels to very high levels, a different kind of anxiety in the higher level than the lower level.<br>  <br>  At the lower level the fine line between motivated and overmotivated is really important.  You cannot be in protect mode and growth mode at the same time*.  IOW fear causes a restriction of blood to the higher-level thinking part of your brain, and it makes it very hard to do math.  <br>  Here's a few very simple things you can do to overcome this, and this works for stress in general:<br>  <br>  1) try to learn to "like" math,  learn to develop a very child like curiosity towards why and how math works, including concepts about infinity, like how big are some of the biggest numbers?? is their such a thing as some of the biggest numbers??  same kind of thoughts about the smallest numbers??  Try to find a book by Ian Stewart called "cabinet of mathematical curiosities" <br>  <br>  2.) think funny thoughts-  notice things that really make you laugh, or really make you smile, really amuse you, use the anxiety as a cue to think of those things.  <br>  Students learn so much better when I start a class with a joke.<br>  <br>  3.)  Learn how to breathe, this will increase the amount of oxygen that gets to the cerebral part of your brain, its amazing what just one deep breath can do.<br>  <br>  4)  keep it simple-- don't go ahead until you've completely processed and understand how somethin works,  I realize in our current system of math education this can be almost impossible, since inquiry is not encouraged, and most of the time almost discouraged, but if you can find time to do this, you can make it simple, and keep it simple, and understanding makes it a lot more fun.<br>  <br>  Laugh (to yourself) at the people who are willing to do ANYTHING without understanding, they end up in Calculus without a clue as to how this all really works.<br>  <br>  Don't take anything personal, what other people say is about them.<br>  Remember, you are enough.  the sky wont fall if you forget that 9x6=54<br>  <br>  and remember their are three kinds of people in the world, those who can count, and those who can't.  :)

aBqFMMWnaa	No.  Both the Kuiper Belt and the Asteroid Belt bodies are bits left over from the formation of the early Solar System.  It should also be noted that the Asteroid Belt contains only about 4% of the mass of our Moon.  By the way, the depiction of asteroids in the Star Wars movies is a bit of cinematic license.  The Millenium Falcon would have no problem negotiating the Asteroid Belt or the Kuiper Belt, and could be considered unlucky if they so much as saw an asteroid!  In fact, many deep-space probes have passed through the Asteroid Belt on their way to the outer planets with no problem at all.|`|FoL7ENdnaa	Maybe a aplanet that never formed|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	Neither the asteroid belt objects, nor the Kuiper Belt objects came from any planet.

QPWjtDzcaa	Dark matter is "matter" that can only be detected by the gravitational influence that holds certain galaxy clusters together.  Some emerging anomalies in certain situations, however, might mean we have to "come up with a new physics" to explain certain aspects of physics altogether.  <br>  <br>  Do a wikipedia search of:<br>  Fly-by anomaly<br>  Pioneer anomaly<br>  <br>  So *maybe* there is no actual dark matter, and it's something as simple and as complex as "our current physics of understanding the model of gravity is not quite accurate."<br>  <br>  Then again, there really could be dark matter out there.  There are lots of things in the universe that don't emit visible light, IR, UV, and other portions of the EM spectrum, and many that do, but do so in very faint (and potentially undetectable) magnitudes.<br>  <br>  Dark energy probably would give us a better understanding of the Big Bang than dark matter does...  and it is the mystery of dark energy which will likely determine the "fate of the universe."  So to speak.<br>  <br>  Will we have a Big Rip?  Big Crunch?  Heat death?  Big Chill?  The jury is still out on that one, as understanding dark energy is still in its infancy.|`|77cb033374598e8c10938763c9fe03f7aa	Dark matter was invented to explain something that may not exist.<br>    A rotating galaxy spins in such a way that the outer edge is locked in step with the galactic center in violation of Newton's laws.<br>    A galaxy is made up of satellite systems but is not a satellite system itself,so a galaxy is capable of being what it is without the intervention of dark matter.|`|zekneLdSaa	There are many possibilities, and to be honest I have done a lot of research and nobody actually knows a lot.  Here are a few of the many discovered ideas, which are pursued by scientists. Here are some ideas what dark matter really is: <br>   - Normal matter which has so far eluded our gaze, such as: <br>   - dark galaxies <br>   - brown dwarfs <br>   - planetary material (rock, dust, etc.) <br>   - Massive Standard Model neutrinos.  If some of the neutrinos are massive, then this could be the unaccounted mass.  <br>  <br>  Hope this this helpful.|`|NbdTgyLPaa	Basically dark matter is believed to exist because without it we can't explain the way the galaxies are moving.  For instance, they form clusters that, based on our estimates of the mass of the stars and the gases, should just fly apart.  Dark matter is still theory, as there may be some other explanation for this.|`|kV9GlWDFaa	Dark matter is so to speak the invisable glue that holds everything together. Whole clusters and galaxies. yes it is theory but scientist are trying to prove its existance. you can study more about this i learned a little something something from a special that the history channel did on all this i bet you can youtube that **** right on up!!! <br>  enjoy yo self bitches!!!|`|gLp7pvPnaa	We can deduce, rather than see dark matter exists. It's the best explanation for why galaxies appear to revolve more like a CD (i.e. all together), than at varying speeds like a planetary system. The dark matter is necessary to provide the extra gravity thought to cause this rotational effect. Wikipedia explains dark matter and dark energy very well and is well worth reading.

Because the hollow cylinder has all its mas concentrated far away from its center of mass, it has a higher moment of inertia and takes longer to start rolling. <br>  <br>  The solid cylinder has a more even mass distribution and specifically less rotational inertia than the hollow sphere. It will therefore get to the bottom first.|`|Yy4Vb65saa	the one that is heavier will reach the bottom first.... i think....

4fWZL4TRaa	It is best to use tables (lists) from the manufacturer of the particular cable. You can probably find them on the internet, or the supplier. The tables will have different ratings for different situations, like single cable, several cables bunched together, buried, open air or on a cable tray etc. The rating is determined by the insulation of the cable. Some plastic insulation may work up to 75C, some 105C and so on. I think you can also say that very few are intended to work in the full sun on a hot day without further derating..<br>  <br>  With some electrical wiring such as household lighting and wall outlets, the cables may be specified by the electrical regulations. For example, certain types of circuit use a certain size and type of cable (and fuse) written in the regulations. For example, TPS (twin plastic sheath) in Australia.<br>  <br>  With distribution cables the cable size is more likely determined by voltage drop, so will be bigger than the current rating. The maximum allowable voltage drop may be determined by regulations too, but typically 3-5%.<br>  <br>  How would it be calculated?<br>  You can calculate the power according to the material for just a bare wire, then attempt to make that work by determining the heat flow to get the temperature rise for the situation. FIrst get the resistance  using the specific resistance (resistance per cross sectional area) to get the resistance for a length, or else the current rating for a bare wire is given in wire tables for different wire gauges.<br>  <br>  Now use Ohms law to determine the voltage drop with a given current, then calculate the power, and use heat flow formulae with the ambient temperature, and so on to try to determine the temperature rise. This temperature rise calculation is involved, and easy to get wrong, unless you know the thermal properties of the electrical insulation.<br>  <br>  That is why the cable rating is provided by the manufacturer, for several representative situations. It would make sense to determine it empirically, by measuring the current that has an effect on the insulation on a hot day, such as start to soften, and keep below that to allow for manufacturing tolerance.<br>  <br>  The link below has data sheets for certain cables.

So Nitrogen has slight positive charge and the ring has slight negative charge (2.26 D).<br>  but in Piperidine the ring is saturated with hydrogen, so there is no need for the free electron pair of Nitrogen and the separation of the charges is less.

aO3BCQAnaa	The question is how many adults and how many children went to whatever.<br>  <br>  So you know 96 people went. That means that between the number of adults and the number of children there, the total was 96. <br>  <br>  So: adults + children = 96<br>  <br>  Next, we know that there was a total of $180 made. So if one adult is worth 3 dollars and one child is 1 dollar then the amount of money made depends on how many children and adults went. (for example, 2 adults and one child is worth $7 and 1 adult and two children is worth $5) We can represent that like this:<br>  <br>  ($3 x adults) + ($1 x children) = $180<br>  <br>  now just say x=number of adults and y= number of children<br>  <br>  so, we have x+y= 96<br>  and 3x+y=180<br>  <br>  I now want to combine the two to find a solution. If I express them in the form of y=something and y=whatever, then I can say whatever = something (because if they're both equal to y, they're equal. dig it?)<br>  <br>  So, in the first, I subtract x from both sides to get:<br>  <br>  x+y-x=96-x ===> y=96-x<br>  and the second:<br>  3x+y-3x=180-3x ====> y=180-3x<br>  <br>  now combining the two, we can say that:<br>  96-x=180-3x<br>  <br>  First, I would add 3x to both sides making<br>  96+2x=180<br>  and then subtracting 96 I would get:<br>  2x=84<br>  <br>  And if 2x is 84 then x must be 42... which means that there must have been 42 adults. and if there were 42 adults and 96 tickets sold, there must have been 54 children.<br>  <br>  but don't take my word for it, check it for yourself.|`|sTGKWrJTaa	a = number of adult tickets sold<br>  c = number of childrens' tickets sold<br>  3a + 1c = 180<br>  a+c = 96<br>  <br>      3a + 1c = 180<br>  - (a + c   = 96)<br>   2a =84<br>  ________<br>      2<br>  <br>  a= 42<br>  <br>  42 + c = 96<br>  - 42      -42<br>   c = 54<br>  <br>  42 adult tickets, 54 childrens tickets|`|1U2BQYZhaa	2 equations 2 unknowns.<br>  <br>  X + Y = 96<br>  3X + Y = 180<br>  <br>  solve|`|AA10969890	assume x for adults and y for children. so:<br>  <br>  x + y =96<br>  <br>  3x + y = 180<br>  <br>  sub (eqn2 - eqn1):<br>  <br>  2x = 84 -------> x = 42 adults<br>  and y = 54 children|`|kx72wqp3aa	Let no. of tickets sold for adults be x and children be y.<br>  x  + y = 96…eq (1)<br>  3x + 1y = 180…eq (2)<br>  We will solve this equation using elimination method.<br>  Multiply eq (1) by 3.<br>  3x + 3y = 288…eq (3)<br>  Subtracting equation (2) and (3),<br>  -2y = -108<br>  y = 108/2 = 54<br>  Substituting y in eq (1)<br>  x + y = 96<br>  x + 54 = 96<br>  x = 96-54 = 42<br>  <br>  No. of adult tickets sold = 42<br>  No. of children tickets sold = 54
GhVAFsQGaa	I have done a lot of electrical work as an Industrial Maintenance Mechanic and have always relied on "UGLY's" book of electrical knowledge to figure that out. Carrying capacity is based on more than just MIL size ( cross sectional area) and the ugly's electrical reference is good enough for building code compliance. You can get them at nearly any building, or electrical supply, maybe even online,,, Don't do electrical without it. Cya

zFsTSrOcaa	They sound like ant larvae or pupae.  You may have found a colony of ants that is moving to a new home, and adult ants will carry the young along with them.<br>  <br>  Standard ant traps or baits usually work well, but if they're headed under the house you may never see them again.|`|uPVnqbE8aa	If the eggs are white they are probably the eggs of the Ants themselves.  They are most likely carrying them from one place to another.  There is an egg chamber where the queen has laid most of them, and if that chamber gets disturbed the workers will move the eggs.<br>  Or, they could be the eggs of Termites, and the ants are carrying them away as food.<br>  Or, they could possibly be the eggs of some other kind of insect, like Cockroaches, but those eggs are pretty large and brown and in a case with lots of others. <br>  Even the cleanest houses can have insects.  The point is, are they "harmful" insects, like Termites, Wood Ants, or Cockroaches?  If they are, then I would suggest an exterminator.|`|ad6YgqZlaa	call pest control! try and stop them gettin anywhere else in the house|`|HrQDQvUUaa	They are ant eggs, the ants are taking their unborn young to a safer place. It has nothing to do with anything being unclean, it sounds as if they built a nest there for some reason.<br>  <br>  Get some diatomaceous earth (it is a white powder, you can find it at plant nurseries) and sprinkle it where you see ants. It is environmentally harmless, but it gets in their joints and acts like razors. It will get rid of them.|`|AA10297143	Agreeing with the forum, you need to eradicate the "nest", as this is an infestation of ants trying to turn your bathroom into their home and nursery.  An exterminator may be your best option to ensure you get the entire ant trail.  Good luck.|`|mt81CABQaa	during these time , ants normally try to get more food reserve for them and for the colony and the white things u are seeing r the eggs , they are conducting a new colony . try to control them with some insect killers or u will have to spend some sleepless nights in the future .
9v31wUz1aa	Energy dissipated in a resistor is I^2 *R.<br>  So you need to find current<br>  49 = I^2 *4<br>  I^2 = 49/4<br>  I = root 49/4 = 7/2<br>  V= IR = 7/2 *4 = 14volts|`|HrQDQvUUaa	If I'm understanding this correctly, the solution would be the arrangement of Ohm's Law that states that power (watts) equals the square of the current multiplied by the resistance. <br>  <br>  So the current must be 3.5 amps (3.5 squared (equals 12.25) times 4 ohms equals 49 watts). Taking the square root of 12.25 gives the original current value of 3.5 amps.<br>  <br>  Therefore taking 3.5 amps and multiplying times 4, you get a voltage of 14 volts

FiDcOMgxaa	A mitochondrion contains outer and inner membranes composed of phospholipid bilayers and proteins.    The outer mitochondrial membrane, which encloses the entire organelle, has a protein-to-phospholipid ratio similar to that of the eukaryotic plasma membrane (about 1:1 by weight). It contains large numbers of integral proteins called porins.     The inner mitochondrial membrane contains proteins ;It contains more than 100 different polypeptides, and has a very high protein-to-phospholipid ratio (more than 3:1 by weight, which is about 1 protein for 15 phospholipids). The inner membrane is home to around 1/5 of the total protein in a mitochondrion. In addition, the inner membrane is rich in an unusual phospholipid, cardiolipin.     The matrix is the space enclosed by the inner membrane. It contains about 2/3 of the total protein in a mitochondrion.The matrix contains a highly-concentrated mixture of hundreds of enzymes, special mitochondrial ribosomes, tRNA, and several copies of the mitochondrial DNA genome.     Mitochondria have their own genetic material, and the machinery to manufacture their own RNAs and proteins.
AA11889815	You say the lot is heavily wooded, and I assume you will leave it so, otherwise you probably wouldn't have bought it. Tree roots will always be a problem for you if you go underground. Both now during installation, and later as the roots grow back. There is  a small trencher made for just such an application, but again the root problem will affect both the digging and the laying of the cable. Another way would be to build your driveway first because you will have to remove trees, bushes, ect. and then lay it along the edge. Personally, I don't like buried electric lines. Once the drive was in, the pole trucks can maneuver on it. Only bad point I can think of with overhead lines is ice storms, both causing line failure and tree limbs falling on them. To answer your question about the width needed, it would depend on what machine (trencher) you choose to use.  A small "walk behind" can get by with 4-5' and is very maneuverable so allows you to work around larger trees, boulders, ect.|`|9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	Depending on how much you want to spend and who does it, you could go from almost no access to a lot - the poles are not only going to require access to put them in but clearing the trees along the wires.   As the first answer says, you could trench yourself or hire someone and they might take only the width of the tractor with the deep trenching arm (manual trenchers are narrower, but may not go deep enough to get the utility rules) and when a tricky situation arose, the tractor might go around, back in and continue the trench between a large rock and a tree that the tractor can't get between.    But a more costly solution (not do it yourself) would be to hire someone who can drill horizontally to put the pipe/conduit under trees without disturbing them.  I don't know the maximum length they can run, but 100 feet is easy (getting under intersections around here) and 200 or 300 might be possible.  You might also be able to trench in the easy parts with less cutting and drill across a tricky part like a heavily wooded hill.    Any chance you would build a super efficient house and use solar and wind to get off the grid?|`|jNKV10DLaa	My guess is that it depends a lot on your utility company.  Mine (in rural Arkansas) didn't have any specification as long as I had a trench dug (I believe it was 42 inches deep?) that met the requirements.  I still cleared an area about 10 feet on either side, but the utility didn't require this.
RfOLqUKlaa	Not unless you were looking directly down the beam. We only see the beam of a torch otherwise because of particles in the beam, eg dust, scattering the light. In the vacuum of space there is nothing there to scatter the light.|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	No. Contrary to what sci-fi movies (and ESA animations of the ATV) suggest, you can't see laser or light beams in space, unless you send them through a cloud of dust or gas. Without particles reflecting the light, you can't see the beam.     Just look at a Shuttle docking to the ISS - the flood lights on the Shuttle are bright, but create no visible light beams.|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	NO   there is nothing in space for the light can reflect off of.|`|T7b7tKvraa	sure, but you wont hear any sound.
