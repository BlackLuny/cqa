We were invited to our first Super Bowl party away from home.

I want to make something that can travel easy in the car. Minor finishing can be done at the house I'm going to.

A friend of mine told me that she was drinking with her bf and remembers having a bit of an argument and going to bed and finding him on the sofa in the morning. He told her that they argued and she tried kicking him out, but he didn't leave bc it wasn't safe cuz he was drinking. The next day she apologized to him for arguing with him. He told her that he didn't hold it against her bc she was drinking. My friend is a nice girl who doesn't have a drinking problem, but may have just had a bit too much that night. She and her bf stayed together after that and were happy together. One day they had an argument and he posted something on the internet saying that she blacked out that night and kicked, punched and spit on him and that she threw up and he had to clean up after her. Why would he do such a thing? Wouldn't my friend remember if she got THAT sick? Her bf was cool with her for weeks b4 he posted that stuff on the internet..What do you think?

20090131110457AAeVfRG	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	I'm sick of ordering pizza when they come over?	Okay, so my boyfriend and I are friends with another couple. It started as my boyfriend being friends with his co worker. When we all hung out a few months ago his girlfriend and I got along really well.       We're 21 years old and we recently bought a condo. They've come over a handful of times. The first few times we'd order a pizza and have a few drinks. We rented a movie once, played a board game once...       The last time they came over I wanted to skip the pizza. Since we have it at our house, we usually supply the food. They've deff chipped in a lot though bringing the drinks and a few times bringing over some chips and stuff. They never come empty handed...they're great guests.      This last time they came over I put out a fruit platter, a veggie platter, cheese and crackers, and chips. The boys were hungry for FOOD though (i have to admit, so was I), and they ran to a bar down the street to pick up some wings.       The problem is that neither of us girls would eat wings on a bone (I'll only eat them boneless)...          Any ideas as far as food-food goes??
