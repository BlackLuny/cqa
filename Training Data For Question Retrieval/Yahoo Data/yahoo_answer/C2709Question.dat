20090306173746AAKHFNn	Pets;Horses	I was volunteering at a horse farm today, and i need some help!?	I was volunteering, cleaning up the barn, ect, ect.  This beautiful filly had crooked legs (beautiful other than that) and everyone there hates her.   I asked why, and they said "she was an accident.  The stallion escaped and bred her" I said (in a non-nagging voice) "I don't see how this is her fault."   they simply shrugged, said "she's the foal, and she is horrible."   I later on saw her being led around, lunged, ect.   Her (right hind) crooked leg was bothering her.  She limped at the trot.  If she didn't step as well as she usually did (which wasn't great) then they would either yell, or snap a whip at her.   Is this cruel?   Also, she is for sale.   I have fallen in love with her (she's sweet.  she's so gentle, great personality) and I know I wouldn't be able to ride her.   She's young, is it possible that she might grow out of this, or is it permanent (i know, hard for you to tell without a video, but have you experienced this and if so, what was the outcome of it?)   so, my main question.  Is this (if i bought her) rewarding them for their non-existant heart?  is it worth buying her?  She's an arab, if that helps any.   feel free to ask for any more informatioin, I'd give it to you.   I cannot provide pictures, this farm is 45 minutes away.   =]   NO rude comments, yes I am experienced, have the ability to care for her, know where to keep  her, ect.   Thanks in advance.

20090306214329AAWUwZK	Pets;Horses	I am definitely dying for your opinions?	I've decided I will get a horse of some Draugt breeding, probably a Clydie. No bigger than 16hh, but I will be moving up from a 13.1hh Welshie. I've never had a problem with height but I'm 5ft 2" (almost).      I've had quite a lot of experience, I just decided I want some height (compensation maybe) and hot blooded breeds and speed just do nothing for me. I also have a knack for being different, but I'm interested in the horse itself.      I'd just like your opinion, for a bit of fun, do you think this could be a bit silly? Just to look?       I'm responsible enough to not take on a horse too much for me.      As I always remind people, if you don't have something nice (well, constructive) to say, please just spare it.

20090306211559AAyBpak	Pets;Horses	Please Help Colic Question!?	This morning went to go feed my horse as usual she was alert,hungry,etc. I gave her, her normal feed, her beet pulp, one flake of grass hay and one flake of alfalfa hay. In the afternoon I came and let her out of her stall and mucked it (Took me about two hours lol) put fresh clean shavings in, put her back in her stall because of the weather gave her an extra flake of grass hay to keep her busy (Like I always do) she drank her water and I filled her bucket back up before I left. Anyway a few hours later went to go feed for the night, found my horse with a swollen belly, I took her out of her stall she did not seem in any pain and kept trying to go to the food, I put her back in her stall and she was looking for food, then she started to kick up at her stomach and was about to lay down, but went back up. You could tell she was rolling in her stall before I got there because of shavings were all over her. I called the vet and he said to give her banamine (Which i had) and she was all loopy (Banamine was mixed with rompun) I left her for about an hour and came back and she was back to normal looking for hay (Still bloated though) She had good gut sounds and did not try to go down or show any pain. I took her and my other horse in the lighted arena for about two hours just watching, she was jogging around and went poop,pee,passing gas. Put her back in her stall and searching for hay although i am kinda scared to feed her the vet said to wait 24 hrs after colic. It has been about 5 hours and she seems fine her bloated tummy has gone down. Do you think she will be ok for the night she is passing manure and gas.       Also could of this caused her to colic?    It has recently been very warm about 65 degrees nice and sunny, today it snowed and went down to 30s could that be a cause?

20090306220833AAiLIl8	Pets;Cats	My cat just gave birth today....Can I do anything?	Well, my cat had her kittens today. She was a small cat so we were worried about her giving birth. But sure enough when I got home today, she was a little wet, and we soon heard tiny meows! At first, we thought she only had 3, and then when we lifted the couch (where she had birth, and she soon moved the three to a little niche I made for her), we saw that one had passed away. It was a very large kitten, he looked healthy, so we weren't really sure why. She ended up giving birth to one more about an hour or so later.      My question really is: Since my female cat is with her kittens in her little spot, should I do anything for her? Should I bring her some food and water by her spot? She is obviously tired, so I don't know if I should bring food to her or not? And is there anything else I can do for her? Should I make sure she cares for them? So far she has been purring every time we bend down to pet her (she is very affectionate! )Thanks so much for any information.

She just turned a year old and she chews on everything insight. I have been crate training her and she was doing well. So I decided to move her to a bigger area like my bathroom. Well she was fine for about a week and then she chewed through the plastic pipe on my toilet. Water was every were and it started to leak downstairs to my kitchen. She has also chewed through two of my comforter sets. She seems to destroy every single toy that I get her and she has several bones around and she chews on those but it doesn't seem that's enough. I do not wanna get rid of her but I just don't know what to do anymore. Please Help any guidance is great.

20090306211518AAvAWxi	Pets;Birds	My parakeet is acting really funny. Can somone experienced help me determine what the root cause could be?	I've had my parakeet for about 2 years now- he's very active and can say just about everything that we teach him. He's a cage bird only- we are too nervous about him getting stuck somewhere to let him fly free, so he doesn't get into anything at all that's not in the cage. Normally, he'll be perched relaxed, and either be "gurgling" - which is what we call it when he goes through a repertour of everything we've taught him - or he'll be be jumping from perch to perch to ring all his little bells we have...He's always excited when we see him or talk to him, and he'll protrude his chest out and stretch upward when he's getting ready to talk - like he's just sooo excited to see us :)       But for the past few days, he's clammed up almost completely. He really only talks a little at nighttime now, and instead of being extremely fluffed up, which I've read is a sign that birds are sick, he's got all of his feathers pulled in close- almost like he's been slicked down from head to toe- making him look very skinny. IS THIS NORMAL ? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ?      Also, he's very shakey and jittery. Like, when he's just sitting there, he'll be shakey, or you'll feel it when he sits on your finger. We DID take him to the local bird vet, because his feet were extremely warm and we thought he had a fever, but she said to make sure he's got plenty of food and water and that he'd be fine- she didn't give us any antibiotics like the last time he did this when I first got him.      I'm just not sure if anyone can tell me if this is normal behaviour or not?       Probably the MAIN thing that's bugging me is that instead of sitting relaxed and slightly poofed like he use to, it's like...his wings are spread constantly. I don't know how to describe it- they're not completely spread out like he's flying, just slightly held away from his body and they're tensed...      Any ideas???      Please - any specifics are appreciated- please don't just say YOUR BIRD IS SICK- because that's probably obvious. I'm just wondering if anyone else had a parakeet with similar symptoms- especially the wing thing.      Let me know!

20090306220535AA8GCiN	Pets;Dogs	My fear of dogs seems like the most unusual one. How do I rid myself of it?	Okay, I have had a dog when I was young (9 or 10) for about 3 months, and then I moved so it had to stay at my grandma's house. Now I am 20 and I have never been in contact with any other form of    animal since then, except of course, humans.       I just love dogs with a passion, but whenever I get close to one, I get overtaken by this uncontrollable amount of anxiety. For the most part I try to control that feeling and try to fake it to make the dog feel at ease. But once the dog starts to bark, I get shaken up and before I can get back into my senses, the dog engages itself in a barking drill and a few repetitions of growls.       My ears are also very sensitive to loud, unusual sounds. Since I haven't been around dogs for so long, their loud barks startle me and make my heart beat faster (if I'm close to one). I went to some shelters to help myself with this problem. I felt at ease with a dog that was very easy going. The dog that was hyper got me back into my anxious state, and once again was followed up by the episode that involved the dog's constant barking and growling.       I have never been attacked or chased by dogs, but I have this ridiculous fear if I am confronted by them. I have done all the research needed to understand the different body languages of dogs but obviously the answer is not there. How do I get over this? As of right now I am extremely desperate for help because I would love to own a dog.       For those that are interested in knowing what my favorite breed is: German Shepherd Dog (the dog from my childhood).      Thank you very much.

20090306224521AA5LwxL	Pets;Cats	Cats. Is there a physiological difference between spraying and peeing?	I have two good-natured cats - a male and a female, both desexed, approx age four years.  Just recently I've noticed that 'something' has been peeing and /or spraying up against an old wardbrobe in my enclosed lean-to at the back of my house. Each time I clean it up and wash the area with bleach, then a few days later it happens again. I'm 100% sure that no other animal is getting in from outside ie. a dog lifting its leg. So, I'm looking at one of the cats as the culprit. I was amazed at the height the stream reached. How can a cat reach up to spray at least a foot, if not more, in the air? The litter tray is regularly cleaned and both cats also have access to the garden during the day. The male cat wakes me up at 5am each day to go out - presumably to relieve himself! So why the need to pee up against the wardrobe? And why after all this time has this behaviour started? I'm dreading they will bring this behaviour inside the house.

20090307000657AAf6nUB	Pets;Dogs	My Female chihuahua whines and behavior has changed after buying toy?	Hello,      My female chihuahua 1 and a half years old has changed after I bought her a toy.      I bought her a small racoon toy called Skinneez Stuffing Free Dog Toy.  Which she has started to carry around everywhere by mouth. She cries when it's not beside her. She licks it and guards it, even to the point to where she will growl at my cat who she never used to growl at. She has started to whine alot, if she does not see it she will whine until I find it for her or she whines when ever I try calling her as if she does not want to leave the toy's side.      She never used to whine before.      I noticed she tries to hide it under my bed covers and sits on top of it and lays with it. She still chews and licks at it but she no longer tries to destroy it.      She has many toys. She usually destroys toys to the point to where they are unrecognizable and plays with the dismembered parts.       But lately I only see her playing with this toy, despite the fact that I bought her different toys. I buy her a new toy roughly 1 every 2 weeks usually.         It's starting to worry me because she has developed aggresive behavior towards my cat and my other older chihuahua who does not have interest in the toys at all.      This behavior has been occuring for roughly about 2-3 weeks since I gotten her that toy, and slowly has gotten worse. At first I thought it was cute and I was happy she enjoys her new toy, but the aggressive behavior that sprung from this toy has me worried??      Any suggestions or ideas why it would happen??   Have you ever experienced this before??

My dog got caught on the other side of the elevator it pulled him up and i heard him scream and then thud.  He was actually find after all of it when I got back down. I couldn't stop the elevator. I think the only reason he survived is because the elevator rode up to the 12th floor so eventually the leash had to snap, it wasn't strong enough to stop an elevator. How do you deal with traumas like these afterwards? I have complete and total anxiety, guilt and can't stop crying. He's fine and doesn't seem bothered by elevators regardless. He went to the vet and they said he was fine.

He looks terrible :( I don't understand what the problem is. I see him cleaning his feathers a lot, so I can't tell if he's pulling them out himself.       Since I'm away at college, I see him every other weekend; my mom takes care of him when I'm not home. I figured that maybe he was bored because I had noticed him pacing back and forth in a particular part of his cage. So I bought him a bunch of toys and hung them in his cage.      His name is Spaz (because he IS one) and he has been quite frightened by them, but I know it will take time to get used to. But I bought them 2 weeks ago, and now he looks worse. Do you think I put...too many toys in there? He has quite a big cage for just one keet. He used to have a mate but she died a few months ago.      He gets fed seeds and my mom buys him snacks on sticks (it keeps him quite busy). I don't give him much of anything else because he never eats anything else (such as vegetables, greens, or anything non-seed). I've tried but I'm afraid of it getting gross and it sitting in his cage for long periods of time.      Taking him to the vet is probably next to...out of the question. My dad just lost his job and we are extremely tight on money. I don't add vitamins to his water so I was wondering if maybe I should start? Or somebody may know something that I could buy in the store to help him?      Oh and he's got to be about...7-8+ years old now. His mate was about 10 before she passed.      Please help :(

Is there any topical creme I can put on it to help relieve the pain and swelling?  Maybe desitin or neosporin?  Something that won't poison him if he licks it off.  I know it's a gross question, but any info would help.  Thanks!
20090307002716AAic4hS	Pets;Fish	Transferring a fish from one tank to another?	We have a female freshwater cremsicle lyretail that we are thinking about transferring to our other fish tank to get her away from the male live bearer that keeps impregnating her.  We have had her well over a year.      This tank is a 29 gal. that only has two of her fry from a previous pregnancy that were born in October.  The current tank that she is in is a 55 gal.      We know obviously to put the fish in a bag with the current water and let the temperature adjust in the new tank.  What type of bag do the pet stores use?  I know it is a flimsy type of material that they are able to tie a knot in.           Are there any other safe ways to transfer a fish to another tank besides the pet store methods?

20090307122259AAt11vN	Pets;Cats	Are you prepared for *kitten season*?	I can see it happening right now.  Question after question about pregnant cats.  Soon the shelters will be exploding with kittens whose lives depend on finding a home.       Due to the economy, rescuers (myself included) are mostly full to capacity with animals and won't be able to save as many as in years past.  Last year I went to a shelter that had boxes of kittens stacked in the hallways waiting to be killed because they had run out of room. Is it really too much to ask for people to have their cats spayed/neutered?      Legit:  What made you decide to have your cat spayed/neutered?

But the problems are that 1) she has a hard time getting the correct lead in cantering when we are going counterclockwise i believe. I need help figuring out how to get on the right lead all the time, both ways for showing. 2) When we are getting ready to jump she gets so eager that she keeps bumping into the other horses and moving all around.

I just left it alone becuz i was scared of it i got it when i was about 12. Im 15 now and i have been training it becuz i was tired of never being able to take it out of the cage. I didnt think it was fair to have a bird locked in its cage its whole life. So iv been working with it for a few months now and now i am able to get it on my hand and finger no prblem and most the time itll let me pet it anywere but its stomach. But it bites constantly this is my problem i cant ever take it out of the cage becuz i think its cruel to clip its wings and im scared it will fly on me and bite me. It even bites my hand when i play with it so im forced to wear a glove always. So my question is how do i get it to stop biting and what should i do so i can take it out of the cage without giving it a heart attack.

I already own a pair of pretty nice, beige riding breeches that I wear for my lessons, but this summer I'm leasing a horse so I'll be riding a lot more often, and my breeches get pretty dirty every time I go to the barn. I don't know if I should just wear my dirty breeches all through the week, since I really only do my laundry once a week, but that doesn't seem like the best thing to do. I'm considering buying another pair, but I don't want to spend a ton of money since I'll just be wearing them around the barn and I'm not going to show yet. What should I chose? I could wear jeans, but I don't have any jeans that area appropriate for the barn right now so I would have to spend money anyways. What is a good pair of ladies (or juniors, if that's a department) riding breeches that are inexpensive but are good for just every day riding?      Thanks so much!

20090307142631AARMZxQ	Pets;Birds	My Budgies are acting strange!! Please Help!!?	I've had two budgies (a male and female) for a couple years now, in the same cage.  They usually get along fine, but the female who is a bit older would show that she's the boss (eg. when eating, the female would eat first and if the male tried to get some food she would peck at him, but not actually peck him, she would just make that motion).  So that was normal behavior, but recently they have been acting very strangely, especially the female.  Lately, she's kinda been hanging upside down on the perches, so her tail sticks straight up.  While doing this, she starts shrieking and screaming (its an awful sound to listen to).  So while she is upside down, the male sometimes picks at her tail, or pokes her near her stomach and her private area.  They have never done this before, and I really want to know if something is wrong.  Are they doing some kind of mating ritual, or is the male provoking her?? Why is she acting so strange?? Any help is appreciated!

20090307122827AAh6nmf	Pets;Birds	Is she broody or just hiding her eggs from neighbors?	Ok, so my neighbor's chickens and rooster regularly (every day) come into our yard to eat insects, play in our sand box, etc... yesterday, I noticed 2 eggs under our old washing machine (up on blocks next to our new one) on the back porch.  It seems the neighbor's chicken stole one of my daughter's shirts and decided to lay eggs on it.  Right now mommy is out there sitting on the eggs.  My question is is she broody and trying to keep her eggs from being eaten (the neighbors collect eggs daily for eating) or did she just find a comfy new place to lay eggs?  My 6 year old son found the eggs yesterday and moved them, but we put them back, and she came back to sit on them.  She isn't here at night though, is she just laying to get a stock pile to incubate?  will she start to stay here all the time to sit on them after she gets some more?  or should I collect them up?  I'm pretty interested in the subject because just last week we went and bought 5 chicks from the vets office, so it'd be good to get some practice before they get bigger.

20090307143007AAJ2j8t	Pets;Horses	Help? Kicking horse....?	Background information:      Dandee Bar Hancock      Age: 9   Sex: Male (gelding)   Breed: American Quarter Horse   Colour: Black with a stripe and 4 socks   Weight: 1,300 lbs   Height: 15.3 hh      Anna May      Age: 11   Sex: Female   Weight: 120   Height: 5'7ft      Okay, so, I know that either me or my horse is having a problem. I don't know if it is me or my horse. Lately Dandee has been being a little stubborn and moody. When I was trying to lunge him yesterday he just stopped cantering and started walking! I cracked the whip and he didn't do anything! I tossed the end of the lunge line at his ankles. Then he turned around and kicked. He didn't try to kick me but he just kicked like he was threatening me! I couldn't let him win the fight or else he would think that threatening to kick me is okay so I tried to walk up to his head to take him by the halter and lead him around in circles but he turned and almost kicked me! My mum was mad at me for what I did next, she says I could have gotten myself hurt badly, I went around to the other side by his face and reached up and grabbed him by his halter and pulled his head down to my level so he couldn't toss it or rear or anything. I started walking without holding onto his halter and stayed there so I walked back and took him by the halter and started leading him behind me. Then I let go. He stopped. I went over to the middle of the riding ring where I was lunging him and sat down. What happened next really surprised me. I felt warm breath on the back of my neck and then my hair being pulled. So I turned around and Dandee was right there behind me. I got up and started walking and he followed me XD    But, why do you think he was kicking?   What should I do to get him to stop?      Oh btw he also kicks when I am on him and he doesn't move or he bucks and rears. (I haven't fallen off of him yet luckily)   He also kicks when I use a crop. If he even sees it in my hand when I a on him he kicks or bucks. When I first got him I would hit him on the butt to get him to go if he wasn't listening when I clucked or kicked but then I started to use a cop. He HATED it.       Any suggestions, answers to my questions above, criticism, or ideas on what I should do would be greatly appreciated!       *** Plz don't even mention selling him as an option. I am NOT selling him. I luv him 2 much. And i don't know if my mum would let me.... ***
20090307131852AAGf7G1	Pets;Birds	Put up a new bird feeder?	1) The bird feeder will be put on top of a vertical 4" by 4" post. The residents want the post to be 2.5 metres high. To make the post sturdy, you must bury it at least 0.5 metres. If a 4" x 4" post costs $1.79 a foot, how much will the post cost?      2) Once the post is buried, you need added support. You attach wires 1.5 metres up from the base of the post on either side. The wires are 1 metre from the base. Wire costs $1.25 a foot. How many feet of wire will you need and how much will it cost?      3) The bird feeder will hold 1.5 L of bird seed. How many pints will it hold?      4) A bolt is needed to attach the feeder to the post. At least 1/2 inch of the screw must penetrate the wood to be secure. You also need to put a 1/8 inch washer in between the screw and the wood. The screw must go through a 1 inch board, the washer, and penetrate the wood. Determine the minimum length of screw required if the screw type is sold in 1/4 inch increments.

She was very sick and my Mom did all we could do. We are going to bury her either today or tomorrow. Since my Mom works at a vet place, she is keeping Emma in the freezer thingy until we bury her. I don't know what I should do now. I have a cat named Lillybell, but she is old and sleeps all the time. I am very lonely. Should I get another pet? And also, I have been through this before. I used to have another hamster named Rocco, but he died of old age.

I just got new field boots (ariat challenge) and they're sweet!   they are a tiny bit big for my foot, and the calf at the widest is about a quarter inch too big, but i dont think those things will be problematic. whats difficult is the height. i first got the same size in tall's, but the boots went up past my knee and were about 2 inches higher than they should have been. i couldnt walk in them and i couldnt bend my knee, when i tried it would hurt at about 30 degree's...   my new ones are good, but they are only just above the perfect height now and i'm afraid they'll drop too much.    advice? go back for the tall ones? stick with the shorter?    thanks!   meg      ps. i know this is in pets, but i couldnt think of where else to ask this. Thanks!!

Have your horses worked well with them? Or they've just hated it?      I thought the Happy Mouth bits were really good but after about a week I found out they are actually not as great. My horse absolutely dislikes it! And the mouthpiece got quite rough in a very short period of time. I know it's personal preference and everything depends on a horse, just want to know opinions of (anti-) fans.

20090307124013AAGYyqr	Pets;Cats	I don't know if this really a question but its about a wild cat?	I used to feed a cat that would come to my house all the time, I could tell he didn't have a home, he would only let me pet him but he was still scared of me, he would often come with several wounds from fights etc, and I would often nurse them. This goes on for about a couple of years so I get attached to him. One day he comes to my house limping one of his rear legs was cut , like he got into a fight or something. I knew right away that going to the vet was very necessary, set up a trap to catch him in which he got into. took him to the vet, the vet said his pelvic bone was broken and also his ball joint was broken, really didn't remember but it would cost 700 dollars to fix. At this point I was going to get him treated and get his shots, make him an indoor cat. The vet asked me if I had any other pets , in which I do , two Chihuahuas, and 4 cats. the vet said this cat was wild and would probably harm my other pets so he did not recommend me to introduce him. My option was to put him to sleep in which I really didn't want to do but I have other pets and dint want them harmed either. The  vet said this cat was hit by a car and he would have a limp for life so living outdoors again he would be defenseless against predators. so he was sedated Again since he had to be because he kept biting the vet and scratching during examination. long story short he was put to sleep in which I feel bad about..balling in the vets office....Do you think I did the right thing?

20090307145843AAAcEkQ	Pets;Cats	Question about wet cat food?	Due to one of my kittys having megacolon, all 4 of my cats are now on a wet food diet. No more dry food in the house per the vet. I have gotten them into a routine of eating 3 times a day. I feed them between 5:00-5:30 ever morning before I leave for work. I feed them as soon as I walk in the door around 4 in the afternoon and then I put out a smaller plate for them right before I go to bed around 10. If I dont do the 10 oclock one they are waking me up around 2 in the morning to be fed. Its quite funny because if they are hungry while I'm sleeping or its the weekend, they will slap me with their paws til I wake up! :) Anyways, Normally they eat all their food in the morning and afternoon ... and about half of what I give them at 10 but they nibble on it through the night. Is it okay to let it sit out from 10 til I wake up at 5 in the morning?? I just dont want them to get sick.

I'm really conflicted as to how they are supposed to set up in showmanship and halter classes.   I have gotten a few different answers.   I'm used to showing Quarter Horses, and know they are square. But I have been told that one back leg is extended out further, and have also been told they should be square.      She has excellent training on her, but sat in a pasture for a couple of years, so she is a rescue. She remembers all her dressage, and hunter/jumper training, and when we practice showmanship, she sets up with one back foot extended out, and both front feet square. Not sure if this is just how she is stopping, or if she remembers this as well.   She also remembers pivoting, so she has to know showmanship.

She doesn't know where her food or water or litter box is and the trip to my house was very stressful for her.  She was panting and hissing and meowing the whole way home.  I wonder if she is stuck behind there...btw, she's been in there for one day.   Should I    a. grab her and put her back in the original room   or    b. leave her behind the washer and just leave her alone for a few more days?

I have a very old leather bicycle saddle that is starting to chafe around the rear of the saddle and is staining my pants in the process. What do you guys use on your leather saddle to stop chafing from occurring that I can use on my bicycle saddle? Thanks

How much do they cost? I have cats and a quiet dog, will they get along? Can I bring it outside/get it wet? Are they clean/ not smelly? Any additional info?      Thanks
