20090131114216AA5pyf6	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	What sites can I go to that send annoying spam if I sign up an email?	Yea, I'm sending them to my cheating ex boyfriend.   Why, yes. I am extremely immature.   And, yes. I do need to get a life.   Also, no. I don't exactly care about the consequences.      I prefer he gets emails from sites that don't save IP addresses, and don't have sign-up fees linked to registering an email.   Preferably embarrassing gay porn sites that are difficult to close.   Preferably sites that don't let him know it's from me, or that it's spam, and don't automatically end up in his "junk mail" folder.      PS. No. I do not want to be "the bigger person," nor get lame revenge by merely 'Ignoring him, or making him jealous.'      I just want to piss him off one step at a time until I feel much better about myself.   Say what you want.   ... You're probably right.      Thanks, Guys. ?

20090131115640AAZZmAd	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Need help getting rid of MS Antivirus 2009 and MS Antispyware 2009?	Yesterday I kept getting a message from MS Antivirus 2009 telling me that my computer was infected with a whole bunch of virus. It kept popping up every 20 seconds or so. I already have a free antivirus, and I used it to scan my whole computer to see if it was true. The scan found nothing, so I knew that MS Antivirus 2009 had to be a fake. I removed it by using the "add remove programs", and it has stopped popping up, but it is still in my computer. My computer is now going slower than usual. Also when I try to search for something on Google, I get redirected to completely random sites.    I've tried looking at other answers posted here, and I've tried different methods but none of them work. I've downloaded Norman Malware Cleaner and Malwarebyte AntiMalware and ran them while in Safe Mode. I tried downloading SuperAntiSpyware but I keep getting sn error message telling me that the system admin has set policies to prevent it, even though I'm the admin. Instead I download SpyBot Search and destroy, and used it to scan my system. All these programs found some problems and removed them, but the problem is still not fixed. I ran them all again, while in safe mode, and according to them, there are no more problem.    So does anybody know how to get rid of this probelm? I know that there must be some way to do it. I'm pretty pissed because I just got this computer a few weeks ago.    Also, try not to send me too many links, because MS Antivirus 2009 prevents me from opening some websites.   And, please try to explain what to do step by step. I'm pretty good with computers, but I just want to make sure I'm doing it 100% right.   Thanks

For a little while, I was periodically getting the blue screen of death... more frequently lately.  When I checked the Event viewer in Vista it had an error each time it happened that said something about Power Management  kernel error and Processor 0.  Also I sometimes heard beeps before the blue screens would happen that sounded like it could be coming from the power supply, but it was hard to tell.  Now the computer just freezes at the motherboard splash screen and will not boot (can't even get into BIOS).  Could this be caused by a bad power supply?

We were using wireless that cost $40 a month, but one of my friends said I could find wireless for less than that. I'm not sure about providers. Could you recommend some to me?

20090131171511AA0RaLV	Computers & Internet;Internet;Facebook	Facebook friend request from someone who dissed me years ago?	I can't believe this.  I got a facebook friend request from this guy I used to be good friends with several years ago.  But then he got married and had a kid, and it seemed like he didn't really want to be friends anymore, because it would take him weeks to return my phone calls.  I'm pretty sure he even ignored my phone calls, because I know he has caller ID.  So the final straw was when I was supposed to visit him at his new house, and he told me to call him up on the day I was going to visit.  I called him and got no answer!  I left him a message and he never returned my call.  After that I said forget this clown, and never called him again.  He never called me again either.  Now, 6 years later, I get a blank friend request on facebook from him.  A BLANK request?  Why don't you explain yourself???  So I figured, ok, let bygones be bygones, so I accepted the request.  But now after a few days, I still haven't gotten an email or anything from this guy!  WTF?

20090131145435AA7tGWP	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	I have a laptop battery issue?	ok so a few months ago something happened and my laptop had to be on the charger constantly, i know this kills the battery but i had no other choice. then i got a new charger (that was kinda the problem) and i was able to take my laptop off the charger again, but i knew i had pretty much destroyed the battery and when i checked how many mAh's it could hold and it was like 200 or something which was normal considering that it originally could only hold 4400      so today i was going out and i left it on the charger to download stuff so it wouldnt die cuz by itself it only lasts about 20 mins but when i came back i checked how many it could hold (i checked because it was behaving really weird when i awakened it) it says it can now hold: 65468 mAh's!!!! how is this even possible because it could only originally hold 4400 when i bought it.      i'm not complaining or anything i mean if it can hold that many now thats great but should i be worried or something?

20060921081644AAGOV57	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Quale marca ha l'assistenza migliore?	Ciao,   ho comprato sempre HP, sempre di ottimo livello. Ultimamente un portatile top di gamma per me, uno per mio padre e anche per lavoro uso portatili HP. Mai nessun problema. Perfino la mia stampante è HP ed è sempre stata ottima. Poi con il nuovo portatile ho avuto, dopo poco più di un mese dall'acquisto, un problema al cdrom che si è rotto.   L'assistenza (data in subappalto ad una compagnia credo francese) è stata sgarbatissima. Si sono rifiutati di ripararlo in garazia, di farmi un preventivo scritto e quando ho chiesto quanto sarebbe costato (bisognava sostituirlo) mi hanno detto 400 € più iva, una cifra folle.   Quando ho rifiutato mi hanno rimandato indietro il pezzo (che era integro ma si era sfilato da tutti i supporti, non facile da rimontare) completamente danneggiato, con il laser forzato, come vandalizzato.   Allora ho deciso di non comprare più HP ma mi adesso chiedo chi può darmi una asistenza di buon livello? Avete esperienze positive? Tranne HP, per favore.

Hi      This is a follow on from a previous question sorry, the helpful answer lead me to this.      The company has a system setup where 50 websites are structure via a database.       I mean all 50 websites look the same but have slightly different content, but exactly the same content.      To change the templates and therefore the layout, visual appearance of the website, is it a case of adapting the html template in my favourite editor and then just uploading to the database?      The therefore changing all 50 websites at once.      or is there likely to be some level of SQL coding involved to make the alterations?      Also how would you change the textual content of the individual website?      Sorry I have never physically used a dtabase only via other systems, WP, Drupal etc.      thanks

I have a Windows Vista laptop (Compaq Presario F700) and right now I'm having some issues with the wireless network adapter. On the outside of the laptop, it is set to the on position, and yet it says it is off. In the device manager, I only see one network adapter being recognized, so I'm just wondering if I should be seeing a second one for my wireless connection. The wired connection through an ethernet cable is working fine right now (which is what I presume to be the network adapter in the device manager that is updated and working properly).      Thanks!

Is there a way to avoid the grey and retain the headers and footers in their original, colorful and normal state? If not, is there another way of achieving what I want? Remember, I just need this for on-screen viewing. Thanks!!

Initially, I’ve deleted the applications of “Record Now” & “HP Image Zone Plus”.  Then discovered my “HP DVD Writer 300” drive not detected, message as follow:      “Problem with shortcut – The Drive or network connection that the shortcut ‘E Dir.lnk’ refers to is unavailable.  Make sure that the disk is properly inserted or the network resource is available, and then try again.”       I followed the said instruction and even tried the “Roll Back Feature – can’t ‘cause there’s no record”, so I attempted the most reluctant applications of “System Restore” & “System Recovery”, but all were in vain.  I couldn’t even access my Windows XP!      “NTLDR is compressed.  Press Ctrl + Alt + Del to restart”.  I remembered I’ve compressed both the C & D dir to save space, is this the blockage?      Appreciated your advice ASAP.      Ms Bett

20090131153001AA0AtfT	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Monitors	Why does my LCD screen gets static when starting up?	Hello, lately my Dell 2007FWP Ultrasharp LCD displays this weird static at startup and gradually fades off the longer it's been on. It's most prominent when the screen is displaying high contrast objects (like white bios text on black background or a white window on a darker desktop background). The static looks like a pinkish noise that shows up in randomized horizontal lines.      No, I'm not a noob. I haven't changed the setttings in a long time, graphics drivers are up to date, cable is firmly seated, screen is displaying at native resolution and refresh rate.      As I'm typing this the static is gone, but parts of the screen looks clear wheras some parts appear to be a little fuzzy, almost like it's out of focus - If I were to guess I'd say it's like the monitor has trouble pulling crystals into alignment.      I've been using this monitor for only 2 years, and it didn't come cheap. Should I be looking for a replacement now?

I have a dell computer and the agent told me that the current power supply that I have right now from dell has a input of 7A/4A.He said it would cause an over voltage to the motherboard but wouldn't the power supply be a max of 12A? Mean it can go up to 12A but can support 7A/4A? My head is about to explode please clarify things for me guys!      Thanks.

20090131164201AAx9YUw	Computers & Internet;Internet;YouTube	Why did Youtube delete my video?	Well, I had a video on Youtube with my friend and it was doing really well. Then, all of a sudden. Boom.      It was deleted.      What I don't get is that when I tried to watch the video it said it was deleted, but it didn't send me an email or a message on my Youtube explaining why or what terms of use it violated.      So, if you think you have an answer as to why they deleted without telling us why, then please help me out. =)
