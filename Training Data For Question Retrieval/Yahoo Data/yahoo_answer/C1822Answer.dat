The trouble with doing it this way is that you will continually have to move the cell containing the formula down as you fill up all the columns depending on how often you start over (by the week, month, year, etc.)  I would just put out to the left side of the cell with sum formula a name such as total daily mileage accumulated or something like that.  As far as adding it up in the cell next to your existing cell that will take a much more complicated column, of which I do not know the whole thing, but I am certain it can be done and then added up at the end of each finished worksheet.|`|A7jgSdNsaa	Im an IT tutor and you are able to add cells containing a formula.

Your first 3 error messages are coming from AccountConsolidate; why did you make this a static method?    Your 4th is because you are assigning a number to an Account object.    Your 5th error is because you forgot the brackets after close.    The last 2 errors should resolve if you take care of the above.

Ltd and Marvell have developed hard disk drives (HDD) that utilize the Marvell 88i6525 system-on-chip (SOC). Samsung claims its latest hard drives are the industry's first products to support native 3.0Gbps I/O transaction capabilities in addition to SATA native command queuing (NCQ).    Marvell's SATA SOC featured on the new drives boasts the smallest pin count and footprint of any HDD SOC on the market, says Samsung. The 88i6525's 128pin TQFP package with 14-by-14mm footprint reduces pin count for HDDs that result in lower costs via pin reduction and PCB area savings. Marvell's chip features low power consumption, due primarily to its Serial ATA physical layer transceiver (PHY) and low-power, high-data rate read channel technology. The 88i6525's read channel core can run up to 1.25Gbps.

The government (both democrat and republican) has taken a view that any way to make money off us sheep is a good thing, especially if those people donate to campaigns. They don't go after drug companies or the medical community for pushing drugs when other methods work better. They don't go after medical business or credit cards or others with their deliberately difficult deceptive billing systems and extremely high time consuming processes to correct problems which many people won't deal with and just let those companies steal from them rather than do anything about it ... which is obviously by design.<br>  <br>  Hey, you are nothing but a sheep to be fleeced to these people, deal with it because there is nothing you can do because the population of the US and much  of the world is controlled by TV ... the news media and entertainment industry have your brain in a lock and they won't let it go. <br>  <br>  Almost everything you think you know, is wrong, and they are now really going to put it to you because we are all stupid enough for it to work.|`|o9Xq0rOlaa	The makers of that Nasty Antivirus 360 and all of its clones are based in Russia thats why, did you know that they make these pieces of crap to only go after english speaking users of computers, if any Russian is found on the infecting computer it will not install.,|`|B9W5v7zhaa	there are millions malware every day. the government won't ever have time for this.

The backgrounds are extremely beautiful. The XP backgrounds are boring the only nice one is the default which is the Bliss (i think)<br>  The new Vista start menu has a nice look such as the two columns which lets you see you documents programs, without making a huge mess.<br>  The transparency bar has a modern look, you can make you entire desktop look 3D, especially with Google Chrome. The Sidebar has gotten a couple of bad reviews, because people say it takes up alot of space. Not many people use the sidebar because it takes space.<br>  <br>  The new icons are nice, and modernized, while the XP desktops icons are old, and its hard to see.<br>  <br>  So why don't you XP fans go and try out Vista.|`|XA5Mv59Laa	It's new.<br>  its easier to navigate.<br>  it has more updated programs.<br>  Windows vista and XP are reverse compatible.

Select quick scan, or Full scan if you want to. Then, once its finished, view the infections, and delete the selected infections. If it asks you to reboot, do it. This program is very popular and handy when it comes to problems like this.

Please check the web site: Buyxg.com for an excellent deal on a portable computer. As for your question, computer  one(1) looks like a well built computer, and offers you a lot more performance enhancements than computer two (2).|`|sYxUVBvPaa	The special edition is better.

3LmXfFoBaa	http://www.killerphp.com/videos/ watch form videos here|`|GuyFz7ybaa	Get the information using $_POST or $_GET and then in the page you wish to use, write them to a text file and output it to the page at the same time:        $filename = 'test.txt';  $somecontent = $_POST['user_input_from_form'];    // Let's make sure the file exists and is writable first.  if (is_writable($filename)) {        // In our example we're opening $filename in append mode.      // The file pointer is at the bottom of the file hence      // that's where $somecontent will go when we fwrite() it.      if (!$handle = fopen($filename, 'a')) {           echo "Cannot open file ($filename)";           exit;      }        // Write $somecontent to our opened file.      if (fwrite($handle, $somecontent) === FALSE) {          echo "Cannot write to file ($filename)";          exit;      }        echo "Success, wrote ($somecontent) to file ($filename)";        fclose($handle);    } else {      echo "The file $filename is not writable";  }  ?>|`|hXHBm1BSaa	You can use POST, GET or session variables to send them to another page. But if you need to store it you will definitely need a database, otherwise it disappears as soon as the user disconnects or even goes to another site for a while. For short term use it is better to put the php form building script at the bottom of the page, with an if() section at the top to respond to the submission if the submit button is clicked. This is a good way to work as it can also include a second if() statement to allow it to drop back to the form if a user leaves information out. You will never be able to use their entries without a database.
mimykKnhaa	one comes with it! go into your utilities, and look for a program called screen grab. its awesome!|`|AA10570173	Go to Applications. Find your Utilities folder. Inside that is a wonderful little utility called Grab. You can set it to make a screen shot of your entire screen, just the active window, a specific selection, or even a timed screen. It saves the images as Tiff files and opens them once grabbed so you can then name them and decide where to save them. It's very cool. I've used it a lot.|`|gOJFu1ODaa	command-shift-3  This saves the image to the desktop.
2SSA9e9Naa	RTF is the best to use when exchanging files with people. Most word processors can read and generate RTF. It also has formatting within the file structure so you don't loose paragraph markers, etc. I would highly recommend using that.    Straight MS-DOS text is the lowest common denominator and would work but your document is very boring.    I would stay away from Unicode Text as it may require special processors at the other end.|`|XW4pa8Pzaa	rtf    Edit: Ummm...?! I don't get it, what are you doing? You want it to open in DOS?! Any way, if you want something like MS word but don't have it, try open office, it's free  http://www.openoffice.org/    If you want to open it in DOS, you should save it in unicode text format|`|20856f4dafc13e1033d7dbc0a21f71bbaa	ms doc is the standard one for word rtf is a good alternative as it will work linux / mac systems but make larger files
kWbCqgo0aa	Honestly, there are all kinds of ways that silly little things like this can happen. They ways that Myspace can be tweaked and hacked are almost too many to count. I've seen several websites and blogs that show ways to do things like this.|`|2LbTrlQnaa	There is no way for somebody to simply appear on your page.  What I find is that my friend count reduces temporarily and then comes back to the correct number.  Example - 150 friends - might log on one day and find it says  **** has 149 friends, but having counted them manually, there are still 150.  Log on later in the day and it now says **** has 150 friends but there are still the same 150 friends as when counted previously.

uBkvqcY6aa	If you have access to a machine running Linux try plugging it into that.  Windows see's bad partitions and filesystems and wants to "destroy" them to fix them.  However plugging into a linux machine you can probably mount the drive and just copy your files off.  If you don't have access to a linux machine ask your techs at work, they can probably help.|`|Y5j2Cr14aa	Just get the files you need|`|jToYMLV4aa	Try this:  Insert the flash drive.  Open Windows Explorer.  Right-click the flash drive and select Properties.  Go to the Tools tab.  Go to Error checking: Check Now  Put check marks in the two options and press Start.    Just remember I am not responsible if you lose data.  If there's no other way, that may just save the day.
rpSP0qrQaa	Hahaa, I've never heard any headphones that go to 8hz! That's infrasound - you would be able to distinguish the individual compressions and rarefactions!    And ignore any frequency response figures unless they're properly published or on a graph, etc. By properly published I mean that they state how they were measured, i.e. a response of 60hz-20khz @ -3db. Without this they are meaningless... it could say the speakers go down to 40hz, but that could be 10db less than everything else.    Most specs of cheap headphones and speakers say they have a response of 20hz-20khz, which is quite frankly rubbish. You'll be lucky to get even a good pair of speakers going strong below 60 or 70hz.     My recommendation is always to steer clear from all 'computer speakers'. Your best bet is to get a cheap pair of studio monitors. I wouldn't actually call these proper monitors, but they're better than most consumer speakers you would get...  http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/St...    They should have fairly strong and accurate bass. I actually consider most 8" monitor to be too bass heavy for nearfield monitors, but if you're not actually going to use them as monitors then that shouldn't matter too much to you.      And on another note, I really don't recommend 2.1 systems or anything with a subwoofer either. Unless you can afford a really good sub (Genelec, etc) then the box you get will be nothing but a cheap box tuned to resonate at some harmonics to trick your ears into thinking its producing really low frequencies - its not. Its just puffing some air around and setting up un-needed standing waves in your room.    Which brings me on to my last point - the placement of your speakers and the acoustics of your room can make as much difference to the sound as the speakers itself.

Mctjf6Zcaa	I'm not sure if I'm reading your question right.    If you're asking:   a) Can I use XML to point to an image which I can then use XSL to display?  Then the answer is yes.    but if you're asking:   b) Can I store an image within XML completely (as in no external image file required), then the answer is no.    In the case of  option (a), you would need to define the image in your XML file within a tag, something like this:        myimage.jpg        and in your XSL Stylesheet you would add the following in:            I hope that helps.

The software that is out there that I know of that can and does read this is free and reads various temps, the motherboard, the cpu, your ram area, etc. and gives you these readings. Being that this software is a diagnostic that can give you info for so many other things  more than just the temperature and that they are free and take very little resources, I can't underrstand why you would not want to use them or want to read this info manually as you say.

bae465266b8ae0e6ca6778413a42c29daa	Hi, most built-in laptop Wi-Fi cards aren't very powerful and they come with no antenna (because they have to fit it in the laptop). If you want to pick up more networks or improve your signal then consider purchasing a external USB card, preferably one with an antenna.    I use this one:   http://www.amazon.co.uk/Edimax-EW-7318US...    the antenna is also detachable, I never bother to have mine on as the reception is good enough without the extra gain in receiver power.|`|1504ed0aa41d9367f9e3e5ec6d17284eaa	that is a B signal or a G at best  and the range has lots to do with it   B is 11 Mbps--very slow  G is 54 Mbps alright but slow  N is the best 100 Mbps  how to tell --put ur pointer on the computer in the task bar --it tells u --u are connected and ur signal strength

Lets go at this one step at a time here:-<br>  <br>  No.1 You must make certain that any new version of Kasprsky anti virus software IS written specifically to fit on & work on the version of windows, or Apple Mac or Linux (operating system) you have installed on your computer. If your machine is say running windows XP or Vista then make sure you download or install a copy of the program for this version of windows i.e. a 32bit operating system.<br>  <br>  No.2 YES! you would be advised NOT to try to install & run x2 anti virus programs at the same time. Only use x1 anti virus program on your machine, there is no advantage in having 2 anyway.<br>  <br>  No.3 YES! Try to uninstall the present trial version which is about to run out (or is it only the update subscription service that's coming to an end you haven't told us or made that clear here?). If its just a trial version of the program you should have an option inside the program to upgrade over the web via the Kaspersky website to a full product.<br>  <br>  No.4 If you are having problems why not contact Kaspersky technical support? via the phone they will be able to talk you through the download & installation process if you simply want to upgrade from a trial >> to full product.<br>  <br>  No.5 OR you could un-install Kaspersky anti virus program off your computer completely (DON'T worry about the Trojan message, that can be delt with later on when you have your program correctly installed). If you need a special removal tool to un-install the program look for the tool that matches your specific version of the program. If it says removal tool for version 6 and you have version 6 this is what you need. It must match the version you are using.<br>  <br>  NOTE:- DON'T ever buy anything ever again from PC World they are a dreadful company and they are only interested in taking your money i.e. selling you something. There after sales services is more than dreadful and their technical skills are zero. You definitely wont get ANY help from them with this problem, they are clueless about their own products and that's completely unforgivable for an IT company.

They're not always found on Kapersky's main site. Download the correct removal tool and then do a search to make sure its completely gone off your system. Load new Kapersky up and it should be ok. Use an online scanner like Panda or download Norman anti-malware, a standalone detector to see if viruses have crept on your system between the removal and installation of your software.

Yes, you'll lose everything.  But it's the only way to be sure that the trojan won't cause harm.|`|2ec3c76fd8030a72563cfb9a02cf55e2aa	Run your anti-virus software.  If you don't have any, check out Avast or AVG (Avast.com or AVG.com) and scan your computer.  There is no easy way to find and delete the virus on your own, you need software to track it down and find what it's infecting/doing.|`|Z2rxLctiaa	You should use anti-virus like AVG8 to remove it.Directly you can't delete a virus.Because you can never know which file is infected and where?|`|0003934bb4332a9e445607b7d52efbdeaa	Well, by the time your seeing Pop ups it is too late, the Virus has already invited in friends & is busy inviting more... This is NOT something simple that you can just delete on your own! It digs in to the Registry adds hidden files & sets up house... You will need the help of a Anti-Malware program to remove this sucker, the longer you wait the more control it has over your system! Until one morning when you turn on your computer only to find that a Password has been placed on your user account & you are LOCKED OUT of your own computer...<br>  <br>  Here is a tool from Microsoft that will help you root it out.<br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=ad724ae0-e72d-4f54-9ab3-75b8eb148356&displaylang=en" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/detai...</a><br>  Run the FULL scan!! This tool is a 1 time use, it dose NOT install on your system! Once it has done it's job it uninstalls it's self completely...<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|2pNT0eAAaa	well, you get any kind of pop-up about fixing your computer..don't click it..i personally use sophos anti virus..and it gets rid of like all viruses..just try running a virus scan, or you could go to your temporary interent files on your computer and just ctrl-a and delete everything..won't mess up anything!<br>  And to be safe..save all of your files on a portable hardrive or, a flashdrive.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|eghsNMd7aa	If you want to delete it on your own then you'll have to boot into safe mode. You'll have to know the exact file name of the virus. You need to get anti virus software, and a firewall. You probably have all sorts of viruses and spyware that you have no idea you have.|`|o9Xq0rOlaa	your already infected and its a nasty one to,just google XP-Police-Anti virus manual  removel beleive me its very time consuming and frustrating your better off formating if you wont download any programs, your going to need all the luck you can get.|`|3LHsCLVFaa	Here is a link that has been answered on the same question already|`|WoAY8eo9aa	this just happened to me. dont download anything because yes it probably is a virus|`|1oEChRUiaa	XP Police Anti-virus isnt' a trojan, its simply spyware/malware. In effect there is no complete way to get rid of it unless you 'forensically' inspect each file. This would take more time than you probably have. If you don't want to download any anti-virus programs, then you're probably not going to get rid of it. The easiest and most effective way to get rid of it is to use spyware software; i.e. SuperMalwarebytes Software, and use ATFCleaner, CCleaner, etc. Scan your computer with each, then let it delete files that are 'infected' per se. Your best bet would be to transfer all of your files that you need to keep to an external hard-drive. Then reinstall your operating system, once thats done download AVG or Avast antivirus. Update the definitions, install the SuperMalwarebyte software. Then before re-transferring back over your files you backed up previously -- scan then using the programs aforementioned.<br>  <br>  You can check the link below as

That is because most schools use content blocking software. It blocks proxies 98% of the time because of their content (that they are a proxy), not because of the web address.<br>  Also there are admins like me securing the system, adding any the system may miss (listed on proxy lists and even here) by adding them to the DNS blacklist. <br>  <br>  You are very very unlikely to find one that works and even then it will only work for a short time until they know you are using it.<br>  <br>  Your risking your computer rights/detention/suspension by trying to bypass their security.|`|ZkELw9wzaa	Your school filter can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually.

d57260040ef184f107856d79c51106c6aa	Good question.<br>  You can almost certainly get a "generic" power supply at your local Radio Shack or other electronics store.<br>  You will need to know if the output is 12V AC or 12V DC, you will need to pay attention to the polarity of the connector (that's the + and - signs, usually shown on the plastic near the connector) and you will need to make sure that the adapter you buy has the proper size connector to fit your router.<br>  I just checked; NetGear's website says it is 12.0V DC.<br>  Take your router to Radio Shack with you. The associates there will be more than happy to help.<br>  Good Luck!<br>  I hope this helps!<br>  Troy Downing<br>  (I do not endorse Radio Shack, but I have had good experiences with them in replacing power adapters in the past)|`|MxculX2Daa	Yes you could definitely use a generic power adapter.<br>  Just make sure it is a "regulated" power adapter.<br>  <br>  Take your router to an electronics store and they will have something very inexpensive that will work fine - so long as it is "regulated".

MPldgkkMaa	Many times I have stared at my computer thinking "How do I fix my pc because it keeps crashing?"<br>  Unfortunately there is no simple answer! I used to think this problem was related to buying cheap computers but after buying various laptops and desktops at different price ranges there is one common theme, eventually they will all crash at some stage! <br>  Friends will often think I am a pc expert and will call me asking "How do I fix my pc when it keeps crashing?" Well start by asking yourself these questions...<br>  Have your children be on the pc? Kids are great at downloading spyware by mistake! They will also click on numerous pop up pages and will often change your settings!<br>  Another possible reason your pc keeps crashing is that you have overloaded it! If your pc only has 64mb RAM memory and you install graphic, gaming and other software the chances are that your system will not be able to cope with your software! Most PC's now come with at least 512mb RAM so it is worth upgrading if your pc is not at this level.<br>  However the most common reason that your pc keeps crashing is that it has a virus! Many trojan virus can cause your computer to reboot immediately once all programs have been launched, this can drive you mad and it is not fun as you are helpless!<br>  Best option is to install anti virus software and make sure you only visit trusted websites. If all else fails it is time to reformat your hard drive and wipe your pc clean, this can take hours and you will probably need the data recovery disc that you should have got when you bought the pc.<br>  Recommend tool:  <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> [if you do not have one]|`|1tLmTjBxaa	yes u can use norton ghost to restore,it creates an image of drive when its healthy and u can restore|`|H5iVq0fwaa	use deepfreeze or windows' steadystate to swtich them back to their original state.|`|cWA40Medaa	insert your xp cd to another computer 's cd-rom.copy the i386 directory to a flash card or other usb storage device. copy it to a partition(not c) in ur pc ,enter the directory ,find the file winnt32.exe double click it and begin new installation.|`|gtjvswlzaa	1--->first formate the HDD all drive<br>  re create the HDD drive<br>  2-->change the XP bootable CD<br>  then<br>  install XP<br>  <br>  thanks<br>  Rks<br>  Jhunjhunu (Rajasthan)|`|8uJPjJwXaa	if there is no cd rom drive then use a pen drive|`|ReZNesA2aa	Always use deepfreeze & good antivirus so u will not need to format ur computers........<br>  <br>  After that get Norton Ghost & make a recovery cd of our comp....once u made it ur computer can be formated less than 10 min & inportant 'unattended' just put cd in select some options & ur format will be done...with ur drivers ....with ur istalled softwares...........

SNBG0Y5eaa	Web services and web design are 2 very different things. You can learn both, but typically people learn towards one direction or the other when becoming an expert in. Web services is all about low level programming and web design is all about client side design and layout. I would suggest focusing on one direction first and then move on to the other. Doing web design first would be easier than web services.    (The list of languages I list below is the order I suggest learning.)    For web design, HTML/XHTML, CSS, DOM, Javascript goes without saying. To be good in it, though, you need to learn not only the technology and languages, but good user interface design principles like accessibility, navigation, user behavior, etc. That part is too often overlooked but is essential in designing user-friendly web sites. These are the essentials.    Other technologies for web design: graphic design, Flash, PHP, Perl can be helpful and enrich your web designing skills, but are not essential for *good* web design. I would consider these secondary skills if you are going to pursue web design. Also, if you learn PHP, it's often used with MySQL (or some other database), so be sure to learn that too.    For web services, you're talking about having to learn 2 different parts to it: the web service itself, and the programming environment or platform the web service will be built in.     Since you have to know your programming platform before you can construct a working web service, I will talk about that first. And when talking about web application programming environments, there are 2 main ways you can go: the Microsoft way or the Java way.  The Microsoft way includes: ASP, .NET, C .  The Java way includes: Java. You will also eventually need J2EE and maybe several other Java frameworks, but that can come later.    For the actual web services: XML, SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, HTTP.    As you can see there are TONS of things you can learn. Unless you can afford buying books for all these, there are TONS more very good resources online. Start there.|`|rpSP0qrQaa	I think the obvious next step for you is PHP.  And learn how to interact with MySQL databases.    I've flicked through many books on the topic and never found anything which I think would help me in any way.     So again the best way to learn is to teach yourself from online tutorials and by building up understanding slowly through trial-and-error. Set up a WAMP or LAMP stack on your computer to act as a development environment / sandbox and have a play around with some basic scripts.|`|tsjLHXzUaa	(X)HTML  CSS  JavaScript  DHTML  PHP  SQL / MySQL  XML  XSL-T  AJAX    There is also  WML (which is XHTML for micro-browsers, like cell phones)  Java  Flash  SSI  learn to write robot files and .htaccess files|`|f5be9151ad367e7746c827fa94f8d3e1aa	php  html  css  javascript  mysql  flash|`|CTGHeMwPaa	People -- the person made a specific request for Web Services!  This is SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, JAX-RPC, etc, --- *not* web pages.    The leaders in Web Services technology, language wise, is C , C++, and Java.    Microsoft, Sun, and IBM have really been pushing these languages as the implementation leaders for Web Services.     For Web Services, though, I've discovered that Java is probably the easiest.    When it comes to Java and C++, the gold standard Web Services library is Axis and Axis2:    http://ws.apache.org/axis/  http://ws.apache.org/axis2/    Axis and Axis2 are both open source and free to use.   They are also very standards-compliant.     You can read about how to use them at:         http://ws.apache.org/axis/java/developer...  http://ws.apache.org/axis2/1_4_1/quickst...    However, now that I've said all this, I should say that Web Services is not exactly the right technology for message boards, user registration, etc.    Web Services are more commonly used for application-to-application interaction and interoperability.   If you want to pursue Web Services, you should be sure that you understand what exactly Web Services are and what they are for:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service  http://www.w3schools.com/webservices/ws_...|`|9TpOHLh9aa	You should learn php also.|`|sGIZ7hdWaa	HTML  XHTML  CSS  JAVASCRIPT  PHP  MYSQL  ACTIONSCRIPT/FLASH/etc|`|aab8fee4bb00a3a37d38643f4e296de7aa	It kind of depends on what clients you have.     But i would say skip just about everthing on your list     and do Java script and or PHP first, if you do PHP learn some basic SQL while your at it.    Then I'd say move on to ASP and .NET languages.  Otherwise get really comfortable with some of the open source CMS programs like Joomla and Durpal.    AS far as books, I personally think thier a waste of time. Maybe go to your local book store for a day and read the intro to a couple books on the language you're learning.      From there use websites and google. I learned html, css and php from htmlgoodies.com and just working through projects with the help of Google.
IB4uC5bIaa	To watch all videos in high quality, add &fmt=18 to the end of any video URL (but make sure that "&feature=dir" is not at the end of the URL. If it is, just paste it over the first code.)<br>  <br>  I also find that just deleting "&feature=dir" from the URL and pressing enter loads a video when it was not loading before.<br>  Hope that helps.
bLuFKxQNaa	Defragging doesnt create or delete space, it just rearranges fragmented files to speed up data access.  There may be some system restore points created during the course of a defrag...that is a well known issue in Vista..not an unusual thing. These system restore points may take up significant amount of space. So check for and delete the system restore points you don't need, and reboot. This should give you back your space.  You could try out the 30 day trial of Diskeeper and use the VSS defrag option to prevent unnecessary shadow copy activity. Dk works very well on Vista.  http://diskeeper.com/|`|L3hc9EOiaa	it is possible to increase size with defrag, as it logically rearanges your files and can sometimes take a little extra space to do so. the most likely cause how ever is incorrectly deleted files still on the drive, run disk cleaner and remove old and unused and deleted files and try defrag again this should fix problem. It may also be a back up file that has doubled up rather than written over|`|Og3vKQeWaa	No!|`|ye1tS9a2aa	defragging dosent take up space or makes space...if you want gigs back, do this......disk cleanup > more options tab > delete system restore points.  Note, this takes time, wait till the ok button becomes funtional again, the very last restore point is saved.
5ecWRd4Daa	Basically as long as it can be with a power source, it can be months. But you will notice a decrease in speed/performance.|`|Ym7H3x49aa	It depends. The overheating of the laptop is what causes the problems. The heatsink on your laptop can start to become ineffective after continual overheating and your CPU can burn out. Or your harddrive can overheat and fail. My previous laptop's motherboard burned out because of continuous gaming. I had it on for 9+ hours a day without rest. You can monitor the temps on your laptop by downloading a program called "speedfan." It's free and I use it a lot to see if my laptop is becoming a little too hot. Overall, I would say laptops can stay on days at a time. The newer it is, the longer it's going to take to burn out. I would guess it would start to suffer damages after 4-5 days of non-stop use like running applications that take up a lot of ram and use the hell out of your CPU. If your laptop is in idle mode (running no applications) then I would give it a week and a half tops before noticing a decline in performance.|`|myhTgsdMaa	with power, indefinitely but this will wear down your battery life, unless you excercise the battery (unplug it while full). as always, it's a good idea to reboot your pc (desktop or laptop) at least once a week!|`|AA11613146	I'd say 3 hours depending on the model but that's average|`|c17x6L4baa	Time would vary by conditions laptop is exposed to and intensity of use.  Adequate cooling during normal office/home use would give you a lot of days that the laptop could stay turned on without damage if plugged into ac power.  I learned during a conversation with the owner of a telemarketing firm years ago that they did not  turn their laptops off when people left for a reason I have forgotten.  I didn't ask how many shifts they ran though. <br>  <br>  Intense use, by alternating people 24/7 trying to test the laptops limits, would reduce the time.  Poor ventilation could fry it in a short time..|`|11NSsAN7aa	My sister has a higher quality laptop and she only shuts it off every few days but she keeps it plugged into the wall all the time. I would say 4 hours for average one.

CukNsDPJaa	First of all, do you trust the source of the file?    If you do, and your antivirus software is up to date, click "Start", then "Run", and in the little box that pops up, type the letters "cmd" without the quotes.  A black box will pop up, and you'll be in your My Documents folder.  Type "CD WhateverYourFolderNameIs" (again without the quotes) and you'll be where your file is.    Typing the file name should run it.  It will have an extension of EXE, COM, BAT, I forget what else.  For example, if it's named "reallycool.com", you'd just type "reallycool" without the quotes, and hit the Enter key.    Again, unless you know where the thing came from, I'd be careful.  This is geeky stuff, and if you don't know how to use a command line it sounds like you maybe shouldn't be launching whatever it is you're trying to launch.    Good luck, though...

You can, however, find several options- cable and phone services usually provide a VOIP option and there are several other services like Vonage and Skype.  These are quite inexpensive (in the case of Skype, something like 2c/min in the US or $30/year for outgoing and incoming).|`|Oliq3ZDnaa	VolP is an alternative to a normal phone line, such as AT&T. If you subscribe to something like Vonage, you can use that to make calls instead, but the provider is the key. Now if you just want internet calling, not always free, you could Skype, but you still need a normal phone for emergency calls.

FK0tfWlXaa	What you need to look at is how much your motherboard can handle in terms of ram wise. Do you still have the owners manual is this a clone or branded name? if it's a clone search for you model it should tell you how much ram you can upgrade. If it's a branded name look for the motherboard model and do the same search on the manufacture site and it should specify on there. The windows OS 32bit max it will ever see if up to 3.5GB depending on the motherboard you got. So unless you have 64bit operating system it will see up to 128GB of ram.<br>  Most new motherboards nowadays supports up to 8GB. <br>  <br>  What you also have to remember even if you add more ram. That still doesn't improve your gaming performance. Gaming performance increase has a few things to be upgraded. Need a better video card, faster ram, and of course your overall speed your CPU.

MxculX2Daa	I looked for something like this myself recently.<br>  <br>  I did find one but it was too much fiddling around.<br>  <br>  You had to remove a cartridge, open it, insert the picture into the cartridge, close it, insert the cartridge into the scanner body, scan it, repeat....... yawn<br>  <br>  In the end I settled on a Canon LIDE scanner which is A4 flatbed - but it will scan multiple photos at the same time. So for example you can put 3 6X4 pics onto the scanner, press one button on the front of the scanner, and it will then copy them very quickly to 3 separate image files on the PC with no further commands needed.<br>  <br>  My wife has now done hundreds of photos from our family collection and it is very quick and easy to use.|`|PuV9lh37aa	No|`|3LHsCLVFaa	HHHMM. I thought about the same problem at one time then realized that I could place a number of photos on the same bed at the same time. The scanner can be set to scan any dimension. But I chose to set it at 81/2 * 11. This allows at least 4 photos to be scanned in a single pass. Then I just do cutouts in my imaging software. But yes you can buy a scanner for 4*6, but what will you do with the 5*7?|`|meqFvdC4aa	Oracle tutorials<br>  <a href="http://oracletutorials.info/" rel="nofollow">http://oracletutorials.info/</a>

dSzuLGOzaa	Clean or replace air filters on your air conditioning unit at least once a month.   If you have central air conditioning, do not close vents in unused rooms.   Lower the thermostat on your water heater to 120.   Wrap your water heater in an insulated blanket.   Turn down or shut off your water heater when you will be away for extended periods.   Turn off unneeded lights even when leaving a room for a short time.   Set your refrigerator temperature at 36 to 38 and your freezer at 0 to 5 .   When using an oven, minimize door opening while it is in use; it reduces oven temperature by 25 to 30 every time you open the door.   Clean the lint filter in your dryer after every load so that it uses less energy.   Unplug seldom used appliances.   Use a microwave when- ever you can instead of a conventional oven or stove.   Wash clothes with warm or cold water instead of hot.   Reverse your indoor ceiling fans for summer and winter operations as recommended.   Turn off lights, computers and other appliances when not in use.   Purchase appliances and office equipment with the Energy Star Label; old refridgerators, for example, use up to 50 more electricity than newer models.   Only use electric appliances when you need them.   Use compact fluorescent light bulbs to save money and energy.   Keep your thermostat at 68 in winter and 78 in summer.   Keep your thermostat higher in summer and lower in winter when you are away   Insulate your home as best as you can.   Install weather stripping around all doors and windows.   Shut off electrical equipment in the evening when you leave work.   Plant trees to shade your home.   Shade outside air conditioning units by trees or other means.   Replace old windows with energy efficient ones.   Use cold water instead of warm or hot water when possible.   Connect your outdoor lights to a timer.

2iLLZBjyaa	So I imagine you still want the top frame to change, huh.  The easiest way to do this in that case is with a JavaScript in the page after the login page.  Suppose the login frame is named "login" and the soon-to-be link frame is "content1".  In the page they get to after they log in, <br>  <script><br>  parent.content1.location = "links.php"<br>  </script><br>  <br>  The next important thing to realize is you have to protect that link page! If the user can just point their browser at it, I promise you they'll skip your login page.  So use the PHP Session object to stick some flag or other in when they log in, and if that flag isn't there in links.php, send them a 403 error page.

I have a normal BT phone line, I live 1.5 kilometers from my local phone exchange. My ISP is Zen Internet the best broadband provider in the UK, they have won the ward for best broadband ISP for 5 years now. <br>  <br>  **NOTE:- When it comes to broadband you get what you pay for in my view. If your service is with one of the BIG players like Virgin, or Sky,etc They tend to take the "pile it high sell it cheap" approach so don't expect the service to be that great. Bundled broadband is a cheap and cheerful way of doing things. If you want really great broadband then go to a company that provides nothing but ADSL alone.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://zen.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://zen.co.uk</a><br>  <br>  Ivan<br>  <br>  computer veteran, windows user since 1989.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Utility Warehouse.

Because it blows away the AMD Phenom II 940 in every single CPU centric benchmark, that's why.|`|fCOq04lNaa	Performance wise the Core i7 will whoop the Phenom II's butt(higher clocks, much better core microarchitecture, expect a 25% improvement over a 940 at the least), but the 965 is a $1000 processor, while the Phenom II 940 is only $230. A Core i7 965 system will be significantly more expensive than a Phenom II 940 system, due to increased processor costs, plus X58 motherboards and DDR3 memory required for the i7 are also more expensive than the relatively cheap 790FX and DDR2 required for a 980. Totally unfair comparison|`|r2bbLMUZaa	i7 kicks everything else out of the picture. It's the fastest current processor by miles.|`|0003934bb4332a9e445607b7d52efbdeaa	The i7 hands down!!
XwchT7sSaa	You risk buying incompatible pieces if you take more than a couple of months between purchases.  Hardware changes very rapidly these days.  If you are taking time make sure that you double check for compatibility between components...RAM, Video card and Motherboard(MOBO) are the three biggies here.  The MOBO will allow a range of processors, so make sure you get one that isn't at the bottom of the list as it will likely not fit a processor you buy in 3 months.  The MOBO and RAM have to have compatible FSB (front side bus) speeds.  If not then make sure that the MOBO can handle a faster speed than the RAM.<br>  <br>  In order of purchase:<br>  HDD (Hard Disk Drive) - 100GB min for any moderate gamer...250GB+ for any reasonably serious gamer.  It is the least likely to be obsolete.<br>  RAM (memory) - 1GB minimum!, pref 2-4GB, esp for higher end games.<br>  CPU (Processor) - go dual/quad processor...personally prefer AMD (more bang for the buck) rougly in the 2GHz range (that's 2 billion processes per second per processor)<br>  Case and Power Supply (400-500W min)<br>  MOBO - make sure it accepts the CPU you have<br>  Vid Card - 256MB is min for decent gaming, go higher if you're going to be a power gamer.  Personally prefer nVidia chip (even some of the other name cards with the GeForce, etc chipset)<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  Fac|`|t5sYXwSqaa	I do not see the point of building one piece at a time.

47656d33be33ab59b93a1031373f0c0eaa	Crossover will not put Mac OS X at risk. It simply cannot. A virus is simply a program that modifies your system files to make your computer do weird things. Since Crossover emulates these system files, they cannot be affected, and certainly not Mac OS X itself. Since you have an Intel Mac though, check out Parallels, it's better than Crossover. Optionally, you could also install windows with Boot Camp if you have Leopard 10.5 . That way if that gets a virus, there's no way Mac could ever be affected by it.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Crossover is a commercial version of Wine, so probably anything true of Wine is true of Crossover.  Since it's running Windows programs as an emulator, anything a virus can do to your hardware under Windows, it can do under Crossover.  Of course, a Windows virus running in a Mac is like a bird breathing water - it can't do much.  But when Crossover is running, it's like that bird with SCUBA gear.<br>  <br>  So you're not immune to viruses.|`|2LHgmq97aa	Using Crossover currently does not get effected (in general) by Windows Viruses/Spyware but be aware that viruses/spyware can be made specifically for Crossover/Windows... Some trojan spyware programs you install yourself will work and so be careful..  It is a computability layer which does not make it into a PC(Windows), the OS will still be the same.. It makes some programs from Windows work well, most programs that do work do not work 100% correctly and don't run like they necessarily will on Windows..

They'd be your best chance of recovery.  If the data isn't critical, I'd consider just hooking it up to your PC as a secondary slave drive.  If you want to insulate your system a bit more (incase of some odd problem), consider an IDE/SATA to USB adapater.  This would have its own power supply for the disk and you'd connect via USB port.

Dcu3Yw4maa	Boundary conditions are often a place of failure in programs.  (For example, a simple "less than" rather than "less than or equal" test could cause a failure at the "equals" point, or vice versa.  Or, allocating enough space for your "maximum of N items" requirement, but not enough for some "end of list" marker, such as C's '\0' terminator on strings.)<br>  <br>  For example, if you are supposed to be able to read up to 100 items, does it properly handle the case of 100 items, or do you overflow some buffer?  What about zero items?<br>  <br>  It's just as important to test the other side of the boundary as well, such as my example of giving the "up to 100 items" routine 101 items.  You need to make sure that it will gracefully fail (perhaps returning an error) rather than crash or cause a buffer overrun.<br>  <br>  - kb -|`|2SSA9e9Naa	Typically it is at the boundary values that programmers haven't taken care of all the conditions. It is a common programmer mistake not to check input to see if it is in the range you can handle.<br>  <br>  For example, if you base your design on an array of 10 elements and the user enters 11. If the code doesn't check that case and uses 11 you typically get some kind of exception error.<br>  <br>  So, in this case you want to ensure your javascript will deal with any out of bounds conditions.

Q5Nn9Fxoaa	All though I don't use it, Ubuntu has a HUGE support base.  (I'm a SUSSE person myself)  <br>  <br>  But regardless of what distro you pick, you will most likely need WINE to run anything windows based.  WINE works on almost every Linux Distro around.  So it's really up to you.<br>  <br>  WINE is not the O/S it's self.

TLcON6Inaa	If you already have a modem:<br>  <br>  You will need to purchase a wireless router, you can get these at any store that caries computers ie. Best Buy, Comp USA, Wal-Mart or Radio Shack.<br>  <br>  Most wireless routers come with 1 or 2 network cards for your computer if it does not already have a built in wireless capabilities.(WI-FI) If you do not have wireless capabilities on your computer you will want to double check that the router you are purchasing has a network card included.<br>  <br>  The router that you buy will have step by step instructions on how to install the router, and a disk to install the drivers on your computer. The steps are very easy and anyone can do them. It is as easy as connecting 1 cord and installing the software!<br>  <br>  I have used the Belkin Gateway Router for a few years and have not had any problems with it. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|AA11854862	From your providers cable DSL, its usually connected to a modem and then just connect that modem to a wireless router using ethernet cables, just make sure that you configure the security passwords on your wifi router after setting up or you end up giving free wifi to your neighbors, usually the wireless router comes in with an installation disc and intructions on how you should connect and set-up your security.|`|RXBb8kx7aa	Probably your best option would be to go somewhere like Best Buy and ask the customer service desk if there is someone familiar with wireless routers. It's really simply to set up, but if you've never done it before, it will of course be overwhelming.<br>  <br>  Basically, you are looking for a router with wireless capabilities. This is the one that I have and it works great --> <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=7061751&st=netgear+router&type=product&id=1108125361676" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...</a><br>  Alot of internet providers will provide you with thier own router that isn't wireless. Whenever you buy a new router, the router suggestions and customer service people will tell you that you should replace the old router with the new one. Although possible, it's not necesarry and easier if you don't. Keep the old router and plug the new one into the old. This way, it's alot more simple if you don't know too much about how to set it up, it's almost plug and play, and you have magical wireless internet. I've used this method because it also acts as a port expansion for my router and I can suddenly plug in several more computers at once while still working wirelessly. Amazingly awesome Starcraft goodness.|`|4yiU7Qknaa	ya, you just have to get a wireless router and hook up your modem to the router and make sure all your computers have wireless capability.|`|2SSA9e9Naa	You got it.

Is it a re-conditioned PC ? You can always just add an external Memory to your old unit. The Memory on your is way outdated. That would barely hold MS WINDOWS XP ofiice 2007 all by itself. and thats a common home / office program<br>  A pc is only as good as its operating system. Compaq is OK !
edPeEGzmaa	Those are both ancient, and I honestly wouldn't spend money on either when you can pick up a modern dual core for a few hundred dollars from sites like Tigerdirect.<br>  <br>  Unless you're paying like $50 or less, don't even buy those computers. They are hardly better than the one that you have. <br>  <br>  The Gateway seems to be the better pick. It has a slightly faster CPU and more RAM, but the only downside is that it lacks the storage capacity of the Compaq.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I would honestly suggest that you get neither of these and look into a new lower end dual-core. They will outperform the Pentium 4's and usually come with between 2 to 4GB of DDR2 RAM, which also smokes any of the RAM found in the computers that you listed. 250-320GB hard drives are also the new standard in lower end desktops, and far better graphics cards too.<br>  <br>  It's just my opinion, but don't waste money buying products that won't even be an upgrade from your already outdated system. If your current computer suits all your needs, then keep on using it. If it doesn't, look at modernizing.<br>  <br>  Both of those computers offer no tangible improvements.|`|n0bFInLmaa	those 2 u listed shouldnt be more than $100 each.  i got mine for $100 used and working fine.  if compatilble, u can re-use RAM from ur old pc on the new one.|`|00sMjV8Qaa	I would not purchase used computers unless the seller can stand behind it with a good warranty.

It has a 64bit processor so you can run Windows 64bit as well as it is comparable to a Intel 3.5Ghz processor. It all ready has a large HD and the ram & video card would be a breeze to upgrade. <br>  <br>  The dells case is small & if you want to upgrade the graphics card or anything else you will have a hard time. the HD is less then half the size.<br>  <br>  But make sure you see it run & you get the windows or recovery disks & serial numbers that came with the computer.

79jtufEzaa	One major change, as of version 2, is object styles.<br>  This is very useful if you're doing certain things over and over again (example: formatting a certain ad for a newpaper or magazine the same way every time, though the text might change... or making every photo in an article have the same borders and visual effects).<br>  <br>  You can just preset the style, as in photoshop, click one or more objects, and apply the style you created...and that object will have everything change to match the style, including borders, fonts, colors, drop shadows, whatever.<br>  <br>  There's a new effects palette that lets you apply photoshop-style effects to any text without making a PSD in photoshop and then importing it. Transparency was also improved (separate controls for fill and stroke)<br>  <br>  Another useful thing is the improved bullets, numbering, and other stuff that helps if you make lots of table-of-contents stuff for books and catalogs.<br>  <br>  A few other things were changed in the visual interface. Palettes can easily be rearranged, grouped, hidden and brought back. You can view them in their full mode, or in a reduced mode that still shows some common options, or in a bare minimum mode with just buttons.<br>  You can further customize your menu items and the buttons at the top so you only have the commonly used features and none of the other stuff.<br>  <br>  Small things I liked:<br>  You can tell more clearly when several objects are grouped together. <br>  <br>  When you paste text you can choose to do it with the formatting of the original source or with the formatting of the existing textbox you're pasting into. Definitely helpful.<br>  <br>  You can save search and replaces that you used in the past, so for example if you want to unbold all the garamond text in a file, and reduce the size and font of all the impact text in the same file... you do it once, save that search'n'replace, then if you keep getting multiple files with that horrible bolding and impact abuse, you can just re-use the the same search and replace. Useful for example if you design real estate ads for a newspaper, and the realtor sends you something in word that has all these fonts and formatting you don't want.<br>  <br>  I don't use it much but snippets are a useful idea, new from CS2. You can highlight just a few parts of the existing page you're working on, and then drag and drop to the desktop. It makes a little .inds file. That file remembers the positioning and formatting of the elements you were working on. So if you get a new indesign file and you want to use that one's text and pix, but move stuff around to match your original file, you just load the snippet you made.

Personally I haven't tried any of them, just make sure you have a port open and you should max out your connection on good torrent.

Some system and log files are notorious for this (in both the WINDOWS and the DOCUMENTS AND SETTINGS folders).<br>  <br>  For someone to really specifically answer your question step-by-step, you're going to have to include your specific OS ("windows" isn't very informative: is it XP or Vista? are you using home or pro or business or media, etc?).<br>  <br>  And whether you're using Windows explorer to just copy the files, or using the Microsoft backup applet, or some third party backup program.<br>  <br>  And to further clarify: are you trying to backup your internal hardrive TO an external backup drive? Or an external backup drive TO an onboard optical drive? And if the external drive is a flash drive (like a thumb drive), or a "regular" hard drive.<br>  <br>  Regardless of the above though: if you can, try to use Microsoft's backup applet (it will just skip files it can't backup ...keeping in mind it doesn't support optical drives).<br>  <br>  If you're using Windows Explorer to copy files, first make sure that you have made system and hidden files visible (with settings in the Tools --> Folder Options --> View menus and tabs), don't try copying everything at once (this will help you discover WHICH file is causing the problem). Copy one folder at a time until you find one with a file that fails to copy (resulting in a popup error/warning). <br>  <br>  When you find a folder that fails, delete the contents of the copy ONLY (leave the root folder/name). Than copy each subfolder individually (to the root folder copy). Repeat this process (for as many subfolders as there are) until you find one with the "problem file". Then just don't copy that file.<br>  <br>  Yes, it can be pretty tedious (which is another reason to use Windows backup instead ...so long as you're not copying to an optical disk, at least).

So instead of Object.X++ it would be Object.X += velocity, where velocity is either negative or positive.

2LHgmq97aa	I would avoid the Mac.. (But your question was which one: Newer Macs have poorer build quality but older macs tend to be powerPC architecture which is Apple is dropping support for in new OS X versions)    You pay more for less Mac hardware than a PC...  Why? Because people don't realize that Mac uses a subset of PC hardware...    A number of PCs can also run OS X (Mac OS)  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=os+... as well just that Apple makes it illegal in order to get Market share.. The reason why Mac can run native Windows  is because it is using a subset of PC hardware,    If you decide to buy a Mac for running Windows, you will still have to get the same virus/spyware protection, and run into the same issues as a regular PC.    Now is a Mac worth buying for OS X?    I say:  NO... for the following reasons...    ADVANTAGES WINDOWS :  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows and most PCs have windows already pre-installed.  1) Some websites require Internet Explorer, to run IE on Mac you really get ies4osx which is the Windows version of IE running really buggy and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows.  2)  Supports devices (printers and other things you hook into the computer).  3) More business software/games  4) Want the dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.  5) Used by businesses.    ADVANTAGES LINUX :  1) FREE (most versions are)  2) Install software by eitjher 1) Synaptic Package Manager,  2) Add/Remove   3) Opening a .deb or .rpm file (depending on distribution)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION which can do any cool effect a Mac can do and many ore....  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Fbk52Mk...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3gkX9HDf...  (there is no flickering when you use it like on the video, not sure why the person has the flicker)  3)  Mac OS X Doc? google/yahoo Avant Window Navigator.Cairo Dock, http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3rf5q_...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0hzi22g2...  4) It is FASTERr/MORE SECURE to surf on the internet  5) Some Windows programs work with Wnehq/Crossover (also avail on Mac, but why pay $$$)    Instructions how to download, burn and boot  http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-v...  Dual Boot Instructions http://apcmag.com/how_to_dual_boot_windo...    SECURITY  Mac OS X was hacked in 2006 less than 30 minutes, and within 2 minutes in a contest in 2008 . Linux and Vista were not hacked until another day when restrictions were lowered. Vista was next, and then Linux.  Macs are standardized with Cameras, if your Mac gets hacked, the hacker can turn on your camera with more ease.  Please Note: All OS's have vulnerabilities.  http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/so...  http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/03/2...  http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft...    VIRUSES  Mac OS X has viruses (and significantly on the rise), a friend of mine has a virused Mac. As more users use Macs, more viruses will come out for it. Especially when users think "they are safe".  http://infosecurity.us/?p=4005  http://blogs.chron.com/techblog/archives...  http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/ar...    QUALITY/PROBLEMS  Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.    Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts. OS X also has problems slowing down.  http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-100202...  http://www.tuaw.com/2008/08/01/apples-qu...  http://www.appledefects.com/  |`|n8Xbu0gjaa	A dead mac try a PC

ebuxHnScaa	What exactly do you mean by "type of LCD panel"? Are you asking about S-IPS versus S-PVA or something? It's not clear from your question.    Basically, the smaller the LCD panel, the less power it uses. The lower you set the brightness and backlight, the less power it uses. A typical 19 inch LCD draws around 60 watts. A typical 45 inch LCD draws around 240 watts. (An approximate equation is:  watts used = 20 + .11 * (screen diagonal in inches)^2  The 20 watts approximates electronics overhead in decoding and processing the signals. The .11 is the approximate watts-per-square-inch needed to operate the backlight and panel transistors (corrected for the fact that the screen is not square).    Be careful when reading some specifications. Often the specification will be maximum power draw, which bears no relationship to how much power the panel will actually use under typical conditions.    You need to ask a more-specific question. It's definitely not self-explanatory.|`|VkXv4RInaa	do you mean which type of TV or flat panel?    How many types of LCD screens are there?    LCD uses less power than plasma|`|L3hc9EOiaa	most LCD's use about the same amount of power as each other, they all run a power supply that converts AC current to DC, to find exact wattage use, just look at the numbers on the power supply, it will read some thing like 240v 50 - 60 Hz and then ?? watts, the lower the last set of numbers = less power consumption, and bigger screen = more power
AA11064029	A java compiler converts the written source code into byte code.  The interpreter as you call it is also known as the java virtual machine which then interprets and executes the byte code.    This actually means that the compiler acts as a code validator to check for any syntax errors and a few programming errors before the code is executed as well as converting the code into a form that will be faster to execute.|`|PGMIrRrAaa	Me!

OcovssgKaa	Upon release Microsoft made the bald statement that aqnd I qoute 'Any machine that can run XP can run Vista' end quote. To start with this was very misleading. Yes we all know there is the Vista Upgrade Advisor however with making such a statement many people and rightfully so assumed Vista would run just fine.<br>  <br>  For example just think of the millions of XP computers out there with 256mb - 512mb RAM with 1ghz CPU's and Integrated Graphics. Trying to run Vista on those with all the AERO bells and whistles is simply impossible, plus we all know that Vista requires a bare minimum of 1gb RAM (2gb preferrable). So Hardware upgrades, drastic in some cases were necessary just to get Vista performing anywhere near a satisfactory standard. And if you had a compact XP machine then that option was very limited due to the lack of expansion slots for Graphics etc.<br>  <br>  Furthermore software compatability was a very large issue. Just imagine you've spent mega amounts of money that worked great with XP suddenly won't work with Vista. This was a major problem in many cases.<br>  <br>  Printer recognition was worse than dreadful even if it was only a year old, along with webcams, wireless etc. the list was endless.<br>  <br>  Windows 7 detects everything of mine with ease and so it should. All my XP software works without problems something Vista could never do.<br>  <br>  Seeing as I am a Linux user most of the time, I am finding myself being slated for praising Windows 7 but I am merely giving credit where it is due.<br>  <br>  Here is my experience with Windows 7 Beta to date.<br>  <br>  <br>  It boots up around 20% faster than Vista and it runs blisteringly fast for me with these specs.<br>  <br>  2.4ghz P4 CPU<br>  1gb PC2100 RAM<br>  256mb GeForce 6200<br>  <br>  Much better performance than Vista on the same machine.<br>  <br>  Windows Media Player 12 is awesome, finally no need for a third party application.<br>  <br>  It has the speed and stability of XP, and the looks and security of Vista. In short its everything Vista should have been.<br>  <br>  LUg.|`|lnL1ExDIaa	Well to me Vista is one of the most revolutionary Os from Microsoft since 95. But the reason why Vista gets crap from users is because it is more hardware intensive and because it's uses a new kernel 6.0 it needs updated drivers that companies took forever to produce. Also Vista I guess has some annoying security preventions to some people. All in all though Vista is a lot better then Xp you just need a updated system to run it.|`|D2GiPPjTaa	-_- I hate Windows xD but Vista because my PC is slow... Internet Explorer doesn't work well...

I've never used a Mac O.S before... but the adverts say they WORK...<br>  <br>  So hopefully... money can solve the problems of slow pc's...<br>  <br>  I've also heard they use much RAM ?? that is why Netbooks and some cheap laptop still have XP on, because they can't run Vista because it uses to much energy to keep it running, that there isn't enough to run other programs and multi task<br>  <br>  owner of a 2.2Ghz Dell Vostro 200 with 3gb Ram - it annoys me very much !!<br>  saving for a 3.06Ghz iMac with 4gb Ram|`|SK7MxFTnaa	It's a memory hog.<br>  <br>  And with almost all "Microsoft" products it's released before fully being tested...<br>  <br>  It's like shipping out a gun minus the safety and being told don't worry we'll fix that later.<br>  <br>  Poor engineering process at best.<br>  <br>  Bring back Microsoft BOB.|`|Y4v2tm3Naa	With the number of steps that Microsoft took in attempt to make the software more secure they have really taken a lot of options out of the hands of the consumer.  Windows vista doesn't like to use non-certified drivers which tends to force users to use older drivers that may not resolve an issue that a custom or yet to be certified driver does.  Another issue is networking, many computers are not upgraded to vista yet because of this the Vista networking protocol makes it difficult if not impossible to see other non-vista computers on your network without installing special networking protocols on every computer on the network.   And the biggest one for me is that vista while offering many nice features doesn't make it easy to install a bare bones version of the software, effectively bloating the software which isn't a big deal if your running top of the line computers but can significantly slow down a mid or low end computer.  Lastly the big marketing fubar that was introduced with vista where pc manufacturers were allowed to market pc's as vista ready when in reality they could install vista but only function in a partial and substandard way causing many people to upgrade their computers to have them become sluggish.|`|jjDWIy61aa	Well in my own experience (I used vista for a year before buying a mac), the problems I found were compatibility issues with older drivers, the fact that it seemed very buggy and broken, and that it was a very system heavy OS|`|TgUCZzyIaa	Most games doesnt work in it...|`|ULw1777caa	Incompatibility mostly.  That and people don't know how to use it cause it's "different".|`|Ev6WQRmzaa	Why isn't it a good OS?<br>  Well, because it's Windows :-P<br>  <br>  I actually liked Vista better than XP, the 3 main complaints people have are:<br>  1. "It's incompatible with a lot of stuff"<br>  -Maybe in the beginning, but 99% of software should work with Vista now<br>  <br>  2. "It's buggy"<br>  -I haven't had any problems with it that I didn't have with XP<br>  <br>  3. "It's bloated"<br>  -Computers today are a lot more powerful than they were when XP was released. It's pretty hard to find a computer that can't handle Vista decently nowadays

Best compression is achieved over text documents like txt,doc,wri,rtf..  Moderate and low compressions are over binary files such as applications,audio and video..    @Nathan: there are mainly 2 types of compression - lossless ans lossy..  what i have told above are all losses..  lossy compression is where u compromise quality for size like - jpg,png(lossy) over bmp(lossless) and mp3(lossy) over wave(lossless)..      but u get back the original data if u use th above 3 software..  and winzip is also lossess..|`|TuGkVqwraa	Compression Level depends on files.     Winzip is quite good in your case|`|xMqgB2GDaa	What are you trying to compress? Some things are easier to compress than others, given the right application. .wav files are one example of something easily compressible. .exe files are difficult to compress as there isn't typically much repetitive information. Also realize, the more you compress, the more chance there is for quality loss in media files, or data corruption in data files.    For data files, I actually prefer the old standby, WinZip. People never have to download a decompressor for it, as it's a fairly standard format. So for compatibility, I usually prefer it. For media files, just changing the file format to a lower bitrate usually suffices.
5pApP11Faa	Most home routers have some sort of log (all that I've run across in my travels) and they can be accessed from your router's management interface which is usually accessed via a web browser and the address of 192.168.1.X. or something similar. From here look for the Status section of the router's interface, you may see the DHCP log here as well; this shows you all the network addresses of your network users. The Security log should be under the section of the interface labeled "Security" (you may want to check with your product documentation for the specific location for your router). Both of these logs present information that may at best seem"cryptic" to an end user with little experience with networking, but don't worry it's easy once you get the hang of it.    The logs will have rows and columns of IP addresses and MAC addresses. Your IP address, if you're not familiar, is the address of your PC. The MAC address is the hardware address of the Network Interface Card, or NIC for short. Any device on the network has a MAC address, but not all have IP addresses (don't let this confuse youyou really don't need to know it for this). Other things like time and duration port number and so on may be available, this is a little different between manufacturers but they are all very similar.    What will you see, and why do you care? Well, the security log is going to let you know every little hit that your firewall took from an outside IP address. This is kinda neat and will convince any disbelievers of the importance of a firewall. You can actually use this information to find out where the Hits are coming from and with other factors, such as the port number, you can tell if this is really a threat or just some annoying maintenance.  You can also take a look at what IP addresses from inside the network went online, and where they went. With the help of your IP addresses list you can locate which IP is for what PC on your network and then follow their activity. Of course you can use this log to determine where your network users have been but you can also take this information to filter out addresses that you definitely don't want accessed from you network.|`|RfHrij3Gaa	R u sure?

But to look at them, you could do the following:    Open a dos command windows by clicking on " Start --> Run.." and then type "cmd" into the new window (without the quotes).  Hit enter and a black windows will open.  Now without doing anything else, just start typing "ipconfig" and hit enter.  You should now see 3 entries. One of which is the "default gateway" address. Something like 192.168.0.1 or any other number like it.  Then open internet explorer and enter this number into you address bar.  Your routers config screen should now pop up and probably ask you for a password.  If you do not know the password, chances are it is still on the default. Search google for " default password" and you should find it.|`|4DK8r18Saa	You need to tell us what Router you have.  Different routers have different Firmwares and have different ability's.    Also, if you did have logging on your router, and tried to check it today, it most likely won't show you anything.  Routers I have worked with require the user to enable the log (companies don't want to push what could be seen as a privacy intrusion on their users, even if its only for the user to see).    Depending on the manufacturer and model of router, as well as what version firmware it is running, the answer to your question is a big, "MAYBE?!".    Linksys generally lets you view who is connected to the wireless, and D-link lets you see the IP addresses different clients are connected to.    I have not yet seen a good logger that can tell you what the actual websites are (although if it records the website IP address, you can check it yourself.)  No router I have seen can tell you the content of e-mails or IM's, stuff like that.  That requires a packet sniffer, which you cant use on 99% of routers anyway (security reasons).    So if you can provide that info, we could help!

They are the "pits" (not that good at all) for iTunes and similar multimedia apps as they are not built for it.<br>  <br>  ALL the consumer-level Netbooks* have NO internal CD/DVD drives and the following MAXIMUM memory limits:<br>  Linux based: 512 MBs<br>  XP based: 1 GB (some RARE exceptions have 1.5 GBs)<br>  <br>  * There are newer so-called high-end Netbooks that come with more but they are generally pricier than laptops.<br>  <br>  Hard drives models average 80 GBs ( some have 160 GBs )<br>  <br>  Other models use SSD** (Solid State Drive) with no moving parts ( good when you move a lot as they are more "solid" (pun intended) ) but these are smaller in GBs and higher in cost.<br>  <br>  ** This is "similar" to the way USB memory stick work.<br>  <br>  You should get a affordable (not cheap) "Laptop" not a "Netbook" (you CAN get a few good ones at prices that would make a Netbook blush). The best way to find these is by doing research.<br>  <br>  As laptop specs change often, it is good to get non-vendor/non-partisan/non-groupie information so you should do some checking on these review/guide sites to help fine tune your search.<br>  <br>  At each site, start by checking some models and then compare them with others (or against each other) by choosing different options using boxes and drop down menus to customize the search and get what you want in your laptop ( there is even a way on some of those sites to look by inputting the price you are willing to pay to minimize the impact on your wallet ).<br>  <br>  Your time will not be wasted (after all, you get all this from the comfort of your home) and you should find something to your liking and budget.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stop 01 here: <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/?tag=hdr;snav" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/?tag=hdr...</a><br>  Stop 02 here: <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/products/computers/laptops.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/products/computer...</a><br>  Stop 03 here: <a href="http://review.zdnet.com/filter/laptops?categoryId=3121" rel="nofollow">http://review.zdnet.com/filter/laptops?c...</a><br>  Stop 04 here: <a href="http://www.notebookreview.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.notebookreview.com/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck on your research|`|58BYcQDaaa	you must be talking about ram, because computers these days dont have hard drives that small<br>  that is enough for general use, thats how much my laptop has.|`|OcaBCO7uaa	Most of the netbooks I've seen have 1 gig of ram and run some derivative of Linux, but I guess you can get to gigs and msoft office on one - for what you need, a netbook would suit your needs perfectly, and if you decide not to go the msoft os route you can always get openoffice and you'd have everything you need anyway.<br>  <br>  A lot of the netbooks I've seen have ~80 gig harddrives, which is enough for what you want to do.|`|Oliq3ZDnaa	They should be the same, as long as you know the speed of the Memory, you should be able to find it in stores like Frys, if you choose to expand and work faster.

by9b94M4aa	It could need re-installing. I have this on my daughters PC every now and then. Go to the ethernet card in Device Manager. Right click on it and choose 'Un-Install'. Then scan for hardware changes -that's the icon on the toolbar at the top that looks a bit like a computer screen with a magnifying glass diagonally across it. This will re-detect your ethernet card and set it up again.    This normally works for me. Other causes are corrupt drivers. You can try downloading and installing new device drivers for your model of ethernet card. This does not always work as Windows says that it is using the best drivers. If this is the case try a system restore back to a time when the ethernet port was working.    If none of the above works then I suspect there is a hardware problem. try another card in this case.|`|xKlNK3kKaa	It needs a driver.  Go to whereever you bought it from (IE dell.com) and download the drivers for it.

Other free anti-spyware programs would be Spybot Search & Destroy, Adaware, AVG Anti-spyware (formally Ewido), A-squared, Spyware Terminator and SpywareBlaster.<br>  <br>  If you do not have an updated anti-virus program always running, you need to get one. Install only one, but you can get AVG, Avast! or AntiVir for free.<br>  <br>  Running virus removal programs in Safe Mode (tap F8 as the computer boots up and choose to boot to safe mode) can be more effective. The idea behind the Safe Mode is that the operating system would only load your essential programs and drivers to the memory and hence there is a “high” chance that the virus-infected file is on the drive but not loaded into memory. <br>  <br>  I strongly recommend using Firefox as your primary Web browser, It is safer and beter than Internet Explorer. Get the add-on NoScript for Firefox to prevent click-jacking. The AdBlock Plus extension will allow you to surf virtually ad-free.|`|rSqSxIyOaa	There is a program called Privacy Guardian made by PC Tools that filters out violations of your privacy.  Most of the time the violations that it finds are harmless but if you really are being hacked it might let you know.  Try it on a trial basis.

For like $10 more, you can get a Radeon 4650 or GeForce 9500GT. Those cards can play titles like Call of Duty, Half-Life 2 etc, which the 3650 would struggle with.  So if you don't already have it, buy something else.<br>  <br>  But for FSX, the Sims, World of Warcraft- it's fine!

The way to avoid the error is to always append a blank string (which isn't the same as a null string) to a text field:    comdest.AddItem ("" & path.Fields(b))    That way, if the field is null, you're adding a blank item.  If you want to avoid blanks in the combo box, use    If Not (IsNull(path.Fields(b))) Then  comdest.AddItem (path.Fields(b))  End If

hXHBm1BSaa	Do NOT uninstall a perfectly working security program. If it put files in the vault it is working. Go to http://free/avg .com and download it again. Lrt the installer run and it will offer a repair option. Choose that and it replaces all files. Then run an update and it will be OK. For additional safety you can start in safe mode and do a scan with it. This allows it to handle files which are generally locked by the system. A  good extra is to download malwarebytes. This is purely a scanner. Install and update it. Then run a quick scan. It may require a restart to finish repairs. This will catch things ordinary anti-spyware can not. It is a bit heavy handed but worth keepin on the machine for emergencies, like accidentally clicking a bad install link, which would tell AVG you want this so leave it alone.|`|jI85GYGoaa	Contrary to the comments of 'Genius' - I have found it useful to run 2 virus tools at times.  admittedly some are not compatible with others - You dont mention which internet securuty youre running but one that doesnt take up much CPU space or causes slow running is Avast antivirus - even the free version is surprisingly effective (from CNET downloads.    As to your last point - yes by all means send the error info to AVG - I assume its freeware - they rely in this to improve the product.    This will probably re-set AVG automatically - If not simply re-install.    Best Wishes|`|5O7op0oIaa	No, AVG will offer to remove everything from the vault when you uninstall. However, uninstalling then reinstalling will most likely correct the problem.    If you want a one-shot scan to double-check AVG, use Trend Micro's online scanner.      And for the bloke above - no nerd worth his salt would ever recommend installing two antivirus solutions, as they tend to start having quarrantine wars.      EDIT: colinc - Reinstalling over a broken program is nowhere near as useful as uninstalling - and preferably removing any remnants by hand. Running a repair install will not reliably fix broken configuration files; for example, you try doing this when AVG bumps into its (depressingly common) ctf file bug. Repairing will not help you. Removing, cleansing, and reinstalling is almost always a far better solution.    Furthermore, as an 'Unspecific error occured in AVG', I would contend that it doesn't really qualify as a 'perfectly working security program'...|`|f2AWSb48aa	You don't need two virus scanners, even if half the nerds in the country say you do. It's just simply not necessary, takes up memory and disc space.|`|AA10834300	No, that would be very bad if AVG designed their software that way.    Generally when you uninstall AVG you will either be notified that their are some viruses in the vault - do you want to delete them?    ...or AVG will just automatically delete them as part of the uninstall process.    Either way, you computer will still be safe when you uninstall AVG.    You don't actually need to uninstall AVG you just need to disabled the realtime scanner, as that is the part of the scanner that conflicts.    I'm not exactly sure how you disable the realtime scanner in AVG, I believe you go into the settings screen and disable it there. As long as the realtime element is disabled then you will be fine.    Basically two virus scanners cannot have their realtime scanning functions enabled at the same time on the same machine.        To find out what the unspecified error was, go into AVG and check the Properties screen, it should tell you which module is faulting.    It sounds like you do with uninstalling AVG anyway and reinstalling the latest fresh version.    Good luck.|`|9itlEv7Saa	I have Avast running on my Pc, and it's on. all the time. It works correctly, finds stuff and quarantines it. I can also delete this quarantine stuff when I want.    I also have Super anti spy installed, but not running. (avast and SAV don't get on!) I simple disconnect my PC from the internet. Shut Avast down then start/Run Superantispyware.   When finished shut it down, and restart the avast scanner.    I have also done the same for online scanners . because again they don't get on.    You can only have one Anti Virus scanner working at one time, However, some scanners are better then others at finding hidden stuff. (real time scan, or access protection, all this same thing!)    Uninstalling anti virus will usually give you a message asking if you want to delete the quarantined items, but somewhere within the program there will be an option to do this without uninstalling.
85yI99bGaa	It's when 10-25 nerds get together and go beat up on video game monsters that take 10-25 nerd's video game characters to kill.  Raids are pretty much what your goal is to do when you hit level 80 if your focus is PvE (player vs environment).  They are basically just super dungeons that take a lot of well geared people to make it through.  10 man raids are the current "normal" raids, and 25 man raids are the same dungeons, but a lot harder versions of them and are the "heroic" raids.|`|0DrKZvJaaa	Raids are when around 10-25 players get together in a large group and go into high level dungeons in order to do quests for gold,items and in most cases for special set items known as tiers.

gp0UKiTjaa	Windows Vista itself requires minimum 512 MB RAM to operate as it is more advanced and it contains lots of feature more that XP. When you run any game, it gets loaded first into RAM. So the more application runs, the less RAM space will be available. So to play a game with better speed, it is always recommended to have more RAM. You can upgrade upto atleast 2 GB on all the laptop.

Just go to the Control Panel-->Mobile PC-->Change Battery Settings.    If this doesn't help you probably have a serious problem and should take it back to the store if it is relatively new.

4a3e0ab4ecb4787c195a06580c2aa131aa	no, you don't have to reinstall Windows, but it may start complaining that the hardware has been changed - like the onboard graphics card. The new m/b should come with a driver CD. if the driver or CD isn't there then go to the Device Manager and find the make of the problem hardware and get the driver off of the internet. The manufacturer's website is always a good place to start.    Do not delete your System32 directory. This is a main Windows system folder and it's needed.

QePbhS8Caa	Why do you need to hide them? From who? That will help determine how helpful and answer can be.    If you're in some sort of trouble and want someone to be able to do something with said pictures in the event of your demise then your best bet is to get a lawyer. You put the pics in a sealed envelope and give them to the lawyer along with instructions on what to do with them should you die.    If you don't want them seen and you're just hiding them from someone at home get a flash drive and encrypt it.    If you don't want them seen and someone with more skill and knowledge will be looking for them, then your best bet is still a flash drive, you just need a good place to hide it where no one would think to look.    Actually, with a flash drive you could skip the lawyer and give it to a trusted friend if you wanted something done with them after your demise, depending on the seriousness of the situation.|`|ZUlnZvaWaa	Send them to me, the contact info is in my profile.

That way you have a quick link, and it will stay where it was by default as well.<br>  <br>  You are asking a very vague question though. There are a number of different desktop GUI's such as KDE, GNOME, and Xfce. There are also thousands of distros of Linux available, so your specific version might not have the path I described.<br>  <br>  Check the help forum for your distribution though if you are unsure. Also look into IRC channels, as they can be very useful.|`|5zSSGKBpaa	Go to the menu and search through the menu items.

If you need something more specific (like multiple area OSPF, MPLS or whatever) just search for "cisco ____ lab topology" <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.  Cheers.
TtZ9zQpraa	48 mbps = 48 megabits per second<br>  8 mb = 8 megabytes (per second perhaps?)<br>  1 byte = 8 bits<br>  <br>  so yes it's definitely slower; the big reason why your internet connection is slow is because of the traffic/congestion from your neighbors. you guys are sharing the bandwidth: if some guy is constantly downloading p2p or bittorrent, everyone else in the general area will experience a slower connection. it's almost impossible to get it up to the 8mb cap, only way you can do this is to stop all your neighbors from using the internet.<br>  <br>  here are somethings you can do to try and improve speed:<br>  1. reset the connection - turn it off then wait then turn it back on<br>  2. contact your internet service provider to upgrade to a faster internet speed (T3, T1, DSL)<br>  <br>  Edit: Without getting into the boring technical details, there will still be some congestion even in rural neighborhoods. Further, rural areas don't get as fast a service compared to less rural areas (data has to travel farther), as most service providers tend to be in the major cities.

If you have a wireless or wired router, your download times may be slower becasue the router may be slowing it down. There are ways to speed up your router though.

zorYTX59aa	If this is only the first time that this is happening<br>  to you, I wouldn't worry for too long. Many times <br>  every day, YouTube shuts down quite a lot of its<br>  servers without telling anybody so that they can <br>  update various stuff. <br>  <br>  However, I am beginning to see many questions <br>  just like yours on Yahoo!, so I recently did a ton <br>  of Googling, searching, reading -- poring through<br>  all variations, combinations & search results for:<br>  -- "youtube", "password"<br>  -- "username", "user name"<br>  -- "log", "login", "log-in"<br>  -- "sign", "signin", "sign-in"<br>  -- "doesn't let me", "does not let me"<br>  -- "won't let me", "will not let me"<br>  -- "can't log", "cannot log"<br>  -- "doesn't log", "does not log"<br>  -- "won't log", "will not log"<br>  as well as using the word "sign" rather than "log".<br>  <br>  After all that time, the best that I could come up<br>  with were these possibilities:<br>  <br>  1) There might be something awkward with your<br>  security software or firewall. Maybe it will not let<br>  you send out any of your personal information --<br>  or if you are rather young, it's possible that your <br>  parents have put a "block" on it.<br>  <br>  2) If you have Firefox, your problem may have to<br>  do with "cookies" or "exceptions". If cookies are <br>  "accepted", YouTube might be an "exception" --<br>  therefore you should "allow" YouTube to puts its<br>  cookies on your computer or "remove" YouTube<br>  from the "Exceptions" list. This is all accessible<br>  by clicking Tools > Options > Privacy.<br>  <br>  3) I don't understand the logic, but one guy on a <br>  forum discussion thread said he hit "CTRL" plus<br>  "F5", and for some reason it worked for him.<br>  <br>  4) There's a grainy YouTube video of an old lady <br>  with a rather clever idea: delete your passwords.<br>  Things can sometimes get "hairy" if a computer<br>  has many IDs and passwords. For example, I'm<br>  'inukjuak89' on YouTube, 'inukjuak90' on Yahoo,<br>  and other names on different sites. Also, all my <br>  passwords are different as well.<br>  <br>  Thus, one thing you may want to do is to check<br>  all your passwords. Believe it or not, she states<br>  you can actually see every one inside of Firefox. <br>  (I don't know because I'm a true devotee of IE6.) <br>  Here are her instructions, plus the YouTube link:<br>  <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=k0F90GAd17k" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=k0F90GAd17k</a><br>  <br>  5) The only other thing I can think of is "cookies".<br>  Perhaps a bad or false "cookie" has stuck itself<br>  in your computer and is sending out either false <br>  or wrong information. Even if you don't think that <br>  is the case, clear your "cache" of all its cookies. <br>  While you are at it, do the same with all of your <br>  "temporary internet files" and your "history" -- in <br>  order to reset everything. Whatever problem you<br>  may be having, this is something you should be<br>  doing at least every couple weeks:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  If any of these quasi-solutions solves your issue,<br>  please click my avatar and let me know, so that <br>  I may incorporate them into future YA questions <br>  similar to yours.<br>  <br>  Here are the links to two websites that you may <br>  find interesting if you use Firefox:<br>  <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Cookies" rel="nofollow">http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Cook...</a><br>  <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Cookies" rel="nofollow">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Cookies</a>|`|uLU3GeO5aa	did you confirm your e-mail address when you made the account?

While this handler is processing no other events are being allowed to happen.<br>  <br>  Even if you code worked an changed the card, the repainting of the new card won't happen until either the current event handler is finished processing (currently stuck in a loop) OR you give a DO EVENTS command which will allow the program to temporarily break away and process the repainting of the form then return and continue processing the event handler.<br>  <br>  Because of the endless loop there is no way to stop the program other than by pressing the stop button in debug mode or terminating the process via CTRL-ALT-DEL.<br>  <br>  Your Code:<br>  >>><br>  Private Sub imgRndCard_Click()<br>  Do<br>  imgCard(random).Top = 480 AND imgCard.Left = 2520<br>  Loop<br>  End Sub<br>  <<<<br>  <br>  The Do/ Loop is telling the computer to repeat whatever instructions you have placed in between the DO and LOOP instructions. The problem is that YOU have not given instructions on how to exit that loop. <br>  You need to have some condition that will be met which will then allow the computer to stop Looping. Usually a counter variable is incremented by one for each pass through the loop and in the LOOP instruction a WHILE instruction is placed with a condition that when becomes true will stop looping<br>  <br>  Dim ctr as integer<br>  Do<br>  ctr += 1 'increment by 1<br>  'more code instruction to do whatever go here<br>  <br>  Loop While (ctr < 10)<br>  <br>  (The above code will loop 10 times then exit the loop and handle additional instructions or reach the End of the Sub/Function and exit the event handler)<br>  <br>  YOUR CODE LINE<br>  imgCard(random).Top = 480 AND imgCard.Left = 2520<br>  <br>  Is also wrong . Comment it out and get the loop to work first then post another Q for this error after getting your loop to work|`|AA11142539	random is a float point i believe.  you're going to want to make sure it's an integer, and inside the bounds of your array.

gebIjqnWaa	I would do a system restore before I did anything else. Sounds like you got a virus which corrupted your system. Reinstall your operating system then run a good anti-virus program. If you don't have a clean backup copy of your files, then you could simply reintroduce the culprit. Shouldn't a good copy of XP professional open itself when inserted in the drive? Good luck in restoring your system.

AA10654797	Your pc probably is set to use a certain amount of whats called virtual memory which is no more than a cache on the hard drive. You can increase this amount but in any event, using this memory is a poor method as it takes time to access the harddrive. This slows things down. NOTHING works better than good ole ram.|`|ytNlz3b7aa	Different purposes and accessed differently. The basic functionality of the motherboard would have to be rewired.|`|5A8M1s45aa	First of all cache memory is very fast memory that the processor can access much more quickly than main memory or RAM.Cache memory attempts to bridge the gap between fast, expensive memory that can be made in limited quantities, and the large amounts of RAM needed for modern applications. By giving the processor a small amount of fast memory to used, and then having that memory read in and write to main memory in "spare" time, the processor can operate at full speed much of the time.<you can read more on this explanation from the website stated below><br>  <br>  thus, main purpose of a cache memory is to ensure that the main memory is not overloaded during very high number of concurrent accesses.it stores the recently and most frequently accessed information.and it is designed accordingly and accesses the data in main memory based on the locations and addresses. so as far as i know it actually cannot be used as a main memory because it is designed with the purpose of providing high speed and efficient backup to the main memory.|`|d6WjwRcDaa	(Assuming that you are asking about processor cache)<br>  Cache memory is extremely expensive because of its<br>   high throughtput/low latency characteristics.Even the best quad core that u can buy today has only 12 MB of cache. Now how can you use that much as the main memory? 12 MB is way too low man.<br>  You might argue that atleast it can be used to store small modules of repetative instructions. But thats what it has been doing!<br>  So technically you are still using cache memory as main memory!

Answers in indirectly encouraging the nations schoolchildren to access blocked websites whilst in school.  School computers are provided by taxpayers exclusively for school work.  Websites such as MySpace, Facebook, YouTube and similar sites are exclusively leisure activities which have no place within the school environment.  For a respected site such as Yahoo! Answers to provide the means for schoolchildren to exchange information about proxy websites (for the purpose of accessing blocked websites on school computers) is considered to be unacceptable and unpatriotic.  It is considered that Yahoo Inc. has a moral duty to require Yahoo! Answers to ban questions pertaining in any way to accessing blocked websites in the school environment.  As a sizeable minority of rebellious youngsters seem unwilling and/or incapable of obeying rules and respecting the authority of their school districts; Yahoo Inc. must itself take positive action to protect our schoolchildren from the error of their ways.|`|C2ZrBKJfaa	Myspace is something that will have to wait until you get home from school.

There is nothing that important that you have to bypass the internet filter that can't wait until school/work is dismissed.

There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time.
pUzJiMUcaa	You're going to need to use the LIKE keyword in place of the equals operator, and my experience is that you will need to concatenate your wildcard char when using a parameterized query...something like this:    SELECT * FROM stock WHERE category LIKE '%' + @cat + '%'    That will return "concat" or "category"....also, make sure you are at least passing an empty string to your type parameter, null parameters throw errors (at least, in MSSQL...not sure about other platforms)|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Depending on the database program, the wildcard is either * or %.  Try them both and use the one that works for your database.  If the string is left blank, just don't build that part of it.  Pseudocode:    have_where = false  STRING = SELECT   if where1  blank {  STRING = STRING + WHERE FIELD1 = where1  have_where = true  }  if where2  blank {  if have_where {  STRING = STRING + AND FIELD1 = where2  } else {  STRING = STRING + WHERE FIELD1 = where2  }|`|aab8fee4bb00a3a37d38643f4e296de7aa	You can't have two where clauses like that.     you need to use an AND operator instead    where stock.category = @cat  AND stock.type = @type '      As far as your other question, I think someone else got that for you,    You need to check the value of the variable at whatever point it would be assigned, depending on whether or not a value is assigned run a differnt query.|`|dXk0vY54aa	im not a fan of building dynamic sql strings unless really necessary.    assuming i understand that @type is an optional parameter, id write it this way:    SELECT   Stock.Code,   Stock.ShortDesc,   Stock.ImgSmallPath,   Stock.SellPrice,   Stock.Category,   Stock.Type,   Stock.Name   FROM Stock   INNER JOIN Instock ON Stock.Code = Instock.Code   WHERE   stock.category = @cat   AND stock.type =  case  when @type is not null then @type  else stock.type  end    i also notice that your doing an inner join to instock, but its not mentioned in any of your selects or in your where.|`|fYrjwcPpaa	% is the wildcard that you would need for this instance.    * is used to select "all" from the db      for your case, if you wanted to find all usernames that begin with 'abc,' you would add this to your query:  WHERE username LIKE '%abc%'

However, the definition and conversion is still the same.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	The date is a pseudo-Julian date (or it might be the actual Julian date) - the number of days, or the number of seconds, since a particular point in time.  To edit the raw number, you have to know the starting point for the particular system - Julian date starts somewhere around March 1, 0001.  Unix date, IIRC, starts at midnight GMT on January 1, 1970.    Given 2 points, as you have, you could figure out the starting point.  You could even write a program to convert between the 2 formats.  (If the forum is written in PHP, it's Unix date, and you can use a PHP program to handle it - look in the PHP help file, under date for all sorts of conversions.)|`|AA11314954	M.L. is wrong, Colanth is correct.

nSBPfPUkaa	Don't touch it - it's a scam.  - The email from PayPal is not, in fact, from PayPal - it is from someone pretending to be them - almost certainly the person who wants your keyboard.  They never hang onto money until you send them a shipping note and the grammar is incorrect in places (which it never is from PayPal).    - The phone number is suspect too - +44 is the code for the UK, but 070 is a "personal number" which is hard to trace.  - There is no such thing as an "orchestra band" in English.  - an orchestra has no need of a keyboard  - they are offering to pay way over the odds for the keyboard  - you should never deal with someone who is not the proper buyer of the equipment.  So. report it to eBay as a scam and tell the buyer again that unless you see the money in your account, you will not ship the item - you will not send shipping codes anywhere.  I bet you never hear from them again.  Alternatively, you could make up a fake shipping code and send that to them.  They want you to ship the item before they pay PayPal, which is why they have created a fake email from PayPal to pretend that they have already paid.|`|0003934bb4332a9e445607b7d52efbdeaa	I would say SCAM!

SNBG0Y5eaa	If you're used to Windows and are a Windows expert user, the Mac interface will be very frustrating. There are many little things and habits you have to unlearn and learn how to do on the Mac. One of the most frustrating things for me (I use both back and forth) is the CTRL and ALT key functions are flipped on a Mac--Use the Command key for CTRL functions, and use the CTRL key for ALT functions. Things like that, and that all window menu bars are not attached to the window itself but the all occupy a single menu bar at the top of the display that keeps changing depending on the application. And you can only resize windows from the lower right corner. Getting use to only one mouse button functions. Very frustrating little things like that.     If you're not a very savvy Windows user and don't do a lot of system configurations or already have a lot of Windows software you need, then you'll probably like the Mac a lot better because it looks slicker and it's simplified to be as dummy-proof as possible. You'll get fewer fatal errors on a Mac because all the main software are all built by the same company to run on its OS, but then you end up paying extra for that too.|`|PlhsPfBKaa	Well windows will be releasing windows 7 in april although i quite like the mac os it doesn't take too long to become more comfortable and it is a more stable and better os than vista|`|08b1a1c7d78e55ad55c2a98e5184a6e1aa	i prefer windows because i think its developing faster then mac|`|RKiPEgwSaa	Mac-no viruses  Win-more compatibility  It is all up to you, and judging off of other people's opinion is not always the best way.

Why don't you try out a Mac and see if you like it or not? You don't know someone who has a Mac or have an Apple store near you? That's the best way to know. If you try it and like it, get a Mac. If you try it and don't like it, get a Windows PC.

pUzJiMUcaa	Up your screen resolution. Right click on your desktop and select "Properties". Under the "Settings" tab, move the Resolution slider to the right. This will make things a bit smaller on your screen. Most professionally designed websites are set up to accommodate 800 x 600 minimum resolution. Other sites may not be set up like this though, and I'd recommend 1024 as the smallest resolution you might use.    Aside from this, you can use firefox to zoom out on a single website by holding down CTRL and scrolling your mouse wheel.|`|ZEvl6JoUaa	The reason it happens is that the width of the page you are viewing is greater than the window you are viewing it in.   Solution: increase your default screen resolution by going to display properties (windows: right click on the desktop -> properties-> settings). If it's maxed out you can only get a bigger screen.  Sometimes you can't improve it on some sites as the sites default width, length is set to very high.
4QmgVhS5aa	Windows freezes or stops responding frequently.  This issue could be caused by any of the below possibilities.   1. Software related issue.   2. Driver related issue.   3. Operating system related issue.   4. Heat related issue.   5. Hardware issue.   6. Serious issue with Windows   7. Hardware failure.        An easy way to determine if your computer is in this situation is by pressing the Num Lock button on the keyboard and watching the Num Lock led to see if it turns off and/or on.  If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue. If you're encountering lockups when the computer is opening a particular program, make sure you have all the latest updates for that program.   Update your registry cleaner tool, scan you pc.  Use the tool: http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere... [if you do not have one]  Driver related issue   A computer lock up can also be caused by drivers. For example, if there is an issue that exists with your video drivers a computer could lock up while playing a game or displaying any other type of video. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all major devices in your computer (video, sound, modem, and network). Operating system related issue   Make sure your operating system has all of the latest updates installed on it.   Heat related issue   If the computer processor is getting too hot it can cause the computer to freeze. If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this could indicate a fan may be failing in your computer.|`|EX1GjjJCaa	You're probably using too much memory and too much of your processor.

As Jima^^ said, Norton is very fallible to viruses and is hard to remove from your computer. http://www.antivir.com. I am not suggesting kaspersky because it is for sale although it works best (I actually benchmark antimalwares!) but if you are up to a full cleanup, you can get the trial version (http://kasperskylabs.com) as the symptoms on your computer may also be a result of a malware infection (browser/BHO hijack).

For some reason iTunes does NOT work well (if at all) with Vista.    Try going to the Microslut...er, Microsoft website (microsoft.com), and drop in on the FAQ pages. If you can't find the answer there, try the Apple website.    If you manage to actually make the iPod work with Vista, you're a better hacker/man/whatever than any number of poor souls I've heard of. (The fact that Microsoft brought-out the Zune - which requires *no* special programs to use - is irrelevant...the fault has to do with coding in the iTunes programs and iPods themselves.)

This will replace existing codecs and install additional codecs which will allow you to play many different filetypes (more than can be played with the standard set of Windows codecs).

hwiu7TCYaa	If you don't want to use YouTube, and you are interested in how its best achieved. then you should take a look at flash, for best cross-browser/platform compatibility.    While you can link the video directly, this would require IE to download the entire file before it would start playing, this is solved by having a "wrapper" file, which includes your video.    Done by including the below actionscript on your first frame in the wrapper.  -----StartCode-----  _root.loadMovie(_root.path,0);  -----CodeEnd-----    The video is then embedded with the below code.  -----StartCode-----    data="Player.swf?path=Video.swf" style="width:320px;height:240px;">    value="Player.swf?path=Video.swf">    -----CodeEnd-----    You could also embed Media Player, realplayer, or quicktime. But these generally tend to annoy users.    All the options each have their own disadvantages, and even though flash is currently both the best option, when it comes to accessibility, and when it comes to clean and valid code. Using it can be rather hard for beginners, so i would recommend to use a site like YouTube if possible.    Another problem is brandwidth usage, if you get to many visitors, your host could potentially close your account due to the high brandwidth usage. This is however not much of an issue on dedicated servers, where you pay for the brandwidth.|`|vzrnBneNaa	Hi,    Looks like you are a HTML beginner.

bcf5161b8e89943df5e46529cbd48ff9aa	Your school has rules that are meant to be followed. If you signed any kind of Internet Acceptable Use Agreement, you would be breaking your "contract" with the school and could lose all computer privileges. Videos and streaming music are often blocked for a couple reasons. One, they take up a lot of bandwidth, which can disrupt the day-to-day operations of other users. Two, if you bypass the school's Acceptable Use Policy and view inappropriate content, you may be criminally liable for those actions.     My advice: listen to music on your personal music device, and save the videos and radio for home. If personal music devices are not permitted either, use your free time to get reacquainted with your friends!|`|6Xreht4Qaa	There's new proxies every day on :    http://www.pr0xyblog.com    Be sure to tell your friends, and post it to your myspace page or blog, so others can enjoy ;-)    Happy Surfing !|`|CzBNTeLAaa	No, sorry.

In the meantime, you can bring a book, portable gaming devices, or iPod / mp3 players (if allowed) to help have some fun during free time.|`|HWuZd2NMaa	Please allow me to set some things clear first:    A browser is:   1. Software that provides graphical access to the World Wide Web  2. A program used to view HTML documents.  3. A Client program (software) that is used to look at various kinds of Internet resources.    So, a "by pass browser" (meaning whatever you think it means) does not exist. Besides, you would have to install it on the machine and my guess would be that you won't be able to do that.    In order to see all that "awesome" things you like, you'd have to somehow circumvent the local proxy rules set by the school authorities (yes, the school uses a proxy. Go figure). There are many ways to do that. A "by pass browser" isn't one of them. Why? Because they don't exist (as previously stated). So, you can either:    1. Try to cheat the system in some other way. You'll probably get caught.  2. Check all that "awesome" things you like at home. If you don't have Internet access at home, then too bad.  3. Do something entirely different in your free time. Instead of online chat, you can chat with your friends in school. Dont have any? Make some. Instead of playing on the pc, you could actually play a real sport. Instead of reading blogs, you can read a book or a newspaper. The possibilities are endless.

Q5Nn9Fxoaa	There are actually a couple of different ways to do this.<br>  <br>  One Method, which I prefer, is to use MS Word, and protect simply that one file.<br>  <br>  After you are done updated your file in MS WORD, First left-click on the "Tools" menu and then select "Options" from the drop down menu.<br>  <br>  On the "Options" screen that appears you must left-click on the 'Security' tab to display the window shown below. <br>  <br>  Once you have clicked on the 'Security Tab' you must enter a password in the 'Password to Open:' box. Doing this prevents anyone from being able to open the document without the password you assign.<br>  <br>  <br>  Method 2:  Download WinZip or WinRar.  You can then take your document and add them to a new archive.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>      * Make sure you choose an easy to remember password<br>      * If there are any other copies of the files make sure to disspose of them<br>      * If you forget your password it would be very difficuult to gain access to the files again<br>  <br>  Step1: Highlight the files you want to protect and right click them<br>  <br>  Step2: Once you have WinRAR installed the context menu should have a few options pick "Add to Archive"<br>  <br>  Step3: Once the window has loaded up choose the tab at the top which says "Advanced"<br>  <br>  Step4: On there choose the button near the bottom right which says "Set Password" and then enter your password and confirm it<br>  <br>  Step5: Click OK and alow it to be added to an archive, now if you want to access the files you will be asked for a password|`|9BTWrSTQaa	As far as i know there is no way to password protect a folder (im assuming we're talking windows of any version here as opposed to mac/linux). u can password protect the files, it should be at the top bar (file, edit etc.) or do what i would do and hide the folder away in the windows folder where nobody ever looks try having three or four "mask" folders to throw people off
