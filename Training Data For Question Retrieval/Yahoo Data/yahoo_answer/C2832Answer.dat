If you love her enough, you can stick around to see what happens. If I were you, I would probably split up again. She seems like she is not willing to stop talking to her ex, so I would almost guarantee you that she will cheat on you (if she hasn't done so already).

5CaUKakNaa	I know what you mean about Golden Buddha,.. not my favorite either. <br>  This may not be exactly what you're looking for, and it's a little distance, but if you go into Tucker and you're on La Vista road, head down to Lakeside Mall. Once you go, enter through the food court in the back and as your walking through you should see a sprint store at your left. Keep going down until you See Mongolian Express I think. =/ <br>  It's FABULOUS!! I eat there every week about! I love it! Mall food yes, good hell to the yes. lol And you get your money's worth for sure!
m13Se2dAaa	I'd recommend the Frolic Room - at the other end of Hollywood Blvd. right next to the Pantages. Yeah, it's gentrified over the years and has far more hipsters than regular joes, but it's still fun, loud (great jukebox) and cheap.<br>  <br>  It's a long walk from the knitting factory, but probably worth just parking once somewhere for the night. Plus, you can peruse the rest of the boulevard while you're at it.

AA10975447	Most of the blowfish served in LA is not served as sushi. Instead you can find it in K-Town as bokfish. It's usually not served raw, though. It's popular as a Korean stew.<br>  <br>  I would strongly caution you against pursuing fugu, though. There are only two distributors of fugu in the US. It often comes from China. You've already heard plenty in the news about contaminated Chinese products. How would you like to know that China is processing the fugu that comes here, and that I've seen 3 cases of fugu poisoning? They didn't die, but they were hospitalized at Harbor-UCLA with neurological problems. This was in the last 2 years. Oh! And the boxes the fish came in were deliberately mislabeled in English, probably to slide it by the Customs Inspectors.<br>  <br>  Fugu is incredibly toxic, and I'd be concerned about the safety of its handling and supply.|`|Sah5tjD8aa	There is one up in San Francisco.

It specifically says:<br>  <br>  Because safety is a priority, "You Got 30 Minutes?" is not a guarantee, but an estimate. You may get more.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	As others have noted.  Dominoes lost a few lawsuits because accident victims claimed that the delivery drivers were driving recklessly to try to make the 30 minute guarantee.  Thus Dominoes no longer guarantees 30 minutes.  They promise it.<br>  <br>  And claiming they must not care anymore is just plain stupid.  They know that people still want their pizza delivered hot and fresh and fast, and it only takes one screwup to get people to start calling someone else.  Pizza delivery is a competive business, there's no room for screwups.|`|1mERfDfVaa	Years ago, probably b4 u were born, a young lady was killed by a Domino's driver trying to beat the 30 limit.

Expect to be nervous.  Keep the interviewers eye during the questions, but don't sweat the questions too much.  They're a lot more interested in how you conduct yourself then what your answers are.  Do answer truthfully when you're asked how many hours you can work per week, and when you're available.  You might want to talk that over with your parents before the interview.  If you do, let the interviewer know that's what you did..  that sort of thinking ahead impresses hiring types.<br>  <br>  As for the work..  it's very hard, and you'll learn really fast just what you're worth.

6OnqUyseaa	The average courteous tip is 15%.|`|1uvrkDWNaa	I wouldn't go back to that restaurant if I were you.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	It was wrong because the norm is at least 10%, with 20% being for good service. She was upset because she thought maybe she did something wrong to deserve such a small tip. That is really cheapo of you to do and wrong. These servers make nothing per hour ( the law allows something like $2.50 per hour salary) and depend on tips to survive, and if she gave you good service you should tip for it.|`|k8HpMaHxaa	I dont think there is anything wrong with a waitress asking that! its a perfectly acceptable question. 15% should have been 11.00. Even if it was only a few dollars under, its not a the standard tip for good service. You didnt mention any problem with the service, so I dont see why you wouldnt want to tip her a decent amount.<br>  <br>  If a table under tips a server, why should she NOT ask if she did something wrong? Wouldnt you rather your server know that there was a problem and what she could do to work on it, then leaving her to think your just cheap? I VERY MUCH appreciate a table telling me what I may have done wrong while serving them so I'm sure to work on that aspect of my job.<br>  <br>  Where I work, if you had left 5.00, I have to tip a bus person 15% of each tip (or total of all tips) and the bartender, which would personally leave me with only 3.50 off your tip...which is kind of depressing on a bill that totals almost $80.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: She didnt confront her for a bigger tip. She simply wanted to know if there was a problem, since the undertip kind of states 'service could have been better'. I dont understand how a server wanting to know what she can do BETTER next time she serves you is wrong. I've asked a table before if there was a problem, and I wasnt doing it for them to feel bad and fork over money. I wanted to know because its my JOB and I want to make sure I'm doing it properly. Waitresses arent anymroe money hungry then people with a 9-5.<br>  <br>  *Its not the servers job to budget your money. If you dont have the money to eat out, dont. The menu has prices for a reason.|`|AA12393776	I feel your pain.  <grin>  I more and more dislike the notion of tipping.  I don't mind leaving up to $5 on the table. But more than that I get peeved even though it can be in some circumstances (like yours)  "correct" to leave much more.<br>  <br>  That said:<br>  I try to leave a 15% CASH tip.  They then can do what they like with it.  A credit card tip has problems for the waiter: it isn't cash, it has a credit card fee, the house often takes some and shares it with the cooks and managers.<br>  <br>  Other things:<br>  1) If you got a sticker shock - that the bill was much higher than anticipated -which has happened to me  then I stiff the waiter as it should be.  This is a form of bad service.<br>  <br>  - For example, I expected a bill of $30 for sushi, and instead it was a bill of  $65 per person. then I will  give a lousy tip and never go back.  We got talked into a nicer meal without checking the price.<br>  <br>  2) If you had really bad service or bad food then don't pay. always pay something to show you did not forget. perhaps even see the manager.  Again, with that kind of fallout, you cannot really go back either.<br>  <br>  3) Many waiters and waitresses expect 18% now.  This is due to expectation and the fact that their base pay has not increased in years and years.  Many are still at about $3/hr to $5/hr base pay.<br>  <br>  Only a few years ago the tip  was 10% to 15% pre tax.  Many books today say 15%.  But asking around , talking to wait staff, reading the internet .. more and more it is 18%.|`|ljFBfguRaa	If you can't afford to leave at least 20% of the bill for a tip, then DO NOT go out to eat! You can afford to spend almost $80 on a dinner, but can't even leave a decent tip! You should have left AT LEAST $14, servers make their money from their tips! RAWR|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	A tip is a reflection of how you feel about the food and most of all the service. the average tip is 15% - 18%. You are not required to leave one. it is a pleasure.|`|9e11df00019ad57ae83fd8ebfdfbc709aa	The tip is completely up to you.............some people give 20% no matter what.  I only tip if I feel like it....and sometimes I give a small tip because I don't have the extra cash.<br>  <br>  The waitress should never ever have confronted you=------if that happened in my restaurant that is grounds for a write up and possible termination.|`|AA11780840	You should me ashamed of yourself. Yes you were wrong.<br>  15% would be $11.77 which is for average service.<br>  Go back and give her 7.00 more dollars or more!  $15.70 20% $14.13 18%<br>  Put yourself in her shoes .. How would you feel?<br>  Frugal much? <br>  I would have asked too! I would want to know what I did wrong to change it!<br>  <br>  Go back and make it right !|`|qVgr5OBeaa	Um, you don't have to get her a tip at all. She should have said thank you. Tips are a gift to someone who waits your table and you felt like giving them a tip to say thank you. That was very rude of her to say that.|`|KBzDedgvaa	You are no obligation to tip, but that was certainly rude and you looked really cheap. If you go to that restaurant again, you probably won't get good service. You get what you give!|`|XuK91PwKaa	YES! You were wrong! It's just embarrassing that you only left $5.00. I don't think you should go back there because they will remember you. Please leave at least 15%|`|UOmH9vaPaa	For a tip I always double the tax. It's more wrong for the waitress to ask you that though.|`|MJvL013yaa	That was awful. You should be ashamed of yourself.|`|JpG4zaA9aa	Yes you were wrong for leaving such a lousy tip.<br>  Tipping correctly is apart of good Karma - it will come back to you.<br>  Just like helping the poor and needy.  Waitresses and waiters depend on customers to tip them because of the meager hourly wages and I'm sure you did not sit and eat $78.50 worth of food and drink in 10 minutes or less!<br>  <br>  Generally, you should tip 15% of your total bill and if you have a large party the standard is more.  <br>  <br>  Check your cell phone - you may have a tip calculator program.<br>  <br>  And keep in mind to tip your hairdresser, nail tech, newspaper delivery, mechanic, mover, most service people deserve a tip.|`|AA11070360	that was rude of you. 15% is standard. say 100 bill 15 tip. 18 for good service 20% for great. if a waiter gives you bad service, still tip 10% and inform the manager. most waiters tip out all the help they get usually aboyt 5% of their sales so on that 78.50 he waiter gave away to other employees helping him 4.71 that means they only made .30 cents from you. you actually cost them money than makin it|`|bf207d5d9c1ed8820baae4723fb0dd38aa	i would not go back there...|`|AA10842045	That is not even 10% let alone 15.

It's a tapas-style restaurant, so you order a few small plates for everyone to share. It's alot of fun. Last week when I was there they had 2 artists in the foyer, a tarot reader, and flamenco dancers.<br>  <br>  If you like sushi/asian I suggest Ran-Getsu on International Drive. <br>  <br>  Emeril's in Universal City Walk is another good place. Ask for a table in the atrium and you'll be by floor-to ceiling windows watching all the people in City Walk. Never had bad food there.|`|09e7abe08ce00bd3e0c4d7e7472c103daa	I would recommend Bahama Breeze or Cafe Tu Tu Tango.  Both have awesome food and a great atmosphere.  <br>  <br>  Bahama Breeze serves island-style food.  I recommend the Roasted Cuban bread for appetizer and my favorite entree is the Bahamian Steak and Chicken Kebobs.  <br>  <br>  Cafe Tu Tu Tango serves appetizer sized portions, so you normally order about two appetizers a person and share between everyone.  The restaurant has a lot of stuff to look at and usually has some sort of entertainment.  Awesome place to have a birthday party!  Some of my recommendations are the Cuban Grilled Steak Skewers and the Grilled Chicken white pizza.<br>  <br>  Happy Birthday!|`|ZRI6sMlaaa	Christini's Restaurant, it's Italian<br>  7600 Dr. Phillips Boulevard I Orlando, FL 32819 I Phone 407-345-8770<br>  <br>  Many people ae saying that it was over priced and the food was ok but others say that the service was great as well as the food.I hope this helps.

AA12393776	For someone who is new to sushi --<br>  <br>  In the beginning: Stay with the less adventurous rolls, <br>  Look for a good value place. Ask around if you can.<br>  Also, the local Harris Teeter makes surprisingly good Sushi. <br>  <br>  For me a good part of the sushi experience is the other fun things at the Restaurant.<br>  <br>  Miso soup for many  to start  is almost a must.<br>  <br>  Also perhaps order some pot stickers or some tempura (shrimp! but others like onion or vegies (like sweet potato) exist.) and or some Edamomi (Steamed or Boiled Soybeans) and/or some fried tofu!<br>  <br>  Try a small order of saki (rice wine) . heated first, then the cold unfiltered stuff on another visit.  Saki was an acquired tasted for me. I like it now.  Be a little careful - sake is 15% alcohol rice wine. (compare to Port Wine in strength) <br>  <br>  btw:  Shochu is sometimes called saki in Japan but never here. (25% to 45% alcohol)  Giving Saki its reputation. Compare to Whiskey in strength.<br>  <br>  I find the Japanese green teas a bit rough for the newcomer.  If they have Chinese teas like Jasmine green tea or Wu-long (Oolong)  - go for that.  Gives a nice oriental experience most like. <br>  <br>  When you eat it your sushi, once in awhile take about a chopstick end sized ball of the wasabi (the green horseradish sauce)  Start at about the size of 2-4  black pepper corns.  Go easy on it at first. It packs a bite! And is good for you. If you get too much - you will get an extremely sharp burning sensation in your mouth and nose!  But is a nice complement to the Sushi taste.  Some like a bit of soy.  <br>  <br>  It's Considered a bit uncouth to mix the Wasabi with the soy sauce. but many do it. Use a bit of the ginger after a few pieces to clean the pallet and get another fun taste sensation.<br>  <br>  start with the cooked and/or vegetarian <br>  - California rolls and their cousins with cream cheese and cooked fish (like crab or shrimp) <br>  - smoked salmon<br>  - ebi - cooked eel w/ special eel sauce. <br>       sounds scary, but is good.<br>  - tamago - cooked scrambled egg.<br>  - cooked shrimp.<br>  --<br>  move up to <br>  tuna roll with cream cheese<br>  sometimes a spicy roll with tuna and something else.<br>  quail egg - not worth the effort in my opinion, looks nifty.<br>  --<br>  next perhaps some of the sashimi style (raw fish ) on top of the rice. <br>  often tuna, or raw salmon, or white fish.<br>  <br>  Stay away from these for now:<br>  I found any kind of roe (fish eggs) difficult to take.<br>  Uni -Sea urchin|`|zHmZkMStaa	The California Roll.  Not too spicy, not too 'raw', and tasty, too.  Also, go easy on the wasabi.  I always dilute mine with a LOT of soy sauce.|`|QjQak0bNaa	Well personally I hate sushi but I've heard that all the sushi from Niko Niko is really good..|`|4lWd4vFNaa	Blowfish|`|930525fae9ce50d25e62f663d2250380aa	first of all to Aiki, ebi is definitely not eel!!  Eel is unagi in Japanese.<br>  <br>  Try looking for a place runned by Japanese chefs...  the taste is very different than what you will find in other Asian chef prepared sushi.<br>  I will forgive the California roll, as a good starter and try for the first timer, but in actual Japanese sushi, cream cheese, sauces in rolls, deep fried vegetables, fish or meat is never used in sushi.  You really don't find sushi places serving eel either, so look around!  If you are in Hawaii, I would try Sushi Masa in Victoria Ward near the book store.<br>  Some places on the mainland have really shocked me at what they serve!  Another place I would recommend is Tsuki in Chicago, the Japanese chef there was actually happy to serve me, as I spoke Japanese with him, and knew what I was ordering!|`|XuK91PwKaa	When I first tried it, I had all these crazy rolls like crunchy roll and rainbow roll. Ehh.. didn't like it at all!! I do not like fake crab! I think you should just be adventurous and try the sashimi! It's so good without all the crazy stuff! If you do try rolls, get real crab not the imitation type.|`|UuwkPzN6aa	i am the world's pickiest eater... i love the redbirds roll (crabstick, crunchies, and sweet sauce inside, with shrimp on top.) and the fire roll (crab meat, mayo, crunchies on the inside and a tempura shrimp with a spicy sauce on top).    mmmmm mmmmmm|`|XITPweLEaa	The california roll is a great place to start. I really didn't think I'd like sushi. That changed. I've even tried the smoked eel & I liked it.|`|xg63pBz1aa	I always get spicy tuna rolls and spider rolls (deep fried soft shell crab and avocado)|`|hSOYndoxaa	Start out with california rolls then you can start eating the other varieties.|`|iuwLHT2Taa	Try eating these<br>  <br>  Amaebi – Sweet shrimp<br>  <br>  Boston Rolls – Crab, salmon, and scallion<br>  <br>  Egg Salad Rolls – Hard-boiled eggs, mayonnaise, and green onion strips<br>  <br>  Smoked Salmon Rolls – Smoked salmon, cucumber, and cream cheese strips<br>  <br>  Veggie Rolls – Pesto, cucumber, tomato, mushrooms, scrambled egg, scallions<br>  <br>  Ikura – Salmon roe<br>  <br>  Shrimp Rolls – Shrimp and cream cheese strips<br>  <br>  These were my favourites.

Very informative page.<br>  <br>  How come when you eat corn, no matter how much you chew it, you poop it out in whole kernels?<br>  <br>      (Question submitted by Timzx) <br>      Corn poop is one of the greatest mysteries in life. I grew up pondering the same question. This is what I think is happening: <br>      When we chew corn, the outer coating slips off the inner kernel. This outer yellow coating is almost entirely cellulose, and is indigestible. It passes through the gut untouched, and emerges looking like a whole kernel, although it is mostly just the outer skin. The inside of the kernel is starchy and digestible, and that is the part that we succeed in chewing up.|`|mNW07jkBaa	because half of the corn you don't chew and it goes down the back of your throat and your small intestine and large intestine can't break it down|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Maybe it is your digestive system,,|`|0VbAMZccaa	that never happened to me|`|77CjF9tkaa	I have no idea but its weird!|`|5DwIRQOgaa	i dont|`|dUglyCKDaa	it dosent digest it all the way...lol|`|1oKardRKaa	because corn is not easy to digest for the stomach. and your digestive system cant break it down. and for this reason you see it in a whole.|`|xJqg0DFSaa	The "skin" on the corn kernels is made of cellulose which your body can't digest.|`|JeqF35HWaa	Yes....You see corn.

6FhKm9RUaa	In Ann Arbor/Ypsi area I highly recommend Ichiban. So fresh and just tasty. I eat there a lot. Great chirashi and some really great specials on rolls. I love any of the tempura shrimp centered rolls and the tamago is good which always tells you about a sushi place. They are just efficient and consistent and offer good food for a reasonable price, often with half off specials or coupons for money off which means more tasty sushi for me. <br>  <br>  In Detroit Oslo is awesome, especially their eel roll. Not a great place for observing sushi creation which is sad but the food is good. I just prefer more of a show. I love that it was right around the corner from where I was working and I ate there enough to confidently tell you the sushi is consistent and nice. Not cheap but its not too unreasonable either.<br>  <br>  Izakaya Sanpei in Canton is creative to be sure but tends to be more on the spendy side. The bento box deals are a waste, they like to put in the cheap stuff and hike the price. Just order a'la carte and sit where you can watch, you get better sushi that way. The duck hot pot stuff here is a huge portion for sharing which makes it cheap as chips and I highly recommend it. Lots of regs eat it.<br>  <br>  I like the Cherry Blossom in Novi (the one in A2 closed). It is spendy but more worth it as the atmosphere is quite nice indeed. I liked the one in A2 but only came here twice as it is a hike.<br>  <br>  The Nippon Grille in Berkley is both highly rated and an excellent deal. Makes me wish I lived closer. Only been here once but I liked it.<br>  <br>  Musashi in Southfield was Hour magazines best sushi restaurant in Detroit and it is excellent. I went with a friend and we had a lovely time in a great atmosphere.<br>  <br>  Noble Fish in Ferndale is constantly sited as THE place to go for sushi in the area. I have been wanting to give it a whirl.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps no matter what part of the area you are looking at :)|`|BevylvVSaa	I second Izakaya Sampei in Canton.
