d9M6NwIeaa	ano q vem.... os testes estaum em andamento|`|DrYZHC2Baa	Temporada 2009 já contará com eles.|`|SIX6pZyQaa	os testes come?ar?o ainda na metade da temporada 2009..para em 2010 os melhores pneus para competi??o voltarem a dominar o circo da Fórmula 1|`|gjQ5WOuEaa	Só em 2010.|`|n3ggFLkFaa	Tudo depende dos testes que já se iniciaram. Tudo que se falar sobre a volta dos slicks em 2009 ou 2010 é mera especula??o.Nem a FOA nem a FOM, nem a FIA, nem a Bridgestone ( o fabricante ) confirmam nada a respeito.<br>  <br>  Agora, pra ser sincero, já está na hora de carros de formula em geral ter pneus de perfil baixo, assim como todas as outras categorias do automobilismo. O que n?o ocorre, segundo o comentarista Lito Cavalcante por causa do pouco espa?o para gravar o nome do fabricante nos pneus de perfil baixo!<br>  <br>  Bem, voltando à quest?o; Como os pneus s?o monomarcas, quem vai decidir mesmo é o fabricante. N?o podemos esquecer que foi o fabricante que imp?s a regra de substitui??o de pneus (compostos muito mole ,mole , duro e muito duro) justamente para que os pneus continuassem com a visibilidade necessária para divulga??o da marca e para justificar com altos investimentos em desenvolvimento.<br>  Eu particularmente acho que pode n?o vingar a volta do pneu slick, no próximo ano, só porque nele, n?o seria possível diferenciar os compostos com a faixa branca que diferencia os quatros compostos existentes!(ao todo s?o quatro compostos, porém, a cada prova, apenas dois s?o usados. Na escala de 1 a 4, muito mole, mole, duro e muito duro, levando a faixa branca o que for menos duro nessa escala)|`|MGQ7hsTLaa	sei naum

diXiVCfmaa	A turbo trainer is something that you stand your bike on so you can ride your bike in place, like in your house. you place your back tire in it and then it just pedal away. <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/31/Giant_TCX_on_Cycleops_Fluid_2.JPG/300px-Giant_TCX_on_Cycleops_Fluid_2.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en...</a><br>  <br>  And a pyramid is a type of track workout. You usually start with a short distance and work your up then back down. For example people do pyramid workout something like this 300,400,600,800,600,400,300 however you can do it opposite but most work up then go back own.

Haverá muitas quebras de recordes aquáticos no lindo complexo de nata??o olímpico. Agora, Brasileiramente e mineiramente falando, o maior destaque olímpico de nosso país ser?o as mulheres que poder?o conquistar inúmeras medalhas! Confira as candidatas!<br>  Futebol Feminino - Prata ou Bronze<br>  (Alemanha, campe? mundial, e Estados Unidos, tem mais possibilidades que nossa sele??o ganhar o ouro, porém n?o impossível!)<br>  V?lei Feminino - Prata ou Bronze<br>  (Acredito que será um destaque muito grande nosso v?lei nessa olimpíada porém, talvez, chinesas e italianas brigaram pelo título olímpico. Mas há muitas possiblidades!)<br>  V?lei de Praia Feminino - Larissa/ (Juliana - "Contundida", Ana Paula ou Sandra) - Prata ou Bronze<br>  (Com certeza, n?o fosse à contus?o de nossa Juliana, tirando o ouro, quase certo de Walsh e May, que seria o Bi-campeonato olímpico das americanas, essa dupla brigaria por uma prata e um bronze brilhantes. Agora há essa dúvida por causa da contus?o de Juliana. Provavelmente Ana Paula, 35 anos, medalhista indoor em Atlanta 96, atuará bem com Larissa. Somente precisam se entrosar e fazerem bonito!)<br>  Atletismo Feminino - Maurren Maggi - Prata ou Bronze<br>  (Vêm tendo bons resultados! Principalmente saltando acima de 6.90, o que credencia Maurren para uma medalha...essa seria, para mim, a maior medalha feminina, por causa que, os problemas superados por ela, inclusive um dopping sem inten??o, e pela sua supera??o espiritual!)<br>  Atletismo Feminino - Fabiana Murer - Prata ou Bronze<br>  (Uma grande atleta! Precisa, apenas, saltar acima de 4.70 para garantir um pódio! O ouro...vixi! Esse já é da Yelena Izinbaeva!)<br>  Iatismo Feminino - Fernanda / Isabel - Prata ou Bronze<br>  (Elas vêm obtendo bons resultados para o iatismo feminino nos últimos meses. Vale lembrar que, o Brasil, no iatismo feminino, nunca ganhou, pelo menos que eu possa me recordar, uma medalha olímpica. O que já seria um feito histórico!)<br>  Ginástica Feminina - Jade Barbosa - Ouro, Prata ou Bronze <br>  (Grande ginasta. é uma grata revela??o. Obteve, e obtem, bons resultados. No último mundial foi uma realidade com o bronze no individual geral e tem chances no cavalo pra mim, brilhará, com certeza)<br>  Jud? Feminino - Mayra Aguiar - Prata ou Bronze<br>  (uma atleta de grande talento e uma boa menina! Deve fazer bonito embora, no jud?, há favoritos mas há surpresas. Conto com "surpresas" para ver Mayra no pódio, apenas com 16 anos! Séra nossa mais jovem atleta em pódio!)<br>  Taekwondo Feminino - Natália Falavigna - Prata ou Bronze<br>  Assim como no Jud?, o Taekwondo, é um esporte que há favoritos, como em toda modalidade, mas que pode haver surpresas. Em 2004, Natália, passou perto, bem perto, do pódio, ficando em 4° Lugar. Nos últimos mundiais, os resultados foram expressivos. O que credencia Natália em uma medalha ao lado de Zhong Chen, da China, bi-campe? olímpica, 2000 e 2004, e Rosário Espinoza, algoz de Natália no Pan-Rio2007<br>  <br>  Analisando os números, por medalhas, o Brasil traria, no feminino, 9 medalhas, que se tornaria, até ent?o, um marco para o nosso esporte e para desenvolvimento do mesmo!|`|KZ73eK1Faa	O Olimpico!|`|NTZmuDeTaa	acho q a ginástica olímpica merece destaque junto com a nata??o!!!!|`|mp0rtUasaa	Nata??o, Ginástica, Atletismo e Futebol.

So IMO it should not violate the league's substance abuse policy.  <br>  <br>  If a player is caught with simple possession, a misdemeanor, then it should be a slap on the wrist at most.  If we start suspending players for misdemeanors then half the league is gone (and the Bengals never play another game).  <br>  <br>  If it's possession with intent to distribute, that's a felony and a whole different story.  Any player convicted of a felony (notice I said convicted, not indicted) deserves a suspension.  Three felonies and it's a lifetime ban.  |`|IjYiTimiaa	Well, it is illegal and the NFL is trying to protect its image by punishing players who engage in illegal activities.<br>  <br>  A better question would be: Should marijuana be illegal?<br>  <br>  To confuse the matter, it is legal in some states for medical reasons if prescribed by a doctor, and has been reduced to a civil offense that requires a fine such so it is on equal grounds with speeding in other states. Certainly no player gains a competitive edge by using this substance, but the league has a right to enforce its own rules.|`|CWigjWdqaa	I'm pro suspending. Marijuana is unfiltered, so all the effects of cigaette smoking is tenfold with maijiana. Also because of it's pain reliveing effects people can inhale deeper that expands the lungs more making carcinogens coat more area. Lastly, the pain relief aspect also affects ones coordination so injury is more likely. Many people who use drugs do not have private insurance and this drives up cost of health care for those who do. If these reasons are not what you want to hear, than at the very least, it is illegal and learning facilities should promote respect for our laws.|`|OG4WF1PJaa	If your contract says your suspended for wearing blue socks, well, guess what happens when you wear blue socks! Drugs ruined the chances of Brent Moss to even get a start in the league.  There have been hundreds of others.   It's in the basic contract. My feeling is,<br>  since the league has  approved medications, the presence of any banned medication should start with a year's suspension, second time banned from the league forever, and turned over to  the police and the DEA. This society has tolerated drug scum for way too long already, and in places of prominence, they need to be destroyed immediately and forever.|`|uDrsL3z8aa	No, it's a plant in the dirt just like a flower. Flowers aren't illegal and I'm sure you can get high off a certain time so why should marijuana be illegal? The government makes so money off arresting people for it that they'll never legalize it even after realizing how little harm it does.|`|7Iq0FsKZaa	The last time I checked marijuana is still illegal.  And I know if I was caught do illegal drugs (not that I do any) by my employer I'm sure I would face some form of punishment and may even lose my job.  Heck if they want to do it, I'm fine with it, just don't get caught.  So no the league should not just look the other way.  |`|cLy7FhiCaa	yeah they should be suspended..the drugs illegal no matter what. it violates there contract and when they sign that contract there liable to it 24/7 till it ends.<br>  <br>  in my view alcohol has worse effects then weed. alcohol is also more dangerous to lives..but simple thing is laws are laws|`|FfBKb142aa	Yes they should be suspended. It is illegal to smoke weed and many young people look up to this players and try to act like these players. They should get fined, suspended and if it happens more than once kicked out of the league.|`|9658d7060b703339bbfe4a795b46b04daa	I think it should be a coach's decision, not the league's. I think smoking weed is not a big deal. It won' effect the NFL, just the person that is using and possibly his team.|`|rLAOzraUaa	no, it's not like it hurts their performance...oh, Charles Rogers. Still, should someone get suspended from working in an office for smoking marijuana? no.|`|8t5YKBPsaa	Yes, because it might discourage the trendsetters we call football players to not make marijuana part of their thing. And it's for their health and it just looks bad.|`|VzMCbzDAaa	they should be suspended, they can be arrested for it.|`|89RviNLBaa	My High school varsity LB coach, was drafted to the 49ers about 9 months ago, and he got cut for intoxication and possesion|`|JX6inAEMaa	Well seeing that its illegal i think they should get suspended.|`|KozV63xBaa	uhh... shya!|`|UVkP7XzGaa	who cares if its illegal what the players do in their off time is up to them. |`|584cae629b477657da1c483ea507bc58aa	Ehhhh it doesn't affect me, but i'd love to see my friends get pissed about it, so... YES! lol.|`|5u5Mqi51aa	they should be able to smoke in their off time without getting in trouble|`|nRSjUKJZaa	I think whatever they do in there own time is their business and shouldnt be held against them as long as it doesnt effect the way they play.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	yes they should get suspended|`|HimBbU6caa	It's amazing how people still want to ignore the fact that pot is illegal. It's an illegal controlled substance, but I think they should only have to deal with legal punishment and not league punishment. Pro leagues in North America have become increasingly concerned about the "image" of their leagues. Some of this is a result of overreacting to media scrutiny of players, but the majority is to be blamed on the few retards that can't stay out of trouble. It's all about economics. If wealthy people see a threat to the "image" of their product they react accordingly...thus the Conduct Policy.|`|TjttzpPKaa	Sorry, but that analogy is wrong. It does matter what they do off the field. They are role models for young kids. It is obvious you smoke pot, therefore you are biased in your opinion of the matter. If they are in pain, then take ibuprofen. But stop making excuses as to why it's alright for them to get high. Who's to say it won't hurt their performance on the field? When they are high, will they exercise like they should? Unlikely. Will they be mentally sharper? Unlikely. Will they get high before a game, sometime or another? Likely. They are being paid a lot of money to play a game, not to be potheads.|`|0lV2C78xaa	Marijuana slows you down, so besides that its illegal, no, not really. Its more of at your own risk issue and it could hurt your team, so I'm undecided :/<br>  <br>  <br>  Ok if it was legal, then no. But its not so yes.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	Personally, I don't give a crap about a little pot. Just make sure that you bring enough for everyone.<br>  <br>  And about being high while playing sports....<br>  <br>  On June 12, 1970, Dock Ellis threw a no-hitter while on LSD, by his own admission|`|Qa8Y0F0Xaa	I think weed should be legal, and alcohol should be illegal. Think about how many lives alcohol takes and how many families get ruined. You don't ever see broken homes from pothead parents, from my personal experience all the potheads that I knew that were married stayed that way, Alcoholics get married an divorced, become violent beat their wives. I've seen it go down. I don't think anyone should care about pot, it's really harmless. Less harmless than cigarettes and alcohol. You don't see potheads getting into cars and killing someone while stoned. We're too lazy to even think about driving. But if a player smokes in his free time he shouldn't be penalized, it's not like he's showing up stoned and losing the game.|`|QidW9DRfaa	I'm Pro-Pot but if i knew my favourite sports star was loaded whilst doing his job, i'd be pissed. <br>  To be a top sports star takes unprecedented dedication and to think they can put their tools of the trade (in this case, their bodies/fitness)in jeopardy would see them get a bollocking from me.<br>  Yes, its a great muscle relaxant and de-stresser, but then again, so is a damn good massage!|`|AA10713393	YEZ!!!<br>  <br>  Great question; if u were running and getting tackled all day u wanna get blowed too.<br>  <br>  <br>  {puff* Go Carolina!!}|`|H1NjIT10aa	Uhm yes it still matters they are roll models for thousands of teens.  |`|lBtMUwsfaa	if legal so yeah the should get suspended|`|7j2nhdviaa	they should get kicked off the team and put into jail.|`|OtuaXuj6aa	ummmmmm noo???????<br>  its a freakin federal offense to smoke weed|`|CjuR8cy3aa	don't be a playa hata homez.....j/k yes they should

M0qoqvJbaa	I recommend boxing.<br>  <br>  And that's a great age to start at, it's almost what I would call ideal.  Personally I think early teens are best, but mid teens almost as good.<br>  <br>  If you were starting as a twenty something adult without any prior knowledge or athletic ability then I wouldn't place high hopes on achieving great heights in the martial art of your choice, but 16 is damned good.|`|OURb1rnTaa	yeah, boxing would be an excellent choice! you will lose weight very quickly and learn how to defend yourself without the silliness of kata's, uniforms, etc. i have studied martial arts off and on for 25 years, but it was boxing that really got me into shape!

TYyINrYiaa	I would make a win worth 3 points, a win in OT worth 2, and a win in the shootout worth 1.  Losses get 0 points.  I've heard this argument a lot and it's frustrating when teams with more wins are bumped out by teams with more OT/shootout losses.  <br>  <br>  I would also make the end glass taller so the puck would leave play and stop action less often.  <br>  <br>  But mostly the first one.|`|u2s1dt5eaa	I would do away with icing and replace it with no-touch icing. A lot of players are hurt chasing down an icing puck down the other end. It happened to ex-Sharks Marco Sturm (now with the Bruins) and he broken his ankle and was out for the rest of the reason that year.|`|Xl8CB3oEaa	player-goalie contact. i think player should get penelized for hitting a goalie even if it's out of his net. for example, look at what happened to ryan miller the other nite. he was making a valuable play and now his ankle is messed up because the other player didnt feel like slowing down.|`|eUbldFuOaa	No points for losing!<br>  It makes no sense to award the losing team, it also makes for reserved play (in a tie game) near the end of the third and in OT.<br>  <br>  stupid, stupid rule!|`|WnQ3fhVhaa	The puck over the glass one.

I don't think a team guilty of icing should be allowed to call a timeout right after the infraction. They do it to give those players a rest, because obviously the line guilty of icing cannot change up. Allowing players to call a timeout defeats the purpose of the punishment for icing, IMO.|`|RJ5Bevmpaa	Ditch the instigator rule. It's making it too easy for cowards to get away with cheap shots and sadly, they actually get rewarded for taking them when someone does respond to it and gets a lengthy penalty. (such as when Sheldon Souray chased down Colby Armstrong for his headhunting on Saku Koivu a few years ago and Pittsburgh got a 9 min powerplay for it, for example)<br>  <br>  Head hunting (not the legit body checks but, those aimed at an opponent's head or any other deliberate attempt to injure as opposed to simply delivering a good hard clean check for the purpose of delivering the check) should also be punished severely but, Colin Campbell is clueless, so this is more a matter of getting someone competent and consistent to do the job than it is of changing the rules any.|`|QGBSOpt7aa	I think the rules are good, the issue is, just like the NFL and NBA, the refs don't call them all equally.  You never know if the game will be ticky tac, or if they will allow cross checks and hooks without calling.  Also seems like some players get calls more than others.|`|fB4RfiCgaa	I'd like them to enforce some of the rules. ie. cross checking, hitting from behind, goalie interference, head shots. Seems to me that they have a lot of good rules in place, but aren't consistent in calling them.|`|DPlJiWyWaa	Maybe icing or hooking.  I guess they are pretty important though in the game.

Esto es una concecuenhia Hollywoodesnse por sus films en donde suponian al KArate como arte marcial superior, fuerte e invencible. Claro esta este ejemplo en la pelicula Karate Kid, o sino cualquier pelicula de Van Damme (creo q se escribe asi, sino perdon).<br>  En lo personal, yo tengo mi propio gigmnasio, y a pesar de tener graduaciones como para ense?ar dos artes marciales, trato de no mezclar dentro del mismo lugar ambas. Como es esto? Deentro de mi gimnasio se ense?an dos cosas por separado: por un lado Taekwondo y por el otro Ninjutsu, pero diferencio bien ambas aartes marciales en la cartelera, para evitar confusiones.<br>  Tambien tengo una clase a mi cargo de defensa personal, pero ahi remarco nuevamente la diferencia, y explico q no es un arte marcial eso, sino un sistema de defensa personal.<br>  Todo esto lo dejo claro en las carteleras, folletos y revistas done tengo mi publicidad.<br>  ADIOS!|`|ab479ed58ae5697e25598eff9264311caa	por ke son unos Frustra-dos! ke no saben ke hacer para ka-gar gente y tienen ke venderse kon un Arte de Verdad! sino no tienen repercusión su payasada y lo peor ke enseguida tiran "chapa" ostentando sus grados "fantasmales"...y te dicen yo soy 3 Dan de ninjitsu, 1 Dan de taekondo, 1 Dan de jui jistsu, 1Dan Sotokan, 5 Dan keyukai...ANDA!!|`|cde69ce736eb308fdb6c14cfa41eb015aa	SIGUES MINTIENDO DICES CREO OSEA NO ESTAS SEGURO PERO LO AFIRMAS <br>  <br>  SIEMPRE DESDE QUE CONOSCO EL LIMA LAMA SIEMPRE SE LE HA DICHO KARATE POLINESIO<br>  <br>  Y TE VOY A DECIR OTRA COSA NUNCA ENCONTRARAS UNA ESCUELA FORMAL QUE DIGA QUE ES KARATE Y QUE DENTRO SE DE OTRA COSA<br>  <br>  OSEA SI ENCUENTRAS UNA DE ESAS ESCUELA ES QUE SON CHAFAS NO LES DAS IMPORTANCIA OSEA NO QUIERAS HACER UN HURACAN EN UN VASO DE AGUAS DICES QUE UN LETRERO DE "KARATE" Y AHORA COMENTAS KARATE LIMA LAMA<br>  <br>  SIEMPRE NUEVAMENTE TE LO DIGO ASI SIEMPRE SE LE HA CONOCIDO AL LIMA LAMA KARATE POLINESIO <br>  <br>  NO SEAS ENVIDIOSO Y MENTIROSO<br>  <br>  NADIE SE CONFUNDE TU ERES EL CONFUNDIDO<br>  <br>  POR ESO EL KARATE ESTA COMO ESTA  PERSONAS COMO TU DISQUE PROFE QUE DENIGRAN EL HERMOSO Y NOBLE ARTE MARCIALL<br>  <br>  NO SABES COMO SE DICE EN JAPONES ?????????????<br>  <br>  O DE DONDE ES TU ARTE QUE SEGUN PRACTICAS NI SIQUIERA AQUI SE LES DICE ASI A LOS MASTER, PROFESOR O MAESTRO EN ESPA?OL <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  POR QUE SI LO HAS VISTO NO LES DICES NADA TU PERSONALMENTE <br>  <br>  PIENSO EN REALIDAD QUE ESTAS INVENTANDO ESTO <br>  <br>  POR QUE NO MEJOR NOS DICES DONDE VISTE ESO CON DIRECCION Y TODO PARA CREERTE<br>  <br>  NO CREO QUE AHORITA ALGUIEN QUIERA PONERLE KARATE CON TODO RESPETO A SU ESCUELA CUANDO EL TAE KWON DO ES MAS POPULAR <br>  <br>  Y NO POR SER POPULAR QUIERE DECIR QUE SEA LO MEJOR <br>  <br>  YO SIEMPRE RESPETO A TODAS LAS  ARTE MARCIALES Y LO QUE ES DEL CESAR AL CESAR PERO LO QUE NO RESPETO Y TENGO CONSIDERACION ES A PERSONAS MENTIROSAS<br>  <br>  DA PRUEBAS Y TE PODREMOS CREER <br>  <br>  CUALES MUCHAS ESCUELAS EN DONDE???????????|`|xbJzWTg5aa	el problema es q mucha gente cree q todas las artes marciales son karate, y generalizan con esa palabra, entonces hay quienes desgraciadmaente tambien hacen negocio, ense?an dizque a pelear en un dojo patito diciendo q es karate o cosas asi, cuando no lo es, yo tambien creo q es algo negativo y q tambien la gente deberia ir conociendo q no solo es karate sino q hay mucho mas d artes marciales,  supongo q algunos lo haran como negocio, otros x ignorancia... supongo q cada quien tendra sus motivos|`|257070287441810e9047bfef7939f0c7aa	Por lo general la gente le dice "karate" a cualquier arte marcial que ven, lo dicen por ignorancia, o se les hace más corto decir karate k tae kuan do|`|31b74ead8cc364aea30be20ae52ea8aaaa	Nunca había visto algo así.

6f4d5db31da41cb19c3e61b3b0cc8078aa	Pues yo creo que apesar de la salida de Osvaldo, la cual sin querer queriendo pone en duda el arco del Guadalajara para la siguiente temporada, pero de que tenemos un equipo equilibrado y dispuesto a dar la pelea lo tenemos, por que tenemos un equipo que se muere en la raya, y que además tiene muchos jóvenes con hambre de ser y lograr algo, esto además de que tendremos un equipo con mas experiencia, y a un técnico con mas colmillo y cancha recorrida, creo que no sera fácil pero si tenemos como y tenemos con que, pues el equipo estará mas conjuntado. Pero ojala y esto se lo pido a Dios que a nuestro Equipo no le entre la famosisima "CAMPEONITIS", por que si pasa eso ya valió, pero tengo confianza en el equipo ya que varios jugadores quieren salir a el extranjero despues de el siguiente torneo y en el cual finalizaran su contrato con Chivas, y entre ellos estan Bofo, Medina y Bravo, y pues obviamente se la van a andar partiendo y dando todo lo que puedan, para llamar la atencion. Pero tambien habra un gran obstaculo en el que casi no hemos pensado y este se llama La Seleccion Mexicana, pues La Seleccion jugara Copa de Oro y Copa America, y pues ya lo dijo Hugo " La Base Para La Seleccion son Las Chivas", y pues seran llamados jugadores tanto para la Mayor, como a Sub-20 y Sub-17, y por ese lado la veo muy dificil la obtencion a un Bicampeonato, pero tenemos que seguir confiando en el Equipo "Si", mas nunca en Vergara "NO" ya que El es un Vendedor, y ya se imaginaran. Saludos John T y a toda la Gente Chiva y a todos que tengan un maravilloso, saludable, y lleno de lo mejor 2007!!!!!!! Y para los americanistas que les duele y que critican a Las Chivas por que fueron a el repechaje, y que por que esto y lo otro. Ellos lo unico que hicieron fue un ridiculo del tama?o del Azteca, y en los partidos que jugamos contra ellos solo no sirvieron como cascarita. Ahora americanIstas ya que les puse todo en claro diganme: Quien es su Papa? Yo se que ustedes saben solo diganlo, no se hagan los sorditos y respondan aunque les duela, y ya saben que su Papa siempre seran LAS SUPER CHIVAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|54fa73ae6f8e837cc75273db5da2d6ccaa	Miren quien se anda burlando de que chivas duro 9 a?os sin ser campeon,  uno que le va al atlas jaajaa--como 55 a?os o mas sin ser campeones... jejeje<br>  CHIVAS CAMPEON!!!!!!|`|73881b8bebaf4d1844915b6f7cf0741eaa	pues en verdad no creo que puedan repetir, de hecho las chivas entraron de repechaje, sin duda este campeonato sera mas competitivo que el anterior!!!|`|a8642a6b6d5159b54906a12fc6eedfcfaa	Claro!!!, chivas siempre será un equipo competitivo, pero no dudes que en el clausura 2007 estará peleando por el Bicampeonato, aún sin Oswaldo ahi estará en la fiesta Grande!!<br>  <br>  Y para más ardor de los Amierdicanistas, con o sin repechaje, ellos que calificaron directo no lograron nada, mejor dicho...los descalificaron Directo las Chivas!!, jajajajaja.|`|bc7c4d5cd7b135627012afcd8eb62831aa	jajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajaja...<br>  <br>  <br>  jaja ya enserio no la reportare<br>  <br>  este torneo lo ganaron a la buena pero el que viene no se<br>  <br>  IGUAL AMéRICA DARA PELEA!!!<br>  QUIERO CREER PERO NO A LAPUENTE <br>  CHE LA PUENTE PELOI|`|c60147f8c1c57538e789dc7694952258aa	pues si es lo que quieres escuchar entonces si, si quieres mi opinion dudo que se repita el milagro al menos hasta dentro de otro par de a?os...|`|ddc74cb8d35518def539596fcc1d3180aa	jajajajajjajajajajjajaj, como crees ???|`|f8ab5369594964cb27745383c7679694aa	jajajjajaja para nada fue un golpe de surte chiva|`|473d25533b04008e0e78b115994b66c3aa	no se si las chicas sean campeonas otra vez son buenas jugando, y si dicen que el america es una mierda de equipo por que se emocionan cuando le ganan|`|5dfb19d697516b45cbcefec1e71d145daa	pues no creo porque sean quedado cortos de capital economico para comprar este campeonato<br>  y para mas o menos recuperar lo que gastaron por pagar este campeonato vendieron a oswaldo|`|6e8599481b1aea68ae2a2f46bfb58144aa	tal vez---<br>  +2|`|AA11524973	Jajaja bicampeon? jajajaja no me hagas reir si kedaron campeones de suerte jugaron mal medio torneo kizas vuelvan a kedar campeones en 10 a?os jajaja|`|b628ed83a382444bb94f370c15d07818aa	JA JA JA JA JA JA JA-----------NO NO NO NO NO------feliz a?o ja ja ja ja ja|`|9f00d18de1423c5666fce02714201175aa	.<br>  <br>  estaria mal que un equipo dependiera de un solo jugador para ser campeon. es verdad, Oswaldo es grande, pero el solito no gano el campeonato, lo gano el equipo.<br>  <br>  sera dificil equiparar y sustituir su perdida, pero pienso que hay tela de donde cortar en Chivas (michel, Arias, talavera) y no es el fin del mundo, Chepo es un gran tecnico y ha demostrado que tiene la sangre de su tio, 'el inge'... y sacara adelante al equipo.<br>  <br>  tal vez no sea campeon Chivas el proximo torneo o tal vez si, pero yo creo en lo personal que no van a pasar otros 10 a?os antes del 12...<br>  <br>  FELIZ A?O A TODOS.<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|5a22a03d9fe15c2719db0f40040678d5aa	ya veremos como le van con la campeonitis de los equipos mexicanos|`|02a1990ffdbbfdc5a377ded34806bd37aa	JAJAJAJAJAJA no me hagas reir sin el oswaldo no son nada...<br>  <br>  lo van a dejar como coladera<br>  <br>  jajajajajaja muy buen chiste|`|27ff8ae5a40865dcd2ccf98cc5219029aa	NO.

5SZvGxMgaa	you are about the right size for a running back and you are a little short to be a wide-reciever. you could be either positions but i would recommend running back. ladainian tomlinson is about your height and he is really good at running back. if you are really fast then i would recommend running back. the thing everygood wide-reciever needs is good receiving hands. go for running back...or you can practice catching. the thing is that if you decide to be a wide-receiver then any cornerbacks, linebackers or safetys that are bigger then you will totally wreak you and most likely beat you to the ball if you are thrown to. go for running back...remember when carrying to hold the ball close to your body...have fun...football is a great game.|`|113808eeacfbce78bdc96ac9798c2faeaa	God Bless you....<br>  <br>  You have already answered your own question, my friend...Running back is where you need to be.

Quindi la mia (e non solo mia) aspettativa è che dopo un periodo di adattamento dovuto al cambio di squadra, di lingua, di ambiente e di stile di gioco entro pochi anni starà in NBA da protagonista. <br>  <br>  Tra i giovani occhio a Belinelli e soprattutto se migliora la velocità  Gallinari che su tutto il resto è già un mostro a 18 anni.|`|f7f71b8bbd81d57f2623db1287352be8aa	Ki... il Mago??

I played (fut'bol) for quite awhile.  The trick to getting faster is keep running.  Do wind sprints for about 30sec. then take a break and jog for a bit, then repeat.  After about a week check you time, you should improve.  Another way I heard of running faster is to take a rubber band put it around you ankle then pull it to your big toe.  Walk around like that for a couple days, it's supposed to stretch out that muscle enabling your stride to increase.  Thats what I heard people in asia do but ya try w/e way seems fit. later|`|zAXEP20Xaa	you should sprint with some weight attached to your legs and build some muscle out of those exercises. This is going to make  you run faster.|`|DeNstgU6aa	There are many ways you can increase your speed. <br>  <br>  The first thing you should do is to get lots of nutrients. I recommend lots and lots of carbohydrates. Red Meat can help also.<br>  <br>  Another thing to do it to train. Find a parachute type item and put it on you, so when you run, the parachute is making you slower. Run as fast as you can many times with this on you and you will sure to gain speed.|`|UDNmaA5zaa	I have played soccer for 15 years and I was twice named to the all state team in high school, I wasn't always the fastest, nor was I even the fastest on my team, it's about having the stamina and the endurance to out run the opposing players in the last 10-15 minutes of the game, that's what makes a great player great, but if you do want to focus on speed, I suggest putting "weights" on your boddy, epsecially around your ankles, and also doing squats, since that is what makes you "explode" from the start and gives you an advantage on the opposition, hope this helps, and good luck with your football career bud.

GqDq6qNsaa	TE would be a perfect fit, especially with your experience at OL.  I'd imaging you'd spend half the time blocking like the OL and the other half branching out from what you're used to and maybe taking a couple of passes.  Mention it to your coach and see what he says.  Highlight your strengths and work on your catching game so when you get out there to prove yourself for the position you'll have a better chance of staying there.|`|1a73defb7a37bcd4aa05572ea9c5080faa	wide out|`|2lA8oaVXaa	tight end definitely  Your tall and you can catch which are perfect requirements for TE.

Your tall which helps with playing DE and D-line is loads more fun than O-line.|`|36c6c5000e68f4bad93b58530a0ef074aa	Tight end will be perfect cause with the o-line experince means you know how to block.

Good Luck this season|`|cf0d6a1f454c30f4886fae2107dc0df8aa	If you have experience at blocking you should play tight end.  Keep working on your catching and speed but your strength is important also.|`|qRNbY2E8aa	i would say tight end.  but you will need to get faster and stronger in your lower body as well as your upper body|`|yMVxAed8aa	tight end because tight ends are supposed to have good hands no matter their speed, weight is good for this position|`|EMqGAQACaa	Your coach will instruct you as to what position you should play.  Good luck.|`|KXh6YPByaa	OL, or TE, try out DL too.  if you are smart, and have good feet, then maybe LB.  FB too, if you are a good blocker. Heck, maybe you can run some goaline HB too.
2lA8oaVXaa	Being able to catch really well.  Also soft hands means when your able to catch the ball gently instead of macking a huge "smack" nose when you catch it because most of the tiem that you catch it and theres a smacking nose it is goign to pop oit pf your hands.  To get soft hands try before cathcing the ball putting your hands out in front of you and make a diamond shape with your hands.  Catch the nose of the ball in the middle of the diamond and wrap your hands around the ball while bringing it to your body.|`|HHMBiHwJaa	In football, soft hands means you can catch a ball well. Try catching raw eggs for practice.|`|TIV2xBZYaa	well when people say u have soft hands, to me, that means u know where to position ur hands when the ball is thrown to u. there is really no such thing as havin "soft hands" ur like me, u know how to position ur hands to catch the ball. for me it just comes natural, u too obviously. hope i helped l8er g8er|`|nW12iu75aa	Having soft hands means to be able to catch the ball very well.  It is being able to let the football smoothly go into your hands.  To get them you have to practice catching, by throwing around the football alot|`|3HY8Ha67aa	Soft hands makes reference to how a person catches the ball.  <br>  <br>  When a pass hits your hands, does the ball bounce off everytime and fall to the ground(hard hands, or hands like a rock, .....dont think boxing) , or does the ball hit your hands and fall into nice and soft like a face laying into a pillow.<br>  <br>  Thats what it means to have soft hands.  i have never heard of a player developing soft hands you either have the ability to make the grab or you dont.   Its a state of mind, the player makes the adjustment with his hands and and just knows how to position his hands to make different types of catches.  Mostly regardless of the position of the hands you mentally just let the ball hit your hands and then receive the ball into your hands and or body, it sounds simple but alot of players have hard hands.|`|1beec4f442030ffd8ac1b3802ddf447caa	It means you catch everything. It makes sense. If you throw a football at something soft, it doesn't bounce off. Throw it at something hard, and it does. Just practice catching the ball.
azb5oYkQaa	Weights are a "no go" for youth players. Use their body weight: pushups, dips, leg squats, sit ups. Stamina can be done by doing short sprints 50yards, maybe 10 with 30sec rest. You should also incorperate some cardo like a mile once a week. Also one day you can do 20 10 yard sprints out of a stance. You don't want him to do too much long distance work because it will hurt his fast switch muscles. There are many stomach exercises you can do: cruches, sit ups, wipers, leg lifts|`|2lA8oaVXaa	sprinting, pushups, pillar bridges, leg lifts...|`|6pGnfIFcaa	lots of push ups sit ups and run about 5 60's every week day...|`|nW12iu75aa	Do many crunches, pushups, pullups, dips, squats(without weights), wind sprints, long runs, up hill running, get agility ladders and cones and do different things to get their footwork down pact... there are websites that can give alot more info|`|YTZyM0fCaa	It depends what age your kids are. If they are below 13, then usually various stretching, pushups, situps, and running. If they are in their teens, than usually all of the above plus various types of weight lifting. Hope this helps.|`|VrOapNUlaa	really its lots of cardio. for youths theres really no muscle training. Lots of running, jumping jacks, sit ups, up downs, things like that.|`|htG1VsMhaa	One thing my PW coach did to get us conditioned was sprints, lots and lots of sprints. 10 20yd or 30yds at the beginning of practice, and 10 to 20 30's at the end depending on his mood. And inbetween drills, we'd run a half mile. He'd use a cadence to help w/ line discipline too.
AA12170560	I would have to say, in all honesty, Wide receiver or Defensive back is where you should look.<br>  <br>  You might work fine at WR if you have speed - but you'll get buried at Running Back.|`|f252bf5ac4507d1417e332c70e950edbaa	I don't know. Maybe you should ask your coach which would be best for you.<br>  <br>  P.S. I'm gonna be a sophmore too! But I'm 7 inches taller then you.|`|16a8lUikaa	Go with defensive back.  That way you can do all the hitting, instead of getting hit.  I was small in high school and I played linebacker and DB.|`|2lA8oaVXaa	If that racist guy said that to my face i would of ****** his *** up.  and you should problably play WR because your too light for RB.  I know someone whos about 5'4 whos a crazy good WR|`|5e91600f89fd4a8b47e3e76c47026942aa	idk, if you are good and can catch then id say wide reciever. if you are fast enough to get away from the defender you dont have to be tall. you could also be a good running back. you couldnt really be a power back, more like a barry sanders than a jerome bettis. the decision is for you to make. if you really want to play WR then play WR. if you think you would be better at RB then play RB.|`|azb5oYkQaa	whats up, I play in college and what you learn is play what you want. If you like WR then play WR, you'll have a better time playing WR then you would RB if you don't want to play RB. Your only a sophomore... you'll grow, trust me. Best advice I'll give you is get FAST. Doesn't matter how tall you are if your runnin a 4.4, coaches look at speed, strength, and heart|`|9wtJ6gG2aa	If you have more speed then agility then i would go WR if not then RB.  You don't have to be tall necessarily to play WR, While it is a plus if you can gain enough separation from the defense then height is not an issue.

AI did not have a supporting cast in Philly and Wade had one when he won the Finals. AI played on a bruised rib and had a fractured finger and still outscored Wade in the Finals against the Lakers a better defensive team than the Mavericks. AI had the most memorable playoffs in a long time that year taking a scrub team to the Finals. AI is still better than Wade put AI in any other team that has a transition set and he would still be better than Wade. He just does not fit in Detroit and Detroit does not fit with him. AI does not have a Olympic ring cause he was on the same team as egomaniac Stephon Marbury and AI = 4x scoring champ, 50/60 scoring games, 15th all-time in Points, 3rd All-time in PPG, 2nd All-time in PPG, 5th All-time in SPG, and 11th All-time in Steals = Better than Wade.|`|urqGJPwpaa	How about you talk **** when Wade gets an MVP....that isn't a finals MVP.  How about he is just the best over the course of the season, not in 1 series.<br>  <br>  Oh, and not to downtalk Wade but to add another club to your list, he will soon be in the Divorced Club.

b7JS16dyaa	I agree with most of yours, but I would leave MVP where he is. Removing Christian would be good, but leaves ECW without a truly credible face, so I'd have Mr. Kennedy move over to ECW and comepete/win the title for a few months before coming back to Smackdown. <br>  <br>  P.S.

Sorry that wont happen.|`|b7JS16dyaa	It would let Jericho lose without looking bad, but it also makes the legends before Stone Cold legends seem weak, which I don't think WWE would do with the upcoming game coming out. I think having Jericho sneak-attacking/humiliating legends over the next few weeks, then having Steve Austin appear/save someone and challenge Chris to a match is what will happen.<br>  <br>  Of course, Jericho could just get quick dirty wins over the previous legends in the match, or the legends before Austin will be weaker ones. If that happens, I'm all for the idea.|`|TUURiVnraa	its a good idea lol XD

iWcTmuhAaa	I think TNA is really great at this time.<br>  <br>  unlike WWE, they had a great tag team division.<br>  there X-Division has a lot more talent then WWE mid card sections.<br>  every one in TNA, (no matter heel or face) have a good gimmick and a good storyline.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	You seem to talk about TNA alot, considering you're hating on it. <br>  <br>  Your questions feel like an F rate.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	The last PPV was crap i wont deny that but most of the time TNA does great PPV's, Destination X is already shaping up to be an amazing card, I have no idea why they are doing better now then they have been i have more problems with TNA than the WWE at the moment. Jericho dagr8 has a point they do those things better but it doesn't make the show better. I was a WCW fan (shocking right?) and i saw the company slowly die with booking a lot like what TNA is doing now. Maybe an increase in the ratings is because people say TNA is an Attitude Era rip off as a insult and they see that as a good thing so they have started watching. I don't really know why but i'm still going to watch for when they get right and pray they see the error of there ways soon!|`|0BhcnLVbaa	I think this is not the worst TNA has given us: Remember that horrible Rat On A Pole match? The X-Division is getting more time than last year. Kurt Angle continues to impress us by delivering good match after good match. However, the booking committee is too focused on the main event players and alienating the midcard, where most of the talent really is. Releasing Petey Williams and Sonjay Dutt is not the end of the world, it just shows you how undermined the TNA midcard is.|`|b7JS16dyaa	I'm wondering this too. I loved TNA when they focused on the great action, but now, they're focusing on entertainment. I guess the masses enjoy the Main Event Mafia or something. I stopped watching every week now because they're boring me, which was something I didn't think would happen with something called Total Nonstop Action. With that name, they sure pause a lot for pointless segments/promos. I still find Beer Money great though.
NR5LhOpPaa	These "second grade" frames are technically not copies, so it's not really a fake.  It's a real copy that just didn't quite meet the specifications for the actual racquet.  It's far enough off spec that they can't sell it as the real thing, but it'll still function fine as a racquet.  <br>  <br>  That said, I wouldn't buy it, unless I got something in writing stating that if I don't like it, I can bring it back for a full refund.

EvhyVrBuaa	make sure you well hydrated (carry a water bottle belt) and i find chewing gum helps.  Sometimes i spit, but being hydrated before and during my runs really helps.|`|D0ShtJJJaa	Spitting I guess?|`|82JPSNwpaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Have you been running for a while, e.g. regularly for at last a 2 months, and/or you a sufferer of any respiratory disorder/illness, e.g. asthma or a smoker.<br>  <br>  If yes to one or more then it is likely that your respiratory system is getting adjusted to exercise and its benefits which is allowing it to become more efficient and at the moment produce more mucus.<br>  <br>  If none of this was relevant you may just have overactive glands and the best way to deal with it would be to either spit it out or swallow it.
82JPSNwpaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  The pain may be attributed to either ligament or tendon damage. If it is hurting more when you flex your knee, e.g. when you bring your leg up behind you, it could be a tendon problem. <br>  <br>  As for the cause of it, you may have damage something a while ago and it never healed correctly. Or it may be caused by an incorrect running technique.<br>  <br>  As for a solution, you say it goes away after a while. Have you been warming up correctly, e.g. relevant warm up exercises and appropriate stretches. Next time you go running or perform exercise which you know would cause you this pain spend a bit longer warming up and see if things are any different. Also remember to cool down as well.|`|zW530mElaa	you may have a ligament or tendon damage my advise WARM-UP before doing anything but if the pain continues ill go and c ure Doctor

tzrLDbHWaa	Overall, you make some good points.  Some disagreements.<br>  <br>  Ichiro - I cant say he's overrated.  He still hit .310 with 43 SBs and only being caught 4 times.  Juan Pierre?  Hasn't hit .300 since 04.  I mean, what more can you want than .300 avg with speed and a gold glove.<br>  <br>  Manny - I agree he's underrated, but no team has signed him because in 4-5 years he'll be average at best, and not worth $25 mil a year.  I mean, he wants a long term deal and he's just too old to command that.  Thats why no one has signed him yet.  <br>  <br>  Albert Pujols - He is the best hitter, but I don't see him as underrated.  I mean, I've never heard one person knock Albert in any way or even suggest he isn't great. You can't be underrated if everyone thinks you're amazing.<br>  <br>  Adam Dunn - He's a pure power hitter, but I can't even imagine calling someone with a .236 average underrated, I don't care how many HRs he hits.  Comparing him to Howard?  15 points in avg and 8 HRs and 46 RBI is enough of a difference.  Howard at least has some upside.  He's only 2 years removed from a .313 season with 58 HRs, Dunn peaked at .266.  Theres a chance Howard can regain form, Dunn can not.|`|V430UrvFaa	You are way off base with all of these conclusions, you may want to think about this.|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	adam dunn and howard are terrible...yes they hit homeruns and rbi..but there averages are horrific and and they strikeout a shitload..so basically they dont do a whole lot..pujols is superman..|`|9d5001a56ba031ba48358cae82b85660aa	WOW! I don't think that these are accurate at all.  Can I have some of what your smoking!!!|`|DnFoaKPqaa	I agree with some of your choices, but would disagree with others. If you honestly think first base is the easiest position, then you are completely wrong in that aspect. Have you seen some of the plays Teixeria and Puljols have made compared to others such as Adam LaRoche, Giambi, or a Mike Jacobs? Not only do you have to cover your own grounders, but you also have to make plays on bad throws quite often (watch a Cubs or Angels game to see that to the extreme.)<br>  <br>  Teixeira did play at a hitters friendly ballpark in Texas, but then he played for the Braves and Angels, which ballparks are rated 18 and 20 respectively for hitter friendly. His homeruns declined from 2005 and 2006, but over 30 is great by any standards, especially for a switch-hitter. Teixeria also is much better than Giambi in almost every aspect of the game and who knows what he will be capable of batting in front of Alex Rodriguez.<br>  <br>  Josh Hamilton, you are right since he played in 2 hitter friendly ballparks to start his career. Most people get too caught up into the entire story to really look at his numbers.<br>  <br>  Morneau in my eyes is extremely underrated. His power numbers have been down since his MVP season, but his BB/SO ratio has increased which is much more important for a power hitter. Playing in the top 10 hardest ballparks does not help things much, and so does the lack of power players around him. I personally see Morneau increasing his homerun total this season regardless, while also raising his avg and bb/so ratio.<br>  <br>  I personally do not see how you can consider Fielder a one year wonder whenever he still put up good numbers after a terrible start to a season. He is still only 25 and is rated just where he should be in the National League.<br>  <br>  Ichiro is still a great player, but definitely not quite as good as he use to be. Pierre can barely hit a homerun, whereas Ichiro averages over 5 a season and can still steal over 40 bases (he is 37 afterall). 2011 will probably be his last really good season though, which is a shame (Japanese players should be able to come over earlier!!)<br>  <br>  Manny Ramirez is easily the most overrated player in all of baseball. Sure he puts up numbers, but baseball is in fact a team sport. Would the Dodgers of made playoffs if Ethier didn't also start hitting? I don't think so. Manny is past his prime and his numbers will not be anywhere near last years.<br>  <br>  Adrian Gonzalez is one of my favorite players in all of baseball, but just know that he only hit 14 of his homeruns last season at home. However, in all fairness that is great. He is definitely underrated.<br>  <br>  You cannot honestly say that Puljols is underrated? He is the top 3 person in baseball and EVERYONE says that. The only reason why Alex Rodriguez is ahead of him is because of history and the yankees lineup.<br>  <br>  Adam Dunn is just about as good as Howard, but we are in a recession, and the Phillies had to sign him. He is going to a spacious ballpark though, so expect his homeruns to decrease (Great American ball park is the number 2 hitters ball park after all)<br>  <br>  Now for my overrated and underrated:<br>  <br>  Overrated:<br>  Felix Hernandez - This guy only had one really good season (14-7 with a 3.92 era) and it was not that great. He is a lifetime 3.80 era, and maybe he loses a lot because the Mariners do not score runs, but has anyone ever watched Jake Peavy?<br>  <br>  Orlando Cabrera - Sure he has a good batting average, but that is all he has left anymore. Can barely hit 10 home runs and his speed is all but gone.<br>  <br>  Dan Haren - His average ERA after the all star break is like 4.5, that does not help anyone make playoffs.<br>  <br>  Derek Jeter - He is declining more than Ichiro.<br>  <br>  Ben Sheets - He is truly not that great...<br>  <br>  Kevin Youkilis - Last year will never happen again.<br>  <br>  Carlos Pena - He even has a lower batting average than Howard while hitting less home runs and getting less RBIs.<br>  <br>  Most Underrated:<br>  <br>  James Loney - Imagine him as a young Derrek Lee, and he would be much, much better away from Dodger Stadium (worst hitter friendly park)<br>  <br>  Nick Markakis - This guy is going to be huge and has been extremely consistent since his rookie year.<br>  <br>  Nate McLouth - This guy is a five tool player and still is not getting much recognition. He almost won the MVP of the allstar game and I see great things in the future (he will start out the season batting 3rd with a healthy Freddy Sanchez in front of him).<br>  <br>  Ryan Doumit - You say Soto, McCann, Martin, I say Ryan Doumit. Give this guy a season where he can stay 100% healthy, and I will give you a Silver Slugger award. Not to mention he has McLouth batting in front of him.<br>  <br>  Ted Lilly - 32-17 since coming to the Cubs with 411.7 innings and 358 strikeouts. Do not forget that this is the number 4 pitcher in the rotation.<br>  <br>  Carlos Lee - I will take him in front of any other outfielder any day of the week. He had 28 home runs and 100 RBIs last season while missing 47 games. Just imagine what could have been...|`|nSSKixvCaa	You are induce some spam answers girl.

You're stating you opinion and like ESPN you're basing it as fact. I will now enlighten you with some facts.<br>  Ryan Howard vs Adam Dunn<br>  Howard's career. '04-'08. 572 GP, 2071 AB, 360 RUNS, 578 HITS, 99 2B, 7 3B, 177 HR, 499 RBI, 1222 TB, 331 BB, 692 SO, .380 OB%, .590 SLG, .970 OPS, .279 BA, 50 E, .990 FLD%, 1 MVP, 1 ROY & I WORLD SERIES RING. <br>  Dunn's career. '01-'08. 1131 GP, 3871 AB, 699 RUNS, 955 HITS, 201 2B, 8 3B, 278 HR, 672 RBI, 2006 TB, 797 BB, 1256 SO, .381 OB%, .518 SLG, .899 OPS, .247 AVG, 75 E, .974 FLD%.No awards, never even made the playoffs.<br>  Heavy edge goes to Howard. Dunn's played 4 more full seasons than Howard, has just 101 more HRs just 173 more RBI's and 1 more triple. Dunn is worse in the field playing the same position, he strikes out just as much as Howard and walks just as much. Here's the great seperation between the two....Dunn AVG-OB%-SLG-OPS .247, ..381, .518, .899<br>  Howard's .279, .380, .590, .970. Nuff said.<br>  <br>  Teixeira vs Giambi last season:<br>  Texeira played for ATL & LAA. 157 GP, 574 AB, 102 R, 177 H, 41 2B, 0 3B, 33 HR, 121 RBI, 317 TB, 97 BB, 93 SO, .410 OB%, .552 SLG, .308 AVG, .962 OPS, 5 E, .996 FLD%. Gold glove. Both teams parks are "pitchers" parks<br>  <br>  Giambi for NYY. 145 GP, 458 AB, 68 R, 113 H, 19 2B, 1 3B, 32 HR, 96 RBI, 230 TB, 76 BB, 111 SO, .373 OB%, .502 SLG, .247 BA, .875 OPS, 9 E, .990 FLD% all in a hitters park.<br>  So let's see, the Yankees, who I hate, overpaid for Teixeira who will make $22 million over Giambi's $19. When Tex is 9 years younger, is a much better fielder, hitter, on base machine and dare I mention, thus far hasn't been linked to steroids.<br>  <br>  Josh Hamilton did put up some great numbers. He cooled down after the break and you maybe right, he may benefit from a "hitters" park but he is a great story and his "not exactly superstar SLG%, well, his was .530 which was 20th best in the majors and 8th best in AL. Better than Vlad Guerrero, Uggla, Dunn, A. Gonzalez, Fielder, Thome, Giambi and Delgado's. <br>  <br>  Now Justin Morneau.One year wonder huh? Try 3, 3 of the last 3 years. Now he doesnt have a great OB% because he doesnt walk as much as you'd like but his BA the last 3 seasons, .321, .271, .300. His HR totals, 34,31, 23 now the most impressive numbers, RBI's 130, 111, 129. <br>  A-Fraud, well nobody's stats stack up vs Pujols. He's doing things that only Ted Willams has done. So that's a lil obvious to say.<br>  Ichiro vs Juan Piere 2008. <br>  Ichiro. 162 GP, 686 AB, 103 R, 213 H, 20 2B, 7 3B, 6 HR, 42 RBI, 265 TB, 51 BB, 65 SO, 43 SB, .915 SB%, .361 OB%, .386 SLG, .747 OPS, .310 BA. 8 straight season with 200+ hits, that's every season he's played in! Career BA of .331<br>  Piere 2007 stats because he only played 119 games and they werent good. 162 GP, 668 AB, 96 R, 196 H, 24 2B, 8 3B, 0 HR, 41 RBI, 236 TB, 33 BB, 37 SO, 64 SB, .810 SB%, .331 OB%, .353 SLG, .293 BA. 4 seasons with 200+ hits, .300 career BA. Never hit higher than .327.<br>  There's no comparison.<br>  <br>  Price Fielder:has only played 3 full season in which here are his stats.<br>  GP: 157, 158, 159<br>  AB: 569, 573, 588<br>  R: 82, 109, 86<br>  H: 154, 165, 162<br>  2B: 35, 35, 32<br>  3B: 1, 2, 2<br>  HR: 28, 50, 34<br>  RBI: 81, 119, 102<br>  TB: 275, 354, 298<br>  BB: 59, 90, 84<br>  SO: 125, 121, 134<br>  OB%: .347, .395, ..372<br>  SLG: .483, .618, .507<br>  BA: .271, .288, .276<br>   <br>  Better than your boy Dunn. Now I will admit that he had a huge year in '07 but he's no one year wonder.<br>  <br>  Manny's one of the best if not the best right handed hitter of our time or all time. He's not signed with a team because he is a cancer and he's demanding way too much money for a man who's on the back nine of his career during a recession.<br>  <br>   Adrien Gonzalez is far from Tex and your opinion holds no weight what so ever. Just as I have been showing you all along throughout my answer to your opinions. I must ask you, do you even know the game of baseball? Do you even know the players that you mentions or are you just a blow hard who likes to talk crap, thinking they know a thing or two about the game but actually no NOTHING?
BKg7030Iaa	I'm afraid I agree. Not such a good lineup. You will probably have trouble in power batting and pitching categories. You're strong in speed however.|`|c9PHwfVMaa	What's this, a 20-team league? Your team unfortunately sucks. No offense, but after Albert you don't have any players worth talking about. Most of your players are either old and declining, unproven or inconsistent. You really need to acquire good players, perhaps by trading packages of two of three for one. 5/10|`|d3cda7fb50bb83732c430b816c05a9c4aa	Pujols is your ONLY stud. After that you have a bunch of has beens and never was players. You do not have 1 remotely decent pitcher. I give that team a 2/10|`|Cu5GB2wfaa	I agree with the other posts.  Who was your pick after Pujols?  I can't figure it out.  Definately need better pitching and hitting.  Thats a tough team to work with, trade with, etc..|`|30K1WLruaa	umm......... terrible|`|kiAJGdlbaa	ehh sorry to tell you but it's not too good....after pujols you basically have nothing ...I probably couldn't have done worse even if I tried sorry

Have your fun Giggsy, what goes around comes around. As a Man U fan you should know that. Liverpool's great days will come back, when Fergie retires. Just you wait and see.
569220f4bb3c501027a6a6fe7ba2bb28aa	I don't think our problem is or was Robbie Keane.<br>  We have some great players warming the bench like Babel.<br>  Guys like Crouch should never have been sold.<br>  Our problem is our Manager, not the team and cetainly NOT THE FANS.|`|1WgOj89kaa	Ha ha, very funny, Robbie Keane is NOT  a decent striker, he was a complete waste of money for us and him going will give us a better chance of picking up silverware.|`|Rds4eGIyaa	You're right Robbie Keane is decent and a decent striker isn't good enough for Liverpool.

zU9KQYmHaa	Either you bottom bracket (ball bearings inside the lower shell that cranks spin around) or your pedals need grease and adjustment.  Try spraying some WD-40 or other lube into both areas if you are not familiar with rebuilding bikes.  The rain may have started a little rust in the dry B.B. shell.  Also, as you ride more, things need maintenance in addition to the chain.  Get yourself a book on basic bike mainenance at your local shop or online.  Good luck, and safe riding!|`|CttL3LmBaa	Did you clean it so well you washed off some lubricant?  If you haven't disassembled anything, I would be lubricating your drive train.  Pedals, chain, check the crank if it isn't sealed bearings.<br>  <br>  <br>  -------<br>  EDIT:  No bicycle mechanic would recommend WD-40 as a lubricant.  Use a good chain oil on the chain and the proper grease for pedals.|`|Uacta4VQaa	Try Automatic Transmission fluid on the chain to keep it greased and some lithium grease on the area of the axel and crank arms and a wrench to tighten the nuts on the crank arms.

NJMzhcKhaa	Forget those stupid comments that say the training too intense for you.<br>  <br>  Any type of exercise is good for you. The main important part of the whole experience lies with your commitment and determination.<br>  <br>  The exercise, even the most basic form of it in the stretching exercise for the Jujitsu will be a great exercise for you as it will really help your flexibility and even toning parts of your body.<br>  All the exercises there, be it the jujitsu, punching and kicking will be great physical exercise that will help you get in shape.<br>  Basic of any martial art will also consist of physical exercises.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|gJzEAvNTaa	don't worry about your weight<br>  in grade 8, i was 5'9" skinny as hell but weighed 170 pounds<br>  so people have different bone mass<br>  my advice to you is mma would not be good as a weight loss program<br>  in fact, it helped me build more bone density in my shins, arms, and muscle mass. muscle is heavier than fat. i'm 21 now, i'm 5'11" and i weight 198 and still growing. (i've yet to lift weights & add muscle btw) <br>  <br>  so, if you are interested, theres nothing wrong with doing mma, but just walk before you run. do some walking, jogging, cut down the weight, then do the more dynamic exercises involved in martial arts<br>  <br>  good luck|`|fgbZugDlaa	MMA training would consist typically of the following:<br>  <br>  Muay Thai training<br>  Jiu Jitsu (No Gi) training<br>  Wrestling training<br>  <br>  It is very intense and the training is designed with fighting in mind, so you will not be learning the very technical aspects in MMA training, you will be learning how to use all of the aspects at once so that you can win in an MMA match.<br>  <br>  For example, the differences between No Gi and Gi Jiu Jitsu are so huge they are almost two completely different games altogether.<br>  <br>  Training MMA out of the gate will overwhelm you.  Dedicate yourself to a martial art and THEN train MMA.  <br>  <br>  If you do, you will be a beast and be able to kick most guys' butts.|`|1NVMAxgUaa	ok i would say mma is a way better workout. i remember hot summer days and nights training and i would lose 10 to 15 pounds in water wight a night, but traditional martial arts like tkd karate judo are better for discipline. but its all on you and your willingness to train hard and discipline yourslef. you cant put any discipline in or lose weight unless you really put your all into it|`|tXFj8oSfaa	Of cousre this would be good for you. Don't listen to anybody else I mean now a days they are women doing mma wich only proves that females are also tough enough to do mma. And who knows if you get good in that you could be the next best thing in the mma fighting sport.|`|WF4Z10Paaa	any sort of sport , exercises would be good|`|M0qoqvJbaa	Training MMA by itself will definitely improve on your situation but unless you completely dedicate yourself to your goals inside and outside of the gym you probably won't reach them.<br>  <br>  Just simply showing up to an MMA class and partaking will be fun, and it will start to push you.  But since your goals are weight loss,  increasing your athleticism, and generally feeling better, you need to start with your diet.  You need to cut out the processed foods and pretty much any drinks which aren't water (which you should drink a lot of).<br>  <br>  MMA classes aren't really about fitness, they're usually more about teaching technique.  You'll be able to participate as you are I'm sure, and it should help you see your goals better as well as making your journey there more rewarding, but the keys to fitness lie in the time you spend outside of class.  Being active, scheduling your work outs and sticking to them, most importantly running.<br>  <br>  I really wish you luck here.<br>  <br>  By the way, MMA training won't be overwhelming, no one is going to expect you to train like a pro right away.  You'll be able to take it at your own pace.|`|rU7ZjIHKaa	I wouldn't suggest this as a way to get in shape and feel better. MMA is for those who really have the desire to get in the ring and do all that crazy violent stuff...takes a different kind of person if you ask me.<br>  <br>  I do, however, recommend martial arts as a way to get into real good shape, really quickly. I took a form of eclectic martial arts (a mix of many different styles, before they were calling it MMA) some years back in college. I was lifting weights too, but I remember that the martial arts class helped me get into the best shape of my life as far as overall health goes...strength, flexibility, endurance, etc.<br>  <br>  I have always been a big proponent of weight training to burn fat and lose weight. With me, the weight just melts off when I get into training with weights. You have to have someone show you how to do it properly, and you have to start out slow and be patient. You will see gains (and losses) quicker than you think.|`|niztxto9aa	I'll be honest and say definitely not. I've been in MMA for a long time now and it's some of the most intense training you'll go through. You need to learn the different aspects of the game before you can incorporate them into one thing (i.e. MMA). You also don't need martial arts training to teach you discipline. Well rounded exercise is a good way to start self discipline all on it's own.|`|MDI0a3zkaa	MMA is intense and if you havent taken any martial Arts i wouldnt reccomend it. Maybe taking another Martial arts class or boxing something of the sort.
uEMyWOHnaa	If you think about it, DB is pretty much the only position you can play guys like that and not get killed for it. Put smaller players in the front eight and there goes the defense.
1jPiAkP4aa	You should have no problem mixing and matching tiagra and sora. Go for it.<br>  <br>  A compact crank _is_ a double crank, but a double crank isn't necessarily compact. By double, they mean it has two gears on it (known as chainrings) <br>  <br>  The difference between a compact crankset and a standard double crankset is the size of the chainrings. A standard will usually come with a 53 tooth large chainring and a 39 or 42 tooth small ring, where as the compact has a 50 tooth big ring and a 36 tooth small ring. <br>  <br>  there are a couple reasons for this: <br>  a) Most non-racing riders will never use the combination of the big ring in front and the smaller cogs on the rear wheel. That would be the hardest gear to ride and except for professionals is really only useful for going very fast down hill. By making the large chainring smaller, you make the hardest gear not-so hard, and therefore useful. Also, since you are making the small chainring smaller, it makes the easiest gear even easier. This combination of the small ring in the front and the larger gear in the back is one that many people use. Making that gear easier is generally accepted by non-racers as a good thing.<br>  <br>  B) With the compact crankset, you can use a gear cluster in the back with cogs that are much closer in terms of the number of teeth, and when you have cogs that are very close to each other in terms of size, your shifting is much smoother and crisper. <br>  <br>  The difference between a 50 tooth and a 53 tooth chainring isn't all that great if you put a smaller cog on the back, but since most racers do that anyways the smaller chainring will only slow them down. The smallest small cog in general use has 11 teeth. Most bikes with compact cranks will have the 11 tooth in the rear. The larger cog in the back will vary with the level of the bike and manufacturer<br>  <br>  For non-racers, a compact crankset is a good idea especially those who go on long trips or otherwise ride alot, since the drive train will generally be more reliable and last longer. Racers need the extra teeth on the crankset, and I know of many who ride 54 and 55 tooth chainrings. There are even triathletes who have 56 tooth chainrings on their bikes. <br>  <br>  A 'braze-on' front derailleur bolts onto a little tab that is attached to the downtube of the bike by welding or riveting. The tab is actually called a 'braze on' from the days when steel bike frames were the best available, and this little tab was welded to the frame with a technique known as 'brazing'. You don't generally see this tab except on higher end bikes these days. Alot of carbon fiber frames use a riveted version to avoid having a clamp squashing the carbon fiber tube, as well as for the reason that alot of carbon fiber bikes have specially shaped tubes that a clamp won't fit on anyways.<br>  <br>  The clamp-on version is just that, it has a clamp that attaches the FD to the frame. You'll still see many high-end steel and aluminum frames that require a clamp on style. <br>  <br>  Also, you can buy a clamp to mount a braze on front derailleur to a bike with no braze on.|`|AA10279646	Your 2009 Tiagra shifters are compatible with Sora 2008 if that is what you have. If your cassette (the rear set of gears) have nine gears, they are compatible. You will also have to replace the chain and maybe the front chainrings if the gears are worn. But it may be just as cheap to replace the whole crank. The cables and housing should also be replaced, but the old ones might be able to be used.<br>  <br>  If the cassette has seven or eight gears, they are not compatible. If they are not, then you will have to buy a new chain, rear derailleur, cassette and possibly a new crank (because of uneven wear, the chain might skip). You might be able to use the old cables, but it is better to replace them now anyway.<br>  <br>  As for the crank, a standard double is has a 53 tooth chainring and a 39 tooth chainring. Some people, especially beginners have a hard time riding up hills in the 39 tooth lower gear, the compact crank was created. A compact usually has a 50 tooth chainring and a 34 tooth chainring so that it is easier to climb in and and you don't lose too much top speed capability at the top.<br>  Now for the derailleurs. This only applies to front derailleurs. A clamp-on derailleur has a circular clamp that goes around the seat tube. A braze-on derailleur is screwed onto a small tab sometimes on the seat tube or  on the frame where the seat tube would be to maintain the same position relative to the chainrings.<br>  <br>  Keep it in the big ring.|`|Uacta4VQaa	Hi,<br>  For the First Question go here: <a href="http://bike.shimano.com/publish/content/global_cycle/en/us/index/contact_us.html" rel="nofollow">http://bike.shimano.com/publish/content/...</a> this is the Shimano Site with a section of FAGs.  You can read what is there and post a question.<br>  <br>  For the second question:  A braze on front derailleur is attached be a screw tighted to a threaded nut or threaded hole in/on your frame seat tube.  A "clamp on derailleur" is different in that the derailleur is clamped on with a piece of metal that is part of the derailleur itself and goes around the seat tube.<br>  Here is a picture of a clamp on derailleur on ebay: <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ZEUS-Campagnolo-Rival-Front-Derailleur_W0QQitemZ360132261791QQihZ023QQcategoryZ27950QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/ZEUS-Campagnolo-Riva...</a>|`|bGWcSAGCaa	2009 Tiagra = 9-sp<br>  2008 Sora = 8-sp<br>  <br>  You cannot use the 09 Tiagra shifters in combination with an 8-sp drivetrain.<br>  <br>  If you want to use 9-sp shifters, you'll need to install a 9-sp cassette and chain.  Your present derailleurs and chainrings will work fine, unless they're worn out. Shimano shifters come complete with new cables and cable housing.<br>  <br>  Compact cranks have smaller chainrings than standard (typically 50/34 vs 53/39).  While this lowers the top ratios, it also adds lower gear inches.  Good for climbing and general riding.  Also, compact cranksets have a different (smaller) BCD, so compact chainrings cannot be installed on standard double cranksets (in most cases).<br>  <br>  Braze-on FDs mount to a tab that is integrated into the seat tube.  They are slightly lighter than clamp-on FDs, but they offer less adjustability.  Clamp-ons also come in multiple clamp diameters.|`|CttL3LmBaa	If both have the same number of gears - yes.  All Shimano 9 speed will fit other models of Shimano 9 speed.  Triples will fit triples.  Doubles to doubles.  Etc. <br>  <br>  A double crank is the original 2 chain wheel crank set that had somewhere in the neighborhood of 52/42 or 53/39.  A compact crank set has 50/30 or so.  You get close to the gear ratios with a 10 speed cassette as you had with a 8 to 9 speed triple.<br>  <br>  Clamp on derailleurs do just that -- clamp around the seat post, while braze on bolt to the brazed on thread inserts in the seat post.|`|RQzsmvfiaa	Yes, they are. The key is whether you have an 8 or 9 speed set up. The Tiagra shifters are 9 speed compatible but can be adjusted to work with the 8 speed set up. If anyone says otherwise, they are lying.  Also, the difference between a compact and a standard double crank are the  the size of the cranks and the chain slack. You will need to do some adjusting on the front derailleur as well. As for the braze on versus clamp on derailleur, the are the same. The braze on is for a bike frame that has the built in hole on the seat tube to mount the derailleur while the clamp on is simply the same derailleur with an adapter that "clamps" around the seat tube of the frame. Same  thing- different way of mounting.
35LZcZ4Eaa	Micheal Slater?|`|mZ2Uluioaa	must be Hayden or Michael Slater because only those guys can think that they can flush a big kitbag in 4" hole, shows the intelligence the guys have and also no anger management ~ <br>  <br>  the comment is not regarding race but a type of hominids indviduals more or less from down under~|`|9qHwZOePaa	Yeh it was Slater when he was going through the bad patch. His head was a bit stuffed up at this time, too.|`|kecdkv6jaa	Slatz what were you thinking!! lol|`|M8XmhqIhaa	Sounds like something Michael Slater would do.|`|AA11088802	i dont know
9qHwZOePaa	a couple of great 20/20 and one-day performances for NSW. Although, he shouldn't have been selected, he isn't mentally strong enough. He played one great innings but then the expectations were too high and he couldn't cope with it. he also doesn't have the game to play international cricket. the public didn't help him though, they thought he was the next gilly! but he only did well in melbourne because the south africans field placings and bowling was rubbish. they soon figured him out though.|`|kecdkv6jaa	Because he was a very impressive for NSW in T20 and one dayers.<br>  He blasted 165 of 112 balls for NSW which is a record and he had a few more good innings as well which earnt him a spot in the team<br>  <br>  He won't be picked in the test team, well not any time soon anyway.|`|H6CrxE45aa	As the guy above me said. He got lucky!!|`|rjWRMDYUaa	just because he have got a good luck....|`|AA11088802	good performance in 20 20 games|`|GGuXJJeAaa	because he is from NSW
n13rCdZtaa	I think that Roma will qualify over the 2 legs. Arsenal are struggling just now and they seem to just lack the real quality that is needed to go far in the Champions League. <br>  <br>  On Tuesday, I think the game will end a draw at the Emirates. I think the first leg will be a low scoring match as Arsenal are finding it hard to score, and it will suit Roma to keep the game as tight as possible, so that they can go into the second leg with a real chance of qualifying. <br>  <br>  My Prediction: 1-1|`|ySutQCGVaa	We will win. We show up in the harder games.|`|BA1TOMr9aa	Arsenal are crap, (sorry Arsenal fans) but if you can't beat Sunderland at home what hope do you have of beating AS Roma, i think Roma will easily pass Arsenal.|`|zY3ixLW6aa	arsenal, 2-1
ToxDHYsaaa	I played defence now for 13 years, i believe the best way to be good at tackling is to be hungry and put 100% into the tackle because if you shy away your only get hurt or lose the tackle. Tackling comes natural and is hard to work on by yourself, you need to have a friend just running at you with the ball  over and over again and simply your job is to tackle him.<br>  Key points with tackling - only commit yourself to the tackle if you have someone behind you to cover you.<br>  If you commit yourself be 90  - 100% sure your going to win the tackle.<br>  other times its just good to stand side on and block the ball i.e. when an opponent is trying to cross the ball.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|x2mgUMb6aa	keep your eye on the ball,and get your timing right.<br>  dont worry too much it will come.|`|fCCPezhDaa	Getting the ball is not too important, what matters is you stop the man and make sure he does not get through on goal. This is advice from a centre back by the way. Don't worry about getting hurt either, you may sting for a while but it will die off eventually. Make sure you have precise timing and that you try and clear the ball as soon as you get it.|`|rPfPXLkfaa	Make sure that when you tackle for the ball that you go down early. It will make sure that you get the tackle, the ball, and get away without the foul. Go in with confidence. Make a statement by tackling early in the game to show the others that you are a force to be reckoned with.|`|SKW8awPsaa	u have to pretend something else and do something else at the right timing. it needs some concentration and practice<br>  may god bless you
b7JS16dyaa	I think using the superstars on any brand they want would be better. They're kind of doing that, but mostly with ECW guys (mainly Miz and Morrison). I also feel they should unify all the tag and female titles, because they really don't have as many credible wrestlers in those areas anymore. If they don't save the US title picture soon, they should also unify that with the IC title. <br>  <br>  Unifying too many titles would cause the problem of not enough title feuds, especially with all the main eventers and other talent currently with the company. It worked fine before, but there would be tons of superstars floating around if there weren't enough titles. There's only so many good non-title feuds they could do.|`|ATyoVtehaa	They should have it like this: They should have Raw and Smackdown but don't make superstars exclusive. Then unify The World heavyweight title and the WWE title. Unify the WWE Tag Team titles with the World Tag Team titles. Bring back the crusierweight title and have have the IC and US to share among the lower talents. Unify the Divas and Womens Championship.<br>  <br>  Person below me there is nothing wrong with the US title scene. It great with guys like MVP chavo R-Truth Shelton Benjamin Hurricane Helms much better than the IC|`|1WgOj89kaa	I think thay had to have the brand extension as the superstars could not keep up with doing the two shows in one week, also i think its good because at PPVs, like Survivor Series,  we can still have Brand Battles.|`|kDAmNqt0aa	Well the WWE title is the main one, the longest one around too.|`|zY3ixLW6aa	thats not a question, u just listed a heap of names
b7JS16dyaa	I don't think he can do much in terms of weight these days because his elbows and knees are in bad shape, but he was definitely amazing before, and still good now.
CLLsDlViaa	**** it crack one of them... kick him in the head and use the same excuse orton did... just say u have IED|`|b7JS16dyaa	So they're a bunch of marks. Shove it in their faces that the bad guys are cool too, and for them to quit being self-righteous fans who only love the nice characters. Also, a bunch of guys dissing one girl because of an opinion sucks; tell them to grow up, because Orton is more gifted or just as good as all those guys except HBK and maybe Undertaker.|`|kDAmNqt0aa	Find out who's the toughest and smash him in the groin region hard as possible.|`|PLyhhDFNaa	RKO those bastards to hell|`|VlvektSJaa	Its just THEIR opinions. Don't listen to them. If you like Orton, continue liking him and supporting him. There is nothing that can change your opinion about your favorite wrestler unless you let some dumb boys brain wash you. Overall, just ignore them.|`|KH9bbeCNaa	so basically ppl bully u coz of a wrestling persona you like?<br>  <br>  why dont u do the RKO on them?|`|JV0i77uiaa	Talk to the counselor at your school
C8XEeBSDaa	Mate if you have foxtel then its live at 5am Monday the 2nd of March on foxsports 3,Channel nine will be broacasting at a delayed time.Of 12am Tuesday morning what a joke!!<br>  GO MANLY!!!|`|CZvrFqZ1aa	Yeah, Channel 9 Monday Morn around 5 or 6 am, i'm not sure exactly what time yet, i'll look into it<br>  Actually, just checked our website, it's on fox like Punchy said.|`|Uyz6iZwKaa	Definately will be live on fox sports bright and early in the morning!
zFTSg47waa	The most taught way is closer to you. Moving only from the elbow eliminates extra movement by the upper arm and helps keep things in a straight line since the elbow only hinges in one direction. Many Filipinos though have a ton of arm movement, but they've found out how to deal with it.<br>  <br>  There are different stances that even the pros use. Allison Fisher and Karen Corr use more of a square stance where both their feet point in the same direction. It's more from their snooker background. People brought up on pool usually use a 45 degree stance with their feet pointing slightly away from each other.|`|y5TTkgFYaa	You want perfect mechanics, just copy what Alison does.  She is like a pool robot.  If you have a good stroke, you can get away with the extra arm movement.  Go with what feels more natural to you.  If you practice good consistant mechanics, you will have a better stroke. However, I would stay away from trying to copy a lot of arm movements.|`|kDwB7PjYaa	u do|`|2cVrdMP0aa	thats cool
RLoilwCNaa	First off, just go out there and play. They will find a position for you. You have 3 years of football left and the odds are you will never have the opportunities to play again after that. Go enjoy yourself. Football is a lot like life with the social hurdles, physical demands, good times and tough times. If you really want to play and start think about long snapping. Get online and find out the right way to do it and snapp 100 a day (it doens't take long). Snap into a fence spot or tree if there is nodody that you can snap to. Not many kids can do it because not many practice it. Good luck.|`|ZrMlG8djaa	Hey man, naturally with your ht./wt i would also say RB/CB but reading what you wrote about your skill set and your eagerness to block I would say give fullback a shot. You don't have to be that fast and you get the chance to really blow ppl up...lol. So have at it man and good luck for your upcoming season.|`|4dy4AvW6aa	If you like the line go to center because centers in high school aren't really that big|`|jLM4Yo32aa	fack you man you are a *****|`|BSU9pNUWaa	You should without a doubt play football. I've played my entire life even through college and it's without an experience you can't pass up. As far as position, you should probably try out for the offensive line. It's not about size, its about technique, I've also had a long career of beating people who are larger than me. Being shorter in High School has its advantages. Although the position you try out for is not necessarily where you'll end up. The coaches may move you to another position as they see fit. Either way it should be great fun.|`|CgzgTNPAaa	cornerback sounds like the perfect position.
nAtBuBRhaa	I think he'll wind up, maybe in Tennessee. It's really hard to say, I mean he might not wanna play against a division rival. If not that, then he might wanna play for the Dolphins, just because they seemed hot this year. He might wanna go to the Philadelphia Eagles, because he was born and raised in Philadelphia and since he is aging, he might just wanna play there for a year or two and retire there. I really can't think of anywhere else. He might retire, but he still has some gas left in him. It will be very interesting how this plays out.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	If he doesn't retire he may go to Philly.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Really not sure.  I mean, he doesn't want to take a pay cut which is why they're considering releasing him.  He wasn't very productive last season, and I don't really see any team wanting to give him that kind of money considering his decline and age.  If he does decide to sign somewhere for less, it would almost be a slap in the face to the only team he's ever known, that he would take less elsewhere, but not for Indy.|`|UxooffHZaa	I think he'll be picked up by the Lions, and there he'll be the 2nd Receiver, catching passes from either Matt Cassell or Byron Leftwich.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	He has already stated that he wants to retire.|`|DymLS3Nyaa	i think the Eagles|`|BSU9pNUWaa	Marvin Harrison won't retire. He was a great player and he still has fuel in the tank. I feel confident the Colts will respect Marvin, as he is a well respected player for the Colts organization. Where will he end up?<br>  <br>  If he enter FA the problem is Marvin is going to ask for a lot of money, probably more than he is worth. The plus size is most teams have plenty of cap room and WRs are scarce in this years Free Agency. <br>  <br>  Teams in need of a WR:<br>  <br>  Tennessee Titans<br>  Jacksonville Jaguars<br>  New York Giants<br>  Detriot Lions<br>  St. Louis Rams|`|uAibwdMHaa	for some reason i can see him with the Jets.....all of a sudden that's the team that picks up good players from previous teams.Packer:Farve Chicago:Thomas Jones and they were trying to get Ray Lewis at one point in time.......|`|fyKSTMAfaa	If he decides to continue playing, I could see him finishing his career in his home town of Philadelphia.|`|kXPmr9oDaa	i think eagles cuz he lives in philly and mcnabb really needs a possesion reciever besides kurtis martin and hank basket|`|5a1aa56c6591c1edf54e7a20cf077fc4aa	I wish he would end up with my team thee SE ATTLE SEAHAWKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but i bet he ends up with thee New York football Giants!!!|`|rnH9NnZRaa	He should retire. There is nothing more for him to prove, he had a great career with the colts.|`|HiuNSScLaa	idk but i wish dolphins were intrerested
VTN4Qun9aa	I think Boldin will end up staying in Arizona, and Burress will end up staying with the Giants.  News has leaked out of both camps recently indicating that things are heading in that direction for both players.  I think Burress will be suspended by the NFL for the first four games of next season, and then things will be back to normal for him and the Giants.|`|wxXguyK3aa	I'm a Giants fan, too, and I would love to see him play for them.  We obviously need a WR, and if Burress doesn't come back, we could really use him.|`|0BgzkLdUaa	Arizona.|`|YlBLz9lTaa	he changed his mind and now says hed like to stay in arizona but if that doesnt workout i think hel go to the giants or the eagles

1uLfl0sXaa	No one here is deaf!<br>  More than the experience, it is the attitude that is important. In the past India was too rival friendly. After hitting a boundary the Indian batsmen’d almost apologize to the bowler. The Indian bowlers’d enquire politely  where the opposing batsmen’d like their balls and invariably bowl it there- on the leg or wide off the stump and watch proudly  as they hit a 4 or 6. The fielders’d always accompany the ball to the boundary. Now that has changed, technically the present crop is not better, but attitude wise they are different and the main difference lies in there.<br>  Experience do count, but attitude is more important|`|AA11088802	no i dont think so..|`|HSXxRjysaa	Intersting Question..<br>  and i agree with you , the experience in the domestic side is enough to perform in the National level..players like Badrinath are often Underrated in India,Badri got huge amount of Experience with him and he is need of a chance in the team..frankly speaking, he is  M.Hussey of India,but his career is in chaos only becoz of Politics in Selection committe<br>  <br>  Even Dravid,Sachin,Ganguly came to National team with a limited success in domestic level..it will be better if BCCI takes Strong steps in chosing players..|`|bN6S0FJEaa	Experience counts<br>  Indian selectors are aware of it and they look for talent as well, best example is Yousuf Pathan and Ishant Sharma.

BSU9pNUWaa	Unfortunately the NFL is all about the money now. Both Boldin and Edge want out of Arizona. The problem with refusing to release or trade a player is they can actually refuse to play and enter a hold out. It also adds unwanted drama to the team. Yes Fitz offered to renegotiate his contract but it won't do the trick. <br>  <br>  Boldin wants out, and I have a strong feeling he won't end up in a Cardinals uniform next year.<br>  <br>  Edge wants out too. He is a runner first, and the Cardinals are a passing team first. I also feel he will be out of Arizona next year.<br>  <br>  Warner wants to play, he wants to play for the Cardinals and the Cardinals want him back. It's all about working on the money situation. Warner is too old for another team to sign and re teach their system, he only has a couple years left at best. He will be playing for Arizona next year I garentee it.|`|380ae93bb2e53c346fb3d7d8764249daaa	I dunno whats up with Boldin but Fitzgerald offered to renegotiate his contract to keep Boldin.  As for Edge, he wants to go to a team where he can run the ball more.  I don't blame him.|`|zJC18FtAaa	Bolidn gave them till Tuesday to give him a new contract or he wants out of there|`|mT1WYaKhaa	Yes, Boldin does have two years left on his contract. The problem with him is that if the Cardinals don't pay him, he might become a distraction for the team. His trade value also decrease every time he comes out and says he wants out. Teams are not going to trade a lot for a player that wants to leave a certain team. <br>  <br>  As for Edge, his contract is up. He will be gone pretty soon. He is a free agent, so it will free up about $5 million for the Cards salary cap. <br>  <br>  Other key free agents (yet to resign) are Kurt Warner, Darnell Dockett, J.J. Arrington, and Karlos Dansby. The Cardinals also have the largest amount of free salary to spend out of any other NFL team so stay optimistic.
DLxh9CANaa	I believe you are asking about the sport of Vaulting, which has been correctly described as gymnastics on horseback. Many of the moves done by vaulters involve standing in one position or another, and sometimes, there is more than one person doing this. Vaulters are not like other equestrian athletes- they wear leotards and ballet slippers, NOT breeches or boots, and it's RARE that they wear helmets, because a helmet would obstruct their vision and get in the way of the moves they make. Vaulting horses wear surcingles and a pad on their backs, and bridles with side reins attached to them. They also wear longeing equipment ( e.g, a longe line) and are controlled by someone on the ground. These horses are taught and trained to walk, trot, and canter in a very measured, controlled way, so as to allow the vaulters to perform their movements without risk of a fall. <br>  <br>  Vaulting is a recognized sport by both the FEI and IOC- and the day is rapidly approaching when we will see it in the Olympics, first as a demonstration sport, and then later as a medal sport. It is one of the sports which will be part of the World Equestrian Games in Lexingtion, Kentucky, next year. Currently, the US is ranked about 4th or 5th in the world in the sport- our teams have done very well in recent years. <br>  <br>  Does this answer your question?|`|e297ec36aa9e3904ff06e84dd4fce511aa	not sure.<br>  but know exactly what it's like to ride bare back.|`|u0HivvCWaa	A Full trot, and the the person with the first answer, most horses are genuinely cared for, and they dont stand on the horses "back" as such, they stand in the stirrups.

Whereas, Liverpool are finding the going a little tough just now and their chances of winning the title look very slim after drawing 1-1 with Man City. But in these sort of games, form usually goes out of the window. The liverpool players will probably welcome playing in a different competition other than the Premiership where they're expected to win the majority of the games.<br>  <br>  I also rate Benitez very highly as a manager and he's a genius when it comes to European football. I think Liverpool can come away with at least a draw on Wednesday, so I'll predict 1-1.|`|rp84MPAvaa	i think liverpool, if real madrid it doesnt take care liverpool will win, if real madrid dont win liverpool, anfield is gonna be the boom for madrid, madrid take care and be careful  2-1|`|EYElOumLaa	0-0 Tomorrow night and 1-0 to Liverpool in Anfield.<br>  If Real do oust Liverpool from the Champions League, I would not be surprised to see Real v Barca in what would be the biggest CL final of all time.<br>  I would guess that the final will be Barca v the winner of this game (depending on how the draw goes).|`|zY3ixLW6aa	liverpool, by  1

dJcPxDBUaa	they have just taken a step forward towards cricket and hope more countries embrace cricket like china has done..<br>  <br>  and cricket is a funny game.... u never know another 20 years they might be champs!! <br>  <br>  chinese r trully very flexible!!<br>  dunno about their batting and bowling, but their fielding would be great!imagine Jackie Chan fielding! no ball would go to boundary!<br>  Just Kidding ;)|`|SWxnbKyyaa	That also depends on the fact whether cricket becomes an Olympic sport or not.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that they wont play cricket otherwise but they may not show the same level of seriousness as they would show for an olympic sport<br>  <br>  Cricket as a game takes a great deal of time to attain prominence unlike other games where you can become a super-power within ten years.Field hockey for example, China has started to do extremely well and I wont be surprised if they win a major within a span of 5 -10 years.<br>  <br>  So if I have to say how long, it will take 20-30 years(provided they show sustained interest and commitment), if it becomes an Olympic sport, the process could speed up.Sri Lanka started to play cricket in the 70's and became a World Champion by 96|`|b2qV9K5Gaa	With the talent and resources at their disposal, China can become competitive in about a decade or two. In order to judge how they may perform in a world cup we will have to see them playing some international matches|`|kecdkv6jaa	Well there is no doubt they will produce some good batsmen, most chinese have good hand eye coordination from being brought up playing table tennis but they may struggle in the bowling department.<br>  <br>  But really China playing cricket!!! i just can't picture it!!|`|YcvKwRqiaa	If China started playing cricket, they would win a World Cup within a decade.

I think it'll take time: it is not in their blood unlike the British and the common wealth countries, who have it in their genes. In India, Kerala have produced some fine athletes, but very few cricketers( Sri santh, Tinu Yuhannan)<br>  Add to that the pressure from the coaches: a lot is said about Indian cricketers' effigies being burned when they are not doing well: well.. it'll be the firing squad in China, and you can imagine the batsmen trying to protect their wickets. How'll they ever hit a six. Also, imagine their puny fast bowlers coming against Shewag, Symmonds, McCullum etc.|`|BJNWnzDIaa	If their government is absolutely serious wants to get into cricket only because of India then probably they'll send few centurions to Australia, England and West Indies for training them in it, so probably it may not take more 5yrs or they'll play 2015 and may win 2019.|`|rjWRMDYUaa	great question,i think when india will win a soccer world cup..<br>  not before 40 years|`|fsLMFIpgaa	40 years?

That's way better than the Diva, U.S. title, & SD tag titles.

2pxGPcxaaa	Most of him was muscle. He ate lots of fruits and vegetables. He didn't eat junk-food. He trained extremely hard. He had great hand speed.|`|6p9I889Iaa	How strong was he?  I can't remember him ever doing any feats of strength.|`|tXFj8oSfaa	Because he dedicated his whole life to martial arts. He's one in a billion.
r5AMG8g7aa	Muscle strength is not directly related to muscle size. Body builders are a good example, they have large muscles but power lifters are much stronger.<br>  <br>  As for Bruce Lees weight It varied at different times of his life. It usually was around 140-145 pounds. It was as low as 130 and over 160.|`|gBO908P6aa	He was strong for his size, pound for pound.  Being big doesn't necessarily mean strong all the time.  Individuals, like Lee who trained for explosiveness (high weight, low rep), develop lots of fast twitch fibers in their muscles and are usually stronger than ones with slower twitch fibers.  Strength is measured by the ratio between your weight/muscles and the amount of power you can generate.  Lee had excellent control of his muscles through meticulous training.  In Chinese terminology, Lee trained for "say lik" or "dead strength".      <br>  <br>  A similar analogy would be like a boa constrictor.  A typical boa would be over 60lbs in weight, far less than a grown human, yet it's pure muscle and can prove more than enough to handle if it gets a good wrap around you.  Why?  Because every part of that slender body can generate constrictive power.<br>  <br>  Another analogy would be like the Thai boxers you see.  They are naturally light, some barely tipping 150lbs. yet because of their constant hard training they have bones dense like concrete and muscles as hard as steel.  When they kick you, your ancestors can feel it.  <br>  <br>  That is strength.|`|v1mbL56caa	I was going to answer this one until I read Puggpawas and Jake's answers. The have very well covered it.|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	I thought he was 160 lbs?|`|wwmArsKJaa	You don't have to be heavy to be incredibly strong. He had developed his physique to a point where he was several times stronger than anybody his size. He also knew how to use his bodyweight, in addition to developing his chi, or inner strength, which can make up for a lot.<br>  On the other side of the token, I've known some guys who were 6'3", 250+ lbs, and nowhere near as strong as you'd think they were. It's really just a matter of conditoning yourself. Size, and weight are definitely NOT deciding factors.|`|6qMaZ0N4aa	Inner Strength is far more powerful than physical strength he knew how to use every muscle, movement, twist and body motion so when he hit you his entire body was hitting you at a massive speed.  Weight and strength are not enough, inner strength is stronger.|`|VsiM0udPaa	Most of his weight is the muscles. He's Asian so he's light/small. Lastly it's because of wing chun a chinese martial art which helped him develop the one inch punch.|`|AArJNZf8aa	Strong cultured muscle and bones.|`|HKDrdpNHaa	his height was 5.8 <br>  and weight was aroun 59 kg <br>  enough to be strong bones.|`|4hHmNmDqaa	good technique, lots of martial art.|`|xjHW0boMaa	only 1 kg of steel can break you head,<br>  <br>  He had 59 kg's|`|1e576939d9233965a515d8aaa9992a28aa	Well....  I don't think he would have faired well in a "strong man" competition.  <br>  <br>  But pound for pound, I think his displays of strength were a combination of solid physical training, a good knowledge of leverage, and knowledge on how to coordinate his whole body structure into a movement.  Throw in an incredible sensitivity to the movement of others and timing... and the man was just very impressive. <br>  <br>  But that's just my opinion.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	He isn't strong. He is very dead.

gXHxf2G9aa	I think Vince and the WWE need to re access the current diva situation.  I know they go for looks first and then wrestling ability but I think that's where they're losing out :(<br>  <br>  TNA have the knockouts instead of divas but to be honest i'd feel safer in the ring with a WWE diva than a knockout cause put simply a Knockout would easily kick my ***!!!<br>  <br>  Not saying Diva's a pushover but realistically the TNA Knockouts would beat them around the place.<br>  <br>  WWE is too focused on looks first then wrestling ability.  If they switched those two criteria around I think i'd make for much better viewing and the women's division in WWE might be more interesting.  <br>  <br>  I don't think it's fair that the burden is placed on the shoulders of Beth, Mickie and Melina for RAW all the time and Michelle and Maryse for Smackdown.|`|f0f91b1f61307e94f9c53fd86e2c1295aa	That girl looks like a tranny.<br>  <br>  I don't think he should waste time with the womens division.

They are just there so that adolescent wrestling fans can jerk off to their posters.|`|b7JS16dyaa	I'd rather see her than Kelly/Candice, that's for sure. That picture doesn't do her justice though; I think she looks best with a straight hairstyle. It's sad that talented performers like Natalya, Jillian, Mickie, previously Victoria, and Katie don't get to show their skills because WWE just likes to push the skinny blondes.

PMluTf72aa	in the last 8-9 years, Green Bay's defense has been downright awful.  the 05' and 07' defense's are the only exception.  last year, the defense made some great plays.  it had an amazing secondary, but injuries plagued the team, thus reducing the pass rush, leading to late game collapses on a consistent basis.  under Bob Sanders, that defense would have never been better then "alright."  Sanders ran basically the same play on defense 75% of the time, unless injuries occured, then he tried to blitz.  if you don't change your coverage, the opposing team will know how beat you.  looking at the Packers recent history on their defense, it was a very wise decision to switch to a 3-4.  the only question marks i have on this defense is having a true NT.  lets face it, none of our DT's are good.  if they are good enough to be a NT, they would have dominated as a DT in the standard 4-3 set.  instead, they couldn't even get a push on the linemen.  the other question i have is will Nick Barnett have a good transition to MLB.  he had a very bad year last season before getting injured.  will he be able to adapt the new system?  unfortunately, i don't see Barnett making a smooth transition and we need to draft a NT....desperately!  on a bright note, our other LB's will do just fine in this system considering the depth GB has.  RE Cullen Jenkins is the perfect DE for the 3-4, so i'm excited for that.  some ups and some downs to the change.  so, in the short run, no it's not wise as there will be growing pains, but in the long run, yes, it is very wise.  especially considering nobody else has a 3-4 defense in the NFC North.|`|ejrVotg8aa	YEs, the defense did underachieve last year and kept them from having a winning season. I put some stock in that on injuries. Jenkins was having a pro bowl year before he tore his pec. Barnett is the heart of the D and his loss killed them. I agree though, they didn't generate any pass rush at all. They have a solid secondary but the QB had all day to find a receiver. The pass rush died out at towards the end of the season before when they made the NFC championship. So a change was needed. They'll probably have a few growing pains in switching, but I think Capers is the guy to wake up this defense. They have a lot of talented linebackers so I felt last season getting them on the field was a good move. So yes, I think it will bring some life to the D, and hopefully they'll transition smoothly.|`|AA12170560	the 3-4 is status quo for pro teams.<br>  <br>  I disagree that an effective blitz makes for a better team:<br>  You lose pass coverage to gain an attack to the line and it forces wider seams in the secondary.<br>  <br>  The 3-4 compensates for the speed and power up front and gives the linebackers more time to react.<br>  <br>  I think it's a wise move.|`|UlXBL8tbaa	I really don't think much can help the Packers! I lived in Green Bay for TEN years and personally think they S-U-C-K!<br>  <br>   :)<br>   ;)|`|VTN4Qun9aa	Green Bay's offense was fairly awful last year, especially considering how good they look on paper.  Everyone loves to gush about their secondary, but I think it's incredibly overrated.<br>  <br>  I think that the defense in its new scheme will be an improvement over last year, but not to the degree that Packers fans would like.  Good 3-4 teams all have one thing in common: a great nose tackle.  I don't think the Packers have anyone remotely like that on the roster.  Also, a 3-4 tends to put more pressure on the cornerbacks.  I'm probably alone here, but I don't think the Packers' corners are good enough to deal with any additional workload.<br>  <br>  I do think the defense will be a mild improvement over last year.  I expect the LB corps to be among the best in the NFL.  However, I don't think this defense deserves Super Bowl hype until they get some more of the right personnel.|`|BlgZmV6uaa	The only thing I can say is we will see.Are the players going to easily adapt to the 3-4.I think that is the most important.Last years defense was horrible for them.I think they lost 5 games in the last minutes of a game.Do they have the blitz type players?They also need help in the secondary.Woodson & Harris were both great in their time.Yet age is creeping up on both.|`|380ae93bb2e53c346fb3d7d8764249daaa	THANK YOU!! This whole year I put the blame on the Defense.  I hope everyone else does too and they do not blame AR cause he showed up this year.  The defense however, did not.|`|7y6wj2a9aa	No they shouldn't because if they want to get sacks then they need to have a 4-3 defense. Plus 3-4 defenses suck!|`|UxooffHZaa	It depends. If they can get more talent at the Linebacker position, the 3-4 move will work. I'm of the opinion that neither 4-3 nor 3-4 are inherently better. A team like the Steelers who regularly draft high linebackers succeed at the 3-4 just because most of their talent is at the Linebacker position.|`|e4ekb1amaa	Such is the way of the NFL today.... It's a copycat league, and the best defenses in the NFL for the past decade or so have been 3-4's. Nowadays, most defenses play at least some form of a hybrid.<br>  <br>  The thing is that you need to make a scheme that optimizes the use of your players. Take a look at Green Bay's defense.... if you take a look at their D-line, something should jump out at you - they have like 6 DT's on their roster right now. In 3-4's typically you need bigger linemen who can tie up as much of the O'Line as possible to create lanes for the LB. My assumption is that they think they have 2 or 3 guys who would make good nose tackles, and the rest will bounce out to be larger DE's. Who are those good nose tackles? Beats me, but they must think they have them because they wouldn't risk a move to 3-4 with out them. I would assume Pickett, Jolly, and Cole stay inside (theyre all very big , but I don't know that any of them are really NT.... they're more of disruptive DT's than guys who clog the middle), and the rest become the bigger DE's. I think Harrell will eventually be a good 3-4 DE. <br>  <br>  From what I understand, they also will move Kampman from DE to OLB. I don't know enough about Green Bays defense to say if this is a good idea or not, but I don't think it's a good idea to take your best player and move him, unless you're sure he'll be productive. Kampman is one of the best DE's in the game - he plays the run, and he rushes the passer. I'm not concerned about him rushing from the OLB position, but can he cover and attack the run from an upright position? The coaches seem to think he can. I have my doubts, especially since other than Hawk and Barnett, the LB's from Green bay are somewhat questionable. Poppinga is okay, but Chillar is a liability. Maybe he'll be better in a 3-4. I am not convinced though. I'm assuming one or two other DE's will move to OLB as well for experimentation and added depth, and Hawk will move inside with Barnett. <br>  <br>  I have many doubts about this switch - I think a hybrid D would be much more effective for their personell, but perhaps they have a few free agents or draft prospects targetted to help them make the transition. However, I also have not studied tape of Green Bays D or even watched that many of their games this season, nor do I get to watch them daily in practice, so there's a good chance I'm underestimating them, especially many of the backups that I don't know much about. <br>  <br>  I think they'll take a couple years to transition to a better defense using the 3-4, but in the end it will be the best for them -they're a young team, and should be very competitive a few years down the road. Having a great defense would obviously help them out tremendously.

FruEWOecaa	I have the G40's and I LOVE them, but the only thing is, since they're velcro on the bottom with the disk sliders, if you tilt a weird way, they can scratch the ice.  But, they're really warm and fit pretty true to size.  A lot of people at the club I curl at (including my Dad) have the Balance Plus 200 shoe.  He really likes them, they're warm, shipping is MUCH better than Goldline and the grippers (or as they like to call them anti-sliders) are custom to the shoes, and are more durable.

3MKmare8aa	first of all, i think you mean "double"<br>  <br>  and my guess is that your either not rotating enough or rotating to much. I don't know if ur doing a front or back double twist.. but for fowards set high and just wrap your twist.<br>  <br>  for back double twist, i like doing a layout half, spot the ground, then wrap my last 1 1/2. It's easier to spot the ground and know where you are, but a little harder to twist.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.. good luck|`|7AMOuDMraa	you have to do a bunch on the trampoline, perferably a not very bouncy one, if it is, then take only small bounces before you do your double. you can also have your coach throw in a crash pad under you once you took off for your twist on the trampoline. doing them in the pit also helps.

ydoIYwGTaa	This is a tough question because you have to chose which side of the story you want to believe.<br>  <br>  Fedor's side of the story is that he wants to compete in Sambo tournaments and with Japanese promotions because he likes to fight on their New Year's Eve cards. He doesn't want to be locked down to only UFC events and give away his rights to his name and likeness. He wants a certain amount of money that UFC will not match. Plus, he wants a title shot for his first match. I can understand all of these things.<br>  <br>  The article below is a link to a Sherdog interview with Dana White about his problems with Fedor's management. Even though this isn't the the most popular view, and I will get a ton of thumbs down, I believe Dana's version. Only because I do know that when Zuffa and M-1 Management met they were asking that multiple fighters from Fedor's camp be signed as well. Along with doing co-promotions to keep the M-1 brand going. I have worked with Russian businessmen before and it is very part of the culture to bargain and haggle over contracts and prices... so I could see them trying to do a package deal that the UFC wants no part of.<br>  <br>  I really want Fedor to come to the UFC because the true winners are the fans because we will be in store for some great match-ups.|`|ULw1777caa	UFC binds their fighters to only fight for the UFC.  Fedor likes to have freedom to fight where he wants.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Because all earlier contract that Dana offered to Fedor was very restrictive.<br>  Some of the clauses in it forbid Fedor to compete in any other sport competition. Fedor is a sambo champion and a national hero of that sport, he's not willing to sign such a restrictive contract with UFC and he doesn't feel the need to either.<br>  He did offer a one off contract against Couture back then which Dana didn't want (due to his ego might be).|`|YN93QRdyaa	Well right now he's contracted to Affliction for (I believe) one more fight so that's the first obstacle, assuming Affliciton don't go bankrupt. Second is that M-1 Global basically own Fedor, and UFC aren't happy with that arrangement (and Dana White has claimed that M-1 have basically been impossible to deal with). Dana also claims that as of yet he's not been able to speak to Fedor personally, only negotiate with his management. Remember M-1 run their own fight promotion - albeit a fairly modest one -  and remember they were talking back a year or so of using Fedor as a figurehead to build a UFC-challenging promotion. So you can imagine that M-1 and UFC don't see eye to eye. Also Fedor apparently wants to be allowed compete in Sambo tournaments and generally either he or his management aren't happy with some of the terms in the UFC contract.<br>  <br>  On the UFC site, the fact is that as of yet they don't really need Fedor - most of the casual UFC fan base doesn't know who he is, or if they do aren't sufficiently hardcore to go find out about him. So far he's only appeared on a couple of pay-per-views in the States. However, if he keeps destroying notable fighters and former UFC champs (even the most casual MMA fan has heard of Sylvia and Arlovski) and Affliction keep promoting him it ironically makes him more valuable to the UFC since having such a fighter outside their promotion looks bad for the UFC - and makes him a better investment for the UFC should they eventually sign him.<br>  <br>  The other problem for Fedor is that after Barnett the list of potential decent fights for him is quite short - you've got Overeem (who's negotiating with the UFC now anyway), Werdum or Kharitonov maybe and that's about it, and none of those will make much money for Affliction. So unless he wants to fight once a year (or fight a blown up light heavy, maybe Babalu again or Tito or something) he'll have to think about the UFC. Also he's got to know that fights against Lesnar and Couture would make him a big pot of cash, as well as possible rematches with Nogueira and Cro Cop and whoever else the UFC might throw at him to keep him busy.<br>  <br>  So in summary, I think it's really only a matter of time before the UFC signs Fedor. Fedor has already made noises about it once he sees out his Affliction contract, and with Affliction leaking money I wouldn't be surprised if his management are considering fleeing the sinking ship. On the UFC side, as I said the more notable people Fedor beats in Affliction the more worthwhile an investment he becomes for the UFC, and the more likely Dana White & co. will bite the bullet and do what's needed to sign him.|`|M0qoqvJbaa	Contractual disputes over Fedor being allowed to compete in other venues (such as SAMBO and ADCC) and Fedor's management wishing for co-promotion with their brand M-1 Global.<br>  <br>  They seem to be surviving without each other though it would definitely be nicer if they could see eye to eye.  As it stands, neither side seems willing to budge even an inch.|`|tXFj8oSfaa	Becase Dana is hating on Fedor, affliction would be loosing a lot by letting Fedor go.|`|oeQVK0cmaa	Since the purchase of Pride by the majority owners of UFC and the expiration of Emelianenko's contract with Pride, there has been speculation about the possibility of him fighting in the UFC, especially since a public falling out between Bodog's Calvin Ayre and Emelianenko's manager, Vadim Finklestein.[53] In a June 2007 interview with the Baltimore Sun, Chuck Liddell suggested that Emelianenko was on his way to the UFC.[54] Dana White has also expressed interest in signing Emelianenko, but considers his management team to be the primary barrier left to the inking of a contract,[55] whereas Finklestein has cited difficult negotiations as the reason.[56] A main point of contention between the two is Finkelstein's request for the UFC to work with his Russian M-1 promotion, extending contractual offers to other members of the Red Devil Sport Club, and permitting Emelianenko to compete in combat sambo tournaments.[53] At UFC 76 however, UFC president Dana White stated that he expected Emelianenko to sign with the UFC in late 2007 or early 2008, after Emelianenko was to compete in a Sambo competition that White would not allow him to participate in if he were under a UFC contract. He also revealed his intent to set up a unification bout with UFC heavyweight champion Randy Couture as his first UFC fight.[57] Nevertheless, these negotiations broke down,[58] as Emelianenko committed to a non-exclusive, two-year and six-fight deal with M-1 Global in October 2007.[59]|`|OfG4KYRFaa	Fedor will be talking with Dana in June for a possible match against Brock Lesnar, so it might only be a 1 match contract.

In fact, AI and the Pistons beat the Heat already this year, so the question is why can't Wade carry the Heat? AI>Wade - Also, not AI is in a half court system under Michael Curry a coach who knows squat. Spolestra is the coach in name only. For, if I know Pat Riley and I think I do being he coached the Knicks for a long time. He has a hands on approach and is still probably giving Spolestra orders of how to do things, being the secret door coach. That is just Riley's style.  One of the reasons Stan Van Gundy resigned. AI is in a team that does not advocate his transitional game if he was on a team, like this he will do what he has always done. Look, at him in games he still is as quick and skilled as ever but is complacent and hesitant to shoot. That never was and is AI.|`|m501HwyWaa	20th all time<br>  wheres wade<br>  <br>  i agree just like last yr when shaq left, u guys<br>  still suck with wade scoring 30+ a game this season

If he wasn't banging the bosses daughter then I guarantee he wouldn't have 13 title reigns. Just count how many reigns he's had before he got with Steph. You can count it on 1 hand. Plus he's too big for his boots, he treats the guys and staff like **** and only cares about himself getting over all the time. He's got no give, all take. Greedy as hell and thats why the locker room leader has stepped in a few times to have a word. The Undertaker. He's not a popular guy really, can wrestle but personally I want Orton to win. Why build him up like this then pull the plug at Mania. HHH to greedy but will probably win as he will get his wife to moan to daddy. Very sad HHH. Orton I hope wins, I'll soon know as I'll be there.|`|s4FIoGwmaa	Personally i think he deserves to win, and i also think that Randy Orton deserves to lose, his gimmick is getting a litlle boring and he doesn't entertain me.  hes almost robotic on the mic.

The WWE has celebrities do one-time appearances at Wrestlemania every year.<br>  <br>  Sting vs Undertaker is a dream match for a lot of fans.  Sting knows it, Undertaker knows it, Vince McMahon knows it.<br>  <br>  All it would take is for Vince to offer Sting a "contract" for a one-time Wrestlemania appearance.  They could then hammer out the details.  It wouldn't be difficult to do at all.  And Vince would make a lot of money from Sting appearing at WM.<br>  <br>  Bringing in big-name stars for special appearances is something that was pretty common in previous generations.  Other promotions still do this today.<br>  <br>  It won't happen at this year's WM, but there are a lot of other PPVs it could happen at.  But, Sting is 50 years old; he doesn't have an unlimited amount of time left.  Vince will need to make this match happen pretty quick.<br>  <br>  Perhaps Wrestlemania next year...|`|KIOR56r6aa	WM 26 next year. <br>  <br>  S and Steven G are idiots.|`|tl1HTJRwaa	No chance in hell|`|xfkn4UQuaa	Not me|`|iWcTmuhAaa	for me it would be a dream come true.<br>  <br>  but I doubt we will ever see, cause Sting may never work for Vince McMahon.

apPTFtHdaa	I've had to restore some of my old hakama before, and it can be a little tricky depending on how badly it has lost its shape. As long as the creases in the pleats are still visible then it can be fairly easy to work with. Here are a few steps that generally help:<br>  <br>  1) Start by holding the hakama upright in the air, allowing the material to fall naturally. Then grip the top of the hakama with your left hand. Rotate the hakama so that you can see the back pleats. Using your right hand, run your hand down the inside of the back pleats to make sure the material isn't "wrinkled". When you have finished with that, use your right hand to grip the bottom of the hakama, making sure to hold the back pleats in place, then lie it down so that the front is facing up.<br>  <br>  2) Align the front pleats as you would when you would normally fold the hakama. Again you need to run your hand underneath each pleat to make sure that the cloth isn't bunching. If it is bunching, try to feel how the cloth is cut and try to smooth out the material. Note: some of the folds underneath the inner pleats overlap between the left and right side. <br>  <br>  3) If it still looks off, you can try flipping the hakama over once again and try working from the back pleats. I do this by gently picking up the top of the hakama and slowly "walking" it over. Sometimes, flip it over a few times to make sure everything is in line. <br>  <br>  4) I'll sometime use an iron to press the pleats back down once I have everything lined up one again. Some individuals also use starch, but I haven't had to do this. <br>  <br>  I think just about everyone has had a few times in which they rush through putting their hakama away and have experienced exactly what you are experiencing. Ultimately, this can be a good learning experience, so I recommend taking this opportunity to look more closely at how the hakama is aligned.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	try not to loose any sleep over it. there are far more important thing in life then remembering how to fold a hakama<br>  <br>  but if you must know<br>  <a href="http://www.kendo-usa.org/reference/hakama_fold.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kendo-usa.org/reference/hakam...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVN57Y4awrw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVN57Y4aw...</a>|`|M0qoqvJbaa	This is a clothing related question.

It's perfectly legal unless you were under age or knew the gun to be stolen.<br>  2) Josh, who said it's a felony to have an unregistered gun, has no clue.  Gun registration is not required in the USA except in a couple of very strict municipalities, and only for handguns in those areas.  In fact, what's illegal in most places is for law enforcement agencies to keep info on a gun purchase.<br>  3) If you don't know where to find ammo, you aren't smart enough to have a gun.  For FSM's sake, it can be found at Wal-Mart, Academy, Sport's Authority, any gun shop found easily in the Yellow Pages, online at Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's, or about 5,000 other places.  Get a clue.|`|RmcFMAT0aa	Well, if it is stolen you could be looking at serious jail time. By the way you wrote your question, it seems you may not have much knowledge regarding firearms. Always learn the laws of your state and federal government regarding weapons. easier than jail time.  Also, learn the laws governing self defense in your state. Not all states are alike. <br>   If your weapon is stolen, you will end up in jail if you ever use it. On top of what some sleazy DA may try to pin on you for self defense, you will be looking at gun law violations. <br>   If your gun is legit, go to any sporting good store. Even Wal Mart.

dpSr0icwaa	That is a VERY good scope.<br>  <br>  However, I think it is way more mangificaition than you need.  Also, why did you choose one with an illuminated reticle? Unless you are hunting at dawn and dusk, the crosshairs will appear black in the daylight.  <br>  <br>  I just googled your air rifle, 177 isn't appropriate for small game as big as a rabbit at any distance more than 10 yards, so I am going to assume you are getting the 22 caliber version which generates 930 fps when the gun is new.  Most airguns loose a little velocity as they age, so I expect it to be firing at 900 fps a month from now.<br>  <br>  900 fps with that light, non-areodymanic projectile, and attempting to maintain enough energy to provide enough velocity to get a good clean kill, you are limited to maybe 50 yard shots.  No way do you need such a powerful scope for that application.  Plus, even at 4.5x your field of view is so small you will have a hard time picking up your target.<br>  <br>  That scope is designed for guys who have 223 and 22-250 and 220 swift high velocity rifles to use as a multipurpose scope to serve them for anything from coyotes to fox to long range prarie dog zapping.<br>  <br>  If you want a Leupold Vari X-III, fine, it is a VERY good scope, but choose a better magnificaiton for your desired goal.  I think you'd be very happy with a 1-4x, but if you think that is too small, a 2-7x or similar would be another great choice<br>  <a href="http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/?productNumber=939585" rel="nofollow">http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/?pr...</a><br>  I also think at such a short range you do not need the features the X-III gives, an X-II will be MORE than enough.<br>  <br>  Try this one<br>  <a href="http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/?productNumber=121601" rel="nofollow">http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/?pr...</a>|`|QrjuueMCaa	It's a great scope, but I'm curious, why put that kind of scope on an air rifle?

Almost certainly will be on BBC iPlayer for the week following the race to watch online or on digital TV.  <br>  <br>  I don't think it'll be on any other BBC channel (BBC3/4) as they are specific seperate channels and don't show reruns of stuff that they've just shown on BBC1|`|9dcvN2KFaa	If you go to their website, they have already released the programme schedule for the first few races. All practice sessions will be live on the red button, with the quali and race live on BBC1, and highlight's on BBC3 I think it said. Check it out:<br>  <br>  www.bbc.co.uk|`|hfQnUqnVaa	I should think so becuase i ain't getting up at like 5 in the morning i'll have to tape it, but if Bernie can get the races not in sychronisation with local british time like hes trying we'll ave nothing to worry about|`|pLoCn8dWaa	I would think so, but I always watch it live.<br>  It's just not the same later on :(
d5f3e65ac4895a16eeeeaa09b2857623aa	I dont think it's the string that you need to change. Try extending your arm into the shot. So when you hit the ball, make sure your arm is stretched out. This gives an extra push for a deeper ball. Check out pics of Nadal's and Fed's forehand. Their arms are stretched out.<br>  <br>  If you want a string recommendation anyway, I would recommend you use the Babolat Pro Hurricane Tour @ 54lbs. It seems like it will suit your game..|`|Wjp0niEhaa	I used to have a similar problem with all the topspin I put on my forehands.  Since I switched to Natural Gut on the mains, I've been a lot better at keeping the ball deep.  It also feels great.  I would try Wilson/Babolat Natural Gut on the mains, and your usual favorite on the crosses.  It is a tad expensive, but using it in a hybrid reduces the cost. They last surprisingly long, except when you get them wet. Your other option is to reduce the tension on your usual strings to give your shots a bit more power and depth.  Good luck!|`|YZuUJVnIaa	<a href="http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/StringContent.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/StringCo...</a><br>  <br>  this sites got a heap of info<br>  <br>  and this one seems pretty good for power <br>  <a href="http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/descpageACFORTEN-ALUSTR.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/descpage...</a><br>  hewitt, baghdatis, chakvetadze, ivanovic, dementieva and blake are supposedly using it (scroll down that page)<br>  <br>  and theres is also a review on it, play testers and stuff|`|KetCJOn0aa	<a href="http://givingin.chills.it" rel="nofollow">http://givingin.chills.it</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website
R8QEtRCYaa	AS per my experience the prices varies from websites to websites. There are websites which even sells tickets at prices higher than the original price. And websites like <a href="http://www.letsgettickets.com/mlb-tickets.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.letsgettickets.com/mlb-ticket...</a> has tickets at discounted prices and even additional discounts sometimes so i always make a purchase from them.|`|WeEjc79Uaa	Depends on where you want to sit, Try MLB.com and go to your teams site.|`|6440aca54e76133287a99d198c3d1a37aa	Go to Ticket Master first and see if you can get them for regular price, if not you need to use the secondary market which other people have addressed.  <br>  <br>  Tickets are not yet on sale for the regular season but if you call Ticket Master they will tell you the on sale date, if you're organized and know what game you want to see you'll be able to buy tickets right away on the day they go on sale.  Good luck.|`|uzIhl6wUaa	Half of much if you bought them through the office
VASa5FJoaa	The Lord of Rome..<br>  Symbol of AS Roma<br>  <br>  The magic thing about him, AS Roma can hardly play better the moment they play without Totti.<br>  <br>  His injury prone has to take into a consideration as well, imagine he has severely broken in ankle yet comeback to be the top goalscorer in Seria A and EUROPEAN golden buot winner the next season (even with a steel plate planted in his ankle)....Anybody can do that?????<br>  <br>  Overall..talismatic and influental player ever be in a club in Seria A, skill = very good, use to be excellence, but look at his age.<br>  <br>  Forza Roma<br>  Forza Il Capitano|`|3q8LkLLDaa	i always admired his loyalty in roma but as skills he has been without a doubt the most overrated italian soccer player in history of calcio! <br>  the first guy's answer cover it all!|`|zW530mElaa	a good free kick taker good passer of the ball and shooting but there will be no dangour for the gunners we gunna win man 2-0 at least|`|Fex1ZVRoaa	i really like his play,he is a great player|`|L1QTSErIaa	I think he is extremely overrated. You can't deny his loyalty to his club. But that is about the only great thing about him. He is capable of flashes of brilliance. <br>  He has been known to score important goals. But against lesser teams, he just drifts away. Sometimes, he seems not even present in the game. <br>  That is the reason the fans seem to adore Totti. He is good enough to destroy the big clubs with his brilliant play. But not many clubs wants to sign him though.|`|ISCUKFNlaa	Great player, underrated|`|SG5vRFWjaa	I admire his loyalty to Roma as he could have moved for big money, but thats where my admiration ends.<br>  <br>  I think is one of the most overrated players in europe. He has never performed on the international stage and coming to think of it in Europe. His peak was probably at the turn of the century when Roma had the powerful strike force of Montella and Batistuta, where he played in the whole behind them. I think Roma won the league two years running during that time.<br>  <br>  I have personally been consistantly disappointed when I have seen him play.|`|xegK7yhiaa	He is a fantastic player. Arsenal need to be careful of his Cuchiaio. One of his signiture shots.|`|TxVAXBpTaa	He's the heart and soul of AS Roma|`|AA11193511	Very good answers!<br>  Loyal but not world class like say Zidane, Maldini, Henry etc
UYPfC5YVaa	I think it would be better if you try it yourslf so that you would know the answer to your question.|`|D6Llh23Baa	you might get both. but i'm pretty sure they would ban you for life from that arena.|`|HiuNSScLaa	idk but i was at the miami dolphins and san fran 49ers game this year where the fins won 14 to 9 a kid ran on the feild they stopped the game and security chased him and tackled the **** out of him he got slammed and handcuffed and obviously taken off the field to idk where|`|JgAE7eV9aa	Who knows. but what i do know is that you would be consider a crazy celebrity/ahlete stacker and every one included your favorite stars/ahletes would be on the look out for your ***.|`|CkpzuduCaa	hmm. you might get both.
ejbSFv0caa	Sadly YES!<br>  <br>  Also Plantar Fasciitis and a variety of other shock related injuries.<br>  <br>  Another hidden risk is repeated dehydration - this can cause bowel trouble later too.  <br>  <br>  Basically if you feel thirsty you are already more dehydrated than you should be.|`|DOShS8q0aa	Well David Belle has never complained of any but he isnt that old yet. Probably but that doesnt stop me|`|fKco44yxaa	Unfortunately yes.<br>  <br>  Think of your knees. I mean the pressure on them is huge, and your wrists...all that climbing.<br>  <br>  But it comes down to two things in the end.<br>  <br>  What doesn't harm you in someway in old age?<br>  and<br>  Is it worth it? Do the benefits outweigh the Risks?<br>  <br>  For example i play football, and my mate wants me to take creating (legal)...but I don't want to because it damages your kidneys. The benefits do not outweigh the costs. With parkour they do, and I mean all it is is making your self better at getting around the world.<br>  <br>  In the end everything harms you...writing this will probably come back to haunt me (laptops = radiation apparently). Its just if you care.|`|zLK1iWXbaa	I just found this site on google It has plenty of information about arthritis
