eS4MEASMaa	If you only want to listen to music, and you don't mind how the iPod itself looks, get iPod Classic.<br>  <br>  If you want more functions (internet, games, applications, videos, music, etc) then get iPod Touch.<br>  I have an iPod Touch, and I have to say it was worth the money.|`|1N60ixK8aa	I hear Touch develops more problems then the Classic. I'd go with Classic if I were you.|`|NDoyhCZYaa	iTouch is far better. But then again the iTouch does get really boring after a while.|`|ak0T96CQaa	iTouch: if you want to enjoy apps, email, safari<br>  <br>  iPod Classic: if you have enough music to warrant getting one.
mLbb8YJgaa	Limewire, the program itself, is legal. However, when you download music from it, it is illegal.|`|HypqcnJaaa	Yepp<br>  I-Tunes.|`|su37vnIXaa	not really & thers like 80% chance of getting bad viruses! so it could end up costing you to get you computer fixed!|`|v5XYluuFaa	You can't get music for free legally. Lime wire is illegal, so is Ares, and all the other downloaders. ITunes is legal.|`|NDoyhCZYaa	Limewire is a company. Limewire isn't illegal, downloading stuff from it is.|`|h5cPbPj5aa	Yes its illegal google free music downloads|`|WhlwZeiXaa	not only is it legal! but 4 out of 5 dentists recommend it!|`|nMirIqVaaa	Okay.. How would you feel if you worked really hard on a song and wanted to sell singles of it. You spend lots of money on making this song and then when you are finally selling the single.. you see that you're not getting any income. Turns out that people are downloading your song for free without paying anything at all. Your hard work is being stolen..|`|VArX90LKaa	yes it is very perfectly legal i even have it.although if you invade the laws of the agreement it is illegal but it is used by millions.so go to lime wire.com and you can find a free download or you  can upgrade to pro.|`|JFWqHF6Caa	Your getting music and videos for free, its ILLEGAL. There is no legal file sharing program like it, if you want songs for free you have to break the law. Be careful|`|vAzNpW71aa	If you download/share copyrighted stuff then it's illegal|`|oYgdj4hwaa	just make sure you dont get a virus , be sure to have adequate security , saying that i use it all the time<br>  who cares ?|`|lb6VI8XRaa	Yes, it is illegal. Just use iTunes. They have a free single every week.|`|QCdpBqhHaa	Yes but everyone uses it|`|rnW8h3vCaa	yuppers.<br>  i used to have it.<br>  get off it|`|qkS6pI4Naa	It depends on where you live, if you're in the United States it obviously is (assuming you download music using it) and beware if you download a music file, the government can implement a tracker to where as soon as you open the file it sends your IP address to the government (Which is definately trackable) then comes a huge bill in your mail.|`|wW6TYFdYaa	LimeWire Basic is illegal based on the premises of you sharing what you download or save to your computer with other people. There are currently no "legal" P2P (peer-to-peer) programs available. However, LimeWire is currently holding a deal that you can install their program for $24.95 a year (very cheap by most standards) with unlimited downloads and no legal risks. Other than that you might try to search google for a sight called mymp3. It does not have even close to the database that a program like LimeWire would have, but it is a free downloading site.|`|bbR79Js0aa	The question asks, is it illegal to use limewire. Using limewire technically is not illegal, but downloading content for which you may not be authorized to download, is. What such authorization means has and will continue to be the focus of court battles involving various trade groups, most notably the RIAA. RIAA stands for the Recording Industry Association of American, and you can view their website if you want at www.riaa.com . The use of software has also been the long running core argument of lawyers and other agents who argue on behalf of companies like limewire and Kazaa. They claim that they don't personally host or provide software, they merely provide a gateway to distribute non-copyrighted content. The RIAA has been successful and also unsuccessful thus far. Kazaa used that same core argument, but was eventually shut down. The site is still active but not updated, and nothing can be downloaded from the Kazaa software if anyone still uses it. Companies like Limewire are still active, as the RIAA has been unsuccessful in shutting them down thus far.|`|97izv0Dbaa	Limewire is the best! nobody is actually going to pay for all there music... just dl it.

3KBlWS7kaa	as long as you have the cord for it then you can hook it up, but it will take a bit longer to sync|`|AA12185618	Yeah!  Anything with a USB connector can play music on your 360.

xRimEBNgaa	My wife assures me that when her ipod was stolen she was able to recover all her stuff: lifetime movies, Christmas songs, some fella named Josh Groban, some chick named Enya. The real question is whether or not you even want to get another ipod, because things you own end up owning you. Or at least that's what your mom tells me.|`|JO8FKDRhaa	well of course the quicktime install has nothing to do with your itunes itself, so you'll be fine.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Yes they are safe, your songs are stored in your Music/itunes folder.  If you want you can move the folder to a safe place and reinstall itunes and move the folder back when you are done if it makes you feel better.<br>  <br>  You may have to relink the songs after you install by going to file>import to library and navigating to the itunes music folder.
kflO19X5aa	from what i can tell, its a sprint phone..|`|CkMTZbpzaa	i say you ask the people at the store
SKkE3fK1aa	I'd just like to tell you that the MORE MOVING parts a phone has, make it become more sensitive. So if you play sports or do a lot of work then stick with the one that has less moving parts as the hardware inside is more intact. Like a candybar phone.|`|sR0pOtqjaa	I think a straight forward phone is the best, so none of those you mentioned.|`|HVMigIcYaa	the slide is ok, side slide is cool, and flip is AWESOME!|`|LS1MuBWjaa	Flip Phones are way better with less problems!!!
mztIkIVUaa	Hi! Well go to your settings and display and just check and see if your contrast and brightness settings were changed some how and if not then your phone might be damaged or have a glitch. How long have you had the rumor for? Let me know. Good luck.
vny9zj6saa	send: stop ____________(the name of ), or try to call " say now'' or whateva the companys name is. try googling it, the call up-but if anything contact ur phone company.|`|4600zCeKaa	Try texting back the word "stop".
mirOK6Bzaa	Sprint doesn't have prepaid. The prepaid is through boost and you have to get another phone. Even if you have Nextel (which is the same company only prepaid) you would still need to get a Boost phone. Even then Sprint and Nextel are considered ONE company but run off of two different networks.|`|cUP8PmRIaa	No|`|FRgKX9PRaa	i don't think so
UorthUtvaa	Pros<br>  It's online for only $99 (<a href="http://nextelonline.nextel.com/NASApp/onlinestore/en/Action/SubmitRegionAction)" rel="nofollow">http://nextelonline.nextel.com/NASApp/on...</a><br>  camera for pics and videos<br>  keyboard for texting<br>  games<br>  internet access<br>  listen to music and watch videos<br>  <br>  Cons<br>  no touch screen (at least i dont think soo)<br>  without a contract it's more expensive -  over $200|`|f7t2MTn3aa	I think it's a good phone. It's easy to text on<br>  and it has amazing features. I don't think there's any <br>  cons in my opinion. I like the phone.
mirOK6Bzaa	Depends on the cell phone company. If you have T-Mobile they will let you unlock any T-Mobile phone for free every I think 30 days after you've been a costumer for 90 days.<br>  <br>  If you have AT&T/Cingular they won't let you unless you have a good reason to. I have ex boyfriend who is blind and I bought him a talking phone and he wanted it unlocked to take it to another company with him. They people have to send an email to a manger who sends you an email back to let you know if it's okay to unlock your phone.<br>  <br>  But it all depends on the company.<br>  <br>  No, not illegal.|`|BAKBPoAnaa	You cannot interchange between CDMA and GSM networks. <br>  <br>  Currently only GSM phones can be unlocked.<br>  <br>  If you wish to unlock an exisiting phone; try:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.UnlockThisPhone.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.UnlockThisPhone.com</a><br>  <br>  For a nominal cost, they will send you an unlock code which you can then punch in your phone to get it completely unlocked. Then you can use any SIM card you wish with it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.
PDB2YbA4aa	Try the enV2.<br>  <br>  Pros:<br>  Music Player<br>  BIG QWERTY keyboard<br>  48MB of memory and expandable to 2GB<br>  Camera and Camcorder<br>  Is on Verizon<br>  Stable Internet Browser<br>  Easy to use<br>  Good keyguard is available<br>  Takes awesome pictures!<br>  Comes with outer button texting.<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  Outer Screen is tiny.<br>  Camera is in awkward place and you may put your fingers on it.<br>  <br>  Also, pictures and videos are included in the unlimited TXT pack.|`|mirOK6Bzaa	Verizon has a phone like the IPhone.

I'm not sure how Verizon works with the messaging.|`|UorthUtvaa	Maybe a razor u can take pictures and videos it can be on verizon and u can text on it but its not a keyboard.|`|2cm2aj4Maa	It seems like you have Verizon. So I'd suggest an LG enV2 cuz that has a full keyboard with a lot of pic memory|`|deEWD1k3aa	Well, I had the Dare, but it was not very functional... So, I got the EnV2.  I LOVE IT.  It has full qwerty and number pad texting.  It has a music player, and you can record videos and sound clips. It's from Verizon too.  I have like 200 pics on it, and Picture Messaging is included in the Unlim Text plan.  You can email pics and send pics, I do it alllll the time :)  Blackberrys are not for the average kid or teen.  They are too complicated and they're more for business.  Plus, it is required that you have internet on it I think.  Overall, from what you've explained, the EnV2 is the best way to go <3|`|GEvnskVVaa	I suggest you purchase the Iphone it is top quality <br>  it even looks the part !!|`|peRVw6KXaa	I would definitely consider the LG EnV 2. It has a full QWERTY keyboard, music player, 2 megapixel camera with video recording, a micro SD slot that will support up to an 8 GB card for music and pic memory. It also has auto text readout (phone reads texts outloud for you) which is pretty cool.<br>  <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/controller?item=phoneFirst&action=viewPhoneDetail&selectedPhoneId=3726" rel="nofollow">http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store...</a><br>   <br>  <br>  Another good one would be the Samsung Alias. Also has a QWERTY keyboard, has a micro SD card for music and photos, a 1.3 megapixel camera/camcorder with a flash, flips 2 different ways which is pretty neat. <br>  <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/controller?item=phoneFirst&action=viewPhoneDetail&selectedPhoneId=3693" rel="nofollow">http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store...</a> <br>  <br>  Sorry, I don't have cons because I don't own the phones, but two of my friends do and I play around with them a lot and they are both pretty good phones<br>  Hope this helped
UHC4IJH6aa	Forget about kazaa. The best FREE, LEGAL, and SAFEST site/software I have used is Nexus Radio: <a href="http://www.nexusradio.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nexusradio.com</a><br>  <br>  It is 100% free and they have a bunch of music you can search and download. I have not found any other free or paid software that has as many features as Nexus Radio.<br>  <br>  I have been using it for over a year without any problems.<br>  <br>  First download the software. Now just open the Nexus Radio software and click the "On-Demand" tab. Enter the name of the artist/song in the search box and click search. Songs you download go directly to your "My Saved Files" folder located: C:\My Saved Files.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS: Never use limewire, Frostwire, or Bearshare...those networks are riddled with viruses and are heavily monitored for illegal file sharing!|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Sure why not. As long as they are imported in the right format.
ZqXUduJMaa	I'm pretty sure Best Buy will accept those items for recycling.|`|XnqS5uu6aa	You sound like a tree hugger.  Just throw them away|`|AA10714678	Most landfills have a seperate section where you can recycle old electronics gear...what you have mentioned, plus computers, tv's etc. It's just doing the right thing. No renumeration involved
RpCwfcRzaa	Yes. You can't lose your achievements ever. They're locked to your profile so put your profile and saves on a memory card and transfer them over over to your new hard drive. Recovering your gamertag form Live only brings your profile and achievements, not the actual saves so don't do it that way.|`|AA12185618	My friends got red-ringed.  Send your xbox to Microsoft and they will refurbish it and send it back to you.  If you have your 1-year warranty on it, they will do it for free.  If you don't then you will have to pay $100 and you get a renewed 1-year warranty.  Now, once you call them, you will have to ask some questions.  Once you completed those questions and such they will send you a box to put your 360 in.  ***Take out your hard-drive first and keep it in a safe place!  This will keep all of your achievements, gamerscore, downloads, and your gamertag intact.  If you don't do this, they will wipe it and send you a new one that has no memory on it.***  Click this link below to find your best way to contact Microsoft.  I hope this helps and good luck!|`|TfyoLOy7aa	Yes you can.  There is also a way to transfer all your licences from your xbox to your new one (so that any any game you've downloaded is open to all users of that machine instead of solely being linked to your gamertag.<br>  <br>  Apparently if you send it off to microsoft fot repair they do it for you<br>  <br>  But check out <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/support/drm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/support/drm/</a> just in case<br>  <br>  It also might be worth having a read of <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/907534" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/907534</a> because sometimes Microsoft repair consoles that are out of warrenty of the are showing the red ring of death|`|ers9EtSvaa	Well your gamerscore and achievements arent really saved to your xbox, (they are technically) but it is your gamertag that has it. All you have to do is recover your gamertag on your new xbox and you will get all of your gamerscore and achievements back. Also you dont have to send off your hard drive, as that wont be the probalem with your xbox.|`|AQ1136a2aa	Yes you can still keep your gamerscore and achievements, if you still have a memory device all you need to do is out that into your new one, or you can just recover it but the bad thing about that is if you haven't got a memory device all of your data will be gone but you will still have your achievements.|`|VcubhWv9aa	No no no no keep the hard drive, It has all your information plus Microsoft will steal it, Take it off keep it and put it on your new xbox when you get it.|`|Z6EWwPHiaa	Yes you can. on your new xbox just select recover gamer tag and fill in your xbox account details and it will download your gamer tag along with the scores etc.

If you have an internet plan you won't be charged but if you don't you better be careful...
mTVFb1u7aa	I've sold both of these phones at the same time so i have first hand experience to compare the two. I personally liked the LG Dare more because it is a lot thinner, sleeker, and sexier than the enV 2. because the enV flips open from the inside, it is a lot bulkier. the thing I like about the enV is that it has one of the best keyboards on the market. they're big and well spaced out and easy to press, so typing/texting is a breeze. If I were you, I'd do with the Dare though. Thinner, better looking, easier to navigate and it's got all the features you could possibly want. trust me, you won't be disappointed. it's a solid phone, fantastic design, fully loaded with cool features.|`|2cm2aj4Maa	enV2. Because the env2 has a full keyboard and the LG dare does too but its touch screen and thats a pain to text on. go 4 the env2|`|unas9YBraa	Honestly I would say go for the Versa. Then you can have the touch screen of the dare and the qwerty keyboard of the env 2. <br>  If you only have the two choices I would say get the Dare. The env 2 from what I have heard has major glitches.
kvzjULv6aa	make any ringtone you want from youtube. thats what i do. i look up the video on Youtube and use the free site VENTONES to convert it into a ringtone<br>  <br>  www. VENTONES .com<br>  <br>  FREE and easy<br>  <br>  <br>  you can make any ringtone you want for free, <br>  and if you dont have an mp3 file, <br>  <br>  you can just use a <br>  Youtube  video,<br>   its so easy because you can find any song in the world on Youtube|`|KWtjVW9saa	You can not use songs from the Media Player or create your own ringtone to use in a sidekick phone.You need to buy them from the Download Catalogue.|`|4aFgegSZaa	good phone because i am getting the sidekick 08! you could but its better if you save the music on your desktop and then you can put the music in sidekick.

I got mine for Christmas & the internet on it is just like regular internet on a computer except for you can't copy and paste things, and you can't download anything that could possibly be harmful to the ipod or cause pop ups or viruses. But other than that, you can go to and do anything! I lovee it because it's just like a mini lap top!<br>  But ofcourse you have to have a wi fi connection to have the internet to work! Definitely think you should get this! :)<br>  Good luck!|`|qMQeHVOhaa	Well, the internet isn't amazing for videos, it plays quicktime, youtube, and if you jailbreak it, it will play some flash videos (via the mobile cinema app) <br>  <br>  As far as games there are many available via appstore or if you jailbreak it cydia and installer.|`|US901zqGaa	it is great but you need to buy the service. i know, it stinks.
3Zm9vDw1aa	you should probably go to apple.com and press itunes and there will be a support or help link there you can report youre problem and they will most likely refund your gift card to what it should be.<br>  or you made a purchase in the past and your credit card or what ever didnt pay for it so it made your account in debt and it took the money when you entered your gift card
RpCwfcRzaa	Yes, but you can't install it to your hard drive and send it back to Gamefly if that's what you think. You still have to have the disk in the drive to prove you actually own the game. Otherwise, everyone would rent games and never buy any again. Installing games to the hard drive is to reduce load times and general wear and tear on your 360's disk drive.|`|VJ1C5JsYaa	Yes the game is still on the disc. But dont think that you can keep that game after you send it back. To play a game from the HD the disc is required to stay in the Xbox.
SfRS4GQgaa	It probably means you don't have enough memory left on your computer|`|242b5d3463143055c75676eb351f96e2aa	Close other programs you're running (including your web browser) and empty your trash. That will help free up RAM and might free up some working space.

6GIrW5eWaa	I think I understand the question but will try and overview it then answer. You are looking to play on line with others which will fully utilize your xbox live experience. It appears and I am only guessing that you are attempting to do this from the xbox live dashboard. The only online people you will see from the dashboard is people who are on your friends list. Most all games that have online matchmaking or co-op mode you have to be in that game first then follow the menus to an area that states multiplayer or online. <br>  <br>  For example, I have COD WaW. If I want to play campaign by myself I follow the menu after I press the start button to solo and then select the mission I wish to play on. If I want to play either co-op or multi-player I follow those links then to xbox live and then select the game type I want to participate in. (very general overview). <br>  <br>  Sorry for the wordiness on this but I do hope it helps. If you need additional info I can try and provide a step by step. Good Luck

If you just got it, I would HIGHLY recommend you purchase the insurance on the phone. If you do break it, it will be $130 rather than $400. I get broken phone calls everyday and the insurance is truly a kick *** thing to have.
AD0qGTBPaa	Alright. I have never heard of this problem until now. Quick google search shows 2-3 things fixing this:<br>  <br>  1. Flip your ps3 over, insert disc, flip back over. (The theory is that the ps3 thinks there's a pebble or something in your disc tray. If so, doing this should fix that false positive.)<br>  <br>  2. Try holding the eject button down for 30 sec. or so until it makes a bunch of noises. (It's called a force eject, and is supposed to do the same thing as #1.)<br>  <br>  3. Open it up, Clean lens with duster/microfiber cloth. (I cannot see how this could work, but it apparently did at least once with someone's console. Actually, it worked with my friend's console as well, but his machine would take discs...it just wouldn't read them.)<br>  <br>  If these don't work, I'm afraid you have no choice but to call sony, pay approx. $100 in shipping and $200 in repairs....not a nice choice. Good luck! I hope something works!|`|sFz6v7Ohaa	You might want to contact Sony and you might want to decide if you want to repair your PS3, or get a new one:<br>  <br>  PS3 FAQ's:<br>  <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/support/ps3" rel="nofollow">http://www.us.playstation.com/support/ps...</a><br>  <br>  Service and repair:<br>  <a href="https://service1.us.playstation.com/rma.htm?_flowExecutionKey=_cD85A6398-C4C7-ACF3-4CF8-F285A914ACBF_kAA6A6D8F-10E9-13F9-BF89-B8CF8AF18F58" rel="nofollow">https://service1.us.playstation.com/rma....</a>

If yours isn't, it may pay you to check Craigslist or browse your local GameStop or EB for a second hand controller, they are often offered with a limited warranty from retail stores like that. If yours is still under warranty, I wouldn't try to repair it yourself as to not void your warranty, but if it isn't, I couldn't hurt to try to fix it yourself.|`|AD0qGTBPaa	Ahh same thing happened with me. The guitar wasn't under warranty so I opened it up. I just kinda messed with stuff, closed it up, and ta-da! It magically worked for some reason.

UinOWcMUaa	I wouldn't buy a plasma at all... so maybe try wating if you do decide to go with a plasma till the end of the year. With such a big plasma, you would be better off getting the one that produces the 1080p.. you will kick yourself in the but for not waiting. Anyways.. the reason I wouldn't by a plasma, is because of the energy consumption it uses, the shorten life-span of a plasma compared to an LCD, and also... because they are doing away with plasma technology with in the year or so !!! Anyways.. I would suggest researching more about this and take your time. It is a big investment :)|`|AA11877492	At 60"-65", it makes sense to go 1080p to future proof your viewing. I assume you will have this TV for many years. Selling and an upgraded replacement after a couple of years is not viable for most of us as the price you will get for your used TV is perhaps 1/3 of what you paid. <br>  For most people and for most purposes, plasma is the best and preferred technology for TVs of 42" and up. BTW, the very best dollar-fro-dollar plasma currently sold, for both performance and reliability, is the Panasonic Viera.

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Blu-ray can hold more data, so Blu-ray movies can have a higher resolution.  <br>  <br>  Blu-ray movies are only as good as the TV, so if you play Blu-ray movies on a regular TV, it will look like a regular TV, but if you put it on a HD TV, it will definitely look better than on a regular TV.|`|fWclxi9Baa	when you have a hdtv and a blu ray player it is crazy awesome you will be blown away as how good the sound and picture is|`|YhdfaEJVaa	There's a few things you should know about Blu-Ray Discs, first off their capacity is 50Gbs as of right now. A DVD is 8 I belive. What that means is when a movie is burned onto a Blu-RAY disc nothing has to be compressed like sound or picture, a SD tv tends to run colors together not making it look as clear. A HDTV the higher resolution the better what all those numbers stand for the 420p, 720p, 1080, and last and the greates 1080p is. From top to bottom their is 420 rows or lines running horizontally, the higher amount of lines the more room the colors have to be displayed allowing less color sharing pixels and also allows the edges of things to be better distinguished. So yes a HDTV is a must to reap the power of Blu-ray. I have a 46" 120hz Samsung and absolutely love it!. The picture in movies look actually sharper than real life sometimes, I'm not sure if that makes since but it is just so mind blowing.<br>  <br>   If you play a ps3 on a <br>  SDTV =STANDARD DEFINTION TELEVISION  you won't notice a difference. But I promise once you get a HDTV and an action packed Blu-ray movie or a bright and colorful movie you will never wanna watch a DVD again. And dvds look better on a HDTV with a ps3 cause it has a upconverter.<br>  <br>    Save yourself up some money get atleast a 40" HDTV. People will say sony is best but!.....a Samsung is just as good and some models are even better than Sony bravia's line of HDTV. But don't get smaller then a 40" you will thank me. If you wanna see size difference go to BestBuy look at a 40" then look at a 46" you think you see a big difference there wait until you get it set up in your home. They look huge. I know you didn't ask for all this extra info but I went through a lot of trouble shopping for my HDTV and sales reps are just trying to sell you the most exspensive TV's they have to make more money or to look good.I searched for weeks and did lots of research to find the best. I suggest a 550 series or up in samsungs tv. One more thing buy a lcd not a plasma. Plasma has chance images will burn into screen. I don't think you wanna see the channel six symbol or WB sign or the HUD from your fav game everytime you try to watch tv or play a game.<br>  <br>  Sorry if it too much info just trying to help|`|pOU8l2ofaa	The difference isn't just seen on hd tv's. The thing about it is that they don't have to compress the data to fit it on the disc so quality isn't lost on the dcompression. The difference is mostly seen in the background of movies. They will be crisper and less fuzzy even on standard tv's.|`|PxAZ3X8Waa	I couldnt of said it any better. My HD plasma Tv owns when im waching blue rays on my ps3, but then when i hook it up to one of my shitty tv it looks like im waching a normal dvd

E2G6J5JPaa	Every 360 does that|`|RpCwfcRzaa	It's normal for a 360 to blow out hot air. Just make sure you keep it in a well ventilated area out of closed media cabinets and off of carpet and don't sit it on top of any other electronic equipment. Also, make sure you don't play it for too long at a time and let your 360 cool down after wards.|`|VJ1C5JsYaa	All electronics get hot when in use. It could be bad it just depends on how hot its getting. If you have it in some type of entertainment system I would take it out and either put it on the floor (or if you have carpet floors put it on a book or something hard) while in use this will allow it to breath a little more. Also if you are concerned about how hot it get you might want to turn it off take a break and then play again (Im not sure how long it takes to heat up since you didnt say). The worst that could happen is then RRoD and you will have to send it in. If you want you may also want to install the games to the HD to see if that will help cool it down. Good luck.|`|FrzCscBlaa	im on a second 360 and my first one lasted about a year, all 360s will overheat in about a year or so, hey google it then, and my advice is not to buy a cooler because i heard that it will melt and meld with your 360 which is super bad because it will be plugged into your 360 and use up more energy and heat up even faster than without it, best thing you can do is keep game time to a minimum (which sucks i know) and honestly it will not matter where you put the thing in your room because if you take it apart, it will get hot either direction you put it just at least never put it on the floor.|`|L1FUcmb0aa	Try placing it in a spot where it can get air. Otherwise, get a cooling fan for your Xbox 360. You can try putting a fan next to the Xbox 360 (on its side) to try cooling it down. Also, try playing in intervals. Your Xbox 360 could be getting hot simply from overuse.|`|ZmuxaJYpaa	yeh all xbox's get hot and blow out hot air. if u want, u can buy an cooler for your 360|`|L0AZ6tHGaa	All OLDER 360's have a problem with overheating. The new models however have solved that problem. If your 360 is an older model, (Pre-November 2008) then you're going to want to buy an Inter-cooler. They're about 10 bucks. I own one and it makes a huge difference in cooling down your XBox. I highly recommend buying one, although it is a little noisy.

HVQFVtelaa	Do not turn it on again for a few days. If the battery is removable, remove it. Do not get in a hurry to turn it back on if you want to save it.<br>  <br>  You may gently and carefully apply soft heat from a distance with a hair dryer several times a day. If you put it outside to help dry, avoid the sun and take it in before dark.<br>  <br>  There are many crevices inside that can retain moisture, they must all be dry before you install the battery and recharge it. If you are patient you have a good chance to save it. <br>  <br>  Good luck, It worked for me with cell phones that laid all night at the bottom of a puddle.

j5Apt8hWaa	Unfortunately, you are going to go from one $200 camera to another since most cameras in that range do not have aperture or shutter priority options and all suffer from shutter lag.<br>  <br>  The only camera type that measure shutter lag in milliseconds instead of full seconds, are the DSLR type cameras.  The smallest cannot be put in your pocket or purse unless you have one the size of a backpack.  Yes they are durable, have fast shutter speeds (1/4000th second) and are capable of producing great picture quality ... however that is really up to the skills of the photographer.  DSLR's are certainly considered a good camera for amateurs who want to shoot nature and people, since they can use lenses from fish-eye to extreme telephoto.<br>  <br>  The camera that has the most bang for the buck can be found here ... $450 for the camera and 18-55 mm lens, one that will give you great opportunities to shoot landscapes, group shots and portraits ... for another $100, you can get an additional lens, the 55-200 mm which will give you a better reach when shooting your boys, charging around and for shooting wildlife.  You can find those camera packages on Amazon.|`|RCbtRF4xaa	I purchased the Canon SD770IS to replace a PowerShot A95. A couple years ago, I had purchased a Digital Elph for a family member and found myself using that much smaller and lighter camera, instead of my A95. Given advancements in technology, it was time to upgrade. The most important feature in looking for a replacement was small size and the use of a rechargeable battery. Pixel resolution was less a factor as the A95, with only 5 megapixels, produced sharp images. The most noticeable improvement, even over the previous Elph, was in the increased speed of all camera functions including boot up and image recording. Image quality is stellar and the color balance and metering is excellent. If you currently own a Canon digital camera and are upgrading, the basic navigation of features remains primarily the same, so that will be familiar to you. Access to the camera's shooting modes use menus rather than a physical dial as on the A95. The LCD screen is fairly large, well illuminated and easy to view, even in bright light. Ultimately, the most important consideration with digital photography should be image quality and ease of use. I have years of experience with manual SLR film cameras and point and shoots alike, and this model fits the bill perfectly for true "turn it on and shoot" photography. Images are crisp and clear with great detail and vibrant color. The light meter does a great job of assessing the scene and choosing the best possible combination of shutter speed and aperture. I highly recommend this camera for someone looking for an easy-to-use, lightweight, small and effective digital camera. A high capacity (SDHC) memory card will hold a ridiculous number of photos even at the highest resolution. Uploading photos to a PC or Mac is easy with either the supplied software or Apple's iPhoto software, which works seamlessly with the camera. I would recommend both a high capacity SD card and the optional leather case to protect the camera, especially if dropped.

KiVENZoBaa	Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles is not really a fun game to play, even with two players. Sure it was fun at first but then after a few levels, things tend to get very complicated. First off, its a really cheap version of The House of the Dead series. The characters walk pretty slow and killing zombies and other creatures take some time, even when shot in the head it still is pretty hard to kill them, wasting your ammo. Speaking of ammo and guns, they pretty much waste really fast due to how much ammo is contained in it and then you only have the hand gun, which has unlimited ammo, but reloaded takes so long and can tend to get annoying when fighting a pack of Zombies or a Boss and its pretty weak too. Other guns such as machine guns reload fast but like i said, ammo waste so fast. Other guns such as shot guns and rocket launchers take a **** load of time to reload. As for the characters, the voice acting is not so great. For example you're being attacked by these monkey zombies and they talk all calm while you shoot at them. and the only time that the characters run or walk fast is if they are running away from a boss or an action scene is in place. And the game is really short if you play it a lot without "dieing" all the time. <br>  <br>  Overall, Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles gets a 1 out of 10.<br>  If you're still interested in playing this game, I strongly recommend renting it or playing it with a friend that has it.

The big thing is to keep you PS3 in an open space where it can "breath". Overheating is not a huge problem, but it is best to give it a little space.

wIM3vNtwaa	They answered this on Inside XBOX a few days ago (The Sent U A Message thing)<br>  <br>  Basically: It reduces wear and tear on the hardware because the disc doesn't spin which reduces heat and noise, less chance of games being destroyed.<br>  <br>  You still need the disc to prevent piracy (renting a game, installing and returning it)|`|VJ1C5JsYaa	So far the closest answer to being right is Keys. The three main purposes for installing a game to the HD is:<br>  <br>  1. The system will not get as hot during play. Since the disc is not spinning in the tray the power and friction used and created from the disc is eliminated. This helps protect your system from overheating and getting the RRoD<br>  <br>  2. The second purpose is so that when playing games you wait less. Information stored on the HD is easyer for the system to access then from a CD this reduced the load times in most games. While you may not notice it they are reduced. The only game this does not apply to is Halo 3. This game will run slower if installed to the HD.<br>  <br>  3. The system does not run as loud. With no disc spinning the system is no at loud. Simple as that.<br>  <br>  Also of course you will need to have the Disc in the system to play. Did you honestly think you would not need the disc? If that was the case who would buy games anymore? Once people had the game once they would never keep it.They might rent it then never buy it. No income for the game company means no more games. This would be the stupidest thing ever done if that was the case. Would you own a company make thousands of copy's of something and be able to stay in business if only 1 or 2 copy's actually got sold?|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	Lets say you scratch your disc and it won't play past a certain point. If you can load the game to the HD, the scratch won't really matter.  From a performance perspective I can't really tell a diff. I have Oblivion & Ninja Gaiden 2 loaded to ours.

AA10959572	No Apple products are "worth" it.<br>  <br>  They are over-hyped and have been so popular because they managed to get in the MP3 player game early.<br>  <br>  iTunes makes a mess on computers, and quality wise, iPods are very basic/average.<br>  <br>  Don't believe me? just check out the mp3 player section; over 95% of questions/problems are for iPods.<br>  <br>  What I recommend is for you to know which features that you want and go test a few out at your local stores.<br>  <br>  Personally, I have; 3 models of Zens, Zvue260, Lyras, and 3rd market brands, and others, and all have been great.|`|fecUjSr1aa	No, they're not worth it and stay away from apple products like ipods, itouch and i-whatever, too many compatibility issues and it will cost you more in the longer run .. nice products though but too much headache ..<br>  <br>  go for Zen creative series, plenty of models to choose from ... Zune are also good .. sansa sandisk are great too, they offer a lot of varieties. aside from that these types are reasonably priced and in some cases, have more features than the apples.<br>  <br>  free music download choices, ease of controlling of your files and a lot of other free stuffs ..<br>  <br>  hope this helps you out|`|ec7d28d765edf139081e438d86fd653daa	Well...the ipod shuffle might be small but, it can hold as many songs as a ipod classic can or any ipod. It doesn't depend on the ipod but it depends on the gig as to how many songs it will hold. The smaller ones tend  to break more easily and are harder to keep track of. There is no difference in how many sings it will hold.|`|1d4e0e45453512158e7c2dc21d0bb0c9aa	NO. Run away. Apple makes appealing products but they are not worth the money and seriously lack quality. If you want a good mp3 player get a sony or sansa. There are probably some of the best rated mp3 players. Ipods are overrated and do nothing more then a mp3 player. Even more annoying an Ipod is an mp3 player and vice versa, but everyone calls anything that plays music an Ipod.|`|YEbQbbqqaa	no i think personally they are useless, you cant see the song playing so you cant actually choose one - have to keep skipping until you get to one you like.<br>  <br>  if you want an iPod i think you should get any with a screen, they are much better.|`|5xQESoC4aa	Noooooo!

91Xppbgoaa	Unless you  get some sort of employee discount, I would just keep your same plan and get the add on for $30. It ends up being $10 less a month than if you just go with the BB Email and Messaging Plan and you get all the same features. Why do they have it then? That plan is mostly for corporate users, who would pay $44.99 a month for email to configure the BB to work with their work email address. That plan saves THOSE people money,  but NOT you. If you just want to get your yahoo, aol, gmail, etc type of email and browse the web freely, then just get the add on for $30. You don't need the other plan and anyone who tells you different is just trying to make commision off you.|`|pNKBszseaa	I do not have Verizon but i do have Sprint and i just bought 2 blackberry curves. I had to buy a very similar plan. It is 99.99 a month(each) and everything is unlimited. txt, picture, unlimited minutes. to answer your question i don't think you need to buy that extra plan. the 99.99 plan should suffice.<br>  <br>  <br>  **let me warn you as much as i really liked this phone it is very very complicated.** Im still trying to figure it out, and i have had it a week

b3b9eafde2a033943ecae8909779b52baa	Buy the actual CD, like on Amazon or whatever.  The sound quality is better.|`|f9f5eb7a2590ee5242a18dc42abeef7baa	songs yes, albums - yes only if the album is worth it.  otherwise, i'd rather buy the original CD with high audio bitrate quality.|`|D4woInVAaa	Dude don't even waist your time just go to lime wire or frost wire and drag it into itunes and bing! your str8 for life.|`|D8jU4xhsaa	i agree with the first guy just watch out for viruses on the wires
GgBZwa1Baa	There is a program I beleve is called Switch sound file converter. If it doesn't turn it into mp3 for you. Use it to turn the file to wave. Wave can be converted to mp3 on your itunes ( DO not worry about quallity compression as wave is uncompressing it) Delete the wave when you are done as it will be fairly big (like 100 megs ore something) If this does not work then google : Flac to wave. Or to mp3...I recommend to wave personally. Anywho hopes this helps<br>  <br>  p.s. Zamzar is probably your best bet online converting. But I recommend my way better if you can. Still Zamzar helps if you have no other choice. it will get the job done for you|`|8iioljq5aa	if you are playing it on vlc player then there is no other software you need, open the .flac file in vlc player, press 'stop' button , goto File> Wizard > Transcode/Save to file (press Next)<br>  Existing Playlist item (press Next)<br>  Transcode Audio> Select dummy (Next) Select "wav" (Next)<br>  'Choose' to Save the file anywhere on your pc..<br>  Just add ".mp3" while you save the file<br>  ..<br>  And beleive me once you through with this....for next time..it'll be just a matter of seconds to convert any file for ipod.<br>  ...

Your controls possibly got inverted. If it does this on another game, try turning your system off and letting it set for a few minutes to see if it continues, if it doesn't do this on any other game, go into COD settings and check the controller settings, they probably got inverted somehow.|`|xWoJooeMaa	happend on my ps2 controller many times they useually go funny on you (so you have to buy a new one) its all part of there bussines to make more money
D8jU4xhsaa	put the un-editable songs on a general file and right click each one and uncheck the box by "read only" then drag those back onto your itunes. unfortunately you may have to do this one at a time so it'll take a while, sorry<br>  if that does't work then those songs haven't posted as shared files completely|`|PdmaKwhNaa	It can be that you only have Read Permissions on the files, the dude whos sharing them must set so everyone has Read/Write permissions i think.|`|OE0McP7Naa	hack ur ipod idk if itll work but its fun

zPu9tppgaa	Hi Skye,<br>  <br>  There are two problems here: What do you mean by chip and what would you like its effect to be?<br>  <br>  1. There are no region mods meaning you cannot play NTSC games on an XBOX360 (yet).<br>  2. The current 'chips' just let you play games copied and burned using a specific cd writer. They cannot be played on XBOX live either.<br>  3. You can get pre-modded XBOX360's from x-mods.com which will allow you to play 'backed up' or 'copied' games providing you write them with the correct dvd writer.<br>  <br>  X-MODS were good when they were run by the original owner, I do not know if they still are but I assume they will be.

lQGDV7MEaa	Unlike the other two answers (both of which think it's odd for it to be at 74GB), it's not odd at all.<br>  <br>  You see, data is sold and read two different ways. It's sold as 1000^3 bytes = 1GB, which means 80GB is equal to 80,000,000,000 bytes. The PS3 reads it differently, using binary coding, which means that 1024^3 bytes = 1GB. This makes the number lower, but it still offers the same amount of data storage.<br>  The reason you get 64GB out of 74GB is that the PS3 reserves some space for the OS, usually about 5-7% of the overall drive. If you went out and bought a 250GB hard drive, you'd have 205GB in the end. It's a rip off, yes, but the industry is to blame for this one.|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	The 6GB is for important system OS and stuff. Your PS3 can't function without it.<br>  <br>  Mine is like that too, but I don't know why.|`|YhdfaEJVaa	64? Odd it should say 74, unless they have changed what the standard OS is on it and the amount of room it takes, mine said 74 when I first got it but then again I have a backward compatible ps3, but I don't think it would be less then a non BC ps3. Call sony and ask maybe there is something wrong with HDD, like OS got dowloaded twice? That's really odd. And you haven't put anything on it, was it new?<br>  <br>  The third guy is right about the way data is crunched but a brand new ps3 that is 80gb should read 74/74 the data crunched is included in the missing GBs. <br>  So the 6Gb missing isn't odd its the other 10 that is.|`|RPRJ9yabaa	it shouldnt be 64gb, it should be more like 77-79<br>  <br>  if you bought it at gamestop and it says new it doesnt mean its new.. im not saying you did, im just saying if thats what you did... call sony.. they will be able to tell you the exact reason.. im nice enough to find my manual to get you the number :)<br>  <br>  1-800-345-7669<br>  <br>  if you want add me on PlaystationNetwork<br>  <br>  username: mooselove94|`|1WgOj89kaa	This is normal, mine only had 74 GB. This is because all of the default software and settings are already installed on the system. Perfectly normal.|`|qxTXr4Gxaa	it is probably operating system space not to mention it is not a true 80 gig, it is probably more like 73 empty

Zdyd7rYtaa	Gears of 2 is a GREAT game. This game was actually one of the top 3 best games I played when it was released in 2008. I really liked the campaign mode, the story that unfolds is quite great. I have played many games but this game is one of the better games in a LONG time. Online is okay at least if you don't play wingman because the really good players that grind on this game play that mode and you wouldn't have a chance (I haven't even won once in like 25+ tries at it.)|`|9AR6B4ELaa	best shooting game other than fallout 3|`|NARak4iBaa	Its a good game.  better then the first game.  I don't see a lot of re-play value of the game.  The online is okay, but not great compared to Halo and Call of Duty.|`|yZK8NcnSaa	I think its REALLY good! I havent played it much online but I went thru the story and it was pretty good. I personally liked GOW1 better tho.|`|1WgOj89kaa	Very ovaerrated on my opinion, just the same as Gears 1.|`|nJRE5Aedaa	game of the year, hands down.|`|RG0Khn1vaa	well if u aren't usually into shooting games or don't like blood and gore you are in for a surprise. MOst the hand to hand combat is nothing but blood and gore but if you like that kind of stuff it is an amazing game. The one thing i have heard alot was about the online play and the campaign, people say they were better for Gears Of War 1. Aside from that Horde mode is a fun game you and/or your friends could play, this mode is where you kill wave after wave of enemies to try to stay alive.

Xxviy63Paa	Right, don't use a cleaning disc, that will just scratch the lens. To clean it, you have to take the ps3 apart and do it manually.<br>  <br>  But that's the only hard part. Once you get the lens exposed, it's as simple as any cd or dvd lens. Use a q-tip soaked in isopropyl alcohol. Start with the tip in the middle of the lens, and move it in a spiral outwards. Don't press down, just let the weight of the qtip itself be the only pressure on the lens. <br>  <br>  Propanol is the best cleaner for this because it is a good reagent, and evaporates almost immediately with no residue. Which is very important on the lens, not to have any residue left on there after the stuff evaporates.|`|PIVKGi2Eaa	well it if its jacked up there's these places like video and game stores that have these things that takes out scratches were im from cost 5 bucks. that's how i got  my games fixed hop it helped. just call local game stop or video store if they cant do ask them if they no a store that can|`|RPRJ9yabaa	hmm...you might not want to do this but this is all i could find... and its the cheapest one :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buy.com/prod/maxell-blu-ray-lens-cleaner-lens-cleaner/q/loc/111/208535017.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.buy.com/prod/maxell-blu-ray-l...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope its what you want!|`|1WgOj89kaa	Propanol is the best but is the hardest to get.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	alcohol<br>  <br>  works for ALL types of lens

YhdfaEJVaa	Well. Actually it might not wrong. If you are running hdmi to a dvi adapter there's a problem...I understand why your doing it but don't you think its odd there's no HDMI  input for the monitor?  Now I'm not entirely familiar with monitor but if it doesn't support 720p it won't support 1080i sound like to me it just reverting back to what it does support and letting you know its not supporting 1080i. I could be wrong but all tv's and monitors that I know of will support 720p if it supports 1080i. Did you notice a differnce in picture quality when that little notice floats around the screen? If not it is just going back to 420p.<br>  <br>  OR there's a incompatibily issue with HDMI, and DVI and monitor. And its trying to display image but is having some issues that are not so obviously displayed If that's so. That little message will never go away.<br>  Again I could be wrong but I've a few PC's and I own a ps3. And I've never heard of this before.<br>  <br>  OR.... try and mess with the support in I believe "my computer" section. You might be able to tweak to setting to get the 720p as well. It could be any of the above.|`|RPRJ9yabaa	aww, im sorry... okay you might want to go into "my computer" and there should be a support changer<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i help!!|`|DGOANtyfaa	i got a acer 20 inch no broplem 1080p is great go to setings on ps3 and menu on the monitor tha is it goood set up you got

Unfortunately the Zune 3.0 software has a glitch which does not allow the user to use all 120GB worth of space.  The Zune forums have been recently getting blasted by users who are getting errors they are running out of space even though they have over 40GB+ free on the HDD left.  Apparently Microsoft updated it with a crappy DB that holds less than 45k items (music + movies + pictures).  It would be in your interest to keep away from Zune until they decide to fix this issue because apparently, they don't know how they want to fix it yet but acknowledge it's a problem with the 3.0 software.  The batteries on Zunes are shoddy at best.  The issues with Zune 30GBs bricking after trying to recalibrate the battery from a complete drainage show the batteries aren't top quality either.

UphoLYGYaa	Don't believe Mike.  HDMI is the best connection for video and audio for you PS3.  You have to configure the audio to run through the HDMI.  Under the Settings section of the XMB there is an Audio Settings section. Use that to set the audio to run the HDMI.  It probably is still set to run through the AV plugs, which is why you only hear the audio with the AV jacks in.  I had this problem when I first hooked up my HDMI cord too, so I know exactly what you are experiencing. I did this and everything has been fine ever since.|`|1WgOj89kaa	This happened to my TV, so i just switched back to AV Cables. Trust me, there is NO difference.

Does anyone else have acsess to your tv? Did you check to see if the speakers in the menu were turned on. When you go to turn on volume do you see the bar on the left or does it not show up. Is it just via Ps3 how about cable tv? Try unplugging tv for few seconds then turn back on. Also try resetting tv sound to defaults. Try pluggin it into different HDMI slot. Also check ps3 settings it could be possible that the sound is being sent somewher else. Or sound card on ps3 burnt out. Call sony 1-800-345-7669 if non of above works.<br>  <br>  ***********EDIT**********<br>  <br>  Sorry I just reread your question. So sound works with AV cable. Could be bad HDMI CABLE.

When you found it, remember that location and turn your phone and your friend's phone's bluetooth ON and VISIBLE. The Bluetooth Application should be on the settings portion of your phone. Then back to the file, go to options and select Send to Bluetooth, or Copy to Bluetooth (on some motorola phones you need to select Copy then select Bluetooth).<br>  <br>  Then send it. Once it is sent, the phone you have sent the file to will alert you.

LF618M1faa	File a complaint with the local police department. They will give you a website to go to where you can log all of the times that that company is calling, and for every time it is logged, the company gets fined $500. Eventually, they will stop. Or, you could call the company back and ask to be taken off of their list and explain that you are on the Do Not Call Registry. This normally works.|`|nnRBufFoaa	i used to work for a marketing research company, which is more like calls for on the phone surveys. telemarketing is illegal, so these are probably the calls you're getting and their intro's sound a lot alike. now these are conducted for companies like your local shopping mall or your cell phone company, to get your opinion on their services, and they can give your number to these research companies. so just get a caller id and if the number is from out of state or the title says anything with "research" or "marketing", say your not interested or theyll call you back until your at your witts end.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	If you're already on the do not call list... invest in call display. If you don't recognize the number, don't answer.|`|SYaSbJb5aa	idk but it's f_cking annoying!|`|8dVoufqoaa	My Suggestion would be to answer the call, take down as much information about the company as you can. After getting a business address and phone number listing from them advise them that you are on the Federal Do Not Call List. Keep in mind a lot of these companies and call centers now work outside the United States so they do not abide by US laws. These companies can be reported by sending their information to the following link, <a href="https://www.donotcall.gov/complaint/complaintcheck.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://www.donotcall.gov/complaint/comp...</a><br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that these calls may be from non-profit organizations who the do not call list does not protect you from.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	Anywhere that you use a credit card will call you with offers. Also, if you use a credit card, some place are not secure and will sell your phone number to any company they can to get money.|`|maHZCMNiaa	You may have a private number, and be registered with the Do Not Call Registry, however telemarketers can get your phone number in numerous way. Some unscrupulous firms pay people to "dumpster dive" and find non-shredded papers with personal information. Stores and credit card companies may also sell your information if it is not listed in the contract you signed.<br>  <br>  I suggest investing in caller ID. Escaping telemarketers is really impossible.

9M8lEQDqaa	Gold. <br>  <br>  It was a nice step up from Red and it came out just before I started to find Pokemon to be kinda dumb. <br>  <br>  I always had the same problem though: I'd play it non-stop until I beat the 7th gym leader then I'd stop playing it for about a month then when I pick it up again it's like, "so... what/where the hell I'm supposed to do/go?"<br>  I did that twice before I actually beat it. Ho-oh, red gyrados and Totedile (whatever he evolved into, I can't remember)<br>  <br>  I might have considered Saphire but it pissed me off with that Clampearl Trade evolution bull **** and Red was my favorite but gold is better in my opinion.

WdJfXF0Kaa	Hi. I actually just did this. What I did was bought a WinTV-HVR 950 Hybrid Tv stick. I got this at futureshop for 150. Then I picked up an RF Modulator, Got this at the source for 40. Then those colored cables you mentioned, There called composite or RCA connectors which i ran to the modulator. Then I got a F-type connector and ran that from the modulator to the USB stick. After messing around with the software, I managed to get my XBOX 360 to appear on my laptop. On  the composite cable for your 360, You need to set that to TV...Not HDTV or else the RF wont work. It is impossible to get true HD with this setup because there are no modulators that i can tell that have HDMI Inputs. I adjusted the colors and brightness and saturation etc. of the picture and i am really pleased with how it looks. I heard alot of bad things about the quality of the picture from people who have claimed to of done this, But  maN, They must be using cheap hardware cuz as far as i can tell this is awesome looking!!!! (Just make sure you do adjust the display properties inside wintv) My next little project is to get s-video setup. Everyhting i have tried has renedered a blurry picture. Sooo not sure if s-video will work. Okay so just get this stuff it'll cost ya but you will have a laptop running XBOX 360 promise.|`|cNE6nE16aa	i dont there you can hook it up iv tried that before and dosnt work for me even the vga cord doesnt work. you could you a computer desktop moniter if you want i know that will work

oB2au3ezaa	They don't hear you and I don't know of a way to allow them to hear you because you hear the vocals of the artist when you're singing on key so to allow them to hear you sing instead would mean your voice would have to drown out the band's vocalist.

AA10950302	As far as performance, they are all the same. The only major differences between them is the size of the storage it comes with. Either a 256MB memory card (Arcade) or a 60GB (Pro) or 120GB (Elite) hard drive. Everything else is pretty much the same.|`|xPU6xRQ8aa	The elite, 120gb hard drive, and all the cables, reduced a lot but that's because the HDMI is no longer there, you can buy the HDMI cable on eBay|`|SrVXSeX2aa	120 Gig but it costs a lot more

AA10492848	Surge Protection is all about reducing OVER VOLTAGE spikes to non-destruction levels.  I think your new Roomie is referring to LOW VOLTAGE events, which are actually more common occurrences.  Either way, you can protect your valuable equipment.<br>  <br>  PRICE is NO indicator of quality, despite people's opinions to the contrary.<br>  <br>  The ratings on Surge Protectors are in JOULES, a Unit of Energy.  They limit the amount of Energy that can enter your end device.  A GOOD one has an indicator lamp that tells you IF the device is still operating correctly.  Most good ones also come with a WARRANTY for your plugged in equipment.<br>  <br>  UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supplies) are power supply units that prevent/limit Low Voltage events AND High Voltage Spikes.  These are general expensive AND heavy, but offer the greatest amount of protection from all Voltage fluctuations.   Also, if the power goes out completely, you can have a few seconds to minutes to SAVE your work on a computer.  Surge Strips CANNOT do this....|`|kCSJyM8Laa	Do not buy one from Walmart...go to a good electronics store and pay about $60-$70 bucks per  surge protector and use them especially on your electronics stuff
VcNHahtgaa	I heard that Road to the Show is a lot better.

The Graphics are a lot better and the small things in the gameplay makes the game look really like real life.|`|bjl4qjmbaa	MLB 09: The Show is only good on an HDTV.. I heard the lag is really bad online, but I've yet to play online because i've been having connection problems.  Road To The Show is really cool..

I personally have had the 1st gen. iPhone since Oct. 07 and have never regretted it. One of the really cool things about it is that is seamlessly connects all of your information in one place, better than a lot of devices before it.

So if you are planning on getting both anyway- go with GH WT- then just use those instruments to play Rock Band 2- saves you money in the long run and space.  Just buy 2 remotes- and you will still be saving money!

nhYABprkaa	0.5 is wider<br>  a UV filter is fine<br>  <br>  You will lose your zoom power to 25% to 50%|`|9mTctb7jaa	UV is not visible. But photographic color films are sensitive in the UV range, so too much UV affects their exposure and color balance. A color film camera benefits from always using a UV filter when outdoors.<br>  <br>  Video cameras are not nearly as sensitive in the UV range. For video cameras, having either a UV filter or clear filter is just for mechanical protection of the main lens. You would be wise to use one whenever possible.<br>  <br>  A 0.45 or 0.5 x filter mount adaptor will be indistinguishable in use. The quality factors depend more on the manufacturer ability to achieve the proper lens shape. Inadequate design or construction methods will result in a wide-angle lens with poor resolution, meaning that all those extra HD pixels will be wasted to focus blur.  <br>  <br>  If you do not want barrel distortion, then a 0.7 or 0.8 x adaptor is better choice, especially if you intend to keep the adaptor on full-time even when zoomed into the telephoto range. The 0.50 or .45 x is really just for super wide shots only, they are not for general purpose shooting.

EJIsHdZhaa	congratulations on your drive, its great to see somebody at your age being serious enough about photography to save up for a DSLR.<br>  <br>  My first question would be what kind of camera do you use just now, if its a 40yr old nikon or pentax with a k mount then you could get a digital slr that can also use these lenses.<br>  <br>  If its a manual focus canon or minolta pentax screw mount or zenit praktika etc then you are pretty much going to have to buy into a new system.<br>  <br>  With the money you've saved you are also looking at a new but entry level camera, something like a sony a200, pentax km or k200d, or canon eos1000d, or nikon d40x<br>  <br>  All good cameras, i personally like canon, of all the systems canon and nikon are the most widely used by professionals, and have the widest range of lenses and accessories.<br>  <br>  These entry level cameras are all great value, but they lack some features that may limit your expanding interest, some have basic af systems, none have a high buffer speed or shooting rate, none have a studio flash port.<br>  <br>  To get the most for your money you might want to consider buying used, great cameras like the Nikon D70s, Canon 20d or the Fuji Finepix s3pro (takes nikon lenses) are probably within budget used if you shop around carefully, if you don't mind something a little older then a camera like the nikon d100 is a step up to almost professional level.<br>  <br>  Good luck and i hope your enthusiasm continues.|`|pDcJGptPaa	Look at a used Canon rebel 300D . You should be able to get it used for around 300 euro with a nice 18-55 (which is really 29-88 with the crop factor) lens included. A great budget-oriented starting point.|`|qIR9DB9Haa	Well if your not going digital, there are a ton of great pro level film cameras that you can get for under $200. I bought a Canon EOS-1 for $130 from keh.com. The lenses for that camera need to be EF mount though, so they will be expensive. An even older camera but still a good on is the Canon AE-1 which was very popular. You can also get one of those from keh.com. keh is a reputable dealer that sells mostly used equipment. Try and get something EX grade or better. I dont know what there international shipping policy is. Your other option is to go to your local camera store. You really cant go wrong if you spend around $100 on a Canon or Nikon film camera. Try and get a 50mm lens as well.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	nikon D40<br>  go to kenrockwell.com<br>  to read about it
oEvHzaUPaa	short answer: speaker efficiency. Your ar's are less efficient with a watt of acoustical power than your fisher's, but are able to handle a higher wattage load. The efficiency of a speaker is rated in db/m (decibels of sound produced at one meter usually at 1 watt of acoustical power). The higher the db/m the louder the speaker will be per watt. But when you start turning up the volume, the fisher's will start to distort while the ar's will be just "hitting their stride".

I can plug my ipod into any computer on the face of the planet that has an itunes library and drag and drop any media from any library into my ipod without worrying about erasing the content of my ipod or syncing with the new library. I always have my ipods set to manually manage. That just gives you much more freedom like I said. If you want to set your ipod like this just plug it into itunes and click on it so you are looking at the screen that shows the picture of hte ipod and how much space you are using, then simply check the box that says manually manage and you'll be golden. If you are still using the version of itunes that came with your ipod that must be a really old version as ipods haven't actually come with a disk for a few years.. so you might want to try checking your itunes for updates... I'm only saying this b/c I know the screen I just mentioned above did show on older versions of itunes.
vIxqDKEtaa	Set your ipod/itunes to manually manage music.  When you add songs to the library - manually copy them to the ipod by double clicking the music menu under devices/ipod - a new window will open.  Then click on music at the top of itunes menu and drag and copy to the ipod window.  I know it is a pain, but I have an enormous library and when it freezes in the middle of a sync - it takes hours to reload.  This is the only way I have had consistency in adding and managing music.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!|`|AA10332688	go to best buy or circuit city or target and ask there <br>  you could also restore it

Ms3GUDs5aa	Unfortunately not, Brian, not quite sure what you were talking about, the 2G iTouch is different than the 3G iPhone, which has completely different firm/hardware.

They already jailbroke the iphone 2.2, even though it's not out yet.  But that doesn't mean squat for the touches with 2.1.1.  There's less need for a jailbreak now, because Apple released the developer kit, which means that anyone can make an app, within certain confines.  There is no shortage of great free apps in the itunes store.  The problem is, I hate itunes.<br>  <br>  The thing that bugs me most is the restriction on image sizes.  You can't get a hi-res image on there; itunes resizes it automatically to 480x320.  Or is it 640?  Anyway, I'd like to get a big subway map on there and zoom in on what I need.  I instead have to buy a subway map app.<br>  <br>  Apple sells you the hardware at a premium, then sells you access to it.  Very shady.

DirectX9 you should already have.<br>  <br>  but most likely your computer isn't powerful enough<br>  adding more RAM would be a good thing<br>  as well as possibly upgrading your graphics card<br>  depending on what speed your processor is, the above changes would help<br>  <br>  but without knowing what your computer already has, I can't tell you for sure

You should do ALL of the chores around the house. Clean your room, their room, the batroom, EVERYTHING. Also be very polite to your parents and everyone else. I say this will take about 4-5 weeks because it takes a long time for parents to notice what their children are doing. They are so distracted doing their parenting things. After you have been polite and done the chores EVERYDAY for 4-5 weeks ask your parents very politely to get you the phone. And if they ask you why say because you need one and you really deserve it. And that you have been doing the chores for the past 4 or 5 weeks. Trust me this will work. (also the best time to ask for the phone is during dinner and also do not forget that your parents have the privlige to take away the phone so i suggest being polite all the time and doing the chores ONCE in a WHILE.) Good Luck!|`|m2WscYQ5aa	I am your age .<br>  <br>  I am in 6th grade and i got my cell phone graduation of 5th grade.

This is how i said it to my parents "i am going to be going out alone , and im going to need a way to contact you to know i'm safe and alright , and i do not want to waste your minutes" be calm and just go with the flow .

Now, if it doesn't light, you can always remove the lamp and look at it...if it isn't Clear and shiny inside the lamp itself, it's probably blown.<br>  <br>  Call Mitsubishi with your old Lamp in hand...on the lamp you'll find a tag just by the handle...Look at the tag because it will have a lamp part number on it..191P20010 is an example.

If so you may have connected the red to an audio input on your tv instead of the video component input, double check the wiring, I use the tv's layout card for the back to verify the location of the the cable "ports". If you've used hdmi, if possible try another hdmi cable. Also check the tv's setup menu for a defaults setting and restore defaults.|`|Fg7r3A7Caa	ok common prob with panny tv. is the surround connected via scart? if so use your tv remote source button to alter scart input. the tv scart sockets can hanble an svhs signal which displays in black and white when going via scart. the tv source corresponds to the coloured buttons on the remote.when you are on the right input to see the picture from the surround press the button again to return to normal input. it will make more sense when you do this for real

RpCwfcRzaa	You can't bypass it. You have to have the game in the drive to verify that you own it.

pDcJGptPaa	It's always a leapfrog game between these two (Canon vs Nikon).<br>  I have been using both for many years and my experience tells that the Canon is more reliable. The Nikon image from the past is greatly overrated in todays world. Nikon is a smaller group of engineers and a bit more intimate whereas Canon has more of the "global conglomerate" nuance to it. But they are always neck and neck as far as image quality, which is ultimately what is all about. Certainly, when it comes to customer service Canon has the edge on Nikon.|`|AA10929465	Don't you mean Imax or Hasselbad?|`|04lKWhzCaa	nikon is the best. canon is ok but i have both and my nikon is going on 9 years now, no joke, the canon is long gone (malfunctioned) and nikon pic quality is superb. they kno what they're doing.
c3cP9F6haa	I just bought a Wii last weekend as well as Dead Rising, so I can't compare DR with similar titles.  Game is very enjoyable.  I like the story and voice-acting, but of course what sets this apart is the Wiimote.  Being surrounded by zombies, having to shake them off, and slashing at them with the Wiimote makes for a much more visceral experience than just bashing buttons.  Sound is also very immersive.  Can't play too long with a break: you're palms will sweat.<br>  <br>  Never played the 360 version, but I do have some quibbles.  You can't jump, and the layout of the mall has lots of obstructions that force you down narrow paths (where there are lots of zombies, of course).  It's irritating to be blocked by a "under construction" sign when you have tons of zombies at your back, or not being able to walk onto a ledge that is one foot above the ground.  I think this might be a way of created the "hordes of zombies coming at you" effect without there actually being that many around (I heard the 360 version had many more on-screen at any given time).  <br>  <br>  I hate the zombie parrots and dogs, since they are too hard to get a bead on them once they get close.  It shouldn't be hard to shoot a dog biting at your ankles, but it is in this game.  <br>  <br>  Finally, it's good you don't care about graphics (neither do I, really), because the graphics would not look out of place at the original Xbox.

8LyR0efpaa	The problem you describe with the movies may involve the movie soundtrack itself, since modern directors often don't have the brains of a stone, and end up not caring whether or not people can hear the dialog.  Be sure every movie you watch, even those from the 50's and 60's (when sound engineers knew what they were doing) sounds the same.  If so, then there is a problem.  The music DVDs definitely should sound better than you describe, and while it could be your player, it probably isn't.  TV speakers wear out or go bad, so you might think about adding a moderately priced surround system and play the sound through it instead of the internal TV speakers.|`|26c3882c8862fb989b196c0d5e86733aaa	Would help to know if you are watching the same sources as your father did, on that TV.<br>  <br>  Maybe he was using it to watch offair programmes via antenna or cable, and your source equipment (DVD) or the connection is at fault?|`|AjPbtm7oaa	Blow up your TV, throw away your paper<br>  Go to the country, build you a home<br>  Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches<br>  Try an find Jesus on your own

M7i30zP6aa	Nintendo does not offer and allow downloadable content unless it is done through their system, so in another word, there is no legally wii game download services out there.  If you make any copy of the game it's consider copyright violation unless you own the game.|`|oZqoxgc7aa	It is Perfectly legal to download and play homebrew.<br>  Hacking Wii by putting homebrew channel on it is the best route for that, Go to Wiibrew.org and check out the 100% legal downloads, there is always the fact that you will find more illegal downloads than legal ones, not that the downloads are necessarily illegal, but most content you'll find is going to be roms for older consoles and emulators to play them with. This is only legal if you own the original game. <br>  When it comes to the reasonable pricing, you can't get more reasonable than FREE.<br>  For some great pay-per-download content, check out wiiware. LIT is phenomenal.<br>  Also, I would only recommend soft-modding on Wii. Too many Wii butchers turning out bricks after installing mod chips.|`|hTieELhTaa	umm what about the wii shop channel where you pay per download?

Mewtwo would be my pick. Even though he's the most broken pokemon in the game.<br>  <br>  Or you could keep your team the way it is and make the 6th pokemon zapdos, the most broken electric type in the game. It's flying so ground types can't effect it and it's electric so electric types can't do as much damage to it as other flying types.<br>  <br>  as for my team:<br>  1. Blastoise (Thrown in blizzard and earthquake in his moveset to counter grass and electric pokemon. Although Swampert is an overall better pick cause he's also a ground type)<br>  2. Magnezone<br>  3. Pigeot<br>  4. Dragonite (Dragon types FTW)<br>  5. Ryperior<br>  6. Metagross<br>  <br>  You may notice I have some kind of affinity for the 1st generation.

So he'll be good.<br>  Staraptor is decent and since it's a flying type, okay.<br>  Garchomp is okay too.<br>  Blaziken is awesome.<br>  Swampert is awesome too.<br>  And the 6th may not have to be a legendary, maybe Metagross, but also maybe not. Maybe it could be just a regular Pokemon. Not a starter, not a legendary, just normal. Any one is fine.

s9d8I0Uaaa	yes you can download half life 1 and probably 2. i know fo sure you can with half life 1 because its a little older. but the episodes mean it is parts of the game. and it says dvd because it can be burned onto a dvd disc. but you can buy it online at amazon.com or maybe target or walmart. or just go steam.com, download the steam client, and while in the client, you can download it straight from your computer. hope this helped. its like 10 bucks. just buy it. it is a good game.|`|vU2SQu2jaa	Half life is a game. Those episodes you're referring to is different parts of the game. <br>  <br>  No you can not download the game for free. You should purchase the game like millions of others. It's not that expensive anyway.|`|5GwRMfXyaa	<a href="http://thecompletewebs.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://thecompletewebs.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  GOTO THIS SITE, its gives u free 3gp vids, COMPRESSED PC FULL GAMES,SOFTWARES.... & MANY MORE.<br>  ITS GR8 BELIEVE ME!!I'VE TESTED IT!!!<br>  if ur game is not in the list demand it in chat box it'll be POSTED WITHIN 24 HRS!!!

qWicVoU9aa	You should return it to O2.  How would you feel if you had bought it and lost it?  Wouldn't you hope the person that found it would be honest?  Do the right thing and turn it in.  It has more than likely already been reported as lost or stolen and if you try and activate it they will know it and you could be charged with being in the possession of stolen merchandise.|`|av3vmWSHaa	return it to o2 and  you will be reward a new iphone very soon<br>  you are honest guy|`|AA11256390	Keeping it may seem all well and good but the likely hood is, O2 will inevitably block it soon enough when someone reports it as lost so any credit you put on the phone to use it will be lost and the phone will be unusable to anyone so you might as well return it to the shop.|`|rG1q4SPFaa	keep it, its not stealing...finders keepers :p<br>  <br>  lol naa seriously, 02/apple have tonss of money it is not going to make a difference to them at all, if u has saw som1 drop it then u shud giv it bak to the owner, but if it is from the shop and dnt belong to a specific person keep it!!|`|Q4NFFBizaa	go to your local AT&T store and return it.

Your answer to this will let you know if you should return the phone.

A pay and go sim card won't allow you unlimited Internet access. Plus honesty is the best policy.
6Vaaqle0aa	Okay, first of all, many Nokia N95 cases on the back, break anyway. This is due to an error in the phone itself from earlier models, and many of these phones work in perfect condition, except sticky tape is needed to hold it together.<br>  <br>  But due to the fact it is unknown whether it is unlocked or not, you need to make sure it is the right price. The phone should cost around ￡90 brand new or something close. So, due to the unlocking uncertainty and the fact there is no packaging and it is second hand. Anywhere between ￡50-￡60 is a suitable offer.<br>  <br>  Covers that can replace the broken cover can be bought, but I would suggest one made of a stronger material or a rubber casing to hold the back on without the need for sticky tape. These can be bought from any mobile shop and any online accessories shop.|`|XPjNJ6gkaa	if u repaired it u cud sell it for ￡70|`|d02gJC1aaa	the clips breaking on the battery cover is a common problem but you can get a new one on ebay for about ￡3<br>  <br>  <a href="http://shop.ebay.co.uk/?_from=R40&_trksid=m38.l1313&_nkw=nokia+n95+plum&_sacat=See-All-Categories" rel="nofollow">http://shop.ebay.co.uk/?_from=R40&_trksi...</a><br>  <br>  i had an n95 for a year, and i broke the cover twice.<br>  <br>  <br>  it is a really good phone.  you dont say how much he wants for it.  you can sell this phone for ￡95 at envirophone.<br>  <br>  what does he want for it?|`|x3o7cO7uaa	yea

My Toshiba was set to "cable" tuning right out of the box.  If this is set incorrectly, your set will miss anything on channels 14 and up.  If you change this setting, remember to rescan for channels.

aaMo4KIsaa	Sounds like back light bleeding to me. LCD is back lit from behind (commonly a CCFL) by a light source  and the LCD blocks out the light that is not needed. Back light bleeding occurs when this light is not 100% blocked allowing some light to "bleed" through the LCD causing spots of lighter areas on a dark or black background. Unfortunately, almost all LCDs suffer at least a small amount of back light bleed because the opacity of LCD panels is not enough to block all light. Some more than others, and if this is the case, there is nothing you can do about it. If your TV is still under warranty get on the phone. If no, get on the phone anyway. You should get a replacement if your persistent<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  JS|`|kXF6JBFLaa	There should be a "Backlight" control on your LCD TV. Turn down the backlight to reduce the "white glare."

3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	If you have a mini dv (cassette) camcorder….<br>  Your dv camcorder needs a firewire connection (ieee 1394) in order to download video, your PC probably did not come with a firewire port, so you will have to buy one and install it, since most computers (except possibly brand new) don't come with a firewire port, your camcorder did not come with a firewire cord so you have to purchase a cord too. Your camcorder did come with a USB cord and that is used for downloading stills from your camcorder. Make sure your camera is in playback mode.<br>  The fine print in your manual makes reference to firewire (ieee 1394) connection.|`|b6e0dc8ffe2b0db9a1e3d82efa351d40aa	You'll need to capture the video via firewire rather than USB - if your PC hasn't already got one you'll need to install a firewire card. They're cheap, easy to install and readily available. You'll also need a firewire cable.
AA10775666	Ok so the firmware on your phone isn't correctly installed, try re-updating the phone and that will fix the problem and if you can;t do that then just take your phone to T-Mobile and they will fix the problem. Hope this helps.

WAgePXHHaa	This is solely my opinion, but of the BlackBerry devices I've used, the Curve 8330 (Verizon) is the absolute best.  I haven't tried the Bold (AT&T), so I can't compare that one.  I just recently upgraded to the Storm, and I'm about ready to go back to my Curve.  The Storm has the potential to be a great phone, but it's just not there yet.  Prior to the Curve, I had the Pearl, which is also a great phone, just smaller.
