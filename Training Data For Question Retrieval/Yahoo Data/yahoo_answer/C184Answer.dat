tGViJVLMaa	I don't know how to answer your question other than relating it to my personal experiences. When I was younger my step dad was abusive but he believed he was just disciplining his kids. One time I remember he hit me so hard I fell down the stairs, he ran down ( I thought to help me up ) but just continued beating me on my back...I'll never forget that day. Anytime I would see him try to hit me I would run, now is that normal? No, I've decided. We were never spanked so I wouldn't know what  a spanking is, just hitting. Hitting with anything possible, I think most of the time it was impulsive. He never said okay you are now about to receive a spanking for something you did wrong. It was run and try to catch me. I don't think it made me abusive though, I have never been in a fight in my life. I don't think I'll hit my children either, just made me resent him.|`|prqrQcd1aa	It has to do with others thoughts that this will harm the child in some way..it also has to deal with the whole.."everyone needs a trophy" and the "new age parenting" thing that some people choose to do. I myself..and i didn't put this in my last answer.. I will give a quick swat on the butt if something is major. It's used as a last resort type of thing. My 7 year old was spanked once  for running out into the road, she never did it again. I don't condone spanking and I don't condemn it either. I think it should be used as a last resort type of thing, or in situations where you need the child's attention NOW!|`|rpsXPdFmaa	I guess some people see it as hitting.  And hitting is bad.  My dad never had to swat at us more than once, except one time when he tore my brother up.  And we're fine, non abusive parents.  His little girls are only a year old and my daughter I never had to do more than a time out.<br>  <br>  I guess there's some parents who were spanked, too, growing up and feel it was abusive and refuse to do it.<br>  <br>  Edit: Hmm, I wouldn't find that S&M tendancy to be true.  While yes I do prefer being tied up and dominated my dad never hit me hard enough to arouse anything.  As far as I know my brother and sister are not into that at all.  Either way though my sexual life style doesn't hurt anyone, except me.<br>  <br>  Oh, I did think of something else.  When my sister and I went through puberty my dad stopped spanking us.  Even though he was a light swatter there was the worry that my mother mainly had of him hitting us and messing up our periods.  I'm not sure if it's possible to hit a girl so hard to mess up her periods but that concern was always there for her.|`|ukR7LwjCaa	native texan doesnt know what a clan is ..guess she stepped in beaver sh*t and thinks she is an Indian now. No youre just a white xtain pig who needs to circle her wagons. Anyone who revels in their need for validation for beating her kid and finds unity in that ,,is a mental case. Get a tan you ugly fuqing dog|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	I will noT SPANK MY KID FOR ANYTHINg but if he would ever brings drugs in the house i would spank him i dont care what age he is|`|ANHsv4ENaa	If hitting my spouse is assault then hitting my child is assault also. I don't think the rules or inappropriateness of it change just because I'm bigger than my child. If my husband spanked me for not having dinner ready or for mouthing off to him people would be outraged. It's not ok to hit adults, it is not any more acceptable to hit a child. Hitting anyone is a form of abuse. Not just physical abuse but emotional abuse. Imo. I won't call cps because you spank as long as you aren't excessive but I will do all I can to change the fact that it is seen as alright. I just don't think it is.<br>  EDIT***<br>  Holy cow Native W. What on earth is your problem? Did you forget your meds today cuz your psycho is showing.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	My guess is how do you tell the difference. Who's going to have the final say as to its abuse or a spanking. Where's the line? I have heard if you don't leave marks. I know how to break bones without leaving a mark. Shaken baby doesn't leave marks unless you can see it in the eyes and that doesn't always happen. Why would you want to introduce possible damage when there is so many other options out there. I don't know  if a couple of swats on their butt is abuse or not, but I wouldn't want to risk it. I don't spank. I was scared of my temper before my son was born and decided to find other ways. Over time I have come to realize there is no need to spank.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	spanking can be abusive. there is a specturm of spanking between your different examples. there are swats on unclothed bottoms, with a hand or other instrument such as a wooden spoon or belt or switch. all of which i believe are abusive.<br>  <br>  plus i think it's demoralizing, humiliating, & dehumanizing. it doesn't have to leave a physical mark to leave an emotional scar.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I agree that there is a huge huge difference. I feel that once you've tried everything else if a spanking on a clothed bottom will the the message across then do it by all means. As long as it's not leaving a mark and you are not hitting your child for every little thing then you are fine.|`|1s3nddaYaa	i think if it doesn't cause damage, as in bruising or pushing someone into things or breaking something. its not abuse<br>  <br>  so im fine with spanking my child. i dont right now, i do smack his hand however, raising my voice and taking him away from the situation and distracting him does not work at a ll<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  edit: you have a stalker hun|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	because of zealots.  the same type of people who lump anyone who doesn't spank as a bad parent w/little hellions for kids
CVdcrY3kaa	It's very normal for your breasts to eventually feel empty. She may just be needing a little more comfort than usual, or maybe a small growth spurt - hard to tell. It's normal though, nothing to be worried about.|`|T0gv52CDaa	As your body adjusts to her feeding needs, they stop getting hard and engorged because they are producing just slightly more than she is eating.  If she isn't turning away and crying as she tries to nurse, she is getting milk.  You wont feel full today if she continues to eat that much.  4 months is a normal growth spurt time, so that may be it.|`|MUVdG9n1aa	My boobs have felt very empty to me lately (my son is just four months) and he wants to nurse constantly. The other day we went to see a show and were gone six hours. My boobs filled up like stripper boobs and leaked all over so I know the milk is there. I think he's having a growth spurt... this is what it sounds like is happening with your daughter. Don't stop yet, unless she starts losing weight and stops peeing and pooping you're good. :)|`|GqsLNUE8aa	They end up feeling empty all the time ~ until you have that "let down" feeling that eventually only happens during a feeding.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/low-supply.html#supply" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/low-su...</a><br>  Is your milk supply really low?<br>  <br>  First of all, is your milk supply really low? Often, mothers think that their milk supply is low when it really isn't. If your baby is gaining weight well on breastmilk alone, then you do not have a problem with milk supply.<br>  It's important to note that the feel of the breast, the behavior of your baby, the frequency of nursing, the sensation of let-down, or the amount you pump are not valid ways to determine if you have enough milk for your baby.<br>  <br>  What if you're not quite sure about baby's current weight gain (perhaps baby hasn't had a weight check lately)? If baby is having an adequate number of wet and dirty diapers then the following things do NOT mean that you have a low milk supply:<br>  <br>      * Your baby nurses frequently. Breastmilk is digested quickly (usually in 1.5-2 hours), so breastfed babies need to eat more often than formula-fed babies. Many babies have a strong need to suck. Also, babies often need continuous contact with mom in order to feel secure. All these things are normal, and you cannot spoil your baby by meeting these needs.<br>      * Your baby suddenly increases the frequency and/or length of nursings. This is often a growth spurt. The baby nurses more (this usually lasts a few days to a week), which increases your milk supply. Don't offer baby supplements when this happens: supplementing will inform your body that the baby doesn't need the extra milk, and your supply will drop.<br>      * Your baby nurses more often and is fussy in the evening.<br>      * Your baby doesn't nurse as long as she did previously. As babies get older and better at nursing, they become more efficient at extracting milk.<br>      * Your baby is fussy. Many babies have a fussy time of day - often in the evening. Some babies are fussy much of the time. This can have many reasons, and sometimes the fussiness goes away before you find the reason.<br>      * Your baby guzzles down a bottle of formula or expressed milk after nursing. Many babies will willingly take a bottle even after they have a full feeding at the breast. Read more here from board-certified lactation consultant Kathy Kuhn about why baby may do this and how this can affect milk supply. Of course, if you regularly supplement baby after nursing, your milk supply will drop (see below).<br>      * Your breasts don't leak milk, or only leak a little, or stop leaking. Leaking has nothing to do with your milk supply. It often stops after your milk supply has adjusted to your baby's needs.<br>      * Your breasts suddenly seem softer. Again, this normally happens after your milk supply has adjusted to your baby's needs.<br>      * You never feel a let-down sensation, or it doesn't seem as strong as before. Some women never feel a let-down. This has nothing to do with milk supply.<br>      * You get very little or no milk when you pump. The amount of milk that you can pump is not an accurate measure of your milk supply. A baby with a healthy suck milks your breast much more efficiently than any pump. Also, pumping is an acquired skill (different than nursing), and can be very dependent on the type of pump. Some women who have abundant milk supplies are unable to get any milk when they pump. In addition, it is very common and normal for pumping output to decrease over time. <br>  <br>  See also Is my baby getting enough milk?<br>  <br>  Who to contact if you suspect low milk supply<br>  <br>  If you're concerned about your milk supply, it will be very helpful to get in touch with a La Leche League Leader or a board certified lactation consultant. If your baby is not gaining weight or is losing weight, you need to keep in close contact with her doctor, since it's possible that a medical condition can cause this. Supplementing may be medically necessary for babies who are losing weight until your milk supply increases. If supplementing is medically necessary, the best thing to supplement your baby with is your own pumped milk. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/distractible-baby.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/dis...</a><br>  Is my baby distractible?<br>  <br>  Latch on, suck a moment, pull off... latch on, suck a moment, pull off. Nurse a minute, pull away to smile at mom. Nurse a minute, pull away to see who just walked in the room. Nurse a minute, pull away to listen to the TV. Nurse a moment, pull away because the dog wagged his tail.<br>  <br>  Sound familiar?? Baby starts to nurse and just as soon as your milk starts to let-down, baby pulls off and wiggles around in your lap. Babies aged two to six months are notorious for pulling off the breast at any distraction (real or imaginary) and tend to forget to let go before they turn around (ouch!).<br>  <br>  This is a passing developmental stage that can be quite a nuisance - it's usually at it's worst between four and five months. At around 2 months, your baby will become able to see things clearly across the room. At around 3 months, he'll start to stay awake longer and take a greater interest in the world around him. Your baby is also beginning to recognize that he is separate from mom. All of these things can result in a distractible baby. When baby first becomes aware of the rest of the world, he will have a hard time concentrating on nursing. In effect, he will be unable to "walk and chew gum at the same time." Once he gets a little older, he'll find it easier to both nurse and take in the world around him at the same time.<br>  <br>  Distractibility is also common around 8-10 months, and can lead mom to think that her baby is trying to wean. If your baby is younger than a year, it's highly unlikely that this temporary disinterest is self-weaning. It's very rare for a baby younger than 12 months to self-wean.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.todaysparent.com/article.jsp?content=1266685" rel="nofollow">http://www.todaysparent.com/article.jsp?...</a><br>  When four-month-old Connor started nursing every 15 minutes — day and night — his mother, Corrie Quinlan, started to despair. “Is there a problem with my milk supply?” she wondered. But Connor’s plentiful wet and poopy diapers soon put that worry to rest. So what, exactly, was wrong with her infant? <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>   Wiessinger believes that counting and timing feedings may only make a nursing mother feel more stressed about what she thinks she needs to accomplish during the day. The reality, however, might actually be quite different since, as Wiessinger points out, frequent feedings tend to be short and easy to fit around other activities.<br>  <br>  Anthropologist Kathy Dettwyler from Texas A&M University says that nursing a lot is typical of babies around the world. She cites a study done in 2000 that looked at the feeding behaviour of infants aged three to four months in three different communities: families from Washington, DC, the Ba’Aka hunter-gatherers and the Ngandu farmers, both of the Central African Republic. They found that the Ba’Aka babies nursed 4.02 times per hour, the Ngandu babies nursed 2.01 times per hour and the American babies nursed 1.6 times per hour. Certainly the American babies nursed less often than the two African groups, but they nursed more frequently than many new parents expect. <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  To try to decrease feedings, Quinlan tried breast compression with Connor, but he cried and let go of the breast when he got the extra gush of milk. That clearly wasn’t the problem. Further investigation revealed that he was teething a bit earlier than average, and was nursing to soothe his sore gums. Once the tooth popped through, his every-15-minute sessions slowed down.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	sounds like it is a growth spurt- the way tehy feel don't mena a thing- they can feel soft but still have milk. i can't tell you the last time my breast felt like they had milk in them and i've been nursing for almost 23 months. sometimes they just like to suck for comfort
4ZnrBThaaa	Norwalk Hopsital is one of the best ones if you are in that area. Also, New Haven Hospital near Yale is also good. I know many people who have hads their babies in both and had WONDERFUL experiences. Best of luck! Also know, you have some time to pick the RIGHT doctor and pratice for you. Go to a few or to a practice that has several doctrs and interview/be seen by them. You will know who you like this way better then someone telling you!|`|PeoQzYyXaa	stamford hospital is one of the best, i had my first and now i will have my 2nd there|`|cSz705Suaa	My daughter was born in Norwalk Hospital, which was great.

T0gv52CDaa	There are medicines that are meant for lactation assistance, but they are primarily used to increase lactation in women who aren't producing enough for their biological infants.  The longer it has been since you last breast fed, the less likely are are to successfully restart lactation.  4 years is a really long time.  Do you have friends who are currently nursing who would be willing to pump and donate their extra milk to help your son?  Blood type doesn't matter at all.|`|8DnIXwnyaa	I would see a lactation consultant.  they will be able to offer the best advice.  Also, I think it takes a little time to get it going.  Can you get some from a milk bank to use until then?|`|JXHy2EHQaa	Depending on what country you are in, you can get domperidone by prescription.  You can also take Reglan, but it has some nasty side effects.<br>  You'll need a breastpump (cheap would probably be fine to start with).  Pump for 5 minutes, both sides, every 2-3 hours to start with.  Some people find it's better to do 5 minutes, rest for 15, pump for 5, as it's the 'latching on' that stimulates the hormones.<br>  Also, try fenugreek and blessed thistle.  You take 9 capsules of each, per day.  I line them up on the counter and take one pill every hour (18 hours in my day, LOL).  Eat lots of oatmeal once you start to produce, and take flaxseed supplements.<br>  You really should do this all in conjunction with a lactation consultant or doctor (most doctors know zilch about bf. though).  Check out www.kellymom.com and Dr Jack Newman's sites for more info on re-lactating.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	Plenty of adoptive moms choose to lactate without ever having given birth, but your situation is much more important. There is a prescription, reglan, that your doctor can give you. Fenugreek is a supplement that is also supposed to help. You would need to pump almost round the clock every 2-3 hours morning and night and you may only get a few ounces even after weeks. Do you have anyone who would be willing to donate their milk to you? How about buying some from a milk bank. Good luck|`|MUVdG9n1aa	Blood type doesn't matter with nursing. I still had milk in my breasts before getting pregnant with my youngest son- five years after I weaned my middle son! Maybe just start pumping- also try and find some mother's milk tea, you can find it at health food stores (Whole Foods Market or Trader Joe's) or in the natural foods dept of many food chains... or order it online if you are very rural. i wish you the best of luck|`|AA11537580	you should be able to get something(hormones) from your doctor to help you start producing milk|`|lnsOJ3GBaa	Its possible for you to nurse your baby adopted or not.

G2auAv1Saa	If you don't want him wearing them anymore... stop buying them seems like the obvious suggestion.<br>   But if he is having a bed-wetting problem it won't solve the problem.

I was a bed wetter past age 15 and I wore the disposable tape on diapers to bed.  If he doesn't mind wearing the diapers then let it be.  He will grow out of the bed wetting stage, I know I did.  If you stopped buying him the diapers then to me that's worse because he will be waking up in wet nasty bedding and pajamas.  I have a 4 yr old that I put in diapers every night so I know your frustrations but also as a bed wetter myself its better to have a diaper on at night.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	I am assuming he no longer wets the bed....<br>  <br>  A bribe will work if you stick to it...also called positive reinforcement. Find something he really wants, it doesn't have to be a thing, it can be special time with mom, and bribe him. Tell him that if you don't wear the goodnites, I will do so and so, or get you such and such. Whatever you feel is appropriate for a reward. It should be something that you can do each time he sleeps without the underpants, and you have to be able to follow through every time.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Stop ALL liquids 3 hours before bed time.

When he pitches a 'fit' - completely ignore him and walk away out of his sight.

Work with him on these and make him repeat (plainly and clearly) what he sees.

It may take a while and your husband might go bonkers first, but eventually your son will learn.  My 3 yr old daughter still tries to play me by throwing a fit and bringing up some fake tears, but she know that daddy doesn't play games and I know her well enough to know when she's doing it to get her way.|`|hc1fsgDWaa	He seems to be testing you to see who is the boss.  He probably wants to see where his limits are and how far he can push you before you give in to his demands.  You should set his limits for him so he has a clear idea of what is and is not accepted in your house.  I would ignore any tantrums and sooner or later he will cry himself to sleep or just settle down when he sees that it is not getting him what he wants.  I would never give in to him screaming or demanding  or he will keep it up.  It is a very hard thing to do as a parent but if you don't let him understand the rules now it will only get harder as he gets older.  <br>  As far as the diaper changing, you should try to make a game out of it somehow instead of it being a battle and then he will eventually associate being tickled or having fun with the changing.  Re-direction in usually the name of the game with a baby that age even though it is very tiring sometimes.<br>  Good Luck  - it will all work out!|`|vCq3dR40aa	Count 1, 2, 3 using wait for its as required and then give him some sort of treat, hug, swing around . . . Then use the same counting for other times when he has to wait for a few seconds.  It does help by stopping them from working up to the tantrum.<br>  <br>  It won't stop his tantrums, but it might help.  Teach him sign language.  Especially the feelings ones.  Sometimes if you acknowledge the feeling, some of the anger melts away.  For the rest of it, I agree with ignoring his fits.  I think it is OK to do a very short time out followed by hugs and kisses after the storm has passed.  <br>  <br>  My 19 month old daughter gets the picture if I drop her in her crib when she is starting to run from one bad thing to another.  Sometimes she just lays down because the root cause was she was tired.
MY12veP5aa	Jennifer Amelia Morgan  - love both names seperately and they do sound ok together, but as both end in the same 'a' sound, which doesn't go that great, I'd give it 6/10<br>  <br>  Jennifer Coraline Morgan (core-ah-line) - Really like this, don't know why but Coraline sounds really pretty in there with Jennifer - 9/10<br>  <br>  Jennifer Evelyn Morgan - I like this too, have always been a fan of Evelyn. Maybe a few too many 'e's here? 7/10<br>  <br>  Jennifer Isobel Morgan - not keen on Isobel, but i think they do sound nice together - so 7/10<br>  <br>  Jennifer Madeleine Morgan (mah-deh-leen) - Really don't like Madeleine, always mispronounced and mispelt, also far too many 'e's in this name!! - 5/10<br>  <br>  Jennifer Rosalind Morgan - like this, sounds very pretty together. Might opt for the spelling Rosalyn, I just think it look neater. Either way, 8/10<br>  <br>  Fave = Jennifer Coraline Morgan|`|K45xwCxoaa	Jennifer Amelia Morgan, it is nice, madeline one is nice too. but amelia is very nice. By the way Amelia mean hard working and beloved of the Lord.|`|WuOTVge5aa	First: 1<br>  2nd: 2<br>  3rd: 4<br>  4th: 5<br>  5th: 3<br>  6th: 6<br>  <br>  I like the old fashioned middle names, but Jennifer doesn't seem quite along the lines of what you've got going in the middle name. First is def. my favorite. It has great flow and imparts a certain brightness and sunshine. Good luck!|`|p1yIVINraa	Jenifer Madeleine Morgan is the best to me, though since you have so many great second names, why are you sticking solely to Jennifer as the first name?|`|radg7M8maa	i really like the amelia and evelyn =)<br>  i grew up with a beautiful girl named amelia and i loved that name ever since!
Wn0Hj7H4aa	Probably a way back home ( the womb)|`|2eae4bf1e3779c435068e2d7d68a747faa	My baby is 5 weeks and 3 days and he still stares at the lights. He stares at any and I mean ANY and ALL sources of light. The moonlight, sunlight, the little light from phone, the light outside of the house,etc. <br>  Sometimes it can be the people talking around him. Mines is so nosy that he turns to each person he hears talking.|`|pAih5juAaa	They can only see about 30 cm (about the distance from breast to mother's face) so I'm guessing faces especially Mum|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	I have this book, It a white book with black silhouettes, and that's all, the contrast is so great that it's easy for even the youngest babies to see. Other than that, mommy's boobs, and mommy's face. <br>  <br>  A couple hours after birth, I would go easy on the bright lights, they've been in the dark for 9 months, and their eyes are still sensitive. <br>  <br>  Generally, newborns don't focus on anything for more than a few seconds though, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.|`|J4YNRrsuaa	They usually sleep for many many hours like 30 min after their born. Bright lights will hurt their eyes. A few days later they like to seee black & white pictures.|`|OhuWMW9Gaa	Their parents faces...they quickly grow fond of looking at anything circular too (like faces).|`|Ozqao18Raa	they usually are sleeping a couple of hours after birth they can not clearly see things yet, they can only see blobby figures. they will not look at bright light because their eyes are adjusting to seeing light.|`|xFkVlZBLaa	all young babies have poor vision in the beginning which become normal after some months so the things around appears very blurry to them that's why they see every thing with their full amusement so as to recognizance them.
3p0QBNpwaa	I felt the same way when I seen my baby for the first time! He/She to was moving around alot! That was the second it all seemed real for me!|`|JlxSw7Hzaa	i couldnt stop smiling when i seen her move for the first time on the ultrasound. its so amazing what we as women can do , dont u think? my daughter was bouncing up and down at 11 weeks and 3 days and looked like a tiny miniture version of what she was going to become. i absolutely loved it . i annoyed my boyfriend with talking about the baby all the way until the next ultrasound|`|JQcIwPXJaa	I cry every time! Which for my first was a lot! I had scans done every two weeks because they couldn't get a heart beat with a doppler. It is just so amazing....the whole process! Congrats!|`|a9ad5fb472d76ac52689ca11de1f2cc4aa	I did my first u/s around 12 weeks and up until then I knew I was pregnant but couldn't quite believe that there was a human being in me.  I was pretty sick in my first trimester and it was easier for me to believe I had the flu or a parasite than to think I had a baby inside me.  But when I saw the u/s sound I was just blown away.  It seemed so unreal but yet it was.  <br>  <br>  My friend just gave birth to a 7lbs, 7oz baby boy and I still can't seem to believe a baby can live inside someone.  I have only 9 more weeks to go and I know I will be so blown away when I see my baby.  I feel him move everyday but I just don't see how something so wonderful like that can come from someone so simple like me.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	I am 11 weeks, 2 days and I have an ultrasound next thursday when I'll be 12 weeks, 1 day and I'm so excited about it!!! I can't wait to see my baby up there on that screen! From what I hear it really looks like a human baby at this point which is just CRAZY to think that there's a little tiny human in me!!!! I hear that they move around on the ultrasound which is somethign I am DYING to see!<br>  <br>  Congratulations!|`|5ZvALiclaa	I cried each and every time and I've had a total of 11 ultrasounds now so thats a lot of happy tears!<br>  <br>  congrats on the baby, it truly is a miracle and a extradinary feeling to see your little baby inside you|`|ZnwKjH6waa	awww thats awesome!!!! i go 4 my 1st doc appt 2day... n they told me they mite do a vaginal ultrasound b/c im only 5w5d... but they said i mite b able 2 see the heart beat if i cant hear it... im soooo excited!!! i wanna c my lil peanuts heartbeat!!!!  :o)
LQISGYbEaa	I think that in most cases it is the safest place to give birth. Prenatal screenings are absolutely essential to determine the women and fetuses that are in the higher risk categories, but the percentage of pregnancies that are high risk is much smaller than most people would think. Being admitted to a hospital exposes you and your new baby to all kinds of germs. It also causes the chance of medical interventions, such as major abdominal surgery, to increase to astronomical proportions. Countries that have a midwife and homebirth based system of care for pregnant women have much lower neonatal and maternal death rates. For the majority of pregnancies a homebirth with an experienced midwife is best.<br>  My personal experiences of giving birth to two boys at home were the most amazing and wonderful moments of my life. It was personal, loving, and filled with laughter. My midwife had almost 30 years of experience and there is no way anyone could tell me that a doctor would have been more qualified to deliver babies.<br>  I could give you a lot of percentages and study results but I truly think that if you currently are or want to be, or if you know someone who is pregnant, you need to research all of the numbers and facts yourself. You owe it to your baby to be well informed and to not let misguided and ignorant opinions to sway your beliefs on childbirth.|`|qMYbGqiwaa	I would not be comfotable with a home birth.  I just feel the need for a doctor to be there and to be monitored incase something goes wrong.  That being said, my best friend is a midwife who does home deliveries and I can tell you that she would only have her babies at home and assures me that it is safe and that they are fully trained to know when something is going wrong, ect...  That did not make me comfortable enough to allow her to deliver my kids though.  It works for some people and others can't even imagine giving birth at home, it's whatever works best for you.  If you are interested in it I suggest you watch "The business of being born" you will get VERY educated on home births by watching the video (I still was not convinced though!)|`|aJLx0nhNaa	It's certainly not right for every one, but I have a lot of respect for the women who choose it.|`|yB5go5wbaa	I support those who want to do it and I'd love to have one.  I live 45 minutes away from a hospital though, and to me that's too far to travel if something were to go wrong.  I know people in my town who have done it though. I think what's appealing to me about a home birth is the absence of doctors and the support that comes with a doula/midwife.  I didn't like the doctor that delivered my baby because he kept pushing me to have an epidural that I didn't want.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I do not support it and this is why.  When I was pregnant with my son I had no complications during the pregnancy and everything was fine.  I am a tall woman with a large frame and assumed that I would have an easy vaginal birth.  I chose to give birth in the hospital just in case something went wrong.  I had a very easy labor but ended up pushing for 4 and 1/2 hours because my son was stuck.  His heart rate dropped and they used forceps to get him out.  The cord was wrapped around his neck 2 and 1/2 times.  He spent his first day of life in the nicu.  I was so thankful that I was in a hospital setting where they could take care of me and my son.  I had a 4th degree tear and luckily I had a great doctor who took the next hour sewing me up and making it was right.  100 stitches later I was good as new and my baby was safe.  I hate to think of what may have happened if we were not in the hospital.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I think it's okay if that's your choice. Some people do it because the cost is so much less. I wouldn't do it because I feel more comfortable in the hospital in case something happens.|`|T48smu01aa	I think its a great idea if you have medical help by you side :) other than that no i don't agree with it its too risky if no one medically is by your side.|`|hWc65sEtaa	The only thing I would be concerned with is if there would be any complications.|`|dCLnLlsCaa	I 100% support it!  My mother in law had all 7 of her children at home.   If you actually look at the statistics, there are WAY fewer complications at home than in a hospital.  Plus all midwives support the idea of working with a hospital in the rare case there is an emergency.  Remember, we are women and our bodies were made to give birth.  Being pregnant and giving birth is not a sickness, unfortunately that's how most doctors look at it though.  <br>  In the Netherlands for example, 35% of women still give birth at home.  Look up their infant mortality rate compared to the USA's (less than 1% of babies are born at home in USA).<br>  For me, I wanted a home birth but my insurance covers none of it.  So I found a hospital that supports natural childbirth and I'm getting a doula.  I believe every woman should choose to labor and deliver how she would feel most comfortable!|`|7273c2f9619f41237bda5553ffcdd9ddaa	I am due in two weeks with my first child.  I am having a home water birth. So, yes I agree with it.  I was leery at first because what if something goes wrong?  Well, I met with a midwife who has done several water and home births including three of her own.  I have complete trust in her.  I think it is important to have that trust in something who is going to help you deliver your child.  She has only ever had to take one mom to the hospital and that was the mom's choice.  She doesn't have all of the high tech things that the hospital has, but what the hospital doesn't have is her compassion.  We live not even 5 minutes from the hospital.  <br>  <br>  There is a movie/documentary I watched called The Business of Being Born.  It is a movie based on home/water birth.  It is pretty against hospitals, but nonetheless an interesting perspective and movie.  It has statistics that I never would have guessed to be true.  <br>  <br>  The common question that I have been asked is "Are you having him natural or c-section?"  I tell them I am having a home water birth and they think I am nuts.  I have gotten used to that by now.  Everyone else thinks it is neat because they have seen it on television.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion, some may not agree with me.|`|jBdvUQEXaa	I wouldnt choose it personally. I would worry too much that somthing might go wrong and I couldnt get to the hospital in time.  Having said that, millions of women have had home births, and babys have been known to die in hospitals.<br>  <br>  To be frank the clincher for me is the mess! I had DD3 in hospital had a lovely long shower whilst the fantastic MW cleaned the room up, spent the first night with her in their bed and came home the next day - far better!<br>  <br>  Claire|`|yPNvecc7aa	While I think there would be nothing better than to be in labour in my own home, in my own bed, surrounded by my own stuff, I would hate to think of the consequences if something went wrong.<br>  <br>  Most doctors don't recommend home births for this reason and I agree.|`|5RvTXdmUaa	I dont think its a bad idea. Just make sure you're prepared if anything happens. And have a mid-wife there, of course. I think it's something I would be interested in doing possibly.|`|rAD0mL7Saa	only way. a lot less painless and a lot safer for your baby and a lot better. my experiences are at <a href="http://www.philsdomain.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.philsdomain.net</a> I would never, ever give birth out of water ever again, and I've got the best midwife out.certifiably so.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	About on a par with natural home surgery. It can work, but why the hell would you take the risk?|`|CKnHMYHnaa	In a perfect world it might work but too many things could go wrong and I'm not willing to chance it.
uFrqC4Y2aa	I had a miscarriage at 10 weeks, but they baby was measuring 8 weeks. They do the dates from the first day of your last period. So the baby had no heartbeat and stopped growing for 2 weeks. That's when I saw the bleeding. <br>  <br>  But every time you go to the doctor they will be measuring by the gestation age (first day of your last period).|`|GxlkhRfoaa	No if you are 12 weeks pregnant from your lmp then the ultrasound will show 12 weeks pregnant.  The reason your miscarried baby showed 6 weeks instead of 8 is probably because it wasn't growing properly and that why it miscarried.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	The ultrasound factors the dating the same way, based on estimated LMP. Your dates by measurement at roughly 12 weeks might show a variance of up to a week or so, and they won't change your due date unless the measurements are off by more than that. <br>  <br>  If you had a miscarriage and they said baby measured at 6 weeks, the baby probably stopped developing at 6 weeks and you had a missed miscarriage (if you remained pregnant for longer than a week before it passed).|`|wTYh7DiSaa	That was probably the reason for the miscarriage, slow growth. Usually, your LMP and the fetal size correlate to each other. So, when you get the ultrasound it should state that the baby is measuring around 12 weeks.|`|AA11380378	When you are "one" month pregnant , it's based on the LMP, but it has inly been 2 weeks or so since conception.<br>  <br>  When they told you that the baby measured at 6 weeks, it means that the embrio died at 6 weeks and stop growing, and the embrio should have measured at 8 weeks .<br>  <br>  Good luck
q0CHTn89aa	It did kinda help...but totally crushed my hopes! :(  The faint positive is all I had amongst a 3 negs and I have to wait until Tues for my Dr. apt.  My husband and I have been trying for 14 months and this is the first faint even remotely close positive we have gotten!  I hope this is not the case with us, but the crappy truth is better than a beautiful lie!|`|i8Ch743Laa	See,I know in my case,that's not true. I had a faint positive,and then so many negative/inaccurate tests and I was pregnant. It's a fifty fifty thing I think.  Sometimes it means it,sometimes it doesn't.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	Well I know for me personally I had REALLY faint pos for a week and it turned out fine. Usually when someone has a faint positive and later have a series of negatives sometimes its caused by a chemical pregnancy. Its when conception occurs but there was a chromosomal defect that prevented the embryo from growing. Sometimes when people get faint positives it can be from not having stable hcg levels as it is to early to confirm pregnancy. Also-some women who have certain reproductive problems develop cysts that can develop hcg (not a lot) but it can cause a VERY faint hpt. But usually 9/10 if you have a faint pregnancy test conception and at least part of implantation has happend. The chemical reagent strip can NOT turn positive even faintly if there is not hcg to react with it.  A faint line DOES NOT mean that its inconclusive. Any line is a line no matter how faint. It even says on the box and if you have any questions you should consult your dr. What you saw may have been an evaporation line.  GOOD LUCK HUN!!!!!!!!|`|9scpRClxaa	I got a faint positive about 7-8 months ago.  I immediately went to the clinic to have it double-checked and the blood test came back firmly positive.  Now I'm pretty convinced I'm pregnant--she likes to kick and squirm all day.<br>  <br>  I second that if you get a faint positive, be sure to follow up in a day or so.|`|1fuyVMYMaa	I had four or 5 faint positive tests and the doctors confirmed that i was never pregnant but that i had polycystic ovaries and that something to do with that had caused the psoitive tests!|`|dVAiuqZCaa	Well when you get 3 or more faint positives it usually is a positive.I took 6 tests all very faint positives,then went to the doc and he said I'm clearly positive on his test.I guess it depends on the test.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	Yeah well that's not always the case for people and you're going to upset alot of women on here who only have a faint positive to go off of. <br>  <br>  just becuse you had a bad experience doesn't mean that's how it's going to be for the rest of us and beign a Debbie Downer isn't cool. <br>  <br>  Oh, and usually we do let them know that sometimes the tests are faulty, but the chances of it happening are so slim! Usually when you get a positive test that means you're pregnant so just because it didnt' for you doesn't mean you need to crush the hopes of everyone else!
rF6iJHBTaa	I think you should talk to her i mean she seems lonely and shed love your support... you can give suggestions but dont decide....|`|1dNBZFPbaa	Does she WANT your help? If she does, you should help her.. but if she's okay, you should just wait it out, and be there for her when she needs you.|`|GGH0HVdvaa	Well it's not your place to tell someone what to do with their body, it is ultimately her decision. What you can do is be there for her and give her an ear to talk to or a shoulder to cry on.|`|a1uoxczTaa	offer to go see her or offer to let her know that you are more willing to be there for her if she needs someone to talk to.
QI9zF9Xqaa	no and i hope i am never the only child i have a sister she is younger then me i love it i know every time i spend money on my stride gums and she takes is with out my permission but it's cool even though she is younger then me i still call her sis|`|8U4NMYOvaa	i am an only child and it did have it's advantages and disadvantages but i always wanted to have a brother or sister. really wish i had someone to grow up with, have fun with and fight with lol|`|K70Hkq5haa	No, though I loved my parents, I would have missed out in the interactions and conversations of problems I could only discuss with my siblings.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	No.I would be lonely and my kids would have no aunts or uncles.|`|c29e52663578aeb446d60cfbde61aa2daa	Definitely not.

I liked having a little brother and was much happier when he came along.  still am for the most part.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	In my household I was the only child (I had half-siblings at my dad's but didn't spend that much time with them). I was fine with it and enjoyed being by myself to read, listen to music or whatever. I had a neighbor girl to play with so wasn't that bored, and if I was, I often found things to keep myself busy. You just learn to adapt to it. Most kids are okay with it if it's all they've ever known. <br>  <br>  However, I am having my third child, simply because I wanted my child to have siblings. Even though i had a good childhood and no real regrets, I'm hoping my daughter will have a little sister like I didn't have.
pXSKSS3daa	25 oz. is actually fine for his age. At 4 months the average amount of formula is 24-32 oz. in a 24 hour period.<br>  <br>  I would stop the juice, though, he's too young to be having it every day and for multiple feedings. Try water instead. If his formula intake decreases any more than it has I would stop all the other solid food as well. Three solid feeds for a 4 month is quite a bit. Give the formula FIRST and then offer solids afterwards. His formula is far more important at this age than solids or juice.|`|mO2oOqZ3aa	Personally i would stop giving the juice, my son is 10months, the first 6 or 7 months were a difficult time when it came to giving him his bottle, I am still not giving my son juice, there is no need to give him any sugar or create more eating issues...just my opinion.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	I wouldn't stop giving it to him, just wait until he has had some formula.  For instance, don't give him juice until later in the day.  Make it like a treat.<br>  <br>  Also, he might take cereal if you mix it with a little juice.|`|FsFUo4VJaa	Try other kinds try liquid.|`|T0gv52CDaa	It sounds like he just doesn't like the taste of formula now that he knows there are better tasting drinks out there.|`|JXHy2EHQaa	Did your doctor do any testing to see if your son has the required enzymes yet to digest food?  They don't develop until around 6 months.  <br>  Your ped told you to give juice to a 4 month old instead of formula??!!  He is in violation of the AAP guidelines!!!!  OMG, truely, he obviously knows nothing about infant nutrition (which isn't suprising, most doctors don't).  Please stop giving him the liquid sugar.<br>  Your baby might actually be bored and you're misreading his cues.  He might have reflux and it feels good to drink.  But whatever, he is too young for 3 servings of baby food, and way too young for juice.|`|MUVdG9n1aa	He is probably full from all the other stuff. At his age he is totally fine on only formula.. it will meet all his nutritional needs till 6-8 mos. My baby is four months as well and 19 lbs but he is breastfed and I am waiting until he is six months to introduce food. You have to go with your gut- doctors don't know everything. Juice is not as nutritious as the formula.|`|lnsOJ3GBaa	It sounds like he's getting what he needs with 25 oz of formula and baby food 3 times a day. I'd give him water if you feel he's thirsty or water his juice down more. I'm sure he'll be fine sounds like good eater although sounds like he consumes alot for his age. 20 pounds is a big 4 month old. Never to early to start scheduling in order to build good eating habits. Good Luck to you and God Bless|`|ok5cAEp1aa	He is confused... Putting juice in a bottle can cause huge feeding issues. Try a sippy cup, they make trainer sippy cups and my baby does great.
f6415acc134f599e19024ed8d819a2b1aa	It is very possible.<br>  My cousin went 8 1/2 months thinking she was just going to have a big baby.  She found out the day before she actually delivered that she was having twins...talk about a short notice.|`|i8Ch743Laa	It's actually easier to miss twins than you'd think. I've heard of this soooom many times.|`|JQcIwPXJaa	It is possible to miss twins. Sometimes one can hid behind the other or the shape of your uterus can be a factor. Also, a lot of docs look for a baby and then stop. They don't think to look for more. <br>  I measured big with my daughter and when she was born I delivered two placentas. They said that I must have been carrying twins very early on in my pregnancy, but lost one. You should have a scan just to be sure. Best wishes!|`|ox6SXta4aa	I would be interested to hear what your results are if you get any answers soon anyhow because I am also 16 weeks and measuring 20.  This is my third pregnancy and haven't had an ultrasound yet. But I measured exactly right with my other pregnancies.  My doctor didn't seem to be concerned (or at least not as much as I was LOL) .|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	One twin could have been hiding behind the other! Either way, the prospect of having twins must be very exciting!
MmQi03oXaa	It's the same dosage. They do 2 pills a day for 5 days or 1 pill a day for 10 days. Just depends on the doctor.<br>  <br>  When I had to use provera, I did 2 pills for 5 days, and started my period exactly 12 days after the first pill.

She must be Black.<br>  Because I'm not sure how to pronounce it.|`|Uvh4mWQBaa	its different. in a good way|`|pZ7B7VFcaa	Ummm, its OK<br>  <br>  I like Leona more, Leonie as a nick??<br>  <br>  Its your choice and decision anyway
j2mRop0laa	Yes! I do worry. But only if I hear a click. If I hear some kinda click I usually say, "Something came up and I gotta call you back later."<br>  <br>  Usually, I get freaked out thinking my neighbors might be listening to mine and my sisters hour long phone call we have every day. lol <br>  They would only hear gossipy type stuff about what's going on in the schools and what her teenage daughter has told her lately about so and so and how we need to do more yoga cus my azs is starting to droop. But STILL. That's PRIVATE. Maybe people shouldn't eavesdrop. :)<br>  <br>  You know what's REALLY odd, though? My bank called a few days ago to confirm my account number because she thought someone tried to use my number in NYC. I have protection against fraud, though. Anyway.. I said to her "I have to call you back at the bank, I can't take your word for it that you are actually working for Chase." Then I laughed. When I called her back she said "I never actually thought about it that way." Wow!|`|lkhCeAdJaa	We only have a cell phone...no land line.  I have never worried abut giving confidential info over my cell phone .  I guess because I figure if someone wants it bad enough, they don't have to use my cell phone to get it, ya know? I suppose it's possible one could use my cell phone to get my personal info, but they could use anything else,too.<br>  <br>  PS....one can NEVER watch too many FBI shows;-)|`|AA10494763	cordless phones can be picked up by neighbors with baby monitors and i know very few people who have  corded phones anymore.

I'm much happier using my land line.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I only have a cell mozz... what is the point of having two phones unless you live in an area with no reception. (down the street from both of us on Pleasantdale there is NO verizon wireless service at all....total dead zone). I think you watch too many FBI shows and that these days cells are pretty safe. There are still crossed wires these days with landlines... I remember awhile back when I was a teen I had a crossed wire with a neighbor on a different street and I could her convo with her friend (both parties) and she could hear me and my friend. I'd be more worried about crossed wires on landlines, or losing my phone service due to power outages, than using my cell.|`|idn1OQucaa	I pretty much gave up on the idea of keeping at least a certain amount of stuff private.  I put in a good effort, but I can't be bothered worrying about some of it.  I'm not thrilled with a lot of what goes on, but the horse is kind of out of the barn at this point.  Privacy is just one of many things we've lost at this point.<br>  <br>  (Hey - I do know someone who is selling a perfectly fine tin foil hat, if you want to buy one.  :)  )|`|b5c7f6bef65d4f3c4f8ebc309eccc08aaa	only with family members do I tell confidential information (They usually know anyway)<br>  satellites i'm not worried about|`|FvYqKZSMaa	No.Its ok.I use mine all the time with no problems.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Well "they" can always tap your home phone too...lol<br>  <br>  I think you are extremely paranoid.

Whether the technology has changed since that time, I have no idea (though most lawyers are glued to their cellphones, so hopefully it has).|`|VwMkiLFPaa	LOL! I watch a lot of FBI shows too! LOL…makes you wonder huh?<br>  <br>  I call places from my cell phone but I use the work phone to call places like banks and anything I give my social over or anything like that. Not for any other reason except I don’t want people like that calling my cell phone. I don’t have a landline because it’s kind of a waste of money. But I live at work so I use that phone instead. <br>  <br>  Maybe I do it because of too much CSI, NCIS, etc. LOL.<br>  <br>  Good question though....are they safe??
j7fzuDxgaa	its very hard to tell as the pains you have said can happen when a period is due, and everyone is so different some people may get pains and some may not i have been pregnant 3 time and each has been different.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Implantation happens 6-10 dpo.  I think you are wanting to feel it.
JU351q6Naa	well those people are jus bitches then making abusive comments if her babies hungry then they should let her do it. they don't have to stare at her do they.|`|jwIdq5qkaa	I don't have a problem with it at all! If someones child is hungary who am I to stop the women from feeding her baby? I think its great that mom's breastfeed. The only thing that bugs me about it is if they aren't careful you they show there breast but I don't think that happens very often. If I had a baby and were breast feeding though I think if I were that close to the school I'd have a blanket over me and baby. I guess the reason it is viewed as wrong is because so many people have minds that only think about sex and that's what these people are thinking about sex and not the baby.|`|JjXFj2EBaa	I can't believe some of the comments you've had.  Of course it's not a crime, it's how we've fed our children for millions of years.  And as for covering up or doing it in a restroom ... a flipping restroom, are you kidding me, would you eat your dinner in the same room where someone may have defecated only minutes before?  Do you hide under a blanket every time you eat and there is another person around.  And as for having a curious 3 year old, tell him the bloody truth, it's a boob and that mummy is feeding her baby.  I think all women who breast feed should feel free and comfortable whipping their boobs out anywhere they like, I've got a pair myself so I won't feel uncomfortable seeing yours, but neither will I feel the need to stare as the novelty has worn off for me on account of BEING AN ADULT.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, I didn't breast feed.  After my episiotomy they told me penicillin was the strongest painkiller I could have while breast feeding so after 52 hours of labour I wussed out and opted for the drugs!  But good on the mums who aren't big sissies like me!|`|8t8NjjnVaa	If anything, I think it's more of a crime to bottlefeed!  I mean, you have the best thing in the world for your baby right there, but you 'choose' to feed the baby an inferior substance that makes them more susceptible to all types of diseases and illnesses.<br>  <br>  I think that people who think that a woman should go to the bathroom should be made to go eat their own food in the bathroom and see if that seems "decent" to them.  <br>  <br>  While breastfeeding (two kids for just over two years each) I've only had one remark from someone.  I think that was partly due to the fact that I was able to nurse right in front of people without them even noticing.  But anyway, they made a remark to the person they were with...something about that I should go to the bathroom to do that.<br>  <br>  I stood up and said, "Do YOU eat in the bathroom?  Why should my baby?"  Of course I got no reply from her, she just kept walking.<br>  <br>  It's actually quite easy to breastfeed discretely.  I breastfed walking through the mall, through the grocery store, wherever.  No one even noticed, they thought I was just carrying my baby.<br>  <br>  Those that think you should use a cover are just plain wrong.  I bought a cover, used it for a couple of days, and then realized that it was the COVER that was attracting attention to myself.  If I just nursed discreetly, no one even noticed, but when I tried to "hide it" by using a cover, everyone noticed that!<br>  <br>  BTW, I think the reason why some view it as wrong or offensive is because they are not mature enough or too ignorant to separate the natural and practical aspect of the breast from the sexual aspect of the breast.|`|UghJ0XROaa	It's our culture, so many people are weirded out by breastfeeding because breasts are seen as sex objects and not what nature intended them for. It comes so naturally to me and i have never given either of my children bottles, because it seems wrong to me. When i returned to work  with both of them they get bottles of breast milk from daddy. But i just think our culture has become so "advanced" it's become people's nature to not comprehend some of the most natural things in life..<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT-to the person who said breastfeed your child in a bathroom-THAT"S DISGUSTING! We don't eat in the bathroom, why should we force our babies too because someone is weirded out by the way someone feeds their child!|`|xeW6Mvbdaa	No idea! Except that it appears to be a class thing...Around here, the Council estate teens are mostly bottle feeding, while the other end of the spectrum mums breast feed. Perhaps intelligence makes you realise that breast IS best?|`|84f4374bdc6d86131ec48ade47938d4faa	The trick is to be discrete.  We do not live in a society where it is the norm such as some parts of Africa to stand in the street and do it.  People have homes and there are places where women can go to feed their babies without standing outside the school gates in the freezing cold.  Although natural it can be quite offensive to some.  It does seem that some mothers who breast feed like to go out of their way to impose it on everyone else.|`|7PXFXcKfaa	what were the other mothers saying? Did you stick up for her?<br>  <br>  I dont know why - if i knew the answer i think id be a millionaire!!<br>  <br>  BUT personally i think the other mums were probably just jealous because they didnt/couldnt breastfeed their own kids. You know the way that in the school playground, if one kid is really good at something they get bullied by the kids who arnt? The tactics these bullies use is quite similar - put the positive thing down, and turn it into a negative to embarrass the victim, and make them want to stop showing their talent.<br>  <br>  If these mothers ever go to northern europe they are in for a massive culture shock.<br>  <br>  Actually men i can kind of understand why they find it hard (not saying i agree!!!) because for men breasts are a sexual object, and i would imagine its quite hard to see their favourite sex toy being turned into udders. However i dont get it why women are unsupportive?<br>  <br>  Breastfeeding is the most natural thing in the world ... unfortunately many women squabble and ***** when we really should be supporting each other. Ugh women like that make me so mad ... all they are doing is setting up another generation like them.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	I don't see breast feeding as offensive and I don't know anyone my own age (I'm in my early twenties) male or female that does! I always believed that was the naive attitude of teenage boys and girls. Everyone has their own opinion on a variety of issues but I think whispering snidely about a woman doing something that is natural and beneficial for her child is just nasty, these women should have kept their thoughts to themselves.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I agree entirely with the woman that said breasts are now seen as more of a sexual object than an instrument to feed your children with. I bet those mothers will be finding playboys under their kids mattresses in about 10 years time full of surgically enhanced bimbos and they'll be wishing they had let their child see a woman doing what is right for her children and using their breasts for their correct use.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Why should women rush to find somewhere other than where they are standing (or sitting) to breast feed? I bet the majority of those who feel uncomfortable with breast feeding don't get in this much of a flap about topless sunbathers.|`|2O7N6cb9aa	I breastfed both my children and now am pregnant with my third on the way. My second child is 3 and I am still breastfeeding her (at least until I have my third). Anyhow, I experience mean remarks like that from other women all the time. In public, I rarely breastfeed only because I know there will be women making comments but I have come to realize that <br>  1. if you are the mom and breastfeeding your baby, you just have to make sure that you respect other women who may/ may not breastfeed. And the way you do that is the only time you breastfeed in coplete open public is if there really is NOWHERE else to breastfeed your hungry baby. Also, the breastfeeding mom has to make sure she has some type of blankie or cover up so that her breasts are not showing in any way to respect other women<br>  2. Sometimes, other women are accompanied by men and maybe they dont feel comfortable with their men trying to check the breastfeeding mom's boobs out. That is really uncomfortable for those women. <br>  <br>  And trust me, I completely believe in breastfeeding for the wonderful immunity it gives children as well as the bond it makes between baby and mom but otherwise, I do feel that breastfeeding still should somewhat be as private as possible and I have to try my best to respect other moms. Breastfeeding can make other women really uncomfortable or sometimes, simply because women are vulnerable and insecure sometimes, they tend to treat other women that way. For me, I never breastfeed in public if I do not have a cover up or blanket of any sort. I am not the kind of mother who just does not care what anyone thinks. Yes, someone will always be offended in some way when breastfeeding mommies like me breastfeed but otherwise, as long as I know I am being as private with covering myself up and considerate of all the other women around me in the public places, and I know that feeding my baby is a priority ... the truth is no matter what we do, there will always be someone who will have to say something about us.|`|X6BrtJ9eaa	Breastfeeding is the most natural thing and the best start to a baby's life. I expect they were all just jealous.  Joking aside though, the trouble is women's breasts have become so sexualized in the media, that some people are afraid of their kids seeing a naked breast for fear they will turn into perverts!|`|RM3vIeDVaa	I personally blame men for this. They have turned women's breast into something to be admired and a sexual thing instead of the thing that God had intended them for....feeding young.<br>  <br>  Any woman that scorns another for breast feeding should be ashamed of herself....|`|hvZSKn6Eaa	Really?...Wow..I would have been forced to tell them all exactly what i thought of them, it wouldn't be hard to make such a bunch of bitchy hags look ridiculous...they've done most of the work already...<br>  <br>  Out of everyone, mothers especially should know better than to belittle a breast feeding mother...|`|PTtKKOP2aa	Ignorance that's why,its the most natural thing in the world and can be done discreetly.I breast fed all mine,mind you i dont think id stand outside a school doing it lol|`|AA11724052	Many people still have victorian views about women who have the temerity to breast feed their children in public. These views hold sway even though the breast is never exposed.|`|TJ6hKDAiaa	dont see the problem with it.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Assuming you're in the UK, I'm not sure what their 'laws' are about it. Probably the same as the US - you can breastfeed anywhere you want to, and you're protected. The rules in some places require you to be discreet, while others are more open-ended and allow you to use your discretion when covering up, etc. <br>  <br>  I'd say it's more of a crime NOT to feed your child - the kid's gotta eat. <br>  <br>  If it were me, I'd likely smile and say, "Stuff it up your ----!" LOL|`|hVuPqHzsaa	It is a very natural thing to do. Animals do it without any problem.|`|1Si9RlEXaa	Is it a crime when we eat in public? Do I have to get mean remarks when I go to restaurant and eat? <br>  <br>  <br>  The only thing I can think of why people would be rude is, Was she covered up? I do believe it's natural but around other kids might be why mothers were so rude to her. I wouldn't be want my child to see someone else's tata because they wouldn't understand what is going on and might feel uncomfortable. <br>  <br>  But all and all If someone is covered up then I really don't care what people think. I breast fed my daughter when she is hungry. <br>  <br>  Drive-threw should be a crime, that is what is killing people, Not breast feeding your babies!|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	It is frowned upon because breasts are seen as a sexual thing.   People think the same thing when a women is breast feeding her baby to a women who decided to pop her breast out for no apparent reason.  They probably think ew what you doing that for in front of everyone and that the mother should feel ashamed, when it is the person thinking it should be!!.<br>  <br>  It s completely wrong I don't see the problem with it, why should a mother have to rush home or go into a bathroom at a restaurant etc just so her baby can feed? (Of course you can pump breast milk into a bottle but it needs to be at certain temperature for babies so that isn't really possible).<br>  <br>  Women should be proud they are breast feeding and not using milk out of a tin, they are giving their child the best start in life, what is criminal about that?<br>  <br>  and to the person that said they dont want to see their son seeing breasts, well maybe if you told him that they are there to feed a baby and not a sexual object then maybe there wouldn't be so many teenage pregnancies out there!!!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i think it's just because people aren't used to seeing someone sitting out in the open breastfeeding. for most people it's something that (they think) should be done in the privacy of your own home. i don't care who is breastfeeding where just as long as the person is covered up.|`|VV5KZjGRaa	Breastfeeding is one of the most natural things in the world!<br>  <br>  A lot of people think badly of doing it in public but I say, they haven't had kids yet! Do you think they would let their kids go hungry?
bdzG1VEDaa	lots of candles, music, get some food, offer a massage... get a dvd and a bottle of wine.|`|qIWUC1Ceaa	personally i would buy nice take out, that way you do not have to cook or do dishes. If not pick a nice meal and cook it togather. Both my husband and i love to cook, so one night a week we plan a meal and spend time togather in the kitchen after the kids go to bed. I would also maybe get something sexy to wear, if he likes that kind of stuff.Pick up a fun adult game from a novelty store. If you drink, maybe a bottle of wine or some liquor to make drinks, or beer, whatever you like to drink. I will leave the rest to your imagination.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	Think of the first thing you did together, where you first really connected, and do that.

Are you sure he wants to have a child with you?|`|d7a221dc65e9541431ba88edec210e7aaa	having $ex the day before you ovulate will get you pregnant also, as the sperm stays alive for at least 3 days... but he has to come inside you...<br>  <br>  try for another couple of months, and if not go to a doctor and do a PCT, or check fallopian tubes... or sperm count... that is if you're sure you're ovulating. but there's pills for that..<br>  <br>  just ask your doctor|`|N8DxgAD7aa	With an irregular period not everything is normal and no dr would have said so. Go see a dr for real now and listen to the advice given.
Maho3P5kaa	my husband wants to name our second son Theodore William Eutsler..any red sox fans out there know why..Ted Williams. and second son because first will have the family name. anyways, i dont like it so he probably wont get to name our second son that.|`|CTmWS6dMaa	Theodore is fine. I love the nn Teddy as well and was considering using Thaddeus so that I could use it. I like Thaddeus more than Theodore personally.|`|s2fQf3LXaa	Probably Not. But the nickname theo IS cute.|`|ei0e7RwOaa	Of course. Especially if my last name was Roosevelt.|`|DcbIVUisaa	Maybe. In Romania (my country) Teodor is a nice name. :)|`|VHHis05Naa	Yes, I would.  I love it!|`|1OpcR7bZaa	Yes I would use it, its a nice unusual name.|`|hSTNMnFPaa	Actually, I'm planning on getting a Great Dane and calling him Theodore "Teddy", lol. I really couldn't picure it on a human. Only dogs and little cartoon chipmunks.<br>  ? Qǖ???|`|fWB8q1dwaa	I actually really like the abbreviation Ted. So while I wouldn't choose to call my kid theodore, I would call him ted. I would go with Edward, to abbreviate to Ted. Or Eddy, I like that too :)|`|KOcCenrEaa	no reminds me too much of the chipmunks.|`|n4tPArAAaa	no never|`|6xf1GfbUaa	I would never name my child Theodore, but I will most definitely name my cute puppy or kitten Teddy ?|`|07527bc8468917a254c01d461144bd4faa	No, I wouldn't name anyone Theodore.  Teddy or Theo could be names used in their own right if someone likes them.|`|bMZ7lOfVaa	No, I wouldn't. It reminds me of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore too much (The Chipmunks).|`|qqj7e64Waa	I wouldnt use Theodore as a name but i might use Theo<br>  <br>  xxx|`|TJ6hKDAiaa	if you like the cosby show or theodore roosevelt|`|H0fXySX9aa	not me but i have chip monks and one is called Theodore|`|25Ys3DEPaa	Never...just go with Theo|`|HiDShoGraa	yes i think thats a cool name
5ZvALiclaa	you're in early labour! That is how it starts. <br>  Menstrual like cramps and a hardening of your belly/uterus IS a contraction, just a very very very mild one.<br>  <br>  Your water doesn't have to break and you don't have to have a show to go into labour. Start walking around as much as you can to help move things along, gravity is your best friend right now!<br>  <br>  Don't start stressing yet though, sounds like things are going to take a while so just slowly get your things together and take naps if you can and keep hubby on hand for when things do heat up!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck, you'll be meeting your baby soon!|`|def5d056753c507adaad1d31c72512beaa	i dont know why drs let womeon go past 40 weeks , theres lots of storys on here of babys dying at 42 ish weeks in the womb. I'd call the dr and have him check you and explain your symptoms and demand to be seen, i'd never let myself go over 40 weeks, i'll lye to the dr to induce labor if i have to, its to scary!!<br>  <br>  best of luck and call the dr!|`|bbQq205Gaa	It may be contractions. I would call your doctor and have them check you out just in case. Good luck!
7wwLbWN1aa	Uhm, person above me, could you BE any more ignorant? <br>  <br>  <br>  I think soaps would be lovely! Errrr, as far as the bracelet goes, not so much. But I think soaps and a nice card would be best. :)<br>  <br>  EDIT- what about a nice necklace? Perhaps leather choke with a silver or gold emblem. Is he religious?|`|AA11537580	buy him a nice CD of his favourite band or a t-shirt|`|nTSjPOYQaa	I would suggest looking at the men's jewelry/watches at UrbanOutfitters. Or since he likes bright colors, Urbanoutfitters has some really cute bright patterned boxer briefs which would be a fun gift :] <br>  Soap would also be thoughtful.

OgzHcNMsaa	Depending on your discharge it could very well  be a yeast infection. If the discharge is white and thick and clumpy like, then it's possible. I would go to the dr to rule out any more serious infections. But for yeast, simple over the counter such as Monistat or Canesten can work wonders.|`|7PXFXcKfaa	hmm you didnt say if you were breastfeeding or not, but it sounds like a yeast infection. Breastfeeders are particularly prone to them for some reason - so i would go to your doc. Your pharmacist will just send you back to your doc, because its so soon after having a baby. <br>  <br>  He really has seen it all before!!! dont worry!|`|mFQydvncaa	it could be a yeast or bladder infection! i had the same, i itched to death and finally gave in! <br>  <br>  try vagisil, or another antitch creme for below! if it doesnt work you need to talk to a doctor! goodluck|`|WWfL5tMvaa	it might be an infection so ask your doctor and see what you can do with that. normally you apply a cream on it that is special for infections in this area.<br>  Best of luck<br>  and congratulation on you new baby|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	I agree, talk to your doctor. <br>  <br>  However, how long did you have to wear pads for afterward? And have you had to wear them recently? Could be kind of like diaper rash.|`|zjuMrDmGaa	It's a yeast infection. See your doctor as there is now a one time pill they can give you instead of having to go through days of messy creams.|`|yoNXldH8aa	I would call the doctor but in the mean time you can get some anti-itch cream called i think vagicane or something similar I had such a rash after  my son was born from wearing pads I was going to go insane it itched super bad also but it wasn't a yeast infection it went away after a day or two of usage. You can get it at walmart|`|X6BrtJ9eaa	Sounds like thrush. Thrush is a fungus which is usually kept at bay by friendly bacteria so antibiotics and antibacterial creams are the worst thing for it. Get some anti-fungal cream like Canestan. Some people who are breast feeding and therefore want to avoid chemicals use natural yoghurt on a tampon. Eating natural yoghurt or drinking pro-biotic drinks helps restore the body's natural "friendly" bacteria.|`|hL4w8EjXaa	Sounds a bit like thrush, I had a c-section and i still got that after having my wee boy, par for the course with your body getting back into shape.  A course of antibiotics and some cream to ease the irritation should do the trick - ask your doc. Good luck.|`|qI5W6eyjaa	i had the same thing. Thought i was going to go crazy.<br>   You prob have a yeast infection. You can get over the OTC med for it.
59GymH27aa	I had a BFN about 10minutes ago.  Really shouldn't have tested as I promised myself I would wait but I couldn't help it.  Really want my little girl to have a brother or sister.  Can't wait till it happens.  Hoping tonight might be the night.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	I'm testing monday and then again wed eventhough I'm so tempted to test today! My period is due on wed but I just had what seems like a double period or implantation bleeding? Unless i had 2 periods in one month i'm praying it was implantation bleeding!! (keeping fingers crossed) I've never had a double period and i have been getting my period since i was in 5th grade (11yrs old) people are scaring me sayin it could be a possible miscarriage.. I'm worried but I'm praying to god that this is my month i've been trying to conceive since Sept. pray for me girls!!<br>  <br>  ****BABY DUST TO ALL****|`|tdNfQWaAaa	I'm still waiting... I should start in about a week. I have been cramping though, so my hopes have all been shot to the ground... I have also had sore/heavy boobs and slight nausea... But, I'm expecting a BFN, but there is still a week left.... <br>  <br>  Did you have cramping when you were about 6 dpo?<br>  <br>  Thanks! Best of luck to you and your baby!!!
JQcIwPXJaa	No, it's not. It can drastically raise your body temp quickly and harm your baby. Best wishes!|`|ioZeveazaa	Absolutely not because it will raise your body temperature and your baby's. Your baby's body temp needs to stay at 98.6 to be safe. Don't do it ok. Good luck!|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Honestly the jury's still out on this one.  There doesn't seem to be any solid, conclusive evidence one way or the other.  Pregnant women in many countries routinely use saunas and don't seem to have any problems.  However, steam rooms/saunas can raise your body temperature and that elevation can be potentially harmful to the baby.  So until there is some scientific proof that it's ok it's safest to err on the side of caution and skip the steam room all together until after the baby comes.  A warm bath or warm towel compress on sore areas would be a safer way to achieve a similar relaxation.|`|5ZvALiclaa	NO, it will increase your body temp too high and can cause problems for you and baby. Also stay away from spa's/jacuzzi's as they are usually a higher temp as well, even just for a few minutes. Warm baths are ok as long as the water isn't really hot<br>  <br>  here is some info for background information on what it can do to you and baby<br>  <a href="http://www.prenatalcentre.com.au/heat_mothers_and_babies.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.prenatalcentre.com.au/heat_mo...</a>|`|uVuYdcRcaa	Hi,<br>  <br>   No it not safe - the heat is dangerous to you and your baby - it can make you very lightheaded.<br>  <br>  I use to love really hot baths but since being pregnant and having a little one walking around, I have reduce the temperature and it warmer than hot.<br>  <br>  Just avoid the steam room for now - pamper yourself once baby born and go but for now, no.<br>  <br>  Lx|`|i8Ch743Laa	No,no hot tubs or steam rooms. It eleveates your core temperature, (body temperature) which isn't good. The baby's is already higher than yours,and they say to NOT raise your core temperature. It could be dangerous to the baby.|`|7vCMigRnaa	Like everyone else has stated, no, it is not safe. It rises your blood temp which isn't good for the baby. Same thing for hot tubs. It's also why they say you should avoid baths.|`|RIu6u1xmaa	No it is not safe to go in a hot tube or steam room at any stage of your pregnancy. I can tell you this from past experience. My daughter went into a hot tub and miscarried a few weeks later.  :(|`|b8f0CfSsaa	I wouldn't have thought so... hot baths and hot tubs are a big no no so its most likely that steam rooms are also not allowed.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	No. it's not safe to elevate your body temperature for any ammount of time while pregnant... that means no hot tubs either.|`|c1de8b0505a79fcad4bedc3b6eac4556aa	nope its not safe, also do not use sauna or Jacuzzi either|`|1684def10df066b413faa550df5a8fb8aa	ask your doc/midwife but steam room can raise your blood pressure

MHg9JhEKaa	He doesn't want to have this baby, so you have to let him know he does not have to be a part of it if he doesn't want to. <br>  <br>  They do say that women become mothers when they get pregnant, and men become fathers when the baby is born. You never know he may change his mind, but for the moment the only thing you can do is relieve that pressure by letting him know you will not make him feel obliged. I know you said in the beginning you both decided to have this baby, but try not to be too hard on him for changing his mind. Let him know it's his call. <br>  <br>  'Not playing happy families' means he does not want to go through this pretending like you are 'happy families' in other words he doesn't feel he is able to fulfil the father/husband role. (at least, not at the moment).  He is assuming that you will want to marry in order to provide the best stable environment for the baby, and so getting in there first by telling you he doesn't want this. <br>  <br>  So, where does this leave you? Possibly as a single mother, but give him some space and time to think about things. It's an awful lot for you both to take on board right now, but if you handle the situation in a good way now, you may be able to cement a foundation for a good relationship, and a father for your baby. <br>  <br>  Good luck hun x|`|2l7lbcJWaa	I agree with all the answers so far. You HAVE to be straight forward about all of this. You have to tell him to make a choice. Obviously it would be easier for you to have a boyfriend while you're going through this, but you need to be thinking about what is best for your baby in the long run. It definitely sounds like he doesn't want the responsibly of being a daddy. Unfortunately he has that choice. So be a responsible mom - tell him to step up or leave. <br>  <br>  You don't need this extra stress while you're pregnant!!|`|JQcIwPXJaa	If it were me.....I would ask him to sign over parental rights and leave. You don't want this kind of man having rights over your child. If he is avoiding you and making you feel like crap just imagine how your baby will feel. There are plenty of good men out there who would be happy to be with you and your baby. <br>  Thank you for keeping your baby! Being a mother is the most wonderful thing I have ever experienced. You will love it! =)|`|ytE1q20taa	Give it time, he might come round. I was sort of in the same situation, my fiance never wanted to talk about it, but one day I made him talk about it and now we are looking forward to the arrival of our son :)|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well it's simple. he doesn't want to have a baby. i don't think this man is someone you should be looking to have in your life for an extended period of time. right now it seems he is only talking to you because he feels obligated. before too long his feeling of obligation is going to be replaced with running away. i say tell him he has a choice. either be in the babies life or don't. make sure he knows that you have no intention on marrying him or anything like that and also make it clear that you gave him a choice on keeping the baby or not and since he made that choice he needs to step up to the plate. if he doesn't want to be in a relationship with you then it's his loss but he needs to figure out whether or not he is going to be there for the baby. if not he better at least make sure he is holding up his end of the bargain financially

b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It's probably the baby pressing into your ribs. While I never got kicked there, lots of women I know said it was pretty painful. <br>  <br>  With pre-e the most common symptoms are headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, and swelling in the extremities, like your ankles. However, as you get towards the end, the edema (swelling) is pretty normal. Since your urine and stuff came back normal, I wouldn't worry too much about it. You can always go to a drug store and have your blood pressure checked if you're unsure; sometimes they have those self-checker machines there. <br>  <br>  Indigestion is totally normal - that baby is sitting on everything! LOL You can't eat anymore without feeling full halfway through and then the wonderful heartburn kicks in. I find that I can be fine after a meal and then when I go to lie down for bed it starts up, sometimes a couple hours later. Tums really helps me for that. <br>  <br>  If you're that concerned, call your midwife. Otherwise I think what you're feeling are the normal pains of pregnancy! :D|`|JQcIwPXJaa	I wouldn't read into it just yet. I had that happen with my daughter a couple times and it was just her feet causing the pain and the fact that everything is so cramped up that causes the indigestion. Always call your midwife though just in case. =)|`|5ZvALiclaa	Pre-eclampsia symptoms include elevated blood pressure, retaining fluid/swelling, diziness, frontal headaches and protein in your urine. I had this with my first baby and suffered none of the symptoms you listed. <br>  <br>  I don't think your symptoms are related to preeclampsia as much as they are related to babies position and it causing the indigestion. <br>  I really wouldn't worry about it, if you are not in pain anymore I'm sure you'll be ok. Run it by the doc or midwife at your next appointment but i'm sure everything is normal pregnancy niggles<br>  <br>  good luck and congrats on the baby. you're on the home stretch now!

If she can't keep anything down, she'll get dehydrated!|`|AG7RcqzPaa	Hi, <br>  <br>  We have three kids and we had the same problem you had before.<br>  <br>  Most babies vomit small amounts from time to time and may also bring up small amounts of milk when they burp. This is known as posseting and is usually nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  More frequent vomiting or vomiting large quantities, may be due to gastric reflux. The stomach lies just under a muscle called the diaphragm. Both the diaphragm and the gullet (the tube between the mouth and the stomach) act together to keep stomach contents in the stomach. This system sometimes doesn't work too well in young babies and the stomach contents can come back up the gullet, including some of the acid from the stomach.<br>  <br>  This problem often affects women in the later stages of pregnancy so you might well remember what it felt like. Babies can be irritable and it can sometimes lead to poor feeding. If your baby is feeding well and doesn't seem upset by the vomiting, it may not be necessary to do anything other than changing the baby's position during a feed to make her more upright. Don't use a pillow in your baby's cot or leave her to sleep in her car seat for long periods. Your health visitor can advise you on safe ways to raise her head and shoulders a little as she sleeps. Feeding smaller volumes may also help if your baby is happy with this.<br>  <br>  In more severe cases you may need to try an antacid, such as Gaviscon. This is mixed with water for breastfed babies or added to infant formula. Milk can also be thickened using a special thickening powder. Ask your GP or health visitor for more information on this.<br>  <br>  It is likely that the problem will get better on its own as your baby gets older and her muscles get stronger. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps you.<br>  <br>  Thanks,<br>  <br>  Rob<br>  *Experienced Dad with the help of mum of course*
PTdy6TWRaa	It sounds like he is doing a lot of testing. Being around a child who is used to much more permissive parenting will confuse your son as he sees that the boundaries and limits that he's used to are being crossed and mixed up all the time.<br>  <br>  It is a lot to expect of a much younger child to bring up the behavior of an older friend. In most cases the older and more dominant one will lead and in this case drag the behavior down.<br>  <br>  I think that as much as the other parent may be a good friend if their child's behavior undermines my own child too much I would have to consider limiting the amount of time I spend with them.|`|f6415acc134f599e19024ed8d819a2b1aa	He is showing off, or yes, he could even be imitating the other child's behavior.  If the other child is "getting away" with something, then he is thinking he could also.  We have friends who have a 14 mth old who is an angel when he is around us in our home, but "acts out" when he is in his own home because he knows he can "get away" with certain things there.|`|jhnO5Ptraa	hes probably just showing off.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	Kids often behave according to the reaction they get.  It sounds more like your child has a need to get more attention around certain people.  Maybe they usually get more attention than him, or maybe you pay less attention when they're around?  This is especially common with only children who are used to getting all the attention.  It may seem odd, but even negative attention is better than not enough.<br>  <br>  This is just a possibility, but maybe think about the circumstances and see if they might fit.|`|q1y7kgnEaa	my kids are ages 6,4,2 and 9 months,is he being really bad when he acts differently? or is he just not acting what u say is normal for him?? after all, wether he speaks at a 4 yr old level or not, if he only 2 and half, he is still going to act it at times, and thats how 2 and half yr olds are, give him some time, 2 yr olds cant be expected to act perfect all the time, they have short attention spans and still need to be kids....if he is still doing it at 3 then u can discipline him|`|QotDwtmMaa	I have a four year old in my house, and he does the same exact thing. Every-timee a non-family member comes over..its almost as if they know when you want them to behave, but they do the opposite. Most likely its forattentionn. Esp. if it is another child, you may be showing some attention towards the other children and hedoesn'tt like that. Or because there is another child there to take the attention away that wouldnormallyy go to him. If it is an adult, i would say its just a cry for attention. So maybe when such ones are around, you could make sure you spend time with your child, sit with him, talk with him, so hedoesn'tt feel he has to act out to get your attention.|`|q0CHTn89aa	My son does the same, I've found that if I get down to his eye level and speak to him instead of at him it helps tremendously.  You need to tell him what you expect, and how he will benefit from this ie a treat or special privilege or if he continues the naughty behavior what consequences there will be. I am a big fan of the corner/time outs and taking a favorite toy away.  I also try and limit the time he spends with certain kids (his cousin these days) that he wants to be so much like when they are around.|`|WJ7pRtD3aa	maybe he is being himself.. people tend to accommodate the 'feeling' of people around them... <br>  <br>  would you act the exact same around the President... prolly not.. you would straighten you self up.. and be more respectable.. well I'm guessing you would.|`|wbvs4DoNaa	if he's hanging around with the "friend" of his, tell him either to find a new friend or stop imitating his behaviors (the former will probably work out better). and if  he's acting goofy just around those certain people, tell him to be extra good when he's around them or limit him to see those people for a shortened period of time. all in all, just teach him some discipline
8t8NjjnVaa	Breastfeeding burns an average of 500 calories a day.  If you eat normally, that will be a 1 lb weight loss each week  (500 calories a day X 7 days a week = 3500 calories a week.  3500 calories = 1 lb.)<br>  <br>  Breastfeeding also helps your uterus contract so it gets back to its regular size quicker...making your belly smaller.<br>  <br>  My first child had reflux, so whatever she drank, she basically spit most of it up within 30 minutes so she'd want to nurse again.  Since she was nursing so much, I had to produce a lot more milk and the 'baby weight' just fell off of me.  I gained a total of 41 lbs during my pregancy, but I was back in my old clothes when my baby was only 5 weeks old!<br>  <br>  Of course, if you use breastfeeding as an excuse to eat like a pig, then you will not lose weight.  If you follow a healthy diet and eat sensibly, then you will lose weight.<br>  <br>  By the way, don't worry if nature will allow you to breastfeed.  I'm sure you've heard tons of women say that they couldn't produce, but most of them were just uneducated about it.  There are very few that actually cannot produce enough milk, and the vast majority of them have had breast surgery.  <br>  <br>  Educate yourself about breastfeeding and you will do fine.  I'm not saying it's always smooth sailing, but if you are knowledgeable about the benefits for the baby and the bumps in the road you may hit, you will be successful.|`|0viZhxi6aa	Breastfeeding actually helps the uterus shrink back down to normal size, which helps initially. Then it's up to you to eat good healthy foods that provide enough nutrition for you and your baby, but if you do, you will lose weight. You use anywhere from 500 to 800 calories a day, so just don't eat a bunch of junk food, and you'll be looking great in no time!|`|8pup9oWhaa	Everyday someone tells me how good im looking since giving birth. I went down to my pre-pregnancy size, and then dropped another size. My girl is 3 months old and i exclusivly breastfeeding. Not everyone would lose weight as quickly as I did, but you do lose weight while breastfeeding.<br>  I love breastfeeding, and know my girl is getting the best, but there has been times when Ive wanted to give up, but i have the full support of my husband, and that always helps.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	As long as you are eating healthy, you will almost certainly lose weight. I was 5'3 120-125 pre pregnancy and since Ive been nursing I cant seem to keep the weight on. I weigh 104 now and was back at my pre preggo weight 2 months after I had him. Set up a support system now of other moms who are breastfeeding and a support group for breastfeeding moms. <br>  <br>  Nature almost always allow women to breastfeed, they just need support and to have patience while she and the baby are learning. Having a lactation consultant to turn to will be helpful also. Two great books are the Womanly Art of Breastfeeding and The  Breastfeeding Book by Martha Sears. I think being educated about it is really helpfula dn encourages you to stick with it.|`|7PXFXcKfaa	BFing has no reason to make you gain weight - it should actually make you lose weight, because it burns up to 500 calories a day!! However some women are extra hungry when breastfeeding so eat an extra 500 ... and they dont really lose any!!<br>  <br>  At the end of the day though weight loss shouldnt be your only motivation to breastfeed - the weight will come off itself with a healthyish diet and exercize... but tbh breastfeeding really has helped me! Ive never been skinny and always found it really hard to lose weight, but ive already shed all my baby fat.|`|MR9iBgafaa	You lose weight whilst breastfeeding as it takes around 500 cals per day to feed. However it makes you starving, so just be careful you don't eat double the cals you're losing!<br>  <br>  I lost weight whilst breastfeeding.|`|33O7ZTRRaa	I have 2 children, my oldest is 4 1/2 years and i have an 8 week old.  My 4 year old was formula fed.  I chose to try breastfeeding with my second child.  Breastfeeding is quite the challenge but well worth it.  The first 3-4 days your child is alive, you body will produce something called colostrum before your milk supply comes in.  You milk supply typically comes in between days 4-7.  <br>  Newborns, nurse every 1 1/2-3 hours. Since breastfeeding works on a supply and demand basis, make sure in the beginning  that you feed on demand because this is how your body will regulate your milk supply.<br>  I think that everyone has different experiences in regards to the weight thing.  Breastfeeding burns about 500 calories a days, so its important to make sure that you are eating well because your body needs the nutrients to be able to perform that task effectively.  Not to mention what you put in your body goes into your baby's via your milk.  Personally, I gained 20lbs during my pregnancy.  I had a c-section and at my 2 weeks check-up I had lost 22 lbs.  When I went back at my 6 week appointment I had lost another 4-5lbs.  So breastfeeding definitely helped me lose my weight quickly.  Now I just need to exercise and tone back up.<br>  Just some more information on breastfeeding,  your nipples may be pretty sore those first 2 weeks.  I took several breastfeeding classes and nothing those ladies told me actually prepared me for the pain I was in.  One lactation consultant told me that the first 2 weeks are the hardest, and if you can get through that than you will be good to go.   There were actually times it hurt so bad I cried while I was feeding my son.  It did get better though. The most important thing is to make sure that your baby is latched on properly.  Make sure he/she has both the nipple and the areola in their mouth.  My son latched on very good in the beginning, but throughout the feeding he would start to fall asleep and his latch wouldn't be as tight and he'd end up hurting my nipples quite a bit.  Invest in some Lanolin cream.  I used the Medela brand, and its a godsend!  I don't know what i would do with out it.  Put it on after every feeding.  You don't want you nipples to get dried out and crack and bleed, they may very well do that anyway as your body adjusts to breastfeeding, but just make sure to keep the Lanolin on there.   Also, as you milk supply comes in you, you may have engorgement.  If you have a breast pump, you may want to pump a little prior to nursing, just so you aren't so full and so that nursing isn't painful.  And remember to try to empty your breasts completely at each feeding.  Empty breasts fill up again faster.<br>  Good for you for wanting to breastfeed!  Personally, I'm so glad that I chose to breastfeed.  Looking back, I wish I would've done it with my first.  Breastfeeding is very time consuming but it gives you such a special bond with you baby.  I had to come back to work 2 weeks ago when my son was 6 weeks old, and now I pump at work.  I so miss being able to breastfeed all the time, but he is still getting my milk so thats what is important.  <br>  Breastfeeding does seem to make me very hungry sometimes though.  Even more hungry than when I was pregnant.  I just try to make good food choices.  Make sure you are getting plenty of fruits and vegetables, and makes sure you are drinking plenty of fluids.  I just try to remember that moderation is the key to most things in life. <br>  <br>  Good luck with everything!!!|`|0cx4imxHaa	Normally it helps you lose weight. My mom, who is a nurse and childbirth educator, said if you do it past 6 months, you start to lose weight around the abdomen. I have been doing it for 5 months and have lost 26 of the 35 pounds I gained during pregnancy. According to a lot of other women, this is pretty slow, but I have not done any other form of exercise regularly. So it depends on the person.|`|2eyxGbm0aa	Breastfeeding should make you lose weight.  If you follow your healthy eating habits from pregnancy then you should lose weight.  I have seen some women lose a lot of weight and others only a little.  I found my weight fluctuated day to day, but stayed constant to what I was before pregnancy while breastfeeding.|`|qX3ixlNyaa	Breastfeeding burns up to 500 extra calories a day. I lost weight in the first couple of weeks then I maintained until my baby was weaned. (I was hungry all the time while BF) Some ladies lose weight and some don't. You do have to be careful that you loss slowly and eat properly or your milk supply can decrease. Good Luck!!|`|X6BrtJ9eaa	It helps you lose weight providing you eat sensibly and it also gives your baby a good start in life.<br>  However not everyone can feed their baby this way so don't be too hard on yourself if you can't manage it.|`|aUifz2a4aa	I lost my 18lbs of pregnancy weight and 35 extra lbs.<br>  My guy is just under 4 months old.<br>  Breastfeeding can be a struggle. It took me almost a month to finally feel like I was doing it right.<br>  Try to Stick to it!|`|NRXE6g7faa	breastfeeding uses up about 500 calories a day so if following a healthy diet you should loose weight|`|2O7N6cb9aa	Hi there. Well, I will tell you from my own experiences. I have a 3 & 4 yr old of which I have breastfed both and the 3 yr old, I am STILL breastfeeding because we have such a close bond. I am now pregnant with my third child on the way and when I have the third, I am sure to stop breastfeeding my 3 yr old. <br>  <br>  Anyhow, I heard alot of the losing weight thing while breastfeeding too and you know ... I DID gain a lot of weight with my pregnancies. So I was really hoping that other than the nutritional aspect of the breastfeeding part that I would lose weight. And no, I have not lost that much weight at all other than what might just be usual for a mother after her pregnancy. For example, I weighed 120 lbs before I got pregnant with my first child, weighed 192 lbs at delivery (OMG), and then only went down to 165 within the first 6 months. Then I got pregnant with my second, and weighed 185 lbs at delivery with my second. I only lost 20 lbs the whole entire 1st year after I delivered my second child. Now that my daughter is 3 yrs old (my 2nd child), I am still only 145 lbs. I never ate more or really unhealthy foods. I have heard of women losing so much wieght from pregnancy their 1st year that they were thinner after the baby than they were even before the baby. Now that is DEFINITELY not me. And I eat fresh veggies, fruit and very little sweets. <br>  <br>  For me, I would tell you that DO NOT LISTEN to anyone about losing or not losing weight while pregnant at all. Only because everyone's body is soo different. <br>  <br>  In this case, all you can do really is think about the benefits this will be for you and your baby and the bond it will create between you two however, the whole weight thing, dont worry about it too much. If you dont lose that much weight (the way I did) ... its not that you are doing anything wrong or that you are weird or anything ... just that women's bodies are so different that for someone like me ... who has not lost the dramatic amount of weight as some have or as I would have liked to, I will just wait until I am really done with having babies then lose the weight through workout and diet thereafter. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps! <br>  <br>  With love ...
8t8NjjnVaa	You can try breastfeeding and see if that agrees with his system more.  <br>  <br>  The problem could be any number of things.  It could be that you are overfeeding him, it could be that he's allergic to the formula, it could be that he has reflux (although reflux babies don't usually shoot out their milk, they just spit it up), it could be something more serious like pyloric stenosis.  <br>  <br>  The only one that could really tell you what the problem with your son is your son's doctor.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	While I know that true vomiting as opposed to spitting up is not considered good, I was told that it always looks like more than it is. My daughter did this for a while (I was nursing) and then it slowly manifested itself into intestinal problems - change in stool color, mucus and blood. I determined she had a milk protein allergy and changed my diet and she greatly improved. But it did take awhile for other symptoms to show up, and only started with some fussiness and vomiting. <br>  <br>  You can try switching to a dairy free (not just lactose free) formula and see how he does. As far as gas, Mylicon drops might help and also easing his knees into his chest to encourage gas to escape from his tummy. If you've been on the new stuff and he's still throwing up, I would switch - your ped might recommend something hypoallergenic or something like that. Have you tried soy? It might give him gas again but it doesn't have the cow's milk protein in it, I don't think.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	Spit up in normal, throw up is not.  It sounds like he may have infant reflux.  You can help this by only feeding him an ounce or two at a time, then burping him.  Keep him upright for 20-30 minutes after he eats, and give him a pacifier for 30 minutes every time he finishes eating.  This helps the food keep going down and get past the flapper that is not developed yet.  Also, it helps to sleep him upright a little bit for a couple months, either in a bouncy seat or in his infant car seat.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	I know you said it's shooting out of him but is he gagging before/during the throwing up?  If he's not gagging then it's probably just spit up, which is not a problem.  You could try the Similac Sensitive RS which is for spit up specifically.  Honestly though, I would call your doctor and talk to them--plus, they might be able to give you some free formula to try.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|RPc63EK2aa	did u burp him after feeding... or even after 2 oz of formula burp him, after burping feed him again...when my son is 5 week old he used to be like that, he has gas also...he cries when he throwing up...just burp him every after feeding...hope ur little will be ok...|`|k2heQRKFaa	My baby was doing it, her doc said it was reflux. tell your ped that can prescribe some meds it may help..either way tell the doc.|`|Q49EEdzbaa	He probabaly is acid reflux; and his milk need to be changed because whatever he's drinking it might too heavy for his little tummy!|`|s2fQf3LXaa	talk to his ped. might just mean his belly doesn't set well with the formula he is on. may need to switch to a different brand.|`|mFQydvncaa	It could be acid reflux, my son had it and had to be switched to a different formula, lacto free. It could also be lactose problems. Call your doctor because if hes isnt holding food then its not good for him.<br>  <br>  when my son threw up it was a lot and it was gross. He would just vomit fiercly like someone compared it to excorcist. It was bad! the new formula worked and when it cam time for milk 2% was what he was on instead of whole. Hes fine now. I still avoid whole milk as we have had an incident over the years.<br>  <br>  Goodluck and i hope he feels better!

Mozz's kids are ADORABLE and not starved on vegan food. thank you very much!|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Uh, nope.  If that was the case then I think half of American needs counseling.  I wonder the same thing about calling the banks or giving out private info.  You never know who is listening, especially if you live within 100 miles of a military base.  They listen in on ALL phone calls within 100 miles of a military base.  Creepy huh?  Of course it's done for the safety of the soldiers and to keep tabs on potential threats.<br>  <br>  By the way, forget the stale brownies.... I've got a craving for stale Doritos!!! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  *So Sweetgrass is your troll?  Welcome to the club.

I doubt they would listen to yours and even if they did, I don't think they would care about your bank info.<br>  <br>  On a related note, I do think you need counseling about the tin foil hat thing, lol!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	well if the yahoos told you it must be true.  that is what answers has taught me.<br>  i think they are sending me there next week, i just have to finish my beer and fritos diet to prove them wrong.<br>  <br>  smile well so far i've lost my double chin but i've gained a beer belly.  need to rework the details.  maybe lite beer?  or straight vodka?  although i think the kids may mistake the vodka for water and that could be bad.  hmmm maybe margaritas and fritos?|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Yep, I'm sorry to say, but only a crazy person would think they could use their cell phone to make calls!

a74b14a2df8f491b94ca062ec6bd8e23aa	I only kept the ones in good condition, or that were absolute favorites just in case we have more kids. But the ones that were either hardly used (for lack of interest), too annoying, too difficult, or just wore out I either (color faded drastically, stickers peeled/were gone etc.) gave them to another family, sold them at a garage sale, then if there were any left over I donated them. Not broken toys though, I just tossed those.|`|AA11109728	I have kept all the ones my daughter has.  I consider the fact that I may have more kids in the future, so I see no point in getting rid of them.  A lot of them were gifts from relatives, I would never want to spend the money to replace them, I'd be bankrupt!  LOL  I even got all my major baby things in neutral colors when I registered for my baby shower, so I'd have all the basics in the future if I had more kids, whether I had boys or girls.

The only toys we have that they have outgrown are the ones that are the "first" favorite toy they had as very young infants. We sometimes will have a garage sale or I usually head over to the children's resale store. We don't plan on having anymore kids. If you do plan on having more kids you may want to hang on to the ones that can be cleaned easily and thoroughly (in case they are in your attic for a long time).|`|FWh5oCcMaa	I had the same dilemma a few years ago when we were moving.  I decided to keep the sturdy toys and to throw out all of the happy meal toys, the toys that were damaged at all, or toys that my first 2 children just didn't really love.  If I remembered that something didn't work on the toys, I threw them out.  I was being a pack-rat, and I didn't like that.  I figured it was worth it to me not to pack away most of the stuff - I'd rather by new than to keep less-than-par toys around...<br>  <br>  That's just what I did!  Hope that helps you at all.|`|488edafbffd854a7df677efa90768cabaa	If you plan on having another baby in the next year or so, I'd keep them but only the really good ones.

We figure the smaller toys will be out-dated by the time we have baby # 2 and the smaller stuff is easier/cheaper to replace.  I'm sure we'll get some stuff back from the family members too.  We hung on to the larger items like the Jumperoo and swing (along with the baby carrier and stroller set, high chair, pack and play, etc...).  My mother-in-law even told us to sell the smaller stuff...she said she would buy new stuff for a new baby whenever we have another one LOL...maybe that's her way of pushing us to have baby # 2 sooner?? LOL|`|IybV1Enwaa	It depends on my kids. If they still love the toys for which they have truly outgrown I keep them. Otherwise I recycle them. I don't have family members here.

Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) is a symptom of a lot of hormonal imbalances, including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Most of these are treatable, but you are going to need the help of a fertility specialist to get it. So please, request a referral and start the road.

How well could you possibly know a girl after 2 hours? Enough to sleep with her? This is the point I'm trying to get across. What these people seem to not understand is, is that you are sharing your body with someone when you have sex. Plenty of bad things could happen when you do this. How much thought could you possibly give this in what, 2 hours? Oh, and butterflylover, I'm quite capable of speaking on my own behalf. I appreciate the help, but I'm not in any real need of it, so thanks, but no thanks. So as of Jul 26, 2006 do what ya' want. You wanna bang sluts after 10 minutes, go right ahead.

Usually it is around day 14 (Day one being when you start your period), but since you have such irregular cycles it is hard to say. You really should chart your temperatures to get an idea of exactly when you ovulate, the length of your cycle, etc. There is a great book that explains ALL of this-  "Taking Charge of your Fertility" it will help you predict more closely when you are most fertile.<br>  <br>  It takes more than just ovulation to get pregnant, you also have to have the right cervical mucous to help the sperm travel up through the cervix and meet the egg. You can check your discharge and see when you get an  "Egg-White Cervical Mucous" - it is the consistancy of egg whites and will be very strietchy when you put it between your fingers. Your cervix should also be open and low, you can check your cervix daily and start to notice when it is low. <br>  <br>  You can start testing 10 days after ovulation, but it might be negative for several days even if you are pregnant, so keep testing until you get your period. Even if you are a few days late for your period it still might show negative.
mc6YtaRbaa	I think it's funny how the number of days in your cycle can make such a big difference. I have a 32 day cycle, my LMP was 9/14, same as yours and I'm due 6/26. When I calculate yours it shows you conceived around 9/22 (I conceived 10/3) and you are 24 weeks and 4 days (I am 24 weeks today). Here's the link to the calculator I used.

I used FAM to not get pregnant for two years, and then used it for one month to get pregnant  ;)  I have wacky cycles, so it really helped to know when I was going to ovulate, and when I DID ovulate.  In that respect, it also saved me a ton of money on pregnancy tests because I knew when to test, rather than having to guess  ;)<br>  <br>  Email me if you have any questions or anything.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|d4e65d749a7d0c2810dbf2b198877cdcaa	What is Fertility Awareness? <br>  <br>  Fertility Awareness Method (FAM) is a collection of practices that help a woman know which days of the month she is most likely to get pregnant. A woman can learn when ovulation is coming by observing her own body and and charting physical changes. She can then use this information to avoid or encourage pregnancy. The most effective way to discover YOUR fertile time is to practice all of the techniques described here.<br>  <br>  Fertility Awareness increases a woman’s understanding of her body and her menstrual cycle. To be effective as birth control, it requires her to abstain from intercourse or to use a barrier method of birth control during the fertile time, approximately one-third of the month.<br>  <br>  If you are want to use FAM as a method of birth control or to get pregnant, please seek additional information from the resources listed at the end. <br>  <br>  Fertility Awareness is a form of Natural Family Planning. However, the term 'Natural Family Planning' does not always mean the comprehensive approach known as Fertility Awareness Method or FAM. <br>  <br>  Fertility Awareness relies upon the following assumptions: <br>  <br>  An egg (ovum) can live inside a woman’s body for 12-24 hours. However, in calculating the fertile time we use 48 hours in case more than one egg is released. <br>  Sperm can live in a woman’s body up to 5 days after intercourse, though more often 2 days. Pregnancy is most likely if intercourse occurs anywhere from 3 days before ovulation until 2-3 days after ovulation. <br>  Since the exact time of ovulation cannot be predicted, we add 2 to 3 days to the beginning and end. <br>  A woman’s fertile time (“unsafe days” if she wants to prevent pregnancy) is thus about one-third of her cycle. <br>  <br>  Calendar Charting <br>  <br>  With Calendar Charting a woman uses past menstrual cycles as a guide. She calculates the average number of days in her cycle, and estimates future fertile times. When you know the shortest and longest cycles over several months, you can use a formula to determine an estimate of your fertile time. <br>  <br>  Start by keeping a written record of your menstrual cycle for 8-12 consecutive months. Count the first day of menstruation (the first of bleeding) as "Day 1" of your cycle. <br>  <br>  Pick your longest and shortest cycles. Subtract 18 from the length of your shortest cycle and note this as the first fertile day. Subtract 11 from the length of your longest cycle and this is the last fertile day. <br>  <br>  Example: Count the number of days between Day 1 of one period and Day 1 of the next period. <br>  <br>  March  29 days  <br>  April 26 days (shortest cycle) <br>  May 30 days  <br>  June 31 days (longest cycle) <br>  July 30 days  <br>  <br>  In this example, the shortest cycle was 26 days and the longest was 31 days. Subtract 18 from 26 to get the first unsafe day, that is Day 8. Subtract 11 from 31 to get Day 20 as the last unsafe day. Therefore, Days 8-20 are the fertile time. <br>  <br>  Once you have a record of your cycles, the following table will help you determine your fertile unsafe days. <br>  <br>  Shortest Period  First Unsafe Day   Longest Period  Last Unsafe Day  <br>  21 days 3rd day  21 days 10th day <br>  22 days 4th day  22 days 11th day <br>  23 days 5th day  23 days 12th day <br>  24 days 6th day  24 days 13th day <br>  25 days 7th day  25 days 14th day <br>  26 days 8th day  26 days 15th day <br>  27 days 9th day  27 days 16th day <br>  28 days 10th day  28 days 17th day <br>  29 days 11th day  29 days 18th day <br>  30 days 12th day  30 days 19th day <br>  31 days 13th day  31 days 20th day <br>  32 days 15th day  32 days 21st day <br>  33 days 15th day  33 days 22nd day <br>  34 days 16th day  34 days 23rd day <br>  35 days 17th day  35 days 24th day <br>  36 days 18th day  36 days 25th day <br>  <br>  Using the above chart for another example, if a woman's menstrual record shows her shortest cycle was 25 days and her longest was 30 days, her unsafe fertile days are Day 7 up to and including Day 19, counting from Day 1 as the first day of her period.<br>  <br>  Each month add the number of days between periods to the chart and re-calculate your predictions of fertile times. As your chart grows, cross off the oldest cycles and only consider the past 12 months.<br>  <br>  How fertility awarness works.<br>  <br>  Pregnancy is prevented by not having sexual intercourse during the unsafe fertile time, or by using a barrier method such as male condom, female condom, cervical cap, or diaphragram.Alternatively, if a woman wants to get pregnant, she can know when is the most likely time. <br>  The more regular a woman's cycle, the more effective FAM is. FAM is most reliable for women with regular menstrual cycles. As a woman becomes more familiar with the signs of ovulation and the pattern of her menstrual cycle, FAM becomes more effective for her. <br>  <br>  for more info go to the site below.<br>  <br>  <br>  ps. my friends mom used one. (she wanted a boy but girls kept on popping out.)|`|3d3d6f7a11f95257a6a4733dc548ac1daa	nope!, haven't tried that one!

Please make an appointment.|`|db0d074804147121c0060f55effede1aaa	No, I didn't have a discharge. You could be ovulating or it could be an infection.  Not all infections have a smell initially.
b3571242ce7bcad1d85a8ae85156993eaa	Have you done interuterine inseminations yet?  That is usually the next step.  It is when your partner's sperm is prepared and placed directly into your uterus.  It helps if you have a cervix that is keeping out his sperm, or if he has sperm motility issues.  They usually do IUIs with clomid or injectable drugs to get several eggs to increase the chance of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I am curious what your history is.  Have you actually done any testing, like an HSG, ultrasounds, and blood hormone tests?  Have those tests given you any answers to a possible diagnosis?<br>  <br>  I would say that you are very smart to want a more proactive approach to getting pregnant.  Thirty-five is by no means old, but time is limited and the more aggressive you are at this point, the better.<br>  <br>  I would highly recommend seeing an RE (reproductive endocrinologist) if you haven't already.  It is such a specialized field that most OBGYNs know very little about it, and rely to heavily on clomid.  <br>  <br>  It is NOT HOPELESS!  You still have a great chance of getting pregnant, especially if you get the right help and treatment.  Also, you may want to check out the IUI and IVF boards at www.fertilthoughts.net.  The women there are very supportive and knowledgeable, and you will get a lot of answers to your questions.  <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck and hope you get your positive result soon.|`|9534e0fae1aa5c05b90b3b4f0352df99aa	www.newbabyjubilee.com has a section labelled 'infertility' that has info on male and female infertility.

It is a known fact that there is ALWAYS a chance of pregnancy whenever a couple has sex.  Even if there is birth control involved.  Obviously those who would believe the guy got "trapped" are undereducated about birth control as well as the human body.  I wouldn't pay them much attention.|`|46ed2f6850d4c9650ffadabf993b7477aa	Well, some people are still living in the 50's and in the 50's if you got a girl pregnant then you just had to stay with her and marry her.

His family somehow conviced him that I did it to trap him and I was after his money (until they said that I didn't know he had any).. anyway they convinced him this was true. He loved me for 3 years, even though we hadn't even dated 6 months.. we were house shopping and talking marriage.. and his family got to him. He dissapeared. Wouldn't answer the phone, wouldn't pay money, wouldn't see me, nothing. One day he just stood me up for a date. The last time I saw him we were sitting on the porch and he gave me a dozen roses and told me that i was more beautiful then them. He kissed me and said 'see ya Saturday'. We were going to make a plan on saturday about how to handle his family. That was the last I heard from him. I took him to court for child support cause he wouldn't answer my phone calls. So he started working under the table.. so i don't get anything anymore... He has never seen her. In fact, I haven't seen him since I was 2 months pregnant... So, can you trap a guy? I wasn't trying to, but my experience tells me.. no way. You can't trap anyone that doesn't want to be caught|`|AA11996902	I totally disagree with you.

I adore the children and in fact we have custody because when she decided to leave my son who is on a sub in the Navy she wanted to go back to school.  So she gave the kids to us, they were 2 and 3.  She says she wants them back this summer, but she just got a job as a manager so she will not have regular hours.  Anyway, that is complicated but you can't say that someone can't get pregnant on purpose.  She assured my son that she was on birth control.  Yes, he shouldn't have believed her but he was naive.|`|ebabf74022d415417c42e0fa1c2bc098aa	Well believe it or not some women want to keep a man so bad they dont take BC and dont tell the guy. Therefore, he thinks hes covered then finds out he is going to be a daddy. Respectable men want to be full time dads and would therefore stay with the woman even without loving her then he is TRAPPED. People are nuts. Doesnt mean you did it but it does happen and people are prone to think the worst of everyone. Best of luck!|`|9a459a45e5cba3a950e99cb6694af8a9aa	i had the same thing happend to me..his parents and family said i trapped him, yet we both knew i wasnt on BC and he still decided to finish inside..we also didnt care what ppl said..his family had said they werent going to accept the baby.. now we have a 4 year old boy and his family adores him to death...so dont worry about the family, either way, ur with him not his family...good luck|`|d8e7e8374f3b0f298fde02b08dc0e2a8aa	society has conditioned ppl to always think the worst of women. i haven't heard of the woman yet who forced the man to have unprotected sex w/her in order to get pregnant. men don't want to be responsible so it's easy to say "she told me she was on the pill. she tricked me." If a man doesn't want a child, he has to take the lead & WEAR A CONDOM!! Children are a lifetime responsibility--sex is not the time to take her word that she's on something.

5UOL2y6Qaa	Because they are not looking at the uterus but putting two fingers in there, it's a guessing game to estimate how much you have dilated, but it is normal.|`|7adf91b49418e819899354352edbcb3daa	Iwent back and forth between 3-4 cm dilated for like 2 weeks before my son was born. I think it can be perfectly normal. I think part of the issue may be their inconsistency in measuring. Try walking, having sex, and eating spicy foods. This can help move things along. Also before getting induced (which can bring up lots of complications with your baby- Pitocin sucks) you may ask your doctor to "strip your membranes" it isn't painful and it can put you into labor- worked like a charm for me in both pregnancies! Good luck...|`|gLrDZKKhaa	i had then tell me i was 3 cm one time and then 2 1/2 another. basically they're just guessing. i talked to an girl in school for obstetrics and gynecology. basically she held up her hand with four fingers in a row - she said to me, "this is 10 cm" (which made me want to puke!) and then from there she split up her fingers, one, two, three equalled 2, 4, 8 cm... They're guessing! Maybe they pushed a bit for 3cm.... The doctor might have been generous ...|`|cff569ed5ceca9804e0f00792af2b47daa	You're "kinda" overdue?  If you're really overdue, then why is it more than another week before you're getting induced...?
3834a20f7f3cce655a7beeba92c29db0aa	she may very well want him back,first off he needs a DNA test to make sure that he is the daddy.Then he does need to be a part of the baby's life but not hers,he does not need to take her any where that's up to her to worry about not him.The baby sitting is fine he should be in the baby's life and have visitation if it's his,but there is such a thing as joint custody,but there is no way to be a full time dad and not live in the home with the mother and child,especially since they live so far apart,if they were closer together then they might make it work out but we are talking about no more than 15-20 mins apart at the most plus they would have to work diff. shifts to make sure the other is available at all times.the standard rule with courts are either joint custody where the mother has the child 1 week then the father has the child the next,but most courts will not even consider this until the child is 2,so the only other thing is visitation,where he would see the child a set number of days during the week and then every other week end he would pick the baby up on friday and return the baby on sunday,but i also think that for over night visitation the child has to be a little older unless the 2 parents agree on a parenting plain and then have in entered into the court records and signed by a judge so as to protect them self's.hope this helps out some good luck and best wishes|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	well it's just like with any couple that gets a divorce. my father was still a full time dad when i lived with my mother when i was little. every weekend was ours andhe would call to check up on us kids and take me to doctor appt when my mother couldn't and bring me fun places and everything like that. once you're a dad you're a full time dad you can't just be a part time dad.  if you're gonna slack you mind as well do nothing. There is nothing you can do he has a kid now and it's his responsibility, try to be good to the child too and give him love so he likes spending time with you<br>  PS don't feel that you Should be included in the trips because it's his kid not yours and you're not really his wife yet or anything, he should eb able to spend some alone time with his child<br>  OH AND SUNSHINE THERE IS NO SET AGE ON EVERNIGHT VISITS WITH THE CHILD.  mY LITTLE SISTER WAS LESS THAN TWO AND WE STAYED WITH MY FATHER EVERY WEEKEND PER COURT ORDER. THERE IS NO AGE REQUIREMENT I DO'T KNWO WHERE YOU GOT THAT FROM. THE FATHER HAS RIGHTS TO VISIT AND TAKE THE CHILD AT ANY AGE|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	Having a baby is hard work.  I suppose she feels that as the child is his responsibility, he should put in half the work. I can't say i blame her.  I wouldn't want to be a single mother with a new baby again (my husband walked out when my son was 4 months old.)<br>  I suppose the solution is a question.  What does your boyfriend want?<br>  I have a friend who lives in the next street from her ex-husband.  Although they cordially loathe each other, they are always there for the children.  It's quite impressive.  What a pity they couldn't work out their relationship so easily when they were married!|`|67a9a1a0a07127c002c465e1db642cbcaa	yeah i would be careful in this situation. It does sound like she wants him back but then again she may just want him to be in the child's life. Maybe you can go along to visit with the baby or let your boyfriend pick up the baby and take him to your house so you can both take care of the baby together.|`|DHz46NJUaa	Move closer. He needs to be a full time dad. He needs to pay support, and be there for his child.<br>  <br>  <br>  Atleast she is trying to involve him..... My ex has nothing to do with our kids, doesnt come see them or pay support.|`|c4spQiCvaa	i think he should take care of it half of the time and her the other.oo yeah and split teh weekends|`|lY4P1HCJaa	I think he has a financial obligation and also to visit periodically, but anything more than that he wants to do, he should include you in these trips, so everyone knows where they stand

Oder wenn seine Kleidung nicht in die W?sche gebracht werden und gewaschen werden, es irgendwann keine mehr zum Anziehen h?tte...<br>  <br>  Ausserdem ist Zwang etwas schlimmes, dagegen lehnen sicher gerade die Teenies gerne auf. Wenn man einen Sinn dahinter sieht, und es als etwas selbstverst?ndliches begreift, ist das kein Thema.

So the Yacht went on. The fisherman was continuing to pray when a Cruise ship came by and they too saw him and offered him help. The fisherman again refused the help telling the people on the cruise ship that he didn't need help because God was going to rescue him. The cruise ship went on with out the fisherman. The fisherman continued to pray and soon the Coast guard came and offered to take him out of the water insisting that they wanted to help him. The fisherman again replied no that God was certainly going to rescue him. So the coast guard went on. the man fell asleep and awoke to find himself in the presence of God and he was a bit confused as to why he was there, so he asked God I thought you were going to rescue me. God replied I tried to rescue you but you refused the yacht, the cruise ship, and then I sent the coast guard and you still refused it, I tried to rescue you but you refused to be rescued. <br>  <br>  The moral of this tall tale is that God may work in mysterious ways but if he offers you a practical tool to use to your advantage then use it.|`|acedb3aca1cff3e81ca2191c8b6e968caa	some smart guy sent me all his money<br>  I was so happy|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	Go with Bills, his was the best.

7IG5Me0Baa	My daughter was almost completely potty trained at 2 also.  Then, we moved and she stopped.  We started over only to have her stop again when we told her we were going to have a new baby.  This time, she refused to wear pull-ups, requesting only "regular" diapers and she told us she was the baby.  UGH!<br>  <br>  Many years ago, I had read a book that said to try potty training for one week only.  If they aren't trained in one week, they aren't ready.  Stop and try again in 4-6 weeks.  So, after the second incident of her stopping completely, I started over.  Every 4 weeks, I tried.  She totally refused.  One day, she took her panties off, climbed under the dining room table and peed and then came and told me so I would have to clean it up.  She was obviously in control of this game.  I was losing so I quit.  Every so often, I would try to see if she would use the potty but she refused and I didn't bother her about it.  About two months ago (at 30 months), she came to me and said she didn't want to wear diapers anymore.  Just like that, she was potty trained.  She was ready.  In the last two months, the only 2 accidents she has had have been when we were at other people's homes and she was playing and didn't know where the bathroom was.  She is even waking up from nap and bedtime dry.<br>  <br>  So...my advice is to wait until she is ready.  Eventually, it will click for her and she will want to go.  Try every so often to see if she will make an attempt and if not, just relax.  As far as I know, no one ever graduates with diapers on!  Seriously, this way was much less stress for me.  No tears, no bribes, no begging.  And, you should know that I am a type A personality who has a list and tries to organize everything.  I am slowly learning that my children's world can't be controlled.  Rather than having both of us stressed about it, I just decided to let her go on her own terms.|`|3efc88b6d1e86689afa5e830a0c8bc11aa	I must admit that I don't know this from personal experience, but a friend of mine decided to do something that she saw on Dr. Phil and it worked out great.  She told her child that if she went "potty" in the toilet there would be a party.  When her child did, she actually threw a little party right away.  She had the balloons, cake, and etc. all ready for that moment.  I think she ended up doing the party like 5 times and then she was trained from then on.  <br>  Good luck!|`|7174763c92796ebc49e8e823013bfc35aa	Well by the sounds of it, if she did it before then the lack of it now has to do with you. The trama probably devistated both of you and at the time, her going to the bathroom wasn't important. I have to say that her going before she was 2 is very good :) My son is 2 and he is just starting to try it lol  I know boys are different then girls though. If you think her stop using the bathroom has to do with the dad, then I think a good idea whould be have the dad start her again. If he can't get up, or something like that because of the accident then get him to talk to her. He can tell her how much it would make him happy if she continued to use the potty. That may mean alot to her.<br>  <br>  You have to think, she might be scared that when she comes out of the bathroom her dad wont be there -  so she don't want to go. Do you know what I mean? If the dad can stand outside the door that would be great. But if he can then maybe he can talk while she is in there that way she knows that he is still there and you can be in there with her and tell her that her daddy is still there too :)  Good luck|`|TqHD6wOYaa	She's not wearing pull-ups or anything still I hope.  If so get rid of them, it takes longer to potty train with them anyways.  I never used them!  Honestly, though, just use underwear.  If she has an accident in underwear she'll feel it more then in a pull-up and get really uncomfortable, most likely making her want to use the potty next time.  I'm not saying that an accident won't happen again, but you'll most likely have her using the potty full-time again in about a week.  Just try it and let me know.|`|EMLGfNSbaa	Well if she had just started right before dads accident, she may be connecting the two things,  It sounds ridiculous I know but kids do this.  <br>  <br>  I had to retrain my first son after his own long illness in the hospital.  2 months in the cicu.  <br>  <br>  It is harder the second time around.   <br>  <br>  Just continuously  encourage her to use the potty it will return but know it will probably take longer this time.|`|11840b0d2a64ab59d4c21c9f3fb0943aaa	from my experience (my daughter was potty trained and then stopped when i gave birth to her little brother) it's best to talk to her calmly and explain the benefits of potty training...then to remind her all the time to use the potty and when she succeeds provide positive reinforcement. if she has an accident, say it's okay accidents happen (don't yell scream or ask why or say anything negative..) if she's able to change herself have her do it..and tell her that you know that she can succeed in using the potty all the time...reassure, encourage and provide positive reinforcement.  DO NOT REACT NEGATIVELY to any accident and given consistency in your behavior and time she will be succeed!!  and if she's showing signs that she's not ready and she doesn't want to..DON'T PUSH IT.   When she's ready she'll do it on her own.

If you are eating peppers you could be lacking vitamin c, just an example. When I was pregnant I wanted peaches and anything spicy, that's when I started putting hot sauce on everything and ate my first jalapeno peppers.  When my mom was pregnant with me she graved collard greens with lots of Tabasco sauce and whole peppers.|`|d1b1061ad9fd09c6983137171141fe43aa	I craved pickled ginger with my first pregnancy.

4ssDftz3aa	Glands inside your vagina and cervix make small amounts of fluid. This fluid flows out of the vagina each day, carrying out old cells that have lined the vagina. This is your body's way of keeping your vagina healthy and clean. The discharge is usually clear or milky and doesn't smell bad.<br>  <br>  The color and thickness of the discharge changes with your monthly cycle. The discharge is thicker when you ovulate or you breastfeed or when you're sexually excited. Changes that may signal that something is wrong include an increase in the amount of discharge, a change in the color. These changes can occur if the normal balance of healthy bacteria in your vagina is upset. Many things can disturb the balance of a healthy vagina, including douching, feminine hygiene sprays, certain soaps or bubble baths, antibiotics, diabetes, pregnancy, infections, aging and intercourse. or smell of the discharge, and irritation, itchiness or burning in or around your vagina. This is called vaginitis. A discharge that's stained with blood when you're not having your period could also be a sign of a problem. These signs may need to be checked by your doctor.<br>  <br>  Douching is not a good way to correct this problem, and may cause more harm then good if you have any problems. Usually the vagina has a smell, but it should not be strong or unpleasant, if it is, you should go to your doctor.|`|AA11708436	The black girl is wrong, yeast infections have no odor, just looks like cottage cheese discharge.|`|08e5198d38650bee57178cd218461a3daa	if you have a fishy smell that is probably a yeast infection.  you dont have a smell when you ovulate. that is just weird.
d3738eb514750f43107214065eba5810aa	I have done a few long trips with my daughter - an 800 mile trip when she was 10 months for vacation (that was 16 hours!), and a couple of 6 hour trips to visit with my husband's grandparents.<br>  <br>  When you are on the road, you should have someone sit in the backseat if possible.  That way, someone is there to keep your child entertained while you drive.  Be sure to bring enough sippy cups/bottles, snacks, and diapers within easy reach as you drive.  Be sure to make frequent rest stops along the way so everyone, including the baby can get out and stretch (if the baby is walking, let him walk around for a few minutes).  If you will be on the road during a mealtime, make a complete stop at a restaurant rather than hitting the drive through.  The change of scenery is good for everyone.  And if possible, try to work it so part of your trip occurs during naptime :)|`|9f38db29a31bdd91f3bba66fada40705aa	music could help, fisher price makes a kid tough mp3 player, but I am nto sure on the age but if your watching him he might just kick it with the tunes and save you the sanity of children's songs the whole 2000 miles. Also maybe a doodle pad I think thats what they are called the ones that have the magnetic pen and you draw and erase.

I work at a day care. One of the MOST IMPORTANT things to remember is to keep the temperature around 68 or so. If children get to warm they get real fussy and they do not sleep well. All of our training for day care stresses this point. Parents seem to think for the most part that their children get cold easily, when in fact the adult will most likely get cold first. It is best to have cooler air and a nice soft blanket for warmth but not to warm.  Also when it comes to books and movies at that age they just need to be colorful and busy. Music and dancing are good movies for children. If a child can not hear the sound well, they will lose interest fast.|`|47fc0c9f64b52632d8a149e9ada9f006aa	At the beginning of January, I took a 30 hour Greyhound trip by myself with my two kids, ages 18.5 months and 5.5 months...it was interesting. I won't ever do it again but that was mostly because I didn't have any help. My advice?... keep lots of healthy snacks on hand, lots of juice, milk and water...and toys and books. I'm sure that he'll be fine. Most kids sleep on long car rides so you may get lucky. I wish you the best...good luck for a peaceful road trip!!!|`|7P5pQZdCaa	i hear ya :) we drove from LA to Aspen with our little bug at the same age, he slept a lot of the time, he just really got uncomfortable and crabby at the end of the trip, it took us 17 hours to get there. have a few toys stashed that he's never seen so they are totally new and interesting to him, definately give him something with lights, maybe even a little flash light for when its dark. best of luck, be safe :)|`|aa4c3fbc2386cee5e15832eb9767d1beaa	Bring a bag of toys.  The key is to get stuff that isn't too small or has too many pieces.  My kids usually take one stuffed animal and some stuff to go with it like a play bottle and a blanket.  They also had some great soft cloth books when they were little that were great in the car.  The books had animals that snapped in, were tied in with string, etc.  The plastic rings that hook together are also good in the car because the kid can play with them, chew on them, or use them to hook other toys to the car seat.  The kid doesn't really need much at that age if you rotate the toys.  Also, I hate to say it but sitting in the back with baby helps.  Bring music - stuff you can sing to the baby.  It doesn't have to be kid music.  My kids liked it when I sang to them and moved my body or theirs - clapping, kicking the baby's feet, etc.|`|7yw2zR2vaa	The dvd thing will really come in handy!!<br>  <br>  Make sure you stop at normal times for meals and keep his sleep schedule the same - ie stop for the night when he would normally be getting a bath and going to bed.

Some new boooks if he likes to look at them.  And pack some special treats he normally doesnt get a lot that are easy to eat. (Gerber puffs, goldfish crackers, mini marshmellows but limit these due to sugar).<br>  <br>  We took our little girl on a 14 hr trip and these things seemed to help.  Her doc said if she got really fussy we could give her 1/2 tsp of bennedryl to make her drowsy to sleep...but honestly we never had to do that btwn the dvds and the books/toys/snacks.|`|ebff8326b07c2e16c3e72b34dc962f62aa	The DVD player is good advise, just be prepared to make alot of stops. Don't try to push too hard it may be too stressful for the little one. We drive several hundred miles to get back to our hometown and visit once and a while and it takes us at least one stop from here to there..... Also, a good peace of advise that I learned the "hard way" you may want to consider putting a diaper doubler in the baby's diaper or put a towel or "Huggies absorbent changing pad" down in the car seat because for some reason they tend to drink more and diapers tend to leak at the worst times! It will save lot's of heartache and time trying to be prepared before hand. Also having healthy snacks on hand is a good diversion for cranky kids. (Gerber "stars" that melt away in the mouth is a "safer" choice)|`|evOa77n7aa	Keep it simple.. but always have something new that you can pull out of your hat when it gets stressful.. otherwise.. cheerios and singing out loud and reading out loud and understanding the issues of being 1 stuck in a car.. always get them out and about as their bodies will fall asleep on them..|`|f1aeb060482bc42b1349d3aee701e30faa	I have traveled with my kids before and omg it was crazy... Heres some things that might help.... Try to leave late at night ar really early so he will sleep the first few hours....bring lots of snacks (if you allow him to eat in your car) ..... movies..... if one of you sits with him in the backseat and do like flash cards with say elmo on them that will help...... a few small toys he can play with on his own..... 2 stuffed animals so you can do a "play" with them while one of you is driving..... things like that . But, I do know from experience that if I ever travel with my small children again I will bring lots more things to entertain them then I did the first time. I also noticed the more you get out of the car, the more they want to stay out and play... so I suggest the least amount of stops as possible.  Hope this helps and have a good trip!!|`|fbf7a0218ad796311e2571268fcb04d4aa	We used to travel at night when our daughter was that age.  She would sleep most of the time and we would switch driving every couple of hours.  Otherwise the DVD player is a good way to go.  Good luck!  :)
4ssDftz3aa	I stopped using the Nuva Ring as well, for a few different reasons. Yes there was a problem with my husband feeling it, but it also would hit my cervix during intercourse (OUCH). I also found it difficult to remove. If you're looking for a good method of birth control, I'd say the pill. But they have to be taken every day, so for some people that is not the best option. I have looked into getting an IUD (Inter uterine Device) which is placed in the uterus and is a very reliable method. It is also semi-permanent and must be inserted and removed by a doctor. I like that option because then I don't have to worry about it and it's undetectable by my partner. I have not found any side effects when I stopped using the Nuva Ring. Good luck!|`|f97ee7c48773a252b6b12d7c9f7f965faa	It made me gain a lot of wait within the first month so I stopped using it.

AA11107013	sounds like that may have been what it was.  here is an article i found on www.ivillage.com about implantation bleeding.<br>  <br>  How can I tell the difference between an early period and implantation bleeding? <br>  <br>   <br>  I would suspect implantation bleeding if it occurs a bit earlier than expected, if it were scanty, spotty, pinkish and not red and heavy like a period, and does not follow the normal pattern of a period (light to heavy to light). <br>  <br>  The BBT should remain elevated and not decline to preovulatory levels. <br>  <br>  There is often the feeling that it is a period with light cramps and bloating, but the bleeding is shorter, lighter and just not normal. <br>  <br>  If a woman is usually regular, and now all of a sudden develops this type of early spotting, and of course is "at risk" for a pregnancy, I would strongly suspect conception.|`|AA11017606	sounds like implantation to me.|`|9f38db29a31bdd91f3bba66fada40705aa	It could have been a cyst bursting...You should go see a doctor and tell him what is going on...
384addac3bd109ce34b6a4811df9ff02aa	Ciao Debora.<br>  Ho la bellezza di 36 anni e in passato (ora diciamo che ho messo la testa a posto), ero un vero e proprio "sciupafemmine". Me ne pento molto, in quanto ho fatto soffrire molte donne, e qualcuna magari non lo meritava nemmeno (una sorta di vendetta la mia, dopo una mazzata ricevuta)...<br>  Non vorrei attirarmi la rabbia delle gentili donzelle in linea, ma a me piace molto la sincerità e odio l'ipocrisia, quindi inutile per me dire falsità.<br>  Questa premessa serve solo per farti capire che non sono proprio di primo pelo e che quindi ho abbastanza esperienza sia per l'età, che non è un dato trascurabile per queste cose, sia per farti capire che ne ho passate tante...<br>  Accetta pure il consiglio che ti sembra più giusto, almeno se un giorno ti accorgerai di avere sbagliato, non dovrai incolpare nessuno se non te stessa.<br>  <br>  Leggi attentamente ciò che Trottola ha scritto. Anche lei è una persona piena di maturità ed esperienza. Le sue parole sono adatte.<br>  Non vorrei sputare sentenze, ma vi parlo come un fratello maggiore.<br>  Mi rivolgo a Giuseppe T, Roberto R e Martix. Ho letto che tutti e tre avete dato un obbiettivo. Chi o cosa vi ha fatto pensare che l'età giusta è quella da voi descritta? Chi non bacia o fa sesso nella fascia di età da voi scelta è un "fuoriluogo"? Potete pure smentire me e tanti altri answeriani più maturi (non solo d'età), che hanno deciso di scrivere a Debora una opinione veramente saggia, ma in quel caso sarebbe giusto che ci deste un riferimento. Dove avete letto una cosa simile? Quale scienziato pazzo, o psicologo psicolabile potrebbe mai affermare castroneria più grossa?<br>  <br>  Debora, sei giovanissima! Ascolta un "vecchio" come me... Uno che ha sbagliato tanto nella vita e che probabilmente continuerà ancora a commettere qualche errore. Uno che però nella zucca ha un po' di sale e che cerca di aiutare i ragazzi e ragazze come te a non fare gli errori (che per esperienza vissuta), di cui un giorno potresti pentirtene amaramente... Poi, sicuramente qualche sbaglio lo farai ed è giusto che sià così, è il corso della vita, ma ci sono errori dove rimediare risulterà impossibile. <br>  <br>   Quando incontrerai una persona che, oltre a farti battere forte il cuore, ti darà anche sicurezza e senso di ammirazione, oltre che rispetto, allora quella persona, quel ragazzo, quel momento sarà giusto! Se userai la testa ma soprettutto il cuore, ricorderai quel bacio, o più in la, quel "gesto di amore", che nulla ha a che fare con del semplice sesso, come una delle esperienze più indimenticabili della tua vita, anche se non la più bella.

Allora, in primis più che un figlio avrai un fratellino da tirare su e la cosa ti piacerà immensamente. Felicitazioni! Fortunatamente la società del 2000 non è quella del secolo scorso e questi fatti non creano alcun pregiudizio verso le persone...anzi! Si riscuote una generale benevolenza! <br>  Secondo.... anche se non ti interessa più, è assolutamente opportuno che tu informi i genitori del ragazzo che ti ha messo incinta del fatto...  sia che sia minorenne (come credo) che leggermente maggiorenne (non credo che in questo caso possa avere molto più di 18 anni) perchè in ogni caso è morale che tuo figlio abbia la certezza che sua madre ha tentato il tutto per tutto per fargli avere un legame seppur labile col padre (anche se tu non lo vuoi) responsabilizzandolo e quindi facendolo partecipare economicamente alla sua crescita. Infatti i genitori del ragazzo "padre" anche se lui è maggiorenni, sono eticamente responsabili della morale impartita a loro figlio e quindi è bene che anche loro siano investiti e si sentano afflitti dalla loro fetta di colpe  (che io personalmente non gli risparmierei). <br>  Ultimo punto... il nuovo ragazzo...  beh... glielo devi dire... presto, appena ti senti pronta... e devi anche pensare bene come parlargli....  ma non ti affliggere se ti lascia... non mi meraviglierebbe perchè in ogni caso sarete entrambi molto giovani e coinvolti in un fatto che comporta delle responsabilità che in genere si è pronti ad assumersi solo quando si è un bel po' più grandi...<br>  Tu in ogni caso tra pochi mesi sarai molto presa dal tuo bambolotto...  e per qualche tempo la tua testa non sarà molto più interessata alle storie d'amore...perchè ne avrai una in casa totalmente appagante. Appena raggiunto un nuovo equilibrio, appena il tuo bimbo non ti assillerà più con i pannolini e le poppate, avrai nuovamente lo spirito per trovare un nuovo amore e con una maturità diversa.....<br>  Auguri di cuore.|`|7d650a93ce397ab09b97bad984f05af1aa	Devi dirglielo assolutamente, come puoi nascondere una cosa così delicata?? cmq sei giovanissima, non temere, andrà tutto bene.

Per ciò che concerne il tuo nuovo ragazzo, ti consiglio di dirgli tutto, ricorda più il tempo passa e più le cose diventano difficili per te e sopratutto per lui. Comunque poni questa domanda anche a tuoi genitori, vedrai che sapranno consigliarti la cosa giusta. Dopotutto se ti ama dovrebbe capire e rimanerti vicino. In bocca al lupo.|`|a9a8ca98230306d04b97a1c633cd3df9aa	Quanto tempo fa ti ha lasciato il primo ragazzo?Come facciamo ad aiutarti se non sappiamo nessun dettaglio della tua storia?Penso che ti sei messa troppo presto con un'altro prima di risolvere il problema di cosa fare con il bambino e di cosa vuoi fare tu.Il mondo è pieno di uomini.Ora devi pensare se vuoi tenere il bambino oppure no,se vuoi diventare mamma oppure,no.Devi scegliere tu con la massima rifflessione.Puoi se decidi di tenere il bambino,devi pensare solo a lui e alla tua salute.Con il tempo,deciderai se metterti con un'altro uomo o no.Ma i tuoi genitori ti stanno accanto?Lo sanno?Vedi quanti quesiti ci sono?E ci sono tanti altri.Se non ci dici di più,non sappiamo come aiutarti.Ciao!In bocca a lupo e pensaci molto.Non si gioca con i bambini ma neanche con la propria vita.Stammi bene!|`|c836855d09fcb9b3a09d11111e3be3ddaa	Secondo me dovresti dirglielo per correttezza e se lui ti lscia non vuol dire che di te non gli interessi niente ma solo che questa è una decisione da prendere con un pò di tempo...potrebbe avere solo paura di prendersi una grossa responsabilità...ma tanto vale dirglielo tanto tra pochi mesi lo scoprirà da solo e dopo si sentirà anche preso in giro...|`|dB8YgBZ0aa	Ciao<br>  Quello che ho capito il padre del tuo figlio ti ha lasciato il tuo fidanzato attuale non sa niente giusto??<br>  Mi fa piacere che vuoi tenere il bambino(bambina?)e tuoi ti aiutano.<br>  Bisogna dire la verità anche il tuo ragazzo ,si dice che la verità fa male  ma meglio affrontare insieme!!!Lui ha diritto di sapere la verità!!<br>  Coraggio chi non ti vuole non ti merita tanto  tuo ex <br>  ragazzo prima puoi si sentirà in colpa.Adesso forse un può spaventato,ha bisogno di tempo per abituare la idea!!<br>  Prima di tutto cerca di passare serenamente la gravidanza,il bambino non ha colpa!!!Ammettiamo che nessuno dei due(Ragazzi)non ti vuole cerca di andare avanti lo stesso,non fatti venire depressione,il tempo è il medico!!!Fatti una ragione,pensi la creatura che cresci dentro di te!!!Sono una Mamma so cosa vuol dire!!!<br>  Ti auguro tanta fortuna!!!<br>  Baci
1819c9477409a8f5ac1f383fdbd03f2faa	There are no such things as curses<br>  <br>  <br>  DO not get yourself all upset over something that isnt even true. If a child just wasnt meant to be it would have nothing to do with shopping to early. Just relax and have fun and try not too worry<br>  <br>  Everything will be fine. Maybe shopping would be good for you. It will take you mind off things|`|b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	Some religions and cultures (Judaism) believe that you do not prepare for the infant until it arrives.   That is totally against the natural nesting urge that most women develop in the third trimester.     I don't think you curse yourself by preparation.   Do what feels comfortable to you.|`|BbuC28Qcaa	Relax. You won't do yourself, or your baby, any good by worrying about the 'What if?' scenarios. Go do your shopping, maybe see a movie at the theater with your husband (fiancee/boyfriend). Take your mind off things for awhile, ask your husband (fiancee/boyfriend) to bring home a board game for you to play, or to rent a movie for you to sit and watch. Just relax and quit stressing over what has happened so far.|`|MieDCKXHaa	I started buying as soon as I found out... gender neutral of course, until we found out the sex.  Just because you're having a complicated pregnancy does not mean you will have a stillbirth.  My mom's second pregnancy was completely normal, but the baby was born stillborn (due to complications during delivery and the fact it was in a little country hospital in the early 60s).  Then, with her third pregnancy, she had bleeding in the first trimester, constant cramping pains, etc. all throughout her pregnancy and the baby (my older brother) was born perfectly healthy!  So when you see those adorable baby clothes you just absolutely have to have (especially when you catch them marked down!) buy them!  And if anything were to happen to this baby during deliver (God forbid...) there is always hope for another angel and you can just hang onto them if you'd like.  Don't think you're going to curse yourself though... enjoy your pregnancy as much as possible while you can!  God bless, and best wishes!  :)|`|c3fe7d961a46f6453626b65bcd7e7f8eaa	Sorry to hear you having such a tough time! I don't believe in cursing yourself. Sometimes the best things in life are the hardest (meaning this hard pregnancy will bring out the best thing in your life!). Whats meant to be will. Good luck and go shopping now!|`|efeee00784ef7905ec24ad8f6f95a8c4aa	You cant be stressed about losing your baby.  The mind is a powerful thing and you dont want to cause failure because your thinking about it all the time.  You are 24 weeks along, usually 3 months is the "safety" marker for most miscarriages.  So you are past the "really" dangerous time.  Go ahead and go shopping.  Relax and know in your heart you are going to have this baby and everything is going to be fine.

But only if my daughter is doing something that can hurt her and she has been told more than once to stop (2 verbal warnings, then two swats on the butt), and if she does something that she knows that she is not supposed to do(this gets 3 verbal warnings, then a time out....if she does it again, then I swat her butt).|`|ca27b7f3591b6a841f37f697b88d5f52aa	Never have and never will, I think to spank a child is abusing the child.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Yes|`|uBICgcbAaa	No I don't have kids but plan on hitting them if they don't listen to me.  It's legal in my husband's country which is good.|`|0ccf895a4d38870dbcdfabcdd0f7bf65aa	No , they get punished or grounded . Because how can you teach a child not to hit if you hit them (spank) ?|`|7840ecf42727fffe2d9179dc17a77c6eaa	Yes, We have a set of core rules (things like no lying, stealing, getting in trouble at school) which are our a major no-no in our home. If those rules are broken they will get a spanking. We also spank for dangerous situation, direct defiance, and as a last resort.<br>  <br>  Sounds like a lot, however spanking are quite rare for my girls. Once the rules are clear, they know what they can and can't get away with.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|GToIKccWaa	NO, respecting them and treating them as regular people is better. Hitting them and treating them like a rogdoll is not anyway to treat a child.<br>  Respect tham and treat them as a good humanbeing, as if they were adults, if u show them respect, they will express the smae to you. Therefore you will get a better child who does not goof off as much|`|f46d734be65f1893bcbe038f90f72545aa	no talking is the anwser no hitting its bad even super nanny said so|`|nDEgWf1Maa	Yes.  Sometimes spanking is the best thing to do.  BUT it is only one tool in your parenting toolbox.  Far more important than any spanking are things like:  guidance, love, pats on the back, hugs, praise, attention, patience, etc. etc.

Signs CAN show up before a missed period, but most are the same signs you would get if she were to have her period, so they are not reliable enough to determine pregnancy. Plus, when you want something bad enough, you will notice things you never did before in hopes that this is it. Just be patient and take a pregnancy test the day she is supposed to have her period. (you can take one up to 5 days before, but they aren't as accurate.) good luck!|`|xUwh5REGaa	Yes, yes & YES!!!<br>  Everyone is different but just wait for the test then you will know for sure.|`|6783eff5fcc328b9527aa61f6d84bcf2aa	They can also just be signs of a period coming on.  But you can have some signs this early too.  I concieved on July 28th, and by August 3rd, I felt like I was having a bladder infection.  I went in, and found out it was just a symptom of pregnacy (not everyone gets this.)  My next symptoms didn't come for quite awhile later...near mid August, which was morning sickness.  My breast didn't get sore for awhile, but everyone's pregnancy is different.  I would wait until 4 days have passed the expected period date before taking a test, so that you won't have to go out and buy a bunch of tests (I've done this before...it's hard to wait though so if you want to buy a test early...go for it, mine came out positive on the 5th of August, so it might show up this early.)  <br>  Good luck|`|3834a20f7f3cce655a7beeba92c29db0aa	not likely the baby doesnt inplant for 10 days after conception then the HCG has to build up, good luck|`|61a4283ca1ee4c77650bcf5272bc8b69aa	Its a bit to early for simptoms.

c539a4a322f3617e661edf39c6a33e8baa	Um Medicaid does cover to have your tubes tied cause they did for me.But as far as if they will do it after the baby is born or months/years after it all depends on if you are only covered while you are pregnant and for up to 6 weeks after you have the baby or if you are always covered.|`|5UOL2y6Qaa	Yes medicaid does pay to have your tubes tied. Check with your ob/gyn to find out what forms you have to fill out. With  Essure they insert a device that looks like a tiny spring into the tubes, this causes scar tissue to develop and block the tubes, however, it  takes 3 months to completely block the tubes. Depending on your age and how many children you have determines if medicaid will pay for it. Remember this is a permanent method, no going back. Because they are inserting something through your uterus they will most likely recommend that you wait at least 6 wks before you have it done to make sure all of the afterbirth is gone.|`|AA10543045	You can probably have it done anytime you are on medicaid, however it is probably best to do it right after you have given birth, you are already in the hospital, and experienced pain.

eDmdkUO3aa	This is normal. The baby could be on your bladder. I would tell your doctor at your next appt. Unless, you are having close contractions (5 min apart) there's no need to do anything until then.|`|Dfeemjagaa	yes, it's the baby pressing down|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	The baby may have 'dropped' into the birthing position and is placing pressure on everything down there. As long as you don't have pain I would say wait until next week and your next appointment but having said that if you are really worried give them a call and ask them. There isn't anything they havent heard of and if it eases your mind then its worth a phone call.
BGcVEjfGaa	Well, yeah, because of Paris Hilton Paris has become a girls name, no longer masculine at all!  <br>  However, I don't really like the name for either sex if we are talking about people. <br>  I would name a Yorkie Paris.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	i've known a boy and girl name paris, i think it sounds better for a girl.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I like it both ways.|`|KAj7GfeDaa	Actually the first time I had ever heard the name Paris was because a boy I went to high school with had that name. The next time I heard that name somewhere was Paris Hilton. I think the that in particular has become uni-sex although it was like you said initially for a male. But like alot of things it evolved and it makes no difference to me.|`|auZFHKZTaa	if you name a boy paris...he will get beat up at school. and paris as a girl will make them think of hilton...so ya either way it sucks|`|eDmdkUO3aa	I don't like unisex names at all. I would prefer it for a girl myself though.|`|VEkkn2Otaa	sounds really Girly!|`|JfRqYOSqaa	It's almost embarrassing to name a boy Paris anymore, that's probably why it got off the SSA list a few years ago.

Before Paris Hilton there wasn't a famous female with that name. Out of the US, Paris is still very masculine. And I prefer it for boy actually, minus the ignorant jerks who think they named him because of Hilton.|`|DcbIVUisaa	Boy. 100%, clearly, boy.

fUjsE0LRaa	My sons are the same the is 10 weeks today, you know when they r breastfed because of the egg yolk colour, the runny consistency and the smell, they arent offensive like bottle fed babies.<br>  <br>  They are a little messy at times, but i put a cloth nappy under his bottom before i change him, so if any runs anywhere it wont get on my changing area and i only have to wash a cloth nappy.<br>  <br>  it's 100% normal, in my opinion i would much rather breast milk poo than any other, the other stuff is gross lol.|`|8brZAonnaa	this is normal for a breast fed baby as they take whatthey need from the breastmilk and the rest just passes through they warned me of this in the hospital when i had my son... do not panic with users son having aids as i doubt his runny nappies are linked to that and one of the parents needs to have aids or the baby come into contact with someone with aids in order for the baby to get aids|`|a644ae7f54d9fee91d9eade135db3151aa	as long as their a mustardy yellow colour<br>  <br>  yes this is normal.. it their ever go green or really yucky.. then i would see a doctor.<br>  <br>  breast milk poos are always like you described since the baby finds bm so easy to digest.<br>  <br>  keep up the good job of breast feeding!!!!|`|VEkkn2Otaa	totally normal they dont get solid tell they eat solids|`|JDJjGdEuaa	actually, it's NOT normal! My son did that. I took him to a doctor and he had AIDS.|`|GJgZVKvXaa	Totally breastfed babies do make stools that are looser than formula fed babies.  Your baby's stools will not be formed and should look like the consistency of mustard.  They are sometimes also described as "seedy," having small particles in them that look like birdseed.  This is how digested breastmilk looks.<br>  <br>  It is unusual for a totally breastfed baby to get diarrhea, but very liquid stools could be diarrhea.  If his diapers have changed recently, I would call your pediatrician and ask for advice.  If it is diarrhea, your son may also exhibit signs of dehydration, such as infrequent urination, very yellow urine (a breastfed baby's urine should be almost clear) or listless behavior.<br>  <br>  However, if your baby's diapers always look this way, it is probably normal for him.  As long as he only drinks breastmilk, his stools will not change.  They will only change when you begin introducing other kinds of foods, such as formula or solid food.|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	Yes, perfectly normal.
Qe9rXFm0aa	Okay, please ignore what the nurse said. Your baby is not even 3 months old.<br>  At this point he still needs to be rocked to sleep..and you doing so is not going to stop him from learning to self settle.<br>  My dr. did not even begin to suggest putting to bed awake and teaching her to self soothe until after 6 months.<br>  So if you are going to do it this early..still remember his cries are NEEDS not wants at this point.<br>  But what I do for my 8 month old is..I nurse her and then lay her down while she is *drowsy* I then turn on her little crib soother thing (its like a little aquarium that plays lullabies) and I lay her on her side and rub her back..<br>  It takes 5-10 minutes but she is now learning to fall asleep without being in my arms. once she gets this down, then I will cut out the back rubbing..<br>  <br>  your baby is still really young, so take small steps at a time, you cant expect him to just know how to fall asleep on his own.|`|VKgD1K3baa	I just ordered a book called "The No Cry Sleep Solution" by Elizabeth Pantley and have heard great reviews about it. I don't know how it works yet as I have not received it, but I was able to order a used copy off amazon and with shipping it was only $10. My son is 6 months and has difficulty sleeping, but I am also completely against the CIO method. 10 weeks is still young - I am sorry I don't have the book yet and can't offer any other advice. Congrats on the new baby and best of luck to you!|`|fUjsE0LRaa	i did a cry it out method with my eldest when he was 10 1/2 months old, he was waking up at night about 8 - 9 times every night, just for a little bit of booby and going back to sleep again for about 45 mins, it was just 1 vicious cycle. <br>  <br>  I saw a sleep therapist and she said, it isnt to be done b4 6 months, but leaving them to cry it out (not going in there every ten mins) will help them to learn.<br>  <br>  i did this and it only took 4 days, he now sleeps through the night and has done since that point. i feel really lucky. <br>  <br>  I am all for doing it, it doesnt hurt the baby, there is nothing wrong with him and you know where he is, that he is safe. i am going to do it with my second son when he is about 7 months old too. <br>  <br>  i know you didnt want this kind of answer, but honestly i dint think there is any other way, if you use dummies, snuggle blankets, wraps etc, it is all settling for him, he isnt learning how to do it himself. they learn a specific way that they like. <br>  <br>  if you are really worried about him, i suggest getting a monitor which hooke up to the television so you can see him at all times (although this may be tempting for you to go in andrescuee him).<br>  <br>  Just a couple of ideas, do with it what you will.<br>  <br>  Good luck xx|`|iAQKD2YBaa	To be totally honest with you, you are in for one of the hardest times of your life, but once you get past this stage, you will look back and be glad that you put in the effort to start with.<br>  <br>  I took my baby to sleep class and they taught me what I needed to do to help him settle.  They were very tough on him and if I had of done it the same way they suggested, I think he would have settled much quicker (they sort of do the CIO method), the way I did it took longer, but he was not becoming hysterical and we got there in the end.  <br>  <br>  As he was just under 6 months old I was a little tough, but in some ways also very lenient.<br>  <br>  When he wakes pat him gently on the bum,back, chest (whichever is easiest to get to) and SHHHHHH him, if he is crying, make the patting firm - but not hard, with a cupped hand. Do the shhhhhhing loud enough for him to hear over his screaming.  As he starts to settle, slow down the patting and quieten the shhhhhhhing. <br>  <br>  I was given the option of either putting him down fully awake and doing the sssshhhhhing and patting or getting him nearly asleep and then trying. I chose to put him down fully awake while I was in the class, but  once I got him home I realized that this was not working so I started to cuddle him until he was "just about asleep", I then put him in his bed and continued with the settling technique (ssshhh, patting).<br>  <br>  I was absolutely exhausted every time but found that he went from 20 minute cat naps to between 1 and 3 hour sleeps nearly every day.  Admittedly, it did take me a good month or so to do it, but I made sure that I was consistent and when he woke after a sleep of less than an hour, I used this method. It is tough on you and him but since I have used this method he has around 4 - 6 days per week of 2 - 3 hour sleeps in the afternoon and he is 10 months old.  He never slept this amount of time before I tried this method.<br>  <br>  Good luck, It will be tiring, but I promise, you will appreciate it in months to come when he is sleeping beautifully (even when he is teething and sick)....|`|8brZAonnaa	when my son was born i straight away put him to bed awake.. it is no harm to let him cry for a few mins now as he is a boy he cant be left to cry for too long as he could give himself a hernia ... id put him in give him a dummy and say  goodnight if you have a cot mobile switch it on leave him 5 mins and then go back in put the dummy back in and say goodnight again... keep doing this he is crying because he knows you will pick him up i no its hard but you've got to stick to it trust me i had my son sleeping 9 to 9 at 6 weeks old|`|iTXnHiwTaa	You know, its not a bad idea to help him learn to self soothe - even at 10 weeks. I would think that at this age, a really easy way would be to do things you'd be doing in your routine when he gets older anyway. Dim lights, white noise machine or fan or lullaby music. You can rub his back, let him suck on a dummy, talk softly, have a blankie with him that you've been "wearing" all day so it smells like you, use a crib toy that projects pictures, has lights and plays music so he can watch it til he gets drowsy... hope some of this helps.|`|yoNXldH8aa	What I have noticed that works with my son which might sound a little crazy  however I put a shirt of mine in with him when I lay him down its a very simple concept it smells like momma is laying down with him so he feels safe and comfortable enough to fall asleep. Just make sure its close enough he can grab it but not too close to where its up against his nose obviously.|`|rjVALevtaa	I know you said that you didn't want any cry it out method answers but I've got to tell you, that's usually how babies learn to put themselves to sleep.<br>  <br>  Although I would say that your son is a bit young for that method. Most doctors don't recommend trying the cry it out method until baby is closer to 6 months old.<br>  <br>  Does your bassinet have a vibrate option? That helped my youngest son when he was around that age. Or maybe you could try a bouncer?|`|fWB8q1dwaa	I'm no expert, but thismay put you on a helpful path:<br>  <br>  There are soothing techniques you can do without taking them out of the cot. This is less intervention by you, so the baby is going to feel more independent about soothing.<br>  Like stroking his/her head/back/whatever, while making soothing noises<br>  Or just holding them tight while making soothing noises. The pressure (obviously not heaps! just a nice, safe-feeling pressure) helps to soothe, and feels comforting, the human warm touch. <br>  <br>  Its a contentious debate, but I personally feel 10 weeks old is way too young to expect your child to do it all himself - he needs some help to learn to soothe himself. <br>  Keep up the good work x
EULVtVDvaa	Protein shakes are fine - energy drinks are a no no . Really, you need to call your Dr. and ask if it is ok regardless . My Dr. let me drink protein drinks all through my pregnancy - but I was still weight training as well .

I've never had one myself obviously, and I don't remember them from my childhood but I've heard the stories about them from older family members. My great grandmother had a horrible party line setup when she was first married.  The people her line was shared with (three households total including my great grandmother) "never shut up" according to her. One of the women was notorious for staying on the line to listen to the others phone calls. <br>  <br>  Personally, a party line would drive me up the wall. My life is never overly interesting and to most my typical conversations would be boring but I still want them to be MY PERSONAL phone calls. If I were you I would call the phone company again and request to talk to someone until you find one who knows what a party line is. I know I would want it out if there were one in my house. I didn't even know they were still left functioning without the people in the house paying for it. It's definitely an odd situation.<br>  <br>  It cracks me up that people think you're talking about 3-way calling. Not the same thing people! They should go have a good conversation with their grandparents or great grandparents!<br>  <br>  BTW, I did see your other question and personally loved the guy that offered you the perfectly good tin foil hat!

LOL|`|idn1OQucaa	When I was a little kid we did have a party line.  Looking back, it was pretty bizarre.  Of course, my parents had an "upscale" version that had only two parties, rather than more, sharing.  <br>  <br>  Then one day we got a lady on the line who talked all the time.  My mother couldn't make her calls, so she got fed up and requested a "private line".  As little kids, we'd pick up the phone and listen to the other person's conversation for a while.  It was never very interesting (I suppose because people knew to keep things uninteresting on the phone.)<br>  <br>  Since I've been an adult, I've never been offered the option of having a party line; so I don't think they're offered in my area anyway.<br>  <br>  What happened to me once when I was grown, though, is that one person needed a phone line taken out and another one put in another house.  The phone company added the line to the other house, but then never took it out of the old house.  If I recall correctly, there was some element of a party-line type of thing going on in the instance - maybe just with the ringing.  I forget the details.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Yes I do and I believe there are Still some left.|`|j2mRop0laa	I think I used to hear something about that when I was really little. Is that like 3 way? lol<br>  <br>  ETA: Ohhhh yeah! When my sister got married she used to set her phone up like that to ring at my moms when they went on vacation. I do remember that.

If you are pregnant, the egg is fertilized, so your body would not flush it out. Also, you ovulate with your periods, but you do not ovulate when you are pregnant. Mostly that is how women know they are pregnant, is they miss a period. So no, you would not get a period. Some women bleed during pregnancy, so they may mistake it for a period, but, it is not their period. My guess is she became pregnant after having it, in other words, when it ended.|`|1cRANJXNaa	Sounds like she got pregnant in February not March i could be wrong tho and anything is possible.

L2mJmZDtaa	The choice is yours. If you want to deliver vaginally, then find an Ob that will do what you want. If you feel comfortable with the midwife, then stick with her, but personally with your history and the number of times you have been pregnant, I would find an Ob. The choice on how to deliver is such a personal choice ad it should be explored by you, your partner and your Ob. Good luck.|`|5ZvALiclaa	Whats their reasoning for another c-section. Just because you had one before or extra complications?<br>  Who delivered the next two babies naturally? Can you use then again now? <br>  <br>  If they had any real defined medical reason why it wouldn't be safe (other than the usual reasons) then i would go the c-section but if everything is going perfectly and you have a back up plan and can get emergency hospital care then try another natural birth. <br>  Remember though that ultimately your baby's safety and your own is on the line, do the pros outweigh the cons at the end of the day?|`|9104bb285d8b87b92fe87a09510fdbfdaa	if you have already had a VBAC, and its been 4 years since your C section I don't see why your OB would say that you need another C section unless there was another reason for it, as a trainee midwife I might be a little biased, but I would stick with the midwife and go for it naturally!<br>  OB tend to be more cautious, and would rather go for the C section then risk something going wrong with a VBAC and them get sued!, but since you have had 2 VBAC already, I really don't know why they would say that! <br>  Good luck in your decision, and congrats on #6, Im currently patiently waiting for #6 to arrive also!!<br>  <br>  <br>  ETA... here is why your OB wants to do a c section not VBAC  <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1880665-2,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articl...</a>|`|966eec79f617288c5cf9aa01263ebbd6aa	If you have had two children naturally after c-section then why are the doctors automatically jumping to it again.

966eec79f617288c5cf9aa01263ebbd6aa	I don't think it is bad to be eating healthy sugars.  I have always been a health nut and since I found out I was pregnant in Dec I have made it a point to be cautious not to eat any junkie food and I have not gained a pound.  If my body need to gain weight it will.  I think the weight loss is definitely due to you being more cautious of your food.  If your doctor tells you to eat sugars then eat sugars but the good kinds.  Why not grab a ice pop. Has some sugar and also mostly water.|`|21Lnhdfeaa	The same thing (sort of) happened to me when I was pregnant with my 3 year old.  The big difference was I was put on a low-no fat diet and lost 15 pounds in about a week.  My doctor recommended that I increase my caloric intake.  Not junk food, but things like crackers with peanut butter or cheese.  It's healthy food and higher in calories.  If that doesn't work, consider cutting your walks back to 15 minutes a day instead of 30.  I hope this helps a little bit.|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	You need to be checked for gestational diabetes.  Find another doctor NOW.

LJwhaNIDaa	Do something positive after each visit as a way to give him positive reinforcement regarding any doctor's visit. <br>  <br>  You can take him out for ice cream immediately afterward or buy him some other treat. <br>  <br>  Personally, I don't like going to the doctor either.  They are always poking prodding and some times they jab us with a needle.  <br>  <br>  So the fact that the kid has made a negative association with Doctors shows that his cognitive skills are functioning well and his brain makes relevant connections well.  <br>  <br>  With good luck the positive experience of the treat will help over ride the factually negative aspects of a doctor's visit.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Too much fun, my mom had to take me more than once to get peas taken out of my nose and ears, she just didnt get how much I hated them lol.

You have to reinforce the fact the doctor is there to help them feel better, that they don't want to feel icky, he gives them stuff to make them feel better so they won't be sick.  Because he's so young right now, take him into the doctors office for a "visit" to say hi, and let the secretary know what's up, she can have some suckers there, you say hi, then leave, nothing happened that hurt, they weren't sick and it gives them something to think about, maybe do that every so often so you can say you're not always sick and feel icky when you go to the dr, some visits are to make sure you don't get sick, they are called well visits.

ifLCcOTuaa	Meu bebê está com 5 meses, e durante os dois primeiros meses nem eu nem meu marido pudemos dormir. Foi difícil, a nenê dormia e dali vinte minutos acordava com fome. Hoje ela dorme a noite toda mas chora se qualquer coisa a incomodar. N?o acho que os bebês novinhos chorem à toa, só crian?as mais velhas fazem isso. Mas muitas vezes é dificil identificar qual é o problema, e isso só resolve conforme vamos conhecendo melhor um ao outro. Agora percebi, p ex, que a minha chora se estiver com sono e houver barulho, pq ela deve ter a audi??o muito boa ( eu tbém tenho esse "problema", n?o durmo com barulho). Portanto, n?o acredito que bebê de menos de um ano chore por pura manha, quando novinhos sentem muita fome, colica, etc e n?o bom deixa-lo só chorando para n?o se sentir abandonado... mas, é claro há que se ter bom senso: se deixa-lo chorar for a única alternativa para vc poder descansar, isso será necessario. Vc precisará descansar para se recuperar e poder cuidar dele. Colo e contato eles v?o gostar sempre e isso é bom para eles, mas normalmente ser?o capazes de dormir sozinhos se outras coisas n?o o incomodarem. Procure sempre ir por eliminatória: se n?o é frio ou calor, fome ou sede, fralda suja, dor de ouvido (tocando em baixo da orelha, se for chorará bem alto), ou barulho. E que vc possa lhe dar muito carinho para que sejam muito felizes!!!|`|RXTjrpoVaa	minha bebe dos 3 messes até 1 ano de idade chora e resmungava e gritava dia e noite, mesmo estando no colo, a levei em varios medicos fiz varios exames e ela nao tinha nada era pura manha, alguns medicos até falaram para eu deixa-la chorar por umas 2 ou 3 horas, eu tentei de tudo q me falavam e o que os medicos me diziam, até mesmo a deixei chorar,mas nao adiantou apenas piorou pois ela chorava e gritava ainda mais, a unica solu?ao foi rezando muito pela minha bebe e gra?as a DEUS apartir de 1 ano ela foi melhorando e hoje com 1 ano e 3 messes parece um anjinho, ninguem q a conhece diz que ela foi um bebe manhoso e chorao, gra?as a DEUS...|`|RbFGwiTsaa	nao faca isso.eles nao sabem de nada.as vezes agente deixa porque se extressa.mas nao e bom.eles criam gazes no umbigo.e ficam com o umbigo alto.de colo a ele.nao maltrate.ele vai sair dessa faze.tenha paciencia.beijos.passe musica de bebe para que ele se acalme.|`|pgEi1dh0aa	<a href="http://solucoes.multiply.com/" rel="nofollow">http://solucoes.multiply.com/</a><br>  <br>  Dê uma bela olhada neste hompage, está tecnica de deixar o bebê chorando é absurda, só  trás problemas psicologicos para o futuro.

Se a crian?a está bem cuidadinha, lavada, trocada e alimentada e mesmo assim insiste no berreiro, pode estar testando os pais só para pegarem ela no colo, por exemplo. Os pais tem que impor limites a crian?a com carinho, mas também com severidade, pois a crian?a sabe perceber quando os pais est?o inseguros para corrigi-la e aproveita-se disso tb. Os pais devem ter um espa?o só deles e é essencial que a crian?a tenha seu próprio quartinho desde os primeiros dias de vida, logo que a m?e esteja recurepada do parto e possa se locomover. Caso contrário a crian?a pode se transformar ao invés de uma alegria, um empecilho na vida matrimonial do casal, levando ao fim do casamento. Tb ja′vi casos de crian?as pequenas que presenciaram cenas de sexo dos pais, por descuido destes, e que desenvolveram problemas seríssimos depois, precisando de tratamento psicológico. Por isso é essencial que desde bebê a crian?a tenha seu próprio espa?o e aprenda a respeitar o espa?o dos pais, compreendendo seu lugar de filho. No caso de medo, um diálogo com as crian?as que já entendem é essencial.|`|RBfh5lRzaa	Tenho uma filha de 2 anos e uma de 2 meses, nas duas tenho aplicado isso, sen?o nós mamaes n?o fizemos nada sen?o dar colo... você sabia que desde bebe( cerca de 4 meses) eles ja mentem para os pais? tudo por um colinho, afinal como deve ser bom, né? mas te digo uma coisa... chorar n?o faz mal para ninguém...|`|a04b255b455dc1ddd45e9873f351915aaa	olha maria ,eu como  m?e  nunca deixei meu bebe  chorar  sozinho,sempre estive ao lado  dele  na maioria  das vezes   inconscientemente   ,eu ficava colada  nele   por ser meu primeiro   filho   eu morria de medo de   que acontecesse algo  , como  tive   muito  tempo  pude me dedicar a  ele ,mas  já presenciei   aqui  onde moro   crian?as  chorarem ate`  dormir   ,sozinhas   em seus  quartos , fui  a casa  de  uma amiga  americana  e ela  havia  acabado  de colocar   o bebe  pra dormir ,ela  deixou a  baba eletr?nica no quartinho   do bebe   e  fomos   para   a parte   térrea  da casa  e o bebe  ficou  la   no andar  de cima  ,fiquei   o tempo  todo  agoniada   com aquele  bebe chorando ,n?o sei   se `e  porque   faz parte   da minha cultura  brasileira   que me faz sentimental  ,ou  meu  sangue   meio  indígena   que faz com que  eu queira  proteger    um  bebe ,n?o sei ,mas  eu  n?o aplicaria   este   método   com   meu filho , eu acho que espa?o  `e bom   e saudáveis ,mas assim  eu acho  demais   para  a crian?a .|`|a5b4d1863c89917b1d04b417d0ec7090aa	N?o sei se é certo ou errado, mas nunca deixei.<br>  <br>  Se choram é porque precisam de algo, é a única maneira de se expressarem.<br>  <br>  Beijinhos|`|kOfdEAcqaa	eu particularmente ja fiz essa tecnica com meu bb e resolveu pois ele queria ficar o tempo todo no colo e se ficasse na cama ou carrinho chorava demais...<br>  acho que nao é covardia pois ele tambem tem que ter limites...<br>  é claro que vc nao deve deixar ele chorar tanto a ponto de ficar roxo, mas uns 15 minutos nao vejo problema algum...|`|zhJIuJTRaa	eu n?o tenho filhos mas se tivesse, tentaria explicar até ele entender

Tu hijita es peque?a,  pero igual hay que hablarle y tratar de explicar las cosas en términos que ella comprenda y reforzándole tu amor. Los celos infantiles no son  un gran problema, esto deberá ir pasando conforme vaya creciendo, pero es importante empezar a fijar límites de comportamiento y conducta. Es decir, cuando tomes a tu sobrino  y ella empiece a querer llamar tu atención,  debes explicarle que es su primo, que lo quieres como también a ella,  que ella debe quererlo igual, que es un bebé más peque?o y debe ciudarlo y portarse bien porque el bebé aprenderá de ella. Debes empezar a marcarle cosas como: "no se debe hablar cuando otra persona está hablando" o "es mala educación interrumpir, gritar, ..." o lo que quiera que esté haciendo. No a manera de un rega?o severo o gritos, pero si de forma seria, para que no se vuelva una ni?a mal educada u odiosa- Cuando empieze a ir al Jardín o Kinder, esta conducta se disminuye, puesto que empieza a compartir con sus compa?eros. Es justo entre los 3 y 4 a?os cuando volviendo de la escuela un día te piden que ya no le digas más bebé porque ya no lo es  que ya es ni?a grande.|`|59fb234e6fb564c2d268a69127a1f2a8aa	creo que ya esta,ya no le digas bebita,no lo es.me parece,igual depende de vos<br>  saludos
T8ksKCWCaa	My sister had terrible heartburn for the last 20 weeks, and upset stomach for much of that time. Your stomach has less room because baby is getting so big, so things just don't work the same. Good luck.|`|i4zKc2bhaa	well I have been pregnant 3 times and with every baby my morning sickness has been completely differant. This one being the worst. It feels like a sickening burning sensation in my tummy.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Aches and pains are totally normal.  Your uterus is growing and stretching and pushing your other organs up and to the side...the further along you get the more uncomfortable it gets....sorry.|`|zfuWcFf2aa	had really bad heartburn Throughout my whoooooooooole pregnancy....
aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	I have an 11 and an 8 year old, as well as a 1 year old.  We homeschool, and we live in the country so we have done a lot with plants.  Here are some suggestions.<br>  <br>  You could plant a bean in a baby food jar, but that is so basic-it is a lot more fun.<br>  <br>  Right now, Target has a $1 section at the front of the store with little flower pots that a child can grow daisies and sunflowers in.  That would be a nice start.<br>  <br>  You can go to Lowe's and get a small Venus Fly Trap for less than $4.  We recently got one as my son was interested in carnivorous plants.  I also purchased an aloe plant for about the same price-it is from the cactus family, but it is also a medicinal plant of course.<br>  <br>  Plant a small garden-it is the perfect time to do so.  Watermelons, perhaps, though they take a lot of room.  Fruits and vegetables would be great-they could later enjoy their work.  There are also some things sold by educational supply companies where you can plant the seed and watch it grow, because you plant it in a narrow, then container with plexiglass walls. <br>  <br>  Start a small compost heap, and talk about the benefits of fertilizer and also the negatives-such as chemical fertilizers running off and getting into waterways.<br>  <br>  Discuss bees and butterflies, and how they are essential to plants, along with other insects.<br>  <br>  I am not sure what kind of activities you are looking for, but the number of arts and crafts is unlimited.  THey could purchase terra cotta pots from the local arts and crafts store and decorate them, they can make scarecrows to keep pests out of the garden (you can use old aluminum cans).  Pack O Fun magazine always has some great ideas in it!  One I like was making bird feeders out of old shoes.  Sounds weird, but looked neat and a great way to recycle.<br>  <br>  Other activities-plant related word searches, history of the peanut plant or others, etc.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps...I could go on and on, so please feel free to contact me via my profile if you want do discuss this more.|`|AA10818277	You can go to the dollar store and buy little egg like cartons for starting plants for about $2.00, then potting soil for around the same price, then seeds for 3 or 5 for $1.00.  Have the children help you put the potting soil in the potters, then plant the seeds and water.  It will take time for them to grow, but if you use veggies, they can learn about how to grow real food and probably eat what they grow.  You can start them in the house now and transplant them later when the ground is warmer so it will be more activities later on to do.  In the mean time you can go to the library and rent books on veggies to read to them, they can watch excitedly the potters for any signs of growth, and it will be a very educational activity about growing food to eat.|`|AA11109728	I'd plant a small garden with them in the spring/summer.  Let them tend to it and see how it grows.  Things like cucumbers and other veggies are really easy to grow, and they taste WAY better than the ones you buy in the store!  Even a flower garden would be fun.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	gardening in warm weather<br>  growing plants inside the house in pots|`|PTdy6TWRaa	Get some Cress seeds. You can plant those in all sorts of creative ways. They grow very quickly so it's something that can excite and keep the attention of impatient 5-8 year olds. Also, when they are grown you can harvest the cress and make sandwiches. Yum. I loved doing that when I was that age. My aunt and uncle kept me busy looking after little cress farms all the time.|`|h9q1wMbQaa	A bean plant in a larger waxed dixi cup.  It will grow fast and tall!  Just fill the cup about 3/4 the way with soil and make a hole with your finger about 1 inch deep, drop the bean in and cover lightly with soil.  Within days you should see activity<br>  <br>  It is possible that a bag of pinto beans could do the trick. lol I soaked some "overnight" one night and forgot about them.  2 days later I remembered them and some were already sprouting.  I only mention this because a pound bag of pintos is under 2 dollars.  <br>  <br>  Have fun!!|`|l4jSgRRmaa	Give them a seed (beans are easy) and let them grow a plant.<br>  Put leaves under a sheet of paper and run a crayon over the top for nice designs.<br>  Dip leaves in ink/paint and blot on paper and then label.<br>  Flatten leaves in books use for bookmarks, framing, etc.<br>  Take walks and identify plants.<br>  Visit a botanical garden.<br>  Visit a farm.<br>  Visit a plant nursery.|`|xbzCxo8yaa	Have them plant seeds in little containers and watch their plants grow...it teaches them a sense of responsibility and builds their self esteem that they actually grew the plants.|`|drEfr9waaa	Keeping silk worms but they need mulberry leaves.  Also having a vegie patch.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	get leaves place them under paper ..use a sideways crayon and color over it for a traced impression...or use chalk<br>  <br>  collect moss dry it and glue it to a picture frame use sticks and acorns ect too<br>  <br>  make acorn necklaces<br>  <br>  braid flower chains|`|1hciyvKdaa	Grow an avacado tree. Get celery and put some water in a glass with food coloring and let them see how a plant drinks when the celery begins to change colors.<br>  Grow sprouts, those grow pretty quickly.<br>  Have them trace leaf shapes, or patterns on a paper and use different colors. Press a flower in a book in wax paper.<br>  Show them some interesting seed pods you find while taking a walk.

YxrJQy9Baa	I depends on where you live... I use the Hillcountry Fare brand.... but I know that they are only available in the HEB stores... I also like the Target brand diapers.  You might have to experiment a little to find the right one for you.|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	Luvs are not necessarily a 'discount' brand, because it is a popular name, but compared to the other diapers they are cheaper. You can get more for less and they don't leak through like some of these trash store brand diapers.<br>  <br>  Just bought 116 Luvs for about 13$|`|KHZLPldraa	I think my daughter must just pee too much.  LOL because walmart's parents choice always leaked through the night, so we have been with Luvs and I LOVE them.  They can handle her soaking sleeps.  My fave is huggies but they are expensive so I get a huge box of luvs from walmart for 19.00!|`|VayJue7vaa	It's impossible to say without trying them. White Cloud was the ONLY store brand that worked for my boys - but another friend's boy did really well in Target diapers - which were horrible for me. <br>  <br>  I have found that White Cloud tends to be closer to Huggies, and Target closer to Pampers - my boys were better with Huggies.<br>  <br>  The only cheaper brand that I found really seems to work well is Luvs - they aren't as cheap as the store brands, but they really do work just as well as the name brands (unfortunately, not all name brands work with all babies - my boys did bad with pampers once they got out of the swaddlers stage). Oh, and they always have $1 off coupon in the box when you buy them - so, that helps the price!<br>  <br>  Good luck in your quest! You really just need to try them until you find one that works. All babys are a little different, as are all diapers.|`|iMY2fgYdaa	I also have a son and we had the name brand diapers at first but found out he was allergic to all the added chemical that are in them. So I switch to Parents Choice which is a sam's club/Walmart brand...they are super cheep and they work wonderfully. they never leak unless he drinks too much before bed time and when they leak its because they are beyond full from front to back. I had also tried the white cloud once and they sucked big time....so if you have a walmart near you...go grab a pack....I LOVE THEM LOVE THEM LOVE THEM...we get 104 diapers for $13...can't go wrong with that!  Good luck and congrats on the new little man!!|`|IWinNj2saa	There are no discount diapers that are worth buying. You go through so many of them, in so little time, it would have been better off just buying the name brand diapers. Plus, you won't have as much laundry, because leaks won't happen...and if they do, it would be seldom.|`|hrMhhB4Saa	target!|`|GJgZVKvXaa	I almost always have my son in Kirkland brand from Costco.  They work just as well as the more expensive brands and I also think they fit better than Pampers, which always seem too small for my son even though I bought the size marked for his weight.|`|VTB5QpyBaa	The Kirkland brand at Costco work great. My daughter is 6 months old and I have been using them since day 1. I have not had a problem at all with them, even when she sleeps all night. Hope this helps !|`|JU3TLLYjaa	i use the babys r us ones. As a tip though I noticed most brands leaked when he was new born. Once your baby is like 1-2 months it will be easier things don't leak as much|`|q4FlSBL5aa	Parents choice from Wal-mart<br>  I've used them since my daughter was born and she's now 17 months old.<br>  They're GREAT!!|`|jsdDgIuRaa	I would go with Costco (Kirkland), they make decent generic products|`|8brZAonnaa	boots own brand are excellent newborn nappies.. id use them over pampers any day|`|0vpDDM8aaa	i always get walmarts brand...they are about $8 cheaper than huggies...and they work just fine!|`|FbhHIjyCaa	I swear by Parents Choice (walmart brand). We would only use pampers for for dd when she was first born because we thought there was no way a store brand would be any good. <br>  <br>  Well, one money slump and we had to try PC. I wouldnt go back! $5.75 for 40+ diapers! You dont get any better than that!|`|pFZwO2xaaa	All diapers are going to be different.  My son has sensitive skin, and we tried every store brand diaper there was.  He could not wear any of them. So we used Luvs, Pampers, or Huggies Supreme.
SndrZbn8aa	She's old enough. If that's something you'd like to do for her  I would do it now. They even have special earrings for infants the backs of which screw on so there's no worry about them falling out. I'm considering do the same for my daughter sometime after 6mos. My mom had mine done when I was two. I can't imagine what a pain it was looking after a two year old with her ears pierced. lol|`|xVecKF26aa	I know you probably think it is cute to have her ears pierced now, but truthfully, many people do not like seeing little babies with their ears pierced. (I am one of them)<br>  It makes me sad that parents would put a hole in their child's body for their own personal reasons.  The baby should not have any unneccesary pain- and getting ears pierced is exactly that.<br>  Please wait till she is old enough to decide if she wants them pierced or not.<br>  Ultimately it is your decision, but I just think it would be best if you waited till she was older and she made the decision herself to have them pierced.|`|2O7N6cb9aa	I got my daughter's ear peirced when she was 3 months only. Usually, the younger they are (doctor's usually recommend waiting until they are 6 months or so), they actually have LESS pain so if your daughter is 7 months now, get her ears peirced! <br>  <br>  While they are babies and young, they dont move as much and it is not as scary. But when they are older and know so much more, it could be more scary and they WILL move especially when you get to the SECOND ear once they know how much the first ear hurts.|`|16vwEBiqaa	I would wait until she is old enough to take care of them herself. However if you are set on getting them for her as a child I would get them now I suppose. Before she can move around, crawl, touch dirty things then touch her ears.|`|5jqFrtrwaa	Can I just say - NEVER!!<br>  <br>  I hate seeing babies with their ears pierced - why put her through unnecessary pain?? Please don't do it, it looks tacky and common!!<br>  <br>  Wait until she is old enough to want it done herself!|`|BthSjSEHaa	I wouldn't - I'd wait until she asked me if she could have them done or said that she wanted her ears pierced. It's just my opinion, but it makes me shudder when I see babies with pierced ears.|`|h85kkDsbaa	Personally i would wait till my child was old enough to make their own decision about it.|`|FYDw1rjlaa	For me, my daughter is 3 months so I would wait until she is one or two years old. I hate to see her in pain.|`|5hFLgrfQaa	Actually, I was wondering the same question. My daughter is 14 weeks old. I'm considering having her ears pierced too. But, some of these people are so rude. I don't think it is tacky. I think it would look adorable. So, I guess I'm going to have hers done tomorrow. =0)|`|723QHuicaa	When she can ask for it and care for the piercing herself with minimal help from you.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	When she asks you to have them done.|`|OQdPzl15aa	I heard you have to get it done quite early, so the ears have time to heal before she starts playing with/grabbing at them.  Just ask your pediatrician..and make sure you take her to the pediatrician to get it done.<br>  <br>  And it's not really that painful; vaccinations are more painful and we don't hesitate to give those out. <br>  <br>  I would recommend waiting until she is a little older, because I think 7 months is past the age she won't be playing with them.|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	I got my first piercings when I was 12.  Because I asked for it, and I could care for them then.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't ever mutilate my children's body without their consent.  And that's what a piercing is.  It leaves permanent scarring holes in her ears. What if my daughter grew up and didn't want them there?|`|3K7ffKn2aa	my mom got mine done when i was 1 and i'll probably do it around that same age. but hey to each his own|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	when she can ask you herself

My boys used to play with my pots and pans. boxes, almost anything safe I gave them. Singing is always a baby soother. Hope this helps, and good luck with the baby.
jLYTKr33aa	Easter is in April this year, but the date varies.  I get what you're saying, though.  The stores put out the holiday decorations way too early.  Get this - I took my son trick - or - treating at a "safe" Halloween event at our local mall this year, and some stores already had Christmas trees up!  My son was collecting Halloween candy while asking when Santa was coming.  Needless to say, I avoided the mall for the next 6 weeks. <br>  I love the holidays, but only during the actual holiday season.  Seeing stores try to push candy canes and stockings in July just puts me in a bad mood.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Another prime example of how our holidays have turned into profit making enterprises for stores!<br>  They do this to make more money, because they know people have kids that will do this, and also because some people are "impulse" shoppers!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	It is in april.They do put stuff out way to early.|`|H0fXySX9aa	it is at my local shop they started with easter eggs on january the 2nd i have had to buy my kids some to shut them up lol|`|MI53mUKzaa	i hate it when they put halloween stuff our in july.|`|AA11109728	Yeah - you're not kidding!  Two years ago, I was birthday shopping for someone in the middle of October at Walmart.  I didn't know it ahead of time, but they had trick or treating for kids that night - no big deal, right?  Halloween was just around the corner.  Needless to say, we also ran into Santa and Mrs. Claus that night!  I couldn't believe my freakin eyes!  Halloween and Christmas all rolled into one!  Yes, my daughter got her picture taken with Santa and Mrs. Claus on October 12th!  I will never forget that...  How ridiculous!  <br>  <br>  I keep trying to remember to grab things for my daughter for Easter when I see them and don't have her with me, but then I have to remind myself that it will be sitting around for another month and a half!  It is nuts, the day after Easter they will probably have all the Halloween stuff out!  LOL  So yeah, you're not the only one, it is really bugging me lately too.  I'd like to go into a store just once without seeing the next holiday's stuff all set out already!|`|eF6HTt0gaa	Seriously- more then 99.9999% of the stores already had Easter crap out even before they had taken New Years stuff down. I thankfully do all our holiday shopping no matter what it is with out the kids so they dont see what it is til they get it. Even if they did see it at the store I always tell them to write it on their wish list and who knows they might get it they might not this yr. So far this has kept them excited about what they want to get and actually get.<br>  <br>  Oh and I totally agree its all Commercial theres no real meaning behind any of it anymore. Back when I was a kid in the 80's it wasnt this bad  and we still knew what it ment to belive in the holiday. WTF happened to us?<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: hands Nina a whole case of Coconut kisses... here you take them cant stand the things. Love my MIL but hate coconut..lol|`|gW0nD5cEaa	With the economy right now, stores are doing everything they can to make a buck. Of course, this is nothing new, but they want a head start.<br>  <br>  What is worse, there are still some who 'keep' Lent and want to give up candy or things like that, and they are confronted with stuff all the time. I hope they have willpower.<br>  <br>  Christmas usually starts earlier than November, but they do have Halloween things out by Labor Day now. <br>  <br>  All holidays and things like that are commercialized. I don't mean any disrespect, but there are Martin Luther King day sales. In a few years, if they are not doing it already, there will be '9/11 sales', even though it is not really a holiday yet.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	We just bought Easter baskets at Sam's last night, lol.  It doesn't bug me for one reason and one reason only..... my all-time favorite candy (coconut kisses) are only available at Easter, which means I get an early start!|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Stores know that the sooner they put out the goods the more of it will be bought because kids will bug their parents to DEATH!<br>  <br>  It's a ploy I'm telling you!!  For the destruction of parents everywhere!!!!  My son is already asking for the cool candies and Easter goodies.  I'm sitting here like "Thanks a lot Walmart!"<br>  <br>  I just try to stay away from an aisle that has ANYTHING to do with Easter for now.  It's not until April 12.|`|a8IRxC4raa	That's how stores work.  You display the items for the next big holiday as soon as the current big holiday is over.<br>  <br>  You don't have it that bad - we don't even celebrate Christmas and Easter, so we have to put up with stores full of items we don't even use.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Its all about the money. The kids want this and that and a lot of parents buy it. Of course nobody can wait until easter so they eat it and then have to go buy it all over again.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	it pisses me off because my kids arent stupid and it ruins the Whole Easter bunny thing ..when you see it all in the store then in your easter basket|`|8oAlBL91aa	I always say that because it's always early for everything I mean Halloween is over and bam Christmas stuff. Then it's so hard to keep him away from those aisles because of all the baskets and toys that the "bunny" will bring that he starts to realize he's not real. I think he might just get to the punch this year and say no bunny no santa but I'm not sure if he's ready for that, he is 6 by the way. Plus I'm not ready for the "mom you lied to me" lol. Gets worse because now he sees egg coloring kits and every single time we go to the store he's like mom when are we going to do eggs mom mom mom I avoid those aisles as much as possible lol.<br>  <br>  There is one thing that I usually can't wait for and kinda happy they are early lol giant reese eggs I love those and to me they taste different than the trees or pumpkins.

5p7cQAokaa	Being pregnant causes your hormones to SOAR (I'm sure you and your poor husband know that by now lol!!)<br>  <br>  Also, being pregnant will have you craving the weirdest foods, make sure it isn't GREASY foods. Greasy foods will destroy your face! A lot of women crave curly fries- stay away!!!<br>  <br>  On the other hand, maybe you don't eat any of that stuff to begin with. In that case, try Proactive. Works for me!|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	my face is only clear while pregnant ..that sucks|`|5ci9IZd2aa	Sorry, your hormones are out of whack, I got my first cavity at the age of 28 because of my pregnancy. It's 10 years later and no cavities, so those hormones work in mysteries ways. You could see a dermatologist too see if there is anything that is safe to use on your face, since some topical creams can effect a pregnancy. Hope this helped.|`|AA12112469	There really isn't much you can do since your body is going through so much right now. What kind of food are you eating? Are you washing your face twice a day? Also, I would check with your local pharmacist. Lord knows, they may have something out there you are allowed to use. At any rate, I wouldn't worry too much about it. You are about to have one of th most rewarding experiences of your lifetime. Just concentrate on staying healthy....and good luck with everything.....God Bless ya honey|`|RVW9mTx9aa	I'm a guy so I dont have any experience being pregnant, but I kept breaking out last year, I just washed my face more often, once after breakfast, once when I got home from school, then once in the shower before bed and the problem went away and I've been pimple free for a year now.|`|8os6wuQLaa	yea wait about 7 months or more when your hormones start going back to normal.|`|2eN8vWxlaa	Well, as it's your hormones that are the problem, then there is probably absolutely nothing you can do about. You can always try some anti-spot products on it tho.|`|w2gIAD0Raa	Nope. I was the same way. I used every kind of face wash I could find and nothing helped.
8t8NjjnVaa	No they don't.  Cold remedies have been taken off the shelves because of the side effects that can occur.  <br>  <br>  Besides, cough/cold remedies do not cure a cold, they only mask the symptoms for a short while.  While stopping a cough may seem like a good thing, it's really not.  It can make the cold stick around longer because you're not letting the cough do what it should.<br>  <br>  In fact, Tylenol isn't even recommended unless the fever gets so high that they are just miserable.  Otherwise, it's better to let the fever runs its course.  A fever fights off the virus, and it also boosts white blood cell production to help fight the virus as well.  If you keep bringing the fever down to normal levels, you're not letting it fight the virus.  <br>  <br>  What I did with my kids is I only have Tylenol if they were so miserable that they couldn't function.  Otherwise, I just let them rest a lot and made sure they were drinking plenty of fluids.  At 7 months, this just meant that I made sure she nursed a lot.|`|dHtJeqBiaa	get a Vick's plug in thing they are like ten dollars and put it by the crib and get the pads that go with it. it will help clear her noise and help her breath better, then get a humidifier for her room or his sorry. but i wouldn't do anything other then tylenol. cause that stuff is way to hard on little babies. if it last longer then two weeks or she or he starts to weez or their chest comes tight go to the doctor. my son had Coop that is not fun. i have a humidifier in my sons room all the time to help him breath better and when he starts to get sick that is what i do. and the Vick's thing. if it last longer then a week or if he gets worse i take him to doctor just in case. last time he had an ear infection in both ears. so that was our of my hands. but i would do that and see what happens. also put a mint like from sonic in a warm bottle of water and let him or her suck on that it will help the throat some too. but not too much. i wouldnt do cough drops they have to many drugs. well good luck and hang in there.|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	There aren't any cold medications that are approved for use for children under two.  The FDA wants to move that up to four.  Cold medications are dangerous for infants.<br>  <br>  Try saline drops and an aspirator for the nose and a steamy bathroom to help the cough. Chamomile (without honey!) tea is soothing for a cold.|`|qIWUC1Ceaa	sorry there is nothing. my five month old has a terrible cold right now too. she pukes up her milk cause she is choking on her phlem. all ya can do is run a vaporizer, use saline drops in the nose and suck it out with a bulb. At night i give her a warm bath and a dose of tylenolbefore bed. Everything has been taken off the shelves.|`|0cx4imxHaa	As far as I know, there aren't any (safe) infant cold formulas although I have heard that there may be some homeopathic ones. I used a bulb syringe and nasal saline spray when my little one had a cold. Her pediatrician said colds are normal and you just have to wait it out. Hope your baby feels better soon!|`|8brZAonnaa	there is nothing they can give you until your baby is 2 years old my 11mnth old recently had a cold and they just told me to give him capol if he is getting distressed from it... hope this helps|`|755c013afef1ace57586c8ac0b25bdbfaa	They used to.

wl7tlYOYaa	I wont take too long. You might be bleeding for up to 6 weeks and mostly will be sore but it all goes away and you will stop aching after your stitches come out and you finish healing.|`|yrDqtazLaa	I'd give it every bit of 5-6 weeks before it heals. I had just a few stitches when I had my kids, and it took all of that for it to heal. It's because it's in a closed, wet area (the bleeding doesn't help), and it stays that way for longer because air isn't hitting it. Just make sure you keep it as clean as you possibly can.|`|SiIuJXvwaa	congratulations on your little one. everyone is different i got 4 stitches after my last baby was born and within 2 weeks i was back to normal within reason though don't do anything to quickly though, you will be up and running before you know it hun good luck xxx|`|FYDw1rjlaa	Everyone is different but it should only take 6 weeks before it's normal again as the doctor always say while it takes longer for some. For me, I didn't tear or get stitches for both my kids because they are small so it take me right around 4 weeks.|`|i4zKc2bhaa	i was able to have sex agian at 4 weeks, and i felt ok down there. but i also had no tears. the worst part for me was where i had my catheter(sp). ouch!
vue9NOhYaa	Well, the first question is, do you want  or need to wean? If you're both happy with the arrangement, there is NO reason to change anything.  It's perfectly healthy and normal for a 17 month old to still be nursing.<br>  <br>  If you want/need to stop, then the next question is -- how miserable are your willing to make your daughter in order to acheive this?  <br>  <br>  There are many ways to wean a child gently, (mostly varients on distraction and 'don't offer-don't refuse)  but if she's determined to keep nursing, you may have be  harsh and make her miserable.<br>  <br>  So... the decision is yours.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	<a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/how_weaning_happens.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/how_w...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/weaning_faqs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/weani...</a><br>  <br>   here's some site that may help you with that<br>  <br>  my son is 22 montsh andd still nursing some but he hasn't needed to nurse to sleep for a while. i just rocked him to sleep with music on|`|GJgZVKvXaa	Some children self-wean as they approach 1 year old; others become really attached to nursing and will continue to do it well into toddlerhood if allowed to do so.  Your daughter no longer physically needs breastmilk, so her desire for it is probably emotional.  It probably makes her feel content and comfortable, and she probably enjoys the closeness with you.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with continuing to breastfeed as long as your daughter wants to.  Some women breastfeed their children well past the age of 2.  However, if you no longer want to breastfeed, it is also ok for you to decide to wean her.<br>  <br>  Since your daughter is a little older, she may be more stubborn about accepting change and so you must be gentle in weaning her so she will not feel rejected or distressed.  You should continue to cuddle and perhaps rock her at naptime/ bedtime so she still gets that comfort and closeness that nursing gives her.  You can introduce a comfort object such as a blankie or lovey (special stuffed toy) that you cuddle with at naptime/ bedtime.  If your daughter already has a lovey she likes, incorporate it into her sleep time routine.  The lovey will help her feel secure in transitioning to a bottle at sleep time.<br>  <br>  I would also try only changing one nursing session at a time.  Leave bedtime alone until your daughter is comfortable with a bottle or cup at naptime.  Go slowly and give your daughter lots of love and cuddles.  She probably depends on nursing for a sense of security.  If you are gentle though, you can help her give it up.|`|6hA0O06xaa	If you are wanting to stop, then maybe try cutting down by 1-2 minutes per day for each feeding and starting another routine that she can associate with sleeping like reading her a story in a certain chair while she's holding a comfort object.  Or you could offer her a sippy cup with water after you have breastfed for the set amount of time and see if she'll take that for a bit and gradually only take that.  I'd start with the naptime first because if she ends up missing a couple naps because she isn't nursing until she's completely asleep, that's not as bad as you being up all night.  If you put her down and she cries, go in and comfort her after 3 minutes, then 5, then 8, then 10, then every 10 minutes until she falls asleep or it is past the time of her normal length nap....this will teach her to fall asleep with out you as an aid.  This is a method like that spelled out in Dr. Ferbers book, but with shorter times so you don't have to bear so much crying if it upsets you.
8brZAonnaa	at 7 months my son drank 16oz a day 8 in the morning and 8 at nite he had his breakfast lunch and dinner inbetween 24oz is enough at his age espically if he is getting a good blance of solid food i find homemade not jars are better for baby.... hope this helps|`|ay8tXLD2aa	Was at the paediatric dietican last week and she said that from 6 months to one year, the guideline is 20 - 24 ounces of milk each day, minimum.  If your child takes LESS than that, you need to add enough milk to his solids to make that amount, to ensure he gets all of his needed nutrition. <br>  <br>  That said, my son still takes four 8oz bottles a day - so, 32 ounces - but doesn't do much more than three or at most four ounces of solid food.|`|qIWUC1Ceaa	My six month old has just started cereal and she still drinks about 24oz a day. I just feed her whenever she is hungry, she is not overweight. She takes about 5oz every three hours|`|wx32VQSWaa	16oz of milk is good...as long as he's eating solid too.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	My son much prefers solids to his breastmilk/formula too. Offer a bottle when he is hungry and let him get full off of it and then give solids after.

kprKXEOSaa	Your mother sounds mentally ill.<br>  Yes, I would say you and your siblings are being abused.<br>  Where is your father in all this?<br>  If there aren't any adults that can help you, you should call Child Protective Services or Child & Family Services and talk with a social worker.  Your mom should not be allowed to continue doing this to you all.|`|nZVmkZSBaa	It isn't borderline abuse, it IS abuse. <br>  ANYTHING done with a closed fist, or leaves a mark, is considered abuse.

She shouldn't be doing that, and yes, it is illegal.<br>  Good luck. x.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	bordering abusive and wrong|`|CwNMq7RTaa	She sounds alot like my mother who was an abusive witch.  Always having to take care of her needs while she completely ignored mine, like I was born to give her what she missed as a child and very rude and abusive, verbally, emotionally, and always blaming me for things I didn't do and denying everything she did and very moody.  Also sexually abusive when I was very little.  It's a personality disorder.  No one is real to them but themselves.  And yes the youngest gets off the easiest.  My little sister got the least sh--t from her even though she did get her share.  It's hard when you're young and you are first feeling the shock of not having the mother you should have.  But as you get older, you'll meet people who had similar witch mothers and if you put your mind to it you can have a good life, in spite of the witch.  If you need therapy along the way, don't be afraid to get it.  It doesn't mean you're weak.  It means you care enough about yourself to want better.|`|oDtuygT6aa	no its definitly not normal.<br>  but you, me & many others deal with this on a daily basis.<br>  the only thing you can do is suggest to your mother councelling i guess.<br>  other than that, i have no idea what to say.<br>  ive just learned to ignore it.<br>  <br>  but it could affect you later in life.<br>  example, ive learned to ignore just about everything.<br>  in my oppinion its not a good coping strategy.|`|snmHwWgJaa	I don't watch Desperate Housewives so I don't know if this was an isolated incident or not.  While this might be the most popular answer, I don't think what he did was abusive, a little over the top perhaps though.  If this is something that occurs on a regular basis, as in your case though, that is abuse.

m9eSPvdfaa	I just had my third baby three months ago. I was always filled with strange paranoid thoughts. LOL, I promise you you are normal! You are just being bombarded by hormones and changes to your body on a daily basis that leave you paranoid and panicked. I spent each and every pregnancy fretting that my baby would be disabled, deformed or ugly! I was paranoid that every smell was toxic and if I forgot to take my vitamin i'd immediately panicked that my baby wasn't getting what he needed and would suffer some defect because of me. My boys were all born healthy, normal and handsome! Being pregnant just brings out the worrier. You stop thinking about yourself as a whole and focus solely on how everything could affect that growing belly. Just be sure to take care of yourself, get plenty of rest and remember that all mamas have been there. I'm sure your baby will be healthy and beautiful!|`|f2MmEMg5aa	O the joys of being pregnant! lol...the wonders and the "wondering" never cease! We all worry...as women in general and as soon to be mothers. It's a good thing we care but worrying can actually cause stress that can harm to bee bee. I used to(and sometimes still do) worry when a car is driving past me and i smell the gasoline or when im wating for a bus and a person is smoking next to me. It's only natural to have these thoughts because it shows that you are already developing that montherly instinct. Think about the good things to come and how much your gonna love holding that sweet angel for the first time! :)<br>  <br>  Congrats & good luck!|`|f8daaf4f3b625da7166d5b9cfc040254aa	Sweetheart, you need to first and foremost go in the bathroom, put some water on your face, sit down, put your feet up and relax. You need to calm your body first. You are just going through what most women go through when they are pregnant. You just need to relax. Your thoughts dont have an effect on whats going to happen to this baby. Whatever and if something does happen to your baby, God already made that plan a long time ago. Relax, mammi, ok! Stress however, can make you have a miscarriage. Dont let that happen. Calm down ok!

You're only looking out for the best interest of your baby, and you want it to be healthy. Having autism is not the biggest deal in the world, and just because someone in your family had a kid with autism doesn't mean you will. If you are worried about having a child with autism, don't vaccinate your child. Some children have weaker immune systems and autism can develop from getting vaccinations. <br>  <br>  No, if you think something, it will not come true just from thinking it. I'm sure the insect spray will not harm the baby, if you are worried about it, talk to your doctor, but in the mean time, relax. You aren't doing yourself or your baby any good by worrying all the time.<br>  <br>  <br>  Just relax and enjoy the rest of your pregnancy. Good luck!
1F6KJt0oaa	It isn't likely.  Not because the pill can't fail but if you had a negative test a month ago then while it is possible that you were pregnant at the time and it wasn't long enough to register or it hasn't been long enough for the symptoms you are describing.  This happens to my wife about once every two months so we always test but we try not to get our hopes up.  Here are some things that could affect it.  The negative test could be a result of being pregnant but not close enough to the next period to register on a test.  Second the pill takes a month before it is effective.  Third the pill is designed to make your body think that you are already pregnant so sometimes the symptoms follow the pill.  Fourth there are several types of pill and sometimes one or another will make a person sick or have the types of reactions you are describing.  <br>  <br>  Advice.  Take a pregnancy test.  If it is negative talk to your doctor about the problems you are having.  You may need to adjust or change your pill.  If it is positive talk to your doctor as you will need to start the pre-natal routine immediately.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Dont freak out you might just be experiencing side effects to the birthcontrol not everyone gets the same sideeffects...if you're really worried then take a trip to the doctor with your concerns so they can check you out, but it is possible to get pregnant of birthcontrol pills.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	Yes. <br>  <br>  It's possible.  No form of birth control is 100 percent effective. <br>  <br>  The first month on hormonal methods is always iffy. <br>  <br>  Your symptoms, however, also match the flu to some degree.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Yes.  Take a test.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	The first couple months of birth control can make you feel this way. I can't take them at all, they make me so sick. I have tried several different types. You should always use an extra form of birth control during the first month you start your pills. Your body needs to get used to the pill's hormones to be effective. Your Dr. should have told you this. So the fact that you had unprotected sex the first couple weeks of your period, means there is a chance that you are pregnant. All you can do is take a test and see. But what you are describing is how I felt every time I would start a birth control pill.|`|wqL84O8Naa	you're probably not pregnant if you had a period that long, HOWEVER, you need to be on birth control for a month before it starts to work, so perhaps you should have educated yourself. <br>  <br>  With the period, you're probably not pregnant, because the timing isn't even right, BUT as i said, your birth control hasnt even taken effect yet. Your symptoms sound like the flu and you're probably "noticing" extra symptoms because you're paranoid. <br>  <br>  You don't get a fever with morning sickness. If you've only been having unprotect sex for a week or two, you wouldn't be far enough along to have these symptoms. The symptoms you are describing don't start for 3-4 weeks AFTER implantation. You said you JUST started the pill this past month, and for the first few weeks you were protected, so you could truly only be 1 week along at this point. and you just finished your period...stop working yourself up over nothing|`|ysUqQ9Qkaa	It's possible.  No method of birth control is 100% effective.  Oral birth control hormonal pills are about 95 to 99 percent effective, which means they fail to work about 1 to 5 percent of the time.  Go see your doctor, they will have a much better idea of what is going on than random people on yahoo answers.|`|enqtxuUVaa	hiya <br>  Do a test anyway to find out. If thats negative go see your doc. The type of pill might not agree with you also get them to check for a water infection, that can give you flu like symptoms. i would of thought that if you started taking the pill as your period started the chances of falling pregnant were minimal. good luck|`|NuBBjdAUaa	well search the internet and if that doesn't work well you should take a pregancy test..yeah google it safer then yehoo can't say but google tell's you if the site's safe it'll show a green check mark if good orange if not that bad and red if really flow-in with virus|`|FYDw1rjlaa	Yes, it's possible so take a test.|`|sR7DbSVsaa	yes u can be prego i had those same symptoms when i was prego from my daughter
AA11531432	Even though you are married, its always a good idea to have protected sex.  The chances of you contacting a STD is very great these days.  Most of the symptoms you have described would lead me to believe that you are pregnant.  Even though you describe only about 30 days of symptoms in your question, most are accurate.  Could it be that perhaps your husband torn your blood linings somewhere?  Even one blood vessel rupturing could have lead to the blood symptoms.  Please go see a professional, I am worried about some of the other items you have described and don't want to get you overly alarmed, but please hurry to a doctor.<br>  <br>  Edna Romano|`|e87cd8e8c653d0f68402573b2d9f3ef1aa	I don't believe birth control is fool proof. But this could be symptoms of their side effects [which are rare in women but common actually.. You should read up on your brand of birth control]<br>  <br>  On the chance you could be pregnant; take a pregnancy test and regardless if it's outcome, go see your family doctor [or to a hospital clinic if you don't have one].<br>  <br>  My doctor told me a few years that she would've put me on birth control [long story] but since I wasn't having sex but since I was over weight and trying to lose weight; she wasn't going to put me on them because it more likely cause me to gain weight [among other things]<br>  <br>  Sorry I can't be of more help.

My boobs hurt, and was nauseated and all the lovely things ones body goes through, but I didn't know for sure until I took a pregnancy test. Don't wait to contact your doctor either.

m9eSPvdfaa	I'm not trying to freak you out in ANY way. This is just what happend to me....   I just had my third baby. He was absolutely huge and my pregnancy was very painful. I too had horrible excruciating pain and in the end I swelled up like the Michelin man. Couldn't wear shoes, couldn't wear my maternity clothes (was wearing my husbands shirts and giant pj pants below my belly) and I could barely stand or walk. My blood pressure was fine so no one seemed to care about the severe swelling and only checked for uti in response to my pain complaints.  I was brushed off as having "whiney pregnant lady" syndrome. At least that how I felt. I had to have a c-section and it turned out I had a large tumor in my uterus. You know you're in pain and that it isn't a normal pregnancy woe. Be insistant with those docs until they listen to you. And please don't let my experience freak you out.|`|FmSWPS7Paa	i defintitley hurts. but its normal. try sleeping with two pillows b/w your legs. i find it helps a little bit. i know what your feeling and it hurts. i dont really enjoy or get enough sleep anymore because of this pain as well. but its normal> baby is just getting bigger and starting to move down into the pelvis region|`|MFsuN8Doaa	I'm in the UK, and I had the same problem at my hospital. I got referred to a consultant (that's what we call our OB's) and it took me two appointments to convince them that the pain I was in was not just normal pregnancy pains (my problem is in my back as oppose to my pelvic). <br>  <br>  Can you not demand that you see an experienced OB? That's what I did - as a result I've got my problem diagnosed and sorted (going to be induced tomorrow). Could you ask to speak with a physio? In the UK Pelvic pain is death with by getting the woman assessed by a Physio who specialises in Obstetrics.|`|sR7DbSVsaa	i went thru the same feeling with my 4th baby that is just the pressure of ur baby buh it is normal dats wat my midwife told me

In the eyes of the law you should NOT be having sex with him until you are over 18, or both of you are legally married. I think this is an issue you should be discussing with your own parents instead of total strangers on yahoo. Since they would be the ones filing any criminal reports on the situation.|`|Zxd5nMrDaa	As far as my knowledge goes..no he won't get in trouble for simply dating you so long as there is NO sex involved.  If it's ONLY dating then I dont think it's much different than just being friends who really like each other and hang out one on one...which is not illegal.  So no...as long as you two dont have sex until you are legally an adult then neither of you will get in trouble...with the law that is.  Your parents may have a problem with their 16 yr old dating a 21 yr old but that's a whole other topic.|`|60f46466d2dd728810388e09955b9b12aa	explore and enjoy wonderful sex.<br>  u know each other for 3 years.let time decide whats ur future together

BGcVEjfGaa	Very very extremely very normal.  Its annoying and its NOT going to stop!  I've been preggo twice and it is just not fun.  Itching is one of the least of the annoying things that go along with stretching out to twice your size!  lol<br>  Please please don't scratch!  It can help with creating stretch marks.  What I used to do when my tummy itched was use some cocoa butter or vitamin E (any type of lotion is helpful) and rub it on and rub and rub and rub...it really helped and if you keep your skin moisturized it should itch less.  <br>  Congratulations and GOOOD LUCK!  :)|`|Rhr1umV1aa	It is your stomach stretching to make room for your uterus and baby to grow. To help ease the itching, put some lotion on your stomach when it starts to itch. It will also aid in the stretch marks if you are going to get any.|`|fUhVa18aaa	Give your doctor a call and ask.

ZVUrLZpXaa	24 weeks?That is a stillbirth.I am so sorry this tragedy happened to you.My daughter had a stillborn baby girl at 30 weeks last August,and we gave her a funeral and proper burial.I am in the USA,so it may vary from where you live,but here,stillborn babies...week 20 and after...are given to a funeral director of the parents' choice for cremation or burial,you get a death certificate,etc.|`|KozoNqpsaa	You really need to type more clearly...it's hard to understand you.

It sounds like you have lost your baby, and had very little after care. Go back to your doctor or practice nurse and explain that you need to understand what happened. They should go through the whole process with you - what happened to you and your baby and give you some sort of aftercare. I went through the same thing. At 24 weeks your baby is not very big - in the first weeks it develops, then in the latter stages of pregnancy, when everything is formed, thats when baby grows in size. Baby possibly came away with all the blood loss. At this stage it is termed a miscarriage depending on how close to the 24 weeks you are. I was 23 weeks and six days according to the hospitial dates - it makes a difference as to what happens to you and baby. Speak to your doctor or midwife who took you through your care from when you found you were pregnant. If the scan did not pick up anything and your womb was empty then you did give birth - but technically it was a late miscarriage. Please, please speak to some one - also check with your doctor re possible causes. Some times there is no cause, but after suffering three losses it was found I had "Sticky Blood" syndrome which was causing me to lose my babies. With simple medication I later went on to have my beautiful son. I hope you find the answers you are seeking.

hqogf9oGaa	I don't think that you are a bad Mum at all and disagree with people slating those who don't or can't breastfeed.<br>  <br>  Yes, there is a lot of pressure from health professionals to breastfeed but it must be remembered that many of these professionals were actively promoting bottle feeding only 10-20 years ago.  It has only been in recent years that they have begun to actively promote breast feeding again.<br>  <br>  Everyone knows the benefits for mother and baby of breast feeding however it is an entirely personal choice.  If breast feeding is stressful for the mother then it will also be stressful for the baby and in those circumstances maybe it's best to bottle feed.  Also, if the baby isn;t getting quite enough milk then surely it is beneficial to bottle feed to ensure that the baby still receives the essential nutrients etc.<br>  <br>  In your situation you brest fed your baby for three weeks and that, in itself will have given your baby a fantastic start so you should pat yourself on the back.  From what I read in the NHS breast feeding guide I was given the most beneficial "milk" for your baby to have is in the first few days when you are producing colostrum as this is the concentrated milk that contains the boost for the baby's immune system.<br>  <br>  Either way, there will always be those who are for and against breast feeding for whatever reason.  I am hoping that I will be able to breastfeed my baby and eventually move on to expressing so that my husband can help out with night time feeds etc but I refuse to stress myself about it and feel bad if it doesn't quite work - at least I will know I tried my best.  I was a bottle fed baby as were my older and younger sister and we have never suffered any ill effects from it - no ill health or development issues.  The formula milk these days contains everything a baby needs to thrive and one of the only things I have heard friends say with regard to them bottle feeding their baby is that their little ones sometimes get a little constipated and they put it down to that however, they can't be sure.<br>  <br>  So long as a mother always has the baby's best interests at heart then where's the problem??<br>  <br>  Indigo<br>  <br>  xxx|`|nZVmkZSBaa	You're going to get a whole lot of crap about this. L0l.<br>  <br>  I am planning on breastfeeding my dughter for as long as I can. I think it is healthier, and is the better thing to do. It is more selfish not to even try. If you tried, and you simply couldn't ... Not much more you could do. It's either bottlefeed, or starve the poor girl. You tried, didn't you? You don't seem like a bad mother, I'm sure you're a great one. Just ignore them.<br>  Good luck. x.|`|MVgm17o3aa	Breastfeeding was not for me either..I did not breastfeed any of my 2 children and they are very healthy kids...It was just not for me and nobody was going to tell me otherwise...To each their own|`|a8IRxC4raa	Whatever works for you is best.<br>  <br>  I breastfed for a grand total of 11 days.  We switched to bottle feeding because I was not producing enough milk and there was no milk bank in my area.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|prqrQcd1aa	What I think... At least you tried! That's all that matters honestly.. It doesn't matter if you feed your child one way or another... AS LONG AS YOUR CHILD IS FED! lol|`|QnJvJ67uaa	A volitile question. The breast feeding militi will make anyone who bottle feedsout to be a bad person, they quote facts and figures and make sur eyou know that they think you are a 15 yr old with a tight ponytail that lives on a council estate.<br>  I wanted to breast feed, after all who dosn;t at least want to TRY!<br>  Baby no.1 born prem...tube fed for 3 weeks to try and establish breast feeding, constantly in danger of asperating milk if the rube came dislodged. I watched mums stay for WEEKS with healthy babies that wouldn;t breast feed> I demanded to bottle feed so I could take him home..within 24 hrs they discharged us.<br>  Baby no.2. Very sleepy, in danger of heading down to special care so I expressd and bottle fed...he had @ 6 weeks of breast milk, more than enough to recive his vital antibodies.<br>  Baby no.3 Emergancy C section..in Special care for 7 weeks...unable to have breast milk due to reflux that caused apnea attacks..breast milk nearly killed him, he was ressusateded 3 times, then put on a special formular that he could hold down.<br>  So if I had insisted on my "right" to breast feed my youngest child would be dead.<br>  The main point here is happy healthy babies. Parenting is hard enough without the middle class yummy mummies spitting at us.<br>  you are a GOOD mum...and don;t forget...most of our generation was bottle fed...in the 1970's hardly any mum breast fed..my mum can remember being in hospital and all the middle class mums being shocked at the Irish lady on the ward who whipped her boobs out to feed LOL. The point is WE turned out ok...and formular and sterilising has come on a long way since the 70's.<br>  Breast is best, but bottle feeding is the next best thing.      <br>  Good luck x|`|veO1RXrCaa	I couldn't breast feed my son.  He was just too frantic and would not latch.  He was a hungry baby and really it was just a better choice to switch him onto the bottle so he could get what he needed.  This time I don't care if I b.f or not.  If I do I do. if not so what.  I beat myself up so bad the last time.  I felt like a horrible mom and a failure.  He is now 6 and thriving.  I never really encountered a breast feeding nazi until I came here.  Now its just sad that someone things they have the right to berate someone else based on their choice.  If it worked for you awesome.  It didn't for me and many others and we did awesome too.  You use the tools you are given.  And to hell with those who can't see past their own self importance.  Their kid is no more special or smart then mine.|`|xEXb96UKaa	no, you are not a bad mother. what good is a mum to her baby if she is depressed and exhausted because breastfeeding isn't working for her? yes we all know that "breast is best", but sometimes it is simply not best for mum. it is just as important to have a happy mum and if breastfeeding is too stressful then infant formula is an option. it may not have all the antibody properties of mums own milk, but the formulas that are available today are much better than there were years ago. your daughter got the most important milk, colostrum, by breastfeding her for the 3 weeks and even though i believe that EVERY baby should get her mothers colostrum in the first few days after birth, if continuing to breastfed doesn't suit for whatever reason she should not be made feel guilty for her choice to formula feed after that.|`|snmHwWgJaa	I'm very pro breast feeding so I did for a very long time.  That was the best decision for my child and family.  You have to do what is best for your child and family, you and your husband are the only ones who know what that is.  Don't let anyone tell you different whether you breast feed or bottle feed.  The most important thing is that you love and take care of your baby to the best of your abilities.|`|tfdQxfrpaa	Breastfeeding, obviously is the best thing for baby...however, if it is to much for the mother to handle then I don't think they should feel pressure, or guilt for doing something else. I think as a mother we need to try to do it for as long as we possibly can, and we need to be surrounded by support. However, there may come a time when the mother feels as though she cannot continue for one reason or another. I definitely do not think she should be persecuted or guilt ridden for deciding to stop. That's why we have formula.|`|a933b2083877b7650088457f02892917aa	at least you gave it a go- that is all you can do! My sister did the same thing and was expressing into a bottle for her baby because he wouldn't latch on but it was so tiring and painful and in the end she turned to formula. The priority is feeding the child, whether it be breast or formula! all babies are different and the main thing is that you are a good mum because your baby is being fed and well looked after!|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	i think its disgusting for anyone to pass comment on whether a woman breast feeds or not. it's personal choice for some others simply cant breastfeed.i didn't breastfeed any of my 3 children and it never did them any harm mine was personal choice although i doubt i could of breastfed as i have inverted nipples.don't listen to negative comments its your choice and i think breast feeding means all of your time gets taken up and unless u express your milk you cant share the joys of feeding with a partner.|`|tFQda1nMaa	I think you should do what you can, but if you can't there is no point in fretting about it. I hope I'll be able to breast feed, but I know that it may not be possible. Its really no one else's business. <br>  Your child got her first feed, which will be good for her immune system, and it sounds like you did your best. At the end of the day that's all you can do! x|`|s8VY7uReaa	Hun everyone is different when it comes to breastfeeding..you see your too exhausted due to pre-eclampsia. So if your baby isnt getting full by your breast milk then you got every right to bottle feed. And why care what other people think? some people are very judgmental. you should ignore people who make stupid comments like that.|`|MI53mUKzaa	no you are not a bad mother.  i too tried breastfeeding but none of my children would take the breast.  so would that make me a bad mother?  no so don't worry about it.  it is obvious you love your child and that is all that matters.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Sometimes you just cant breastfeed.That does not make you a bad mother.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	i planned on breastfeeding my firstborn entirely....but she wasnt getting enough and was having issues latching on.  so from the get go (at the hospital) i was doing both.  she probably got 3-4 bottles of formula a day and the rest she was breastfed.  i actually liked it this way...i knew that for the majority of her food she was getting what was best for her (breastmilk) but the convenience of formula was great (for when we went out...so i didnt have to nurse in public...etc).  i encourage breastmilk because it is proven to be the best (God's intent for babies!)...but there are circumstances and situations where it can't be done as well...and that is why there is formula out there.|`|18e6c6ba7e558bb945b46902f7a5f9fbaa	No of course your not a bad mother you,ve done what you think is best for your daughter and that's all that matters the other mums are just gloating what really matters here is the baby's needs they come first and if breast milk just wasn't meeting her needs then formula is the next best thing its still proper food.Ive had a while thinking about other mums including myself bitching about how they look after there kids and looking down on other mums which is totally unacceptable we should be here for support and friendship not criticising or gloating|`|1NDHSSqwaa	I can so understand what you are saying. I have heard so many people being nasty about people who choose to bottle feed. I have heard mothers calling formula milk 'swill' and 'evil'. I think it is pathetic that some women feel the need to put-down mothers for their personal choices. Unfortunately these sort of debates happen with many other baby-related issues such as circumcision, vegetarianism in babies, ear piercing and cloth vs reusable nappies.<br>  <br>  I just think these people are highly ignorant for labelling a mother as a bad parent just because they choose not to conform to the things they think are right. As long as the babies are happy, healthy and loved that is all that matters.|`|BuE1rhGoaa	You are NOT a bad mother. Those who said that you are  need to shut up. I tried to breast feed both of my  kids and I could not. I never had any.  I am a very Intelligent woman.  I used formula and both of my kids are healthy.  My aunt was breastfeeding and having to bottle feed because her son would drink her dry and she had a Large chest with tons of milk. <br>  <br>  >>Sometimes people who haven't had kids should not give advice as to What to do and What not to do. Even if they say that they babysit that they know actually they know very  little.  <br>  >>What the h*ll is Chav's?<br>  >|`|CugCzH9iaa	Breastfeeding is (health wise) the best thing for the baby. There can be no argument there, its just the facts.  I do not get why so many people think it is their business to tell you what you should do though.  It's your baby and your decision.  I breastfeed and LOVE it.  I would not have it any other way.  I do see the positive in bottles though. <br>  <br>   I know this woman and EVERY time she see's me she asks are you still breastfeeding?!  She is not family and not even a close friend just an acquaintance. It drives me nuts that she feels it is ok to ask that so often! I do believe breastfeeding is best but it is not my business to judge. You do what you feel is right for you.  try not to let people bother you with their 'advice"  This is just the start of it.  I get crap all the time with all three of my kids from all kinds of women on what I should give them to eat, how I should punish, what they are allowed to watch, and what their bedtimes should be...it never ends.|`|FasxVeohaa	Listen some people are just rude. Of course you will always get those one-sided people who think that what they think is the only right way. I wanted to breast feed my baby and wasn't able to because I didn't produce milk. If your body doesn't produce or is not able to. THan that makes you such a bad person/mom. I DON'T THINK SO. Some babys don't latch on either so that makes them bad babys too right? (LOL) no it is a very hard thing and is a big commitment to breast feed. They have done a lot of research and the formula they use today has just the same almost than breast milk. They dont lack anything..please dont listen to people|`|b8f0CfSsaa	I also tried to breast feed but I contracted mastitis which at the later stages can be poisonous for your baby (also what use is a mother with a terrible fever!)<br>  <br>  If you can breast feed then yes, 'breast is best'! However if you genuinely can't then bottle feeding is fine, there is nothing wrong with trying your hardest and then using formula. Whilst it isn't as good it would not be on the market if it was at all bad for a baby.<br>  <br>  The whole thing about chavs is ridiculous! Women in lower income areas aren't as likely to breast feed because they receive less support and information. They usually live in denseley populated areas with not enough support to go round.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Stay at home mum I swear I almost wet myself at your answer! I see what you mean about you can feel like the next Karen Matthews after being berated over every single one of your parenting skills here!|`|claUGpVRaa	I am expecting my first child (2 days overdue!) and I am planning to try and breast feed. I really want to be able to do this and have read loads of books on better ways to build up your milk supply so you do have enough to feed baby, but until it happens, I have no idea how I am going to get on, and fully realise my 'plan' may fall apart completely after I have had the baby! <br>  I will do my best as you did, but I think it is wrong of people to judge on here when they don't know the individual situation. If a woman finds she cannot breast feed then there is nothing wrong with switching to bottle feeding. A mother will do what she feels is best for her baby always.|`|wghrc3Deaa	you are not a bad mother for not breast feeding, yes people prefer it because it is said that the baby gets anti-bodies into the baby and  protects them from some illnesses " i think !" <br>  but at the end of the day if you are not up to it and it will make you worse and tired and after all that child needs you to be at your best to look after it and love it! <br>  <br>   I think that's the most important thing!|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Breastfeeding is hard! I breastfed for 4 months and went back to work. I couldn’t keep up with his increased feedings. But I did my best!<br>  <br>  Breastfeeding is good. But formula is fine too!

For all know you might hang your child in the closet every night and beat her every morning..... but, based on your feeding decisions alone, you are not a bad mother.)<br>  <br>  There are rude people on Y!A.  ANY question on ANY subject is going to result in nasty, troll-like responses.  So, ignore the rude people.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i think hanging out in the N &B section will do that to people.  i now know that i have neglected my child for allowing them to cry ever and i should be hung because i considered piercing my daughters ears.  i should have never had children before consulting the yahoos.  that was my mistake.  my next child will only be raised by the standards that the yahoos have set forth.  that is the only way.  although i am still confused on who it is wrong to circumcise - my husband or my son.|`|j2mRop0laa	Well guess what.. both sides of the argument can hate on me because I did both. lol<br>  I wasn't comfortable with the *act* of breastfeeding.

vue9NOhYaa	It depends on your location and your doctor and your insurance coverage.   They will probably want to do a regular office visit as well, so you'll have to pay for that too.  <br>  <br>  Unless you have some definite reason for a blood test (like you MUST find out ASAP, or you're having symptoms and a very  late period and the home tests are negative), just buy an OTC home test.  You'll save a lot of money.<br>  <br>  BTW, someone said that it's free if you're insured.  This is not necessarily true. Some insurance plans pay for everything. Some have deductables and co-pays.  And in any case, having unnecessary tests because it's 'free' is one of the reasons that insurance premiums are skyrocketing.|`|Wd7ujHNhaa	Mine was $165, but that is what they would have charged me if I didn't have insurance.  Because I did have insurance, it was free for me.  I also live in the mountains of North Carolina, and the cost of healthcare is more expensive here than it is at other places.  I have seen where people in other cities and states have paid alot less.  Call your doctors office, they would be able to give you an exact price.  Good Luck!!!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Depends.

RPc63EK2aa	Everyone has brief pauses in their breathing pattern called apnea. Usually these brief stops are completely normal.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, though, apnea can cause a prolonged pause in breathing, making the breathing pattern irregular. Someone with apnea might actually stop breathing for short amounts of time, decreasing oxygen levels in the body and disrupting sleep.<br>  <br>  Types of Apnea<br>  The word apnea comes from the Greek word meaning "without wind." Although it's perfectly normal for everyone to experience occasional pauses in breathing, apnea can be a problem when breathing stops for 20 seconds or longer.<br>  <br>  There are three types of apnea:<br>  <br>  obstructive <br>  central <br>  mixed <br>  Obstructive Apnea<br>  A common type of apnea in children, obstructive apnea is caused by an obstruction of the airway (such as enlarged tonsils and adenoids). This is most likely to happen during sleep because that's when the soft tissue at back of the throat is most relaxed. As many as 1% to 3% of otherwise healthy preschool-age kids have obstructive apnea.<br>  <br>  Symptoms include:<br>  <br>  snoring (the most common) followed by pauses or gasping <br>  labored breathing while sleeping <br>  very restless sleep and sleeping in unusual positions <br>  changes in color <br>  Because obstructive sleep apnea may disturb sleep patterns, these children may also show continued sleepiness after awakening in the morning and tiredness and attention problems throughout the day. Sometimes apnea can affect school performance. One recent study suggests that some kids diagnosed with ADHD actually have attention problems in school because of disrupted sleep patterns caused by obstructive sleep apnea.<br>  <br>  Treatment for obstructive apnea involves keeping the throat open to aid air flow, such as with adenotonsillectomy (surgical removal of the tonsils and adenoids) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which is delivered by having the child wear a nose mask while sleeping.<br>  <br>  Central Apnea<br>  Central apnea occurs when the part of the brain that controls breathing doesn't start or properly maintain the breathing process. In very premature infants, it's seen fairly commonly because the respiratory center in the brain is immature. Other than being seen in premature infants, central apnea is the least common form of apnea and often has a neurological cause.<br>  <br>  Mixed Apnea<br>  Mixed apnea is a combination of central and obstructive apnea and is seen particularly in infants or young children who have abnormal control of breathing. Mixed apnea may occur when a child is awake or asleep.<br>  <br>  Conditions Associated With Apnea<br>  Apnea can be seen in connection with:<br>  <br>  Apparent Life-Threatening Events (ALTEs)<br>  An ALTE itself is not a sleep disorder — it's a serious event with a combination of apnea and change in color, change in muscle tone, choking, or gagging. Call 911 immediately if your child shows the signs of an ALTE.<br>  <br>  ALTEs, especially in young infants, are often associated with medical conditions that require treatment Examples of these medical conditions include gastroesophogeal reflux (GERD), infections, or neurological disorders. ALTEs are scary to observe, but can be uncomplicated and may not happen again. However, any child who has an ALTE should be seen and evaluated immediately.<br>  <br>  Apnea of Prematurity (AOP)<br>  AOP can occur in infants who are born prematurely (before 34 weeks of pregnancy). Because the brain or respiratory system may be immature or underdeveloped, the baby may not be able to regulate his or her own breathing normally. AOP can be obstructive, central, or mixed.<br>  <br>  <br>  Treatment for AOP can involve the following:<br>  <br>  1.keeping the infant's head and neck straight (premature babies should always be placed on their backs to sleep to help keep the airways clear) <br>  2.medications to stimulate the respiratory system <br>  3.continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) — to keep the airway open with the help of forced air through a nose mask <br>  4.oxygen|`|h85kkDsbaa	I would keep going back or get a second opinion, I have never known teething to do this.

Because this is NOT normal!! <br>  This is one of the scariest things you can ever experience as a parent!! <br>   I truly feel for you, Hun. My daughter was 18mo when i took her on vacation with me we were there about a week when she stopped breathing, she was awake and gasping for air. long story short from the paramedics, to the ER at the hospital, then a family practice Dr they all said she was fine. So I decided to go home early and took her in to see her pediatrician and he wasn't with her for more than 2 min and said she had pneumonia. I guess my point is that you should be sure to take your baby to a pediatrician, they are up to date with the illnesses of children and are trained to see the signs and symptoms that other family practice Dr.'s are not.<br>  I would also advise you to contact the medical board and inform them of your experience that you've had with this Dr. . The medical board doesn't think highly of neglectful Dr.'s. In fact they tend to shun them. Make sure that this guy doesn't hurt anybody elses baby, please.<br>  Care and Bless

I was so depressed because I felt like a bad mother for it. I kept telling her father that I felt so horrible, and wanted to know why I didn't feel anything?<br>  <br>  This lasted until my daughter and I started to settle into a routine, and until I learned how she was communicating with me. Once she started being able to move around on her own, and eat, it became easy to "love" her, in fact, I can't imagine my life without her, nor do I want to. <br>  <br>  I don't want to say your love grows... but your relationship definitely does, much like your relationship does with everyone else. This newborn is a virtual stranger, and no one should expect an instant connection, though some women do feel it.<br>  <br>  Added: It also gets easier once you start to sleep through the night again =) Being sleep deprived is no fun at all.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	my son was unplanned, so i dont know if that had anything to do with it, but i loved him when he was born, but really started APPERICATING him as he got older. he's now 1 and i cant imagine my life w/out him<br>  <br>  ps. you really should change yoru name. you sounds like a crazy killer w/ susan smith as your name.|`|dDVAUA9saa	I agree with you.

From the delivery up until the first 5 months or so of my 1st child's life, I really just felt like a mother caring for her child, with no real bond except that the baby was needing me to take care of it. But when my 1st child started to respond to me and to know how to smile and play and laugh, then that is when my love started growing for him. The older they are, the more you get to know the baby and the closer they are to you.<br>  <br>  For me, I think of babies and bonding with them like when you meet someone new. That before you start to really care about anyone, you get to know them first. And the more you know them and their personalities, the more you love them. <br>  <br>  For me however, having the 2nd child was so much easier for me to bond with since now I know what will become of that newborn who at first does not really show their personality but as they grow, I know there is something wonderful to look forward to!|`|488edafbffd854a7df677efa90768cabaa	My experience seems to be a little different from the others. With both my daughters, I was passionately in love with them from the very first day. As they grow, I certainly love them, but not with the intense spark that I started out with. Of course, they are still the smartest, most beautiful girls that ever lived but they are also strong willed, over-sensitive, jealous of each other and they have worn me down. So sometimes I love them more by choice than by heart.|`|idn1OQucaa	As hard as it is to imagine ever loving your baby more than you already do, I found that the love just keeps growing and growing and growing.  With that, though, also comes a kind of natural process of gradually letting go, too - so it's all very complicated.    :)|`|1KIwM1uOaa	When I ha my oldest daughter, the first time I held her I could not imagine ever loving someone more than I did her at that moment  but I was wrong every day the love I feel for my kids gets stronger but even more with each da I have respected them more for being the person that they are.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Each day I can't imagine ever being able to love them more, then the next day I do.|`|MW3Br5V8aa	i love him more everytime i think about him which is usually about 100 times a minute! lol..<br>  <br>  u cant help it they are the best things in ur life.. :)|`|cn91FeWcaa	it should

Merci papa, merci maman.<br>  Ceci dit, je suis parti sans rien demander et j'aurais très bien compris qu'ils ne veulent pas ou ne puissent pas (vus les revenus!).

h57t7FAjaa	I think Elliot is fine for a girl, and the nn Ellie is cute too.  As far as the mn Mae I love it, and it is a little common, but the nn Ellie Mae is adorable!  (I love Abigail Mae for a girl too, Abby Mae)<br>  <br>  I also think Jaelen is very pretty, but not so much the spelling...<br>  maybe Jaelyn? I just think it makes it a little more feminine looking!<br>  <br>  mn suggestions:<br>  Jaelyn Paige<br>  Jaelyn Sophia<br>  Jaelyn Sienna<br>  Jaelyn Emma<br>  Jaelyn Nicole<br>  Jaelyn Shae<br>  Jaelyn Eva<br>  Jaelyn Audra<br>  <br>  & theres a lot more, but those are my favorite... it goes very nicely with a lot of names!<br>  <br>  For boys I think Evan Anthony is very nice, Evan is such a nice name!<br>  <br>  Kale is definitely different, dont think ive heard it before... but I like it!  It is hard to put a middle name with though.  Maybe use it as a mn?<br>  <br>  some mn suggestions:<br>  Kale Joshua<br>  Kale Chase<br>  Kale Parker<br>  Kale Mason<br>  Kale James<br>  Kale Reese<br>  <br>  <br>  or if you use it as a mn:<br>  Evan Kale<br>  Anthony Kale<br>  Issac Kale<br>  Noah Kale<br>  Gavin Kale<br>  Brandon Kale<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and good luck!  You have such nice names picked though, you should be fine :)|`|AA11273571	I think Ellis is prettier than Elliot, and you can still call her Ellie or Elle.<br>  Ellis is nice for a boy or a girl.  <br>  <br>  Ellis Jaelen (tho' I prefer Jaylen) is pretty. <br>  <br>  Evan is also a beautiful name for a girl.  Very classic sounding. <br>  <br>  I also like Ebby for a girl.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck !!!|`|eDmdkUO3aa	Elliot is a boy name. How about Ella, Elle, Ellie, or Ellery? And Mae is a nice middle name. I would go with Evan Kale for a boy, Evan Anthony don't sound right.|`|KOcCenrEaa	I don't like Ellie May or Jaelen.<br>  I don't like Evan much either.<br>  <br>  Elliot as a girl name reminds me of the girl from scrubs.|`|VEkkn2Otaa	Elliot May is not very pretty and to call her Elli May is just mean!|`|EPXmxoFMaa	Evan Anthony is nice! Elliot May is nice, but May is very common. Actually, Mae is common, not May. May is MUCH nicer! Elliot May flows really well. You could just use Elli as the first name instead, or Ella, Ellie, Elisa, Eloise, etc..|`|AA10446930	for girl: How about, Mary Jaelen (and I know it became the first name instead of the middle one :|)<br>  but I like the name "Gaia Rhae" better.<br>  <br>  for boy: Kale Ian, but I think I like the name Walter or Caleb better.|`|5zLZchUPaa	I think jaelen is a nice name for a girl maybe Jaelen rose im not sure for a middle name. and I love the name Kale for a boy they are both unique names.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|CZnRI2xRaa	How about Ellery instead of Elliot? It's like the boy's name Ellory but a little more feminine spelling :)<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it, May isn't that popular since Grace and Marie took over.<br>  <br>  Jaelen Beth|`|78wH9ee4aa	Why don't you call her Ellise and it still will be Elli in short, Amy can be the middle name.|`|vgImdBFqaa	I like.|`|BGcVEjfGaa	I actually LIke Elliot a lot.  It think it is cute!  May is a common name and Elli May is cute for a baby but when she's in her teens or older...She may not like it so much.  If you like the M you could go with something like Marisa, or Madison.  That would be kinda cute.  <br>  <br>  Really like Jaelen.  Elliot Jaelen or Jaelen Elliot would be really cool too.   <br>  <br>  I think that a good middle name for Kale would be something like Donovan.  I think that Kale Donovan or Kale Noah would be nice.  Definitely something with more than one syllable.  I guess it kind of depends on your last name, though, because that changes everything.  I have two boys, Coltan Gage, and Deidrich Noah, so I"m a fan of the not so usual names.<br>  <br>  Kale Anthony would be good. <br>  <br>  Not a fan of Evan, though.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  :)|`|MW1yrHbOaa	i like jaelen for a girl, middle names could be-- nicole, marie, ashley, renee, madison, anne<br>  i like evan anthony<br>  i love kale--- kale michael, kale ryan, kale anthony, kale tyler
ZcrsqMbcaa	takes after mom?|`|OHfZFR31aa	Has she had any change of diet in the past month? If so, that could be the cause. If she's eating exactly the same things as before, then she might have some sort of digestive issue.<br>  <br>  I find that too much dairy gives really smelly ones. As do any sort of legumes (beans, peas, chickpeas, lentils), cabbage and broccoli<br>  <br>  Light color poo can often come from too much dairy as well. How much milk/cheese/yogurt is she eating a day? She might be lactose intolerant, as gas and diarrhea are symptoms of lactose intolerance.|`|sqaey2Siaa	hahaha. I just had to laugh. Its probably just something she ate. Terrible fart smells like everything else will soon pass.|`|vEv2YwWdaa	It is most likely what you are feeding her.  Some foods cause more gas then others.  Some produce worse smells then others.|`|xbzCxo8yaa	You need to check her diet.................you may be giving her foods that let off lots of gas.....................
JfRqYOSqaa	Show her a McDonald's commercial.|`|Rhr1umV1aa	Show her a mcdonalds bag. But really I wouldn't worry about it. She wanted that for the name then let her have it.

SBx28SIDaa	Your mom might be letting you have the chance to come clean with her. I always thought that my mom knew that I was drinking while I was 18 and she did but what hurt her the most was that I lied to her by not telling her the whole story of what I was doing on the nights that I was out. Pot and drinking are not the best things in the world and if I got the chance to do it over again out of respect for my parents I would not have drank.|`|DXzUCgj8aa	she probably smokes too!!|`|hbP3iimAaa	maybe she is ok with it? or maybe she smokes too?|`|8jY4JUw7aa	sit down and talk with her|`|qKUMaJcXaa	Stupid girl doing drugs|`|hpeCvV6Caa	just get her to join in with you. hionestly ya never know what might happen|`|zBz10IiOaa	why don't you be a man and ask her why she didnt get upset?|`|cP03k3cXaa	why are you asking us and not her?|`|oHNsAcInaa	Okay? not really a question to answer.|`|yV8fog7Paa	try to make her proud by quitting, stop killing yourself.|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	As a parent i did not always confront my kids about what i thought they were doing wrong but say for example in a case like yours i would make it very clear how i felt about smoking dope without saying i know you've did it.Then at the right time i would slip in statements like if some one was high and driving a car down a mountain road would they want to be in that car. I'm afraid from how it sounds like you've started a bad drive down that mountain road and your Mother may not have the courage to stop you.|`|l1STgPyRaa	your mom might have a  friend that works for the drug squid and she might be going to phone them to come and search your house.<br>  <br>  they are good like that just call and ask them to come out and if they have the time they will come out <br>  <br>  but why not just be happy about it she knows no more hiding hay don't know why kids hid that anyway i mean if it is so good why keep it away from the parents?|`|0udjgaoBaa	She was probably wondering if you dipped into her stash...Just dont try any harder drugs NO ONE has ever overdosed on weed...Have fun and be careful!|`|pOZubuOcaa	Maybe she did it to when she was your age?<br>  or maybe she wants you to confess to her<br>  <br>  not really sure|`|r0ISrLc1aa	aha suuuucks mahnn, I would keep smoking but make sure to hide your weed well.
d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	You sound normal to me :) You are not sleeping, your body aches, so of course you are a tad grumpy. Try to be patient with your daughter. I know how you feel, I have a 13, 4 and 2 year boys and I am 36 weeks.  is a bit overwhelming sometimes. I feel like I am snapping a lot at them too. I just last night sat them all down and asked them to bear with me for a few more weeks..lol. If this helps any...with my third baby. I was dilated 3cm for over a week.  Never noticed losing my mucous plug, never had any contractions and then all of a sudden, 16 days before my due date, I start having contractions every 5 minutes. My water didn't break, she had to do that minutes before pushing. Contractions started at midnight and I was holding my baby at 6 am. I had no previous pains or symptoms of labor other than the dilating, and that hadn't changed in a week. So it could come on all of a sudden when you least expect it. Try to hang in there!! It is almost over. Good Luck!!|`|6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	What you are feeling is anxiety and stress which can explain the snapping one min and feeling happy the other. It is a normal behavior but if you experience anything extreme like wanting to kill yourself or your loved ones, go to the dr IMMEDIATELY.  I think bec you were overdue last time, you are stressin that it may happen again this time bec as you say, you have no braxton hicks or any other signs. Just relax and take it one day at a time. Breathe.....  this too shall pass and you will have your baby that youve been waiting for all these months. I wish you the best and good luck!!! A lot of people want to have kids but they cant so consider yourself truly blessed.|`|FfGHHhqBaa	hey a cold is usually a good sign, believe it or not but every woman on my mothers side of the family gets a cold a few days before they go into labor but if that is not the case then just try to get lots of rest, if there is anyone who can help you with your daughter then take advantage of it...
BW7Nrqjzaa	Just sounds like engorgement. My boobs get super hard and feel like they're full of rocks. Just make sure you're nursing a lot and use heat pads or take a nice hot shower. Massage also helps, just be prepared to leak.<br>  <br>  If you're not nursing avoid heat and any manipulation of the breast. Wear a tight fitting bra and use an ice pack.<br>  <br>  And hormone fluctuations can give you the chills.|`|QHpq3QpAaa	Put a heat pack on it this will help to loosen it up and get the milk flowing, also feed the baby as often as you can.|`|6hA0O06xaa	Hopefully you had a lump under each armpit.  This is engourgement and it will last a few days until your body figures out how much milk your baby is taking.  Try pumping a little just to relieve the pressure (not too much or your body will think it needs to make that much!).  Or try taking a warm shower and some tylanol.<br>  <br>  If you really only had a lump near one armpit/side-boob, than maybe you have a plugged duct.  Always nurse first on that side until your baby unplugs it.  And try massaging it slowly down toward the nipple while you take a hot shower.|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	When I was engorged (when my milk first came in) I had lots of sore lumps..its normal with engorgment..and WILL go away. Just keep nursing, and then massage with a warm rag before nursing.|`|jN3pRKkEaa	It is probably engorgement of a mammery gland.  My breasts got full of lumps when my milk came in too.|`|JU3TLLYjaa	try massaging it out when you feed, it may just be blocked milk duct|`|GJgZVKvXaa	The lump may be a blocked milk duct.  Since your milk just came in, your breasts are engorged and the swelling can cause blockages to develop.  If it is a blockage, the following things may help work it out:<br>  <br>  - applying moist warm compresses to the area (soak a towel in hot water) or taking a hot shower<br>  <br>  - gentle massage of the area, moving your fingers in a rotating or raking motion<br>  <br>  - anti inflammatory medication like Advil or Motrin<br>  <br>  - frequent nursing from the affected breast (there is nothing wrong with the milk from this breast and nursing will not harm your baby)<br>  <br>  The chills are probably from your temperature being elevated.  You should continue to monitor your temperature.  If it goes over 100.4 you should call your doctor, a temperature can indicate an infection like mastitis (infection of the breast), which is extremely common in new nursing moms.  If you have mastitis you need antibiotics.  Mastitis is not dangerous for your baby - in fact it will help you to continue to nurse!! - but it can become very painful for you.  <br>  <br>  If your doctor is dismissive about your fever, tell her about the lump and that you think you have mastitis.  She should take you seriously.|`|Rhr1umV1aa	The lump under your armpit is mostlikely your lymphnoid. Usually when they are swollen it means that you have an infection somewhere. I would call the doctor and have them put you on an antibiotic. Hope this helps.
3K7ffKn2aa	yes if your mom is dark then you have a gene for dark skin. I don't know the chances but there is a possibility of it coming up in your child. Darker genes are dominate and lighter are recessive but i think most likely you child would be either light or a lighter brown.|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	I am a chocolate honey, my husband is Jewish, I have the whitest baby you have ever seen. If I had another one, who knows (or cares) what color it would be. <br>  <br>  Anything is possible, I have no idea why this matters to people lol|`|tLGbtmGsaa	It really depends on the genes.  I am white and the father of my twins is Maori (New Zealand native)  and he is quite dark.  My twins look Maori but have pale skin like me.  The twins paternal grandmother is Maori also but she is pale like me.  Their paternal grandfather is really dark skinned so I think it all comes down to the colour genes.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	anything is possible.  i have heard stories of a white couple producing a black baby because one of them had black relatives somewhere in their past.  its all in the genes. :o)|`|yKS2UI87aa	If I had to guess it would probably be light like you but there would be a possibility of a nice golden tan|`|8jY4JUw7aa	TANISH BROWN|`|K5Vi0APEaa	It's very possible. You just won't know until they are born. Both my husband and I have parents where one is very fair and the other is very dark. We both have lighter complexions as opposed to dark, while most would have thought that we would have been a little bit browner.  On top of that, our son has an extremely fair complexion with red hair, so it appears that the recessive genes were actually dominant in his case, so you just never know.  Genetic make up is something that you can try to predict, but nature does what it will. Good luck to you.|`|rc52fIZQaa	I think that your daughters will be like in the middle of you and your mother and your sons will be like you, your husband and your father. \<br>  <br>  Go to www.makemebabies.com (maybe it will help)<br>  <br>  Bye ;D|`|a644ae7f54d9fee91d9eade135db3151aa	its quite possiable you could have a dark baby, it depends which genes for skin colour you pass on.|`|mejlODtYaa	well you kid may be mix color

Porém, a pilula do dia seguinte tem uma eficácia em torno de apenas 85% e quanto mais tarde você tomar, menor a eficácia dela. Aconselho que você consulte um ginecologista e comece a utilizar um método anti-consepcional mais eficaz como a pilula e utilizar camisinha para evitar doen?as.

L'essere umana è in primo luogo un animale, e come tale , eni proprio geni esiste solo per nascere, procreare e morire. é dimostrato infatti che nelle situazioni di pericolo ci sono persone che hanno effettuato cose straordinarie, ma sempre e solo per salvare i propri figli, infatti l'istinto cerca solo di salvare la prole in quanto dentro di noi c'è scritto che dobbiampo riprodurci.<br>  <br>  QUello che ho scritto è documentato nei trattati di psicologia, se vuoi approffondire l'argomento cerca su internet il cervello triunico e scoprirai tante cose, ciao

Après tout, il faut être deux pour faire un enfant et si vous ne voulez pas en concevoir un maintenant, il faut être ferme avec votre compagnon. Même si vous aimez votre ami, c'est votre corps, vous êtes libre de faire ce que vous voulez. De plus, si vous avez une grossesse non désirée, vous risquez d'être stressée et de faire une bonne dépression post-partum ( baby-blues).

Ce que tu veux n'est absolument pas fiable. Je te conseil soit la pillule ou soit un implant. Dans les deux cas tu es protéger pq il impossible de calculer un cycle surtout que le tien est irrégulier. Pour les femmes qui ont des difficultés a tomber enceinte il es conseillé de prendre sa température afin de surveiller un pic qui prouve l'ovulation. Mais ce n'est^non très fiable surtout en ces tps hivernaux.<br>  Parles en a ton ami, si il t'aimes il devrait comprendre. Et puis c'est peut être le moment de vous expliquer et exprimer au sujet de concevoir un enfant.<br>  Bonne continuation et bonne année 2008|`|vDfTIgJoaa	salut,<br>  le souci c'est que meme en te donnant des dates, tu peux tomber enceinte n'importe quand. On peut tomber enceinte durant ses regles parfois, ou meme en prenant la pilule (meme si c'est rare je te laccorde) et en dehors de l'ovulation bien sur donc ya toujours un risque.<br>  Essai plutot de parler avec ton chéri, de lui dire que pour linstan tu n'es pas prete a avoir d'enfant car pas de stabilité.<br>  De plus le prétexte de ne pas pouvoir le quitter est ridicule car cela n'empeche rien parfois, malheurerusement. On fait pas un BB pour un prétexte mais par amour.<br>  S'il ta dit sa , c'est peut etre parce qu'il a peur, parle avec lui de ses angoisses, pourquoi a t il peur?<br>  Ou mets toi un implan sans qu'il le sache, ou prends ta pilule discretement a des heures ou c'est plus facile pour toi.<br>  Mais le mieux est d'en parler je pense.<br>  bise
EtT1NWy0aa	Definitely let the child do it themselves.  Encourage your child and provide suggestions, but your child can take pride in knowing they did the project on their own even if it doesn't look as good as the parent made ones.|`|IwX3foEmaa	My mom used to help me a little bit. She would give me ideas on what to do and help me get things together for it. Then I would do all the final stuff.<br>  <br>  for example: in fourth grade (13 years ago), my class was supposed to take a big piece of paper with a turkey on it and decorate it any way we wanted. My mom told me all the things i could do to it and I would make the final decisions. We took rice and used food coloring to change its color and then I glued it on the turkey. She helped me color the rice, but I glued it all and chose the colors. <br>  <br>  I loved getting my moms input and it was  nice  for the two of us to spend time on something important for school. I was 1 of 5 kids, so it was rare to get help from my mom like that....so when I did, it was special. <br>  <br>  So you can definitely help in some ways... but let your child make the final decisions and put everything together.|`|bffa71be9e2af7c9f6b16aba7fa5782aaa	don't do it for your child. make your child do it for themselves. the teacher knows that the parents help the other children and will probably be more pleased knowing that your child did it themselves. and it will help them also.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	I am a helper. I sit and encourage them as they do the work. I do NOT touch the project itself. In 20+ years I want to to be able to see what my child did. Not what I did for my child.|`|d91775dc0167078dadf8d8093e2a4445aa	i used to get help from my artistic sister.  it's normal to help them.  school is hard.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Nope, not at all.  <br>  <br>  I frame his paintings and put them on his wall.|`|G2auAv1Saa	I encourage my daughter to learn all she can and always do her best. Me doing it for her would defeat the purpose of teaching her anything.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	HELP is fine, but DOING IT FOR THEM is not. In my book, doing it all for a child is the same as cheating because the child didn't really do it- someone else did.   <br>  Doing it for them also robs your child a chance at learning. Parents all ready have their education. Your child's projects and school work is THEIR chance to learn and to become educated.  Everyone will need help understanding something now and then, but I don't believe in just handing the kids the answer or doing it for them.|`|QveBSjFSaa	Same as kitkat....<br>  last year, when my son's project went to the science fair, I was astounded. Compared to all the others, his was very plain. I asked the teacher about it, and she told me she had picked him because he got the idea of the project all on his own, obviously. She was impressed by the fact that he got it and didn't have to have mom making it picture-perfect.|`|j2mRop0laa	My husband helps with Science and I help with Social Studies.<br>  <br>  By help, I mean suggest websites for research and help my daughter with wording if she's stuck. She writes on a rough draft and loves typing it up herself. With the displays, I help decide which materials would be best and look nicer and I shop for it. She does MOST, like 90% of the projects herself, but we definitely give ideas, hold down stuff she has glued until it dries, help with placement if she asks.<br>  <br>  I mean, in the REAL adult world, if I needed help with a work assignment, I would ask, too. The teacher has stressed that the parents may help and in some cases we are expected to.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I wouldn't do it for her, but i would help her in other ways with out actually touching or doing part of the project myself.
FsFUo4VJaa	Everyone is different I think I was 25 weeks or so It is exciting.|`|2B2fgmw9aa	I actually saw it move at 20 weeks, but felt her move at 16-17 weeks. It's totally awesome! wait til the hiccups start!! Now that's entertaining!|`|O5WberWnaa	hi im 33wks nearly 34 and i only started seeing my baby move around 30wks.its great coz my partner and my other children can see her moving too x|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	i'm 24 weeks today and my little boy is going crazy in there. I havent been able to see the movement yet but I CANNOT wait. I know it will be soon.|`|fHgbL046aa	I am 21 weeks and 4 days and still waiting to feel my baby move. I was 153(a bit chunky) before I found out I was pregnant. I then lost 6 pounds and gained a pound back. <br>  I was a bit underweight when I had my first child. I gained 39 pounds and lost it all after I had my daughter. I felt her move between5 and 6 months pregnant.<br>  Congrats to you and your babe
fELUJmkvaa	I think the cow cake is adorable!  Make the cake yourself, not because the baby will remember, but because it's a very special day.  Of course you will take pictures, and, when he gets older he can see how special his first birthday (and cake) was.  Maybe make his small "smash" cake just a round cow's face.  I say make the cake yourself mom.  Everyone at the party will enjoy it!  Happy celebrating!!!<br>  P.S.  You could also make cupcakes (black and white to stick with the theme) if you don't think the cake will be enough.  P.S.S.  My mother made all three of my kids' b-day cakes for their first 5 birthdays.  It was really special to them.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	do you live in the states? and do you have a Big Y near you? They give out a FREE first birthday cake and all you have to do is bring in your son's birth certificate to show them and the deal is done. I am doing that for the guests and then for Jaocb I am getting him a smaller Smash cake and decorating it like a baseball (his party will be baseball themed).|`|AA11626101	Give the baby a tool set. Worked for me.|`|AA10921760	Speaking from a grandmother's point of view, I like the idea of YOU making the cake. You can be as elaborate or simple as you wish. I especially like the farm idea, but the cake doesn't need to be in a chicken shape ... you can purchase little decorative plastic farm animals etc to set the scene. But, if time is a problem, then go for the purchased cake. Most bakeries will decorate it as you would like.<br>  <br>  Your child will love looking back at the pictures no matter which option you take.<br>  <br>  About "playing in the cake" .. I'm not sure what you mean ... is that the "cute" picture where the child has cake smeared from ear to ear and is grabbing cake for all it is worth. I've never been a fan of that. I think you should put the cake where your child can see and enjoy, ask him to blow out the candles [even if the blowing out never happens], and serve the cake. The kid will get messy enough eating the cake. You can take the embarrassing pictures then.|`|MzjbUX5eaa	I think making a cake if you can is great! I bought mine just to save on time and it worked out great. It's a busy day. Even though he/she won't remember you want to think of the pictures! What cake do you want in the pictures? That should help with your dilema.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	What IS this "the one they played in" nonsense I keep seeing?<br>  <br>  Kids do not play in cake. They aren't allowed to do it any other day, so whyever are you going to confuse the poor child by, just this once, encouraging him to behave in a way that if he does it any other day you'll take the food away! He's one. He doesn't understand different rules for birthdays. <br>  <br>  Make ONE cake and give baby a PIECE of it to EAT. Not to throw around the place. It's not cute and it's not clever. You can have plenty of pictures of his happy little icing-smeared face just from him eating it.|`|H7L66ynJaa	Whatever your age mum's cooking is always the best. Besides you know what has gone into your cake the ingredients plus love.
VwMkiLFPaa	I would pay off my mortgage and the rest of my family member’s mortgages because we’re all struggling. I’d pay off any other debts any of them had and mine too. (Everyone except my SIL – seriously!)<br>  <br>  Then I’d pay for Dylan’s tuition fund. And yes, even my stepdaughter’s as long as her mother can’t touch a PENNY. And if she doesn’t go to college, she doesn’t get the money. <br>  <br>  And I’d take a BEAUTIFUL trip to Italy….then save the rest!<br>  <br>  And believe it or not, I’d go back to work!|`|hKJIDdVqaa	I would thank the dear Lord first.  I would donate a portion to my children's public school and youth sports programs.  I would take care of my extended family-although mine are rather aggravating also-,  I would build a nice big house in the country(with an indoor basketball court for my children lol)   I would certainly invest in real estate (gotta be prepared for retirement just in case) I would set up trusts for my children for college and for future homes.  And a nice family vacation....Oh and I would definitely hire a maid.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	I would pay off all of our debt and buy/build a new house. I would pay off my family's (parents, brothers, sisters, & grandparents) debt and give them enough money to invest and live comfortably. I give to charities or maybe start my own charity organization. I start a trust fund for my son and invest enough that my husband and I could live VERY comfortably on the interest alone.<br>  <br>  Never hurts to dream, right?|`|flqAr30laa	Well after i gain consiousness, id run to my lawyer and make a will.<br>  then...go house shopping|`|AA11210211	I would be screamin for joy!! LOL The very first thing that I would do with the money is pay off debt then I would look for a house and buy it,I would put a substantial amount up for the kiddos college.I would also move my mom and step dad down here and buy them a house too.There are so many things that I would do with the money it's not even funny.I have had this idea for sometime about setting up a drug/alcohol rehab for young woman,I feel passionately about rehabilitating young woman I didn't have any help so I would like to help them.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	I would probably be in total denial for a while. But once it sinks in, I'd do the same and thank the Lord! I would get completely out of debt, pay off my parents home and all their debt, put my sisters through college and finish school myself. I would then buy a home, same as you, nothing too lavish, just what I need. Set up some trust funds for my kids, put money aside for savings...I would also donate some money to certain charities. Honestly, I don't know which charities I would give to, but I would think long and hard about the one's I feel need it the most. Probably something along the lines of orphanages in third world countries, etc. There is just so much I could do!!!|`|hl5WdXnbaa	I would pass out first!<br>  <br>  Trust funds for the kids, pay off debt and we would move back to my native Canada so we could live in the middle of no were on a farm. We would travel and I would love to go to law school .|`|4e67Pdfvaa	pay off my house, pay off my parents house, build a better house, take the kids on a clothes shopping spree, and invest the rest. :)|`|AA12145826	I'd jump my husband because now we can afford to have those 6 kids we originally talked about having....LoL<br>  <br>  - Set up college & trust funds for children<br>  - Give family & friends a one time lump amount (example: $2 million to each of our parents, $500k to each of our siblings and close friends, etc.)<br>  - Give substantial donations to charities we already modestly support<br>  - Go back to college and finish my degree (still not sure what it would be)<br>  - Buy a home closer to where I work (yes, I still would work) & upgrade our cars, pay off debt, and other misc. non-fun things<br>  - Buy the hubby his "dream boat" and finance his dream of professional bass fishing for 2 years (after that he's on his own...win or quit, LoL)<br>  - Buy a vacation home or 2 & plan some really great vacations (Europe, Africa, South America, Hawaii, take the whole extended family to Disney World for a week, take a month long cruise, etc.)<br>  - Put at least 1/3 to 1/2 of the original amount in a series of high yield savings accounts<br>  - Set aside some money for my hubby and I to spend however we want no questions asked (as long as it doesn't go against our marriage vows, is illegal, or is morally/ethically wrong). I would probably pay for my sister to go to law school and pay for her bar exam....then put her on permanent retainer.|`|AA12221392	I guess I would need shock therapy first , then thank god , and then buy the best dang lawyer to fight to get my son help. <br>  I would putmoney up for the kids future and college. we would buy a new home, I would buy my husband a new truck and buy him race tickets for every race for the year, and also racing experience to drive a car. (his dream). <br>  I would buy my oldest daughter that lap top she has been wanting, my son I would buy him a ps3, and my youngest daughter I would be her a wii. <br>  i would pay off my parents new truck and give them money to put in the bank.I would book a cruise for my parents to hawiii(something thye have always wanted to do) I would pay my sister and her husband house off and buy them a car. I would buy my father in law a elcamino, and my mother in law I would just give her money to put up, and take her to a casino or something and let hr go crazy so to speak. we would proably pay off all my husbands sisters and brothers homes, so they all always had a place to live without worry. <br>  I would donate about 25,000 to st. judes cancer childrens hospital, I would donate 25,000 to all sorts of mental health issues. <br>  <br>  I would open a shelter house to help the less fortunate to be able to stay warm and have food . i would open up a small ma and pa store . and my husband would open his own business.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	I jsut asked this question yesterday!<br>  <br>  I would probably scream & cry, jump for joy and then pass out!<br>  <br>  We're going to be renting a gorgeous house that sits on 100 acres of land (it use to be a farm). To buy it, it cost $1.5 million so that would be the first thing I buy. (It's not a mansion, just a 4 bedroom house; it's the land that costs so much).<br>  <br>  Then I would pay off all debt. Buy 2 new cars. Put money into a trust fund for my children. Give some to family then stuff the rest into a vault (with this ecomony, I wouldn't invest it.)<br>  <br>  Thanks for reminding me that I need to buy a Powerball ticket for tonight!|`|QP1ZQqPfaa	I would cry and thank God numerous times.  I would call my mom and dad and well tell them that they can quite.  I would love to help the homeless or a foundation.  I would put more money into my daughter saving accounts, but my daughters thank God have enough and they already have a savings account, so helping less fortunate people would be something God would appreciate.  I would get out of dept and help my parents and in laws too.  I would rent out my house and get a bigger house.  I would donate my husbands car and get him a new one, i already have a new one so no need to be selfish and get another one.  I might invest in buying another house so both of my daughters can have a home each to do as they wish with them when they get older. I wish you luck and i hope one day you win the lotto!!!|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Buy a new house, set up my kids' college funds, put some away for mad money, and donate about $50,000 to the March of Dimes, Saint Judes and The Ronald McDonald House Charity's. (Each) <br>  <br>  My siblings would get so much as well, but on a "You blow it, you're screwed" type of charity, same with my husbands family. <br>  <br>  I also would possibly adopt a baby. I'm getting fixed because we can't afford anymore children, but my husband said if we ever get enough money, I could adopt a child if that's what I wanted.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Ohh what would I do.. It depends how much I had won!<br>  I'd probally be so shocked i wouldn't know what to do at first!<br>  Then i'd come to my senses, pay off any and all bills, buy a house, buy a car that is newer and is a hybrid, Then.. I'd buy the motel that i've worked at for several years and run it on my own (yeah, i'd be able to). I'd also donate money to the historical amusement park that is in my area so that they could open...and hopefully not just for the season.|`|KUxEBQuYaa	id keep it away from my husband! he loves to spend!!!!!!!! <br>  id move us out of this apartment and into a nice house out in the country. id get me a car. id make sure my son has money set aside for the futrue too.<br>  then id thorw a big party! lol. bring all the babies!! party for the babies!<br>  <br>  (my 8 month old just blew raseberries on my arm1!!!!!!!!!lol)|`|bMyq2nOTaa	I would buy a larger house (free and clear!), buy a new car, and help starving and abused kids, and animals.|`|yhrqIjAeaa	The first thing I would do is quit my job!  I love what I do, but would rather stay home with my son.  Then I would set aside money for college for him (and my *hopefully* future child) and for a retirement fund for my husband and I.  I would give money to family, but not too much since most of them are irresponsible.  I would buy a bigger home and go on lots of vacations to places I've never been.  Mostly, that kind of money would give me the time that I want to spend time with my kids and raise them the way that I was raised.<br>  <br>  And it goes without saying that I would donate a substantial amount to my favorite charities.

EtCRnDJMaa	Yes & No!<br>  <br>  I don't really care what's "in", I just pick out the clothes that I like, usually from American Eagle or Gap.

I might find a certain trend that I like it and use it for a season or 2, but I just wear what looks good on me.<br>  <br>  I like tunics and leggings with mini skirts etc. I don't always wear that kinda thing, though, because in my area-- not a lot of the moms dress very trendy at the school (baggy jeans or sweats and over sized sweatshirts) and I get weird looks when I get creative with fashion. LOL<br>  <br>  I do get more creative and trendy if we are going out for an evening or the day, though.<br>  <br>  *My oldest child is trendy with a capital T.

I always wear long flowing skirts, I only own 1 pair of pants.And I love color. My daughters friends call me the gypsy momma! lol   I am sure that show on TLC  "what not to wear" would have fun pulling me apart :)<br>  <br>  It is kind of funny..I now live in new york city, one of the Usa's fashion capitals with all the designer stores everywhere and I still have no clue!|`|bJXqOWCcaa	In middle/ high school. Colored skinny jeans and graphic tees are what every is wearing. Also the florescent sun glasses. Hollister and A&F and going out of style too. Now it's dELiA*s, American Eagle, Forever 21, and all that stuff.|`|z0ro3VkJaa	I've never known what was in, just what I wanted.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, I've never been able to attain what I've wanted, so in the past I've found myself settling for what happened to be in.|`|OTp3JWIqaa	I have noticed that people will pay big bucks for a pair of jeans that look like they are 20 years old....<br>  <br>  if you want worn out jeans why not just go to the goodwill and get them for 5 bucks a pair? You can buy more that way!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i love fashion.  i always have.  since i have become a mom i am a jeans a shirt girl.  i can't do sweatpants or tshirts.  i miss being fashionable actually. you and johnny's mommy have me thinking about me today.  dont spend enough on me|`|3WWHWsHOaa	I never paid attention to what's in.<br>  <br>  Honestly I just do what I do and I enjoy how I look. At 30 Im still pretty darn sexy in a mustard yellow capris that say "sexy bum" on the back and a white fitted t shirt.
ExcaA1Oiaa	I wanted it for my son - it looked like a great idea.  So far he hates it & he's 4 months old.<br>  <br>  Pros:<br>  Teaches kids to sit up<br>  You can put a tray on it for them to play<br>  Comfortable<br>  Easily mobile (bring to family/friend's houses)<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  Many children hate them<br>  Kids try to tip themselves over<br>  Costs a lot for a small window of time when you can use it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|QP46eVi4aa	well first i have no cons only pros<br>  <br>  it is awesome i got 4 of them for my daughter 2 for my house and one at the grandparents and one in the trunk of my car for were else we went <br>  <br>  i used one in the bath tub when she was learing to sit up <br>  <br>  i started using mine at a month i would sit with her a little each day with it kinda help build neck muscles<br>  <br>  but by the time she was right at 4 months she could set up in the floor by her self it was awesome <br>  <br>  but they are worth it also they ahve a tray now to buy to put on the front to put snacks on|`|dgRTkccBaa	My kids were about 3 months old when we started using them for short periods of time.  My kids loved them.  My nephew, however, hated his.  I would get one from a consignment shop or craig's list because for the money it's a huge waste if the baby doesn't like it.  You might even want to borrow one first to see if your baby likes it.|`|B5MDTdtPaa	she was 3 monhs when i first put her in it for v short periods of time but wasnt until 4 months she sat in it well, now i feed her solids in it at 5 months old , i think its really good but i only really use it really for feeding her - its cheaper than high chair so good for when my mother looks after her every so often as i give her that to feed her in - easily transportable to|`|174a0c67c52bf2d640d056db3d05e137aa	well if you child is at all chubby i would say don't go out and get one. my daughter was vary chubby baby and my mom got one for her house and my daughter only could sit in it for about 1 or 2 months or less. but if u have a skinny baby i would say go out and get one. i never really liked it. i thought it looked vary comfortable for the child. good luck.|`|qFmOuXMXaa	About a month but she didn't really like it....now she is almost 6 months old and it sits under my coffee table never used. She just never liked it but I guess I should keep trying it, little babies change what they like all the time.<br>     I know some people that had babies and their kids loved them.....I guess it's like everything else.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	First time I put my daughter in the seat was around 2 1/2 to 3 months but she didn't sit really well in it.  Around 4 months, she really started enjoying it and she sat much better.  Unfortunately, now at 7 months, she has no interest in being in it anymore.  :(|`|BWVrhDExaa	I don't remember my son's age.  We borrowed the Bumbo seat from someone, and he used it for about a week.  Then he started trying to knock himself over while in it, so we had to stop using it.  Don't waste your money.
UCkkrhdhaa	don't feel bad. people are always gonna have different opinions. I don't like Charlotte either.|`|rOSNknjoaa	I may have accepted your apology if it wasn't for the implied sarcastic tone of your capitals - I assume you are the teenager that you come across as?<br>  <br>  Jamie is a boy's name. So is Cameron, Drew, Sean and Hilary. Doesn't stop girls havimg the name though.<br>  <br>  Why do you even care what other people think of a name?|`|3506016d5289004b41bda212dadfdc4caa	I think you are entitled to your opinion, I haven't read your original answer but maybe you could have put it nicer. Anyway haven't you realised by now that no matter what you say, someone will be pissed off about it.|`|TjLHnuh3aa	JS..... should be BS more like.<br>  I don't understand anything u just put. but im sure its ridiculous because everyone knows American people called JS tend be less intelligent than french ones. . . |`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	I think you should get out more. |`|klDiZgKQaa	If you don't want to know opinions about a name...don't f*cking ask!|`|3KSJslMMaa	The reason you got jumped on is how you WORDED your question. It came across as you being rude. You kind of used Yahoo Answers to rant/rave about something, like you are doing now in a small way. <br>  <br>  If you don't want people's opinions, stop asking for them. Asking who all hates the name Charlotte is asking for opinions, and if you make someone mad, they'll let you know...it's the internet. People have no 2nd thoughts or fears of someone showing up at thier house with a gun as much on here. They feel untouchable. <br>  <br>  The word hate also is an aggressive word. Really watch what you say if you don't like seeing people answer that you don't agree with. Think before you act, think before you speak/type. Good luck and quit that! ;-)|`|AA11138680	People only name their daughters Jamie after that Jamie Luner that used to be in Savannah, 'cos they hope their kids will row up fit and with big knock-knocks like her. But not her ginger hair. I think it might have been dyed anyway.<br>  <br>  You write long questions, it was a bit boring to read, but now I feel like I've achieved something by getting to the end - thank you. And of course you can make an apology. I think Charlotte and Jamie are both wonderful names, as are all names everywhere. It's true that here in Britainland Jamie is considered to be a boy's name, although in my experience they are often quite girly boys. Not necessarily botty-burglars, but maybe more "metrosexual".<br>  <br>  And there's quite a long answer for you. But not as long as your question.|`|e00fc1c299d34a3d8c47805b7ceab0a4aa	Maybe they would have been less aggressive if youd been less confrontational. to say you hate something immediately brings out the emotive side of people. You could have said 'Im not fond of..' or 'Ive never really taken to..'<br>  From the way you write I guess youre not very old, so it would be good to realise that the way you say things will elicit the same response from the people you are speaking to. Be nice and they will  be nice back, mostly.|`|hparYLb1aa	Definitely!  Sometimes you just wish people could try to be respectful and say things in a nice way!  i mean you're not saying they aren't entitled to an opinion, but is it so hard to at least make an effort to say it nicely?  That bugs me too.|`|ehtXVKyVaa	If you can have your opinion on Charlotte, then why can't they do the same for your beloved Jamie? It sounds like you have weird double standards.|`|VbvwktNMaa	rude british people?!? now thats insulting!|`|qd5Or7NDaa	yeah they are stupid<br>  an opinion is an opinion<br>  not an insult<br>  and i really hate the name charlotte too!|`|QfYGhtVwaa	I am British and did not see your previous question. Anyway in the hope of informing people that not sooo many British people are rude, let me tell you, I really like -  the name Charlotte and Jamie for a girl, I have cousin called Jamie and many many people here comment and say how much they like her name. There you go, plenty of us have good manners and I suspect the rude commentators were immature or maybe moany people taking a swipe at a stranger to make themselves feel more in control than they probably are. RASP! to them.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	I am certainly *not* conservative and I think Charlotte is a fine name. It is not old-fashioned at all, it is a timeless name that works on all ages.<br>  I don't despise Jamie because it isn't popular in the UK. I despise Jamie because it is a nickname for James, it is trendy and won't age well. I mean, come on, 'Grandma Jamie'? I can't see it. 'Grandma Charlotte' and 'baby Charlotte'? I can see those.|`|0BC2WTyoaa	I actually agree on the name Charlotte.  I know a lot of people do like it but I don't see anything pretty about it. Sorry :(  However I would not post something in the way you have.  I agree that Jamie is a bad name as well.  That is only MY opinion though.|`|IlndnVyBaa	yeah dude, you asked if Jamie Monsterrat was a good name for a baby girl. Get it Monster Rat is what it sounds like. And that is definately not a good name|`|nkM6wmv6aa	i think you're perfectly entitled to your own opinion about any name.<br>  however<br>  i think you need to get out more.|`|db177321e144fc6c8411beb4480c3ae8aa	You were quite aggressive there.  I like Jaime for a girl, or better, James, like the model James King,  It's unusual.
sqvv3e5Eaa	Dyson is good for picking up dog hairs and they have the animal vacuums that are suitable homes with pets. I am not sure if the cheaper brands will do the job well, maybe you should check out your neighbours vacuum to see what kind of vacuum cleaner they have.<br>  <br>  You can also check out <a href="http://www.vacuumcleaner101.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vacuumcleaner101.com/</a> for vacuum cleaner reviews and advice.|`|XOtOMncwaa	I have a Eureka Optima, and it's awesome! I don't have pets, but I know it will pick smashed soggy crackers out of my carpet! I don't know how much it retails for, I got it at a flea market for $20! :) But they do sell it at wal-mart I think... the next vacuum I'm getting will be the dyson, but I have to wait for mine to kick the bucket first, and that things like a tank so I don't look for it to happen soon!|`|FLEXqVoiaa	We have a red Dirt Devil from Target. I'm sorry, I don't remember the model name, but it's fairly large and has a big canister with a hepa filter. It was under $75, and I assumed it wouldn't last long as the others all cost $200-$300. I've had it for 2 years now and it still works great. I do sometimes fantasize about getting a Dyson, but I think I'd feel guilty about spending the money lol.|`|QP46eVi4aa	my favorite is the dyson but i paid over 500.00 for it but i am sure about any vacum cleaner is great at walmart for like 79.00 i saw one that said it is great for dog hair has a hepa filter you take out and wash instead of having to replace and the handle comes loose to use as a hose to vacum curtains and stuff <br>  <br>  <br>  this one is a little different but would do the job <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10057072" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a>|`|d91775dc0167078dadf8d8093e2a4445aa	eureka optima.  it's green.  maybe cost you like 60 bucks.  i have 5 cats and a baby.  it works pretty well.

44ccf078ecbbb80711e26204438034abaa	Yea I always have the worst indigestion.. then I get pregnant and it's four alarm feel like I'm having a heart attack night and day. Constant severe pain! BLAH!<br>  <br>  First they tell you take tums and rolaids. Next they'll tell you to take rantidine or I can't think of what there OTC name is. You are suppose to take one of those before every single meal. I got told take as many as you want. LOL! Aside from that they also give me a prescription drug called Reglan. It digests your food very quickly when taken 30 mins before a meal. Problem is for some, me included, it cause lots of problems... such as depression issues cause it crosses the serotinin receptor on your brain. <br>  <br>  So basically you can take the Reglan and solve your problem but create more problems.<br>  <br>  Best suggestion I have is what you are suppose to do when you have G.E.R.D.<br>  <br>  Eat 6 small meals a day. Don't mix drinking any liquids with your meals do that before or after by at least 30 mins. Don't lay down for 3 hours after eating. Stay away from fried, fatty, spicy, minty, foods as best as you can. Don't wear tight clothing around your waste. bend at the knees not at the waste. At night prob your bed up by the feet by a least 6 inches. <br>  <br>  Those will help to some degree and if they don't do the job you might have to go with the more aggressive treatmen. If you can't tolerate the aggressive treatment you'll pry decide your indigestion heartburn reflux whatever it is... is easier to live with.|`|NDQS5HJyaa	Tums didn't do crap for me. You should look into getting some extra strength rolaids, I bought a huge bottle of that. Try to stay away from spicy foods. In my first pregnancy, anything remotely spicy.. and even sweet tea (my favorite drink!) of all things, caused me to have indigestion. Milk helps too.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	Try Maalox (cherry flavored) it is not very good kind of a chalky taste but it will relieve the pain. It is safe for you and the baby. when I was pregnant with my first son I had indigestion all the time and i was sick as a dog and that's the only thing they could give me to make it better. Tums does not work so I am not sure why they told you to use that. As for food try and eat things that have little grease or spice it will help some to keep the indigestion away or at least make it less uncomfortable.|`|34YAS4a0aa	Drink lots of water and chew gum! That's what helps me, also try to remember what you ate, that could be the main cause, I'm pretty much stuck eating yogurt & chicken noodle soup! for now, I'm gonna give other food a try next week but for the past 2 days and the rest of the week i'm sticking to light food just so I can get some comfort! Good luck.. I'm 8 weeks & 1 day!|`|pCZPtegeaa	Call your doc. He can prescribe something that you can take to help with the indigestion and is also safe for your little one.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck =)|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Tums and Milk of Magnesia are the only things that you can take (that I am aware of) <br>  Call your Dr and ask if there is anything else you can take.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	On the list of ok meds my Dr. gave me to take it says for heartburn to take Maalox, Mylanta, Pepcid or Tums.|`|1m7eGZdeaa	you can take more tums than directed. all tums are is calcium. drinking milk also helps. but if your uncomfortable at 8 weeks you have a long road ahead of you. Im still having the indigestion at 30 weeks but you kinda learn to deal with it. if its bothering you that bad tho talk to your OB|`|0O9S3Sjraa	Try Malox and tangerine sours. Tums and lemons did not works for me.
mrYCeWoMaa	yes it's normal, that is why they tell you not to do a lot of bending and lifting during pregnancy and don't carry children around a lot, stand up straight. and take warm baths for the pain. the back pain is just going to get worse and if your doing a lot of bending and lifting it's just going to make it 10 times worse|`|J7GTIE5raa	yep you need to stay off your feet so much. later in your pregnancy your back pains may continue to get worse. dont do so much lifting and try a sit down position until baby arrives|`|tu7aqUoxaa	instead of bending, try squatting down and don't lift heavy kids, as this may cause a miscarriage|`|pu6YIzaaaa	If you suffer with it on and off anyway then it may not be pregnancy related at this early stage but I think you should speak to your dr anyway just for clarification and also see if there are any risks from your job so that you know what is safe for you to do.|`|5VFljIk1aa	I had horrible back pain in the beginning. Maybe you should talk with your supervisor and just let them know the strain on your back is to much. They should understand! Good Luck!|`|WuVW9uCAaa	yes i have terrible back pain im 6 wks and 2 days|`|P6dNmcgWaa	The baby is probably touching a nerve in your back that causes the backache.|`|Gn4iNKPSaa	yes and i found that my round ligaments were stretching.
w4n3EwuCaa	Ask your doctor to check for a bacterial infection. With a miscarriage you have bleeding and cramping as well. Call your doctor and see what they think. Best of luck to you.
af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	Call the hotline or tell your school and tell them you don't want your name to be put out because you're scared.

Imagine if they actually do do it and you have to live with yourself the rest of your life knowing you could have prevented it do what's right|`|a1uoxczTaa	do you have to give your name or the people's names to the hot line? i am sure if you call and say you aren't sure if they were joking or not and the hot line would understand.|`|3AlFMrA5aa	U wont get in trouble cuz u will remain anonymus but i STONGLY- NO, REALLY SUGGEST THAT U CALL THEM- PLZ!!!!!!!!!.Just think, YOU could save lives. PLZ DO!!!!!!!!!|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	honestly i would go to the principal and tell them exactly who said it and when.|`|4hFT5JcLaa	You will (or should) NEVER get in trouble for being proactive and just trying to help people. If they were just joking about it, they shouldn't have been, and maybe having a cop monitor your school will teach them that it's not okay to joke about violence.<br>  <br>  It is the responsibility of the school to provide an environment where you feel safe, so if you don't feel safe, call the hot-line.|`|JkzYlNv6aa	Take it seriously, and call the hot line. You'll never get in trouble for being proactive. There was a gun threat at my school and now we have to have an officer on campus at all times for the rest of the year. I'd always take something like that seriously, even if they are just kidding or whatever.|`|dVLS1O9iaa	To be on the save side yeah you should. Explain to the people you had heard it from people talking in your class and your not sure if they were serious, and that you just wanted to make sure someone knew if they are.|`|uwZ9AL38aa	call the hot-line!this can be serious !!!!!!you can save a life!or lives!!|`|QJf2XNaTaa	Do it, anonymously.|`|EWnTv4hqaa	dude ANNONYMOUS|`|hq9rM7Eqaa	go to the office right now. immediately.<br>  the last people who "thought they were kidding"  are dead.<br>  go now.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Take it seriously!!!!

Explain that you don't know if they were joking.  Let them look into it.  Can you imagine how you'd feel if they weren't joking and something happened?  Not only that, but if a shooting went down, they'd eventually find out that you posted this question.<br>  You know these guys better than anyone here, it's up to you.
hl5WdXnbaa	Yes<br>  <br>  I am a group for parents who have adopted kids with special needs. It is awesome getting support and extra guidance. My son is doing so much better because of what we learned.<br>  <br>  I believe their should be more classes...and more parents should take them!|`|AA12221392	yes, but they just dont have enough of them. <br>  I think it is good to have other parents to show you how they handle a problem or what things worked for them or what things didn't work so that you can use this information to help with your own child.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	No<br>  <br>  But my daughter is in special needs soccer<br>  The parents talk when the children plays, about behavior and other things we go through that others do not<br>  <br>  I know people that goes to a group that children are AHDH or have Autism.|`|T864ejaiaa	i had to take counseling with my daughter. she had a learning problem and behavior prob. it helped alot. it taught me how to deal with a child with special needs. thank god for them. i wanted to pull my hair out so many times while raising her. she now lives with her hubby and is raising two kids. her daughter has problems also. she's having a hard time. i told her to go to counseling, she will have to find one in nashville who specializes with special needs children.
4RvLKHYsaa	I cut it out altogether for about 2 months when my daughter started freaking out about it. I re-introduced it recently (she's 5 months also) and she's perfectly content for about 10-15 minutes before she starts fussing. I didn't want her to associate being on her tummy with negative feelings, so I felt fine stopping it for a little while. Maybe try stopping for a few days and then re-introducing it? <br>  <br>  Also, a boppy pillow or a mat specifically made for tummy time might help him feel more comfortable, as well as not placing him on his tummy when he's just eaten. |`|XmO3nFSLaa	My son wouldn't do it either until about 6 or 7 months even as a little baby he hated it....just give him time and i bet he will like it...don't force him...my dr said it was ok if baby only did a very small amount of tummy time....also I bought a little mat the comes with a pillow designed for tummy time(toys on it and all) and it worked a bit better....maybe you should try that!! Good luck and don't worry he will like it eventually!!|`|EJrM8gr9aa	its ok if he hates it. he's still supposed to do it. its good for their legs because it straightens them and also for their back and it helps build strong muscles. my son hated it up until recently and he's 8 months almost. he is now just starting to move and he laughs doing it. all babies go at their own pace. give him time and stick it out til then.|`|AA11108482	Have you tried placing a boppy under him. Its not uncommon for babies to hate tummy time. When i worked in daycare, we had to do tummy time will all infants and were more successful when we put a boppy under them with some toys or a mirror infront of them.|`|nBHSCu0Xaa	Try rolling up a blanket or towel and placing it underneath his armpits so that it props him up a bit. My son loved tummy time when we did this. Over time we would make the roll smaller and smaller until he was supporting himself on his arms by his own!|`|H3BIj2Msaa	My son didn't like tummy time for awhile. Finally I realized that when he is ready, he will like it. But I wanted him to be ready! So anyway I used the boppy pillow idea and it went better. So you may want to try that
Cah6nfV5aa	I had my daughter had my 6 week appointment told him I wanted a IUD then made a appointment for a week later and got it put in.|`|lRr46ABUaa	My doctor told me that she likes to wait 9 weeks after you give birth, but it really is up to your OBGYN.|`|j083iujcaa	my doc told me at my 6 week check up they could put it in|`|seU9VwIJaa	According to my doctor, they can put it in at 6 weeks if you aren't breast feeding.

FC4VXL4saa	Some people are destined to stay in the same place with the same friends, and some people are not.<br>  You may be one of the people who are not - or you may be someone who EVENTUALLY will be destined to stay in the same place, but at the moment you need to keep moving.<br>  I know it's hard on you - you've got a really difficult situation there, but there isn't anything much you can do.<br>  Yes, you can stay in touch - make sure you're always phoning, texting, emailing and such, because it's an important thing, and you know it'll make you happier to stay in touch with your best friend.<br>  So this is what you need to do.<br>  <br>  But remember, you're moving too in July, so it would be hard for you no matter what - but you just need to keep going.<br>  <br>  I know it's upsetting you, but try your hardest to be strong.<br>  At school, your best friend leaving you could actually help you with your social skills. These next couple of months, I want you to think about setting yourself a challenge. and this challenge should be: "I need to get my mind set on becoming more confident in making new friends."<br>  <br>  You can do this! Go for it and see where it leads you. <br>  Talk to new people, mix with new people, show your true colours to new people and they will most probably want to be your friend! Take up a couple of new hobbies or join a club or two that interest you, and you'll meet new people through that as well.<br>  It's going to be fine! Just keep this challenge in mind, and for the next couple of months, you'll be progressing, improving and learning, at the same time as having something to occupy you!<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope it all goes well x|`|AA10302604	i understand what you mean my best friend moved away and its just really hard to deal with she moved into another state i hardly ever get to see her she comes down only two times a year try talking to some other people at your school maybe even join a club|`|UVC8Oj0Iaa	That's a shame. I couldn't cope with life if my best friend moved away. But I suppose that you could still keep in touch like you said, through methods such as making phone calls, writing letters or IMing. You wont necessarily fade away, because it's up to you to keep in touch. If you can, even arrange to meet up in the future. But remember, you still have your other friends at the moment and I'm sure that they will do whatever it takes to make you happy. It really doesn't matter how far away you'll be. Friends are friends no matter what. Try being more confindent in yourself. Talk to someone you wouldn't normally tak to. You might even find that you have a lot in common. I wish you the best of luck for the future and don't forget to be strong.|`|y96eYj0Faa	My best friend moved last September. It was so hard and it hurt!!! But we still talk ALL the time! Although we might not be able to see each other in person, we both bought webcams! So we can chat together online! She also has an AIM account so we can talk all the time. AND her mom let her get a facebook so she can keep in touch with all her friends! Like your friend, my friend said she is happy she is moving (she really didn't like our school) and that she wanted a fresh start.But she said she will really REALLY miss me and our friends. Maybe over the summer you two can make plans to meet up midway between your countries! Like, Say you live in Europe and she lives in Asia, maybe both of you can fly half way and meet up in America! Then stay a few nights in a hotel and just hang out!! That's what I'm doing with my friend! Over the summer I am flying out to California to see her!! It's a 6 hour flight but it's worth it ;p<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|vHFaHzdeaa	Hey babe, I know how you feel, my best friend is moving pretty soon two. What makes me feel better is a good cry, then taking my self before God. There I find comfort. If you don't want to do that, then take comfort in a thought, some where some one is praying for you; and I will for seven days. Good luck babe;)|`|i0Exuxi2aa	I faced the same situation quite a while ago but it still seems so recent. I completely understand what you mean. Keeping in touch is just never enough is it... If you feel like crying, don't hold it in. Cry on Friday night (if you don't have plans for the night or the next day). You'll look crappy the next morning but who cares. I cried for a week! Maybe more. When she's gone, don't have any pictures or anything that would remind you of her at school. Have it at home, but not at school, cause that might bring you to tears. If you are moving soon, get a new good friend for now. Not the type that you would miss when you're gone. I know it sounds terrible, but it's the only way you won't get attached. Lastly, keep your chin up! Be eager to move with the hopes of finding someone else as ggod as your best friend! <br>  I hope it helps. Best of luck! When you feel like crying, don't hold it in. Bad for the heart.   : ). If you need someone to talk to, please don't hesitate to e-mail me.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I moved to another country too when I was 16. I moved from the US to Scotland. Now that I'm 28 I'm still in touch with friends from before I moved to Scotland. Well only 2. I think what will make you feel better will be staying in touch (MySpace is great for this) and making new friends.|`|8AFnU5m8aa	just remeber that with the internet and phone its not hard to keep in touch if the person is important to you.<br>  <br>  I moved far from home and still keep in close contact with a few back home. We talk on the phone all the time, send gifts and letters in the mail, etc etc. <br>  Even if I cant talk to them for days creeping in on weeks we're still tight enough where we know its not the end of our friendship.<br>  <br>  both of you just have to make an effort. Youll find out just out strong of a relationship you really had after this experience.
0tnrYI8uaa	Bei meinem Sohn war es genauso wie du schreibst. Der Hunger schien unsagbar und er hat viel gespuckt,dafür aber schon 8 Stunden oder mehr nachts am Stück geschlafen.<br>  Der Arzt gab mir den Rat einen Teesauger zu benutzen und bei der H?lfte Pause zu machen(B?uerchen),was ich machte,aber er trank trotzdem genauso viel wie vorher und spuckte.Kann nur sagen das meiner heute(4 J.)zuviel Gewicht hat und immer noch einen guten Appetit hat(ich muss echt aufpassen das es nicht zu schlimm wird).Woran das liegt kann keiner sagen,denn er ist kerngesund(gott sei Dank),sein Bruder wieder rum ist gertenschlank,seine grosse Schwester auch,aber mit meiner Kleinen(12 M.)hatte/habe ich dasselbe Problem. <br>  Du kannst ihn schlie?lich nicht vor Hunger schreien lassen!|`|92crVjlKaa	Lass ihn zwischendurch ?fter aufsto?en damit die Luft aus dem Bauch geht. Dann w?re natürlich auch zu überlegen die Milchsorte zu wechseln. Am besten ist es aber, du ber?tst dich mit einem Kinderarzt.<br>  <br>  Alles Gute und lass den Kleinen net schreien !|`|MWvSaDuDaa	Gebe dem kleinen Kerl eine Flasche mit der Menge die Alters entsprechend ist und wenn er dann immer noch mehr will gebe Ihm so lange Tee bis er zu n?chsten Flasche wieder dran ist.Dauert zwar zwei drei Tage aber er bekommt dann seinen eigene Zeit wie er die Flasche braucht.<br>  Das wird schon.|`|T1xtV3OZaa	Hallo,<br>  <br>  fütterst du vielleicht PRE-Nahrung? Dann versuch es mal mit der 1. Nahrung oder wechsel die Firma. <br>  Das mit dem kleineren Loch im Sauger ist auch eine gute Idee, dass S?ttigungsgefühl setzt ja auch bei uns erst nach einer gewissen Zeit ein.<br>  Sollte er auch sonst spucken, rate ich dir zu eine AR-Nahrung, damit habe ich bei meiner Tochter das Problem in Griff bekommen.<br>  <br>  Und nun an alle, die hier meinen jemanden, der nicht stillt beschimpfen zu müssen:<br>   Warum bitte verurteilt ihr diese Frauen? Warum macht ihr ihnen ein schlechtes Gewissen? Und dann noch das gestillt werden als Menschenrecht dazustellen... Wo bitte sind wir hier?<br>  Es gibt Frauen, die gar nicht oder nur teilweise stillen k?nnen.<br>  Ich selbst habe meine Tochter nur teilweise stillen k?nnen und mit 3 Monaten hat SIE SELBST lieber nur noch die "ekligen" Plastiksauger nehmen wollen und jeden Stillversuch meinerseits abgelehnt! Und wenn nun wer kommt von wegen, ich h?tte was falsch gemacht, weil ich nur teilweise stillen konnte - ich hatte mit 18 eine Brustop bei der viel von den Milchdrüsen zerst?rt wurde und man mir vorhergesagt hat, dass ich überhaupt nie stillen k?nnte!|`|d83cb5a613c4d338355faee01de7e5aeaa	Hallo erstmal herzlichen Glück Wunsch .Wie ich das kenne mein wurmi ist jetzt 13 Wochen alt und ich hatte fast das gleich Problem meine Kinder?rztin hat zu mir gesagt ich darf mein Baby nicht über füttern(Babys dürfen maximal 1Liter am Tag zu sich nehmen) was bekommt dein Kind (Nahrung) meiner wurde von PRE Aptamil nicht satt der ist alle zwei Stunden gekommen ich habe ihn dann um gestellt auf die 1ser Nahrung   das hat ihm mit 11 Wochen nicht gelangt habe wieder umgestellt auf die zweier Nahrung so wie meine Kinder?rztin es mir empfohlen hat und jetzt ist es gut er kommt nur alle 4 -5 Stunden für ne Flasche .Das beste du redest mit deine Hebamme oder mit deinem Kinderarzt mach keine Experimente|`|f9b08e15212b4297a7f7c070afc8496aaa	Hallo Ivonne,<br>  erst einmal meinen herzlichen Glückwunsch!<br>  Ich hatte auch so einen Fresssack, meine Tochter, heute 13.<br>  Sie hat in den ersten 14 Tagen oft das dreifache, auch aus der Flasche, getrunken. Kurz danach kam alles wieder raus.<br>  Ich war l?nger im Krankenhaus als du und brauchte st?ndig neue Nachthemden. Aber nach zwei Wochen hatte es sich eingespielt, sie blieb zwar ein Speikind, aber sie a? nicht mehr so viel. Leider stellte sich kurz danach die Neurodermitis ein, es hei?t ja, dass das mit dem Magendarmtrakt zusammenh?ngt. Das haben wir aber auch in den Griff gekriegt durch Reflexzonenmassage, welche auch wieder auf den Magendarmtrakt geht.<br>  Es spielt sich also ein, mach dir keine Sorgen, alles andere danach klappt auch.<br>  Gruss junile|`|nrCbGGOuaa	Liebe Amedia,<br>  ich hab dir noch gesagt: Stillen, nicht Fl?schchen!! Jetzt habe ich meine Frau (du wei?t: Stillberaterin und IBCLC) hinzugezogen. Sie l?sst dir ausrichten: du sollst relaktieren (=wieder auf Muttermilch umstellen), aber da brauchst du Hilfe vor Ort, weil n?mlich das Kleine an die mühelose Nahrungsaufnahme gew?hnt ist und sich nicht mit kr?ftezehrendem Saugen an der Brust abmühen will. Es ist jetzt verw?hnt und wird sich nicht leicht wieder umstellen lassen. Zugleich ist das der Grund für deine eigentliche Frage: Das Kind geht an die Nahrungsaufnahme ran, als w?re es an der Brust, es verh?lt sich also instinktiv ganz richtig. Blo? weil der Sauger sofort viel Milch abgibt, hat das arme Wurm sofort den ganzen Magen voll - und spuckt.<br>  Es ist ja auch der Zeitfaktor, der eine Rolle spielt. Das Kind will für sein Wohlbefinden nicht schnellstm?glich abgefüllt werden, sondern m?glichst lange und gemütlich den Hautkontakt mit der Mutter haben.|`|vV1G6AwFaa	du m?chtest hier also nicht an Deine Mutterpflichten erinnert werden, nun gut, aber Dein Kind weiss es anscheinend besser. Es wird sich sp?ter sicher bitterlich beklagen, dass ihm das Menschenrecht auf Muttermilch verweigert wurde, aber damit musst DU leben. Vielleicht ist das Loch im Sauger zu gro?? Das Kind muss sich genauso anstrengen als trinke es an der Brust, sonst wird das Saugbedürfnis nicht befriedigt. Das Kind ist n?mlich in der oralen Phase und das Saugen an der Mutterbrust ist ihm ein Grundbedürfnis( dass Du mit einem ekligen Plastiksauger befriedigen willst).<br>  @gepard: genau, übers Stillen sollte man nicht diskutieren müssen, ist das Normale, alles andere ist doch abartig. Der Kleine erwartet mit Recht Muttermilch, das hat die Natur so eingerichtet.Aber schreien lassen würde ich das Kind auf keinen Fall. Das ist Folter!!!<br>  @Tinka: natürlich ist es ein Menschenrecht gestillt zu werden. Natürlich gibt es einige wenige Frauen, die das nicht k?nnen, aber das sind wirklich nur einige wenige. Die anderen alle haben sich von der werbung einseifen lassen, dass Milchpulver (hergestellt aus Kuhmilch, die ja eigentlich für eine kleine Kuh gedacht ist, also nur ein schlechter Ersatz im Notfall sein kann) besser ist für ihr Kind ist, ist ja auch alles so sch?n bunt in der heilen Werbewelt.Wo sind wir hier? Na immer noch auf der guten alten Mutter Erde, wo Kinder gestillt werden wollen!!!!Wenn man bei jedem kleinen Stillproblem gleich zum Fl?schchen greift, ist es doch kein Wunder , dass die Milch versiegt.<br>  Liebe Amedia: h?re auf den mann der Stillberaterin, nimm Dir die Zeit Dein Kind zu stillen und vergiss dafür die Klingelstreiche, das bringt eh nix.<br>  @Floh: wu?te noch gar nicht, dass auch ein Mann stillen kann...|`|4d9165f11910890754cb93808610df9caa	ich hatte das auch mit meinem sohn ich bin dann einfach hingegangen und habe ihn etwas trinken lassen und nach ner stunde wieder ist zwar stre?ig aber hat geholfen.<br>  sp?ter als ich auf den stre? keinen bock mehr hatte bin ich einfach hingegangen und hab nen l?ffel nahrung mehr in die flasche getan und es hal′t super geklappt.<br>  viel glück|`|9QeMUvgdaa	Nun erst mal meinen herzlichen Glückwunsch !    Ich würde da doch erst mal mit dem Ki-Arzt sprechen.  Jedes Kind ist doch anders. Auch mein Tochter hatte stets hunger. Ich hatte ihr zwischendurch Tee zu trinken gegeben. Vielleicht wird der Arzt Dir aber raten eine andere Milchnahrung zu nehmen.|`|EqhW04Puaa	muss sagen zu den ganzen Still vernarrten hier Leute habt ihr eigentlich nen sockenschuss was soll der Stuss den ihr hier ab last ich Stille und habe das gleiche Problem das hat weniger was mit der Nahrungsaufnahme als viel mehr mit dem s?ttigungsgefühl zu tun und nur weil Mann stillt hei?t es bestimmt nicht das das nicht auch vorkommen kann<br>  <br>  so jetzt zu deinem Problem da du nicht Stillst und wen dein Kind gesund ist kannst du es relativ einfach abstellen benutze einen Sauger mit einem kleineren Loch dann muss er sich erstens mehr anstrengen was müde macht und es dauert auch l?nger bis das b?uchlein voll ist<br>  <br>  bei mir liegt es daran das sobald mein Sohn anf?ngt zu weinen die Milch von allein l?uft somit Brauch er sich nicht anstrengen muss nur den Mund auf machen abgestellt habe ich es so<br>  erst die eine Brust dann Windel wechseln da die zweite Brust<br>  <br>  P.s. Ich behaupte hier nicht das dein Kind krank ist aber wenn es sich nicht gibt las es vom KA überprüfen weil es in sehr seltenen fehlen ein genetischer defekt sein kann <br>  wo das Kind kein S?ttigungs-Gefühl kennt|`|IMKWZqOQaa	@gepard: <br>  Du würdest ein vier Tage altes Kind schreien lassen? Da fehlen mir die Worte, das ist Kindesmisshandlung in Reinform. überlege vorher, bevor Du Dich mit derartigem Nonsens blamierst.<br>  __________________________________<br>  <br>  @ Ivonne<br>  Zun?chst einmal meinen herzlichsten Glückwunsch zu Deinem kleinen Wunder! <br>  Ich habe keine eigene Kuhmilch-Füttererfahrung mit Babys, aber würde auch sagen, dass dein Kind vermutlich schon zuviel Milch getrunken hat, bevor sein Saugbedürfnis erfüllt ist. Kinder trinken ja nicht nach der Devise "Magen voll, Nahrungsaufnahme beendet", sondern haben ein angeborenes, ausgepr?gtes Bedürfnis danach, zu saugen - aber das wei?t du ja sicher.<br>  <br>  Ich k?nnte mir denken, dass sich Euere Trinkschwierigkeiten vielleicht tats?chlich über ein kleineres Loch im Flachensauger l?sen lassen. So kann der Kleine ausgiebig nuckeln und bekommt nicht zu schnell zuviel Milch ins B?uchlein. <br>  <br>  Ich wünsche Dir eine liebevolle Mutterschaft!|`|nY0xv6ywaa	Meine Tochter ist 4 Wochen alt und ich stille haupts?chlich! Da sie aber nicht so zunimmt wie sie sollte wurde mir von meiner Hebamme geraten, Anfangsmilch zuzufüttern und das klappt wunderbar. Ich stille erst und nachher gibt es nach Bedarf noch ein Fl?schen!<br>  Was ich eigentlich sagen wollte ist: Du hast doch einen Anspruch auf Hausbesuche einer Hebamme. Ich würde das mit der besprechen oder halt mit dem Kinderarzt!<br>  <br>  @Alle, die über Flaschennahrung l?stern: Natürlich ist Muttermilch das Beste für das Kind. Aber es ist nicht jedermann′s Sache zu stillen! Ich finde, dass sollte man nun wirklich jedem selber überlassen, ob man stillt oder nicht! Keiner hat das Recht einem anderen Vorschriften zu machen!|`|oN2Ut2t5aa	Ich hatte das Problem auch.<br>  Zwar habe ich gestillt, hatte aber zuwenig Milch. Deshalb mussten wir zufüttern und nie wusste ich, wie viel unsere Kleine wirklich trinkt. Sie wollte immer mehr und hat dann wieder gespuckt.<br>  Wie ist das denn bei Dir? Spuckt Dein Baby gleich beim Trinken oder erst etwas sp?ter? Wenn es direkt beim Trinken oder unmittelbar danach spuckt, war es zu viel Nahrung, wenn es etwas sp?ter spuckt, kann es auch ein Spuckkind sein, was nicht mit zuviel an Nahrung zusammenh?ngt. <br>  Im Krankenhaus hatte ich eine Bettnachbarin, deren Baby von Anfang an 100 ml getrunken hat. Ich denke nicht, das man sich an Packungsangaben halten sollte, Du musst einfach probieren.<br>  Bei uns hat es sich mit der Zeit eingependelt. Jetzt bekommt sie mit 7 Wochen auch nur noch die Flasche und es klappt prima, sie trinkt einfach bis sie satt ist und das stimmt meist mit der Angabe überein.<br>  Neugeborene haben auch oft ein gro?es Saugbedüfnis, ohne das Hunger dahinter steht, vielleicht ist ja wirklich der Schnuller die L?sung?<br>  Wenn sich das Problem nicht gibt, würde ich auch empfehlen, den Kinderarzt zu fragen.<br>  Alles Gute und Glückwunsch zum Zwerg :-)|`|oPGCagWxaa	Herzlichen Glückwunsch zu deinem Baby!!!<br>  <br>  Vielleicht solltest du dein Baby langsam füttern. Also immer mal wieder eine kleine Pause beim Trinken.<br>  Wenn ein Baby schnell trinkt und zu früh fertig ist, ist das Hungergefühl noch nicht da, deswegen m?chte er immer noch mehr.|`|18f79fd6f8483c4a5b0eeeb771de8482aa	Ich würde das Problem mal mit dem Kinderarzt besprechen, der kennt sich damit am besten aus.<br>  <br>  Herzlichen Glückwunsch zum Baby.<br>  <br>  Anne|`|c4daf98f23d678bbc5cf3083fe1b95a2aa	Na dann erst einmal herzlichen Glückwunsch !<br>  <br>  Versuche es doch mit einer anderen Milch. Vielleicht funktioniert das Satt sein ja besser.|`|718c4443467ab3004ed35995eb243b70aa	also<br>  1. GLüCKWUNSCH ;-)))<br>  2. mach dir keine sorgen, wenn er das v?lle-gefühl brauch, dann lass ihn ruhig ein bisschen<br>  3. sch?n das du dir nix vorwerfen l?sst nur weil du nicht stillst! ( eine sichere mama ist eine gute mama;-)) - egal ob brust oder flasche!<br>  4. einige haben hier viel. recht mit der gr??e des loches???<br>  5. wenn du nix gegen schnuller hast, versuch es damit und leg ihn ruhig an deine nachte haut beim füttern, vielleicht fehlt ihm gar nicht der "dicke bauch" sondern wartet auf das wohlige gefühl das mama ausstrahlt?<br>  6. ganz wichtig !!! auch wenn du flasche gibst, zieh dich sch?n in eine ruhige ecke zurück zum füttern...wie beim stillen eben ;-)<br>  7. lass dich nicht verrückt machen es gibt einfach so genannte spuckkinder ;-)<br>  8. beim n?chsten termin beim doc aber mal ruhig ansprechen, das "problem"<br>  9. alles, alles liebe und gute für euch beide ( drei, vier,fünf..?!)|`|PcPKuhSsaa	Probiere es mit einem kleineren Loch im Sauger<br>  oder<br>  gibt ihm noch den Schnuller nach dem Essen :-)|`|bfd1d4451c92fc3c31a3a8c223bf253eaa	würde auch die lochgr??e im sauger verkleinern und es statt mit pre mit 1 probieren . würde ihn nach dem essen einen schnulli geben und wenn alles nicht hilft zum kinderarzt . k?nnte ja auch sein das er die milch nicht verarbeiten kann und daher immer hungrig ist.<br>  wünsche euch alles gute|`|c029fd4c00e1ad99eab9ae3b3f6b3dc0aa	IErstmal Glückwunsch zu deinem kleinen Nimmersatt!  Ich würde mir da keine Sorgen machen,denke dass die Natur das so geregelt hat.Warscheinlich hat er jetzt diesen bedarf, aendert sich vielleicht in ein paar Tagen,das muss sich alles erst einpendeln. Bevor du ihn leiden l?sst- gib ihm seine Portion,lieber so als andersrum!<br>  @Johanna S, finde deine Ansage total daneben, sie hat doch geschrieben das solche Tipps unerwünscht sind und du schreibst geradezu so als würde sie ihr Kind verwarlosen lassen- übertreib mal nicht, jeder sollte das Für sich entscheiden,das stillen macht einen nicht zur besseren Mutter!
Qo3zns1Caa	GO!!!  I have an 18-month-old, and I would KILL for the opportunity to go on a cruise with my husband!!!! <br>  <br>  Seriously, though, it will be difficult to leave your little one behind.  My daughter is 18 months and she's done maybe 2 overnight without us, and it was difficult.  She was fine.  <br>  <br>  I would be a little concerned that your daughter might not be familiar with your MIL if they live out of the country, and your MIL wouldn't be familiar with your daughter's habits.  I would make sure that they get to spend a couple weeks with you and the baby before you go so their bond can get re-established.  Also, 2 weeks is a long time.  I'd start with a 4-day or 1-week cruise.  But please GO!!!|`|mDYsr62maa	Learning to be with parents is a [art of normal child development.  As long as you trust the people watching your child, the child will adapt.  Go have a good vacation and do not worry.  It is a normal thing and something every child needs to experience before the age of two.  You have to cut the cord folks.|`|SWbiblvPaa	I would NEVER leave my child for more than a weekend with my family and he sees my family everyday even sleeps over there house. My question is WHy cant you take him or wait till he gets bigger its totally up to you but think ..... can you leave him behind and have a good time while your not with him .. I COULD  NEVER!!|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I would never EVER leave my 14 month old with anyone else for ten days. Much less people he will only meet two weeks before hand. I think it's cruel to your child and would not recommend it. You have your whole lives to take cruises. He is a child one time. Put him first.|`|ibeYAlwpaa	I thinks it would be better to find someone your little one is more comfortable around, like someone he's been around enough to know. I do think it's a little much to expect a toddler to be content around people he's not familiar with for that long. With that being said, toddlers are fairly resilient  and i really think that they he will be ok... you however will probably freak out..lol.
ZusC87WBaa	I have 5 boys, so I'm going to have to go with 5.  I will say we are definitely busy and loud!  There are benefits to having more kids and there are benefits to having fewer.  I love each and every one of them dearly and believe 100% that they were all meant to be in this world.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	I already have 2 girls, and in about 4-5 years we will try for #3, a boy. I really hope when I get pregnant next, it will be twin boys. I would love to have twins, it runs in my family, and it possibly runs in my fiance's family (he can't remember), so it's possible. I want at least one more, but I would be happy with 4.|`|jrVlzffeaa	When I was pregnant we wanted 4 kids, but after going through labor and birth (and I had a natural drug free labor and birth) we only want one more. We don't mind what we have next, a little boy would be nice for Ethan to have a little brother but a little girl might be nice to have one of each sex, but we honestly don't mind, as long as baby's healthy then we don't mind. I used to want twins and then single babies but I think I would be extremely nervous and anxious if I was carrying twins Xx|`|POmUFlGAaa	I have 1 child a 9 yr old girl. I always wanted 2 girls but that wasn't meant to be so I'm happy with the 1 child I have and try to give her all I can to make her life good.   I did consider adoption but my husband didn't want any more children.|`|XEcoJnt4aa	I wish you all the children you want, when the time is right. For myself, I wanted none and have none. this works for me. Have a nice day. i am past the age of wanting to chase a lil' one around even if I wanted one.|`|AA10953561	I already have a six-year-old stepdaughter and am expecting my first biological child in April. I always said I wanted either 3 or 5 children. I'm still sticking to that. Right now I lean more towards three but that's because I'm 32 weeks pregnant and even though I love feeling her move I'm getting pretty restless to get this baby out in the world. So just one more after this one. So it'd by my step-daughter, my baby girl, and hopefully a baby boy next time. Would I want multiples, yes and no. The novelty of multiples is exciting, but the reality is twice as much work and money at the same time.<br>  <br>  I'm a pretty strict mother, not as in I never let my step-daughter have any fun, but she doesn't get away with back talking, she doesn't watch more than an hour of TV a day, she doesn't get snacks before bed. If she's caught in a lie she has to stand in the corner with her hands at her side for five minutes (she rarely lies). I never have and never plan to spank my step-daughter, but I do believe in spanking, I'm just not comfortable spanking her. I also believe spanking should be reserved for extreme situations where the child could hurt themselves or others. <br>  <br>  I want my daughters to be proud of who they are and how they look. I tell my step-daughter every day that she's beautiful. I want all of my children to be confident in who they are, what they're capable of, and as learners. I work with my step-daughter on her spelling, her letters and numbers all the time. This way she won't feel left behind in school.<br>  <br>  I hope this answers your question! Good luck with your future family!|`|y7OPY5laaa	Lol,yeah i have to wait a looong time until i have kids. I'm only 15. So i have a long time to think about it,but if i met the love of my life...i wouldn't mind having his babies right now! :) I would want a girl and a boy.I have always jumped and smiled at the thought of getting the great chance to raise two beautiful babies,and have a great family to love and support. :) I  would also love to have a big family,but it would take SO much work.I would try to raise them they should be raised. With a lot of love and care. ;) Best of luck! ? ?|`|ZXhX78wsaa	I want a big family also.<br>  my boyfriend wants 4 children lol<br>  so IDK.  : D<br>  The number of children you have should be discussed with your significant other! I would like to have as many children as my husband will let us lol<br>  I feel exactly the way you do with family-- and how important they are to us. Its amazing! && I wouldnt mind having mulitiples-- if it happens it happens . You just got me ALLLL excited!!! lol! Have a good one hon!|`|M6uIbKXRaa	i would like a minimum of two and a max of four kids two girls two boys hopefully i want boys to carry on my last name and i want girls cause ive never had a sister and id want that for my sons|`|tnDJgYYZaa	I want 3. 2 girls and a boy because I love girls but i would want to know what a boy would be like.|`|FsFUo4VJaa	I am going to have two I was a middle child of 3 kids and I will never put my kids threw that it was not fun.|`|APh0sGTTaa	2 at least. So they have someone to play with. One thats mine and my husbands/boyfriends and one that i adopt when theyre a teenager I'm thinking. Teenagers in the system get screwed over so much cause no one cares. No one want the teen with baggage, everybody wants the adorable little babies. I've also thought about becoming somewhat like a foster home, maybe have a few teens kicking around the house. Try to make life easier for a few kids. I definately want a boy though. I'll keep going until I get a boy. But if it comes out a girl, I'll definately love her all the same.|`|ChYa4LzXaa	I want 2 children, 1 boy, 1 girl.  I know it's hard to plan it this way, I want my boy to be older than my girl.<br>  I want 2 so I can have a nice balance, one of each, and not too many kids so I can still pay more than enough attention to each child, because I don't want my kids to have to be jealous because mommy and daddy are only paying attention to the oldest and youngest, and as always, the middle is ignored.<br>  The reason I want my boy to be older than my girl is because I have an older brother, and he was always there if someone was messing with me,protecting me.  That's how it's always been and it's how it is everytime I see someone with a big brother.|`|uLLQovSyaa	My original plan was I wanted a boy and a girl and that was it.The boy 1st and then the girl.We had a boy and when he was around 5-6months old I got pregnant again.We didn't plan it that way and believe me I wasn't thrilled to be pregnant again so soon.He was around 13 months when his little brother was born.It was really hard and still is at times.Sometimes I think I may have a slight view of what it would have been like to have twins and it wouldn't be to fun.Before we had kids I had worked at 2 different day cares (at 2 different times)so I was like "oh this is all there is to it" and figured I could handle it.I was so wrong! It's a lot of work and a 24/7 job that lasts 365days a year on top of what you have to do besides parenting.Don't get me wrong it's not all bad it's just waaaay different than what you'll think it's like and what you'll actually experience.We made it a bit harder having 2 so close together.Now that they're in school I can't say I don't think about I'd like to do it again.Hopefully a girl if I got pregnant again and then that'd probably be it and I'd get my tubes tied.I also have considered adoption because I have more sympathy/love for kids now that I have my own.Plus this world is so awful sometimes it's almost not fair to the children for them to be born into it.I probably sounded negative about kids so here's some of my fav things about being a parent: feeling your baby move inside you is SO COOL!,Hearing a baby sigh, or laugh,seeing them sleep,taking care of them when they need you the most(sick or hurt),hearing them talk and it's not plain but you understand what they're saying,funny looks they give and stuff they say and ask,hearing them say "moma I love you".Just to name a few:)|`|Xu4x19y6aa	I have one, but I'd like to have 2 more.  Seems like as you get older, you rely on your siblings for support, guidance, etc...... Especially after your parents are gone.  I don't want my child to be an "only child" forever.  I want her to have neices, nephews, etc.......  <br>  <br>  I'll raise my future kids as I do my current child - not spoiled, being kind to others, helping with chores and time to just play and imagine (not on video games!).|`|H5wyRZTNaa	2-3 kids. at least one boy and one girl so that i can experience both. but i don't want a huge family because i want to be able to give each of my kids special attention and i want to have some time alone with my husband as well :)|`|JqA5x1qiaa	I am 15 and I would love twin girls and a boy, two or three - not one because I am an only child and hate it but no more than three because you can't give them the individual attention they need (:|`|OyEEyIpdaa	2, children develop differently depending on how many siblings there are and where in line they are.  My girlfriend and I both think 2, for no reason in particular, but we agree so its all good.

CdJtH0xdaa	I'm glad you care so much about your brother. I commend you for that. Honestly, she'll never tell him, because she keeps saying she will, but never does. That shows that she's not responsible enough to tell him, and she's immature enough to act as though it isn't happening. Considering that she's not going to tell, you have to tell your brother yourself. Find him when he's calm, sit him down, and, speaking face-to-face, you have to tell him what you saw his girlfriend do. Tell him honestly, and don't sugar coat it. I can't stress enough how honesty can help build relationships between siblings. Anyway, just tell him, and then be there for him if he cries or gets angry at her. He most likely will, so just be there for him. But, considering you care so much about your brother, I think you have done that without me suggesting it. Best of luck to you and your brother. =)|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	I would have called my brother when it happened and stranded her at the mall. 12 year olds kiss on top of cars!? WOW! hun tell your brother, he might be mad at you later for not telling him when you saw it! good luck and tell him he's 12 he has a long way ahead of him girls come and go and obviously this one isn't worth his time|`|T6OorlmZaa	You gave her 3 days and she didn't fess up. Tell him. If he finds out that you knew and didn't say anything it's going to hurt him far worse than hearing that his gf is a skank.|`|EWnTv4hqaa	12?!!??!? WELL SINCe there young i guess u shoud tell him and explain wat  a jerk she is|`|QJf2XNaTaa	Tell your brother! Think, would you want him to tell you if he caught your bf doing the same???|`|ZHhXQ0ebaa	might as well tell im because if he found out u knew he would be mad|`|i0Exuxi2aa	Oh man, you're in a tough situation. Well the bad news is, there is no way of telling someone this without hurting their feelings, but you've got to be honest. Find a quiet and private place for you guys to talk, and avoid a conversation in front of the TV (sports escpecially) or anywhere there are other people. Go straight to the point and no beating around the bush! When you speak, speak with tones of regret in your voice (regret, not hesitant), and don't go too fast. You have to convince him. If he says he doesn't believe you, say to him: "listen, you're my brother, and I love you. I would not lie to you about this. Please... believe me". I wish you the best of luck!|`|wzXJOSIeaa	YOU need to tell him because it's apparent she NEVER will. Make sure that he dumps her on top of that too!|`|fdnbXfvfaa	You told a 12 year old you were meant to be responsible for, you would meet them in the car?

NoUkTQCgaa	Could you be a little more specific? Like where where you born? Was your adoption through a private attorney or an agency? <br>  I think many adoptions fall into the "grey area" as far as legality goes. Many agencies/brokers/attorneys skirt the law, ie, refusing to inform the father, coercive tactics, even going so far to using heavy sedation during and after childbirth to get a mother to sign relinquishment papers. Sad, but true...and it STILL exists today.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	If you are hispanic .....I don't blame you for questioning the legality of your adoption.<br>  <br>  Children are kidnapped and sold all the time.<br>  Facilitators bring the babies/toddlers over the border and conveniently leave them at the footstep of paid individuals who "abandon?" them on the doorstep of specific agencies.  Its often overlooked by the gov't how these babies have "specific" Paps waiting for their arrival who have paid 20g for them.<br>  <br>  The sickest part is how some of these children/babies are prostituted out on the way to the States.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	Are you questioning whether the adoption actually happened?  In my state, an adoptee can request information about where the adoption took place.  There is information about it on the state's human services web site.  The state cannot release the adoption decree, but they will tell an adoptee which county has the paperwork.  You might start by contacting human services in Texas.  <br>  <br>  In my case, I have my adoption decree, and the adoption was conducted in the wrong county.  It took place in the county of my birth.  The county of my adoptive parents' residence had jurisdiction.  In that sense, it wasn't legal.  I seriously doubt if it could be voided for that reason, however.|`|mEzhsu9Eaa	amy an adoptee activist is awesome for texas, i sent this link to her...she'll come :)|`|CGAiWPk6aa	their all illegal|`|xKSr1ld8aa	What country are you in before I answer, thanks|`|CmWAzy2Jaa	Need more information as to state, county, etc, but to get started, do you know the agency that was involved? Start with them, I take it you are above the age 18? You could also check your county birth records if you know where you were born to get the names of your parents. Good luck.
FsFUo4VJaa	Yes that is almost exactly the same as my story. <br>  <br>  I had 3 misscarriages also one at 6 weeks one at 11 weeks and one at 9 weeks.<br>  <br>  when I got pregnant again I called my mom and I was so sad I told her that I could not do another misccaraige again I think I was going to go mental. My sone is now 9 months old and he is perfect. <br>  <br>  They ran every test in the book on me and my hubby and they found nothing wrong with either of us it was spendy test too so now we call my son our little expensive angel. <br>  <br>  Good luck it happened for me so it could happen for you.|`|AA12113249	i have had PCOS since i was 15.<br>  i didn't have any trouble getting pregnant. staying pregnant late term was another issue all together but it had nothing to do with the PCOS..i have half of a uterus as well.. : )<br>  <br>  anyway, it is common for women like us to have trouble getting pregnant.<br>  it is worth looking into , it could be something else.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|rAD0mL7Saa	It sounds like you need to change doctors and get a more correct prescription to balance your hormones. Are you going to the gym and working out hard at least 3 times a week? I've got pcos and I was told that the level of a hormone that causes/increases risk of miscarriage was a bit high then I joined a gym, got pregnant pretty much straight away. The first one never got a heartbeat and so I miscarried naturally then 3 months after it ended I started going to the gym again and got pregnant after a couple of weeks (I couldn't get out of the membership) and carried 2 to term in 2 years. And I can tell you I definitely had not been seeing any doctor when I fell pregnant. The hormones made me so sick I stopped ttc ages and ages before anything happened|`|4ygxh6vNaa	I had 3 unexplained miscarriages before my son was born and one after my son was born. My mom has a theory that helped me out a lot when i was going through it, sometimes its your body telling you its not the right time, and sometimes it might be your body telling you there is something wrong with the baby. It never completely fixes the loss feeling you have but it helps a bit. At least it did for me. <br>  <br>  Sorry for your loss and I will pray for your family
b71BxLUZaa	It is virtually impossible to tell or to be able to predict these kinds of things.<br>  <br>  My little girls was born at 29 weeks and a few of the things she did were delayed. She didn't walk until 15 months and didn't crawl until 8, but she hit most milestones right on time. <br>  <br>  Our doctor told us that since she was about 2 months early, we should expect her to hit milestones about two months late. This did prove to be somewhat true, but she did hit some milestones both earlier and later than she was expected. <br>  <br>  So, you can't go by this either. My doctor also said that preemies have a schedule of their own. You shouldn't look at what they "should be" doing at certain ages, because they all will develop at different rates. So, don't worry about her if she seems delayed; it is perfectly normal and she will hit milestones whenever she is ready. <br>  <br>  Here is a great link you may want to take a look at:<br>  <a href="http://baby.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Preemie_Calendar" rel="nofollow">http://baby.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Preemie_...</a>|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	Probably not. I mean probably while she is a baby but by time she is 2 or 3 she will most likely be caught up. My nephew was born at 27 weeks and he didn't walk until later than most babies and also talked a little older, but he is 3 now and he is perfectly normal and you wouldn't ever know he was preemie. He does still have a couple issues will his breathing and getting sick more easily, but overall he is good.|`|VaLCUkilaa	It is very hard to say. I had twin girl at 25 weeks and was told that they would be severely retarded or handicapped. I lost one baby girl 25 days after birth due to underdevelopment of her lungs and she caught pnuemonia in the hospital and passed away that night. Her twin is now 13 years old and she did have some learning disabilities when she was younger, but she is now just like all the other tweens.  I never gave up or put any limitations on her. The brain and the body are miraculous things. Take heed to the information and advice that the doctors give you, but don't settle.|`|AA10529334	Generally speaking you count the childs milestones from the date they "should" have been born. So once the child is at that date then expect the milestones from there. If she was due in August then expect her to roll over about December or January irregardless of her actual birth date.<br>  <br>  This is only true for the first year or two - then preemies catch up with the other kids.|`|J9Tbun7naa	Premie's often reach milestone closer to their corrected age rather then there actual age. (so closer to the age they would be if they born on time) and sometimes a bit later....however, in the long term most premie's "catch up" to their peers|`|EeGgovyCaa	Alot of preemies may have a slow start in life, but they can learn very quickly and catch up to babies that were born at full term without medical issues. <br>  <br>  She's four months and smiling? she's right on track|`|EJrM8gr9aa	It is a possibility. My son was born at almost 33 weeks and he takes his time on some things and excels in others. His doctor told me that since he was born 2 months early, he can technically be behind 2 months on things and it be perfectly normal. If you guys are really concerned with her development, then take the issues to her pediatrician to get more information and perhaps peace of mind. you will probably always be obsessed  with her mental development and weight. i am with my son. i wish you guys the best :]

tlSMpVbqaa	I don't think there is any right age to have a child.  I know some fantastic mums who have been really young (16-17) and they have been amazing and there are also the parents who are older who are rubbish parents.<br>  <br>  If you are in a stable relationship, its something you both want and  are happy with and you can see yourself growing old together then i would say go for it.  <br>  <br>  You have to rememerb that having a child puts a huge strain on your relationship so you need to be completely solid and able to compromise before you do.<br>  |`|3xxqKuOpaa	Too young: 18 or younger.<br>  <br>  I'm sure that once you are older than 18 years old then it's your decision whether or not you want a child.

It really doesn't depend on age, it depends on how able you are to completely commit your life to the care of another human being. I am 22 and my husband is 21 and we just had our first baby 5 weeks ago. I can say without a doubt we are not too young. He is a lot of work, but also a complete joy and I feel like being parents is what we were both meant to do with our lives.

I had my son at 24 and I still feel young sometimes. People will tell you "wait until you finish school" I did wait until I graduatedcollege, but sometimes it is still crazy to think I am a parent. Word of advice though... I'd wait until you are married and/or living together for awhile. My hubby and I got pregnant while engaged and then got married and it is REALLY hard to spend time together. We love taking our son everywhere we really do... but every once in awhile we'd like to get away.

4cc66a756d33e365e8b6cb39cd46f4fcaa	Pregnancy tests detect the presence of HCG in the urine or blood.   HCG is a hormone produced by the developing placental tissue, beginning almost immediately after implantation.<br>  Implantation occurs around 14 days after conception.  You can't get a positive test (urine or blood) before implantation.<br>  A blood test shows positive about 12 hours before a urine test.  It's really not any more accurate, and since you have to wait for the results, you don't get to find out any sooner.<br>  <br>  If you conceived on 6/12, you could have had a positive test on the 29th or 30th.  If you conceived on the 26th, you would not have a positive test until July 10th or 11th.<br>  <br>  But if you had your period, then you are not pregnant.  It wasn't implantation bleeding because it would have been too soon for that.<br>  You could repeat the test on July 11th to be sure, but I think it is very unlikely that you are pregnant.|`|yU0dp5HDaa	the fact that you had a period after your intercourse says that you aren't pregnant. I think you are stressing yourself out and not eating right which is really throwing your stomach off. Look at some other signs of pregnancy and judge from that whether you should test again. I don't think you are pregnant though. But wait about another week for a pee test or you can go tomorrow for a blood test but I think you should just wait it out.|`|27f16a1a2275258802b78014bc189e59aa	it's possible to get one light period after becoming pregnant, but you can't be sure on a pregnancy test until your next period, wait it out if you don't have another period in the next 2-4 weeks, buy another test.|`|IuZmCbMMaa	a blood test would tell you at any point.

Having a baby at that age will change a life that hasn't even started. <br>  And financially ok shouldn't be "i got a job at Mcdonald's" but knowing which diploma(s) will get you a good job in the future, how you are planning to support the baby, and how you are planning to support yourself.

Sleepless nights, lonely days, etc...  Please consider the chances the child will also have in this world to be sucessful.  Can you provide money for activities, clothes, special lessons?

People call Social Services for stupid reasons too and it's really bad because once they get the call they have to investigate.

awRNr2VMaa	well a pacifier you can take away thumbs you cannot. my cousins son and daugher (7 year old daughter and 6 year old son) still suck their fingers! pacifier you can take away. my son is 6 months and i already got him off the paci|`|1S7uXsInaa	I prefer the thumb. . .<br>  I never have to worry about it falling on the floor and getting dirty/full of gunk, it does not cost anything and it's always there.  My personal opinion is that it is just as hard to wean the pacifier as the thumb.  There is more to weaning then just taking it away. . .they will find something else to put in their mouths when you take the pacifier away!!<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW. . .thumb sucking as a baby does not cause teeth problems.  If is becomes long term and habitual then there can, and I repeat CAN, be a problem.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  To say that your child is sucking their thumb because they want your breast, I feel, is ridiculous.  My son sucks his thumb and was breastfed.  If my breast was in his mouth as often as he used to suck his thumb I would never get a break.  Kids put things in their mouths whether is is fingers, a pacifier, a toy or what ever else!|`|EJrM8gr9aa	a pacifier is way better because it helps form the roof of their mouth. i recommend one that is orthodontic approved. it should say in the packaging. if a child sucks on their thumb too long, the roof of their mouth slowly wears away. my aunt used to suck her suck her thumb until she was like eight and the roof of her mouth is so high and she has apnea. |`|EeGgovyCaa	Pacifier. Let's see if I can explain this...When you are sucking your thumb your hand is pushing on your upper jaw and teeth which in long term effects is causing an overbite or buckteeth. <br>  <br>  It will save you tons of dental work for your kids teeth in the long run if you stick to the pacifier. Or just break the thumb sucking habit by age 2.|`|tOWqXCdtaa	Pacifier - it's easier to ween and it doesn't deform the child's mouth the way habitual thumb-sucking would. If a child is always sucking their thumb, it can effect how their teeth grow out and may cause them to need braces when they are older.|`|bFyPdIa5aa	Pacifier my son had one and he was easy to ween.

I am trying to break him of it and get him to use a pacifier, but it is not going well. Pacifiers are supposed to be better for your teeth.  You can take them away.  They have also found recently that they reduce the risk of SIDS.  If you have a choice, try for the pacifier.|`|AA11210211	Pacifier I think because you can take it away when you feel you need to,whereas a thumb is kind of hard to take away.My nephew always sucked his thumb well he is now 7 and still sucks it.|`|pXSKSS3daa	In my opinion, a pacifier.

Neither is normal.  Babies are meant to have their parents meet their needs, not an object, and not themselves.  The need to suck is meant to be met at the breast, if mom is not available or worn out than dad's (or another caregiver's) pinkie gives the skin to skin contact and closeness that a baby needs.   <br>  <br>  In the car I guess they have a use, or if you absolutely have to put a baby in a care (daycare, babysitting) situation where there aren't enough caregivers to meet all the babies needs then they may be useful.<br>  <br>  If it comes down to giving up on breastfeeding or using a pacifier/thumb sucking, or if it comes down to mom going to loose it without a thumb/pacifier then thumb is preferable.  Thumbs do not breed bacteria, or yeast/thrush.  Thumb sucking does not increase the risks of ear infections as much as pacifiers.  Its harder to abuse a thumb, you don't see parents jamming a baby's thumb back in their mouth every time they take it out, or every time baby makes a noise.  And baby can't play using both hands, or crawl and suck their thumb.  Because a pacifier doesn't block the view of a child's mouth people also smile at babies sucking their thumb, but they don't smile as often at a baby sucking a pacifier.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detthumb.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detthumb.h...</a><br>  Re the thumb-sucking issue -- it is certainly true that ultrasound and photography in the womb shows fetuses sucking their thumbs, but then breasts/nipples aren't available in the womb, but the suckling instinct is clearly present from an early age. Once the baby is born, however, the suckling instinct is supposed to be directed toward the breast, to get the child nutrition and immunities, and the sucking itself lowers the baby's heart rate and blood pressure. While it can be convenient for the parents to have the baby suck on their thumb or fingers or pacifier (like in the car on trips, or when mother is trying to cook dinner) it nevertheless is clear from both cross-cultural and cross-species field studies that, given complete contact with mother and free access to the breast on demand, human children (and young of our close relatives, the great apes) do not suck on their thumbs or fingers. I never saw a child in Mali sucking its thumb or fingers, in almost three years of watching/observing/studying mother-child interactions. Likewise, thumb sucking is reported to be completely absent from cultures such as the Navajo, in highland Papua New Guinea, Ecuador, the Peruvian Andes, Mexico, Nepal, India, Tanzania, Botswana, and South Africa. <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  Any time you force the child to rely on their own resources prematurely, you must expect deleterious consequences. When the child's needs are met through person-to-person interaction with its mother, you establish the primacy of social contact, and the interdependence of human beings, rather than encouraging/forcing the child to meet its needs by itself.<br>  <br>  This may be a crude analogy, but consider this: If you have two adults, married to each other, who have all the children they want and don't want to get pregnant, but still have strong sex drives, would you consider it better if they each went into a separate room and masturbated? This would certainly allow them to "self comfort" and would make them independent and autonomous, so that one wouldn't have to wait until the other was ready or "in the mood." Would you really consider this an improvement? <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/10/t104600.asp#T104601" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/10/t10460...</a><br>  . If your own nipples are wearing out, or at least the mom they are attached to is, use your finger (or, better yet, get dad or someone else to give you a break). The skin-to-skin element is still there, and your index finger (or dad's little finger) can be placed more properly in baby's mouth to stimulate sucking at the breast. Many of our babies have been soothed by the touch of my well-scrubbed pinkie. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&action=detail&ref=856" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&a...</a><br>   How old is too old?<br>  <br>  According to the American Dental Association, thumb sucking does not cause permanent problems with the teeth or jaw line unless it is continued beyond 4 to 5 years of age. As it turns out, somewhere between 85% and 99% of children have finished thumb sucking spontaneously before this period.<br>  <br>  Which children keep sucking their thumbs?<br>  <br>  Many parents are concerned that thumb sucking at a late age is a sign of emotional immaturity or lack of self-confidence. When investigators have looked at late thumb suckers for common traits, they found only one thing in common that distinguished them from other children -- a prolonged history of a strong battle with thumb sucking at an earlier age. It is striking that many well-meaning parents have actually encouraged thumb sucking by trying to forcibly take the thumb out of their children's mouths. |`|HclKftzAaa	pacifier. cause their thumbs get gross and can get infected. at least it's easy to wash a pacifier, and to take it away etc.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	You can always take/throw away a pacifier but you can't cut off the thumb.<br>  <br>  <br>  My little cousin is going to be 8 tomorrow and he still sucks his thumb!!

So, I would only have 5 children if I wanted that many children AND if I could handle the care and responsibility of that many children without being overstressed.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck!<br>  Peace,<br>  Jenn|`|HclKftzAaa	We are going to have as many children as we can afford. If he's earning enough, and he wants 5, then yes. Yes I would.<br>  <br>  If I didn't want that many kids (I'll see when the time comes, lol), then no, i more than likely would not pop out another one just for him. If i was humming and ahing, then i would probably cave, because i know i would still love the baby.|`|gHR4vlcDaa	personally no I will never have 5 children, my daughter is now 14weeks and and son is almost 8yrs I dont care to physically ever have another, but he wants one more,lol I think a saroget mom will be in order <br>  <br>  But if you are ok with physically and finically with having 5kids its up to you my dear|`|07268fcf840f1cc22dc121266b70f8a9aa	No, I'd be the one birthing them and carrying them for 9 months not him

VpmceUS9aa	About 2 weeks before my due date and it felt like a baby in a sling right between your two legs. It was not painful but I remember frequently visiting the restroom almost every 10-15 minutes...lol|`|62ed2c415d781a32b672aaa388d79f43aa	my best mate just had her first baby about a week ago baby girl. and the baby engaged about 2 weeks pryor to her due date.|`|GCPbKg9Eaa	I was 30 weeks, he dropped really early. My belly looked flatter at the top, it felt so much easier to breathe!, and i had to pee so much more often. I also felt a heavy pressure in my pelvis when i would walk and stand up!<br>  At 33 weeks he dropped even further and now i have shooting pains in my vagina. the doctor said this is his head on my cervix, thinning it (effacement)<br>  This doesnt mean he is coming any sooner for me though, so dont worry if the baby didnt drop yet.<br>  it ususally happend 2-4 before delivery though!|`|5fbWzMv2aa	i'm 41 weeks pregnant today and it happened to me 6 weeks ago (35 weeks). it was a painful day; meaning, my lower abdomen was being stretched and i could feel his head bearing down and "scratching" my cervix. i yowled out in pain several times that day. when i went back to work two days later, everyone kept commenting on how low baby was and that he dropped. he did drop because i could place my palm under my breasts and still not feel the top of him. so i was all excited thinking no more than 2-4 weeks!  NOT!|`|HrbFfWXKaa	For me it happened just about 36 weeks, it didn't happen all of a sudden like I thought it would. I woke up one morning and my belly looked a little different and it just felt like I could breath a little better. People noticed I had dropped more than I did. I ended up getting induced at 40 weeks 6 days, so personally don't believe it has anything to do with when you are going to have the babe. Just FYI I lost my mucus plug 2 weeks before I had her.|`|YegaWxxMaa	good question, I'm wondering about the same thing<br>  35 weeks baby hasn't dropped yet, but is head down....<br>  from prenatal classes i heard it feels as like you have more room to breath, like a relief"|`|TfVgDSpmaa	I just had my first 7 weeks ago!! He never "dropped" like I had heard he would.. I also never lost my mucus plug either... and I waited for that too!! lol!<br>  I went in to labor on my own, and had him on the due date!!
df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	first off i wouldn't go surfing through yellow pages for something like that.  get a recommendation from a doctor or therapist.  truly if a therapist/psychiatrist thinks the teen needs to be hospitalized then it's a good idea.  otherwise try outpatient counseling like the other answer suggested.  hospital are for extreme cases, and if your teens case isn't extreme it'll be worse for the teen being admitted there.  he/she will see all kinds of things that could make his/her situation worse.  try baby steps first, and if you're beyond that then get a recommendation from a doctor.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|Fm7z09Kwaa	Try the Metropolitan Saint Louis Psychiatric Center, in Saint Louis MO|`|x0PKm4qLaa	I live in MO. There ar a few here that I know of... But I would just get on yellow pages and search or ask your doctor and they can recommend one.<br>  The one here, my sister is a nurse there, it called Center Pointe in St. Charles Mo.<br>  But just from experience-and what my sister has told me-the hospital is for extreme situations-you may want to try out patient counseling first. Good Luck!

xbmxVmxzaa	L'acido folico, conosciuto anche come vitamina B9, riveste un ruolo essenziale nella prevenzione delle patologie malformative fetali, soprattutto dei Difetti del Tubo Neurale (DTN). Il suo impiego nel periodo periconcezionale è da tempo codificato in linee guida di pratica clinica applicabili quotidianamente sia dallo Specialista in Ginecologia e Ostetricia sia dal Medico di Medicina Generale. Diventa quindi importante conoscere il perchè, i tempi e i dosaggi dell’acido folico, per un suo corretto impiego in stati fisiologici, in situazioni patologiche e in relazione a diverse abitudini di vita.<br>  Se non sei un medico...<br>  ...ma una donna, ricordati che assumere acido folico prima del concepimento e nei primi mesi della gravidanza aiuta a prevenire gravi malformazioni nei neonati (es. i difetti del tubo neurale). Inoltre, l'acido folico è rimborsato dal Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, così come disposto dall'Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco. Ti invito pertanto ad approfondire questo argomento con il tuo medico di fiducia.<br>  <br>  <br>  CIAO|`|868325ad1ee864309de89a3f1058a1c9aa	La settimana non la ricordo ma quasi verso la fine della gravidanza|`|YhwlSb4Aaa	fino al giorno del parto|`|bT5m7Tpsaa	ciao io l'ho preso fino al 3 mese come mi ha detto la ginecologa!|`|5XI23Tjdaa	Se allatterai al seno è consigliabile continuarlo a prendere x tutta la durata dell'allattamento|`|8NcnxBE5aa	normalmente si prende fino al terzo mese di gravidanza cmq sarà il tuo ginecologo a stabilire i termini e a dirti quando sospenderlo|`|BOVWLCaFaa	io ho preso il multicentrum materna per tutta la gravidanza( dal giorno del test) fino alla fine dell allattamento...nei primi tre mesi ho aggiunto anke la folina.|`|GNTYneHbaa	So che si prende fino al 2/3 mese dopo la gravidanza perche fa benissimo anche alle ossa tue.|`|Mk1poMpHaa	ciao fino alla fine della gravidanza!|`|ZVH8uzPcaa	ciao L'acido folico lo puoi prendere fino alla fine della gravidanza non fa male, io personalmente l'ho preso fino al 7 mese|`|jcQwYiiTaa	fino alla fine della gravidanza xkè fa bene ed evita le carenze di ferro|`|k3gJEMxyaa	si prende fino al ultimo giorno perche aiuta a formare anche ii pulmoni dell bimbo|`|bNMw5NC0aa	io l'ho preso tutta la gravidanza e anche dopo il parto.|`|eg6mClvbaa	io lo prendo ancora adesso e ho partorito 8 anni fa....

Some bleeding is normal during pregnancy, this could be implantation bleeding,as long as there aint no cramps. I had bleeding too early on and the doctor told me as long as i ain't in pain or filling a pad in one hour then I'll be fine, But just be safe and go to the hospital they'll do a pregnancy test and blood work. Good Luck!|`|6d8da438bae03fbd57c6b9d8b3b83ff5aa	Two tests seems highly unlikely to be defective.  You seem to have the common symptoms of pregnancy, but the bleeding is an alert.  Does your doctor know about your being pregnant?  I would suggest you go to the doctor as soon as possible to get your physical done, and make sure that everything's okay.  I hate to worry you, but it may seem like you've had a miscarriage.  Check with the dr. to be sure though.  Good luck.|`|d7i5HwZQaa	I think that you could be.  When you get pregnant, some people get implantation bleeding, which happens around the same time as your period, except lighter (that is when it implants itself in your uterus). That is also one reason a lot of women get confused, because they just assume that it's their regular period. I don't think that two tests in a row would show a clear positive result if they were defective. Oh yea...and I don't think its a miscarriage...I had one before and you would DEFINITELY feel pain!|`|wJ6qf7JUaa	You could possible, be having a miscarriage, You should go see your doctor to be sure.

RsXaP4jgaa	yes, that is because during pregnancy your body itself moves to collect more water than it would at other times, and changes in your blood chemistry help this. Also, the growth of your uterus puts pressure on veins in your pelvis which means that the return of blood to your heart will be slowed slightly. This slowing will in turn create slight pressure in your veins and cause some fluid to leak into the surrounding tissues of your legs and feet and causing swelling. <br>  <br>  <br>  also how long it we last...<br>  Swollen legs and feet will likely continue throughout the pregnancy once they have started, but after the birth they should go away fairly quickly. As the pressure on your veins decreases your blood flow will become more normal and excess fluid will no longer be pushed into your tissues. Also, as your blood chemistry returns to normal there will be less telling your body to collect water. That leaves it to you to simply excrete the extra fluid that your body has collected, which means that in the first few days after birth you may be urinating and/or sweating more than normal as your body frees itself from this fluid.|`|6I9GjHzXaa	Some women dfo have swelling of the feet during pregnancy, so it can be a normal pregnancy symptom for some. However, if you are experiencing a lot of swelling in your feet (or ANY in your hands and/or face) you should talk to your doc ASAP, because this could be a symptom of pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy condition which causes elevated blood pressure, swelling and can become serious if not seen to. Best of luck to you and congratulations on the baby!|`|Am058UiOaa	well, some women do develop swelling on their feet so yes it is normal.  if you do have that then i would definitly mention this to your doctor because this could be a sign for preeclamsia.  i went through the same thing while i was pregnant with my son so i know what you're going through and it's definitly not fun to have swollen feet.  just evlevate your feet as much as possible and limit your intake on salt if you want to reduce the swelling.|`|f427dee13913d31041474d8f9c21d34aaa	Hey girl, congrats.  Having some swelling is normal...but this is a little early for that.  By the end of my pregnancies (previous two) my ankles are like tree trunks.  But I'm 21 weeks with my 3rd preg, and no ankle swelling yet.<br>  One thing my midwife told me is to STAY hydrated, especially during the hot summer days.  Drink water to keep from retaining water.  Also, cut out the meats containing nitrates and preservatives out of the diet (hot dogs, bologna, packaged deli meats, etc).|`|a12ab3a1bf2d92640005610964029538aa	yep it's normal. omg my poor feet and legs swelled to the point that i thought they were going to pop. my daughter who is now 11 but was 5 at the time had to help me get my shoes tied because it hurt to bend my legs.|`|N5Vi9pygaa	Its normal, but if yu want to yur feet from swelling then wear high heels i dont know exactly why but thats what you do because thatss what my mother and my grandmother did and it works so i hope i helped|`|PHkzuiRhaa	normal? Yes it's a build up of fluid in your body as now you have twice as much blood circulating & twice as much water retention. If at all possible put your feet up & rest.|`|P1mwut1waa	Feet swelling for me is normal. With my 1st pregnancy my feet went up 2 sizes.

YIMmjBn3aa	Hon, let me tell you something, I had a child young and it is not a piece of cake. Yes it is wonderful and the most amazing experience BUT going to school, working, then coming home taking care of her getting up in the middle of the night then getting up early in the morning to go to school is tough. There is no on/off switch for a child. They cry when you dnt want them too or when you dnt need them too. I have gotten up with my daughter at 2 in the morning and she ddnt go back to sleep until 4 and I had to get right back up at 5:30. That was me going to bed at 11  because I had to work. Got up went to school, left school and went straight to work. Yea the state helps out but they dnt pay for diapers, clothes, toys, car seats, etc. I know how you are feeling, and its great that you want and love children but having one now is not what you want to do. No more hanging with friends, going out, nothing. It is worth it to me but I have to bust my *** everyday and every night I am tired. I wouldn't trade my daughter for the world dnt get me wrong but its not all fun all the time. Good Luck.|`|jNO3tu7paa	I  know how you feel, I want a baby but I am much younger then you are. But, I am taking babysitting classes, so I can feel like a mother, but only for a temporary amount of time. I keep thinking about it, but I know if I have or adopt a baby, It will have the worse life, I won't give it as much attention as it needs, because of school, and social life. So babysit. And hey, you're 17, gt a job at a day care center. So you can babysit and get paid for doing what you love !|`|RAeoxRbcaa	It's normal to feel like you want a baby.<br>  It's also normal to feel lonely at your age. Before  you decide<br>  to make a baby you may want to grow into the person <br>  your son or daughter can be proud of and rely on.<br>  I'm pretty  sure you are able to take care of a baby now,<br>  but you are in it for a lifetime and you have a lot of <br>  growing up to do, to be the best Mom to any possible<br>  children. You had a lot of good advice to work in a daycare situation for right know. to create a family is a huge job.|`|MlZyHyA8aa	Try babysitting, it's caring, loving and supporting a child. if only for the moment.|`|FdoRXILYaa	theres nothing wrong with thinking about what it will be like, just keep your head in the right place and make sure you make the right decisions.  sounds like you will be a good mom when the time is right, just remember that you want the timing to be right as well...you don't want to have to depend on other people to take care of you and your baby, that's why (like you said) it's not a good idea to have a baby until you are finacially able to afford it and care for a child.  i wanted a baby really bad around your age too and actually i got married at 18 and had my first child at 19...now i have three!  i love em so much and soon enough your time will come too!!  good luck~|`|dvKnDS6Daa	I can understand that. Just think about it, it is a desire, a dream, a longing, and a destiny for you. Think about other things as well, like those who want to become a Doctor or Astronaut, they have this dream, yet patiently wait for it as they learn all that it takes to do it, and do it well.<br>  Try offering babysitting services for awhile. It could earn you money and experience, and fulfill, at least for now, that longing for your future! Good luck!<br>  Oh and I have six kids that you are more then welcome to watch for awhile. LOL <br>  Enjoy your youth sweetheart, it sure doesn't last long. BTW you do seem to have a good head on your shoulders, you will make the RIGHT decisions, just be patient and do it right.|`|OinVyDEMaa	It's normal to feel this way. I've felt like this before. I'm also seventeen. The thing is, I keep my mind and my life busy with what's going on right now. I got school to go to and I have a career in my future. I would want my career before I have a family. Take life as taking a step up. You need to achieve your set goals before you make a possible commitment to being a parent. Take care.<br>  <br>  Violet|`|1DAWOXrWaa	There's nothing wrong with wanting to be a mom. But I'm glad you know enough to wait till your married. I am 24 and very much want a baby but my husband and I know it will happen when it supposed to. So I started getting even more into my Hobie which is mma( miked martial arts). So find yourself something you love to keep your mind off of it. Ask the lord to take this desire out of your heart until your married and its time. I know you lonely. SO tell your parents that. Because a baby isn't to make us feel loved and less lonely, their more needy then we are, lol. Ill be praying for you.|`|ji3MEeWkaa	You're so young!!!  Once you are a mom you are always a mom and can never give it back.  Get involved in school, college, get a part time job, spend time with friends etc. and I am sure your feelings will lessen.  Focus on being young and being able to do what you want when you want and not have to think about supporting a child.  Good luck!|`|WMqGb2Jeaa	Start being a 17 year old and do the normal things in life. Think about who you 'have a crush on' and all that 17 year old stuff.<br>  <br>  if your that obsessed with babies get some freaking therapy!|`|WhlQYXksaa	Heehee.

Every young girl dreams of the day she gets a child. You could for next year if your school offers it go take home economics.<br>  You get one of these kids and you have to treat them like a real one. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/polaroidolator/2096360947/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/polaroidola...</a><br>  Or become a volunteer worker for the Big Brother and Big Sister Programs.<br>  <a href="http://www.bbbs.org/site/c.diJKKYPLJvH/b.1539751/k.BDB6/Home.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbbs.org/site/c.diJKKYPLJvH/b...</a><br>  Become a babysitter....|`|wMZRXZFLaa	You could volunteer your time at a boys/girls club or other entity dealing with children, maybe even the local hospital.  Maybe you could do like the first poster said and babysit for someone.  You'll still be around a baby, but you'll be able to give it back (no offense meant to mothers!).  I want children as well, but I know itll happen when the time is right.<br>  <br>  If you do not want to do this, then spend time with friends or get a part-time job to keep your mind off of babies.<br>  <br>  You have your head on straight so far just keep it that way.  Babies change your life in so many ways, but they are truly a blessing.  You'll be a good mom when you do have children of your own, just enjoy being young now while y ou can.  Time goes by fast.
k8pFvtMLaa	that is exactly like my brother. he's 19 too, doesn't go to school, doesn't have a job, doesn't do anything around the house, sleeps all day, stays out all night, drinks and smoke. my parents don't know what to do either. they've threatened to kick him out. they said he's either got to get a job and pay rent, move out, or go back to school. he's not motivated to do anything either. he claims he wants to graduate high school but he doesn't want to go to school. he spends his days playing video games and hanging out with his friends. who knows what he does down there. i can tell it's really stressing my parents out cuz they don't know what to do.|`|AA10287830	He is an adult and it's time you let him suffer the consequences for his choices.  If you enable him, you are robbing him of the life lessons he needs to grow and mature.  Let him make his mistakes but don't enable him.|`|wZAeBisbaa	He may be depressed.  Consider trying to get him to a doctor or psychologist.<br>  <br>  He may need some help getting started with his job search.  It can feel overwhelming to have to create a resume, search the postings, write cover letters, fill out and submit applications, make phone calls, and prepare for interviews.  If you've never done it before, it's really a huge task.  <br>  <br>  If you have skills to help him with this, consider spending a little time doing that.  Start with helping him narrow down the kinds of jobs he would consider or would be qualified for.  From there, work on a resume.  Then applications and cover letters. Once he has done a few applications, he will get the hang of it and it won't seem so hard to do it on his own.<br>  <br>  If you don't have the skills or the time, refer him to a local job center or government agency.   Many state employment agencies offer these services for free.  There may be a place like that nearby.<br>  <br>  Often, the hardest part is getting started.  Good luck. |`|AA11296044	Piss or get off the pot.  Kick him out.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds harsh, however he isn't going to get a grip of what it takes to be an adult if you don't force him to be one.<br>  <br>  it is not normal at 19 to aspire to be a pot smoking do nothing.|`|AeQAzsQ7aa	I know this is tough but here is the thing... he is not the problem,  you are.<br>  <br>  he knows you, he knows you are not serious & you have created an atmosphere that allows his apathy & laziness to flourish. Words mean nothing, action is all you have. <br>  <br>  Your job as a parent was to love him, keep him alive & raise him to take care of himself. You did the first 2 very well, but you did not teach him the value of self-sufficiency.<br>  <br>  It is not too late, but you need to get your head on straight & come up with a plan. Like an alcoholic you enable him & need to lean the tools not to do this any longer. The first step: get real with yourself & stick to your guns. It will be the greatest gift you will ever give him, I promise.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Quit threatening to kick him out and follow through!! Kick him out!! I would tell him he has 2 weeks to get a job or he'll be finding his stuff on the front lawn and the door locks changed. <br>  No one said being a parent is easy!! You aren't doing him any favors supporting him when he's acting like this.|`|TXSMZsIWaa	sounds like me you have tried everything... but if it were my parents they would just kick me out until i shape up...|`|wOkOdMC8aa	Why are you crying about your son when everybody has told you that YOU are the problem?|`|Wezb6nGmaa	sux2bu|`|2lz3w7Pzaa	Your problem is that you didn't want to over react. Now, you have no choice. Had you taught him to leave the weed alone earlier, you wouldn't be having this problem now. He has to grow up. If he doesn't get a job in two weeks, keep your word and tell him he must move out. Give him no more than 48 hours to get out. Where he goes, what he does, doesn't matter. If he wants a clean roof over his head, he will soon find out he has to pay for it and the only legit way to get money is to get a job and earn it.|`|ClZIm3lyaa	Our friends had this exact problem with their 19 year old and gave him a similar 2 week ultimatum, but the deal was get a job, enroll in school or accept a plane ticket to his dads house on the east coast.  One week in they saw him doing nothing, they brought home boxes and had him start packing up his room.  During the second week they bought him a couple of suitcases, on the last day they drove him to the airport.  That was two years ago, he is now living and working up in the bay area and yes going to school as well.<br>  <br>  Follow through, my guess is that you do a lot of talking by not much actual follow through.|`|PfPNBeXNaa	My 19 year old brother was basically the same way.  He camped on mom's couch all day, didn't have a job, barely helped with anything around the house.  Last week on Monday he left for basic training with the Army.  Its scary with the war going on right now BUT I am glad that he got some direction and will be learning some character.  |`|Ue5NoJOgaa	I'm not saying your situation will be the same, but I got kicked out of high school when i was 16, did nothing but drink (I never liked pot), didn't have a job, didn't go to school didn't do anything important.  When I was about 21 I just started feeling like I should go do something important, so I went back to school and I am graduating at the end of the current term and have been accepted into professional school for next year.  I know it doesn't' really give you any ideas on what to do, but maybe it will give you a little hope, some people are just working on their own time frame.|`|VCQElo7kaa	I am very sorry to hear about your problems with your son. My wife and I are having the same problem with our 20 year old son. He has had two jobs from separate family businesses, and has gotten fired from both. He has lived away from home several times, and has moved back in because of being jobless and broke.<br>  <br>  The last time he moved back home, he claimed he was looking for a job and needed to use the internet to fill out applications. All he did was chat with his friends, download music, and goof-off on MySpace. Also, he borrowed my wife's car to go look for jobs. (His car was in disrepair because he wouldn't get it fixed.) All he did was drive around town doing who knows what. Also, every night, he went out to "hang out" with his friends, and didn't come home until very late, if at all, and then slept until noon, or later.<br>  <br>  My wife finally got fed up (I had been fed up for long time) and told him he had to leave. Fortunately for him, an out-of-town friend of his had offered him a potential job and a place to stay. It sounded like a great offer because that particular friend is hard-working, motivated, and responsible -- a good, positive influence. We quickly helped our son pack his car and sent him on his merry way.<br>  <br>  That was about a month ago. Well yesterday, our son's friend called my wife and said that he was fed up. Our son had not even tried to get a job and was on the verge of being kicked out. My wife then talked to our son and said that he would NOT be allowed to live in our home, period. She was very distraught and cried half the night. We are both very afraid for his future.<br>  <br>  Here is a little more to the story. Our son has also been involved with drinking and smoking pot. We are not sure to what extent, but I think it is a lot more than we know. I suspect that the pot smoking has a part do with him not getting a job because so many employers do drug testing, and he is probably afraid of failing a urinalysis.<br>  <br>  (Man, I hate feeling like our son is a lazy, weak-willed loser. All he does is lie, party, and crap all over everyone who tries to help him. I MISS the good-hearted, funny kid who was a riot to be around.)<br>  <br>  I'm sorry about the venting. I could tell much more, but I think you have the idea. I don't really have any good advice for you because we haven't found a solution that has worked. We are slowly realizing that he is going to have to hit bottom before he wakes up. We just hope and pray that he doesn't hit bottom too hard.

IlL6l3Abaa	Totally normal! Both my kids had in utero hiccups and they have no problems at all. |`|69DjSUVAaa	Bless you, it must be getting a bit frustrating. My son didn't get hiccups during my pregnancy, But he does get them a lot now. But i understand it is very normal.<br>  Good luck with the labour x|`|CPsk9Mybaa	When I was pregnant with my daughter she also had hiccups! Many of my girlfriends have had similar experiences. She doesn't get them very often now (she's almost two).|`|xy0W50Lqaa	This is common.  When I was pregnant the baby always seemed to get hic cups after I had brushed my teeth! so in the third trimester the baby was getting hic cups everyday sometimes more than once a day<br>  As a new born she had hic cups every day but about 20 mins at a time but has never had a problem with colic.<br>  <br>  I havn't got the link but I did read once that when babies get hic cups in utero, that it prepares their diaphram for breathing in the outside world.|`|GcxpffgOaa	My son had them ALL the time before he was born. He would normally have them anywhere from 3-5 times a day. It was crazy. He is now 11 months old and very very rarely gets them. Even when he was younger he didnt get them very much. Just on rare occasion. He did have really bad reflux problems though right after he was born up until he was probably 6 months old so that might be something that is linked to him having hiccups all the time but I am not sure. |`|300ivj1yaa	same here,i am 35 weeks pregnant,ever since i was around four months i have felt her having hiccups,now though they are happening two to three times a day also,<br>  <br>  i just assume its all the drinks i am drinking|`|etHC9ajHaa	yeah .. i get it loads too probley about 4 times a day |`|AA11786696	i don't think it would have anything to do with the ice. but if she gets the hickups 3-4 times a day she will do the same outside of the womb. i had the same thing happen to me. and my 3 week old baby girl has the hickups all the time. we burp her and burp her but she still gets them. it's normal, don't stress.|`|EJrM8gr9aa	that's very normal and common. and im not sure if your midwife's information is correct though. my son got the hiccups countless times a day. at this point i was in the hospital for premature labor. there, my dr told me that that was a good sign because that means that they are sucking on the fluid  and getting the gist of how things work. and i don't think there is any correlation between the ice and your baby's hiccups.|`|AA10971754	I was exactly the same. My daughter Millie had them from about 28 weeks onwards about 4 times a day!. It sometimes would wake me up it the night. Like having a twitch that wont go away! She now has hiccups about twice a day now and she is 8 weeks old. They don't seem to bother her at all. I think your baby might be the same but it is absolutely nothing to worry about. Enjoy x|`|juy2oELpaa	Oh God, i'd forgotten all about that, how odd that i did! Yeah it is quite common, i remember having a scan at around 36 weeks and my son had hicups then. If i can recall for me it was when i ate white bread, although him having hicups didn't stop me from doing that. I quite enjoyed it, always brought a smile to my face. xx|`|wmc7uHLIaa	This happens and is totally normal.  It doesn't mean your baby will have them a lot after birth.  My baby did not get hiccups often when inside, but gets them almost every day now.  Hiccups are nothing to worry about.  They bother us more than the baby.|`|UpYL5zPFaa	When I was pregnant my baby had the hickups several times a day. Now she is 17 weeks old and still has the hickups now and then. But when she was first born she had the hickups 2-3times per day.|`|dded4bc40eb55d26006954bc8ab916d6aa	yes that's normal.|`|uBz9KAaYaa	My son had them in the womb- A LOT. He still had them quite a bit after he was born, but seem to have gone away(mostly) by about 3 months. Neither the O.B. or the Pediatrician seemed concerned about them at all. |`|cS0ct9BVaa	ouch i bet that gives you an upset tummy
azBErFyYaa	I would really recommend going onto a website, I think its called pregnancy.com...I used to access it like once a day.  They have conception calculators, due date calculators, you tell it the first day of your last period, and it can tell you so much information.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, call your doctor OR take a test when your period is late.  You would know that you are pregnant, TRUST ME.  You will probably get really nautious and your boobs will become so soar you won't be able to put on a bra.  These are not symptoms every preg woman experiences but for the most part, I would say most women do.  They are common.<br>  <br>  Anyways trust me, your body will let you know when you are pregnant.  At 6am when you wake up to barf.  :0|`|IVjspiStaa	I'm begging you have safe sex - or wind up on Maury....Get It?|`|33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	Take a test the day your period is due.|`|CIZjK2rAaa	You can take the first response early pregnancy test.  You could get a positive 4 days before you expect your period.  You may want to buy a box with 2 test.  That way if you get a negative and still believe you are pregnant, you can take another one the day you miss your period.|`|w2kBl06Laa	You should know by today. Typically, 11-14 days after you are fertile is the time frame when a pregnancy test would first show positive if there was a baby.|`|yMngradraa	when you miss your period just like any other time.
ixzT5y1gaa	sounds just about right...my daughter was weighed at 15 weeks and was 11 pounds(was 7pound 3oz when born).  Thats right on target, so your son is even gone past the target!  |`|EJrM8gr9aa	My son was born at almost 33 weeks and weighed 3lbs 9oz. When he was 3 months he barely weighed 8lbs. So your son is doing very good with his weight. My son reached 11lbs at 6 months and is still underweight. As mothers of preemie babies, I think we will always be obsessed with their weight.|`|Wgv3psAjaa	My daughter is a very healthy baby! At her last check-up (3 1/2 months old) she weighed almost 16 lbs.! She only weighed 6 lbs. 2 oz. at birth so I was pretty shocked, but her doctor assured me that she's fine.|`|kBammhzZaa	at 3 months my son barely weighed 8 lbs, he was born only 4 days early at 6 lbs but had severe acid reflux now at 25 months he only weighs 22 lbs 5 oz and is 30 inches tall.  
O8h39Se2aa	It's not a right at all - if anything, it's a privilege! My sister is almost 20 years older than me and she wanted me to be in the delivery room when she my nephew. I was only 12! If you tell the doctor that you don't want him in there, then he won't be in there. It's your pregnancy, your baby, so it's up to you. Good luck! :)|`|O8h39Se2aa	It's not a right at all - if anything, it's a privilege! My sister is almost 20 years older than me and she wanted me to be in the delivery room when she my nephew.

Contact your hospital to find out for sure....|`|LKIhUMCgaa	no, it's not true. it's ur right to choose who goes in and who doesn't simply bc of stress u'll be going under if u really don't want him there, they'll have to escort him out if he tries to get in without ur permission.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Nope... you get to decide who gets to be there and who's not.  He's full of it.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Nope, he has no legal standing to be there. Tell him to shove it.|`|jiwTWNNtaa	No. Only you can give someone permission to be there. Even if you were married, you could keep him out.<br>  If you don't want him there, make sure you tell the doctor now so there is no mix up or confusion later. Your doctor will take care of it.|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	You don't have to have anyone in the room with you that you don't want.  Let the nurses handle it.|`|3X0Lsk5caa	No, not at all. The father of my baby cheated on me, and yet he was still upset when I told him I didn't want him in the delivery room. He must be crrraaazzyyy! Giving birth is stressful enough, you need someone with you who can keep you CALM, and NOT add to your stress! I understand him wanting to see his child born, but YOU are the one giving birth, it's up to you. Don't let anyone make you feel bad about your choice. My best friend is going to be in with me for my scheduled c-section. Not my mom, or any family, just her. I know she will keep me calm and help me the most. And I have to add, I am so proud of you for having your baby and not getting an abortion. Congratulations, and good luck!|`|4fe4fa0093052951c5515ef2f32cefffaa	No, he does not.  It's your body, and you have the right to decide who will be in the room besides the doctors and nurses.<br>  <br>  By the way, your boyfriend is in a position to help you and support you in this process.  He isn't (shouldn't) really be there to assert his rights or demand anything.<br>  <br>  If he insists, tell the nurse/hospital to throw him out of the room.  They will go so far as to call security or police to remove him from the room.|`|mSVXV2gbaa	You are the patient.<br>  You have the right to have anyone in the delivery room that you desire,<br>  and not to have people there that you don't want.<br>  Does he have a right to see the baby? Yes, but not while it is being born.<br>  <br>  FOr the sake of your baby, please consider developing a non-confrontational relationship with the dad.|`|WzWaz9hvaa	Your choice and yours alone.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	no its ur choices.... but if he was giving birth to ur baby wouldn't u want to be there???|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Honey why don't you let him in there?<br>  <br>  It's completely your decision, the hospital will enforce it, but it's his child too. <br>  <br>  Im a single mom to be and if the baby's father DID show up, I wouldn't deny him that.|`|cJZL83pLaa	No he doesn't have to be in the room. Just say that you feel really uncomfortable with him staying in the room and that you promise he'll get to see you and the baby later.|`|ikP2yMSkaa	untrue - he has no right in the delivery room.  'matter of fact you can tell the hospital to kick his ... out of the hospital and not let him anywhere near you|`|a6884b4116269b3d1288c76d227f8f70aa	Im not sure about US laws because i live in the UK there may not be a right to have him legally in the room but there are other issues to think of, like he also created this baby and he should get to cherish those first moments when a baby is born because it is the most unique experince anyone will ever feel. <br>  Its actually a good sign that he would want to be there be thankful you could have a bloke that didnt want to know and was completely disinterested.<br>  <br>  Id consider letting him in the room with you, if your worried about dignity and all that dont.. you lose every ounce of that when your in labour anyway....<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|ZajxC1qqaa	actually it is his right im sorry to say but then again i think u get to choose who goes in the dlivery room|`|6D9M9Ej2aa	if you giving birth to that baby then you choose who should be there and who shouldn't.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  oh for johny b :shut up|`|0853971cb093d5dece221ce25779cb76aa	If you dont want him in there, he cant come in there.|`|gs3pJCRQaa	That is totally up to you. He does have that right as the babies father but no he does not HAVE to be in there. You can have just your mom or a friend or no one at all. If you do not want him to be in the room with you than maybe you should talk to him about it and explain why, but why would you not want him in there unless you are not on speaking terms. Good Luck|`|vPSOc093aa	No he dont  have the right. im sure you or the nurse gets to chose who goes in with you|`|AA11599143	No. no one has a right to be in the delivery room, except the doctor of course. you are in charge of your labor for the most part. you can even put a note with the staff to say hes not even alowed to be in the area or see the baby.|`|lxEcPLt6aa	no|`|u6jP7BQNaa	Hospitals go by what the patient wants, and if you don't want him there, he won't be.  Let the nurses know when you go in to give birth, and if he tries to come in, call security.|`|LZVympVcaa	you can have whoever you want in there. it's your choice. he has no rights he's not giving birth.<br>  and if you fights it let him in the room. believe me when he sees it he'll want to leave real quick and in a hurry|`|uhDES90Iaa	He does not have a right to be there if it makes you uncomfortable... all you have to do is tell the doctors you don't want him there and they'll take him out.|`|3nVujiIsaa	No he doesn't have a right. It's your body and you're going to be in an operating room. No one has the right to be in there but you, the baby, and the doctors. Trust me.|`|skWN7jWHaa	no he does not have that right tell him to get a court order if he thinks hes so bright he wont be able to because he has no right|`|mMOgjOQdaa	Nope, you decide. The father's name doesn't have to be on the baby's birth certificate either.|`|JjyX89x2aa	It's the mothers choice of who she wants in there with her or if she even wants any one in there, tell him to take you to court over it.<br>  <br>  I don't know the reasons you don't want him around but if you don't want him there talk to your doctor about it. The hospital I gave birth at gave me a choice when I checked in if I wanted to be private meaning the hospital couldn't tell anyone that I was there, with that I could give them names of people they could let in.|`|ucWh9Sv7aa	no its not his right. just tell the doctors to get him out of there|`|mZ6hoLvMaa	Who cares about your dad! You're pregnant and you're 16!!!<br>  No offense!|`|4o96vx36aa	no thats ur area ur time n doctors would and have to go at all lengths to make u comfortable...he has no right there...hes wrong|`|Crdbwmo7aa	first off... she is anything but a hoe! she is 16 and having a baby. so freakin what!!! i was 17 when i got pregnant with my son.. it doesnt ruin you education or your life. it shows that she is takin responsibility for her actions. i mean jeez. whats with all the dang people that think just cause your a young mom it means your a hoe or wutever. i know alot of teen girls who have killed their babies just because their parents will be mad or because they didnt want to give up their social life.  at least she is accepting the consequences!<br>  <br>  secondly-- its your choice hun. just tell the nurses. and best of luck to you!|`|1EloC7Rxaa	nooo. its ur choice who is in the delivery room and make that clear to him!!!!!|`|9NpKyacFaa	The father of the baby does have a right to be there. It's his baby and I'm sure he'd like to be there for you and see his child being born. <br>  It's your choice if he gets to be in the room with you or not. If you don't him in the room the doctors won't let him in and if he went to court or something with this they'd tell him it's your choice. <br>  Why don't you want him to be there? If you were in his shoes wouldn't you want to be there?|`|8sNSrLxyaa	No, the patient has the right to have who they want in the room, and not to have people they dont want in the room.

Good luck with everything x|`|RVSWVY6kaa	Of course not...... He is absolutely wrong.

Its ur choice. anyway, its his right as the father but its ur right as the mother to make the decision as to who is in the room. Just tell whoever that u fear he will harm the baby if he is in the room.|`|xNMzPH2Taa	Nope its YOUR baby and if you don't want him there than they can call security and make sure he's not in there!! Tell your parents you do NOT want him there and i'm sure they'll make sure.

You can even say he's not allowed in the room at all to see the baby, if you want.

He would be a great support for you, you young so your going to need it.
zVZgYEjMaa	What miffs me off is that PAPs believe that they ought to be involved in the process in anyway, exerting pressure and coercion on the mother, making her feel obligated to give them her child.  You don't like scams?  Don't play a game where almost invariably one side or the other loses.<br>  <br>  It's legal.  And thank god.  Maybe if this sort of thing happens enough people will stop engaging in pre-birth matching.|`|2wyDALHgaa	Its not a fraud, it's a risk that someone takes when they enter into such an agreement.  The payments, according to the courts, are not a "payment" for the child but a gift to the mother made voluntarily to help her through a process.  Of course, for the person making them it's viewed as payment for the adoption process and for the baby but the courts take a different view of it.|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Yes. It is absolutely legal. Pre-birth matching carries this risk and your friends should have been made aware of this. If they were told they were aware of this risk and chose to continue. They should have been prepared for this possibility by the agency. If they were not told they can sue the agency. They should not "lose" the "fees" they have paid the agency but any "expenses' they have paid are considered a "gift" and are not required to be repaid.  <br>  <br>  Paying for an expectant mother's "expenses" is coercive and is a thinly disguised way to make women feel obligated to hand over their baby. It causes PAPs to feel entitled and leaves them open to be hurt and lose money. It is NOT an ideal way to create a family. <br>  <br>  If your friends wish to avoid this in the future, I would suggest that they look into adopting a waiting child from foster care. These children truly NEED homes and are already legally freed for adoption. The costs are nominal.<br>  <br>  ETA: BTW, this situation is what adoption insurance is for. Your friends should look into it.|`|j0xfBk5Caa	And to think, people still say adoption doesn't equal purchasing a child. Your friend wants a refund? Tell them next time they should adopt a cabbage patch kid, Toys-R-Us has a great exchange/refund policy!<br>  <br>  Do you really believe that your friend was more entitled to this child than the child's own mother? Not so my friend, not so. Your friend entered into a contract knowing the risks involved, if they had issues concerning the refund policy they should not have tried to make the purchase, end of story. When I buy a big ticket item I make sure I can get my money back if something goes wrong, if I don't like the refund or exchange policy I shop elsewhere. Tell your friend to get a pocket dog, at least the dog won't understand that their life was bought and paid for.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	Im in shock that you would have a friend who would try to coerce a vulnerable young mother into selling her baby. Karma. Gets 'em every time. <br>   <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.exiledmothers.com/adoption_facts/adoption_coercion.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.exiledmothers.com/adoption_fa...</a>|`|jHZqOuVEaa	It's legal and is a risk that people take when they try to purchase a baby.  In my opinion, your friend is the person who should be prosecuted for a "perfect legal fraud" and should be sitting in jail for attempted coercion.|`|7JEojMgQaa	Ask them if they would like to joint the fight against pre birth matching now. I don't believe anyone should be allowed to pay "gifts" any more than I think someone should be allowed to scam people out of them. Pre birth matching is wrong.|`|0x8Q6rFPaa	Yes, it's legal, and rightly so.  Until the relinquishment papers are signed, the baby is its mother's child.  Paying the mother's expenses is not a guarantee of getting to raise that baby.<br>  <br>  Why?  Because that would be defined as human trafficking, or slavery, in our country.  Unless and until would-be adoptive parents and their lawyers manage to fix it so they can purchase people legally, they'll just have to take a few risks along the road to having a family--just like everybody else.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Absolutely legal, as it should be.  If your friends were paying (for the baby!) for things for the first mother, it is skipping along the path down the road to baby buying.  They are not owed a baby.  They money they are out is a lesson learned.  Don't pay for children.  They can say it was under the guise of helping the mother, but really, they were trying to coerce the baby from her.  <br>  <br>  Kudos to the mother for parenting!  I wish more women would do that.<br>  <br>  Tell your friends to go about things the legal way next time, without pre-birth matching.|`|993127072b7a2a0e8c555efdb241a674aa	ummm.....this aint K-MART....you dont get a refund if you dont like the birthday present. and you dont get store credit either. <br>  <br>  there are risks when you prematch. period. i have a very hard time believing your friends didnt know this. it is one of the risks, they have made tons of movies about it, even a monkey would be aware of the possibilities. <br>  im sorry your friends got themselves into this, but you can not possibility blame the mother for WANTING her child. <br>  <br>  maybe your friends should join the fight against prematching. also, maybe they should check foster care, the risks are much lower. and those are the kids that need a home. <br>  <br>  and for the record...if your friends arent aware, prematching and having the adoptive parents pay for the medical expenses or anything else, is coercian. i wont point the finger and scream 'guilty!' at them, but think about it. put your personal feelings aside for one moment. they are paying someone to take their baby. granted that bio mom is not reaping the fiancial rewards in terms of cash, but they are paying her medical bills.<br>  agencies can make LOTS of things look and seem good, its their job. you have to be smarter than they are.|`|AA12127693	Well of course it's legal.  I am so sorry your friend shelled out all kinds of money for someone elses baby and I am really glad that the child's mother changed her mind.  Yes, I am an adoptive parent who believes that at all cost (except abuse and neglect) children should stay with their families.  <br>  <br>  If she doesn't want her heart broken again - tell her to adopt from Foster Care - those are the children who need homes and it's free!|`|ZM6ztWAzaa	Yep.<br>  Baby buying is illegal.  Any money PAP's give to a mother in hopes of buying a child are actually considered a gift and not refundable.<br>  Maybe next time your friends will try to adopt ethically.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	It is legal and is another example of why pre-birth matching hurts all involved. <br>  <br>  Pre birth matching should be illegal. <br>  <br>  Mothers changing their minds and deciding to parent their children should never be illegal.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	Isn't your friend glad that the child they loved so much that they were willing to raise as their own is starting life without a huge medical debt?  Or were they just trying to buy a baby?|`|nESfk0bXaa	Too bad, so sad.|`|Q49NciNraa	Interesting choice of breed, I mean name, Rabbit.  Have you done this before?  If you’re as strong as you think you are, give your imagination another shot and try to imagine changing your mind.  At least imagine what it would be like to hold your newborn infant in your arms.  Imagine it.  Imagine loving your own child.<br>  <br>  “It is in the contract the the birth mother signs though that if she does change her mind she must pay back all money that was given to her during pregnancy.”  Yeah.  An expectant mother is not likely to enter those contracts unless she is experiencing lack of $$ and support in the first place.  Signing such a contract puts more pressure on her.  Accepting that kind of $$ puts her in a hole that much harder to climb out of.  It takes a really strong woman to change her mind.|`|FeMJDEcIaa	First, I am a pregnant woman working with an adoption agency, I have already picked the adoptive mother and I couldn't be more excited.  I can't imagine changing my mind after giving birth.  <br>  It is in the contract the the birth mother signs though that if she does change her mind she must pay back all money that was given to her during pregnancy.  <br>  I am so sorry that your friend is dealing with this situation.<br>  <br>  And there is no pressure or feeling of obligation to "give up" this child.<br>  <br>  I am giving some one the gift of life, i'm helping make her life more complete.  <br>  I am a strong willed woman and saddly not all birth mothers are so strong, we get alot of crap from people.  And that may have been what made her change her mind.<br>  But if your friend has already paid the agency then the agency should either A) be refunding the money or B) have a another prospective <br>  birth mother in mind for them.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	This disgusts me and can hardly believe I'm responding but no it isn't a perfect legal fraud.  My empathy is completely with the mother for choosing to raise her child.  If you was talking about a car or a house or something like that I could understand your reasoning.  Instead this is about a newborn baby who has had 9 months of bonding with their mother, knowing their mother's heartbeat, smell, sound, movement which is a real bonding experience.  This is a human being you're talking about who deserves the right to be raised by THEIR mother not a possession.|`|ioNKVW9haa	What... so she should be penalized because she chose to keep HER OWN CHILD?<br>  <br>  Look, PAPs who do their research KNOW the risk involved.  It's your friend's own fault if she didn't know it could happen... my God, there are entire forums on the web to help PAPs deal with this VERY issue.<br>  <br>  By the way, it's not legal fraud.  Because the pregnant mother of the child can NOT give that child away until it's born.  And you can't buy and sell human beings, anyway.<br>  <br>  And actually yes, it's QUITE legal in all states.  Nothing you can do.  Sucks to be you (or your friend.)|`|CGAiWPk6aa	Tough teets! Thats wat they get 4 tryn 2 buy a babby. Suckers. I would luv 2 give them some cheeze 4 their whiiiiiiiine.

zVZgYEjMaa	Probably for the same reason that some people think that just because Adoptees who search and reunite with their natural families can't love their adoptive families.  You're right, there is enough love to go around.  But people tell Adoptees all the time that they are disloyal for searching.|`|DHyUnhS1aa	Some people don't even love their biological children.  So I'd have to say its completely possible and just depends on the person.|`|kBp9IzQqaa	Because, people tend to say another and mean the opposite.  I believe you entirely, but like when people say "I rescued this child from crackhoes!" it could actually be that the were taken from normal people.  Don't get me wrong, I believe you, but sometimes you see these PAPs on here that care more about themselves instead of the child.  Adoption is about the child, not the adopter.<br>  <br>  -Tempe|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	"Why can't people understand that a person can love their adopted child as much as their biological child?"<br>  <br>  <br>  Well lets see......<a href="http://www.amfor.net/KillerAdopters/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amfor.net/KillerAdopters/</a><br>  <br>  What happened to the love in those select few cases......shall we get into Aps returning achildren because they can't bond with them or  Aps suing agencies for not getting the healthy foreign toddler they specifically ordered.<br>  <br>  Can you comprehend that many can't and don't.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	There was another thread on this topic yesterday and I have to say it was a learning experience.<br>  <br>  I mean, I completely believed that I loved my children from adoption as much as my child from my body.  But I needed to hear from a bunch of people who I have never met (and have never been adoptive parents) that it just isn't possible.  I think the word "delusional" was used.  I also think it was implied that APs just weren't being honest if they didn't recognize that they can't love their children from adoption as much as their biological children.<br>  <br>  I'm sure glad I had all these people to tell me how I *really* feel, because obviously I am unable to determine for myself what my feelings are and I need strangers to do it for me.  <br>  <br>  Sarcasm aside, I do recognize that relationships are different with different people, including different children in the same family.  But that doesn't put a value statement on the love I feel for my children.  My relationship with my 16 year old son is different than my relationship with my 8 year old.  After all, one is very much a child and the other is on the cusp of manhood.  My relationship with my daughter is different than my relationship with her brothers because she's my only daughter.  That does NOT mean that I love my bio child more than my adopted children.  Or that I love my adopted children less than my bio child.<br>  <br>  ETA: I love it that AFTER our (meaning adoptive parents) ability to love our adoptive children is challenged, THEN we're told if we were secure we wouldn't have to say anything.|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Hi, Cheryl.<br>  <br>  "Why can't people understand that a person can love their adopted child as much as their biological child?"<br>  <br>  Well, SOME can and some CAN'T.<br>  <br>  Why can't SOME people understand that children can love more than one mother?<br>  <br>  Why can't SOME people understand that children can love more than one father?<br>  <br>  Why can't SOME people understand that first parents can love the children they surrendered?<br>  <br>  Why can't SOME just love who they love and not worry about what everybody else thinks?|`|21cf999bfe54057972e1de48b7cd2cf3aa	Well, I am not a parent but I understand simply because I know how much I love my pets, and obviously I didn't give birth to them! And I don't mean to belittle adopted children by comparing them to pets, but it is similar in that you bring home and new family member and love them unconditionally. That is how it has been for me.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	I just believe that the love for an adopted child is different.  Not to say that no one can love their adopted child.  Just that the love for a biological child is different.  There is a connection there that cannot be mistaken for anything else.  There is a bond that doesn't occur with adopted children, because it physically can't.  <br>  <br>  You can love 3 people equally, but the love is different between all of them.  There is nothing to be ashamed of.  I have 5 children, and while I love them all, the love is different with each of them.  As it should be, since they are all different people. <br>  <br>  No one is saying you can't love your adopted child, just that you cannot love them "as if" they were your own, since they aren't.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	As an adoptee, I can say with my parents, that your statement is true. BUT- it is a DIFFERENT sort of love, one that I really cannot find adequate words to express.  <br>  <br>  My brother and I were adopted, my sister was their bio daughter. There was an unspoken bond our mother had with her...on a cellular, biological level. How could there NOT be? She had her. They came from the same gene pool. My sister knew our Mother's voice BEFORE she was born- knew her breathing patterns, her sleep habits, her emotional reactions, we did not. That is not something unusual to my Mom. That is a PROVEN scientific fact.  <br>  <br>  So yes, a p's can and DO love their adoptive children as much as their bio kids, but to say it's not a different kind of love goes against science.  <br>  <br>  Also, as an adoptee in reunion, I can say I love BOTH sets of parents just as much. It's different, but just as much. There's enough love to go around.|`|gJlxZdL5aa	Because not everybody can.   Not everyone can open up there heart enough to even try.<br>  <br>  I don't know if I could truely love a child that wasn't mine, that I didn't give birth too.    I would like to think I could but I really don't know.   I really don't want to find out.  I mean if it turns out I can have a child of my own I will adopt.<br>  <br>  <br>  Not having a child of my own is a big fear of mine.  I believe the first nine months during pregnancy is a very important time for bonding and I can't imagine not being able to do that.<br>  <br>  <br>  I will say I was raised by my mother and adopted by my stepfather.   They have a child together and that child has everything she could ever want.   they love that child unconditionally and she can do no wrong.    Me on the other hand they couldn't wait for me to leave.    I wasn't part of their perfect unit.   Once they had my sister there was no love for me anymore.     I will say I am closer to my stepfather than my actual mother but still its very obvious which child they love more and they make it clear that they love their child together way more.<br>  <br>  I don't like that feeling.    I recently found my father (my mother hates me for this) and I've spent a lot of time out with him and my sisters there and its a lot more welcoming.<br>  <br>  I know what its like to be less loved.   I can see the cycle possibly repeating and I don't like that.

As an adoptive mother, I always believed that everyone could and would love their adopted children just like their biological children.  Now that I have researched a lot more and listen carefully to other people's stories, I find that it is just not the case.  We cannot dismiss the feelings of others when they tell us that they themselves were not treated equally.  It obviously happens, and perhaps even more than we would care to think about.<br>  <br>  I don't let questions like the one you are referring to bother me, and you shouldn't either.  I am very comfortable in my skin and I know how I feel toward each of my children, adopted or biological.  That is enough for me, and I don't feel the need to justify my feelings or prove them to others.

To be honest our relationship really isn't much work.<br>  <br>  My children through adoption, it is work.  We butt heads with silly misunderstandings, sometimes there is an awkwardness.  My oldest and i joke and laugh about the awkwardness now, but it hasn't always been easy.  She is just biologically different from me and reacts to situations differently.  So i have to parent her differently.  I always stop and try to understand things from her perspective first.  If i don't get it i ask her.  So far, with my bio kids i don't have to ask i just know.

SEzIkGNiaa	For a part time job to earn some extra cash, ya, sounds like fun.<br>  For a career, no.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I WAS a video game tester as a teen.<br>  <br>  Of course, that was on the Amstrad 464. Not much chance of developing personality disorders from playing text adventures and Space Invaders :) I wouldn't want my kids testing some of the games out there now - then again, since they have age ratings, a company wouldn't be allowed to employ them for those games.|`|oj1TszL2aa	Working as a video game tester would probably been seen as the ideal job for many teenagers (those who enjoy playing computer games at least). However, I think any computer games company would need to feel that the young person that they were employing was mature enough to fully understand what the job involved, rather than just seeing it as 'being paid to sit and play computer games' and nothing else. <br>  <br>  Minimum age laws with regards to being allowed to work would still apply, and also they would need to bear in mind that some games have 15 or 18 ratings, and so there may be problems with asking young teenagers to test these. <br>  <br>  If you're meaning from a parental point of view, I'm not too sure if I'd want my teenager doing that as a job. Personally I think I'd rather them be doing a job which helps them to develop their interpersonal and communication skills, and video games testing isn't really likely to do that. That and I know for a fact that many IT graduates who are interested in working in games production and development work in games testing after they have graduated, so I would have thought that a company would be unlikely to give a job to a teenager when they could give it to a graduate who has spent the last 3 years studying the methods and artwork used in computer games at degree level! <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  x|`|H79TKKiBaa	:o that sounds like the holy grail of jobs 4 many guys i know<br>  do people really get paid for that :||`|IAzCsvaNaa	yes

Jo8nlGVsaa	She could be pregnant but as you know it is too early to tell. You should ALWAYS use protection, even though it isn't as fun. Its better then worrying about it for a month. If she takes a test in a month or so and it comes back positive call planned parenthood and set up and appointment to talk to someone about your options. Check out the site below to find locations and numbers. Good Luck!|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	It doesn't sound like she is pregnant.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	if she's pregnant it's likely to be from when you put it in halfway and not from ejaculating on her chest.  there's this thing called pre-ejaculate and when you put your penis in her, it's possible some of that may have caused pregnancy.  unless you believe in immaculate conception, ejaculating on her chest isn't going to cause pregnancy.<br>  <br>  not likely she's pregnant but you'll have to wait until her next missed period to take a test.<br>  <br>  good luck and quit having unprotected sex.|`|4hFT5JcLaa	It is possible, but not totally likely.

It cannot abort an existing pregnancy all it does it make it harder for the cells to attach to the uterus wall, hence making it harder to become pregnant, but if you are already pregnant it has no effect. If you're girlfriend is in college she should know this?

I also occasionally experience this.  There was even a guy on a comedy show on tv who admitted to it!<br>  <br>  I have been meaning to try hypnosis but not got round to it yet.  But I did try to 'hypnotise' myself by telling myself before I went to sleep that if I experienced a dream I must wake up.  I also told myself that if i had a dream about a toilet, it must be a toilet that is unusable in some way - either broken or filled up with something.  Once I had a dream that the toilet was filled with bricks and could not be used.  This did seem to work for a while but I think you have to repeat the 'hypnosis'  Just last night I dreamt that a toilet was unusable  - so I managed to go in a bucket instead!  Need to add that to the list.<br>  <br>  I am seeing a women's health physio following a rather long labour with my baby last year - she deals with getting ladies pelvic floor back into shape - I discussed with her and she said that many of her patients have mentioned these dreams to her and the problem of bed wetting.  She said she occasionally has these dreams but is able to wake herself up.  So she thinks it might be that I am in such an incredibly heavy sleep that i am unable to wake!<br>  <br>  I did a bit of research a while back and here in the UK there are some clinical hypnosis therapists that are experienced in treating this problem so I am probably going to try that out when I get around to it.<br>  <br>  Although I don't know if I believe in hypnosis, it seems to be the only option at the moment!<br>  <br>  Good luck
RxhBUkwSaa	Give up her child because he cries!  What an awful thought.  This woman needs some real practical help.  I'm not being a wise-guy, she honestly does.  A crying baby can be overwhelming... but he doesn't cry all the time.  He sleeps doesn't he?  Some babies are very hard to settle, some do suffer from colic and other things that make the fussy.  Some just aren't having their needs met in a way that makes them happy.  Has she tried wearing him in a cozy sling?  <br>  <br>  A parent that is overwhelmed by a fussy baby needs a family member, friend, or hired help to give her some respite.  Doulas do just this very job for new moms.  Help her find real practical help!|`|IuJjYz6gaa	I understand how she feels.  It's hard when your baby cries all the time and you don't understand why.<br>  <br>  Have her take her baby to the doctor.  Maybe he has acid reflux.  Maybe there is something else wrong with him.  With the help of a doctor, they can figure out what is going on.<br>  <br>  Most of all, give her support.  Let her have some time to herself without the crying baby.  Offer to take the baby for a while so she can go after groceries or go see a movie.  She needs to get her head straight because the stress of this is getting to her.|`|inA6ZLeAaa	He probably has colic, she need to take him to the pediatrician and get a prescription.

Not keeping your home clean so they later learn that is the way your home should be. If you are a slob guarantee your kids will be. I could just keep going.

If you are guilty of a couple you are not necessarily a bad or lazy parent but when a few are done constantly you need to change some things. <br>  Ignoring your child instead of playing with them.<br>  Propping a baby's bottle to feed them.<br>  Ignoring a baby when they cry for you.<br>  Hitting or yelling at your kids instead of talking to them and having patience. <br>  Letting them eat fast food instead of making them good food. <br>  Not taking them out to parks and places to play and have fun and sitting home on the couch instead. <br>  Not researching things about kids and babies before you make a decision and just going with what everyone else does.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	It's about how much effort you put onto raising your kid(s).<br>  <br>  - Are they in school?<br>  - How did you pick the school?<br>  - Are you involved at school?<br>  - Do you know all the kids' teachers?<br>  - Do they know you?<br>  - Do you know your kids' friends?<br>  - Do you know where they are all the time and who they are with?<br>  - Do you have a plan to pay for their college education?<br>  <br>  Things like that.

I would also consider it as a parent who maybe doesn't check to see what their kids are doing for homework, or how they are doing in school and then wonders why their child is failing... It could be viewed as several things honestly.. But then if a lazy parent the same thing as an irresponsible one? Maybe a lazy parent doesn't clean house and do laundry or something.. As in they allow their children to live in filth! I am not shure now that I think about it. There seems to be a fine line between what i'd view as "irresponsible" and "lazy".|`|zH1sg3Xraa	I think that some people become a parent and then do not want to spend quality time with the child. They usually say things like "go outside and ride your bike and get some exercise." Or, they give the child money to go see a movie and play at the mall. They just do not like spending quality time with a child. They want to talk to their friends or other relatives or they just want the child out of the house. They are lazy.|`|dbXnW5emaa	Well, for starters, I checked out your blog and you definetly do not qualify as lazy parents.  I applaud the love you have for your children.

Lazy parents bring their kids to church then leave and come back and get them later - some don't even come back and we have to take them home.  It's the same with ball practice and ball games.  Lazy parents don't help their kids with their homework, or teach them how to ride a bike, or mow the yard, or work in the garden, or clean up their room, or cook, or wash the dishes, etc.  <br>  <br>  In short, lazy parents depend on other parents to raise their kids for them.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	one who doesn't care or try to do their best w/their child|`|AA10091300	by sitting their kids in front of the television and letting it raise the kids, by staying on the computer and not paying attentions to the kids,<br>  by never teaching them right from wrong and ignoring their needs.

While we were spanked, she got empty threats.  They never got onto her for doing bad, in fact they'd coddle her when I or my brother would discipline her.<br>  <br>  She would throw things in the buggy while shopping and when someone would remove it she'd cry and they easily gave in.  She refused to use a trash can, instead dropped wrappers and papers and such on the floor.  There would be a few instances when she would even hurt us, like throwing a yoyo and busting me right in the temple with it, and run to our parents when I yelled and threw the yoyo back.  She got coddled, I got yelled at, never mind the possible concussion.<br>  <br>  Their excuse?

Ironically I ended up going into labor that same day lol.<br>  <br>  This time I was only 2 cm at 38 weeks which I don't understand at all because I was 3 cm during this time with my first.

This baby just doesn't seem to want to come :(. <br>  <br>  Good luck...we're so close.

I bought one with a harder spout and she took right too it.  I can't remember exactly how old she was maybe 7 months?  She would only drink sips at that age.  Not until recently has she actually "drank" the water or watered down juice.|`|FLpMShKNaa	My son took bottles grudgingly at daycare, just enough to survive and refused them at around 8 months. I had already started trying sippies, bought every type available to no avail. But, we learned he would sip out of an open cup, he just hates spouts. So we buy the little 3 oz. plastic cups, we have to help him hold it but he is now weaned after a year and takes plenty of fluids. So, keep trying the sippy, at this age she really doesn't have to have anything but breastmilk, but if all else fails later try the regular, open cup. Its less convenient than the sippy, but OTOH, you won't have to take away a sippy later.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	My daughter was the same way.

hGY08GjRaa	Not to negate the NEGATIVES... but it seems to me most girls/women who believe that they will chose to put their baby up for adoption would WANT the option of chosing the couple the baby goes to.. AND would WANT the option of "Getting to know them" before hand.<br>  <br>  I  mean, If I were to give anything precious to someone else, I would want to know them, and chose who to give it to. <br>  <br>  <br>  But I realize there are many negatives to pre-birth matching. Girls need to be warned about not getting backed into a corner that won't be easy to get away from.. There needs to be an overhaul of how things are done. <br>  <br>  But how to we get rid of the negatives, while still allowing women who wish to place their child for adoption the option of choosing the couple and getting to know them.. IF SHE WISHES?? I'm asking seriously.. how can we make this better..  I'm not trying to "justify" pre-birth matching. <br>  <br>  Do all the choosing and "getting to know" after-birth?  That does sound better.. but what if the girl has  no support for parenting her child, even for a few weeks?  <br>  <br>  I don't know.. I really want to make things better.. I'm just throwing questions out there.<br>  <br>  Seriously.. reading some of these responses, makes my heart break as  a PAP..   Can't anyone believe that ANY of us go into an adoption thinking about more than just ourselves?? I  absolutely believe and would  be the first to defend ANY woman's right to "change her mind and parent." Am I a horrible person, just because I'm an AP.. seriously.. read TIsh, Independant, and cantstop's responses again.. it kills me that people must think that ALL we care about is that womb fresh baby, that the ONLY reason we want a "bond" or "relationship" with a mother is so she won't feel she can change her mind.. Why can't anyone believe that any of us might have one smidgen of something besides selfishness in our being??<br>  <br>  I ask again.. would any woman who feels the need to give her child up for adoption wish to have NO say in who adopts him/her or NO opportunity to know what kind of people they are?  Should we take away that as an option?|`|DHyUnhS1aa	Um... well, birthmoms could pretend they were going to put it up for adoption and scam aps into paying their medical bills.  Technically that would probably be good for both the birthmom and the baby because they get a free pre-birth ride, but obviously it would be bad and a dissapointing waste of money for the aps.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Well, people would know that the mom isn't a crack whore who is in it for the money.<br>  <br>  Edit... my feelings are really hurting with all these thumbs down.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	I think that if a woman is truly unable or unwilling to be a parent, she should have the option to choose an adoptive family that she feels will be the best adoptive couple for her child.  <br>  <br>  I think that as long as clear boundaries are in place, especially the absolute understanding of the woman's legal and moral right to change her mind, it isn't necessarily a coercive thing.  But I think the onus here is on the woman considering adoption.  If -she- wants to meet or speak to potiential adoptive parents.  <br>  <br>  I don't agree with the state randomly matching infants with adoptive families.  I think that if someone is choosing to place their child for adoption, they should be able to choose the adoptive parents, based upon whatever criteria they feel is important.  If the woman wants to meet with the potiential adoptive parents beforehand, I don't think she should be told by the state that she can't do that.  <br>  <br>  I also think, if done correctly, the "get to know you" time before birth can help make an easier transition to a stable open adoption.  <br>  <br>  This is just me spitballing, but if I were an adoptive parent through domestic infant adoption, the idea of ongoing contact with the child's first mother would seem less intimidating or less awkward, if we had some kind of relationship beforehand.  I have no idea if there are any statistics out there to back that up, but I'd be curious to see if there is any correlation between ongoing open adoptions in families where a relationship between the first family and the adoptive family began before birth.|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Lori,<br>  <br>  I personally couldn't think of any so I thought I'd look around. Here are some of the gems I found:<br>  <br>  Listed under advantages for birthparents:<br>  <br>  "Sense of control - Having the ability to review, interview and select the parents you place your baby with usually provides birthmothers with a sense of empowerment and control."<br>  <br>  Listed under advantages for Adoptive Parents:<br>  <br>  "Affirmation - As an adoptive family, you may experience a sense of empowerment or encouragement knowing that you were ‘chosen’ as the adoptive family."<br>  <br>  Included in a general description:<br>  <br>  "If a birthmother is open to contact pre-birth, the office strongly encourages clients to maintain at least a minimal amount of telephonic contact to help facilitate the bonding process.  If a feeling of comfort, as well as a bond of trust, can be established between yourselves, these feelings can help solidify an adoption plan, as well as helping make the birthmother's placement easier at the time of birth.  If it is possible for you to physically meet with your birthmother, it can be beneficial in that you both have the opportunity to learn more about each other than you might be able to on the telephone.  Clients who are initially uncomfortable speaking with or meeting a birthmother generally feel more comfortable about the adoption process after doing so, as this serves to remove the “mystery” from the process, thus helping to alleviate fears and anxieties on both sides.  The office will provide  you with assistance in communicating with a birthmother, such as what questions to ask and what “red flags” to watch for."<br>  <br>  On a site about embryo adoption (which is technically "pre-birth" matching too.):<br>  <br>  "Advantages to the woman (and her partner, if any) compared to regular adoption:<br>  *She experiences the joys of pregnancy. They have the opportunity to bond with the embryo and fetus before it is born.<br>  *The procedure can be much quicker than an adoption. With the scarcity of eligible children, adoption might take many years to arrange.<br>  *The mother-to-be has control over the pregnancy. Some children who are available for adoption have suffered from inadequate pre-natal medical attention, the use of street drugs by the mother, etc.<br>  *Embryo adoption would literally save the life of a number of embryos. To strict pro-lifers, "surplus" frozen embryos are not simply human life; they are full "pre-born human beings." To them, each embryo adoption would save the life of a human person.<br>  *The clinic may supply her with more medical, social and psychological data about the donors than she might be able to obtain from an adoption agency.<br>  *She may take greater comfort in knowing that the embryo was formed as a result of another loving couple's attempts to become pregnant. The conception of many adopted children are accidental and unintended, or may even have been the result of rape or incest.<br>  *Depending upon the clinic's regulations, she may have some choice in selecting suitable donors. <br>  *Embryo adoption provides an opportunity for older women to become pregnant. "For women over 45, the chance of her embryo becoming a baby is almost zero. The inability to make embryos that become babies is why couples turn to donor eggs or donor sperm." <br>  <br>  *sigh*<br>  <br>  I have to stop now before I throw up...<br>  <br>  Eta; I find it hysterical that my answer is getting so many thumbs down. I didn't make this stuff up! These are direct quotes from agency sites - not my creative talent. So either the thumbs down are coming from people who thing this stuff is okay (WTF?! Yikes!) or people who think that these are bad examples of the so-called "positives". (In which case I totally agree! There is no real positive in PBMs.)|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Only positives would be for the agency and adopters.|`|kBp9IzQqaa	Um, let me think.  APs can prepare a name, make a nursery, bascially NONE!|`|BTuFtui3aa	If a mother truly can't or doesn't want to parent, it might be reassuring and less stressful for her to know her child has a good potential home instead of dreading the unknown for her entire pregnancy.<br>  <br>  That's the best I can do, as frankly I think it's mostly negative. Pre-birth matching makes it harder for a mother to change her mind and decide to parent, and may pressure her into placing. Pre-birth matching also sets up unrealistic expectations for prospective adoptive parents, who may start to think of the baby as "their" child while the biological parents still have full rights. I think it has a lot of potential to hurt people.<br>  <br>  I'm actually against the concept of pre-birth matching, so don't take this as an endorsement. But you asked for a positive, so I said one, even though I have a negative view of the concept as a whole.|`|jrCZ6fadaa	In our case, his mother knew that if she chose adoption, we were there willing to adopt him, no matter what.<br>  <br>  So here's where the whole "abortion and adoption have nothing to do with each other" argument falls apart.<br>  <br>  There are *some* women who know their child will be born very ill and do not want to parent. They fear the child going into foster care and not having a "forever family" so she opts for private adoption, so she KNOWS the child will have a home. Perhaps the mother whats to choose the home and not rely on a faulty foster care system to give it a go. If adoption were not an option in THESE cases, I believe some women would prefer to abort against their own beliefs. Many of these would be late term abortions and are traumatic (not saying that adoption isn't). <br>  <br>  I don't believe that the "pre-birth matching" is THE problem, it's the piss poor attitudes people have going into it. We had the attitude of IF this is what you want, we will be here no matter what. If you want to parent, we are here NO MATTER WHAT! It was about him from day 1, We never searched for a baby to adopt, but when there was a baby needing a home, we were Simply available......<br>  <br>  We knew he would have problems and we had time to prepare, pray,  apply for FMLA to be there when he was born. We also had time to prepare our daughter for what may happen and their Ped so she is aware of his situation. Our kids doctor is amazing, she even went to a weekend seminar to learn more about our sons condition so she can better prepare for him.<br>  <br>  As far as having agencies "matching" I do worry that pressure is put on the expectant mother to "follow though", and I blame this on the sence of entitlement people take with them when they start the process. To think someone "owes" anyone else a baby is just insaine. <br>  <br>  When our son was born, I prayed that him mom would parent him, but it just wasn't going to happen, for many reasons. With all the health problems, I don't know that he would be alive today if he would have been in their home, not because he they can't love him, or that they can't care for their typical children (who they take good care of), but he needs 24 hour care and a stay at home parent.

SE23R8xgaa	French or Latin.<br>  <br>  I like french because their names sound so elegant and almost melodic in their pronunciation. And -elle makes a girls name sound so feminine.<br>  <br>  Latin names tend to have a lot of meaning and they've probably been around for the longest time so they're more traditional.|`|wzmo2Ju7aa	My favorites are usually French, like Charlotte, Madeleine and Vivienne. I guess I just like the way they flow, and the fact that they are so delicate. I do like Italian names sometimes too, luke Lucia or Matteo. I'm not a fan of American names like Brooklyn or Taylor. They don't sound right to me, and are I guess almost harsh sounding?|`|CTmWS6dMaa	French and I don't really know why. I tend to love -elle and -phine names I guess.|`|67wtx50gaa	i like certain names from each.<br>  but i like more 50's era names.<br>  like Leu Leu and Pheobe. :)|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	When you say American, do you means names like Amy(french), Ariana(Italian),  Diana(latin); Elizabeth or Sarah(hebrew); Hayley(english) and Catherine(greek)<br>  I would say American, because it could be almost anything|`|34VXCyvVaa	I love French, Italian and Latin names, but I'd give my kids American names because I'm proud of my country and this is where I'm raising my kids.|`|tSEA42Uraa	I mostly turn towards Latin names. Two of my favorite names, Caroline and Adrienne, are Latin. I also like English names, like Evangeline, Willow, and Shelby. I also like the polish name Katarzyna. (Kuh-tar-jin-uh)<br>  <br>  So, I guess, from your choices: Latin :)|`|eDmdkUO3aa	French names for girl because they are feminine and pretty.

If you have issues with them, talk it over. If you are not comfortable leaving your child, don't- but at least discuss the issues with them honestly. The best way is the open and honest way.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Just don't leave them alone. Never let them babysit. Say you don't need a babysitter. A supervised visit is one thing, but just say no if they offer to babysit.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	it's simple. don't ask them to baby sit and don't leave them alone with your baby. you don't need to explain your reasoning to anyone. you are the mother and you know what's best for your kid. if they ask to watch him (alone) simply tell them it's not necessary but you appreciate their wanting to help (just to be nice). you don't EVER HAVE to leave your kid with someon you don't feel comfortable with.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	DONT my father has beat me at the store ( after adulthood) abused me verbaly.. he works at a school & has some choise words for the kindergardeners there & he wants to take my son fishing when he gets older but i will NOT allow it i dont care what kind of problems i start|`|a79b376f814b9b52daa5b96365dcd2caaa	You know what ? this is really SIMPLE.  DO NOT leave your children alone with them,  EVER and if they do not like it TOUGH.  You are their MOTHER and responsible for their physical and mental well being.  Do not be intimated by ANYONE.  Thank you and good luck.|`|Q7ALl9zeaa	Bottom line is, you are the Mom and you sure don't have to leave your baby with anyone that makes you uncomfortable. Just because they are "family" doesn't mean they are reliable or healthy for your child. I am sure it is uncomfortable to be in this situation, but never feel guilty for being a good mom. Maybe, just never let the opportunity arise for the need to have alone with your child. It could be that they are actually trying to get close for good reasons, but i suggest listening to your mommy voice. If your husband is in conjunction with you on this, awesome, that is half the battle. Sit with your husband and discuss any issues that may arise, like them asking to sit for you sometime, that way you are not caught off guard in the situation.|`|jQTKZSAAaa	Always have something you and the baby have to go do to avoid leaving the baby with them. Or take my approach and tell them " I would enjoy you getting to know the baby and making up with my husband and I, but I am simply not comfortable leaving my child with you." Yes, it will certainly piss them off, but who cares?? It's your baby and you and your husbands decision. Do what you think is best all of you, especially the baby. Honesty is typically the best avenue, but you never know when it is family. Good luck to you, its a tough situation!|`|5ci9IZd2aa	Don't be concerned with how you will be perceived. I had a similar situation with my In-laws, they just were not adequate care-givers. I was labled the *****, I didn't care, my childrens safety was my only concern. I didn't keep them from my child, but me or my husband were always present during outings or visits.|`|UqJkx1nhaa	I would just be up-front and tell your husband how you are feeling. If you think that your child would be in any danger with them then I would prevent it. It's up to your hubby to tell his parents not you. He owes you that much respect. He probably feels the same way that you do. Good luck.|`|4S8IKFn0aa	Don't leave him/her alone. Just carry it in one of those strap on baby backpack things.

I don't believe being in a nail salon for an hour is going to effect the baby. I wouldn't work at one though..I'm sure exposure over an extended period of time wouldn't be good. IF paranoia is still there, they have masks, ask for one :)|`|MCTyWCu2aa	Ok 1st answerer i think she's talking about the smell not toe infections. Im not quit sure about that. I was wondering that too.|`|o5rfI7oUaa	No you can go as long as you don't inhale a lot of chemicals|`|wKuQC4yTaa	I get one every 2 weeks. pedi and mani.  just tell them to be careful not to cut your skin, so you don't get infections.|`|smcWIZxPaa	yes, pamper yourself and get those toes done! I went very often when i was pregnant with my son|`|AA11612508	yep of course.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	I get my nails done every 2-3 weeks and sometimes a pedi along with it. I know that when you are far enough along you should not get a pedi because the way they massage your feet could put your into early labor. I dont think the chemicals will harm you too bad unless they are REALLY strong but ive been going to the same people for a while now so they give me one of those nose and mouth mask. I know i probably look kinda funny lol but it works and alot of the workers there wear them and there are a few other girls i know that go there and wear them.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i got a pedi soon before i had my son and in the pictures my feet look great!fatter but great:)|`|3qI1oyFaaa	You can go, but wait until your second trimester, and ask for a mask, a fan, and to be near a window or door just to be safe, so you get enough ventilation from the fumes.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck :)|`|hWc65sEtaa	I did.  There wasn't a lot of chemical smells to worry me.  I had my nails done about every 2 weeks while pregnant and my baby was fine.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	It's fine to go get your nails done. I go every two weeks. Try to get someone to go your nails near the door so you get more fresh air.|`|T48smu01aa	I just had my nails and toes done last week and I am almost 29 weeks....your fine. :)
eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	6-12----talk about sex and explain that it is an adult act and for adults only<br>  <br>  12-15+---- talk about ways to say no and that not everyone is having sex no matter what they say...this is when I'd tell them where babies come from and talk about birth control|`|JcwjDpY8aa	on tv or computer?  First of all, it depends on how clear you have made it to them that it is inappropriate.  There should be controls that block things like this, and usage should be monitored.  If they knew it was wrong, I would sit them down and provide them with other resources, such as books for children that have information about sex, because children tend to look at adult content due to curiosity.  If they dont have a clear knowledge of not being aloud to look at the material and why they shouldn't, you need to sit them down and have a long talk.|`|eceLQUj5aa	First of all it is probably time to have some kind of discussion about the responsibilities of sexual maturity. Condoms, birth control, the emotional connections that form around sex, and preparing them for the world of adults they are about to enter.<br>  <br>  Second, I would inform them about the proper places, times, and sources to be viewing this material. No, you will not use my money to pay for pornography. No you will not use the public family computer to find pornography. Yes, it is your body, don't hurt yourself.|`|HbciMmROaa	well I caught my 8 year old daughter trying to watch Real sex(hbo on damand) I didnt yell i turned it off and then quickly put on the parental controls( we just moved and I forgot to do that on her tv) And then had the sex talk..|`|9PlDaDzuaa	I would probably use it as a teaching moment as they have already seen it. Then I would set some boundaries about what they are allowed to look at and not allowed to look at on the internet and what the repercussions would be for breaking the rules that you have just set out.<br>  <br>  Also I would have the computer in a common room so that the kids can be monitored closer about what they are looking at. As well as look into the programs that you can buy to limit certain sites without a password.<br>  <br>  As though they have already looked at it use the first instance as a teaching moment to talk about the birds and the bees or respecting each other.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|4NiGsqnCaa	Oooh, well my oldest are only six and a half....but one of them is already concerned about her body image! So I try not to let my kids look at magazines with unrealistic celebs. If I caught them looking at adult content, I would probably tell them that it is not okay, and to not do it again. If I catch them doing it again there will be a consequence, such as room time. But i doubt my girls would ever do that since I'm with them a lot and they don't spend time on the computers or watching t.v.|`|WbYDLP0paa	age: from 8 to 15<br>  i would just talk to them let them understand is someting you do when you get old and not while ther younge<br>  <br>  age 16 and up<br>  explain protection and babies|`|CrsK0p1Yaa	high five them and tell them "that a boy".|`|YuVSDBkzaa	He/she would be grounded...I would then have a long talk about why it's inappropriate. My mom went through this with my sister when she first started using the Internet...of course she was grounded for a while and then strictly monitored when using it after...Again, if it were my daughter, I would have a long talk about it with her.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Start the sex talks.  Teach them what their looking at is fantasy world. Life is not like that. Tell them their not old enough for that stuff yet. Let them know that the things they will learn from their friends is a load of crap and to come to me with their questions.
MgvYMfIWaa	just wait until she is ready. you cant force her if she isnt ready to do it. my daughter just turned 3 in dec and we are just starting back up on potty training. i tried everything while i was pregnant and it never worked now she is in big girl panties and doesnt like them taken away so she can only wear them if she uses the potty.<br>  <br>  also you may try backing off completely for a while until she shows interest in it. try taking her to the potty when you go and ask if she has to go and if she at least sits on the potty praise her but dont try and force it on her.|`|mDYsr62maa	Here is how it works.  Parents teach kids when and what to do.  They are not pets that just pick it up at their own pace.  When she needs to go, put her on the potty and she stays until she goes.  Period.  No excuses.  Even if she falls asleep waoting.  First thing in the morning is best and then about every two hours after that.  The appropriate parent also shows by example.  All of the studies that say wait until they are ready were funded by diaper companies so they can sell more diapers.  Jeeze, kids.|`|koymw0cZaa	Please arrange an autowash WC for her|`|1enIWBGnaa	Why are YOU allowing her to tell you what to do?????<br>  Buy a 'child sized' portable toilet seat and have her use a normal toilet.|`|uhZzEzu0aa	I actually saw this in my doctors office. Kids have there own time on when they wanna go it doesn't work on your time. She's not even 3 yet so i wouldn't worry all that much. Talk on her level tell her when you have to go do a little dance for mommy ok that way i know you have to. Also start putting her her pull ups or underwear that usually gets it going. Don't feel frustrated or get discourage they sense that and it makes that much hard on them hope this helps. But if you really are that concerned ask her doctor when she gets her check up to see if there is anything you can do|`|B2w5MwjXaa	every ones says they might not be ready but that is too frustrating.  help them along.  it is difficult.  i had the same problem with my twin girls.  we took away their pants and undies/diapers.  they didnt want to go on themselves, so they had to go in the potty.  but beware that children will try to hold it in, so give them foods like oatmeal, foods that will keep them regular and make them have to go, and lots and lots of water.  dont give presents when they go ro even try.  they will just start acting like they are trying to get the prize.  had to cut that one off.  also you can tell your child that he has to get rid of the diapers.  you can have him give them to another baby you might know or have HIM put them in the dumpster.  i tried the book things and what not too and they did not work.  the only thing that did work was no pants and tons of patience.  DONT GIVE IN AND GIVE A DIAPER OR PULL UP|`|PeEIuzP5aa	All you do to help her go potty, is you take in to bathroom with u and say look mommy is going pee see now you try going pee. it help when my daughter but i trained her when she was 6 months.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Back off.  Don't make it a control issue.  Tell her she can wear diapers until she's ready to use the potty, then drop it.  She'll do it when SHE feels like she's ready and has control.|`|4084a028d749f0067792bb6e4278b52daa	she may not be ready. my son is 3 and a half and ive been trying for over a year. he is just NOW getting it. this week. and i have a sticker potty chart for every time he goes. he gets to pick a sticker. when he gets 20. he gets to go to chuck e cheese. he now has 11. its working. slowly. but its working. good luck. maybe give your daughter a lil more time...
t0mb150gaa	Make sure the school is made aware of all her allergies. Most schools are very cautious when dealing with allergies and will make sure to keep her away from them. Peanut butter and peanuts are not even allowed at most schools anymore they make sure to send out notices to parents to not pack that in there children's lunches(at least that is the way it is in canada). Also during holidays(valentines.christmas,easter) when the classes have there parties they will notify all parents in your childs class not to let there children hand out things that your child is allergic to. Also make sure to tell your child the things she cannot have and not to eat anything other children have in there lunches(milk,eggs,tuna)|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	For kids with food allergies that severe and that vast, it'd be smarter for you to pack her lunch each day, when schools make lunches they cannot keep things from getting cross-contaminated with other ingredients. It just happens, just like at subway, everything has probably touched everything else and if you have a life threatening allergy it's just safer to avoid it. Request to meet with the teacher and principal and nurse before the start of the school year and be sure to stress that these things are life threatening and she cannot under any circumstances come into contact with peanuts and eggs or products that contain them. Ask the teacher to let you know if there is going to be a class party and send your daughter with her own treats that day so she doesn't feel too left out.|`|a1731418e68343f01ae82b7c12846cf2aa	I would call the school and try to make an appointment with the principal to discuss how they handle children with severe peanut allergies.<br>  <br>  I don't know how practial it would be, but I've seen 2 news stories within the last week about kids with deadly peanut allergies who could die just by touching something with peanut residue.  They have special dogs trained to sniff out peanuts or residue and alert the child to stay clear.|`|Xngq54vBaa	If you let them know that she has severe allergies (might want to keep an epi pen in the office if it's that serious), the school will not give her foods that have those things in it.  Some schools are "peanut free" and no kids can bring them in their lunches, if yours isn't you may just want to make sure they seat her at a table separately from the class.  However, the school can't regulate other parents bringing in treats and you may need to teach your daughter to say "no thank you" to foods she's offered.|`|hdFSt0xNaa	Make her packed lunches. Would you rather risk it & lose you child or be safe & spend a bit more time making lunch.|`|AA11537580	teach her not to touch anyones food, no sharing and only eat what you pack for her.<br>  keep reminding the school, principal and teacher of your child's  allergies.|`|ZcHzNX4Uaa	make her lunches for her is your best bet its likely they will forget bout her allergys every now and then|`|UnvpnmEGaa	Talk to the school administrator. When I worked in a small day care program we always had to be aware of kids allergies. The administrator should be able to tell you what the school policies are and what precautions are in place. Then talk to the teachers so they know the extent of her allergies. Does it only affect her in eating or will she have a reaction if it's on her skin (hand contact from snack time). Also being 5 I'm sure your trained her well to know she can't eat certain things and should ask what's in something before she eats it.  If she has an eppi pen you should talk to the teacher about having one on hand in the classroom or in her backpack should she need one. <br>  We had a child once with life threatening allergy to Dairy and she came with an eppi pen every day and we had to wask all the kids hands after snack time because the crumbs from the 'gold fish' crackers couldn't get on her skin.<br>  I would think that when the allergy is life threatening the school has to have some type of plan in place to handle it.

s4LWmcTjaa	I know I'm not in your shoes so I can't possibly know what it's like to have this boy in your home, but you are probably the best thing for him.  He needs stability and stable parental figures in his life.<br>  <br>  It's tough and it will be tough for a while.  This boy needs structure and discipline.  Please love him enough to not give up on him.  Be the example he needs.  Get him enrolled into some counseling and give him a structured life.|`|T864ejaiaa	i would love the child and let him know i love him and try to get him help. he needs a dad who can teach him things. it sounds like he is lashing out because of what his parents have done. YOU grandma need to let him know it is not his fault. let him know his dad and mom is not well and need help. i know your old and tired. but please don't give up on the child. ask your other daughter to help with him. if she is married ask your son in law to spend time with the boy. when the boy reached the ages 11 to 13 you will lose him if you haven't already. god help him, he might turn out like his mom. ask your good daughter to think about taking the boy and getting custody of him. good luck.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	You should have done something about his custody long ago. He needs help. He needs to see a psychiatrist or something. He obviously has some unresolved issues and they are not going to fix themselves. Yes I would keep him if I were you. What is done when he does these bad things?|`|P4LBygv2aa	go for full custody of this child , he needs to see he is where he is loved most and wanted ,that's the key word wanted , its hard for him as well as it is for you , look at it how he dose , what he has seen and how he views himself, he lives with you , mom is wherever , dad too , so where dose he belong and to who , and why dosent mom or dad take care of him ? his mind at 10 is all over the place , you need to give him an absoulte , I have a soon to be 13 year old , his dad is a dead beat in every way , for 4 years he clams no income and hides behind the bipolor letter the doctor wrote for him , he works on the side and gives nothing to me for support,  then my son will see him buy his girlfriend all these gifts and he will question his father which turns into a fight , and my son being dropped off sooner than expected , I see the resentment in his hurt eyes and when I say to him , well now you know why I am so mad at your dad, he will actually defend him , I dident understand why untill my mom said , he is apart of his dad and at his age its all about having a dad weither or not he gives money , to him its not the money its about love and being wanted ,dont worry in time he will see .  I am married and John takes care of everything , my son now sees this as he is older and maturing , we opened up an account for him 2 years ago and he has a good bit of money he saved , he came home yesterday and was so pissed off , I asked what was wrong , he said , mom I love my dad but he said when you get older your gonna take care of me right ? then he said to me , your right mom , he needs a job , he should be taking care of me not me taking care of him , so let this child have a solid foundation with you and as he gets older he will see everything for what it is and slow down and learn he is loved very much .|`|prqrQcd1aa	You take him in for psychological testing and get him some real help before he hurts someone or himself!

Either from the state or her?  Honestly, you can't let this kid walk all over you.  Or his mother.|`|hVVALFAPaa	That poor child needs someone who will love him. If you don't, who will?  His mom and dad sure don't.<br>  <br>  Get him some professional help. He spent his first 8 years dealing with his loser parents. That is bound to have affected him. <br>  <br>  Grow a backbone! If you don't feel up to it, get him to CPS now, so they can find someone to save this innocent. I would also suggest legal action to terminate bio-parents legal rights.|`|a1798f60963816ca5222947a24204fedaa	Must be tough on you.<br>  <br>  I guess you are the so called "man of the house"...<br>  <br>  I think you should take up that position and show them who is boss. Sometimes, the only way people will learn is when you take drastic measures....<br>  <br>  Gifted student? Send him to boarding school then. And spank that daughter of yours!|`|T9fek24eaa	I am gonna get a lot of thumbs down, but I would beat his a$$ straight... either that or his mother or father. I suppose if it was my grandchild that had no one else to depend on, I would have no other choice. I could not, with good conscious, let him go into state care. BUT I would definitely have some serious discipline going on... possibly military school (not playing, they still have them around.)|`|AdqaXEWYaa	Is this kid seeing any sort of therapist? Why not? He is having bvious issues with his parents beignt he way they are, and is acting out because he simply can. You got a long list of things you need to do either way. If you dont feel capable or willing to raise this kid, (and Im not judging you either way cause its not your job to raise any more kids) then turn him over to childrens services. They will need to have the parental info and will place him somewhere that will treat his problems and give him counciling and some good drugs to help him become less destructive. What they require from you depends on the state your in, but most likely just contact info. Rememer your the grandparents, so try to love the kid regardless. But this might be your best option. <br>  If you want to raise him, then get a lawyer and then work on getting custody asap. You can do a lot to help him being a blood relative, but if your footing the bill, its better to have custody from the court, even if its temporary. Get this kid to a therapist! He probably needs ridilin, maybe zoloft or xanax for his mood issues, and a nice nuetral enviroment to lean how to overcome his issues. He might not even be able to deal with his reality, becuase of the drug use from his mother. Your in a sticky mess, but dont do it alone. get help for him asap, in or out of your home. Love mans doing whats best, and admitting he is more then you can handle isnt a sign of weakness, it shows you know your limitations. Good luck,
Jk4wnsZwaa	If you two live in the same state and have a child together-you can't move away without his consent.  He can get the courts involved.  This is his right as a parent.  The only way to settle it is to get a lawyer and go to court for full custody.|`|PA7LOoQ9aa	i agree you need legal advise. each state has diff rules and laws for these things. i am in a divorce now and neither of us can take the kids out of state with out notifying the other, also if we were to move then wed have to go back to court and set up a new visitation rights meaning kids going for so long with the other parent. google new mexico's laws on child visitation if unmarried and moving to another state.|`|AiJeS6I1aa	Why do you need to give birth in New Mexico?  You should plan to give birth  in the state in which you plan to move... while the father has no rights (ie. before the baby is born).  He can not reasonably ask you to move after that and the courts wouldn't force you to move either.  And, breastfeed... Then the courts cannot order your child be away from you as long as you do this.  Perhaps the father will have lost interest once the appeal of a new baby is over.|`|cIuIKXX6aa	Here in Arkansas, if your baby is born out of wedlock the mother has all the rights. But it also depends on who has the baby with them at the time. I have gone through the same problem with my daughter and her father.|`|Wqhnkd0Saa	From what I know (I have been researching divorce/custody/etc...)  If the baby was born out of wedlock, the father has no rights until custody is determined.|`|ZcHzNX4Uaa	go to your court house and ask but since hes never really around then take your child with you since your doing it on your own anyway mostlikly he will get in trouble not you|`|kejoIbphaa	as the mother you have rights too,contact a lawyer|`|MUVdG9n1aa	Most states favor the mother. Also courts are not very inclined to take a brand-new baby away from its mother unless she is unfit (drug user, neglectful, abusive, has mental issues) especially if she is breastfeeding. However as the baby gets older it would be up to you to prove you are the better parent. Then you have to worry about shuttling your kid back and forth for the rest of its life which is hard on the kid. My two oldest kids are in Oregon and I am in Illinois and it is not fun for them or me. Unless he is totally useless I would say try your hardest to stay near each other. Tell him you are concerned that he will not be a consistent father. It is so hard to try and raise a kid with someone who you are having constant battles with. The courts will want both of you involved as long as you are positive influences on the baby. Think long and hard on this one. Good luck to you- I mean it.|`|lnsOJ3GBaa	It's hard to answer this with out knowing New Mexico Law. It's always possible that you could end up in a custody battle. However if he's really one of those who is only there when he wants to be then do you think he'll really follow you and fight for your baby. <br>  <br>  I'd move now if you plan to do so at all. But there are a few things you need to consider. Should this man be a part of his childs life. Is he a fit father? You made a child together and unless he's a horrible person your child deserves to have both parents. Make sure you're not making these decisions for selfish reasons. You can't think about yourself any longer you need to be sure that you making the best decision for your baby. Good Luck to you and God Bless.|`|yF9Z06ruaa	Move now and give birth in the state that you want to live in. Until that baby is born, you are free to do what you want.  If you are already living in the other state, you don't have to worry about being forced to move back after the baby is born. Also, go to family court and file for custody as soon as the baby is born. If you name the father on the birth certificate (which you have to do if you want child support) he will be served custody papers to come to court IN THE STATE THAT YOU LIVE IN. That will show if he is really serious about the baby because he will have to come to where you are for court. And if he doesn't show up, you get what you want by default.  And by the way, all that crap about breastfeeding, is not true in most cases.  My step-daughters mother still had to let my hubby have visitation for whole days, even though she was breastfeeding. As long as the dad is competent, most judges will either require the mother to supply breastmilk for the father, or the baby will have formula while with the father. Breastfeeding is not an excuse to keep a baby from his/her other parent.|`|4w9gmvumaa	Just breastfeed.  Then your baby can't be apart from you for more than an hour or two.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	My advice? Your the one in charge of who's name goes on the birth certificate, so if this is something you are truly worried about, don't add his name.<br>  <br>  I worry about this every damn day of my life to be honest with you.  I am a single mom, and my babies daddy live in texas with his wife and other girlfriend.  He left 2 days before I found out I was pregnant.  He knows about the baby, and every day I think about whether he would come and try to take her from me.  Some days, I worry so much about it that it makes me sick to my stomach.  A friend of mine on MY Space that is taking law classes tells me that I shouldn't worry so much because my name is the only one on the birth certificate.  I still worry though.  I can't help it.|`|FLpMShKNaa	he doesn't have to be your husband to have legal rights. He can attempt to establish paternity and assert his rights in court, and the law in most states favors joint custody. You need to get a lawyer to advise you and possibly represent you if a conflict arises-check your local bar to find one who works pro bono or on a sliding scale fee if money is an issue. Its a bigger issue than can be resolved on YA, and you truly need advice from a lawyer who practices in your jurisdiction.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I would advice your to get a lawyer and speak to them. I think the only issue is that if you are married the husband has rights. But if you can prove that you want to be near your family and YOU are the one that is more financially secure to have a child, then you keep the baby.|`|oojO4WAraa	You need to get a lawyer before the baby is born and have this worked out a head of time.  You have more right now, because the baby is inside you.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	if you just leave it's considered kidnapping. You can't just leave like that. Best thing to do is get a court order.|`|cr5TQgmUaa	He won't have rights until his name is on the birth certificate -- which you decide who the father is or until he proves through DNA that he is the father. Also you can't expect him to provide for the child unless you declare him the father.<br>  <br>  I really don't think he can decide where you live. You really need to get a lawyer.

hWc65sEtaa	I came from a family with 4 kids.  My older brother and sister were 15 months apart.  Five years later I was born, then one year to the day my younger brother was born.  I worked out great because my oldest two were very close with each other and me and my younger brother were close to each other.<br>  <br>  Now for me I have 3 daughters who I think is perfect for me because I had the oldest by herself for 4 years then had another one right when she started getting to that spoiled brat stage.  Two and a half years later I had another one.   <br>  <br>  They are spaces apart enough that they get along, but have different interests. Like right now, my oldest has graduated from high school, my second is a freshman, and my youngest is in 6th grade.|`|T48smu01aa	4 kids I think is a magic # I say that b/c 4 is perfect its not too many and it still is a big family I think they learn from each other....there is no middle child which sometimes can be a problem when kids get older they always say well I was the middle child and I was left out.....there are so many other reasons why 4 is good but I can't think of them all ha ha<br>  good luck on your decision!!|`|v0aKxF6iaa	Well logically i would say no more then how ever many children you think you could provide love, food, clothes and shelter for for at least 18 years.|`|e01ge0W6aa	The best number of children is what is best for your family. I personally have 4 and a step son. So we have five all together. Our children are spread out: 16, 14, 7, 5, and a 2 month old. Some people are happy with one child and some are happy with 18. It just depends on what is best with your family. I would keep an open mind and see how having 1 feels, then 2, 3, etc. You really don't have to decide on a final number right now. I think in your heart you will just know when your family is complete. Good luck.
a8c1ec2782f2cbb1944ac1b3fd537fa6aa	Totally normal, once you're through the first tri-mester you'll be able to enjoy the pregnancy. Buy a pregnancy book, or get one out at the library, or research pregnancy websites, there's plenty of info out there on what you can expect to feel and what's normal.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Unfortunately it is pretty normal. The first trimester is pretty rough for a lot of women. I had the same thing happen, it was terrible. For the nausea you can try to make sure you eat lots of small meals so the "tank is always full" and that will help a little bit. Make sure if you are nauseated and vomiting that you get enough fluids. If you get dehydrated that could cause more nausea and headaches, so drink as much water or juice as you can. Also, ginger or ginger ale works pretty well too. You can try soda crackers if you can't keep anything else down, but that's something that never worked well for me at all. For the headache you can try Tylenol and if that doesn't work, try a bit of caffeine, like one soda. My OB recommended that to me and it helped most of the time. Good luck, hope you feel better!|`|yOyg3gnJaa	Congratulations new mommy, you are in your first trimester with your baby, which is normally the most rough on the mom as far as hormones and morning sickness are concerned.  It should pass by the second trimester though, if you are lucky.  My first two pregnancies I felt terrible the whole time, now I'm 15 weeks pregnant with my third, and for once, I feel great!  Just relax, and remember your new bundle of joy is totally worth it!  Congratulations!|`|GZn5VNlSaa	Yeah, i have to say that was my worst week. I'm going on 10 weeks, and my symptoms, although still there, not nearly as bad as when i was at 8 weeks... hang in there!|`|wKuQC4yTaa	in the first trimester you can have all the above.  you should start to feel better near your 2nd trimester when your hormones are starting to level out a bit.|`|xpstigPTaa	Yes, all of the above is totally normal during early pregnancy. Best of luck!|`|AA11103493	For some people it is, and it can last 3 or 4 months (more for the really unfortunate amongst us).|`|JgdLShjeaa	oh i remember it well,i had little morning sickness with my first 2 but with my youngest, who is 20 months, i was terrible. i could not keep anything down, not even a ice cube i would suck it and then throw up. i had no energy, really bad head aches and just felt complete crap. in the end i was admitted into hospital on a drip, they let me out after 24 hrs.this lasted until i was around 16wks.<br>  although it was awful i would do it again tom.<br>  so just try n keep positive coz it will be worth it in the end.gudluck.|`|b3XSnPXBaa	Totally normal hun, I've been feeling rough since 8 weeks too, thats when it really kicked in, not actually been sick, just feel horrible, not able to eat or drink much with forcing myself, very tired and also the headaches.  Totally normal and should wear off soon.  Best of luck. x|`|d5fd9d057a20f9f41b37d39a5288a98faa	Oh yes honey, I was just at the end of my 8th week when morning sickness hit me hard! I am 14 weeks and still feel like crap in the mornings, but in a few weeks you should feel better. It all worth it though! If i have to, I will put up with morning sickness through the 40th week, but god forbid if that was to happen(knock on wood) LOL!!!|`|nISjD0dHaa	Very normal during early pregnancy. Some women on my fertility board have had their drs recommend 1/2 of a unisom and vitamin b6 to help with morning sickness.  You can take tylenol for the headaches also. I hope you start feeling better!|`|q3bsYh26aa	hey!<br>  Im 25 weeks pregnant and still feeling like ive been hit by a bus lol... im guessing that feeling crap is pretty normal and your allowed to take paracetomal for headaches duriing pregnancy... try getting some pregnacare tablets they replace the folic acid i found they help me feel loads better x|`|dR2bqUixaa	It happened to me. I'm 17 weeks now!

Cv2h6n1Raa	I haven't had any spotting yet but that is normal with many forms of birth control. I'm going on my third month using the nuva ring and I love it! I can just live my life and not have to worry about not taking my pill on time. Everyone I know is a slave to the once a day pill and mostly people don't take it at the same time every day. With the nuva ring, I can go on about my life, not having to worry about taking a daily pill and I know I'm fully protected. The Nuva Ring is like the best thing that has ever happened to me.<br>  Ha!Ha! I should make a commercial.|`|8gA2EWXfaa	i'm not on it, but my roommate is and she had those symptoms.  She likes Nuva Ring a lot!  I would search it online though.
AA10064551	That's always a scary though that we all go through, I think you will hear him, make sure you put him on his back or when you lay him on the side make sure that his little face is more raised so that he doesn't smother his nose in the blankets. and when your cover him with blankets only cover him half way. Oh and never put him on his tummy to sleep. its okay if he is napping and you are constantly watching but if it night time you should refrain from the tummy. My son is 6 months and we still don't let him sleep on his tummy. <br>  <br>  Other then that, you will hear your baby. Its a motherly instinct I was always afraid that I wouldn't hear my son but believe me I heard every squirm ever moan every sneeze every yawn. I wasn't trying to I just did. Its like my mind never let me go too deep into sleep.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Put him on his back.  Dress him warmly and don't use pillows or stuffed animals.  Do you have reason to think he actually might suffocate?  If there is a medical reason to think so, you can get a special monitor to use for him.  Ask your doctor.  <br>  <br>  If this is a case of first-time mother jitters, relax.  Everybody goes through this, and you'll both be fine.|`|MUVdG9n1aa	This is absolutely normal and you prob. won't ever fully relax- one of the hazards of being a parent. Just do the recommended things- don't put him on his tummy, cover him with big blankets or pillow and keep the room comfortable but not too warm. Check on him now again if you're panicky but don't get too nutty. Relax if you can and congrats on your beautiful baby!|`|0a0hlTlUaa	Babies generally save themselves from suffocating. Like they will move their heads or use their little hands to get away from anything which is trying to suffocate them and in doing so they will probably make some sound. So don't worry so much and sleep happily.|`|Wqhnkd0Saa	only if he gets startled and starts to cry...but it depends on what he's suffocating with.  plastic, yes, pillows/blankets/etc...probably not.|`|vEkn39wBaa	yea
rAD0mL7Saa	yes. get a nurse to measure your fundus with a measuring tape (pubus bone to top of uterus). A nurse will know what to feel for or find a midwife. about your stuffy nose, that's probably from drinking milk. In my first pregnancy I drank a fair bit first because I thought it was healthy then to medicate indigestion. Second pregnancy I drank herbal teas and got calcium from other sources and had no mucus and nearly no indigestion. And no leg cramps.|`|OU9xnW86aa	The only way to date is by your last period or by measurement (CRL=crown to rump length) on an ultrasound scan. Symptoms are no indicator of how far along you are. Your doctor is probably not wrong. But you will have to wait for your next scan to find out.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	I felt like this in both of my pregnancies i really think it is something in the mind bc i even told people i was farther along with my fist i gave birth at 35 weeks & he was the size of a 38 week but they said it was bc of my diabetics.. guess u really cant tell|`|sWWX615gaa	hi i saw a pregnancy test advertised on the telly its new on the market but it Also tells you how far along you are dont know how good it is or the name of it but it is digital if you ask in the chemist im sure they would know what you are on about|`|1mjrUKrraa	yes it is possible to get pregnant and still have periods. This is why many girls do not find out they are pregnant till much later on in pregnancy stages. So you may be correct.<br>  <br>  hope it helped good look with everything :)
AA11505640	A few days after I found out I was pregnant, I went to my parent's house for dinner.  My mom was making my favorite food...  barbeque ribs!  I got so sick by the smell that I had to stay outside the whole time.  I was able to have ribs again just a few months ago (over two years later)!  <br>  <br>  Zucchini was one of my favorite veggies, but it made me sick, too...|`|Jk4wnsZwaa	With my first pregnancy it was eggs-and now I still can't stand to eat them.  So far this pregnancy I haven't found what makes me gag yet...but I'm sure I will soon enough.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Popcorn, anything fried.|`|7amYzJtVaa	i hated chicken and all meat and rice|`|olKKT2LTaa	I couldn't even say the word Risotto. I also couldn't look at a butternut squash, as I used to put them in risottos. I loved it before, then it was on a Christmas menu as the vegetarian option (I'm veggie) and it just instantly put me off? Still haven't had it and my son is 7 months now. I used to like to chew bath sponges too...although not strictly food!|`|G2auAv1Saa	This time I have been unable to drink milk, it just makes me gag. When I was having morning sickness I couldn't stand seafood, but that is about all I want to eat now.|`|ITu6gONdaa	i basically have to force myself to eat any meat...chicken is the worst....ewww gross
wEc3XzExaa	my pregnancy was induced and it made contractions come on hard and strong. Way more painful than the delivery that wasn't. How many weeks are you and is it absolutly needed. Or is it just convenient? If it is not for medical wellness I urge you to just wait for the baby to come on his own terms. Also if you do get induced I highly suggest a epidural. Good luck and congrats|`|9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	You are normally advised to be induced if you reach 42 weeks with no signs of labour. This is because the placenta can show signs of deterioration after this time and that can put the baby's health at risk. You normally have the gel inserted late at night or early in the morning, this can start contractions in some women. Often though, you will be put onto a oxytocin drip as well which will start contractions if the gel hasn't worked on it's own. These can be swift and painful, so you will be offered an epidural if you need one. Don't worry too much, they will offer you as much pain relief as you need and you may go into labour naturally before next week anyway. Good luck!|`|hFQa24wOaa	they insert a medicine that is used to induce, like me, it did not cause birth, they had to break my water with a long needle like object with a hook on it.. it was little painfulm, but I think I was just tense|`|uj4W3jwnaa	i was induced back in July 08. on the Wednesday i went in and had the pessary tablet inserted into my cervix, then was left over night.<br>  Come Thursday morning nothing happened (it doesn't with everyone) so i went on to the next stage of induction which was having a long rod with a hook on the end inserted into my cervix to break my waters from the sac. <br>  Then , straight after i was taken to the delivery room where i was put on a drip to speed-en up the contractions. all in all i was in labour for 12 hours.<br>  bear in mind , being induced doesn't just stick to the pessary (considering it doesn't work). as said above, there is the rod to break your waters and the drip to speed-en contractions. It can be painful (it was for me with the pessary and the rod) especially at 7.30 in the morning when your not expecting it lol. But after labour, when you have your baby in your arms, all that wont matter, you'll forget it ever hurt you. Like i said it can hurt, but the pain isn't unbearable. you'll get through it fine, loads of women, every day, do!|`|115I5Polaa	I had that done, what they are going to put in you is called Cervidil.  I got the Cervidil inserted the night before I was induced to soften my cervix.  Then at 7:00 in the morning is when they started the pitocin.  at about 7:30 my doctor broke my water and it was on after that.  The pain got so intense and by 9:30 I had to get an epidural.  Finally after being in labor for 14 hours I had my beautiful daughter!  Im not trying to scare you but being induced sucked.  Good luck!|`|jBdvUQEXaa	Try to avoid it is my best advice! Let nature take it's course, the baby will come when it's good and ready.  Dont get me wrong I know how frustrating it is, but unless the cervix is favourable - ie soft and prepared for labour, then induction isnt a good idea. But, your cervix being favourable would indicate that labour isnt far off anyway.<br>  <br>  Its not fun, it is uncomfy to say the least to have the gels put in place, the contractions are harder and faster - especially once the drip is inplace which leads more women to ask for an epidural, which combined with the fact that neither the woman nor the baby is ready for labour leads to more and more sections.<br>  <br>  Please try and be patient! Enjoy the rest of your pregnancy, try gentle excersise, and sex is the best induction!<br>  <br>  Claire|`|eC1dQVcgaa	I do not believe being induced was 'more' painful, the reason i think people seem to think it is worse, is because you know you are going to have your baby, and you have more time to think about it. <br>  But if all of a sudden your waters go, and you are contracting, you do have time to think oh s**t this hurts.... <br>  Do you know what i mean?<br>  I was induced at 37 weeks, and would get induced again. =] <br>  Good luck with the labour, hope your baby arrives safely x|`|e01ge0W6aa	I have been induced with 3 of my pregnancies. With all three I was already dilated so I didn't need the gel. I was told if I wasn't dilated this would happen: I would check into the hospital in the evening and the cervadil gel would be placed in my vagina to dilate me. It may cause some cramping and may start labor. Around 5-6am, pitocin would start via IV. They start pitocin slowly and increase as your labor progresses. Pitocin contractions are worse than normal contractions, I will tell you that. My first two pregnancies I was induced and delivered within 12 hours with no pain meds.My water broke on its own. My third baby I delivered within 8 hours but used an epidural. Labor hurts regardless of what method you use. But in the end you get a beautiful baby and it is all worth it. <br>  Good luck.|`|AlxMp9l3aa	I had both my pregnancy's induced, due to high blood pressure, my labour was very long because i was induced for both my pregnancy'ss, a total of 2 days labour for my son and 2 and a half days for my daughter, the contractions wereirregularr but verypain fulll and very frequent so i could never get comfy from the 1st day so my blood pressure shot up even more resulting in me having epidural to try to keep my blood pressure down, I nearly had to have aCesareann with my son luckily ididn'tt have to but had to have aforcepsp delivery, my daughter was born by emergency cesarean after 2 and a half days of labour, everybody does react differently to being induced myFriendd was induced with her 1st baby and had her 1st baby 3hrs later naturally.  My cousin also was induced 24hrs later hey presto baby and it was naturally.<br>  <br>  it is harder being induced as your body is being forced to go into labour, but the doctors would only induce you if they had to either for health reasons or if the baby isdistressedd.<br>  <br>  The gel is inserted and then its a waiting game for the contractions sometimes they start within and hour or so, sometimes you have to have some more gel applied, If you have any concerns speak with your midwife on the day, and they will talk u through everything. GOOD LUCK!!!|`|HS6sFJPjaa	I just had my son two months ago and was supposed to be induced. I went to the hospital because I was not dilated at all and they insert a thing called cervidil. It looks like a tampon and is inserted the same way. They inserted it at 10pm (still not dilated), and it is not supposed to make you go into labor (I asked 3 times). By midnight I had intense cramps one on top of the other. The nurse came in at 2a.m. to check one of the monitors they have you wear and I told her I was in pain. She checked me again and I was 6 cm dilated, had my son at 2:56 a.m.  They told me I went into natural labor, but I think the cervidil must have helped!|`|jvJqmliBaa	i was induced and it was horrible! But what happened to me wont happen to you..I was hooked up to pitocin, which brings on your contractions, for a whole day and nothing happened except the labor pains..i didnt dialate or anything..so they told me to go home that morning and come back tonight and do it again...so i go back that night and in the morning i have to go through it all again for a whole day..turns out the babys to big (he was 9lbs 2ounces) and cant get through my hip bones. so i end up having a C section, lol...i wish they couldve told me that to begin with. But if i had to do it 100 times over i definitely would..Its more than worth the pain, Its a good pain...Dont be nervous just think of your baby that will be here soon:)  good luck|`|MzjbUX5eaa	I was induced with my 3rd child and I WILL NEVER DO IT AGAIN! I've already talked to my doctor about it with this pregnancy. I will NOT. It was aweful. It makes the contractions more intense and painful. If you can wait to go natural then do it. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|q3bsYh26aa	my friend wat totally terrified of this so she mixed brown sugar with hot water in an egg cup and drank it about 2hours later she was in labour x|`|Qa86SBQnaa	oh yes! i didnt have contractions that were painful until my water broke then all he** broke loose! it was very rough! goodluck alot of women are induced though!
uFrqC4Y2aa	My mom asked me when I was a teen and I told her the truth. She asked who and I told her that too.|`|LJHbP8Npaa	Personally, Im 17 and would never dream of telling my mum that I have had sex, never mind the amount of partners I have had!! I am able to sort out contraception for my self, and know about the consequences, so I don't really see the need to upset her. Maybe she would want to know, but its a personal matter i would like to keep to myself =]. My mum has always said though.. That if i ever need the pill or anything, just to tell her and she will get me it, and ask no questions etc. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, I have two friends who have both slept with a number of people, and tell their mothers EVERYTHING to do with their sex lives. They told them of their first sexual encounters, when they lost there virginity, when they have a knew sexual partner etc!! Even pregnancy or STD worries!!I think it just depends on how you have been brought up. I could never talk as openly with my parents, especially not at this age!!|`|uZTLlAH9aa	I'm not having sex, but I have fooled around with a guy before. (We were going out for 6 months at the time, we broke up though.) I regret it, too. But you can't change the past, eh?<br>  <br>  My mom found out after walking in on us. That wasn't fun...<br>  <br>  But I'd never in a million years tell my parents anything like that. I'm not stupid.|`|Jo8nlGVsaa	Yeah my parents know, they put me on the pill. However I only have one partner.|`|ZHhXQ0ebaa	im almost 16 and am still a virgin but if i was to i would tell my parents|`|GGH0HVdvaa	By the time I was 17, my mom had me put on birth control pills. She never asked and I never told her that I was having sex, she just assumed. She even said "I know how kids are" and left it at that. I guess she just wanted to make sure I was at least protected from pregnancy.
6xf1GfbUaa	I think it's cute, but as a nickname when he's a little boy. I think it would be too hilarious to get a resume with the name RANGER. lol..<br>  It's honestly a bad idea and please try to convince your husband otherwise.

This is the decade of Bridger, Brooklyn, Rebop, Rebel, Rocket and Rammington. All names I have seen more than once. So, if both of you are happy, why not. Just give baby a conservative middle name in case he decides later on he wants to be in business and would rather go by as R. William (middle name of your choice here) Smith (Your last name).|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I think its cute!|`|tSEA42Uraa	NO!<br>  <br>  For an R name, try:<br>  ~Reese / Reece / Rhys<br>  ~Raymond<br>  ~Reagan / Reegan<br>  ~Reed<br>  ~Remington<br>  ~Richard<br>  ~Ross<br>  ~Ryan<br>  ~Robert<br>  ~Roderick<br>  ~Russell <br>  <br>  My favorites are Reese / Reese / Rhys, Ryan, Robert, and Russell.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your husband!<br>  ~Emily-Maria|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	Puppy, YES.

That is more of a title - ( Forest ranger - Park ranger and  kids will make fun like - Lone ranger) <br>  <br>  Robert - (Bob)<br>  <br>  Richard - (Dick)<br>  <br>  Randall - (Randy)<br>  <br>  Why should his family tradition have anything to do with your family?<br>  <br>  They should not be running your and your husbands life.|`|BiMeb75Gaa	No, it reminds me of a park ranger. What about Riley or Robbie?|`|AA10826403	Ranger is horrible, sorry. It would be ok as a nick name, but he would teased so bad for Ranger as a first name. <br>  Here are some other names;<br>  Rick, Richard, Roy, Roland, Ronald, Ryan, Reese or Riley but please no RANGER.|`|AA11657825	I like it|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Your husband has watched too many episodes of Walker, Texas Ranger.  Naming your son Ranger will not mean that he will grow up to be a good guy that knows karate.  I personally think it is a lousy name.|`|cr5TQgmUaa	I like it!|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	nope|`|nkEEQtmEaa	If you want the kid to get his butt whipped by bullies, then yeah, name him Ranger. Ranger is a dog's name.  Sorry.  It's like "Scout" -- an ok nickname, but why put that on your child?|`|h5cFkP35aa	all i can think of is a park ranger and a Ford Ranger. go to babynames.com and look up names beginning with R. it's your choice too. good luck.|`|3AfQ9UXYaa	FOR THE LOVE OF GOD(and your son) DON'T DO IT!!!!!|`|yXGlmUqlaa	i would panic too<br>  <br>  why don't you search some websites for other unique(but not too unique) to suggest.|`|YNj2i2Inaa	If you're white trash, then go right ahead.<br>  <br>  If you're not, it's a terrible idea.|`|FsFUo4VJaa	Yeah that is a great name no on else will have it.|`|CTmWS6dMaa	No! It is very teasable.|`|pfisYml0aa	i like it, but then im a lord of the rings geek....so i might not be the best one to listen to, i would suggest a baby name website. maybe you can find one there that will satisfy both of you.|`|CjvXSZuXaa	yeah! it's really cute!|`|p1yIVINraa	It's cute and kinda quirky.  Ranger could have cool effects on the kid in High School, though the better question is does "Ranger" go with your last name?  Because something like "Ranger Smith" would sound awkward.|`|f95y2c3waa	Ranger... Seriously? Give him a normal name that he won't be mocked for, it's not fair on your child. What about Robert, Ralph, Raymond, Richard, Ross?|`|tnOZ49JQaa	I'm like you 50% of me likes it and 50% not. How about Ryan, Rylan, Rory, Reece, Reed?????|`|K45xwCxoaa	I DONT LIKE RANGER sounds very wierd, your son will hate you for giving him such a name|`|dDHtziQEaa	yeah!|`|bpLtUbssaa	If your not fully happy with it then just tell you husband....i don't want to name our son Ranger..|`|63ff74d8b74029f44c5d4403dc78e14aaa	If he wants the kid to be named after him how bout' Retard?|`|radg7M8maa	my honest opinion.. DONT DO IT!<br>  other options could be.. Ron? Rhody?Randy?Richard?
s4LWmcTjaa	Um, honestly?  I'd say find more age (and species) appropriate ways of discipline.  A spray bottle works for a dog, but I think that's a bit over the top for a human.<br>  <br>  Your kids are teens.  Try talking to them about acceptable and unacceptable behavior and then removal of a privilege.  Use a consequence that makes sense.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Lol. That's how I trained my cat not to jump on the counter.|`|1s3nddaYaa	if it works, my aunt said do that to bray, but he likes it so it doesn't work lol. they are getting older, so i think it might ear off soon.or they might think hey. this is an easy discipline.and take that rather then more harsher things|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	it'd be better if their names were shooty and misty, the two settings on the bottle|`|CxCigxZIaa	Never ever heard of this method. IF this works then go for it. :)|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	hey if it works why question it?|`|zH1sg3Xraa	I think that your son and daughter are too old to treat like this. Have you tried positive rewards for good behavior? I would read a book on positive rewarding for good behavior. I would throw the water bottle away. Oh! Put the water bottle under your kitchen sink. If there should be a dog or a cat fight in your front yard, spray the animals with the cold water. It will stop the animals from fighting.|`|PuVgZiddaa	come on lady i am happy in a way that it is working but you have basically 2 teenagers living with you i am shockingly surprised they do not laugh at you and find it as a joke.  but come on they are not pets this is usually a disciplinary action for a cat or dog but correct me if i am wrong.  but on the other hand i do not have kids so i guess i should not have too much of an opinion|`|qvuQSQvpaa	the dusty kid needs the water|`|cteyFJxhaa	Sorry to be negative but I can't help but wonder if you're really telling us about your kids.  I mean....they're kids not cats right?|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	Lol! Its a tame method of punishment, but if it works, then thats great!|`|AA11537580	you had me til you said their names are Dusty and Misty!!<br>  your too funny!<br>  water sprayed on cats to get them to behave|`|iWUAWkNNaa	They are a little to old for that don't you think? It's better than a beating.|`|JcwjDpY8aa	Of course they seem to react to it- they are 12 and 14 years old and their punishment is a quirt of water !<br>  If it works, wonderful.. but I would personally take an approach that is directed towards confronting the specific problem.  Maybe I would use this naughty bottle if they were ... say.. splashing water or spraying water on someone else.  I just don't see how a squirt on the hand will teach a child that it is wrong to use bad language, etc.|`|ufc2Sb3Oaa	What's the deal with all the "s" on the end of your question? Are you nuts? you must be if you believe in this kind of punishment. <br>  <br>  "Oh, you've been a bad boy, mommy is going to get you with the "naughty bottle." Then you'll learn something." <br>  <br>  I don't see how this is punishment. Have you spanked your kids? Hope not, since I consider this child abuse. There are other effective forms of punishment, and spraying them is not it. <br>  <br>  First of all, seek professional help, I would like to hear what a shrink says when you tell him/her how you discipline your kids. And then crack open a dictionary and learn to spell correctly.|`|PA7LOoQ9aa	iv only heard of this for dogs!!! but i would think they are the age that they can be grounded or have to sit in their room with no tv or games for 15 min if they cant mind. if its a huge action then take away things like that for a whole day. give them chores to do if they are already doing chores daily add to it when they misbehave.|`|0be940862a3c253f0432eb848850e14aaa	Reminds me of how you train a cat not to scratch the furniture, but it seems harmless. Your kids seem a little old for that kind of punishment though.|`|ptOoGjRvaa	is it wrongs to spray my sons with a squirted bottle?<br>  <br>  My son dusty is 14 and my daughter misty is 12.<br>  <br>  It doesn't look like you have sons, but a son and daughter. Dusty and Misty? Ok.|`|bSjbVxO2aa	Really? <br>  <br>  You spray your 14 and 12 year old children with a squirt bottle?<br>  <br>  Ugh. How disrepectful to your kids! Try talking to them like people and stop treating them like animals.|`|FKQvRZhXaa	nope. completely normal.|`|Jk4wnsZwaa	Its better than you smacking them in the face...I dont see anything wrong with it if it works!|`|yYGc1FNAaa	Its better than you smacking them in the face|`|LbJqU82waa	VERY MUCH SO, SO REPENT, FOR KINGDOM OF GOD IS AT HAND!|`|3I7pKdPlaa	its WAY better than hitting!<br>  so its good, keep doing it if it works.|`|WbYDLP0paa	hey it works it's all good|`|FSoNujAaaa	i think there a little to old to be getting sprayed

wFe7L1XJaa	Call your doctor and he or she may be able to prescribe you a anti nausea and vomiting medicine such as promethizine my doctor prescribed it to me and it works wonders until then make sure you drink lots of water and take your vitamines if you cant take prenatals buy flinstone chewables and take 2 a day they are alot easier on the stomach i hope you feel better|`|Q3x0yfmtaa	Do not take anything you haven't cleared with your doctor. As for calling, yes you should. They might prescribe you something to help with the morning sickness. Remember to stay hydrated, and eat WHATEVER you can. If it's just a candy bar, eat it. <br>  <br>  I lived on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, sour gummy worms, and coke slurpees through my first trimester. That's all I could eat. The baby gets first dibs on whatever you eat, so don't worry.|`|4d1d61e8ee76ab95bb8d2c7a9badfe1daa	ensure|`|IA5zVfk0aa	tums worked for me.. or call your dr. and ask for a prescribtion for nausea.. those work wonders! :) congrats!!|`|dNlCfhD2aa	Defiantly call your doctor before taking any meds. <br>   Many women are not able to keep much down in their 1st trimester so don't worry too much.  Women are usually the least nauseous at night so you could try taking your prenatal with food then. You will probably have better luck keeping it down.  Other then that if you are really concerned ask your doctor when you call abt the medicine question.  They should have plenty of suggestions for you.|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	Call your doctor.  Don't take any medications without asking your doctor first.  Pepto Bismal contains salicylate which is also in aspirin, and I don't think it is safe to take during pregnancy.  My doctor gave me a list of over the counter drugs that are safe to take.  Try drinking ginger ale and eating ginger cookies or saltine crackers.  Never take your prenatal vitamins on an empty stomach.|`|rAD0mL7Saa	eat a lot of high protein food and drink those drinks for patients in hospital on liquid diets. for me I felt sick until I ate and kept feeling sick until I had eaten enough, which as it turned out was a LOT.|`|mBfvthNaaa	Never, never take any medicine without checking with your doctor.  Sip on clear liquids (not sodas) and nibble on soda crackers.  If it's not better in a couple of days, check with your doctor.|`|2B2fgmw9aa	You can chew Tums, which helped me or you can ask your doctor for nausea medication. Just to be sure you are getting the nutrition you need, my doc suggested drinking Ensures when I couldn't eat.|`|C1blHL9vaa	Sucking on mints and chewing gum helped to settle my stomach a bit. The gingerale and crackers really did not help me. Hopefully it will resolve once you are done with your first trimester. I wouldn't take any medicines including pepto bismol.|`|nISjD0dHaa	Some of the ladies on my fertility board have had their drs recomment unisom 1/2 of one and b6 to help with morning sickness.  I would try that.  Good luck and I hope your morning sickness subsides|`|JQ8DgG3baa	7up soda and mcdonald's french fries.|`|cZUd6r3maa	My sister in law suffered from morning sickness through out her pregnancy.  Now I don't know if your nausea can be considered morning sickness or not.  When she had trouble holding food down, it seemed that fruits were easier for her to keep down.  Now if the nausea persists, I believe that calling your doctor shouldn't be a problem.  While it's better to be safe than sorry, don't let things get to the point where your paranoid.  Good luck, I wish you the best.|`|Jk4wnsZwaa	Don't take pepto-it has...aspirin in it I believe-my doctor told me not to take it whatsoever.  I tried everything to get rid of my morning sickness but nothing worked.  If you are really hurting-call your doc and ask for a prescription called Phenergan or the generic is Promethazine.  It works wonders!!!!  And the generic is fairly cheap-especially with insurance.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	DO NOT TAKE PEPTO BISMOL!!!!  You can take vitamin B6 25mg 3x a day which really helped with my morning sickness.  If you think you are losing weight you should call your dr.  Good luck!|`|paerqxfMaa	Do not take anything not prescribed by your doctor.  The morning sickness will probably pass soon enough - but you can try to nibble on saltine crackers - once the nausea has passed, you will able to eat normally again.  But talk to your Doc - that's what he's there for.

MgvYMfIWaa	i dont think your pregnant since you had 2 regular periods. some days people just feel like crap because their bodies are tired and worn out. you may have a uti if your peeing alot. if you think your pregnant though you should take a test but i doubt you are.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	I think that your probably not pregnant. I think your just worrying about it too much. If he didn't cu m inside the condom at all, your chances are pretty low, and besides you said you are on another kind of birth control too. If you are, then you should be pretty well protected. Don't worry, your not pregnant. good luck.|`|SLph9RX6aa	i doubt if you are, though it is possible, a bit of sperm comes out before ejaculation but for this to have made you pregnant it is highly highly unlikely|`|rdpZrBc9aa	You are probably fine, but take a test to be sure.  <br>  <br>  Remember the only 100% way to stay safe is to keep your pants zipped.|`|xpstigPTaa	I doubt you are pregnant if you had normal periods both January and February. I'm sure your fine but you need to take a test to be sure.|`|AA10196172	There is always a risk of sperm in prec*m. So it is not impossible. Very unlikely, but not impossible.<br>  <br>  Your symptoms could be anything.<br>  <br>  You can have what look like regular periods for 1 or more months when pregnant.

Ll39LhkLaa	I was exactly the same this weekend past - sooo sure I was pg, convinced myself every twinge was a sign - day 31 of cycle that never goes longer than 29 days - and BFN.  Spent all day convinced that not only was I infertile but probably menopausal (I just turned 30!)  <br>  AF turned up on day 32 in the morning.  I guess all the excitement about trying must have delayed Ovulation.  <br>  Big hugs and sympathy.  It'll come.  xx|`|fPmN2RQEaa	you have to wait till the moon is full or for some of you who are un balanced right now the new moon is yours.<br>  <br>  I am answering conseption questions, but you may be able to use some of this info.<br>  <br>  <br>  I had to fake it, as I wasn't ready to have another child yet. <br>  On another note, I still think the moon has everything to do with this.<br>  Put your zip code in this and go to Feeding Times tab.<br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.bigfishtackle.com/weather/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigfishtackle.com/weather/ind...</a><br>  <br>  Ok for some reason the site bigfishtackle.com is not working the way I am use to so some alternatives are. <br>  <br>  When the moon either is coming up in the east or setting in the west this is one-hour bite. Then when the moon is one hour before straight over-head to one hour past directly overhead is 2 hour with it at your feet 12 1/2 hours later is again 2-hour bite.<br>  <br>  <br>  Another is watch called Casio Pathfinder you must know your GMT Greenwich mean time, and longitude & Latitude ordinances to set the watch and must allow for DLS day light savings.<br>  <br>  There is what I call freak days women feel it as this occurs five days before the new and full moon for two consecutive days. <br>  <br>  See if it is accurate for the times, you both wake up unassisted, eat, fall asleep and get busy.<br>  You will be amassed; but know that I have found there to be a half hour in between each set of times. The minor is good for 1 hour and the major is good for 2 hours being the time shown is the start time.<br>  <br>  Not to gross you out or anything, so on a personal note; we wanted to have a boy so here is what I believe. When we would go at it; I considered the first shot to be the girls as our first-born was a girl and I remember how it went in detail that time. <br>  <br>  So I figured then the second shot must be boys as for me girls on the left and boys on the right so, I would do the deed and pull out then after about 10 min. go again so as to say cleaning house and the second time was the charm. Within 5 weeks, we knew. He is now four years old and I would not have changed a thing. As by following the So-lunar schedule, I could tell when he wanted to eat and fall asleep or when he would wake up. Then we would go fishing every time he say’s he's hungry as first the little ones come in then the big ones then it repeats one more time usually I will catch upwards of 16 fish at a time UFB.<br>  <br>  Of course, you should consult the doctor what is going or try the other. Read through the other site listed and search for others, but use the first one to save you money on a So lunar schedule.|`|wnQRhfczaa	I completely get this. I was feeling the same way. The trouble is that while it doesn't show you can't help wondering if the test was wrong and you somehow are pregnant. Why do our bodies allow us to get our hopes up so much?|`|yVKErBVCaa	I feel ya!

pNKBszseaa	Im going to probably get alot of thumbs down, but i did do it, and really had no complications from it. other then having to use the restroom. I took 2 tablespoons full in orange soda, at about 5:30 pm on friday night. Nothing was happening by 9 other then going to the bathroom. I decided it must not be time. so i went to bed about 10. at 11:15 i was up peeing, 1125 i was peeing again 1135 i had the urge again..follow where im going with this? It wasn't that i had to pee i was having contractions. I drove my self to the hospital. Hubby told me to go back to bed that it was in my head. At 6:53 am we welcomed our first daughter. I didn't have any complication tho i have read that there could be many. Would i do it again? Maybe but with my second baby i didn't have a choice she came almost 8 weeks early. Good luck!|`|O97ZoHGXaa	my grandma did...  baaaad idea!!!<br>  wait until he/she is ready|`|iqz2tYEBaa	I would definitely stay away from it.  It causes diarrhea and the intestinal cramps can sometimes bring on labor.  But labor is not a good idea if you are dehydrated from sitting on the toilet all day long.  If you are past 36 weeks and are really trying to get the baby out, I would recommend evening primrose oil caplets that you insert vaginally.  Or try drinking red raspberry leaf tea.  But on the best ways is to have good old fashioned sex.  Hubby's sperm contains prostaglandins which help to soften the cervix.|`|4277201b67af194037740747ba2be513aa	It is dangerous to do this.

It may make you go into labor when the baby isn't ready. Try sex, walking, and squats it helps the baby in more of a natural way. The way Caster oil works is it makes your bowels empty and contract.|`|115I5Polaa	My cousin tried it and it gave her braxton hicks contractions but didn't induce labor.  She said that it wasn't worth it, I guess it tasted awful!|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	First I will tell you my experience then I will tell you my friends.<br>  <br>   I took it at 39 weeks 5 days. After about 4 hours I had to lay down. I felt weird and sick. I had the biggest poop I ever had in my life, and my contractions started. I went to the hospital at 9pm and they admitted me.  The contractions wore off at about 4 in the morning so they needed to induce me at that point. Would I do it again? Probably not, knowing the risks. It can cause the baby to have a bowel movement in the womb.<br>  <br>  My girlfriend took it and she had the craps alll day long. She said it was the most painful horrible thing she has done. <br>  <br>  I know you want this baby out hun, but really let it be.|`|q3bsYh26aa	Id keep away from it hun my friend and i tried everything to start her off but castor oil was not one it can cause damage to the baby im guessing baby will come when ready but try mixing brown sugar with hot water we did that for my friend and 2hours later her labour started so maybe it works x|`|jrOISaj4aa	I heard it can give you Braxton Hicks, nausea and bad diarrhea, NOT my cup of tea, being as miserable as I am already :)
1m7eGZdeaa	yeah you could be pregnant but a lot of those symptoms are pregnancy symptoms but they don't happen until later on. the only thing that really happens in the first trimester is increased discharge and if your unlucky morning sickness.. every woman is different and so is every pregnancy but the being gassy, peeing on your self doesnt happen until the baby has grown to where he or she has no room to move. <- ( the third trimester )|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Well, I had similar symptoms and was in fact pregnant. If these symptoms are different for you than what you would normally get, then maybe you are too, it's hard to say. Good luck to you!|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Well, its always hard to know for sure, because pms and pregnancy symptoms are so alike, but I'll tell you my experience. Around the time I was expecting my period, I was so sure that it was coming, because I had all of the usual pms symptoms, maybe just a little more mild than usual. I had cramping, breast tenderness, very tired. and also I had alot of this white discharge stuff that kept flowing out of me. I kept thinking I felt blood running, like I was finally getting my period, but then I would check and it wasn't. It was just more white gunk. lol. anyway, I still didn't get my period, and then I ended up testing and I turned out to be pregnant. I was so surprised. So, you never know. good luck to you.|`|h5cFkP35aa	i went through the same thing for years with the same thing occurring - negative pregnancy tests. it ended up being a hormone deficiency and i had to lose 50 lbs, but some people just need a pill. most likely you need to go to an ob/gyn or fertility expert and ask for simple blood tests. and yes pms and pregnancy symptoms are very alike. they tricked me many times. good luck.

TQYaNGdSaa	1. Have a History<br>  Do twins run in your family? If you have a mother, brother, sister, uncle or long lost cousin with multiples, you may wonder if you'll have them too. Sometimes twinning is hereditary, it's true. However, only fraternal (dizygotic twins are influenced by heredity, and then only in some cases. If your mother or maternal grandmother was or had fraternal twins, you might have inherited a gene for hyperovulation, increasing your chances of conceiving twins also.<br>  More: All in the Family<br>  2. Grow or Gain Weight<br>  A recent study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology correlates the rise in multiple birth rates with rising rates of obesity. Research found that mothers with a BMI (Body Mass Index) of 30 or higer were significantly more likely to have twins. Again, this statistic only holds true for fraternal (dizygotic) twins. The research also showed that women of above-average height were also more likely to have multiples.<br>  More: Weighing In<br>  3. Grow Up: Wait Until You're Older<br>  Older mothers are more likely to conceive twins than their younger counterparts. It's thought that the body accelerates ovulation as the biological clock starts ticking faster. Seventeen percent of mothers over age 45 have multiples. Wait five more years and the odds rise to one in nine! However, the risks also increase; older mothers have a higher rate of miscarriage and are more likely to experience problems such as gestational diabetes during their pregnancy; in addition, their babies are at higher risk for chromosomal abnormalities.<br>  4. Have More Twins<br>  Once you have had a multiple pregnancy, you are significantly more likely to conceive -- and deliver -- twins again! Some estimates suggest that mothers of twins are four times more likely to have twins again than a woman who has never been pregnant, or who only had a singleton. <br>  More: Multiple Multiples<br>  5. Diet: Yams & Dairy <br>  No one is quite sure why, but the Yoruba tribe in West Africa has the highest rate of twinning in the world. A study concluded that the mother's diet was the cause, being high in cassava, a type of yam or sweet potato. The peelings of this vegetable are thought to contain a chemical that causes hyperovulation. In addition, a 2006 study found that women who consume dairy are five times as likely to have twins.<br>  More: Don't Be a Vegan<br>  6. Seek Fertility Assistance<br>  Reproductive technology has dramatically increased the multiple birth rate. Drugs that stimualate ovulation can lead to a multiple pregnancy, but multiples can also result from invitro fertilization. It's not just that multiple embryos are implanted in the mother, but there is also an unexplained increase in the number of monozygotic twins among IVF patients. No ethical doctor would provide treatment if it wasn't warranted, so fertility assistance should only be sought out when necessary.<br>  More: Taking Clomid<br>  7. Have A Big Family<br>  The more kids you have, the more likely you are to conceive twins in a subsequent pregnancy. No one knows the magic limit that triggers a multiple pregnancy, so you'll just have to keep trying until it happens.<br>  8. Conceive While Breastfeeding<br>  Most people think that you can't get pregnant while breastfeeding, that the process of lactating keeps a woman from ovulating. However, plenty of mothers of twins can disprove that theory. Some research has supported the theory that the chance of twins or multiples is increased if a woman conceives while breastfeeding.<br>  More: Breastfeeding Leads to Babies<br>  9. Get Pregnant On the Pill<br>  Birth control pills are usually thought to be 99.9 percent effective at preventing pregnancy. However, that .01 percent often results in a double whammy -- multiples. Sometimes pregnancy occurs when the pill isn't taken consistently; in other cases, the hormonal mix of a particular drug type simply doesn't provide enough coverage to completely prevent ovulation. In either case, playing around with hormones can lead to hyperovulation, increasing the chances of multiples.<br>  More: Pregnancy After the Pill<br>  10. Just Get Lucky!<br>  Many parents of multiples don't meet any of the classic criteria, yet find themselves doubly blessed. Monozygotic twins are particularly mysterious; no one is exactly certain what causes an egg to split after conception, producing identical twins. The bottom line is that there truly isn't a whole lot an individual can do to influence their chances of having twins; sometimes you just get lucky!|`|tg89r7ZJaa	okay in your last question you were asking how to get pregnant by a man really how old are you because i think your really young and don't really need to be knowing these kinds of thing and you just cant say "hay i want to have twins" it doesn't work like that you have to have like a family history and stuff like that!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Be a twin.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	twin must run on female side & the odds are up to god unless u go to fertility clinic|`|yYGc1FNAaa	?|`|CKnHMYHnaa	It's out of your hands.
