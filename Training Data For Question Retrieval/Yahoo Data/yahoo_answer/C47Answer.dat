El régimen  de Irán proporciona apoyo financiero, logístico y militar a sus grupos. Si continuan con su desarrollo atómico podrían tener una bomba atómica quizá en menos de un a?o, lo cual sería un peligro para la humanidad, sobre todo para Israel, ya que su presidente ha afirmado publicamente que esa nación debía ser borrada del mapa, y además ha negado al holocausto judío, una verdad histórica comprobada. Algunos dicen que no usarían una bomba atómica porque recibirían otra como respuesta, basándose en la teoría del "terror mutuamente asegurado", esto no es aplicable a fanáticos fundamentalistas que creen que al morir por la hijad conquistarán el paraiso, ellos no temen la muerte, solo la consideran el traspaso a una vida mejor cuando la misma se produce en su lucha por el triunfo del Islam. Hay informacíones que indican que en 1997 el régimen pagó más de 270 millones de dólares a los grupos terroristas que tenía en el extranjero. En mi país, Argentina, los datos apuntan a Iran como máximo responsable del atentando a la mutual judía AMIA. Creo que la guerra contra el terrorismo no debe terminar en Afganistan o Irak, incluso creo que antes que esos 2 paises se debería haber intervenido en Irán, que es mucho más peligroso de lo que erán los otros 2.

lpi9jiabaa	Hola wapisima!<br>  Estoy seguro que cuando el bebe esta en el vientre materno tiene capacidad para oir y por tanto escuchar. Ademas las ondas se distribuyen aun mejor en un medio liquido como es el que tiene el feto, que en un medio gaseoso como es la atmosfera. Dicen que el beb reconoce de inmediato el latido del corazon de su madre nada mas nacer. Por tanto primero OIDO.<br>  Luego, tambien en el vientre materno se reconoce los pies, y las manos mientras esta en posicion fetal con el TACTO.<br>  En cuanto toma su primera teta que es el calostro se pondra en marcha el sentido del GUSTO. Pronto empezara a elegir: esta leche me gusta y aquella no.<br>  Muy cerca de descubrir el sentido del gusto estará el descubrimiento del sentido del OLFATO. Pero yo creo que es posterior al gusto de lo contrario los bebes no aceptarian tomarse un potito, que huelen fatal los pobres, pero se los toman. Además cuando hacen sus necesidades somos los padres los que reconocemos el mal olor. Ellos notan antes la irritacion que se puede generar en las mucosas que la peste de sus excrementos.<br>  Finalmente vendra el sentido de la VISTA con distincion de colores.

3nzqclQBaa	Mi querido Cicuta!<br>    Muy interesante pregunta y muy actual, pienso que en un mundo cada día más globalizado a las personas le da temor perder su identidad, su individualismo y su capacidad para autogestionarse, que son  factores que psicológicamente hablando son necesarios dentro de cada quien para tener presentes quienes son y de donde son. Cuando uno ve o siente que se pierde su individualidad entre tanta cosas, la primera reacción es precisamente aferrarse a ella y que mejor forma que autogestionándose, siendo autónomos, así que para mi el principal motivo el psicológico y luego de ordenen económico, culturales y así sucesivamente..<br>  <br>     Besos|`|07a5119c0a056f8da5b864ddffad048baa	Yo creo que el pedido de autonomías en el mundo viene porque la lógica de un Estado central ya no abastece en esta época posmoderna, los motivos son varios, económicos porque un estado descentralizado implica que cada región maneje un mayor porcentaje de los recursos que aporta al Estado, culturales porque el Estado ha creado un homogeneización que es contrario a la lógica de la identidad en la actualidad, el respeto al idioma y a las costumbres por ejemplo, sociales porque evidentemente dentro de los diversos contextos es una lucha por el control hegemónico de algo y por ver que proyecto queda en vigencia, lo racial y religioso me parece que no son preponderantes.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Pues que yo sepa mi querido Cicuta, las autonomías culturales nunca han logrado tener cabida en México.

No es lo mismo la cultura de un esquimal que la de un ecuatoriano.<br>  Por supuesto que hay cuestiones raciales por la inmigracion que hay cuando no hay oportunidades en sus lugares de origen por la situacion economica tambien globalizada , Economias multimillonarias como la de Estados Unidos y economias pobrisimas como la de Haiti.<br>  Tambien la cuestion religiosa influye de manera significativa , la religion musulmana en medio oriente condena todo a aquel que no es Mahometano. Y todo influye pero todo es parte de la salsa que esta viviendo el mundo hoy en dia.

Al final resulta que gente de derechas e izquierdas que siempre se discuten entre ellos acabarán por ponerse de acuerdo en contra de YR...<br>  Muy buenas preguntas nos planteas Burton... Yo creo que es fácil de decir lo que debería ser pero no lo es tanto intentar ponerlo en práctica. Aunque también me parece obvio que la cosa no puede seguir así y algo hay que hacer. Quizás el problema está en que como que YR no puede dar al abasto para controlar convenientemente todo lo que aparece, ha establecido unos automatismos que al final provocan muchas injusticias y incluso abusos por parte de algunos usuarios. Dada la masificación de YR, yo creo que es muy difícil establecer unos mecanismos de control que sean efectivos sin cometer injusticias... Pero bueno, nosotros como usuarios tenemos el deber moral de exigir a YR un mejor y más justo servicio y de momento yo pondré mi granito de arena no conectándome el día 30. Aunque también creo que como que es probable que la huelga no tenga mucha repercusión (aunque mucha gente no se conecte a YR ese día seguramente a ellos les importará tres pepinos) yo creo que habría que ir pensando en otras medidas de protesta para después del día 30. Yo tengo una idea pero de momento me la guardo para mí porque es un poco drástica (si a alguien le interesa puede mandarme un mensajito y se lo cuento pero de momento me callo).<br>  También me parece muy interesante la cuestión de que si YR gana dinero con esto. Si no aparece publicidad de donde sale el dinero? Es quizás esto algún tipo de experimento?

O sea, que como siempre,en Espa?a, quienes ganan son el rey de bastos de cerebro de plastilina.Es que no hay quien lo cambie.Saludos, y mi solidaridad a los amigos como tomata, que por cierto, sigue a lo tuyo, y mándalos al caraj.o.Besos.|`|xFeiUq1Baa	lo primero es q no entiendo la manera de censurar, quien es la cabeza pensante,pq hay muchas preguntas parecidas y a ella la censuran.<br>  me imagino q con cualquier pagina web y usuarios conectados a tu pagina ganas un minimo como cuando ves la tele q no es q le pagemos al canal pero tienen mas audiencia...<br>  q si seguimos asi voy a ir a saco para q me empiecen a censurar y por lo menos me divierto jejejej q trabajen!|`|UdniDRdzaa	yo tambien pienso que este sistema de reportes es injusto y arbitrario, y nos afecta a personas de todo tipo, condicion y pensamiento. Se sufre especialmente cuando un grupo de usuarios se organiza y se ceba en el reporte sin haber motivos para ello. Al mismo tiempo se permiten preguntas y respuestas con contenidos violentos, xenofobos, racistas, se permite la apologia de la mentira y de la violencia. Desde luego esta claro que el sistema actual no funciona y da amparo a comportamientos intolerantes. El reporte automatico es una bazofia, y lo de los deditos deberia ser eliminado o sugiero que solo se puedan poner positivos.<br>  Creo que Yahoo respuestas tiene que evolucionar porque hay mucha mierda revuelta dentro. Tambien tengo que decir que entre tanta bazofia me he encontrado , poco pero bueno, en todo el espectro opiniones y un nivel critico e intelectual bastante sorprendente positivamente.

Yo personalente te puedo decir que es la primera vez que veo en Madrid al termómetro alcanzar los 18o C en Enero. Estos dias hace un sol que no es normal, por ejemplo.<br>  <br>  Existen 3 posibilidades:<br>  El problema es que se le ha dado mucho bombo a las emisiones de CO2 y los gases "efecto invernadero", porqque la verdad sea dicha, esa era la explicación más plausible. Puede ser, que el calentamiento global sea un proceso natural y los gases contaminantes contribuyan a la aceleración de dicho proceso. La tercera opción es que el cambio climático se deba única y exclusivamente a causas "naturales", las claciaciones por ejemplo fiueron cambios climáticos naturales.queda casi descartado que el calentamiento global ea un invento propagandístico.<br>  <br>  Hay varias teorías que intentan explicar las causas naturales del calentamiento global, la mas interesante es la del cambio en la actividad solar, otras se basan en variaciones de la órbita terrestre o en ciclos climáticos, ahi te las dejo:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calentamiento_global" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calentamien...</a><br>  <br>  Hay una teoría que predice una nueva glaciación si el deshielo de los polos fuese excesivo, ya que el aumento de agua y la bajada de la salinidad en los oceanos alterarían la corriente del golfo, que es cálida y la que evita que el heisferio n no se congele, asi que tras el calentamiento habría otra glciación, esto me parece muy catastrófico, pero muchos científicos consideran esa posibilidad.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.opinionpress.com/articles-2863.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.opinionpress.com/articles-286...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://ram.meteored.com/numero19/efectoartico.asp" rel="nofollow">http://ram.meteored.com/numero19/efectoa...</a><br>  <br>  Bueno, esta última es un poco heterodoxa, pero es buenísima, a lo ejor tienen razón, jajajaa!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.frikipedia.es/friki/Calentamiento_global" rel="nofollow">http://www.frikipedia.es/friki/Calentami...</a><br>  <br>  La verdad es que el cambio clim′tico hoy por hoy es un misterio, estuvo bien el documental.

De cada tres dólares que le ingresan al país, dos salen debido a las necesidades de importación y pagos externos. El a?o pasado se llegó a la cifra récord de 44.000 millones de dólares de importaciones. La inversión extranjera desapareció hace tiempo. <br>  El total de la deuda, tanto interna como externa, suma 110.000 millones de dólares, lo cual significa un aumento de tres veces lo adeudado en 1999. Ello a pesar de los 450.000 millones de dólares que le han ingresado en el mismo período por exportaciones petroleras y de que el recaudo tributario ha aumentado 25 veces. <br>  El déficit fiscal proyectado para el 2008 es de 10.000 millones de dólares. El servicio de la deuda pública para este a?o se calcula en 9.000 millones de dólares, superando el presupuesto de salud o educación.<br>  <br>  A pesar de los precios controlados y de las estadísticas poco confiables, la inflación llegó el a?o pasado a 22,5 por ciento y para este a?o se proyecta en 30 por ciento, como mínimo. Con ello, el Bolívar fuerte muere. <br>  <br>  Para palear el desabastecimiento se ha tenido que iniciar el incremento precios como el de la leche, y ya se dice que en los primeros 19 días del a?o la inflación va por el 5 por ciento. Más del 60 por ciento de los productos de consumo básico se importan.<br>  En fin, la lista es larga. De ahí la desesperación y peligrosidad del ?caudillo?. Lo que hay que buscar es el puente o fórmula de transición basada en la traición de Chávez en su insanía mental a los objetivos iniciales del chavismo y a la vez tranquilizar y motivar a la institucionalidad castrense. Para ello, el ex ministro de defensa y general retirado, Raúl Baduel, podría ser esa solución temporal. Si la oposición tiene la inteligencia para reconocerlo. <br>  <br>  Al pueblo Venezolano, repetirle que Chávez, como último acto irracional, está importando la guerrilla con sus secuelas de barbarie y narcotráfico.

NFzHYFAGaa	Después de leer tu comentario, me han surgido varias preguntas a mi que pienso que deberías hacerte. En primer lugar, que otras opciones políticas tiene realmente Espa?a? La de los Verdes? la de Izquierda Unida (o Partido Comunista que viene a ser lo mismo)? la de la Derecha Extrema? Es que en las elecciones generales, existe este bipartidismo claro, porque realmente no existe más oposición que esa. Deberías entender que aunque tengan más libertad otros partidos, no convendría un cambio a radicalismos extremos, y tienen que velar por la mayoría de los ciudadanos. Me parece loable, sin embargo que te gustaría que cambiaran el voto, pero por suerte o desgracia (para algunos), eso no va a pasar. <br>  <br>  Acto seguido te contesto a las preguntas planteadas. No es posible plantearse un cambio, la política en este país, tendría que ser caótica para que asi fuera, y realmente no es así, no suceden en países como Italia, donde el desorden político está a la orden del día, menos sucederá en Espa?a. No es la publicidad fácil, es la ideología de la gente y en eso no puedes cambiarlos sin motivos realmente de peso, y de momento las alternativas a las dos partidos, no existe, como si existió el CDS, en su momento. Realmente, el panorama político es básicamente siempre el mismo, y al ser un estado democrático, dudo que cambie, siempre estarán pendientes de hacer reformas, pero no como los radicalistas de ambos ideologías (vease, comunistas,extrema-derecha) que solo harían ensuciar a este país con tales ideas radicales y sin sentido. <br>  <br>  Espero que comprendas mi respuesta. <br>  <br>  Saludos<br>  <br>  ?

Pero hay algo que no veo bien y es la falta de respeto de algunos de comunidades castellanoparlantes hacia las lenguas de otras comunidades que tienen tanto valor o mas que el castellano para ellos. Un ejemplo: no es la primera vez que en Fallas hemos tenido que oir a gente que viene de otras autonomias quejarse y de forma algo despota porque los carteles explicativos de las Fallas se escriben desde siempre en valenciano. La misma actitud despectiva y prepotente he visto cuando hemos coincidido en el extrajero un grupo de espa?oles y entre catalanes o entre valencianos hemos utilizado nuestra lengua. No es una afrenta hablar nuestra lengua es solo expresarnos con la lengua que nos hablaron nuestros padres y abuelos. No me gusta la politica lingüistica que se hace en catalu?a pero tampoco la intolerancia y falta de respeto de los castellanoparlantes hacia los que tenemos otra lengua tan viva y tan nuestra  o mas que el castellano.

Parece una utopía el que las sociedades lleguen algún día a ser dignamente representadas. Por estas fechas, los ciudadanos se han convertido en una simple pieza estratégica dentro del tablero de unos rufianes que tienen gusto por los juegos de poder, y tal parece que no hay una fuerza que logre homologar un interés digno para los pueblos gobernados. Hoy tenemos a terroristas orquestando celadas contra otros terroristas, tenemos serviles esclavos al servicio de los especialistas en acumular riqueza para su propio beneficio y beneplácito, cuya fuente siempre es la sangre de las naciones. Tenemos radicales que como polos opuestos, se empecinan en tener una visión totalitaria del mundo, antes que comprenderlo como un crisol de culturas, del que todas son merecedores del bien común. Tenemos extra?os espejismos, brillos distorsionados que se filtran entre los objetivos de las cámaras y se traducen a conveniencia por medio del doblaje televisivo, y una contradicción aterradora entre la realidad y lo que nos quieren mostrar, en flagrante contradicción con la evolución tecnológica más avanzada de la historia de la humanidad. En resumidas cuentas, todo un circo de patéticos títeres y titiriteros, corriendo de un extremo a otro como en un desesperado acto de confusión. Ojalá y llegue el día en que nosotros, los únicos y verdaderos representantes de las naciones, tengamos la facultad de entendernos y así colaborar por el bien de nuestras naciones y de nuestros semejantes.<br>  <br>  Esto, amiga mía, es más grave de lo que parece, pues no es culpa exclusiva de Chávez, o de Bush. o de Castro o de las FARC, o de nadie, excepto de nuestra primitiva forma de enfrentarnos a nuestra naturaleza, a todas luces tan torpe, egoísta y rapaz.<br>  <br>  Un abrazo.<br>  =)|`|SrJi1hEEaa	jajaja tienes toda la razon|`|ec3c08cc66bb73e20026d856e1c68e03aa	JA, JA!!, y tal y como dice TKATCHEN, amenaza con sus tanquecitos y avioncitos marca "ACME", que seguramente le explotarán en las manos o en la cara.<br>  Lástima que no existan los abismos donde cae el coyote a cada rato, la huella que dejaría Mico Mandante venezolano sería bastante más ancha y profunda, no se diga la polvareda.<br>  Que nuevas trampas estará preparando este personaje realmente digno de caricatura de mal gusto?, no sé, lo cierto y  lo bueno es que siempre se le revierten.|`|fb66530508760e7eab5d93c3468d6c6daa	Es cierto pero no se puede tomar a broma porque siempre hay personas que sufren con sus arrebatos, no es solo Chavez, deberían luchar por hacer mejores naciones, con personas que todos los días tengan qué comer, con trabajos dignos y remunerados adecuadamente, con sanidad  para todos... eso es lo que debería preocuparles, solo parece que tienen ganas de luchar y guerrear, lo malo es que ellos dirigen la orquesta desde sus sillones y los que morimos, al final, somos el pueblo.

No, no serviria de nada, si tu economía depende de la de ellos a tí te conviene que la de ellos funcione y se active para que la tuya no se vea afectada. Sí el nacionalismo o un rencor especial te invita a sentir algo en contra de ellos, creeme que la gente decente y educada de E.U. no son ni por mucho el tipo de personas que representan sus politicos ni sus empresarios, al menos no todos. es gente que le gusta el trabajo y que espera vivir bien y en paz a base de su esfuerzo , amen de que allá si se reconoce a las personas trabajadoras y se dan oportunidades a quienes quieren pueden y tienen talento. cosa que en muchos países de latinoamerica no ocurre. Ahora por que te interesa da?ar la economía de los E. U.? que se ganaría? otro país despues de ellos asumiría el mismo roll y tu moririas de viejo y otra u otras potencias seguirian en el mismo tenor. lo que se debe hacer es eficientar y maximizar las potencialidades de tu población y de tu país, por medio de organizaciones o asociaciones que hagan trabajo efectivo y no palabras. creo que ahí radicaria un cambio a favor nuestro sin perjudicarles a ellos o hecharnoslos en cima.

gDxlJJYraa	Los derechos de la mujer no están circunscriptos a países sino a culturas.<br>  Si bien en occidente han conseguido logros en lo social, laboral, y lo que es más importante, en su condición de género, también existe una fuerte tendencia a ver a la mujer como un estereotipo de placer u objeto de consumo.<br>  <br>  Con respecto a Medio Oriente, el rey de Arabia acaba de ¨perdonar¨ a una mujer que fue violada, fijate el concepto de justicia y desigualdad.<br>  En Israel también existen serios problemas con los ortodoxos y no pocas militantes feministas han sido agredidas. De hecho, una mujer judía no puede recibir ense?anzas del Talmud de parte de un hombre, sino que lo debe estudiar sola si así lo quiere, pero tiene obligación de saber pelear como un hombre.<br>  <br>  Igualmente considero que las mujeres más castigadas por su condición se encuentran en países musulmanes integristas, y de hecho, cualquier radicalización religiosa de la religión que sea, atenta contra los derechos a la igualdad de la mujer.|`|c76b6e4d1c7990ce6965cbf6c9afe695aa	no estoy muy versada, pero creo que aqui en america latina las muejeres tenemos muchas libertades, aunque quizá los paises no tengan la mas especifica legislatura o seguridad legal.|`|gRh9mSppaa	Hola amigo, eso depende de las leyes que cada pais promueva en pro de la mujer.

Saludos.|`|zi9mCPUhaa	Estoy en general con lo que dice Maldita Bestia. Solo agregaría como dato anegdotico que Argentina, luego de Ruanda, Suecia y otro pais mas que no recuerdo cual es son de los países que mas mujeres tienen acceso a la función pública. (Argentina es el 4o país en tal sentido) . Ello se debe a leyes que obligan a la participación femenina (Ley llamada de Cupos) en los cargos políticos gravitantes. Con la mujer en el poder, un gran abanico de posibilidades de que sus derechos esten mejor garantizados se abre. Los foros de discusión de proteccion a la mujer, al menos en Argentina son abiertos y estan activos todo el a?o. Si bien todavía hay mujeres sojuzgadas y el maltrato familiar es una constante, tiene organismos que cubren su protección y son de fácil acceso. Si no lo hacen es una cuestión cultural y económica que habrá que ir cambiando y se está cambiando poco a poco con información y programas de capacitación femenina para que puedan de ese modo, solventar en casos de agresión su independencia.

Si estas informada sabrás en en la ultima década el Partido se ha sabido mover y estáticamente con una mentalidad superior a la de sus oponentes a sabido usar a su favor las desventajas. <br>  Digamos que fue mas un jandicam que a su favor los puso como los ganones.<br>  Y es que de eso se trata un partido en estos días(en México) no se trata de buenas propuestas y una elevada moralidad, principios y madures política. Sino que erróneamente las masas han caído en la llamada populacho en donde quien posee mas carisma, y regala mas en su campa?a es quien consigue la delantera. Con tristeza esa es la situación de la madures política en mi querido México. Aunque con la nueva generación que se abre paso y que cada ves mas se hace presente, tenemos esperanza en hacer un verdadero cambio.<br>  saludos Coneman.|`|2GmUW4t6aa	La verdad son peores que los del PRI<br>  <br>  Es triste que habiendo tanto talento tan bueno en México nuestro gobierno solamente lucha por sus propios intereses y no por los intereses de todos los Mexicanos...|`|AmdIkAkXaa	estudiando muy bien la politica mundial... en los ultimos 25 a?os  creo  fielmente que el pan son la  sucursal  de la ultraderecha en mexico  y que sus ideologias tienen que ver  con   privatización de bienes nacionales , libre empresa (o empresas que no pagan impuestos), fraudes electorales,(doble moral)  estan a favor  de mantener a mexico sumido en la ignorancia,  y  se hacen pasar por los mas bvuenos , por los que trajeron  la "democracia"... para mi son la peor opción  despues del pri|`|TDEZUyQhaa	ahh... no me interesa(aunque sea de mexico) ya que soy de <br>  un estado en el que el gobierno esta bien pagadito..pero creo que el peor es es PRD|`|WmfbctTKaa	Tienen tanta moral que la tienen doble.<br>  <br>  malditos hipocritas mal nacidos|`|n2zKgasMaa	pues si te vaz a la Historia del pan de como lo fundaron y sus ideales te puedez dar cuenta que todo lo que gomez morin tenia en mente nada paso y ahora muchos panistas estan llenos de rencor gracias a que los 70 a?os que estubo el pri en el poder los maltrataron ya solo piensan en fregarse a otros partidos y no en el vienestar de mexico ya vez segun ellos ivan a quitar el impuesto de la tenecia de los autos y mira ya vieron el dineral que era y mejor lo dejaron|`|sXjY5rGXaa	Mira, creo que el PAN, como todos los partidos, corrompen y no sirven para nada.<br>  Habrá quien te diga que son ultraderechistas y cosas del yunque... pero pues sólo son políticos.

Recordemos que la tasa de desempleo de la anterior medición (mayo de 2002) había alcanzado el 21,5% para los 28 aglomerados urbanos encuestados. Para octubre de 2002 el mismo indicador, según los datos del INDEC, había disminuido al 17,8% para los 31 aglomerados registrados. Pero esta disminución en la tasa de desocupación no resiste el menor análisis: de acuerdo con un informe oficial en la última EPH de octubre se incorporaron como "ocupados" al 40% de las personas que reciben un Plan Jefes y Jefas de Hogar. Esto significa que "gracias" a dicho plan de subsidios se "crearon" 595.000 nuevos empleos (registrados en la EPH que se hace sobre una población  total de 24.108.000 personas sobre un total de 31 aglomerados urbanos). <br>  De esta manera observamos el "enga?o" que el gobierno quiso generar en la opinión pública al presentar los datos de desempleo tomando en cuenta esta falsa creación de cientos de miles de empleos en la segunda mitad del 2002.<br>  Si se toma el total de población urbana del país (34.223.000 personas) el mismo informe del 17 de enero estima, según la proyección sobre este mayor universo poblacional, que se deberían incorporar a la medición del INDEC casi 800.000 "nuevos trabajadores" como resultado del plan de empleo estatal. Milagro infinito!!! Jesucristo y el milagro de la multiplicación de los panes queda empeque?ecido por esta acción del Iluminismo Peronista!!!.<br>  Nuevamente nos quieren mentir y ocultar las cosas publicando estas cifras "truchas" respecto a la evolución del mercado laboral.

1wZQU8DVaa	No creo que todos los mexicanos sean asi, como tu dices. <br>  Si bien son latinos la cultura mexicana no tiene similitudes con ninguna otra de Suramerica y Centroamerica. Que los Mexicanos son nacionalistas, si no lo dudo, pero tambien son Humildes, que son despreocupados por las cosas que suceden en Latinoamerica, es logico, de todos los paises latinoamericanos, este es el Unico que no se ha integrado economicamente a la region, somos un mercado mas para sus exportaciones y punto. Caso distinto a Suramerica, que ademas de nuestras similitudes culturales y nuestras raices Historicas, que en la mayoria son muy estrechas, tambien tenemos el Mercosur, la Comunidad Andina, eso nos hace interesarnos mas de lo que sucede en nuestros paises Hermanos.<br>  <br>  El ejemplo de Miss Universo, seguro fue algo que viste en YR, yo tambien lo vi, y sin embargo me dio igual, el que haya ganado nuestra representante fue algo bien, pero tampoco la gran cosa.<br>  <br>  Fijate que cuando hay una crisis politica en la region suramericana, toda la region se convilsiona de alguna forma, en cambio Mexico sigue igual. Mexico ahora pasa por una crisis politica y social muy grave, y ha afectado en algo a Suramerica, claro que no. Si en nuestra region nos consideramos paises hermanos, Mexico es un primo politico, asi de simple, Si piensas que los mexicanos deban sentir algo por nuestros paises estas muy equivocado, cada pueblo decide su destino a su manera, y eso se respeta.<br>  <br>  Hablarte algo de Mexico, solo de ellos te puedo explicar con bastante amplitud la Historia de los Mayas y los Aztecas, escuche rancheras de peque?o por mi padre, eso es todo lo que se de Mexico, y he comido platos tipicos mexicanos, ah tambien El Chavo del Ocho, de resto mas un co?o.<br>  <br>  Yo conozco mas Uruguay, Argentina, Chile y Paraguay, por la cantidad de amigos que de esos paises tengo aqui en Venezuela, y por los viajes que he hecho, y si bien, por logica hay diferencias culturales, tenemos muchisimos aspectos culturales afines.<br>  <br>  Asi que creo que disgustarse por un hecho normal, es ser egoista, si no fijate que la mayoria de las preguntas son hechas por Suramericanos y las constestan solo Suramericanos a veces se cuela un mexicano, y las preguntas hechas por mexicanos son solo para mexicanos, porque ni P idea de lo que pasa con Lopez Obrador y otros politicos mexicanos.<br>  <br>  Y como este es el espacio para preguntas politicas, voy a contestarle a CAT, lo de Hermanos Latinoamericanos, parte de la necesidad de union social y economica de nuestros paises, y Algo mas importante por nuestras raices historicas, Fijate las raices culturales e historicas de Venezuela estan muy entrelazadas con las de Colombia Ecuador y Panama, las de Ecuador con Peru y Bolivia, las de Bolivia con Paraguay, Chile y argentina, y las de Argentina con Uruguay y Brasil. somos un todo, y esa es la diferencia con Europa, que crearon la Union Europea, en la que muchos paises tienen solo una conexion Historica, y muchas de estas es por guerras y odios, y igual la crearon, Nosotros los Latinoamericanos no tenemos mas ventaja sobre los europeos, estoy claro que economicamente no hay ninguna comparacion, pero politica y socialmente hablando les llevamos una pelusa.<br>  Nosotros los hemos incluido a ustedes dentro del termino "hermanos",  bueno, porque hablan espa?ol y fueron colonizados tambien por Espa?a, por mas un co?o.|`|e6f560806cc974fe966c8fce90265cadaa	que un péndejete o dos hagan ese tipo de preguntas no significa que todos los mexicanos seamos así, no que muy abierto de mente, pues habretela mas para que pienses en todas las posiblilidades antes de preguntar (con todo respeto), además estamos en yahoo México, y otra, no se si seas argentino, pero los argentinos siempre que hacen una pregunta, en su pregunta ponen argentina, arg, o en la sección de fútbol de argentina, no tengo nada contra ellos pero, hasta ahora no he visto a ningún méxicano poner una pregunta asi<br>  <br>  mira este es un claro ejemplo de lo que te digo, es muy reciente esta pregunta<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnZVYyCubJ9H1VsfC8N_ys4p9At.;_ylv=3?qid=20080717015707AAcifdI">http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|iuADYEL7aa	primero ?

There is a right way and a wrong way of coming to a country and illegals are knowingly doing it the wrong way!!  Millions of immigrants came through the normal and legal process.  It was not easy for them, but they still managed to do it.  They also adapted to the American way of life, learned to speak English and assimilated into our society.  Illegals today are doing none of those!!  It would be a slap in the face of every American citizen and every immigrant if illegals would be granted amnesty or citizenship.  It would send the message that laws do not apply!!<br>  <br>  Illegals are hurting the economy.  They steal jobs from American citizens, send most of the money they make back to their home countries, do not pay all taxes, and are putting a financial strain on our health care and education systems!|`|RHPWqF30aa	A recent study by the non-partisan (California) Center for Immigration Research concluded that the results of illegal immigration cost the state around 12 Billion dollars a year.  That's about 1/4 of the recent budget compromise that Arnold recently signed and about 10% of the total state budget.  Imagine what the costs are for the entire nation.<br>  <br>  It's unfortunate but the US needs to focus on taking care of its own citizens first.  Job creation through the recent stimulus package should go to citizens first.  Debt relief should go to citizens first...etc,<br>  <br>  The reason that there is a long period of waiting before an immigrant becomes a US citizen is so that they acclimate into and appreciate the prevailing culture.  To legalize anyone who tries to circumvent the system is a slap in the face to all those who made the true and honest effort.|`|Ht4lD0XTaa	No, I think they should be rounded up and put into holding pens and deported.

And since the margin of victory falls within the margin of error the simple truth is that we will never know who won this election for real.  It is a statistical tie, and either group claiming victory is bogus.  I think there are two ways to equitably resolve this:<br>  <br>  1) A special election only between Franken and Coleman.

All he ever does is ramble on about change, and victory, yet he provided no results. Not as a Senator, not as a President.

rJLeVoMKaa	I am not sure if you heard Rick Santelli's comments, but his message summarizes the message of many who feel the dems are selling our country down the river without taking into consideration the consequences of their own action.  <br>  <br>  I am paraphrasing a statement from John Adams (one of the founders who had impact) who thought democracy would die if citizens are not educated or moral enough to react when the government becomes tyrannical.  In this case, the dems and reps both have done this by increasing the size of the national debt to amounts that will never be paid back.  Both wasteful spending the U.S. has placed themselves into bondage.  <br>  <br>  If you read the story of Exodus, I believe one of the reasons why the Hebrews were slaves was because they got into debt and had to work it off for the Egyptians.  I parallel this story with the U.S. to show that inability to pay off debt ultimately places you in chains of lost destiny, of lost ability to dictate portions of your life, and makes you a slave.  The U.S. has done so harm to itself that I think permanent slavery to foreign nations by its constant borrowing that the end of our influence in the world is inevitable.

Reminds me of the bipartisanship of inviting Republican Congressman to have breakfast with him after the stimulus bill is already written without any input from them and saying support it because I won then being hurt that they did not bow and fall to bended knee agreeing with him.  The President has no clue as to what bipartisanship is and no intention of heeding any advise that does disagree with what he has already decided.|`|gZEn8k6Saa	He knows he is being found out and his minions are starting to question him, he is still campaigning|`|oBviF550aa	He wants someone to blame when it doesn't work out.

It doesn't even begin to resemble the depression years in either cause or total effect so looking back at that time will do us little if any good. We are flying blind....and sometimes that means doing things that are unpopular with the people. If he is wrong, it will cause further damage to the country...but if he is right (and none of us really KNOW the answer to that), we will pull out of this.<br>  <br>  I think it is time we stop our belly aching (and I have been as bad as anyone) and just give things a chance to work or not work. We are only pulling ourselves down by all the negative stuff by us and the media both. For once....lets think positive. If anyone can succeed, it is America.

l0jixLszaa	<Eligible check><br>  Although specific eligibility requirements vary from state to state, most states have the same basic standards for collecting unemployment benefits. They include:<br>  <br>  -You must be unemployed or working less than full time <br>  -You must meet certain income requirements <br>  -You must be ready, willing, and able to work <br>  -You must have involuntarily left your job <br>  <br>  In general, you won't be eligible for benefits if:<br>  <br>  -You quit your job simply because you didn't like it <br>  -You're fired for committing a crime (e.g., stealing) <br>  -You've never worked before <br>  <br>  For more information, contact your state's local employment office. You can also look in the state government section of your phone book under Unemployment Insurance, Unemployment Compensation, Employment Insurance, or Employment Service. Or, you can try surfing the Internet using these same key terms.<br>  <br>  <How are benefits calculated?><br>  Regardless of which state you live in, you'll receive a weekly unemployment benefit based on how long you were employed and your prior wages. The state will calculate your average weekly wage, and you will receive a percentage of that wage based on your state's formula. You can figure out your average weekly wage by adding up 12 months' worth of pay stubs and dividing that number by 52. If you were salaried, just divide your annual salary by 52.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend you to go ahead and call your local unemployment office, and get a clear answer.|`|g5CojtpLaa	Unemployment is based on your highest quartely earing rate for the last 5 quarters. Since you haven't worked as much in the last couple of months you should still qualify for the benefits of a 40 hour week. So apply now for your states unemployment.

msNXomjTaa	Somewhere, there is a balance.<br>  <br>  I live in Canada, which has much higher taxes than in the US.  However, we have free medical care.  Some would say that is a great trade.  Others ask why they should be paying the costs for other sick people.  Many here say the government (through taxes) should offer free, or low cost daycare.  Others again ask why they should pay to take care of kids that are not theirs.<br>  <br>  Some social programs are necessary.  Like, a military to defend the country, and roads, and so on.  But, how much is enough?  Communism basically took all your income, and gave you everything you might need.  But, that takes away any incentive to do better, as more work did not equal more pay.  In Canada, taxes are graduated, with higher earners paying more in taxes.  However, a pay raise, especially at higher levels, will be almost entirely eaten up in taxes, which does not give people an incentive to excel.<br>  <br>  Somewhere, there is a balance.  The idea of having to pay the full medical costs for my family horrifies me.  OTOH, I do like the idea of getting more if I earn more.  I like lower taxes, but like you, I realize that we have to pay some.  However, too many taxes can stifle the economy.|`|9Kt7p7Vfaa	You should probably open a history book and familiarize yourself with basis on which this country was founded. The constitution was written such that any powers not delegated to the federal government would be reserved to the states including education and supporting militias for defense. It was also founded on a basis of non-intervention meaning we shouldn't have troops around the world. If you actually read the entire document, you'll discover that income tax is actually unconstitutional because it is in fact a direct tax which is prohibited by the constitution. If you consider a federally run education program as the best education, you should do some research into the matter before posting ignorant questions. Police and fire fighters are not federal employees but rather employed by state or local governments.|`|bkav003oaa	A more efficient government would naturally be smaller and cost less. <br>  <br>  So if you can make government more efficient, reduce the bloated bureaucracies and so forth, the tax burden on the American people would be lighter allowing for more innovation, etc.<br>  <br>  A smaller, more efficient government would also allow tax dollars to be shifted to things like health care, retirement benefits, etc. <br>  <br>  That should be a goal of every party.<br>  <br>  One note about education spending. School administrators often make triple the annual pay of teachers and consume at times 30% of a districts budget. That seems wrong to me. So if you pour more money into that broken system you are wasting it. However if you fix the system, then your tax dollar goes further and actually benefits STUDENTS. Novel concept, eh?<br>  I am not against taxes, that is the nations right. But I am upset when the taxes are wasted.|`|UzRijICuaa	Historical success in turning around economic downturns. However, associated with such past successful tax cuts were spending cuts.

Those items you listed are paid for by local taxes, so you need to do a bit of homework.  The kids are stupid because of the dumbing down in the public schools to accommodate minorities, the destruction of the family unit, and to appease liberals who think everyone should feel good about themselves.  No amount of money will make teachers any smarter.  Until the bar is raised, the dumbing down will continue.|`|AA11671599	Because about 60 percent of what we pay in all taxes now goes into someones pocket without having to do a damn thing for it.  AND THAT'S A FACT!|`|ZRDELmTOaa	whywhywhy i the real question|`|E6EbbZXzaa	You literally just asked, "Why do people want to have more money." <br>  <br>  The Government wastes a ridiculous amount of money. I recall the government purchasing a single hammer for $50,000 and $10 for single nails. I'm not exaggerating. As I type I am paying a government employee (with full benefits) to mow the grass in the parks. There's roughly two feet of snow on the ground. <br>  <br>  If you stop wasting money like this you can take less from individual people and business (aka job providers). <br>  <br>  History also shows that government coffers actually swell when taxes are reduced. How can this be you ask? Simple. When you have more money, you can make more transactions. Which in turn allows the person you purchased from the ability to make more transactions as now he has more money. And so on. While each individual transaction doesn't bring in as much money, the greater amount of transactions brings in a greater sum than at the higher tax bracket. <br>  <br>  That's the reason that stores ever put things on sale. <br>  <br>  As for schools there is a law called "Diminishing Returns" it basically states that you can only put so many resources to an end before add more resources to it no longer gains as much of an advantage. <br>  <br>  So, for example: Lets say that with benefits a teacher makes $60 an hour, and her class averages a C+. Now let's pay her $1,000,000 an hour. What's her class average going to be then? A++? Will all of them be astronauts and physicists? Unlikely. <br>  <br>  I'm in favor of an educated populous. But most of the money that goes to education just goes to bloat the salaries of the administration involved.  Why not expand the wildly popular school choice program which is full because people like it so much they want to use it, costs less per student, and appears to produce more educated students?|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	I prefer to choose where my money is spent, not Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, and Barack Obama telling me where to spend it.|`|hcc8fq7jaa	First, I certainly want our military, police, and firefighters paid. But considering that the average salary for a cop or fireman in the Chicago area is around $60k a year, they're certainly not hurting. I also definitely want the military to be strong and well paid.<br>  <br>  Schools? That's another story. We spend more per student than any other country, and our kids' educations are pathetic. We throw more and more money at the schools every year, and the results keep getting worse.<br>  You have teachers' unions who constantly complain about being "underpaid", when in reality, many do quite well. They also magically need to take off every personal and sick day they are allotted every year. THAT costs money, too. These same teachers unions REFUSE to allow teachers to be tested to prove their competence in the subjects they're teaching. <br>  You have grossly overpaid "administrators" and superintendents, many making 6 figures,  running the school districts, badly.<br>  You have union rules which force schools to hire only union maintenance workers and contractors. So, a window breaks, the janitor cannot simply fix it. They have to call in a union glazier to fix it. Need a light fixture replaced? Union electricians. It goes on and on. Until school districts get a firm grasp on expenses, and start to produce REAL results, I'm absolutely not for any more taxes to feed them.<br>  The big problem is that government (fed, state, local) has an almost inherent inability to control their spending. Unlike you or I, they don't feel the need to stick within a budget. They spend, spend, spend, usually for political clout. <br>  Running low on cash? "Hey, let's raise taxes." <br>  Can't raise taxes now? "Hey, let's increase fines and fees."<br>  Still not enough? "Hey, let's declare a whole bunch of things illegal, and fine the crap out of people."<br>  Get the idea?
T1f5IB6oaa	Basically the answer you are getting from the liberal democrats is: Yes we know that this whole thing was caused by Carter & Clinton creating loans for  un qualified people.

I mean, the point is that they can't afford it. When the housing market collapsed in 2007, when foreclosures really skyrocketed, Clinton had not been president for almost seven years.<br>  <br>  Now you tell me: If you have a person who has a mortgage for at least seven years before he or she falls too far behind to keep up, was that person unable to afford that mortgage from the start?<br>  <br>  People who can't afford a mortgage DON'T manage to pay it for a decade before the gig is up.<br>  <br>  What's more likely is that<br>  <br>  1) Something happened that made previously capable mortgage payers unable to keep up<br>  <br>  2) The people who all lost their homes in the housing market in 2007-2008 (you know, that huge number) did in fact receive mortgages that they could not afford, and lost their homes in a short period of time, meaning that they borrowed for their homes relatively recently.<br>  <br>  Your contention seems unlikely by comparison. Your argument hinges on the fact that people who bought homes in the Clinton era who were unable to pay their mortgages somehow managed to hold on for seven years, at least.

When the Community Reinvestment Act was initiated, there were some protections in place as well against predatory lending practices. The Community Reinvestment Act has been around for about thirty years, so why the problem now? Deregulation.<br>  <br>  2. While a poor person might not be accustomed to the complexities of home buying and mortgage loans, the banks were. The banks used predatory lending practices to make loans that they KNEW were high risk. So they made the loans, bundled them and resold them to strip off their fees and pass on the risks.

Either way it doesn't make your party look good. Tell me one thing Bush did to fix the economy, then I'll leave you alone. <br>  <br>  The reinvestment act gave loans to people who couldn't pay their morgages, and the unemployment rate decreased. But when Bush got in office, he deregulated the banks, which caused them to give our loans just so the banks could make money - that's how everything collapsed, the democrats aren't responsible for anything.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	The problems were increased ten fold because of the deregulation of the bank and finance industry (a Bush project to pay back the wealthy donors, i.e. CitiBank a chief member of that club).

IFVrLCNOaa	I think the process was flawed from the get go. I think the message is inconsistent as well.  Here, they let Nancy Left Wing Pelosi be in charge of the initial bill. It was ladened with non-jobs related programs (ie pork). In theory, you can argue that any form of spending pork or not is going to result in a job. But, we need permanent jobs not temporary jobs. And, the government doesn't have the ability to raise the needed funds without borrowing from China. Does it make sense that the US has to borrow from a communist country? Furthermore, the construction jobs are ok but many of the displaced workers are white collar workers without the skills/training and union membership to qualify for these jobs. So, all this money is going into deficit spending. Yet, they are separating the banking programs. Furthermore, Obama has now said they want to cut the deficit in half within so many years. How can this be? Won't the economy contract once more when the construction jobs are completed?|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	Nope, not fair at all...its only been a week since he signed the Stimulus Bill and its going to take some time to implement it and then a little more time to see what effect it has on the overall economy.

The potential of deflation now as opposed to runaway inflation a couple of years from now.|`|AA11286736	Don't know yet. But, you cannot undo 28 years of bad economics in just a few days. Lets give the government a break and wait a while longer before passing judgment.|`|xKthWOGtaa	No, it wouldn't be fair because we don't know the results of what has been recently set in motion yet.<br>  <br>  From the POV of an economist, what he is doing in trying to kickstart the economy through fiscal means is sound given the circumstances. Of course, we never know how economic plans will work out until they work out one way or the other, so it is too early to judge.<br>  <br>  A lot will also depend upon the monetary policy which is mainly under the control of the Fed, and so far I have not been overly impressed by their actions. The long-term recovery of the economy is as much (if not more) in the hands of Ben Bernanke as it is Barack Obama's.|`|1021f7b7dd4b55793a7f4d6f9e547c85aa	Honestly, hind sight is going to be the best judge on this. I really hope that Obama rectifies our major economic issues in these tough times. Although he wasn't my choice for President he has my full support.|`|4SLjJvcqaa	Just the ceasation of Bush policies will help.<br>  <br>  Bush policies were NO regulation in the banking industry, championed by none other than John McCain<br>  <br>  these banking billionaires refinanced refinanced loans and NOW the house of cards that was Bush's economy is falling like a rock, after they money brokers have learned thatthey have taken all they can get.|`|4Za1utmCaa	Way off track? No, but he is not exactly on target either. <br>  <br>  He needs to stabilize the financial markets first. That involves buying, then sorting out and expediting all these bad mortgage securities. Then he needs to pump more money into the banking system to free up more credit. He is doing some of this stuff, but not enough and not fast enough. That's why Wall Street is still running scared. Investors buy debt and we need them to start buying it again. Obama needs to do more, time will tell if he does.

PddGC0lYaa	All tickets in law enforcement can be "Amended" and will be valid and good. Never believe anyone when they say "you're clear, it's safe."<br>  <br>  The reason they can fix the number or letter on the citation to suit your vehicle, is because when they run the plate by dispatch on the citation, it won't match a vehicle. They change the wrong number, and it matches the vehicle they cited, then they know it's correct.<br>  <br>  If the ticket is incorrect, then the issuing officer can send in an amended citation, however in most/all parking tickets, there is no place for a registered owner/driver information. So chances are, if the Officer cannot remember the license plate correctly, then there's no chance he can send you an amended citation, as he doesn't know that the vehicle is the correct one.<br>  <br>  Do not listen to others when they say, "It's no good because he messed up." Only if the citation is not amended, will it clear you. You'll know if it wasn't amended if you don't get a new one in the mail, if you're the registered owner.<br>  <br>      Here's what happened to me, 2 months ago:<br>  I pulled up on a vehicle in the parking lot of our local grocery store, and there was a vehicle in a disabled parking spot without a placard or anything to identify the vehicle as a disabled persons. I cited the vehicle for the violation.<br>  <br>  When I wrote the citation, as always I noted the whole scenario on the back side of the canary copy (my copy) of the citation. On there, I wrote the license plate number.<br>  <br>  When I returned to the Police Department, I noticed AFTER issuance of the citation, I wrote a 4 instead of a 9. I made out a whole new parking citation, changed the 9 to a 4, and mailed the pink copy to the vehicle's registered owner that the license plate came back to. I never was called to court, meaning the ticket stayed. My incident report was filed, meaning the citation was valid.|`|AA10032302	no, if they wrote the plate down wrong you are in the clear.<br>  <br>  as i stated before you are in the clear, I wouldn't just forget about it however, just check w/ whatever dept. in your area handles parking enforcement and make sure that there is nothing outstanding on your vehicle.  If like the tool below, he made some type of correction to the summons after the fact and didn't leave notice on your car, then fight it, he will lose.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Yes.|`|AA11403032	If the ticket is incorrect, then you're in the clear.  Its a statutory instrument and has to be correct, otherwise it's unenforceable.<br>  <br>  You have cast iron grounds for appeal.<br>  <br>  You may have to go to an adjudicator if they persist with trying to pursue the fine, but if the ticket is wrong then it is 100% certain that the adjudicator will find in your favour.<br>  <br>  I really doubt they'll pursue it when the know the reg no is wrong.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .

Making jokes about the holocaust(racist or not)shows the lack of sensitivity towards the incident. There are young children today who show no respect for the holocaust victims as they are influenced by the jokes. Holocaust is nothing to laugh about.|`|H9BRSxa8aa	Yeah why not.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	They're talking about Bin Laden and merely mentioned the Holocaust.

48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	Since the decision in D.C. v. Heller, any adult (other than a felon, etc.) can have a gun in the home.  Even before Heller, California law permitted (and still permits) possession of a loaded firearm in the home.  California law permits carrying firearms openly in public if they are not loaded, but to load them the firearm must be either at a place of business, a home or campsite, or in a place where shooting is permitted.

IF, he/she were to get caught out in a lie on the stand the trouble for them is like  10 times as bad; especially in a serious criminal case..  Don't worry about the fuzz; get YOUR story straight and you'll be OK...  Almost ALL insurance companys will cut you some slack for 1 minor traffic violation.

As a Field Training Officer, I tell the new officers to try and find something unique to that traffic stop. You can usually accomplish this by documenting what the driver said.  Even if it is something as simple as a bumper sticker, two dogs in the backseat.... anything that will trigger your memory. <br>  <br>  I've never had a problem with traffic and criminal court. Two months is not that long.

If you honestly didn't see the cop car in the intersection before you "almost hit him" you either weren't watching your surroundings or you didn't really almost hit him. <br>  <br>  Unless you have proof that his headlights were out, I don't think you'll be able to do much. Also, if he turned right, while you had the green left arrow then you should've had the right-of-way. What was the ticket for?<br>  <br>  Also, if you contest it, just tell them the situation and let a judge decide. As far as insurance is concerned, what your increase will be depends on the individual company. You can ask the judge or officer how many points (if any) will go on your license.

The report also includes quotes from top journalists denying a liberal media bias, plus comments from journalists acknowledging the problem. Updated May 2007.<br>  <br>  How the Media Vote. Surveys of journalists’ self-reported voting habits show them backing the Democratic candidate in every presidential election since 1964, including landslide losers George McGovern, Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis. In 2004, a poll conducted by the University of Connecticut found journalists backed John Kerry over George W. Bush by a greater than two-to-one margin. See Section.<br>  <br>  Journalists’ Political Views. Compared to their audiences, journalists are far more likely to say they are Democrats or liberals, and they espouse liberal positions on a wide variety of issues. A 2004 poll by the Pew Research Center for The People & The Press found five times more journalists described themselves as “liberal” as said they were “conservative.” See Section.<br>  <br>  How the Public Views the Media. In increasing numbers, the viewing audiences recognize the media’s liberal tilt. Gallup polls have consistently found that three times as many see the media as “too liberal” as see a media that is “too conservative.” A 2005 survey conducted for the American Journalism Review found nearly two-thirds of the public disagreed with the statement, “The news media try to report the news without bias,” and 42 percent of adults disagreed strongly. See Section.<br>  <br>  Admissions of Liberal Bias. A number of journalists have admitted that the majority of their brethren approach the news from a liberal angle. During the 2004 presidential campaign, for example, Newsweek’s Evan Thomas predicted that sympathetic media coverage would boost Kerry’s vote by “maybe 15 points,” which he later revised to five points. In 2005, ex-CBS News President Van Gordon Sauter confessed he stopped watching his old network: “The unremitting liberal orientation finally became too much for me.” See Section<br>  <br>  Denials of Liberal Bias. Many journalists continue to deny the liberal bias that taints their profession. During the height of CBS’s forged memo scandal during the 2004 campaign, Dan Rather insisted that the problem wasn’t his bias, it was his anybody who criticized him. “People who are so passionately partisan politically or ideologically committed basically say, ‘Because he won’t report it our way, we’re going to hang something bad around his neck and choke him with it, check him out of existence if we can, if not make him feel great pain,’” Rather told USA Today in September 2004. “They know that I’m fiercely independent and that’s what drives them up a wall.” See Section.<br>  <br>  Evidence of Bias in News Coverage. The Media Research Center continuously reports on instances of the liberal bias in the mainstream media. Daily CyberAlerts offer a regular roundup of the latest instances of biased reporting, while our NewsBusters blog allows Web users to post their own reactions. Media Reality Check fax reports showcase important stories that the news media have distorted or ignored, and several times each year the MRC publishes Special Reports offering in-depth documentation of the media’s bias on specific issues.|`|2a48fdc514a71a7ec08cb137b00a0443aa	Why would any liberal be in favor of restricting the 1st amendment?<br>  <br>  If the fairness doctrine is so fair then why is it only for AM Radio?<br>  <br>  Let's have it for all media, TV, Cable, MTV, Movies, Newspapers, Blogs, etc.|`|724634aa550e4f2aa216e83840f9e8a4aa	any form of government controls on opinion or broadcasting is a very slippery slope.....<br>  <br>  But I guess if you like government telling what and when you can hear enjoy the end of the 1st amendment.|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	He's worried that it will force his broadcaster out of business as no one will advertise on liberal talk radio because of bad ratings.|`|3KXBzSzfaa	No but it would definitely but a plug on the squealing pigs slanderous pie hole.|`|aa4a4e068156f41134975a07e89ab28faa	I would love to hear that he wasn't allowed to lie, it would be the first time in his life he was ever speechless!

Are you sure you are British and not Nazi?  Last I checked, the UK was a free and tolerant country.  Sad to see that there are bigots like you over there.|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	I understand your point but its also laughable as Indian Hindus are more relaxed and welcoming of others than Indian or Pakistani Muslims.

What may seem wrong to us may be right to them and it will take time for them to adapt to things such as human rights and even women's rights.<br>  In England women were freely given to a wealthy man for marriage no matter how old or how ugly, purely because of security.

5Ho518J9aa	I'd say about 5 more minutes, from what the market is saying. Looks like Obummer's little "tax the ever-living snot out of everyone making $250K" went overr like a fart in church. I'm shocked. We true conservatives were saying that in September, when he was flapping his trap on the campaign trail. Oh well, just more of the same...the illuminati/NWO want to collapse our economy, and it's becoming quite obvious that it's intentional. No one could f--k up this bad by accident. The Globalist bankers are the exact same crew that Jesus threw out of the temple. If you look it up, they were selling messenger doves alongside the money changers, right? Rothschild used the doves to sent the false flag message about the battle of Waterloo, right? Boy, I'm just a stupid lumberjack, and I figured the whole thing out. Turns out books are also used for reading, not just holding up the other end of your Futon, folks! <br>  To get it to stop: Just make it clear that you're well aware of their plan. Without secrecy and plausible deniability, they cannot put their more sinister ideas into play. Make it clear that armed insurrection  is always a viable option, and pray to God it never comes to that. Walk tall, and carry a good weapon. I don't do soft.|`|M3maZgdyaa	Tough Love.

Don't be so cocky.|`|fysWsW1Yaa	Not the first time.

Most likely have the flatscreen tv on the wall, and the latest in gaming products. Some work under the table, take free government give outs, and live better than most of us.|`|2MfFXmNMaa	I agree that some need a hand up. But there are many who abuse. Like the mother who keeps having more kids to increase the amount of state assistance, while talking on a cell phone and driving a better car than me.|`|XRYAfxpTaa	I agree with you. There is a family in this county, notorious for being a multi-generation welfare group. One created quite a display one afternoon in a small cafe after filing for divorce. He publicly declared, "I can't stay married to her. She's too stupid to get a crazy check." Subsequently, he remarried her after she obtained a welfare check due to impaired mental status. There are piles of beer cans in the yards where this family lives. They expend more energy seeking assistance than they would working, and one who escaped the family and now is living a successful life in another state is no longer welcome. I realize this is family is an unusual example, but the fact is, welfare is abused and those abuses must be stopped. <br>  <br>  They may be a local joke, but welfare abuse is not a laughing matter and need for welfare should not be perpetuated.|`|KgY4X4ccaa	How many people do you think live their whole lives on welfare?

I can tell you that without checking out your site.<br>  <br>  My brother has been employed for only about 18 months of the past 5 years.  (I can give him 9 months of that time due to circumstances beyond his control)<br>  <br>  He gets himself fired all the time & drags his feet on getting other jobs.  He talked of wanting to get the temporary census job, but he waited to apply until all the jobs were filled.<br>  <br>  But he might have a mental illness, so I have some sypathy there for him.  But, then again, he won't get help.  So that is his fault again.<br>  <br>  I mostly feel sorry for wife & kids.|`|Spr3E5FWaa	I agree with with you in your additional details.  I think people take advantage of social welfare programs such as unemployment far too often.  However, it is needed for those who truly need it.  It is difficult because, in my view, it is a service that must be provided, but it is awfully difficult to make sure there is no abuse going on.|`|EeGgovyCaa	Seriously, you are going to compare these few people to the millions that lost what they had. The people in the article made alot of money and most likely had some stashed away. While others, like myself, live paycheck to paycheck and can't afford to put away. So when you only get half that amount from unemployment it makes living even harder than before. It's not all great!|`|EzsnkxgVaa	Wow...some idiot writer figured out not working is fun if you aren't starving or losing your house and car...If I was her editor, I would give her a chance to do a really in-depth study of the "joys of unemployment".|`|6mLhiSXuaa	At least people like him are getting money, when other's are being thrown into the streets....|`|rrSaoOK2aa	I don't feel sorry when they live the good life.

SkFgDxpEaa	Perhaps no other profession has as many variations in titles than that of lawyer. The titles attorney, lawyer, barrister and Esquire are frequently used, sometimes interchangeably, in the field of law.

Not to mention it lacks even a hint reason.<br>  <br>  Top 5 contributing factors to our current economy:<br>  <br>  1. Stagflation: Bernanke's no-win Achilles heel<br>  Reading Fed-watcher William Fleckenstein's new book, "Greenspan's Bubbles: The Age of Ignorance at the Federal Reserve," you get the feeling that for 18 years America's banking system was run like a "new age" hippy commune, by a Ayn Rand free spirit who believed "anything goes."<br>  Now the Fed's run by a college professor and Fleckenstein says he's "in over his head." Except this is the real world, a $13 trillion economy in a $48 trillion world, not a college seminar on economic theory.<br>  In the 1970s Nixon faced a similar problem, convinced then by Fed Chairman Arthur Burns: "No one ever lost an election on account of inflation." Wrong! Low rates generated inflation not growth. That stagflation triggered a bear/recession. Is Professor Ben trapped, repeating history?<br>  2. Housing-credit meltdown: We've got a long way to go!<br>  It's far from over folks and still spreading: Years of inventory, foreclosures, building slowdown, risky bond insurers, weak rating agencies, funds holding bad debt, freezing exits and fuzzy math on values. Yet Bernanke and Paulson still live in a Washington bubble of wishful-thinking fantasies.<br>  Economic realists say what's needed is a massive $1.6 trillion demand-driven program (that's the record cash Corporate America's hoarding) not a dinky $160 billion supply-side "appease the voters" giveaway that ends up increasing the odds of a lengthy Nixon/Burns style bear-recession.<br>  3. Commodities: World's new reserve 'currency,' not dollars<br>  Forget paper money and IOUs. Commodities are the world's new "currency:" Hard stuff like oil, grains, metals, gold. And that means America is financing the growth of our enemies, surrendering our long-term economic power for short-term oil-guzzlers and plastic toys. We are responsible for making Russia and China into threatening world powers. Buffett warned us. We're selling the farm, piece by piece.<br>  4. Toxic derivatives: World's $516 trillion ticking time bomb<br>  Derivatives are great for deal-by-deal risk management in a $48 trillion GDP world. But leverage them 10 times over across the globe and we got a financial "weapon of mass economic destruction."<br>  Bill Gross warns that the world's new unregulated "shadow banking system" is printing new money, now at $516 trillion, out of thin air, with no "central banks of last resort" backing up the "Frankenstein" monsters they've created.<br>  5. Massive debt: Everywhere, trade, federal, states, local<br>  America's Comptroller General David Walker, Congress's head accountant who is leaving his position next month, warns our government is "bankrupting America." Using unethical accounting worse than Enron's. Fiscal responsibility lost. He sees "striking similarities" with Rome. Both parties are gluttons in a spending orgy.
c9c21b842bc0967b25ee1f5620157edfaa	I don't see how having the government take $3000 more from my pay next year would be called anything else.<br>  <br>  As for this being only directed at the rich, if your marginal tax rate is currently 15%, it will go to 25%, if it is currently 25% it will go to 28%, if it is currently 28% it will go to 33%, if it's 33% it will go to 35% and if it is currently 35% it will go to 39.5%.  But here's the best part, each of the threshold levels will go down the line and if you are married, your taxes will go up even more than just the changes in the marginal rates, since the "marriage penalty" will be reinstated. If you  are married and have a combined income of $60K you will be in for a nice surprise (I think the tax hike will be about $2000 for that group), if you are single with an income of $40K you will be paying about $1000 more in taxes when this tax hike on the rich goes into effect (the reason I know this is that I was making $40K when the Bush tax cuts were enacted and my taxes decreased by $1000 the following year).<br>  <br>  By the way, I've already budgeted for the loss of $3000 in spendable income (I did this the day after the election), I am doing this by not spending money at resturants, I use to eat out several lunches a week and at least one dinner a week.

Next, you should react only to the point when the attacker is no longer a threat. Don't beat him to a pulp - get him to the point where you can get him down to the ground and can gain control of the situation. <br>  <br>  To prove it in court, you must prove that the attack would NOT have eased had you removed yourself from the situation. <br>  <br>  Legally, here are the steps:<br>  <br>  1) Check out the situation - can you just remove yourself from the environment (i.e. leave)? <br>  2) If not, call 9-1-1 or attempt to get someone to do so.<br>  3) Do not BEAT THE GUY TO A PULP. You want to give him as little bruising or beating as possible. This isn't about revenge.

Also, depending on how this situation even got started, your self-defense may be an even weaker case.<br>  <br>  "If he tries to cheap shot me, can I attack him?"<br>  Cheap shot?<br>  <br>  Again - if you can avoid responding w/o injury, then you can defend yourself - that's what self-defense means.<br>  <br>  "If he lays a hand on someone else, can I defend them?"<br>  By doing what?  Do you think that there's a law against providing an attacked person w/any assistance?  I think you're confusing defense in general with the specific criminal defense of justified asault.<br>  <br>  "If I'm attacked in the persons house, does it matter?"<br>  You seem to think that these questions are simple - they are not.  Rather they are decided after a full reading of the facts.  There is no checklist.<br>  <br>  "When do I have to let up?"<br>  Assuming you were legally entitled to let-down, you must relent once you can safely leave.<br>  <br>  "I just want to know if the situation ever comes around so I dont get into any legal trouble."<br>  2 things - the situation seldom just comes around - people make it so.

The leaves of the table flexed with the blast venting some, and deflecting some.<br>  3- The table leg was solid oak- also blocking the blast.<br>  Modern research has shown that if both blocks of explosive were used, it would've killed everyone in the room.

51ffe1363d554561e1aea841802c65b5aa	over a period of at least 6 months, the bankrupt U.S. Government managed to manifest 2 trillion dollars out of thin air, doesn't anyone wonder where this money came from ? the language in the bailout for homeowners says if you bought a home that was beyond your financial ability to pay back, you wont get any help, but if if your a LENDER who's clients failed too pay you back, you got assistance, even if you used poor judgement in qualifying those people for loans, That's communism, that's obama's thinking, I believe Alan Keyes would have done more for this country as president, I'm affraid we choose a feel good word phrasing politician with little knowledge of the constitution or who has any intention in following it.<br>  your right about the money paying off everyones mortgage, but remember, their intentions are different, this happened around the turn of the 20th century, and before that, banks with failed mortgages end up in the big fishes hand for pennies on the dollar..... our real government is actually a team of international bankers who control our entire political system, you will find this out in the days ahead, keep watching.|`|aa4a4e068156f41134975a07e89ab28faa	The stimulus packet is a separate entity from the mortgage one.  Do you understand that foreclosures have a downward pull on the economy?  If we allow all those mortgages to fail, our economy will be way worse off than it is now.<br>  <br>  No money is going to ACORN from the stimulus.  And the stimulus isn't limited to mortgage help, there is much more to it than that.  I don't like spending all this money we don't have, but I am willing to give it a chance if it will help.  So far, we don't know one way or another.|`|a9etFur6aa	It's not just the housing market that's in trouble right now, you know. <br>  <br>  But yes, I agree.

I am sure they will put it to use, just not for producing jobs that will exist for a period of longer than a few years.  It will produce some short-term jobs, but then what once those jobs are completed?|`|ShdV8jm4aa	Where do you think that money came from? Us. The point is that homeowners shouldn't pay their mortgages & the govt. pay all of it. We are in the biggest economy slump since the Great Depression and yet we spend $800 Billion on abortions & junk.|`|jKJkdgHDaa	no---it encouraged me to buy extra food and water,(helping the economy) for when the bottom drops out--- 2 more guns,and thousands of rounds of ammo,to discourage any would be looters---(again, to help the economy)|`|AA11671599	Absolutely!|`|jCLPEgKYaa	Just because someone is having a problem doesn't mean money will help... Might as well throw money at everyone. People who know how to put money into good use should be given the money to do so.|`|IasHMWM2aa	No. You are using bad math, the stimulus bill is not all mortgage bailout so you cannot use the homeowners as your denominator. That would produce a false statistic. Furthermore the number of homeowners who participate is unknown at this point so 3,000,000 may not be accurate to begin with.<br>  <br>  Note to Lindy. If you are not paying on your mortgage you are not eligible for the mortgage bailout. You have to be paying on your mortgage.<br>  <br>  Acorn is receiving zero dollars from the stimulus bill.|`|AA11235920	Most of it is just a bunch of bureaucracy building junk that isn't even intended to produce more jobs in the private sector aka.

AA11494150	Simply paying the fine does not give you driving privileges, you still need to go back to the DMV and reinstate your license.<br>  <br>  It is common for the judge to issue another suspension, I would suggest you check with the court clerk. If you reinstate your license before the paperwork from the last ticket gets to DMV, they will just suspend you again.|`|ElvQTpUVaa	"would the dmv get the record and suspend it?"<br>  Not unlikely - especially if the suspension was a mandatory one provided in the law of the offense for which you were convicted.

94067f0094ecabf35aa20a2ef3c6e10daa	Instead of continually using money to bail out big companies.....<br>  1st: Give the money to the co's on conditions.<br>          -the co. can have the money, but they must forgo all PAST debts of the consumer. (this bails out the co. and the consumer) Gives all citizens the chance to catch up to their debt.<br>          -the co. can no longer practice certain "grey" areas of the law. Such as increasing % rates for those consumers who pay on time. <br>          -there must be a cap on all interest rates<br>  <br>  Instead of foreclosure on a home: <br>  When a consumer is more than 60 days behind on a mortgage, the deed/loan is transfered to govt. <br>  The govt. is now the loan holder for this home. The payments will be made or be garnished from future IRS tax or stimulus payments. <br>  <br>  Property taxes are a big contributor to faulty mortgage, property and debts.  No more property taxes! A person already pays sales tax, homeowners tax, and many many more. Why should we continue to pay the govt. for something we've already bought.<br>  <br>  Flat tax rates, that include...local, county, state and federal. We pay to fed. govt. they in turn fund the other entities via the Census. (which is what this is for to begin with!)<br>  <br>  Tax credit/stimulus for having a stay at home parent.  (many European countries do this and it works wonders) Not only do the children have a stay at home parent, but it opens the job force nearly 2 fold. Thereby, diminishing the need for most public assistance.  This increases need for jobs, there in turn are no more jobless<br>  <br>  For a 2 parent jobless family collecting P.A. it is a 6 mos. min. then if no steady job is found, they are to enlist a min. of 2 yrs in the military of their choosing. This increases the military force, and diminshes the desire for P.A.|`|KTNqah9eaa	I would suggest it's too early to say.

That's how you prolong it by 13 years or so ( thanks FDR). <br>  <br>  Now a true solution would be to decrease useless government spending (aka most of the Stimulus package), decrease taxes on ALL citizens and business, STOP printing money (Get rid of Federal Reserve) and go back to gold standard, welfare reform, immigration control, etc..

New Hampshire. Chaplinski called the officers "goddamn fascists", and was arrested for disorderly conduct. The Court ruled words intended to provoke are not covered under the First Amendment, and upheld the conviction. The case is commonly referred to as "The Fighting Words Doctrine".<br>  <br>  With that said, I can tell you the officers I work with are pretty tolerant if the comments are just between you two. However, if there are witnesses, you stand a pretty good chance of getting arrested.|`|AA11622716	There is no universal law on the subject.  You can get arrested for anything.  Whether that arrest would be lawful would depend on where you were when you did it, what exactly you did and the manner in which you did it.

2NRCJgq2aa	Hashish (Class B Drug) is a preparation of cannabis composed of the compressed trichomes collected from the cannabis plant. It contains the same active ingredients but in higher concentrations than other parts of the plant such as the buds or the leaves. Psychoactive effects are the same as those of other cannabis preparations such as marijuana. It is sometimes believed that the effects are different, but those differences usually stem from variations between regionally different Cannabis specimens, that are more traditionally processed into Hashish.<br>  <br>  The Marijuana Reform Act of 1977 classified possession of lesser amounts of marijuana up to 25 grams (25\25130 cigarettes) as a violation. Penalties range from a $100 to $250 fine and/or up to 15 days in jail, depending on whether it is the first, second or third offense.<br>  <br>  Possession of more than 25 grams but not more than eight ounces is a misdemeanor; possession of more than eight ounces is a felony. Sale of 25 grams or less is a misdemeanor; sale of more than 25 grams is a felony.<br>  <br>  The penalties for sale or possession of hashish are more severe. Possession of any amount, no matter how small, is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in county jail and/or up to a $1,000 fine. Possession of one quarter ounce or more is a felony. Sale of any amount of hashish, no matter how small, is a felony.  <br>  <a href="http://www.hashish-center.com/hashishfacts.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hashish-center.com/hashishfac...</a><br>  <br>  Statues will vary by state.|`|86692840fce86f8a24dea58512123d09aa	acutally hash is considered a narcotic because it has such a high concentration of THC.

8dc5NMexaa	Any party who fails to respond to or supplement a request for discovery shall not be permitted to present evidence on that point "unless the trial court finds good cause" sufficient to require admission exists. The exclusion is mandatory.   Alvarado 830 S.W.2d 911(Tex.1992). <br>  Your attorney must produce, and then argue to the court that there was "good cause" for failure to timely respond.  "Forgetting" and failing to calendar deadlines are not good cause.  The attorney must prove that failure to timely file was not due to "conscious indifference, that the opposing party is not prejudiced thereby, and no prejudicial delay will occur, and there are less harsh remedies that the judge may order such as sanctionable fines against the attorney for so failing.  On the facts stated, if the trial court excludes your evidence, then the appellate court would most probably find that the trial court did not err.<br>  I do believe that in a case such as this, the attorney will be monetarily liable to you for the obvious negligence.  In the latter case, when you seek recovery from your attorney for the damages caused, you will need to show that the evidence that was excluded would have been probably sufficient, if admitted, to have affected the outcome of your case in the trial court.

The best thing that could happen is to find a way to make the house worth more than the original selling price.  To do that we need to have more buyers than properties.  Empty lots aren't worth more than developed property.  Damaged property is worth less than an empty lot since it requires debris removal before you can find a buyer for it.

yTkNT3OSaa	Anywhere that is private property are allowed to make their own rules (basically any building other than your own house); you won't be breaking any laws by having a pocket knife in those buildings, and most won't care, but might and could refuse you entry.<br>  <br>  This is most prevalent at entertainment venues and government buildings.<br>  <br>  Other than that, you just have to make sure that your knife conforms to your local laws, and you'll be fine with it in most public places.|`|AA11622716	You cannot take it to my house, or to any other private place, such as a store, that does not allow it.|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	Check the local laws.  They vary.<br>  <br>  In New York City, the famous Sullivan Law makes it illegal for you to take your knife anywhere outside your apartment.  However, not all judges are totally insane.<br>  <br>  Many years ago, a woman put a steak knife in her purse when she went out at night in NYC.  When a mugger jumped her, she grabbed the knife and stabbed him.  The police arrested her for carrying an illegal “weapon.”  When the prosecutor tried to start his case, the judge threw it, and him, out of court, saying, “This is not what this law is about!”  He told the prosecutor, “Don’t you EVER bring a case like this into my court again!”<br>  <br>  Now, that was a good judge!  Today, many liberal judges would probably throw the woman in jail for a few years and order her to pay her attacker’s medical bills.  But don’t count on being so lucky.  A friend of mine lived in NYC and used to take his pistol to a shooting range.  He had to put the unloaded gun into one locked carrying case and the ammunition in another locked carrying case.  He had to have permits for both the pistol and the ammo.  A private citizen cannot get a permit to carry a loaded pistol, or any other weapon (such as a knife), outside of his residence.  <br>  <br>  You may have heard about the Chicago man whose house was broken into by an armed intruder.  The intruder showed his gun and the resident shot him.  Then state senator Barack Obama wanted the homeowner to be arrested and prosecuted.  Fortunately, calmer heads prevailed and no charges were filed against the homeowner.<br>  <br>  Wherever you go, make sure you know the local laws.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to call the local police in a jurisdiction where you want to take your knife.  Be sure you speak to an officer, not a clerk, and be sure to get his name and badge number.|`|KZCrNa7Zaa	To carry a knife in your pocket is immediately illegal unless it's for a decorational or functional reason.

It is called "Moral Hazard" when people act according to an outside stimulus such as a first time buyers tax credit.

For this to work, the population has to have a deep commitment to non-violence, and the beliefs of most Palestinians frankly preclude this.<br>  <br>  There was one attempt to try this in the West Bank; it's probably not coincidental that it took place in a Christian village.  One reason it failed was that the PA repeatedly sent provocateurs into planned non-violent demonstrations to incite violence.  The account is in a useful if somewhat biased book by Charles Sennott.<br>   <br>  I agree with you that a serious and sustained non-violent movement would certainly be the most severe challenge ever to Israeli settlers and other rightists, and might be unstoppable.|`|qC9pcfP5aa	If it came to that yes.

You should be able to criticize someone, particularly our elected leaders.  Even if that means ridiculous comments like calling him a healer.  You may feel you have been unfairly attacked for such comments, perhaps you were even called a racist.  <br>  <br>  I can understand that; not long ago while criticizing the decisions to torture people and ease drop on the phone calls of our own citizens, because I believed those decisions were very bad for our great nation, I was called a traitor, a terrorist and even providing aid and comfort to the enemy(which is treason).  I was told this by a fella who was given multiple draft deferments during the Vietnam war and this same fella was aware that I've been in the military for more than a decade.  These attacks were clearly without merit.  Sometimes the attacks on you are without merit as well.<br>  <br>  We would all benefit if we could have a more honest discussion with each other.  Some sarcasm is funny, and some is just a big waste of time.<br>  <br>  Now I think Obama is proving himself to be an exceptional leader.  I also think he is imperfect.  Some criticism is merited.  Some is not.  Some criticism sways public opinion and affects a presidents ability to lead, so if you attack someone, you can expect someone to defend them.  If 50 million republicans are going to attack President Obama, you can bet some people will step in to defend him, so he can go about his business.<br>  <br>  Make all the criticisms you want of President Obama, just understand the more reasonable the criticism, the more reasonable the response will be.|`|OQ12LRvuaa	Obama has very little experience in general.

You see it in his tantrums.   He has never been really tested before and the frustration is due to fear of being found out.<br>  <br>  The really scary thing is that he has never really been tested very strongly in his presidency and he is still in his comfort zone, spending money on social programs.

That is our bottom line." - President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998<br>  <br>  "If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program." - President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998<br>  <br>  "Iraq is a long way from [here], but what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face." - Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998<br>  <br>  "He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983." - Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998 <br>  <br>  The liberals soon forget or rewrite history is why.|`|AA11286736	He lied about WMD.|`|8rvXwx7Qaa	The War was authorized by a War Powers Act but not a Declaration. That Act was extended with each funding request, all the way to Bush's last year in office. He also had UN Resolutions supporting the Military Actions.  The Democrats, as the War effort support deteriorated with the American People, and as evidence of WMD's were disproved, made the Political decision to oppose Bush in effort to enhance their chances for reelection in Congress and for President in 2008. They succeeded.  However, Americans have reason to turn on a dime if things promised don't come about. Particularly after 6 years of War in Iraq, the People are thought by many to have a short attention span.|`|6eELSo1raa	Who else is there? It wes all about oil.|`|6Arvb5qnaa	hahaha its amazing how many people answer "because bush is a liar..." Simple answer from the simple minded. I just want to point out that YES, a president can attack another country without the permission of congress. HOWEVER, the president cannot keep U.S. troops in another country for more than TWO weeks without the permission of congress. Bush wasn't the only one who started this war, and if it was such a horribly misguided war, and if he lied about ANYTHING, congress would have pulled us out of there so fast. Thats what the system of checks and balances is all about. No one person has all of the power. He was just one of the people who said that this was a war worth fighting. And its as simple as looking up how many other people were for the war when it started too. Liberals have never liked war, they never will, and they'll always try to stop it, and blame people who don't try to. And they will also never understand the ramifications of not having wars. I wish we could send all liberals to a new country made just for them and see how long THEY last without protecting themselves with war.

We have been safe since 911 - you could a least give him credit for that and then you can continue parroting liberal media sources and liberal politicians.  <br>  <br>  The controversial decision was taken with bipartisan support. Second, there were precedents for such action in prior Democratic administrations. Third, polices will continue under the Obama administration.  Four, the media has changed their positions on the issue since the November election. <br>  <br>  The Patriot Act passed Congress in October 2001 by majorities in both parties -- and was reauthorized in 2006. The original versions of the FISA wiretapping accords were enacted under the Carter administration in 1978.<br>  <br>  Both the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were given authorization by Congress. The pre-9/11 precursor for the removal of Saddam Hussein was the unanimous passage of the 1998 Iraq Liberation Act -- prompted by then-President Clinton's warnings about Saddam's dangerous weapons: "Some day, some way, I guarantee you he'll use the arsenal."<br>  <br>  Barack Obama no longer believes that the controversial FISA accords should be repealed. And the retention of George Bush's secretary of defense, Robert Gates, along with  Sen. Hillary Clinton as secretary of state and former Bush Mideast envoy Gen. James L. Jones as national security adviser -- all of whom were in favor of removing Saddam -- suggest that those who once supported the Iraq war will have more foreign policy influence in the Obama administration than those who opposed it all along.<br>  <br>  Talk of a shredded Constitution and the need to immediately shut down Guantanamo Bay are no longer daily fare in the U.S. media -- particularly after the terrorist attacks in Mumbai. Suddenly we have sober reflection about how to stop such a paramilitary attack here in the U.S. -- and what to do about monsters in custody in Guantanamo, such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-proclaimed architect of 9/11.<br>  <br>  Like it or not, radical Islamic terrorism antedated George Bush and has continued after him. And while we may lament how Bush sometimes conducted or articulated his policies, his support for beefing up homeland security, hitting terrorists hard abroad, supporting Democratic movements in the Middle East, and replacing two odious tyrannies with consensual governments once appealed to most Americans.<br>  <br>  Because they are largely sound strategies, they will not change much under Obama -- who for at least a while will enjoy the benefit of the doubt when confronting the same old nasty lose/lose choices.<br>  <br>  We can thank God that President George Bush didn't care about doing the safe thing for himself; he cared about keeping Americans safe. And he did, for eight years.<br>  o_O|`|jd14u32qaa	Americans, Congress included, were overwhelmingly emotinal at the time.

I remember decades ago hearing, “We cannot afford to be the world’s policeman.”  But that’s just what we are doing.  <br>  <br>  John Danforth, the former Missouri Senator, said, “When it comes to spending money, we are like alcoholics.

Now WE have to face the problems THEY created with THEIR social engineering, and they expect US and our future generations to pay the bills.  <br>  <br>  Who the hell decided that home ownership is a human right or a birthright?  It’s not.  No one has a “right” to own a home they can’t pay for.  As it is, the homes people “bought” but couldn’t pay for are now on my back – and yours.  The politicians and special interest groups, like ACORN, who pushed lenders to lower their credit standards so more lower-income people could “own” homes screwed all of us, because we are now being told that WE have to pick up the tab.  And that tab is trillions of dollars. <br>  <br>  Notice that we are no longer hearing about sub-prime loans.  Now it’s all about “predatory lenders.”  That’s pure BS.

Anytime you have leverage over someone they become a security risk, vulnerable to blackmail and extortion.  That extortion might involve surrendering secrets, troop movements, whatever.  The best way to deal with this kind of thing is to remove the DADT directive.  If it hurts morale, maybe the ones that need to leave are the ones that can't deal with the Gays being there.  DADT is a security risk and should never have been an allowed policy.<br>  <br>  Gay/Straight, Black/White, Male/Female, none of those matter as much as finding qualified individuals ready and willing to do the job that needs doing.  This goes for the military, the government, and private industry.  Time for us to quit looking at what pulls us apart and dwell on what can pull us together.  The fact we are all humans, that we are all subject to desires that to other humans don't make sense.<br>  <br>  The idea that it was good enough when I was in the service doesn't mean that it is good enough today.

Obama made it where you don't have to keep it a secret anymore. I think anyone who is capable physically and mentally of serving our country should be able to reguardless of sexual preferance.

Some of the greatest military commanders were gay.  <br>  I was stationed with gays that certain people knew about and there was never a problem UNLESS someone ratted them out.  I was at one duty station where EVERYONE in the division, including our department head, knew this one gal was gay. The division officer was the ONLY one who didn't know.  The only way she got kicked out was because she was in stationed in  Hawaii and her partner was stationed at the Pentegon.  Her partner came to visit us, as she often did.  This time she gave the key to her apartment to a gal in her office to take care of her guinie pig over the weekend.  The gal went through my Marine friend's stuff and found pictures of naked women, naked men, and naked women and men taken at nude beaches in Spain when she and my shipmate were stationed there, and found letters from her partner who was in Hawaii.  That was in October.  The following March, the SNOOP was getting out of the Marines and stopped by NCIS to say that my Marine friend was gay. She was out in less than 6 weeks.  Why? NCIS got a warrant for her apartment and on the letters and pictures of naked WOMEN, they had a case against her.  Less than a month later, my shipmate was kicked out.  BOTH were top performers and the Marine had been 'penciled in' for orders to the Commandant of the U.S. Marines!  But that didn't matter.  She was a lesbian and the Marines wanted her OUT...along with my shipmate.|`|Oo1FI3Mkaa	Let them serve and welcome them at the same time.  A person's sexuality should not be a factor in whether to allow a person to serve in our military.  <br>  <br>  I retired from the Navy and about half of my time was spent with Marine Corps units.  When someone is discovered as being gay they are processed out with lightning speed; usually about 24 hours.  It was always very sad to see a highly trained and qualified individual kicked out mercilessly because of this dumb regulation.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	I am all for it.  The ban on gays serving, and the awkward "don't ask" policy currently in use both had major drawbacks, and they didn't prevent gays from serving, they just made their sexuality become a cat and mouse game and they destroyed some really fine servicemember's careers and even lives.  <br>  <br>  When I first went to the Fleet as a Marine, we had an outstanding LT.  This was the kind of guy who always put his men first, listened to the NCO's, and did his homework to the absolute max.  He was tough, fair, fit and had that unmeasurable quality of honor and wisdom which is so rare in any officer, especially such a young one.  Anyway, he was gay, and some creep on base discovered that fact and turned him in (this was before DADT.  They started investigating him, and rather than dishonor the Corps and us, his platoon, he committed suicide.  I never served another officer who was half the man that he was, and I always thought it was a rotten, stupid waste of talent and dedication.|`|XacKfXcBaa	Having been Gay in the Naval Air, I was the top of my Class and from the Day I entered was excelerated and recieved propay.<br>  In those days you did not let anyone know you were Gay even out of the service (1960's).<br>  My view is the "Uniform Code" should be based oon performance on and off the base.<br>  So if someone is doing thier duty to the best of thier ability, and the people around them agree they are an asset, then by all means keep them.|`|8454b08cd94e39ec6f1c2eb2f2b07a68aa	I agree with Weap.

AA11592327	There is no black and white answer to your question. Each individual will be different, but mostly liberals care about personal freedoms without government interference. Examples are pro-choice when it comes to abortion, freedom to read any book, listen to any radio program without fear of government sensor.

I firmly believe that he is wrong. I heard the speech from the screenwriter who won for Milk as well and he invoked God in his speech justifying homosexual marriage. Well, the Bible says that homosexual sex is wrong. <br>  <br>  If God, nature or evolution wanted two people of the same sex to have intercourse, man would have been given a vagina.<br>  <br>  The way I see it, it is not merely the tax write-offs that homosexuals want, they also want to morally justify what they are doing. Because you need to morally justify heterosexual sex with marriage, it is reasonable for them to think the same way with homosexual sex.  That is not the kind of society I wish for myself or my descendants. I voted against gay marriage and I feel no shame about it.  The Bible says to leave the non-Christians to God. That is all the moral justification they will ever get from me.|`|AA11838675	I think Sean Penn is one of the greatest actors of our time, but he and other entertainers should keep their traps shut when it comes to their political and moral beliefs.

It's in the hands of the Job Classification Interviewer at the MEPS (Military Entrance Processing Station) who actually sits down on his or her MEPS computer to look for the actual available slots.  The recruiter has no access to this system.<br>  <br>  The Job Classification Interviewer will screen the applicant based on his scores, his physical qualifications, his security qualifications and his desired ship date then match him to an available slot.  All these are then annotated on the applicant's enlistment document (DD Form 1) usually in the form of an "Annex ," a copy of which is provided to the applicant to review prior to enlistment.<br>  <br>  That's it.<br>  <br>  Realize of course that the number of seats per class start date are limited.  This means that if it's full, the applicant may have to choose a later class date which usually entails a later ship date as well.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you both.

The downward reaction of the market is related to the fact that Obamash did not discuss or obtain the buy in of the various industries.  They recognize that with government spending increases, there will be government tax increases along the way.  So, better to sell off today for real value instead of losing value through taxation later.

The decline is the purging of fictitious value from the system; what he, Geithner, and the rest say can influence WHEN the decline will happen, but that it will happen eventually is a certainty.<br>  <br>  As for me, I love that the market is declining. I hope it keeps declining. DJIA at 3000? Bring it on. 2000? Even better. Why is that? Am I a socialist trying to bring down capitalism?<br>  <br>  Not at all. No, I want to see the market decline because I'm in my 20's, and will be a net saver for decades to come. Most people take precisely the wrong approach to investing - they're ecstatic when the market rises, but depressed when it falls.<br>  <br>  Truth is, the only people who should be saddened by a market decline are those who plan on selling in the next few years. Everyone else should be happy that equities prices are falling, and hope that they fall yet further.
gasquENMaa	A private prison is overseen by that state's Department of Corrections and has contracted the daily operation of the prison to a private security company. All legal obligations and standards are still in effect and monitored.<br>  <br>  The positive side of the privately run prison is the contract calls for them to operate at a minimum of 5% less than the state run counterparts.<br>  <br>  The negative side is that hiring practices are lower, pay and benefits are lower ( to help realize the 5% cost savings), training is substandard and level of care is far lower to all the above. <br>  <br>  I work in the Ohio prison system and we have two of our thirty two prisons contracted out privately. When the private companies started, they ran it with a lower pay scale. The 5% margin was nowhere close to being met. Although 5% does not sound like much, the monthly budget for the average prison in Ohio is running $1.5 million per month. 5% of this represents $75,000 per month. <br>  <br>  During inservice training, we questioned our bean counters where the monies are going for this allocation. We were informed that a full third ( 1/2 million per month) is for medical expenses. We bear a legal responsibility to maintain health care for incarcerated felons, who by their nature, did not care for themselves while on the streets. They are entering the system with major health issues and the taxpayers are footing this bill.<br>  <br>  Now the private companies are faced with a financial dilemna. The only way they can run their prison within the projected budget is to cut health care. Inmates are being denied basic health services and quite a few procedures that should be dealt with at our local hospital are being denied/ignored. The result is massive lawsuits that the state is losing ( the state is still the ultimate responsible party since they still oversee the private company.)<br>  <br>  The end result is that the private prison may sound good in theory, but in practice, it is failing the overall system. What is saved in the short term is being lost in the long term lawsuits that are being filed on a daily basis. <br>  <br>  If you look historically at states that use privatized prisons, such as Florida, Tennessee and Texas, you will see rampant lawsuits filed and won against them, an astounding rate of violence far in excess to the level of security for that facility ( this is due to the hiring practices/low pay rate/substandard training of the personnel) and higher costs than the state run counterparts. <br>  <br>  I can't offer any reasons why it still continues in spite of the facts that are clear for all to see.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps and you can find it useful.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	negatives: costs more because there is an additional layer of bonuses to pay out to the corporate owners of the prison.

We do need to keep Alaska though, they have been forgotten & neglected for some time.<br>  <br>  We should also re-elect our own president and let California and NY keep their savior: Obama.|`|ED433Q6Yaa	since we got here on the back of democracy and capitalism, maybe you should move to a socialist and let us fix what we have. lincoln thought enough to go to war over the south trying to secede. and lets not forget cal, ny and nj all have the highest tax rates and they are all at the top of the list of states needing money. socialist america!LOL|`|ss3QPHKIaa	Aww, but you wouldn't have anyone to call names anymore.|`|0925b6e49a69fe375d1a58ad2c4b8713aa	We wouldn't have to even consider that if the federal governnent hadn't gone around and federalized so much of what was obviously intended to be handled on a state by state basis.  Then, certain liberties would be protected nationwide, but differences could exist between states as their constituencies saw fit to govern themselves.<br>  <br>  Now, you can hardly name a single program that doesn't either start or end with federal help or intervention.  So much for state's rights.|`|AA11732055	No. Of course "the red states" are considered red due to the higher rate of the political party voters that reside there.

I have cancer and I can tell you without any question that you WILL die from it without very good insurance if you get it. In fact, without the insurance, most people that do develop cancer won't even be screened for it and will die an un-necessary early death because it wasn't caught early enough. SOME form of universal insurance is needed. BTW, cancer doesn't give a rat's patootie if you are a liberal or conservative, Republican or Democrat.|`|AA10187742	When the majority of countries using this type of healthcare are finding out it is not good as thought, when they are searching for better alternatives...................why are our Politicians bull headed in going this route I ask|`|ljmE8eLLaa	Once there, we'll all find out how universally we will be limited on our healthcare.

Government has their own healthcare, they should be put on medicare and medicade then they will realize how bad the idea is.  Problem with universal healthcare is that government can't handle what they already have (social security, medicare, medicade, welfare) and they want to add another program so they can mismanage.  Government has a terrible track record don't give them anything else until they can prove they can handle another program.|`|OQ12LRvuaa	Doctors aren't the problem is the government in the first place. They have to hire all kinds of people to met regulations. Medicare gets ripped off for billions every year and thats just for seniors. Universal health care would be awful in the USA. Doctors don't earn to much remember they go through a lot of schooling. So if they make 250k a year thats prob not all that much after they get raped by taxes and malpractice insurance. Theres the reason health care is so high.|`|uCW1cOcEaa	Probably not.  Consider this...most countries with Universal Health Care pay an insane amount of taxes.  I just got back from Canada, where they pay a great deal more in taxes than we do.  The bottom line is that you cannot have universal coverage without increasing taxes, on everyone (not just the rich).  Where else is the money going to come from?  I just don't see that happening in this country because everyone would be up in arms.

heFbG2FRaa	A solicitor has an obligation to act in the best interests of his or her client, irrespective of the nature of the retainer (i.e. whether it's no win, no fee, legal aid or an hourly rate)<br>  <br>  Based upon the fact that you have used the term solicitor I am going to assume you are in the UK. I was a solicitor in the UK for a number of years before I emigrated to the USA. <br>  <br>  Whether or not legal aid or no win, no fee is available to you depends not only on your level of income (in the case of Legal Aid, which is means tested) but the type of case. Legal Aid was phased out in 1999 for personal injury cases, paving the way for 'conditional fee agreements', also known as 'no win, no fee'. Companies like The Accident Group and Claims Direct thrived at this time, but as we know, they fell by the wayside as all they were really doing was selling high-interest credit to fund bogus after-the-event legal expenses insurance.<br>  Talk to a local solicitor about the options in your case. With the limited information you have given in your question it is impossible to give a complete answer.

Once you both get to his first duty assignment-you might be in a location that doesn't have a college offering a nursing major.  (This is also true if you join).  He might have misunderstood your question-certainly there's Tuition Assistance while you're active-duty to pursue a degree.

But the AF won't pay NOW for you to go to school, UNLESS you join AFROTC and qualify for an AFROTC scholarship-a possibility.<br>  I would say study up and take the CLEP Test to get your generals out of the way.  CLEP scores are also accepted at every accredited university in the US.  Other than that you can either join now-as Med Tech and go to school in your off duty time.  Or, wait until you and your BF are settled down, then start school.
u0My4f5uaa	They're both reserve components of the Air Force.  Unless called to federal duty, the National Guard is under the command of the state's governor and adjutant general.  National Guard units generally are prepared to launch aircraft in the case that there is a threat to the United States.  Some Air Force Bases were closed recently because air defense is being done almost completely by the ANG now.  My unit, the Vermont ANG (158th FW) is part of the Air Defense Command and is on five-minute alert, 24/7.  Many ANG units are stationed at civilian airports (mine is at Burlington International Airport).<br>  <br>  The reserve is used to bolster the active Air Force when necessary.  There are also Air Force Reserve stations.<br>  <br>  There are many similarities, but also some pretty large differences as well.  We all wear the same uniform, though.
AA11622716	In most states, the chief of police is appointed.  The sheriff is elected.  The police handle crimes within the city.  The sheriff handles crimes in the county, outside the city.  The sheriff also might run the county jail, act as process server, provide courtroom bailiffs, act in eviction cases, and have all sorts of duties.|`|CBx6qHztaa	Sheriff's are elected and head up counties.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	If you have the answer, why are you asking this question?<br>  <br>  The difference is jurisdiction.

I don't think the tax cuts are going to do much, but the added jobs that ultimately improve existing infrastructure will.<br>  <br>  This is, I believe, "Kainesian" economics, the stuff of Roosevelt's "New Deal", thought by some to have ended the last great depression.

One reason they are sinking, among many others because people like Mr. Deregulator, John McCain does not want regulation in private business.  The government, under Bush gave them a bail out plan of billions of dollars, not Barry.  This was the original bail out plan for the banks and Wall St.  Mr. Obama is doing everything he can.

If you want to wreck your life with wrong choices that is fine... Governments should not get involved in your private affairs as long as you are on your own, and/or in the company of other consenting adults only who also want to wreck their lives, and you are not affecting the rest of society by incurring any unwanted and/or unnecessary financial, physical or social burden upon others. <br>  <br>  But even then, a responsible individual should be aware of his or her actions at all times, and at least try not to behave in a way that is negative in any way to themselves, their family, their community the nation and ultimately to humanity itself. No one is perfect or completely good, no one! But we all have the responsibility to try to be for the good of us all! The minute any of us stops trying to do good and do things right we are all failing life!<br>  <br>  And, when it comes to homosexuality this research and analysis shows (from many areas of reference such a as Nature Laws, physical body mechanics and mental health among others) that homosexuality is a sexual dysfunction. And a dysfunction with deadly personal and health consequences not just for the individual but society as a whole as described later on in this chapter.<br>  <br>  The different areas analyzed are:<br>  <br>  1. First: (Sex MAIN reason IS procreation)<br>  2. Second:  (Incorrect Sex Mechanics).<br>  3. Third:  (Predictable Mathematical Error in Human behavior).<br>  4. Fourth:  (Homosexuality is NOT about Love).<br>  5. Fifth:  (Homosexuality practices/behavior cause disproportionably in the population severe if not deadly health consequences, clearly denoting it as an incorrect behavior).<br>  6. Sixth: (Psychoanalysis studies demonstrates Homosexuality to be some kind of gender fear, psychological trauma and/or neurosis).<br>  <br>  One of many examples on this extra burden/cost on all of us, ask yourselves this: Do you want to pay more taxes and medical premiums due to people's irresponsible sexual behaviors, which creates more unnecessary health hazards/costs on the system, which in turn is passed on to us the people? You see, this analysis points out that homosexuality is not just a matter of whether the question of homosexuality is one about personal freedom, and if this analysis on homosexuality is just being a "homophobic" attack on the topic at hand. This analysis is to determining what is wrong and what is right for all without politics or religion! And to show that you do not have to get into some philosophical or religious podium to look at this matter to realize that the truth of the matter is right in front of all of us...that homosexuality is just wrong.<br>  <br>  And yes! There is right and wrong! Judgment is part of life; it is the very essence of living and survival for all living thins including humanity. And just like we stand against our leaders when they do things wrong so should we all stand against things done wrong by all individuals when they also do things wrong, specially if the consequences affect us all in a very detrimental, and we must try and find a way to help them do right!<br>  <br>  On what I base my analysis and conclusion of Homosexuality been wrong?

Keep in mind gay marriage, immigration, reproductive choice are essentially all distraction issues.  They work to the advantage of those in power as they divide the general public and obfuscate the issues that affect our lives.  If you keep people fighting amongst themselves, they won't look at what you're doing.  But back to the question at hand, there's really no moral argument that can be made for denying homosexuals equality.|`|AA11286736	Biology. It is a proven fact that sexual orientation happens in the womb and is not a choice. How can you criminalize biology? Will you next criminalize being male? Or female? How about blue eyes? Marriage is only the natural outgrowth of two people wanting to spend the rest of their lives together, whatever their sexual orientation. Therefore, there is not a logical argument to criminalize same sex marriage.

TMkhlCCTaa	I think the consequences are high enough, maybe a little ridiculous.  I heard that paying all the fines, for a Breathalyzer in the car so you can work to pay the fines, paying the lawyer etc. it comes to over $6000.  I've heard that talking on a cell phone is as bad as driving drunk, but I have yet to see people punished as severely as they do drunk drivers.  What about the people who tailgate?  Apply makeup, read, look at a map etc while driving?  All these things distract the driver and have potential to kill innocent people.  I think that the punishment should fit the level of risk the driver is taking and not single out one group of lawbreakers.|`|ZQxCcG6qaa	uh hello? you can kill or seriously harm innocent bystanders!!! right there should be enough to be charged with attempted vehicular manslaughter anytime you get behind the wheel while intoxicated. not to mention the property damage that is associated with DUI accidents every year. did you know that in PA you actually get a harder punishment if your license needs renewed then if you were driving drunk..

PqtybcTFaa	Talk to a recruiter. Since this medium is for the most part one way conversation no one here can answer all your questions. Every situation is unique. A recruiter can open a dialogue with you and ask you the right questions so that they can give you the right answers.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking. When and if you make it through Boot Camp, your spouse should be able to be assigned wherever you are. Unless you are in an area where dependents are restricted from going. As far as the adoption thing... Having 3 dependents at a very junior paygrade is very difficult. The military can help but it is not the rescue package you seek. Yeah they will give you housing and a little extra money but trust me it aint enough when you are E-5 and Below. Even tougher if you spouse isnt working. All E-5 and below and some E-6's live below the national poverty line as far as pay. If i were you i would take a hard look at why your joining and consult with a recruiter.
Ot7PJrddaa	Your medical records should clear up their questions - as long as you weren't on meds for depression, anxiety or bi-polar you have no worries.  If you were on meds for anything but bi-polar and have been off of them for a year you will be fine as well.
2zym4J9xaa	99 is the highest score.  Its based on % of 4 sections of the ASVAB.   They use the points in each section for MOS purposes.  Only 4 select sections are used for an overall ASVAB score.  I scored the 99, but I also scored perfect on all the sections and never missed one question.<br>  <br>  Depending on your MOS chosen... this will determine which is a good score for you.  The higher your score, the more MOS's will be available to you.<br>  <br>  The overall ASVAB score is -- AFQT = 2(VE) + (AR) + (MK)<br>  <br>  VE = WK + PC... then using a  chart to get the VE score.<br>  <br>  These are used for the ASVAB overall score:<br>  <br>  WK - Word Knowledge <br>  PC - Paragraph Comprehension <br>  AR - Arithmetic Reasoning <br>  MK - Mathematics Knowledge <br>  <br>  <br>  These arn't used for the ASVAB overall score:<br>  <br>  GS - General Science<br>  AS - Auto and Shop<br>  MC - Mechanical Comprehension<br>  EI - Electronics Information<br>  AS - Assembling Objects|`|n2oEhdZiaa	Yeah, you need to take the real ASVAB and have a recruiter explain to you how to interpret the results.  It is not based on percentages.  Certain questions are weighed more than others and certain sections are weighed more than others depending on what line score is being calculated or the AFQT.  The ASVAB is definately not a traditionally scored test.|`|5sjvBstfaa	ok I took my ASVAB last May on my 17th birthday.<br>  What is your actual score?<br>  Like my total ASVAB score was 54<br>  but your score gets broken down by different areas.<br>  So u would need your actual score to know if you did well or not.<br>  For joining the military I know they would want males to get a 34 and higher and females to get at least a 50.<br>  They should tell you what you recieved..|`|wrLu93C9aa	Ask your recruiter!

Most will give significantly reduced tuition to members of the Guard.  You will also be eligible for the GI Bill.  <br>  <br>  Finishing a degree on active duty would seem to be a very difficult thing to do.  But, if you do finish your degree while enlisted, you would need to get a conditional discharge pending your acceptance into OTS.  Or, you could finish your enlistment contract and apply after.  This is how the National Guard works, so it may vary for active duty.<br>  <br>  You could also try Army Warrant Officer Candidate School.  No degree needed.  If flying helicopters interests you, you might want to look into that.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	If your grades aren't good enough to qualify for a ROTC scholarship.<br>  <br>  Then chances are, your grades aren't good enough to be competetive for OTS either.<br>  <br>  You will need around a 3.5 GPA to be admitted to OTS.<br>  <br>  But yes, at any time you earn your BS degree, you can apply for AF OTS.<br>  <br>  But again, it is competetive and you really need a great GPA.

yX4xVukPaa	The queen is useful constitutional balance. She is apolitical, impossible to remove and therefore highly respected, and she is, nominally at least, the head of state.<br>  <br>  At times when there are constitutional problems or in emergencies, the queen can be immensely useful. For example when Chamberlin resigned in the early days of World War 2, it was necessary to choose a new prime minister quickly. Although the decision was actually made by senior members of government and officials, it was the rule that the queen may appoint whomsoever she wishes that made it possible to appoint Winston Churchill, even though he had no been elected prime minister, or ever led a political party.<br>  <br>  In a constitutional crisis one can also see possibilities for the use of Royal powers which are usually used by the government. For example, imagine that a nationalist government tries to override devolved government in Scotland. This is technically legal possible, but will inevitably cause a constitutional crisis. One way in which it might be avoided would be for the queen to refuse the royal assent and dissolve parliament to precipitate new elections. Although the decision to take that course of action would not be hers alone, the existence of the monarchy allows an ultimate checking power against executive government.<br>  <br>  Lastly, the queen usefully represents the separation of the country from the government. Students in the UK can happily criticise the prime minister or pelt him with eggs, without being "unpatriotic" in any sense, because he is only the head of a transitory and fallible government. She is the head of a thousand year old country, and never has to make political decision which would cause people to want to throw things at her. It's a neat division.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	The prime minister is practically the queen too. Neither are really in charge. The whole hierarchy as we see it is totally false. The people who REALLY make the decisions are never in the news.

The second honor was the Chairmanship of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC). Following the elections of 2006, Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) appointed Chuck to serve as Vice Chair of the Democratic Conference, the number three position on the Democratic Leadership team and asked him to chair the Joint Economic Committee (JEC), which oversees economic policy in the Senate.

AA10274478	I have had some experience with the CPS system. <br>  If you were taken away and put into foster care because of your mother's yelling, they would put her name in the Registry of Abuse and Neglect and she would be automatically fired from her job and be unable to get any kind of job working around children or vulnerable adults. The state will try to force her to pay child support but she will be unable to do it, having lost her job and unable to get another!<br>  <br>  Many foster parents yell anyway, and get away with it because there is a shortage of foster homes.<br>  <br>  Most kids who get yelled at find a way to put up with it until they turn eighteen.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Foster care can be just as bad but you need to do something.  Does your mother drink or do drugs?  Does she have coping and anger problems?  It could be that she needs help.  But you shouldn't have to live like that.  Yes, you can go yourself but tell a teacher.  A teacher is required to help you and you need some support.  It makes no difference that your mother is a teacher too.<br>  <br>  It depends on what the outcome of this is as to whether she would lose her license.  If she agrees to get help, probably not.<br>  <br>  Also, you do not need to have visible bruises for a temp removal order.  Sweetie, do you have any relatives you could live with?  A close friend's family?  My heart is just breaking for you.|`|29a2wm7Eaa	There are different kinds of abuse.  What your friend is talking about is called physical abuse (the kind that leaves bruises).  When somebody is mean to you all the time it's called emotional abuse.  Like the other poster said, you need to talk to a teacher or guidance counsellor at school.  They can help.  <br>  <br>  Maybe the best thing that could happen wouldn't be foster care, but some help for your mom and you so you could live happily together.

You may go and sign a complaint. The prosecutor will determine if there is enough evidence. Since it was your child that has the alcohol she or he may be a witness. You child will have to testify that this person gave alcohol to your child. Then you have your child admitting to being in illegal possession and maybe consumption of alcohol. The state may then charge your child with the offenses and use the testimony as evidence. You are best off discussing the use of alcohol with your child.|`|kiOD8s8Kaa	Minnesota Statutes 340A.503 subdivision 2 states, "It is unlawful for any person to sell, barter, furnish, or give alcoholic beverages to a person under 21 years of age."

O5DZvc0Xaa	"Creature" is accurate, as unbelievable as it may seem.<br>  <br>  The Federal Reserve system is a private, non-governmental corporation owned by its shareholders (mostly foreign banking families).<br>  <br>  The Treasury is part of the Federal government, but after the Banker Takeover Bill was passed last year (commonly referred to as the "Bailout") the Treasury was given enormous, unconstitutional power. And considering the revolving door between the finance industry, the Fed, and the Treasury department, this is a major problem, especially considering the total lack of congressional oversight.<br>  <br>  If you actually read the Banker Takeover Empowerment and Immunity Bill (H.R. 1424) it sets up an "oversight" committee comprised of the Fed Chairman, the Treasury Sec. and a handful of other people who have a severe conflict of interest. It is the very epitome of "foxes guarding the henhouse."<br>  <br>  EDIT: Correction: That oversight committee was stipulated in the original bill, which I read before it was voted down. The Senate bill, which passed, actually has slightly different language. The "Oversight Panel" is still limited to 5 members, each appointed by key members of the House and Senate. Not as bad, but still not satisfactory, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  For all intents and purposes, the Treasury has been merged with the Fed to form an all-powerful economic entity with no real Congressional oversight.<br>  <br>  Another thing I would like to point out... Remember when the "Bailout" bill was shot down the first time by the H of Reps? Do you remember what the Fed did? They injected several hundred billion dollars into the economy ANYWAYS, the very next day, proving that they never needed the permission of Congress to do this. Therefore, the bill clearly had an ulterior motive. Namely, the power consolidation and protection from oversight that I have already discussed.<br>  <br>  A lot of people still throw around this "700 billion" figure. This number is misleading. The bill was more like a blank check. I quote:<br>  <br>  "such authority shall be limited to $700,000,000,000 outstanding at ANY ONE TIME." (see page 41 of attached PDF).<br>  <br>  The real number of funds associated with TARP is now upwards of 9 trillion.

I won't go into that right now.|`|ctcCPMdCaa	The Federal Reserve has no oversight by the U.S. government.  At all.<br>  <br>  "The Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means basicly that, there is no other agency in government than can overrule the actions that we take." -- Alan Greenspan<br>  <br>  At 7:45:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol3mEe8TH7w" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol3mEe8TH...</a><br>  <br>  It is completely private.|`|Izw8c3uNaa	They are incompentent GOV staff that prints money on XEROX machines for corrupt banks and investors|`|d20feb0d03f94b65cc82fb1a12566011aa	The Treasury is a Department of the government. Period.<br>  <br>  The Federal Reserve is a unique legal entity that can be described as an independent government agency with member bank participation. It is organized with a 100% government agency at the top (the Board of Governors), and branches beneath them that are organized like corporations with member banks as shareholders.(Ref: <a href="http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/fed101/structure/" rel="nofollow">http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/f...</a> , <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/faq/faqfrs.htm#4" rel="nofollow">http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinf...</a> )<br>  <br>  The Board of Governors are all appointed for 14-year terms by the president and confirmed by congress. It operates per it's charter and laws set by congress. it is overseen by congress. There is no structure or mechanism for private ownership at this level; it is a government agency. You can confirm this from a number of government sites that list it as a government agency (e.g. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/independent-agencies.html)" rel="nofollow">http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/ind...</a> Board members are forbidden by law to have any economic interest in a private bank. (Ref: Title 12 chapter 3 of the U.S. Legal Code). The Board determines monetary policy and provides high level oversight of the branches. <br>  <br>  The 12 branches can be considered highly regulated private corporations. Member banks are required to buy shares in their branch. Each bank has one vote.  They can vote for 6 of their 9 board members, the other 3 are appointed by the Board of Governors.  Though the branches are called non-profit, the member banks get a standard 6% dividend on their shares. The remaining 'profit' is turned over to the Treasury at the end of the year. <br>  <br>  For confirmation on this, check out how Hoovers classifies them: <br>  <a href="http://www.hoovers.com/free/search/simple/xmillion/index.xhtml?query_string=Federal+Reserve&which=company&page=1&x=91&y=2#HooversCompanyNameMatchesH2" rel="nofollow">http://www.hoovers.com/free/search/simpl...</a> <br>  <br>  And those shares that the member banks own? Some say there are so many restrictions that it falls short of true ownership<br>  <br>  From Edward Griffin, himself (<a href="http://www.bigeye.com/griffin.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigeye.com/griffin.htm)</a><br>  <br>  "It's a hybrid, part corporation and part government, part private, part government.<br>  .. <br>  Every bank that's in the system is an owner of the Federal Reserve...  But that's as far as it goes because those stock certificates do not carry with them any of the attributes of private ownership. For example, the holders of these certificates cannot sell them. If you can't sell something then you don't really own it, that's one of the tests of ownership, your ability to dispose of it. You cannot sell it. Furthermore the larger banks put up more money than the smaller banks, it's a ratio to their assets, so the larger banks have more stock certificates in the system than the small ones and yet regardless of the number that they hold, every bank has just one vote. There's another violation of the principle of private ownership. Furthermore that vote doesn't buy them anything. They can't vote for anything of substance; they cannot vote for their national management which is the most important thing, isn't it? The board of directors and chairman of the Federal Reserve System are appointed by the President, they're not elected by the banks that are part of the system, the President does that."|`|4bqm1zTCaa	Fed Reserve is private and owned by 12 families.|`|Souvww0maa	The US Treasury Department is an entity of the US Government.

They might as well wear sheets.<br>  <br>  Urban and suburban schools are much better though.|`|oYaGeDewaa	I approve this message|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Actually, that is part of the problem.  I go to the New York Post cartoon (the chimp one) for proof of this.<br>  <br>  Polls done found that nearly every black person, including Republican ones, felt that the New York Post and the author of the cartoon should apologize for "extremely offensive and racist material."<br>  <br>  On the other hand, white people nearly en masse said it was not racist, and there was no real problem here.<br>  <br>  Why the disconnect?<br>  <br>  Well, it is because white people really aren't racist.  They haven't used racism overall in some time, and so didn't actually remember that the "black people are chimps/apes/monkeys" epithets were once the norm and probably the most used racial epithets after the N-word.  They didn't see it as racist because they literally did not remember that it was once a racist term.<br>  <br>  It is much easier to remember racism when one is the victim then when one was the perpetrator.  Black people saw it as racist because they remember the time when it was.  White people did not.  That is why there was such a disconnect there.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Then there is also the problem of what we have accepted as race equality.  White people insist they have accepted black people, and to a point they are correct.<br>  <br>  But notice who white people put up as proof that they have accepted black people.  They put up people like Colin Powell, Condoleeza Rice, Wayne Brady, Bill Cosby, Oprah, etc.  Well, all of these are black people who succeeded in white culture.  That is not to attack them, the success of anyone should be celebrated; and these are no different.  But the point is, white people see race equality as being that they allowed black people to join their culture and that black people can succeed in their culture.<br>  <br>  That is part of ending racism, but it is not all of it.  Those that succeeded in black culture are held up as examples of the downfall of society, morally bankrupt, etc.<br>  <br>  Malcolm X, Dr. Dre, etc.   These guys are shown as evil, morally wrong, unacceptable.  Why?  They succeeded just as much as Wayne Brady or Michael Steele.  The difference between Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. is what culture they fought for.  MLK Jr. is held up as the greatest example because he tried to get it where black people would be accepted in white culture.  Malcolm X is held up as a bad example because he succeeded in black culture and tried to make it the equal of white culture.<br>  <br>  That is also part of the problem.  It is not enough to simply accept black people, as long as they are just like you.  What is required is that black culture must also be accepted as having worth.<br>  <br>  That does not mean that you have to accept black culture as your own, by no means.  But we can no longer continue to insist that white culture is better, that you cannot be a good person unless you are a part of white culture.  <br>  <br>  The truth is that white people are still the gatekeepers.  They are still the judges for what is considered acceptable and unacceptable, what is allowed and what is deemed wrong.  And that means for race relations to get truly equal, white people are going to have to accept and acknowledge that black culture has value and is worth having around.|`|XwtmNIMOaa	I defiantly agree that for many of our generation race is not an issue.

nskRhMMlaa	They keep trying because- if no one has guns- then they are more in control. The liberals have so many communist tendencies. If they take away our guns- they have much more power over us. Of course the crime rate goes through the roof-- all the gun-owners who are good, law-abiding citizens will get rid of their guns when the gun-ban is enacted. The people who are not law-abiding will have no feel no responsibility to obey the law and give up the guns. And then the government has successfully weeded the guns out of the hands of the responsible and placed them only in the hands of the dangerous people - the law-breakers. <br>  <br>  Whenever a dictator comes into power, the first thing that happens is everyone's guns are taken away from them. If they take the people's right to defend themselves away- they create a dependent and defenseless nation of wusses.|`|N8Hkn8DJaa	What is inalienable about the right to own a gun? really?

yeu09pfOaa	The Boulevard is usually the grassy area between the street and the sidewalk ....on a residential street anyway ....this is the area  that you are required to mow ... but do not actually own .... as the city can put anything they want in this area ... signs, electrical boxes, water mains, cable boxes,  stuff like that|`|hzAidxdkaa	don't listen to the first answer... .. a boulevard is the area between the line on the passenger side of your car and the grass or edge of the road... also known as a breakdown lane
rYE9VLQdaa	This may seem a bad idea to you as you seem like a conservative, but you should contact your local ACLU. Forcing the students to praise Obama would be akin to forcing the students to praise Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and etc. Yes most people see the ACLU as far left liberals but their goal as they see it is to protect people's freedom from this very kind of thing. By the way a consider my self a conservative (NOT a neoconservative mind you) and I would call the ACLU on this one.|`|AA12103453	Yeah. The report can be 75% of the grade(or even 50%) and since they got a 0% there is NO way they can pass. So they are failing the class for the semester. From there you can start on trying to get a lawsuit against the school, but good luck with that. I agree that the report was wrong, and they shouldn't have been expected to write it. If it had been during the election you'd have a better try in proving why it was illegal to expect them to write it.|`|Xpd9v2lvaa	If this is true, which it really doesn't sound like it, then no, they cannot.|`|AA12146958	. Schools decide what is mandatory but this scenario you have asked is fictional.|`|vA7Iq6FSaa	The ACLU is supposed to help people like you, but I think you might be on the wrong side of the issue, sorry.|`|YcXB2bVBaa	no|`|nAlyuyaDaa	Hm... This sounds made up, but I'll answer it just to humor you.<br>  <br>  This question concerns basic First Amendment(1A) rights; specifically, it concerns freedom of speech.  The 1A says, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."  <br>  <br>  The Supreme Court of the United States addressed speech in school in the Tinker v. Des Moines ICSD case (393 U.S. 503), where they held in a 7-2 decision that the First Amendment applied to public schools, and that administrators would have to demonstrate constitutionally valid reasons for any specific regulation of speech in the classroom.  Other than regulation of indecency, school newspapers, and prevention of speech promoting illegal drug use, the Court has found few exceptions to this doctrine.  In this case, I believe that regulation of speech also would encompass the school compelling students to write about supporting Obama.  An assignment requiring them to simply write about Obama would be allowed, however, because the school isn't forcing the student to make a political stand on a particular issue.<br>  <br>  This also deals with coerced speech, as I stated above.  In the West Virginia v. Barnette case, (319 U.S. 624), Justice Jackson opined that, "If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein."  This means that a school official cannot compel a student to speak about a political stance that they do not believe in.  <br>  <br>  Simply put, if someone were to take this decision to the school board and still have their children receive a failing grade, they could challenge the school board in civil court.  Almost any court would see this as compelled speech being regulated by the school, and it would not be allowed.  It goes against all the case law firmly established by the Supreme Court.|`|UL1I46ylaa	Thats really stupid of the school, i dont think that they can do that.

tjLbXhtEaa	Yes they will-- a background check will show up your past.<br>  SO be upfront with your application, type up a letter to go with your application explaining the situation. The background check will not show details. You need to fight for yourself, man up to your past and that should help you land a job.

AA11401784	Crime has a lot of levels. Minor crimes are called 'offenses', and are usually just a violation of a general rule. Speeding, jaywalking, minor shoplifting, and stuff like that are some kinds of offenses. When someone is cited for an offense, the officer will just issue a citation that has a summons on it, and the offender signs the citation as a promise to appear in court or to mail in the fine money. Because you sign the citation or ticket, you've made a promise to appear or plead guilty and pay. If you don't appear, a warrant is issued for your arrest, and then you are made to physically appear in court.<br>  <br>  Other crimes include misdemeanors, where you may also be allowed to sign a ticket. There are also felonies, where you usually have to post a cash or valuables bail in order to leave custody.<br>  <br>  - Stuart|`|AaXl3vcCaa	they can still send you to jail at court if it is bad enough, but mostly they just give you a fine or community service or probation|`|AA10425248	Generally, when you are cited and released, you sign a promise to appear.  This is generally only available for infractions and some misdemeanors.<br>  <br>  For an infraction, if you fail to appear as promised, the court can find you guilty, charge you with the fine, and refer it to civil collections (which can result in a hold on your driver's license, affect your credit and increase your fine amount).<br>  <br>  For a misdemeanor, a failure to appear is a crime in itself, and a missed appearance can (and often does) result in a warrant being issued for your arrest.<br>  <br>  Basically, go to court on your scheduled date, or the Sheriff's Department will escort you there.|`|gtr3CGU5aa	I believe when your name is called out in court, the judge asks you if you want to contest it.  I never contest it.  So then the judge arranges a certain amount of time for you to pay the ticket.  If you do not pay the ticket within that amount of time - a warrant will go out for your arrest.
