20090220073047AANqjQp	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	College Advice? Please Help!!?	I started my freshman year this past fall at Cal Poly Pomona, about 40 minutes away from my home. I commute from home, it was a convenient choice because my boyfriend of over a year planned to go there too, plus I wouldn't have to quit my job. Because of the drive and my work schedule I cram all my classes into Tuesdays and Thursdays (my boyfriend and I carpool) so that I can work MWF, and I get weekends for myself.      As a kid, my parents were very overprotective and didn't let me do a lot of things. (Go to school dances, spend the night at friends houses.. etc etc) It wasn't extreme, I see now that it was for my best, and I've learned a lot from the way my parents raised me, even if I dont agree with it all.       So now that I am in college, I've started to feel as if I made the wrong choice in a school. Don't get me wrong, its a great school and has such a pretty campus, but with every day that passes I start to realize more and more that the school just isnt for me. I feel like; all my life I was told what to do and how to do it, and the one time where I could go out and be on my own for once, I chose not too. And i'm really regretting now. So often I feel that I am missing out on the 'college experience' and that this was not at all how I imagined myself.       Besides that, I dont feel intellectually challenged in any of my classes. I know that I've only been there for 2 quarters... but I have put little to no effort into any of my classes/midterms/finals and still come out doing great. I don't have a lot of incentive to push myself.      I want to be succesful. I want to be proud of what I've achieved. I don't know what to do.      Obviously an option here would be to transfer to another university. After thinking about it, I would want to go to either UCSB or Cal Poly SLO. They are both great schools and are just far enough away from home. The only thing is that I missed the application time for next fall, so I wouldnt be able to transfer until my 3rd year. So at that point, would it even be worth it?? To do half of my schooling at CPP and then switch?      My boyfriend is not an issue. He is so supportive and just wants whats best for me :)      What should I do?

20090220073633AAkGw76	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Proof read my Jekyll and Hyde english essay?	Is “The Strange Case of dr jekyll and mr hyde” a typical gothic novel?   “Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde” is described by many as a gothic novel.  Gothic Novels reached the climax of their popularity in the late Victorian period, however they are still being published today, showing an undying thirst for them. The recognised criteria for a gothic novel include: the story of an outsider, one who does not fit in to society, a misfit. They can explore the boundaries of evil and good and even try to break them. In gothic novels the weather tends to be of a cold, dark nature to signify the personality of the character. Animals associated with fear are often included and generally there is a form of civil unrest due to the actions of the title character. The story is more often than not characterised by mystery and supernatural horror.   A reason why i think that “Jekyll and Hyde” is a typical gothic novel is because of the description of scenery. The street upon which Jekyll/Hyde resides is “on the left hand”, immediately this tells me that the house has an air of evil about it, in religious culture the left hand is often associated with being led astray, as it says in the Bible in the book of Ecclesiastes "A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.", this signifies that those who choose the right hand choose the path of good; those who choose the left are easily corrupted; also it is associated with evil because of the etymology of the word "sinister” which in Anglo French reads as "senestre" meaning on the left and from the Latin "sinistr-" meaning on the left side. The house is “sinister” and “thrust forward”, which tells me that it is a dark, menacing place, it being thrust forward tells me that it does not fit in nor conform with anyone or anything else.   Another reason is the story revolves around the constant struggle that “man is not truly one, but truly two”, this details that all men have a good side but we are constantly at war with our impulses to do evil. In this story Dr. Jekyll breaks the bounds between the two and becomes utterly consumed by evil.  This is similar to another gothic novel- Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein”. In this story the bounds are between life and death- “Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds”. This struggle presents the weakness of man in regards to resisting temptation, and is a very common feature of a gothic novel.   A different reason is because of Mr. Hyde himself. he is described as “a little man who was stumping”. This allows me to imagine that because of his size and stature he is not a whole person; something is missing; a vital piece of the puzzle that forms a human. Hyde is also described as a “damned Juggernaut”. In my opinion this word was used as it can have many meanings- it could mean a “large, overpowering, destructive force”. This could signify the evil that is devouring Jekyll. Or it could mean- “anything requiring a cruel sacrifice”. I believe that Jekyll is cruelly sacrificing his goodness for the darkness which lies within not only him but every other human being. There is a significant event that occurs within the story which gives us a sample of his true nature- “the man trampled calmly over the child’s body”. The very thought of this incident sends a shiver down my spine and evokes anger within me, the fact that he did it in a calm manner tells me that he has not one ounce of remorse, not for the girl nor her family and would not think twice about repeating his actions. Also, weather in gothic novels is often symbolic of the character; the fact that the incident occurred on “a black winter morning” tells me that Hyde has a black heart and is a cold, slippery character. I think because it is morning, which is when the sun usually rises, it signifies the rise of the hold that evil has over Jekyll.

20090203125305AAKFxdd	Education & Reference;Teaching	Am i being laughed at?	Story here:   It all started around December at a school party, most of the people were dancing(obviously) and so was i, later i had the idea to dance weird on purpose by doing that i had pretty much almost every ones attention from the people at higher classes, some of them even danced with me. It went like this till February(this day) I was dancing like i always did and some people actually joined me and i haven't had the feeling that people were making fun of me.      I was in the middle with some other people next to me, there were like more than 10 boys and girls watching me they didn't point at me laughing but they did laugh, they also asked me question but no questions like: Are you a retard or You're gay and other things related to that. It was fine until a teacher walked up to me and told me that they were laughing at me. She also said that those people i was with were bullies. I think that this is just bullshit. I've met them before and they respect but there was one guy that attempted to bully me but failed(he respects me now to)      The question is:   Did they laugh at me or not?   I want to proof my teacher wrong.

So I'm 16, in year 11, and currently studying in a small school unit after being away from school for the whole of the year 10 due to illness.      This year i am taking my GCSEs, and i'm being entered for 4 and a half;      Maths, English, Science, General studies, and Art (being the half).      My grades were originally of A* standard, apart from maths which I'm not sure of because I am believed to suffer from dyscalculia (currently undergoing tests), Although as I've been ill I believe my grades have dramatically dropped.      In the future I wish to enter Sheffield university and take Korean studies, which I believe requires at least BBB at A-level.      I'm planning to en-role in college this year, with the knowledge that I must first bulk up my GCSEs before being able to enter for A-level courses, but I'm not sure how to go about this process...      Also, I'd like to be able to achieve C in all of my GCSEs for this year, but I'm unsure of what I must know to be able to achieve a C in Maths, Science, Art, and General studies (I'm fine with English).      I'm basically getting very confused and frustrated, and nothing is making sense to me.      Thank you for any help and advice, I apologise if this totally nonsensical but I really am very flustered! x

Ok so last semester, fall of 2008, I started community college and I receive financial aid. I did awful do to attendence reasons and ended up with a GPA of 1.00--1 B, 2 F's and a W. This semester isn't starting off that great either--two of four of my classes I have been withdrawn from already due to attendence. My bad attendence is not because I am lazy or do not want to do the work, it's because of babysitting issues.

My question here is if I obtain decent grades with my remaining two classes, will I still be eligible for aid next semester? Do the "W" grades hurt my GPA? Please help! Thanks in advance!

I was wondering if anyone out there has a child with a mild to moderate developmental and/or physical disability who plays in Little League baseball in their area.  My 8 year old son has multiple learning disabilities and some motor skill issues from being hit by a car a few years ago. You really wouldn't know unless you really interacted with him.  I recently put him in our local LL Baseball league.  I'm kind of worried because a lot of these kids have be playing for a while and my son is new so he doesn't really know how to play the game.  But they are also very good at it with the throwing and catching. Some of them are also very competitive.  My son takes a long time to learn sometimes and I worry that some of the kids yelling at him for making mistakes will start to get to him. He told me he likes to play when I asked him and his coach told him he did a good job at the end of practice.  When I enrolled him I wanted him to have fun,  but I didn't take into consideration the competitiveness of his teammates.  I didn't tell the coach about his issues because I didn't want him to judge him ahead of time.  But now I worry that I jumped the gun when I enrolled him.  I don't know what to do.  Does anyone out there have a child with these issues that plays LL?  How was their experience?

Desired consumption and desired investment are given by       Cd= 3000 - 2000r + 0.10Y    Id= 1000 - 4000r    where Y is output and r is the expected real interest rate.       (a) Find the real interest rate that clears the goods market. Assume that output equals full-employment output.    (b) Calculate the amount of saving, investment, and consumption in equilibrium.    (c) If a shock to wealth causes desired consumption to decline by 200 (so that the new equation for desired consumption is Cd = 2800 - 2000r + 0.10Y), find the equilibrium real interest rate, saving, investment, and consumption.

20090220095458AAaf6V0	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How will a college be different from high school?	I am in my senior year of high school and it feels pretty strange. The peer pressure is so strong and I feel it affecting me a little bit. When people try to be themselves meaning that they don't want to talk to others or join other groups everyone else thinks their weird. This is so BS, the real life is not like this, in fact the real world respects others more than people in high school. I don't have a particular group I hang with or any clubs but I have a couple of close friends. But if these people don't have a certain group nobody cares about them. Why does high school suck so much? I took the train with 3 people one day and this one person seemed to hate my school so much. I know that there are more people like this at my school. In August I will be starting undergrad at a commuter student because I do not even want to be part of the social life because it is sooo ******** stupid. I get good grades and I believe that matters the most. Why should a student get pressured into getting a social life? I have a loving family and am very close to my relatives, even more than my friends. I just don't know why people in h.s are such pricks. I tried to stay individualized but I just notice that some people don't talk to me because they don't know me or something. But I have people to talk to. How will college be different? Will people be bad just like in high school or what? I need some input. Thanks a lot yall.

They did poorly (1500-1700), although they all had been in the top 4-10% of PSAT takers. They are generally smart girls and good test takers, so we have relatively high expectations for them.    My husband and I are debating whether to spend the big bucks on one of those SAT reviews or if we could do our own with help from their math teacher and test prep books (I am a college English teacher, so I could probably tutor them in the language portion).    Any stats on which works better?
