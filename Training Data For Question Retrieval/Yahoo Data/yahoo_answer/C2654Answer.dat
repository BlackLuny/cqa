L9xbnUfoaa	Well... The hairdresser might have snipped him in the wrong place, if ya get what I mean. Either that or they snipped a gentle area around that region.|`|50WCN0graa	Hmm..... maybe you shouldn't take him back there. Most Petsmarts Grooming Center have windows that the customers can see into, so I would doubt that they harmed him.... still, I wouldn't take the risk. Take him somewhere else next time. You don't see any injuries on his body, do you? Where he may have been snipped or something?    Maybe he feels embarrassed by his cut? I know that sounds silly, but my dog gets upset when we take his collar off. He nudges us and wants us to put it back on. I think the dog's coats can be like that, too. It gives them security, so if they get a drastic haircut, they may feel insecure.|`|cvIcBH7Waa	he is used to having longer hair|`|QDZjhTGqaa	Don't take him to that pet place anymore, find a professional groomer and insist on staying with your dog the entire time. Dog's have weird stuff happen to them at those places sometimes,in particular I've heard stories about Petco, but other places have it happen also. Some dogs have died because the groomer walks away for a minute and the dog strangles himself on the leash, I'm not saying that's what happened, I'm just saying you must be careful.    Hope I could help :)|`|jOxttTfjaa	he cud just b feelin funny cuz his furs gon, he cud feel upset that u did this to him, or sumthin cudv happened there 2 scare him, i wud take him 2 a vet or at least fone 1 up 4 advice!!!!|`|RAtgv9GHaa	They could have cut him.  Check his whole body,then tell the vet,or fix It yourself.  Then,you can go to the vet if he is still sad.  ALSO: if his tail is between his legs,It means he is unhappy.|`|e02677ed79c964d6416c97482df1bb1daa	your dog is upset with you right now give the dog time|`|HtHFHfDKaa	Sounds like someone there abused him|`|TZDQI6v4aa	Maybe he needs his stink glands emptied go to your vet as that is what it sounds like
77769e8a88b0e3466e3393f4f24e252eaa	I am a groomer.  This is a pretty unorthodox way to groom a dog....  And yes, its mean.    Water you use to wash a dog with is meant to be lukewarm...  Not as hot as you or I would bathe in, but not too cold where it would cause the dog discomfort (and CERTAINLY not from-a-hose cold...)    If the dog was in distress, yes, he should have stopped.  He's going to develop a fear to water and be a terror to groom in the future.  Please have him stop bathing him this way.  In my salon, its only 20 bucks for a quick wash on a pitbull.  Have him spend a buck and make his dog more comfortable.|`|AA10072754	hell yeah i would scream too!!!  You know how much getting sprayed with a water hose hurts?    I have never had an issue bathing my dogs outside with cold water in the summer months.  In fact they enjoy it...but I don't spray them either.  I just put the hose (or a cup) over their body and rinse them.|`|CA7lEkYIaa	i dont understand why the dog would cry like that but i have to staffys one hates water the other loves it  but when it comes to bath time i do it in my bath tub with warm water but cold water stil should not cause this reaction ?

You should take him to the vets. A cat coughing could be serious such as fluid on the chest/ lungs or heart problems. It could be nothing but you should certainly get it checked out. Your vet won't laugh at you as it's better being safe that sorry.|`|MPC6JXQNaa	dust, keep the house clean and the area the cat is mostly playing|`|Oi1S2DhMaa	1. dust keep house clean  2.allergies ask vet  3.cold go to vet  4. dry throat keep hydrated  5.or just a hair ball give brush him  6. fuild in the lungs take to vet NOW|`|AA11287657	It could be hairballs.  I buy "catgrass" plants from the local plant store and give my cat a few blades of it every day - it dosen;t need anymore than that.  Alternatively you can buy the specially formulated "hairball" cat foods available or talk to your vet.  Probably best to take your cat to vet anyway to rule out cat flu or some other possible problem - better to be safe than sorry with your "babies".  Hope it goes well for you.|`|1y84mVoMaa	the reason why cats all ways cough they mite have a hairball in  you can buy some cut grass to help him get rid of it                           :)las08
AA10072754	Pedigree is HORRIBLE for dogs.  On the other hand, with all of its grains and such...not too bad for other animals.  Makes a fine treat for goats, horses, rats, and other small animals.    NR isn't that great but its the cheapest "good" thing you can find.  Canide (sorry thats probably spelled wrong) is also pretty good.      Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul is the best cheaper food I found out there...but its harder to find...so if you can find it go for it|`|Vpf8q7xkaa	I'd see if they sell Canidae near you.  It's a decent food and fairly affordable for the quality.|`|zddn90Afaa	I feed my lab TLC Whole Life Pet Food, they deliver the dog food right to your house for free, Canada or USA, it is all natural and  great for all ages and breeds, check out their website at www.tlcpetfood.com, trust me you won't be disappointed, the ingredients are wholesome and with lots of good healthy stuff a dog should really have with no fillers!|`|ff243f137b1418459da4e7a0cc73aef7aa	Science Diet...its great for dogs and their coats!|`|26PPwzrWaa	Canidae and chicken soup for the dog lovers soul are good foods that are affordable. They are not the best kibble out there, but they are by no means the worst.     Look into a raw diet. It is the healthiest and can be the cheapest diet for carnivorous pets. A general rule is to stay under a dollar per pound.   www.bigdogsporch.com can help you with any diet you choose.    The natures recipe doesnt look bad, but it is lacking.|`|I1L2nuH6aa	I switched my pups from Pedigree to Innova dry puppy food after checking out the dog food rating link below. Take a look at it, find ones that most suit your dogs needs and most of the manufacturer's have websites to show who sells and that way you can also find who has it for the lowest price.
w4DIPHf1aa	Yeesh cycle with the fish you want..    you can cycle a tank with anything if your careful and go slow.    Buy a bottle of seachem stability to help.    In that tank.....Add 3 male guppies first.    Find out what there feeding them at the pet store and buy that.    first day don't feed them or feed them a tiny tiny amount, leave no uneaten food. Start using stability as directed.    next feed them 2 tiny meals    day 3 do a 20% water change        next week add 2-3 neons..no stability needed, if you have some left over add one cap with the fish    next week 2-3 neons, again no food the first day,       Most fish are rarely interested in food there first day, usually to nervous to eat. that uneaten food pollutes the tank and your tank is in  a fragile state at this time so you want to avoid these circumstances      etc..      just go slow and do 2 15% water changes a week for the first month.    after that one 15% change a week        add fish slowly lets teh bacteria colony build up to the new ammonia production of the new fish.    fishless cycles leave to much for chance and can take up to 6 weeks.    People who have been suckered into buying fish test kits do fishless cycles so they can use there kit for once.    Good choice getting a bowfront....smart tank.    good luck!!!|`|bDPVRtCNaa	It's not usually recommended that you use fish to cycle an aquarium these days. It stresses the fish, and it is not necessary.     Adding fish food to the tank during the first week or two will mimic fish waste and work just as well.    Neons are especially sensitive to water quality so I would suggest adding them to your tank last. I have only ever seen glo fish at Petco.|`|BSzEkKhRaa	they have glo fish at walmart so if you want to start wit h them ok but t hey are like 370 so i woulsd try a few zebra danios and then get glo fish from walmart the only place i know to ha ve them (eve ry walmart has t hem)|`|37TowRL7aa	NO FISH!  that makes it all much worse.  just drop some fish food in so bacteria can grow or use bacteria supplement.  by putting a fish in their u r just wasting money and killing a fish.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Fishless cycling is really the best.  Just add some fish food, or a few pieces of dead fish (from the grocery store) to get the nitrogen cycle started.    Alternatively, you can add ammonia to get the cycle started. Ammonia preparations for this purpose are sold in aquarium shops, or you can use bottled ammonia from the cleaning product aisle at the store. Just be sure to get ammonia that does not have detergent, fragrance, or color added.    With or without fish, you will, of course, need test kits for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate, so you can see where your tank is in the cycle.|`|39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	I would use one or two cocktail shrimp to cycle with.  It sucks waiting to add fish, but then again you don't have to worry about killing any or stressing them out.  Make sure you get a test kit too, API makes a good one.

P8Q39vA4aa	You might want to take that pup to a vet now. I had a pup that aspirated milk into his lungs and it killed him. He got pneumonia from it also. So take the pup to a vet or emergency vet.     NO matter what the breed it that pup still needs to see a vet.    If the pup has aspirated milk there is not much they can do, but the dog still needs to go.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Only a vet can help now.  That's great that they are from champion stock. I bet you have a waiting list a mile long.    How DO you get 4 week old Champions full bred?  Did the mother win best in show while she was prego?|`|gjD8pndjaa	Are you certain its milk and not a disease such as kennel couch, parvo...?|`|50WCN0graa	Your puppy doesn't have milk in his lungs. If he did, he would choke.    He sounds like he may be sick and should see a vet. His stomach sounds like it is "distended." You should really get him help.|`|wuBIF9aPaa	call a vet,   and i am impressed that your 4 week old puppies already earned their championships.  how is that even possible?
kCu6Him8aa	If you have to ask, please don't breed them. Only responsible breeders should breed. It takes a lot of work, especially with toy breeds. Small breeds tend to have birthing problems and deliver breech. They also need c-sections frequently as well. It's unfair to the poor dogs. I suggest getting them fixed.     However, if you are serious about breeding and want to get into it, start going to dog shows... showing your dogs... meeting breeders, etc etc. Get under someone's wing and learn how to do it right. If your chihuahuas are up to standard, start there. However, if this is just a one or two time thing, just refrain. Please. It's not worth it to you or your dogs.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Obviously not - the female should be bigger than the male - not smaller.  Your female would likely need a C-section to deliver puppies, if she made it that far, likely she would have a terrible time carrying large pups.    Why would you endanger the poor thing like that??  Get them both fixed asap.|`|AA10773721	No. It is true that the male should be equal or smaller than the female, however, if there is big in their parents background it could still lead to problems.|`|CZdxMZ9uaa	sure why not?|`|BwdlBDZMaa	No!! the male should be equal to her size or smaller.|`|AslKMqr3aa	IF....you guys are whineing about dogs haveing pups then you shouldn't say this if you have kids Gee wiz think of all those kids in the adoption homes and orphanages hmm... you guys are so mean to all those poor kids in the world....Haveing kids.... if you adopted and had a real child your just filling up spaces in the orphanage.... geez stupid people not ripping of their testicles and such...|`|M5SKaf5haa	Nope, I wouldn't consider it "safe". You are putting the female at risk for dystocia (difficult birthing) which can lead to emergency surgery or even death. How old are your dogs?     Please read:   http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content...|`|b9FfTATSaa	no . you have no reason to breed there are so many dogs iin shelters and if you breed you are helping to the pet overpopultaion.|`|iqLV0SPdaa	no dont breed them|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	It sounds like more of a science experiment than a process that will bring new lives into the world - are you planning on being responsible for these new lives?     Just please get them spayed and neutered.|`|F3KVSZiEaa	NO, IT IS NOT SAFE.THE MALE SHOULD ALWAYS BE SMALLER THAN THE FEMALE.THE PUPPIES COULD BE TOO BIG FOR HER TO DELIVER.THEN SHE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A C-SECTION WHICH WOULD BE VERY RISKY FOR HER AND THE PUPPIES.GOOD LUCK!!|`|rPgQ5xqCaa	for one you shouldn't be breeding dogs when there are so many that are homeless. You don't know how important it is to get you cats and dogs fixed.
oIwoWbFdaa	Honestly, I think puppies as presents is always a terrible idea. Have you done research on these dogs before you decided " I would like one that would stay small.". Some little dogs can be the biggest handfulls. Once you decide, after some looking into certain breeds, and you feel like you can't wait for a good breeder to have a litter, look at a shelter near you.|`|AA10072754	why don't you adopt one?  Lots of private centers (not County, City, or SPCA) will adopt on site.  Check out petfinder.com.....there are ALWAYS healthy dogs up for adoption.  Plus when you adopt, the animal has been vaccinated, examined, and already altered, and sometimes even house broken and gone through basic training.  And yes shelters have puppies.....often times huge litters.|`|SzGyWKsPaa	Puppies make HORRIBLE gifts. It doesn't sound like you've done ANY research whatsoever on what breed you want. What if a Yorkshire Terrier doesn't fit into your lifestyle and family? What if small breeds aren't the ones for you? You must choose a breed based on your lifestyle and the care you can provide, not just what you think you want.    Yes, your daughter may want a puppy, but do YOU want one? What happens if she loses interest in the puppy? Are you still going to care for it? Puppies are a LOT of work. They need tons of care, attention, and training. Can you provide that?    Please remember that if your daughter loses interest in the puppy, it's your responsibility to care for it. Once your daughter goes to college, you'll be caring for it.    I suggest you check out http://www.petfinder.com for puppies in your area in need of a good home. There are tons listed on there, and you may just find the perfect addition to your family.|`|Hdp22D2saa	You can get dogs of many breeds from your local shelter. You just type in what you are looking for and your location.|`|2kI0lUxXaa	http://www.petfinder.com|`|kC8JHWVQaa	go TO YOUR LOCAL SPCA OR SHELTER OR POUND THEY HAVE PUPPIES THERE AND ALL NEED LOVING HOMES, THEN IF CANT FIND WHAT UR LOOKING FOR (BUT I BET YOU DO) U CAN LOOK IN NEWS PAPER  ALOT OF PETS ARE IN THERE.  ALSO GET ON NETS THEY HAVE ALOT BUT WILL HAVE TO BE IN YOUR STATE OR TOWN OR CLOSE BY.  DO YOU HAVE A FL YER THAT HAS ADS IN IT ONLY IF SO CK THAT OUT   A SWAP SHOP? WHERE PEOPLE CALL IN ITEMS THEY HAVE FOR SALE CK THIS ALSO.  good luck and happy B/D TO YOUR LIL GIRL.|`|dOEyW1ycaa	Yess it is avialable on ebay|`|YFAt8InNaa	Of course.  I have one that is completely free, guaranteed healthy, trains itself, will do your daughter's homework for you, and is also a Cockadoodleschnor. How good is that?    *shakes head in wonderment*  Okay, here's a wake up call for you.  Anybody who sells you a puppy at this short notice is a backyard breeder.  Anybody who sells you a puppy because your daughter wants a puppy for her birthday is a backyard breeder.  Anybody who sells you a puppy, knowing full-well that you haven't done any research, is a backyard breeder.    I've got news for you.  How old is your daughter? Old enough to take care of the dog herself? If not, you're buying yourself a dog. Wait until your daughter is old enough to care for the dog herself.  Your only requirement is that the puppy stays small? That must mean that you will buy the first backyard bred pup you set your eyes on, without taking where the dog came from, why it was bred, how healthy it is, and what breed it is, into consideration.    Do everyone a favour and get your daughter something else for her birthday.
Cfk1kr8Daa	Funny you should pick a Frenchie - but it's not clear to me by your question as to whether you're talking about breeding them, or raising A puppy of your own...     French Bulldogs are one of the breeds that specifically do NOT home birth, because their heads are too big - they are delivered by C-section by an expensive vet for over a thousand dollars.      If you want to take care of a puppy, why not volunteer at the local shelter, and they will show you just how much work a puppy can be.|`|MuD5oXQQaa	VERRRRY hard if you are doing it right.  Not something to be done unless you are very committed to a solid year (at least) of training, socialization, and establishing boundaries.|`|AA10072754	not so much hard....but expensive.  And bulldogs are prone to needing C-sections...    so C-section...lets go cheap and say $500    -and you also need puppy food....lets go cheap and say....$30  -some enzyme cleaning stuff will help for when they poo everywhere when they get older.....$15  -bed to whelp in....$15 (or tons of towels)     see its cheap!  now the fun part    -cost of owning all adults cause nobody wants a BYB dog....lets go cheap and say $50 a month on food alone    -Cost of surrendering cause nobody wants a BYB dog $45 each    -cost of seeing the mother die during home birth because you know nothing about breeding and did it cause babies are cute.........priceless|`|9fdb1aec1eec12317a40aebc48023ffbaa	It is not very hard if you love animals. It does however require alot of time and patience as well as money for proper vet care and a quality food. Not to mention obedience training. It is a wonderful experience if you love animals but if you just want one because they are soooooocute then I wouldn't recommend you get one just yet. They don't remain sooooooocute for long. They like everything else grow up and still require a lot of your time walking and playing. Try volunteering for an animal shelter or the humane society for awhile and see if you would like to take this long term relationship with a dog to the next level. Dogs can live anywhere from 7-20 years, are you ready for that long of a commitment when their not soooo cute?|`|SzGyWKsPaa	Extremely hard. It's just like having a newborn baby.    French Bulldogs are among the hardest dogs to breed. They most often need c-sections. It doesn't sound like you understand just what breeding and raising a puppy from birth takes, so please don't.|`|4U2eb9AMaa	raising puppies is like raising a child and they're not so cute when they're crapping all over the house because you don't feel like taking them out or they eat your brand new sneakers because you don't clean your room. loads of hard work loads of commitment and loads of time and money i'd say volunteer at a shelter first|`|sME5selUaa	VERY!!!! hard|`|IZGJOsuQaa	ive never actually raised a puppy. but from what i hear is that it is pretty hard. they need attention and love. make sure u prepare before u bring it home. make sure u have enough time (in between jobs, recreational events, etc) it is probably hard but im sure u can do it. good luck.|`|UTMAqsJUaa	here is the thing. dont!!|`|4f7932664a73acbe236f3015ab8daad9aa	Well, its quite hard... but you will get used to it after a few days (or weeks). When you get a puppy, you have to prepare a lot of things, like a bed, place where he/she can poop or wee, where he/she can play,etc. If you want a puppy or any other pet, you can't be scared to pick up it's poop up and throw it down the trash can. Have fun with your new puppy (thats coming, I think)!    P.S. Be patient with the pup|`|EnXxuWuraa	Well, we got a two month old puppy and it has been like having a baby. Up every two hours to go potty outside, constant cleaning up inside potty accidents, playing with him, walking him, training him over and over and over and over, can't leave him alone, have to watch him 24/7, let me just say, it was easier having a baby because at least then you could find people to babysit :-) Our little guy is five months now and he is still a ton of work! Just when we think it is getting easier, he comes up with something new to challenge us with!|`|b4UugR50aa	Lots of people say its so hard but it really isnt if you love them! i just got a puppy about a year ago and i loved raising her. you just have to make sure u take them out side a lot so they know where that bathroom is, and get all of their shots. The only thing is they cry at night, for the first like 1 to 2 weeks. you just have to have time! I hope you get one!!|`|eRndjnLHaa	Yes puppies are cute. But they are a lot of work. Be prepared for the dog to cry at night, pee and poop on the carpet, and to chew. But, once you get past the hard part, dogs are very loving and loyal. So.. is the hard work worth the reward in the end? It was for me.|`|Nb4QK8Foaa	About as hard as it is to raise a 2 year old, with chompers.
t9Fxx75uaa	She is in heat...get her spayed!!!!!  WATCH her like a hawk until u do get her spayed because you can't get child support from a male dog.|`|MuD5oXQQaa	A heat cycle is not a disease, therefore there are not symptoms|`|AA10072754	No she didn't...    how do I know?  Dogs don't have periods.    get her spayed.....this will save you a lot of trouble and hateful answers on here|`|AA11107306	It can last anywhere from a week to 4 weeks. And the bleeding isn't really a period, like we humans have it. It's just a symptom of your dog being in heat, which means she is ready to mate. This usually occurs twice a year. Other symptoms include whining a lot more and increase in urination. If you don't plan on breeding your maltese, I recommend getting her spayed. The sooner you spay her, the less likely she will develope cysts or ovarian cancer. I had my 6 year Springer Spaniel spayed (she was a retired show dog given to my by her owner) and the vet found 4 cysts on her ovaries.|`|AJ59Fqxtaa	Heat lasts 18-21 days on average. Her vulva will start to swell, get pretty big, she will have a bloody discharge that starts around 10 days into he cycle and lasts about a week, then the swelling starts o go down and the discharge gradually stops. She may act funny, like backing up to you or other pets, she may whimper a bit, like she wants to go outside a lot, she may pee more often and lose a bit of her house training.....or not.    It is important that you keep her away from male dogs and ALWAYS be with her when she's outside. A male dog can smell her heat scent for miles and they will jump her at a moment's notice. If you don't plan to breed her, please get her spayed, It's better for her health and will save you headaches twice a year when she goes into heat.    Hope this helps.|`|Nb4QK8Foaa	Symptoms include red spots on the carpet and furniture, and boy dogs coming around from far and wide from the invisible smell.  The female dog will pose so a male dog can mate with her.  Dogs have been known to mate through fences even, so keep her indoors away from male dogs.  There are doggy diapers you can have your dog wear to stop the minor mess, and bathe the dog after it ends if you want to be super clean.  It lasts about 10 days.|`|b06823c815989537982afce189dfd447aa	She is in heat.  The whole cycle lasts almost three weeks.  keep her away from male dogs and don't leave her outside alone.

My pup got it at around 10-11 months|`|U0Tjzi1maa	they bleed a bit for 7-10 days then are in heat for 7-10days then another 7-10days they still smell like it but aren't in heat... make sure to keep a close eye on her and away from male dogs.    other symptoms can include being more cranky/bitchy, wanting everything to mount her (she'll move her tail to the side if you walk up behind her) and even humping.|`|mLLAimT6aa	please get her fixed when she is out of heat...
RYRJUhYTaa	Being that your parents would be responsible for the financial aspect of raising a dog, they win!    Just hold on until you move out on your own!  I know it's no fun - but I had to do it, so it can be done!|`|um5CVvTfaa	Sorry, I have to side with the padre.  A dog is a big responsibility and if the head of the household doesn't like them, no one will be happy.|`|bZhIEy1Waa	You can't TELL your dad anything - he's your father, the adult and believe it or not, he knows best on this one! You want a pet because your friends have one but say if he DID get you a puppy. That'd be great eh? For a few months yes, then you'll get fed up of walking it, feeding it, cleaning up after it. Who's going to pay for all its injections? Who's going to pay for its food? Who's going to pay for it to be boarded out when you go on holiday? Who's going to pay for it to be micro-chipped and groomed every four months? Its not going to be you is it? Course it isn't because you're obviously too young to work and if you did work, who'd look after the pup when no-ones at home during the day? I know you don't like the answers you're getting because you'd idealy like us to agree with you but i'm afraid most of us are on dad's side! He's right i'm afraid - its an expensive business being a pet owner but in saying that love, i believe all kids should have a pet of some sort but i'm not your dad! I know its not mega exciting but would he allow you to have a hamster or a guinea pig? Goldfish or tropical tank? A lot of dads would go for a tropical tank - its a brilliant hobby to take up and looks very impressive in the lounge! Trust me, you'll be glad you didn't push for a puppy when the weathers real cold and wet and you don't want to go out! You've got to grow yet and when you're that bit older you're going to want to be out with your friends - not walking an old dog round the block four to five times a day! Pick an in-door pet such as the ones i suggested or a rabbit - easier to look after and just as affectionate. Good luck.|`|t9Fxx75uaa	Sorry kid but you sound kinda spoiled and bratty on here and if I were your dad I'd say no too.  You seem like the type that says they will take care of it but then lose interest after a few weeks.  If Dad says no then it's no.  There's enough going on in the world right now with high gas and food prices, the mortgage crisis, inflation and devaluation of the dollar so lay off your parents with this.  I'm sure they're just trying to feed the mouths that they have now and not add any more to the household.  Until u are 18, it will be legally THEIR dog and THEY are responsible for it so if you want a dog, volunteer at a local shelter and do for others and don't be so self centered.  You have NO idea what it takes to raise dog for 15 years....lots of money vet bills, food, vaccinations, what happens when it gets sick.  Cleaing up poop EVERYDAY for 15 years.  What about vacations?  What happens when u want to go out with your friends?  You gonna go to college...what happens to the dog then???  I am not even started with all it takes.|`|AA10072754	Dogs are a huge responsibility.  Our dog managed to sneak out of the house during a storm and it cost us only $400 to get him out (thats a discount)    Plus vet bills, food, and other things get expensive.  I got a job and pay for everything myself|`|SzGyWKsPaa	I agree. Puppies are a TON of work, and it doesn't sound like you quite understand the commitment of a puppy. That puppy will live 10+ years, and by the sounds of your whining, it seems you just want a puppy because your friends all have pets. So what? Almost all my friends have a dog or cat, and I don't. I don't whine about it, and I accept the fact that my mom doesn't want a dog or cat.    Puppies take up a lot of time. They require patience, tons of attention, and training. It's VERY expensive owning a dog. You have the cost of supplies, vet bills, food, etc. Please realize that your dad has a good reason for saying no, and you need to accept it. Once you're out on your own, have the time, and have the money to care for a dog, get one of your own. Until then, understand that life isn't fair and you don't always get what you want.|`|xpjfjsBgaa	maybe you should start with a smaller pet like a hamster or a ferrett or a guinea pig. dogs are a big responsibility to have, and i dont think getting a dog because your friends have one is a good reason for getting a dog. it sounds like you are not ready for one.  also, do you know how expensive a dog can be? just a bag of food is 20 dollars. you have to pay for its vet care, which can easily exceed $100.  you have to invest a lot of time into the puppy. when its raining, you have to take them out. some dogs require big walks everyday for exercise.|`|EnXxuWuraa	Get a webkinz or virtual pet...parents rule the world until you are an adult...|`|LafPBmQnaa	Hi,    I answered a question like this before, knowing they probably wouldn't like it very much - but they actually picked my answer as the best - big surprise to me!    What I said was that I, too was absolutely drooling over a puppy - I wanted one so bad and was heartbroken that the apartment my hubby and I lived in wouldn't allow any pets besides rodents or birds. Sigh! Then, we finally moved into a small house and the FIRST thing we did was get a puppy - yeah!     Though we love and adore him, I have been shocked at how much work it is - and how expensive they are. We spend about $75 a month in food, toys, flea shots and vaccinations on average (not to mention neutring and any healthy issues). The other thing that was a big surprise was how much work - wow! They are like three year olds with teeth that never grow up - they chew and destroy everything (lipstick, lotion, flowers,   you name it) Yes, you can train them, but that can be expensive and takes a lot of work, too.    If you are young and are soon going to be heading to college, or like to leave the house alot to hang out with friends or your boyfriend, it will be really hard to have a dog as you can't leave them along for very long - and if you take him with you, I have been sad at how many people don't want your pet in their house. (Also, they have to go potty often - starting at 6 in the morning - every morning! Ack!)    So - they are wonderful, dear little friends, but I just wanted you to know some of the reasons why your dad may be saying 'NO' without explaining. And if he does change his mind, happy doggie times!|`|RVn6ba30aa	Well, when I wanted a dog I had already owned a cat and two birds. My dad isn't the biggest animal person. So, this is what I did. I called my dad at work while he was in a meeting and started crying on the phone. My father is a real estate broker and he was making a deal. While I was on the phone and crying I asked him for a dog and of course not paying much attention to what I was saying he said "of course dear, you can have whatever you want". So I said thanks and hung the phone up. I ran downstairs and told my mom, we were so happy. When my dad came home from dinner he said to my mom " NO,NO I told Angie that she could get a dog but I didn't mean it I was in the middle of a meeting. My mom told him that he cant say something different now and change his mind. So that's how I got my West Highland Terrier, and her name is Lola.|`|8ZqGHLLOaa	I feel your disappointment and frustration.  Sometimes, parents like to see long term interest before investing $$$, time and energy into a family pet.  Would you be able to volunteer at your local pet shop or animal shelter?  This would not only be a start to showing your dad that you are serious and committed to puppy parenthood, but it would also give you some insight into what pups require on a daily basis.  Sometimes, we have to put in a couple of hard yards to earn what we want.  Good luck!|`|b4UugR50aa	Try to get a job to show your dad you are responsible, and come up with the money to but a puppy and to take care of its food and health care, and maybe his answer will change!!|`|FHFKJB9gaa	Hows it feel to want? Youre a kid, until youre an adult you have no say.    I would say no too... youre not gona pay for the dog, the vet bills, the food, the toys... And youre not gona be able to walk the dog when youre at school.    Ultimately itll be your dads dog and he doesnt want one.|`|Nb4QK8Foaa	When you grow up and can pay for your own place to live, then you can have all the dogs you can handle.  If you really want some experience with animals, see if you can dog-sit someone else's dog, and then save up the money for your own dog one day - or something that is not a dog that you can show off to your friends.|`|v7CjvhBeaa	Puppies are very hard to take care of. They require socialisation and proper training (house training, manners, what not to do, etc.). You need to be able to prove that you can care for the dog. You need to have the money to take care of it. You dont get a dog just because all your other friends have one, the dog is going to be around for a long time, the decision is up to your parents.
DWaglHczaa	I have had cats with rats together!  Depends one the cats ?  House cats are not normally a problem with other animals.

I have a pet rat and my cat loves the rat.  she sleeps next to the cage, will not attack him if we are playing with the rat.    my bf has a cat that would kill the rat in a heartbeat if he could get his claws on it.    i would not even consider putting the rat in the same household as his cat, but my cat i have no problem.|`|qL9gJxi8aa	I have 8 cats and I am a breeder of Lionheads and Holland Lops. My cats will try to hurt the baby bunnies, but once they reach a certain size, my cats will play with them. The rabbits actually chase the cats! I also introduce my cats to the bunnies starting when the bunnies are very young (under my supervision) . The cats are curious, but they have been around them for so long that they loose interest quickly.   I would say YES it is safe as long as you supervise your kitties and allow them to get use to your bunny. Make sure they know that bunny is NOT their prey, but a member of the family.

You would most likely have to have your cat microchipped, and complete a course of vaccination. Then get your cat a pet passport. Probably, you have to buy a special cage from your air line, and the cat has to weight within 7kg including the cage, or you will have to pay extra. That's what my friends had to do, when they took their cats to Spain from UK.|`|ISjFdI1taa	Try this link to the defra website - it explains what you have to do to get a pet passport.

Rw7gi86Naa	Young kittens between the ages of 3 weeks old and 8 months old will be teething off and on, and will have very strong needs to bite.  Just like baby children, kittens are born without teeth, start getting their first baby teeth at about 3-4 weeks old, then they will lose their baby teeth and have their adult teeth come in up until the age of about 8 months old.  So the trick here is not to keep them from biting; but rather, to provide them appropriate items to bite.  We use heavy-duty plastic drinking straws with our kittens, (being careful to cut off any bitten ends and discard the entire straw before it becomes dangerous, as with any toy), and train them from the start that toys and straws are purr-rectly fine to bite, but human body parts are off-limits!  If a kitten learns this from the start, there is hardly ever an inappropriate biting behavior as an adult.  Some cats start biting out of frustration after they have been de-clawed.  Some cats start biting out of misplaced aggression, which usually can be countered by providing the cat a feline playmate, and/or providing them more cat toys, cat furniture, and making their environment more stimulating for them.  For a cat with a serious biting problem, often the quickest way to teach them not to bite you is to immediately blow on his face, as soon as you realize he is biting or is about to bite you.  Saying "NO!" firmly at the same time reinforces this training.  At all times, it is critical that you be thinking and acting on the firm belief that "toys and straws are for biting; human hands are for giving and receiving love.       Don't assume automatically that cats that bite are vicious creatures.  You must distinct between play-biting and real aggressive biting.  Kittens for example like to play, and sometimes pretty rough.  They use their claws and teeth to wrestle with each other.  They prepare for catching prey and thats normal.  They usually go unharmed because their fur protects them from serious wounds.  However, human skin is a different story, but kittens don't know that.    When you stroke your kitten it can take it as an invitation to play and clasps your hand and bites.  That might hurt a little but is generally nothing to worry about.  Some cats make a sport out of leg biting.  They jump up on you and dig in.  Research has show that its a sort of unsatisfied hunting and prey instinct and lack of activity.      ? Teach your kitten from an early age that hands are for feeding and stroking and NOT a toy!    ? Avoid playing with your bare hands   ? Use a fluffy toy or a feather on a string instead   ? In case it grabs your hand, draw it away slowly and do NOT punish your cat, it will understand it as an attack and make matters worse   ? However if you cat did scratch or hurt you in any way, make a yowling sound and show that you have been hurt, your cat will understand   ? If your cat is a "leg biter" try to spend more time playing with it and redirect its attack to a toy.  Leave toys lying around so that he can also amuse itself, particular when you keep your cat indoors|`|AA11012938	At this moment in time he's still very impressionable, telling him off now will prevent him from doing so in the future.    It is best for you to show him as much love as possible, and also almost "bully" him round to what you want him to do. IE no biting or scratching ...  just give him a tap and say firmly NO!! In the meantime you must make him let you touch him, his legs, his paws etc so if he ever has problems in future, he'll be a lot more easier to deal with beucase he'll let you touch him.    If you let him get away with this behaviour, not only will it carry on, he'll also be that way for the rest of his life, which can makes things difficult etc if he every needs veterinary treatment.    In the meantime get some toys and a scatching post, he's obviously very energetic and not getting it out of his system enough, you need to make sure he's getting the day to day enrichment and entertainment he needs.|`|jLtxktFgaa	Thats how kittens play.

Hope I helped!    :)    x|`|dLHquAsqaa	-buy a spray botte. you can get them from any hardware shop. fill with water and keep in an easily accessable place. every time he jumps on the table, spray one pump with the bottle and say a firm 'NO'. (not yelling)  -cats like to trip people up, mine hid under my bed and pawed my ankles as i walked past when he was a kitty but what you can do is get a toy that she likes (preferably with catnip in) and every time he goes to trip you up, throw the toy to another part of the room and he shoud just run off to chase and play with the toy. i found this distraction method very good.  -this methos only really works at the kitten stage when they are still learning. every time he attacks you gently pick him up, tap him on the nose, say a firm 'no' and put him in another room. continue doing this and he should get the message. a cats nose is a sensitive area and tapping it is not to induce harm at all. it is mearly to let the cat know the feeling and relate this feeling with something bad (ie the 'no').  -it is natural for you kitty to want to play and often they get over exited and scratch and bite a bit or thump your hand. this is normal and please dont punish kitty for doing this. if he only attacks you when you prod him with your feet or tickle his tummy, dont do these things.  good luck!  x|`|Qlw2lLAWaa	Your kitten is learnin to be BIG CAT... it's perfectly annoying normal behaviour from your kitten!|`|Rsyq77yJaa	Yes, you could; but that would be like taking playtime away from him, he is only a baby so  should be able to play, that is just how kittens have fun. He will grow out of this usual habit soon. Good luck!

YIvIVvWFaa	I can't help you with the money end of it, but if you visit the breeder before making up your mind--which you should do if at all possible--you won't have to worry about fake ads.     When you visit the breeder with the idea of picking out a puppy, notice whether or not the mother and pups are kept in the house or off in some other building and in a cage. If there are lots of dogs there with their puppies, it could be a puppy mill and not a good place to buy from. Also notice if everything is clean; it should be clean and not smell bad.    Ask to see the mother. Notice her temperament. If she is very nervous, and especially if she snaps at you, her puppies may have bad temperament problems later. Some breeders are just after the money or just want a dog that can win at a show, so they inbreed too much or mate good-looking dogs that have such bad personalities that they never should be allowed to have puppies.    Now look at the puppies. It is good to pick a friendly one who comes over to you and who seems alert and playful. Check to see if it has runny eyes, a runny nose, and/or a dirty bottom as if it has been doing diarrhea. An otherwise skinny puppy with a huge pot belly can mean it has worms. If any of the pups has these problems, don't buy from that breeder. Also, does the puppy have clean fur with no bare spots? A bare spot could be all right if it came from some accident or action of the puppy itself, like rubbing against the bars of a cage, but be careful because it could also mean allergies or a skin problem, especially if the bare skin looks dirty or crusty or red.    If you want a female, I think you may be considering breeding from her.  This has something to do with the price, too, females being more expensive, but you should also be aware that there are two grades of dog, so to speak: pet quality and show quality. You should pay a lot less for pet quality. You could get a perfectly wonderful dog that is classed as pet quality simply because in one way or another, it does not conform closely to the standards set up by a kennel association, like the AKC, for instance, and therefore will not be able to win at shows.    In any event, you would be smart to check out the show standards, because then no one can try to make you pay too much for a non-show standard puppy, and you will know what you are looking for.   The standard will say things like what the shape of the dog's head should be, and the color of the fur, length of tail, and so on.    If you are buying a pedigreed puppy, also be sure what kennel club it is registered with and make sure you do get those papers.       You could check prices by phoning breeders who have ads in various dog magazines.|`|JGq9rKBOaa	http://www.ytca.org/breeder1.html|`|AA10072754	Most reputable breeders I have talked to (about any breed) have suggested going to your local shelter first and then coming to talk to them.  So check with your local shelter.  www.petfinder.com will give you all in your area.    You can tell when a breeder is a BYB or Mill when  1) They place their AKC puppies for sale in the newspaper or penny saver  2) They place their AKC puppies for sale in the pet shop  3) They say thoroughbred instead of purebred (Thoroughbred is a breed of horse)    Also most reputable breeders won't have the stud around (or if they stud with females then the father usually won't be with a dog they own).  Yes they pay to have the best possible stud and have their dog shipped (or have semen shipped).    They also will allow you to meet the mother.      They should have show results (no show no go)  as well as test results for various yorkie diseases (good test  = best)    Ask how often they breed their females.  They should be bred no more than three times in their life (and if they are even bred that much then they should have tons of titles) and have at least a year's rest before breeding again.    Check what the stock is eating as food.  If it isn't a high brand of dog food (Eukanuba, Purina ONE are acceptable) then this breeder isn't looking to spend money on the dogs.    Also they will sell to you on contract.  Because most breeders support shelters they will NOT allow you to purchase a dog for breeding and you must have the dog neutered/spayed.    thats just some things.  NEVER be too careful or picky    EDIT:  Clubs have referrals.  This club is the club of america (parent club of AKC) and to be in this club you must show.  http://www.ytca.org/|`|MZlBRJQTaa	I don't "look" for a dog. I "look" for a GOOD breeder.

U0Tjzi1maa	if you are going to have your dog pull weights you MUST buy a proper weight pulling harness!! also never ever leave your dog unattended when it's pulling weights. keep the sessions very short if you are making him pull heavy things. if it's something light the sessions can be longer, but remember to be near him the entire time. remember safety first!  you could also look into spring poles. they are basically rope swings that dogs bite onto and pull like tug-o-war. pitbulls love them, not sure if your breed would be into it... but it really buffs up their chest and neck. again, never leave your dog unattended with one of these, and make sure you start with the rope very low to the ground.. once your dog is good at it and actually enjoys it, you can raise the rope up so he dangles with just his toe tips touching the ground.|`|i33WOzi4aa	http://www.viovet.co.uk/product_info.php...

My Pitt chews on coconuts to clean her teeth and buff her jaw out.  Just make him pull heavy stuff and carry heavy stuff, but pace it, dont overwork your dog out.  And feed a little bit more.......    P.S. and yes you do need to use the proper harness, but that's just common sense.  The spring pole described down there is a good things to use, FOR PITTS.  pulling weights is a very simple workout for your dog, of course monitor it, as far as the chain, it works there shoulders back and neck out really well.  It gives the big posture look.  I would recommend using Iams or Euakanuba for the diet, and by feeding it more, you are producing more fat cells, but when worked out, turns to muscle...|`|Qi1oOYNZaa	there are no supplements like for humans - just plain exercise/walking running will do.|`|Su3tTCtuaa	You should love your dog either way.

That will "buff" up your dog as well as creating a relationship with your dog.
HXJAD2nLaa	It means that your pet has been fixed. The term is commonly used in shelters and rescues.

I have never seen anyone try to say they are "pure breed"  obviously they are mixed hence the mixed name. Who does it hurt to have a cute name? Just causes a bunch of rucus on y!answers.

an1b4pXxaa	I have a rescue standardbred from the trots, you will probably find one of those to rescue more easily than a thoroughbred although if your daughter is serious about riding you will find that often people are prejudiced against them., and you might be advised to get a "proper horse". Lol|`|AA11012938	I used to ride an ex racehorse called Rosetta, thoroughbred and very stong willed. (17.2 and i was 15 at the time!!) She had a weakness in her leg which stopped her proffessional career.    The person who commented before me is right. They have literally no "normal" riding skills and it's all about being raced. You need a lot of time and patience to kill that habit out of them. Tons of schooling. and your daughter will have to be very physically fit. My rosie was difficult to control and even 2 years later she still kept bad habits.     Rosie was a lovely horse once we managed to cure her vices ( she was treated as a money maker.. not as a pet and becuase of it she was ill tempered to say the least!) Race horses pick up bad habits for sure from biting, craning the neck against you and many other things. But her stables had done that to her.    You might also find he/she doesn't like being stabled with other horses!    Make sure you're careful when you go to see these horses!!|`|2FKs7TEHaa	go to a local RSPCA or other animal rescue centre and enquire, or just google it! there are usually loads for sale. it probably will be easier considering you have a pony. ex racehorses are lovely to ride normally, often they can just never find a home so they're sent off there, so the likelyhood is that they will be ok to ride.|`|1bRRODd2aa	I take it that your daughter is an experienced, competent rider. If she is, then a Thoroughbred as a breed, shouldn't pose too many problems.  Your only problem in adopting an ex-racehorse is that they will have had absolutely zero training for normal riding, and will have to be schooled and taught from scratch.  There's nothing to say that an ex-racehorse will not eventually make a very good riding horse, with potentially limitless ability, but a LOT of hard work needs to be put into the training before that potential can be realized.|`|bXcmhRUOaa	There are many organizations that rehome ex race horses.  Most need retraining, but many are sound and ready for a new career.    http://www.canterusa.org/    http://horseadoption.com/    http://www.rerun.org/|`|0rRkRAnJaa	Please God no, don't "rescue" an off-the-track TB. It sounds like a lovely idea I know but they are a world apart from a headstrong cob and require extensive rehabilitation from experts in that field. Unless you have a trainer experienced with OTTBs and you are prepared to put in a lot of time and money with them then you shouldn't get one.   Leave it to the professionals, buy your daughter another horse that is suitable for her. You can still get a horse that needs bringing on without it being an ex racer.
0tCYtnPUaa	I have the SAME problem.  I have 3 bulldogs and they act like I am killing them when I try to trim their nails.  i found a great tool at Petco.  It's called Richard's Organics Pet Calm.  It comes in a blue glass bottle.  it has natural ingredients like valerian and chamomile that help my dogs relax (like a little valium!) and then I can clip them.  It has been an absolute lifesaver for me.  It's about $8 for the bottle and it should last at least 6 months.  good luck!   I really enjoyed the comparison to WWF, very accurate! :)|`|cc4d599aa91088b8c88ae90414266222aa	just take him to the vet and let them do it|`|Og7dGesIaa	Challenge him to a death match.

Groomers and Vets can do it for you, after all, they are to professionals.  The same thing was happening to me with me dog, he just wouldnt let us clip his nails, so we found a local groomer and took him down there, and every 3wks his nails come back perfect.|`|P7f346v8aa	Patience.      Some dogs will not tolerate traditional nail trimmers, however they may instead learn to accept a nail grinder (Dremel).  Both take time to encourage acceptance.  "Acceptance" is much more important in the beginning than "winning" and getting the nail short enough in one sitting.    Even the tiniest amount removed without fight is to be celebrated and move on to the next nail/foot.  Reward heavily.  Keep yourself calm.  If you're wired up and tense.....the dog will be convinced this is a bad deal going down.    With not as much nail being trimmed per session, you'll get to practice more often and acceptance will come sooner rather than later.    I have a 130 pound dog who has nail issues much akin to WWF or WWII.  When he puts up a fuss, someone's getting hurt!  |`|QkStMAPpaa	you may want to consider changing the way you ask the question. it sounds a littl emean|`|OGVhwFa2aa	tequila|`|3436lJanaa	Lol.

They can still breath through it and all or either try a muzzle. If he just moves to much you can give him a benidrill.|`|RsnYmGAsaa	Maybe it's painful for him whenever you handle his nails since they're so long.  An experienced vet should do the job instead.  Also, you should not be using a cutting tool to do it. Who knows if you'd be cutting the quick.  Walk him more often and his nails will naturally wear down from the ground rubbing.  Take him to the vet.|`|OkZND4Bpaa	Ask Chris Benoit. |`|AA10084188	You may try to ask your vet if you can give him some mild tranqilizer like acepromazine. I had a couple of dogs in my past that would just freak out whenever there were fireworks outside.

The full dose would make them not care or sleep for a couple hours.|`|eWZMBKPqaa	  Your dogs nails might have been cut to the quick before. If that is the case, building trust with him/her could be pretty tough. At least as far as nail trimming goes.

LPEO6AsCaa	IMO if the breeding pair have any thyroid problems in their lines they should not have been bred in the first place.  That is what good and responsible breeders test for in the first place.      No I'm not surprised at all.  Not only are these breeders (loosely called) breeding untested dogs but probably dogs with bad temperaments in the first place.  Mix that with a genetic predisposition for thyroid problems and you have a dog who can turn on it's owner.    These designer mixes are not what they have been built up to be at all.  People should be aware of all  the medical problems within each breed and then decide if the risk is really worth it.|`|66c4680772e4326cd1f9687e39ff7f56aa	I always wondered whether the mean streak comes from the Labra or the Doodle. Guess we may never really be too sure. |`|doBrNG47aa	I haven't heard word of this one yet...    Though certain breeds can be predisposed to hypothyroidism, it *is* a manageable disease, and when properly medicated, symptoms should diminish, usually to the point of elimination.    I'd say if the cause is hypothyroidism, and the dog is properly diagnosed & treated, there shouldn't be a problem.|`|RzNdGmI9aa	I'm not a fan of this new "designer dog" trend.

They are all super sweet and super soft.|`|iXijnCxOaa	I'm not shocked.    Most designer dog breeders are using low quality dogs who have not been tested for any of the normal screening tests responsible breeders use-- which include a thyroid screening.    Badly bred dogs with poor temperaments and medical issues being bred to other badly bred dogs = problems.    I've made more than a bit of income off of training owners of "doodle" dogs how to train their hyperkinetic, bounce of the walls dogs.|`|4K7g6Op1aa	No,that's not the reason.

Is it wrong of me to want to point the finger and say "THIS is what you doodles get for owning this moronic mutt!"-?    I was unaware that poodles had a chance of hyperthyroidism, but none the less its a blessing. Maybe the mix itself will strongly lose its popularity and we can see an increase of pure bred dogs with predictable temperaments and health conditions rather than any muttley farm on the corner. |`|yUP05L2Iaa	ANY dog can be vicious if u are a responsible person and train it then it wont happen |`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Not surprising.  Since no good breeder would allow their pups to be used to create mixes, you know that the "breeding stock" for labradoodles is sub-standard.  And then people are surprised when they have health/temperament issues?    Labradoodles (and all other "designer breeds") should be banned!|`|AA10072754	That can happen in any breed.  Also some mental problems in some breeds can naturally, without the fault of the owner, cause them to turn and make them dangerous.  These issues are due to poor breeding and, as much as I hate to stick up for the breed, all animals may have this problem, not just this breed. |`|Bw18seFqaa	somehow it doesnt surprise me...    people who breed these dogs are just breeding for profit..  they use poorly bred and untested breeding stock to begin with..  so its hard to say what kind of mixed up genetics the offspring have!    As much as these "hybrid" people want to say that purebreds are inbred..  Im sure many of these designer mixes that are F2 and F3 generations have been inbred themselves.

AA10072754	many say the border collie but it really depends.  People bred dogs to do specific jobs.  A husky may not listen but it was bred to stay warm and pull carts, not so much listen to every command.  A lab was bred to listen, not think 100% on its own.  Hounds were bred for either chasing or smelling, not what their owner says.

No one has ever ever ever proven that they're the smartest, they say they have the highest WORKING intelligence, meaning trainability.    A trainable dog does whatever you want him to do, when you want him to do it, they're like slaves, they don't think for themselves. They just do what they're told, when they're told. Imagine a person that does everything that they are told, when they are told, they wouldn't be considered very intelligent.    Afghan Hounds have been shown to be the lease trainable dog, because they do whatever it wants. It thinks for itself.    What's smarter a dog that does whatever you want, or a dog that does whatever it wants?    That means, in my opinion, that Afghan Hounds are the smartest breed of dog.|`|JFQhrpBOaa	well i'm not sure i think it depends on the owner like you would have to train it you know so like any dog could be the smartest you just have to train it you know what i mean? |`|LjqDcXuhaa	German Shepherd Dogs and their close relatives.  Look at how many are K-9 officers.  That's gotta count in the IQ department.
AA12049777	I have 2 Siberian Huskies. They normally shed quite a bit, and once or twice a year, they shed their coats completely which means, during this time, no matter how much you brush them, it seems like you never get all the fur brushed out - you can make one swipe across their fur with the brush and the brush will be full of dog hair! It's just something you learn to put up with if you have this breed of dog. Also, DO NOT shave your huskey, as someone mentioned previously - this will only make matters worse.  I am gone at work all day, but my wife is home during the day, and keeps the dogs in the house most of the time when it is hot outside. They also have their own plastic "kiddie" pool outside that they like to get in to cool off when it is hot outside, plus various areas of shade they can lay in. If you are going to have huskies, you need to be willing to put up with lots of dog hair, because it will be everywhere. Unfortunately, a lot of people get Siberian Huskies just because they are cute as puppies, and grow into beautiful dogs. However, people need to do research on this breed (as well as any other breed) BEFORE deciding to get this dog - they shed a lot, they can be stubborn, they are known as "escape artists" - if they want to get out of a yard bad enough, they can be very creative in escaping, and can squeeze through the smallest opening, and while in the house, they will follow you (at least my two dogs do) around constantly, wanting to be right in the middle of whatever is going on. A lot of people don't have the patience for this type of behavior, and for this reason, a lot of huskies end up being abused or they end up at rescue sites. Good luck with your huskey.|`|AA10782916	Huskies are native to Siberia, one of the coldest places on the planet.  Their fur has to be thick and warm enough to survive in that climate.  So, unless you live somethere that has snow and ice 3/4 of the year, all that fur is going to be too warm for the climate, and the dog is trying to shed it off to stay cool.    Get an undercoat brush from a pet supply store, and brush the dog every day.  This will help decrease the shedding a bit, although the dog will always shed- you're just going to have to get used to that part.    To help keep the dog cool in the summer, keep him indoors in air conditioning whenever possible.  Fill his water dish with ice water, and keep a close eye on him when he is outside to prevent heat stroke, which can be DEADLY.|`|AA10029366	Siberian Huskies have thick, double coats, designed to protect them in a harsh climate. Unless they live in this harsh climate (does yours?), they shed in huge tufts twice a year (we call it "blowing coat"). Take wabbitqueen's advice -- if you get a brush with long teeth (we call it a "rake") and brush your dog every day, the shedding will go faster. Regular brushes won't do it.    DO NOT SHAVE YOUR DOG. Someone suggested this -- bad idea. Shaving a double coat will only cause it to grow in thicker and softer, destroying the guard hair (think "roof") and leaving only the undercoat (think "insulation"), which will ruin its protective properties. It will never grow normally again. Just make the effort to brush your dog, and you'll get through this.    More info on the breed (which I wish people would read *before* they get a Siberian):  http://www.shca.org/shcahp2b.htm  http://www.shca.org/shcahp2a.htm|`|230de8c8ef5f153f11aae5f1a15af8d6aa	uh....duh...OF COURSE!!!

Since dogs don't sweat they only get cooler by shedding.  Try brushing him every day.|`|4239c23c704ac3eda76f8d7284f5b66aaa	because of the climate they are use to .

He will push it around all day, and chase it, and nip at it.

Im not sure if it is stimulating, but he looks like hes having fun. Also, the sides of his tank are mirrored, so he can see his reflection ( using that mirror contact paper stuff for windows), and he plays all day with the "other fish" ( his reflection). :D He also does a lot of gravel sucking, so he has plenty of pebbles to search.

77e992ad1e1ffa1e96c942a8a6b93a84aa	Les images du dbut sont belles et touchante, la fin est horrible et c'est honteux de voir ?.  Je suis absolument contre la suppression d'une race plus qu'une autre, en plus souvent les gros chiens qu'on dit mchant sont des chiens adorables alors que beaucoup de petits chiens sont agressifs et mordent trs facilement.   L'ducation du maitre prime sur tout le reste, un chien est un animal qui n'a pas raison de vouloir faire du mal, il souhaite trouver "une meute" comme il le ferait dans la nature, y trouver sa place et y rester. Malheureusement normement de gens qui prennent ce genre de chien parcequ'ils sont beaux, n'ont aucune experience en dressage et cel tourne  la catastrophe. Ces chiens finissent par ne pas savoir qui est le maitre et se mette  la place du dominant.   Beaucoup des gens avant de prendre un chien ne s'interessent pas  la psychologie des chiend. Cela on le voit sur beaucoup de chien grand ou petit mais quand un petit chien mord cest gnralement pas trop grave, lorsque c'est un molosse les blessures sont plus grave et l les gens hurlent (logique).  un chien de catgorie 1 ou 2 n'est pas  mettre entre toutes les mains, il devrait y avoir des legislations plus strictes pour suivre le comportement de ses chiens au long de leur vie. Pourquoi pas devoir prsenter son chien tous les ans  des personnes comptentes pour juger de son bon comportement et pouvoir informer les gens s'il y a un problme et les orienter vers des specialistes canins.  Personnellement je ne prendrais pas de chien de ces catgories car meme en jouant un coup de dents sur un enfant peut etre fatal...|`|f1421fd40c2f588c3b45c41778e75b61aa	Je trouve ?a trop bien, ?a me rappel de trs bon souvenir d'enfance pass avec mon gros toutou.

18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	The Pit Bull is showing its face with all that aggression.  Being a cross doesn't take away the the natural instincts of the breed, or the innate aggression.  These dogs are bred to fight and it takes many generations to breed out that character out of them.     When I was learning to train dogs we trained protection dogs that would be placed in a business's fenced lot.  The Pit Bulls we trained could be detoured by another dog and the thief jumped the fence.  This breed is so strong with the fighting (which they were breed for) along with a few others.    It sounds like your dog will end up killing another dog if He got the chance.    My advice is to find a rescue for the breed and see that someone with knowledge about the breed becomes his new owner.   If that is simply out of the question then I very strongly advise that you have your yard so that he cannot escape, get you some "DO NOT ENTER" or warning signs, (DANGER, WATCH DOG")    I have worked this kind of dog and I wouldn't have one.  Not on your life or my life.|`|1296a1f2d7b74eae41c01b1883d0f350aa	yes i have a staffi cross pitbull she is 2 years old and is a Blondie coloure i have a little brother and she is great with him as well as other little kids but has become very aggresive towards other dogs i think its just in there nature.|`|66943b85cf0273c97694043bfb826333aa	yes i used to have one she was brown , white and black she looked like she wore a mask.

OMG why do you bleed every month.Im going to say again what i say to all the people who ask questions they should already know before getting a pet. Owning a pet is a privilege not a rite, not everyone should be able to be parents not every one should be able to have pets. If a girl doesn't know that a cat goes into heat and bleeds every 6 months she has issues. Really I think even guys know this. SAD don't let her out or she will get knocked up and you don't need any more kittens. Get her fixed, so she wont have to go threw the heats.|`|niackm5uaa	What do you do when it is your time of the month? you BLEED. Your cat is in heat.

There is no blood involved in ovulation of women either! Women ovulate first THEN they bleed once they fail to fertilize the ovulating egg. SEE?? So many wrong answers to this poster and the funny thing is ..everyone who was the rudest and most judgemental was the MOST WRONG in their response. Made me laugh. Thanks!     As for your cat, I would have to agree with a few of the posters who advised a vet visit would be advised and right away. She shouldn't be bleeding. If a vet bill isn't something you were ready for right now (and come on, who is with this economic tragedy happening all around us) the before you go to the vet call your local government pet agency (Humane Society or SPCA) they can give you numbers to call for agency's that may be able to assist with all or a portion of the fees for emergency issues with your pet.   Good luck!|`|AA11287657	This could mean her body is now ready to mate with a male and she is able to have kittens.

PLEASE... have her spayed soon! |`|xqrwDmyUaa	If you do a little research online and read some reliable sources you'll find that cats do not get a period and bleed when in heat. They are not people, to other posters please do some research before you answer or imply the poster is stupid for not thinking it's a period because you are 100% wrong it's not a period. That cat should not be bleeding, it might be a miscarrage if the cat got out or it could be another problem, either way your cat needs to go to a vet. Yahoo answers is not a substitute for proper vet care, if you can't afford a vet then you should not have a pet, regular vet care is part of the responsibility of having a pet.

If it's a syrian, they all have to be separate before they hit maturity at about 4 months, or they could fight to the death.      When they're 4/5 weeks old, take them from the mom and separate them.  Don't touch them before they are 2 weeks old, just make sure mom has plenty of food and water.  They can go to new homes immediately at 5 weeks, sometimes 6.  Don't be concerned if mom eats some, or puts them in her cheekpouches.

They can be sold at around the 4 weeks that way you can handle them for a bit and they are bigger when taken away from there mother. But if you were to keep one i would choose a female as otherwise a male will make her pregnant again. You dont need to do anything with the babies and i wouldnt touch them until they have fur and are around 2 weeks as the mother might reject them and not look after them. Good luck with your little ones :)|`|Gw0NOW2Laa	hat's a perfectly normal litter size for a Syrian.

He may kill the babies or stress her out so much that she will kill them herself. Secondly, do not touch the babies no matter what. If you do, the mother will panic and either eat her young or ignore them. This sounds like a perfectly normal sized litter. In about 4 weeks the babies should have all of their fur, be walking around, have their eyes open and trying some hamster food. That is usually when you're able to touch them without stressing the mother out. Now, what kind of hamsters are they? Dwarf? Syrian? When they are 5 weeks old (maybe even at 4 weeks, depending on how they look) they should be able to be taken away from the mother. If they are Syrian hamsters, they should never be housed with another hamster. Syrian hamsters live alone and will fight until the other dies. As for Dwarf hamsters, I suggest you put each male in his own cage and the females may be able to stay housed together (ONLY if there is enough room and if you don't see any fighting going on). I recommend keeping the mother and father away from each other as well because you will just end up with yet another unwanted litter.|`|1uR3Kfftaa	do not feel bad...my hamster did the same thing! :) just go and talk to your local pet store owner and they will give you plenty of help and will more than likely take the babies and sell them for you. good luck!!|`|PEtJfD27aa	Relax. You have to separate them after they are done living of mom's milk and are eating solid foods (make sure that they are completely done living of mom's milk). When that happens separate the boys from the girls. You can leave the girls with the mom it's okay to do that.  (why would she take care of them and then throw them away when they don't need her anymore? Just a thought.)  Put the boys in another cage.After a couple weeks after they are eating solid foods you can sell them. When you do find people that you trust to give a hamster to. If you can't find enough homes ask a pet store if they will take them for you, you might get the best chance from the place that you bought your hamster from.    -Hamster Lover    P.S. No one is blaming you. My dad bought my brother a dwarf hamster to live with my dwarf hamster and she gave birth about a week ago to eight pups. (We bought her pregnant!!! LOL, kinda) THey are so cute!! The babies are starting to eat solid foods but they aren't done drinking their mom's milk.

If you have any more questions email me at www. bbcutiepie9@yahoo.com|`|c2eea378978ea495ce9f920b5686b806aa	Hi,    When the female hamster gives birth, it is very important not to touch the nest or babies and avoid cleaning the cage for the first 3 weeks or else the female hamster could panic and kill the hamster babies. If it is really necessary to 'clean' a cage area while the mother hamster is nursing her babies, you should only use a small piece of tissue to 'clean' the cage but avoid touching the nest area. Provide additional bread soaked in milk in a small food bowl for the mother hamster and babies as this will provided extra protein for these hamsters. The babies can be separated from the mother hamster when they are 4 weeks old as they become sexually mature.     If they are dwarf hamster then yes you can keep the females with the mother and the male babies with each other, but probably you will need to house the father in a separate cage and away from the mother since he would mate her again!!!     The easiest way to tell if your hamster is a male or female is to look at the distance between the two openings at the rear.  In male hamsters the anus and the penis (which is kept tucked up inside a small opening) are further apart. In females the anus and the vaginal opening are much closer together in comparison to the male hamster. A small tip on how you can identify the sex of your hamster is, that a male hamster will have a very small 'pink dot', while a female hamster will not have this 'pink dot'. To see detailed pictures of male hamsters and how it could be easy to distinguish them then read this hamster article.    http://www.hamster-club.com/article.asp?...    |`|VS4aocBOaa	They should be a month old before separating until there medium size be careful sometimes the momma hamster may eat some babies be aware of that.

There is the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, the American Staffordshire Terrier, the American Pit Bull Terrier and the American Bull Dog. All of these have been classed as "pit bulls" (as well as many mixes) by law enforcement and animal control. This really throws off any stats. Also, there are no stats that separate a dog bite from an attack except in the case of a fatal. If I remember correctly, most dog bite reports are actually from small dogs like Cocker Spaniels, Poodles, etc. Unfortunately, I think you will find that the "pit bull" type dog is source of more serious attacks than any other specific "breed"|`|zI4KXeL7aa	http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/se...    if they can train michal Vick's dogs to be normal dogs than they should not have a blame for fighting dogs    its the ppl not the animals|`|FrwxgBHtaa	http://www.goodpooch.com/MediaBriefs/GPc...|`|26eb5bd8609802ef3ef0b89f38ea320eaa	PitBillLovers.com should help you.......good luck.. i have a pit bull and it makes me angry how people want to ban this breed.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Statistics are pretty much worth crap. Dogs are misidentified (with over 15 similar looking breeds PLUS mixes that's very common), attacks from family pets of any breed generally go unreported, and so on. There is no reliable site that will give you stats of ANYTHING for those reasons. I would, instead, focus on things like additional news articles or reports of other breed attacks. Or maybe the Vick case, how they rehabbed those dogs.    Maybe turn attention to people and how we are responsible for training the dogs, and containing the dogs, and so on - shift the blame to those who should be blamed: the humans!

s76aC4G8aa	Are you leaving him in there too long?  If you are then the problem is he isn't getting out enough to go.  Depending on how old he is in months is how long he can hold it in hours.  If he has access to water all evening long then you're putting him to bed with a full tank.  Puppies need to be let out at least once during the night and cannot hold it all night long.  If you are not getting him out enough then he's going to end up peeing.  Don't put him in a crate for 8 hours and expect him to hold it.

Try letting it out more often. Also, the crate might be too big. If there is too much room in the crate your pup might think it's ok to pee at one end and sleep at the other. I do wish you had said how old your dog is. I would start though by monitoring it's fluid intake and letting it out more often than you have been.|`|Etd1VbKPaa	This is what we did, but I'm not sure if I can explain it well online...    My dog is bigger, so he had a pretty huge crate. He would pee at one part, and then spend the rest of his time away from that one area. So what many people told us to do was somehow block him so that the crate is not big enough for him to get away from the pee spot. I used a baby gate, and gradually gave him more and more room each time he was crated. I do not know if your crate is big enough to use a baby gate, but I'm sure you could find something to block of some space. Anyway, it worked great, and he stopped peeing in it.. The only thing is-make sure you left your dog outside as soon as you let it out of the crate! Otherwise it will be on your floor.    Good luck! :)|`|9Ip0N8LAaa	tie his willy in a knot|`|jLQRBpvdaa	dont let him go in there till he pees outside and when he does reward him and make sure his crate is only bg enough for acouple turn arounds and he cant move around into different spots in it|`|S4oqBf6laa	you can get mats that absorb pee and some spray which u spray on the mat and the dog will pee on the mat, then just make sure its closer to the door and then outside. or when you wake up take him straight outside and wait till he pees then do this every couple of hours. it worked with my staffy|`|AA11308841	depends how old is the puppy and how long he stays i the crate,normally dogs wouldn't pee where they sleep unless they cannot really contain themselves    |`|C71wRTYPaa	Sometimes their little bladders can't hold it. They have to grow a little bit to hold it through the night. She'll get it. When you take her out, give her a lot of praise or a treat after she tinkles outside|`|6xMml5V7aa	If you've left water in there for him, then reduce the amount you put in. He should stop peeing on his own anyway after a while, dogs don't like peeing in their own territory.|`|AA11097657	This can be common problem. Here's what I do.    Feed every meal in the crate ( dogs won't go where they eat )    Raise the crate higher, on a table. ( it's natural to pee at floor height but not up high )|`|AA10072754	Is the crate too big?  Animals like dogs don't pee in their bed area.  It could be you aren't letting him or her out enough or your crate is too big.  Also I wouldn't give a puppy water after his last potty break (which should be right before bed time) to eliminate accidents in the bed area.

This could be something serious.|`|3AmvVsNHaa	Right, if your puppy doesn't drink much water, you must encourage her to, by dipping our finger in the water and putting in in her mouth, if that doesn't work, get a calpol syringe (the needless ones) and get put her near her waterbowl, and take some water into the syringe, put it in her mouth and push the water in from the syringe, our dog had the same problem, just keep giving her lots of water and small quantities of food to see if she keeps it down|`|ADJoO2h7aa	Possible it has eaten either something bad or just grass.|`|F219nhJkaa	umm have your dog accidently aten any chocolate by any chance one time my dog did that and he was sick for about a while but hes better now. go to on google.com id suggest and look up and type in whats happened to your dog and figure it out also id tell the vet that the dog is still sick. hoped this helped|`|5K3YTGnvaa	Take her to the vet right away, she could easily be having a negative reaction to one of the vaccines.

I would call him back ASAP.
AA10072754	Put their food out once and if they don't eat it take it away.  The next day they will most likely eat it when you set it out.  They won't starve to death in 24 hours.  Ignore their begs later on in the day.  Don't give in.    If you had a child that wanted to eat lunch at 3pm instead of 12, would you let it control your life like that?  Dogs are the same way.  You are letting them get away with it so they will continue to do it.|`|C6Ozw9draa	Erm well, you will have to get them hungry.    Put food in their bowls at the time you want to feed them. After a half an hour remove it. Dont feed them until the next day. Repeat until they eat when you put the food down|`|TWfDAYK4aa	Once a day is really not enough.  You should break up their meal into 2 meals, morning and night.  Approximately 12 hours apart.  As for getting them to eat when you want, you put the food down for 15 minutes, if they do not eat in that 15 minutes you pick it up and put it away until the next feeding.  You repeat this as often as need be, but usually only take a couple of times.  Dogs are not stupid, they will not starve themselves.  But to get them into a routine, you might have to get tough.|`|4higWvgaaa	Put the food down for 20-30 minutes.  Dog doesn't eat - pick it up.  The dog won't starve itself.  Eventually it will eat.  |`|43dcc871ca75e3abc9a15c8a4eb31609aa	When they get hungry enough, they will eat when you put the food out for them. It will happen before they starve, but you have to be patient in training them. Due to their age, it will take a lot longer than if they were puppies.|`|JpdVidqxaa	Dogs should really eat twice a day, especially the large/giant breeds to prevent bloat.  You should try to get them to eat when you want them to.  You should put the bowls down when it is time and if they don't eat in 15 minutes, take the bowl away.  They will eventually get hungry and eat when you want them to.  You should not leave food out at night for your newf.  Feed him in the early evening and if he doesn't eat take it away until morning.  If he bloated after eating in the middle of the night you would not know it and be there to help him.|`|MKa0nv5laa	you just have to let them eat when they want. they wont eat on command.|`|dqWWer54aa	If you stick to a schedule, they will eventually learn. I have never known a dog that will starve itself, they will get the hang of it. If one of them just IS NOT eating during the time you picked, maybe try a split-schedule (once in AM once in PM) so they have more opportunity. That's what I had to do with my doggies. You can  mix a bit of wet dog food in with it if it's dry food - just to get them more interested. Leave the food down for maybe an hour, then take it up until your next feeding time. Give treats as snacks too if they aren't responsive to it right away, just to take some of the edge off. If that doesn't work - talk to your vet for more advice. I'm just talkin from my own experience. Hope this helps ya :)|`|1d35920fc6ea9ad0c8b1685a92aa62a9aa	 Feed them once a day and at the same time out of different feed dishes and very soon they will eat at this feeding time, and no you will not be unkind for doing this!
IgcHVMmbaa	Nope, looks like a crappy dog food.    Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your dog? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.    Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.    Thankfully, there are some excellent dog foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Pedigree, Kibbles n' Bits, Beneful, Ol'Roy.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Canidae All Life Stages, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timberwolf Organics.    Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!    Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by the crappy pet food companies! They also often get paid to sell some of their products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)    A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Canidae Grain Free All Life Stages, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now! and Sold Gold Barking At The Moon, Taste of the Wild.    Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo. If you can't find a food, most of the high quality food brands have websites with store locators on them.    Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/    Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing new slowly in with the old over about a two week period), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies.      Another option for feeding dogs is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:  http://www.barfworld.com/  http://www.rawfed.com/  http://www.rawlearning.com/  http://www.wysong.net/controversies/rawm...      Also remember that freefeeding (leaving food down) is the fast lane to canine obesity. Make sure to have scheduled feeding times based on the feeding instructions on your dog's food.

Four stars is a decent food, five stars is a great food, and six stars is an excellent food.)      Darksong~|`|gjD8pndjaa	not the best....I don't like the brewers rice/corn/animal fat in there.  lots of fillres|`|3BMBZtDxaa	I would say no.    There are a lot of grains in there which aren't essential in a dog's diet (they need some but not a lot). Not to mention they can't digest grain very well resulting in some bad medical conditions. Yet there is Brewers Rice, ground corn, brown rice, and grains like that in it.    There should be about 30% of crude protein in your dog's diet as well. There is about 24% in this food which is okay, but there should be a lot more protein than grain.    Calcium is very low in this food, yet, calcium is a major thing in your dog's diet. Omega 3 is a huge thing for your dog as well, but there is less than 1% of it!     At least there's a lot of Vitamin E...    I would recommend Taste of the Wild or Wellness. Those two are very good brands of dog food that don't contain by-products and provide all the ingredients of a healthy dog!|`|VxKH7KHmaa	NO.    A good food will have NO corn, and contain real meat, vegetables, fruits, healthy vitamins, oils, and minerals.    Try comparing to any of these good foods....    EVO  Innova  Canidae  Origin  Go Natural  Wellness  |`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	The top 5 ingredients are what most of the meal is composed of.  Since,Corn and Chicken "meal" are in the top it makes me think this is an inexpensive filler food.  Corn is a filler and "meal" could mean ground up animals parts such as beaks or claws from the chicken.      If this was a cheaper brand consider buying a brand (that maybe a bit more expensive per bag) but, has a meat as the 1st ingredient.  If you find a food that does have a meat as  1 your dog will eat less and get full quicker and get all the nutrients it needs.  This will save you money over time even though per bag may cost more.    My fav brands...Science Diet, Bil-Jack (my dogs LOVE!), or Blue (really good food but, dogs didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped).      Good luck and good eats!|`|W0ZQQK4taa	No, it IS better then some brands, but it certainly is not the best!    Some good quality foods are :    Canidae  http://www.canidae.com/    Wellness  Wellness CORE  http://www.wellnesspetfood.com/    Solid Gold  http://www.solidgoldhealth.com/    Innova  Eagle pack Holistic  Chicken Soup for the dog Lovers Soul  Orijen  EVO  Merrick   Blue Buffalo  Avoderm    Never get low quality foods like :    Ol' Roy  Purina  Pedigree  IAMS  Eukanuba  Science Diet  BilJac    For they all have, Corn,Soy, By-Products, Artificial Colorings/Flavors.    This website should be able to help you on picking out a good quality food. Stick on the 4-5-6 star range.  http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...    This website is good to!  http://www.thedogbowl.com/      Good Luck!|`|26PPwzrWaa	Horrible, nothing I would ever feed my dogs. |`|Co9A2Ibkaa	it sounds okay, although i always heard corn meal shouldnt be listed in the first 3 ingredients.  That means its a filler.......there's quite a bit in there. I just switched my dog to a brand called Evo.  it has NO grains in it only meat. expensive but supposedly you do not need to feed as much food with this.................|`|AA10072754	not the absolute worst but nowhere near the best.    Also take into consideration its not only whats on the back of the bag but how good the ingredients are.  I'm not sure how well Authority's ingredients hold up but by the sounds of it (lots of corn and brewer's rice) they may not be as good as other foods in that price range (such as Canidae or however you spell that)|`|AA10805458	It doesn't look terrible from the label,  unfortunately pet food companies are only required to actually put exactly what is on their label, in their pet food every 3-6 months ( i cant remember the figure right off the top of my head)  The less you pay for it the more likely it is to have low quality ingredients and unusable fiber in it.  Brands such as Iams, Eukanuba, Hill's science diet, purina O.N.E. or pro plan or more expensive foods are typically what you want to feed your pet.  Ol' Roy  or Alpo is not very nutritive and most of the food is fillers and non digestible by products. |`|rMDHNPnEaa	I don't know about all of that. I feed my dogs Iams. They are healthy and seem to like the stuff. They have a nice coat and their teeth and gums are healthy.    My vet even recommends Iams. One of my dogs has pancrietitis so she can only eat the dry. Maybe an occasional small amount of boiled chicken. I have to watch the amt of fats she eats or it will kill her.    She does very well on Iams. I buy the kind in a green bag. I get a 20 pound bag for about $20. (depends on sales and where you buy it. I found Kmart to have the best deal. Sometimes Kroger will have it on sale.)    |`|JCozkN7faa	There are alot of better foods not recognized by AAFCO! This food isn't a good one!    Too many fillers,grains,and junk!    Better dog foods are:  Blue  Eagle Pack  Canidae  Wellness  Innova  Evo  Nature's Variety  Chicken soup for the dog lover's soul  |`|LU69IZwSaa	No it is not a good food. Look for a dog food that has Chicken rather than Chicken meal first. Chicken meal is just filler, not nutritious.
5SJ5RIASaa	I don't think it is rude to ask for a new puppy. One thing you may want to consider though is what did your old dog die of. If it was anything contagious you may want to wait awhile before you get a new dog. Also are you prepared for the housebreaking, chewing, and the whining a new puppy does. I don't think it is disrespectful to your old dog at all just make sure your ready for the new one. Sorry to hear about your dog and good luck on your new puppy.|`|AZXYoUHIaa	It's different for everyone.

It's not like you are immediately replacing a spouse that has died. Unfortunately, dogs come and go throughout our lives since we are lucky to get 15 years out of them. My parent's dog, Dawber, is going to be 13 in Feb. and I'm terrified of thinking about the day we have to say goodbye to him. I am an only child, and I have grown up with that dog, he's like my little brother. I have a 3 year old dog of my own now, but it won't be any easier when Dawber has to leave us. I hope my parents get another dog after Dawber passes to help ease the pain.|`|AA10072754	No its not rude.  Most people wait because they honestly aren't ready to start a relationship with another dog.  I usually have to wait about six months.

nmercOm7aa	A rabbit cage that is kept clean with a good litter should not smell. It is more the urine than the poop that can cause odour. Intact (not spayed or neutered) rabbits can smell more. Cleaning the scent glands regularly and help also.     Do not use and chemical in the cage. White vinegar and water is good for cleaning and disinfecting. Soap and water works well too. There are some pet safe cleaners and deodorizers that you can get at a pet store.     Rabbits can tolerate the cold better than the heat, but too much is not good. Having a hutch in a garage or shed can help with the cold and rain/snow. A cover is a good idea too. Stuffing the sleeping area with hay and/or straw can help keep it warm. You will need to make sure that the water bottle doesn't freeze and that your rabbit have enough water when it is cold.     Rabbits can be litter trained, so cleaning is easier. If you clean the litter box and cage at least twice a week (litter box 3-4 times), the smell should be minimal. Getting it spayed or neutered will help a lot.|`|8iQFdkIhaa	Well u definitely shouldn't have it in the house cuz they smell BAD!  and i think they can survive pretty cold conditions, because where I live it's below freezing, and the rabbits are out year round.

Nothing bad should happen to your bunny in the winter; however, if your rabbit shows adverse symptoms you could move him to the basement of your house for more warmth.

AA12083992	If they are males neutering would probably help, they won't have the urge to mark. The first thing to remember about house training a puppy is there ability to hold themselves is limited. a rule of thumb is they can hold "it" usually 1 hour for each month of age. 2 months old = 2 hours, 3 months old = 3 hours, etc. when your puppy wakes up (morning, nap, whatever) the pup has to go, right then! take the pup out. when the pup eats or drinks, it has to go, take the pup out. after exercise (play), take the pup out. when the pup does it's thing outside praise it. a lot. tell the pup how good, how smart it is.  you have to pay attention to the pups "looking for it's spot" behavior. when you see that behavior indoors, whisk the pup out. if you catch the pup in the act, simply tell it "NO!" and whisk it outside. if you find a puddle or pile after the fact, clean it up with an enzyme cleaner (pet food store) get a newspaper and hit.... yourself in the head and say "i should have been paying more attention" daytime training they get pretty fast. night time training is easier if you crate train the pup. also remember the one hour/one month rule. you will have to get up through the night to take the pup out. good luck|`|47f6f8c64034369014f8cb722fd74d72aa	In all honesty... you seem to be doing everything correct. Follow them when they "disappear" to leave you a present in the house and give them a smack on the butt with a loosely rolled newspaper and put them immediately outside! You've praised them for going outside now discipline them for going inside!!!|`|9a4ba5804e7f2be298af206295294f39aa	What I did with my puppy was to start off on paper, everytime she went to squat in the house I would put her on the paper until she went, and then praise her for going.  Once she was regularly using the paper I started moving it towards the door over a period of time, a inch or two at a time until she was actually at the door (this took quite a while), and then I started leaving the back door open with the paper just outside the door (obviously weighted down) ... she soon got used to going outside after this.      Although if you don't have a secure garden it's a lil harder to leave the door open for them, but getting them to the door in the first place is a start.      Good luck!|`|35eb758a45d25a0c7540a6cbd2afebd8aa	I had a similar problem. At first, his area was limited to just living room. So he would seaze any opporunity to sneak in any other room and did the thing there. Later we allowed him to go anywhere in the house and thats when he started doing in outside. Now he will hold till we go for a walk and wont even do it in the yard. I am not a dog expert, but I think that they dont want to mess up their territory. Thats why they dont do it in the crate. My friend did the thing with newspaper, also with praise every time his dog did it outside, but he kept the newspaper just in case. Never actually taught dog to do it strictly outside. When his dog was about 9 months he stopped going on the newspaper. Just like that! Now he holds it till he goes out for a walk. So my biggest advice, get the dog familiar to the whole house and have a nerves of steal. Good luck!|`|f8ac3806f1b8ec528a46f470775cbcb3aa	Hi Bucca    Sounds to me like you are doing alot right with your pups. One suggestion would be to attach a cue word like "get busy" or "hurry up" to the act of your dogs eliminating. Never get angry with them if you come across any "mistakes" in the house.    This article has a good strategy which you could follow - http://www.dog-obedience-training-review...    Good luck!|`|AA11918558	The first thing to do is as soon as they wake up and not a second after take them outside, to the same spot (everytime). The first thing they do when they wake up is go pee. They are too young to start "marking" territory. Their problem, along with any young child is that their bladders have not grown as fast as their body has and when it's full, it's full. You are doing everything right so far. Just make sure you ALWAYS take them to the same spot. I would start out by taking them outside every half hour (even if you know they don't have to pee, you are training their brains too) and if they did the deed then praise them like they just did the greatest thing in the world, i mean make a party out of it! Then reward them with their fav treat (but only give them one). If they make a mess in the house, do not make a noise, raise your voice, or call their name. Simply walk up to them quietly, pick them up, and place them outside in case they did not finish, do not punish (kennel) them unless you actually witness them in the act. and when i say punish i do not mean raise your voice or smack their butts. and when they're done doing the deed outside place them in their kennel for 15 min exactly (best to use an egg timer). and do that everytime you catch them in the act. do that for a couple days and you should start noticing a change.     FYI - you can kennel your dog for 15 min (max) to change ANY unwanted behavior. And do it EVERYTIME they do something undesireable. They will more than likely reaffend immediately. And they do this for a reason. They're trying to figure out why they were put in jail. Dog's are highly social animals and DO NOT like isolation. That is the worst thing in the world to a dog. they will go over every detail that landed them in their jail cell and will probably test you several different times so that thay can conclusively determine the behavior that landed them there. Dogs are very smart and only want to please their masters. Training a dog is no different than training a child. It really is simple once you learn how. All it takes is persistence, determination, repitition and a whole lot of patience and understanding.    Good luck!    P/S - Let me know if you need further help.

When your cat starts going there all the time, you can just take away the tray.  It can take some time and not all cats are fast learners.  Some don't ever care to use it.  But, heck, it's worth a try to avoid the litterbox detail.    If you try and you get your cat to do it, please repost.

83944bb1308121d4e488f32176fe2cd1aa	The dogs will have to work it out as to which one is going to be alpha dog. Most of the time dogs can do this without intervention from owners. Get your Husky and take a damp cloth that you rub all over the Pom then rub the damp cloth on the Husky so the new dog has both his smell and the Pom's. It may help for the introduction process.|`|AA11656632	Not a good idea.

Huskies can see small dogs as toys, or even as prey, and a tragedy can occur very quickly.  Good luck.    ps - there are many websites and books with clues on introducing new dogs to each other.  Do some homework.|`|AA12224385	no because i have a husky and it trys to eat my moms  pomeranion but i have a nexted door naboor who has a husky and it likes little  animal so i guess it depends on the husky|`|AA11650317	You can improve your chances of these dogs getting along by doing the following:  1. Get a male husky, since your current dog is a female. It is more likely to tolerate a dog of the opposite gender.   1.5. Get your Husky from a reputable breeder who breeds for temperament, or you may end up with a neurotic husky. Most huskies are sociable and work well with other dogs.  2. Nueter your dog early- as soon as his testicles drop. An uneutered husky will retain a high prey drive. One day your pom will play a game of chase and end up being seen as prey. Very important that you neuter your male dog.  3. Do everything possible to ensure your female retains her alpha position in the house. When you bring the puppy home, give your pom extra attention and affection. Feed the Pom first. Attend to the Pom first. Let the husky think he is submissive to the female when he is 3 months and 20 pounds and by the time he is an adult, he will not be as eager to establish dominance (IF you neuter him.). This is very important to prevent hostilities.  4. Hard exercise. Most huskies get into trouble because they are bored. these are fine working dogs and not meant to sit around in the house on the sofa watching TV. A Huky requires 1- 2 hours of daily exercise at the very least to ensure it does not chew up dry wall or tease your pom. Many people get a husky and think a walk around the park is sufficient. It is not.   5. Supervision: Both dogs are considered sociable with other dogs if raised with them. (It is the Malamute which is slightly more unsociable with dogs). However with a husky, if you want to get a cat, you better do it now or it will attack it. It is always smart to supervise playtime as a husky is larger and even if socialized properly might hurt your littler dog in play without meaning to do so.

kgwpvJMoaa	Unfortunately, yes.  I have had the personal experience of my two of my hamsters killing two of my canaries.  The canaries had gotten out of their cage and were loose in my bird/hamster room.  Each one landed into a different Syrian hamster cage (I'm assuming the birds were going after the seed) and each was killed by the hamster in the cage they landed in.  One was killed and barely eaten, one was mutilated.  It is the nature of the hamsters.  I don't know why the canaries didn't fly out of there but perhaps since the canaries had lived in the same room with the hamsters since I'd owned them, they didn't view the hamsters as a threat.    Now a hamster couldn't kill a bird the size of an eagle, nor would I expect any hamster to actively hunt a bird but I'm sure some will do so if given the oppurtunity.    -Janice  http://www.holmdenhillhaven.com|`|ddf03b3b1b0f092aa23c64758a85a19baa	In the wild a hamsters diet consists of seeds, flowers and animal protein (worms and small insectes).    Obviously a hamster would not be able to catch a bird but if it finds a leftover piece of bird it would probably eat it.     It all depends on personal taste.    Golden hamsters and dwarf hamsters will gratefully accept roast chicken bones with a little meat remaining. They seem particularly to enjoy gnawing the gristly joints of chicken drumsticks.|`|70a7c5900cc64611b4f4a2dbfe8fb706aa	a bird has a larger mouth then a hamster.

I think your puppy needs to be de-wormed. Puppies are born with roundworms, and need to be wormed regularly until their fecal test shows clear.    Also I am betting that there is corn in his food. Corn and soy are the ingredients that cause the most gas. It will likely help to change his kibble to one with no corn, soy or beet pulp...Also, a spoon of plain yogurt will aid in his digestion and likely reduce the gas.|`|AA12083992	A vet would be a good idea. Any time their is a problem with a pet a vet is a good idea. You may also want to look at what you're feeding the pup. Poor quality foods create more gas than the better foods. Our pets need quality pet food. Read the ingredients list and learn what the stuff on there is and what it does (or does not do) to/for our pets. A quick pet food 101. If the pet food contains corn/corn products or by products it is a poor quality food. Do not pay attention to advertising, they all say there food is great. Corn is a filler that can trigger skin problems. (allergies, skin problems, itching and excessive shedding) By products is anything from an animal not fit for human consumption, including cancerous tissue. Quality foods have meat as the first ingredient. California Natural, Solid Gold, Innova and Merrick are a few of the best brands available. If you want to learn more check out: http://www.sagekeep.com/petfood.htm    www.api4animals.org/facts?p=359& more=1    http://animalark.eapps.com/animal/PetFoo...|`|gi6lNXStaa	you need to change his food.  like blue for example, not too expensive, but it will make him healthier, poo less, and even eat less. some food can really harm your dog in the long run. in the end you the price pretty much even out (if you worry about money)    if it not the food, then you just might have a pups that like to fart alot. hey my fart every now and then, you just learn to live with it. the funny things is that you don't hear it coming. one minute you playing, petting, and then all of a sudden your overwhelm with a smell of gas. you start looking around, pointing and blame other people, and the dog is right there in your lab acting all innocent.     don't worry too much i say, if he acting normal and all. but if you're serious worry you can alway take him to the vet.     here some link to pick a good food:  http://www.rateitall.com/i-24987-science...    http://sg.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|614d40d1bb6fd7907033b682825bff14aa	Has he been wormed? If so , he may need another dose of de-wormer.     And you may as well get used to it. Dogs fart, I don't care what you feed them. You can train your dog not to do it around you-I did it once with a lab. I wouldn't recommend it, though. Passing gas is a natural process of every creature's physiology and it' serves it's purpose.|`|pm7RebfMaa	First of all don't let your puppy go more than 3 days without defecating.  It becomes an emergency at that point.  As for the farting issue, a good quality diet will reduce the smell emitting from your dog.  With a quality food such as Iams/Eukanuba (for example) the first thing you'll notice is the absence of excess gas (farting).    As for the corn issue, high quality corn, properly cooked, is a digestible, nutritious carbohydrate source in dry diets. The use of corn in a food recipe doesn't necessarily mean the food is bad or good. You should consider all the ingredients and the overall nutrition they provide.  Dogs are omnivores, they require more than just meat.  They need a carbohydrate source for sustainable energy.    Also ingredients are listed by weight, not amount used.  Chicken may be listed first on a bag of food because it, compared to dry ground corn, weighs more.  You need to know a little more about pet nutrition and how to read packaging labels before you can make assumptions like that.    The "guaranteed analysis" on the bags is the best indicator of the quality of food.      by 8 weeks of age, feeding 2-3 times a day is adequate.  be careful of the AMOUNT you feed however as labradors are notorious overeaters.

Alguien ah escribi que son muy independientes, y si es la verdad. Yo tengo dos gatos  y tienen una personalidad completamente distinta, es verdad que causan alergias, pero si los tienes limpios y no duermes con ellos, no pasa nada, yo soy alrgica, y aqu estoy. Lo que si es cierto es que no les puedes hacer cari?os cuando tu quieras, tiene que ser cuando ellos digan, como quieran, porque si no les gusta te mandan a la ......ji ji. A la mayora de la gente no les gustan porque todava los asocian con la brujera, y los demonios, yo pienso que es por eso. Pero tiene mas ventajas tener un gato que un perro, no es que no me gusten los perros, tambin tengo una perrita, la cual quiero mucho, pero los gatos van solos a hacer sus necesidades, a los cachorritos los tienes que ense?ar, el gato si no le das comida, la busca, el perro se tiene que esperar a que su amo se digne a darle, el gato se ba?a solo, con sus babas, pero se ba?a, al perro lo tienes que ba?ar(si se deja, ji ji).

Debido a ello necesitan un animal que los idolatre y los haga sentirse un poco ms grandes y as sentirse que valen algo.    El gato es un animal orgulloso e independiente a diferencia del perro que es una animal sentimentalmente dependiente. El perro es un animal fiel hasta la muerte. Es tan fiel que no se si es fiel o es un i.d.i.o.t.a. El perro es un animal maravilloso. Pero tiene un enorme defecto. No importa lo mal que lo traten, que no le den de comer. Que le den palo a cada rato. Si se presenta la oportunidad, da su vida por su amo, sin pensarlo dos veces.      El perro es un animal estupendo para los ni?os y personas sentimentalmente dependientes, para cuidar, detectar narcticos, como perros policas, para rescate en estructuras colapsadas, entre otras muchas cosas.    Estas personas psicodependientes necesitan sentir que alguien las necesita y que sin ellas no pueden vivir. Son personas en muchos casos consentidas que necesitan continuamente afecto. Afecto que sino le proporcionan los que lo(a) rodean, el perro si esta dispuesto a darlo por nada. Cosa que no pueden lograr al lado de un gato, ya que se sentiran por mucho al mismo nivel del gato. Y obviamente eso no les gusta.    Las personas tienden a creer que una persona es buena cuando un perro le bate la cola. Lo malo que la mayora de los perros por maravillosos que sean, es que le baten la cola a cualquier persona, aunque sea un criminal o un ser ruin y despreciable.    Los felinos, son psicolgicamente seres dominantes, altivos, seguros de si mismo. En ellos no hay nada que corregir o mejorar. Ni psicolgicamente, ni fsicamente. Son seres perfectos. Incluso si ensucian limpian (Aunque hay una que otra excepcin). Al perro hay que ense?arle.     Algunos argumentan que el gato es un animal poco inteligente porque no se le puede ense?ar nada o es muy difcil ense?arle a hacer algo. Lo que pasa es que el no es bobo. Y sabe que si hace caso de lo que alguien desea que haga, perder privilegios y le toca ponerse a trabajar. Ya no podr dormir en nuestra cama todo el da. Le tocara oler maletas de da y de noche en un aeropuerto, etc.    Estas personas psicodependientes Prefieren estar al servicio del perro limpindole. Que tener un animal limpio, inteligente, orgulloso, independiente y majestuoso como un gato.|`|d5f06617674582cc4c8ab7275a810f87aa	por que tienen muchas enfermedades pero son muy lindos xD?|`|4f683063451c8c2bcab4c683f0cdd424aa	Porque siempre lo relacionan con peliculas de demonios|`|2627f359d1d86136564f326b3687b2f8aa	Yo porque me causan alergia sus pelos,|`|ad99d3ffd9d11fff0f35a591a37c8dbdaa	PORQUE NUNCA TUVIERON UNO, NO SABEN DEL AMOR QUE BRINDAN, ADEMAS ENTIENDEN TODO, COMO LOS PERROS.

Voir lien joint pour la definition dun hybride.    http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybride    Je te joins (extrait galement de wikipedia), la definition dune chimre, que ce soit pour lhomme ou pour lanimal...    "En gntique, on peut rencontrer des organismes qui possdent deux gnotypes distincts. Cette anomalie est extrmement rare chez l'tre humain mais pas totalement impossible. On compte environ 40 cas dans le monde. Peu aprs la fcondation, si deux jumeaux se forment, il arrive qu'un ?uf migre vers l'autre ?uf. Une fusion se produit alors et le dveloppement continue normalement. Le f?tus possde ainsi certaines parties du corps avec un gnotype donn et le reste caractris par un autre gnotype, proche mais similaire  celui d'un proche parent. Une femme possdait par exemple un gnotype spcifique pour sa tte alors que son tronc tait gntiquement diffrent. Elle devait subir une transplantation du rein et les analyses effectues sur un de ses fils montrait qu'elle ne pouvait tre sa mre. Une tude plus pousse permit de dcouvrir qu'elle possdait des ovaires avec deux gnomes. Les mdecins supposent que les chimres apparaissent suite  l'utilisation de mdicaments pour amliorer la fertilit.   On rencontre aussi des chimres interspcifique (entre espces). Le plus souvent ces espces sont proches, avec en particulier les chimres souris-rat et mouton-chvre. Les mouton-chvre sont striles, les souris-rat aboutissent  la disparition des cellules de rat. Des chimres d'espces trs proches peuvent tre fertile (espces de souris Mus musculus et M. caroli)".|`|440d52dc71f85f36f67c68ab43c4dd25aa	C!|`|7c4fd90944f21be5b0e48a32ea0d8e94aa	c|`|931dbc13ad7209ad1b6966b8cbddea49aa	rponse C !!

I use an orange shampoo as it is good for their skin repeals flea's and leaves them smelling good.  Also dilute the shampoo with some water in a large container as this way it will rinse out better and not leave you with another reason to itch.|`|OG6QNyJoaa	probably a good idea to bathe him. i recommend baby shampoo also|`|AA12295091	Yes you should if you haven't gave him one recently. If you have or haven't either way you should go to the vet and see if he has any skin problems. If he doesn't i think it's just a case of dandruff. all dogs have lots of dandruff during the winter and it makes them pretty itchy sometimes. there is dandruff shampoos so you can relieve your puppy. also there is skin itching shampoos. so just take a look around and ask about it. good luck....oh and also he can't possibly have fleas because they don't come out during the wintertime...unless you're in the southern areas where its up to 80 degrees. then you should worry about fleas.|`|e3ac6f4b3dc0775c5c44446d5d6c5495aa	You can use as the other gentlemen suggested use baby shampoo which I have used on my dogs, but check for fleas and he could also have a skin infection so if it continues past his bath it could be an infection, and it also could mean an allergy to his food or something else he ate perhaps a type of dog bone.

My vet doesn't suggest that you wash your dog very often (no more than 2 or 3 times a year).  It can strip him of protective oils and can make dry skin worse.  He suggests one of the prescribed flea killers, like Advantage or Front Line for fleas and ticks and those "doggy wipes" that you can find in a pet store to freshen them up.  I've been doing that and it seems to work well.|`|ff475f2b145466c8fd9c8d368fe0cff3aa	Itching can be caused by many things. If your dog hasn't been given a bath lately, then yes give it a bath in a mild or hypoallergenic dog shampoo or an infant shampoo/babywash. BUT REMEMBER  over bathing causes skin irritation and dry itchy skin too. So if you give your dog a lot of baths already, that may be it's problem. Foods high in corn and meal also cause a lot of skin problems as do fleas and allergies. Weed out the problem by eliminating the possible causes and things will get better. If your dog has hot spots , skin allergies or dry skin, it may be lacking essential io;s which many dogs are (their foods don't provide it), a great thing to do is supplement them with skin and coat enhancers. They are cheap and work great!|`|06528b6c550ea03ee99914e184b0810baa	Go to Wa*Mart and get some flea itchy stuff and see what happens! it may just be dandruff, my dog gets dandruff all the time. just like a person, giver him bath regularly!
pHdQCBTyaa	SJ08, the best way to deal with this is to see your veterinarian. Skin diseases are a very, very comprehensive subject, and often there is an underlying problem for it. A 'rash' can quite literally have 100 reasons. However, if you want to try something yourself first, your dog appears otherwise normal, and the rash is not too bad and has appeared only recently you can try a mild steroid cream. Depending were you live 0.5% hydrocortisone cream may be available over the counter. Sometimes they are mixed with antibiotics or antifungal drugs. You can use them, too. If you cannot buy the cream you may have a friend with mild allergies who uses steroid creams. Ask him/her to spare you a small amount and rub it, sparingly, on the affected skin. Use only little and only twice daily for 1-2 days. If the rash does not improve and you continue to use the cream the skin might actually get worse. This would surely be the point where you should have a probfessional have a look.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	You don't want to keep it damp, you want it to dry, try a medicated powder.|`|KQeAx469aa	You should see your local vet.

If you shave her this may cause more trouble than good. think what happens when you shave a delicate are. Dont take her to the vet straight away as this may cost you a hell of alot of money! try things like sudacreme or nappy rash creams. You can try bathing her in tea tre oil that can help. Or maybe herbal remidies. If you see no improvemnt in a few months then take her to the vet but they might try doing skin scrapings which tend to be a waste of time and money. If there is no improvement try talking to a good dog breeder of the breed you own. Check for websites and ask for recomended breeders. They can help but ask a few.  x

A anemia no c?o pode ocorrer nas grandes infesta??es, uma vez que o carrapato se alimenta do sangue do animal. Mas n?o  necessria uma grande quantidade de carrapatos para que a Babesiose ou a Anaplasmose sejam transmitidas. s vezes, um ou dois carrapatos que estejam carregando formas infectantes dos protozorios causadores dessas enfermidades s?o o bastante para que o c?o contraia uma dessas doen?as.    Assim, o controle do carrapato deve ser constante e qualquer sinal de apatia, febre, falta de apetite e mucosas (gengivas ou conjuntiva) plidas em c?es que costumam ter carrapatos,  motivo de uma visita ao veterinrio e um exame de sangue, para detec??o da Babesia ou da Erlichia. Elas s?o tratveis quando diagnosticadas a tempo.       Foto: Dr. Maurcio Aquino      Mas o que fazer para evitar que o c?o pegue carrapatos?  Infelizmente, n?o h nenhum esquema de tratamento preventivo. Se o c?o freqenta reas infestadas por carrapatos, ele certamente ir peg-los. Regi?es com vegeta??o em stios ou fazendas, s?o os lugares mais comuns. Porm, existem muitos casos de pessoas que tem problemas com carrapatos dentro de seus canis ou quintais. s vezes, num passeio a uma pra?a ou parque, o c?o pode se infestar.     E como combater o carrapato?  Assim como as pulgas, o carrapato n?o  um problema s do animal, mas sim do ambiente. O carrapato, em todos os seus estgios de vida (desde larva at adulto),  muito resistente. Assim, combater o carrapato  difcil. Voc pode elimin-lo do c?o facilmente com banhos carrapaticidas, porm, o inimigo que voc n?o v, ou seja, os ovos e larvas, est?o no ambiente e nele sobrevivem durante muitos meses. Muitos s?o os casos de proprietrios que vivem combatendo o carrapato no c?o, mas nunca conseguem extermin-lo por completo.    Um outro detalhe  que os carrapatos colocam seus ovos na vegeta??o e tambm em frestas das paredes e piso. Dessa forma, todos esses lugares tm que ser tratados e n?o os c?es somente. Quem tem na vizinhan?a terrenos com mato, cria??o de animais como cavalos e gado, pode sofrer com os carrapatos, pois esses parasitas s?o capazes de escalar altos muros em busca de alimento.    Um combate eficaz ao carrapato inclui:    No animal:     banhos carrapaticidas. Quando a infesta??o  grande, repetir os banhos a cada 15 dias;   animais de plos longos devem ser tosados no ver?o, poca em que o calor e umidade fazem com que a incidncia de carrapatos aumente muito;    produtos carrapaticidas de longa dura??o, em gotas para aplica??o tpica (local) ou spray, podem ser aplicados, a critrio do veterinrio.     No ambiente:     uso de carrapaticidas: aplicar nos canis, casinha dos c?es, em plantas e canteiros, atentando para frestas nas paredes ou pisos e ralos. Repetir o tratamento a cada 15 dias;   em canis de alvenaria, o uso da "vassoura de fogo"  muito eficaz. O calor ir destruir todos os estgios do carrapato. Repetir o tratamento a cada 15 dias; uma op??o caseira s?o aparelhos com jato de vapor d'gua fervendo;   se possvel, fechar todas as frestas existentes nos canis ou paredes dos quintais, assim como no piso;   mude de produto a cada 2 ou 3 aplica??es, para que o carrapato n?o desenvolva resistncia e o tratamento passe a ser ineficaz.    importante:     filhotes, fmeas gestantes e gatos n?o devem ser banhados com produtos carrapaticidas;   CONSULTE O VETERINRIO antes de usar qualquer produto;   banhos carrapaticidas devem ser dados com o cuidado de n?o permitir ao animal lamber o produto durante o banho. A ingest?o pode causar intoxica??o grave;   animais com ferimentos abertos (feridas ou queimaduras) n?o devem ser tratados;   existem carrapaticidas para uso em c?es, porm, muitas vezes s?o recomendados produtos de uso em bovinos e cavalos. AS DOSAGENS S?O DIFERENTES. Consulte o seu veterinrio antes de usar esses produtos;   retire os animais do ambiente que ir receber o tratamento contra carrapatos at que o produto usado seque completamente.    O combate ao carrapato deve ser intensivo e durante um longo perodo de tempo. Nos meses mais quentes, a infesta??o pode voltar e os cuidados devem ser redobrados.

Distinguem-se das tra?as pelas antenas rectilneas que terminam numa bola, pelos hbitos de vida diurnos, pela metamorfose que decorre dentro de uma crislida rgida e pelo abdmen fino e alongado. Quando em repouso, as borboletas dobram as suas asas para cima.

39331a1596fd5dfeb1503344ae355dedaa	le cas typide est celui de la vanille :   (...)Le vanillier est cultiv de fa?ons trs diffrentes depuis des modes trs extensifs (type culture en sous-bois) jusqu' des modes trs intensifs (types culture hors-sol sous ombrage artificiel). En gnral, dans la plupart des pays producteurs, la culture du vanillier est ralise en mode semi-intensif sur tuteur vivant (on utilise gnralement pour cet usage le Pignons dInde, le Filao, le Vaquois, etc). Idalement, celui-ci doit avoir une croissance en phase avec celle du vanillier, fournir un ombrage suffisant pour protger la liane du soleil et galement de la matire organique au moment de la taille du tuteur. Une  deux lianes de vanille sont places par tuteur. Les densits de plantation sont extrmement variables, mais typiquement les pieds sont espacs de 1,50 x 1,50 m, ce qui donne 4 500  5 000 vanilliers/ha (fig. 2). La reproduction est ralise par bouturage.  Les premires floraisons ont gnralement lieu aprs trois  cinq annes de culture. Celles-ci ont lieu aprs un stress obtenu traditionnellement en supprimant temporairement l'ombrage (taille du tuteur) et/ou en coupant le bourgeon terminal de la liane. La floraison se droule de mars  mai au Mexique et de juillet  novembre  la Runion. Les fleurs ont une languette (rostellum) entre le stigmate et lanthre. On trouve environ 20 fleurs par pis, mais on ne conserve que 2  8 pis par plante avec chacun 6  10 fleurs.    La pollinisation s'effectue de manire naturelle en Amrique Centrale par labeille Mlipone mais cette pratique reste minoritaire. La pollinisation est gnralement ralise manuellement (selon une technique qui a rendu clbre un esclave de la Runion, Edmon Albius, qui l'avait mise au point en 1841; voir fig. 3) faute d'insecte pollinisateur suffisamment efficace. La priode de floraison dure deux  trois mois pendant lesquels les producteurs doivent quotidiennement polliniser les fleurs.|`|c6711fd14b6ec1de423962182f2e742daa	Cel permet d'obtenir de nouvelles varits de lgumes, fruits, fleurs.

So technically this guy was in the right.  He has every right to take his dog on a stroll in a public park where he can assume that other people will keep their dog leashed.    I had the same problem with my dog (who is dog aggressive).  I take him to the park to get him out of the neighborhood and do my best at keeping him away from other people's dogs but when they come charging up to him without a leash it is NOT my fault that my dog defends himself and me from what could be a possible attack in his eyes.      Sorry to be the devil's advocate here but you are in the wrong.|`|Ox2ojFCHaa	Considering it was a dog park, you have the right to let your dog loose. If the angry owner is struggling to handle their dog, it is not your fault. That owner should leave the dog park and find a place,like their backyard, to play with their aggressive dog. If the man owner refuses to control their own dog or take it away, call animal control or just avoid that particular dog park all together.|`|df1beb28ec457339664195de5a03682caa	If you teach your dog in the same language as you try to write it,then no wonder the poor animal is confused.|`|QCgvxwCzaa	There will always be irresponsible pet parents until we can educate everyone about the care and responsibility of having a dog! I would be more concerned about keeping my own dog safe and if I saw that person with his dog I would restrain my dog to keep him safe!     I work at a pet store. People come in all the time with dogs that they have on retrackable leashes and they do not pay attention to where their dog is going or who their dog is encountering. Then they get mad when their dog pounces around a corner and gets snapped at by a dog that is frightened by the dog coming out of nowhere! Use your own brain and protect your own dog!|`|AA10355591	Hello,  It's really an unfortunate situation, but if your dog approaches someone else - in a friendly manner or not, it is your fault.  Yes, he should have his dog muzzled but he did have the dog on a lead.    I don't necessarily agree with the law but it is the way it is.  If his dog bit your dog, sadly it would be seen as your fault for allowing the dog to approach his, however friendly it is.|`|jQglJiMhaa	This part is for the other people that didn't fully read you're post...    IT WAS A DOG PARK WHERE DOGS ARE MENT TO BE TAKEN THERE TO BE OFF LEASH AND SOCIALIZE!!!    Seriously, some people on here....    Anyway, you are not in the wrong, he shouldn't be bringing his dog to the DOG PARK if it is an agressive dog, on the other hand, make sure that when your dog is meeting new "friends" that you are near by to make sure that the introduction goes properly, which im sure you do that, as you seem to be a responcible dog owner.  This guy probably loves his dog too much to see that he is aggressive, and or, probably to lazy to teach his dog how to be a dog and properly socialize.    For the people who take their agressive dogs to the dog park, take them to a trainer first so that your dog to learn how to socialize properly, sitting in a corner of the park with your dog on a leash is not teaching your dog anything.  People should have to be required to go through classes before beling allowed to even own dogs.|`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	Yep this is your fault-- your dog was not on a leash in an area where it SHOULD have been on the leash.|`|5IcNNkkuaa	As an owner, going into a public place it is YOUR responsibility to leash your dog unless he is trained on verbal command. Considering your dog strays away from you, does not recall and approaches other dogs, I would say this is not the case.    If his dog is aggressive, and he is socializing, he is not in the wrong. He had his dog safety leashed.    You need to understand that not all dogs are friendly, not all dogs like every breed, and that you need to be responsible for your own dog. Unless this was in a FENCED dog park, you have no right to be mad.|`|W02kTOqmaa	Was it a dog park where dogs are LEGALLY allowed off leash? Then it is not completely your fault, but if you see that your dog approaching another dog is bothering the other dog, you should do the responsible thing and call your dog off. Running within three meters of a another dog and barking at it, even if it is just because your dog wants to greet it, is considered approaching the other dog.    We take my younger shepherd out to dog parks because he is very afraid of dogs, and we want him to overcome it. We sit in the farthest corner and keep him on leash and just let him watch the other dogs. But if too many approach him at once, he does get very aggressive, and he barks and growls and will snap at them. The thing that irritates me, is people just stand there and watch, but they dont get their dogs, or call their dogs off. I know my dog is bad with other dogs, that is why I am getting him out around other dogs, so he will overcome his fear.    This guy has to know his dog has a problem. But he is out with his dog on a leash, walking him, which is better then 90% of problem dog owners out there. It is your responsibility to control your dog. Your dog approached his dog. Even if your dog stopped three meters before hin, he still approached him, and still instigated him on, and you did nothing but insult the other dogs owner. Don't you think it's embarassing enough for the other guy having a dog that is rude in public, without you insulting him?    I hope by showing you my point of view with my aggressive dog, that you understand this guys side a little better. The best thing for an aggressive dog is to get it out around other dogs (with a leash on and keeping a safe distance) so the dog can learn. You need to be responsible, and instead of defending your dog to the max, realize when your dog is bothering other dogs, and call him away.    EDIT: Muzzles have been shown to infact make a dog even more aggressive. The restrictions to its mouth irritate the dog. I see a lot of you bashing on this man for not training and socializing his dog, yet how do you expect him to train and socialize it if he doesn't get it out around other dogs? You are going in circles with hypocritical insults. I'm not trying to be rude, but I think you need to admit that maybe your dog did antagonize the other dog. You said the other dog bit at your dog last week, but if the other dog was on leash, then your dog had to of gotten pretty close to it for it to bite at him. Not only that, but your dog was barking at his. You may say its no big deal because you have a little jack russel. But what if my 100lb shepherd ran up to your dog, stopped 3 meters away, and started barking at him. I'm gonna guess you would be pretty mad, and would tell me to control my dog.   Just be responsible, and if your dog approaches another dog and it bothers the other dog, call your dog away and go to another part of the park. I don't think you are accepting any responsibility here, and are being naive about your own dog. You need to accept that your dog did in fact approach this other dog, regardless of the other dogs behavior|`|JmD0oq2Naa	the guy was trying to control his dog, he obviously didnt want your dog to get hurt, which is why he asked you to put it on a lead.|`|Ou1ZnDtAaa	You are the sort of person that makes my life a living hell when i am walking my dog.   Your fault 100%|`|6SeWCfUfaa	That IS your fault.  Your dog should be on a leash and taught not to approach every dog it sees.  YOU are the irresponsible owner.|`|PdotFx4naa	Well, if you are in an actual fenced area and it is actually a dog park for off-leash dogs then he was in the wrong for bringing his dog there.  If he knew his dog had issues he should not have taken the dog there to begin with.  Now, if it's just a park and you have your dog off-leash then you are to blame.  Knowing that your dog had been snapped at before you should have been more cautious and kept him on a leash to prevent it from happening again.  There are always different scenarios so it just depends on what yours is.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	Actually unless its a certified off leash park, you were wrong. Just because certain parks have a high volume of off leashed dogs, doesn't make it legal. Doesn't matter how obedient you feel your dog is. Dogs are dogs and can act different at any given moment. That's why the leash is the law. If the person has the dog on the leash they are legally not at fault if their dog bites yours. You were doing something wrong if the city doesn't state that the park is off leash. Notice how off leash parks are fenced? For a reason. Doesn't matter how right you think you were, that owner was right in yelling at you. BTW extended leashes are great for when dogs are trained to take to the park. Gives them a bit of running room and you still have control over your dog.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	Wow instead of putting the other dog down why can't you just be a decent owner and leash yours?|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	sorry. your fault. you didn't have control of your dog. if his is leashed, he had control.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Every dog isn't friendly to other people or animals. If his dog was leashed and yours was not then it is your fault. Just because his dog might be a little aggressive doesn't mean he cant bring him to the park too. If his dog was off leash and ran over to your dog barking would you be upset? If your worried for your dogs safety you need to keep him on a leash too.|`|iOmi2JAtaa	sounds like the dog is stressed cos owner is stressed. not your fault dont let it bother you|`|aQCTR0Heaa	you should have you dog on a lead.    the other dog was on a lead    so you should put your dog on a lead

Each airline has its own rules about taking live fish with you on a flight. Some allow them to be carried on and others allow them to be checked as baggage. Call the airline and ask for their policy. If possible, print out a copy of the policy so you can show it to the agents at the airport-- they may not know all their airline's rules.

Another thing that people do is leave their plates unattended with bones from pork or chicken on them.  Also the dogs will go into the garbage after bones and fat trimmings which is bad.  We put our garbage can up on a little chair to keep our pom from knocking it over and my friend keeps her garbage under the sink with a baby lock on the door to keep her golden retriever out.  I guess just always be suspicious that your dog is going to try and steal food so watch where you leave cookies to cool and things like that.

Just when you see him playing ruff say no! and if he doesn't stop just don't let them play at all and he'll eventually get it.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Teach the pup to ignore your other dog.  At 18 years I'm sure your older dog has little interest in playing with a puppy.|`|Ox2ojFCHaa	Try letting your puppy interact with different dogs, not your older dog. Take your puppy to a dog park, the dogs there will be more up to playing.|`|7X0zAd9kaa	I would only let the puppy play with your older dog a little bit since it is good to have the interaction but just a little bit so the older dog can rest.

Good Luck!|`|K8t1lPXsaa	i have a rottie/shepherd, pit, husky and a yorkie. it was something similar where i had to teach the larger three dogs how to gently play with the yorkie.     your younger one must learn how to gently play with your senior dog. if the puppy is getting out of control then you need to step in and just say enough playing right now. settle them both down. don't make it a punishment though. any time the younger one gets rough you stop the playing.|`|Njm7RF4zaa	I had the same problem.

The puppy is not a child that can be trained by you to play one way with your older dog and not another, it doesn't know the difference.  It's a PUPPY!  When the older dog is upset, he will snap (not connect) or growl at the puppy and the pup will get the message loud and clear.  If you do not feel that the older dog is capable of protecting himself, let them play for a while and then remove the pup from the area of the other entirely.
2IA3Pdr8aa	well, i hvae had a betta fihs before. the thing is..that they only eat a couple pieces of food. and an intersesting fact is that if you feed them too much, they wont be as happy. the pet store has told me that a hungry fish is a happy fish..but that doesnt mean odnt feed it..if you have flakes..put 2 whole flakes in the water...if you have the little pebble thingies, give him 2 or 3.....betta fish, well, any fish dont eat alot. dont worry. and angelfish, as nice as they sound, are evil fish. they dont like having alot of fish around. the betta fish would probably kill the angelfish. butsometimes the other fish kills the betta fish. also, i believe that most angelfish are saltwater fish and betta fish are freshwater. and from my experience, it is very hard to keep up with a saltwater tank. if you have any questions email me @ barniebuddie96@yahoo.com ....good luck!|`|AraBfesHaa	Not all angelfish are saltwater fish, but I wouldn't put t hose two in the same tank.  But your betta probably isn't eating because you just got him and he's still stressing over being moved.  He'll start eating in a day or two once he calms down.|`|hFyodb4Daa	Well it is the other way aroung the angelfish will kill the betta since a bettas aren't really much aggressive also if you do plan to house and angelwih a betta your tank will have to be at least 50 gallons with lots of decor but be sure he is in a 5 gallon with filter and heater or he is sick if you do have this stuff here http://www.bettatalk.com/betta_diseases.... also fish especially betta won't eat for days when you first get them|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Betta's do best on frozen live foods like Blood Worms and Brine Shrimp. You can buy the packs at the pet store. If you are gonna feed him pellets just let him be for a week then start feeding him again. He should be hungry enough at that point to eat them. DON'T PUT AN ANGEL FISH IN WITH HIM.  They are 110% NOT Compatible. The Angelfish will bite his fins and will fight. Not to mention that Angels need at least a 20 gallon heated and filtered tank to be happy as they grow quite large.  Hes not lonely hes just not used to store bought pellet or flake food. Just give him time and above all a 10 gallon filtered heated tank. Good Luck|`|t85b6QMiaa	Considering you just got your Betta for a day, it is just a normal occurrence that he didn't take any food. Betta fish on one hand is not a gluttonous fish. They seldom eat more than they need. This came with exception however, if you fed them with live mosquito larvae. But it is not a good practice to overfeed your Betta.    Freshwater Angelfish on the other hand can grow larger than you initially buy it from the store. They may grow 25 cm in height. This means you'll need an aquarium with at least 50 cm in height. This also means that angelfish is not best kept with a Betta. As Betta is a labyrinth fish (fish that can inhale directly from the atmosphere like gourami) they don't do very well in deep water aquarium.    The characteristic of the two species also means that they may never live happily together. Betta prefer still water while angelfish need a "little" current so they can play "standing" among the plants.    If you're planning to keep a single species of angelfish in an aquarium, he/she may develop an aggressive, solitary attitude. This, with the addition of its size, make it a very dangerous Betta neighbor. Betta can be kept with other "gentle" species as long the don't have bright, provoking colouration and flaring fin like male guppy.|`|v4y0zBnLaa	I have had Betta fish before. One thing you don't want to do, is to put a male Betta fish in with any other fish, even other male betta. They ere very territorial, and will kill any and all other fish in the area. My best friend learned the hard way. They also love small enclosed tanks. But, if you want to see a betta's full potential, buy a special betta tank with the plastic barrier keeping them apart. There is a blue barrier, and a clear barrier. Take out the blue one, and the betta's will stare each other down, and flare their fins. It is really cool looking ad you actually get to see betas in action! there you are!  Ok. its very sad that your betta fist is sick. I think i can help. How much food are you feeding him? Betas can be very picky! Feed them too much, they wont eat. Feed them to little, they wont eat. Experiment with how much you feed him untill your betta finds an amount of food it prefers. But, i would do it soon, just in case. So, if its been happening alot, it wont die. There. you are welcome.   Also, if you got him yesterday, it might have been something that was already wrong with him. Maybe he was already dieing? You'll never know.   TIP: Wgen you buy a betta, look for ones, NOT by color, even thugh thats nice, nut buy how they are swimming. If they are on the bottom of the thing they are in, they might not be to healthy. Or if they are slanted slightly and not moving. If they are in the middle of the jar, or near the middle of the jar, it will proboally be happy and healthy. Another bad thing, dont get a depressed fish! There is really no way to tell if a fish is depressed fish. I know, its sad. But, if a fish is not eating, or not moving, even for food, but its still moving. Its sad, but it can happen. Well, you are welcome, and please tell me if yuor fist survives. I pray for him.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	feed your small amounts of food and I wouldn't put a betta and an angelfish together because the betta may rip up the fins      17 years experience with fish|`|yV8fog7Paa	NO ANGELFISH.   Angelfish need like 20gal or more anyway.    That betta BETTER be in a tank 5gal or better or send him back.     Bettas only eat around 3-4 pieces of floating betta food. Mine never liked that but loved the blood worms that I got him, he ate that every day.
179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	Well, I'm really not sure about indestructible, but I'm sure you know about Lupine?    If they chew through Lupine brand harnesses/collars/leashes, they have a lifetime warranty to be replaced for free.    Certainly makes it easier on your wallet.|`|rRwQzyrJaa	Take off the harness when he is in the house.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Get an adjustable collar.  The harness only encourages pulling which is bad behavior on a leash.|`|DIjL6Tuvaa	I think you might just have to fold and get him a collar- preferably one with enough notches in it that it has room to grow. Either that, or you'll just have to put up with taking her harness on and off, and storing it out of reach.     I say this because I use a harness in addition to a collar on my dog. She also has the charming habit of destroying harnesses (once when I forgot and left one on her when she wasn't on a walk, and twice when she just found the harness and destroyed it). I searched and searched for something she couldn't chew through and I never found anything. The only thing my husband was able to find was kevlar (aka bullet proof) and I don't even know where he found that. The only thing I could suggest if you really want to use a harness and don't want to take it off your puppy, is get one with a warranty so the company will replace it. For example, see the guarantee here: http://lupinepet.com/resources/FAQ.php|`|Re576Xa5aa	yry putting apple bitter on it. We had a puppy harness for my dog when he was a pup. My favorit harness is an x-back! (a sledding harness) I can't refer you to anything, but get an ajustable harness thats tight around that part that he chews  Harnesses are good 4 pups, they are developing airways. If all else fails put a piece of hose on the chest are that he chews|`|Chxoncy7aa	They really are not safe to leave on a puppy.  You should get one that is easy to put on, so your hourly walks will go quicker.  Then just take it off when you get back.
3BVDSwgNaa	I have 2 Rat Manors but personally like this one better:    http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...    The R.M. are easy to clean though, very sturdy and the 3 boys that live in it can have their own "space".  I rotate the 2nd one in when the 1st one needs to be cleaned.  It was a little tedious to put together but is solid once that's done. The only modification we made to both was to attach a chain to either side of the top door so that when opened, it's level and makes an even place for the ratties to stand. Kind of like a draw bridge. Works perfect.    The Super Pet Deluxe has a bigger footprint so it takes up more room but is totally spacious and the girls love it. I wish I had discovered this cage before the R.M.s.    You really don't have to cover the wire...it's actually nicely coated so no worry about bumblefoot.  I think it's galvanized wire that causes that problem.  I still lay folded newspapers on each level but only to add to the rattie's comfort level.   Sometimes I use the cardboard lids I cut off boxes they use as hides.|`|cGGvZqJNaa	I don't like rats. They crawl around like they own the place.|`|NMqHlGCaaa	i have this cage, i bought it in-store though.  it's good because it's so spacious-- rats always appreciate the extra room. it fits all 4 of my rats and their hammocks, etc. comfortably.  the only gripe i have with it is that it's somewhat poorly constructed. the ramps fall down a lot (the one on the bottom level i just took out completely), you have to remove the levels to clean them properly and they are pretty irritating to put back together.  still, it's hard to find a good-sized cage, so i recommend it if you have more than 2 rats.|`|b6400b04a0e3413ba30570ad0aa8cd2baa	I personally have this cage and it's great. I went and bought it though so i don't know how it's shipped. If it isn't coated then just put something down. I use fabric but i guess it's your choice

AA12322387	This is very common.  Get the poop up right away.  Vets also have something that your dog can eat that makes their poop taste really bad.  I have heard putting Tabasco Sauce on it works as well.  Me?  I would just make sure there was no poop around to eat.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	your dog is probably lacking in some sort of nutrient. Maybe switch his dog food to a better quality dog food    Here are some other quality choices for puppies:  * Merrick Puppy Plate, Turducken, Wilderness Blend  * Canidae all-life-stages  * Artemis Fresh Mix puppy  * Innova puppy  * Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lover's Soul    Heres a list of more great quality dog food:    Artemis  Natural Balance  California Natural  Evo  Innova  blue buffalo  Wellness  Merrick  Nature's Variety  Timberwolf  Pinnacle  Eagle Pack    These are great dog food choices. Most of these dog foods are not found at Petco or Petsmart, so your going to have to go to another pet store to find these. Although Blue Buffalo is sold at i think Petsmart, and that is pretty good dog food.    Also a good trick to keep the dog from eating its poop is to stick some pineapple juice in his food. When it comes out, your dog wont find his poop very appetizing    i would also suggest picking up the dog poop more often, so your dog doesnt go searching|`|EamhENYJaa	I saw this on animal planet. Dogs like to eat poop, that is normal. You have to catch them in the act and tell them to stop and then reward them when they don't do it.|`|6gmLk9jHaa	I have a yorkshire terrier and he sometimes eats him poop too. the dogs are probably hungry. because my dog did that when I couldn't buy dog food.|`|vnF9GipDaa	I have labs, too, they will eat ANYTHING!

Mixing some pineapple chunks in their food works on the poop-eater we have.|`|7c1NblyYaa	Umm..well, a lot of dogs eat their own poop as well as other dogs poop and cats also but maybe you should try feeding them something a little more healthier and make sure that they are getting enough food to. Good luck!|`|9fdyfwO4aa	some dogs like it.  My vet says it could be because the dog is insecure.  I just think she likes it.  We bought something that is supposed to make it taste bad it really didn't work so we don't let her "kiss" anyone or lick anything if we can and we try to pick up the poop before she gets to it
KEYgd73saa	Water changes are going to be the fastest fix.  A 50% water change isn't a problem at all so long as you're careful about keeping the temperature stable when you refill it.  The protein skimmer will help to keep nitrate levels down by preventing organics from decomposing to ammonia>nitrite>nitrate, but once the nitrate is in the form of nitrate, the skimmer can't do a thing.  Just keep up with your water changes and make sure to clean out your skimmer whenever it accumulates considerable froth.

When the wart began to ooze, I took my Dobermann for a second opinion & had the lump removed. Again I believed the vet again when she said it was categorically a harmless cyst and didn't need to be sent for analysis.    Three months later my Dobe developed a second lump & was diagnosed with aggressive skin cancer & was given approximately six weeks to live without treatment. The vet who had operated on him to remove the "cyst" hadn't removed all the mass which was in fact cancer.|`|nYv65TlEaa	I would of done the same thing,  mine comes out to greet mine before she see's them,she is awesome|`|PdotFx4naa	I switched vets because they underfed my dog while in their care and she died three days later.

I really liked this vet and she recommended our current vet, who is wonderful. Some of these posts make me realize how fortunate I am. My vet not only knows the name of the dog I take in, he always spends time asking about how my other dog is doing--and knows the dog's name.    I used a specialist for one of my dogs and I always felt she was abrupt and a little harsh. But, the day we had to let our girl go, she was in tears with us.|`|gx4s68s8aa	We switched vets because our dog was misdiagnosed.  She had a lump on her neck.  We had it biospied and the vet said it was just a block saliavary gland.  Six months later she woke up blind.  We took her to the ER vets and they said that she had advanced lymphoma.  And without immediate treatment she would lose her eyesight that day completely, and she would be dead in a few days.  We gave her the expensive eye treatment and gave her chemo.  We had her thankfully for two more years but it was very costly.    And we think had it been treated earlier she would have lived much longer.  We had another dog that lymphoma (they were related- and yes they were puppymill dogs- but that was when we didn't know what a puppymill was)  and he has been cancer free for almost four years after treatment.|`|vPde97E2aa	PRICE!

yTjKjDHxaa	Ok, "nightmare" is WAY off... they won't kill the pup if no one takes it. What a jerky thing to say! I have a German Shepherd and they are a lot to handle. Make sure you're up for the job because they are extremely active and need to be socialized TONS or else they'll be overprotective and can hurt someone. If I were you... being only 13 and this being your first dog and all... I'd opt for a smaller, more managable dog than a GSD. Just my opinion. Everyone in the family should agree that a dog is a good idea, otherwise the person who doesn't want it might not treat it right. You should ask your mom what you can do to get the dog. (like extra work around the place even though you do a lot already... just to show her how responsible you are.)|`|vJx7kcugaa	Find out why your mom is saying no.  If she doesn't have a reason then explain everything like you did in your question and I think you can convince her.  If she does have a reason then it would depend on that.  Once you find out, you will know why she is afraid to get a puppy and you guys can talk about it and hopefully work it out. |`|QAo3ndx9aa	It seems like you've got everything planned out except convincing your mom to let you have  a dog :) Have you tried telling her you'll do better in school ( that always works! )...but if you will have problems w/your grades, make sure that your mom already loves your puppy enough to let him stay :) hehe!

That you will pick up after it, be on poop patrol with a plastic bag and throw it away so the yards don't get too smelly, that includes neighbors when you go for a walk. If you plan on going to a obedience class, where and how much? Have you decided on the type of puppy food? Have you researched the breed? Know all the good and bad that could happen. Keep showing that you have a lot of the answers and see if your Mom has a specific reason she doesn't want a dog.Then you can work from there. Good Luck :)|`|aCqSF87Raa	Your whole post reeks of childishness. YOU think you're responsible just because you do dishes and help with laundry, YOU want the puppy but only want to pay for the supplies (what about initial vet care), YOU don't care that mom doesn't want the dog because SHE isn't home anyway... get the picture?    If dad is in your corner, have him talk to her. THEY are the providing adults so it is ultimately THEIR decision. What you do and what you can pay for doesn't matter if they don't want to pet. Period. I notice you didn't mention who was going to pay for the $100-$200 in monthly fees or pay for any emergency costs if they pop up.    Who cares if mom works most of the day? She's there at night and she has to deal with the dog then: Shepherds SHED buckets of hair so she may not want to come home to that, she may not want to deal with barking, messes, etc. Just for an FYI - dishes, dinner, and laundry help mean little. Plus what happens when you get the dog and no longer want to do those chores?    You're 13. Your parents are responsible for you. They pay the bills and support you and your sister. That's a couple grand a month - and they work hard for that money. If they don't want to add a dog to the mix, then that is their decision. Not yours.|`|uwpu0ZbIaa	tell her everything u told us about how u think ur more responsible and everything, and she might let u get it|`|iJtuhLMTaa	If your mom says no then the answer is no.

I can tottaly realate to your situation because my mom didnt want me to get a puppy when i was 12 and i begged and begged, but in the meantime while i was waiting for her to say yes i learned as much about dogs as i possibly could. She finally said yes and in the summer when i was 12 i got a yorkshire terrier puppy. He is very good and very well trained [ thanks to me ], but you really need to be prepared for the puppy. Puppies are alot more work then anyone expects! I think puppies are worse then babies, puppies are more like toddlers, into everything, always want attention, but they pee and poop all over if you dont research on how to train them! Also when you first get a puppy you really cant leave them home alone very long.. they get into everything!! I think you really should just wait it out and if your mom says yes dont just jump and run and get the first pup you see! You should really get the puppy over the summer, and while your waiting to get it do all the research you need! [ find out what breed you want study them , ect. ] By researching i think that should convince your mom that your ready. [ that convinced my mom ] Good luck! Hope this helps!

bikc9uCsaa	no?o os alimente de mais heim, deve ser pela temperatura que esta baixa, compre um aquecedor para o seu aquario, eu tenho aquario tbm e no inverno eles costumam morrer mesmo|`|eab0876af200660754a6a92216f3aeaaaa	Olha, comigo acontecia isso antigamente e eu n?o imaginava nem o que poderia ser, mas a v?o umas dicas que eu passei fazer e h qse 1 ano n?o morreu nenhum peixe sequer!!! Primeiramente, vc precisa d colocar no seu aqurio um filtro de gua, pois ele mantm a qualidade da gua, ou seja, esta n?o fica parada, ta sempre sendo renovada a todo momento; depois vc tem que colocar de vez em quando remdios que controlam a alta alcalinidade ou acidez da gua, afinal os peixes e juntamente a comida fazem a gua ficar extramente cida e/ou alcalina e estes casos s?o fatais para os peixes! Procure limpar (faxina geral) seu aqurio somente uma vez no ms, e uma vez por semana troque 25% da gua. E pra terminar procure sempre alimentar os peixes com a aquela comida em gr?os pois ela mantm o equilbrio da gua e procure sempre colocar peixes que todos vivam na mesma condi??o!    Se vc tem dvidas em rela??o a pre?os (pode variar por regi?o) eu paguei pelo filtro mecanico R$ 40,00, os remdios que controlam a alcalinidade e a acidez cada um custa por volta de 3,50.    Com certeza se vc fizer isso, duvido que seus peixinhos morrer?o...d um pokinho de trabalho mas vale a pena. BOA SORTE!|`|c62PjDZPaa	estou achando q vc est dando muita comida pra eles!  procure dar s o necessrio!|`|1R5Uo86eaa	Tem a quest?o da gua, que o colega a em cima falou, e as vezes pode ser por causa da comida (baixa qualidade e/ou muita quantidade). Fica difcil se falar algo com mais certeza.

Outra coisa  n?o introduzir peixe novo logo de uma vez na gua:voc precisa adapt-lo dentro de um plstico com a gua que ele veio pelo menos quinze minutos antes de coloc-lo no aqurio.       Depois, voc o coloca dentro com um pouco da gua que ele veio junto.       Ah!  Comida s n?o adianta.  Voc precisa dar apenas uma vez por dia.  Polvilhe a ra??o na gua e  s.       Espero ter ajudado.|`|b13e724b23399463e63d305c1f1aa8e2aa	Com certeza eles est?o cansados de nadar neste espa?o t?o pequeno muda eles para um  aquario de tamanho maior eles ir?o ficar feliz da vida|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	Voc precisa renovar o oxignio da gua deles.   Coloque um sistema de inje??o de oxignio ou ent?o renove a gua deles toda hora. Mas n?o utilize gua da torneira, pois esta contm cloro.
IrdZKYT3aa	Gradually, you'll have to be patient and work with them.  They probably didn't get a lot of handling in the store and don't know what this huge thing wants with them.  I usually suggest just being near them throughout the day, talk to them, pet them, but don't try and grab them.  When they are more comfortable and allow you to pet them, begin trying to handle them more.  Encourage them to walk on your hand and come to you, offer a treat perhaps.  I know the mice in the store I work at luv shredded carrots, try offering them these, but encourage them to come to you to get it.  Best of Luck!|`|AyOM41obaa	Never buy from petsmart again just look at this website it is sad and cruel on how petsmart gets their animals so ur mice r probably just sick or something.go on this site and find out how their treated and plz help.      http://www.petsmartcruelty.com/|`|3zwDWO3faa	mice can be very friendly pets if you treat them right.

They are organs used to feed nursing young via transporting lactated milk to the mouths of hungry babies!|`|yoaWcfGvaa	Just like chickens don't have nipples because they lay eggs, then when the chicks hatch, they are able to eat on their own, fish don't have nipples because they lay eggs or give birth to babies who are able to care for themselves right away.  Most fish never even see their parents, unlike the movie Finding Nemo.  Some fish do build nests and some even care for their young, but none ever feed thier young with milk, fish don't need milk ever, so nipples would serve no purpose whatsoever.  By the way, the Platypus and Short-Beaked Echinea both lay eggs, but still feed their young with milk because they are mammals!|`|F15EPx0Taa	No they do not have nipples. Fish do not produce milk, and are not mammals they are invertebrates witch means they do not have a backbone.    Fish give birth to babies that can take care of them selfs just like snakes and lizards.   Here is a good example Sea turtles! The mama sea turtle comes up on the beach and digs a hole, lays her eggs, and leaves. The babies hatch and have to defend them selfs. Fish are the same way. Hope I was of some help.
bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Spaying means 'neutering' a female rabbit.  Neutering can be used when you are talking about male rabbits (i.e. making them 'neuter' by giving them 'vasectomies' or removing their testicles.   Nurturing means 'nursing' ... taking care of a rabbit or any other animal (even a human).  I'm not sure whether you accidentally misspelled neutering to 'nurturing' or meant to ask the difference between 'spaying' and nurturing, so I included the definitions of all three.  I hope this helps you in the way you wanted.|`|xLr8ItC1aa	I'd imagine it's the same difference as with any other animals:    Spaying is the removal of female reproductive organs (which are internal).

Neutering is the term used to explain the removal of reproductive organs in general, regardless of whether male or female.

If so this is very odd behavior, as yes, they are very active fish.  Try isolating the bully in a baby nest or box or a divider for a while, allowing the others to move about.  This may help them establish a territory.  If they don't move they may be sick, monitor for signs.  With the ripped fins, also watch for fin rot as this can set in to open wounds.

But, 99% of lumps that mice get are mammary tumors. Normally they can be removed, but it is a very risky procedure, because they are such small animals and can react badly to an anaesthetic. I don't think she needs to be separated. Hope this help. Good luck|`|YqVtOSWwaa	Any type of tumor can be cancerous or benign. mammary tumors are not necessarily benign either, they simply grow from a certain part of body, the mammary gland. There is no way of telling what a tumor is just by looking or feeling it. The best way to determine for certain is by doing a biopsy. A vet will take a sample, and run it through tests. If the tumor is found to be cancerous, the best thing to do is remove it.     The biopsy itself is mild surgery, and is stressful and risky to such a small animal. A mouse may die from the anesthetics alone. On top of that, it is often very costly. My vet quoted me a few hundred dollars to remove a tumor on a rat. The most important thing for you to do is call your vet, and ask them about what sort of procedures they would do, and deicide based on what they tell you.    Personally, I would leave the mosue alone. If she is moving around fine with the tumor, she would probably be okay for a while longer. Usually, the cancer does spread, and cause the animal to act sluggish and sickly. At this point, if you decide not to do the surgery, it would be best to euthanize her, so she doesn't suffer any more. It might seem upsetting, but as long as she is happy, you should be happy for her. Once her quality of life resides, it's kinder to put her down painlessly.    Certianly do not separate her! Her tumor will not in any way affect anyone else. By separating her, you will onyl stress her out needlessly. Right now, it is very important to keep her comfortable. Stress can make any illness worse, and chances of recovery slim.

Hamsters have little lungs and the phenols in pine and cedar are damaging to them. There have even been studies of HUMANS who work around cedar having lung problems.     I very strongly recommend tossing that bedding and getting something else. Aspen bedding is the only wood bedding I would give the OK.|`|xyPpruSjaa	Thank you Lady K, but we are talking about pine and cedar. Besides, aspen isn't even bad xD    Like another poster said, if you buy cedar or pine it isn't going to be like "YOU BOUGHT IT! Guarenteed hamster health problems for you!" Although there is a very high chance that your hamster could develop lung, liver, and respiratory problems. Their lungs are so tiny, and the phenols and toxins in cedar and pine are very strong.     If you must, use up the package, but don't buy it again.     Make sure that the Soft-Sorbent you are using is the NON-SCENTED kind. The scented kind can hurt your hamster.

Existe um leite apropriado para filhotes e vc poder encontrar em pet shop ou clnicas veterinrias.     Os filhotes, muitas vezes, tem dificuldades para mamar em mamadeiras ou chuquinha. Se for o caso, vc poder dar o leite com um conta-gotas ou seringa, aquelas utilizadas para se dar remdio para os c?es. Sendo atravs de uma seringa, d pequenas quantidades, pois eles poder?o se afogar.     Consulte um veterinrio de qual  o tempo entre uma e outra mamada e a quantidade a ser dada. Esteja preparada para cuidar dos filhotes, dia e noite, pois nos primeiros dias de vida, isto  necessrio. Um filhote requer os mesmos cuidados de um beb recm-nascido.    Procurre mant-los juntos, numa caixa forrada com uma manta de l? leve e, se necessrio, ligue uma lampada, tendo o cuidado de n?o deixar muito prxima para evitar qualquer perigo de queimadura.

A pobresinha deve ter morrido de alguma infeccao. Vai ver um (ou mais) cachorrinho ficou no ventre.     Por favor, castre esses ai, quando tiverem idade de castrar.    Por agora, compre leite para filhote-de-cao, nas Petshops.    Va no veterinario e pergunte, nem precisa pagar consulta. Eles nao devem estar doentes. So pergunta sobre a frequencia da alimentacao. Eles devem precisar, cada 3 horas.   O veterinario nao deve cobrar, para lhe informar frequencia e tipo de leite.  Nao leve os cachorrinhos, senao, vao cobrar.    Por favor, compre esse leite, imediatamente!  Leite para cachorrinho-recem-nascido. URGENTE!!!    Eles precisam desse leite, de 3 em 3 horas, ou vao morrer.  ESQUECI!  ELES PRECISAM DE MAMADEIRA E BICO.  Mais de 1 bico, pois as vezes mordem o bico e rasga.     O furo do bico nao pode ser nem muito pequeno, nem muito grande. Muito pequeno, o leite nao passa e muito grande, o cachorrinho se afoga. Nao esqueca esse detalhe!    Eles vao se salvar, amiga.    Mas va urgentemente, conseguir leite, mamadeira e dois ou 3 bicos (porque, mordendo, aos poucos se rasga).     Nao esqueca o tamanho do furo do bico: Deve ter a espessura de uma cabeca de prego-grande.

QUimtHhBaa	I think whenever you name a pet, you should take a few things into consideration.  1. Looks.     - I had a white and black dog we named Domino     - I had a big white cat we named Mo (short for Mobydick)     - My aunt had a furry animal called Fluffy     - And an ex-girl had a furry one called Peluzo (which basically        means fluffy in spanish)  2   Personality     -  A friend of mine had a dog that just seemed to "not get it", and         they called him goofy, or you could call it Dopey     -  Also I have a late friend who called his beagle, Beagle  3   Girlfriend/boyfriend or married     - I bought a dog for my girlfriend and the word geronimo was a         metaphor for love in a movie, and so we named it Geronimo.    What ever you do, take a look at all considerations.  size, color, looks, personality, and anything else you come up with to think about. From what I imagine when I read you description here are my picks.  Tergle - (terrier/beagle)  Stumpy - Its what I imagine  Pizazz - I could just see her excitement in life  Droopy - maybe in the eyes    I hope this helps|`|dZ3B2vNIaa	Delilah  Missy  Sarah  Cindy  Alaska  Georgia  Texas  Cutie pie  Coco nut  Jessie  Arlene  Liz  Emily  Jane  Katie  Audrey|`|wXdrDOAmaa	What about going to a baby name web site and finding one there?    or go to  http://petrix.com/dognames/a.html    and seach for names there by letter    good luck|`|CiczhPboaa	My Aunt has one named bunny  maybe.......  coa coa  barney  mindi  bindi  twix  peanut  tolouse  carla  brandi  sammy  paula  scooby  linda  lilly  |`|8epwNobVaa	well it all depends on the way your dog acts like my dog was alwaysspoiledd so i named her princess if she likes bones call he bone or if shedoesn'tt like storms call her stormy it all depends on thepersonalityy i hope that helped u out good luck.. terrier/beagle mixes r wonderful dogs  Good Luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|qGlIiVJEaa	Polly...Poppy...Cinnamon...Hershey..

AHY3UUIiaa	You have to wait 7 days after you've put the water treatment and done a test which yours if fine.   I would still wait the full week just to make sure everythings okay. I know it's very exciting but it be worth the wait hehe.    AJ.X|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Your water test has "passed with flying colours" because nothing organic has been added to it. As soon as you added fish to this tank the water would start to go bad in hours.    You need to trigger the nitrogen cycle, it doesn't happen on it's own. Read through this:  http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/The_Nitro...  http://www.fishforums.net/index.php?show...  This process will take anything from 2-6 weeks to establish before it's truly ready for fish.|`|SZOMVGBRaa	No and the reason is Because your water is fine funny as that sounds.    You tank needs to cycle, this can only be started by adding a source of Ammonia like fish or food or even pure ammonia out of the bottle. The cycling process takes about 3 weeks. The Ammonia will shoot up to 8 and then drop to 0 then the Nitrite will shoot up to 8 and then drop to 0 Then Nitrates will show up and Ammonia and Nitrite will be at 0. Then and only then is your tank cycled.  Just do a 80 % water change and add fish.     Now there's two ways to cycle a tank, either ad a couple small hardy fish and that will start it off. Make sure they are cheap though Cu's most likely they won't live. You can't change the water during this time or your shooting yourself in the foot. The levels will become deadly and they will die.     The second way is to just add a bit of pure ammonia into the tank every day and just keep testing evey other day until your Ammonia and Nitrite are at 0 and you have Nitrates in the 10 -20 ppm range.     Either way you do it don't go out and add a bunch of fish when its done. After your tank is cycled only add 3 fish a week until you reach your final number.     Good Luck. Any other questions feel free to E-mail me.|`|Qhdozm54aa	As Catx has said, the reason you have undetectable levels of ammonia and nitrite is because you haven't added any organic material for the filter bacteria to break down and use to multiply their numbers. If you added fish now you will have problems with ammonia and nitrite spikes, which can kill even hardy fish. Before you can add fish to an aquarium you need to cycle it, this process can take several weeks.|`|FJHU9PbUaa	Add a piece of shrimp to the tank & let it sit for a good week, this is like adding cycling fish, but kinder. The tank is not cycled yet & won't be for a few weeks. Ask the pet store for some used filter pads to speed it up.|`|5DVg6VTvaa	put some small fish in first like neon's and see how they go and if every thing is ok start adding.|`|Ayc9vLIgaa	Another helpful hint....You Dont Have To Capitalize Every Word In Your QUESTION.
ZxZsVUiFaa	Hamsters were first discovered in 1839 in the Syrian desert in the Middle East. They were thought to be extinct, but in 1930 a scientist in Syria found a nest with a female and 11 babies. Four hamsters lived and the first hamsters were brought to England in 1931 and to the United States in 1938. It was discovered that they made good pets and by 1950 there were 100,000 golden hamsters in the United States.  Hamsters were living in relative obscurity until just 70 years ago, when a zoologist discovered a family of these rodents in the Syrian desert. Today, hamsters' friendly nature and adaptability have placed them among America's most popular small pets.|`|xtRm5NV5aa	The word "hamster" originates from Russian or Lithuanian, the Russian "chomiak" and Lithuanian "staras," which then went into Slavic languages as "chomestoru" and then the Germanic "hamastra." The former English word for hamster was "German rat."  Hamsters themselves may have originated from North Africa, but currently only reside in Eurasia.

QLopvWKDaa	I am picking up my second rescue puppy on Saturday.  Both are full Yorkshire Terriers!    I found them on Petfinder.com    this is an awesome site not only to find a puppy in your area, but research breeds and learn about the adopting rescues from puppy mills and shelters!  Enjoy!|`|csDhZDvraa	No reputable breeder sells puppies on the internet. If you adopt one from the internet alone  you will b supporting a puppymill.    Visit breeders in person. Or adopt a rescue dog.|`|GvgmSxdCaa	The Pet-store ...     Don't buy offline.|`|zL1sggpCaa	Forget that...    Head to your local shelter and adopt a dog... SAVE A LIFE. :-)|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Petfinder.com|`|ee74f3aa67efefa8e49e21be6f4ec61faa	The only place I would consider is Petfinder.com.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Petfinder.com - adopt one, or try a breed rescue for whatever kind of pup you are interested in.    NO reputable breeder would ever advertise on the web, just isn't going to happen - all those cute websites are fronts for puppy mills.    Decent breeders, who are in the minority, believe me - have homes lined up for the few puppies they breed with their tested, shown, very good dogs.       If you must have a brand new puppy and can't find one at a breed rescue or Petfinder (or your local shelters, they often get puppies, that would be the first place I would look), go to some local dog shows and talk to people who are showing good quality dogs.   Even champions often throw off pet quality dogs that need good homes.   Nothing at all wrong with those dogs, they just may be a bit less than perfect, or not show well - but they make great pets.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	Yup, petfinder.org    the ONLY reputable place online :)|`|7IVrBiT1aa	Shelter!!!!  Or www.petfinder.com|`|QCgvxwCzaa	Either go to a reputable breeder directly or adopt one of the millions of dogs/puppies in shelters and adoption programs.|`|ti8L5zryaa	I would not trust any "breeder" who sells on the internet.  You can find reputable kennel on their websites, but I don't believe they would just sell to anybody over the internet.  I would go to petfinder or breed rescue sites, or find a breeder in your area.  Go to the American Kennel Club website and look for one.  DO NOT BUY FROM A PETSTORE AND THEREFORE SUPPORT PUPPYMILLS! Also do not buy from backyard breeders that you might see in your newspaper ads.   They are just in it for the money and are as bad as puppy mills!|`|PdotFx4naa	Depends on the breed and if you are looking for a show dog or just a pet.  Pets, go to petfinder.com or your local shelters.  Show dogs, go to the AKC website or UKC website and look up breeders on their breeders listing page.  Even then a lot of those people are not reputable but it's a chance you're going to have to take to get a purebred.  Also, look for someone who shows their dogs.  Don't assume that they are good breeders when they say their dogs come form CHAMPION BLOODLINES.  That means nothing.  Just because they have champions in their bloodline doesn't mean they have champion dogs.|`|D2sMKkchaa	You  can never trust the internet,so just forget about that idea why not go to a shelter and adopt one you fall in love with please that way you save a life.|`|zWuDNyfHaa	Have you tried a shelter?  SEAACA would be a great place to look.  That's where I got my Manchester Terrier a year ago in March and she is STILL fantastic.  Rescue pets are the best!|`|VXgby6cZaa	adopt one|`|X3bu0B8faa	Go to the AKC or UKC website and look up breeders or puppies for sale. Don't go to a miller, Please!
UbSJPBuNaa	no there is no way this will work
bEQn0Vrtaa	This is a prime example of what i get very upset about. There are breeders who have one set of beliefs and they fill this site up with false information. Yes Guinea pigs can be very happy alone because they bond to their human companions. They of course need a lot of time and love which you clearly were giving him. Once you put other guinea pigs in the cage he has bonded with them and you are now second fiddle to him. Be ready for a completely different relationship now, you will have to settle for watching him and his cage mates together. have play time together. The one on one special cuddle time is over as he is cuddling with them. Is he any more happy no, just different.As companion pets nothing is better than a guinea pig as they are so loving, playful, full so full of personality, they are just the best.    Good luck, i hope every thing goes well.|`|YFTZM86maa	This may change after time. Maybe he is bonding with his new friends and doesn't want to be without them.  Maybe you can place him in a smaller cage or on a blanket etc near his friends and get him used to the idea of being away from them for a while, and then moving him away little by little.  I'm not sure if trying to put up with his protests until he stops is worth it, but it's a possibility.  Once he remembers how much fun it is to play with you, he may get back to his old self.  good luck|`|HI6fx8nYaa	of course he still likes you but sounds like hes terified introduce his new friends slowly he will calm down aftr a few weeks|`|9waLV4Miaa	try to set up an enclousure in your house for when you want to get them out. try gradually picking him up on your lap when the others are still near or even picking them up and making him see its okay. try and treat them all with some carrots and try to include all the guinea pigs as one big one. Also play with them for as long as you can daily and gradually have him alone for little bit longer every day
bIaywrBCaa	take him to another vet. Something is wrong. How old is he? Could be hypoglycemia)low blood sugar). Could be mild epileptic seizures. Chihuahuas can also have hydrocephalus which causes seizures. Please take him to a vet ASAP!     Let us know how he is. The only way to edit is the way you did it. You cannot reply to your own question. Good luck with the little guy.|`|Ei85kgfdaa	If its a 20 he needs to be back at the emergency vet. Sudden loss of appetite and legarthy are a big red flag. How old is this dog?|`|GSf09ALBaa	One of my employees had a very similar problem with her 5 year old 4 pound Chi.  Since we allow dogs and children to come to our place of work, we often have several of both moving about.      Lars, her Chi (who is the mascot for our company) fell off the couch.  His brain swelled.  He was in intensive care for 2 weeks.  It took a MRI  to figure out the problem.      Get to a specialist as soon as you can.  This is most likely more than a vet can handle.|`|RLvIDudYaa	This sounds like a serious neurological issue; if you have a vet hospital nearby or access to a vet neurologist, that's where I'd take the poor dog.  Hope he can get proper care!!
yhgRaBPXaa	do not feed them tomatoes either!|`|Oie90iwqaa	Yes they can eat fruits like bananas, carrots, apples, oranges etc......but only in moderation. Please don't feed these fruits every day. DO NOT FEED ANY GRAPES.
AA10421992	Rotties life span is only 8-10 years old so you are correct at saying your dog is getting old.  Just like humans, some dogs do loose control of their bowels when they get older.  I have a senior Husky that will actually poop when she walks and it is due to her age,  To be sure just have your dog get a check up with your vet.        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rottweiler    GOOD LUCK.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	He is still young yet to be having old age related problems, but it could be old age. Keep him crated or kenneled so that he does not ruin your house. Make sure he is OK by the vet before deciding anything else. Is his memory still good? Could he has been poisoned?|`|GSf09ALBaa	Yes, that is a very good assumption.  He should see your vet and take a stool sample with you.|`|wXh4QpaYaa	He's not that old, and I would definately take him to the vet. Loss of bowel control is not a good thing.|`|rVv5TC4Uaa	If his behavior has changed dramatically then it might be time to give the vet a call.|`|2fb47d9f780ad38758b903b84af1726eaa	the life span of rottie is 10-13 years on average. so that said it could be older age. i do know dogs have harder times holding themselves when they get older. i would call a vet to see, 8 is getting older but is still kind of young to be showing old dog signs.
ZT0K3q2Aaa	No, i dont think that is something that should be allowed. Any type of mouthy behavior, should be corrected, thats more of a sign of dominance than a sign of submission. If a dog has respect for you, it wouldnt mouth you|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	Yes, it's quite common. Retrievers are mouthy by nature, and some just have to have something in their mouths when excited.  My friend has a huge male Labrador who feels he simply must "hold your hand" and retrieve you into the house when you come to visit.  He is very gentle and is obviously happy to see you, not aggressive.    If you dislike this behavior, you can teach him to never have any part of human anatomy in his mouth, ever.  When he's excited in play or greeting, give him something else to mouth on, like a tennis ball, and praise him up BIG when he does!|`|3VJvfjbIaa	i belive the dog likes u!!    My German Shepherd tells us he likes us by when your a sleep he taps his head against your arm to wake u up to see if your alive, maybe maybe not!|`|4b8fb7d13eab5f34e3a4f0ce4fbb2680aa	It's not just a Golden trait, lots of big breeds do it. My Akita (and lots of others) would do that when I came through the front gate & stay with me until I was indoors.  As long as she's gentle it's nothing to worry about and certainly not dominance.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	one of my retrievers did that to me, but she didnt mean to.|`|J9AvKefwaa	No to both, its not normal and its not a display of affection.|`|4ZGRgUd2aa	It is a sign of dominance.|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	I'd be weary of a dog doing that to me.|`|UeaZY4BTaa	Yes, it is normal, but if you would rather she didn't, it is quite fixable. It is a sign of affection, however, if she starts playing too hard, she should be firmly told to stop.  It's not just goldens, many larger breed dogs do it, though I've never seen smaller dogs do something similar.|`|o1KWtGzLaa	Yes it's dominance, many dogs do this. I suggest you gently but firmly push them to lay down including ttheirhead and in a hushed but in control tone say 'No' and after a ew seconds after they calm down let them go, keep doing it whenever and only when they're out of control to prove you're dominant without acting like too much of a threat they'll panic and react to it.|`|H3J6bN0Yaa	Retrievers like to put things in their mouth and unless there are any other problems with her, I wouldn't listen to people's comments about 'Dominance' - load of rubbish!!!   They naturally like to carry and hold things. She might be trying to instigate a game this way. Provide her with things to carry around, like a soft toy. Don't encourage her to put teeth on skin by giving her attention for it.|`|nc4SbvfRaa	Goldens are usually easy going and try to do anything to please the person near them. Mine will let me know if he wants to go out by getting his leash or bringing a tennis ball. Mouthing like that could be a dominace issue,,, but Goldens rarely try to be dominant with people. The only ones I have seen with dominacne issues related to their people were from poor breedings, little training, and poor socialization. I suggest a light muzzle-tap and firm "No". If the problem continues check with a local trainer.|`|d857a9e7089a4eae34802fd48931e712aa	It depends on how old the retriever is. Although mouthing should not be encouraged, Goldens often use it as a way to communicate. He/she might want to play, need some attention, or may need to go potty. My golden was mouthy for about 8-9 months, and doesn't do that anymore now that he's a little older.    Pay attention to when your retriever mouths and what it signifies. If it is done in play or when you are disturbing it, then it should be discouraged. However, if it is a gentle mouthing, and you notice that it usually is to communicate (some goldens will even lead you by your hand to something that they think needs your attention), then don't necessarily encourage it, but you don't have to be too worried about it either.|`|ti8L5zryaa	Yes, retrievers can be "mouthy", but do not let her do this.  Ask any trainer or animal behaviorist and they will tell you the same.|`|DgTES11eaa	My golden/pitbull does this as well.  I never allow it unless we're playing.  He has since learned that this behavior is only allowed when we are playing.  Since we started tightening up the rules he actually rarely does it at all anymore.|`|5bf74849a6fa0cd4e0f36c5182418406aa	You are right, it is the Golden Retriever's trait.  All "retrieving" dogs have a tendancy to do this, it is in their breeding.  It is a result of generations of training and breeding to be huting dogs, where they bring things back to you as a sign of you being their master.  I grew up with a yellow lab who did this everytime we walked in the door, every trainer and vet said it was perfectly normal.
D1beU6MPaa	Cockers are prone to skin infections and ear infections. Ask your vet to test her for allergies. I had a Cocker that had the same symptoms as yours. The vet tested her and sure enough, she had allergies. I had to give her shots for it.  In the meantime, make some white rice, minute rice is fine. Boil some chicken and shred it up. Mix the chicken with the rice and feed her only this. Nothing else for flavor. This will not be a forever cure, but it should help with the skin problem until you can get her tested. Your vet may want to put her on a special food if it turns out that she has allergies. Good luck  Source(s):  Lifelong dog owner and breeder  Horse owner and breeder|`|QVP8zSuWaa	It sounds more like some type of allergy and until you find out what type it is going to be hard to treat.  It could very easily be a food allergy.    For the dog suffering--a good metallic oil shampoo helps relieve the itching and soothes the skin burning. Add some omega 3 to her diet to help also.     Treat your yard. Fleas love tall grass, weeds, etc. keep her in areas that are cleared of these things. Putting lime out also helps.     Always use Frontline Plus when the dog is dry and keep them dry 2 days before and 2 after.    Try to avoid steroids, its a quick fix for vets but not a long time cure.|`|UyAGXNCsaa	Frontline works, but for ticks you must reapply it monthly.  Remember that fleas are attracted to unhealthy skin, so if your dog is prone to hot spots, the fleas are in heaven.  There are oils and things you can buy to put in your dogs food to help with skin problems.  Vitamin E works well.  Are you feeding your dog healthy food?  Try Avoderm - it has avocado oils in it and is good for skin-problematic dogs.  It could be that she has an allergy to the food you're feeding her.  Get some better advise from your vet on different foods and supplements that may help - topical lotions and oatmeal baths help but are temporary.  You need to fix the problem systemically (through the digestive system).|`|KxjUim7yaa	Try going grain free. Her hot spots might be grain related. My Dachshund got over his allergic skin reaction on a grain free food. I recommend Solid Gold Barking at the Moon. There are other grain free foods that are good too. Check them out at dogfoodanalysis.|`|nc4SbvfRaa	You ned to identify the cause of the hot spots. Your vet should be testing and not just treating the symptoms. It may be skin, diets, fleas, ticks, allergy, auto-immune deficieny, or something chemical in her environment. Find the source and change the circumstances... but get her relief. Change vets if necessary... consider checking with a college, like K-State that has a vet program on it's campus. They have a lot of resources and experince.|`|RZKygoPzaa	Is your dog being treated for lymes disease?  Has she been tested for lymes?  Very important.  You will have to keep her controlled more to resovle the tick issue.  Ther are collars that give off a light shot of electricity and when she does something or goes into the underbrush.  That's wher ticks lmake nests for the most part. You give the dog a light charge of electricity and say in a loud voice,OFF.  After a while, she will just need you to say 'Off" and not need the collar at all.  You have to train her to stay out of tick infested areas.  It is not easy, I know, and this seems drastic but it does work.  A dog dying from kidney failure due tolymes disease is very sad.  It could be fatel in a 3 month time period  and that is why I have used this with my bullmastiff.  She is a triple alpha personality, strong willed but very sweet. I wnat her to be here for many, many years.  We have to protect our pet, they are like children and do not preceive the consequences of their actions.  They do not know there are consequences.  There are trainers who use this collar and you and your dog will have to go together for training sessions.  It si worth the money and effort.      For hot spots its sounds like she needs something added to her diet.  At pet stores or at your groomers there is a product called, 'LinatonePLUS.'  Its a skin and coat revitalizer and lubricates the dogs skin and coat from within.  If you like it, your groomer can buy the gallon size jug for you at a cheaper price.  You add it daily to your dog's food.  The amount you add depends on the weight of your dog.  The first week I would suggest  cut the dose to 1/3 of the amount as the dog has to adjust to it.  With anythng new in a dogs diet, there is an adjustment period and you do want your dog to get diarrhea the first week.  I hope that helps you and, Good Luck with your little girl!
mXEOcSeuaa	That's fine.  Rabbits are sexually active creatures and are hard wired to reproduce.  Just because they can't doesn't mean they won't try.  Be careful because male rabbits can still make babies for up to two weeks after being neutered, but if your female is spayed, it should be fine.|`|5Q5SNH1daa	you posted the same question abit ago and said you were putting them together for 15 minutes? if so put them together for longer, (thats if they are both neutured and spayed) they will get used to eachother more and the male will eventually get tired lol just give it a go see what happens when he gets tired he should just snuggle down with her.|`|DneIgg9qaa	as long as thier fixed . you really dont need to worry about it
2CbfO4jWaa	they do not brumate (in the traditional winter cooling sense) but may "hunker down" in times of low food supply. since waters have a much slower metabolism them other monitors and really are opportunistic feeders (they will eat ANYTHING thats alive or once was) there really is no physical reason or cause for brumation in the wild or captivity but again they will go into "conservation" mode in BAD times. also your basking temps are too low. 130F+ minimum. id use around 140F-145F personally .your bulb is too big, use 45 watt halogen floods. and ditch the day/ night cycle, go 24/7 light and heat and make sure he has plenty of hiding areas  and a DEEP, GOOD substrate to get escape to the dark when he wants. also your tank is going to be small fast. start building his adult enclosure NOW.
VCuSR7wbaa	LEGO parts are non-toxic. You don't need anything to protect your fish from the LEGO pieces. Your biggest problem will be keeping them underwater. LEGO parts have lots of trapped air between them and mostly tend to float. You may need to glue some parts together and place rocks on them, so that's where you'll need a safe glue from an aquarium store.    Choose an "Aquarium safe Silicone Adhesive." Most products will be labeled toxic or non-toxic. BE SURE YOU DO NOT GET ANYTHING THAT IS "Anti-Mildew" because that stuff is toxic to fish.    Possible brands and products that are fish safe are: West Systems Epoxy, Everfix Epoxy Resin, GE Silicone 1 (NOT 2), All-Glass 100% Silicone Sealant, Selleys Glass Silicone.     Pet stores and places like Wal-Mart that also sell aquariums will have safe products. Home Depot and DIY stores may have many choices but most will be toxic.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Lego is non-toxic plastic, made from the same stuff as your filters etc, so it is safe to put in a tank as it is. Just wash the bricks before you put them together to make sure they aren't contaminated with something    Ian|`|CCqqTw6paa	use and type of glue that you have handy  after that leave it in a bucket of plain cold water for a few days  should be fine for use after that|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	You could use a fish tank friendly silicone like the kind they use on glass tanks.  Check with a fish store.
AA10948829	Press in the middle of your chest.  Feel that hard spot? That's your sternum.  All animals have one.|`|DlvVvckcaa	Yes.  All mammals have ribs.
2YIxnXXyaa	I imagine if you're just catching it, doing research on it, then putting it back that it would be totally okay to do so.  I would try to find a number to your local game and fish store and call them and ask if it's okay.  If you're not doing any harm, then it should be great.        If you're using a rope, make sure it doesn't get wrapped around it's neck.  It can suffocate or rip it's neck by doing its "death roll" to try to escape you.      And I'm sure you realize the dangers that this is.  So make sure you have someone with you at all times.    ..And be sure to watch Crocodile Hunter!!!|`|90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	Probably not legal without permission from the state. Contact the Fish and Wildlife Commission, Dept. of Natural Resources or whatever and talk to them. Here in Florida it's illegal to mess with alligators in any way.    (Not even getting into the physical dangers of this...)    And as for watching the Crocodile *clears her throat* Hunter, I wouldn't emulate anything that guy did, personally.|`|c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	They are probably a protected species... you would most likely need a permit to do this.  And because you don't list cities, you'd need to call the DNR and ask yourself.  You probably won't find specifics anywhere anyway.  They don't readily give out this information.
3IUMh4Igaa	They back bone will start to show, Their heads start to look like the jaw and eye area are protruding. They get a sunken stomach. They become sluggish... I couldn't find a picture.
NUIrBHXgaa	there are quite a few options you could go with, ghost shrimp of course, red cherries,pearl blues,snowball shrimp, amano shrimp, brown camo shrimp and cardinal shrimp just to name a few.    Here is a site with a large list of shrimp you could choose from.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	I love red crystal shrimp, they're a bit pricey and harder to find but adorable!  They also stay really small.    Easier to find are ghost shrimp, they're cheap, 33 cents were I work, and stay about an inch in length.  Best of Luck!|`|ur5wDhkMaa	Amano/Japonica Shrimps, just don't expect to see them much.    http://www.aquahobby.com/gallery/e_shrim...|`|UbSJPBuNaa	Ghost shrimp|`|qAwnAYGAaa	ghost shrimp are cheap and easy to find.

YpEswTQdaa	Yes,she should accept him. In fact if you mate 2 pure bred rabbits together,then a few hours later put her in with a cross bred male,the litter results may be half pure-bred looking & the other half cross breed looking!    I tried that once. What i normally do,with pure-bred breeding is mate the Doe to a buck,then a few hours later,mate her to a different,but still same breed buck. This increases the likely-hood of her conceiving,plus includes both the male rabbits appearance.     Hope this helps,xxx(P.S i also live in the UK! =)|`|MB1oT04maa	well......it's easier on the second date...so I wouldn't introduce your backup man just yet.    just remember, always bring the doe to the buck...or he'll be worried about the hubby coming home and interrupting|`|oGVWdnHraa	Its possible, but I doubt they would be show quality because you wouldnt be able to tell who is the father, thus you couldnt give them a viable pedigree.........
CqQ1DaKDaa	When considering buying a hutch you should really make sure it is large enough for the rabbit. As some hutches are too small for certain rabbit breeds. For information on which hutch is ideal visit this website:  http://www.therabbithouse.com/outdoor/in...  When looking around website's I've found this one to be the best to buy rabbit products from:  http://www.thepetextraordinarium.co.uk/i...  These hutches are great sized for rabbits outside, as they need as much exercise as a small dog and don't tend to get it in small hutches. They also need to be let out every day.  Have you ever considered having an indoor rabbit? They're incredibly easy to house train, and indoor cages cost less than hutches, much less.   If you're going to keep a rabbit outdoors I do advise a large hutch with an attached run and to keep two of them as a pair. The ideal pair is a neutered male and a spayed female.   For more information on rabbit care please visit my website:  www.pixibunni.webs.com  I hope I have been of help  Raych
1y1c5QWHaa	It depends on want you want her to do, but if you want to train her to do pretty much anything, you need to have a treat that she really likes and she only gets on special occasions.     Hope this helps you!|`|M9o5WpOqaa	Train her to do what exactly?|`|Bsk4Z0WQaa	I think you should train her.|`|kQf5TbUFaa	try using treats and don't do it so much be gentle with it reward it with treats new toys attachments an extra 15 minutes in the ball   good luck|`|LGDpt4jUaa	You can train any animal if they have the incentive of treats
u61yKsE3aa	Personally I love tegus and that would be my choice however they are for experianced keepers only. They require a lot of space and care and can get large.  Blue tongues are pretty cool as well.  They still need a lot of care but are not as hard as the tegu.  No matter which one you choose make sure you can provide them everything that they need here are some sights to help start your research.   http://exoticpets.about.com/od/lizardsas...  http://www.centralpets.com/animals/repti...  http://www.repticzone.com/caresheets/320...  http://www.anapsid.org/bluetong.html  http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/lizardsas...|`|Y4qrrRgCaa	blue tongued skink looks really cool......because of the blue tongue.|`|xoXkHOVsaa	Don't get the tegu unless you have a lot of experience.  They grow large, and can be difficult to tame.      I would get the skink.  It's much easier to handle and looks really cool.    Both these animals will be expensive and have large space requirements.  Do your research before you buy!
Ws2QPD0Iaa	That's so sad =[  Never trust the pet store.  You should go online and find out how to sex gerbils yourself, unfortuntley that happens a lot at pet stores.    I would just dispose of the body.  If you don't mom will probably eat the baby (it's not being mean, she's just keeping her other babies safe by keeping away potential germs...), but I would just take the baby out and get rid of it.    You can handle the babies the day they are born.  MAKE SURE you wash your hands first so you don't leave a scent on the babies.  When you put them back in the nest, make sure mom accepts them back, and if she seems alarmed, leave the pups alond for another couple of days.    Good luck!|`|uDQmkdouaa	congrats!     try to take it out when the mother is not looking. do not touch the other babies. she may be friendly but when it comes  to her babies she might get a little protectivce. my hamsters that died, i burried out in my back yard and left a little marink where they are.    good luck! =) =)|`|CvLwS9p5aa	wait until they are have fur etc. etc. and then train them as if you have just taken them home from the pet shop.  you should take it out of the cage copz germs and stuffs may grow on it  - infect other pups.   separate the the female and her pups from the males and advertise localy that you have pups. you can make money. also, keeping them would cost hundruds of pound and if you sex ONE wromg, you have even more pups so it will cost even more|`|2YIxnXXyaa	Take it out.  It could get bacteria on it just because it's dead and there's poo and pee and birth in the cage and you don't want that to give the other babies any problems.  Just take it out and throw it away.  They don't need their dead sibling in there haha.    Hope everything else goes well with it.|`|tvSG1diNaa	I've had pet gerbils before. Take the baby out because the mother knows it's dead. It can spread germs. The babies can be handled when they start to grow fur. You can pet the mother as long as you have your hands washed. Don't have any smell of food on your hands or she might nip you, not out of meanness but because she smells something good.|`|yJqXmy8Caa	take the baby out and dipose of it in a bin or you could berry it in your garden.|`|wNfGstspaa	The mother knows that the pup is dead, so you should take it out. Then you should get a small box and put some bedding in it and then put the pup in it. Then put the top on and bary the box. Wash your hands good after you handle the dead pup. I'm sorry about the pup, but good luck with the others. And you should take them to the vet or pet shop when they get a little older, to see if they are boys or girls.  Hope this helps.  If you have questions, e-mail me at: gerbil.love@rocketmail.com.|`|gjC2TB0zaa	Take it out for sure  I'd also suggest moving the mother and babies to a different cage, and once the babies are a bit older keeping them in that separate cage without the mother.|`|ZGLbVjgTaa	take it out. it would only invite flies and bacterias to infest the nest. and the mother herself placed the pup outside, it means that she is letting go of her sweety
bepZupAfaa	the reason that they come looking for you is probably because you are the one that cleans the cage the most and tends to their need. my ferrets always come to me first before they go to my husband. i'm the one that takes care of all of their needs. he just loves on them.    i have 5 ferrets all of them answer to their name except one and that is because she is deaf . but she does recognize me when i pick her up to give her loving.     my sister has 6 ferrets and a couple of them will get into the shower with her as well. they don't like to get baths but like to take a shower with her.    rotate your toys out every now and then. they won't realize that they are getting old toys back to play with when you do this. they'll think it is something new to play with.  i have flex tubes. (looks like a dryer hose)  also have a crinkle sack they love to play in. you can use a box and cut holes in it big enough to climb in and out of and crumple up newspaper or packing paper they love to play in this, paper bags, walmart bags but you need to watch them when they are playing with the walmart bag so they don't get caught in it. the noise it makes just drives them crazy.    don't use toilet paper or paper towel rolls as the ferret might get itself caught in it without you realizing it     if you still have snow on the ground you can put some in a box that they can climb in and out they'll love it. mine will play in it till their little feet get too cold and get out but will go back for more after they warm up again. use powdery snow  they love to dig in it.  i usually let them play in the snow a couple of times each winter.    hope this helps and have fun|`|nxbkbDpeaa	Reading the mind of a ferret can be a difficult proposition. Just because they come to you first might just mean they like the way you smell.     As for keeping them happy, just give them plenty of love and a nice rotation of toys. My fuzz buts love anything that rattles, long tubes, boxes full of rice to dig in (the non-instant variety), small stuffed animals, and kong toys. Just rotate which toys you give them so they don't get bored of them.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	Ferrets are similar to kittens. I wouldn't be surprised if they could learn their names. They are playful, curious, highly active and sociable.     They are also quick learners and can be trained to do various tricks.     Being sociable, I'm not surprised to hear they want attention, even including shower time. :)    If they are in high spirits, they tend to run,jump,twist in the air and collide with household objects. So don't be too alarmed. They are just happy.     They also sleep 18 hours a day on average, so don't be too alarmed if it seems they are snoozing a lot. :)|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Just because a ferret doesn't like someone doesn't mean they'll bite; they will tolerate a person, even if they aren't bonded.  Usually, though, they will show love/affection by coming up to you (even if it's only to say hi, and then they wonder off).  And this may sound kinda corny, but it's true: it's just a feeling you'll get, how they look at you (yes, they have a LOT of expression, actually).  I know, since one of my first ferrets I didn't bond with right away--she was 1.5 years old before we did more than tolerate each other.  Then, suddenly, it was different, and she's become my best girl *g* (and she is--she's the smartest of the bunch and has taught and reinforced the rules with my other two).    All mine know their names.  I didn't train them--I just expected them to learn it and they did.  I call one, and no one but that ferret comes until I call the rest.  They are smart; if you give them credit for having brains then they will show you that they do :)    To keep them happy give them a lot of interaction, and a variety of toys (they can be as simple as new boxes, large pickle jars, balled up newspapers/tissue paper, soda bottles with beads/beans in and the lid on, stuffed animals, old baby toys, socks, etc).|`|AA12281930	well if it didn`t like you it would either bite you or just runaway when you approached it...in my garden ive laid out a network of tunnels using drain pipes they love searching and exploring them especially if i hide some dog or cat food among them|`|CEgq26oHaa	Provide them with lots of love and attention when they are out.  If you catch them doing the "weasel dance" they are happy.  I had a ferret that would steal all the toilet paper from the bathroom.  I thought my kids were just using too much until i was spring cleaning and found TONS of it under my bed!  They sleep pretty much all day and night but should be let out at least an hour or two a day for exercise.  Mine love to play with the balls that have bells in them and stuffed toys.  They also like to play with bags that make noise.|`|8RNPlSAfaa	OH wow.. yeah... uhmmm    hey I know this.. I'll star this for jackpot.. he's like the resident noah around here..    he's so going to love the religous reference too!!!
gM7VuCM4aa	lol...no you are not hallucinating, since they are both of breeding age it's very possible they mated. Cats don't care if it's their brother or sister...I know ew...but that's they way it is in the feline world. Since you said it doesn't matter if she is pregnant you are keeping the kittens, don't waste your money taking her to a vet to find out. She will show signs in a couple weeks, her nipples will become swollen and another week or two later her belly will start to show. The feline gestation period is on average 63 days. Good luck with kittens and baby!|`|a984cQjKaa	did she ever go into heat?  she would be wandering around your house, wailing loudly, rolling around and sticking her butt in the air. is she getting fatter?  are her nipples turning pinker?  also, unless you were gone a few days you would have caught them going at it since cats mate quite a few times, and loudly at that.  cat sex isn't pleasant!  if you think she got pregnant in december, she'd have already had the kittens by now, as cats carry kittens about sixty five days before they have them.  and them thinking of each other as brother and sister won't stop them from mating if she goes into heat.      it will definitely cost you money to take her to the vet,they usually charge money just to see the cat, and to find out if shes preggers  they'd need to do bloodwork, most likely.   you can wait and see, or you can make an appointment to get her fixed and they can tell you then if she's carrying kittens.  either way, definitely make sure you get her fixed as well as your boy.  you'll be a lot happier that way, and so will she.  and kudos to you for deciding to keep the babies if she is pregnant!  just make sure you get them fixed too lol.|`|jg1pbV5Xaa	It will cost money to take the cat to the vet. Do take her and get her fixed and get him snipped as you put it. Both! Yes they will have sex, it is part of a cat's nature. She is also sympathetic to you, feels your pregnacy even if she does not understand it as such, will try to comfort you by sleeping with you ( it also comforts and protects her). Get them fixed! The kittens they make are not going to make you as happy as your baby who will keep you much busier than you think right now. Better to keep, have only the two cats, and your dogs, healthier for you and them both.|`|EmX453LMaa	I have had a lot of cats, and I am going to warn you: they breed young and they dont think twice about breeding with a sibling. So you may want to get him sniped ASAP anyway.    First of all, did you notice your female cat going into heat? She will start rubbing herself on surfaces and meowing a lot.     The male cat may start to spray when he reaches maturity. Your lucky if he does it in a litter box, but it will be very little urine but very potent.    Then the way cats mate are kind of violent. So I think you would see a riff between them if he had mated with her. You would probably see him try to mate with her, which is biting her on the neck while getting behind her. They do not seem to do it just once, and you would find yourself constantly yelling for that cat to leave the other one alone. So if you have not seen this, good chance it has not happened. But the fact that the cat sleeps with you might mean she feels like she needs protection, so maybe she has been attacked. If she just seems to be really affectionate all of a sudden, she is probably just in heat.    So my advice: get at least one of them fixed. Males are usually cheaper|`|WqGxGJkbaa	Cats don't understand that you are not supposed to mate with your brother or sister - all they understand is animal instinct, which is to carry on and on and on breeding.  If your female cat is 7 months old then it is almost a certainty that she is pregnant.  Please get your male cat neutered as soon as possible as, if your female does have kittens, she can become pregnant again almost immediately.      You should definitely see a vet as soon as possible as she is still only a kitten herself and the possibility of her having a normal birth is dubious and you could lose both her and her kittens without professional help.
JGq9rKBOaa	I have three guinea pigs and I have seen NO EVIDENCE whatsoever that they recognize their names. They do, however, respond to the noise of the fridge opening and the rustling of plastic bags.|`|MpVQE8tnaa	Ya you can rename them|`|XurYYreBaa	You can rename her if you like & she'll get used to the new name while she's getting used to her new home & person.  When we adopted our pig he was over 2 yrs & although we called him by his shelter name @ first it just didn't seem to fit him.  After knowing him for a few days we changed his name it it didn't take long @ all before he began responding to it.|`|xyPpruSjaa	No, there is a STRICT law that you can't rename them!    JUST KIDDING! Of COURSE you can rename it! They aren't going to come to your house in the middle of the night and steal your guinea pig because you named it something else ;D You should notify the employees or manager that they shouldn't be naming the guinea pigs opposite gender names. Sometimes people do this to make fun of them.     Good luck!|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	When you rename her just try to pick a name that has a ring, rime, that some what sounds similar  to the guinea pig so it would not be a tremendous readjustment for it, Like Totts.f I am sure from that you can just make up words, most of my guineas had names that were made up words that were sounds that they liked. My favorite was Iaqu which was a play from IQ as every  thought guinea pigs were dumb, and i had a dream where my grand daughter called her I A Q U in the dream so it became her name and she loved it. We had tried many names and she would not respond to any of them, so you must pick a sound that they respond to and recognize as them.    good luck finding a name and enjoy your guinea pig|`|va8xvhthaa	Of course you can rename her!!! Once you have her as a pet, you can change her name to whatever you like. Thanks for adopting though!!!|`|lFVbACCwaa	Once you have actually got the pet, you can do what you like with it!(within reason)|`|7AI58IS8aa	You can name it anything you want. Guinea Pigs don't recognize their names anyway.    I'm so glad you're adopting one instead of buying one from the shelter :]|`|21cf999bfe54057972e1de48b7cd2cf3aa	Yes, you can name her anything you would like. That is part of the fun in adopting a pet. Sometimes the people at the shelter don't know the gender when they give the name. I used to work at a shelter and if we made this mistake we usually fixed it. Sometimes a pet came in with a name and we kept the name that the owners used. The only time you would need to be concerned is if you adopted a dog that knew his/her name already. Thanks for adopting a shelter animal!

vS1Z0inOaa	Your basking area is waaay too large and your water is not deep enough...     These are deep-water turtles that need the land only to bask. I would advise you get rid of the land area completely and give them just a small basking platform. I like the floating turtle dock or pieces of cork bark because it provides a good dry basking area that is easily accessible to the turtles while allowing the turtles to use the water area under it for swimming and hiding. Another good choice is the ZooMed floating turtle log--they enjoy swimming right through it and it's something they would use in the wild. Shine your basking light on this but place it no closer than 12 inches from the basking surface (100W is pretty strong--I usually use 60W in the house). Then, please, get a thermometer and make sure the area is at 90 degrees or so. Too warm or too cold and the turtles won't use it!     The water should be twice as deep as the larger turtle is long. That is the bare minimum. However, I would suggest you fill your tank 1/2 to 3/4 deep. They will really appreciate having lots and lots of room to swim! The water temperature should be at 70 to 75 degrees--that's about room temperature so you shouldn't need a heater unless your house is cold. The water has to be at least 10 degrees colder than the basking area or the turtles will have no motivation to ever leave the water.     Have you tried leaving the greens in their tank and swapping it out every other day? How about allowing the feeder fish to live in there with them? If they are babies, they likely won't eat the greens as they are more carnivorous as babies, but you should keep offering it because they will eventually become more vegetarian as they mature. Turtles have strong predatory instincts, but I have seen many reject live food until they were living with the fish for awhile. First they enjoy just chasing it and playing with it. Later they learn to eat it and enjoy the meat... Baby fish are a wild baby turtle's first meal, but they most likely don't catch it the day they are born ;)     It's completely normal for a turtle to sit on the bottom of the tank and just stick their noses up to breathe when they ae resting or right after eating, but they shouldn't be doing that 24/7. They really should be spending a good deal of time basking and it's essential for them to be able to digest food and get completely dry (to prvent shell rot). If they're not basking, that could be another reason they're not real hungry. I doubt there is anything wrong with your turtles; make these adjustments and they'll be fine :)|`|2YIxnXXyaa	Try feeding them some worms.  If that doesn't work, try to cut it in half so they smell it, it should be irresistable.    I'm sure they bask, maybe not for a long time, or when you're around, but you'd be able to tell by their shell if they weren't basking.  They could just be shy and not come out when you're around.  Mine did that for a while when they were in my pond.  Now they don't care and they won't move even if you try to touch them while they're out on the bank of my pond.    But if you're too concerned, I would suggest trying to find a good vet who specializes in exotic animals and maybe bringing them in to make sure everything's a-kay.
sPtRjRBEaa	im not sure , sorry.   I hope you get it sorted out soon.  Good luck .
yvWI1u28aa	Yup, that sounds ok, but he can easily jump the bricks- 5cm isnt very high! Just check for weeds and make sure the trees aren't pine or cheddar, and make sure the hidey-hole is very secure and big, with a piggie sized entrance so that if a predator came along he'd have somewhere to hide. If it gets cold, put a lot of hay around the place, and fill the shelter with hay. If it gets too hot, get some icecubes, wrap them in a towel (a thick, bathroom towel) and put it in the shade. sit him by it for a bit so he knows its cold, and when he gets too hot he'll come over to get cool. (no, he won't get too cold if you've wrapped it in a bathroom towel!)  =)    To be on the safe side, shut him in his cage at night (BEFORE it gets dark, so the preadators aren't out and about), and let him out when it gets light. Scattering his daily veg will give him something to do, and you can give him loo rolls and toys aswell. Put his water and pellets in the same place every day so he knows where to find them =)    Piggies can't catch anything but mites off other animals, and they can't catch diseases of them either. So long as his roaming place is kept clean, he won't be at risk from flystrike (flies laying eggs in piggie poo, piggie going along and basically if piggie gets too close the baby flies get inside him and...) but fly strike is very rare, and using basic herbs under his hutch bedding and around his roamy space (thyme, mint etc.) puts the flies off =)    cute piggie!! ^.^ thats a calico, v sweet!! 8D    xx|`|ZA8vMZ7eaa	not really, its more natural for them but with that comes the fact that it could get eaten by a fox or exposed to diseases from other animals|`|2YIxnXXyaa	If he seems happy, healthy, doesn't get too hot or too cold, has shelter, food, water and you check on him daily...I don't see why not.  Call your vet to be sure though, don't want him to get sick or have any other animal giving him a disease.    Make sure he's safe from birds though.  Sometimes big ones fly over our house, and I live in the city.  They've tried to have a go at my smaller chicken, rabbit, pond turtles/fish and my tortoises.  Just a bit of a warning for you.    Good luck.|`|ZGLbVjgTaa	weh they all look the same. i have a farm for guinea pigs.  they are all free roaming on a fenced area, where THEY COULDNT JUMP. you never know what's comming on their way. a hungry dog, a snake or some falcons.    its okay to let them roam, provided that they are not eating poisonous plants and have shelter, dont get wet and dont get on the sun too much.  if you want, you could buy him a partner so that you may have many pet in just months!|`|Da05Syeqaa	I think it would be better for your guinea pig to live inside. One reason is because you know that there might be lots of insects and bugs that can get on your guinea pig, and you don't want that.
ce6172d59fe7a0f01a586ed3e1737d4aaa	In my opinion, a Labrador is the best dog for anyone :-)
9kTejB0uaa	Sorry, a young married couple with 9 - 5 jobs, and presumably quite a social life at this time, living in a flat (regardless of the huge park 2 mins away) is no situation to bring a dog into, especially a puppy.  This couple need to wait until they have started their family (say when the first is around 5).  By that time their life-style will be far more suitable to include a dog.|`|oGVWdnHraa	A cat, 9-5 is too long for a dog (esp. a puppy) to be left alone, unless they want a destroyed house and a disobediant dog :)|`|LOQMQU8Saa	Labradors are a great breed of dogs.

They'll have to take it to the park every time it wants to go,or let it go in the street and then clear it up.  Secondly 9-5 jobs aren't very conducive to having a dog-are they getting a puppy? If so how will they train it? A labrador is a good choice,as previously mentioned,but even they need activities and human contact.Perhaps they should get a dog walker for when they are not at home.|`|Smj8rZalaa	Tell your bro to buy a golden retriever and I bet ya that if he buys one his life will become heaven.

As for a dog, any of the larger sizes will do, except Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, and the Bully breeds.    Have them go to a shelter and get to know the dogs.  But someone really does need to come in about noon and let the dog out to potty.  It would be best if they could get a second dog sometime after getting the first one.  This will help with the boredom issue and the dogs will be less likely to tear the house apart.    Just because they are newlyweds doesn't mean that they won't have time for the dog.  I know someone mentioned that.  I know newlyweds that work all day, and bring their dogs with them most everywhere they go(with a few exceptions) in the evenings and weekends.|`|iVQULHqYaa	Please do not condemn another dog to a life of misery . Apart from the fact that a dog will be lonely and sad it will be destructive if it is left alone all day. In theory they are out from 9-5 however they will have a social life and this extends the time that a dog will be left alone.    If your brother  lives in rented accommodation he will be responsible for the damage. In addition to this a dog who is left alone will bark and bark and bark. The other tenants will object to this and your brother and his wife will be faced with eviction. Then what happens, will they dump the dog or hope like hell that they can get other accommodation.    The uncaring answerer's will suggest a cage, yes this will stop a dog from being destructive, however it will have bowel and bladder problems if it tries to restrain itself from eliminating. A cage will not stop a dog from constantly barking if it is left alone and your brother will still have a problem.|`|6259e0028dc7841ea4761f924c6cd735aa	japanese spitz    POMERANIAN    german spitz    xx|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	Labradors

3p6wp7DYaa	Yes, as you know, beagles are very vocal. But not all bark like that. And it sounds like you're describing a dog that never stops barking at you. He may be doing it for attention. Some dogs learn that if they bark, the humans around will look at them, talk to them, pick them up, or even yell. All of those responses add to the dog getting more attention when they bark then when they are quiet. As you probably also know, beagles are extremely social dogs. I have a beagle/terrier mix (all of the beagle hunting instinct with a terrier personality) and he only barks and howls to get other dogs to "come over." He never barks at me, but when he hear the neighbor's dog getting home, he will sit by the door and howl away like that other dog is his only hope for companionship... :)    It is hard to know what your dog means when he's barking, but I would try two things. First of all, never give him any attention when he barks. Get up and walk away, turn your body away from him and ignore the noise. Do not talk. Do not look at him. Don't even tell him to stop. As soon as he is quiet for 3 seconds, reach down and pet him, talk, give him a treat, whatever. If he begins barking again, go back to ignoring him. He should associate the fact that he only gets attention when he's quiet and stop barking all the time.    Second, I would take him to play dates with other dogs. Is there a dog park near your house? Even if you have to drive to the park, do it. This dog needs doggie friends more than he needs anything else in his life. My dog loves to play with me and everything, but he craves the companionship of other dogs more than anything. They were bred to hunt in groups, so their whole body screams at them to be around other dogs.    Good luck, and if none of that helps, get a trainer. Steer clear of anyone who tells you to use a "bark collar" it's the worst idea out there.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Cough - apart from the fact that a Beagle is a very vocal breed, get to the reason for the barking, what started him off, and remove it.  If you 'shout' back, he thinks you are joining in.  The best you can do is totally ignore him, give him something to concentrate his attention on (toy/bone/whatever).  And if he is old enough, up the exercise.|`|FF9mMlgKaa	clobber it!|`|zZZnQuQJaa	Beagles are very vocal dogs - Did you read up on the breed at all before getting it?|`|qqUvoC5uaa	He's a beagle, it's what they do.    Have you tried walking him? My beagle can tire out 4 adult men while playing fetch and still be wanting to play.    Is he barking at anything in particular?

Saying anything loud to correct it will not have any effect as it will think you are barking back at him. Why should he stop barking when you are?     Make sure he's getting good walks, but dog walks, running off the lead or on a long lead so he can sniff about and be a dog and be fulfilled. They are scent dogs, give him a daily game of find the rag by letting it sniff a rag that's been rubbed in its food or has a treat wrapped in it and then hiding it and sending the dog off to find it. This will give him fantastic mental stimulation and fulfillment.    As for the barking, make a short, sharp sound like AH or SHHHT, but no words or harsh tone, looking at the dog. When he stops, turn your face to the side and call him over to you. This will show that when he stops barking, he will get your attention, not while he is barking and also, by turning your fact to the side when he stops, you are giving a clear calming signal to the dog in his own language.    You need to be consistent, make sure he is getting sufficient daily mental and physical stimulation and if you can, hire a behavior therapist to come in and help you.|`|KVVvKHsAaa	buy a cat|`|a925a8f202675cec3997dc4ebbf993fdaa	Ur dog is a hunting dog.  Are you supplying it's needs?  It will need extra and above some other breeds.      Barking!!  Well you don't say how old exactly and what brought about this behaviour.  If you have led this behaviour on with puppy games in the past then it will continue on.  Except a little puppy bark has now turned into an all out 'ear piercing adult bark'.    If you started it out as a game then you need to retrain the game.  Stop doing anything that you started it out with, any stimulus that created the barking to begin with.   Think back to what you did and undo it.|`|7dijqYLyaa	you could have him de-barked....|`|bfSMlkivaa	It's a beagle.  Get used to it.
a984cQjKaa	oh yeah, i have a cat who loves any kind of dairy product, be it milk, cheese, ice cream, cream cheese, whatever.  once we had vegan roommates, and they offered him some soy cheese.  he sniffed it, then turned up his nose at it and looked at them like they had deeply offended him.  he then ignored them for like, a week.|`|cie3oBcXaa	All my cats go mad for cheese too!|`|jg1pbV5Xaa	Yes, much more than mice in cartoons actually, laugh. Only give a little or they get bunged up and they get nasty gas, oh oh gag gas. My cat loves cake, cake, my fingers get bitten if I do not share it. A bit of cheese is good for your cat, as long as it is only a bit, they will lie and insist that more is better, a night smelling bad cat gas will assure you that less is better no matter what the cat tells you.|`|661b6942f6dddce43fe2dcb16a5f0068aa	Yes, my cat loves it. It's a dairy product.
0b1fa9ca19ef34843cb9155776450abaaa	It's because ferrets have a poor reputation, Say the work 'FERRET' to most people and they will say ' They bite or They stink'.  Years ago when ferrets were just used for rabbiting and ratting people thought the ferret need to be aggressive to be good at it's job.  The friendliest ferret can be a good rabbiter. They do have bad press and I wish people would give them a chance.   Ferrets are like dogs, no bad one just uneducated owners...|`|FYjf7hkEaa	Because they believe negative propaganda about them. Same as they do with my 8 rats.|`|bqbrKFeUaa	I would absolutely LOVE to hold a ferret I never have before but I think they are awesome and so so cute. Maybe people just relate to ferrets as a rodent like rats or mice and they dislike that. Or maybe since a different type of pet they are scared or not use to it so they act disgusted just to get out of it and use it as an excuse.|`|7AI58IS8aa	Because they are related to weasels, and weasels have a bad rep ( eg. stories, fables )|`|09zVUMBRaa	Probably because they look like elongated rats.|`|2284892d397da9e7d9297a73b92bd630aa	I can't stand the way they smell. I used to work at a pet shop and refused to clean their habitats because the smell made me wretch. Even when they are descented they give off a funky smell that I just can't take.|`|yAXrsQiFaa	They do??    I think they are very cute....|`|sqNsOIzkaa	I've never seen one and sure would not know how to handle it. They look like...really long rodents. I have nothing against them but they're so unusually limber and quickwitted. Its different from a dog...no offense. Some people don't like holding rat-like things. My friend got scared by my rabbit because she said it was a large rat with big ears. I was like...you're a hairless gorilla ***** but you don't see me screaming. LOL...I'm getting off track.|`|lyNgNpRgaa	They look "ratty".      Personally I love them, they are so much fun.  Cleaning up after them is not however much fun.  :(|`|n5NltZVGaa	It's how they LOOOOK at you, staring with their little beady eyes, wanting something.  Like raccoons, would you want a raccoon in your lap?|`|7wkHVaNyaa	They smell like urine. Sorry but they do or their cage does. People who have them as pets have acclimated to the smell. New comers can smell them very well. I'm sure they are nice but i don't want to hold anything that smells like that, sorry.|`|xR5mCcD8aa	I've held plenty of ferrets. The problem might be that they have a very bad smell.|`|RKOzbNLdaa	I love ferrets and I have wanted one for a long time but I had to settle for a hedgehog. But i think that most people think that they smell bad and that there a rodent (which they arent!!!!). But other then that I have on idea.|`|4SQx8smEaa	Same reason people do not like my rats.  A lot of people look at me weird when I tell them I have pet rats. They think of them as vermin.  And I think o well they are the ones missing out on the worlds greatest pets.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	LOL I have 2 cats, a dog, and a ferret...and my boyfriend and I have no problems with the ferret, but you're right, up until now, we've only gotten one guest to hold him. I'm not really sure....maybe it's just because people do mistake them for a rodent, and are usually turned off by anything thought to be related to rats and mice. I had a pet rat when I was younger, too, and no one seemed to like him, either!|`|1itC64nVaa	sometimes the word gets out and people tell other people that sometime, FERRETS STINK, or sometimes people are SOOO scared of animals biting them. Just tell them, its okay, my ferrets are wonderful, they wont bite you, they love having people holding them (thats if they  really do) I mean come on my mom cant stand ferrets but i like them(they're wierd i like wierd things) because i know that ferrets really are nice animals! i hope this was useful|`|LON89dJaaa	I HATE FERRETS.  no offence. :)  i'm just scared i'll get bitten.
723qR6p8aa	LOL i have never ever in my life heard of a hamster and a hen together thats crazy in my opinion! LOL. But it is quite cool. I'd say you have to keep them seperate.

Mwah/.x|`|dSQxCGbJaa	Now there's an image...|`|BaNrweQ4aa	how come your hamster and your hen are in seperate tanks? i would get the hamster away from the hen to be honest, as hens are quite big and hamsters are only small. you never know what could happen. cyril is such a cute hamster name by the way! :D|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	um....I'd keep them in separate tanks. Don't let them fight.|`|I0G597aAaa	you keep a hamster and a hen in the same tank   Lol.!  move them apart   the hen might get angry one day and try to eat it :P|`|t4FBtIsTaa	You have a pet hen??????????????
t6Ya3c3baa	I think your friend is pulling your leg.    While it is true that in Tudor times many dwellings were infested with mice; I don't think anyone deliberately lay on the floor to be cleaned by them.    People, and their beds, in Medieval, Renascence, and Tudor times were often infested with lice, and fleas. Mice may have come, unbidden, to them while they were in bed sleeping to feed on the lice, and fleas.    But, to deliberately lie on the floor to be cleaned by mice, I don't think so.
zILwtO22aa	A cheap way would be to buy 3 pieces of decking timber that reached across, join them with strips of cut decking underneath with screws, or if easier, nails, and lay it across.  If you need sides then, use netting fixed to some posts, they don't need to be fixed to the bridge, hammer them in the ground, to stop the decking from moving.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	I shop on this site all the time, and their stuff is really great and lasts forever, but for great prices! This garden bridge is only $15, and their shipping is uaully a flat rate of $3 or $5. This is the link to the exact item. http://www.collectionsetc.com/Bamboo_Bri...  Hope this helps!!!

zOBoTMLMaa	yes it is safe for you to put the fish in,yes a 30 gallon filter is good enough,just give them regular GOLDFISH flakes about a pinch,i would go with amy for one of the fish!!!|`|HKuQuE4Yaa	You shouldn't introduce all the fish at once.  Part of cycling a tank is slowly adding fish to help create the necessity for the bacteria.  Right now there is not enough bacteria built up for all the fish because there is not a need for it.  As for food, you should just feed the fish a high quality gold fish food.  There are some great Japanese made foods you can buy at pet stores.  They are goldfish, they don't need a varied diet, just a good quality goldfish food from a pet store.
OjeL1if4aa	I couldn't honestly say with one that young. Have you considered just driving in a halter to start out with? Then, when he's got the basics switching to a bit... by then his mouth might have grown so spending money on a small bit, just to need a bigger size in a few months is kind of pointless.    I am by no means against starting round work that early... makes things much easier to get in the saddle as a 3 yr old! But, unless he's already had a bit in his mouth, chances are he's going to fight it and since you're wanting a soft bit it sounds like you have good intentions for him.     As for bit size... I'm gonna guess 4-4.5" for one that young... just keep in mind he'll most likely outgrow it in a few months to a year later.|`|AA11164207	no matter the age of a horse or pony,there is only one correct way to determine  the appropriate bit size.You measure the distance between the bars of the mouth.The portion of the bit thats actually in the mouth,show extend just slightly passed the bars as to not allow any pinching from the shank or jointed pieaces such as snaffles.I would start him in a rubber d ring at first though.be sure to apply adequate leg support for all four legs.added support should be applied to the knee area.this is needed because a horses knee usually does not completeley close until about two.this saves a lot of knee injuries|`|AA11570905	A yearling is too young to start that kind of training!  I honestly don't think bitting should happen until at least two and a half at the very earliest.  I don't think horses should be ridden until they are 3 or 4 either.   My opinion is based on medical facts pertaining to the maturity rate of a horses skeletal system.|`|mKWwz1uUaa	I would highly recommend to wait to put anything in his mouth at this young of a age, rubber or not.  Start with halter and long lead lines is the best way.  I didn't put a thing in my girls mouth til she was three, well other than my fingers, lol...I taught her how to drive and did all my work with halter, and leads.  She's a 1/2 Arb/QH:)  Best of luck and enjoy baby's r soooo much fun:) Wait to ride til at least 3 yrs of age:)|`|hjLe1SRjaa	how old is he... because starting a horse to early mess there knees up for life give him at least 3 or more years to fully develop then start riding and driving him.  that's the way its been for my whole life n i have 2 national grand championships under my belt
IrdZKYT3aa	Hahaha.  Salt water fish actually gulp their water to move it through their gills, so you know they aren't thirsty!|`|SZOMVGBRaa	LOL    Your a funny one.|`|jJ152e8Iaa	Lol this is a cute question. I know turtles drinks a lot!!! hmm... i dont fishes don't get thirsty, just hungry lol this question sounds funny & tricky at the same time its like "can you drown a fish?" believe it or not, you can drown our own fishs, just depends what kind of water you use for them lol|`|qw4EevKsaa	thristy?  umm..that would be thirsty.   and what do you think? they live in water. helooo?|`|UbSJPBuNaa	lol no they live in water they drink when they want to drink|`|qAwnAYGAaa	all life needs water so they drink it but i dont know if they ever get thirsty|`|F15EPx0Taa	No they don't get thirsty, they live in water. They can drink whenever they want.|`|XAIiOFkXaa	Reminds me of my Son when one day I said "I need to give those fish some more water" "Why? They haven`t drunk that they`ve got yet".was the reply.

d8f443bc582285db859040a0c5e47adcaa	if they have been any where near a mail they will be gravid.most adult live-bearers have a dark spot and if well fed can look pregnant,the best way to tell is that about 24/36 hours before giving birth they change shape slightly and go square at the back-end[vent] as against just looking full.This is the time to give some cover for the fry to hide in.believe it or not one of the best things to use are the plastic string type pan scrubbers.slightly pull them apart and put into tank-the fry can move about in them but the parents cannot.you can either move the adults or the fry or wait until they are a bit bigger before taking the plastic out.I personally flock breed my live-bearers and once they get use to it[as long as well fed] the majority syrvive in the tank.                                                                       hope this helps                                           regards|`|iaHM24Xjaa	Most probably they are pregnant because guppies are super fast when it comes to reproducing. If your guppy or guppies are pregnant, they would most likely be slightly fatter than the other fishes in your tank and possibly being less active or more secretive. Sometimes they prefer to hide when giving birth. Good luck!|`|AraBfesHaa	best bet is theyre pregnant.  you should have gotten males.  Just because they were separated from the males at the store doesnt mean much.  They were probably with males all the way until they got to the pet shop.  The store prb did that in case they got stuck with them for any length of time, they didn't want to be in the situation you are probably in now, tons of fry.  But they were prob pg before they got to the shop.  So unless they've been separated from the males since they were very small, and they're now full grown, it's almost a given that they'll be pg.  If you can post a pic with your question we might be able to tell you.  And if you let the pet shops choose which fish they think you'd want, they're more likely to give you the pregnant ones first and not tell you about it.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	They will be pregnant. Long before we can sex them visually the males have caught the females. They aren't born pregnant, but it happens pretty soon afterwards.    Whenever you buy a female guppy, assume she is pregnant. Pretty much the only real reason for putting males in a different tank is they sell for more.
7HxJvbjMaa	Remove carbon from the filter before treating, raise the water temp. to at least 80, and add some aquarium salt. I don't know the size of your tank so I can't tell you how much salt to add.  Ich parasite doesn't do well in warm salty environments.  It is important to vacuum the gravel too, because they live down in the gravel when not attacking your fish.|`|OsVswissaa	RidIch is the best ich med.|`|TjLCnxkKaa	If you have it did you make sure you removed any carbon from the filter?|`|Qwr3FvE6aa	Gradually raise the temperature to about 86* (about a degree every hour or two). Keep it like that until the ich goes away.
i5dTQhoVaa	Water and chinchillas don't mix. A dust bath is sufficient|`|NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    You should never use water or "small pet shampoos" on a Chinchilla, they have oils in their fur that can be disturbed, and because they're desert creatures, water can make them quite sick.    You need to find Chinchilla bath SAND (not the dust, it can get in their lungs and hurt them).  They make little houses you can use for this, but any fairly large plastic tub is actually better because they have more room to roll around and have fun.    You can do this as often as you'd like - they love the stuff!    If the pee or poop in it, you can scoop it out (it kinda clumps like kitty litter) and re-use it 2-3 times before putting new bath sand in.    You can find the bath sand in most pet stores, or it's available from any  big online pet supply website in the US, Canada or UK :)    Have fun!    Daisy|`|3ctchU2faa	"A regular dust bath is an absolute necessity for chinchillas. Taking a vigorous dust bath is one of their natural behaviors, and is how chinchillas keep their lush coats clean and healthy. Not only does this dust bath help to keep their thick fur smooth and silky, it is thought to be relaxing and fun for chinchillas. Indeed, chinchillas really get into their baths, rolling and flipping in the dust with great abandon."    Watch the video!|`|UlBryfIoaa	They don't need to take water baths. Just dust baths. There from the dessert so they don't take water baths in the wild. They keep their fur clean with the dust. I wouldn't try it either it could be traumatic.|`|tSvixAGoaa	i think chinchilas have an oil on their fur that can be ruined by water. I might be wrong, but i do know that you arent supposed to bath them in water. if your chinchila stinks, ask a good exotic pet store what to do, not petco or petsmart|`|Bsk4Z0WQaa	NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You should never put a chinchilla in water.  To  give it a bath you need to go to the pet store and get chinchilla dust and a little house to put the dust in.  Then you should put the chinchilla in the little house with dust and it will do the rest.  It is really funny to watch because it will roll around really quickly.
IrdZKYT3aa	Hmm, does it look raised? It could be a fungus infection, you'll needs meds to cure this.  One fungus treatment for tropical fish is a salt and heat treatment.  Up the temp to the 80's and add some aquarium salt, it's a lot less harsh than meds.  But with goldfish, who like cold water, have to be carefully dealt with them doing this.I suggest pimafix, it's all natural and not as harsh as some other meds.  I however, use QuickCure, it's good for a wide variety of issues, but when it says may stain aquarium sealant let me just say that it will.    Best of Luck!
82rx0s5Aaa	get hedgehog food?|`|sfnRrAAmaa	NOT MILK!    it kills them.|`|vJ0NhNXcaa	Hedgehogs eat a variety of bugs actually 400 species. Most of which reside in your garden (depending on your location).
gzaVGE4Qaa	Make sure you hold him/her every day. Give them treats only when they are out of the cage (meal worms or crickets - but only one or two because they have a lot of fat in them). My babies mostly just hang out in a blanket and sleep on me while I work, read, or watch TV. I love them!
juU6nJqUaa	A guinea pig is a great cage pet.  They love to get out and be played with but can be happy all day while you are at school.  They eat guinea pig chow, but also, fresh fruits and veggies.  We had one that would ring a bell toy hanging in its cage every time we opened the refridgerator.  It wanted it's carrots and parsley!    Get a nice big cage and plan to change the cage every couple of days.  You can even find one at the humane shelter that is already grown and tame.|`|srSXgoTvaa	i would say a hamster. they are fairly tame, and can stay in the cage but you can also let them out in a ball to play. plus they only live about 2-5 yrs, so when you get to college it prob wont be alive so you wont have to worry about caring for it when you would rather got out and party.|`|Jguzosm2aa	No pet will be tame and handleable enough from the start to spend most of it's time alone in it's cage.     You can't have it both ways; if you want a friendly, playful pet you'll have to spend time with it frequently. If you want to spend very little time with it, you'll have to deal with the fact that it's not going to be very interested in being your toy when you do decide you want to pay attention to it.    That said, a rat is a good, low cost pet who will be happy to spend most of the day in it's cage, so long as the cage is an adequate size and has some things inside for the rat to entertain itself. It would be preferable to get two rats of the same sex - again, being a relatively low cost pet, this should be well within your budget.    Rats are normally rather tame even from the start. It will take some time before they will stay in your hands for long periods of time, as they do rather enjoy exploring, but they are known for their friendly and intelligent nature.|`|AA12188347	Probably a hampster or maybe a guinnea pig.  They tend to spend a majority of the time in the cage but do need some attention and handling(so they arent afraid when you go to get them outta the cage)   you will need to check their food and water every day and clean their cage at least once a week.  Also another option is to get a parakeet but same rules as above!  If you arent willing to give them some time maybe just a gold fish or something.|`|XYH2tM2Eaa	A turtle? They are fun.. I had 3... They are easy to feed they may eat bananas, strawberries, but mine loved tuna!! They are funny, too... I would suggest an eastern box turtle... you can find wild ones...  i got my from my uncle.. Who lives by a forest... and he went out there and found 2 turtles|`|V0gURNwaaa	Personally, I prefer a dog, but they needs lot's of love and attention.

TSQxwlbraa	My guinea pig does that sometimes with his mouth i dont know what its caused from maybe shes hungry?|`|xNkmK0SHaa	I apologize in advance.  I just couldn't resist sending this memo that Microsoft issued a few years ago:    The Care of Mouse Balls      Abstract:  Mouse Balls Available as FRU {Field Replacement Unit}    Mouse ball are now available for FRU.  Therefore, if a mouse fails to operate or should it perform   erratically, it may need a ball replacement.  Because of the delicate nature of the procedure, replacement   of mouse balls should only be attempted by properly trained personnel.    Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining the underside of the mouse.  Domestic   balls will be larger and harder than foreign balls.  Ball removal procedures differ depending upon   manufacturer of the mouse.  Foreign balls can be replaced using the pop-off method. Domestic balls are   replaced using the twist-off method.  Mouse balls are not usually static sensitive.  However, excessive   handling can result in sudden discharge.  Upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse may be used   immediately.    It is recommended that each replacer have a pair of spare balls for maintaining optimum customer   satisfaction, and that any customer missing his balls should suspect local personnel of removing these   necessary items.    To reorder, specify one of the following:  P/N 33F8462 - Domestic Mouse Balls  P/N 33F8461 - Foreign Mouse Balls
w4DIPHf1aa	Discus have come along way...    Ask around, alot of discus's now are breed in straight up tap water and don't need the insane care and soft water they used too.    If you find these you taking out alot of work for you.    Research how discus behave, they are Diva fish    Aswell discus love top cover to feel safe..try and find fake lily pads.    And you can buy something called black water (comes in a bottle)which will add the tanins real drift wood would release to get that tea stained water they like.      good luck!!!!|`|SOxdyWQOaa	it will be fine for them|`|9y1uYUm3aa	it will be okay for them i guess
b2dffdde9d95855452a59a5a7564c914aa	That is probably too long to be away from a dog.  However, if you hire a dog walker to come a few times during the day it may work.  Dogs get lonely though.    Perhaps a cat would do better with your long hours.  Cats are more independent and do not need to be let out.      If you do not have time to train a pet, then consider contacting your local SPCA and adopting a pet.  Many pets dropped off at the SPCA are already trained.|`|ULpjTKYDaa	a mouse or rat   a rabbit?  a cat.  i wouldnt really get a dog cos it would need to go out side to the toilet every hour or so .  with a cat u can put it a litter box down for it  a fish these are nice and pleasant to look at .  a gerbal  a hamster  hope i helped .   have fun with your new pet|`|ZUAFl3toaa	I suggest two cats. If you get one it's going to be lonely and bored while you're gone, but it can still take care of itself. All they need is a bowl of food in the morning and evening, clean water, and a clean litterbox. If you get two kittens, especially if they are related, they will play and get along great and never get lonely.. but when you're there, as long as you raise them nicely, they will love you and spend time with you. I have one cat and I got it for the exact same reason.. didn't like being alone but didn't want a roomate.. and i wish i would have got a second one when she was a kitten so they would be sure to get along.. I feel bad when I am gone all day because she meows and I'm sure she is very bored.    Cats are amazing companions if you get them as kittens and spend as much time as possible loving on them. My kitty is like a little puppy, she's always on my lap and she's so sweet. Getting here was the best thing I've ever done :)|`|0QbAiQwhaa	a cat is pretty good, although maybe the first week or so you should be with so it knows its owner and surroundings, if not then it may just run away.

4930be4dc4ebb348ee60d181d64e86c0aa	yeah saltwater tanks are expensive... between the salt for water changes, to the corals, live rock, to the fish themselves, a $12-16 heater should be the least of your worries.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	If you set up a saltwater tank and cant afford a heater, something is wrong. Its not that hard. A saltwater setup will cost you quite a bit, and a heater ranges from 10-40 dollars.    You dont make water warm without a heater. Everything saltwater is very sensitive, and any fluctuations will kill everything in the tank.    Wait until you can afford the heater, or take the tank down and take it back to the store. This was not though out. You cant make very many mistakes when keeping saltwater fish, and if you are going to act like this the entire time, you will just be wasting money and killing the fish and animals.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Not trying to be rude, but if you cant afford a simple heater you certainly cant afford to maintain a tropical maine aquarium.    Ian|`|gHKJmygoaa	There isn't really a good way to do this without a heater but you could try a few smaller reptilian heating lamps, however if you already have a hood with lighting then this isn't an option.

TmUQbODJaa	Usually, mollies show signs of labour for an 40 min and then give birth. However, if your molly loses control of her fins, then you must see a professional fish vet.  If she can't seem to get it out for an hour, then you may have to take your net, place the fabric against your hand and squeeze her belly.  I highly doubt you will lose your molly. You may want to provide her with part of a leafy plant in your aquarium for shelter.   Please don't be disappointed if there is a miscarriage. There is a good chance of it.  Good Luck!
XflZjhaXaa	If ferrets are legal in your state, they're great pets. They like to roam free but you can cage them when you need to.|`|WebaFPgsaa	I would suggest a bunny. They make great pets! I had a neighbour with a bunny that would actually go outside and roam around and would come back whenever they called it. It would also go inside the house too.

Rats make wonderful pets.  They are very very smart, and social. You can train them to do tricks. And rarely bite. I currently own 2 rats right now, my 3rd rat passed away last week. None of them have ever bitten me.  Rats are attention seekers, they love to interact with each other, with people and with other family pets. They are self aware, and will not put themselves in a dangerous situation. You can leave them out of their cage and allow them to roam about, once they have become accustom to you, and your home. You still have to keep an eye on them to make sure they do not get lost, and you can train them to come when you call their name. They also love shoulder rides.
3n60UxgQaa	Depends, what kind of fish are you thinking of?    For goldfish, about two at most.    For small community fish, I'd say you could fit around 25-30 depending on what kind.|`|beE1nFA6aa	If that were true, Dean, you could have a pacu in a one gallon tank. For the record, pacu grow to be three feet long and a couple hundred pounds.      It really does depend on what you like. Fancy goldfish could go in, but only three at maximum. Cichlids are nice, but it's been so long since I've kept them that I don't really know their temperments anymore. Guppies, mollies, and platies get along well; you could do about twenty of them, mix and match as you please. Don't put a pleco in unless it's a dwarf pleco; they get much too large for a 30-gallon. You could keep two gouramis in the tank, preferably one male and one female. Pictus catfish are always a brilliant edition to any freshwater aquarium.|`|7b697433fd2c46f52e6e48a08ab42b1faa	it all depends on the types of fish. can you give us more info? do you want cold water? tropical? community or aggressive? salt water or fresh?    i'd be happy to answer once i know more|`|daJundOjaa	One Inch of fish (excluding tail) per gallon.

veDvtYhJaa	Talk to your parents about getting a dog when you move.  Hopefully they will say yes.  If so, then the yard, or part of it, must be fenced to keep the dog safely at your property.        You could ask your father why he didn't get  you a dog a year ago when he said he would.  There is the possibility that your parents have other reasons to not get a dog that they have not told you.  Also, since they pay the bills, it's their right to say no.  You may have to wait till you're old enough to move out on your own.     Even if they don't get you a dog, you can have the enjoyment of dogs by training other people's dogs.  If you do this, you should charge for your services, and save the money to care for a dog when you do get one.  Good Luck -!-|`|gwUMipsUaa	If your mom hates animals, it's best to wait until you are moved out and can support one.

NUMBER 3; DON'T BUY FROM  A PETSTORE, BACKYARD BREEDER,PUPPY MILL, OR NEWSPAPER CLASSIFIED    Number 4; DOGS aren't cheap.    Number 5;Golden retrievers are medium to large dogs. They have long golden hair and are good at retrieving things. This was no accident; golden retrievers were bred to be good at retrieving things. Hunters used dogs extensively for pointing out game for hunting as well as retrieving game once theyd killed or injured it. This was the job of the golden retriever. Today, golden retrievers are more commonly kept as family pets than they are for hunting. The Golden retriever is known for being a very high spirits, good-humoured dog. Golden retrievers get along very well with children and are loyal companions. A golden retriever also gets along fine with strangers but can become protective of their owner if they think they are in danger. Golden retrievers are fairly big dogs and need a lot of space to run around, so they tend not to do as well in apartments.    A large breed that can be good for apartments is a Greyhound!  http://www.greyhoundsunlimited.org/adopt...|`|GfphOIdOaa	you go to father and say he promise. why he no give you dog.|`|AA10269450	Tell your parents that if you can't have a dog you are going to look for a boyfriend/girlfriend.

a925a8f202675cec3997dc4ebbf993fdaa	Well Hip problems are common but not necessarily the problem as in an inherited problem with your dog.  Any dog can get arthritis in the hips and elbows.  Hip Dysplasia is an inherited disease and often shows up in young puppies from apx. 6 months of age to 1 year.  In Australia dogs are tested at 12 months of age.  If they are clear at that age then HD is ruled out and they are ok to breed.  Labs have a breed average of 12.5  if they are scored under that then they are ok.    All Labs regardless of color are prone to HD.  All breeding stock must be tested if you want to register the pups in Australia.    I would suspect ED (elbow dysplasia), with the symptoms you describe which is also a genetically inherited disease of Labs, but with an older dog it could just be plain arthritis.      Genetically inherited diseases are a problem in puppies and dogs under the age of 2 years.  This is the age the symptoms of the disease normally occur.  Dogs over the age of 6 could just have arthritic conditions the same as us humans get old.  Doesn't mean it was genetically inherited.|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	Labrador Retreivers are prone to hip & elbow dysplasai, especially in those that haven't come from responsible breeders who do OFA/PennHip on hips/elbows.    Have your son take the dog into the vet for x-rays on hips.    *****Labs are Labs..yellow, chocolate & black are only colors that Labs come in**********|`|C1eHfhrHaa	yes- labs are definitely prone to hip displaysia.  I recommend acupuncture for long term pain management.|`|zZZnQuQJaa	Hip Displasia is a common problem in Labs, as is arthritis when they're older.  Your son needs to have the dog checked by a Vet, who can properly diagnose what's going on.|`|cie3oBcXaa	This website might be useful for you..    http://www.labradorforums.co.uk/hips.htm...|`|d8fSVX23aa	Yes because of people breeding their labs without checking hips first and just putting the money in breeding before good breeding practice giving good lab breeders a bad name.|`|7c000cf444eb1024a5936f1c7f912a15aa	Yes it is a common problem with all Labs as well as many larger breeds. Most of your good breeders are now testing for it and trying to breed it out of their lines. There are many good supplements for joints taht your son should consider to help his dog. My Lab has done really with Cetyl M ( need to buy it on line) and also a new one called GLC 1000 also you can buy on line. GLC 1000 is running a great promotion where you can try their product for free by going to their website and clicking on the sample product under canine. www.GLCDirect.com and Cetyl M is great for pain not sure on their website I usually do a general search and find several websites and pick the best priced site.|`|FdcWPp48aa	This is a common problem, the dog could use a visit to the vet.  Pain management could keep the dog from suffering.
veDvtYhJaa	You need to talk to an animal behaviorist to understand what's going on and how to deal with it.  If you don't do that, you'll end up having to put her down.  It's obvious from the answers you got that the brain dead have been out of the cemetary and answering questions at YA, so go get your answers from someone who knows what they are talking about.      I find your description of her confusing so it's hard to give advice.  But with an animal that can be dangerous, you need the help of an expert. -!-|`|gwUMipsUaa	Sounds like you and she would benefit from obedience training possibly with a trainer that specializes in Pit Bulls(or Staffies).    Do not let her off the leash at any time, except in a fenced in area.  This is the law in the United States.  Every state has this law.  Also, are you running this dog several times a day and tiring her out several times a day?  If not, start doing that.|`|iVQULHqYaa	There is never a right way to show  aggression.   Is it possible that someone in the family is winding her up?. Does she get enough exercise?. Are you leaving your dog alone whilst you go to work?.    None of the above is criticism, I am just wondering what the problem is and what the solution is.     You can excuse her for biting into the road cone because she would not know that your brother hand was inside this.    Going to obedience classes and keeping her occupied with "play training" could help however you must practise every day. Again I don't mean to be critical, however if this is your first dog perhaps you do not understand dogs.    If none of the above applies, think about this. There are thousands of people who are born with mental problems and they live their lives in mental homes. People suffer from schizophrenia and they live their lives in total confusion. I am convinced that dogs and all animals suffer from inherent mental problems, I hope that this is not the problem with your dog.    I have had dogs for over forty years, then I got Sam who was a nut case. Sam appeared to love my friends, however I knew that he had an iffy temperiment. Then one night I had a visitor who Sam had been prevously been very friendly with. Sam lay on his back, feet in the air and wanted his tummy tickled, my friend bent down to tickle Sam's tummy and he went for my friends throut. If this has been a one off problem I could have coped with this. Unfortunately Sam had shown aggression on several ocassions and there was no way that I could trust him with children. With great regret I had Sam PTS. When I was at the vets for Sam's final visit the vet expressed his concern, he thought that Sam was a security dog and said that had he realised that he was a house pet that he would have advised that he should have been PTS earlier.    Think about this and consult a behaviorist. Perhaps your dog has a mental problem, obviosly  if he has you cannot keep him and he cannot be rehomed.  Sorry my "spell check" has died again and I am a hopeless speller.|`|f1kRtbMAaa	Sounds like you need to get her to a trainer who can show you how to control and teach your dog good manners.If you cannot do this place her with a rescue and they will evaluate her and see what can be done to train and then re home.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	First take your dog to the vet to rule out any underlying medical condition which may be responsible for her erratic behaviour.     I had a Dobermann whose behaviour became increasingly erratic over time & bit a member of the family on two occasions. After the first bite he was taken to a canine behaviourist, after the second for a thorough examination with a vet. He was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour which was responsible for his erratic behaviour.    An untreated underactive thyroid can also make a dog more prone to be irritable.    If your dog is healthy then find an experienced professional dog trainer to assess your dog & advise you on what your options are. Until you have seen a dog trainer, I would adviser that you err on the side of caution & purchase a securely fitted muzzle & keep her on a lead when exercising outside.    If you have visitors to your home, put her in a crate keep her on a house lead.    I hope you can work through the problems you are having with your Staff cross.|`|AA11097657	Staffies do hang on to things in a frenzied way. I have never met one that doesn't!    At my local park they hang on to trees and even tyres in the children's play area.    It is a very silly thing to teach them to hang on in an aggressive way to anything. If they are being kept as pets they should never be encouraged to play in this way. You have reared this dog with no knowledge of the breed and have not set proper rules.    Your brother should not play with cones in this way. Your dog did not know his hand was inside.    I think this is a classic case of a dog in wrong hands. She is obviously pack leader that's why she nips you when you correct her.  Get some professional advice on how to train and handle this dog, although I don't think there is much hope for you now.  I think it is a terrible trained accident waiting to happen.  I hope it isn't a child when it does happen.|`|FewhKlx9aa	This could be a neurological issue or could have a brain tumor..You need to see the vet over this so he can take test as this dog sounds unpredictable..I would ask though why your brother would do this to the dog (tease him) and then mistakeingly bite him,not the dogs fault..But if your brother has been so called playing this way with your dog he created this dog to be aggressive..That is sad as this could of been a great dog and just does'nt know any better now..What he was taught he thinks is normal..Stop the behavior of mean play,call the vet and get him checked out and watch out around kids|`|iBxb6lJlaa	wow, that's pathetic.

Sorry to hear about your problem.  I would advise having a talk with your Vet about the issue and see if there are any good trainers in your area.  It also may be a good idea to get her a muzzle for when you bring her out on a leash just in case she does hurt someone.  Good luck, I hope your issue is resolved soon.  :-)|`|fjkRIUSnaa	i would try obedience training at your local pet store. I would also take her to the vert to see if maybe he or sche can do blood work maybe she has some sort of chemical imbalance.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	If shes not desexed, desex her. Go back to basic training sit, stay, drop with food rewards. If she starts nipping people tell her 'No!' short and sharp and take her out of the room, keep doing it until she stops and gets bored with the nipping because she gets no attention from it. Get visitors to turn their back on her, dont look at her and have their arms crossed, she has nothing to nip at and will also get bored.. Must remember to always reward her with good behaviour either food such as chicken and a 'Good girl!' remark.   When you walk her, if she starts getting vicious with something, turn around and walk back the way you came. Once she settles into a calm rhythym turn around and start walking back the way you were headed, if she starts the viciousness again, turn around and walk away. Keep repeating it until she gets the hint that until she stops with the attacking she won't be allowed near it. She should soon learn that attacking things wont get her anywhere.  Also try and get a head harness that goes around her snout and the back of her head (leading pet stores should sell them, they can be abit expensive but that comes with size, so i guess if you want her undercontrol you'll pay the dosh lol), so when she pulls when walking, her head turns back around to you. You'll start getting more control and a more relaxed dog.   Dont kill her like others have said! If you dont start teaching her straight away right now, you'll never get control again and she may well have to be put down. It takes time and effort but if you want to keep her, than you're gunna have to do the hardyards. If that doesnt work, find a professional in doggy behaviour and get advice.|`|8piMa0ARaa	No offense but I think she sounds a little bit mad!, I would have her put down before you regreat it!, it could even kill a child and you would have that on your consonce for the rest of your life!.|`|PyvLRYKGaa	it could be it is teething just buy thing for it to chew on|`|c74aca35559d33687415f5d474888634aa	some of the other answerer's are horrible, our dog can be vicious towards other dogs, I'd have a talk with your vet as they may be able to guide you, they won't put her down unless she seriously hurt another human being.  Good Luck.|`|pXPdO2I8aa	Get her put to sleep before she does something worse.  She may have a brain tumour.|`|u1gLTZYIaa	Go to a dog behaviour expert and get some help on how to train her out of this bad behaviour. you need to put in the time and effort before she really hurts someone. I don't beleive you should have the dog put to sleep. you need to try everything you can possibly try to put it right!|`|Smj8rZalaa	Hi! Jane R has given a nice answer . Bring a muzzle . Others answers are also good , show it to a vet , behaviorist or a trainer . Try to make your dog understand in a polite manner.|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	Firstly, don't take her to obedience or training classes yet. She is an antisocial dog and taking her around other dogs or people can be dangerous for them, you and her. You should not put any dog that has aggression issues in a situation of stress and being surrounded by other dogs and people will put stress on her and could create a reaction.    For now, always have her on a lead when you are outside or when you have people in the house with you and I would strongly advise that you use a muzzle to both protect yourself and others, but also to not allow another bite.    There are ways of dealing with this, but I would not instruct you in any of them online or over the phone. When a dog has bitten, you need to be very careful. You need to find a behavior therapist that will come into your home and work with you and the dog to assess how it is currently being handled/fulfilled and show you how to correct the behavior. Using force with these dogs is not an option....they will bite back so this has to be handled very carefully by a professional.    I would suggest a trip to your vet for a thorough examination to make sure there are no underlying health problems and ask them to refer you to a behavior therapist.    Good luck and don't try to sort this out on your own.|`|4meygQXFaa	hi, she is still not fully grown and she still maybe teething or she prob thibks its a game! and it maybe an idea to put her into training classes so you can get control and understand her a little more!  but theres no need to put her down it sometimes just takes a while..if your worried when outside get her a muzzle or something but take it off as soon as poss!!  good luck|`|AA12083992	Before you do something as final as having her killed, try obedience classes geared for aggressive dogs. Also a dog behaviorist could be of great help. I keep telling people bully's are not for inexperienced trainers. They need a firm, confident trainer/handler that has experience with positive but tough training. You can not let these dogs get the upper hand, they very much want to be the boss and will be if they have trainers that do not know what they are doing. Get her into the classes for aggressive dogs and hope that is enough. They can teach you a lot about handling her.  You may have to re-home her to a home without kids or turn her over to a bully breed rescue so they can evaluate & re-home her. I am not against bullies, I am against inexperienced people getting them. Get the professional help you need and good luck.    Edit: BTW, obedience training at your local pet store is NOT the kind of training this dog needs. They are good for friendly social dogs, not dogs with problems.|`|P3vZh1ajaa	contact a staff breeder with your concerns, it may be that she is being handled in the wrong way (dont mean it nasty) and a good breeder or trainer may well be able to shed some light on her behaviour, doesnt sound too good, but worth a try for your pet, juat keep her away from other ppl for now untill you decide what to do.    remember staffs ARE NOT naturally agressive towards people, very good family dogs, its usually other dogs they have a problem with, but you must do what right as if she seriously hurt a person........that one ince closer to a ban against staffs too, so also think about the breed as a whole, if your dog is a danger, put her down if just to help save to breed xxxx|`|B8k2BJc8aa	Hi, First thing I've got to ask is are you afraid of your dog? If you are then there is no way you can control it and you should get professional help. The only alternative is a one way ticket to the vet for your staffie. Hope it all works out for you both.
P3WPiEVPaa	I think any dog should be walked for at least 30 minutes a day to get the proper exercise they need, As for more than that I would say it all depends on your dog's energy level. If she still seems to have plenty of energy and is enjoying it then I would go ahead and do more than what you are. If she seems like she is getting tired after your 40 minute walks then I'm sure it's enough.|`|4aN8AwmRaa	How is her energy level?  If she is tired after walking her for 40 minutes, then that is enough.  If she is still raring to go then walk her longer.|`|e12bf810e79d242a64e4502e588dc9ecaa	30-40 minutes
be025e8eec4977bf6cdb9fb6f0765797aa	Sometimes after female dogs get spayed their oestrogen/estrogen levels change-which can cause a weak bladder. My dog has this problem. Does your dog urinate whilst asleep or unaware of her actions? If this continues even though you're keeping up the training, don't be angry with her. Simply take her to the vet and they can prescribe some oestrogen tablets for her which she may have to take for the rest of her life, but which clear up the problem.|`|gwUMipsUaa	You really should call your vet when they open up.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Did she just get home or was this done months ago..If she just came home you need to take her out as it hurts to walk and she should'nt be moving around to much as she can break her inside/outside stitces..You would have to pick her up and put her in her spot and carry her back in..If this was done months ago there could be a problem with incontinence which can happen..The med for that is Proin and works great|`|zZZnQuQJaa	You need to have her seen by the Vet again - Spay Incontinence is a problem that happens to a small percentage of bitches after spaying and is something that can be treated with either medication or in some cases, a surgical procedure.|`|Fu0Wk7ZYaa	No, the truma of the surgery ma have weakened thebladder ,and probally will be okay after healing. you will have to support your pet my making sure after feeding you wait alittle while and take her to the normal potty area.|`|XagPxe7Faa	That is actually a pretty common after a spay.  You will just have to continue to reinforce her training until she getst the hang of it again.|`|nTSsZRD5aa	is just a normal thing. Don't need to get too worried about it. The same happened with my chocolate lab, Cocoa, When he was a little puppy. He peed on my friend at my birthday party, a horrible day i will never forget.  After a few days, he barked to go outside to use the bathroom. Just wait a few days to a week.
veDvtYhJaa	I agree with cuddles.  Puppies will play till they get tired of it.  They may play a few minutes, or maybe half an hour, or they may play awhile and then ignore the other dog, and go off on their own, then come back to play again.  When they are tired, they'll just lie down and go to sleep.    I don't think you have to select any time limit and say "ok, it's an hour (or whatever the limit is) and so play time is over"  That's just foolish.  Puppies are growing and so they sleep a lot.  You don't have to limit their play time; the pup will limit its own play time.    when your pup was with its litter mates, it would play a while, then sleep a while, then scrounge around a bit, then maybe play a bit... there was no artificial time limit put on it's play time with its litter mates, so it's not logical to put a time limit on it now.    stress them out?  phooey... that's a crock -!-|`|gwUMipsUaa	Just depends on the puppy.  However, it should not socialize with most dogs until it's had all it's shots.  Also be sure and ask the vet for the bordatella vaccination.  I don't know about all vets, but many will only give it if you specifically request it.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	I take it your pup stated its initial vaccinations at 7 weeks old to be finished by 11 weeks old? If your pup hasn't finished its injections then don't take it outside at it's still not fully protected.    Young pups energy comes in bursts, followed by a sleep to recuperate. At less than three months old your pups needs just 15 minutes lead exercise, with the rest of the time spent playing in the garden.    Until your pup has a solid recall, keep it on a lead to socialise as it makes it so much easier to control & correct your pup.    {In addition many adult dog do not appreciate an exuberant young pup bouncing round or on them}|`|CPxmHjx4aa	ive never heard of it stressing a puppy out...puppies will play until they get tired..  i personally dont think there is a limit on play time for puppies|`|NDHiLwaLaa	In my opinion, that is not true. Mainly because dogs even that young still need to be socialized VERY early. Make sure you socialize your puppy with people, strangers, other dogs, introduce him to new sights and sounds etc. I really don't think that would stress your puppy out. (:|`|vPde97E2aa	"...Someone told you..." BULL.    Why do you imagine you need to expose a pup to disease,parasites & fights at all?    Sure wish I could figure out WHY "socialize"=meaning EXPOSE & TRAIN in new situations!!!= came to be doggy-tea-parties to the silly "pet-people".|`|BTCDviR1aa	The issue is not stress its more fatigue and behaviour.     At this age your puppy should be socialised with as many different dogs as possible (as well as all other aspects of socialisation)      The puppy also needs lots of rest and the socialisation should be controlled to ensure that unwanted social behaviour is corrected.|`|Fu0Wk7ZYaa	Depending on the size of your pet and the pets it is playing with,small dogs tend to try to keep up with largr dogs,and well they tirer like small children do with older siblings. So, monitored ply time seems to be goo d!|`|4meygQXFaa	hi,  havent heard if stressing them out before..i think its more like them get tired but at that age its usually about an hour or 2 of playing anyway..  enjoy|`|4aN8AwmRaa	Eleven weeks is a little young to be in the outside world to play with other dogs unless they have had their second set of vaccines.  Parvo is carried around on the paws of dogs and people and your puppy could contact it if not immune.      Socializing your puppy with other dogs is very important. They learn skills from other dogs that we humans can't teach them.  Other dogs teach ours how to get along and behave like a dog and teach communication skills. Your puppy will let you know if he has had enough of socializing and playing by seeking out a quiet place to lay down.  It is important to control the other dog or dogs so that they do not bother him when he is trying to rest.|`|P3WPiEVPaa	Whoever told you that doesn't know what they are talking about. It will not stress them out, but rather give them an outlet for all of their energy. Socializing your puppy is great because it teaches them to not be aggressive around other animals when it is older. I have a 5 month old Great Dane and two other dogs, and we try to socialize our puppy as much as possible. Not only with animals but with people. If you puppy is a large breed like mine than I recommend you do the same, because the last thing you want is a giant dog that is overpowering, also a lot of people are scared of large dogs.    Small dogs can be aggressive as well. The only thing I can think of as to why someone had told you that, is because of shots or other diseases. Which, still I don't see a huge problem. A dog usually doesn't get a rabies shot until it is about 6 months old. Our dog has all of his boosters/puppy series shots so he is okay. Also Bordatella, which is basically Kennel Cough is a good one to have.    Oh! and it also depends on the size of your dog as well how much romping around they can do. Our vet told us that because our dog is growing at such a rapid rate that his amount of running and jumping should be limited because he can fracture a bone or hurt his joints.    Hope this helps!|`|hdD7YcCqaa	It depends on the color of the dog.    the longer it socializes. the more the chance it has to GET SOME|`|Z64mYPOlaa	my puppy went to a puppy party at the vets it lasted about an hour the puppy party was once a week|`|DALXDovmaa	Puppies are like babies, when they are tired they are going to rest. Just like adult dogs, when they are tired and don't want to chase the ball anymore they won't. I have a corgi puppy that is 9 weeks old and she is outside all day with other small dogs and big dogs. when it is sleep time she sleeps and then when she is ready to play again she does. the advice you received makes no since at all. Regardless or the size or breed of your puppy, it is not like they run on batteries and there is a switch to turn them off and on. When the puppy is tired it is not going to play anymore if it is exposed to dogs 24/7. Therefore taking your puppy to the doggie park or even the neighbors to play for 1 hour or 5 hours is not going to make or break your puppy.
f71bc553ce48de0d47d00ce15fd871aaaa	there was a report issued a couple years ago that said they may in fact not feel pain, something about the Design of their central nervous system showed that they do not have the part that registers pain, now that said you can read one report that says coffee will kill you and another that says coffee might actually help you live longer so who knows      i have also read the opinion of some very devout fish lovers that say even fish don't feel pain, one of the cases that helped him come to this conclusion what that one day while fishing a fish had swallowed a hook, with the hook lodged in its stomach he preceded to catch this same fish 3 more times that day, he has also preformed surgery (successfully) on his pet fish with no anesthetic to cure a few different ailments and hasn't noticed any pain or suffering in them|`|FYjf7hkEaa	Its not a stupid question. Yes, they do suffer an agonising death.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Of course it hurts them.  If you were thrown in boiling water alive it would hurt you too until you eventually die.|`|CPxmHjx4aa	they suffer a little...like crabs a lobster will try to get out of a pot of steaming hot water..  one time i had them actually climb out and onto the floor..  now i only buy steamed ones from the store..|`|MJW7Etk3aa	yes it does if they didnt they wouldnt live long and would let prey eat them. thats why they move there tail in and out because its burning them to death. it would be boiling to death and would take much longer than cuttin its head off|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	It's reasonable to think it hurts them to be dropped in boiling water, but they do die quite quickly after that, so they don't suffer for long.  When it comes to killing animals, speed equals mercy.  I'm not convinced that being frozen alive is more pleasant than being boiled alive. In that freezing takes longer, it may be worse.|`|OKPFeBtYaa	So you'll only eat animals that don't suffer before they die.  Unless they're really stupid, and they don't understand.  Unlike chickens who can sense their impending death.  Ever thought of tofu?  Plenty of protein, no one dies.|`|gPLrg6EKaa	i personaly think it is cruel to dump them in a pot of boiling water. it is more humane to put them in the freezer first and they will go to sleep!|`|6KsGSDh5aa	It's an instant death and I highly doubt they feel a thing.  The sqeeking noise they make is not actually coming from the lobster but from the air being pushed out from under their shell.
NMi1AZbqaa	I have a budgie just like that, it's really sad cause he's my first and I did everything I could.    I hung out with him for like an hour a day just patting him and talking to him and stuff and then all of a sudden he wouldn't let me pat him anymore and started to bite when ever I put my hand in the cage.    The only advise I would have is to not purchase budgies from pet shops because they don't handle them at all or anything and budgies that are aviary raised are usually tamer and nicer :D|`|vMByDy1raa	If a bird has been mistreated in the pass it is much harder to tame the bird.  You didn't mention if he was had fed, caught in the wild, or previous own bird.  An hour a day isn't much time to work with a bird.  Most people say work 10-15 minutes at a time for 4 to 5 times a day.  You may have to get him use to stepping up on a stick not your finger then gradually use your finger.  My daughter smokes, only outside but none of our birds like her.  I think It the residue of smoke on her hands.  Make sure you take the budgie from room to room with you so he knows you and thinks your the leader of his flock.|`|CPxmHjx4aa	it takes time and patients..my mother had one "Cutie" that she let fly around the house, landed on your finger when you called and gave kisses..  you have to b consistent and very patient with them..in time it will tame down..
SOxdyWQOaa	sorry,the ich possibly, your betta is ok now
AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,    As a former Russian Blue breeder, I would have to suggest a Maine Coon as a friend for your Ragdoll. I never found my Russkies to be "laid back" at all.  Quite affectionate at home, they can be quite "snarky" at cat shows, so they do have that tendency to be slightly more aggressive at times. I love the breed for their intelligence and beauty, but as far as "mellow" the Maine Coon, in my experience is more well known for being laid back.    The Russian Blue is a more "active" cat than the Maine Coon. I suspect that most of the Longhairs are that way, as many folks refer to them as "furry doorstops". This being said, each cat of course is unique and the breed profiles only give the general description and every cat in that breed may not behave in the manner the descriptions suggest.    After some lengthy discussions with Maine Coon breeders, recently, the overwhelming majority describe their cats as mellow and laid back, more so than short hair breeds.    This being said, you would do best to visit breeders of both these cats, and observe the adults and kittens. I am sure that you will find this to be a much more realistic way to evaluate a potential kitten that you will be bringing into your home.    Good luck on finding just the right cat to be a companion to your mellow Ragdoll.

I have 2 raggies (sisters from same litter, bought at the same time) and theyre friggin AWFUL with any other cats. We tried to catsit a friends cat, who is the fattest most docile creature ever and they went mental. Id stick with just keeping you existing cat and giving them all your love. I dont get why people get bored of their cats and have to get another one to give their attention to!!|`|9kdUmttPaa	I would go with a Maine Coon. Russian Blues can turn on you.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	They both ARE laid back and either would be fine with your Ragdoll.  It depends more if you want to groom 2 longhair cats every day (or at least 2-3 times a week).  Or do you want one longhair and one shorthair.
kWwgWSSgaa	I would not hazard a guess as to what may be causing blood loss online, but I would urge you to take you dog for an emergency appointment with your local vet.    If she does need to be put to sleep, it's better for your dog that it is done sooner rather than later.|`|2G8lOPN8aa	I'm afraid so.  Poor girl.  My heart goes out to you.  But if she is waking you up because she is in pain--she is telling you... and the crate full of blood and clots is definitely not good.  Definitely bring her into the vet--she should certainly be looked at one way or another--but I understand you need to prepare yourself for the likelihood that it is time to have her euthanized.    My Sheltie girl died on December 1st--she was 13.... and I just knew it was her time... I had actually called to make her an appointment for 5 that evening to have her euthanized because I knew it was her time... but I wanted my husband to go with me--I couldn't bear to do it alone... I stayed with her all afternoon and just before 3PM she breathed her last as I was petting her... (Fortunately JUST before my children came home from school).      It's hard to make this decision for a pet that you love like family--but it is the obligation of every responsible pet owner to not let them suffer unecessarily.   Just make sure you are with her when she is put to sleep--she will be more calm and comfortable under your loving care.    I'm sorry you are going through this--I know just how heartbreaking and difficult it is.    ((HUGS))|`|bIaywrBCaa	I think you have the answer. It is time to let her go. She is suffering. I am so sorry. It is so hard to say goodbye to a dear friend.|`|77NzfiVkaa	If she is in pain then yes, I'm sorry but the time has arrived. I'm really sorry, I know this is hard. Good luck.|`|vPde97E2aa	Why've you delayed it this long?|`|FewhKlx9aa	I think you answered your own question and I'm sure when you read this you probably were already told it is time to put this poor thing to sleep.He is suffering and I could'nt imagine the site you describe.|`|ZTCspx5saa	I am so sorry. I know how you feel. just ask the vet|`|FdcWPp48aa	What is the blood from?  Doesn't sound good for your old friend.  She could go on for some time if you were to get her pain medications to manage the pain.  Otherwise, it's probably time to let her go.  Sorry.|`|FkVMOTZtaa	I would say yes its time, the poor dog is clearly in pain.|`|5IcNNkkuaa	If the dog is in pain, then yes it would probably be a good idea. 14 is a good old ripe age for a papillion, and you obviously took care of her very well for her to reach it this far in life.    Ultimately, its your decision, but don't feel guilty for it, I'm sure your dog would be happier without the pain. Good luck, it's never easy loosing your best friend.|`|4aN8AwmRaa	I am sorry to her about your puppy.  The loss of a dog is very traumatic, I feel your pain and I wish you all the luck in the world.      It is time...when your pets quality of life goes down.  She is not happy, is likely stressed and in pain.  Please don't prolong her suffering.  I am sure she has given you many years of unending companionship, it's time to do for her.|`|Fu0Wk7ZYaa	Going to your vet is probaly a great  idea,your dog is like your child blood is never a normal thing. Good luck because losing a longtime friend is so hard|`|c2YcBbXyaa	i'm so sorry for your dog....it's probably time to let her go|`|p9Z6WnGFaa	Yes, If she is in that much pain, it is the best idea. I am very sorry for your loss, she has lived to a good age though!!  x|`|QZUlaMrfaa	i think it would be best since she/he is in pain|`|uicbw4Eeaa	i hate to say it but sounds like u need to put her to sleep|`|zWFJBlJZaa	Dear Donna,    I know this is hard as I have been through it many times, but it is time to be self-less and do what is right for your girl.  She has lived a good long (98 human years) life and she is ill and tired and in pain.    Allow her the dignity of  restful sleep.    Although it isn't easy, I am always happy to say that all my best friends have gone to sleep in my arms when their time had come.  The very last words they heard, was my voice telling them how much I loved them and how thankful I was that they were in my life and the last thing they felt was my loving arms when they closed their eyes for the last time on this earth.    And don't forget to tell her you'll be with her again on the other side --(she'll be waiting for you)!
fb8a814c78b9ea803ce553353913cea0aa	Either put the toilet paper on backwards so that it doesn't roll forward or keep the bathroom door closed.    At the pet store (and some dollar stores) they have these neat cardboard scratcher things that you place on the floor near your furniture.  They are relatively cheap.  The ones I found at a dollar store were only $4.00.  They come with catnip and you sprinkle the catnip on the cardboard and it encourages them to scratch it.  The key to them NOT scratching the furniture is to make something more enticing nearby.   There's also double-sided sticky tape that you can put on the edges of the furniture where they are prone to scratch.  If you have leather chairs, then that won't work, but you might want to keep it covered for awhile till they are trained to the scratching post or the scratching pad I mentioned.    I had a very active/aggressive cat once.  Those soft claws didn't work because I thought he would kill me before I could get them on.  Plus they didn't stay on for very long because the claws are like fingernails and grow a little each day.  It just depends on the cat, but they aren't cheap and it's better to just catch the cat when he's calm and trim them yourself.      My mom found a lady who would come to her house and trim the cats claws for her for $10.00.  Ask the vet if they know someone who would be willing to do this - - - maybe a pet groomer or something.    As far as shedding goes and the carpet - - - well, you'll just have to vacuum every other day.  Or buy one of those Shark carpet sweepers that will sweep up hair and stuff off the carpet.      If you want to keep your cats, show your mom you are willing to do whatever is necessary.  If she sees you are making real effort without having to be reminded, then she will probably calm down.|`|AA10091923	try a scratching post and if they are still scratching the furiniture, put some pennies in a can (with a top on it) and shake it when they do the scratching on the furniture...they will soon associate the negative loud noise with no scratching.    tips on cleaning up...just make sure you do the cleaning.  I have found a hand held vac works wonders for quick pick ups like fur, carpet etc.    Also, please do not get your cats declawed.  declawing is not taking the claws out...it is an amputation from the first knuckle down through the claw....so look at your hand and look at your first knuckle....they would cut that plus all the way to the nail.  I made the mistake of doing this with my cats and will never endorse the procedure again.  It actually did not work well on my female cat...they did not get all of the nail bed and the nail gre back...THROUGH HER PAW!  It was painful for her and me - and she had to have another surgery to correct it.    So, training is the best advice I can lend to you.    good luck  :)|`|AXAyuFW8aa	You could get their claws taken out. I, though , thought it was very dreadful watching my cat recover. But, you may think different. Or, you could keep the kittens locked up in their special room. I think the second is best. But, it's your choice. Best of luck!|`|cCNj40fEaa	yes!! they need toys and a scratching post for sure!!!  there are some big scratching posts that look like castles and cats love hanging out on them    also here are some articles on cat's behavior    http://cats.about.com/lr/cat_clawing_fur...    you'll need to read a lot, but i think is worth it so you can keep your fury friends!!    on cleaning tips, go to a PetSmart, they have  a whole section on the cat area for cleaning rugs from cat pee and other stuff... also you can buy them many cheap toys there, you can even make some toys yourself with old socks and garments    also, give them wet canned food, it's better for cats than dry food and it seems to keep them less neurotic too!    and if somebody say to you to de-claw your cats do NOT do it!! if your cat gets lost or need to defend himself without claws he's pretty much defenseless, I think is INHUMANE to de-claw cats!!! it's like taking your nails and fingers OFF!!! so do NOT do that!!    good luck and truly hope you don't have to get rid of your cats!! tell your mom to help you train them and give them a good life :))|`|hNRF5agXaa	my kitten was like that and  i have this cat book and it said you can cut their claws down with clippers and she doesn't do any of that anymore|`|nzgZR6onaa	The only way you will have any peace and sanity is to get rid of them.But I know you love them so I feel for you.If they are kittens they will grow out of some of this.otherwise you just have to be on guard by keeping the bathroom door closed so they stay out of that room and any other room you don't want them in. They have the new pedi paw out for nail clipping and they have special grooming brushes to take off excess fur.Pets are a lot of work.They sell special keep off training spray for furniture. Good Luck!!|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Try "soft claws'.  They are tips that cover their claws and may help you out.  You have to replace them as they wear down and they will still need scratching posts/pads but the ripping of things may drastically be reduced.|`|djeTYZtoaa	you could get them a scratching post and leave food around it so they scratch that instead of furniture. also you should get them plenty of toys to keep them ammused.|`|7nPNlVrzaa	well, you could get them de-clawed.  My cat was de-clawed when we got him, and he can try to scratch the furniture all he wants, and it won't rip.  Umm, maybe you could set up a play pen sort of thing, and just put stuff that isn't too important to your mother in it, and let your cat into that.  You can but several little todler fences and connect them to make a fairly large place for you cats to play.  GOOD LUCK!! Cats are great, and I wish the best for you, Snickers and Mira.|`|e83efa1a48c094055b21fef462f4fcfaaa	I had the same problem!  Please don't declaw them, that's the worst thing you can do!  You can buy them soft paws..   Just type it into google.  They also have them at Pet Smart or Petco.  My cat doesn't mind them at all either!
rrFbQZzIaa	please don't listen to ducky S, that may be one of the top 20 worst posts I have ever seen. First if you kept your dragon at his suggested temps all day, 75-85, you'd have a dead dragon. Dragons should be kept at the very least 95F, and definitely warmer for about 12 hours a day. Second they are not nocturnal. Either my 7 dragons, and dozens upon dozens of babies are weird bearded dragons (all very active during day, sleep at night) or this person has no clue, which they obviously don't. For a reptile that heats their body through the warmth of the environment, i wonder how they would be nocturnal when nighttime temps in the desert can drop low.   Ok, so now onto some good advice. Yea, 75F is fine for a few hours. Your dragon wasn't lifting it's head most likely b/c it wasn't warm. They gain body heat externally, not internally like us, so if the cage is not warm enough, they're going to be sluggish. The UVB bulb is something that your dragon could even be fine w/out for days or weeks if it's given the right supplements so that's not a big deal. I'm sure right now your dragon is starting to perk and warm up.|`|f8t4FQZ5aa	He will be fine and will suffer no ill effects. If he normally is under UVB, basking lamp and gets calcium supplements there is no need to worry.  They are NOT nocturnalthey sleep at night not during the day so with his lights off he would likely sleep hence him being seemingly sluggish.  DO NOT use calci sand, but regular childs play sand is fine. Study a respectable care sheet before talking bad or incorrect information from here. http://www.westcoastdragons.com has a simple to understand care sheet  Good luck|`|46Mxaw13aa	yes do not listen to ducky s thats horrible advice the tank should beat least 95 with a basking spot up to 120 remember these animals are native to the australian desert.  just make sure u keep the heat up because he is a little guy and he's growing and needs the heat to gigest his food.  also at this stage they be can dehydrated easily make sure he drinks and i wouldn't worry  about not having uvb for a couple of hours he will be fine.|`|TPe7yiBYaa	75 degrees. Ideally, a dragon's habitat should be between 75-85F (although some websites will recommend temperatures than vary slightly), so though the uv lamp should be on during the day and off at night, a few hours without it won't hurt him. as for it not holding his head up, well, he was probably sleepy! bearded dragons are nocturnal and sleep during the day, so it is normal for him to be slightly sluggish. as for the uvb light, its purpose is to help your lizard produce calcium. if you are worried it is not getting enough calcium from the light, buy calcium dust at the pet store and sprinkle his food with it, or buy calcium sand for his bedding. Also, if you live somewhere warm, (75F+) you can take your bearded dragon outside for a few minutes, as long as you never let go of him. to get uvb rays from the sun.  if you are truely worried or have any more questions, call a vet, because they'll usually have somone who can help with reptiles.  for now, check out this site, it has info on housing, heating, feeding, baby beardies, etc.:  http://www.beardeddragoncare.net/    and read this too:    Behaviors -   The most endearing aspect of owning a Bearded Dragon is its interactive nature. Some of the displays you will see are almost comical...    Beard display -  This is often seen being done by male Beardies when determining a hierarchy or during breeding season. The Dragon will 'blow out' its beard by extending a bone-like structure covering flap of skin therefore giving the appearance of a beard. The color of the skin there will also change color to look almost black... We have also noticed this color change to extend down to cover the Dragons chest area. We have also seen this used as a defensive gesture when a Dragon is threatened or startled. Beards are not limited to males; the females will show off their beards as well for various reasons.    Head Bobbing -   This is a dominance display. The Dragon seems to be saying, "Who is the boss here?" It is performed quite frequently during the breeding season to gain the attention and/or submission of a female Dragon... and always when your Dragons are given new territory to conquer. (Place them on the floor in your living room.)   Arm Waving -  This is often seen being done by the females in the cage and the less 'dominant' males in response to a 'beard display' or 'bobbing episode'. This is the submissive gesture in recognition and deference to the dominant male. Along with arm waving, I find that some Dragons will bow down slowly to the Dominant one. This looks like a bobbing scene in slow motion.   Raised tail -   This is most often seen during breeding season. It seems to signify a certain level of alertness and acceptance. Juvenile Dragons will also do this when stalking its prey.     i got that info from:   http://www.dachiu.com/care/abeard.html
OyNJTWaiaa	In a bird of that age if he has always had the blue cere and now it goes brown, you dont need to do anything to the cere at all.  HOWEVER it indicates a couple of things....a hormonal change and also can be a sign of testicular cancer. You may want to take him to the bird vet for a diagnosis. Otherwise if he is well in himself, leave him be.  Anyone who says its a girl didnt read properly as your bird is mature age 8-10 years and has always had a blue cere until now.|`|uIk9MAnDaa	you have a girl congratz cere  boy = blue  girl = brown crusty|`|ESzlhwoDaa	I've heard that females get a brown scaly/crusty appearance to their cere because of hormones, but not males.     I would suggest to keep an eye on him, keep his cage extra clean, carefully apply vaseline (a known remedy for scaly face, just in case), and maybe vegetable oil.|`|10zHV2thaa	i forgot what its called what i think it does blocks the nose so go check it out my bird had it but it was ok but depends how bad it is
NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    Make up a contract with them that outlines everything you'll do daily (feeding, watering, playing), weekly (cage cleaning, toy clean up, etc), monthly (buying food, bedding, new chew toys, etc.). In that contract, make it clear that you agree, that if you don't uphold your end of the bargain, the animal will be given to a classroom, no-kill shelter, or rescue group - no strings attached - they get everything you bought. That may sound like a lot to agree to, but it's you giving your word both to them in person and on paper that you're ready to do this.    This will show them you're serious.      Don't beg them, whatever you do - trust me, it backfires!    If they say no - don't press them. Listen to their reasons for saying no. Don't immediately tell them no mom & dad, that's not true, etc. Write down what they says, so they sees that you're paying attention and understand them.    Take their list of reasons (if they say no) and find the answers to them that may help you. Don't do this 10 minutes later, do the extra work, etc.    If they say, "I'll think about it - give me some time," don't pester them! They'll give you her answer when they're ready. Patience is a virtue and they may just want to make sure that this isn't a whim or passing idea.    If you'd like anymore help, please feel free to message me :) I have some prepared info on diet, cage types, all sorts of things I'd be glad to share - just make sure you do some of your own research too because I only have basics, I encourage people to explore different websites and if you're not sure if something you read is true - I can look at it and let you know :)    Daisy|`|XFUN8nNOaa	OMG! you are making the right choice!

But you have to remember some things about them. They are nocturnal. That means you can not bother them during their sleep or they can be very unhealthy! They live up to 1-3 years. That is not very long and hamsters get very many problems. Also it is BEST to get a hamster from a breeder not from the pet store. about 50% of the pet store hamsters have Wet-Tail or Fungus disuse or even mites. All those need the vets attention for medication. Please think hardly before making the decision..    Once again yes hamsters are fun and lovably and there is a 50% chance you get a biting hamster you can not hold :( No one wants a biting hamster... do you? Not trying to be mean or anything though but some hamsters are worth it and some really are not. So once again please think it through before going and getting any animal!!      Good luck :) :)    ?Hamster lover?|`|ae34408edee858a0b65457295dabe25daa	Tell then is Buddhists like Richard Gere can have hamsters, you should be too.|`|EENyrmddaa	say you have no friends and feel lonely.|`|7NbUxMwPaa	YOU SHOULD TELL THEM YOU WLL WILL TAKE CARE OF THEM  FEED IT AND WASH IT AND TELL THEM IF U DONT TAKE CARE OF IT RETURN IT IF U HAVE STRAIHT A'S TELL THEM TO GET U ONE!!!!!!!|`|QiqLB1V7aa	There's far too many variables in all of this.  A good, but potentially long term approach would be to show responsibility in some manner.  For example, do you have any other pets?  If so, what care do these pets get, specifically from you?  Do you clean the cat litter box, wash the dog frequently, pick up the droppings in the yard?  Most parents are typically prone to being apprehensive about pets because they suspect they'll have to take care of them.  You can't really blame them, because mom and dad typically have so many things to worry about, especially in this economy, they don't really want more to worry about.    If you don't have any pets, take on different responsibilities that they might usually be doing.  If dad takes the trash out every tuesday night at 6 o'clock, you might want to take it out at 5 o'clock.    Such things carry great weight with parents.  They aren't fun, they aren't easy, but this method works.  Also; try not to boast about all the new responsibilities you've taken on.  Wait for them to tell you that they've noticed a change in you.|`|f96dbdfb33ecfe1ebea6423d5d7fc870aa	In all honesty, my senior year of high school I worked after school at the local pet smart and took care of the small animal department. They often have print out fax sheets on all the animals, and offer books as well. You can also go to your local library and bring home a book on hamster care.    Is your mother against the idea of a rodent as a pet, or you having a pet in general? Why is she protesting? Have you not demonstrated a responsible character in doing household chores, where she fears you'll tire of the new pet and she'll end up doing all the work? Maybe improve on your duties and be consistent to show your mom you do indeed understand that having a pet brings on responsibilities of cage cleaning, feeding, water and regular socialization with the hamster.    A hamster is about $8-$10, the cage is about $30 ( for a good wire cage) and a large bag of bedding that will last MONTHS is about $15. Food is around $6-$12 depending on the band, and size. Maybe set aside enough money from your allowance, or job to pay for the pet yourself to prove to your mother that you're serious.    I do suggest a few things on rodent care:   1 socialize from day one, don't allow a day to go by that you do not handle the hamster.   2 aspen or man made bedding is best for a rodents respiratory system, as strong woods, such as pine or cedar have a lot of scent that can cause membrane irritation in the eyes, nose, mouth and lungs.    3 no matter how "cool" those hamster "condos" look, hamsters teeth never stop growing, they constantly need wood and things to chew on, they will chew away at the plastic cages. Wire is your best bet for a safe and healthy, happy hamster.    Good luck. And I know you said your mind is made up on a hamster, but honestly, gerbils are way friendlier. :-)|`|40IUKsC2aa	if you have not told your parents sit them down and have the talk with them.tell them that you have researched every thing and that you have the money to pay for the hamster so they will not waist any money on the hamster.tell them that they are small and cute don't make a lot of noise.  and if you are up for it say that you will keep it in your room so they will not even have to see it.  and do all your chores so you could show that you are responsible and take care of the hamster.  good luck!|`|2qbLrHBKaa	I have some advice that will be helpful. Start out by asking for a dog. Be convincing and beg for about 20 minutes and let them go over all the reasons why you can't. Pretend to be very disappointed. Then, say how about a cat? When they say no to that too, then you say well can I at least get a hamster? And it will sound so much better in comparison they will probably let you have it. It is a classic technique for getting what you want from your parents, you ask for something very big and outrageous first so that when you ask for something less it sounds so much better and more reasonable that they will say yes.|`|S3eJJu7haa	I Told my mom i would clean the cage and i asked if i could get the hamster as a birthday gift since it was close to my b-day  ask her you'll do chores you'll do anything for the hammy and by the way i prefer a tank because its easier to clean (it was hard to clean ming cause Of the tubes.  shes dead now  R.I.P Cookie  I have 6 other hamsters anyways =)  Hope i helped!  Kimmy|`|Dy4g6nOaaa	You should ask if they say yes then get one. If they say no then the answer is no. You have to ask first. Parents are not going to be persuaded if you decide to be a rebel teenager and keep asking or even write a paper. If you parents believe that you are responsible enough for a pet then more than likely they will allow you to get one.
MEDUZza2aa	Well I also have farm animals. They are goats. The most lovable animals I have ever had.  They are fun to be around and cool.  They are very low maintnence. You can have one, but even though your parents said one more, two would be better.  I would suggest getting a nubian goat, look up on google images, they dont get into a lot of trouble and my personal favorite.  Make sure you research about goats and know what they need and how to take care of them first.  I have never met anyone who has had a goat and not fell in love with it instantly.  ps. i would suggest getting a dairy goat, much easier than meat goats. email me back with your choice.|`|Sga6uU4Zaa	Get a llama  =)  there scary in my opionion tho lol  you might like them|`|Q2K7oTJwaa	Get a cat get a cat get a cat get a cat!!!!!|`|UJjYM9QVaa	get a rooster to wake you up in the morning =p|`|QpGdfh40aa	I like fish they are easy but if u like petting a little kitten or puppy does the trick.|`|0L4r6O1Qaa	At first I think of a Rabbit as we have one that is a fun pet.  Then I see you have them.  So what makes a neat pet?   An animal that wants to be given some attention and gives some love back. The ones on your list of "Don't wants" is mostly pets that are not going to give you loving back.  So you want another animal that has those nice Warm Fuzzy feelings and maybe wants to please you when you train or work together.  Pigs will work for food and can be a friend like a dog.  But not that warn and fuzzy for cuddling.  You may want to re-evaluate your intentions.  Maybe a working animal that gives you the chance to grow as a team.  Where you both get to expand your wings in new ways.  Like working a hunting Hawk.   Good luck.  And remember each of the animals you have now will still need your attention when you get the new addition to the farm.|`|YsMbKwTwaa	A pig! A goat!

If an iguana learns it can throw a fit and keep you away whenever it wants, then you are in for a very rough 15-20 years.  An iguana learns very quickly to respect a person who shows no fear at its worst tantrums.    They get cranky when they shed, because their loose skin itches and bothers them.  It is really not a good idea to try and help them shed as usually people will try to rip the loose skin off, but they don't realize this usually hurts the iguana.  One thing you can do is give the iguana a good soak in some lukewarm water and that will loosen their skin up.|`|hX6M8Psraa	Well maybe he is not warm enough or just is wanting space or is wanting to mate, so maybe get him a female and with the shedding thing that might also be a reason because they hide under little houses (the ones in the tank) and things like that to shed so that might be the reason but i would try going to the pet shop where you got him and ask them, they should know.

At my local shelter, they put your pets paw print in a piece of clay and write their name on it, then put the ashes in a small box with your pets name on the front, on a gold plaqe... very nice.

Rather give them proper burial then to just to garbage truck them. They deserved more respect than that.|`|XWk7TDYTaa	I would try my hardest to break the ground now anyways   so you don't have to worry about a decomposing kitty.|`|v0GwTTsVaa	I would say an extra freezer.  I knew a girl that did that until she could get in with the taxidermist.  If you don't have the freezer though - maybe you could take it to your local animal hospital and have it cremated and then bury the ashes.  They usually have payment plans.  My mother had her dog cremated and she said it wasn't to expensive.|`|8vuOwZHuaa	Not gonna work trust me I've tried. And u might just wanna bury him now instead of waiting till summer.|`|u1HahCoqaa	Either stick him in your own freezer (Although dont let any guests go and get some ice lol) or see if any of your friends will let you stick your cat in theirs. Really, the snow isnt the best....I mean, a scavenger could find it, mice could chew on it, and a sudden thaw while you were gone could mess it up. And some kids digging around could get the scare of their life...|`|HN1zYwbFaa	You might have to ask your vet if he can hold on to him for you...|`|AA12322387	I'm sorry your kitty died.  Your best bet may be cremation.  There are many places that cremate pets now.  Check and see if you have a crematory that isn't too far away.  It isn't that expensive either.  Good luck.|`|9RDKfgHnaa	I would ship your cat to Texas it's really warm here.|`|qLkknQx1aa	bite the bullet and start digging... why wait?
CyWFEUjTaa	Are you talking about the dog in your avatar picture above your name? Because that dog looks like a Havanese to me and he is the right size for a Havanese. Here are some pictures http://images.google.com/images?ndsp=18&...   http://images.google.com/images?ndsp=18&...  The temperment you describe is consistent with that of a Havanese as well!|`|P8Q39vA4aa	A picture would help immensely. a bigger picture that is.|`|s23w0I3Baa	how could you possibly think that dog as a puppy was a yorkie? its white!!!|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Personally it doesn't look like a yorkie to me at all. It does however look like the dog from 7th heaven.|`|NIlgYM4saa	Maltese/Yorkshire Terrier mix.|`|Ti476VHkaa	Defiantly a Maltese|`|djeTYZtoaa	do you have a picture?    if its the one in you picture i would say shih tzu or shitzu cross maltese|`|4Fz9LFq2aa	Well, you can get him tested to see what breed he really is, but it is quite expensive.|`|3WzGf8tJaa	It is hard to say without a picture.  Most likely it is a yorkie mix.  I hope that you didn't pay money for it.  Is it registered?  You got ripped if you paid any money for a mix breed.|`|2iRkXJ4oaa	Is he the one above your screen name? If so he looks like a Maltese.    Wherever you got him, please dont' go there again they sound like back yard breeders.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	Looks like a Yorkie to me.  Just unusual color.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	If the dog in your ID profile is the one your talking about, Then you got taken. Its a Maltese or a Yorkie/Maltese mix. Yorkies are NEVER all white. There ears should be pricked too.|`|RAtgv9GHaa	Guys,Her avatar has a pic of him.  I think henry is a maltese/shihTzu mix,shihTzu hair,but maltese white?  How in the world could he be a yorkshire terrier?  HE IS WHITE????|`|hPhQkT79aa	Yorkie is black and yellow dude|`|GC5eowDZaa	could it be a coton de tular
TTs6GBBUaa	Only you can decide if it's too early to get a new hamster if you're ok on getting a new hamster then get one. But if it died shortly after getting it them go to a different pet store as that one may have sick hamsters. Also yes bathe all the stuff in bleached water then rinse it with VERY hot water VERY well and dry it.|`|HkpMrMepaa	I'm sorry about Crashers!! Really i am, i know what its like to loose a hamster.    Anywhoo;; Whenever you feel like you can move on from Crashers then thats when your ready. Only you know.    To sanitize the cage i would soak it in bleach and LOTS of water. Not so much bleach or just wash it multiple times w/ soap.|`|krqfJViEaa	Im extremely sorry about your loss. =( I cant imagine losing my hamster, Chester. Dont worry its never too early or too late to get another hamster. Its fine to get it the very next day if your really upset. Another nice, loving hamster will help you get over it. :) This is what i would do if my hamster died.     Thoroughly cleanse and sanitize EVERYTHING your old hamster had. The new hamster will be frightened if he smells the other hamster, since they're very territorial. After cleansing and etc. bleach it or rub it with strong soap or dish washing soap. And leave it in the bath tub to dry. (Its best to let the air dry it than to dry it yourself. It may take a couple of hrs.)    Dont worry and i trust that you DID take very great care of your hamster. :)      Hope I helped and good luck! :)
86uJuzomaa	I would say rats. I have 2 female rats, and they have never bitten me and only peed on me a couple of times when I first got them.      Yes the need a fairly big cage, but you can find guides online that tell you how to make a good cage for under $30.      Another option is that you can use a shelf. Two rats would need two to three levels depending on how big the shelf is. All you have to do is cut a small square and attach a ramp so the can reach both levels. Waterproof the bottom and the edges so the wood doesn't rot and attach wire fence so you can open it like a door and take them out easily.       Its actually really easy to clean their cages. Just use old folded up towels for bedding and every 3-5 days shake out the poop and throw them in the washing machine.     As for food just give them fresh fruit and veggies, a tiny bit of meat or dog food for protein, some seeds, nuts, bread, and cereal for dry food and some lab blocks for nutrients.    Make sure to get a pair and to take them out for a least 30-60 min a day.    Depending on your personality either gender suit you more.      Females are smaller, smarter, friendlier, and rarely scent mark, but they also love to explore and are more prone to mammary tumors.     Males are bigger, more relaxed, and are less prone to tumors, but when they go through 'puberty' the get aggressive and scent mark often. Of course you can avoid these downsides for both genders as long as you get a healthy rat with a good temperament.    I've had hamsters, dwarf hamsters, bunnies, and mice before and I much prefer rats.|`|TTs6GBBUaa	If you want a smarter animal that can learn tricks then get rats but remember they NEED to have rat friends. If you want something small and cute with very little maintenance get a mouse. Do your research read site after site after site about both then choose wich is best for your life style.|`|OtjXWzOZaa	rat i used to have mice but they arent as fun as the rats i have now. the rats are more sociable and funner to be around they are awesome pets and you should one or two|`|IaU6PS23aa	Mice are really fun to watch and just observe, but only if you get them in pairs or more.|`|CRRlESW0aa	You should get pet mice because you would save their lives. People feed live mice to their snakes. They are very social and easy to take care of. They need a lot of exercise so get them a big cage, exercise wheels, and many other rodent toys including tubes!|`|t6Ya3c3baa	Definitely rats!    Rats are much more friendly than mice. Rats don't have as strong an odor as mice. Rats have more engaging personalities than mice.    Rats need 2 cubic feet of cage space, each. Get two of the same gender, preferably littermates.    No matter which rodent you get, never use cedar or pine shavings for bedding. If you must use shavings, use aspen. Paper bedding is better.    Don't get a hamster, they bite savagely.    EDIT: Susanna D, rats are also fed to snakes.|`|kTpWRCBqaa	If I were you I would get neither of those two choices. Not a rat because they are very big compared to mice and very hard to clean up after.          I wouldn't get a mouse because you wouldn't be able to take it out much because they are very fast/small and could be lost easily. They also could get into smaller places.         I would choose a hamster. They are normally very sweet and not that hard to  clean up after. All they need is a cage cleaning once or twice a week. Older hamsters need 3 or 4 times a week. They are about in the middle of rats and mice size-wise.          If you don't want a hamster or absolutely have to get one of those two choices you listed I would choose the mouse.         Hope I helped!! : - )|`|7KP4rb5yaa	are you out all the time with  ur freinds then get a mice  if you are to urself and stay in the house with nothing to do get a rat    mice are used to being by themselves and very low maintnents  rats have high maintnents but keep u entertained  it all depends on ur lifestile as terra said|`|AA12234712	Rats without a doubt.  We have a few of them, and they are so much fun.  They are like very Miniature dogs.  You can train them, let them run around near you and call their name and they will come right back to you, providing they know there name.  If you go for a rat just remember get 2 baby boys from the same litter and they will be happy.  Don't get girls they seem to get tumors allot, we had to put down a few already.  the clean up is easy, and there is no smell like with mice.  As far as the urine, mine have only peed when, we first got them.  Once they get use to you they hardly pee unless they are startled or left out of there cage for a long period of time.  Hope this helps you.|`|Dy4g6nOaaa	Ratties!!!
3p1vcFlOaa	It's all in networking and meeting people and showing and proving and exposing yourself as an equestrian.  Through your trainer or other horsey friends that you meet at the shows...go to shows even if not participating.    Not sure in your discipline but anytime someone receives $$$ for working with horses, it changes their status from Amateur to Pro..so make sure you don't jeopardize your classification.  As far as prize money..you may have to split it with the owner or maybe give it all to them...Just check it out!!    Good Luck|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	i dont understand your question.  add some details, and I'll do my best.|`|vow5ULxTaa	i think you mean cash?  well at a junior level you won't recieve cash prizes unless you are at a colligete level.  For example i know alot of barrel racign competitions give away cash prizes.  But in English you really have to be a pro t oget rewarded for your hobby.|`|LCxSXKpQaa	Most of the time when you 'catch ride' for someone, you know the person you are riding for or they ask you to ride their horse, mainly to get the horse qualified.    Hope this helps!|`|zk5VBdLEaa	i am a junior rider who catch rides on the A/AA circuit.  in order to get catch ride, you really have to have proven yourself on your own horse/pony.  Then people will approach you and ask you to show their pony to get qualified/ to be trained.  Most of the time  the catch riding is organized through the trainer, and most often only the well respected trainers are asked.  you need to be a good, well known, respected rider to get a catch ride, it is a common misconception that anyone can just become a catchrider but it really takes hard work.      if you are catch riding someone elses horse, and you win money, whoever paid for the classes should get the money that is won.  Unless it is a stake class you only get like $20 any way but normally the rider does not get this money, the owner does    good luck|`|oR9ZODGtaa	You have to be involved in the 'horse world' and be in a network with your local barn area and people who run shows and what not. Ask around, tell your riding instructor to ask around, and get into the 'system'.   You have to be a very good rider, and you usually just work to making the horse better trained and more fit. It's so the owner has time to work with their winning horses more and not waste all there time on a horse that won't be able to win shows/money next week.    P.S. - Junior riders don't win money for doing junior shows and stuff (unless it's like bareback dollar and stuff like that). And anyway, even at Pro levels, the rider doesn't win the money; the owner of the horse wins it.
GdBG4PGYaa	Kitten's have most of their teeth by 6 weeks.    But, they start teething again at about 6 months. This can last for up to 4 months. Maybe, less or more. :)    He may be sick, take him to the vet. Just to be sure. It is better to just see, then waiting until it gets too far out of hand.        Hope I helped! Good luck! :)|`|3AVHxNNTaa	a week exactly. on the 168th hour your cat with morph into an adult.
