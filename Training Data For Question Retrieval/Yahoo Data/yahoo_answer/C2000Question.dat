20090307081149AAnY0Ra	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	I need some help with iPhone...iPhone texting...Texting costs...?!?!?? For anyone who is good w/ the iPhone!!!?	Ok.  So right now the 4 members of my family all have a phone with at&t; we are all under one plan.  I want to get an iPhone from at&t possibly.  So I have some money but not a lot so I was thinking of getting one of eBay (like a new one) BUT.  I was just wondering, do you have to pay for texting?? Right now, my family all has unlimited texting which I think is $30 a month.  By getting the phone off of ebay, putting my SIM card into it, would I have texting...like would I just be able to go and text my friends w/o having to do anything? Would it still cost the same...or would I have to like pay a different price or something?     Also-- For internet on the iPhone.  I know if you use Wi-Fi you do not have to pay, right?  But what if you don't...like what if yoy get internet where you can have it all the time? How much do you have to pay? (I do not have any internet right now on my curren phone, which is the LG Shine)   Lastly-- I would like to know if it is easy to text on.  I have kinda big thumbs so I really don't want it to be annoying to use the buttons.  Are the buttons too small, is it easy to get used to?     So- I you can answer my questions abd give me any feedback on the iPhone (especially if you have one) that would be great!!      THANKS!!!!!!!!!! :)

20090307081350AAFd51R	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Can someone help me choose a digital camera?	I have two digital cameras now, one Nikon D200 and one 5.0 mega pixel Kodak Easy Share.      I don't use the Nikon because it is so much trouble to get everything together and set it etc. I use my Kodak.      My Kodak is a couple years old. I want a new camera that is slimmer and that has more mega pixels - a 10 mega pixel would be good or at least an 8.      I am pretty happy with the Kodak I have now. The things I don't like are the batteries constantly need replacing and it takes longer than what I think it should before I can get my LCD ready to take another photo.      I don't want another real expensive camera. I want to spend around $150.00. Mostly I take photos of kids and activites at church. Occasionally I do blow up photos to about an 8x10 size and I do scrapbooking.      I was looking at the Nikon Coolpix or another Kodak Easyshare...      Any opinions or is there a website I can compare cameras?      THANKS!

Any thoughts????      My second problem is How do u get ur gamer tag on ur msn name so it says if ur on the dashboard or which ever game ur in, because mine wont do it, ive turned msn off on the xbox cause like i said, i like to be on msn on ma pc,       All my frends just go on msn normally on their pc n it comes up there names.      Ive emailed xbox about these and they say it can not be resolved over email, has to be done on the phone but i hate phoning companys.      Any thots on either of these???

20090307094716AAETMIz	Consumer Electronics;Other - Electronics	How do I stop AM radio frequency interference coming from an AC electric fan motor?	I just installed a power-vent water heater in my home. It has an exhaust fan that runs whenever this natural gas heater is heating water.      Whenever the fan turns on, I get extreme whining on my AM radio, which disappears once the fan stops. The pitch of the whining seems to be at a similar frequency as the sound from the running fan....there is no doubt, in my mind, that the fan is causing the interference.      FM reception has little-to-no such interference.      Can anyone help me cure this problem?      Thank you for your help!

20090307100504AAUheNo	Consumer Electronics;Other - Electronics	The film in my video tape disappeared?	Ok. I got a video from the library and put it in my vcr. I pressed play and the movies started playing. But the tape wasn't rewinded all the way so I pressed stop and then rewind to make it go faster. Then it stopped so i figured that it was done rewinding so I pressed play. Nothing happened it wouldn't play. I took it out and put it back in and it ejected the tape on it's own. I tried and tried again and it kept ejecting. So i looked in side the video tape and there was no film thing. Is it possibly that I rewinded so much that the tape pulled the film back in??? What happened? How do I fix it?? I really wanna watch this movie.

I popped in a cd (Guns N' Roses: Greatest Hits if that helps...) and when I play any song, it doesn't sound right.

I tried another CD (Slash's Snakepit: It's Five O' Clock Somewhere) and I got the same results. When I plugged in my mp3 player, most of my song's were doing the same thing. The cd(s) plays fine on my cd player, computer, and stereo, just not my 360. I also checked my AV cables, they were all in the right places and the HD/TV switch was on the right one (TV). When I play any games the sound is fine. Any ideas on what might be wrong?
