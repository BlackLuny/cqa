I think you ought to ask for an interview with the doctor and establish the true situation first. It does sound like a breach of confidentiality, but there might have been a good reason. If your doctor works in a group practice then another confidential talk with another doctor in the practice may help. After that, if you still feel unsatisfied, it is a matter for the state licensing authority (USA) or the General Medical Council (UK).|`|fEBOzWeXaa	Start with the administrator of the hospital or clinic the doctor is affiliated with.

e28KtQTqaa	Newton's method finds the solution to an equation:<br>  <br>  f(x) = 0<br>  <br>  by taking an initial estimate x', and finding a better estimate:<br>  <br>  x' - f(x')/f'(x')<br>  <br>  It can be adapted to finding extrema (e.g. minima and maxima) because at these extrema, f'(x) = 0.  Therefore, if you have an estimate x' for a minimum/maximum, a better estimate is:<br>  <br>  x' - f'(x')/f''(x')<br>  <br>  In multiple variables, the derivative of f is the Jacobian matrix (i.e. the gradient), and the second derivative is the Hessian matrix (matrix of second derivatives).  So if x' is is an estimate of where the extremum is, a better estimate is:<br>  <br>  x' - [H f(x')]^-1 [J f(x')]<br>  <br>  (Aside: In practice, you tend to pick a 0<γ<1 and use x' - γ [H f(x')]^-1 [J f(x')].  Setting γ too low makes the iteration converge more slowly, and setting it too high causes numeric instability.  Good algorithms choose γ dynamically, changing the value as the shape of the function's landscape changes.)<br>  <br>  One problem is that the Hessian matrix is usually very expensive to calculate.  A lot of the research in function minimisation is in ways to avoid computing the entire Hessian matrix.<br>  <br>  One common approximation is to use:<br>  <br>  H = 2 J^T J<br>  <br>  which is first-order accurate.  That is, if you compute a Taylor series for H, then 2 J^T J is the first-order terms.<br>  <br>  The Gauss-Newton method is essentially Newton's method with two modifications:<br>  <br>  1. It uses the above approximation for the Hessian matrix.<br>  2. It relies on the function to be minimised taking a certain form.<br>  <br>  The form that it uses is as follows.  Suppose that you have a series of functions r1&ldots;rm.  Then:<br>  <br>  f(x1,x2&ldots;xn) = [r1(x)]2 + [r2(x)]2 + &ldots; + [rm(x)]2<br>  <br>  where we will denote the vector (x1,x2&ldots;xn) by x.<br>  <br>  The reason why this is useful is that the form of function turns up when you're doing least-squares fitting.  If P = (x,y) is a data point, and you're trying to fit the function y = g(x), then r(x,y) = f(x) - y is the error at P.  If you have m data points, then the least squares error will be precisely of the form that Gauss-Newton requries.|`|U51Lal1Raa	From looking at wikipedia, it looks like the Newton Method<br>  is for functions of one variable, and Gauss-Newton is for <br>  sum-of-squares of many variables.

H6KvVXnraa	I totally believe in the paranormal and therefore do not think you are weird or anything of that nature.  I am, however, concerned on your depictions of what you have seen and the fact that you are calling them "witches".  Are you aware of what a witch really is or are you basing your opinion of them on what Hollywood calls a witch?  You say in your question that she was nothing like you see in the movies and yet to me you seem to be describing exactly what is in the movies.  The name that I would give what you have seen, keeping in mind that I have not seen it personally, would be demon or something of that nature but most definitely not witch.<br>  That having been said, I believe your story that you have seen something and that your parents are perhaps a bit sceptical about it.  Parents ,especially, don't want to believe that their children may be 'seeing things' and will always find a way to rationalize it all away for them.  They really are doing it to protect you.  Kind of in the same way they tell you if you don't think about there being a monster under your bed, there won't be.  <br>  When I started to question the existence of things that my parents wouldn't acknowledge, I began to research to the best of my ability at the time, (no internet lol) all of the different stories and accounts that other people were sharing to see if there were any similarities and/or if they had any insight on where else to turn.<br>  For the time being at least, I wouldn't be afraid but I would be alert.

Your lights may flicker more than you normally realize, and like r_wand said, your powergrids are still likely to be interdependent.<br>  <br>  I also agree about the beeswax claptrap, and the website someone offered as "evidence" was simply an online store selling the stuff!  :)  I think lack of basic science understanding is why this kind of thing happens. The burning of wax is a chemical reaction and electroneutrality will be conserved throughout this reaction. What does that mean? It means that for every negative ion generated, a positive ion will also be generated. Now, the total number of negative and positive ions might be greater for beeswax, who knows. Perhaps it burns hotter. But there won't be an excess of negative ions. Basic chemistry. Also, there doesn't seem to be a citation to this Japanese beeswax study anywhere. And Japan is as mired in clap-trap these days as us Americans.<br>  <br>  Edit: Minerva, I already found all the websites on beeswax, including most of yours. NONE OF THEM cite any studies or show any evidence that burning of beeswax emits excess negative ions. Absolutely NONE. They just repeat the mantra, and now you repeat the mantra. It's baffling (and a little amusing) that your idea of a "science fact" is simply to parrot websites (even websites that are trying to sell you something, LOL!) rather than cite peer-reviewed research. As for me, I'll stick with the facts. I'll stick with science. Chemical reactions must conserve charge, thus no excess of negative ions. Debunk that (and win a Nobel in the process!).

dX9eDZYFaa	No, I wasn't good at it at first.  I had to learn to do it.  Now, with a million or so repititions, I can do most of them in my head.   Why are you going to tech school?  Once you get in pharmacy school you can automatically become a tech, don't waste you time in tech school, that's crap you can learn ON the job.  Take your prerequisite classes and apply to pharmacy school, don't waste your time learning tech stuff in a classroom that you will learn as an intern anyway.  Good luck to you.|`|DhLIo8nbaa	I used to be a pharmacy tech and the only time you are really converting things is when you are mixing up the liquid medications, and they have a thing that does that.  the one at my pharmacy was mounted to a wall, and you would put in the right amount of water and then put the bottle right there and put the water up to the line on the bottle so it is very easy it is not nearly as difficult as they make it sound.  The main thing you do is a tech is count pills.  you enter the scripts into the computer and you get the bottle off the shelf and you count out the pills, but usaully most pharmacies either have a machine or a scale so you dont have to count them one by one, except the controlled substanes that are locked up...and some pharmacies wont even let the techs handle those.  But thats the main part of your job and then the pharmacist comes over and checks your work and you then abg it up and its ready for the customer.  I loved doing it but I have to say that the reason I got out of it was because I was the one who did everything.  I might have just worked with a lazy pharmacist because I only worked at one place for a couple years but I would do all the work and she would sit and read a book all day.  She did do some things but she would sit in the back and when I needed her to check my work she would come out and check it and then go back into the back and keep reading, so it sometimes very frusterating.  But like I said I only worked one place so other pharmacies might be different I dont know.  I did really love it at first because it was alot of fun and it was a busy job and I worked in a busy pharmacy so I was constantly moving.  From the second I got there to the second I left I was constantly filling prescriptions because people want their stiff yesterday and they come in and hand you their prescription and watch you until you get it done but they do not realize that they have other peoplee in front of them so even if you tell them it will be a 45 minute wait some of them just stand there and stare at you and it gets frusterating.  I think being a pharmacist would be alot easier, well not exactaly easier but probably alot more rewarding because although a job is not all about the money they do get paid alot more than a tech does and they do the same work, if not less so they have a little more incentive to put up with the custmers.  But overall it was not a bad experience and I have to say I learned alot.|`|P4cvrMxgaa	I've been a tech for 8 years and am about a year away from graduating pharmacy school.  I love being a tech.  I do some conversions, but they get easier as you go because they are mostly the same.  However, once you get into pharmacy school the conversions are much more complicated and you have to do a lot of them.  As for being a tech, I get to help patients, solve insurance problems, and learn about medications.  My pharmacists make interventions on medication regimens and counsel patients on their prescriptions and OTC products.  Pharmacists don't just "put pills in bottles" or "do the same thing as a tech and just get paid more".

NbdTgyLPaa	One thing you need to understand to solve this problem is that momentum and velocity are vector quantities.  Which means the direction is important.  So the initial momentum is<br>  (6.0 * 10^(-2) kg) * (28 m/s) = 1.68 kg*m/s<br>  Remembering that direction is important, and that after the ball was struck it was moving in the opposite direction, the final momentum is<br>  (6.0 * 10^(-2) kg) * (-7.5 m/s) = -0.45 kg*m/s<br>  Now to find the change in the momentum (or to find the impulse), we take the different of the two<br>  -0.45 kg*m/s - 1.68 kg*m/s = -2.13 kg*m/s<br>  Which would round to -2.1 kg*m/s<br>  <br>  Note this negative sign merely means this is the direction opposite to that of the direction the ball was moving before it was struck.|`|1rRtEQVlaa	Andre is right about all the equations BUT REMEMBER that momentum is a vector quantity.  So, we have an initial velocity of 28 m/s in one direction and a final velocity of 7.5 m/s in the OPPOSITE direction.  The equivalent momentum change is then 6.0x10-2 x (28 + 7.5) kg m/s in the direction of the final velocity.  Ie. we REMOVED the initial momentum and ADDED momentum in the opposite direction.|`|TJypuN7xaa	Easy! Stop relying on equations so much, and think about what's actually going on (and what the question is asking).<br>  <br>  Momentum is simply mass times velocity.<br>  <br>  Initial momentum: [6.0x(10^-2)](28)<br>  Final momentum: [6.0x(10^-2)](7.5)<br>  <br>  Solve for the two, and your change in momentum (impulse) is simply how much the two numbers differ. Keep in mind it's going to be negative, since the object is slowing down (decreasing in momentum).
8vo2IdMOaa	this is pretty easy. you have to pretend like the > sign is and equals sign. so you graph it. x (1) is the slope and -3 is the y-intercept. graph the points and make sure you draw a dotted line connecting them. the line has to be dotted because it is only greater than instead of greater than or equal to. for the next one you just do the same thing but you start at 0 since you don't have a y-intercept. good luck!

This is due to several reasons.<br>  <br>  1) Carbon dioxide is much more soluble in water than in air. (The concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide is higher than that in the atomsphere.<br>  2) Carbonate equilibria pump carbon dioxide into seawater. When carbon dioxide dissolves into seawater, it gets converted into other forms like carbonic acid, bicarbonate, and carbonate. As carbon dioxide gets converted into these species, more of the gas can dissolve in the ocean.<br>  3) The solubility pump. Carbonate can be removed from solution by the formation of calcium carbonate (limestone). This drives the carbonate equilibria to the right, pumping more CO2 into the ocean.<br>  4) The biological pump. Living organisms fix carbon into their tissues and deposit them onto the seafloor after they die. Once on the seafloor, no appreciable decomposition occurs, so the carbon is stored for eons. The removal of carbon dioxide by photoautotrophs also drives the dissolution of CO2 into seawater.

22vd3xXDaa	First of all, you are correct in assuming there needs to be a gap in time between the two.  Alcohol and hydrocodone, the narcotic in Vicodin, are both central nervous system depressants.  The combination of the two results in additive CNS depressant effects (respiratory depression, psychomotor impairment).  The combination of the two can also result in increased liver toxicity (your liver processes both as it is; the combination of the two just makes it more difficult).<br>  <br>  Realistically, give your body time to work through the hydrocodone and acetaminophen first; I'd say at least 4-6 hrs., but ideally just avoiding alcohol for the day is the best bet.|`|23hPHjOqaa	I'm going to tell you what I have told countless other people on Yahoo!

a7a7d61d2304fa70769870fad1171da0aa	Good question, and there is an answer as far as man is able to answer it at present.  The answer lies in four equations: m=e/c2. e=mc2, c2=e/m, and c=h.  <br>  <br>  The first two equations state that the basis of mass and energy is that of the c2 value.  This is the value of physical time, and what all forms of mass and energy are composed of.  The third equation is that of a field of physical time, or that of a field of gravity - <a href="http://youtube.com" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com</a>  "Gravity engine 1 and Gravity Engine 2"  other science videos by "Stcorridon".  The fourth equation is the value of "c".  It describes the value of "c" as being also that of the value "h", both constants in the physics realm.  The value of "c" is that of a particular speed, while that of "h" is the energy found in that speed.  <br>  <br>  When a person completes the equation e=mc2 there is an automatic conversion of 'c" to that of "h", which is why an energy value in Joules is found.  Individual gravitons are expressed as "c=h".<br>  <br>  What this means is that the basis of all forms of energy and matter is that of "c=h".  This value is so small in energy form 6.626196 -34 Joules per sec. that it is impossible for this to have formed into electromagnetic radiation, which in turn forms mass, apart from the act of God, The Creator.  The only "place" time is able to be formed is by the presence of God.|`|elY5vkVyaa	I'd mention the significance of consciousness but the scientific community around Yahoo don't like that kind of thing so I'll avoid a few thumbs-downs this time and just say that neither matter or energy truly "exist" as such, they're more like functions of numbers.|`|6aBvgvvYaa	To date, there is no experimental proof<br>  that energy can be created from "nothing"<br>  or destroyed "into nothing" If energy is<br>  not here, you are not here.

My brother must of got to close, he was smack in the face, everyone woke up about 2am and my grandmother came up stairs to look at his face. I saw two there, I use to play in the dark a lot, it was a very big long closet that lead to about three or four bed rooms, we had a large family. I peek through one of the skeleton key holes in one of the bedrooms and saw a spirit floating by, it was kinda whitish in color.

Just remember when balancing equations its filling numbers and checking if they work and its usually best to save Oxygen and Hydrogen for last. For the first question See that you have 3I on the left of the equation sign but 2 I on the right. To make them even put a 2 in front of ALI3 and a 3 in front of I2. Now you have 6 I on each side but you also have 2 Al on the left side and only 1 on the right so put a 2 in front of Al on the right. Putting the 2 in front of AlBr3 gives you 6 Br on the right so put a 3 in front of Br on the left side of the equation and your equation is now balance.. it is 2AlI3 +3Br2 = 2AlBr3+3I2

Peak effects usually occur about an hour and a half after taking it.  I notice sedation/anxiety relief within 20 minutes after taking it, but  I take it for anxiety so I don't really pay attention to a "high." For me, it's anxiolytic effects usually wear off by the next day (so 18-24 hours).  Also depends on how much you take.  It lasts longer than other similar drugs such as Xanax but doesn't have the intense and rapid effect.

Good luck.|`|SOSsN6mpaa	Divide $72,000 by 600. That is 120. So the writer was paid $120 per word. You can check this by multiplying $120 by 600, which is indeed $72,000. ONE-HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS PER WORD. <br>  <br>  You need to put the numbers/values in order. <br>  8,3,5,20,6,3,3,5,7<br>  3,3,3,5,5,6,7,8,20 <br>  <br>  Median is the middle number/value. If there's an odd number of values, then it is the one in the middle. If there's an even number then it is the average of the two middle values. <br>  <br>  You have nine values. Counting from both sides, the value in the middle (the fifth value) is 5. So FIVE is the median. <br>  <br>  Mode is the value that appears most often. If they are all there an equal amount, say {1,2,3,4} then there is no mode. If multiple numbers show up more than once, then it is the one with the most {1,1,2,3,3,4,4,4} The mode would be 4 there. If it is the same number of reappearances, {1,2,2,3,3,4} Then it can be more than one value. So there it would be 2 AND 4. <br>  <br>  In your set of {3,3,3,5,5,6,7,8,20 } 3 and 5 are both repeated. 3 shows up three times. 5 shows up twice. 3 times is more than 2 times, so THREE IS THE MODE. <br>  <br>  50 red marbles + 60 blue + 40 yellow = 150 total. <br>  There are 50 red marbles out of 150 total marbles. <br>  50/150. <br>  50/150 is one third if you did not already know. one third in decimal form is .3 repeating. so it is 33.3repeating%<br>  If you don't immediately know what the fraction is in percent form, you can divide the numerator by the denominator. 50 divided by 150 is .3repeating. Then move the decimal point over two places to the right. .33 repeating becomes 33.3repeating. That is the percent!|`|GF6l6eZmaa	for the first question, to find out how much each word earns him (the rate), simply divide the 72,000 by 600. As for the second, one really easy way to find median is to line up all the numbers in order and mark one off from the beginning and end until you have the one number left (if there are two then you add and divide by 2). Mode is the same as average, add up all the numbers and divide the total by how many numbers you have. As for the percentage, I'm rotten with those so find someone else to help you on this last one.<br>  hope this helped.|`|kOMzs1vAaa	I don't think you should be asking us how to do maths, you should see your maths teacher but i will tell you how i would do these.<br>   <br>  1)<br>   you need to get rid off the rubbish in the question so 72000 and 600 i all you need divide those two numbers<br>  <br>  2)<br>  Put all your values from lowest to highest<br>  <br>  So 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7,8, 20 <br>  <br>  and get the value that comes in the middle<br>  <br>  3) <br>  the mode is the number or subject that appears the most frequent<br>  <br>  4)<br>   add 50 + 60 + 40= 150  in this instance 50 is 1/3 of 150 so and 1/3 equates to 33%|`|G2I9spZ7aa	1. $ 72000/ 600 = $120 / word<br>  2. u hv to make it subsequent first. 3 3 3 5 5 6 7 8 20<br>     median = 5( point in the middle ) let say there's 10 numbers so u pick the 5 and 6 and divided by 2<br>  3. 3 3 3 5 5 6 7 8 20<br>     mode = the frequently the number appears = 3 because it appears 3 times<br>  4. 50/150 X 100 % = 33.33%<br>  as i remembered so far that answer should be ok.<br>  <br>  btw, how old r u ?<br>  junior high school or high school?|`|k3ADx3vfaa	120 dollars for each word<br>  <br>  5<br>  <br>  3<br>  <br>  33%|`|1xdvVtFIaa	For the first one, you simply have to think about it:<br>  <br>  The writer was paid 72,000 dollars TOTAL, and he typed 600 pages, so to simply find how much he was paid per word, you divide 72000 by 600, to find out how much he was paid per word. <br>  <br>  To find the median of any number set, you simply line up the numbers from lowest to highest, for example ( 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 20)  <br>  <br>  And now you simply have to find the number in the middle, in this case it will be 5 ( the number in the middle fo the number set). <br>  <br>  Think about the problem with marbles as a bag with a bunch of marbles inside it...<br>  <br>  You have a bag that has 50 red, and 60 blue, and 40 yellow, and they're all in ONE bag right? So you add them all up, and you have 150 marbles in total....<br>  <br>  When asked what percent are red..you get the desired amount ( 50 red marbles) and divide it by the total amount ( 150 marbles)<br>  <br>  You will get .3, and then you will multiply that by 100 to get 30%|`|4KheENh6aa	1) For the rate, follow the formula: Amount Paid/# of Words<br>  So in this case it would be 72000/600 = Just calculate and you get your rate!<br>  <br>  2) The median is the number that is in the middle. *Think median = medium or in the middle*<br>     Put the numbers in order from the least to greatest.  The number directly in the middle of the set is the median.  In the case that there are an even number of numbers, you find the average the two middle numbers.  So in this case: 3 3 3 5 5 6 7 8 20, because there is nine numbers, you can find the median!<br>  <br>  3) The mode is the number that appear the most.  Think MOde and MOst. Just like what you did with median, line up the numbers from least to greatest 3 3 3 5 5 6 7 8 20.  Which of the numbers appear the most?<br>  <br>  4) Percents are parts of a whole!  You want to add up all the parts to get the total.  Then you put the number of the items you are looking for over the total.  So in this case, the total is 50 + 60 + 40 = 150 marbles total.<br>     To find just the red marbles: 50 red marbles / 150 total marbles = __!  After you get a decimal, multiply by 100 to get your %!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *Solutions are in the source area!

b0oCFZ5Maa	I like the delta sedimentology idea. Another is to explain the way that radioactive elements can be used to date rocks. The idea of radioactive decay opens up a lot of possibilities for participation. Have students represent atoms decaying at a fixed rate, and illustrate how time can be determined by counting how many students are still standing. This forms the basis for a lot of useful techniques in geology - perhaps the most obvious is that it allows us to determine how old the earth is.<br>  <br>  I don't know what level you-re trying to teach to, so you'll need to figure out yourself how much more in depth to go.|`|a2JymA2qaa	Its a bit messy but you could show how the deltas at the mouths of rivers form.<br>  Simply take some very very fine grained sand in a 2 liter bottle with water (about half sand and half water). Take a long piece of cardboard and fold it lengthwise. Open it up to form a shallow groove, lay this out at a low angle. Shake up the water and sand then pour the slurry out relatively quickly at the upper end of the groove. As the water and sand move down the groove (river channel) note the type and formation of sand rivulets forming (sand bars). At the end of the cardboard groove when the water and sand are washed/dumped off the end, note the patterns of sand that form as the mixture spreads out (a river delta, like the Mississippi at the Gulf of Mexico).
Q2sZhNmJaa	James Dewey Watson was born in Chicago, Ill., on April 6th, 1928, as the only son of James D. Watson, a businessman, and Jean Mitchell. His father's ancestors were originally of English descent and had lived in the midwest for several generations. His mother's father was a Scottish-born taylor married to a daughter of Irish immigrants who arrived in the United States about 1840. Young Watson's entire boyhood was spent in Chicago where he attended for eight years Horace Mann Grammar School and for two years South Shore High School. He then received a tuition scholarship to the University of Chicago, and in the summer of 1943 entered their experimental four-year college.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/watson-bio.html" rel="nofollow">http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medic...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/wat0bio-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/...</a>

Electrons will flow from a point that is more negative (an excess of electrons) to one that is more positive (a deficiency of electrons).<br>  <br>  In order for current to flow through the bird, it woild have to touch points that are at two different voltages from one another, like the wire and the ground (which is zero volts), or the wire and another wire which was at a different voltage.<br>  <br>  Since the bird stands on only one wire, then both of its feet are at the same voltage.  Without a DIFFERENCE in voltage, no electrical current will flow.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	I wonder why people answer when it is obvious that they have no idea what they are talking about.|`|wjwsFPMuaa	You have to be in contact with more than one line to get electrocuted by a power line.|`|lkxFy681aa	We could do the same thing.<br>  However, we are too heavy.<br>  <br>  The rubber tubes around the wires absorb any 'loose' electrical charge.<br>  Which is why they don't get zapped when sat there.<br>  <br>  Also, the electricity has nowhere to go.

There is a very light atmosphere at about 1% the density compared to the atmosphere here on earth which would cause any air in your lung to expand and rupture your lungs. It is recommended to breath out as much as you can to reduce this effect. The temperature on the planet is relatively stable reaching a very pleasant 25 degrees Celsius in the hottest parts to a quite chilly -50 or -70 in the colder parts.

The lowest estimate I've found is 55% water by mass. We'll go with that number, since a lower water percentage means a quicker freeze. So a 100-kg human being could have, at the very least, 55 kg of water. That means that his body's water would have to lose more than 8600 kJ of heat energy.

Heterosis, also known as hybrid vigor or outbreeding enhancement is found with equine mules. Line bred domestic horses are inbred with reduced genetic variation.

There is about a 1 in a million chance for a female mule being fertile as it has been observed at least once. However in Poitou France, where riding mules are bred, 50,000 mares are at pasture with the jacks for mule production.

Waterfowl are more prone to hybridization than other species and most of the known hybrids are domestic or captive birds that cross. The Mallard has about 50 known possible crosses with other duck & geese species. In the wild hybrid Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos)/American Black Ducks (Anas rubripes) have been found to be 8% to 13% of the tagged Mallards and Black Ducks.<br>  <a href="http://mypage.direct.ca/w/writer/ducks.html" rel="nofollow">http://mypage.direct.ca/w/writer/ducks.h...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.harteman.nl/omnibus/hybrids/index2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.harteman.nl/omnibus/hybrids/i...</a><br>  <br>  The problem with hybrids in the wild are how the close species have diverged.

White tailed deer can still cross with mule deer but the hybrids are disadvantaged because the parent species have evolved very different methods of escaping predation. White deer dash and mule deer bound. Hybrids are easier prey than their parent species but they are fertile and produce viable offspring.

Males tend to be slightly larger than females and have slightly bigger heads, but there is not a great variation in cheetah sizes and it is difficult to tell males and females apart by appearance alone. <br>  <br>  <br>  Food source?<br>  <br>  <br>  The cheetah is a carnivore, eating mostly mammals under 40 kg (88 lb), including the Thomson's Gazelle, the Grant's gazelle, the springbok and the impala. The young of larger mammals such as wildebeests and zebras are taken at times, and adults too, when the cats hunt in groups. Guineafowl and hares are also prey. While the other big cats mainly hunt by night, the cheetah is a diurnal hunter. It hunts usually either early in the morning or later in the evening when it is not so hot, but there is still enough light.<br>  <br>  The cheetah hunts by vision rather than by scent. Prey is stalked to within 10–30 m (33–98 ft), then chased. This is usually over in less than a minute, and if the cheetah fails to make a catch quickly, it will give up. The cheetah has an average hunting success rate of around 50% - half of its chases result in failure.|`|qJXdyUY3aa	Cheetahs are so freakin' cool!! I love those cats. But anyway-<br>  <br>  Cheetahs weigh 70-140 as adults and 150-300g as newborns. They live about 7-8 years in the wild and 12-15 years in captivity. As I'm sure you know, cheetahs are the fastest land animal. They can reach a speed of 45mph in two seconds flat, and can sprint at 65-70mph for a short period of time. They are definitely built for speed, too. Their bodies are aerodynamic in addition to a flexible spine, hard footpads and pretty short retractable claws for traction, enlarged nostrils for increased oxygen intake, and a tail that acts as a rudder and stabilizer while running. On top of all of this, they've got a very powerful heart and strong arteries to keep blood flowing, which supplies oxygen to the muscles needed while running at high speeds. Pretty awesome, huh?<br>  Cheetahs are carnivores, so their diet consists of meat. In the wild, their diet primarily is made up of (but is not limited to) gazelle. Cheetahs in the wild usually hunt every 2-5 days, unless they have cubs, then they must hunt everyday. <br>  <br>  I've barely scratched the surface of information about these cats, here's a couple more informative websites I found that I think will help ya learn more.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Acinonyx_jubatus.html" rel="nofollow">http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/si...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.awf.org/content/wildlife/detail/cheetah" rel="nofollow">http://www.awf.org/content/wildlife/deta...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.defenders.org/wildlife_and_habitat/wildlife/cheetah.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.defenders.org/wildlife_and_ha...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/219" rel="nofollow">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/219</a>|`|ZsKrYCYCaa	<a href="http://www.tigerhomes.org/animal/curriculums/cheetah-information-pc.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tigerhomes.org/animal/curricu...</a>
qF5T3vZiaa	Lots of biotechs hire mol biologists with master's degrees. Your master's included an independent research project, so you have "real" research experience, right? I.e., not just canned lab classes.<br>  <br>  That's the biggest requirement. Companies are less likely to take a chance on someone who doesn't have some kind of real research experience. Obviously, work experience is best, but masters research and even independent research study projects as an undergrad will help.<br>  <br>  After that, the requirements depend on the particular company and the position. Lots of times companies want not just someone with a mol bio degree, but someone with specific skills in a particular area of mol bio, or experience with a particular technique.<br>  <br>  As a fresh MS student, you'll want to emphasize your ability to learn new techniques, your attention to detail, your ability to follow direction when required and to work independently when required. Be able to cite specific examples to show you can do this (preferably from your MS thesis research).<br>  <br>  I'm not really sure what people are paying new MS grads in mol bio these days, but $50K certainly seems reasonable. Depends on what part of the country, how well you fit their requirements, etc.<br>  <br>  Check out the website below. It lists lots of biotech companies in different geographical areas, has a career centers, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

R0Ogy5qlaa	An inflection point is defined to be where the concavity changes.  So not all examples where the 2nd derivative is 0 or undefined have to be inflection points.<br>  <br>  For example, the curve y = x^4 has a point at the origin where y'' is zero.  This curve has no inflection points.  <br>  <br>  For another, the curve y = x^(2/3) has a point at the origin where y'' doesn't exist.  This is not an inflection point, either, it is a cusp.  <br>  <br>  The curve y = x^(4/3) has a point at the origin where y'' doesn't exist but y' = 0.  So, this is a stationary point. It also happens to not be an inflection point.  <br>  <br>  Finally, the curve y = x^(1/3) has a point at the origin where the first and second derivatives don't exist but it is an inflection point, since the concavity changes from positive to negative there.|`|HTmj2BXDaa	The first derivitive is slope, the second derivative is curvature so, when the curvature changes from positive to negative (which = 0), it is defined (=0).

2lQ8DJAcaa	The most prominent scientific theory about the origin of the Earth involves a spinning cloud of dust called a solar nebula. This nebula is a product of the Big Bang. Philosophers, religious scholars and scientists have lots of ideas about where the universe came from, but the most widely-held scientific theory is the Big Bang Theory. According to this theory, the universe originated in an enormous explosion.<br>  <br>  The Big Bang Model is a broadly accepted theory for the origin and evolution of our universe. It postulates that 12 to 14 billion years ago, the portion of the universe we can see today was only a few millimeters across. It has since expanded from this hot dense state into the vast and much cooler cosmos we currently inhabit. We can see remnants of this hot dense matter as the now very cold cosmic microwave background radiation which still pervades the universe and is visible to microwave detectors as a uniform glow across the entire sky.<br>  map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/bb_theory.h|`|OGw6Upv8aa	both the big bang and evolution are amply supported by observational end experimental evidence. the only ppl who question them have religious hangups.<br>  <br>  go away, troll.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	Sorry, not a Banger.|`|F6IOLf3Aaa	I don't know how serious you are about learning the truth but here are a couple of wonderful sources:<br>  <br>  Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity<br>  <a href="http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=8050" rel="nofollow">http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclo...</a><br>  course 8050, sale $129.95<br>  <br>  Cosmology: The History and Nature of Our Universe<br>  <a href="http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=1830&pc=HomePageFeature" rel="nofollow">http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclo...</a><br>  course 1830, sale $99.95<br>  <br>  These are two extremely well done college level DVD courses that addresses in a very thoughtful and accurate up-to-date fashion all the elements of your question.

723c7cb5953ba3908aba706688deac1aaa	There could be life already on Mars. The conditions on the surface of Mars are somewhat different to the conditions on the surface of the Earth, so life on Mars would probably be somewhat different to the obvious (to us) life on the surface of the Earth.<br>  <br>  Life has been found on Earth in places, and in conditions, where it was thought, until fairly recently, that life would be practically impossible. There is abundant life around the "black smokers" in the deep oceans where it is completely dark, very hot, and, I think, in chemical conditions that we humans would consider very corrosive. <br>  <br>  Water in a liquid form is often considered to be essential for life. I think that water has been found on Mars. Recently, chemicals (perchlorates) have been found or suspected which might help life. Maybe life without water is possible.<br>  <br>  Finding an environment on Mars where humans (in our present form) could live, I think is very unlikely. The surface is certainly not habitable for unprotected humans (too cold, atmospheric pressure too low, wrong gases, too much incoming radiation).<br>  <br>  An enclosed environment for humans would certainly be possible, at least for a short time. Longer term there would be issues about food, air, and probably psychological ones.<br>  <br>  In the very long term maybe the whole planet could be habitable: "terraforming": but humans are having trouble keeping our existing planet habitable - changing one that is so different to make it habitable would be so mauch harder.|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	There is no possibility of finding life on Mars. To have life you must have water in liquid form which is not available anywhere in our solar system except on Earth. There seems to be some deep empty canals like there might have been rivers. But most of them were due to impacts of asteroids or some previous form of water which is not there anymore. Also the atmosphere on Mars is very thin which can not preserve any gases or water vapor to have clouds and rain later. Also the temperature is very cold due to that. In order to have life you need a big bubble that resembles earth's atmosphere and have water. Which is impossible...

A habitable planet needs a location from its parent star where water naturally occurs in all three states, called the 'Habitable Zone' Mars isn't in this zone.<br>  <br>  An environment where humans could live?

X1OUnP0Kaa	there are no creatures on mars, we know this we have 2 rovers on mars and a satellite in orbit. we haven't seen any life, the best chances for life are microscopic germs which are still a possibility.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	Unknown.<br>  But none of the rovers or orbiting probes have found any evidence of any kind of life on Mars.<br>  There is water ice under the surface, but so far no evidence of life.|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	There is no possibility of finding life on Mars. To have life you must have water in liquid form which is not available anywhere in our solar system except on Earth. There seems to be some deep empty canals like there might have been rivers. But most of them were due to impacts of asteroids or some previous form of water which is not there anymore. Also the atmosphere on Mars is very thin which can not preserve any gases or water vapor to have clouds and rain later. Also the temperature is very cold due to that. In order to have life you need a big bubble that resembles earth's atmosphere and have water. Which is impossible... I took that in Astronomy in University...|`|m2BCAdD3aa	There *was life in mars, it used to have an atmoshphere, a very light one which was probably blown away due to suns solar winds, still there are evidence of dead martian creatures, mostly unicellular organisms and very few multicellular ones-. tough scientist predict the water is flowing under the surface of mars hosting a soup of life full of martian cellular activity|`|5gG42iOpaa	None of our tests have proven positive for life on Mars.<br>  <br>  If there is it has to be microscopic hidden in the ground and very different biology from our own.

2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	The reason is that the phase of the moon as we see it from Earth has to do with the moon's position in relation to the sun (from our perspective).  As the moon moves around the Earth, the Earth is also moving around the sun.<br>  <br>  So from full moon, the moon moves around the Earth during the following 27.3 days.  But in that time, the Earth has moved about one twelfth of the way around the sun, so the position of the sun in our sky has changed.  The moon needs some extra time (2.2 days) to catch up to be in the same position relative to the sun.|`|723c7cb5953ba3908aba706688deac1aaa	The rotation of the Moon around its own axis is not the same thing as it going round the Earth, BUT they do take the same amount of time for the Earth's moon, which is why the Moon always has (roughly) the same side always turned towards the Earth. <br>  <br>  Starting with a full-moon (Sun, Earth, Moon (roughly) in a straight line), consider the Moon going round the Earth once. The Earth has moved a little way round the Sun in the meanwhile (all the bits rotate in the same direction by the way). The Moon needs to go a little bit further to get to the straight line position again.<br>  <br>  If this is not clear, exaggerate the situation a bit by pretending that the Earth has done a quarter orbit of the Sun while the Moon goes round the Earth once.|`|gGmMw2vDaa	These numbers are not related. The full moon has to do with revolution about the earth and relationship to the sun, not about rotation on its own axis.
2fW267GMaa	First if you have never eaten shrooms before DO NOT take 5 grams the first time.  That is a very large dose for most individuals and could really put you in a place you don't want to be.  3 grams or less would be a much better idea in my opinion.<br>  <br>  As far as the amount.  A gram is just a unit of weight and different shrooms weigh different amounts.  3-5 grams in this case is referring to dried shrooms.  3-5 grams of freshly picked shrooms is about 90% water.  Assuming you have dried shrooms I suggest you get a nice jewelery or postal scale and weigh them out via that.  Its good knowing just how many you are ingesting.  Be safe and have fun!|`|WbzdAJgdaa	your kidding.  it all depends on the mushrooms themselves theres nothing that says how many shrooms it exactly is.

TKHHRUB4aa	Neither:<br>  Advantages<br>  <br>  There are many advantages to genetically modified food. GM foods can be made to be resistant to many diseases, weeds, pests and herbicides. They can even be made to be drought or flood tolerant. They can grow faster and have more nutrients than other crops while not going bad as quickly. They are also cheaper for farmers as you don't need to use chemical sprays. These traits could be the solution to third world hunger. The crops in poorer countries wouldn't be destroyed so easily after every drought or flood. They would be able to grow faster and there would be more of them as they are resistant to pests. The crops would also be healthier for people because iron and other minerals can be added to them, removing malnutrition problems.<br>  <br>  Another advantage is that in the future, foods could be modified to make edible vaccines, like bananas that protect us against Hepatitius B. Edible vaccines would make large scale immunisations against diseases easier, painless and more accessible. Instead of waiting in line for a doctor you could eat a tomato.<br>  <br>  <br>  Disadvantages:<br>  <br>  Despite the many advantages to genetically modified foods there are also many disadvantages. First and foremost is that genetically modified foods are new and it is impossible to know all the future effects it could have on human health and the environment. The risks and benefits of new technologies are only fully known after they have been in use for many years. An example is nuclear power, forty years ago it was thought that t could solve all the worlds problems with unlimited, cheap and safe energy. Only now do we know the full benefits and risks of nuclear power.<br>  <br>  Another disadvantage is the potential impact it could have to human health. The new genes that are put in food could be resistant to certain antibiotics; if we eat them the effectiveness of antibiotics could be reduced. New allergens could be accidentally created and known allergens could be transferred to other foods. For example, if a gene from peanuts was taken and put in a tomato, people allergic to peanuts could be allergic to that tomato. Most importantly, scientists can't actually prove whether genetically modified foods are 100% safe because normal toxicology tests do not work for food.<br>  <br>  There are many environmental problems involving genetically modified foods. These are mainly about pollination of plants. If genetically modified plants pollinate non-genetically modified plants this could spread them into the wild, where they could compete with other plants. This would upset the balance of nature, as these plants could easily take over. Plants that are made resistant to chemical herbicides could pollinate with weeds. This would be disastrous because then new, stronger sprays would have to be developed to counter them. This would increase ground and water contamination, something genetically modified plants are supposed to prevent.|`|H9OPAm4Kaa	sure, but i wouldn't eat it.

AA10164889	Your question is somewhat garbled, but we can attempt to answer what you seem to be asking.  Assuming you mean you want to know about the positive effects of hydro-electric power generation on society, the effects include:<br>  <br>  --The value of electricity.  Electricity provides light, heat, the pumping of clean water, communication, access to information through computers and television, entertainment, and many other positive values.<br>  <br>  --A relatively low environmental impact.  Because hydroelectric generation does not consume fossil fuels, it produces virtually no air or water pollution.  Hydro power is very environmentally friendly.  There can be environmental issues with power dams, as they may disrupt wildlife habitats and the general quality of the land, but on the whole, hydroelectric is the cleanest source of large scale power.<br>  <br>  --Reclamation.  Hydroelectric power installations also create recreation facilities for swimming, boating, fishing, and other activities involving access to water.  In addition, the water stored by a dam may be useful for irrigation and agricultural development.
PDcnXgE6aa	1) First biggest advantage is you r not producing any smoke......no SOX, NOX fresh environment....good for everybody..<br>  <br>  2) Water is not wasting....u r generating energy without use of our nonrenewable energy resources <br>  <br>  3)Cool Environment. <br>  4) Low cost energy|`|Qm6rDoJWaa	All energy generation choices, like all engineering decisions, like all decisions in general, involve trade-offs. For generating electrical power with water power, some trade-offs are:<br>  <br>  You need to build a dam to create a reservoir of water, and to allow you to control the use of that water reservoir to run your generator(s). The dam will create a lake, where there was previously a river or stream. On one hand, that lake put someone's land, and perhaps some houses, or even a whole town, under water. On the other hand, the lake might be a nice place to go boating, swimming, or fishing. Then again, the river might have been nice for whitewater rafting or canoeing. If the stream had been prone to flooding with seasonal variations in water flow, the amount of water that would flood a stream, probably won't make much difference in the level of the lake (because the seasonal variation might have been several times the normal stream flow, but probably isn't significant in comparison to the water volume of the lake), so flooding may no longer be an issue. Also, the water reservoir might be good for supplying drinking water to a nearby town, or irrigation water to nearby farms. As you see, there's both positive and negative to the change from a stream to a lake.<br>  <br>  Now, you use the water flow to generate electricity. That's good for people who use electricity. Our society is able to avoid most of the human misery common in primitive societies by using inexpensive energy as a substitute for human labor. Think what life would be like if you had to grow your own food, and dig or chop wood, coal, or peat for your heat. Cheap, abundant energy allows us to farm using machinery, transport the food over a wide area, and transport ourselves easily from place to place. It also lets us use machinery to wash our clothes (ever wash out a shirt by hand?), cook our food (ever gather wood and cook over a fire on a camping trip?), have light when we want it (ever make candles? ever try to read by them?), and on and on.<br>  <br>  Of course, there are trade-offs for the hydro plant, too. Fish can't swim upstream to spawn, if there's a dam in the way. Fish ladders are only somewhat effective in providing a path. If the lake is in a remote area, additional land must be devoted to roads to get to the dam to build and maintain it, and to the electric power transmission lines (those wires on big towers) to get the power to where people will use it. On the other hand, perhaps the dam, roads, transmission lines, flooded houses (if they were), etc., have less impact than alternative methods of generating electrical power (coal, gas, oil, nuclear, solar, wind, or whatever). Then again, perhaps not. It's a matter of trade-offs.<br>  <br>  HTH

PS0oSoXFaa	Well molecular shape is a lot easier than you might expect. All you have to do is look for areas of "electron density"- either bonds or lone pairs. Double and triple bonds still count just as one area of electron density. So count up how of these areas there are; three or four is typical, but you can have more or less.<br>  <br>  Elecrons repel, whether they're in bonds or as lone pairs; so each area of electron density will repel the others. The bonds/ lone pairs will then go as far away from each other as they can. This is why molecules have such predictable shapes; regardles of what elements are involved, the electrons will always repel in the same way. For this you just have to look at the pictures. But three areas of electron density will take a trigonal planar arrangement; four areas will make it tetrahedral, and five will make it "trigonal bipyramidal". Easy. This is the first step- this tells you the "electron arrangement," but not yet the shape. <br>  <br>  To get the actual shape, you "subtract" lone pairs while still considering their repelling effect. Lone pairs aren't shown on the shape, but you know they're there from the "hole" they leave. PO3 has three bonds and one lone pair. There are three bonds that appear in the shape, then, but there are *four* areas of electron density- so it's not trigonal planar. So you take the tetrahedral shape (for four electron areas) and remove one "bond" while keeping the shape otherwise intact; this leaves you with "trigonal pyramidal." The three bonds are pushed into a pyramid shape because the lone pair is still there repelling them. Again, you have to look at the pictures, but it's not hard :)
AA10164889	Traditionally, medical schools have offered a course in human anatomy in which every student had the opportunity to dissect--usually in a team setting with one or two partners--a complete human cadaver.  This has always been a great complication and expense for medical schools, and increasingly the study of human anatomy for medical purposes is being done using 3-d computer images, rather than actual dead people.<br>  <br>  Where cadavers are used, they are generally referred to by the euphemism "anatomical materials," and there is an officer of the institution called the Curator of Anatomical Materials, who is responsible for the care of these bodies.<br>  <br>  They are kept in a freezer for obvious reasons.  If they are not kept frozen they rot and smell bad pretty soon.  In the freezer they are usually kept lying flat on shelves, but they may occasionally be hung up on hooks, by passing the point of the hook through the flesh between two ribs near the upper thoracic vertebrae.<br>  <br>  Medical schools in the US have traditionally purchased cadavers from developing countries, paying $2,500 or so for each.  Some people donate their bodies to medical science, which provides a source of cadavers in addition to the street trade.  Some curators actively seek cadavers that died of certain conditions that are in the forefront of scientific study, or who had certain types of anatomical oddities or deformities.<br>  <br>  Yes, they do hang them on hooks, though that has not been the usual practice for several decades.<br>  <br>  Sweet dreams!

3DrSrzHAaa	(PhD physicist answers)  The conduction of electricity (or heat.  the same physical process governs both heat conduction and electrical conduction.) is caused by free electrons in the substance.  The more free electrons, and the less binding force they feel means the substance has better conductivity.  Metals have free electrons and those electrons are less tightly bound, so they conduct well.  this is why metals are "shiny", because the sea of free electrons reflect  light waves. when you look at a metal, you are actually "seeing" the free electrons.  Actually, Copper isn't the best conductor metal.  Gold is the best, then silver, then copper, then Iron.  All of these are "transition"metals in the periodic table and have two electrons that  can be freed for conduction.  Gold holds on to them the least, silver a little tighter,copper a little tighter yet, and so on.|`|uCzSEgT6aa	Actually gold is not the best.

9Xur3g9Paa	It is highly unlikely that a person would die from a single dose of a drug, but it depends on several factors including what type of drug are are talking about.  For example, an adult dose of a narcotic or depressant could kill an infant or small child.  Similarly, a street drug laced with a toxin could kill you also with just one dose.  I have seen several cases of butane abuse in which the users died during a single episode of use.  However, normal doses of "recreational" drugs taken to get high (not totally FU) rarely produce fatal reactions.  They do have other side effects including addiction and schizoaffective disorder in the case of high doses of drugs like Meth, Angel Dust (PCP), and other hallucinogenic stimulants.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	1.  One overdose is all it takes, but keep in mind that an overdose does not mean death all the time.  You can overdose on vitamin C for cryin' out loud.<br>  <br>  2.  Exactly like someone you think is dead or dying.  Eyes not moving, puking, pain, passing out, etc.|`|DhLIo8nbaa	Yes you can die after one overdose, it could be any opiates, any benzos, sleeping pills, almost anything.  Opiates are anything fomr oxycontin, vicodan, percocet, morphene.  Benzos are xanax, valium, klonopin.  Sleeping pills like aderall, trazadone.  Basiaclly anything that you take too much of even cough syrup can kill you, but it all depends on what happens.  If you overdose on an opiate and you have someone around you then they could call the paramedics and they happen to get their in time then they could give you narcan and it could possible bring a person out of it, and that does not guarentee that they will be okay if it does work, because it all depends on how long the person is out because once they overdose they are losing oxygen to the brain and they could wake up and be brain dead.  So yes anyone could die from their first overdose, some people never overdose, and some people die on their 10th overdose, but one does not have to do with the other.  It does not seem like you have alot of knowledge on this subject so if you are writing a story on this then you should really research it and talk to addicts who have been in this situation and who have overdosed or who have had friends who have overdosed.  there are alot of good recovery websites where people share their stories and you might find those helpful.

6KaMW1Vzaa	There are two worries: acute toxicity after a single large overdose, and chronic toxicity after taking lesser but still substantial amounts every day.  The latter is the reason for the recommendation that the maximum daily dose be limited to four grams. For acute toxicity, it's just possible, though quite unlikely, to have liver damage with as little as 150 mg/kg body weight. For a woman who weighs 132 lbs. (60 kg), that's 9 grams, or eighteen 500 mg tablets. If you're serious about doing yourself in, though, you'll need at least three times that dose, and you'll need to avoid vomiting, which is common in people who take that many pills at once.|`|DXh2BlCraa	Tylenol is NOT something you should take lightly. It is the number one cause of medication induced liver failure. You can have major liver damage and not even know it. I would go to the doctor and get liver enzymes drawn to make sure no damage has already occured. I would NEVER take more than the prescribe dose on the bottle. And if you are running a continuous fever or something alternate it with motrin.<br>  <br>  And by the way, living with liver failure is a miserable life.|`|kkJcYGVUaa	Well seriously. in one overdose. It's been sometime since I read this so. I don't have facts. But I was researching it myself sometime back . and whatever overdose you did take. a whole bottle of 250-500? or less? if it were to stay in your system without help, no stomach pump, nothing for I think I read like 14 hours or so, after that you are a goner. There is nothing a hospital or doctor can do to help you (save your life) But I tell you, it wouldn't be pretty. You would be in soooo much pain. I guaranty it would not be the way to go. Not worth it. But it wouldn't matter how much. it makes you so sick. If your thinking of trying. Don't.

The first type is, like my daughters, identical in appearance, handedness etc etc  (although in my daughters' case there are differences in height and weight.)   Then there are mirror identical twins who are mirror images of each other, from the way their hair parts or swirls to their dominant hand.  It is particulary common with conjoined twins, and it has to do with when the embryo splits.  If it splits early, you tend to get the first type of identical twin, and when it splits later you get mirror image twins.  This is why conjoined twins tend to have different handedness. <br>  <br>   I know of several sets of mirror identical twins (through our local multiple birth group) with different handedness.|`|WVPYem5Vaa	If the twins are identical, they should, genetically, have the same handedness.

If they give you a urine test then you should pass it within 10-12 days after your last use.  But do not listen to what people will tell you on here because it will get you into more trouble.  If you drink a ton of water then when you urinate it is going to come out pure water and we can tell.  If you put bleach in it then we can smell the bleach the second we open the cup.  If you try to use someone elses urine then it will never match your body temperature, there is a temp strip on the cup and it measures the temp the socond the urine hits the cup and it needs to match an actual body temp.  And those ove rthe counter cleansers just do not work at all and neither does niacin, which we can also detect in the drug test.  I work in a drug rehab, and it is for offenders who were let out of jail early to come to rehab before they are released, and I have to say that I would give someone more leeway who was honest with me and told me they were going to fail, but the people who try to use those stupid methods I send right back to jail because they are not honest.  So if the 10 days has not passed then your best bet is to just tell them what happened.  But if your in a detention center then I dont understand how you would even have access to marijuana and you should definately not be doing it there because eventually you will get caught and I dont know your age but they can eventually trial you as an adult and put you in real jail, and I can promise you its nothing like Juvenile detention centers.|`|vR49RPMmaa	how about you QUIT.<br>  you shouldn't be smoking anyways that stuff messes with you.|`|IkgyyPtYaa	Coal|`|tnxPjwzeaa	mabe dont smoke anymore and u wont have that problem!!!|`|30xRk9EUaa	1st if you are skinny drink lots and lots of water. the triple antioxidant vitamin water, tea, and sweat alot.. that should work<br>  <br>  2nd if you're not skinny, try the same thing but good luck getting it to work|`|CYeWFPcoaa	ok well <br>  drink a lot of water, sweat a lot and pee a lot as well, you can also drink cranberry juice|`|51taaNIFaa	i heard that if you drink five hour energy after you smoke it clears it out pretty fast|`|aqGLKCxyaa	Dude, drop the drugs. <br>  then you will pass no problem.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck !
2lQ8DJAcaa	Divergent boundaries occur along spreading centers where plates are moving apart and new crust is created by magma pushing up from the mantle. Picture two giant conveyor belts, facing each other but slowly moving in opposite directions as they transport newly formed oceanic crust away from the ridge crest. <br>  Perhaps the best known of the divergent boundaries is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This submerged mountain range, which extends from the Arctic Ocean to beyond the southern tip of Africa, is but one segment of the global mid-ocean ridge system that encircles the Earth. The rate of spreading along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge averages about 2.5 centimeters per year (cm/yr), or 25 km in a million years. This rate may seem slow by human standards, but because this process has been going on for millions of years, it has resulted in plate movement of thousands of kilometers. Seafloor spreading over the past 100 to 200 million years has caused the Atlantic Ocean to grow from a tiny inlet of water between the continents of Europe, Africa, and the Americas into the vast ocean that exists today. <br>  <br>  The size of the Earth has not changed significantly during the past 600 million years, and very likely not since shortly after its formation 4.6 billion years ago. The Earth's unchanging size implies that the crust must be destroyed at about the same rate as it is being created, as Harry Hess surmised. Such destruction (recycling) of crust takes place along convergent boundaries where plates are moving toward each other, and sometimes one plate sinks (is subducted) under another. The location where sinking of a plate occurs is called a subduction zone. <br>  The type of convergence -- called by some a very slow "collision" -- that takes place between plates depends on the kind of lithosphere involved. Convergence can occur between an oceanic and a largely continental plate, or between two largely oceanic plates, or between two largely continental plates. <br>  <br>  The zone between two plates sliding horizontally past one another is called a transform-fault boundary, or simply a transform boundary. The concept of transform faults originated with Canadian geophysicist J. Tuzo Wilson, who proposed that these large faults or fracture zones connect two spreading centers (divergent plate boundaries) or, less commonly, trenches (convergent plate boundaries). Most transform faults are found on the ocean floor. They commonly offset the active spreading ridges, producing zig-zag plate margins, and are generally defined by shallow earthquakes. However, a few occur on land, for example the San Andreas fault zone in California. This transform fault connects the East Pacific Rise, a divergent boundary to the south, with the South Gorda -- Juan de Fuca -- Explorer Ridge, another divergent boundary to the north.<br>  <br>  Volcanos are most commonly found at subduction zone boundaries. This is where the thinner oceanic plates get pulled under the thicker continental plates. As the plates go deeper, they melt and form pockets of magma which can cause mountains to be built and as the hot magma rises, it erupts out of volcanos. One area that this is very evident is along the Andes Mountains in South America. Also, the Sierra Nevada was formed this way and the granite of the Sierra Nevada was formed by the very slow cooling of silica rich magma.

It was described to them, through Nancy L. by the inhabitants of a planet around Zeta Reticuli.  Planet X was going to cause the end-of-the-world in... 2003.  They had a book for sale on how to survive the passage of Planet X.<br>  <br>  Oops, 2003 has come and gone.  That's OK.  They revised the book.  They used the date picked by José A. for the end of the Mayan calendar.  <br>  <br>  Except that the Mayan calendar does not end.  The (fake) idea that it ends was invented by José in the late 1980s, when he wanted to sell books about his understanding of the Meso-American calendars.<br>  <br>  The charlatans also added features from the (fake) planet Nibiru (invented by Zecharia S. in the late 1960s -- in his story, Nibiru returns in 2085).<br>  <br>  They also added features from Nemesis, a hypothetical brown dwarf companion to our Sun, from a theory that was finally dropped in the 1990s (Nemesis was to return in roughly 20 million years... give or take).<br>  <br>  The charlatans then created the (fake) documentaries that have been shown on the Hysteric Channel and on YouTube (of which you found the original one).<br>  <br>  They also invented most the the "ancient prophesies" which were, conveniently, all unknown prior to 2004 (otherwise, they would have clashed with their 2003 prediction).<br>  <br>  Ah.

There was not one Sibyl, but many, named by the location of their shrine.<br>  <br>  And we find the later Tiburtine Sibyl - an Etruscean or Roman Sibyl, which appeared later in 380 CE and had an apocalyptic prophecy. History Channel and their pseudo-expert, claim it was 6 BC, and also claim it was in Rome.

The water (with dissolved minerals) enters the root xylem. The xylem is essentially a series of cells that have been joined into an open tube that runs from the root to the leaf. Trans means across while aspirare means to breathe. Thus plants transpire their water from soil to leaf through the sapwood vesicles. Once at the leaf the water evaporates. The capillary action of the water molecules draws more water up the column as the water evaporates from the leaf.<br>  Transpiration pull and root pressure moves water.<br>  <a href="http://plantphys.info/plant_physiology/transpire.html" rel="nofollow">http://plantphys.info/plant_physiology/t...</a><br>  Transpiration and properties of water<br>  <a href="http://generalhorticulture.tamu.edu/lectsupl/Water/water.html" rel="nofollow">http://generalhorticulture.tamu.edu/lect...</a><br>  Animation of water & sucrose movement in xylem & phloem<br>  <a href="http://academic.kellogg.cc.mi.us/herbrandsonc/bio111/animations/0032.swf" rel="nofollow">http://academic.kellogg.cc.mi.us/herbran...</a><br>  Capillary action<br>  <a href="http://www.uni.edu/~iowawet/H2OProperties.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uni.edu/~iowawet/H2OPropertie...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Water is rate limiting to the photosynthetic reaction so its loss rate is carefully regulated.

You see, there are vessels or tubes in the roots of a wide range of plants that act like straws to suck up moisture from the surrounding soil. This ability is basically the ability of a liquid to cling to the narrow sides of tubes, known as capillarity. Without capillary actions (occurring in plants), the plants would die, and since other living organisms depend on the growth of plants (including humans) those creatures would be next in line for extinction. Basically, no capillary action in plants = big screw up with the food chain, and the order of the ecosystem... hope this helps (:

The length of time for the Earth to rotate once with respect to the stars is 23 hours, 56 minutes (called sidereal day).  The time for the Earth to rotate once so that the sun is in the same place in our sky is 24 hours (called its solar day). <br>  <br>  The sun changes magnetic polarity every 11 years (on average).

So if the Earth stopped orbiting, then it would simply 'fall' towards the Sun.  <br>  <br>  Asker:  The orbital speed of Earth is faster than the rotational speed of the Earth.  If the Earth stopped orbiting the Sun, then there would effectively be no day for Earth anymore, as the Earth would 'fall' into the Sun; as other people have stated.

Second, you stated that if the Earth stopped orbiting, it would 'fly' out of the Solar System.  That is simply incorrect because if it stops orbiting it has no orbital speed, which inherently means no tangential velocity.  I.e. why your statement is wrong.<br>  <br>  By the way, you just stated that what I said was what you meant by violation of the law of conservation of angular momentum, and then you go on to say that what I said was illogical and that I don't understand physics.

The army corps of engineers did nothing wrong in the case of New Orleans.  The engineers didn't decide that New Orleans only needed levies that could withstand a Category 3 hurricane.  Though admittedly I fail to see the relevance of this topic to the question and statements made previously.<br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  <br>  Just noticed you said I didn't understand inertia, and it occurred to me that I think we are interpreting the idea of a cessation of orbit differently.  It seems as though you are taking the idea of the Earth no longer orbiting the Sun as the Earth attaining enough tangential velocity to escape the gravitational interaction between the Earth and Sun (correct me if I am wrong); whereas I am interpreting the same statement as meaning the Earth stops its orbital motion completely but stays gravitationally bound to the Solar System.  If this is the case then I can see where are disagreement stems from I think.<br>  <br>  P.S. I don't claim to be a physics major.  I am one.<br>  <br>  P.P.S.  If I am correct about what you were thinking for a cessation of orbit then the conservation of angular momentum does not apply because the Earth-Sun system is no longer a closed system because an outside force must have been applied to Earth in order to increase it's tangential velocity enough for the Earth to become gravitationally unbound.  Thus the law of conservation of angular momentum would not have been broken.|`|KHSOVxViaa	If the Earth stopped circling, it would fall into the Sun.

2lQ8DJAcaa	Calcite is mostly found in sedimentary rock.  Calcite turns into the rock called limestone. Some limestone is made when sea creatures die and their skeletons and shells fall to the bottom of the ocean.  They pile on top of each other, push on the lower layers, and the pressure makes limestone.    All limestone starts in water.  There are places in the middle of the United States where there used to be a sea.  The water has been gone for millions of years.  Even though it’s dry now, limestone can be found there.  If you add pressure and high heat to limestone, it changes into marble, a metamorphic rock.<br>   <br>   How and where is it mined?  Calcite is mined using quarrying or underground mining.  If the calcite is not far underground, then quarrying is used.  If it is too far underground for quarrying to work, then underground mining is used.  It is found in New Jersey [Franklin], Tennessee, Illinois, and other states of the U.S.; Mexico, Germany, India, England, and other parts of the world.<br>   <br>   What is it used for?  Calcite/limestone is used for making glass, paper, photography, statues, building, and animal food.  The Ancient Egyptian Sphinx [below] is made of limestone.

o04hl9ZFaa	Eukaryotic cells, by far. They are 50-100 times larger. A main reason is that they simply have more to hold and more tasks to perform. Having membrane bound organelles and DNA encased in a plasma membrane, there is a lot more going on in a eukaryotic cell than a prokaryotic cell. It's like an office building versus a house. Another reason Eukaryotic cells are so large are due to their cytoskeleton, which gives them structure as they grow larger. Prokaryotes do not have this structural support. Finally, eukaryotes have larger genomes than prokaryotes, meaning they have more protein products to express.

i1jV0xIGaa	Heat causes kinetic energy or motion<br>  <br>  water molecules in ice, at -10 degrees, upon warming will begin to vibrate or oscillate = try to move around until 0 degrees C is reached. At 0 C, heat input goes into breaking the water-water hydrogen bonds in the ice crystal so that individual molecules of water can begin to move around. This process does not increase vibration, etc - it is a bond breaking process, and the temperature remains at O C until all of the ice is melted.  Once melted, heat input will once again increase molecular vibrations and will also induce motion. Molecules will move faster and faster until 100 C is reached.  Once again, heat input goes into separation of the molecules into the gas state - kinetic energy is not increased.  After all molecules have been freed from the liquid state, the resulting gas can be further heated with an increase in molecular motion until 120 degrees is reached.<br>  <br>  The transitions at 0 degrees and 100 degrees are phase changes (melting, boiling) and in general require much more heat input that that required to simply raise the temperature ( increase molecular speed)

Gnfc4wRlaa	No, it isn’t.  None of the claims by the doomsday prophets are based on science, just wild speculation.<br>  The Mayans didn’t predict doomsday.  It is just the end of the current cycle of their Long Count calendar.<br>  Nostradamus didn’t predict it.  He never mentioned 2012 and all the Nostradamus "quotes" being thrown around aren't what he actually wrote. They are what some people have decided that he meant. Even Nostradamus scholars don't agree on how the various centuries and quatrains should be interpreted.<br>  The Bible never mentions 2012 or references it in any way.  It talks about the end times, but there is no mention of when.<br>  <br>  There is no actual scientific theory or evidence that anything unusual is going to happen in 2012. It is a collection of myths and disproven theories being promulgated by doomsday predictors, who predict a new one every few years. <br>  This timing is based on the end of the current cycle of the Mayan long count calendar. Their calendar was done in ages or cycles and their years ended at the winter solstice.  The current cycle ends December 21, 2012.  The Mayans didn’t predict the end of the world, only the end of that cycle.<br>  <br>  Nibiru (Planet X) doesn't exist. Zecharia Sitchin is not a scientist, but is an author of books promoting the ancient astronaut theory for human origins. He attributes the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the Annunaki (or Nephilim) from a hypothetical planet named Nibiru in the solar system. The Doomsayers predicted that it was to hit Earth in 2003. Undaunted when it didn't show up, they just moved it out to 2012 to coincide with the end of the current cycle of the Mayan calendar. <br>  <br>  Alignment of Solar System with galactic plane – There is no galactic alignment occurring in 2012.  It takes 36 years to precess through galactic equator, and we will be 6 degrees off in 2012.  Even if we did have an alignment, it would have no effect on us.  The vast distances involved outweigh the effects of gravity.<br>  <br>  Planetary alignment – it is impossible for all the planets to form a straight line out from the Sun (or viewed superimposed on each other in the sky) because each planetary orbit is tilted slightly with respect to the Earth's orbit.  John Gribbin in the late 1970's book  The Jupiter Effect  predicted the end of the world would occur in 1983 due a once in a millennium planetary alignment.   The 1983 event was ALL the other planets lined up as seen in our view of the sky -- not in a straight line as most people would misinterpret with the term alignment.  In 1999, The Survival Center had claimed the destruction of the Earth to occur in May 2000 due to the "planetary alignment."<br>  <br>  Asteroid Apophis - the collision alert was for 2029, and was canceled after additional observations showed it would not hit us.<br>  <br>  Geomagnetic reversal - These reversals of the magnetic field have occurred in the past, as shown by magnetic striping, but we can’t predict when they will occur again.  However, the time between reversals is not constant, varying from less than 100,000 years, to tens of millions of years. <br>  <br>  Although fast by geological standards, reversals are by no means quick on the human time scale. They take roughly 5,000 years, with estimates ranging from 1,000 years to 8,000 years.<br>  <br>  Homo Erectus and their ancestors survived previous reversals. There is no evidence of any extinctions resulting from these reversals. Although the inspection of past reversals does not indicate biological extinctions, present society with its reliance on electricity and electromagnetic effects (e.g. radio, satellite communications) may be vulnerable to technological disruptions in the event of a full field reversal. <br>  <br>  Photon belt - We are not heading for a photon belt in the Pleiades. The earth isn't heading toward the Pleiades but away from them. In the 1850s it was conjectured that the earth orbited the Pleiades, but this has long since been discredited. No photon belt or other such region of increased energy has been discovered. Photons in any case are merely particles of electromagnetic energy, which we commonly experience as light. Upon exposure to excess photons the most common transformation of your being is sunburn. <br>  <br>  Solar flares – These do increase and decrease in an eleven year cycle. They haven't caused any serious problems in the past. The direct effects of solar flares are mainly related to communications and radio transmissions. We had a major series of solar flares in 2005.|`|OGw6Upv8aa	no. what makes you think (if that's the right word...) that something is going to happen?|`|stAeoUeSaa	Winter solstice- December 21, 2012 - is just the revealing of the 'antichrist' or the 'man of perdition' at the mid-point of what Christians call the 7 year Tribulation (just subtract 1260 days to get the start and add 1260 days to get the end). Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

There are many people with Mayan ancestry alive today, so the Mayans have not died technically. The Catholic Church did its best to wipe out their culture, but some of it still remains today.<br>  <br>  All that is going to happen on Dec. 21, 2012 is that the sun will align with the center of Milky Way galaxy on the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere. The dying of plants, the dying of the year, and, in the Mayan long count calendar, the end of the 13th cycle of 13,000 year cycles has a lot of symbolism attached. The Mayan calendar does not end. All that will happen is that the fourth Mayan "world" will die and the fifth Mayan world will be born with the beginning of new cycle of cycles. The Greco-Roman civilization equivalent is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, which happened 41 years ago (??). 13,000 years from 2012, the sun will align with the center of the Milky Way galaxy on the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, as long as the Earth's orbital parameters remain approximately the same. The only other thing that is predicted to happen in 2012 is that solar activity for solar activity cycle 24 will be at a maximum.<br>  <br>  The Mayan - Aztec sun-stone calendar is round. A round calendar cannot end.<br>  <br>  Ok. I'll try to explain a little more. Remember, this is important because it happens at a WINTER SOLSTICE in the northern hemipshere. The Sun will align within 1 degree of the center of the Milky Way Galaxy on a winter solstice as predicted by the Mayans. There is a radio/X-ray  star call Sagitarius A*, usually abbreviated Sag A*, at -6 degrees declination on the celestial sphere. Sag A* is not AT the center of the Milky Way galaxy. There is a 30 million solar mass black hole, a dimensional singulairty AT the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Anything else AT the center goes down the black hole, which is NOT made of the densenst material known. If you want to look toward the center of the Milky Way galaxy, go outside in mid August abhout half an hour after sunset. Look to the south. The Constellation Sagitarius has a famous asterism known as "The Teapot". Wait until it almost completely dark and you might be able to see the Milky Way running from Sagitarius through the Summer Triangle of the bright stars <br>  Altair in Aquila, Vega in Lyra, (which is straight overhead at sunset in mid-August), and Deneb in Cygnus, which is also known as the Northern Cross.|`|hTGu2ujeaa	Think of all the other times the end of the world has been predicted, has it happened? no.

What states are they in?<br>  <br>  At room temperature and pressure, water will be a liquid and oxygen will be a gas.  For this case, the oxygen has a much lower density than the water.<br>  <br>  <br>  At a pressure/temperature combination which results in gaseous water, both water and oxygen will be in gas phase.  For this case, assuming identical pressure and temperature, the water has a lower density.<br>  Remember, PV = nRT.<br>  Given identical pressure and temperature, any given volume will have an identical number of molecules.<br>  One water molecule (H2O) has an atomic mass of 1 + 1 + 16 = 18<br>  One Oxygen molecule (O2) has an atomic mass of 16 + 16 = 32<br>  Therefore, the water vapor is less dense.<br>  <br>  If both water and oxygen are in liquid form, the water is slightly less dense.  Keep in mind, though that liquid oxygen at standard pressure will be very cold (-183 celsius).

F6IOLf3Aaa	Genetic engineering involves the isolation of specific gene sequence in the genome of a given biological organism, extract that gene sequence (usually with its operator/promoter) using something called a restriction enzyme.  Then, using the very same restriction enzyme, slice open the genome (usually a DNA sequence in a chromosome) in another organism, insert the gene sequence from the first organism, and then seal it with a specific enzyme for that purpose.  If the new gene and operator/promoter sequence is successfully taken up by the second biological organism, that organism will start producing a new gene product or protein which, in some desirable fashion, has changed the second organism.  That's basic genetic engineering.<br>  <br>  Bio-companies that make use of genetic engineering are quiet varied and many.

E0U2yII3aa	As a star ages, its magnetic activity becomes the more dominant force in its rotation. A young star would be rotating madly due to the angular momentum it got from its parent nebula. When it ages, magnetic activity dominates. The large magnetic field coils released from the core anchors the whole star making it rotate more slowly. In fact, rotation is a good indicator of star age. The longer is a star's rotational period, then the older can a star be. For the sun, the rotational speed of 2km/sec and an average rotational period of 25days suggests a middle age G star of 4.6 billion years.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~jkaler/sow/sun.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~jkaler/sow/su...</a>|`|1UPwDfJgaa	the fact that our solar system is expanding.

My 18 month old was prescribed antibiotics and he had to take them 4 times daily so I did it every three hours and he was fine.  They prescribe you that much because you obviously need them so you can recover from whatever illness you have.  The doctors have been trained and went to school for a very long time so they do know what they are doing, and sometimes you just need to take it that many times, so if you took it every 4 hours then you could take it at 8am, 12pm, 4pm, 8pm, and 12am .

It is just a big, very sensitive radio receiver connected to a (usually large) radio antenna.  The only thing "telescope" about it is that it is used to observe the stars--or more correctly, it is used to observe radio sources in outer space.  The radio and the antenna are both designed to receive the signals that are of interest to the astronomer using the radio telescope.<br>  <br>  I have never heard the term satellite telescope, perhaps you are refering to something like the Hubble Space Telescope, which is a "normal" telescope in a satellite.  Normal is in quotes because there's nothing normal about it, except when it comes right down to it, it's just a telescope...a very expensive one, but if we had not sent it into orbit, we could have rigged it up here on earth and put an eyepiece in it and looked at the stars, just like any other telescope.  The HST does have some gadgets and gizmos other than the basic telescope to look at the stars with, and it has transmitting equipment, antennas, computers, and guidance equipment and so on so astronomers can control it.|`|Pzl1R6dHaa	they are other forms of telescope such as microwave ones.optical and radio are the most common, Satellite telescopes don't have to worry about light pollution and atmosphere distortion.

Further to this, they also enable us to see more "detail" at radio wavelengths.  This detail is then converted via computer software into different colours according to the intensity of emissions.<br>  <br>  Because radiowaves have a much longer wavelength than visible light, we need to make the primary collector much bigger.  This isn't so much of a problem though as the curved surface of a dish type radio telescope doesn't need to be as accurately figured as it does for optical telescopes.<br>  <br>  So the answer to the question is yes - in terms of what they do, radio telescopes are just the same as normal or optical telescopes.<br>  <br>  Interestingly the amount of radio energy that has been recieved on Earth from space is still less than that which is produced each time a snowflake hits the ground.|`|066a3072b2a697635921e0eb4d7507ddaa	no  a radio telescope is A device for collecting the radio waves that are put out by objects in space (such as individual stars, whole galaxies, supernova remnants, etc).

aCx57XXzaa	How are Hurricanes Named?<br>  Since 1953, Atlantic tropical storms have been named from lists originated by the National Hurricane Center and now maintained and updated by an international committee of the World Meteorological Organization. The lists featured only women’s names until 1979. After that, men’s and women’s names were alternated. Six lists are used in rotation. Thus, the 2001 lists will be used again in 2007.<br>  The only time there is a change in the list is if a storm is so deadly or costly that the continued use of the name would be inappropriate for reasons of sensitivity.(Katrina) When this occurs, the name is stricken from the list and another name is selected to replace it.<br>  Sometimes names are changed. Lorenzo replaced Luis and Michelle replaced Marilyn.<br>  <br>  FOR MORE INFORMATION AND VIDEO GO TO:|`|Vf2lnEH7aa	Hurricanes are named by the World Meteorological Organization. This list consists of male and female names from A-Z, which is rotated around. Each list is used every six years. Whenever a name is retired, a new name is added to the list.

qeR967J7aa	Essentially, your pumping chamber has a leak, so it pumps less effectively.
kkJcYGVUaa	Blood is carried from the heart to all parts of your body in vessels called arteries. Blood pressure is the force of the blood pushing against the walls of the arteries. Each time the heart beats (about 60-70 times a minute at rest), it pumps out blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is at its highest when the heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When the heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is the diastolic pressure.  Blood pressure is always given as these two numbers, the systolic and diastolic pressures. Both are important. Usually they are written one above or before the other, such as 120/80 mmHg. The top number is the systolic and the bottom the diastolic. When the two measurements are written down, the systolic pressure is the first or top number, and the diastolic pressure is the second or bottom number (for example, 120/80). If your blood pressure is 120/80, you say that it is "120 over 80."|`|AA11185595	the first is pressure out the second back<br>  mine is 189/102 , im waiting for a bypass, when they come together ask for your priest , mine has been 179/159 , was in an ambulance at speed with light and siren im told :O),<br>   should be 120/80 in a real world

Mr4DFAVkaa	No, they are not alive... there are several reasons for this, here's just a couple:<br>  <br>  They do not metabolize (they go through no respiration, excretion, ingestion, etc. on their own). Viruses do not react to external stimuli. They also require a host cell in order to reproduce (they are unable to do so on their own). Living organisms need to be able to participate in all of these functions, so a virus could not be considered a living organism.|`|6e9ROc9waa	This is actually an open debate in the scientific community. Many do not consider viruses to be alive because they do not have any means of reproducing on their own. Rather, they must "hijack" the replication machinery of their host cells to reproduce. Since reproduction is often part of the definition of "life", this leads some to conclude that viruses are not alive.<br>  Recently, a team of researchers discovered what is now known as a "virophage", or a virus that infects other viruses. This has shaken up the question about viral life somewhat. <br>  Part of the problem with this question is that "life" has no clear definition itself. It's hard to classify viruses as "life" or "non-living" if we cannot decide what "life" means, exactly.|`|2I14qmzLaa	I agree with the answer by CWGK. It's a matter of reference.

Here goes:<br>  <br>  This question gets asked so often that some people in Religion & Spirituality have made a drinking game of it; every time someone asks, they take a drink. You may get some answers that say "Swig" or "Gulp" or "Thanks for the excuse to drink". That's what they mean. If you do a search on "still monkeys" and "still apes" you'll get roughly 2 - 3 per day since YA started. <br>  <br>  Here is a short answer:<br>  <br>  Because they evolved from our common ancestor too. We humans got smarter. The great apes, including chimpanzees, got bigger or stronger. A 180-pound chimp would wipe the floor with a 180-pound human, even a college wrestler. A 400-pound gorilla would wipe the floor with a 180-pound human too.<br>  <br>  If you were just curious, stop reading this and go look up "Evolution" on Wikipedia. <br>  <br>  If you wanted to argue against evolution, here is a little something extra for you, what the Cajuns call "lagniappe", like the free cookie the baker gives the kids when Mom buys a big birthday cake:<br>  <br>  Back in 1776, monarchists (Monarchists are people who want to be ruled by a king or queen, not butterfly fanciers.) argued against democracy as a form of government. They said it was absurd to believe that "All men are created equal" because anyone could see men came in different heights, weights and colors. Case closed.<br>  <br>  My point is not about democracy. It is about debate. Before you argue about something, you should understand it. If you don't understand it, you'll look foolish. One night on the "Saturday Night Live" TV show, Gilda Radner argued vehemently against the "Deaf Penalty", instead of the "Death Penalty". She looked absurd and we all laughed until the beer came out our noses, which was what she wanted. You don't want people to laugh at you.<br>  <br>  In a serious debate, you should understand the other side. Note that I didn't say "Believe". Understanding is not the same as believing. If you were to study 20th century European Political history, you would have to understand several forms of government: communism (the USSR), fascism (Germany, Italy), socialism (Lots of countries), socialist democracy, capitalistic democracy and constitutional monarchy. You would not believe in all of them; you COULD not believe in all of them at once. If you tried, your head would explode. You would, however, have to understand their basic concepts. <br>  <br>  If you were to study comparative religion, you would have to understand what Jews, Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Taoists and Confucians believe. You would not have to convert to a new religion every week, but you would have to understand the other ones. You would not get very far in your studies if you dismissed all the other ones as "wrong". They believe their path is the right one just as strongly as you believe your path is the right one.<br>  <br>  99% of the biologists alive today believe that species evolve, and that the theory of evolution is the best explanation we have for the diversity of life.  Christian biologists, Jewish biologists, Muslim biologists, Hindu biologists, Buddhist biologists; Australian, Bolivian and Chinese biologists; 99% of them believe it is the best explanation. Yes, it is only a theory. Planetary motion - the theory that the earth went around the sun, not vice versa - was only a theory for a long time. Some people still don't believe it.<br>  <br>  If you are truly curious, ask your minister to give you a short, reasoned explanation of evolution. Tell him you don't want to believe it, of course; you just want to understand it. If he says he can't because it is wrong, he is as ignorant as those monarchists I mentioned above.|`|WRyHOEjSaa	The common ancestor people share with monkeys was itself a monkey.

We did not evolve from monkeys, but rather, along side monkeys from some distant ancestor.

i0ypGmlQaa	You first want to take out the common factor -3 and rearrange:<br>  <br>  ? ? ? ? ? y - 8 = -3 ( x2 + 4x )<br>  <br>  Now you have to "complete the square" --<br>  <br>  If you had<br>  <br>  ? ? ? ? ? (x+h)2 = x2 + 4x + C<br>  <br>  what could C be? You simply expand:<br>  <br>  ? ? ? ? ? x2+2hx+h2 = x2 + 4x + C<br>  <br>  You can say then that 2h=4 and that h2 = 4 also. So you need to make your old equation look like that. In order to do so, you need to get:<br>  <br>  ? ? ? ? ? y - 8 = -3 ( x2 + 4x + 4 )<br>  <br>  Now, that is WRONG. Why? We changed one side and not the other. That's not legal. We've added 4 inside the parentheses, which means we've really added -3(4) = -12. So we need to subtract 12 from the other side too. That gives:<br>  <br>  ? ? ? ? ? y - 20 = -3 ( x2 + 4x + 4 )<br>  <br>  Now use what we did, the point is to make it a square:<br>  <br>  ? ? ? ? ? y - 20 = -3 ( x + 2 )2<br>  <br>  From there, you know the vertex is ( -2, 20 ). That's called "vertex" form because it is written in a nice easy way:<br>  <br>  ? ? ? ? ? y - k = a ( x - h )2<br>  <br>  where the vertex is (h,k). That's how we got the vertex. The y-intercept is where x=0, which is easy enough to find too:<br>  <br>  ? ? ? ? ? y - 20 = -3 ( 0 + 2 )2<br>  <br>  ? ? ? ? ? y - 20 = -3 ( 4 )<br>  <br>  ? ? ? ? ? y - 20 = -12<br>  <br>  ? ? ? ? ? y = 8<br>  <br>  The y-intercept is (0,8).

SWJWOxSWaa	If you drank enough sugar water at a high enough concentration you probably would have some sort of ill effects. For example, sea water is more or less 1 M NaCl. If you drank enough of a 1 M solution of sucrose (about 340 grams of sucrose per liter of water), you would almost certainly experience some sort of ill effects.|`|GsSRY7quaa	it's not that they can't drink salt water, it's how much salt is in the water that causes the problem, like ocean water.|`|PKvTHudFaa	Because of the difference between how the body uses salt and sugar.<br>  <br>  First, drinking one glass of salt water isn't going to hurt you. Drinking only salt water, however, will cause problems.<br>  <br>  One of table salt's elements is sodium, an electrolyte, used for nerve function and also to facilitate transfer from the blood stream into cells. But water and electrolytes need to be very specifically balanced in order to maintain the right mix...too much of either one means your body starts to lose its ability to function. The problem with salt water is that, if you can taste the salt, the concentration of sodium will be too high unless you drink more water. The body tells a person to correct the imbalance by making him or her thirsty...but if you just drink more salt water, the imbalance gets worse and worse as you drink more fresh water, eventually making it impossible for the body to function. But if you drink fresh water, you'll restore the balance, your body will eliminate the excess salt and you'll go on as if nothing had happened. The ironic part is that the higher the salt concentration gets, the harder it is for the body to get rid of extra salt.<br>  <br>  Sugar, by contrast, is one of the purest forms of fuel for the human body. Sugar is used completely differently than salt. Table sugar is called sucrose, which is broken down by the body into two glucose molecules. Glucose is the body's most common and most efficient energy source. Drinking sugar water just dumps easy-to-use energy into the body. Too much sugar is bad, but sugar doesn't have the drastic effects that salt does. Your body takes extra sugar and stores it in various ways to use when it doesn't have as much, eventually as long-term fuel in fatty tissue. Too much sugar in the short term has little effect (sugar doesn't make you hyper, contrary to most people's assumption), but the long-term effects of too much sugar is simply weight gain as the body stores the extra energy it doesn't need right away.<br>  <br>  Salt and sugar affect the body differently, which means that while a small amount of either more than you need isn't very bad, continued imbalance of high salt intake has a negative effect on your health faster than high sugar intake.|`|kDz9gcMuaa	Sugar gives you energy thats why its in water and food buts giving you glucose to give you energy.

Mr4DFAVkaa	I've used GFP in a chimera experiment... we made chimeric mouse models from nl B6 mice (recipients) and GFP B6 mice (donors). Our goal was to determine the infiltration of a certain cell population into the CNS of the recipient mice... because GFP is such a bright cell marker, we did not need to tag the cells with fluorescent antibody to determine which were of donor origin. It made the experiment run much quicker, and saved us money in not needing to purchase antibody markers for our target cells. Hope that helped - not sure if that's the sort of thing you were looking for.
4b9ac58e789dd7441f61926ee404111faa	Karyotypes are the chromosome combinations responsible for determining a species. Humans have 46 chromosomes, or 22 pairs of chromosomes plus two sex chromosomes (46-XX or 46-XY). <br>  Ploidy, is the term which refers to the number of homologus chromosome pairs.<br>  <br>  There is a type of aneuploidy (abnormal chromosome number) called tetrasomy-X syndrome. They would be labeled 48-XXXX. There have been about 100 cases worldwide with about 60 reported in the literature. No males would survive with a karyotype of YYYY as the X-chromosome is necessary for normal development of all other chromosomes. You could have an XYYY male, but I don't know of any in the medical literature.<br>  Color-blindness is a sex-chromosome linked defect (in some types) due to an X-chromosome linked mutation. Tuner syndrome girls are OX karyotype (they are missing an X-chromosome) 45-X, so if they only have one X chromosome, like a male, then it's possible that the only chromosome they have would have the mutation. They would have no other X-chromosome to compensate for the defective one.

CRDl9nffaa	People just use this as a phrase meaning 'very rarely' of course. <br>  <br>  But it's original meaning, largely forgotten now, is to do with the fact that the moon cycle is a regular length but calendar months aren't. . That means that every few years you get a calendar month that has two full moons in it (normally there's one full moon a month). The second is sometimes called the 'blue moon'.<br>  <br>  At least that's what it says in my book about the moon. I've never personally heard anyone talk of a particular full moon being a 'blue moon'.<br>  <br>  'Lunatic' refers to the old, unfounded belief that mental illness or its symptoms followed the cycle of the moon.

It means that the occurrence of the event is rare.<br>  <br>  A lunatic is a someone who is mentally insane/ill, or just foolish.<br>  <br>  The word lunatic is borrowed from Latin "lunaticus", which gains its stem from "luna" for moon, which denotes the traditional link made in folklore between madness and the phases of the moon. This probably refers to the symptoms of cyclic mood disorders such as bipolar disorder or cyclothymia, the symptoms of which may also go through phases. As yet there no evidence whatsoever for any causal link between phases of the moon and the progression of mood disorder symptoms. Correlation has been observed in distant parts.<br>  <br>  Mental institutions used to be called "lunatic asylums" or colloquially, "loony bins".|`|XifRiqDyaa	when there is a full moon 3 times in 1 month. the third time it comes around its usually blue. happens rarely so thats where it came from.|`|F2ZNKCfCaa	it means only in your dreams. its possible to see a "blue moon" in ones own dreams

AA10927246	You need to start with the smallest triangles.  In a small block of triangles, there are 4 of them.  And that repeats 3 times in one area.  That area then repeats 3 times.  That's again repeats another 3 times.<br>  <br>  So for the smallest triangles you have 4 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 108 triangles.<br>  <br>  The next size up appears 12 times in section and is repeated 3 times.  That's a total of 36 of the next size up.<br>  <br>  The next size up from that appears 4 times in each of the 3 areas.  That's a total of 12 triangles of the next size up.<br>  <br>  Then you have the next biggest size which appears 3 times, plus upside down in the middle.  That's 4 times.<br>  <br>  Finally you have the big triangle around everything.<br>  <br>  108 + 36 + 12 + 4 + 1<br>  = 161<br>  <br>  Answer:<br>  161 triangles<br>  <br>  Edit:  There's a "recursive" way to figure this out too.

BrarMA1Haa	The dodgy chemicals of concern are the phosphors and the trace mercury inside the glass tube.  If the glass is intact, then the smoke was from an electronic component gone bad, and exhausting the smoke is sufficient remedial action.  It is safe to remove the compact fluorescent light (CFL) as follows:<br>  1.  turn off power<br>  2.  grasp at base, not the glass, and unscrew, unless it is not a screw-in, in which case, grasp the base and pull straight out.<br>  <br>  If the glass tube shattered, then you have a cleanup problem on your hands.  I reccommend sweeping up the glass shards and phosphor that might have fallen and wipe down the area with a damp paper towel.  Do not allow yourself to be cut by the glass.  It is reported that the phospors cause wounds that take months to heal.  Also, don't inhale any dust.<br>  <br>  Around here, CFLs are considered to be hazardous waste due to the chemicals and also due to them have a circuit board inside.  We dispose of CFLs at a hazardous waste facility at no charge.  It is no longer acceptable to dispose of them in the trash.<br>  <br>  In your case, bag the remnants in a plastic bag and dispose of in accordance with local regulations.<br>  <br>  CFLs usually don't "blow up" so I would chalk your experience up to being a rare case, and if you want to make a change, select a different manufacturer next time.  CFLs use about a third of the energy that incandescent lamps use, and thus reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  CRLs are heavily promoted (and subsidized) by the local power utilities due to their energy savings and the resultant reduction of need to build more power plants.  A package of 4 CFLs typically runs US$2.00 to US$1.00.<br>  <br>  Most CFLs will state that they are not for use in an enclosed luminaire.  That would suggest that heat build-up could shorten their lifetime.  I'm averaging 3-4 year lifetime for CFLs that I use in my ceiling fixtures that (ahem) are enclosed.<br>  <br>  Anyway, don't give up on CFLs.  They save money and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  The mercury at room temperature is in a liquid state.  There can be trace amounts left.

YRJFo6K0aa	You are absolutely correct in saying that the same number of moles of H are produced as there were moles of Mg. This gives the the general ratio you need to find out how much H2 is produced from the starting material. However you did not say much starting material you had... you need that information to solve this problem, unless you just want that general ratio.<br>  <br>  Should you have the grams of Mg, you would go about the problem by first converting this value to moles using the atomic weight of Mg:   grams Mg x (1 mole Mg/24.3 g Mg). Then, since the ratio of Mg to H2 is 1:1, you would simply convert this value to moles again by multiplying by the molecular weight of H2 (which is 2x the atomic weight of H).<br>  <br>  The one thing that might get confusing is the difference between the mole:mole ratio and the actual number of moles. Just remember that you get the ratio from the balanced equation (as you did) and you find the actual number of moles by converting grams of starting material into moles using the molecular (or atomic) weight of the substance.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps :-)|`|tc5BXAdKaa	Yes.

X4O7W1Vvaa	It might move a miniscule amount due to the Earth's magnetic field but it would be difficult to measure. That would depend on the wire gauge which isn't given so D.|`|PNPqujCTaa	Hi bcb,<br>  <br>  Neat question.<br>  <br>  First of all, without saying in so many words, the question tells you that the current that's going to flow through the conductor (wire, as it were) is DC, not AC.  How do you know that?<br>  <br>  It's DC because they tell you the current will flow "counterclockwise'...Only.  If it were AC current, it would flow one direction for half a cycle, then the oppisite direction for the second half of a cycle.  Don't you just love hidden clues?<br>  <br>  Anyway, when current flows through a conductor, any conductor, there is always an associated Magnetic Field that radiates from, and around, the conductor.  And, as with any magnetic field, it is polorized, North and South.  And, with DC the polarity is constant.  Conversely, the magnetic field associated with an AC current will  reverse polarity every time the AC current changes direction (or polarity).<br>  <br>  I might add at this point that that's how electric generators work, because the reverse is true.  If you pass a conductor through a magnetic field, the magnetic field will induce a current in the conductor.  Cool, hugh?<br>  <br>  Well, in this example, here's what will happen.  Since this is DC current, the associated magnetic field around the wire will have a constant polarity.  And since this a loop (vision a circle) at any two points which are 180 degrees from each other(oppisite from each other) the magnetic field will be opposing its self, and therefore "repell" from one another.  Do that at every point of the "loop" and it has now choice but to form a circle.  Piece-O-Cake!<br>  <br>  Try this, just for visualization.  Pick a starting point for walking.  Hold your arms out to the sides and turn one palm Up and the other Down (makes no dif which).  Now, your upright body represents the wire, your outstreached arms represent he radiating magnetic field, and the palms (one up, one down) represent the two magnetic polls (N & S), doesn't matter which is which.<br>  <br>  Now, (this is going to look a bit funny) start walking in a circle.  Notice which palm (polarity) is toward the center of the circle.  Walk half way round.  Same palm (polarity) is still pointing to the inside of the circle, right?  Now, look at where you just came from.  You can see that, magneticly speaking, the same polls are facing each other.  N to N, or S to S (which ever you named the "inside palm").<br>  <br>  So what are the magnetic polls going to do?  Repel! Right.<br>  <br>  So the loop has no choice but to form a circle cause at any point in the loop, across it's diameter, there exists a repelling magnetic poll.<br>  <br>  Got any more?  That was FUN !!<br>  db

Global surface temperature increased 0.74 ± 0.18 °C (1.33 ± 0.32 °F) during the 100 years ending in 2005.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are responsible for most of the observed temperature increase since the middle of the twentieth century, and natural phenomena such as solar variation and volcanoes probably had a small warming effect from pre-industrial times to 1950 and a small cooling effect from 1950 onward.  These basic conclusions have been endorsed by 30 scientific societies and academies of science, including all of the national academies of science of the major industrialized countries.<br>  <br>  Increasing global temperature will cause sea levels to rise and will change the amount and pattern of precipitation, likely including an expanse of the subtropical desert regions.  Other likely effects include Arctic shrinkage and resulting Arctic methane release, shrinkage of the Amazon rainforest, increases in the intensity of extreme weather events, changes in agricultural yields, modifications of trade routes, glacier retreat, species extinctions and changes in the ranges of disease vectors.<br>  <br>  Political and public debate continues regarding the appropriate response to global warming. The available options are mitigation to reduce further emissions; adaptation to reduce the damage caused by warming; and, more speculatively, geoengineering to reverse global warming. Most national governments have signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.|`|stAeoUeSaa	Myth that will try to be used to explain the very strange weather of the Tribulation (summer 2009 - summer 2016)<br>  <br>  It will fool many at first but soon the targetedness, strangeness, and strength will become apparent|`|9ae55890a5fcfea5236690724138dc1faa	I'm not even sure it exists, if you look at the figures you would know that the worlds temperature actually decreased over the past decade. It's not really that convincing when I look out my window either as in Britain we are in the middle of our coldest winter for years.<br>  <br>  The idea is that Carbon Dioxide from our cars and our industries goes into the atmosphere and traps infra red (heat radiation) within the atmosphere allowing more in than it lets out. This is called the greenhouse effect as it works the same way as a big greenhouse. That should be enough to get by in science class. If you need more then I'd recommend wikipedia.<br>  <br>  There are 4 reasons I dont believe in Global Warming<br>  1) There was a similar end of the world idea going round amongst eco nuts in the 70's except back then they thought the next ice age was coming. They also had the backing of many major scientists who said that another Ice Age was long overdue but they were still proved wrong.<br>  2) As those foretelling a new Ice Age found out the world's climate isn't really that predictable.<br>  If you look upon earth with the naked eye from space it looks as if humanity had never existed. When you consider the size of the planet, humanity and our creations really aren't that significant. I imagine that our contribution to climate change might be similar to our contribution to the view on Earth from space.<br>  3)I honestly dont think the worlds governments believe in global warming sure they've seized on it as a chance to lecture us and tax us a bit more as well as to get the eco vote but beyond that they haven't really done anything. If the offices of power aren't willing to take radical action they obviously dont view it as a major problem.<br>  4) My alternative explanation- Any scientist will tell you that the earth naturally goes through climate cycles anyways, the Ice Age and the hot tropical the dinosaurs flourished in both came about before pollution existed because of this. More recently it caused the Little Ice Age, a cold period from about 1500-1850. It is actually due to fluctuations in the sun which gives out the infra red in the first place and is also affected by volcano activity and the amount of forestation and algae in the sea. If Global Warming does exist which as I say I'm not sure about then how do we know it is man made.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	It's the systematic rise in the average temperature of the earth.

GYTjkZItaa	The domain of a function is any value of x for which the function f(x) works.  A function that works on all values of x is said to have a domain of all real numbers.  So to find the domain, we want to find places where the function will NOT work first.<br>  <br>  If a function has a denominator, the denominator must never equal zero, because you cannot divide by zero.  Since we have a denominator here, we want to see where it will equal zero, i.e. where the function f(x) will not work.  So let's set the denominator equal to zero.<br>  <br>  9 - x  = 0<br>  x = 9<br>  <br>  So now we see that the function will not work when x equals 9.  So our domain so far is all real numbers, except where x = 9.<br>  <br>  Now another thing we want to keep an eye out for is square roots.  You cannot take the square root of a negative number, therefore the function will not work if we have to take a square root of a negative number.  So let's set our square root up as an inequality so we know what numbers it has to be in order to work.<br>  <br>  6 + x >= 0  ( >= means greater than or equal to)<br>  x >= -6<br>  <br>  So now we know that in order for the function to work, x must be greater than or equal to -6.<br>  <br>  So our final domain now, is any real number greater than or equal to -6 except when x = 9.<br>  <br>  Or in other words:<br>  <br>  D: R (R = all real numbers) x >=6, except for x = 9

AA10927246	You'll need to be more specific about the problems.  Square feet are a measure of area.  Feet are a linear measurement of distance.  You can't convert from one to the other without knowing the shape in question.<br>  <br>  For example an acre is 43,560 sq. ft.  But you could have a square (approx. 208 ft. x 208 ft.) or any of a number of rectangles (e.g. 220 ft. x 198 ft., or 110 ft. x 396 ft.) or it could be a circle, or a triangle, etc.<br>  <br>  So in the general case you can't turn sq. ft. into ft.  But if you have more details you can divide by a dimension, or use the area formula to get the other dimension.

I'd be intrigued to see why the student got that marked wrong.<br>  <br>  Average speed over the 16m would be the total distance travelled divided by the total length of time taken.

LoFeJztxaa	Area of trapezoid is height times average of bases (10)(20+15)/2 = 175 square meters.  Volume is (area of trapezoid) times (depth of pool).  Hence:<br>  <br>  volume = (175)(3) = 525 cubic meters. <br>  <br>  Each meter is 100 centimeters, so each cubic meter is 100^3 cubic centimeters.  So,<br>  <br>  volume = (525)(100^3) = 525000000 cubic centimeters.|`|RShYFxA9aa	First find the area of the trapezoid in meters and then multiply that by 3 (how deep the pool is).

2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	Moon phase refers to the appearance of the illuminated portion of the moon as seen by an observer.<br>  The moon orbits the Earth in 29.3 days so the amount of sunlight reflected to us changes during that time.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	The Moon is a sphere which travels once around the Earth every 29 days. As it does so, it is illuminated from varying angles by the Sun. At New Moon, the Moon is between the Earth and Sun, so that the side of the Moon facing towards us receives no direct sunlight, and is only lit by dim sunlight reflected from the Earth. As it moves around the Earth, the side we can see gradually becomes more illuminated by direct sunlight.<br>  <br>  After a week, the Moon is 90° away from the Sun in the sky and is half illuminated, what we call First Quarter because it is about a quarter of the way around the Earth. <br>  <br>  A week after this, the Moon is 180° away from the Sun, so that Sun, Earth and Moon form a line. The Moon is fully illuminated by the Sun, so this is called Full Moon. The Earth's shadow points towards the Moon at this time, but usually the Moon passes above or below the shadow and no eclipse occurs.<br>  <br>  A week later the Moon has moved another quarter of the way around the Earth, to the Third Quarter position. The Sun's light is now shining on the other half of the visible face of the Moon.<br>  <br>  Finally, a week later, the Moon is back to its New Moon starting position. Usually it passes above or below the Sun, but occasionally it passes right in front of the Sun, and we get an eclipse of the Sun.<br>  <br>  The Moon's phases are NOT caused by the shadow of the Earth falling on the Moon. In fact the shadow of the Earth only falls on the Moon twice a year when there is a lunar eclipse.

Q6uWCUqsaa	This is the equation of a line. Assuming this is is a 2-dimensional graph, probably the simplest way to graph it is to find two different ordered pairs (x, y) that satisfy the equation. Both such points lie on the line, and the line through these two points is the line represented by the equation. For example, (6,0) and (0,2) both lie on the line.
