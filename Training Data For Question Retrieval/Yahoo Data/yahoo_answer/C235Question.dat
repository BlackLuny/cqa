20070318214712AAZowO9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	36 weeks miserable?	I am 36 wks. preggo with gestational diabetes. (which means early labor for me.. baby is almost 7 lbs and placenta will stop functioning)  Last week at my appointment the doctor told me I was 2 cm dialated and 50% effaced. He also said that if I don't go into labor on my own before the 23rd I will be induced!  I have a fever, I have what I think is mild and irregular contractions, I can't sleep, my back is killing me and on top of that, my boss won't let me miss work Monday and I am sooo miserable. What do I do to feel better in the mean time and why is my boss such an ***??

20090131100744AAoVvnX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	FAS, adoption, radical therapy, respite care.?	The more I research about raising and a child who is adopted and with FAS the more horrified I become.      The worse my son behavior becomes, the less I trust people alone with him out of fear HE will be hurt, yet I read about people who leave their kids regularly in respite care.      Then I read about people swapping adopted kids and APs who leave their kids with people who run "home" without notifying children's services, out of fear of having to pay child support if the child enters the "system".      I read of radical therapy the "brake" the child of their behavior. Therapy include all kinds of cruel actions.      I knew this crap existed, but as a parent of a child with FAS I can't even imagine thinking any of this is okay.      Does anyone know of therapies that are based on LOVE and affection?

A guy hitting a girl is looked down upon but hitting, sorry "spanking", a kid is "parenting"??      your opinions please.....

20090131102827AAAe7IE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Am I 'frigid' ? What should I do about it? Help!?	So, I'm in 9th grade and I've never had a bf, or gone out with a boy or been kissed, or even hugged by a boy- basically nothing. I've liked boys,sure, but I've never wanted them to kiss me or anything.       Once, at a school dance, this guy (who my friends considered pretty hot) asked me to dance, and I kinda said no. I just didn't really want to dance with him 'coz I knew that it'd feel uncomfortable and many other couples were 'hug' dancing/ grinding and I didn't want to do that. To add to the whole 'frigid' thing, I'm also considered, ahem, pretty smart and sometimes I wonder if I'm going towards the whole nerdy thing because I can become slightly obsessed when it becomes to school work and everything.      To add to everything I play the violin and the piano, but I'm not bad at sports either, if I do say so myself.    So, going back to the original question, am i frigid?

I am noticing now that she is beginning to advoid me and is getting a little sneaky.

20090131085635AAHTvG1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How do military moms do it?	I am currently a mom of 2 boys both under the age of two. My husband recently deployed, I have no family in the area, and I feel constantly overwhelmed. For example, this was my morning:      I am breastfeeding my 8 month old son, Connor, and he usually wakes up twice a night for a feeding. However, he woke up 5 times last night. Jimmy, my other son of 20 months, kept waking up as well. I finally got a little bit of sleep in before we were up for the day. When we were up for the day, I picked up Connor from his crib only to discover that he had a fever. I took him downstairs and let the dog out, and around that time I heard Jimmy was awake. I go into his room only to find him, the bed, and the floor covered with milk puke....fun. So I took him into the bathroom to clean him off. I started the water running in the tub, and while the maintenance guy changed out the drain fixture a few days ago, the drain itself still wouldn't drain. I didn't even put the plug in the tub and by the time I had Jimmy rinsed off, the tub was 3/4 full. I had to keep the water running because as I was getting the temperature just right, Jimmy puked in the tub, so the water was full of puke. I can't clean out the tub because it is draining so slowly....      As I was on the phone with the maintenance department to get the stuff fixed that was supposed to be fixed, I had to move the bread machine to get to the note tablet underneath it to write down the work order numbers. In doing so, the bread machine fell over and shattered the salt grinder. So now, I have to take the vacuum to the stove to get all the salt and glass out of the stove. Then, the washer went on the fritz (I think it was off balance, but I can't be sure). This is not good because I use cloth diapers and have to do laundry every other day.      I just want to know, how do you military moms do it?

Most people's luteal (post ovulation) phase is two weeks, so this would have me having like a 4 or 5 week luteal phase, is that even possible?  Is there something wrong with me?

20090131095225AAmgRM2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Daughter trying to steal.. Is this a fair punishment?	My husband and I were with my daughter (7) in the store this past week. She was being a brat, I told her we were not going to buy anything except what we needed. She wanted some toy, and I told her no. Well, I caught her trying to put it in her coat pocket. I walked her to the corner of the store and lectured her big time about stealing and how it was wrong. I was really firm and told her it had better not happen again.   Well, ten minutes later she did it again and an associate caught her.    The associate went to my husband and told him. The associate told her that grown ups go to jail for that. My husband told the associate she knows better than that. We told the associate that it would be dealt with. My daughter said "I am going to get a spanking", trying to get the associate to feel sorry for her. The associate made me smile when she told my daughter she should not of stole and it would not happen.    We took her straight home, and had another talk. We did not have to explain much, she knew it was wrong. Now getting a spanking from daddy is the worst punishment in the world for her. I'm sure he spanks harder, but the worst part for her is she is daddies girl. It breaks her heart and hurts her pride more than her hiney.    My husband spanked her and once the crying was over, we had a talk. She is going to have to do a lot of chores around the house, I took her Nintendo DS away and out a $10 dollar price on it. Each chore is 25 cents off the $10, and she will get it back once she earns it.    Does this sound like a fair punishment? I want her to remember it is wrong and hopefully she will think about the spanking from daddy when she ponders doing it again. I also want her to learn about earning money and the value of it
20090131083715AASCoF0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is this fair to tell a woman?	Is the following fair for a man to tell his girl friend?        A man tells his girlfriend I don’t want children, and I don't want to get maried.  If you want to marry and have kids, you will have to find somebody ells.  If you want to stay with me and have a child you must use a sperm donor so I am not the legal father.  If you want to stay with me and have a child, I recommend that you go to California on vacation, and try to get pregnant with a man and come back to Michigan.  You should try and fine a man who has lot more money than me.  Try to fine a millionaire if you can.  You could get more than $250,000 in child support a year.  Once the baby is born in Michigan, ask for child support, and you can use him as a sperm donor and ATM machine for the next 18 years.  The person will probably stay in California, and never visit Michigan and may choice to never see his child (but I could be wrong).

A: She was abandoned by her mother and he is a single father.        B: Her mother was a surrogate mother.  Since the day she is born, she had a legal father, but does not have a legal mother.  He only wanted children that have no legal mother, because he does not want to pay court order child support and presumes that every woman would do that jus to get his money.           He does not want anymore children.

If you are happy to smack your own children (not BEAT or ABUSE them), would you do it to someone elses? either if they were left in your care or not? would you need their parents permission or not?

If you are against smacking children then I respect your views but ask (respectfully) that you voice them in another question. Thank you for your understanding and co-operation.

20090131130232AAjfc3F	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I am so hurt by my actions.....?	Me and my 17 year old got into a heated argument today.  He said something very disrespectful which caused me to lose control.   He missed worked today because our car was stuck in our driveway. He refused to help push or what not. I shoveled as much as I could without his help. I asked for help yet he still refused. I refused to call triple AAA because I only call it for severe cases which in the past there have been. That is what triggered this argument.    I have been unemployed for over 6 months. I cannot find a job anywhere. This is what he used against me.   The argument got heated and he ended up telling me "Well mom, at least I HAVE a job."   I slapped him.   I feel so horrible that I allowed myself to lose control like this. I never view violence as an answer to ANYTHING. Yet it happened. I am hurt and sad.    Word of encouragement are desperately needed. What would you have done in my situation so next time I will know not to react like this.

20090131124335AAEg8Y0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Moms, I need some reassurance. I feel very guilty for losing my patience with my son.?	My son is almost five months old, and he is usually a very happy, content baby, but today has been a nightmare. He is teething, so I'm sure that is the main source of his irritability. He woke up at around seven and cried for almost three hours straight before going down for a nap that he fought so bad I nearly went insane. I am always very patient with him, but today I got so frustrated that in the middle of his crying, I started crying too. I tried everything to calm my little guy down. I checked his temp ( it was normal), let him have his bottle sooner than usual, took him outside for air (had to come back in pretty quickly, didn't want the neighbors to get mad), he had a clean diaper, I seriously tried all that I could think of. I am not trying to complain, I just want to feel like someone understands. I felt so horrible not being able to relieve his discomfort, and he kept looking at me with tear filled eyes like he was wondering my I wasn't helping him. I absolutely broke my heart to pieces. It got so bad at one point that I had to set him in his crib and close the door for a couple of minutes to maintain my composure, and that made me feel even worse. If any of you have gone through a similar situation, please give me some advice. As much as I hope that this never happens again, I want to be able to handle it better if it does.

20090131132329AAic4XC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Am I being fair in this?	My husband comes from a family where both parents work full time and that's just the way it is. My family is easy going. Since August I have been running an official daycare out of our home but we live in such a small town that it's hard to get kids, I haven't had any since the week of Christmas. We have been wanting to move anyway because our landlord is horrible. We found a place in the next town that is cheaper than this place and there are more daycare opporotunities. The next town is only 7 miles from where he works. He gets stressed b/c he doesn't consider this a "real job" and b/c I haven't had income for a little while now, which is perfectly understandable (the income part). I am now pregnant so no one would want to hire me anyway but I can't afford daycare for 2 kids I'd be working for nothing b/c I'd have to start at min wage. His income more than supports us alone so it's not like we're struggling. He makes me feel really guilty about this and it's just getting aggrivating for both of us. I really want to be able to raise my own kids but b/c of how he was raised it's just causing problems for us (his work mentality). Am I being fair in wanting this? I really want to be a stay at home mom b/c my previous sitter wouldn't ever listen to me when it came to taking care of my daughter and she was even late in walking/crawling etc b/c the sitter wouldn't ever let her on the floor and she had her a majority of the day. Since I've been having her full time she's rocketed into developtment and even learning. She could get into kindergarten right now if they accepted 2.5 yr olds.  Opinions??????????????

I have a 7 month old baby girl and she is the best thing to ever happen to me.  Her father and I have been together for 5 years, but sometimes it feels like he is just another child to take care of.  He is 35 and I am 22.  I am mostly a stay at home mom, I only work 20 hours a week and my boyfriend works 50 and is the main money maker, but when he is home and I ask him to help with the baby he just doesn't know what to do.  I always end up doing it myself.  He is great when it come to playing with her and loving her but all the hard stuff is all left up to me.  Sometime I feel like I have to take care of her and him like they are both children.  I don't mean to vent, I am just wondering if any other women feel this way.  I love him and the life that he provides for me and our daughter, but I wound just like a little help now and then.

My inlaws dont care for me nor do i them.       On Feb 20 my mother and father in law are having a party at their house starting around 6:00 pm because theyre friends are getting married at the justice of peace office around 5:30. This party is going to pretty much be drinking, smoking, and cursing. A couple of weeks ago my MIL told my husband about this party and said she wanted me my husband and our 9 month old daughter to come to the party. I told him right off i wasnt taking her to a party like that. Last night the subject came up again and he said that shes too young to know whats going and that i was being a little rediculous by not wanting to take her. I understaand shes still too young to know whats going on around her when it comes to tstuff like that but i just dont think this is a place where children belong no matter if theyre 9months or 9years old.       Am i wrong to feel this way?

My son's birthday is tomorrow. He is turning 6. His birthday party is going to be on February 21st. He is sending out invitations to his friends next week, and wants to go somewhere fun. Or do something fun at home.    We live in California near the beach. And, there is going to be 15 kids there (including my kids). What can be fun for a bunch of 5-6 year olds? Best answer has most options. My son will pick off of here, so no swearing or being rude please. He will pick the best answer.
20090131121109AAlwNpl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	What are your opinions?	Well the other day, my daughter came home talking about how new girls were at her school...twins, and she said they were very nice and wanted to know if they could come over the next day. I heard their names and I thought "WOAH."  They are practically the same name!    Analeigh  (Anna-Lee)  Annleigh  (Anne-Lee)    Aren't they ridiculously similar?!?!
20090131123148AAKWQQk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Random question for step-parents...or parents, either I suppose!?	For step-parents: Are your step-children close to you? Do you think of them as "yours"? Do you really love them like you love your own?      For parents: Are you comfortable with having another person act as your child's parent? Would you be rude to your ex's new spouse because they were your child's step-parent?      Just asking...   I adopted my step-daughter not too long ago...and people tend to think it's odd that I just treat her as my daughter, because she is to me. I've known her her whole life; her dad and I have been friends since high school. Her mother is completely witchy to me, and used to actually tell Ada that I didn't love her and that I wanted her gone.      Is that a "Normal" parent reaction? Seriously?      honestly, I don't see why "biological parents" are better seen then "step-parents".       Ada's mom told Ada frequently that I didn't love her. That I wanted to get rid of her. She'd tell her rotton things that I "said" to her about ada...even though I never said more than a few sentences to Lindsay.    Worst of all, she left now...gave up all custody of Ada. So she feels abandoned on top of everything. Why shouldn't I be seen as a mother? Ada is my baby. I AM here for her. I will NOT leave her. EVER.

I am 16 now, and by the time i finish school i will be 17. (i go to a steiner school so i finish a year later)  i finish school in about a year and a half, and plan to work and save up money for traveling.       This is so important to me, as i have no idea what id like to do in life, and i think that going out and seeing the world would be great for me as it could give me a different perspective on things, aswell as some wonderful experiences.       I have no idea about the laws though, and was wondering what someone under eighteens's options are? About working and traveling? Has anybody else traveled this young? Does anyone know of any organisations that i could travel and work with or something?       Im not sure as to how long i would go, that is flexible.

Also, she has said "we are not in a thrid world country where woman just let their boobs hang out" I realize my mother does not know the benefits of breastfeeding, but it seems like her comments mainly come from her being a little hurt that I am not doing things the ways she did.   She has also said that boobs are for our husbands! Ha!      Does anyone have anything to share reguarding doing things differently from their own mother? And their mother's reaction?

20090131133539AAWVR6I	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Do you think my parents will be okay with this?	There's this guy I've known for a couple of years,we met through a mutual friend.I usually see this guy only about 3 times a year,since he lives in a town about 45 minutes away.Recently I found his Myspace,through our friend's page.I sent this guy a friend request,and he accepted it.That was about a week ago.Now we've been talking a lot on myspace.We haven't actually talked at the same time,since we're never on at the same time.But we send messages to each other and then the other one of us will reply.We've been talking about meeting up and doing something,including our friend and probably my brother,too.So it wouldn't actually be just us.And the first message he sent me,he asked if I had a cell phone number so he could put me in his contacts when he got one.I don't have a cell phone yet,so I didn't have a cell number to give him.But I did give him my home phone number,and he gave me his.And we've got each other on our top friends,too.      I don't think anything of this,since I know we're just friends.But my parents don't want me dating for a long time,since I'm only about to be 15.And this guy is 18.And when I mentioned to my mom that if I ever got a cell phone(since my parents say the reason I can't get a phone yet is 'cause I don't have anyone to call)that I could call this guy,hoping she would say yes.Then she told me she didn't want me calling any guys on it.So I'm afraid they would be suspicious if they knew I was talking to this guy on myspace and that we had exchanged phone numbers,even though nothing is going on.      Sorry this is so long,I just don't want my parents getting mad just because I'm e-mailing a guy,especially one I don't see face-to-face very often.If you were a parent,would you be okay about this?Mine are pretty strict.   31 minutes ago - 3 days left to answer.    Additional Details   1 minute ago      We don't talk about anything bad,at all.i've met him several times face-to-face,and my parents have met him,too.I think they like him.I jusr don't know how they'll like me talking to him one-on-one.   1 second ago      We both come from very religious families,so I doubt he'll try anything.And if we ever do hang out,it'll be with lots of other people around.

I am wondering what works for others as far as behavior strategies, systems, plans etc.  My son is six years old with several diagnoses including adhd, bipolar, and high functioning autism.  His behavior is a major issue.  We have tried time outs, reward systems where he got stickers and then a reward at the end of the week or day, 123 magic, and more with no success.  Any ideas?
20090131142336AAkuaJl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Amount of time segments to use for reward system for six year old with special needs?	I have tried reward systems in the past but they did not work for my son.  I used to keep a chart and reward him at the end of the week.  I have been told that is too long for his age.  We tried daily, but that did not work either.  I am wondering what are good time segments for a child with ADHD and other diagnoses that has alot of trouble?

I havent had one since. I have never been more than 6 days late on a period, and i have NEVER missed one. I was due on for another one on wednesday. So ive missed 2 periods. I have had urine tests done at the hospital and a blood test came back negative last week. I havent been under stress, and even wen i have been in the past my period has been like clockwork. They did a blood test and nothing came back. So i am confused. I am not pregnant because of the test, and i have certainly not got any symptoms. Has anyone else been like this before? I am ttc so i just want to get this period out of the was so i can try again

20090131141614AAVfMIx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	When should I take a pregnancy test .. what do I do if I am pregnant?	I had a brief unprotected sex with my boyfriend but he had pre-*** that leaked out a little, he went in deep too and thrusted hard for a minute. Pre-*** can contain sperm so I've been trying to talk myself into not freaking out if I do become pregnant and that's it's not the (possible) baby's fault it's ours. I didn't take the morning after pill. I don't believe in abortions. But I hope I am not. This happened yesterday so when will I know if I am pregnant or not if I am? What is the first thing I should do if I am? My boyfriend is 21 and I am 20 years old. We have been together a year, living together. I can't take birth control it harms my health.

20090131135848AAGe9yz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Weird question but i need answers please ?	is there any way i could shorten this down for my counselor? I feel there's too much to read.    as far back as i can remember my parents have always being arguing about things until my mum got pregnant with my younger sister, when my sister was about 6 months old i got sexually abused by my best friends older brother, i was around 7-8yrs old. my mum knows and so does my dad, me getting sexually abused caused a lot of arguments which i blame myself for, if i didn't get sexually abused they wouldn't be arguing over it. we moved because the house next door to where i used to live got set on fire and our house stunk of smoke. when i moved they wasnt arguing too much for about 6 months then they started again, my mum accused my dad of having an affair, at this point they were going to get a divorce but they didn't. my mum kicked my dad out of the house, he was living in a caravan for about 3 weeks in the garden. fast forward a few years, they started arguing again and started getting violent. my dad had my mum in the corner of the kitchen and he wouldn't let her go. later that night they'd been arguing and my dad had been drinking. about 1am my mum woke me and my younger sister up to go else where because my dad had being threatening her. we got out of the house and he pinned us up against a lamp post. i tried over dosing after this happened. i'd been cutting for a couple of months before too, after this i was cutting about 2-3 times a day. fast forward a couple more years, i'm still cutting, its over 2 years since i tried overdosing and my sexual abuse is starting to get to me.

Anyway I have read many responses from people who say she should not be allowed to have 14 kids. Now this isn't about IVF and implanting embryos-that is a completely separate issue than my question. So I have seen some comments stating that this world is already over populated and x amount of babies is plenty or she couldn't properly raise this many children. I want to know   1. Do you believe the government should dictate how many children an individual is allowed to have      2.If so how do you determine the number of children allowed-or is it a flat number (like 1 for every $20000 in gross income or just 2 per family)      3.How do you enforce something like this?

I asked the tech if she should give me any feed back. Which as I already knew they can't diagnose patients. But I tried...      What I was wondering was.. since ovulation comes before a menstrual period, it is in fact possible for me to get pregnant and think it was still part of my abnormal missed period.      They didn't let me see the ultrasound but what I was wondering was would they tell me if I was pregnant? or would I have to wait till I see my doctor?

20090225091510AAZXS7o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Positive pregnancy test strip?	I've been quite late for my period & experiencing symptoms of pregnancy.  However, I do have irregular periods so I chalked it up to my mind playing with me.  So, I bought some pregnancy test strips online.        I took one as soon as they arrived & seemed like it only faintly displayed the control line (I know, use morning urine.  This was not done w/such due to the urge to poas.)  Next test was taken w/in 24 hours with morning urine & displayed the control line deeper & also had another dark line (deep purple).        However this line didn't seem like it was where it should be.  It was located beneath the sticker like material holding the stuff for the test strip.  I didn't know what to make of the test.  The second line wasn't there with the first one.  I thought, "hey, a second line...  that should be positive, but it doesn't look like it's in the location specified in the packaging.  I'll do it again."      So, I waited 48 hours.  Took another test with morning urine.  Same thing as the last time, but darker.  I searched yahoo answers & found someone who had a similar experience.  (Link:   http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...  )      Here are some photos.    http://i627.photobucket.com/albums/tt355...   (All three tests.  First on bottom, 3rd on top.  You can see the purple through the lil sticker.)     http://i627.photobucket.com/albums/tt355...   (Side view showing the second purple line clearly & how it's beneath the sticker.)      Is that actually a positive?  I mean why else would it have another line on a test?  But it's location is so funny.

20090225092605AATeLG1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Exposing sick children to other healthy children?	I live in a small neighborhood where a lot of families use me as a back-up or fill-in babysitter as I am a SAHM. I have my neighbors two children for a couple days this week as her babysitter is on vacation. Yesterday she brought them and never said one word about the 2 year old being sick. Just dropped them off and flew out the door. All day yesterday the poor girl is coughing constantly and sounds horrible when she takes a deep beathe. She kept telling me she was tired so she layed on the couch most of the day and just slept. When the father came to pick them up last evening I told him about this and he said they would have to take her to a doctor as she had this all weekend and it wasn't getting better. I expected a phone call this AM saying they weren't coming. Instead the father dropped them off on the front walk and just waved to me. I tried to put my shoes on and catch him to talk to him about the child and her illness but he was gone in a flash. Now today the 4 year old is hacking up a storm! The 2 year old hasn't gotten any better either. I don't want to be rude but they cannot bring their children here when they are sick, it's just going to make my children sick! I would never do this! I am doing them a favor and this is how they repay me! I called the mother at her work and she said that she has Friday off and they are going to take the 2 year old to the walk-in clinic that day. She was going to see if her MIL could get off work to come pick the kids up but that was 2 hours ago and I have not heard anything.I find this very rude and irresponsible. I feel sorry for these kids who need to go to the doctor. I also feel sorry for my kids as they are likely to pick this respiratory illness up, I try to disinfect and constant hand washing but that only does so much, most of these respiratory illnesses are airborne. Has anyone experienced such rude behavior like this? Don't you hate it when your perfectly healthy children get exposed to illnesses due to someone else's irresponsibility?!?

I get so frustrated when I can't comfort my daughter.  Sometimes I think it would be better if I wasn't with them during the day that way I would appreciate them so much more and be more attentive/patient with them. Am I horrible for feeling this way?  I never had any respect for my mom growing up, but boy do I now!  How do other moms do it?  I feel like I'm just getting by!  I don't even put on makeup anymore!

Should I tell my dad that I am to old to be spanked I mean I am a girl. Should he be spanking me in middle school? He spanked me bare with nothing but my underwear's on!! I think I am way to old for him to hit me! The thing is I was already punished at school suspend for 1 week half at home and the other is ISS (in school suspension)! A little harsh!! Plus I get a 0 on the TEST!! I tried to tell him how I feel and all he says is oh I raised you and if you are bad I can put you over my knee and said a girl is not to old to be spanked until their period starts then your mother will spank you!! I just don't see how this is right!! I posted this before but everyone was mean to me
20090225093606AABjMpT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Advice for a 23 year old?	so my mom is setting me up with a one bedroom apartment, shes gonna pay the first few months, and then pretty much leave me to fend for myself, I live in a small county, and cops bag people for jaywalking, I'm afraid of legal issues when my friends come over to hang out, I also go to school, so it makes it hard for me to work, fulltime, the place is $689 a month NOT including electricity, how am I going to pay that, it sounds sweet and all but I still feel kinda pressured and scared
