I bought a new hard drive for a machine I had already built (I removed the previous ones). After I installed windows XP I realized I didn't have the motherboard's CD that it came with. How do I get another copy of this cd or make due? I tried going to the motherboard's website and getting the drivers that way. I copied the archived drivers to a flash drive and then transfered them to the new computer. When I unzip them I don't know which file to click on. None of the obvious "Setup" icons work for any of the drivers. An error message comes up when I click on them. I think it would be much easier and preferable to just get a copy of the cd that came with it.      The motherboard is, MSI 975X Platinum V.2

I am switching from using laptops to PCs, I have ordered the parts to put my own PC together since its easy and I have saved a bit of money!      I already own all the peripherals I need, except a keyboard! I am looking for a keyboard which has a short button press, like a laptop keyboard, as in, the keys don't go in really far when you press them. I love this feature on laptop keyboards and for gaming, I find they run a lot smoother when you're hitting buttons waiting for cooldowns to come up (World of Warcraft) and stuff.      Does anyone have/know of a keyboard which has this feature and can be used for a PC? I am looking for one which is full size, with a number pad ideally, but a smaller one with the short key-press would do fine.      Thanks!

20090304085409AALTvYK	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Help on a Laptop-Battery Problem ..?	A month ago, I recently bought a new outlet-charger for my laptop. It was working fine as expected, but around 2 days ago, each time I plug it in, the battery does not charge anymore. On the icon, bottom right, it'll say something like: ( example).      55% Plugged in, Not charging.      I mean, it detects the charger plugged in, but it doesnt not charge.   If I leave the plug intact, the "charge" doesnt go up or down. But doesnt drain too easily.   If I leave the plug OUT, of course, it drains and the "level" goes much faster down.      Could it be a problem with my Laptop battery ?   or   A problem with my new outlet-charger .. ?      If its any help, my laptop is about 1 year old.      Thanks in advanced for your help ~

My fathers side of the family and I found his brothers grandson My father only had one brother and he was two years older. They had a falling out over there mother when they were in there thirties and never spoke again. So I never really new them to much up to about ten years old is all and not much of that except at the grandparents house.  So when I found this young man who is the same age as my son and the same name as his father and grandfather I thought how neat.  so i wrote him with all the info I had with the names asking him and he wrote me back excited and wanting to know about his uncle my dad because nobody never mentioned him.  How weird ha.  Any way his dad did tell him his grandfather had a one brother at least.  So I asked him if he would like some old pictures and he said yes and I sent them with a little info on the family but I never would tell him what really happen because it would not be good news Just the good stuff I could remember and its been about three days since I sent the pictures to his email and he has never even put a message on my facebook are my email dont you think that is really rude since I went to the trouble of giving him pictures his family has probably even never seen including his grandfather and great grandparents.

So i am in the process of taking everything off. The problem is i am trying to save programs that i had gotten over the years as well (so i can reinstall them once i wipe it clean) but i can not find the product key for 2 of my programs. I looked for the paper i had it written down on and i can not find it and i have opened the program itself looking under about in each program to find it but they don't say what the key is. So my question is how could i find out or figure out what the key is for TopStyle Pro and Zend Studio 5.0?      Thank you :),   Rach

20090304085722AADdJJv	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Laptop won't charge and the fan is making a noise because of it?	My laptop's fan is making a "Grrrr" sound and letting off warm air. I thought that the laptop was overheated so I turned it off for 3 hours WHILE KEEPING IT CHARGED, it cooled down but it was still  making the noise after I turned it on. I don't think the fan is broken because I got this laptop about 4 months ago.      *It makes the noise for 5 seconds while letting out warm air and then the noise stops for 5 seconds without letting out air.    *It's also not recharging I almost never use my laptop without the battery charging so it's almost always charging and I always have the power plan on "Power Saver". I turned off the charger and the bottom of the laptop seems to be cooling off and the pattern of the "Grrr" noise is changing like it lets out air and makes noise for 5 seconds stops for 2 seconds starts again for 3 seconds and stops for 1 second like it's completely random.      I turned it off for about 2 hours with the charger OFF and the noise completely went away.      I think I'm answering my own question when I say that the fan is making the noise because the battery is getting too hot so it's trying to cool it off but what I don't understand is WHY is the battery not charging and only getting hot.

20090304084756AAsjkRn	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Cant log in to XP! Help!!!!?	My computer at home caught some type of virus and I downloaded some free antivirus software..... I think it was Avast? Anyways I shut it down and restarted the computer and went to click on the main account to log in to the computer. When I did that there was a small message saying that it was loading my personal settings and then it showed my desktop background and almost immediately turned around and logged me off.      I've tried to do a system restore while in safe mode but it still would not let me log in. Is there anything I can do to fix this problem? Or should I just take my computer to the gun range and open fire? HELP!      Oh, also someone told me to use the main disk that came with the computer to wipe everything out and do a full system restore but Im not sure if I even know where those disk are.....or even if I still have them for that matter!

20090304094238AAxP0mC	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Buying new Mac - need advice?	Hi all. I already know I am getting a new iMac. Have been waiting for the upgrades in specs.      I am getting the 2.93 GHZ with 4G of memory.      Beyond that, I have two questions I need opinions on:      Graphics card: Ships with Nvidea GT120. The GT 130 is an extra $135, and the Radeon 4850 is $180. I do plan to play World of Warcraft, Diablo III and Starcraft 2 on it, but I don't necessarily need to max out settings. Do the graphics cards considerably help with internet video/netflix streaming and the like? Or is just for games or video editing?      Snow Leopard update: If I buy the computer now and the new OS comes out in a month or two, do I get a free upgrade or do I have to pay. i waited six months for the bump in specs - I could wait two more for the new OS if it's gonna cost me another $100 to upgrade. that's Apple's policy there?      THANKS for any advice!!!

Well, this just happened now, I haven't really got into much detail of it but i really need someone who knows about it. Well, normally. My computer just says 'no signal' and it's because my plug in the back of the computer is slightly out. So, i place it back in the slot as usuall. As I went to go sit back down, my screen went grey. Now my computers grey, and i can't tell different colours. Green becomes yellow etc. It's really annoying atm. Can someone tell me how to get it back to normal? the plug is as far in as possible. I don't know what to do. It's nothing to do with the brightness setting etc. PS my computer is a Packard Bell Viseo.      Anyone know what to do? (: would appreciate.   Looking for a best answer.

20090304110635AALnXxr	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Do I need BGP to route a  multiplexed dual T1 connection and a cable  modem connection from  another provider?	I have to setup a dual multiplexed T1 with an incoming cable data line and route them so local user traffic goes out the cable line, but incoming traffic uses the Dual T's.  I'm assuming that BGP is not possible because the cable company does not allow it.  So I need to route everything for our end statically.   What is the best way to do this?  Is there a hardware recommendation that you can make that would support heavy business use and support the configuration?  I've looked at   the XINCOM XC-DPG50, but that seems to be for home and small business use.  I need something more robust.  I considered having an ethernet wic and two T1 wics coming into a Cisco router/firewall, but I am concerned about how I would address the routing.   I'm assuming I will have a cable modem between the cable drop and the Cisco router.  I just have no idea how any of this would handle the routing.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.
20090304114430AAzfKGx	Computers & Internet;Security	How can I be sure I removed all remnants of a computer virus?	My antivirus software is Norton 360. It detected a "TrojanBrisv. A" virus in one of my files. I tried to use their virus removal tool, but it said that the virus "was not found" on my computer. But it still showed as a threat in Norton.    I looked at the details and tried to delete the specific file that they said the virus was, but my computer wouldn't delete it. So, I went in safe mode and deleted it and emptied the recycling bin.       The file itself is not there now and I've run three comprehensive check scans with Norton and it doesn't seem to find the virus anymore. but is there anyway I can be sure that it's not there anymore?       Thanks :]

I am taking my computer in for repairs, so I want to back up my entire system. The software that the seagate came with sucks, is there a good way for me to back up my whole system? And if so, could I boot up from the external, and run my programs from there? Or should I just copy my files and applications over, by drag and dropping them? There is plenty of room on the seagate, it is a firewire connection, I am running Mac OS 10.4.11.

But I couldn't make it work so I deleted everything in the bootcamp disk because there was no "uninstall" thing.  Anyways now no matter how many times I eject the bootcamp disk on my desktop, it still appears when I restart the laptop.  I just want it completely gone, forever.  I don't know what to do anymore because everything in the disk is deleted.  I even went to "disk utility" and erased the bootcamp there, but nothing!  please help me!

20090304102438AA5zQrn	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	New Dell Laptop Defects?	Today I got my Dell Laptop through the mail. It has a few defects:   - the top panel thing (where the keyboard is), keeps popping off in the right hand corner. You can push it back in but it pops out again.   - there are these keys at the top, which you touch to activate them. But the volume one seems to be permanently pressed down and the volume screen won't go away from the screen. I suppose it's again to do with the panel.   What should I do? I assume I have to send it back but how exactly?   Any help greatly appreciated. Thanks
20090304094853AACe7jk	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Why do some sites disable right clicking?	I assume it's to stop people from right-clicking and then saving pictures from the site but it seems pointless to me since if I wanted the picture, I could do a screen capture.  And being on a Mac, it even has the feature of taking a screen capture of a specific area, which is almost as easy as just saving it.      Is there another reason sites do this?
20090304111700AAmO4kF	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	Reformat my Windows Hard Drive to Use as an external on my Mac with OS X 10.5?	First off I have a Hard Drive Dock for use with internal drives to make them usable as external drives via USB. I am trying to use Disk Utility on my Mac With OS X 10.5 Leopard, following several guides put out on the internet of how to erase it. But now that I've tried erasing it, it is still not completely back to 1TB (it's at 931.5 GB) and still has some sort of image still on it but is recognized as empty, which seems odd. It did have Windows XP on it but I thought that erasing it would have gotten rid of it in Disk Utility, but maybe it didn't and that is why it has around 70 Gigs missing? Also it is only viewable in Disk Utility and not on the Desktop. So I am wondering if that is relevant. So I guess my major question is if this is all part of the process of switching it from being Windows based to Mac based, or am I making some big mistakes? If you have done this before or have the answer please let me know. Thanks.

I want to get our entertainment out of the Stone Age. Currently using Windows Me OS from 2000.      I have $700 to work with now, and recently acquired AT&T DSL high-speed.   I have a new Wii system that I want to go online with.   I have a Zune.   I am starting a small business website.    I just bought a 32 inch Magnavox TV with the PC compatibility. See:  http://reviews.cnet.com/flat-panel-tvs/p...       I would like to know if this will be worth my time or what is a better choice for near free TV.  http://www.satellitepcbox.com/?hop=lucad...       It would be nice if everything worked together and was expandable for the future.   I do not know much about the future of computers and entertainment other then the price of one today usually is in the landfill tomorrow. If any one has some good suggestions to what and how I will make it out of the Stone Age prepared please say something.      Should it be the Apple Mini, HP or other? The mini seems small in comparison yet what do I know.      Thank you.

20090304103228AA4RwnW	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Can Somebody Help Me Get The Right Laptop?	I've been wanting to buy a new laptop, but I'm having a hard time finding one that would fit my preferences, so I could do with some advice on where to look.      My budget is €1,500, but something that goes a little above that would be okay too.      I'd mainly be using it for visual arts, animating, rendering 3d models, designing etc., so a high ppi screen would be helpful, and a decent graphics card. (I already have the necessary software for all these things, so I won't need anything to come with it on purchase.)      I'd also be using it for music editing (again, I have the software), I don't need any fancy mics, I have them already, so a bog standard laptop mic would do fine.      It doesn't have to be too light or small, although of course it would help, and sturdiness would be important too (I'm a bit of a clutz).      I hope this brief isn't too hard too fill. I'm pretty fussy, so if anyone could give a slight nudge in the right direction, it would be massively appreciated.      Thanks for your time,   Sir Gherkin Pickle VII

20090304100302AAFzSZJ	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Windows XP Blue Screen of Death during startup?	I can login to my account in windows but after about 3 minutes or so, it crashes with the infamous blue screen of death. This happens every time during the startup, it will not crash after I restart by hitting the reset button.       I also realized one strange thing. If I restart the computer after login to the windows quick enough before it shows me the blue screen of death, it will not crash the second time I login after the restart.      I always get different but similar windows error codes regarding the page fault or memory problems like: PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA 0x00000050. So, I replaced my RAM with a new one. I suspect there must be some drivers causing the problem. I formatted the drive to have a fresh windows installed. It was good for a while, but the blue screen of death comes back again after some time. Does anyone have any clues of what might be causing this?

I want it to have the ability to add chapters and menus among other features, so i can really customize my dvds.

When booting, it gets to the "windows xp loading screen - with the scrolling bar underneath" and then it just re-boots.      It asks everytime if you want to start in safe mode/last good config but still will not load.      I thought maybe a bad sector on the hdd, but after looking around I have seen that it could be a virus which has changed the registry.      I currently have the hdd in 'my' pc running as a slave but can't find any viruses as-of yet, I DO NOT have a win xp cd so I can't recover/repair.      Is there a way to 'reset' the registry on his hdd while using mine to run the computer....?      sorry if any confusion, I have his hdd in my pc and want to fix a restart error on his hdd.      thanks      Darren

I got an instant message from a friend who I now know apparently has a virus, I'm not sure what. I believe that the virus on her computer sent me the link I got and said omg is this you? I clicked on the link, it said download, but I didn't realize it was an .exe, not a .jpg.      I tried to open the picture, the program said it couldn't then I rolled over it and realized it was .exe, a Win32 Cabinet Extractor.      When I go onto messenger now, I try to talk to someone, but I can't type after a bit and then starts opening and closing IM windows. Then it stops.      I think it must of sent the link I got it from to my contacts.      I ran my anti-virus program and it found one risk, in C:\windows\fxsteller.exe which I believe has been deleted. It said the risk was a w32.Spybot.Worm or something.      Though it still opens and closes the windows in lightspeed times in MSN.      Can someone help? I don't really need to use MSN that much, though it is helpful, however this is my mums computer and I don't want her to find out somehow, like if it does something else that hasn't happened to me yet.      She only uses the computer for her school work, she's a teacher.
