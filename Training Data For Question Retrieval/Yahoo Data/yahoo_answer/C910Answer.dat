50d1a0f002c90cccdc4a9893cf8d22f5aa	You'll probably get a bunch of people pushing their own network marketing company saying they have the best training but from experience most have sub-par training.<br>  <br>  You're much better off finding an internet marketing mentor or generic training program that will teach you specific internet marketing tactics that will work with any biz opp or program you promote.  When you acquire that knowledge you can literally walk into any program and do 6 or even 7 figures.  Anyone who thinks that statement is untrue has mindset problems and will most likely not succeed at anything.<br>  <br>  Just my 2 cents.|`|yyZeOAONaa	All network marketing companies say they have the best training, but in all actuality they don't.  If you are comfortable with hounding your friends, family, and/ or neighbors and talking to every stranger within 3 feet of you, then yes, there are many companies with great training programs.  Then there are all of those home meetings, conventions, and conference calls you must attend.  If you are ok with this, any company will do.<br>  <br>  What you should consider learning is attraction marketing. Attraction marketing is the process by which you learn to attract qualified prospects to you on the Internet.  By attracting only qualified prospects to you, any company that you get involved with will be profitable and enjoyable.<br>  <br>  I would recommend getting training before you look at any network marketing company.  Seeks out help and advise.  There are many resources out there which provide quality training that range from free to thousands of dollars.<br>  <br>  Once you understand attraction marketing, go out and find the company that fits with your passions.  If you get involved with a network marketing company that you are not passionate about, you will fail.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
WYjbuu6saa	At first you may be paid a low wage.  But after some time, switch employers at a higher wage.  Wait a couple of years, then switch employers again at a higher wage.<br>  <br>  Worked for me.<br>  <br>  Regarding the posters that commented on your spelling:  You really ought not to let people like this get to you.  Obviously, they don't know what they are talking about and are just trying to get a "jab" out of you.  If you have this thin of skin, I would question whether you belong in a law office - if I was an employer.<br>  <br>  It's a known fact that jobs in the field of Law are drying up FAST!  This is not a good field to invest in.  We simply have way too many Legal Professionals - we have a GLUT!  ("Legal Professionals" includes, but is not limited to: Attorneys/Lawyers, Paralegals, Legal Assistants, Legal Secretaries, Bailiffs, Court Reporters, etc, etc)  So....even IF you finish your studies, in the field of Law, you probably won't be able to find a job.<br>  <br>  The law schools know this - they know the economy/market is SATURATED.  But law students are easy money for them - they have to make very little investment in a law student.  It's a scam really.<br>  <br>  Now if you want a JOB, consider and look into the field of HEALTHCARE!  <There are also scholarships!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|rT3MfFvuaa	First of all please learn to spell and punctuate correctly otherwise you will always be paid such a pittance!  Why not join several employment agencies where you will be sent out to work in a variety of legal firms thus helping you to pick up experience and polish your skills without committing yourself.  Commit to memory every good idea you pick up so you can keep it for further reference.  I am in a similar profession to your own (medical secretary) and I earn about two and a half times per hour than you do, but only because I practise what I preach.  Good luck, use your smarts and one day you too will be handing out the advice!|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	yes that's right, I was a legal secretary a long time ago and I wasn't paid any more than a general office worker - try the agencies because there are desperate for legal secretaries, you might still get the minimum wage but you will get experience and eventually  a good position - train for conveyancing they are in demand|`|fLMCOSWdaa	No, it sucks.  Give it a spell and move on.  Sheesh!!|`|RhI0ndT2aa	You will find that you are always asked to name your salary when applying for legal secretarial positions.  I know, I used to do it too.  Your very best plan is to sign up with at least 3 Employment Agencies who recruit legal secretaries. You will be much better paid, and get stacks of experience.  Eventually you will settle into a permanent job, but all your colleagues will be on different amounts of money. Bizarre I know.  You never get a contract of employment either. Never mind love.  You will always be in demand. Don't despair.

It is too old.  You need to  dispute this with the Equifax, TransUnion, Experian.  Inform them, this bill is over 7 years old and it should be deleted from your file. (the dispute form should be attached or came with your credit report forms when requesting for one.)  Fill out and mail it to them.<br>  <br>  I was told by a financial advisor to pay off the debts that are current or new that are shown on your credit report not some old bills that are over 5 years old.

It stupid of them to do that because no one will pay them if its gonna stay on their credit anyway.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	It does not matter what HIPAA says (although this sounds weird).  Since it is for a debt from 2002, it must be deleted by the end of this year anyway (even if he does not pay).<br>  <br>  Offering to pay was a big mistake.  The statute of limitations probably expired years ago.  He was not required to pay if the statute of limitations expired OR it was not his debt OR both.  However, an offer to pay, once made, can restart the statute of limitations. However, since the offer was not accepted, this may not apply.|`|5BTKscZraa	Bad debt can only be reported on your credit report for 7 years....beginning on the date of the default. This debt is getting close to this 7 year if it defaulted in 2002. It will fall off his credit report naturally very soon. It would be a bit pointless to pay a debt that will fall off naturally anyway in a short amount of time.<br>  <br>  When a debt collector first contacts you, your first step should always be to request validation of the debt per your rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Even if the debt is valid, request validation anyway.<br>  <br>  Send them a letter via Certified Mail + Return Receipt (do not use regular mail) stating:<br>  <br>  Per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, I am requesting written validation of this alleged debt<br>  =====================<br>  <br>  Also dispute directly with the credit bureaus:<br>  <br>  Per the Fair Credit Reporting Act you have the right to request written validation of negative entries on your credit files. Per this law they must validate the item(s) or remove them from your credit file.<br>  <br>  Mail a letter via certified mail with return receipt to all three credit bureaus (Equifax, TransUnion & Experian). Include a photocopy of your driver's license and social security card...If you don't include these, they may write back requesting them, which would slow the process down by several weeks. In your letter, simply state:<br>  <br>  Per the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I am requesting written validation of this item and validation that it is being reported within the 7 year time frame as allowed per the Fair Credit Reporting Act
8ZrYADrfaa	We will not be receiving a check this year. Instead the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 has a plan for lowering the amount of federal withholdings from the paychecks of working individuals by up to $400. In order to balance this, there will also be a refundable credit on our tax returns. This will be in effect for both 2009 and 2010. Taxpayers that are on Social Security will have their withholdings reduced by $250. There will also be changes to the Earned Income Credit maximum and the first $2400 of unemployment recieved will not be taxable.|`|AA12023907	The only people who will get an economic stimulus payment  this year will be those who for some reason were not qualified in 2007 but became qualified in 2008.

fRi9vupQaa	I think the most important thing is the long term health of the area you are in.  If the economy is in a downturn there but there is a diversified economy then it sounds like a good idea.  The tenant will basically pay for your investment as long as rents are high enough there.  I would recommend getting an inspection done on the house and an estimate of the needed repairs before you buy it (you can put an offer in and then reneg on the offer if the repairs are too much).  So it all comes down to what the future holds for where you live.  I don't know your area, maybe you do, maybe you should talk to some local experts.  Also is there demand for rentals there, a lot of places have a very high vacancy rate now.  Even with that it could be a good long term investment.|`|Hpo6PemAaa	It sounds like a very good idea.

AHCelSY1aa	The national arbitration forum is just like a court room where they hear both sides (it's neutral.)  You need to file your complaint with them.  West Union will not.  Go to www.adrforum.com.  Make sure to bring every piece of documentation you have to prove these monies were given to the wrong person. Legal advice will be a waste of your money.  You can go to small claims court rather than go through the national arbitration forum.  Both pretty much the same.

AA10259042	Its chart does not look particularly appetizing but then neither do the charts of 95% of traded stocks currently. Maybe you might want to wait about 6 months and see if the stock drops below 7.00.|`|DWDef2L6aa	Absolutely not. The company is under-performing its industry and the SP-500. SEEs' industry is under performing 75% of all other industry's. Its revenues and earnings are falling. There are no analyst buy ratings to off-set the sell ratings. Money is flowing out of the stock rapidly. I could go on but suffice it to say that the only fundamental area in which SEE ranks in the 50th percentile or higher is share price and that ain't encouraging. As M.B. notes above there aren't any technical reasons to get excited about this stock either. OOOPS, excuse me SEEs' ROA ranks in the 64th percentile. No, that doesn't change anything.

hE4CXKX2aa	Well is this a salery type of pay.  If so it does not matter how many hours you have worked.  You can work 20 hours one week, then the next would be 45, and the next is 30.  So again it does not matter on how many hours you work.<br>  <br>  If $45K is the average you make.  Now does that include overtime or is that just regular pay without overtime.  So you really can't determine this without some other added words like, base pay and such.  But base pay would refer to a salery type.  Or say $45K a year before overtime pay kicks in.<br>  <br>  But since you have said Salary yourself, it would not matter on how many hours you work.   <br>  <br>  Both salary and hourly have their pros and cons.  Hourly can get paid overtime while salary can't.  And some business mix up the meaings by acident too, so watch out and ask if there is overtime pay.|`|0lCnu1g2aa	$21.63/HR  Based on this equation <br>  <br>  salary '/. 52 weeks '/. 40 hrs per week|`|zuGKIWfNaa	Yearly divided by 52 = Weekly<br>  <br>  Weekly divided by 40 = Hourly
PxoKseAiaa	Are you upside down in what you owe on the condo?  Might be better to rent it out while you are in NY.  I would advise though, to hire a professional agency to represent you though.

If you contradict yourself a lot, the less likely your application will pass. My BEST advice is to just be honest, and sell yourself in the fill-in parts.

PxoKseAiaa	Sounds like a better offer came by after she ran your credit.  I agree, a 3 year lease is more attractive than 1.  But, I agree, in a way that she could have called and given you the first option to agree to a 3 year lease or lose out.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, you probably don't have any sort of action against her.  You gave the green light to run the credit, which is not a contract to lease you the premises.  <br>  <br>  It sucks, but perhaps you can call her and explain that you feel you should get either the full amount for the credit check back or at least half since the decision wasn't based on you failing the credit check, but a longer lease that wasn't even extended to you to disagree to.|`|d07683f385c8c5d34bcf9ca4a532395faa	You should look up the tenant rights for your state.

JTKCPNnjaa	It does not matter how many degrees you have, if you have never been an actuary before you need to start with an entry level position; years of experience is mandatory to become a full actuary as well as a battery of exams (there are at least 7 of them) that take months of preparation for each one.<br>  <br>  If you like the thought of being an actuary (you must REALLY enjoy working with numbers) then you should try for the entry positions. These are typically actuarial analyst positions and are mostly running static reports and analyzing basic data, but it is a start.<br>  <br>  If you work at an insurance company, look up an actuary and ask for a quick meeting. If you don't, call the insurance company and ask to talk to someone in corporate relations. They may be willing to set up a short meeting with an actuary so you can discuss this with them.

My partner is on disability and he has a number of credit cards.  None of them have been closed - some of which he has not used in years, so being on disability is not the reason - in fact, I think that would be discrimination.<br>  <br>  On your credit report, there should be a reason why the account was closed - usually in one or two words to the right of or just below the account name, number & status.  If there isn't, make a copy and write a letter to the Credit Bureau asking them to advise why the account was closed.  Or -  you can contact the company or bank that held the account & ask them.  No matter the reason, they cannot deny you credit because you are on disability.<br>  <br>  Good luck, because the only other possible thing I can think of would be that someone has your identity - scary.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	Discover just sent me one of their little slips.<br>  I forgot the exact wording, but they said that you can not use the card if you are collecting unemployment, on disability, and some other things.<br>  <br>  Somehow the credit bureaus found out that you are on disability.<br>  They would only know if you told any one of your creditors.<br>  The creditor immediately reports your status to the credit reports.<br>  /

Even if you do some jail time, you can make sure your friends and relatives hide some of the money you've stolen. Even if you can't use the money you've ripped off; e.g. Bernard Madoff, then others can guard and use the money later. It's sort of like a future huge bank account.

DqgjVbPyaa	I have a funny story for ya....happened to my husband.  He was a waiter at a pizza place and waited on a table full of rude, loud, jerky New York tourists (all men). My husband was quick, accurate and polite, yet they complained the whole night.  The bill was over 50 dollars, and at 15 percent he should have recieved a 7.50 tip, however the table full of jerks left him a crisp, new, one dollar bill.<br>  He took teh dollar and chased them out to their car, and proceeded to tap on the window.  The driver looked scared, but rolled down the window a bit.  My husband smiled and slipped the dollar through the crack and said "Sir, if I were you I would take this dollar and buy yourself some manners"  then whistled back into the restaurant.  His boss was roaring with laughter.  Now I know that might not work everywhere (especially with corporate chains, where you have to kiss A$$ regardless, but this was a mom-an-pop) but see how you can be nice and sometimes never please ANYONE....but you also don't have to take crap from people.

pcHp7Dgkaa	Do not give any money to your employer. It was his responsibility to deduct tax from your pay and he didn't do that so it's too late as far as he's concerned. (He will be in trouble, but that's not your problem).<br>  <br>  From your own point of view, you should make your employer give you an earnings statement or group certificate and you should lodge a tax return well before 30th June 2009. If he won't give you an earnings statement or group certificate, lodge your tax return anyway, but I think you should do it through a tax agent or accountant - they will know what is required in the absence of the correct paperwork.

The best way to find out how to sell your products is to take a couple of weeks to research products.<br>  <br>  What's best is to search for the products that you want to sell and find out how people are listing them, what starting price they're using, if they're using a reserve price, how their descriptions are, what their pictures look like, and how many bids they're getting.  Look at the auction length and where they're listing the products.<br>  <br>  Put this all together in an Excel spreadsheet and follow up each day to track the progress and track attributes of each auction.

RNqRnG86aa	International GAAP is more accurately described as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). IFRS is a set of accounting standards, developed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), that is becoming the global standard for the preparation of public company financial statements. The IASB is an independent accounting standards body, based in London.<br>  <br>  The biggest difference between U.S. GAAP and IFRS is that IFRS provides much less overall detail.  Its guidance regarding revenue recognition, for example, is significantly less extensive than GAAP, and it contains relatively little industry-specific instructions.  <br>  <br>  Probably the best evidence of how much less detail IFRS contains is that IFRS fits into one book, about two inches thick.  In contrast, the FASB paperbacks of pronouncements, plus the paperback version of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force consensuses, measure about nine inches thick, and that doesn’t include all the U.S. authoritative accounting literature.

CL9zXIA7aa	There's no very nice way to say this, but you're screwed. In normal times (and we're certainly not there now) to start a business you need to put down a good portion of your own money to be able to get a loan to start a business. And not only do you not have any of your own money, but you're starting $8,000 in debt. And this is what you need in normal times. As times are so much worse right now, you need to be even more financially secure. I guess that move overseas was not such a good move. I'd suggest trying to land a job in a beauty shop somewhere, pay down your debt, build up a clientele and break out on your own when you have no debt, have some savings and the economy is better. Good luck!

OP8sRCbTaa	You don't have to give a reason to a new employer for terminating your own employment at a previous job.  However, if your new employer asks about it, it becomes difficult to leave the question unanswered.  The most important thing for you to do, is not to lie to them.  The last thing you need is to be caught in a lie.  You should just be honest with them.  Chances are, they will respect that you care about your schoolwork.  Valuing your education is an admirable trait.  Good luck.

26JW5cktaa	Hey-<br>  I worked in retail for about two weeks when i was 17 and HATED it.  I quit wrong and they yelled at me, but now I know how to do it haha.<br>  <br>  What you should do is mention that you won't be able to work anymore to your manager the next time you're working.  You also need to write a letter stating your two weeks notice and give it to him/her then.<br>  <br>  Just write it To Whom It May Concern, state your reasons for leaving (personal issues are always the best excuse lol), and officially put down the last day that you can work (2 wks from that day).<br>  <br>  Say it's been a great experience and all that stuff and you've learned a lot or whatever.  If you write the letter nicely and try to end the job on a positive note, you can use this place as a reference and put it down on applications and your resume when you get a better job down the road.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps and good luck!!!

myG2hhaKaa	You are moving alot, so that is a good thing. But, as mentioned above, if you are working erratic hours, it can make it hard to lose weight. I work at a retail store, so there are no set hours. They schedule you when needed- and it varies. This often makes you tired and you do not have a set schedule. So, you might have some troubles working around your work schedule to find time to workout. <br>  <br>  Also, since your job is very stressful and busy as a nurse, you might be more likely to eat something fast or on the go. Or else, frequent the vending machines that they have in hospitals. Luckily alot of hospitals don't just have the junk machines, they are starting to provide more healthy options through vending machines and cafes. As long as you don't fall prey to run-on-the-go fatty foods and manage your time well, you should be okay. And if you are a stress eater, try to find other ways to cope from stress on the job.|`|ot1ZZexeaa	If anything the erratic hours, demanding (yet rewarding) work seems to pack on pounds faster than the homemade brownies in the break room disappear. It's possible to maintain a healthy body weight, but like any job where you don't have a lot of time to make good eating choices and there are lots of not so good ones in your face, you have to work to ensure you don't gain. <br>  <br>  At the hospital near my home lots of the nursing staff is chubby to morbidly obese.

Most banks are perfectly fine with you opening an account as long as your parents okay it. Some banks will let your parents have control over your account while others require your approval before they let your parents do anything besides deposit money. I would advise setting up an account. If you have the money might as well earn interest on it. The only downside is that you are limited to x amount for withdraws and y ammount for spending. <br>  <br>  I know for a fact that TD (in canada) lets students withraw up to $100 and spend $500 per day|`|AA12071178	I don't think you should have a problem...Although you are probably better off putting your money on a piggy bank!|`|MSBLMlM1aa	u cannot open an account on your own... so answer is only if your parents let u :P
AbRfd29Haa	Yeah, sure. There is no minimum age for a savings account. Your parents could have set one up for you the day you were born... with some restrictions. They usually want a social security number, since, if the account is interest-bearing, they are obligated by the Federal Government to report that as income. <br>  <br>  My son got an account last year, at 17, so he had a place to deposit his paychecks (first real job).

AA11616170	Instead of the hole in the wall, you could take it out over the counter at the bank, and ask for the size notes you want.  One transaction.  If you take it out of the ATM and then join the queue inside, that is twice the hassle.  <br>  <br>  I have gone into a bank (not my own, just close to where I happened to be) to get smaller change, and they wouldn't do it, unless I deposited the note into an account (i.e., open an account with them first) and then withdrew the funds.

26c3882c8862fb989b196c0d5e86733aaa	I guess that it has a lot to do with the limited amount of space available for money in ATM's. If there are two trays of notes, only one will have ￡10 notes, and in order not to run out of notes too soon, the ATM will be programmed to make the payout in ￡20's, and only pay out a single ￡10 when necessary. <br>  <br>  Personally, I always go into the bank to make my withdrawals, and ask for ￡10 notes only, in order to avoid any doubt about the amount I have tendered in a shop. It is possible to be shortchanged when paying small amounts with a ￡20, so by only having ￡10 notes on my person, I can be fairly sure that I am not going to be shortchanged, but I have noticed that when make these withdrawals, the cashier initially brings out a stack of ￡20's until I say that I want only ￡10's; so it seems that ￡20's are the commonest denomination issued to customers.<br>  <br>  I guess that you are going to have to make 7 withdrawals of ￡30 in order to achieve the maximum number of ￡10 notes in your (￡210) withdrawal. <br>  <br>  Incidentally, you should note that no retailer is required to give change, but in practice most do, and with so many items being priced at something 99p. they simply have to, but may still be choosy about accepting large value notes.|`|386524142680a3e18e5b2498e17e6041aa	Why not just go to a bank & get some busted into smaller bills!!|`|LL6aVCp8aa	Take out ￡190 then use another transaction to take out ￡10

AA12065007	Auto finance is what I do for a living and I'm sorry but your question makes no sense.<br>  <br>  True you do need to make at least 12-18 payments on time as agreed for the best score but if you actually sent in $10,850.00 you just made the first 31 payments.<br>  <br>  But to answer your question, no do not pay off the loan a full 35% of your score is based on your payment history so the more payments you make on time as agreed the better your score will be.<br>  <br>  And just so some people will know, no bank (other then the manufacturers) are offering .5% for auto loans right now or ever.

They want to know if you financially responsible by paying debts on time for at least 2 years.<br>  Paying a debt off early doesn't help your score paying it off when it supposed to be paid off...

If you had $50 to start and spent $40, you are left with $10.  If you try to make a purchase over $10, it will be declined.  Also, if you try to use a gift card at a restaurant, note that that restaurant will automatically withhold 20% of the purchase to account for tip.

7B9a65xaaa	In order to qualify for BK you have to default on everything for 6 months prior to filing. So the lates will push you down, possibly into the mid 400's (awful). Right after you are discharged, which takes about 3 months from the date you file, your credit will go up to the low to mid 500's ( still awful) The reason: you now have no debt and 30% of your score is based on your debt to credit limit ratio with the lower the better and now you would be at 0%. Just so you know, most apartment complexes will not rent to you unless you are at least one year from discharge. Lenders will not work with you until you are two years from discharge. The other thing, and this is very important, your lawyer only does the bankruptcy part, it is up to you to deal with the credit bureaus after you receive your discharge. Your account will still reflect your outstanding balance. You will have to get them to update those accounts to reflect that they were included in your BK. Once that happens, your accounts will reflect a 0 balance and thats how you get into the 500's. If you then go out and start up 2-3 secured credit cards. ( b of a and us bank wil require $300 and wells fargo won't work with you until you are 1 year out of BK) Two years after that you will be in the 600's, another 2 years, low 700''s.<br>  <br>  Follow all my instructions and the time to get into either the high sixes or the low seven hundreds : 4 years post BK discharge|`|z88IMXNFaa	Only time and the responsible use of credit will raise your score.

Charge nothing that you cannot afford to pay cash for.  Keep charges under 30% and pay the bill on time.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the bankruptcy will stay on your credit report for 10 years and will be something of a drag until it disappears.|`|xd7tSmQeaa	Generally speaking, after about a year of the bankruptcy discharge you should be OK.

DAMZKbpDaa	$3500? You need to adjust something, either withholding or make estimated tax payments, starting now for next year.<br>  <br>  For $3500, the IRS will accept any offer for installment payments that will pay off in five years or less. Since you owe over $1000, you will get a under-payment penalty, and of course interest will accrue the whole time you are paying it off. The IRS will charge you $105 to set up the payment plan.<br>  <br>  So file your taxes, pay as much as you can afford, to cut down penalties and interest, and offer to do an installment agreement. After you file, you can do this online <a href="http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=149373,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0...</a> or send in Form 9465, either with your taxes or separately.<br>  <br>  But be sure to account for estimated tax payment for 2009, too, in your plan, if you think you will owe also for 2010.<br>  <br>  Edit: <br>  OK, no estimated payments needed.<br>  If you cannot afford $60/mo. (more would be better), you may need to speak to someone at the IRS (they will send you a letter with a contact number when they assess your tax) to make less payments a month, or put it in a "hardship" status. If you are unemployed now, that may be necessary.|`|d4e41d3df62e651aeb95bc6da71e5eacaa	Too many of us are going to have to face the fact that all this "bailout" foolishness has to be paid by somebody, and it's a cinch low/no income folks are not going to share the burden. Neither is bankrupt financial pits and dieing union infested car companies. Those who work and struggle to keep their bills paid are being asked to pay mortgages for those who have gone over their heads with no hope of ever paying their obligations. We are being forced to rescue those who will relapse into default as soon as the subsidies end, then where do they get the next handouts? This superficial patch is more democrat BS that pushes the problem into the future and does nothing to address the fundamental problem. If this kind of socialist idiocy keeps up I'm going to consider joining those who are beginning to demand some personal accountability from our politicians. Either get real or get out. This bloated system we've allowed to develop is already taking as much as a third (combined federal state and local) of what honest workers earn, to support those who refuse to support themselves. Enough is enough.
OHRmkXfnaa	I see that your answers are all over the map. Let me see if I understand the facts correctly.  I gather that your father has died and that your dad's estate transferred to your stepmother (whether by Will, Trust or otherwise).  Therefore, I am assuming that you are not currently entitled to anything, and probably will not be entitled to anything because your stepmother could simply give everything to her children or others that she chooses.<br>  <br>  If my understanding of the facts is correct, then here is the deal.  The answer partly depends on what state you live in, so my first recommendation is to pay for a probate attorney to help you.  You want a well-drafted settlement agreement between you and your stepmother.  Do not attempt to do this yourself.  Also, get yourself a good CPA.  Interview a couple of attorneys and CPAs to make sure you are getting the right answer.<br>  <br>  Here is some general advice.  Under federal law, the settlement sounds like a gift, because you are not receiving the property as a result of bequest, devise or inheritance.  Again, I am assuming that your stepmother is just giving you a payment that is not a direct result of your father's death or a contest over your father's estate.  As such, she would have to pay gift tax if the amount you are receiving exceeds $1 million. (The answer stating that gift tax is due if it exceeds $13,000 is flat wrong.  Furthermore, you are not responsible for the gift tax.)  <br>  <br>  If there is a question about whether you were entitled to receive something as a result of your father's death, then it may be possible that you are receiving the settlement as a result of inheritance rather than gift.  Amounts received by an heir in compromise of a will contest (in your case, over your father' sestate) are considered an inheritance and thus tax-free. Lyeth, Munro v. Hoey, (1938, S Ct) 21 AFTR 986, 305 US 188, 83 L Ed 119, 38-2 USTC ?9602.  That means that the estate might be responsible for estate taxes, but the amount at stake would have to exceed $2 million in 2008 or $3.5 million this year.  Some states have different estate tax amounts, however.<br>  <br>  In any event, YOU are not responsible for paying any tax UNLESS there was IRD (income in respect of a decedent). That usually applies to stocks and investments. Ask your CPA or attorney about this.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, and sorry to hear about your loss.  Paul Deloughery (paul@delougherylaw.com; www.delougherylaw.com; 602-443-4888; www.azprobate.blogspot.com)|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	That is treated as a gift.  You won't pay anything on it, but she may be subject to Gift Tax if the amount exceeds $13k.|`|xoqQbHi1aa	You need an attorney.  Before you sign anything, have it reviewed by an attorney that works for you, not your stepmother.  Remember that inheritance is not subject to Federal Tax (Estates may be subject to federal taxes, but Inheritance is not).  You need to have your own attorney for your own protection.|`|Umk8n1AJaa	It will be tax as part of your income, as it is consider as other income. In some countries, inheritance is not taxable, and mandated by law that the children of the deceased, legitimate or not, will received a share in the estate  <br>  Personal advice: Consult a lawyer and get what you deserve.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Pay to have an attorney review the plans so that you don't get blindsided.

EXJfoGtAaa	Google Florida statutes and go to chapter 83.  That's the landlord tenant law.  Security deposit and advanced rent are two different things.  Sounds like when you moved in you paid first (month's), last and security.  The landlord cannot co-mingle rent and security deposit.<br>  What does your lease say about early termination?<br>  It sounds like your landlord is trying to change the terms of the lease.  You need an attorney.<br>  realtor.sailor|`|2N6oTOLQaa	For starters read your lease. Its possible that the fee for breaking the lease early is 2 month's rent, plus you have a months worth of rent that is a security deposit that the landlord can keep for damages. So what the landlord is doing is using your security deposit as part of the lease break fee, but you still have to have one months worth of rent on the line for damages until after you move out and do a walk through. I'm not a lawyer, but it seems legit to me.|`|DD6YyrWGaa	First, I would find your lease and check it for the stipulations of breaking your lease to see if what she is saying is actually in your lease. I would then call the Florida State Attorney General's office. They will be able to validate any new laws and if the above is legal.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|laVGEEeraa	Your landlady may be calling it a security deposit, but it sounds like she is really making sure you don't trash the place when you leave and is collecting a clean-up fee, which she will return to you once she finds out that you have left the place in good order.  Many people will simply vacuum and clear out trash thinking that is enough, but leave dirty bathrooms, kitchens and sinks, etc.  <br>  Whatever you do, have the landlady put in writing why she is collecting this deposit in addition to what you have paid already, and any conditions that would cause her not to give it back to you within 15 days of your vacating the premises, so should she be trying to scam you out of your money you have something to sue her with in small claims court.<br>  I wondered about when you gave notice versus when you are leaving.  Years ago I gave notice of intent to vacate on the 2nd of the month (rent was due on the 5th), and was forced to pay not only the next month's rent but also the month afterward as I had not given notice a full 30 days beforehand.
fKE7Rb8laa	Yes the Service should catch this internally.  The estimated tax payments you made during the year should currently be showing as a credit balance on your account for tax year 2008. If the total amount you have as a credit plus the amount of credits on your return equal an overpayment of tax you should receive a refund.  It is difficult to say whether the $50 in question will be applied to 2009 or refunded to you.  You can however verify that you have received credit for all of your payments at any time by contacting the IRS and requesting a copy of your "Account Transcript" for tax year 2008 and/or Tax year 2009.<br>  <br>  Christopher R. Jacquez, EA<br>  www.eTaxRelief.com|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	They are good about finding these small errors. You should get your credit..|`|DAMZKbpDaa	Yes, this type of error the IRS will catch easily.

AA11782843	You don't have to file if you earned absolutely $0 for the year...but if you received employment insurance or if you are involved with any type of alimony or child support situation, it would be recommended to file.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	If you had no income, then there is nothing to file.|`|DAMZKbpDaa	Unless there is some unusual circumstance, you shouldn't file.|`|AA11284831	Why would you?  If you didn't work and had no income there's no reason to file and no benefit from doing so.
DAMZKbpDaa	Depends on state law.<br>  <br>  One thing, you will need to file in the state you work, if they have a filing requirement, and the state you live, again, if they have a filing requirement.<br>  <br>  The "usual" scenario is that you will get credit on your home state tax form for taxes paid in the state of employment. Some states have other agreements.<br>  <br>  Some pro athletes have to file and pay taxes in 30 or more states. And some cities have a tax requirement too.|`|AA11284831	Both, unless the 2 states have a reciprocity agreement in place.<br>  <br>  You file a non-resident return in the state where you work, showing only the income earned in that state.  Then you file a resident return in your home state, showing all income world wide.  Your home state will give you a credit for the taxes paid to the other state, at least equal to the tax that your home state would have collected on the out-of-state income.<br>  <br>  You are not double taxed, but you effectively pay the higher of the 2 states' rates on the out-of-state income.|`|ZeDjn4cVaa	You would file a non-resident tax return in the state where you work and a resident tax return in the state where you live.<br>  <br>  Depending upon the tax law or agreement in your two states, you would first pay taxes to one state (usually the state where you work).  Then you would calculate the taxes due on the same income in the other state (usually  the state where you live) and take a credit for the taxes paid to the other state on the same income.  The other state tax credit prevents paying tax on the same income twice.<br>  <br>  Some neighboring states have agreements that provide special treatment for interstate commuters -- people who live on the border of one state and drive across the border regularly to work.<br>  <br>  Richard K<br>  <br>  This advice was based upon my understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts described by you.

7b30cd2ddc0ec6ae3f9c56fb6cce9ff1aa	Well, let's assume you make the federal minimum wage of 7.25 an hour. This may be different in your state, but we'll go with the standard 7.25. So all that we have to do is take 200 and divide that by our 7.25 wage. This equals just under 30 hours before taxes, so after taxes you'll be looking at roughly 32 hours or so. If you are working part-time--say two 8 hour shifts per week--it will take exactly two weeks or four 8-hour shifts to accumulate 200 dollars.

PxoKseAiaa	Divorce only affects credit if either of you neglect to pay the bills that you had together.  Typically, when someone gets divorced this happens.  People argue over who is going to pay what, and then nothing gets paid, or it is paid late.  Also, you are going from a 2 income (possibly) household to having to upkeep 2 households and support children at both.  If both parties are mindful of the debt they have as a married couple, their credit should be fine.  Very rarely, does that occur, as most divorces are acrimonious.  <br>  <br>  Yes, if you are in a community property state, anything bought during marriage is the responsibility of both parties.|`|5BTKscZraa	Correct about community property states.....<br>  <br>  In a community property states, debt acquired during the marriage (as opposed to debt acquired prior to the marriage) is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law, unless there is specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular debt. If you live in a community property state (listed below), both spouses are held accountable for any and all debts acquired during the marriage, even if the account was is listed exclusively in one spouse's name.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	Yes, Texas is a community property state. That means all debts and assets gained during the marriage (and yes, possibly those gained before marriage_ are split 50/50.<br>  Divorce can seriously affect your credit.

AA11573642	Let me congratulate you for your project and i wish you all success !.<br>  Nonprofit incorporation is very similar to creating a regular corporation except that a nonprofit must take the extra steps of applying for tax-exempt status with the state in which it incorporates and with the IRS.<br>  The following steps should be taken :-<br>  Select a name that is legally available in your state.<br>  File your "articles of incorporation," and pay a filing fee.<br>  Apply for federal and state tax exemptions.<br>  Create bylaws that will dictate how the corporation is run.<br>  Appoint an initial board of directors.<br>  Hold the first meeting of the board of directors<br>  Apply for any licenses or permits that your corporation will need to operate in your state and local municipality.<br>  In order to qualify for tax-exempt (501c3) status , you should create a concept paper and document your ideas with the structure for the organization you propose and you must share your concept with like minded persons and involve them as initial founders.<br>  Next step would be to contact an attorney to assist you in preparing incorporation filings in your state. After your organization in incorporated, obtain an employer ID number, and apply for 501c3 tax-exempt status with the IRS.<br>  <br>  Your funding requirements will depend on various factors , for which you have to prepare a plan which will be of use to you in approaching potential funding sources|`|6JXrlnYsaa	Go to www.irs.gov.<br>  click "charities and nonprofits"<br>  All the info you need is there.|`|AA11103493	Not sure, but do a search and you'll find lots of useful links.

The sooner the better. If you are not debt free then your first course of action should be to get $1,000 in an emergency fund, next pay off all your debts except your house starting with your smallest amount first. Once you pay off your first debt apply that payment with your other payment on your second smallest amount. Every bill you pay off will take less time. Once all of your debt is paid off (ecept your house that comes later) then put 3-6 months worth of saving in a money market type account. At that point you should start contributing at least 15% of your take home pay into investments. Start by contributing as much as you can in your 401k up to the point that they match. If they don't match still put some into your 401k but ONLY if you have extra after you put all you can into what's called a Roth IRA.  You can usually only put about 3k a year into a Roth IRA so if you have more to get you up to 15% then plug the rest back into your 401k.

I have four separate accounts used for the same thing you are wanting. One of my accounts is a business account that I really do not need but I have an auto pay that goes into it and it is a long process to change so I just leave it alone. <br>  <br>  Sounds like you might do better off with a Quick-Books type of accounting system rather then a business account. With a Business account you have to have a business license to open the account, do you have one? With a simple checking account you can do the same thing you are wanting from a business account, if all you want to do is keep your working money separate from your personal money there are easier ways then opening a BA.<br>  <br>  If you decide to open an BA (Business Account) do you have an accountant? Do you have an accountant anyway? <br>  <br>  The only plus I can see to having a BA is if you are also incorporated. If you want to be or are thinking of being Inc. here are some things you should know.<br>  <br>  Get your paper work from Legal Zoom.com.

OLXv3DEAaa	This questions a little confusing?<br>  <br>  If you're under 18 you can only get a bank account if its like a joint account with someone over 18. Usually the adult on the account has to be your parent/guardian. <br>  <br>  I had an account that my mom signed for when I was in high school, it was basically a normal checking account with debit card, checks, etc. The only thing different from an 'adult' account was that my mom was also on the acct. and I think she could have taken out money if she'd wanted to and stuff like that. I think all banks have those accounts, just have your mom/dad take you to open one.

z4slPzgSaa	Working for an agency doesn't mean regular work, and the government are making it harder for hospitals to hire agency because of the cost to the NHS, so that's something to consider. Also, the NHS guarantees a great pension on retirement, working as agency means you will have to set money aside yourself for your retirement, something I know I would never stick to!  All the extra cash you make every week would go on your own holiday, sick and pension pay, so could add up the same as NHS pay in the end.<br>  <br>  However agency work is so flexible, you can work whenever you want, depending on you means.  You could also bump up your NHS pay by working one agency shift a week, and more during your annual leave if your looking for quick cash, something which is really popular with my colleagues.|`|WzKrZoHQaa	If the papers are to be belived then yes money would be the driving factor.

AA12016308	question is kind of confusing - are you talking about the ads on the right hand side of google when you do a search? Or adsense ads? It may be adsense ads and those are placed on blogs, websites, emails, etc and when someone clicks on the ad the person who has the adsense account gets paid for sending someone to the website. Lookup google adsense and so some research on it. If its pay per click then those ads you see on the right hand side of google are advertisements set up my affiliate marketers mostly and are paying a certain amount for every time someone clicks on their ad to see their sales page.

It doesn't make a difference if they don't have your current info on where you live etc. They still will report you to the credit bureaus and ruin your score. And they will continue to look for you.

The debt will not  disappear and will not go away just because you want to ignore it. You owe, you pay.|`|moiMSUYYaa	Don't add to your debt. Cut up your credit cards or freeze them in a block of ice in the freezer. <br>  <br>  Pay the cards down by paying off the smallest one first and then applying that payment to the next.

7E2uVglzaa	As far as i know logo design charge (it is similar to cd label design i think) is in average: 50$-100$. I think you should charge something like this. But logo design cost depends on logo size - if your label is bigger than general logo (at websites, for example) - you should charge more than 100$. Also the charge depends on time which you spend to work on your label. Average salary for 1 hour of work as a freelance designer is 10$ - maybe this also will help you to calculate your charge.
xd7tSmQeaa	Read FDCPA on debt collectors and your rights.  Also visit Budhibbs.com for information on junk debt buyers (JDB's)<br>  <br>  Send the junk debt buyer a letter stating that the hospital sent the bill to the wrong address. Make the JDB an offer to settle and should they accept, they have to immediately and permanently remove the item from your credit reports.  <br>  <br>  If the JDB doesn't want to do this then use FDCPA to stall them.  Then use your court system to bury them in discovery.  In other words make them prove they are legally allowed to collect this particular debt.<br>  <br>  Or just go to the hospital and pay the bill in person.  Then send the JBD a letter telling them the bill is paid and that their services are no longer needed.  Of course, you will have to include a letter from the hospital proving that the debt is paid.  <br>  <br>  Just don't let the JDB push you around.  They will threaten you with jail but it's an empty threat.  It's all aimed at getting you to part with your money.  Just stay off the phone with them and NEVER give out your banking and/or credit card number.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	There are two type of collections agencies, those who work on behalf of the company you owe money to, and those who engage in "Factoring" - buying up bad debts. If the Hospital is refusing to accept payment then they might have sold the debt.<br>  <br>  BTW, changing address when you know that you owe money and not letting the entity who you owe that money to have the new address will never carry weight as a non-payment excuse. You are better off pleading poverty - saying that you were unable to pay it, not that you were attempting to defraud them with regard to the debt.<br>  <br>  You could try mailing the the settlement in the form of a Bank Issued Cheque/Check with it clearly marked as payment for your outstanding account and nothing else. If they cash it then your debt is cleared and they will have to sort it out with the collection agency. If they return it then you will have no option but do deal with the collection agency and pay the extra fees that they will impose.
8c44cac7a547e9bbb2bfa16207440753aa	The "optimal capital structure" is not a real life business concept that is actually used  by anybody outside of education, but rather is a part of the Modigliani-Miller theorem first proposed by F. Modigliani and M. Miller in 1958.<br>  <br>  The capital of the old AT&T was equal to the total capital of all the resulting companies. As a result, no matter how you measure  "the optimal capital structure", they are both the same, overall. Now, if you want to compare  "the optimal capital structure" of each of the breakup companies you'd need much more detailed information as to how everything was divided up at that time. While this might be a past time activity, getting all the figures and doing the math on them seems totally pointless.

Read your lease, if you have that arrangement, you may just be able to continue month to month and then give the required notice when you need to move out. (most are 30 days, some can be more- in CA, if you have lived in unit more than a year, a landlord needs to give 60 days to you, but you only have to give 30 days notice as the tenant)<br>  If that is not in your lease, then honesty is the best policy and if they are requesting a new lease, tell them you are only comfortable in  a month to month tenancy based on your employment situation, but will give 30 days notice if that situation changes.

A gallon of gas runs maybe what?..under 5 bucks, You can mow maybe 2-10 yards..maybe more, depending on the size of each yard you mow. Plus mowing lawn is a great way to get landscaping experience, you also burn calories and work out, any labor you do..think of it as (getting paid to work out) so that way it's registered in your mind as a win/win situation. Always be polite when you go up and ask, if they don't want you to mow their lawn, then politely thank them anyways for their time.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to walk all over the neighborhood.

It's not a waste of time walking around if you don't 'get any customers, why?...it's a nice workout anyways.<br>  <br>  <br>  At the end of the day, you've accomplished about 7 things or more..<br>  1.

Cost you NOTHING. Plus your parents will be proud you can take responsibility.<br>  <br>  Math:<br>  $3-5 per gallon<br>  say you get 10 customers for medium size yards. 10x$5 = $50<br>  and say 3 of them wanted trimming so 3X$2 = $6<br>  and 2 of them wanted the whole package. $10 bucks<br>  $66 bucks, subtract the gas money.<br>  <br>  You just made 'about' $60 bucks in one day. Now we all know we mow once a week, or once every two weeks. $60x4weeks = $240 bucks a month. That's a lot of money if you learn how to save. You could afford a car by the time you're 'legally' able to drive.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm sure you'll get more than just 10 customers. Always tell them your name so they know who you are. Always thank them when they pay you, and ask if you can mow next time.<br>  <br>  <br>  - Also bring a notepad to write down names, addresses, and what kind of service they want and how often they want you to mow. Maybe get their number to call them and notify them that you're going over to do your service, that way they can pay you. Also always do a great job, because if you cheat them out their money, they wouldn't want you back their again.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can make maybe $50 - 200 bucks a week. Not bad for a $14 year old.

Case in point...when I was a teenager I had a motorcycle and a hot car.  I thought nothing of going over 100 MPH on both.  I would weave in and out of traffic.  I got busted for reckless driving.  I would never do any of that today because my young kids need a dad to support them.  The same would be true on the job. A younger person would take unnecessary chances like driving dangerously in a company vehicle...not being meticulous in checking their work for errors...not following directions because of contempt of authority or some other reason
MlQ0GIpoaa	Bring your ID and Social Security card. Though it's only an interview, it's possible they could make a decision to hire you on the spot. It's not likely, but it does happen.<br>  <br>  The two questions that they may ask are:<br>  <br>  1) Why should we hire you?<br>  2) Why would you like to work for Sears?<br>  <br>  Those are really tough questions to answer, but if you anticipate the questions ahead of time, answering will be easier and you will come off as being more confident. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|xkJZwnHTaa	The only question I remember being asked there is how I handled a conflict.

AA12186845	Checking acc is where you can write your own checks and they pay nothing or very low interest rates.<br>  <br>  Savings acc is where you cannot have check books to write check but maybe can have cashiers check from the bank but interest rates are normally higher than checking acc. Today, interest rates are very low for all types of deposits at banks.<br>  <br>  CD is where you have to put your money into it for a set term limit. If withdraw or cancel before mature then big big penalty. I mean big because the banks wants to charge you a leg and an arm to make big profits from you.<br>  <br>  Never cancel early on a CD unless it is an emergency but if you need to do so then maybe ask them to withdraw a small amount because the smaller the amount withdrawn has less penalties involved.

4ooXYuYFaa	Well, finance as an academic study is focused largely on the time value of money. Taking this into consideration, finance always has a heavy emphasis on corporate decision making and valuations. By combining the two, one can assess the corporations in which they wish to invest and also rely on the time value of money to estimate the growth, stability, and diversity of a 401k.
AA11071711	A calling card is simply a business card with your name on it.<br>  <br>  Before the age of phones and email, people would have to drop by someone's house of business to see if they were home. They would present whomever answered the door with a card stating their name and any titles they have.<br>  <br>  If the person you wanted to visit wasn't home, your card would be waiting for them so that they would know you had stopped by.<br>  <br>  Today its much easier to call for an appointment, so calling cards are much more rare. They've effectively been replaced by business cards with your name, title, and contact information.<br>  <br>  I think the idea as an Obama impersonator, would be to have business cards to hand people. "Hello. I'm Barack Obama. Here is my card", or when someone asks "Who are you?", you can hand them your card that simply says "Barack Obama - President of the United States" on it.

MmTe8W8uaa	Each party must claim as income the fair market value of what they received (in your case, the services of the painter).<br>  <br>  If you own the office and the painting increased its value, then it is a capital improvement.  You are not allowed any deduction, but its basis is increased, so you will have a smaller capital gain (or a larger capital loss) when you will it.<br>  <br>  If you rent the office, or the painting simply restored the office to its original condition, or both, then you may be able to claim some sort of deduction.  However, it might not be an "expense", unless its expected useful life is less than a year or a Section 179 election is made.  You might be required to treat it as a capital expenditure and deduct only the depreciation each year.

AA12065007	After 12-months if you keep doing what your doing now you can expect to be somewhere between 625 & 650.<br>  <br>  This is exactly how I rebuilt my credit after my BK back in 2000.|`|xd7tSmQeaa	You can do your FICO score tremendous good if you pay the balance off at the end of the month and keep your balance less than one third of the available credit. <br>  <br>  In 6-8 months you should be good.  In a year you will be golden.  What your exact score will be is impossible to tell.  Each credit reporting agency does their own calculations to get a number.  And each number is different.  The range that FICO scores generally fall in is 350 to 850.  The higher the number the better.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, even though the information is identical, one agency will show your score as 790 while another will show 720.  It's weird and frustrating at the same time.  Of course when applying for credit the finance company will use the lower score so they can charge higher rates.  Keep this is mind.  <br>  <br>  Funny thing is that bad credit is better than no credit.  But I do not suggest bad credit.  With banks tightening up their requirements having a FICO score of 700 isn't near as good as it would have been six months ago.  To get the really good rates now your FICO has to be 750 or better.  <br>  <br>  Your credit is your life.  It will determine where you live, work and what you drive.   So take good care of it.  <br>  <br>  Congratulations on being responsible!

7b30cd2ddc0ec6ae3f9c56fb6cce9ff1aa	For research and clinical work you will definitely need at least an MA and for clinical work you will almost definitely want to get a PhD and prescribe medicine. You would also want to pursue medical school if you would like to be a practicing neurologist. Sometimes it is best not to consider the minimum amount of paper required to pursue a career. For careers like neuroscience or psychology it really is better to take a moment to contemplate exactly how much knowledge will be required to succeed. Even if only 4 years of undergraduate work were required to be a practicing psychologist it is unlikely that you would gain a mastery, or even solid confidence of your abilities, in the field. Graduate work is much more focused and you will learn more in a 2 years master's program than you will in all four years of your undergraduate work.|`|u0cLGQ6laa	no idea !! can u please help with my hw plz <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ak3H1X_ydUAaddy3.CLEJJXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307131827AALOAL1">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  i need ceo but i dont know how its related to communication skills <br>  professor <br>  and any other 3rd job <br>  thanks in advance

1hciyvKdaa	Its amazing how low books and dvds can be there. Yes it is true. I have had one guy not mail me my dvd, one email and my money was returned. <br>  Ithe person with the 100 per cent rating is the one I would buy from that or do the amazon one with free shipping if you have more to buy and it also qualifies. Just make sure all items say qualify for supper shipper it takes 25.00 in purchases to get that deal. From private sellers there is a base rate for shipping so they cannot rip you off on shipping like ebay sellers can. Yes trust the site, yes you should be happy with the purchase. People on amazon really do seem to care about thier customers, just remember, weather can hold up shipping times, people could be gone for a day or two and not see you purchased something. they dont just sit at their computer all day ok. I am very pleased with Amazon. For the xmas season they were the number one online seller the news reported. Amazon purchases are so easy to return, you say, broken or item not as good as expected,a and they do return your stuff easily and with free return shipping. I have not ever needed to return items from private sellers there.|`|2SxBqNd2aa	I worked for Amazon in their receive department quality control. They get the items very cheap by buying so much. They have damaged items, such as a dinged corner, torn page, torn packaging, etc... that are called used under the used and new selection. They mostly make money on shipping and handling.

NwkZ5OmCaa	You know how when you get your paycheck, there are taxes withheld?  And how when you file your taxes at the end of the year, you either have a refund or owe because the money was just a guestimate of what your actually tax liability would be?<br>  <br>  The early payout works the same way.  The money withheld was merely withholding.  Invariably they only withhold 10% for income tax and if you take out a lot, or have other income, it's woefully inadequate.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	You paid SOME of the tax when you received the money.  You must still pay the rest.  When you filed (if the accountant did it correctly), you received credit for the tax that you already paid and most pay ONLY the remaining portion.   You are not being taxed again.  The total tax, both what was paid already and what must still be paid, is ONLY the tax and penalty computed when filing, not the sum of that plus the amount earlier.|`|AA10834046	You are correct that the full pension amount gets added to your taxable income in the year you took the money.<br>  <br>  The taxes you owe is based on your total income + pension minus what you already paid from your weekly salary plus any taxes that were taken out of the pension money.<br>  <br>  The $23,600 plus your salary for the year is what your tax bracket is based on.  You are not being taxed twice on the money.  It's just that the more you earn, the more you owe.|`|8e373a7bc6b3c784f2bae9cc02a6cf20aa	I took a pension early two years ago.

WZGlLrWMaa	I am not a fire fighter, but there are quite a few that live in my neighborhood. So, from the way I see them live, they must make around 40 - 50K a year. With a wife who works, you should be able to live within the middle income bracket. As far as pros and cons are concerned, I can imagine that risking your life each day that you go to work would double as both a pro and con. But, as long as you love your job, it's well worth it.<br>  <br>  Community College is a great place to start. I believe that prospective firefighters should major in fire science, a course they offer at my local community college. To be honest, I don't even believe that you would need to take your education any further than community college to become a firefighter, but don't quote me on that. I would try asking any teachers you encounter in community college that teach fire science classes about firefighting. Generally, the teachers that teach certain field areas, such as fire science, have field experience.|`|904ae5dce32eb8e4afcdab5615aca68daa	firefighting is well... not a good choice low pay, crappy hours, physically tiring<br>  <br>  the only pro would be respect, but it depends on if youd value respect over the overall aspect of the quality of life|`|GESeS0pBaa	I don't understand why people who are not firefighters are answering these questions.<br>  <br>  Firefighting is the best job in the world. Most career departments start in the 45 to 50 k salary range and with a BS in Fire Science you can expect to attain Captains rank or even a Chief level position in your 20 years. I work in the Northeast, we get some on the best pay, but there are departments that are better in CA. A Capt in the northeast can make 70k before overtime and can attain up to 100k with it. You want to study fire science, check with your college on other schools available to you.<br>  <br>  The benefits are good and a pension after 20 or 25 years is very good. Now before you think its for free, just remember, not everyone gets to go home. The USA lost 140 Firefighters in the line of duty last year and thousands were injured, some permanently. <br>  <br>  Pro<br>  Great job satisfaction, helping people who are in real need feels great. Good pay, respect from all. Great retirement<br>  <br>  Cons<br>  Long term injuries, some just sneak up on you, you find that maybe your knees just don't want to climb ladders anymore. Cancer, there's alot of cancers due to the smoke and diesel soot. Heart attacks, we lose a lot of guys to heart attacks. The job is incredibly hard when working a fire. Many departments are short handed and you just have to keep pushing. You have to stay in shape. Marital problems, many families can't take the overnite, weekend and holiday work schedule. <br>  <br>  This work isn't for everyone. You have to be ready to run into a building that everyone else is running out of, If you have the courage and personal strength in all aspects to push thru the hardships and meet the challenges, it is still the best job in the world.

That is how they are getting rich.  Not by buying tax foreclosed homes.  <br>  <br>  Has it been done? Sure, I am sure somewhere someone bought a house for $580...but that is a rare example.  <br>  <br>  If you order any of these guys courses, you will then get calls to up your membership to some one on one mentoring that is in the thousands of dollars...<br>  <br>  Trust me, this is not about buying tax sale homes...it's about selling stuff to people who have no experience in real estate.  Therefore, they are more likely to be naive and only be looking at the money or house they could buy or make, not the reality of the situation.

ug00j0S8aa	Your federally tax exempt interest is interest that the federal government doesn't tax, like municipal bonds.  If you are a dependent of someone else your Illinois tax on $3224 is $97.  If you had interest income of about $290 that was included in your federal adjusted gross income, and then erroneously entered that as federal tax-exempt on your Illinois return, that would raise your Illinois tax to $105.|`|SqzoZe4Laa	Here's how I handle Illinois: I live there every other year, and here's what I do with them. because they are unpredictable (every OTHER year I spend in Oregon). In Illinois, the best way to insure that you taxes are paid up is to OPT to have an additional $20 taken out of EVERY CHECK. That way, they are getting an additional $20 out of every check you take home . I learned this YEARS AND YEARS AGO with Illinois. I'm pretty sure they are stupid in Springfield. It's the only way to make sure that your taxes will be paid and that also, you MIGHT EVEN SEE A RETURN. (This year was my Oregon year so can't give you info, but nexy year (as in 2009) will be my Illinois year, so we'll see what happens. That's just the best advice I can give you. -john in Rock Island, Illinois                  OH, ALSO, ONE OTHER THING, DON'T EVER EVER GO TO AMERIFILE OR H&R BLOCK OR ANY OF THOSE PLACES.

NwkZ5OmCaa	The current tax system encourages couples to live together even when they are having children.  The system allows couples to file as HOH/single and still collect EIC--even though if they were married, they would make too much money to qualify.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	There are two ways that taxes could reduce the marriage rate:<br>  1. The sales taxes, excise taxes, etc., on various things purchased for a wedding, such as catering, gas, hotel rooms, airplane tickets, etc., make it more expensive (after taxes) to get married.<br>  2. In certain cases, a couple may calculate (often incorrectly) that their income tax will be greater if they marry.  They might elect not to marry in order to save on income tax.<br>  <br>  Government never intentionally imposes a tax for the purpose of reducing the marriage rate.  Taxes that have this effect are imposed for other reasons.  If this effect does occur, that is an accident.<br>  <br>  The main incentive for government to impose a tax that reduces the marriage rate is the cost to government of children.  Married persons have more children, whom the government must provide with schools and various other services, even though those children pay little or no taxes of their own.  Reducing the marriage rate reduces the number of children born, and therefore saves the government money.<br>  <br>  Another incentive is reducing the workload of judges and the cost of overtime for court officers, etc.  By reducing the rate of marriage, the number of divorce cases is also reduced.<br>  <br>  Government does not actually try to reduce the marriage rate for either of these reasons.|`|SqzoZe4Laa	The only way taxes could reduce the rate of marriage is if the federal government dropped or reduced the tax benefits for BEING MARRIED. In that case, people would reconsider, and, in alot of cases, NOT get married because the tax benefit would not benefit them as much. How COULD THIS NOT BE OBVIOUS TO YOU? -john in iowa

d2ae6085cefba5ad885e5915f9b8ccc7aa	Most people use one account so you would state that 100% of your money should be deposited into that account.<br>  <br>  If you are not most people you can state that you want 90% to your checking and 10% to your savings.

Say  you can do it. " I can get an A in Chemistry" If you think that way, then your brain use more power to focus on that subject. If you think you may do it then your brain use less power. Or think that I'm dumb. I can't do this at all, then it can be worst. Think positive when you study.<br>  <br>  2. Time is important in education. You need to make a schedule when to study. No Pain, No Gain!<br>  <br>  3. You need to balance your left brain and right brain. Here are the list of the thing you do affect left brain and right brain. LEFT: Study math,language, to analyze, try to reason out the outcome. RIGHT: Music, Imagination, to be romantic or love, color. If you study math all day, your left brain will be tire very fast! <br>  <br>  It's good to have faith so you don't do bad things that affect your education. Have a good health is important too. Try to sleep 6 hours or 8 hours a day. GOOD LUCK!<br>  <br>  I'm not good at English, sorry about my grammar.

KXEm7lGLaa	You should have your home insured as a rental dwelling.  When doing this insurance- speak to the agent and advise of the golf cart.  Ask them to put it on the policy- covering it for physical damage & liability when in use by a renter.   <br>  <br>  That way you have coverage for the golf cart and the liability that goes along with it.  Insuring the home as a rental dwelling automatically covers the liability for you as the owner. <br>  <br>  It's absurd to ask a renter to insure your property.  They have no insurable interest in it- as they do not own it.   <br>  <br>  Please also note that if the renters have a homeowners policy of their own for their home- the liability from that quite likely would pay for anything that went on in a rented vacation home.|`|d6959f140445530c8d381f41dd69fcecaa	Do they have a homeowner policy on THEIR home?

It will be best if you at least have a prepaid card because the only other way a company can send you your check is by mail so they could find out, you can have paychecks direct deposited to your ppd card. good luck!|`|c178xF24aa	Start a blog about your passion using <a href="http://www.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.wordpress.com</a><br>  <br>  Write something every day.<br>  <br>  Set a google alert about your passion and you will find other blogs about same passion, read and comment on these blogs.<br>  <br>  After 30 days of doing this, open free account with google adsense and put adsense ads on your blog.<br>  <br>  Mark<br>  <a href="http://budurl.com/answer" rel="nofollow">http://budurl.com/answer</a>|`|miZD0VGaaa	You can become a registered nurse. <br>  Not only is this a good and a quick way to make money, it is a great career considering the salary and the fact that it's in demand. <br>  <br>  You can become certified with an associate degree in your nearest community college and start making more than $50k every year. <br>  <br>  This may be something you want to consider.

As an American it is your right to choose any name for your infant.|`|S15ffaE8aa	Yes|`|6XGYzWYbaa	who would name their kid anonymous that's just cruel|`|XLHrIFA4aa	I would assume so. Do you really want your kid to be "anonymous" for the rest of his life? There was a couple in the New England area that named there kid "Adolf" and his middle name was "Hitler"... so I guess anything goes.|`|g7XmorbCaa	Why on Earth would you do that? The word isn't even a pretty word. But Whatever~~~~
Ch9TedMcaa	Well, some plans come with hardship components allowing one to withdraw money without penalty. I'm still not sure how the stimulus will affect 401 (k) withdrawals, but the normal penalty is 10% plus federal income tax.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Your gross withdrawal is taxable income, so that may move you into a higher tax bracket.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	You might have trouble with your HR department if you try to take the money out in full.<br>  It has to be a hardship situation, like medical, or lawsuits that your HR has to approve.<br>  <br>  Have you considered making a loan from your 401K?<br>  This is much easier, and you will be paying yourself back the interest.<br>  /

Be sure to tell them a starting date.  That way they can schedule someone else.

If you used all of the distribution for medical expenses you will not pay tax on it.<br>  <br>  You can receive tax-free distributions from your HSA to pay or be reimbursed for qualified medical expenses you incur after you establish the HSA. If you receive distributions for other reasons, the amount you withdraw will be subject to income tax and may be subject to an additional 10% tax. You do not have to make distributions from your HSA each year.<br>   Qualified medical expenses are those incurred by the following persons. <br>  You and your spouse.<br>  <br>  All dependents you claim on your tax return.<br>  <br>  Any person you could have claimed as a dependent on your return except that:<br>  <br>  The person filed a joint return,<br>  <br>  The person had gross income of $3,500 or more, or<br>  <br>  You, or your spouse if filing jointly, could be claimed as a dependent on someone else's 2008 return<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Christine EA Master Tax Advisor<br>  <br>  This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hrblock.com/tax_professionals/christine_wilkins.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hrblock.com/tax_professionals...</a>
MMeHdlu2aa	Most leases provide the landlord with the ability to show the property to prospective tenants with adequate notice. Read your lease to determine what rights the landlord has regarding showing the property and what notice is required.  <br>  This provision is so the property can be rented to new tenants by the time you move out. Otherwise, if the landlord could just start showing the property after you vacate, there would always be a gap in rental income for the landlord.|`|AA11215123	Most leases specifically allow this.|`|PxoKseAiaa	Re read your lease, but my guess is that in tiny print on page 6 or so, it says that they can show the place.|`|d07683f385c8c5d34bcf9ca4a532395faa	Yes they only need to give you 24 hours notice that they will be entering.|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	Yes
M2AiWt85aa	I bought the SMC package.  It is a great deal - if you will actually go out and sell it...  I ended up buying items in there as gifts and stuff for me.  You get some AWESOME prices!  In fact, I hated letting my annual subscription go.<br>  <br>  They send you a booklet with different ways to sell the merchandise.  It makes a lot of sense.  The only thing I can think of is that it might be hard to sell some of their things in this economy.<br>  <br>  One thing you could try...<br>  <br>  Decide you are going to have "Survive in 09" home parties.  Have items that will save people money in the long run - car emergency kits, at home tool boxes, etc.  A creative way to ADD to this would be to include a "how to" book with each purchase for an additional $10 or so.  You don't have to write it.  Find somebody to write it (search for how to websites and propose deal to owner, or go to freelance.com) and share the profits with them.<br>  <br>  So, yes, SMC has great products.  They WILL sell if you get out there and do it (be prepared to sell items discounted right now).  <br>  <br>  The key is going to be finding a creative way to get people's money.
