Getting ready to add a level to our Central NJ home and having trouble getting a handle on my HVAC needs.  Went to a home show this weekend, and no two answers were the same.  We have a 1300 sqft ranch, with 800 sqft finished basement.  We are adding 1000 sqft of bedrooms and baths on top.  I'm looking to make sure things are tight, efficient and green as much as I can, but heard everything from dual units, to two stage high efficiency, etc.  I'd really like to replace the 75000 btu 80% Ruud furnace with a single unit to heat the zones separately.  I did this once before with my last house in Akron, OH and was really pleased with the results.  Thoughts are appreciated, but proper formulas for size and such would be awesome.  Thanks so much.

But I had just cleaned it on Saturday. I never eat in my bedroom. Actually, I think I once ate a plain cracker in here, but I ate the whole thing. Anyways, I checked my laundry hamper, which is almost empty- no bad smell( the clothes all smell like vanilla, which is my body spray) I checked all of my suitcases and bags, most of which are empty. I checked my armour drawers, nothing(once again, vanilla, no matter how many times I wash my clothes they smell like me) And I took my book bag to school today, it didn't smell.  But the odor has just gotten worse since yesterday. I followed it to where it is strongest, which is just a place right by my window. There's nothing there. And I just vacuumed.  Currently, I have just used half a bottle of air freshener and opened the windows. I even had my mom anD sister, who are major clean freaks, come in and they could not find the source of the smell. It REEKS! How do I get rid of it? Oh, we just moved in about 2 and a half weeks ago.

I'm planting some wild plums (prunus americana) this year, mostly because I live in a cold climate and like fruit trees but don't have experience growing them.  Wild plums are supposed to be very hardy and very easy to grow.     My question is, are they actually good to eat out of hand?  Or are they sour and bitter?  How does the fruit compare to the average (under-ripe, stale) plum you buy in the supermarket? Do they even come close to a tree ripened Santa Rosa plum which drips honey-sweet nectar down your arm and is perfumed and complex and tender?        Would I be better off planting a hardy plum cultivar, or are they significantly harder to care for?      Or should I just scrap the whole idea and stick to raspberries?
