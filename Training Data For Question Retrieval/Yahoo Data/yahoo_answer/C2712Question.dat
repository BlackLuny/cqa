20090307173540AAiYJUC	Pets;Fish	I have a couple of guppy fry questions...?	My guppy just had five babies last night. Knowing that the mother and father and other fish in the tank would eat them, i removed them gently and put them in a fish bowl with no filter. I can't go to the store for about a week, so i have some questions. If you could answer all of them on bullet form, that would be great. If you can pnly answer oneor two, that is ok. Here they are-       - what should i feed them? The flakes i feed the big ones are too big.   - is it normal that they stay still and sit at the bottom of the tank?      I had another question but i can't seem to name it... Thanks if you can answer these (check my other ones to see if you can answer them) thanks again!

20090307173547AAaJgha	Pets;Rodents	My hamster is balding on his head, between his ears and moving forward. What is wrong?	My Hamster Bazal is a 1.5 years old beige Syrian Hamster.      I just noticed the balding on Friday night and now tonight (Saturday night) it is slightly worst.      The balding started between his ears and has moved forward along his forehead.  I looked him over carefully and besides his head he is not balding anywhere else.      His skin does not appear to be irritated.  The is no redness, flakes or hot spots.  He also has no bumps of dark spots anywhere on him. His ears, nose, eyes, and butt are as they should be clean and clear.      He has been eating normally, but appears to be a bit more tired then usual.      I have not changed his bedding or food in the past 3 months.  He has carefresh bedding.   We were visiting someone else for a month and he has been back at my place since Tuesday, he has not shown any signs of stress during the visit or upon returning.      So why would he go from having all his fur to a complete bald spot and thinning over night?

Just recently I have noticed birds chirping literally at any time of the night, they seem to chirp more at night than they do in the morning. It is currently 1.35am and I can hear multiple birds chirping and they have been for at least the last 20 minutes.       They chirp frequently between 1am and 4am and it seems to have only been recently that they've started, within the last 3 months. And I've lived in this house for the last 18 years.      I live in West-Greater London in a small town.       Any theories or ideas welcome ^_^

I've made all my flyers, business cards, signs and my calendar but i don't think i really want to apply for a license. do i really need one to call myself a "dog trainer" is it illegal in virginia. not only do i not want to take the time to get one but i also don't think i am the right age. im ONLY 14. I have always loved animals. i do LOTS of community service every week with the Lost Dog and Cat Rescue Foundation to help rescued animal get adopted. I was inspired by Victoria Stillwell and her show "Its Me or The Dog" as well as by Cesar Millan and his show "Dog Whisperer" i have all the books written by both of these people and have numerous books on dog psychology.Can i call my thing a Business without having a permit? I really don't want to interfere with the LAW! thanks for all your help! ?

20090307183458AA9JwOI	Pets;Cats	My cat was attacked by two dogs?	My cat was attacked by two dogs earlier today, and her jaw is broken. She is in an animal hospital right now. But the cost is outrageous. It could end up being over 1300 dollars. We didn't see her get attacked, but my mom and my neighbor saw the dogs that did it. If we find out who the dogs belong to, could we make the owners of the dogs pay? i think it's only fair that they do, since their dogs caused this. we don't have the money to pay for the bill, so my mother will have to end up borrowing money from her sister to pay the bill.

I have heard however that Iams isn't as good as I thought it was that it has corn as a filler and by products. I guess I should have read the label! Anyways the local pet shop had a sales person from Blue Buffalo with a display and stuff. It seems natural and good but if you've used it did you have good results and did your cat seem to like it?

20090307183738AAXWHgN	Pets;Cats	Authority brand cat food?	In my never-ending quest to find economical ways to feed my 8 cats (one of whom has CRF) high quality food, I ran across Authority.  The price is right and it's grain/by-product free but every flavor has fish listed in the ingredients except the chicken flavor which has liver which isn't good for the CRF either.  I need a little input from the premium food buffs as to what you think about this food.  Here is the ingredients list.    http://resources.petsmart.com/products/2...    I'm feeding Wellness and everybody is doing well with it so I probably won't switch but I was just wondering what others think about this food?
20090307182214AAoQOqH	Pets;Dogs	I think my lab is depressed.  What helps?	My Yellow Lab Kelly is a very sweet dog.  She is very loving and loyal.  She is very connected to me and struggles when I am gone for the day.  She scratches the carpet, shakes and pees and poops sometimes.  She has had two owners before our family adopted her.  The first owner was physically and verbally abusive to her.  She is really sensitive and attaches to her owners easily.  A co-worker owned her before me and stated that she was very connected to her.  Indeed, when she first came to us she whined, shook and actually tried to go back to her home.     Anyway, I am worried about her.  She is 11 and just seems very despondent.  She does enjoy walks which we do everyday.  What should I do?
20090227094646AAigM4Y	Pets;Dogs	What can I do about my overprotective dog?	I've only tried to have one person over to my apartment so far.  I wasn't able to let go of the leash b/c he would have bitten my friend.  I put him in a cage and he still wouldn't stop growling/barking.  Thing is, he was fine outside w/ my friend just before.  I'm thinking it was because my friend was coming inside "his" territory.        I haven't had any other ppl over yet b/c, well, I don't have too many friends and no one in my family lives near me.  I'm SO afraid of having anyone over b/c I don't want to have to lock him up in his crate.  (Btw, I don't use the crate as punishment.  I know better than that)  I want my dog to be okay w/ ppl coming over (as long as they're not strangers)...        I really need help w/ this.  I was SO afraid for my friend when my dog was trying to lunge at him.  I knew if I let go of the leash my friend would get bitten. :-(      What can I do?  I don't have the option of having many diff people over b/c I'm very shy and have very few friends.  I do know that would help.       What can I do about my friend coming over again?  What can I do to make my dog be okay w/ my friend being there?  I want them to have a nice relationship. :-(
20090307184551AAaVR4X	Pets;Cats	Why did my cat like the smell of my hands so much after I rode my bike?	I was riding my bike for a little bit, and that smell of the handlebars, whatever it is, was on my hands, along with some black marks. Then when I was petting my cat, she smelled my hands and seemed to LOVE it, like she was rubbing against them a lot, trying to nip at them, and acting crazy, when she doesn't usually act like that? What is it about that smell that she liked so much, and is this normal for a lot of cats?

20090307184209AAkCN8S	Pets;Dogs	My dog is scared: help?	Well, this has been happening for a while now, ever since he was 2/3 yrs old he's been scared of the bottom of the sink. We(my family) just thought it was b/c it was a small space and it was dark, so it wasn't a big deal. Well, when ever we open the sink, he backs away. Now, i'm gettin creeped out b/c he randomly stands in the kitchen doorway and just stares at the bottom of the sink, with his ears alert. It makes me worried for him, could he really be seeing things down there(ghosts, spirits), my mom always tells me that, and she's serious about it. So, it doesn't make things better when she tells me that.

20090227093738AASBdaT	Pets;Cats	Why does my cat have to pull the food out of her bowl?	My two older cats (16 & 17) are always pulling thier food out of thier bowls. They will only eat one kind, it's called "Blended Formula" But they pull huge portions out of thier bowl, and then won't eat it. Its not that they pull out the pieces they don't like, its all the pieces. They used to make a huge mess on my floor, because i have a large feeder, because i have several cats that come and go through my room, and i also have a water feeder, because my one cat always needs water because i suspect she has diabetes. I finnaly put the cardboard case from a 24 pack of water underneath to catch the food, but they still spill it to the point where it fills up the corner of the box, and sometimes spills over. I have tried scooping it up, and putting it back into the bowl, but they just scoop it back out again. So why do they do this, and how do i stop them? Thanks.       P.S. Almost every animal question i ask ends up with at least one "kill your pet" answer. Post this, and i will report you. Thanks!

I really don't want a speal about needing a bigger tank because they are going to get one but I will have to wait for at least another week.

But I need help, because I just bought a new horse and I am going to ride him for my Pony Club cross country riding in March. He is a Shire/warmblood cross, he weighs around 1500 pounds (?) and he is 16.3hh so he's pretty big. I would think I need to look at wide gullet saddles. I would talk to my local tack shop guy (he knows soo much!) but local is actually like an hour away and I'm all tied up right now! So I need your help! Do you think a wide would fit him or do I need the draft size saddles?   Thanks so much!   xoxo jammi

Hi, I took my rabbit to the vet to be castrated and so they did a pre-op check in order to see if he was healthy and he was, and so they gave him the all clear for the operation to take place. So, I made an appointment and took him in and they did a second pre- op check to make sure he was healthy at the time, which he was. Apparently, his heart rate started slowing down when they gave him the anaesthetic and he died shortly after. I am really sad :(. I had read up everything in order to make sure that what i was doing was right. Is it common for a rabbit to die under anaesthetic?

Her head was buried in my arm so I thought maybe she was having trouble breathing or something. But I looked and saw that she was sucking on her thumb!

20090307190224AANoki7	Pets;Dogs	Lost dog protocol? Was this handled correctly?	I apologize for the length of this in advance....      When my aunt's Jack Russell Terrier, Dozer bolted out the door a couple weeks ago and didn't come home, my aunt immediately sent out a search party and called the local law enforcement. I went right to work calling around town and putting up lost dog posters. The real tickers were that he was due that very same week for a rabies update, and the day before the door-bolting his collar broke. So he was out about the town...shots expired..and no collar. She ended up cancelling the vet's appointment when he didn't turn up the following day.      The morning after he went missing she notified the police office and was told that no Jack Russell had been picked up. So her boyfriend, me, her sister, and a slew of friends canvassed the entire town looking for him. I put up many posters and several people claimed to have seen him THAT day.       I went into the police station and asked to put a poster up and the lady at the desk got all excited and said that they had found him and immediately put me into contact with the chief of police who said he was fine and they had him taken to a Humane Society an hour away. First of all the police are required to keep a stray dog OVERNIGHT and there is no way they did that because they never even notified my aunt he was found! Plus there were several eyewitnesses who saw him running around in a neighborhood close to where he lives that morning. So sometime between 8 A.M. and 5 P.M. he was taken to the Humane Society.      So my aunt immediately called the Humane Society...3 times..and left urgent voicemails about how concerned she was about him, asking if he was ok..she got a return call the next day from the coordinator saying they would hold him 5 days then he was going to be placed up for ADOPTION!! I was a bit livid about that because this dog's owner had done EVERYTHING possible to find her dog...found him, claimed him and still got threats to have HER dog adopted out.      When she went to get him they made her pay $80 to get him out, wouldn't even let her go back to get him (and he was flipping out in the back room barking, screaming, yelping as soon as he heard her voice). THEN they made her sign a paper saying that if she didn't get the rabies vaccine in 10 days, they were going to re-claim the dog and EUTHANIZE him! Yes EUTHANIZE...I read the papers. I couldn't believe they would do such a thing..the entire time they were extremely rude to my aunt who had literally been beside herself with stress...as soon as she got him he had a new collar and his shot was updated.      Again sorry for the length..but in your opinion...was this handled correctly?

A friend got me Noromectin from a feed store to give them, it was reccommended by them and I have been told by many people they have been using it for years with their dogs. I already know it is not made for dogs and not to use it in herding breeds. I am wanting to know if you have used it? Are you pleased with it? Did you administer it orally or by injection? And how did you calculate how much to give? Everything will be run by a vet first, but I would like more info and to get an idea of what others are using. Thanks!
20090307194815AAdlT98	Pets;Dogs	What to do about dog growling/biting?	I have a 10 month old Pomeranian Puppy. When he has something, and I go to take it from him, he growls and snaps at me. I say no, and clap my hands and make a VERY large noise. He has actually bit me a few times. What do I do??? I am very scared he is going to clamp down on me and hurt me bad.      What do I do??      When he has the item, and I'm trying to remove the item(which is hard because he clamps down on it, and runs under furniture) he growling at me the whole time. When I finally get it out, he tries to bite me! If I do get him to come out from under the furniture,  I will clap my hands, and in a loud voice, i say "SIT" and he usually sits. If he sits he usually drops what he has in his mouth. If he doesn't come out, I pry it from his mouth.      Is this the right way?   Thanks!

20090307190228AAIVS8Z	Pets;Dogs	LLD "little dog disease" ?	A couple days ago, when walking home from a friends house I was accosted by our other neighbors dachshund. I was at the bottumn of my friends driveway, where our neighbor was getting her mail from her mailbox. The dog ran to me and was yapping like the dickens and grabbed onto my jeans and kept nipping me. Then he grabbed onto my jeans and I couldn't "shake him off". I called to the owner, who totally wasn't watching her dog attack me, even though she could obviously hear it. She yanked it away and it continued to strain against the collar and growl and yap at me, as I walked away and she dragged it into the house.      To me it seems, the little dogs get away with SOOOOOO much, simply because of their size.      I have been attacked by six dogs in my life:   -a pair of jack russel terriers attacked my dog and I multiple times. Eventually I had to kick one of them, because it had my dog by the throat (he's a sheltie so the little rats teeth never got through the fur to the skin, but still....). After atleast four attacks on me and my dog and an attack on another neighbor and her dog, they eventually got an electric fence.      -two cairn terriers. Another neighbor used to have two cairn terriers (one died of old age, another ran away and got hit by a truck). On a walk they attacked my dog and I until the owners returned home from errands and saw their dogs attacking my dog and me in the street infront of their house.      -one dachshund, above story and other attacks      -one cardigan welsh corgi, my neighbors grandmother had a cardigan welsh corgi and brought it with her when she visited. she made me and my friend walk it, so I decided to bring my dog to. It went f***ing crazy on my dog until I got my dog away!      ~in none of these attacks was my dog or I badly physically hurt. I got a nasty gash from tripping over one of the little rat things (jack russels) and ripped my jeans being attacked by the corgi.      I have never been attacked by a dog taller than knee high, I have been attacked six times by little dogs. I believe that little dogs are getting away with SOOOOO much more than big dogs ust becasue of their size. Had any of those six dogs been large breeds, even if I hadn't been injured, they probably still would have gotten in a lot of trouble, or been put down.      Little dog owners it seems do not train their dogs as much, (or as well) simply because of size! UGH! this kills me, because I LOVE big dogs and plan to have a pit bull(riff-raff), doberman pinscher(misu) and standard poodle(Clancy). People are much more wary of big dogs, when in my opinion, little dogs are MUCH more likely to bite!      Heck most of the little dogs I know haven't been trained to lie down on command, leave it, or come, but atleast 50% can "dance, come on dance!"      Does this ever bother you?         Oh, ust to put it out there, I recognize that not all small dogs, and small dog owners are this way, I know some nice conscientious ones to, but it does seem that most are!      real question: have you ever been attacked by a small dog?

Why does she do this? she also used to growl at my step dad but then she got used to him. She does not growl at my husband, my brother, or my father in law- the men she is used to. She only growls at men she is unfamilar with. NOT woman.

I should also mention I live in an apt. and space is VERY limited, so any other suggestions would be helpful also.

20090307190820AA7FiCp	Pets;Dogs	My shih tzu has been chewing ANYTHING she can get ahold of lately, and she's NEVER EVER done this before, why?	I adopted her in June.   She has NEVER EVER EVER had this issue, she's never chewed our stuff.   She had plenty of toys, food, water, playmates, exercise etc.   She did have an ear infection last month but that's cleared up and she is a little overweight so I've actually been giving her MORE exercise (2/30min walks a day and 1 trip to the dog park).      The only thing I can think of that changed is that she's no longer allowed to have rawhide chews (vet says she has a beef allergy), but she still has a nylabone and even still she has gone periods without having the rawhide chews anyhow and never did this.      She has chewed my boyfriends phone charger when we weren't looking and tonight I came home and some of my makeup brushes fell off the shelf and she had chomped them to death too... I don't get it... what's up with her?

I have some info that i will list after I list the questions. Here they are-      - I have gotten some advice to use a small amount of pebbles, but i have already set up my tank and put the fry into it. How should I remove the fry so that it will not shock it very much and it will be healthy for it?   -the filter that came with the tank I just bought for my fry has a stone at the bottom and air pumps through a tube and comes out of the rock, making bubbles. I thought this would be good while the fry are very small because it wouldn't suck them up, but I am afraid it will not keep the tank very clean and filtered. Any suggestions?    - I did not know that my guppy was pregnant (I know, call me dumb) so I did not buy a breeders net. I had to go on a rescue mission to get them out of the tank with the big fish. I used a net and i am afraid I shocked them. They stay close to the bottom and don't move very much. I am afraid that I hurt them, but it might just be because they are young. Please help!         Here is some info-   I just found them in my tank when I got home last night (the guppy probably had them while I was out). They are very small (obviously) and there are five of them. I don't know exactly how many the big fish ate. Please help me! I want to be successful at keeping these babies alive. Please read my other questions and help me with them. I know I wrote a lot in this question, but I want you to know about my situation. Thank you!

I think she had her wings clipped, but this 1 website said that if you clip a parakeets wings, the parakeet will molt, then the parakeet will have new flight wings/ feathers in like a few weeks or months, I've actually let go outside a few times, not a single flap of her wings was made. Could it be because she doesn't know how to fly? Or could she have been damaged, give me possiblities and ecpecially answers, and she's blue, black, and white. THANKS!

20090307190557AAqGHd8	Pets;Birds	Please help!!- extremely nervous... Is it a good idea?!?	We're going to be leaving our bird for three days next week. I'm so stressed over it. We're going to leave a ton of food for him and fill up his bowl of water. I feel that this is such an awful idea and I keep thinking that I'm gonna find my bird dead on the cage bottom when we get back.   He's not gonna have any socialization for those three days. Normally I play with him so much that he has no need for a mate. He is a single lovebird.   My parents don't want the neighbors checking up on him or anything. Is this even a good idea? What are the chances that my bird dies? And what things could I convince my mom to do? (example: Letting the neighbor check up on him)      Thank you so much.
20090307190735AA1zwKj	Pets;Dogs	My dog won't stop barking.?	My pug Bungis, who is 7 years old, WILL NOT STOP BARKING!!!  She wake from a completely sound sleep and just jump up and start barking.  And she won't stop until I actually get up, chase her around the house, and touch her.  Sometimes I think she's deaf, but I think its just stubbornness(that is, she listens to me when she wants to) b/c sometimes I say something and she will respond.  But this barking is really getting to me...its been happening since maybe January.  What can I do to make her stop???  Please help.

I noticed that my pet rat had a bit of blood on his coat, and upon closer inspection he has a series of small bleeding puncture-type wounds along his neck, sides and forearms. There is no evidence that he might have scraped himself on anything in his cage, and he has had no contact with any other animals.    He does not seem to be in pain and is eating/drinking normally. His disposition is normal.   What should I do about this and how much might a vet visit cost for a rat?

20090307191827AAZEQuX	Pets;Fish	What type of fish do you think this is?	I went to the store and got a few more fish to add to my tanks now that they are balanced and doing well.  I looked at the tanks for like 45 minutes trying to make a decision and then I saw IT!  This itty bitty little fish in a sea of dwarf gouramis.  So I asked what it was and they said they did not have a clue.  I have this thiing for picking animals and fish that no one else will take, so I brought it home, and I just love it.  It is a very active fish.  They said it had been in the tank for months and had not grown at all.  It is very small silvery fish with some slight orange and green markings with a short swordtail on the bottom.  It has a large black spot on each side of its body.  hought I would try here and see if I could get any thoughts as to what it might be.  I have posted 4 different pictures at this link...  http://s373.photobucket.com/albums/oo172...       Thanks!

The lady told me that if I got a container like  a platic one she would be fine and she is because we drilled a hole in it for the water thing and she really seems to like it. Instead of the bedding, we use newspaper and clean it out twice a day and wash it down with windex vinegar. We have checked and it is fine. We feed her twice a day ( morning and night). She gets fresh fruit and veggies      My problem is she has recently been ripping the newpaper and  I can't tell if she is eating it or not. If she is, is that bad for her, cause if it really is then I could use bedding. Please give  resources.

I take this course on animals and today we made ecosystems in 2 liter soda bottles. It has gravel, a small snail, a plant, and a fish. The cap is on because the plant is supposed to provide it oxygen. Im not supposed to open it because the snail is supposed to clean it and i guess the fish is supposed to eat micro organisms or something. But we don't have to bring it back so i was wondering if it would be safer for the fish to switch it into a tank? And how do i get the fish out if i decide to do this considering the whole is really small.

20090307163129AAHjkKn	Pets;Horses	Equine Chiropractors? Opinions?	Within the last 2 months my 13 OTTB has become increasingly stiffer to his right side. It started off with just not bending as easily as he use to and has progressed to not bending at all. He will flex his neck to the left and right at the halt and walk but the second I ask for a big walk or any trot or canter he starts having issues. He won't stay bent for more than a couple steps. He still bends as well as he use to the left. We have started dressage lessons about 2 weeks before this started up and he is not pregressing nearly as well to the right as he is to the left even though I work to the right more often.       He did pull a nasty refusal that left me in a ditch a day or two before he started being stiff. I went off over his left shoulder.       My guess is that something has happened (the refusal/fall) that has messed up something that is causing him not to bend. I am almost positive it is pain related and not training because it came on so suddenly and he still goes very well to the left. I am seriously debating on getting a chiro out to check him out and reset him if something is out. In my state it is only legal for vets to do this but everyone I have talked to says the vets don't know how to do it. They recommend a human chiro that has very seriously studied equine anatomy and is very good.       So here are my questions:   Do you think the chiro could help Jazz (my horse)?   Do you think it is worth the risk of having a non certified person work on him with the recommendations I got?   What would you do in this situation?      Thanks!

I try to keep her tail clean and braided most of the time, but she ALWAYS manages to get it undone. She swats her tail relentlessly until its free of the braid (and bag too, when i use one).   She has an exceptionally dry mane and tail, and its always done better when conditioned and braided. So how can I keep it braided?      Thanks!      **Tried bands, string, yarn, etc.    **Tried different methods of securing the braid

20090307210850AASvcrk	Pets;Dogs	Interaction of dogs after major fight?	My dogs, Jake and Oliver, got into a major fight today. Usually, both of them will stop if I just yell and tell them too. They'll both back off and in a few minutes be licking each other's wounds, best buddies again. However, today was different. They paid no attention to my yelling (which I've read now that it encourages them :[ that makes me feel horrible) and even a few kicks and hits from my dad. Eventually, we pulled them apart by grabbing their back legs and pulling. (I know we handled it horribly, but we've never had to separate them before and I never thought they'd fight like that.) Afterwards, we took them to the vet and then to Petsmart to get ecollars (to keep Jake from licking a deep wound) and muzzles. Well, I thought that as usual, they'd be okay after a fight, even if it was that big, but Oliver, whenever he was near Jake, would growl a little bit. Jake showed no signs of aggression after the fight. (Jake is a REALLY protective dog. So I was surprised when it was Oliver showing aggression, not Jake)       Just a few notes:   Jake is around 7 years old and Oliver is about a year old.   They are both neutered.   Oliver frequently displays dominant behaviour towards Jake.   Every other fight has been over Oliver just annoying Jake and Jake      snapping at him a few times.      So my question is, how do I reintroduce them to each other? Of course, this will be after Jake's wounds have healed. (He's pretty weak right now and limps.) Is it okay to let them interact after they heal? Should I start with letting them just interact with muzzles on? I have no idea what to do.

20090307175656AA4EM4V	Pets;Horses	Change of attitude? Trailering question.?	My horse has always been a dream to trailer, right up and right down. I've been trailering him once a week to lessons for about four months and he's always been fine. Last week he showed a bit of hesitation, but he was eventually stepped right up. That worried me a little. This week he refused to get on. It wasn't that big of an issue, it took about 20 minutes with help from a friend - but why all of a sudden the change? Plus his manners on the trailer have gotten much worse too. He stomps in the trailer all the time, I can't walk away with an incredibly loud bang coming from inside. But he won't stomp with me right in front of me. He takes advantage of when I'm not there. He doesn't stomp, paw, etc. at all when standing outside the trailer in the cross ties. What's causing this?      Note: we have gotten a new trailer because the older one was very unsafe, but essentially it's the same thing. Two horse straight load with a ramp. This is bigger, but could that make a difference?

She doesn't have vertical bars yet though, so should I wait untill she does to introduce her to the male? Or is should I just go for it and put them together?    thanks

The cut is EXTREMELY small, you can only see it when you look closely, it's not deep at all. Should I be concerned?
20090307165433AA7oU9t	Pets;Horses	Does Anyone Have Any Good Exercises For Me And My Horse?	My horse and I are going to our first show this year. It is a mini trial, so to those of you who don't know what that is, it is like a horse trial for kids. We are doing baby beginner novice although I jump beginner novice at home. Does anyone know of any good combination exercises for me and my horse? I mean one stride lines, in and outs, triples, etc. My horse has gotten the idea that he can stop after one jump so I need to teach him he can't. Ideas are welcome, websites would be awesome.

20090307165656AA21eOK	Pets;Dogs	Need puppy expert - house training?	We're trying to train our new Dachsund to potty outdoors in a specific area. We cordened off a small area and used small pepple rocks as a base. Problem is, the puppy tries to eat the rocks. Should we just leave the bare dirt or is there something else we can line the potty area with?

20090307175722AAu4kfQ	Pets;Fish	How do you clean the film off of a used 55 gallon tank? I have tried vinegar and stuff from petsmart.noresults?	This is everything it came with....I think I got a steal. She had it set up for saltwater and then converted it to freshwater. I have a ton of stuff that I don't know how to use! I haven't been successful in getting the python to work either. I can hook it to my spicket (outside) but not my sink but I can't hook the tubing to the sink/spicket attachment. It has a male end on attachment but It is to big and will not thread. Help with that would be great as well. I am getting discouraged. I tried to attach pics but it won't let me. You can look at it on craigslist under SC, then Upstate, the type in fishtank, it is the one that is for 200 and says clemson/anderson for location. The water is very murky looking and maybe that is what the film is. So I am guessing bacteria, fungal, or algae. Please help.....my husband says it is a waste of money and I should have bought a new lens for my camera. But I started this hobby with a 10 gal and I absolutely love it. It is very relaxing to lay on the couch and watch the fish.       Please only aquarium experts or ones with years of exoerience reply!!! I I know you cannot use soap products on tanks.                                                 The aquarium is in perfect condition. It comes fully equipped with stand included.
