Y Jose Ramon (que es un verdadero aficionado puma) comentaba que pumas ya estaba en la final contra chivas.   Mi comentario es el siguiente:   Atlante vs chivas, Atlante puede remontar ya que solo necesita un gol, aunque el DT de chivas asegura que va ir por el triunfo a cancun (algo que yo no creo, ya que contra San Luis defendio el resultado), Atlante ganara el partido alla en Cancun y pasara a la final.   Santos vs Pumas, Pumas ya es finalista, por que es el que mejor ha futbol mostrado de los cuatro equipos y el tuca jamas a perdido un juego por una diferencia de tres goles (yo no recuerdo).   Aunque no descarto una remontada de santos, pero lo veo muy dificil, pero los milagros existen.   Si la final chivas vs Pumas se da, me gustaria que fuera pumas el campion.   La pregunta es la siguiente  ?Pumas sera campeon?    nota:    Sean analistas y no se dejen llevar por la pasion a su equipo.

But I used a body fat calculator that said I have 20% body fat, and I'd like to decrease that by maybe 2 or 3% for now. It'd make running easier.   Second, my body is naturally boyish. I don't really have any curves, so are there any exercises I could do to make my waist smaller so that I appear to have curves?   Third, my sides (obliques, curve between ribcage and hips) are kind of fatty, so how can i get rid of the fat to make it lean muscle instead? Like just a silhouette, without all of the added fat.   Thank you so much! :)

20090309073114AAvYWj9	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	Is daniel agger being treated unfairly?	I'm a big fan of agger, think he's a great player. Begining of this season he sat out of the bench then skrtel go injuried against man city. Ageer came back in and did well, scored in the cup and was pretty soild. Then after christmas skrtel came straight back in. No waiting on the bench proving himself, just straight back in and agger had the door shut in his face again.      I heard all of th talk of him leaving and i say if he wants to go he should. He's done nothing wrong and it seems rafa has frozen him out. Stalled on agger's contract. He has the potential to be on of the best so i'd just like to see him fulfill it.       WHat are your thoughs on the way the are treating him ?

Its totally pointless the whole aim of the competition is to go to Wembley on a special day out and win the FA cup...not go to Wembley and play a team win...then go again!      I know it may be a nice day out for the Everton fans but they dont actually deserve to be there...same for all the other teams..EVEN Arsenal(if they beat Hull) dont actually deserve to play there at the moment...I personally feel the magic day(the final) has been taken away because teams are playing to get to Wembley not win the FA cup now...you think if Coventry beat Chelsea they wouldnt have felt their season was complete because they played at Wembley...      They should go vback to the method which they used during the construction of Wembley...playing games at Villa Park and Old Trafford and leave Wembley for the true winners...      OQ: Every team left in the FA has a strong desire to win it...Everton, Hull, Arsenal and Chelsea havent won enough recently and Man Utd want to win it all...so who wants it the most?

20090309134315AAQFiBb	Sports;Martial Arts	Kimbo Slice champion of our generation?	I would have to say kimbo slice tops the rankings of many as one of the greatest fighters of time. I think he has made his place amoungst notables like Bruce Lee, Muhhamad Ali, Yip Man, Chuck Norris,  Oscar De La Hoya, Chen Man Ching, Dan Inosanto and many other great fighters of this time period.       I mean I hear alot of people bad talk him because he "lost" that one fight. but people have to understand that he only lost in that fight because he was trying to help out the opponet by faking a defeat so that he could help him get more fights. He didnt loose because of his lack of skills but more so because of his compassion towards helping an inferior fighter.      It is proven that Kimbo Slice is the greatest fighter of all time he has been in thousands of street fights and has come victorious in all of them. There is even footage of some of his fights where he just destroys the competition in raw street battles.       If it hadnt been for Kimbo UFC would probably not be around anymore he peaked the UFC's popularity like no other fighter could ever do. Without Kimbo UFC wouldnt even be popular at all.      Kimbo Slice is an icon that I believe every martial artist and athlete models themselves after. We all strive to someday have the skillful abilities of Kimbo Slice.      He is truely an american legend who will continue to make his mark.

Or should I plead to be in the intermediate group?       I guess it's because of my age they wanted me with seniors, so I can wear the same costumes or whatever. Do you think senior will be fine?

Beth still went over and dragged her by the hair several feet and pinned her. Was Beth supposed to "stay in character" in that instance? Did she not risk Candice a further injury by doing that?

20090309141847AADAooU	Sports;Baseball	Embarrassing or brave?	What do you think about a player whose performance has diminished well below his best years, but he continues to play ball? Let's just say that an average year for Player A is .300 - 35 - 100. But due to age, his numbers slowly decline & his performance for the past 3 years average to this .255 - 15 - 60. He's a tough player who loves the game. He's gotten past injuries & is a crowd favorite. Everyone sees he's a shell of his former self & at times his declining performance is a bit rough to watch. Since he continues to play at the age of 39, would you say it's time for him to call it quits, or would you prefer he hang in there and play for a couple more seasons hoping he can return to form and go out on his own terms?

After researching right now I'm looking at:      SHAFTS:      Harrow 300i/advance    http://www.lax.com/shop/item.phtml?page=...     http://www.lax.com/shop/item.phtml?page=...

Same goes with stringing the head let me know if you have suggestions (and instructions/tutorial on how to do it). I want the best!!      p.s. My team colors are red/black/white so I'm trying to stay away from blue and green and stuff even though sticks are not that big of a deal. Thanks in advance everyone!!!

Also had a cross back so the traps didn't fall off.

20090309144015AAjBe4p	Sports;Baseball	Pittsburgh Pirates? encouraged?	hey i live in Pittsburgh and i hear alot about the pirates. I know this isn't going to be the "year" where they break .500 lol. But, i am encouraged about what they're doing. They signed Maholom and McLouth (2 best players) and have some talent in farm system. with McCuth and Walker and Alverez. my question is: are you encouraged by the way they're doing things now a days? I know under previous management they wouldve drafted the cheapest player but they went after (and got suprisingly) The big fish in the draft, so again, is anyone encouraged or just me?

20090309150955AAYmyef	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	Does supporting a different team than the rest of my family make me a glory hunter?	I already asked this question but didn't make myself clear...      I was born into a family of Liverpool fans in Ireland, where everyone supports a team in the English leagues. So it's not like I'm FROM Liverpool or anything. When I was 12 or 13 or something I decided I supported Arsenal, before then i had no interest in the Premiership or anything, I was just told that I was a Liverpool fan. Of course, I don't think I am a glory hunter 'cos if i was i'd just support Man U who won most Premiership titles, or Chelsea, who around that time were just bought by Roman Abramovich. I will, of course, stick by Arsenal through the good or the bad but some people have, as you'd expect, looked down upon my decision. Just wondering what you guys thought.
