20070806163421AALPjn8	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Você também acreditou que a Muralha da China era visível no espa?o?	A Grande Muralha da China é famosíssima pelo fato de ser a única obra humana que pode ser vista do espa?o a olho nu. Tudo isso foi por água abaixo quando em 2004, o primeiro astronauta chinês a ficar em órbita na Terra, Yang Liwei, declarou que a Muralha da China n?o era visível.    A NASA anunciou que o que eles achavam que fosse a constru??o, era na verdade, o tra?ado de um rio entre as montanhas. E reconheceu publica e oficialmente que a Grande Muralha da China n?o é visível do espa?o sem ajuda de aparelhos.    Aliás, n?o só a muralha chinesa, mas também muitas outras grandes obras, como as piramides do Egito ou até mesmo a hidrelétrica de Itaipu, podem ser vistas a olho nu do espa?o    dependendo de vários fatores como: as condi??es atmosféricas, a localiza??o do observador e de sua capacidade de interpretar as estruturas vistas da órbita terrestre.

Himno Nacional Argentino      CORO      Sean eternos los laureles   que supimos conseguir:   Coronados de gloria vivamos   O juremos con gloria morir.      Oíd ?mortales! el grito sagrado:   ?Libertad, libertad, libertad!   Oíd el ruido de rotas cadenas:   Ved en trono a la noble Igualdad.   Se levanta a la faz de la tierra   Una nueva y gloriosa Nación:   Coronada su sien de laureles   Y a su planta rendido un León      Coro, etc.. etc.      De los nuevos campeones los rostros   Marte mismo parece animar;   La grandeza se anida en sus pechos,   A su marcha todo hacen temblar.   Se conmueven del Inca las tumbas   Y en sus huesos revive el ardor,   Lo que ve renovado a sus hijos   De la Patria el antiguo esplendor.      Coro, etc.. etc.      Pero sierras y muros se sienten   Retumbar con horrible fragor:   Todo el país se conturba con gritos   de venganza, de guerra y furor.   En los fieros tiranos la envidia   Escupió su pestífera hiel   Su estandarte sangriento levantan   Provocando a la lid más cruel.      Coro, etc.. etc.      ?No los veis sobre Méjico y Quito   Arrojarse con sa?a tenaz.   Y cual lloran ba?ados en sangre   Potosí, Cochabamba y la Paz?   ?No los veis sobre el triste Caracas   Luto llanto y muerte esparcir?   ?No los veis devorando cual fieras   todo pueblo que logran rendir?      Coro, etc.. etc.      A vosotros se atreve ?Argentinos!   El orgullo del vil invasor,   Vuestros campos ya pisa contando   Tantas glorias hollar vencedor.   Mas los bravos que unidos juraron   Su feliz libertad sostener.   A esos tigres sedientos de sangre   Fuertes pechos sabrán oponer.      Coro, etc.. etc.      El valiente argentino a las armas   Corre ardiendo con brío y valor,   El clarín de la guerra cual trueno   En los campos del Sud resonó;   Buenos Aires se pone a la frente   De los pueblos de la ínclita Unión,   Y con brazos robustos desgarran   Al ibérico altivo León      Coro, etc.. etc.      San José, San Lorenzo, Suipacha,   Ambas Piedras, Salta y Tucumán,   La Colonia y las mismas murallas   Del tirano en la Banda Oriental;   Son letreros eternos que dicen:   Aquí el brazo argentino triunfó.   Aquí el fiero opresor de la patria   Su cerviz orgullosa dobló.      Coro, etc.. etc.      La victoria al guerrero argentino   Con sus alas brillantes cubrió,   Y azorado a su vista el tirano   Con infamia a la fuga se dio;   Sus banderas, sus armas se rinden   Por trofeos a la Libertad.   Y sobre alas de gloria alza el pueblo   Trono digno a su gran majestad.      Coro, etc.. etc.      Desde un polo hasta el otro resuena   De la fama el sonoro clarín.   Y de América el nombre ense?ado,   Les repite ?mortales! Oid:   ?Ya su trono dignísimo abrieron   las provincias unidas del Sud!   Y los libres del mundo responden:   ?Al Gran Pueblo Argentino, Salud!

O  Juiz deu uma bronca enorme e disse que cada um ia receber 20 chicotadas como puni??o.

Seu país é racista, capitalista e eu odeio vocês, mas promessa é promessa! Qual o seu desejo, desde que seja n?o escapar da puni??o?    - Quero que amarrem 1 travesseiro nas minhas costas!    - Que assim seja!    E tome as chicotadas com o travesseiro nas costas.

Eles sentam-se na primeira fila para que o menino possa apreciar bem a    missa.   Como é natural, meninos de oito anos n?o costumam gostar de igreja.    E ele adormece no meio do serm?o.   O padre nota isso, e decide dar-lhe um susto.   Ele faz uma pergunta direta para o menino:   - E você, meu menino, diga quem foi que criou o céu e a terra ?    A irm? do guri espeta um alfinete na bunda do menino que acorda de    sobressalto e grita:   - Meu Deus!   - Muito bem, meu filho - diz o padre.   Afinal, n?o esta errado... O pessoal que está por perto, olha para o    menino...   Mas daí a pouco o menino volta a dormir, e o padre vê que precisa    acordá-lo outra vez.   Ent?o ele pergunta:   - E me responda agora garoto, quem foi o filho de Maria e José?   A menina volta a enfiar um alfinete na bunda do menino, que acorda e    diz bem alto:   - Jesus!   O padre percebe o que aconteceu, mas n?o pode dizer nada.    O povo presta ainda mais aten??o no menino...   Mas logo depois o menino cochila novamente e o padre pergunta:   - O que disse Eva para Ad?o quando eles acordaram após a primeira noite    juntos?   Mas antes que a irm?zinha pudesse dar-lhe outra alfinetada, o menino    berra:   - SE VOCê ENFIAR ESSE NEGóCIO NA MINHA BUNDA DE NOVO EU TE ARREBENTO !

O vaqueiro estava no maior atraso sexual e já havia tomado umas boas biritas quando resolveu passar pela fazenda. Ele olhou para a ordenhadeira mecanica e teve uma idéia.    Ligou a máquina e introduziu seu pênis em um dos bicos.      - UAU! - gritou ele.- Como n?o havia pensado nisso antes! Q maravilha. é quase igual uma transa. Q  t.es?o.      A máquina fazia o servi?o como uma profissional do melhor gabarito. Sugava que era uma beleza.       E foi a primeira, e foi a segunda... E a máquina fazendo o servi?o.

(Sim, a dele era menor ainda, mas quis dizer era sobre a da máquina.) E veio o maior sufoco, pois como ele n?o alcan?ava para desligar, foi ficando desesperado. Aí que ele viu a plaquinha afixada na parede, bem próxima da ordenhadeira:   "DESLIGAMENTO AUTOMáTICO APóS COMPLETAR 5 LITROS"

Um metido a esperto pensou:   “Vou faturar uma grana deste médico!”.

20080425080930AAjH1rp	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Who knew 25 cents could ruin your day o.O?	A blonde decides to try horseback riding, even though she has had no lessons or prior experience. She mounts the horse unassisted and the horse immediately springs into motion. It gallops along at a steady and rhythmic pace, but the blonde begins to slip from the saddle.       In terror, she grabs for the horse's mane but cannot seem to get a firm grip. She tries to throw her arms around the horse's neck, but she slides down the side of the horse anyway.       The horse gallops along, seemingly impervious to its slipping rider. Finally, giving up her frail grip, she leaps away from the horse and tries to throw herself to safety. Unfortunately, her foot has become entangled in the stirrup and she is now at the mercy of the horse's pounding hooves as her head is struck against the ground again and again. As her head is battered against the ground, she is mere moments away from unconsciousness when suddenly the Wal-Mart manager runs out and pulls the plug

My guess is that the director quashed her attempt to sound genuinely Southern in order to sound Hollywood-Southern)   Dennis Quaid's "Cajun" accent in Big Easy      There are many others, I would appreciate your input.

20071213080006AAYuBee	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Impermanência?	A IMPERMANêNCIA é uma das li??es mais caras   e difíceis de aprendermos e que deveríamos   praticar todos os dias.   No filme de Bertolucci, "O pequeno Buda",   onde os monges constroem delicadas mandalas   com areia colorida e logo após a conclus?o   do belo trabalho, destroem tudo com as m?os, demonstrando na prática que nada é permanente.   No lado Ocidental, vemos Jesus caminhando   sem nenhum bem, sem nenhuma posse,ao ponto de   lembrar que o filho de Deus n?o tinha sequer   uma pedra onde deitar a cabe?a na hora de dormir,   em desapego total.   Quase todo o sofrimento humano decorre do apego   que mantemos pelas pessoas, objetos ou fatos que marcam a nossa vida.   Sabemos que tudo tem um fim, mas vivemos como   se tudo fosse durar a eternidade, por isso ainda   nos espantamos com a morte, nos deprimimos com frustra??es, sofremos com as trai??es, quase   morremos com os rompimentos de relacionamento.   N?o é fácil aceitar a IMPERMANêNCIA, nem   desapegar-se de coisas t?o queridas, mas como disse o mestre Dogen: "Ensinamento que n?o parece for?ar alguma coisa em você, n?o é verdadeiro ensinamento".   Pratique diariamente a IMPERMANêNCIA, refletindo   nas mudan?as que já ocorreram com você e   concentre-se na felicidade que é simples,   mais simples do que imaginamos.   Veja se você n?o está colocando seus sonhos em prateleiras altas, em tempos e lugares distantes demais.   A felicidade costuma estar sempre perto de nós,   nos lugares mais simples, ao alcance das m?os.   Por isso, ainda hoje escutamos pessoas arrependidas dizerem:"Eu era feliz e n?o sabia".

20071222042354AATWK0I	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Qual a melhor piada que vcs ouviram ultimamente? eu escolho essa ai?	Missa do novo padre　　　       O novo padre da Paróquia estava t?o nervoso no seu primeiro serm?o, que quase n?o conseguiu falar.   Antes do seu Segundo serm?o, no domingo seguinte, perguntou ao Arcebispo, como poderia fazer para relaxar.   Este lhe sugeriu que na próxima vez, colocasse umas gotas de vodka na água e que depois de uns goles estaria mais tranquilo.   No fomingo seguinte aplicou a sugest?o e sentiu-se t?o bem, que poderia falar alto até no meio de uma tempestade, de t?o feliz e descontraído que se encontrava.   Depois de regressar a Reitoria da Paróquia encontrou uma nota do   Arcebispo dizendo-lhe:   - Prezado Padre, seguem algumas observa??es:   1) Na próxima vez, coloque gotas de vodka na água e n?o gotas de água na vodka;   2) N?o coloque lim?o e a?úcar na borda do cálice;   3) O manto da imagem de Nosso Senhor Jesus Cristo n?o deve ser usado como guardanapo;   4) Existem 10 mandamentos e n?o 12;   5) Existem 12 Apóstolos, e n?o 10;   6) Judas traiu Jesus, n?o o “sacaneou”;   7) Jesus foi crusficado, n?o enforcado;   8) Tiradentes n?o tem nada a ver com a história;   9) A hóstia n?o é chicletes, portanto evite tentar fazer bolas;   10) Aquela “casinha” é o confessionário, n?o o banheiro;   11) Evite apoiar-se na imagem de Nossa Senhora, muito menos abra?á-la;   12) A iniciativa de chamar o público para cantar foi louvável, mas fazer trenzinho e corer pela igreja foi demais…   13) água benta é para se benzer e n?o para resfrescar a nuca;   14) Nunca reze a missa sentado na escada do altar, muito menos com o pé sobre a Biblia Sagrada;   15) As hóstias devem ser distribuidas para os fiéis; jamais usadas como aperitivo para acompanhar o vinho;   16) Procure usar roupas debaixo da batina;   17) Evite abanar-se com a batina quando estiver com calor;   18) Jesus nasceu em Belém, mas isto n?o significa que ele seja paraense;   19) Numa missa n?o se deve fazer perguntas ao público;   20) Também n?o se deve pedir ajuda aos universitários. Até porque eles n?o sabem nada;   21) Quem peca é um picador; n?o um “filho da pu.ta”;   22) Quem peca vai para o “Inferno”; e n?o “pra pu.ta que o pariu”.      Pelos 45 minutos de missa que acompanhei, notei essas falhas. Espero que tais falhas sejam corrigidas já para o próximo domingo.   Atenciosamente, …. Arcebispo.      PS.: Uma missa leva em torno de uma hora, e n?o dois tempos de 45 minutos cada. E aquele sujeito sentado no canto do altar, a quem você se referiu como “travec?o” de vestido, era eu.

20071024185132AA1btJz	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Otro chiste!!!?	Tecnología de punta       Un hombre se quejaba :    "Me duele mucho el hombro. Creo que deberia ver a un doctor".    Uno de sus amigos le dijo :    "no hagas eso!". "Hay una computadora en la farmacia que puede diagnosticar cualquier cosa mucho más rapido y más barato que un doctor. Simplemente tienes que poner una muestra de tu orina y la computadora te va a diagnosticar tu problema, y te va a sugerir que puedes hacer para solucionarlo. Ademas, solo cuesta $5 dolares."       El hombre penso que no tenia nada que perder, entonces lleno un frasco con orina y fue a la farmacia. Encontro la computadora y puso la muestra de orina dentro de un embudo que habia en la maquina. Luego deposito los $5 en la ranura.       La computadora comenzo a hacer ruidos, a encender y apagar varias luces, y luego de una peque?a pausa, por una ranura salio un papel que decia:    *** Ud. tiene hombro de tenista ***    *** Frote su brazo con agua caliente y sal ***    *** No haga esfuerzos fisicos de magnitud ***    *** En dos semanas va a estar mucho mejor ***       Mas tarde, mientras pensaba en lo maravillosa que era esta tecnologia y como cambiaria la ciencia medica para siempre, se le ocurrio si la computadora no podria ser engan?ada.       Decidio probar si lo podia hacer, mezclo agua del grifo, un poco de caca del perro y un poco de orina de su hija y su mujer. Para terminar, se masturbo y puso su semen en la mezcla, ademas de los $5.    Despues de los sonidos y luces de rigor, la maquina imprimio el siguiente analisis:    *** Su agua es demasiado impura. Comprese un purificador ***    *** Su perro tiene parasitos, Dele vitaminas ***    *** Su hija es drogadicta, Internela en un instituto de rehabilitacion ***    *** Su esposa esta embarazada , Y no es suyo, consiga un abogado.***    *** Y si no deja de hacerse la paja...***    *** NO SE LE VA A CURAR NUNCA EL HOMBRO!! ***

ESTA VEZ MI HERMANA TRATó DE MATAR A ESTE GUSANO INMORTAL SENTáNDOSELE ENCIMA. DESPUéS DE VARIOS MINUTOS DE LUCHA LOGRARON MATARLO... ESTA VEZ Sí ESTABA MUERTO, PORQUE EL NOVIO DE MI HERMANA LE ARRANCó EL PELLEJO Y LO ARROJó POR EL INODORO.    YO CREO QUE LOS GUSANOS TIENEN SIETE VIDAS COMO LOS GATOS Y ESTO DEL NOVIAZGO LA VERDAD SE ME HACE MUY PELIGROSO...    VOY A DECIRLE A PEPITO QUE NO.    
20080810102419AA7weXl	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Otra interesate reflexión	SíNDROME DE LOS VEINTITANTOS                         Le llaman la 'crisis del cuarto de vida'.  Te empiezas a dar cuenta que tu círculo de amigos es más peque?o que hace unos a?os.      Te das cuenta de que cada vez es más difícil ver a tus amigos y coordinar horarios por diferentes cuestiones: trabajo, estudios,pareja, etc...      Y cada vez disfrutas más de esa cervecita que sirve como excusa    para charlar un rato. Las multitudes ya no son 'tan divertidas'... hasta a veces te incomodan.        Y extra?as la comodidad de la escuela, de los grupos, de socializar con la   misma gente de forma constante.        Pero te empiezas a dar cuenta que   mientras algunos eran verdaderos amigos otros no eran tan especiales después de todo.        Te empiezas a dar cuenta de que algunas personas son egoístas y que, a lo mejor, esos amigos que creías cercanos no son exactamente las mejores personas que has conocido y que la gente con las que has perdido contacto   resultan ser amigos de los más   importantes para ti.        Ríes con más ganas, pero lloras con menos   lágrimas, y con más dolor. Te rompen el corazón y te preguntas como esa persona que amaste tanto te pudo hacer tanto mal.        O quizás te acuestes por las noches y te preguntes por qué no puedes conocer a alguien lo suficientemente interesante como para   querer conocerlo mejor.        Pareciera como si todos los que conoces ya   llevan a?os de novios y algunos empiezan a casarse. Quizás tú también amas realmente a alguien, pero simplemente no estás seguro si   te sientes preparado para comprometerte por el resto de tu vida.      Los ligues y las citas de una noche te   empiezan a parecer baratos, y emborracharte y actuar como un idiota empieza a parecerte verdaderamente estúpido.        Salir tres veces por fin de semana resulta agotador y significa mucho dinero para tu peque?o sueldo.        Miras tu trabajo y quizás no estés ni un   poco cerca de lo que pensabas que estarías haciendo. O quizás estés buscando algún trabajo y piensas que tienes que comenzar   desde abajo y te da un poco de miedo.        Tratas día a día de   empezar a entenderte a ti mismo, sobre lo que quieres y lo que no. Tus opiniones se vuelven más fuertes.        Ves lo que los demás están haciendo y te encuentras a ti mismo juzgando un poco más de lo usual porque de repente tienes ciertos lazos en tu vida y adicionas cosas a tu lista de lo que es aceptable y de lo que no lo es.        A veces te sientes genial e invencible, y otras...solo,con miedo y confundido.        De repente tratas de aferrarte al   pasado,pero te das cuentade que el pasado cada vez se aleja más y que   no hay otra opción que seguir avanzando.        Te preocupas por el futuro,préstamos, dinero... y por hacer una vida para ti. Y mientras   ganar la carrera sería grandioso, ahora tan solo quisieras estar compitiendo en ella.        Lo que puede que no te des cuenta es que   todos los que estamos leyendo esto nos identificamos con ello.        Todos nosotros tenemos 'veintitantos' y nos gustaría volver a los 15-16 algunas veces.        Parece ser un lugar inestable, un   camino en tránsito, un desbarajuste en   la cabeza... pero TODOS dicen que es la mejor época de nuestras vidas y no tenemos que desaprovecharla por culpa de nuestros miedos...        Dicen que estos tiempos son los cimientos de nuestro futuro. Parece que fue ayer que teníamos 16... ??Entonces ma?ana tendremos 30!? ??????Así de rápido!!!???      HAGAMOS VALER NUESTRO TIEMPO... QUE NO SE NOS PASE!      La vida no se mide por las veces que respiras, sino por aquellos momentos que te dejan sin aliento...

20081012200920AA3DT9p	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Actual contest! :))) please read the whole thing if you want to participate?	Contest details- finally (:      This is what your entrée will be:     a VIDEO recording yourself           What to do on the video:   Sing ANY song you wish.      Rules/and important info:   you must introduce yourself at the beginning when making the vide   YOU MUST MSG ME FIRST, REQUESTING THE APPROVAL OF THE  SONG YOU WILL SING   AND CONCERT YOU WANT TO GO TO msg me with the subject as: approval request          **** I must approve the song you will be singing before you actually make the video****   With name, (first and initial of last), age, and state (just for transportation purposes if you are the winner), song you are singing and artist    You may only use you tube   Along with the introduction at the beginning of the video, also include what band (from the list) you wish to go see if you are the winner. And include the day I listed on the side if it   Some people don’t have a camera/webcam to record themselves but they do have a mic, so if this applies to you, please just record your voice, and for the picture, just make a slideshow of any band (it can even go along with the song you are singing), just so I wont have to look at a black image and just have to listen (: lol   Anyone from Canada and USA can participate, but note, there is TRANSPORTATION TO FLORIDA CONCERTS, THERE IS NO TRANSPORTATION FOR CALIFORNIA/ NEVADA CONCERTS. But if you wish to go to one of those concerts, you must find your own trans, and hotel (if needed)   Yes, trans, and hotel ARE included for FLORIDA CONCERTS   This is very very important: when sending me the link for the video you MUST put as the subject, VIDEO1012.       If you don’t, I will NOT accept your entree, only because it will get mixed up with my bussiness, school, and other personal mail.   If you are one of those people that instead of filming yourself you made a slideshow, and included yourself singing, please tell me the resources you used for the pictures.   Haha, yes, you may use lyrics and I want to make it a karaoke but it may be alttle hard for some of you, soooo, I will allow you to have to music playing in the background, but DONNOT let it drown out your voice.             You will be scored on:   Singing ability or effort (:   If you followed ALL the rules and guidelines   Song choice   Creativity     Video   Accuracy of lyrics   If you used the music in the background, or play an instrument,      how well you used it, and whether or not you let it drown out your voice   Projection of voice         Now here is the prize info:   - one grand prize winner. She/he will be notified by email.   - transportation and hotel will be paid for florida concerts only   -Grand prize includes- 3 vip tickets (you, a friend, and parent)   but I will be joining you, parent, and that other person at the concert   and then dinner afterwards!    ONE SPECIAL GUEST WILL BE JOINING ALSO :)         Regarding the special guest:   -the special guest will remain a secret!   - it has already been chosen, and we will be eating completely in private.   Haha, that sounds weird XD   What I mean is it will be a private dinner with the special guest, you, me, your parent, and your friend. It will be a small elegant ball room at a hotel (not named yet), and we will be served by caterers. It will be in private with closed doors and security, only because the special guest, is in fact, famous :) haha, well I like to say "well-known". And didn’t feel comfortable with the special guest being crowded by fans while eating, but it is set for them to meet some at a special time.    -since there are concert options for florida AND California&Nevada, there will be two different special guests, one for Florida, and one for California & Nevada.      Concerts-    Florida:   Tokio hotel- Orlando 10/24/08   The cheetah girls- Orlando 10/26/08   Tina Turner- Orlando 11/05/08    (also Kevin’s bday! *hint hint*, so Ill let you say a special hello to him on the phone!)

Your lips, your eyes, your soul   Are like a work of art,   The most creative thing of all   Is your beautiful heart.

If you were a sculpture   They clay could hardly make   Your figure of an angel   Without one mistake.   If you were a euphony   No choir could really sing   All the beautiful music   Yours eyes could possibly bring.   So here I am, an artist,   With inspiration beyond belief   But to capture such a rare beauty.   I'd have to be a thief.            Thank Your for you time.

A couple go for a meal at a Chinese restaurant and order the 'Chicken Surprise',       The waiter brings the meal, served in a lidded cast iron pot.      Just as the wife is about to serve herself, the lid of the pot rises slightly and she briefly sees two beady little eyes looking around before the lid slams back down.      'Good grief, did you see that?' she asks her husband. He hasn't, so she asks him to look in the pot. He reaches for it and again the lid rises, and he sees two little eyes looking around before it slams down.      Rather perturbed, he calls the waiter over, explains what is happening, and demands an explanation.      'Please sir,' says the waiter, 'what you order?'      The husband replies, 'Chicken Surprise.'         You're going to love this..................         You're going to hate yourself for loving this!.............        .      .'Ah!

Here's a possible theory:      In the caveman days there were 2 types of girls - farting and non-farting.      But the farting ones turned men off too much, so they never reproduced. So their farting DNA was not passed on.      The non-farting ones did attract men, reproduced, so passed on their non-farting DNA.      It's survival of the fittest/non-fartiest

Why do girls (of course not all girls), care about whether the music artist or band members in a band are handsome. A lot of bands e.g. boy bands rely on their looks rather than their music. But why do boys not think the same? I mean I haven't heard many boys listening to Britney Spears because they have a crush on her for example.

20081204064341AAZUVtI	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	Hoy doble eliminacion del Bailando quienes seran semifinalistas?y quienes afuera?	El martes, Mónica Farro y Eunice Castro quedaron eliminadas luego del duelo de Pop Latino. Así quedaron las parejas de: Pampita, Valeria Archimó, Adabel Guerrero, Marixa Balli, María Fernanda Callejón y Laura Fidalgo.      Pero esta noche el ritmo que mandará en la pista será el alegre  Cha, cha, cha, que tanto le gusta a Jorge Lafauci y luego habrá sentencia con doble eliminación, o sea Doblete. Por lo tanto, las seis parejas que llegaron a esta instancia, buscarán meterse en semifinales como sea y dejarán todo en la pista.      En nuestra encuesta en línea, Adabel Guerrero lleva las de perder, ya es la elegida por los visitantes a ser la proxima en despedirse de Bailando seguida por María Fernanda Callejón. Ambas han llegado muy lejos, y en el caso de María Fernanda que ha realizado un esfuerzo enorme teniendo en cuenta que no es bailarina, esto es todo un logro… logrará ubicarse entre las 4 mejores?      Y la semana próxima será durísima: en la semis habrá tres ritmos: árabe, cumbia y videoclip. Y para las dos parejas que se disputen la corona el jueves 11, no será más fácil: Divas, cuarteto y Axé serán los ritmos que definirán a los campeones.      Como sigue todo esto? Se abren las apuestas y a quienes se anime a vaticinar el triunfo, los comentarios están abiertos!   Con respecto a lo que paso el martes mi opinion ya que ayer estube muy ocupado para tocar la compu , es que fue super injusto la sentencia y el telefono por lejos fidalgo  fue la mejor  con lesion y so?ador nuevo y todo , la verdad no era su fan pero por la garra actitud carisma y dignidad de esta mujer me ha conquistado es admirable ayer la vi con la caanosa y cuando habla es un amor , ahora es mi unica favorita del bauilando le hago el aguante a la final creo que puede arrasaar  sin dudas , la jugarreta sucia que hizo ese juraducho  fue asquerozo y lamentable al telefono eran pampita callejon y farro y  se salvaba callejon una pena lo de eunice pero cuando lloro se vio falsiisima ahi dejo de ser mi favorita y me decepciono , lindo cachetazo al jurado por fin el publico pego una muy buena???   Hoy fuera pampita y archimo por acomodadas e insoportables y la robamaridos de adabel tb?????? en cuanto a farro se cai de maduro baila muy bien pero su personalidad es muy toxica y ahuyenta publico ademas de ocupar el lugar de grasarena que dejo vacante como gato 1ero de sofovich

20090304222314AAT8H2x	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Poll: do you think psychopaths know they are psychopaths?	I spent the majority of the day looking online about psychopaths and I am just curious, I know they don't want help but do they know what they are?    I also feel kind of bad for them (not the killers but the ones trying to live normal lives) because I was reading things that said they couldn't love and they had no real emotions other then anger. And some claimed to want to feel love and other emotions yet they couldn't.      I mean don't you feel kind of bad for them? they can never have a normal life with a spouse and kids.

20090305010901AAhNYwA	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Scenario: You're on your way home after having dinner at restaurant and you get excruciating bowel pains?	It's late at night, you're on your way home after eating a delicious meal at a fancy restaurant. As you drive, you feel a small pain in your stomach, you ignore it. A minute later, it becomes excruciating, to the point where you almost drive off the road, after which you realize it's your bowels.       You're still fifteen miles away from home yet only ten miles away from the restaurant that you came from. What do you do? They don't allow access into their restaurant unless you pay for their twenty dollar valet service and order a meal. The cheapest meal on the menu is an entrée and it's $31.97, excluding the tip.       You also realize that the area in which you're driving on, is filled with lights, which also have small dome cameras on the top of them, which were placed there due to the constant speeding on said roadway. Punishment for breaking any laws in the city you're in is severe, defacing public property is a minimum of fifteen days in jail or a $1,000 fine with a weekends worth of community service. What do you do?

20081108201313AA4kd3p	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	Can anyone give me titles of some really depressing songs?	I'm writing a story (for fun) and it would help me a lot if anyone knows some depressing songs. They relate to the theme of my story. I don't listen to music much so I'm having trouble coming up with possibilities. The idea I need is that two people in love have been separated and they're upset because they're apart. Very upset. The songs should be extremely depressing and have sad endings.       I'd like the songs to be by reasonably popular singers or groups rather than unknown singers. I don't care if you personally think the songs are good or bad. If you come up with a depressing song that you think is terribly written, it might actually be something I can use.

The man asks if he can meet the woman in the future but the woman refuses and says she will write her number in a book or smth (this part is kind of confusing). After that the man starts searching through bookstores but is unable to find the specfic one. By suprise he gets the book for christmas as a gift and the story continues...      Hope someone could name me the title of the movie. Both main characters should be dark-haired.      Thank you.

Un tipo algo ingenuo, que llevaba meses viajando para atender sus      clientes, volvió a su hogar y descubrió sorprendido que tenia un hijo *****.       Debido a que él era totalmente blanco, al igual que su esposa, le preguntó a ella:       pero cómo es posible que tengamos un hijo ***** si yo soy blanco y tú también?               La esposa, muy tranquila respondió...               Verás, como no tenia leche tuve que buscarme una mamá de cuna para que amamantara al ni?o y como ella era negra, el ni?o se puso de ese color...

20090305004403AAGAM2G	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Girls only.  Give me your advice.  :)?	I don't have a balloon fetish.  I get real scared to pop them and don't see how people do that.  They are so pretty, but it scares the hell out of me when I even think one is going to pop.  I hate it when they got to pop.  I can't pop one because they are so pretty, I get scared and feel sad when they pops.  I am nervous for a long time when one does pop and I get a panic attack.  I am ashamed of this.  Could you give me advice how to change my thinking so it isn't so bad when they pop?  I can't think of anything.  If you are scared when they pop, what do you do to prepare yourself.  I know the normal thing is cover your ears, but I don't want to look like a sissy.  I don't want to leave the room either because people will think I am weird or something.  Then people will laugh at me and pop them in my face (poor balloons).  I think I could pop one if I could think of it being fun.  How do I make that fun.  I just feel sorry for the balloons (I know they are just balloons, they don't live.  My sister use to torture me when i was little by popping them in my face.).  Am I a freak?  Please take me serious.

My cappy is ill and not just a cold ill he has crohn's disease so his confidence is low as it is plus to make things worse he has just been laid off his job - He knows i care about him and i'm there for him no matter what i even wrote him a 4 page ( A4 ) letter to show my feelings for him and my loyalty to him ( i'm a Capricorn too ) and although i felt like a kid doing this it was a much easier way to communicate to him   and the letter seemed to make him very happy ....      but obviously since then he has lost his job and now he has shut down and gone back into his littlebox i don't know why he has been laid off his job whether it's illness or what.       What shall i do? Anyone with male cappy experience have you been in this situation? it is very hard when someone is so reserved and you want to be there for him.... How can i cheer him up?

Ok, that question sounded really stupid... let me rephrase.    I've been listening to Queen's tribute to John Lennon (when they sang "Imagine" live) and, to be honest, the song sounded really...flat.       I am a massive Queen fan, huge, and in my personal opinion, Freddie slams Lennon vocally, so why did the song sound so bad? (comparatively anyway)       Maybe I'm used to hearing it with Lennon singing it...       What do you think?

The next day, there's a knock on the door and there stands before  him a   voluptuous, athletic, 19 year old babe dressed in nothing but a pair of   Nike running shoes and a sign around her neck.      She introduces herself as a representative of the weight loss company.   The sign reads, 'If you can catch me, you can have me.'      Without a second thought, he takes off after her. A few miles later   huffing and puffing, he finally gives up.      The same girl shows up for the next four days and the same thing   happens. On the fifth day, he weighs himself and is delighted to find he   has lost 10 lbs. as promised.      He calls the company and orders their 5-day/20 pound pro gram.      The next day there's a knock at the door and there stands the most   stunning, beautiful, sexy woman he has ever seen in his life.. She is   wearing nothing but Reebok running shoes and a sign around her neck that   reads, 'If you catch me you can have me'.      Well, he's out the door after her like a shot. This girl is in excellent   shape and he does his best, but no such luck. So for the next four days,   the same routine happens with him gradually getting in better and better   shape.      Much to his delight on the fifth day when he weighs himself, he   discovers that he has lost another 20 lbs. as promised. He decides to go   for broke and calls the company to order the 7-day/50 pound program      'Are you sure?' asks the representative on the phone. 'This is our most   rigorous program.'      'Absolutely,' he replies, 'I haven't felt this good in years.'      The next day there's a knock at the door; and when he opens it he finds   a huge muscular guy standing there wearing nothing but pink running   shoes and a sign around his neck that reads, 'If I catch you, your ***   is mine.'      He lost 63 pounds that week.       ________________________________

20090305042625AAyvp0g	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Where's Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) on Lost?	Does anyone know when Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) is coming back on Lost? I live in Australia, and we're currently up to the 4th episode of the 5th season and I'm a little confused. First off, I'm a DIE HARD Lost fan, have been since the beginning, and usually I can follow the plots pretty easily. But I'm interested in Claire's return to the main storyline, as she's been missing for quite some time, apparently to no one's dismay. I mean, the last time we saw her was season 4 when she was rocking on a chair in freaky Jacob's cabin with her dead father. And then a hallucination of Kate's in her home in Los Angeles yelling "Don't take him back there, Kate!" But since then it's like, poof! She's gone, never to return and no one ever mentions her! It's so frustrating! She didn't just drop off the face of the earth, or the island. She's still there, as far as I can surmise. I'm hanging out for the moment she stumbles out the jungle (again) and falls into someone arms saying "Where's Aaron?" Seems a little odd that she would have SO many problems with this kid, have it nearly stolen twice, nearly drowned by Charlie (accidentally) etc etc and be so attached to it to then suddenly deciding to leave him in a tree hollow and skip off with a ghost. Needless to say, I eagerly await the explanation. ANYWAY my real question is: does anyone know when Claire will be returning to the show? And please, don't post any answers that include spoilers about what's going to happen. I just want to know what episode she'll be returning in. Thank you!!

I'ts called Beautiful Epiphany and you can actually hear it if you want at www.myspace.com/foreshadowtheodds      "I have seen the light. I've seen it poke its head out through the clouds and the sun-ridden sky. Open up your eyes And you will see just how beautiful your hand looks in mine.       Write me your goodbyes, for this may very well be the last time you'll ever see me cry. In another life, I hope to see you standing next to me, right here by my side.       We will never let it die. We will forever be You and I. I hope, in time, you realize that this can reignite and take us to another world. Another place in time.       We have taken lives. We've taken those who spoke out against the Good with evil in their eyes. We have flown the skys. We've seen land that man has never walked on. That's never been seen by the human eye.       You took my disguise. You made me find out who I really am, way deep down inside. If I die tonight, I want you to know that I've got no regrets, nothing's left behind."

Banda de CyA, yo se que este es un foro donde discutimos de cosas que nos gustan como el anime y el manga, pero habemos muchos que no vamos tan adelantados en algunas series (como naruto), y de repente entramos en preguntas donde hay una cantidad brutal de spoiler (adelantos) que en lo personal me hechan a perder la historia. Asi que quiero proponer que si se va a hablar de algun spoiler de cualquier serie, al inicio de la pregunta o de su respuesta, adviertan que hay adelantos de las series, para los que vamos un poco mas atrasados que los demas no entremos o no las leamos. Ya se que pido mucho pero diganme que piensan banda. Estan deacuerdo o me voy al diablo (ya he estado por ahi pero por ahora no quiero ir).      Soy el poder encarnado
