Just having a good guess. Lol
HYly0RE1aa	You can do what he said above. The same thing happend to me except I kept on trying and trying untill I finaly got it. Make sure your internet connection is 100% connected reset your main computer that has the main source of your internet and reset your modem (as said above.  Other then that, just keep trying, or call xbox (as worthless as they already are)  Hope that helps.|`|BrVPlsdsaa	Reset your modem- If this does not work, try disconnecting from Xbox Live and make a silver account- then add gold account.
AA10726404	So because you lost, you are claiming it is rigged, and indignantly asking how they can be allowed to play in America?  Would you have asked the same question if you had won?    While Ultimate Bet is not one of my favorite sites, and there have been a couple of problems with their sister site Absolute Poker, as a general rule you are going to be quite safe at low stakes tables.  None of the major poker sites rig the games, because to do so would be utter stupidity.  The best way to make money for them is to spread a safe and trustworthy game that people enjoy, then they can simply rake a big profit.    Online poker sites are not based in America.  So you simply used the Internet to access a site in a foreign country that was operating perfectly legally.  You lost the money fair and square and that's the end of it.|`|atbAakXuaa	Ultimate bet is associated with Absolute poker and both are on blacklists|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	You lost to someone else, not to the website.  Suck it up and don't blame anyone but yourself.    If you truly believe it's rigged, then don't put any more money in.    How to they gamble in the USA?  They aren't in the USA.|`|AA11001595	ultimatebet.com is a legit site. I've played there before, and I know how it works. I also work in a poker room in a real casino. I've seen things as crazy as anyone online. It's all real, legit, and annoying when it goes wrong.    That's why poker is so popular. Bad players sometimes win. They even win all the time for stretches of time.    There's nothing you can do about your debit card losses. Sorry. It's all legit. If anything, you'll get in trouble for playing poker online in the first place. Ulitimatebet.com is an overseas company though and therefore cannot be sued or anything like that anyway.

sWKGUPziaa	Can you add to details what your computer is? Laptop or Desktop? I might be able to help you. Okay, I can tell you that if it's a desktop, it could be your video card that's making it crash if it doesn't meet the Sims 2 requirements. If it is a laptop, it's because the game is running in the background on your computer.   What I mean by running in the background means that : I have an Acer 2007 laptop and I installed the Sims 2 and tried to play it. It crashed at Create a Family every time I tried to play. It crashed all the time. So, getting sick of it my husband called up Radio Shack. Right away the man there said that the game keeps crashing because the game is running in the background. During start up there are all these programs running. Alot of them don't have to run at start up. Because all these programs are running, it forces the game to run in the background on the computer and it causes the game to crash. Esp. at Create A family! :( So in order to get the game not to crash anymore, the man went to start up and disabled all the unnecessary programs. Now my game no longer crashes. At all. This is what sounds like is happening to your game. It crashes at Create A Family. The reason all these programs are put on start up is so that when you go to use these programs you can click on them and they will load right away. You don't have to wait. When they are disabled at start up, when you click on a program you have to wait for it to load and it takes longer. I think that in order for your game to stop crashing you should disable the unnecessary programs that run at start up. I'll tell you how. Click on Run. (Don't see it? Click on Start icon, All Programs, Accessories. Run is in Accessories.) Click on Run and a box will pop up. Type in msconfig Then click on the Start Up tab. There will be a list of programs that are checked off. The only program that needs to stay checked off is your security system. That one must stay checked off. The rest can be unchecked. They will still run, just not at start up. When you are done, click Apply and Okay. Then you will have to restart your computer so the changes take effect. Then play your game. IF it crashes at all after that, try changing your in game settings to lower settings. Your game will crash if your video card doesn't totally support the Sims 2 game. Just turn off reflections and transparency, then set the other graphics to lower settings. This should help. Then you can adjust the video/ graphics a little to better settings to see how your computer's video card reacts. Hope this helps. (Or you can give your local Radio Shack a call. They can help you. They are really smart people! :)|`|ghItgMZxaa	computer that's not made for gaming get a better one|`|LZaQiLlyaa	You need more memory, a graphics card,,,,,,, basically your computer isn't set up for gaming!

Multiples of Masked Dragon, Blizzard Dragon, Mirage Dragon and Lord of D. is a good idea.   Imho Dragon decks are probably the toughest to build. Not because of price or anything but because they don't have any great Swarm tactics and there are plenty of anti-dragon cards and everybody knows how to beat Dragon decks.

37evQRaDaa	I haven't found a place on the internet, but if you check your local library you can probably find a book or two with body shapes.  If your local library doesn't have anything, you can ask them to get the book for you using the Inter Library Loan system.  You'll need to figure out which books you want, and then they can order them from another library.  I would make book recommendations, but I don't know if you're planning to make an electric or accoustic.      Have you considered scrapping traditional shapes and going with something unique?  I've been building a lot of cigar box guitars lately.  Having a pre-made box for the body is really nice, and they still sound good.  You can even make your own pickups if you want to electrify it.    There are some pictures of my builds here: http://flickr.com/photos/resistzine/sets...

W93PhNRwaa	I bought an xbox 360 shortly after they came out I really liked it and so did my husband and there are a lot of games that are exclusive to xbox that kick *** like Gears of War. However i didn't know that Xbox online was gonna cost us like $150 more to use because you have to buy a subscription and we had to purchase a super long ethernet cord to hook to our computer. We had our 360 for about 6 months before it crashed with the rings of death. We replaced it with a PS3 and really I think it is better, not only is online play free but there is a playstation store to purchase games and what not, which my hubby has put to good use. Also there are games where you use the PS3 controller kinda like a Wii controller which is super cool! Our fave is a bowling game we bought on the playstation store, you use the controller like a bowling ball. You can also access files on your computer with the PS3 so i can look at my pictures and watch my videos on my television through my PS3. And of course it has a blue ray player which is why my hubby wanted it in the first place however we watch regular dvds on it also. So in my opinion i would say go PS3 the only thing i miss about out xbox is the fact i can't play Gears of War 2 :(  SO that's my very girly opinion:)|`|1VPFZEZAaa	i would say xbox cause honestly it is wayyyyy better than ps3 but it breaks a lot my brother has one and it breaks like every 2 months. the only thing really epic about the 360 is the live thing, and the graphics but yeah.|`|YweJ1PfUaa	xbox360|`|1o05hQ1Uaa	I prefer Xbox.  PS3 is good as well. There are still a lot of good games on the PS3 but I find the Xbox to have better quality and more games.|`|HcCd0ybQaa	I WOULD HONESTLY SAY THE XBOX BECAUSE I USES MY UNCLES AT THE MOMENT AND THE GAMEPLAY AND THE GRAPHICS A JUST LITERALLY OUT OF THIS WORLD|`|pws2l0Ckaa	I've personally never owned a 360, so I can't praise or bash it. However, I will say that, if you buy a PS3, you will not be disappointed. Online services are free on the PS3, the library of exclusives for the system has grown, with titles such as Resistance 2, Littlebigplanet, Metal Gear Solid 4, and the upcoming Killzone 2. The graphics of PS3 games will get better, with current games using an estimated 40-50% of the PS3's processing power. The PS3 is also the only console so far to be able to use Blu-Ray, and even being cheaper than most Blu-Ray players on the market. These are some of the major reasons to purchase a PS3, but their alot of other little features on the system that make all the difference. Like I said before, you won't be disappointed.|`|Djn12V5oaa	definitly xbox but it depends on what you like|`|YLvTNF08aa	The Xbox360 has a better selection of console exclusives however online has to purchased through a subscription and the console is notorious for breaking and the "Red Ring of Death" which is 3 red rings around the power button.    The PS3 doesn't have as many good exclusives, but online play is free and doesn't break as often.   The PS3 also has a blu-ray player and has better graphics for gaming in my opinion.|`|WfqJK9cDaa	Very simple answer. PS3 is over rated because of it's so called graphics, plus its more expensive. The wifi in the PS3 is very weak, so playing online is useless as you will get laggy games. Plus, the wireless remotes arent the best things to use as they loose signal sometimes. I would definitely go for an xbox 360. Better graphics, better in terms of controlling, only downside you have to pay for online which is around $40/year. Not alot, but its upto your budget. If your into shooter and action games, I would go for xbox, but if you are into like adventure and sports games, then go for ps3. Your choice mate.|`|yMM8yY3daa	PS3     I bought a PS3 it has awesome graphics and getting a PSN is free (you have top pay $100 for Xbox live) and the are lots of games on Ps3 that xbox has and if want to play xbox games you can get an emulator to play xbox games

It's like cyber bullying, most people can get away with writing nasty comments without having to talk or contact that person again.    ...or, they're just jerks.|`|AA12328571	Because alot of the players are below the age of like 13 or something or have no maturity. I wouldnt let it get to you, there balls havent dropped yet so they very immature. Another big reason is because they are protected behind a screen so you cant hurt. If they said it in public they know they will get hurt.|`|c68XWGltaa	because it's anonymous and fun as hell.|`|kxrSAI6haa	That happens everywhere, most of the time it's just little wimps who want to sound tough on the computer.    Guarenteed, most (i said most) of them would run away from you as fast as their skinny legs could carry them if they met you for real.    Nothing you can do about it, just ignore it|`|Y1iYQJvWaa	Because they are whips in the real world if they come face to face with people the wouldn't say boo to a goose LOL|`|jto3YOQJaa	in games such as warcraft, ppl tend to "rage" and thus lose their regard for others as they are too caught up in the game.|`|FRokosDjaa	Because they can hide behind a user name and you don't know who there are. In person they wouldn't be so ugly to you, they are cowards don't worry about it. And it annoys me to.|`|XzBAlPBTaa	I say who cares of your gender... People are mean because they think since there such "high levels and stuff" that they have autority over you and everything which is total nonsence... Just ignore them and keep looking because there are sooo many nicer people you just need to find them :D|`|je1JuFnbaa	Because it's a cruel world and, at some point, they were treated like crap by their peers, parents, teachers or siblings in the real world and they're now taking advantage of the opportunity to pass some of that hurt on to someone else.    Sad but true.      .|`|HpPNg0heaa	I agree why do people have to be so rude?!?!     I play some online games and I only call someone a "NOOB!" if they are a "noob" lol (I still don't say is much though). but when people call people noob for no reason or all the time that is when I get mad.|`|40i3ycHyaa	thats just what you do on games like that|`|xZYS9nDKaa	Its because most of the time they can get away with it.|`|mYI6J8SYaa	ye i play online too, and it happens a lot in some servers..  But its just people typing silly things, i bet you they dont feel like that... They're just stupid and bored!|`|NJrsrT12aa	because its annoying when you get people on games that don't know what they're doing.|`|IdUENGLxaa	they probably get punkd very often in physical reality so when they enter a cyber world where they can express theyre real arrogance they tend to do it in a very douche bag like fashion|`|OUZnB9Hzaa	It's a game and guys don't really care so they be dicks when they are safely behind their computer screen.|`|O86ieLjPaa	The ones who are rude as most likely very socially awkward, and on WOW etc, they are masked behind their computer screen which allows them the confidence to poke at others, to get back at all the other people who make fun of them.    Those games are bad habits. Be careful.|`|CWlKnQPuaa	To be good at those games you have to be a loser, remember at the end of the day you win because they waste their time on video games.|`|haapeymNaa	They're mad because because they get made fun of in school and won't lose their virginity until they're 26. The few that aren't socially incompetent are just jerks.    But hey, it's just the internet, right? Don't take anything people tell you on here too seriously, including this. ;)|`|218b808e7b15d3ab6f134c62bbbafc16aa	Boys compete.     And when they fight or compete in star or warcraft, they get dirty.    And when you are a girl and they get beat by one, it's worst.|`|0Pv2jt8faa	Because in the real world, nerds get abused and harassed on a daily basis. In their world, they are the abusers and harassers.    It's quite simple really, just a power trip.    Plus, basic rule of thumb, anonymity + free speech = douche.    However, gamer-terminology and real life ettiqute is a DRASTIC contrast to one another. Things which we would normally be apalled by are essentially terms of endearment among their groups.|`|rJu4X6MDaa	anomynity (spelling sucks) makes peopl mean.      **** OR GTFO!, STFU NOOB, and GO KILL YOURSELF!.   are things people will normally say when anomynous.|`|YM6MrT8Xaa	Because they feel that because they are hiding behind a computer screen, common decency does not apply, and they can act like immature little children. Real gamers (talking about them, not you) go to LAN parties where they can look their enemy in the eye and say "I'm better than you, and I can prove it". It annoys me too, some games you have to put up with it, other you can make them shut up, and there is always blocking them.|`|NdC2s0F5aa	They want to be something, but they are not. They feel big and bad when they talk crap. You can't really talk to people on either SC or WC. I know what you're talking about man, 90% of the players are like that. If they call you a noob, you probably said something to offend them, or if you're losing in a game and they call you a noob, that guy just feels superior and wants to feel "POWER OVERWHELMING" so.. just let it go. You can't be a NOOB if you're not New. :D|`|WfqJK9cDaa	It is simple. First of all, they can be anywhere in the world, so they know they are safe abusing people online. Second, they are little nerds cause they get bullied themselves, and they have no where to take the anger out except somewhere no one will retaliate( Online). Third, they think being good at a game is like being a hotshot, eventhough it means they got no life cause they spend their whole like on games. Fourth, they just want to look cool in front of their virtual friends, notice I said virtual. Many other reasons, but I would say ignore them. Dont retaliate, that is exactly what they want. If worst comes to worst, just LOL to everything they say, they will get annoyed themselves and just leave you alone.|`|bqeBvlJ5aa	Because in real life they are nerds who can only try to possible be cool online. Of course, it fails, but they seem to think they are intimidating.|`|T2RjJdhbaa	because they think that they are soo tough on the other side. its more of an ego boost for them. but really they have no life and are taking it out on other people|`|0rlGY8DXaa	yeah it really is a lame problem in online games everywhere. I guess the annonimity of having a virtual avatar thinks they can be a dick to everyone they meet because of some insecurity in real life (least my theory on it). It's not just WoW or starcraft. And it's not always boys either...    And it doesn't matter if it's the internet or not, people should have some damn respect for each other.|`|EOrpDYrBaa	Well just for example if you play online, play games with other noobs ( the title will say if its meant for noobs) until your pro enough for the "big boys". lol listen to me =p how funny    Anwyays for example i used to play a game called Island Defense and i was a BIG noob at it, so i just practiced alone for like 1-2 hours and i became pro. Now i am the one calling out noobs. Its just for fun, its called trolling btw. If you get unlucky and no1 beleives you just pwn them... straight up.|`|0VY5biYeaa	they just think there cool for calling you names, but in reality there just hella dumb so if i was you i would just say suck it and go on with my day. hope that helps.|`|7wyLpa2Eaa	because they have confidence that no one will find out who there are, and they can be as cocky and arrogant as they want  im sure if there was a picture of the person and their address above their character no one would say anything|`|yaMMXrbLaa	This may be because most of the guys who play those games, are losers in real life. They have a horrible social life, which is the reason that they are mean. They probably get picked on, so when playing those games, they call others names since no one can actually see and hurt them, and they can then feel "superior" and "powerful."   Or they can just be regular guys, who act like guys act when around other guys. You're a girl, and when guys are around girls, they're nicer, but when just around guys, they poke fun at eachother more.|`|32m4mGbWaa	Because you and Spazzo (the one that gave all neg. ratings untill his answer)    Are fun to make fun of|`|12ChLNoJaa	well the only reason they talk CRAP is because they r in a game and only they because they know u wont do anything|`|86f625d9ffc20e37a8b5cc419322fe53aa	Are you really goint to take offence from a 13 year old kid that sits and playes games all day? And, anyone older than 13 that is still playing video games is just a loser and sits at home all day with no job cause they suck at life and are good at videogames.|`|AA11371251	all the games have people like that because guys like to act tough and talk down on each other to make themselves feel more superior and plus you have to remember most gamers have no life they get bored and talk S*%&!|`|1VPFZEZAaa	ugh. because they have no patience they're life is basically those games, and when people screw up a bit the act like butt holes.|`|ShLuWq1Eaa	cuz your a girl    haha    NOOB!!!|`|FQuuztpQaa	Because their sleazebags, & they love to bullsh!t.
HpPNg0heaa	To be honest... cutting yews are my favorite way to make money.  but another good way to make money is to buy mithril ore, and coal, and then smith into bars, the bars sell for more then 4 coal and 1 mithril ore so you make profit, you also get smithing xp.   I have made about 20 million  cutting yews and smithing mithril bars. So if you want to buy party hats look else where.  there are many ways to make money if you are still a member but I have never been a member so I cant help you there.    also to the WoW players... for a browser based game that is FREE with the new graphics update the graphics are NOT bad.|`|om0zcFigaa	Sigh...|`|JZKqROgraa	well if your a member, i just picked flax and made bowstring, takes a while put you can make some pretty good money. i personally think runescape is terrible now that they made SO MANY rules =)|`|MGDtjCK1aa	move to wow man|`|xZYS9nDKaa	DUNNO... stop playing that...

vtJDHJDYaa	Phantom:  As soon as this battle begins, fly over to the clock and cast Stopra on the minute hand. This causes the clock to stop for a short while. If the clock reaches the 12, you can kiss one of your party members goodbye for the rest of the battle. Needless to say, you don't want this to happen a third time, or you lose the battle. When the Stopra spell wears off, cast another one.    Anyway, you have to look under Phantom in order to find out how to hurt it. If the orb under it is red, cast a Firaga spell. If the orb under it is blue, cast a Blizzaga spell. Yellow is Thundaga, and white is a physical attack. Once in a while, he'll fly in front of one of the clock faces and shoot energy balls at you that deplete your HP, but this shouldn't be a problem if you are flying away from it. To avoid this attack, simply fly around to the other side of the Clock Tower when you see it pause in front of the clock face. Follow the rules of this battle, and you should emerge victorious (especially if you're around level 77).    More detailed FAQ:  http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file...    Kurt Zisa:  As the battle starts, cast Aeroga quickly, because your magic is about to get locked. Superglide over to Kurt Zisa and attack the glowing orbs in his hands. After you kill each one, HP Balls will be released. When it falls over, immediately start attacking its head. You should be able to deplete its life to at least the orange bar.    Keep in mind that if you summon Tinker Bell, she will heal you during the parts when your magic is locked.    When Kurt Zisa gets up again, it casts a protective barrier around it which can only be destroyed by magic. Thundaga seems to be the most damaging spell, but Firaga can be cast the quickest. It's up to you what spell you use. When you hit the shield, MP Balls fall out, so try and stay in close. When the shield is destroyed, continue hitting it again. When it gets back up, it will start the pattern over again by sealing your magic. To make the battle shorter, use special abilities on it while it's stunned. If you use Mushu during this portion of the battle, the shield will fall a lot faster.    If you have two MP Rages and MP Haste equipped, then just follow Kurt Zisa when it puts up the magic barrier. Donald will cast spells, making it shoot out MP Balls, and if any of the attacks hit you, you will gain MP and be able to heal. This is a good way to recharge.    The second time it seals your magic, it uses a spinning blade attack the you can't dodge. You'll just have to use an Elixir or Hi-Potion halfway through the flurry of attacks if you want to survive. Then continue beating up the orbs.    Kurt Zisa should go down after he uses his barrier for the second time.

mTNz8GHGaa	In order to get the Ice Arrows, you need to complete the Gerudo Training Grounds.  You can only finish the training grounds if you have every item from every temple, including the Mirror Shield.  The Ice arrows aren't necessary to complete the game; however, they are a nice reward for a sidequest.    Gerudo Training Grounds:    KEY ONE:  Go through the left door as you come in from Gerudo's Fortress. Go through the door that is in the Lion's Mouth, this is the start of the Trials. You will face two Stalfos on a sandy area along with a switchblade, and you have only 1:00 to kill them both. Try to keep the fight out of the sand, since it slows you down a tad. Once they are both killed a chest will drop down on the red mat, inside is a Small Key! Head through the door behind it.    KEY TWO:  This room is a maze with a lot of fire curtains, along with two holes that spew out an infinite amount of boulders. The Key is not in here, but the exit is barred, so you'll need to collect all the Silver Rupees to open it (and you only get 1:00, so make it snappy). One is at the top of where you enter, use the Longshot to grapple yourself there. Another one is near the exit, again, use the Longshot target. You can see one, but a fire curtain is blocking it, so you'll need to find another path that goes around, avoid the boulders, and grab it! The last two are by the second boulder hole, one under it and another near the cliff. Now, use the Longshot targets to exit this room.     In this room you will fight two White Wolfos and two normal Wolfos. Make the fight shorter by using a powered up Spin Slash! When they're all dead a chest will appear, inside are some arrows.  Now, the door in here is FAKE and will hurt you if you attempt to open it. See that huge gray block in the wall? If you have the Silver Gauntlets (found in the Spirit Temple) you can move it out of the way. But oh no, the door is barred! Return to the Wolfos area and use your Lens of Truth, you will find an invisible tunnel above the fake door. Use your Longshot to get up there, then trigger the switch. Now the door is un-locked, so go back and enter it (duh).    Inside this room, which is a dead-end, are three Like Likes! Stun them with the Longshot then jab them to death. The chest on the altar is FAKE and will freeze you if you try to open it. The chest in the hole has some Rupees, and when you kill all the Like Likes another chest will appear, it has a Golden Rupee (worth 200!). Use the Lens of Truth to find an invisible chest, inside is a Key!    KEY THREE:  Return to the room where you battled the Wolfos. Go back into the secret tunnel and head into the door there. Go along the ledge to your right and you'll find a barred door...You'll hear a voice say "Blind the eyes of the statue!" So, drop down to the large statue and shoot each of its eyes with an arrow. The barred door will un-lock, and a chest will drop down, it has the third Key.    KEY FOUR:  Now that the barred door is un-locked you can go through...but you can't get back unless you fall into the lava to appear from where you came in or use the Scarecrow's Song. Inside is a chest on some grating...inside is the fourth Key!     KEY FIVE:  Go back into the statue room and drop down to the statue, look at the wall and you'll spot a door with a Longshot target near it, so get over there. In this room is a small chest with fire around it, several large statues, and a lot of baddies!     First off, kill all the creatures. Besides opening up the exit, you'll get a chest with some arrows inside. Now, use the Megaton Hammer to knock down the statues. One will have an eyeball inside, peg it with an arrow to open up the entrance (just in case you want to go back to something). Another will have a switch, it will stop the flames...for a limited time. So quickly go over to the chest and open it, inside is the fifth Key!    KEY SIX:  Exit the room and you'll be in a lava place with a few Silver Rupees. To get the one over your head, use the Longshot target. Two are found on platforms, and the last is being covered in fire. Using your Hoverboots, you can get to a distant island which has a switch, it will put the fire out for a few seconds. When all the Rupees are collected, both exits will be open. However, don't go anywhere yet! On the right side of the room (from the entrance), you'll notice that Navi keeps turning green...play the Song of Time and a few Blue Blocks will appear. Climb them and you'll find a lonely Key on a mat. NOTE: If you take the right path in the maze of locked doors, a side path will take you to this key nearly right away. So, there are two ways to get the Key (an oddity in this game!).    KEY SEVEN:  Go back to the lava place. Which exit to take, which exit to take? Try the one on the left wall (coming from the entrance). Play the Song of Time to get rid of the Blue Blocks, then fall into the water and sink down to the bottom using your Iron Boots (obviously). First off, get rid of the group of Shellblades, it will make your life a lot easier.  One Silver Rupee is in the middle, near the Sitchblade. Three others are in the middle, to reach them simply use the Longshot targets to pull yourself to them (you need to be standing under the Rupee when you use it. Should be easy if you've been to the Shadow Temple...). The last one, which is at the top, requires you to take off the Iron Boots and swim around up there until you can grab it. This is more difficult than it sounds due to the vicious currents. When they are all collected a chest will appear near where you entered, it has a Key in it!    KEY EIGHT:  Go back to the lava place. Take the exit that is straight ahead from the entrance. You have to kill two Dinolfos and a Beamos in 1:30. If you've faced the Dinolfos before it shouldn't be too hard, but if this is your first encounter, then|`|ye9h5jXvaa	You need to complete the Gerudo Training Grounds, which you'll come across eventually if you haven't already. You won't be able to complete it until you've got the item from the very last dungeon, though, so if you're not close to the end of the game yet it's best to forget about the arrows for now.|`|AA11108540	http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/n64/file...

3d9b08f406cb8d4b476856b0e645cec4aa	here is some general information about poker hands that you need to know before you play poker:    http://www.ehow.com/how_4742833_hold-em-...|`|jDwAMqaMaa	If your looking for free information then 2+2 is by far the best site (like the first poster mentioned).    If you want to take your poker much more seriously then it's well worth subscribing to Cardrunners.com or maybe Deuces Cracked.  They have 100's of instructional video's covering cash, torny's, plo etc    -You may be able to find some free instructional video's in the members contribution section on 2+2|`|AA11001595	The best site on the internet for learning about poker is http://www.twoplustwo.com    They have very well known poker writers and players working for them, and their forumns are excellent.    If you're looking for a more basic strategy, such as which hands to play before the flop, some poker odds, and how to manage your money, then a simple site like http://www.chainpoker.com will get the job done.|`|gnUX1aB1aa	I use a site called centpoker to practice Texas Hold 'Em. Personally I think that it's a good way to brush up on your skills for free though if you want to earn some money then you can do that too. They give you 100 chips to go to the tables and play against tons on other people and when you win you obviously rake in the chips but when you lose and your balance goes below 100 chips they will automatically top your balance up to 100 chips.
ckiqO9V0aa	Pros: World of Warcraft is an extremely fun game. What makes it good is that like alot of online games it never ends! Theres an insane amount of armour, weapons, and you can make friends join guilds, and do missions together. Along with that you can meet your real life friends on it and talk to them too. Takes some practice to get use to, but once you do you are able to fight other players, and ascend in ranks, which gets you better gear.    Cons: WoW while being really fun is EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE. To get good at the game it requires very large amounts of time. And if you're not willing to give this time up, you might as well not play it! It takes up money, and effects your social skills in a big way. It's easy to put your friends on the game infront of your friends in real life, which as I see it is a BIG DEAL! It also makes you spend money on something that will NEVER help you in life. So in the end you're just gonna loose friends, waste your money, and live a boring life always trying to get better than other people on the game.    From my own personal experience (my brother played for about 4 1/2 years) it's a terrible game, and when I grow up I would NEVER let my children play it. A ONE WAY TICKET TO LONERDOME!    Hope this helped!|`|s5Oa83sYaa	con: waste of money  pro: keeps some poe-ple happy  con: most people that play never see the light of day  pro: gimlie is a tank|`|lHOmVfaOaa	I have absolutely no interest in playing that.|`|YM6MrT8Xaa	Pro: Can train a monkey to level your character.    Con: Not cool like EVE Online.    Conclusion: EVE Online > WoW|`|aLzymSxraa	I've lost some good friends to wow    along with nice $300-$400    After awhile i learned that there is so much more to life than that game.     that's all i can say about that.     sorry its not in the right format but for the reasons above I can't say I would be brief in dissing wow|`|8vIiBt9qaa	Serious Answer  Pros: It's a pretty fun game that many people can play. Some of my ex girlfriends picked up on it and played it casually. It's a typical online RPG game meaning you make online friends earn skills etc etc. There's a serious side if you want to take it to the next level.    Cons: It's time consuming. Monthly fee. Computer game, meaning you have to upgrade to a decent computer to run it. Too many people know it's name and so it has a bad name, therefore you'd feel embarrassed. A lot of NERDS play it.
PXWVGQyAaa	The ripple afghan is my favourite pattern !  The trick is to always have the same number of stitches going up and down.  If I find there is an extra st, I single crochet two together. If there is one less, I make an extra stitch in between two stitches. You can't notice later anyway .  It is also important that the 3 single crochets at the top of the point are always in the center stitch.   I have made hundreds of baby afghans in a myriad of colours and rarely have I had to pull out any rows.|`|411e33cff378a28929963f21b85453abaa	first off, you pooooor thing!   I HATE ripple aphgans, as I am never accurate with them. I either have too many or too few.  However....they are beautiful ,if they are done with colors that go together,mauve,pinks, and grey, are my fave. Many shades of green, from white, to light green and medium green and dark green, is one I find soothing.  Ok, that said, you tube has tutorials and they show it in real time.   Try that one,maybe. I mean, pics are great but to have it shown to you as if they are in the room with you, is even better,I think.  I'm back.  This lady has helped me with alot of learning in crochet. For years,i didn't know how to use blanket sticth,and I learned from watching her videos.  She is the "crochet lady" on You tube.   Here is her site.  http://www.youtube.com/user/tjw1963    good luck.   You can make ripple in sc, half-dbl, or my fave stitch, dc.  The trick is to have the same number of added stitches that you skipped.   I always mess up and refuse to make a ripple aphgan.  You have fortitiude,I tell ya.  I won't make one, but yet I'll knit.  Go figure!|`|AA11287246	Hey, this lady has GREAT tutorials. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYBAhIxJA...    I'm in the process of making a camo hoodie, single stitch. Slow and steady....

lOp75aGUaa	It really depends on what type of gamer you are (or will become).   If you have the time...  For PS2, "Shadow of the Colossus" was a massively amusing game. You're just a guy, with a sword and bow, and need to take down these giants to save the one you love! (good for beginners)    If you're into great stories I would also recommend "Psychonaughts" which was originally on the XBox but works fine for ps2. (good for beginners)     Final Fantasy X, or XII are very long, very time consuming, but very worth the narrative. (umm... kinda tough call)     "Beyond Good and Evil" was a really great, sleeper kinda hit, you can probably find it for cheap. It's a stealth kinda game, but still good story.(good for beginners)    oooooo. "Metal Gear Solid". the only problem is you would have to get the first metal gear solid for ps1, but it's soooo good. stealth espionage action. (umm, kinda tough)|`|d889ec36bb9adc89f3addb3dde100e23aa	Ratchet and Clank will hold your attention  Tekken is a nice way to get into fighting games  Final fantasy is decent for RPGs  Burnout is a really fun racing game  SSX is about the best Snowboarding game out there|`|3zGoVqGFaa	We Love Katamari!!! ^0^  It's easy to play and SO much fun!  When you beat the game you cant get tired of it and the cool songs!!  MUST GET GAME!!!|`|8vIiBt9qaa	Surely you have friends that play video games. One of those times you have watched them and thought that it was fun. Give us your genre of gaming such as: Sports, Role Playing, Action, Adventure, etc.|`|feoZNxbDaa	Try GTA San Andreas, that's my choise ;)|`|lLs8tcU4aa	I could probably suggest lots of PS2 games.    But I would actually suggest a game I once played.    Spyro 2 may sound like a really rubbish PS1 game, but it was the first console game I ever played and I played it when I was only five.    Lots of people were doubting I would be able to understand game consoles at all. But I turned out to be better than every one had predicted.     I would say that that is a really good first game.    Hope this helps.|`|WDXFWTg7aa	Hi!  I got XBOX a couple weeks ago, so i'm not quite sure about the PS2's, but I can suggest from my range of gaming, trying which ever game looks most appealing to you!  Most video games have demos teaching you how to play the game, and instruction booklet's inside on how to play the game.  Hope this help's!|`|gp06e2Shaa	Try To play God of War 1 & 2.One of the best games ever. U can also try The Metal Gear Series for the PS2.|`|70Ecmsn0aa	Go for games that have a lot of free play in them to get used to the controllers and the basics of how to play games. Games like GTA san andreas. Then try your luck with missions and other games.

iDMQVOG1aa	Most of my inspiration comes from the Patchwork EasyAs group. I look at other people's patchwork and figure out how I can improvize my own patterns.    I also visit the county fair on weekends to check up on fresh fabrics and wallhanging designs. They give me a feel of what I can quilt up next.
AA10160394	OH, I belive there is a way, I think in the game if you export them or something to a folder, you can then do whatever you want with them. Lionhead studios (the people who made the game) also have a website that has a lot of user made movies!|`|AA10350480	the previous answer hit it right on the head, so give him the 10 points, i'm here just for the 3, so whatever.

z66FWrz1aa	Finally a question about a game I've played since it first came out and I don't know the answer. It might be a glitch. I suggest restarting the game and then try again. You should be able to destroy them. If not just put them in your bank so they don't waste bag space.|`|N19mmDELaa	you should be able to destroy any item.|`|h7Maa69baa	just drop it|`|Vy33yWR5aa	Um, if you cannot destroy them, you could always try to contact a GM by opening up a ticket. GMs are capable of getting rid of unwanted items and will most likely do so. I'd say destroy them but seeing as how you cannot...|`|ckiqO9V0aa	If you can't destroy them, or sell them it means they are for a quest, and that is the only way to get rid of them.

Z2EzfQFvaa	I suggest piplup.|`|w4qS66aqaa	piplup :]]]]]] trust me|`|jA6OZjIGaa	let me analyze all three starters first before i tell you which one to choose from <br>  <br>  Turtwig is a grass type, but later turns becomes Grass n Ground. That is a HUGE disadvantage, because Ice can kill Torterra in only one or two moves (in battle tower). Also the combination of Grass and Ground turned many types instead of "ineffective", to just normal. ex. water. Turtwig is good at the 1st(rock), 4th(water), 6th(steel), and 8th(electric) gym with Grass n Ground<br>  <br>  Chimchar is a fire, but becomes Fire n Fighting in lv 16 when it evolves to Monferno. that is a advantage because fire is not good against rock, and by evolving can take care of that. Besides it can learn Flare Blitz and Close Combat, which are very powerful. One more hint, fighting is good against five types, which is the most so far in pokemon<br>  <br>  Piplup is a water and turns Water n Steel later on. the combination of types are good, but it doesnt learn many steel moves by itself besides Metal Claw. Empoleon is supposed to be better at Special Attacks, so that would be waste since it can't learn Flash Cannon by itself. The disadvantage is when it is only Water, only grass n electric is effective, but now electric, fighting, n ground is effective against it<br>  <br>  <br>  Overall, choose Chimchar, because it gets Fighting later, and n it is very useful in the Elite Four<br>  in battle tower, which you later will have access to, Infernape can be very power since it can learn Thunder Punch from egg moves,|`|AA12071039	Chimchar is the hard against first gym, but then much easier. Piplup is really easy too, and the steel typing offers great defense later in the game. Turtwig is hardest throughout game overall, and alot of people that choose him either quit or choose another Pokemon to raise over their starter.<br>  <br>  I say use Chimchar!|`|lOGhNHc7aa	I will go for the Piplup since water pokemon is very useful in this game.<br>  Also.... when you gets to Empoleon, you'll become a water/steel pokemon.<br>  <br>  USEFUL ~!|`|ooS8Gn1Uaa	All of them are good at some point you will struggle.... i chose Turtwig he is the best he also has cool moves|`|UmprLfONaa	I like em all, but chimchar is fast and is the most helpful.
zlxwwlVcaa	Simply depends on the car...My particular favorite one is Cousin Eddy's RV since it has good attack and defense.  Here's a tip: Before you go to fight Tower Tooth, make sure you have collected all the power ups from the other drivers you have killed in the previous rounds (max it out; defense, special weapon, etc.). But until you reach the level with Tower Tooth DON'T DIE since it takes quite a while to get them all back. Once you have collected all the power ups and reach Tower Tooth, SAVE YOUR GAME!!!! So that when you do die, you can just reload the game with all the upgrades intact. However, with the power ups it still takes quite a while so be patient :-)    As for your wireless connection problem, may'be it depends on the access point you are using. Does it have problems? Are you missing an important component like a WEP/WPA key? Or even if the signal is strong enough?|`|lJLwl0Wfaa	Just go in w/ a kick *** attitude and shoot till u die. Also look for health.

PG1LuEk5aa	just remember this i have done this and it has worked every time...    There is a system to slot machines....it doesn't matter if you put in 1 dollar or a 100...    There is something called the RNG...random number generator that is inside the slot machine....this causes payouts and how much of a payout the player gets...    The casino can tweak these as the owner wishes to adjust how much a certain machin pays out....    Casinos put higher odds of winning and bigger payouts in slot machines by certail things...    Slot machines by the cash out line always hit because people waiting in line are hearing the bells and flashing lights of the slot machines and want to keep on gambling....    Slot machines by escalators or elevators have higher chances of paying out....    The casino does this to lure people in...dont play a slot thats 100 yards from anything in the back corner of the casino....    My experience sayss that slot machines pay out most by the cash out line...because why cash in when you see those slots hitting....its all a big idea by the casino owener to either keep people playing or to have someone play thats going up the elevator or ecalator to their room...    Hope this helps and good luck....    Email me how you did,,,,    Xanthyppe@aol.com|`|zb9m72R8aa	No, your chances are very low,, less than 25% for sure. All though your grandmother is right, stick to one machine and unless you win, i would spend no more than $100|`|d97yNOPCaa	Your chance of winning over a long period on slot machines is very low.  Sticking to one machine or playing fifty different machines doesn't effect your chance of winning.  All slot machines are controlled by computer chips with random number generators.  It is possible to win every spin or lose every spin and each spin is a random chance.  In other words just because the last fifty spins were all losers the fifty-first spin has no better or worse chance of being a winner.  Playing only one machine is a superstition just like people that rub machine before they pull the lever or have a lucky troll they set on the machine.  I would recommend playing whatever games you think are fun.  You may like slot machines or maybe you will decide blackjack is more fun.  How much money just depends on how much you want to spend on entertainment.  For dollar slot you will probably need $400-$500 for the whole night.|`|HMHVgLdFaa	o rly?|`|FEb0qWoVaa	Very, very low. The odds are programmed in and they're programmed for you to lose.
432f9a03ef86ae8ea15283268639ddb8aa	I think that would look great - I think it's common for large blankets to be knitted in long sections then seamed together anyhow.  I've also seen some adorable "scrap" blankets where each square was a totally different yarn left over from many past projects - as long as all the squares add up (i.e. they are all 6" by 6" regardless of their actual gauge).|`|K7W4R8d6aa	OMG! Yes that would be just great! I've made a few like that and they turned out just great! One thing too is if you don't like the look of the "back" of the blanket you could find a great fabric and sew that onto the back! Just put right sides together, sew all around, but leave a 4in gap. Pull the blanket right side out and sew then sew up the gap. There you have two great sides! hope this helps!|`|DfIEgDbAaa	I sell my knitting and have sold several of these.  I usually do 6 squares across by 8 squares down & use a contrasting yarn to connect them.  I usually don't actually cast off but use a yaste yarn instead to hold the stitches live & pick them up when joining.|`|154dzJ1Faa	Oh yes, there are many ways to do blankets.  If you want to do it any particular way, then go ahead.  You are right on this one.    The reason you use the circular needles is because of the weight of the large knitting.  You wouldn't be able to hold up the work on straight needles.  Circular needles don't have all the weight on one spot and you can do larger pieces that way.  They are ideal for all of your knitting... there really is no need for straight needles.. or even double point, for that matter.  But it's whatever you get used to, I guess.|`|y02PZj22aa	The Warm Up America project involves 7" x 9" "squares" that are joined to make a blanket.  You could knit them all the same, all different, mix up patterns and yarns, and so on.  In addition, you can knit strips, rather than squares, and join them.    There are also patterns available for "sampler" afghans.      Take a look at this one:  http://www.knitting-and.com/knitting/pat...  Or this one:  http://www.lionbrand.com/patterns/kwe-pa...

Of course just different texture since it's knitted.|`|M9FQSKRwaa	what kind of circular needles are you working with?    certain brands are far heavier than others, you may want to switch to a different brand that is lighter.
ysiE6IDjaa	Okay. You will see all sorts of error messages like this if you play your game with the boolprop testing cheats continually on. They will have little meaning to you unless you are a modder or game developer.    The question is, why are you playing with the testing cheats on? You should use them very sparingly and only for specific tasks, and turn them off straight away when you have finished. Otherwise you run the risk of corrupting your game, perhaps permanently.     If you were actually using the testing cheats because you noticed a game error such as a jump bug, then you most likely have a piece of custom content (with a 'crappy' guid) that is incompatible with your game. Follow this guide to find it: http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...    If you do not have any problems with your game, there is absolutely no need to worry about the crappy guid message.|`|sWKGUPziaa	That is one of the stranger questions about Sims 2 I've even seen. Your Sim tells you you sent her a crappy code? Is it because you are trying to move her? Do you use a mouse with your game? I've never heard that one before. (Your game is for PC, right?) I would definitley try support.ea.com for this question (as well as here.) You can contact (write) them about the problem and they will get back to you by next day.

kIqq7yIAaa	sounds like the scabbard has mildewed    the blade can be wiped clean with a good cleaner  but check to see what the blade is made out of first  most swords today are stamped from stainless steel   if its not a polishing stone will remove any rust spots on the blade  once everything is gone a light coat of WD40 will keep any rust from returning  as for the scabbard you might need to use some sort of mildew remover safe for whatever the scabbard is made of  but be advised that if its wood or other porous material getting rid of mildew is nearly impossible without a long soak in bleach    now on to the dad issue  if you ask him about it and that you'd like to clean it and hang it on the wall he might not have any issue with you having it and could possibly give it to you depending on how old you are|`|432f9a03ef86ae8ea15283268639ddb8aa	Are you *sure* it's mold?

a379b587f6955c39c57180505a8d458eaa	It is considered a "rare" item so it will cost you a little bit. I wouldn't pay more than 15 bucks though.

What a pandora battery does is it lets you run programs off of it. So you'll need to put some programs that you download off the internet onto the battery. Once done, you run it and it'll hack the psp. Afterwards you MUST convert the pandora battery back to a regular battery or switch it if you have a pandora and a regular.    You play with a regular battery afterwards so it's only a 1 time use. Your downloaded games run from your memory stick.

Pro: It's really fun playing with your friends, watching movies, downloading demos and playing them before you buy the game. Mainly it's all about playing online with actual people. The day that Halo 2 came out I got it at midnight and jumped on live. I do that for most games now and to this day I still haven't beaten halo 2 single player.    It's all about testing your skills and improving them to beat other people. Really addicting.|`|DSiVyrwKaa	That depends on what kind of games you like to play. if you like First-person Shooters, absolutely get XBL. If you are more of a solitary gamer who likes adventure and RPG's, the main advantage is the downloadable content. Netflix is cool, but the streaming videos are pretty limited, with no new releases. You can join XBL month-to-month, which is only 8 bucks. For me it's totally worth it, but if you only like single player campaigns, skip it.

X9kNbpnQaa	1) If by "Forest" you mean the little green tree symbol (as seen in my link) then it adds one green mana to your mana pool. It does this in the exact same way as a forest would. The mana is actually generated/created from the card and put into your mana pool; there isn't a physical representation for it.     2) If two legendary creatures with the same name are on the field at once, both of them die.    3) Yes, they are virtually identical to normal creatures. The main difference is that if they die or are otherwise removed from play, they cease to exist. So you cannot return tokens to your hand.|`|bzfXbM4raa	Wow, I can't believe I know this answer, lol.  I use to play when I was much younger.  The tap one forest and get a mana...it comes out of nowhere actually.  If it's an artifact, you just tap the artifact, and you have an extra mana.    And yes, you can only have one legendary creature in play at one time.      And the place 4 1/1 creatures...I use to use coins, place the 4 coins on top of the card that says "place four 1/1 creatures"...this represents how many creatures I "potentially" have.  After each turn, I would take a token away, and add a creature into play (usually an upside down magic card)    Edit:  Usually the card that gives you that ability is an artifact.  So you take the artifact, and you instantly have one mana that you need to use for that turn.  The mana comes from the artifact.
f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	If you are interested in the movies and the workings of a studio then yes it is good.  However, if you have been to Universal Stuidos don't expect anything like that tour.  For one the tour goes around in small groups, about 12 people per guide.  This gives you the opportunity to ask questions occasionally.    Depending on the schedule you also have the opportunity to get out and walk around a few sets.  In addition to the sets the Prop Warehouse and Fabrication Shops were very interesting.    You have to remember that this is a Working Studio. So in order to even get on the tour you will need a government issued ID.  There will also be some points on the tour you will be restricted from taking photographs.|`|NCiVN4xRaa	If your talking about Warner Bros. Movie world than YES! It is awesome, but if you mean the studio, why not? And even if it isn't good you can still brag to your friends.|`|UMg1CL7baa	My dad works for warner brothers.  its really cool.
Z2EzfQFvaa	I don't know a link to a website with the info you want..but I know for a fact that the red/blue/yellow mew glitch does not work for firered and leafgreen.|`|LnYr2dLfaa	Mew is an Event Pokemon so that old cheat that works with the old Gameboy games doesn't work with the GBA versions (simply because technology has improved) so Mew can only be obtained by attending a Nintendo event.
ye9h5jXvaa	Twilight Princess isn't a direct sequel to a previous game. You could play it without ever playing a Zelda game before and you'd have no problem knowing what's going on. It's an original story, basically, with a new Link and Zelda who we haven't met before and a new Hyrule. It has nothing to do with Wind Waker, either.    Aside from the controls, there are a few slight differences between the GameCube and Wii versions but nothing major. The biggest difference is the entire game is flipped horizontally on Wii. Link is normally left-handed, as any Zelda fan should know, but people hold the Wii remote in their right hands mostly, so Nintendo flipped the game to mirror this. It doesn't really make any difference if you've never played the game before, but the Wii version feels strange to me. I prefer the Gamecube version. There also isn't the annoying fairy pointer on GameCube, but whichever version you get it's a fantastic game, so don't worry too much.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Twilight princess and Wind Waker both take place a century after OOT. They are seperate timelines. One is where ganondorf broke out of the sacred realm and the hero did not return. So to stop him Hyrule was flooded. The other is when Link returned as a child and told the Royal family about his treachery and Ganondorf was sentenced to execution. You know the rest. That is why the sages look the way they do. The original sages becuase of young links actions where ganondorf never took over hyrule therefore the sages that were awakened in OOC when Link was an adult never became sages.|`|X6WAOqZOaa	you can use the Gamecube controllers on the wii...  Twilight Princess is for the Gamecube as well  Timeline wise no one really knows...|`|9fbDfLZ0aa	I was thinking about getting twilight princess for the Wii, but after I saw those ridiculous bows, I couldn't bring myself to do it... we are talking major nerdage here.|`|d55yQJAWaa	"But I never play Wind waker cause it looked gay"  You are a ******* retard.  Die.
687b43LPaa	Each Legend Of Zelda game has a different Link(Main character) that continues off a different time line(apart from PH, which directly continues off of WW).     It's also generally assumed that there is a split time line after the events of OoT such as the adult time line and child time line.(as seen here- http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Image:Split_...    Anyway more info can be found at http://zelda.wikia.com/    The only difference between the GameCube version and Wii version is that the Wii version is mirrored, which explains why Link is right-handed in the Wii version. Also WW is in fact a good game, despite it's style.
e3LzkOvGaa	You cant return a new game thats already open    If it was a used game you would get store credit|`|uctxzjIIaa	Nope. It is against the Digital Millenium Copyright Act for a store to accept a return on opened software and give you anything other than another copy of the same piece of software (to cover instances of a defective disk). Best Gamestop can do is let you trade it in used, which will likely only get you about 40% of what you paid for it (adn whatever it is, they take another 20% off on top of that if you insist on taking cash instead of store credit).|`|d889ec36bb9adc89f3addb3dde100e23aa	sounds like you opened it, so i believe you get mabye 5 or 6 dollars subtracted from a full refund|`|Nsj6wg1maa	um you can say its a defect. also they will only give you store credit as full refund if you want cash they deduct 20% (i think i know they deduct)/
5r6xSlbPaa	Yes. As long as your video card is GMA 3000 or above intel mobile your fine. That entails the GMA X4500 the X3100, the X3500 and the X500. I am almost positive you can run it, post your computer model if you want a definitive answer.|`|av2ut7Xmaa	I'm not sure you should just wait to it comes out on this site.    http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/ref...    It will tell you how well your computer runs it|`|Dso7k3sjaa	According to this chart:    http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...    Your card will not play Bon Voyage, Free Time or Apartment Life.  The chart doesn't have Mansions & Gardens included in it because the chart was made before EA released Mansions and Gardens.  Although at the bottom of the page (right above the requirements for a Mac) they have added some stats about Mansions & Gardens.  Oh, and Mansions Gardens is actually labeled as EP9 if you install it, even though EA is calling it a stuff pack, it is actually considered an expansion pack.    I do know that there have to be at least 20 to 30 questions on this site alone where people have the X3100 card and cannot get their games to play.  If you look at the chart, you can see why.  Many of them have bought The Sims 2 Double Deluxe, which includes the Celebrations stuff pack.  Celebrations is SP4 and if you take a look at the chart, the X3100 card cannot play SP4.  I realize that you stated a better card than the X3100, but I'm only trying to point out that you cannot believe EA's minimum requirements.    So, even though the others don't agree with me, in my opinion your computer is not going to be able to play The Sims 3.  EA may say those are the minimum requirements, just as they claim some minimum requirements for their Sims 2 games which actually do not successfully play the sims 2 games.  EA is a money hungry corporation which, so far at least, has proven to not care much about their customers.  They state lower requirements than actually necessary to sell as many games as possible to as many people as possible.    But in the end, it's up to you of course.  Best of luck!    **Oh, and if you actually are playing the games that it says your card cannot play, then I guess simply ignore this advice.  I can only go by what I can find for info on the net, I only have one PC so therefore cannot actually test out these findings.  I have no way of knowing whether they are accurate for sure or not.**    Here is another website that tests video cards for performance:    http://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Graph...    If you scroll down, you can see that they tested it with certain games, although not any of the sims 2 games.  Thought this might help though.

Cl2is5hYaa	I don't recall ever seeing an aspiration to die, but I have seen to be saved from death, in which case a loved one has to plead with the Grim Reaper to spare their life.  With that, the dying sim just has to be careless and not taken good care of (low on all needs).  There are tons of ways for a sim to die at that point: drowning in a pool, struck by lightning, hit by a satellite while watching the clouds, etc.    Now if you just want to kill a sim off outright, you can always open the cheat window (Ctrl+Shift+C), type in "boolprop testingcheatsenabled true" (without the quotes), Shift+click on your sim, select "Spawn..." and there should be a couple death tools (Tombstone of L and D is one, and I can't remember the name of the other).  Then just interact with the tombstone that's created and there should be all the ways for a sim to die.  Just be sure, when you're done, to turn off the cheat by entering "false" instead of "true," else you can do a lot of damage to the game.    EDIT: I've never tried combining the two (using a tombstone to kill a sim, then having another sim save them from death), so I have no idea if they work together or not.  But regardless, to be saved from death, another sim just has to interact with the Grim Reaper once he arrives (and again, there are tons of ways for a sim to die, which will happen if their needs are all red).  There then should be an option to plead for life or something like that (I've only ever done it once, so the exact details elude my memory).|`|D2GiPPjTaa	If it's the PC, use the Boolprop cheat, click on your Sims then you must do something like...

AA11001595	I've been to Foxwoods, MGM, and Mohegan Sun recently (3 of the largest casinos in the world, all located in Connecticut).    From what I've seen and heard, they're all still doing well, but still losing business, either having layoffs or not hiring new people when people decide to leave.    Before at times when they may have had all wings of the casino open, now they may have almost all of them open.    Slot revenue is down as well, and the promotions just to get people in the door are way better as a way to get them to come at all.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	The casino I deal at has taken a noticeable hit.   Take last Saturday night for example.   Most Saturdays,  all the tables are open,   and packed,  with relatively high minimum bets.    Last weekend,  with low minimums,  and we had 1/3 of the tables closed (I rarely dealt to a full table in an 8 hour shift).  You could also shoot cannons down the slot machine aisles and likely not hit anyone.    What ive noticed are the high rollers are coming (less frequently,  but there),   the problem gamblers are still there (though are likely getting hit harder).   The ones that have stopped coming are joe paycheque,   who used to spend a night playing Blackjack with his wife or poker with his buddies,  who are instead holding poker night at home.|`|WxmNSxNGaa	The casinos in Las Vegas and across Nevada are getting creamed right now.

ni4YME93aa	Vegas has been hit extremely hard with this economy.  A lot of people who work in large casino's outside of Vegas will tell you that people are still gambling, but tipping and amount bet has gone down.     It appears that no one, not even the casinos, are safe in this economy.
S1oEZbaRaa	The answer is, they leeched.  If you don't know what leeching is, leeching is when you hang on a rope/ladder or sit in a safe spot, while a 4th job Mage kills in a map using their full screen attack.  Leeching is quite popular lately, but expensive.  Some people used their mains to leech though (different account and computer, but same owner)  Hope I helped :D|`|6ss6vuopaa	I don't actually play the game but based on this part of your question:    "The pirate class came out YESTERDAY for Gms"    I'm guessing that since their GM's they have the ability to click a button and level up.
AuvMZYTSaa	Depends    There are claims of people finding Pre-embargo tobacco leaf thru the years.  Whether you believe that is true or not is up to you, but the chances of finding a bale or two of leaf still in good condition after 40 some years - I dunno......    There are only a few cigar makers that claim to use pre-embrgo cuban leaf - Camacho in their Liberty series, Pinar has several different blends, Havana Blends and Havana Slims.  The latter are thin ringed (30) and claim 100% cuban filler and run about $50 a box of 50, so that is what I suspect you might have.    Whether they are 'for real' is anyone's guess

Z1FYjWmJaa	You wouldn't have the best experience playing with those specs. The processor, while old, isn't your main bottle neck. I would strongly suggest putting another gig of ram in your system. As far as video cards, I'm guessing you have an hp/dell/gateway system, in which case you likely have an integrated graphics chip. (These "graphics cards" siphon memory from your ram to run graphics.) Depending on what type of graphics slot you have (pci, agp, pci express) you can find a decent graphics card for around 80 or so dollars. Combine that with another 20 or so for ram (if purchased at a site like newegg.com), and you have a system that would run the game at a decent level of graphics without too much lag.|`|mb7h0wDJaa	alright u have 2 go to this website before u buy a game alqays check here to see if you're computer can run any games    click this link:http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/ref...|`|AA11573023	Well, it all depends on your video card.

And then cut vellum (that translucent type of paper) a little smaller than the main design. -write/type the message on the vellum.  The position the two parts where it looks like the design sheet is like a "border" for the clear sheet and punch two holes through both of them (about 1/2 inch apart from each other) in the middle near the top. Then with that done, take some ribbon and make a bow by putting it through the two hole punches.    --It's pretty easy and it would look cute when it's finished|`|QgIy1xOFaa	I saw a cute idea using the pop top tab from a soda can.

AA11850311	does your message actually say "failed to locate DirectX compatible graphics adapter"?  That usually means that your graphics adapter, also known as a video or graphics card, cannot handle all the 3D effects that Sims2 has.  Make sure that you do have the latest version of DirectX, and that you also have the latest drivers for you graphics card.  Sometimes updating those 2 things will correct the problem you are having.  If after you get both those updates, you still have that error, then your computer just cannot handle Sims2, and if you really want to play, you will need to get a better graphics card.

5r6xSlbPaa	read this?    Brightwood Demon Door    To get through this Demon Door you have to go through a series of tasks involving cheese, haircuts and some more things I dont know about Seeing as I cant get past the second stage due to not knowing where to get the Braids haircut.    First task is to bring it cheese this is the easiest part since most produce traders sell food like the one near the furniture store in Bowerstone market, the next stage is to get a certain beard style and haircut these being:       1. The Mutton Chop Beard which is sold in Bowerstone     2. The Dreadlocks Haircut which is sold in Bloodstone (info curtesy of Bubbah)    The next task is to put on the uniform of the cheese bearer this is:       1. The Tart Skirt sold in Bloodstone     2. The Yokel Hat sold in Oakfield     3. The Nobel Gents Shirt sold in Bowerstone and most other clothing stores    And then you have to click the A button a few times and hell let you in! Finally.

8vIiBt9qaa	The only way I know how is if you are playing online.    Do it the time consuming way: Level 12 keep grinding in the tombs or Arcane Sanctum till 20. Do ancients at 20 to 21 and cow until 24. After 24 do Baal runs until 40 or 44 ish and do Nightmare. Nightmare baal runs until 70 and then Hell.    Quick but hard way: Chaos Run Glitch. Have someone who needs the quest for Baal and Have killed ancients make a game. You stay in town at act 5 and party up with them. You must have not completed ancients since you are level 12 but you should get baal done, then you can go to Nightmare. Quest up until Act 5 and do the same, going into Hell now. After you've reached hell have someone run you through the Chaos place where diablo is and you'll gain a lot of exp, maybe 5 or 6 levels a run.

GL|`|wUkU3HVwaa	www.888.com|`|YEooEeKGaa	most online casinos operate their accounts using US$ but you should be able to deposit using the aussie.

They offer a 200% blackjack bonus. Play with basic strategy and the bonus and you'll be able to have a pretty good chance at beating the house.     good luck mate!

Here's the link, just scroll down and click on auto install.    http://www.modthesims2.com/download.php?...  Next you need a unzip utility tool. I like jzip. (7zip will also work too.) I like jzip because it is free, can open rar. and zip. files and is easy to use. In order to use jzip or 7zip, you just have to download it, then right click on the download you want to open and click on Open.Then put your downloads files in Documents/EA Games/ Sims 2/ Downloads.) The thing is  with Raonsims downloads is that you have to be sure to download the mesh that goes with the hairstyle. It is on the same site, different page. It is really important to fully read the pages that your downloads are on, in case they need anything such as meshes, to be put in certain files to work; etc. This is your first time downloading? Just make sure that with whatever unzip utility tool you use that your downloads (custom content goes into Documents/EA Games/Sims2/Downloads folder. You can make one if there isn't one already there. Your custom content should show up in your game then. Also, here is a link in case you get stuck:  http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...

HYly0RE1aa	In all honesty, I think if your a real serious gamer who likes every type of game, I would suggest the 360. Not only are the graphics twice as good, but it's options in endless games keeps growing. For example, all the most popular games such as: Halo, Fable, Call of Duty, etc..all really go for the 360. Sports games alone look so much more intense, and are so much more fun then the Wii. If your one of those family gamers, the Wii is your system, because in my opinion, it's ment for younger kids, as well as a family. None of the hard-core blood and guts kind of games are for the Wii.  Now if your looking for games "LIKE" Zelda and such, the Nintendo is like the creator of those types of games. Although, the 360 has many RPG's as well, i.e Oblivion, Fallout 3 etc.   So again, I would for sure go with the 360. Its easy and simple, as well as the most popular gaming system there is today.  Hope you find what your looking for, and good luck.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	If you want to play realistic sports games, then get the 360.  Most of the sports games (wrestling included) on the Wii got less content or just plain sucks.    If you want to play arcade sports games, then stay with the Wii.    The 360 has Tales of Vesperia.|`|FkVMOTZtaa	if you want a GOOD game system id say go for PS3 or 360, the wii is just a joke i honestly dont see why ANYBODY would want one unless they are mentally....challenged.|`|JesF97Hqaa	i just got the wii and its asome but unless ur with friends its not very fun after a while i had it for two weeks already bored with it unless with friends  plus xbox 360 has more sports games

oNbxlJEQaa	You can keep both. When you download a client for a private server, it's actually a small 3-6 Mb .exe file. You put the file into the maplestory folder that you originally got when you downloaded the game. Then, using the small file, when you launch it the game will run, but connected to the private server. When you want to go back to normal maple, simply move the .exe file out of the maplestory folder and start maple as normal. Place it in and out as you wish.|`|s3nfLTfcaa	no it doesnt get rid of it itz always there but i suggest www.sydneyms.org

Madden and NBA 2K are always fun to me.|`|KnXwXw4Raa	its just you|`|aLzymSxraa	Fun is anywhere you want it to be. When you are playing the games that bore you, restrain yourself or purposefully use a method that you know will fail you. Until you have mastered the game fully, THEN YOU ARE NOT DONE!    As for multiplayer, don't just play the same crap over and over. Live it up! switch up the game settings. Do things that don't make any sense. USE YOUR IMAGINATION!!! If all else fails, think of ways to grief other players so even when you aren't having fun playing the game, your having fun in making others miserable!    don't give up on videogames yet!|`|Vy33yWR5aa	Well, some games can get a little repetitive. Also, with video games being out for more than 30 years, game designers may be running out of ideas for games. What you could do is if you play a certain genre and if you're bored of it then you could always play a different genre. I play FPS a lot and I got bored of them. I recently picked up Dragonball Z: Burst Limit and found myself having a lot of fun. Try switching up games. Then go back to the game that you may have found boring.
S8BCApc5aa	I certainly don't. It is the most incredibly boring game show I have seen in years. I even like Howie Mandel, but I don't get it at all.    Those who I've talked to who like the show say that they like the simplicity, the wacky personalities, and the suspense on the show. Again, I don't agree - if you want simplicity, wacky personalities, and suspense, just watch a DNA test episode of Maury Povich's show, but I guess there are people who just enjoy mindless entertainment.|`|KtqIIFSbaa	lmfao.  i was so wondering that SAME thing like..... a week ago.

P1yr6HT0aa	The ABOUT page reads:  You may be wondering who's behind this Web site and what our motivation is. Well, this Web site and the Above the Influence ads you see on TV and in magazines are created for the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign (a program of the Office of National Drug Control Policy). This campaign reflects what teens across the country have told us is going on in their lives.  [from: http://www.abovetheinfluence.com/about.a...    A search on the Office of National Drug Control Policy shows this:  About  The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), a component of the Executive Office of the President, was established by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.    The principal purpose of ONDCP is to establish policies, priorities, and objectives for the Nation's drug control program. The goals of the program are to reduce illicit drug use, manufacturing, and trafficking, drug-related crime and violence, and drug-related health consequences. To achieve these goals, the Director of ONDCP is charged with producing the National Drug Control Strategy. The Strategy directs the Nation's anti-drug efforts and establishes a program, a budget, and guidelines for cooperation among Federal, State, and local entities.    By law, the Director of ONDCP also evaluates, coordinates, and oversees both the international and domestic anti-drug efforts of executive branch agencies and ensures that such efforts sustain and complement State and local anti-drug activities. The Director advises the President regarding changes in the organization, management, budgeting, and personnel of Federal Agencies that could affect the Nation's anti-drug efforts; and regarding Federal agency compliance with their obligations under the Strategy.  [from http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/abou...|`|YM6MrT8Xaa	I don't actually know, I'd assume its another government ad campaign to stop Marijuana.     On the other hand because its on game sites, it might be sponsored by Colombian Drug Lords trying to push people past Marijuana and straight to Cocaine because it, like energy drinks, gives you energy to game longer.    Take your pick, it could be any organization.|`|Ac2vZXDJaa	y r u lookin to assassinate the leader lol|`|6x7vrBn9aa	the white house office of national drug control policy funds it. part of the youth anti-drug campaign. unbelievable.|`|6t76bgS3aa	i'm pretty sure it's the government ... not that i'm advocating marijuana or anything
d889ec36bb9adc89f3addb3dde100e23aa	I just got it, it's pretty neat.    It's a first person medieval game.    you can fight with swords, shoot a bow & arrow, or use magic.    it's really neat in that the environment plays an important role in fights    ex. your first kill requires you to kick someone down a pit, and then jump down after him and stab him, then you kick someone into a wall of spikes after dropping crates on him
hlOawARXaa	$19.50 is expensive they are only $12.00 where I'm at, I buy them for my little brother. Anyways, doesnt your account expire if you dont buy a new one? I think thats right, just tell her that you need one because its time for it to expire and to keep it your have to "adopt" a new pet.    Edit: well, have you told her you would pay for it yourself?    For some reason everytime I try to email you it wont send, but heres what I was saying in the email...on the webkinz website it has a store locator on it, maybe you could check it if you haven't there may be a store near you that you dont even know sells webkinz

T40ZH7Tvaa	If you have Xbox live silver you can actually download a demo for fable 2 which could be useful in deciding if you want it or not. However im not sure about there being a cod 5 demo. Maybe you could try playing both games at friends houses to see which one you fancy more?    if it was up to me i would get cod5 because of online. it can last much longer than fable 2 because once u beat fable 2 thats it.. With cod5 you can just keep on playing and its a great game to vs friends in..    Good luck|`|UDoW2tT7aa	I absolutely love rpgs but Fable 2 is just to slow for me I constantly find myself having to wait for stuff to happen. With Call of Duty 5, I can go around and kill people, so you should definitely get COD5.|`|XBiTPQCeaa	As far as i am concerned and from the pt. of view of action,multiplayer,graphics etc, i will advice u to buy call of duty5.  Its not that the fable2 is not interesting ,infact i have just completed fable2:the lost chapters but the level of intensity and real world graphics(which are required in actions games) and advanced weapeonary can only be found in cod5.|`|OaAIN6Rcaa	I think COD 4 is actually better then COD 5  so id go for fable 2|`|J3BJhdLKaa	I suggest buy CoD5 and fable 2. U will get surprised when u had finish the game, hehehe.. But u can play multiplayer with cod    Fable is good if u one to become pood or evil, like sims, but with little slash and spell|`|39O0l8tVaa	Fable II, it is a great game with lots and lots to do, also it DOES have multiplayer co-op so you can play with a friend over Xbox Live, which is very fun.    COD5 is alright but I had more fun with COD4, between the two I think you'll have more fun playing around with the both linear and non-linear things in Fable.    Good luck.|`|L6BOtQ6haa	Both are garbage. I would get Fable II if I were you though, its like fable 1 just a fair bit better. Still not perfect tho|`|ZiMkydtHaa	ya should get cod 5
Ul2QmEv2aa	1)GTA III worst because the only thing you can do is missions but the missions ar good though but the bad thing is there is no mini game like in other GTA game and no good features.  2)GTA Vice city is good because the story is more interesting and there's this feature that you can get an assets/business that give you money and some other stuff.  3)GTA san Andreas is better because the story is better and interesting and it is all about the hoods, gang war feature that allows you to take over the other enemy territories some mini game like dancing and low riding and other good stuff  4)GTA IV is the best because of its graphic and city is great the story i good too and there's a lots of feature, that includes  friendship and the game is realistic and you can do multiplayer too.|`|DCP2GJDZaa	GTA San andreas - Just awesome you could do loads and i liked the gang wars  GTA lll - it was revolutionary had alot of fun on it and at the time was the                                       best thing since sliced bread  GTA Vice City- quite average and no planes which were disappointing  GTA lV - very disappointing, didn't live to to the 1 before by a long shot and waaayyyy too serious especially with your cousin ringing up for a date every 5 minutes. pains in the ***|`|DfPyyDssaa	GTA San Andreas  GTA 4  GTA Vice City  Gta III.

Sometimes whole neighbourhoods have been known to disappear after people do this!

2oHo3nyGaa	***IT IS A SCAM!!!*** RED FLAG! SKULL AND CROSSBONES!    The mail you received is not really from Yahoo, but from an online scammer who preys on people's gullibility. It's a phishing attempt, aimed at stealing your identity, using your information to raid your bank account, or other illicit purposes.    But the primary purpose is to lead the target into believing that the contest is legitimate and they have an actual prize waiting for them. Once the scammer has them, they then hit the target with all sorts of fees and charges for various things like customs and seals of approval, and they will never end. Some victims get milked for thousands of dollars. They will ask all transactions to be made via Western Union, and will usually use free e-mail services like Yahoo, Hotmail, or G-Mail, almost always in a foreign country. A good giveaway is a poor command of spelling and grammar, or the English language in general.    The main hole in this scam is that it is usually under the guise of an overseas lottery. It is illegal to hold an overseas lottery, and you must be in the country in which the lottery is held in order to participate in it. Also, if you actually did win it, they would contact you via more conventional means such as a telephone call. They would not contact you through e-mail as it is too impersonal.    Follow these steps:    1.) DO NOT send the person any information, documents, money, or photographs. They can use these things to commit identity theft. Do not even entertain them with any kind of response.    2.) Report the letter to Yahoo and your local police department. There is also a section of either the FBI or DOJ websites that allow you to turn in scam e-mails. Keep a copy of the letter for your records if you so choose, or just delete it.    3.) No matter what story they give you, NEVER believe a word they say, and never feel sorry for them. These people are thieves and they have caused a lot of suffering for many people.     4.) Avoid dispensing your e-mail address or cell phone number to a person or entity you are not sure of, such as contest entries at the mall where you could win a car. The companies that hold those contests will share or sell people's addresses to 3rd parties that will spam your mailbox. Only give your e-mail address to people you trust, and to legitimate entities (your school, state and federal agencies, Yahoo, MySpace, PayPal, etc.) that will keep your information confidential.    The suffering and hardship of a "rich" Westerner is nothing to these people. All they want is money, and they will kidnap and kill for it if they get the opportunity. It's happened before.    I recommend you visit the following websites, as they educated me greatly:    www.ebolamonkeyman.com  419.bittenus.com    I REPEAT, IT'S A SCAM!! IT IS NOT REAL! THERE IS NO YAHOO LOTTERY AND NO MONEY!     I do apologize if you're disappointed, but if you fall for this, you could end losing a lot more than just money.

I have some missions that have bonus only completed and some with mission only.   Some bonuses though require you to complete the mission in order to trigger.    Factions missions are timed.  Receiving Masters (the equivalent of getting the bonus) on the mission requires you to finish the missin within a time limit.    Nightfall missions are varied. Each one has a different requirement for masters but all require you to finish the mission before giving you a Standard/Expert/Masters score.

Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep, which is coming out this Fall (I think) and There's 358/2 Days for the Nindendo DS, which is supposed to be coming out during the Summer, and last there is Kingdom Hearts Coded, I don't know much about this game, except that you play it on your cell phone.

I haven't heard of an actual Kingdom Hearts 3 yet, so I'd say forget about it for a while, It'll be worth the wait :)|`|uhzsB39taa	i have finished both kingdom hearts 1 and 2. i just wish they would anounce a release date already. i heard a rumur it was coming out is late august early september.|`|Se6ikPhTaa	Kingdom Hearts 3: the Keyblade Wars, hasn't been officially announced yet. but there are a few trailers on youtube.|`|XFlb3zlSaa	I can answer this question perfectly for you. kh 3 won't be out for 2 more years maybe. they are currently working on 3 new kingdom hearts games. they've been working on these since part 2 was released. there is one for the cell phone which is called kingdom hearts coded. one for the psp called kingdom hearts birth by sleep and finally for the ds kindgom hearts 358/2 days. kingdom hearts coded is already out on the cell phone. kingdom hearts 358/2 days is expected in america later this year. and same for the psp birth by sleep. i believe they are already working on kh3 but not fully since they are occupied with these 3 games. go to this website khinsider.com. they have all the information you need on these 3 games. you can even go on youtube and look up those titles. they will have japanese trailers for them. hope all of this helps|`|ncCWnApDaa	Can't wait for it either, unfortunately nothing has been confirmed about it at all, the next KH releases are all handheld games, chances are they haven't even begun work on KH3 yet, Square-Enix are extremely delayed with other projects most notably the Final Fantasy 13 games as well as Crystal Bearers and Dragon Quest 9, all have been in development for years now, I would be very surprised if KH3 was released any earlier than 2011 to be honest, but even that's being optimistic.|`|jK7pklCKaa	It hasnt even been announced yet, the only kingdom hearts games announced at the moment are for the PSP and DS and should be out early this year.

Try lowering the screen resolution, it does help every once in a while. And compatibility mode isn't always compatible..    Nice specs by the way!

You need to keep a good rapor with Neopets though so that yo can be reimbursed. Read the terms and conditions of the premium account to refer to in your emails too.

oTzFnMMPaa	You have to tell the other person before hand before going online. So, set up a date with them. And, go online on that day and time, and wait for them. I don't think there are any rules. Unless you both make it up so it would be fair.

226fxFFSaa	troll and faceless void are good partners....    if you use troll try to have to orb effect items such as desolator which has minus armor + vladmir offerings which has lifestealing aura it would be good if you will use melee type troll to have the stun effect of it....+quirrass(sorry i dont know the how to spell it but i know you could understand it) for another minus armor to enemy and plus armor to self and ally and other items for movementspeed, ETC....      Faceless Void and Troll Warlord are good for stunnig also use butterfly for fast attack and evasion...      for faceless void try to have a helm of dominator for early game(starting game to have greater lifesteal...) and maybe eye of skadi for slow effect so the enemy could not escape when running, also have cranium basher for stunning,power treads for movementspeed, ETC....

avhgLEu8aa	The only way to make an electric car faster is to replace the motor with a faster one, and if you do that you might have to replace the Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) depending on if the standard one can handle the modified motor.  What you're looking for is a motor with fewer turns. The one in the Stampede is a 12 turn motor, so if you go for an 11 or 10 turn motor in your Duratrax and make sure the ESC can handle it, you will blow it away.

rSTbz34caa	Kevin Pietersen of England has a base value of $ 1.3 million.    That means when the 8 teams meet to bid for the players, Pietersen's price will start from 1.3 million.    If he is bought for more than 1.5 million, he will become the most expensive cricketer in the world (surpassing M.S.Dhoni)    Conclusion- Kevin Pietersen will get a minimum of 1.3 million $s for participating in the IPL.|`|pOrwteQUaa	This post has been moved or deleted.
