If your making backup/copy/clone images (which is really why you would even have ghost), depending on how much stuff you have on your computer, can be 4-7GB PER IMAGE.  Dont forget to have the images saved on another hard drive or at least another partition.  I would recommend at least a 20GB drive/partition for saving the images/future backups, depends on how many images your planning on making.  You have to watch the minimum system requirment thing, yeah the application will run but can you do anything with it at those specs.?  Hope this helps.|`|a444ce229ba6f8866c092b8c43fef18caa	The minimum required is 160mb++ so if your hard disk meets the requirement, it's ok already.

mLlQC92Laa	Most G adapters are backwards compatable meaning they will work on non G networks it just won't connect as fast to a slower network like on a B and it won't go as fast as an N. A-networks are not really in existence in homes. The most common is B being older and slower, G being newer than B and faster but older than N and slower. N is the newest and fastest network connection to date and is still new. I am assuming you have a B network and want to know if your G adapter will work and the answer is yes but the G adapter will only go as fast as the B network will allow. B networks have a small bandwidth so you G adapter will not be working at it fullest potential.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	It'll work fine on a A/B/N router (as long as you don't have it set to N only), it'll work on a B router, it'll work on an N router, it won't work on an A router (wrong frequency).|`|AA11298562	You know where to find a wireless A network??

When Windows hibernates it dumps the entire contents of the RAM to disk and powers down the entire machine. On startup it quickly reloads the data. It allows the system to be completely powered off while in hibernate mode. This requires a file the size of the installed RAM to be placed in the system's root directory, using up space even when not in hibernate mode. Hibernate mode is enabled by default and can be disabled in order to recover this disk space.  Schmed
70bb67d6a9bbf04ead4fca82eb3b7559aa	777 - The connection attempt failed because the modem (or other connecting device) on the remote computer is out of order.    This error cannot occur with Windows 95/98 or NT - only with Windows Me or 2K.    This error can occur if you have installed your modem with an incorrect driver. Identify your modem chipset, PCI ID, manufacturer, and make sure you are using the correct driver.    If you get this error, the modem or DUNS may not be installed or set-up properly. See if you can talk to your modem with Hyperterminal setup as described here - if you can, inspect/re-install DUNs; if you cannot, the modem needs to be re-installed. In some cases, a simple cold-boot (shut down - power off - re-start) may solve the problem.    This error may also occur if the number you are dialing is blacklisted.    Many PCI modems include an entry in Windows' ADD/REMOVE PROGRAMS (from Control Panel or System): it is important to remove any installed modems using this remove function to properly update the registry. In some cases where the modem has been installed more than once with different driver versions without proper removal, the registry may be corrupted: if this is the case, only manual editing, restore from backup, or re-installation of Windows may cure the trouble.    Also note: In many cases, PCI modems will not operate in all of your PCI slots|`|a444ce229ba6f8866c092b8c43fef18caa	Unplug and replug your modem again. re-install the driver if necessary, if the problem persist, contact singnet customer services.

I've looked everywhere for cheats to get quick money as its hard in the full version, but with no luck at all, theres lots of proposed cheats but none work, not even cheatomatic!  Hope this helps|`|AA11284203	Step by step guide to get started successfully:  Drop the starter eggs into Tank 1. Go to the supplies area and buy some common eggs for $160. Drop them into Tank 1 and wait for them to hatch. If you want them to grow up quickly, you can set the game speed to fast, but you'll have to check your fish often to make sure that they are fed. They will grow up in less than 2 hours.     Once they are adults, try to find two fish EXACTLY the same. You can breed them successfully. Their babies will not lose health and die. If you can't find two fish exactly alike, choose two fish that are very similar (the same type of fish - for example Spotanus or Beta). If you breed these, even though their fins might be different, they will probably live to be adults. If you don't get any fish similar enough to breed successfully, you can always start a new game and try again. It's important not to cross breed species early in the game, because they will die and you won't have any money to buy more eggs.    If any of your fish get sick early in the game, you should probably not spend money on medicine until you have extra money. Once your new fish are grown up, you should move them to the selling tank (Tank $), and click the Sell Fish button. You will see the store screen. When a customer buys one of your fish the species, picture and price of that fish will be displayed in the information area below the store.    Keep breeding fish as described above until you have enough money to buy a second tank. Tank 2 will give you more room to breed fish and you will make money faster. Drag some of your fish to Tank 2 and keep breeding the same fish to make enough money to research tank improvements.    Remember to keep making money by breeding fish and selling them. Once you have made enough money to research Fish Environment, you will be able to breed more expensive species of fish.    Magic Fish Combos:     1.

dc60ff3b5aa807768088e0759e3df6b5aa	Hello,    The answer depends a great deal upon which browser (are we talking Internet Explorer, FireFox, Opera,etc,etc) and it also depends upon which operating system your running it on (which version of Windows, or Linux, or MAC OS).    **In the past the early web browsers were installed as a seperate feature from MS Windows but since (I think?) Windows 2000 & XP the web browser has been woven into the OS by Microsoft so its nolonger seperate.    **So you might not be able to un-install it and then re-install it which in the past was the prefered method to fix your kind of problem.     However, now your best option would be to download a fresh copy of the browser & attempt to re-install over the top of the old one. Why? because any damaged or missing files will be replaced (if missing) or over written with undamaged versions of the older files. The end result should be a working web browser.    **If you re-install the browser, the installation may even allow you the option of a "repair" and if that is avialable try selecting that first.    Hope thats helpful?    IR|`|53fc74462caf8d54d0c3489b37caa159aa	easiest way is to start again.

Un blog es mucho ms fcil de actualizar, tanto como escribir un correo electrnico.  Adems, tens que tener en cuenta que un blog tiene mucha ms presencia en los buscadores que una pgina web, ya que cada nuevo artculo que escribis es como una nueva pgina.   Por ejemplo, yo tengo un blog en el que ya he escrito ms de 600 anotaciones y cada una de ellas aparece en Google u otros buscadores como una pgina web distinta. En otras palabras, tens muchas ms posibilidades de que los buscadores te encuentren y que lleguen ms visitas a tu pgina.  Y si es de Blogger mucho mejor, ya que las URL son mucho ms accesibles para los buscadores que las de los blogs de Yahoo y de MSN.

AA12001365	It is usually good practice to set your DVD-ROM drive as the Secondary Master if possible. This means that your primary hard-disk drive should be connected to the IDE-1 (or IDE-0) port on your motherboard while your DVD-ROM should be connected using a separate cable to the IDE-2 (or IDE-1) port on your motherboard. You might also need to set the drive as a master by altering some jumpers on the back, please consult your instruction manual for more details.|`|AA12048646	.  You should have a SYSTEM ribbon inside to which you should have your hard drive connected.  The system ribbon should have 2 plugs.    If you have two hard drives:  The "master",   [first]  on the sytem ribbon > should be the one with your operating system.  Any second hard drive (used mostly for storage)  would be the "slave" (or second) on the SYSTEM ribbon.    There "should be" another ribbon available to   plug in your DVD drive,   (and also a CD drive, in case you want to keep both).    >>>It works to keep the CD drive as secondary on that ribbon,   in case you want to leave a CD in all the time to access items stored on a CD  like photos or a game you play very often.      If you only have one ribbon inside your pc  then the hard drive that has your Operating System  should be first in line (master)  and the DVD drive should be second in line (slave).    Other ribbons inside the pc case can be for a Floppy drive, or other.    After you have each of your drives plugged in to their correct ribbons, at start-up each will be assigned a consecutive drive letter in order of importance.  You can view these in your Explore tree.  RIGHT click START > left click Explore  scroll down the left panel of the Explore window to view drive letters for each of your drives.      You may purchase additonal ribbons at any computer hardware seller, making sure to get the right number of pin slots in the plug-in, and first make sure you have a slot on the motherboard to attach to.  h2h|`|KBm5SPhXaa	doesnt really matter for cd/dvd, how many drives do u have?

This is the primary drive that you will be using most of the time, although it doesn't really matter.  If you have more than one drive, set one to Master and the other to Slave.  It doesn't really matter which one.  Your computer should be able to tell which drive is which anyway.  If you are going to have only the one drive, it needs to be set on Master.  Anything else, and your computer won't be able to read the drive at all until you fix it.|`|AA10504822	It depends.

It really doesnt make a lot of difference.|`|XgKukevNaa	Depends. Master is if you have No other cd-dvd drives and that is the one you will be using..   Slave, is if you have 1 more and want this one to backup. Like a hard drive, You got 1 hard drive and your other computer broke, so you want to transfer files to a disk, you install the hard drive in a working computer install as slave meaning it is temperary.  Cable, I dont know what that is. Maybe you want to run a cable to the computer.??    Any Questions,  Billy Rowe

6e510936fc73a7fbf0c17cecd7c786f4aa	Em primeiro lugar: Existe sim como camuflar IPs. Isso se deve a uma falha na concep??o do protocolo TCP/IP, e a tcnica se chama spoofing. Isso  antigo, mas muito complexo de usar.    Em segundo: Hacker n?o  um pentelho que rouba sua senha do msn. O conceito hacker foi mal utilizado pela mdia nos anos 90 por causa de grandes invasores digitais como o Kevin Mitnick. At hoje a palavra  usada de maneira incorreta.    Hacker quer dizer estudioso e dedicado. Algum que gosta de saber cada vez mais sobre o que faz, e  extremamente dedicado ao que faz.    Cracker  o nome de uma pessoa, Hacker ou n?o, que gosta de infernizar os outros no mundo digital, seja atravs de falhas no sistema ou por 171 ("engenharia social").    Invadir significa violar. Se voc estivesse buscando uma tcnica de spoofing - para ter mais privacidade - talvez tivesse mais abertura para perguntar aqui...    Acho que basta medir as palavras bem e fazer as perguntas certas... Se voc s quer conhecer, cite um uso n?o violento.|`|8058e25c7a056b0052858c04d13d5c98aa	Primeiro...

X1XAq0rRaa	O que  spoofing?  IP Spoofing,  uma tcnica hacker usada para disfar?ar o IP e mud-lo para um IP que seja "confiado" na rede.    Pra que serve?   um jeito de disfar?ar o seu IP para que ao invadir ou fazer algo "n?o-muito-lcito" pela Internet os tiras n?o cheguem ao IP verdadeiro que pelo provedor, fornece o endere?o, contato e etc.    Como se faz?  Existem programas especiais que fazem isso.    Procure alguma coisa em http://www.forum-invasao.com.br/novo se quiser saber mais.|`|72a7cc913fd1f366f30e78c26ff97194aa	No contexto de redes de computadores, IP spoofing  uma tcnica de subvers?o de sistemas informticos que consiste em mascarar (spoof) pacotes IP com endere?os remetentes falsificados.    Devido s caractersticas do protocolo IP, o reencaminhamento de pacotes  feito com base numa premissa muito simples: o pacote dever ir para o destinatrio (endere?o-destino); n?o h verifica??o do remetente  o router anterior pode ser outro, e ao nvel do IP, o pacote n?o tem qualquer liga??o com outro pacote do mesmo remetente. Assim, torna-se trivial falsificar o endere?o de origem, i.e., podem existir vrios computadores a enviar pacotes fazendo-se passar pelo mesmo endere?o de origem, o que representa uma srie amea?a para os velhos protocolos baseados em autentica??o pelo endere?o IP.    Esta tcnica, utilizada com outras de mais alto nvel, aproveita-se, sobretudo, da no??o de confiabilidade que existe dentro das organiza??es: supostamente n?o se deveria temer uma mquina de dentro da empresa, se ela  da empresa. Mas isto n?o  bem assim, como indica o pargrafo anterior. Por outro lado, um utilizador torna-se tambm confivel quando se sabe de antem?o que estabeleceu uma liga??o com determinado servi?o. Esse utilizador torna-se interessante, do ponto de vista do atacante, se ele possuir (e estiver a usar) direitos priveligiados no momento do ataque.|`|yl6xqcoKaa	Ricardo t explicadinho a em cima j...

Make sure it is set to public, so people browsing can find it.    www.feedburner.com is supossed to be good for making your content accessable to lots of different formats - so it is widely accessable.     Lots of keywords relating to what the charity does, in fact a lot of content always helps.     Find a similar website and get in contact with them - swap links.     And all the traditional publicity of course.     What is the charity by the way?    Good luck

aae272cfb22671fa588bd9295208aa4eaa	Well, the simplest answer is: Stop checking your personal email on company time!    Now, if you company IT policy allows you personal use of the computer on breaks/lunch, you need to do a couple of things:    1) Turn OFF the password remembering in your browser. Not knowing what browser you have (let alone which version) I'm going to have to direct you to the manufacturers website for that. While you are at it, have it remove all of the old passwords it has stored. Stored passwords are one of the biggest security holes in any IT operation.    2) When you open www.yahoo.com, SIGN OUT. Then, do NOT check the box that says to keep you logged in.    Of course, before you make any changes to a work computer, you should check with your IT people about the company policies.|`|0970ccb714dfc02b7b183f3f7b73baaeaa	Be sure to log out of Yahoo when you're not at work, and uncheck the box that "Keeps you signed in" when you log in. This way you'll have to put in your password every time, but it's a lot safer than having it open.

719e45406b21820ad3ef02eab1b262ccaa	Windows Vista, le dernier systme oprationnel de Microsoft, est bourr de systmes de protection anti-copie et de blocage de contenu suite aux pressions de certaines socits comme la MPAA, la RAA ou la SGAE et sous prtexte de combattre le piratage. Ces systmes sont intgrs dans la programmation de base du systme ce qui les rend trs difficiles  supprimer ou  contourner.    Le rsultat c'est que si vous installez Windows Vista ou si vous achetez un PC o Windows Vista est dj prinstall, vous ne pouvez plus visionner ou enregistrer des vidos ni couter ou enregistrer de la musique tlcharges sur Internet.    Le plus grave c'est que, dans beaucoup de cas, vous ne pourrez pas non plus le faire mme si vous avez achet, en toute lgalit, le contenu, parce que le DRM (systme de protection des droits d'auteur) intgr ne permet pas, par exemple, que vous puissiez enregistrer une chanson ou un DVD (lgalement achet) sur votre MP3, ni que vous puissiez enregistrer une slection de chansons (achetes lgalement) pour le Cd de votre voiture. Et souvent, vous ne pourrez mme pas enregistrer un film, (achet lgalement), sur votre ordinateur ou sur un quelconque mdia autre qu'un graveur spcifique autoris par Microsoft et les fabricants de contenus. Si vous essayez de le faire, l'enregistrement est de mauvaise qualit ou bien carrment impossible.    La seule solution s?re pour lutter contre cet abus c'est de ne pas installer Windows Vista et de refuser tout PC que l'on essaiera de vous vendre avec Windows Vista prinstall. Continuez d'utiliser votre Windows XP ou envisagez de passer  un systme oprationnel ? libre ? comme Linux.|`|377e9f732be9269041b729e29b2b264baa	Bonjour,    Pour ma part j'utilise le vista ultimate, car le vista basic (il manque certains plugins et codecs, surtout pour la vido).

Et les utilisateurs Vista finiront par s'habituer   Vista, comme ceux qui sont passs de 98  XP.|`|4cf79f3c12c3449d5dec21b56e041303aa	Le 30 janvier dernier, Microsoft France ftait la sortie officielle de la version grand public de Windows Vista, le nouveau systme d'exploitation de la firme de Redmond,  la Grande Arche de la Dfense. Nous y avons rencontr Florent Peyraud, membre de l'association ni?oise Linux Azur, qui a accept de rpondre  nos interrogations quant  l'avenir de Linux face  Vista.    Les systmes d'exploitation de Microsoft sont installs sur plus de 95% des ordinateurs personnels  travers le monde, un quasi monopole qui laisse peu de place pour des solutions alternatives telles que le systme open source Linux, qui remporte  l'heure actuelle moins de 1% des suffrages, les quelques % restants tant dtenus par le groupe Apple et ses Mac.    Pourtant Linux est de plus en plus utilis dans les entreprises,  limage du groupe PSA (Peugeot/Citro?n) qui vient de signer un accord avec Novell pour le dploiement de la distribution SUSE Linux sur 20.000 postes de travail et 2.500 serveurs.    Alors pourquoi les solutions Linux, qui semblent trs populaires au niveau professionnel, comptabilisent-elles si peu ? dadhrents ? chez les particuliers ? Florent Peyraud, membre de l'association Linux Azur, a bien voulu rpondre  nos questions concernant lavenir de Linux face  Vista.    EchosDuNet : Florent, vous avez assist, comme nous, au spectacle donn par Microsoft France pour fter le lancement officiel de la version grand public de Windows Vista. Quavez-vous pens de cette soire et quel est votre avis sur Windows Vista ?    Florent Peyraud : Le spectacle tait joli. La soire, un coup marketing, rien de plus. Le feu d'artifice a attir un monde fou, le message commercial est-il pass ? Je ne saurais le dire. Ni la marque ni le nom du produit n'taient affichs en gros du c?t des visiteurs anonymes.  Pour ce qui est des VIP, ceux qui taient sous la tente monte pour l'occasion, j'imagine que c'tait diffrent ! Je pense que l'vnement tait quand mme surtout destin au grand public et non aux industriels car parmi ces derniers, ceux qui ont choisi (ou qu'on a aid  choisir) Microsoft Windows ont dj planifi leur migration vers Vista, pour une simple question de continuit de support technique. Maintenant, il est possible que Microsoft sente le vent tourner avec les dernires versions de Linux et que la firme veuille scuriser sa clientle.    EDN : La Dfense tait galement le lieu o se droulait le salon Solutions Linux. Vous y reprsentiez votre association, Linux Azur, qui a pour objectif de promouvoir Linux, en particulier la distribution Kaella, et les Logiciels Libres sur la rgion C?te d'Azur. Un commentaire sur ce salon ? Quelle catgorie de visiteurs y avez-vous accueilli : uniquement des ? Linuxiens ? ou des personnes venues dcouvrir le monde du Libre ?    F.P. : Le salon a lui aussi attir beaucoup de monde, de tous les horizons, des informaticiens comme des nophytes curieux. L'entre du salon tait libre pour la visite des stands. Et sur le stand de l'association, nous avons pu discuter avec des personnes trs diffrentes. Certains sont venus nous complimenter ou nous donner leur retour d'exprience sur la Kaella, d'autres taient surtout attirs par les T-shirts de l'association. D'autres encore venaient  notre rencontre par hasard, sans rien conna?tre  Linux ni aux logiciels libres. Nous prenions alors le temps d'expliquer les notions de libert dans les logiciels, les avantages  les utiliser, et nous proposions une dmonstration de Linux grace  la Kaella.  Les autres stands proposaient d'autres activits tout aussi intressantes sur des sujets diffrents. Le salon tait aussi un moyen pour nous de tous nous rencontrer, de mettre un visage et une voix sur un nom ou un pseudo chang par courriel sur les listes de diffusion. Le contact humain est irrempla?able et permet de faire de grandes choses.    EDN : Les utilisateurs, lorsquon leur parle de Linux, ont souvent le rflexe de penser que le systme ncessite des connaissances pousses en informatique. Or Linux est devenu trs convivial depuis quelques annes. Comment faire pour le rendre plus abordable aux botiens ? Quels arguments pour convaincre les utilisateurs de basculer sur Linux plut?t que Vista ? Le fait que Linux ne permette pas toujours dutiliser le matriel ou lapplication quon souhaiterait nest-il pas une entrave au dveloppement du systme ?    F. P. : C'est un point de plus qui me fait penser que la firme est trs puissante. On peut bien parler de lobbyisme dans le cas des universits.   Dernirement, dans l'IUT d'informatique de Nice, j'ai pu constater que tout tait fait pour que les tudiants se forment et n'utilisent que les solutions propritaires, principalement celles de Microsoft, et n'aient qu'une vision trs ngative de Linux, qu'ils n'utilisaient qu' titre anecdotique au travers d'un terminal en ligne de commande. C'est un peu malhonnte  mon avis et c'est surtout l'inverse de ce qu'il faut faire pour dvelopper l'ouverture d'esprit des tudiants.   En plus, l'offre "philanthropique" de Microsoft a ses limites, que les tudiants, griss par l'opulence de l'offre, ne voient mme pas : toutes les licences sont limites dans le temps  la dure des tudes. Aprs, soit l'tudiant achte une licence en son nom, soit il a eu la chance de dcouvrir les solutions alternatives, et au pire, il passe dans la catgorie des pirates en continuant  utiliser une licence qui n'est plus valide. Nous ne voulons pas dnigrer les produits Microsoft. Chacun doit avoir le choix de prfrer telle ou telle solution en fonction de son besoin et ses go?ts, ses moyens. Nous voulons simplement informer sur les solutions alternatives et dvelopper l'esprit critique face  l'offre logicielle.|`|kvCXb0Baaa	Vive Linux...

LFWWPgpQaa	With a system like yours it should be powering along in WoW.  Faulty Power supplies can cause really odd problems like random crashes and reboots, but I have never seen one just plain lower the FPS.  It is possible though if it wasnt giveing the video card enough juice on its external connector and so the card goes into low power mode (you should get a warning when booting if this is the case though).    First I would try another game or download 3Dmark and see how they perform, if they too are slow we know the issue is the Computer not WoW.   If they are fast WoW is the issue, rename your WDB, WTF and Interface folder and load WoW. If its fast now theres a problem with your settings, UI mods or just a plain corruption (because you renamed them you can put them back if it doesnt help).    If its the PC and other games are running fine, check the heat on your Video card it will slow itself down if its overheating, so to will your CPU so check it as well.  Reinstall the latest WHQL Video drivers (just because there certified and less likely to have any bugs for testing).  You can also go into the Bios and check power levels to see if your power supply is doing anything it shouldnt.    Hope this helps!
D88aMYx3aa	Crap brand name. Stick with Coolermaster, Antec, OCZ, or Corsair.    And why buy a 2006 model CPU and Spring 2007 model graphics card if you're building a brand new PC?

The prices is close to the same.  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...     Given your list of hardware, I'd probably go with a larger (higher wattage) PSU in case you want to add another video card or additional HDDs at some point.  Even a 700 watt PSU won't raise the price by a significant amount on the front end.  Its better to have too much than too little.|`|AA10948208	It is pretty good,but i would go 600 watts for future add ons.
qEET2iA6aa	DL mean Double Layer. Most DVD's only have a capacity of 4.7GB, however a Double Layer DVD has 8.5GB.    If you want a DVD that is editable, you will need to get a DVD-RW or DVD+RW.    The "+" and the "-" just denotes the DVD format. (Think Bluray vs. HDDVD) Most, if not all new DVD players/burners support both formats so your preference might come down to which is cheaper.|`|esYTfoYraa	for that you need a cdrw you will find them at walmart|`|5jfO0jMlaa	To my knowledge, most dvds are write once only.  You cant erase and rerecord.|`|1JyyVQ4Qaa	+R and -R are DVD formats. DL means Dual Layer which allows 8+ GB of data. Just make sure that when you buy disks that they are labelled as above.|`|wUqeZl3Saa	Unlike the CD recording formats, the DVD recording formats didn't get standardized quite as much. To tell the two apart, there is the + and - type. In addition to single layer DVD, your recorder can also do dual layer DVD's. That is the DL specification.    The bottom line is that your burner can handle every format there is. Depending on what you are doing with the media, one or the other format offers some advantages. Once you burn a DvD+/-R, the differences pretty much vanish in most cases. Even most players will generally handle the various formats.    Shadow Wolf|`|Fv2WC9HBaa	all of them can be burned in your recorder.  there are some differeces in the qualities of the disk.
wxOO8A8eaa	The message I luv u sooooo much baaaaaaaaby. I can't waaaaaaait too seeee u 2nite  looks like a wall post for me. However, It can be a private message.  You poke someone you want to stay in touch with and you give a Gift when you want to do so to a special person  When? The poke can be anytime but i think Gifts have to be given in special ocassions|`|ZaadvJAXaa	I just wish that people would stop typing "I luv u soooooo much baaaaaaaaaaaby.  I can't waaaaaaaaaaaait too seeee..."  and so on and so forth.  If you were to repeat it out loud, what does that sound "likeeeeeeee"?  It's so annoying!|`|EGJJNWhXaa	Depends on your circle of friends. Poking somebody is just like a friendly nudge to say hi. Super poke is an application you need to add that does the same thing but add pics/movies. and gifts you need to pay for and they show on somebodys profile.    Who/when/where again depend on your circle of friends. Obviously if you gift somebody a heart your intentions are displayed... lol. But anything for fun or jokey can be to a friend of 10 years or somebody you just met yesterday.|`|NWoKdP4Yaa	I have no facebook etiquette. I PDA it all the way.
RzIiywZ6aa	You could use any picture editing program.  picnik for example, because its on facebook.  You edit your pic to say whatever you want, the instead of saving it to an album in facebook, save it to your computer. Then you go to upload stickers and you can just retrieve it from wherever you saved it on your computer and Bam! you have just made a bumper sticker|`|rQG60W0Eaa	I don't know .... Sorry ....|`|AA12363708	Well most people probably just use MS paint, I'm not sure of the Mac alternative, or photoshop or something similar.  And then once you have the image the way you want it, yo just upload it to the bumper sticker ap.    You might want to find just a stock image on google images, and then just add some text over the top.    p.s.

How to upload:  on the bumper sticker main page click on "upload stickers" that will bring you to the screen to upload them. they can only be 170 pixels wide and 200pixels tall. and they must be under a MB.

To see the full size of your hard drive you will need to use the Disk MGR program in Windows.

It will also show you any hidden partitions, or backups that Windows has made that you did not know about...     Remember if it is on the same line, it is all the same hard drive!

FFRhS6Axaa	Basicaly, when you use websites like photobucket, they are hosting the picture you upload to their online server.  To post a picture into a website using html, you follow the following code:        Just insert the url of the photo and leave the quotation marks there.    The most important part is the picture has to be hosted somewhere first.  Photobucket and Imageshack.us are both good sites to use for free.  If you are doing a professional webpage and need a more reliable image hosting service, you may need to pay a membership fee for that.    If you are trying to build a website, I suggest you download a website builder like Microsoft Expressions, or Adobe Dreamweaver.

AA11480348	It's rotating inside a square matrix actually.    This line:                   dos[3 - y][x] = temp[x][y];    is transfering the contents of an entire row (temp[x][y]) into a column (dos[3-y][x]). The x and y occupy different positions in dos[3-y][x]. So for each iteration of the loop, you get this transfer going on.

7ZfGqo3qaa	275 watts is really weak, I'd suggest you upgrade that to 400W or 450W.     As for specific card recommendations, it depends upon what type of video expansion slot your computer has.  If it's a fairly recent computer with a PCI-Express slot, cards are plentiful and models good enough to meet your needs are cheap.  For example, the Radeon 4650 or 4670.    If your computer has the older AGP slot, then video cards are more expensive.  While the Radeon 3850 is the best AGP card out there, it's not cheap and needs a bigger power supply.  The Radeon 2600XT is about half the price and would work nicely.    If your computer has neither and you're stuck with only PCI cards, the best choices are the Radeon X1550 and GeForce 8500GT.|`|3werhIURaa	ATI Radeon 3850  VERY powerful, and VERY cheap cards.|`|zJppAVbVaa	AGP or PCI-e bus.  Your computer seems old so probably AGP.    For AGP a 2600XT or 3850HD    For PCI-e nothing newer than a 9600 GSO will work.  I'd get a ATI 4670 or 4650 HD because your PSU is low.

MvVd0ayCaa	Those websites are incredibly complex and have many different elements and technologies, developed and perfected by tens if not hundreds of developers over several years, working together to produce the information you see and provide the experience you get.    I think what you want to know, is how to make dynamic websites (i.e. websites that can change, and not always show the exact same information). In order to accomplish this, you need to learn some sort of server-side programming language. The most popular for beginners and hobbyists is PHP because it is free, yet very robust.    In order to get started, I would recommend you find a web host that supports PHP sites (there are many) and then do a Google search for "PHP Tutorial". There is an endless amount of information out there on the subject, the trick is finding a good place to start.    Good luck.    P.S. Don't let any of that discourage you! Facebook was originally developed by Mark Zuckerberg who was just a 21 year old psychology student in his dorm room. It really was nothing more than a hobby he did on the side, now he's the head of multi-billion dollar organization.

elgVgRCRaa	Ok well depends on what the site is for. If the site is just to show information, then it might be acceptable. It is also decent when it is for a multimedia website, like a band. If you want your site to do commerce or to be easily searchable and accessable, then don't use Flash. It is not easy to make a good flash website without learning good Object Oriented Actionscript code. It is almost always better to have some Flash elements in an HTML page. I would suggest for Art and novels and such that you make an HTML web page and add flash elements. If you wanted you could learn PHP and use a MySQL database to load the pictures remotely without having to change the site every time you want to add a picture. Google PHP MySQL photo gallery tutorial. The code will probably be just as hard as learning good actionscript (Flash Code).    Here is a link (PHP/MySQL) http://www.sitepoint.com/article/php-gal...    Link to HTML/CSS Gallery  http://www.webreference.com/programming/...    Pros of Flash  -Looks dazzling (if done by a professional)  -Works well with media    Cons of Flash  -Not always supported by client computers (they can't see the site)  -Involves advanced coding to make it work well  -Not easily indexed by search engines  -Changes are annoying  -It takes a long time to load a Flash web page  -Flash is not a web standard|`|EyacJRKUaa	me, personally HATE flash-based websites.

The only real benefit is that it can look good IF you have enough skill to make it good. And that is definately a benefit worth considering. However, there are a lot of downsides that usually make it not worthwhile.    Downsides:  1. It is far more difficult to make a GOOD flash site than it is to make a normal web site.  2. It is very difficult to change flash websites later on, if you want to make things look different, add more art work, etc.  2a. If you want to make changes in the more distant future, you will absolutely NEED the original source files from when you originally designed the site. In my experience, most people lose these within a few months to a year. Think long-term.  3. Users need flash before they can view your webpage. Also, not all computers run flash well.  4. Anything you can do with flash, can probably be done another, better, way.

Download the program, burn it to CD, put CD in CD-Rom drive, power up pc (pretty simple huh?).  Plus also check in your BIOS to see if anything looks out of place as far as your on board peripherals goes.

Good luck, usually when something like that happens, you end up kissing the PC bye-bye and building a new one.

Programing languages exist in just about everything electric around us. From programing controls for systems, phones and chips to portals and applications for the internet or intranets. Games, renderers, shaders,scripts,macros,cgi,etc,etc. The field is just too vast to even begin to tell you where to start if you dont have a clear vision of what kind of programming you would like to learn.

It won't be easy but you'll have a better understanding of memory allocation and de-allocation. It will be much easier to move from C++ to say Java or C .    Java or C  are easier to learn though and you can quickly develop GUI with them. With C++, it's not as straight forward. So it really depends on what you want to do and your time-frame.|`|ktcnxDA0aa	I don't think this is a question with such a straight forward question like "learn C or C++".    Are you learning this just for the sake of learning or are you looking to get into a particular career?  What kind of career?  More business oriented or game development.  All these simple questions help to better answer what might be a good start for you.    If you are looking at hard core game development, then definitely check out C and C++.  If you are thinking more like web based games and content, check out ActionScript, JavaScript and Java.  Also many corporations are redoing all their web-based applications in Flex so knowing ActionScript will be a good way to get a job.  Anything web 2.0/Rich Internet Application-ish, Flex, Flash and ActionScript is the way to go.  All of these are related and learning one will empower you to learn the others more quickly.  I started on ActionScript so I am biased.    I'd also say if you wanna do more business type stuff, database administrators are still in high demand and make lots of money.  Check out MySQL and PHP.    Think of it this way:  Don't pose the question as what should I learn first, rather what direction do I want to go.  Then what you should learn first, second, third will come more naturally to your desires.|`|lqtQ7c92aa	It depends on what you want to end up doing.

Many people start with Basic as it is easy to learn and doesn't obscure the logic of the program with its syntax.    My suggestion is to start with an Object Oriented language like C++ or Java.  Both of these will teach you the fundamentals of building programs through interfaces and inheritance which are two things that make any language easier and more productive.

Don't be fooled into using crucial.com like so many here might suggest. I would be more than happy to look it up for you. Know that if you are using Windows XP x 32, the most RAM you will be able to get is 3GB, which is more than sufficient in most cases (only if you are an extreme gamer would you consider more).

Well, this is true, in certain circumstances. But for most of the times, it really is just bad files in your registry files. Corrupted or missing registry files can make your computer too slow.  The registry is a main part of your computer's Operating System. With time, as you use Windows and install and uninstall programs, your registry will get congested and full of errors. So your computer could slow down. So, if you can clean it up this problem can be solved.Sometimes you can speed computer up by 300%. To clean up registry,You can download a software called regsitry cleaner---Clean registry,remnant,corrupt files and temp files,history,cookies,etc..

There are however, other applications that you can run on Windows for editing movies.  Windows Movie Maker comes with Winows Vista    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Mov...    I would try using that instead.    If you need a more professional application for editing your movies, I would suggest Adobe Premiere.

RZQnxoF1aa	This problem can mean many things, odds are the problem is with the operating system itself. I'm going to give you some instruction of some things I would do if I was working on this computer.   Questions you should consider:   Do you get any error messages? If so contact Microsoft with the error message.   Is you computer under warranty? If so, it's best to let a technician handle the problem. Note: Sometimes they will reformat or replace your hard drive. You could loose all data so it would be a good idea to backup first.   Re-pare Steps:   1) Restart Windows in Safe Mode. As you computer is restarting, hold down F8 and once the menu appears, select Safe Mode using the arrow key and selecting by pressing enter. Note: If windows does not boot in safe mode then seek help from a train technician, the problem may be too complex to go into decision in the message.   2) Consider a system restore. You will loose all data and changes you have made to your computer after the restore date. Open system restore by clicking on the start menu and selecting help and support. System restore should be one of the options assuming you have system restore turned on. (It's windows default so you should.) Select a restore date prior to the problem occurrence. Restore your PC. If you do not want to do a system restore then skip this step.   3) Update any and all ad-ware, spy-ware, and most importantly, Registry Cleaner programs that are running on you computer.   Use the tool:    http://toptenantispywareviews.com/Clean_... [if you do not have one]     http://toptenantispywareviews.com [if you do not have one]    4) Run a virus scan, then spy-ware scan, followed by ad-ware.   5) Your problem should be resolved by now. Restart your computer and see if it works, if not then restart in safe mode again (step 1).   6) If all else fells you can reformat your hard drive by reinstalling windows. You can do this by inserting the windows disk or system restore disk that came with your computer. Follow the instructions given by the manufacturer. WARNING: This will wipe the hard drive of all data, it will be like you just got your computer. You will loose all software and everything.   I hope this helped.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	It depends.

You lose everything.  To do this you need the Operating System CD.  If your using Windows XP then it is probably some shade of purple.  You put it in and then restart the computer.  When it first starts back up, you press F12 for the setup menu.  Then choose to Boot from CD-ROM.  From there is will ask you if you want to repair, or if you want to reinstall a fresh copy of XP, or whatever OS you have.  You choose to install the fresh copy.  Then it will ask you where to do it.  It will give you a few options.  One should be the C: drive.  It will say C: Hard Drive or something like that.  Choose that one.  Choose that one to reformat and once you choose it, and start the reformatting there is no turning back.  It returns the computer to the way you got it.  No Microsoft Word.  No programs but Paint, and basic things like that.  You will probably have to install driver's again to get your sound and internet connection back.  All files are gone too, so if there are important pictures or something on your computer, you need to move those to a flash drive or some kind of external storage, or they will be gone forever.  If you don't know how to do any of this will some understanding, then you should find someone who has done it before that can be there to help you.

I/O devices are used to read in (I) or write out (O) data by the CPU.|`|sAqfeSapaa	I will try to answer your question in Human terms.    A computer has the following basic components in order to work.  CPU, motherboard, RAM (memory), Hard disk,   Input output devices (monitor, keyboard/mouse)    Let us convert this into a human system for better understanding    CPU = the human brain (subconscious).  This is responsible of doing everything a human does subconsciously. (breathing, seeing, digesting, hearing, etc.) So this does everything to make the computer operate    Motherboard = the nervous system  Our brain is useless without a nervous system to connect our limbs, hands, eyes, feet together. So does a motherboard, it links each and every component to the CPU (brain).    RAM (memory) and Harddisk = brain (conscious/memory)  Our memories and thoughts that we cheerish everyday. Since a human brain is superior and can do both subconscious and conscious thing, the computer is not. So it has two brains. So both of this store everything you feed to the computer so it can remember them.    Monitor, keyboard, mouse (input/output devices) = eyes, mouth and hands  We interact with people using our eyes, mouth (speech), hands (action). Well the use of the monitor keyboard and mouse is the computer's only way to interact with humans.

XsIuoM6daa	If you want a valid comparison, you may want to look at either AMD & Intel dual core or look at AMD & Intel quad core processors rather than one of each.     Next, what price range are you considering? If price is no object, Intel's Core i7 processors are the fastest ones out there (today). Even the "entry level" Intel Core i7 920 will beat just about anything else out there except for the higher-priced i7s.     Both AMD and Intel make very good processors. If there is a budget you have in mind though, at certain price ranges, AMD has a better offering. Go $50 higher, and Intel might be the better choice. Another $25 and it may be AMD again. When you have that amount in mind, check out the articles at various sites like Tom's Hardware, ExtremeTech, Xbitlabs.com and Tweaknews.net. I find the CPU (and GPU) comparison charts to be a good starting point once I know which processors are on the list of candidates. ( http://www.tomshardware.com/charts/deskt... )|`|jwurmVbVaa	a x4 has 4 cores while a dual only has two. the more cores the better|`|f9gcRmhGaa	Its an apples to oranges question...      If you were to compare the AMD Phenom X4 to the Intel Quad Core CPUs, you'd get a wide range of responses,  Personally, I like Intel processors.|`|3ufrOtXpaa	Ignore the other guy, he doesn't know what he's talking about.    There are a few things to consider when choosing a CPU: Clock Rate, Clock Speed, and cores.    Quad-Cores are, to be quite honest, overkill at the moment. Most applications are not optimized for them (particularly games), so two of the cores will just not be recognized/used. This means that most of the time a fast dual core CPU will beat a quad core CPU in performance.     Intel is famous for having incredibly fast Clock Rates. An Intel Dual core demolishes an AMD dual core, and will usually also beat AMD quad cores for most performance. An Intel Quad Core will beat any AMD CPU, except the brand new Phenom II at times. Go with the Intel Dual Core CPU. (I'd go for E8400/E8500, or if you don't have the $$ E7300).|`|DXpvXXG1aa	Short answer Quad core long answer it depends on what tasks you do. Gaming requires higher clock speeds and most games dont use all 4 cores. Generally for gaming Dual is the way to go With DX11 and PhysX, CPU physics (Havock engine) could be a thing of the past meaning that a 2nd GPU could be used thus reducing the number of threads and leading to less importance of the CPU.    For tasks like encoding however 4 cores really shine.     Thats generally Quad vs Dual but intels processors are better at overclocking (Phenom II at least made AMD competive again and it can hit 4GHz on air) An OC'd Intel Dual can out pace the origional AMD phenom easily, even in multithread apps which favour quads such as encoding.  This was down to intels being great overclockers and being slightly faster clock for clock. Phenom II is slightly better than the Q6600 (both OC'd to max) but not quite as good as intels Q9X50's. Intels Q9X50 can hit 4GHz too but intels are slightly faster clock for clock than AMD. This could change when AM3 Boards and processors are released but I dont think it will be a huge difference (I could be wrong).     ATM tho I would go AMD. Their performance is sitting close to intels with the new phenom II and when i5 is released (intels new mainstream processors, i7 being for the enthueasts market), Core2 will be phased out leaving   the LGA775 pathway a dead end. i5 will move intel in the direction of AMD's and i7 in the sense of using native (all cores on one chip opposed to two dual cores being stuck together) and using DDR3 ram and HTT opposed to core2's FSB way of communicating. Although this hasn't worked for AMD (who have been using this from the start) it allowed intel to watch and perfect the design before releasing it. i5 could provide a performance boost over core2 but like AM3, its a case of wait and see. Sorry i got a bit off topic there lol    hope that helps anyway

WzP7WRAiaa	RGB stands for Red, Green, Blue. RGB LED is the alternative to WLED (white) and offers a noticeably brighter image and displays a wider range of colour than WLED.    From what I have read from numerous reviews and forums RGB is superior to WLED but it does come at a premium so I recommend you see the difference for yourself before making the decision. Depending on the product some people have said RGB is too bright while others say the difference is small. Also, the glossy screened RGB does have noticeable issues with reflections which can be distracting.    The technology is meant to be an advantage for movie buffs and people that require a superior colour but I would be interested to know if anyone has experienced gaming with this kind of screen and believe it is worth the extra cost for that purpose.

zJppAVbVaa	802.11g is no good for 60 feet away indoors (not even 40 feet through walls).  You won't get a SNR at forty feet above 15, you need at least 25 for an acceptable connection.  A SNR of 40 or greater will not drop any packets at all and can't be achieved with 802.11g in most cases at that range.  You need 802.11n    802.11n Router with great QoS.  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    Then get a  802.11n adapter (USB)  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...  http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductLis...    PCI (33Mhz bus)  http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductLis...

Or make an ethernet bridge yourself with a DD-WRT 802.11n supported router.  (might cost the same as DAP-15XX)      What I would do is buy a 802.11n adapter for the PC first (and not a router).  Then use the adapter in 802.11g mode.  If the signal is no good (use netstumbler to check SNR) then buy a 802.11n router.|`|6m6OdKePaa	http://www.consumersearch.com/wireless-r...

zorYTX59aa	Matters such as harassment, bullying, or inappropriate comments   are best handled through YouTube's own built-in reporting system.  Here are their different forms (whose URL addresses I have written  out in full for you), followed by their direct links:    -- form about harassment:  www . google . com / support / youtube / bin / request . py ? contact _ type = user harassment  http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bi...    -- privacy complaint form:  help . youtube . com / support / youtube / bin / request . py ? page = & contact _ type = privacy  http://help.youtube.com/support/youtube/...    -- if my direct "links" fail:  help . youtube . com / support / youtube / bin / answer . py ? answer = 94633  http://help.youtube.com/support/youtube/...    If for some stupid reason known only to Youtube, they redirect my  first 2 links to some unhelpful intro page instead of where they are   supposed to, click on the 3rd link which I've given you. From there,  click on the blue "continue" that is in the 2nd paragraph.    You may also want to consider either of these two direct links:    www . google . com / support / youtube / bin / request . py ? contact _ type = abuse expand  http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bi...  http://www.youtube.com/safety_help    In these forms, YouTube will ask you to input the username of the  harasser, so make extra sure that you know it exactly; if not jot it  down beforehand.     If YouTube doesn't believe your complaint warrants more follow-up,  I believe they won't send you a formal reply message. Maybe just  an automated confirmation that they received your complaint form.    I hope that my information is helpful to you, and more importantly:  Good luck to you.|`|b6d429b7c23a1fc4d1e4fa1657d4b9cbaa	Email YouTube support, and tell them what's going on.

zorYTX59aa	If your YouTube is getting bombarded with "JavaScript" and   "Flash Player" messages, and people are telling you to get  or install something, please...DON'T TOUCH A THING. You   will get nowhere fooling around with "Java", "Flash", or even   different web browsers.    None of those things will help you, because your computer   and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right?   The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add,   change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.    I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a   lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why   in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good   for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).    Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of  their own servers every single day without warning anybody,   in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions,   it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or   "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.    If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing   you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages,   it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet   files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.    "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get   permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay   there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer   much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of   them. The solution to that is to clear your "cache" of all the   "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" and "history". Then reboot.    Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it;   do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts   my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever.   (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)    Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"  in order to play smooth. You don't need anything else.    Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|wyRJofXJaa	maybe ur java script is turned off.....turn it on find out how from i.e help|`|kDgtpUY3aa	there really is no way around this, your just d/l the new features, it should use to much space|`|oMHavrV9aa	You won't be able to watch youtube videos without downloading the latest version of flash.

AA11736483	The cooling fans installed in newer PC's are smart. They are temperature and speed controlled by the bios. At power on, the bios with run the fans at max speed to test rpm's and other characteristics. When done, the fans return to 'normal' speed and the PC is allowed to boot. I have seen many computers that had glitches in the bios that resulted in erratic operation of the fans. Usually, there is an updated bios for the PC to correct this. You have to go to the manufacturers site and look for a bios update, then download and install it. The instructions for installing the update are different for all manufacturers and some of them can be tricky.

TM2yK8nQaa	First off, you don't say how old you are.  If you're 16 or 17, that's one thing...I would expect you to have more freedom online.  That's not a guarantee that you would be safe, but the odds would be more in your favor.  If you're under 14, you aren't even supposed to be logged onto this site.  You may have noticed that there are quite a few bent personalities that respond to Answers, and I can assure you that there are predators who troll these sites looking for young kids...and they are better at snaring you than you would be at avoiding them.  Your parents, however annoying it may be, are doing their JOB.  They are responsible for you and your well being until you can do it for yourself.  Hiding what you are doing, or trying to mislead them as to your activities online, are indications that maybe you aren't ready to to be trusted yet.  Just know that you are very lucky in having both parents at home, and looking out for you.  I know it is irritating to feel that you have no privacy...we all felt the same way, and that was before the internet made such terrible news stories of kids and bad people so common.  Be totally open and adult about it, and you'll be off the leash sooner than later.  Let them know you can be trusted.  :)|`|esYTfoYraa	you cant that just shows how much they care about you and want to protect you|`|2SSA9e9Naa	I don't know if there is anything you can do other than talk to them.

yqqVPcU0aa	You are mixing your understanding of what is used here.  The Phenom 9550 is more than adaquate to run Crysis.  The ATi Radeon is a videocard.  Chances are you are running with the onboard videocard, which has nothing to do with the CPU of the Phenom.  Any separate video card will improve Crysis performance drastically over onboard videocard.    p.s.  I have the Phenom 9550 CPU as well, and I've paired it with two SLI nVidia 9800 video cards.  I run Crysis at full resolution.|`|SolmxPz7aa	Your processor and power supply should be more than adequite.

949AJbB6aa	Have you tried rebooting? Is it on mute? Look up the laptop via its manufacturer and download the audio drivers then let the program run and hope the sound chip isnt fried.|`|sAqfeSapaa	Basic solution first:  There are TWO (2) volume and mute settings on any computer.    One is on windows.  Second is on the software (audio/video player) that you are using.      Assuming you are referring to the audio and mute of the software that you are using.  e.g. windows media player, winamp, vlc, jetaudio, or the likes then check the next step below.    At your taskbar (Where the 'start' button is located), at the right most corner where you normally see the time, you will see a speaker icon there. Left click on it.  Check the volume and mute settings there.  This should most probably fix the problem.     Basic solution two.    If this still does not work, what is your laptop model? Some laptops have a 'manual' volume adjustment wheel / buttons on the laptop.  Adjusting this might also solve your problem.    Basic solution three.  Try restarting your laptop if the two solutions above does not work.      If this still does not work give me your laptop brand and model.  If possible, give us a history when sounds were working, then things you have done afterwards for us to check if there are bugs that caused it.|`|8zPqtSMIaa	First thing I'd do: reboot. Next, check to make sure you haven't muted it by accident.    Finally, right-click "My Computer" and select "Manage." Then click on Device Manager. Scroll down to Sound, Video and Game Controllers. Whatever is listed should NOT have a red X. If it does, right click and select Update Driver software. Otherwise, right click and choose Enable this device.    Hope that helps.

Sometimes if the hard drive is too full, the computer will have trouble pulling content off of it.  You probably have enough ram & graphics.

Check that you only have 1 firewall running and 1 anti-virus running.

It will take a specialized program to remove this infection.    Simply uninstalling the program will probably still leave the computer infected.    A couple of months ago, I accidentally downloaded a program from somewhere that infected my computer with malware.      My malware infection was so bad, I thought that I would have to get a new computer.      It wasn't until I found a website in google that gave honest review of spyware and malware removers that I found AdwareAlert.    I downloaded and registered it, and I couldn't be happier.  It removed my malware infection, and also a couple spyware infections I didn't even know I had.    It has kept my computer running fast, and spyware free for a couple of months now.  I highly recommend it.    The website I found can be visited below.    http://www.honestspywarereview.com    Hope this was helpful.|`|nIbN2lSqaa	Can you tap the F8 key during startup to get to a choice of startup options, including safemode, maybe safemode with networking to have internet access to download and run superantispyware.com free version. Not sure about Vista, or even laptops, but it's worth a try and won't harm anything if it doesn't work. From safemode, if you have some kind of rootkit or malware you may have a better shot. I'm no techy but have had my share of comp problems. Good luck!

Around the middle section and to the FAR LEFT of your Movie Maker, there is a button that is called "Set Audio Levels" move it all the way to the right if you just want to hear your music, or all the way to the left if you just want to hear the sound that came with your clip.     If you are doing a combination of both, leave this in the middle, and right click your clip. You'll see that you can mute a particular clip at a time. If you want to mute your music, you can slice sections of it and mute that as well.    Hope I could help! :D

The keyboard layout was designed to spread the load over the fingers and avoid too many successive keystrokes by the same finger to different keys. It was also designed to prevent arms from sticking together on old typewriters. Essentially, it was designed to allow people to type as quickly as was possible on old typewriters.    Also, it's been said that the layout put all the letters needed to type "TYPEWRITER" on the top row so that typewriter salesman wouldn't look silly as they searched the whole keyboard for the various keys.    Update: Anyone who says it was to slow people down is completely mistaken. In fact, it was designed that way to allow people to type faster.|`|949AJbB6aa	The most commonly used keys are in your home row, or in very near proximity to home row.

However, you can also use "in-line CSS" where you apply CSS styling to elements on the page.

I recently suffered a major antivirus 2009 infection. I couldn't use my computer for days.  I tried every thing to get rid of it, but no matter what I did, it just kept coming back stronger.    I was so stressed out after spending multiple days trying to remove the spyware with no luck.  I gave up and decided to throw in the towel.  I called geek squad.  They came and looked at my computer, but wanted $300 to fix it.    I really didn't have that much, so I told them I couldn't afford to fix it at this time.  The technician must have seen the frustration I was going through.  Because he pulled me aside and told me how I could fix it for under $60.    He told me to go to http://www.honestspywarereview.com and download the free spyware removal scan.      So I visited the site and downloaded the program.  Ran the scan and it found over 63 counts of spyware, adware, and malware infections.    I registered the product and was FINALLY able to destroy my antivirus 2009 spyware problems once and for all.  I felt a giant weight lifted off of my shoulder, and also managed to save $240.    I would suggest you give it a shot.  It worked for me.  Plus the product offers a 60 day return policy if it cannot remove your antivirus 2009 spyware infection.

AA11976863	Go to the Apple logo in the main menu, down to "Recent items" and look carefully down the list to see if you find any twins -- duplicate listings of an application name. If you see any duplicate listing, that means you have two copies of the application. This observation depends on your recent items list preferences being set high enough to show enough recent items, such as 30 or 50.    Now, think of an application that has exhibited this behavior. Is it in the Dock at this moment? Did you always open it from the Dock or do you ever find it on a drive and open it from there? If you happen to have two copies of an application, but only one of them is represented in the Dock, opening the other copy will make a new icon appear in the Dock. When you quit that application, the icon will disappear from the Dock.    Let's assume you understand the explanation above and you decide that isn't what's happening. The likely explanation is the preference file for the Dock is corrupt. To fix that, you'll need to delete the prefs file, restart, and the Dock will be reborn, just like it was the first moment you started the computer. Use Spotlight to find "com.apple.dock.plist" and delete it. Restart. If the result is a Dock with any "?" in it, drag the "?" off the Dock. They indicate an original application that has been moved or deleted. Now you are ready to add new items to the Dock to get back to where you want to be.

Your video card driver might be using just a generic driver without the full capabilities of your card, your motherboard chipset drivers may also be using generic drivers which reduce performance.    You should do one of two things to get the best out of your PC after reinstalling XP.    1. Go to the support page for your brand and model of PC on the internet. All good brands of PC will have a page like this where you can download all the correct drivers for your hardware.    2. Find out what all your hardware is and visit the website for the separate hardware manufacturers and get the drivers for your specific kit at all of those.

cMOdbcsJaa	when you go to your actual myspace page to view it, it says friendid=a number. that is your myspace id number. if you go in mobsters and click on your name after you broadcast something. look in the address bar, and match where your myspace id number is. it will have a 22 in front of it if you use internet explorer. now go click on their name in your comments, etc. and look in the address bar on their page. find the id number. then put www.myspace. com/(their myspace id number). that will pull up their myspace page. the number is as good as their url. but they may have it on thier myspace page anyways in case you need the actual myspace URL.

zorYTX59aa	All that you would need to do is append  "&autoplay=1" to both ends of the video  URL address that YouTube gives to you  (example: watch?v=AB1Cd2eF3GH).    When you click on the YouTube embed  code, the entire string highlights -- there  is no other alternative. Here's the format  of a typical YouTube embed code:    ?   ? width="425" height="344">  ?   ? name="movie"   ? value="http://www. youtube. com/v/AB1Cd2eF3GH">  ?    ?   ? name="allowFullScreen"   ? value="true">  ?   ?   ? src="http://www. youtube. com/v/AB1Cd2eF3GH"   ? type="application/x-shockwave-flash"   ? allowfullscreen="true"   ? width="425" height="344">  ?   ?     After you add "&autoplay=1" to both the  value and the source codes, this is what   the overall embed code should look like:    ?   ? width="425" height="344">  ?   ? name="movie"   ? value="http://www. youtube. com/v/AB1Cd2eF3GH&autoplay=1">  ?    ?   ? name="allowFullScreen"   ? value="true">  ?   ?   ? src="http://www. youtube. com/v/AB1Cd2eF3GH&autoplay=1"   ? type="application/x-shockwave-flash"   ? allowfullscreen="true"   ? width="425" height="344">  ?   ?

AA10700604	Hi smurf>4    You probably already have Boot Camp (especially if you have Leopard) on your Mac and that's what you use to boot into Windows.  So what you would need is a copy of Microsoft Windows.  Use your Mac's Disk Utility program to to make a special partition to install Windows on, then you would use Boot Camp to boot your Mac into Windows.      You should probably google or go to the Apple web site to read more about using Boot Camp:    http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/boo...    Parallels allows you to have both the Mac OS X and Windows together and you can drag and drop files back and forth.    http://www.parallels.com/landingpage/dsk...    I'm not 100% but I think that VMware makes it so you don't even have to have Windows installed to run Windows on your Mac.    http://www.vmware.com/    Boot Camp is only for Intel-based Macs, if you had a PowerPC Mac you would you used to be able to get a Microsoft program called VirtualPC.  I believe they no longer sell that.    --Rick|`|D7Rv7RNkaa	With the Intel-based Macs you can now run Windows on them using Boot Camp, Parallels, or VMWare Fusion. PowerPC was not capable of this.

If so, the here is a solution  - Put the student name (Which equals the sheet name of his courses) in cell B4  - In cell C4, the Course name  - Assuming you have the list of assigned courses in column C in each students sheet  - In D4, paste this  =IF( ISNA(MATCH( C4, INDIRECT( B$&"!C:C"),0)),"Not assigned", "Assigned")    Then fill it down after putting next student/course name in cells B5, C5 and etc      Mail me here for more info or if I didn't get you well    VBAXLMan is here to fill your Excel needs|`|ytl2PONXaa	Example:    You should have the people's names running down column A.    Then on the other columns, put the course name and whether it is assigned.    E.g. A1|B1|C1  NAME|COURSE1|COURSE2    A2|B2|C2  JERRY|YES/NO|YES/NO    Then on the if formula, have it run down the entire columns of B and C on the next sheet.    On sheet 2(or whatever sheet it is) write in B3:    =IF(!Sheet1$B$3="yes",A3," ")    On Sheet 2 write in C3:    =IF(!Sheet1$C$3="yes",A3," ")    On that second sheet the name will be assigned to the space.    Just make that sheet 2 name list into a table so that after you get the names listed, you can organize them so that there are not any blanks between the cells.     This should make it better and hope it works.

Simple example which can be modified to suit your needs. this example assumes a simple movie clip with an instance name of progressBar_mc that has a graphic shape in it, and a dynamic text field named percent_txt with a couple of static text fields for the rest of the text.    var downloaded:Number = _parent.getBytesLoaded();  var total:Number = _parent.getBytesTotal();  var percent:Number = (downloaded/total) * 100;  var percent_txt:String = Math.floor(percent);  progressBar_mc._width = percent;  if ((downloaded == total) && (downloaded > 0)){   _parent.play();  }    Put this code on the first frame of the preloader movie clip and on the second frame add this code: gotoAndPlay(1);    Make sure  progressBar_mc and percent_txt are inside the preloader movie clip on other layers.

If you are going to create your website: 1- Buy a domain name.

Save's about 50-80% using compatibles over genuine ones.    HP and other printer manufacturers will obviously tell you to use the over-priced genuine ones because it is in their interest.    There are plenty of places to buy cheap HP 22 ink online - just google it and check the sponsored ads down the side.

I don't have HP ~ but do have a very good Canon ~ when I got it, a supplier told me straight that I would have no problems with compatible ~ after two ink heads went in three months, Canon took it back, and told me that it was because I was using compatible ~ their original ink jets where a different "ink" to those used in the cheaper ones, that the machine "heats" the ink up to a slightly higher temp which the cheaper jets couldn't handle ~ so now I always buy the originals.    You may well get away with only using black and white, but if you are going into colour for photographs, then you really should get the original HP jets to be sure ~ in the long run, it's a hell of a lot cheaper than having to replace the "head"

ogN9nWGMaa	That may not be so good because physical ram does not just double itself without help. There may be a reporting error that points to something like a configuration problem. How are you reading your ram? Does it all say the same? Use Direct X Diagnostics to read your card RAM properly. Does 8400 GS PCI Slot refer to your Graphics card or do you have integrated graphics in which case its eating half your main memory and is definately not so good.  I know this may not be an answer but then you didn't really ask a question. Did you?

WRITE THIS PASSWORD DOWN.  IT'S TOO DARN EASY TO FORGET IT WHEN YOU NEED IT AGAIN.  4.Click OK.  5.Enter it again.  6.Click OK.

zorYTX59aa	YouTube has totally changed the rules for how to place images  on to your channel page. Your photo or image can no longer be  a direct link from a website, nor can you insert its URL.    At least you don't have to worry anymore about making sure its  length is less than 64 characters and that it begins with "http://"  otherwise YouTube refused your image without any explanation.  It just left you wondering: what could have possibly gone wrong.    1 -- click on "ACCOUNT" just beside the  at the top of a page   (you'll get a new page with black titles and many blue subtitles)     2 -- click on "EDIT CHANNEL", the 2nd blue title on the far right  (you'll get 3 different blue subtitles, including "Channel Design")    3 -- click on "CHANNEL DESIGN"  (you'll get a new page with nine colour combinations at the top)    4 -- scroll half-way down, and look for "BACKGROUND IMAGE"  (it's the 2nd thin rectangle, with the "Browse" box just beside it)    5 -- click the "BROWSE" button  (the image must now be on your computer and less than 256K)  (the option below asks if you want the image once or repeated)    6 -- click on either "YES" or "NO"  (if your image is too small, you should consider clicking "YES")  (you can always easily change it again any time that you want)    7 -- scroll back up to the top and click on "UPDATE CHANNEL"  (it's on the gray stripe, just above the nine colour combinations)    If you want to double-check it for yourself, here is the complete  URL site of YouTube's help reference, followed by its direct link:    www . google . com / support / youtube / bin / answer . py ? hl = en & answer = 71515  http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bi...

2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	Huh??    Yes, you can use standalone graphics cards on that motherboard- any PCI-Express video card is supported.    The nForce 790i isn't a video card, but a chipset which is built-in to some motherboards.  Not the Asus P5N7A-VM, though...  That motherboard has the nForce 730i chipset.    SLI means a motherboard has two PCI-Express video slots for running dual Nvidia cards.  Again, the Asus P5N7A-VM is not an SLI board, it has one PCI-E x16 slot, which means you can only install one video card.

838TBllwaa	Seems to me that it's going to be going in an infinite loop because you havn't finished the win section, so I don't see what exactly you are asking here. You have 1 loop that you have shown, the while loop in your main program. The test parameter for this while loop is the bool value win, which is set to false at the start of the program. You have no way shown in the program to set win to true, so the loop will continue indefinitely. You need to test for a win, and if a win happens, set the value of the bool value win to true, at which point the loop will exit.    EDIT: Alright, so I ran your program, and I see what you mean by loop. Your problem is that on each iteration of your loop, you do the following:    bool plr1 =1, plr2 = 0;    So the effect is that on each iteration, it is player 1's turn. To fix this, it is generally good practice to keep declarations outside of loops, so that they don't occur more than once. Move this statement above the while loop and it will fix it.    Your second problem comes in your switch statement. Your compiler thinks that your cases are integers, rather than characters. To solve that, change the case statements to be in this form:    case '1': ...stuff here...    That should fix your program.|`|qd07w2eQaa	Yup a very important rule to keep in mind when using loops is that the work done in the body of the loop must always eventually set whatever statement is used to terminate the loop (in this case, "win") to true, otherwise you will get an infinite loop for sure.|`|AA11706045	while(!win)   always true    send me an email, i got some tictactoe code for you to see :)|`|WS95be3Raa	Now it would be a good time to learn debugging.|`|5jfO0jMlaa	Well, if win is never set to 1, then how do you expect it to exit the while loop.  Finish your win section and then it should work, unless there is another bug
tOCESHLYaa	Any of these programs will remove anti-virus 360 from your computer.  Free programs  SuperAntiSpyware  Malwarebytes Anti-Malware  Paid   Norton  Kaspersky|`|5jMNBO2naa	Antivirus 360 is a rogue anti-spyware program that uses false scan results and aggressive advertising in order to promote itself. This rogue is advertised by the Vundo Trojan and is replacing the Antivirus 2009 rogue program that Vundo has been aggressively advertising. If you are infected with the Vundo Trojan you will see a large amount of pop-ups stating that your computer is infected and that you should install Antivirus 360 in order to protect yourself. If you click on the ad, Antivirus 360 will be downloaded to your computer and you will be prompted to install it.    Once installed, Antivirus 360 will be configured to start automatically when you start Windows. Once started, the program will perform a scan, and when done, will list a variety of legitimate or nonexistent files as infections that cannot be removed unless you first purchase the program. What is so dangerous about these scan results is that the files that Antivirus 360 states are infections are actually legitimate Microsoft files, that if deleted, will cause Windows to become unusable. Therefore, if someone believes the results from this program they may manually delete the files thinking they are infections and cause their computer to no longer function. Some files that it states are infections are:        C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe      C:\Windows\System32\alg.exe    While running you will also see a constant barrage of false security alerts stating that your computer has a variety of security risks. These risks range from files being modified to private data being sent to a remote host. These alerts, though, are false and are only being shown to further scare you into thinking your infected, when in fact the Antivirus 360 program is the actual infection. Unfortunately, these alerts coupled with the Vundo Trojan will affect your computer's performance and you will notice that it begins to operate slower.

eN9l2Vxvaa	Microsoft Vista with its Ready Boost feature uses your USB 2.0 flash drive's memory as an additional disk cache to speed things up.    A system with 512 MB of RAM (the minimum for Windows Vista) can see significant gains from ReadyBoost. In one scenario, ReadyBoost sped up an operation from 11.7 seconds to 2 seconds (increasing physical memory from 512 MB to 1 GB reduced it to 0.8 seconds.    The recommended amount of flash memory to use for Windows ReadyBoost acceleration is one to three times the amount of random access memory (RAM) installed in your computer|`|lLiQzJjBaa	ReadyBoost uses the flash drive as essentially extra RAM, thus providing more speed.

FFRhS6Axaa	Hewlett Packard laptops are the number one brand sold in the United States.  I own one, and it has been amazing in performance.  The customer service is also great.  Toshiba is also a very reliable brand.  Asus makes exceptional laptops as well.  They are not a widely known brand, but Intel (the guys who make computer processors) own 40% of the Asus company.  I also have a Asus laptop which is a great machine.  Those three would be my top recommendations.    Macs are exceptional laptops as well.  The new aluminum Macbook laptops are made of all recyclable materials, and Apple never lets a customer down when it comes to customer service.  They are very user friendly and easy to adapt to, but will cost you much more. ($1299 and up)    I work in computer sales, and from my experience acer, Compaq, e-machine, and dell tend to have more problem than any other brand.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	I have an old Toshiba that I gave to my mom about 5 years ago, it's runnin 98 and she just uses it for dial up internet, I've had 2 dell and both of the internal fans have gone out.

When firefox is open click on the Tools link at the top of the page and select addons, select get addons and search for adobe flash and install it.  If that doesn't work you will have to download the program from adobe. I believe suse uses the rpm type files (package manager) and yast as the package manager.   The first link explains how to use yast. If you are going to be installing more programs it would be a good idea to keep this tutorial handy.  Good luck

There are lots of good gaming laptops from Toshiba, Asus, Acer, the Rock, Eurocomm, Falcon Northwest but those begin at $1000+.

WOW will also be fine on anything that has a video card. Although since this is a cheap laptop don't expect to be able to play games in good quality. Since all the games you want to play are oldish, they should be fine on any laptop. The only problem is you really can't find a good video card in a laptop under $900-1000.   http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...  This laptop should be able to play anything old for sure. I do advise you though that laptops are not meant for gaming unless you are willing to spend money.

When a person creates a chat channel on mIRC you don't have to put a description for it. Which means, there's no way to search for a channel specifically by age group.    However, I would suggest checking out this site: http://seniors-site.com/index/Message+Bo...      Alternately I would suggest googling "senior citizen mIRC chat channels"|`|6rR7LTl1aa	Last I knew, IRC chatrooms aren't sorted by age, and don't have an age tag (unless the administrator of a given network has done something special to set one up).

3T6wvAamaa	Raster scan     A raster scan CRT works much like a television set. Light occurs when an electron beam stimulates a phosphor.  Phosphors are inorganic crystalline materials that convert electron energy to light energy. They consist of a host material of high purity and one or more added materials called activators (see "Phosphors"). The electron energy beam is swept horizontally across the phosphor. After each sweep the beam is moved down an increment and swept across the phosphor again. After the bottom line is swept, the beam returns to the top and the sweep process begins again.  Symbols on the display are made by turning the beam on and off as it sweeps over the phosphor. At close range, this can be seen as a series of horizontal lines on a television set. As the electron beam sweeps over the lines, its current is raised or lowered to generate the correct luminance level for that specific part of the picture.  Some CRT raster scan VDTs are television monitors with added electronics. The system to which the VDT is connected provides the signals that would otherwise come from the antenna.  VDTs are not constrained by television standards. They need not operate at the same refresh rate or have the same number of lines or have the lines in the same places. Refresh rates on some raster scan VDTs may be much faster than on television monitors. Resolution also may be different. A CRT-type VDT need not use the same number of sweep lines, nor do the sweep lines have to fall in the same pattern as on a television set. The refresh technique may also be different.  Display types  This CRT generates symbols on the display by the guiding the electron beam over a path that forms the character. The beam writes first one character or symbol, then the next, and so on until the last symbol is written. Then it repeats the cycle.  Storage tube CRT  This CRT has two electron guns within it: a writing gun and a flooding gun. The writing gun charges the areas of the image that are luminous. The flooding gun then provides a flow of low-energy electrons over the whole storage surface. There is a secondary emission of electrons in those areas that were previously charged by the writing gun. That secondary emission causes the phosphor to glow in those areas.  Plasma panels    Plasma panels are two edge-sealed layers of glass separated by a thin layer of neon-based gas. There are horizontal conductors (wires) on one glass layer and vertical conductors on the other. When a voltage is applied across the intersection of a horizontal and vertical pair of conductors, the gas at the intersection becomes ionized and emits a spot of light. All the conductors may have a sustaining voltage applied to them that keeps the spot illuminated after the higher voltage causes the spot to glow. The sustaining voltage may have a high frequency, refreshing the dot several thousand times a second.    Liquid crystal displays    A liquid crystal is an organic compound in a transition state between solid and liquid forms that resembles a liquid in viscosity and a crystal optically and electronically. The most important optoelectronic type is the nematic system.  The nematic system consists of structured, molecular units that are commonly visualized as rods (having a long dimension several times the length of the smaller dimension). The direction along which rods align is called the director. The optical and electrical properties of the material differ in the plane along the director and in the plane perpendicular to it.  The molecules interact with the surface that contains the liquid. In a panel structure, the surfaces are prepared so the directors align in a single direction in the plane of each surface. In a typical design, the director is aligned right to left at the back plate and up down at the front plate.  Light is polarized with a film having fixed rod-like molecules and introduced into the back plate. The film polarizes the light in alignment with the back plate director. The director rotates through the cell, rotating the polarization 90 degrees. An analyzer polarizing film, aligned with the direction of the front plate director is placed between the viewer and the front plate. The light freely passes through this aligned film. Zero voltage gives a bright appearance.  The director in the liquid crystal is subject to a force proportional to the square of the applied voltage. When a voltage is applied, the directors rotate into a position perpendicular to the surfaces. In this situation, the light passes through the material with no effect on the polarization. Since the rear polarizer and the front analyzer are crossed (at ninety degrees), the light is blocked.  Two patterns of transparent conductors cross to form individual picture elements. The effect can occur at each intersection. This permits high content displays to be made.  A display unit based on this effect is called a Liquid Crystal Display. These displays can operate by reflecting room

Web caches reduce the amount of information that needs to be transmitted across the network, as information previously stored in the cache can often be re-used. This reduces bandwidth and processing requirements of the web server, and helps to improve responsiveness for users of the web.    Modern web browsers employ a built-in web cache, but some internet service providers or organizations also use a caching proxy server, which is a web cache that is shared between all users of that network.|`|AA11631715	temp file?

Alot of people still tend to rely on the operating systems own firewall to help prevent intrusion and windows defender (on Vista) to help prevent viruses.  This is not recommended and i would suggest that you purchase a copy of an anti virus program like Norton.    Some Internet Service Providers like BT do provide a free copy of an anti virus program usually Norton or McAfee with the broadband package which can be installed (if yours does I recommend that you download it).  Once you have the anti virus program install it and allow to update itself.  Once this is done do a FULL SYSTEM SCAN to check for viruses, spyware etc.    This should cure the problem, if it doesn't then please supply more info regarding your pc make, model, self built, operating system (XP or Vista) and the age of your pc.

zorYTX59aa	If YouTube is slow, stuck or weird, and people suggest you  either change, install or get stuff....DON'T TOUCH A THING.    Please dont tinker with your "Java Scripts", "Flash Players"  or different browsers -- and definitely stay away from any of  the software that salespeople (disguised as answerers here  on Yahoo) are trying to sucker you into buying.    None of those things will help you because I am pretty sure   your computer and YouTube were working fine before, right?  The first rule of thumb and ideal option should always try to  be: DON'T disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter,   add, change or install anything. Matters will only get worse.    Several times each day, YouTube shuts down a few of their   servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time.   That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios:   bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few   hours or by the next day.    If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet   files" and RAM (sometimes known as "cache") are close to  the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result   being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to   a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way;   or C) never even make it onto your screen.    "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get   permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in   a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them -- or "clear your   cache" of "temporary internet files", "cookies", and "history".  Then reboot.    Note 1: if you have Google Web Accelerator (or something  similar to it), dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it;   -- do all that you can to get as far away from it as possible,   even though this contradicts all my advice. Not only does it   conflict with YouTube, simply clicking on "Don't Accelerate   This Website" will not help you whatsoever.    Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales   pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are   really disguised salespeople and peddlers. Their "solutions"   have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of stupid   answer is:....[my paraphrase] "Although you can't watch or   access videos properly, buy our downloader."    Note 3: a peculiar fix that once worked for me was altering   the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|FTvkahKWaa	Try refreshing the webpage    or...    Turn off web accelerator, if you have one - it may be conflicting with youtube.    or..    It could be due to slow connection or high traffic.

You may have air getting in thru the holes at the top - best thing to do is take the cart out and wipe it clean and dry - then seal the holes with some tape over the top. That should stop the ink flooding thru.    The messing up of the colours is probably due to the fact that too much ink is being released at the nozzles and they are flooding into each other.    Try above and see if that improves the situation|`|MxculX2Daa	The holes are where the refill ink goes in.    Buy genuine HP carts from ebay.

Kompozer is pretty good and free:    http://www.kompozer.net/    These type of editors let you design your web site on screen on your own computer and it does all the HTML code for you. You can then upload your website to your preferred web site host.    If you want to make some graphics for your web site, there are plenty of free graphics programs, try using Paint dotNet or TheGimp. Both free.    http://www.gimp.org/  http://www.getpaint.net/      I hope this answers your question. Please rate my answer if you found it useful.

Print out these instructions as we will need to close every window that is open later in the fix.    2. Download Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, or MBAM, from the following location and save it to your desktop:      3. Once downloaded, close all programs and Windows on your computer, including this one.    4. Double-click on the icon on your desktop named Download_mbam-setup.exe. This will start the installation of MBAM onto your computer.    5. When the installation begins, keep following the prompts in order to continue with the installation process. Do not make any changes to default settings and when the program has finished installing, make sure you leave both the Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware checked. Then click on the Finish button.    6. MBAM will now automatically start and you will see a message stating that you should update the program before performing a scan. As MBAM will automatically update itself after the install, you can press the OK button to close that box and you will now be at the main program.    7.  On the Scanner tab, make sure the the Perform quick scan option is selected and then click on the Scan button to start scanning your computer for Spyware Protect 2009 related files.    8. MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while, so we suggest you go and do something else and periodically check on the status of the scan.    9. When the scan is finished a message box will appear    10. You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the SpywareProtect 2009 removal process.    11. You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the Show Results button.    12. A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown as seen in the image below. Please note that the infections found may be different than what is shown in the image.      11. You should now click on the Remove Selected button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.      12. When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.      13. You can now exit the MBAM program.    Your computer should now be free of the SpywareProtect 2009 program. If your current anti-virus solution let this infection through, you may want to consider purchasing the PRO version of Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware to protect against these types of threats in the future.    btw, Alex J and mikes links are bad (mywot is blocking those sites for some reason involving safety)|`|jUngHleiaa	Spyware Protector 2009 ( also known as SpywareProtector2009 ) is clone of Spyware Protect 2009 rogue antispyware software that displays many fake warning alerts, messages and popups.

tOCESHLYaa	One go to download.com and get a start up manager. They have some good free ones. Then use it to turn off programs that run at start up that you don't need to having running. There is probably more running than you would think. If you are running two anti-virus programs then that is a mistake. You should never run more than one at a time. If one is an anti-virus program and one is anti-spyware then it's ok. But still these programs may have conflicts. Kaspersky does not run good with several anti-spyware programs.

zJppAVbVaa	4Mbits is fast enough.  You really only need 1Mbps and 384kbps upload.  4Mbit will be beneficial if you download game demos from the PS store.    For gaming, upload is more important.  Some peple would recommend a QoS router for your LAN, especially if you do a lot of P2P or Torrenting on your LAN or if you have more than two people on your LAN.

Try several different DVDs to see if problem happens with all.  If so, and problem recently started, try using Computer Help Wizard under Help and Support on the Start Menu.      If that doesn't work go to Laptop Manufacturer website and look at their problem or FAQ area, searching for DVD problems like yours.  If no luck, contact them online or email with detailed problem info.    It's possible you may have a bad DVD drive if the problem occurs on all your DVDs.
ds3GrGYeaa	The OSI model is a standard which gives 7 layers on which a network stack can be designed. TCP/IP model is the more practical way which the network protocol stacks are designed in most of the Operating systems.    The bottom two layers in the OSI model is combined to form the data link layer in TCP/IP model. The top two layers are combined to form the Application layer. Since the work of presentation layer is usually done by the application itself, a separate layer to handle presentation is not necessary.    In all other senses both the models are the same.

zorYTX59aa	If your YouTube is getting bombarded with "JavaScript" and   "Flash Player" messages, and people are telling you to get  or install something, DON'T TOUCH A THING.    You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java",   "Flash" or various web browsers -- and definitely stay away  from software that salespeople (disguised as answerers on  Yahoo) are trying to "sucker" you into buying.    None of those things will help you, because your computer   and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right?   The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add,   change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.    I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a   lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why   in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good   for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).    Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of  their own servers every single day without warning anybody,   in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions,   it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or   "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.    If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing   you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages,   it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet   files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.    "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get   permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay   there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer   much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of   them. The solution to that is to clear your "cache" of all the   "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" and "history". Then reboot.    Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it;   do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts   my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever.   (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)    Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales   pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are   really disguised salespeople and peddlers. Their "answers"   have nothing to do with your problem, and their wares may  worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of selfish answer   is that? [my paraphrase] "Although you cannot even watch   or access videos, buy our downloader."    Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|k4dQsHKkaa	javascript is usually turned on by default...so, it might be your flash player is outdated..    you can try a different browser...    these will help you...    1. Use Opera browser, it will load faster and smoother,  and re-install latest flash (the correct way)    get the latest flash player, and install it.. make sure all the browsers are NOT running during installation... this is the right way to install the flash player.    by the way, the javascript is turned on by default.    OR..    2. It could be due to slow connection or high traffic.  Try watching it during off peak hours, the video will be smoother.    Or you could watch it offline smoothly... try using 'zillatube' .    It works well - Just google search "zillatube" to get it.    ==========================???|`|x1FyqVKLaa	Which browser? IE?

The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???|`|ZjQszDwzaa	Probably you should convert you video to FLV format for uploading to youtube.|`|atPuxNiFaa	i have that problem to. u just have to wait for a long time it will eventually go. and if it doesnt work the first time try again  good luck  hope i helped

While we are on a roll with the imagining thing, lets just imagine that professionals get paid good money to break into systems and report their findings.    We could also imagine that a lot of legal documents might need to be signed in the presence of a notary and the above mentioned professional so that the professional wouldn't be legally liable for any losses or damage while the security system might be compromised. After all, it is hard to remain a professional if you are stuck in jail.    We could also imagine that any security system has weaknesses. Why do I keep hearing the Mission Impossible theme?

But having those installed won't give you effective protection against malware.    Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups.

Gradually anti-virus and anti-spyware programs are getting pretty similar so, maybe, sometime in the future it'll be a problem to have both an anti-virus and an anti-spyware program running in real-time mode.    Most free anti-spyware programs don't run in real-time, they are re-active only: i.e. they don't stop the crap getting on, they hope to find and remove anything that gets on. Spybot has the Teatimer, which provides some measure of real-time protection. However, it shouldn't interfere with AVG free.
bcc4cde9f6a036cb7a8ccfa123bb2dcdaa	An interesting question, particularly as you apparently have a Mac.  Why do you even care about XP?  If you want to run XP on your Mac, then it will likely use more resources, as your system was designed primarily for OSX.      The real issue is what applications software do you want or need to run?  Then you decide! (Some useful apps will not run on Mac/OSX, and some apps that will run under both will run better on the Mac--and look better, too).  Most Microsoft apps will always be developed to run under Windows first, and then be later ported to Apple--sometimes with fewer features than under Windows.  etc.etc.etc.|`|oaQ8Tuhjaa	leopard is better than xp    and definitely vista

838TBllwaa	You would use == in the if statements above.     When you use = you are assigning a value to a variable. = is the assignment operator, and will always do this ( operator overloading excluding ).     == on the other hand, is a logical test for equality. It takes the statements on the right and left, and tests if they are equal. It becomes true if they are equal, and false if they are not. Any time you are running an if statement, if the inside must equate to true or false, and so you would use an operator that returns a true or a false.    As for breaks in loops, it's useful in places, but not incredibly recommended. It's usually possible to form a loop without having to implement a break. If you do want you use a break however, you just need to know how break works.     Wherever you put the break statement,  when the program gets to that statement in it's execution, it will exit out of the control structure that it was in ( in your case a loop ) and into the previous one. So you would put the break probably after some test to see if something happened. For example, you don't want to place break just anywhere in a loop, because otherwise it will come to that statement, and exit out of the loop on the first iteration, which means it wasn't really a loop. You might do something like this however:    if ( value == 10 )  break;    This would break out of the loop, but only if the value was 10. Of course the actually numbers and implementation of this will be different for every program, but hopefully this explains enough for you to be able to figure it out.|`|6LPts66haa	You would use ==    Explanation:    = is for assigning. The first one assigns 'o' to response, it does not compare it.    but == compares if response actually equals 'o'    And the breaks are only if you want to exit the loop. Breaks are not required in loops. When you want a loop to end before the } you would use break;    Hope it helps!|`|FdhRXFflaa	"=" is used to assign a value, ''=='' is used for comparisons. For conditional statements (like if else statements) you must use "==".    break is used to get out of a loop. This forces the program to get out of a certain loop when a condition is met. This is not very usual in my experience.|`|AA11706045	=  assigns a variable and == checks if that variable equals something.    you should use a break when you want it to leave the loops

db7c12ce76ff7d75c1b0331c96a016afaa	I hate this problem.    a 32 bit operating system can only address 4GB max.     But, some of that address space must be reserved for add on cards. Most notable here is your VIDEO card (other cards contribute, but it's mostly the video card because of the lsarge onboard memory).     In order to address your VIDEO card memory, it must map the VIDEO memory into that 4GB of space. If you have a large video card, that will eat into your memory address space and leave less for Vista to work with. Some are more efficient than others with the tricks they use to do the mapping.    All you can do is (1) get a smaller video card or (2) Upgrade to a 64-bit OS. Sometimes playing with some OS switches will help, look up how to use the /PAE switch.    try reading this:  http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archive...    or google for something like "can't address full 4gb in windows" for more explanations and fixes. But keep in mind, you might be able to get SOME back, but you won't get all of it without a 64 bit OS.|`|ZLmpH4dCaa	You can't.  Get 64bit Vista if you want to fix it.  A 32bit OS can only address 4GB of memory space.  Problem is your addin cards, like video card, require some addressable memory space as well.  Some of the OS's 4GB of memory space will have to be reserved for these addin cards leaving something less than 4GB available to address your System RAM.    There are 'hacks' like PAE but its only useful if you know what your doing and the programs you use understand it.  Don't bother you'll get no where.    Either deal with 2.8GB or buy 64bit copy and see all your RAM.|`|ykXzzx65aa	Yea, Vista 32 will only allow u to have a max of 3 gigs of ram|`|5jfO0jMlaa	Not quite sure on this, but i dont think that a 32bit os can use more than a certain amount of memory.

If you do wish to use all 4 GB, go for a 64-bit computer, make sure the CPU is compatible with it.|`|ebuxHnScaa	It may just be that that's how it's going to be. See the other answers for an explanation of why 32-bit Vista will never give you a full 4GB. But 2.8GB sounds very low. It's usually more like 3.2-3.5GB.    You may have a BIOS setting incorrect. For 64-bit operating systems, the BIOS tries to remap as much memory as possible to leave lots of room for low mappings. For 32-bit operating systems, the BIOS tries to leave is little low space as possible to fit in as much memory below 4GB as possible. If you have your BIOS set wrong, it's deliberately putting memory where your operating system can't get it just in case the operating system needs to put some large mappings below the 4GB cutoff later. (Some hardware requires these mappings.)    The most common name for this BIOS settings is "Memory Remapping". Turn it *off*.|`|mzo20dLSaa	it doesnt use all of it|`|m1ymxDx5aa	buy a new computter

Vw5hR0Pyaa	Many times I have stared at my computer thinking "How do I fix my pc because it keeps crashing?"  Unfortunately there is no simple answer! I used to think this problem was related to buying cheap computers but after buying various laptops and desktops at different price ranges there is one common theme, eventually they will all crash at some stage!   Friends will often think I am a pc expert and will call me asking "How do I fix my pc when it keeps crashing?" Well start by asking yourself these questions...  Have your children be on the pc? Kids are great at downloading spyware by mistake! They will also click on numerous pop up pages and will often change your settings!  Another possible reason your pc keeps crashing is that you have overloaded it! If your pc only has 64mb RAM memory and you install graphic, gaming and other software the chances are that your system will not be able to cope with your software! Most PC's now come with at least 512mb RAM so it is worth upgrading if your pc is not at this level.  However the most common reason that your pc keeps crashing is that it has a virus! Many trojan virus can cause your computer to reboot immediately once all programs have been launched, this can drive you mad and it is not fun as you are helpless!  Best option is to install anti virus software and make sure you only visit trusted websites. If all else fails it is time to reformat your hard drive and wipe your pc clean, this can take hours and you will probably need the data recovery disc that you should have got when you bought the pc.

It should work fine.  Microsoft is mostly concerned about the license code and not was CD is used to install.|`|PSVy9ZCpaa	If you have an "Activatable" copy of winxp installed on your computer and the CD key from the original installation.  You can copy any xp cd (same version as you already have) and using your cd key, repair or reload xp from scratch.  The media is generic, the CD Key is specific.    Good Luck
