20090227103556AAhLM3R	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Question About Overwriting .exe Code & File Size Changings - C/C++?	Assume i have 4KB .exe file & opened it by any standard function on C++.      1. lets say i want to overwrite "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx", where x represents IP address. These x's are 15 bytes max. Anyhow, it could be less. So when user inserts lets say "12.44.120.31", its only 12 bytes, so 12 bytes will overwrite 15 bytes, what about the 3 bytes left? If its left there, the 3 bytes will corrupt the new inserted IP, thats what forces me to move all data to temp file. Otherwise, i would just overwrite on the fly. I will use circular buffer to read the file         2. I don't have knowledge about Big O's & Analysis of Algorithms mathematically. Its very interesting, i will have to take courses for it. Anyway, as a professional developer do you really use it in a real life?

I have a Lenovo Thinkpad with a built in wireless card that I bought a few months ago.  Since I bought it, it will not let me automatically connect to the wireless network in my apartment.  I went into the network properties and clicked "automatically connect to this network," but when I restart the computer I have to manually connect again!  Then when I go into properties, the "automatically connect" box is unchecked!  And if my connection goes down for even a second (which happens frequently, especially in my living room), I get completely kicked off and I have to go back in and manually connect again!  Please help, this is VERY frustrating!!!

20090309185822AA8GVst	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Why is my computer rebooting?	I had the problem before, then I suspected my sound card (Creative Soundblaster Audigy 4).  So I just got impatient and reformatted my computer.  I've had the card for quite a while, but when I moved around a few things in the pci slots I think I must've bumped it or something, so I thought it must be shorting my pc when it tries to boot the card.  So reformatted, and worked just fine.  Decided to try the card out again because well I like using my 5.1 speakers.  So I put in the card and get the newest drivers online, and all that stuff and it messes up, but does not reboot my system.   I uninstall the card, and take it out of my computer entirely and I have the same problem.  It seems any time I open quicktime, zune, or the settings tab in display properties my pc decides its a good time to restart suddenly.  I don't even get a BSOD.   I have a dell b110 if that information is needed.      Thanks,

I have this :   EMACHINES ----- Pretty much totally upgraded I've added and changed:      The video card -- NVidia 7950 GT 512MB   The RAM ---- 2GB single channel I believe 444mhz DDR1   The CPU Intel Pentium 4 3.4mhz   Don't know about the power though it doesn't have any PCIEx6 connectors for graphics cards or SATA power cables      The motherboard is old I think it's a ATI Radeon Xpress 200, not too sure though      Overall it's really old, at least three years, but I've been upgrading it. Also the Hard Drive is really small only 80GB It's has WINDOWS XP HOME so this is back when the computer you bought didn't automatically come with VISTA installed...      is it time to upgrade? Or buy a new PC altogether      I mainly play games on my PC, I'd like to be able to play Crysis and The Sims 3, mainly those are the two main games right now, so should I upgrade or just scrap this PC altogether?

Also whenever i click a link on google it opens a new tab and takes me to random search sites all linking to "windowsclick.co.uk" and the link takes up almost a whole page of Notepad.      Also its stopping me running antiviruses. i managed to run AVG 8.0 and it found lots of Heur2's and hidden drivers which they removed but on boot it would replace them please my computer is running really slow and its annoying me.      Also the System Process is running at 62,000k.   I saw on a site that i could be a rootkit infecting my "winlogon.exe" so yeah...      Average_Joe

Also, holding down the power button for a minute or resets it and it turns back on fine after crashing. I have no idea what it could be, but there are most certainly no viruses. I already ran a scan with Trend Micro.    Help would be HUGELY appreciated. Thanks in advance!

I am getting way less search results, my downloads always stop in the middle to "connect" or are "stalled", and take longer in general.  I can't search by album anymore, which was always a great way of doing it...these are only a few of the major disadvantages I have noticed compared to limewire 4.  Minor ones being:  not being able to highlight my words in the search bar very well at all, the way that active downloads are displayed, skins don't work, the "super really advanced" options which have no documentation because if we aren't programmers we apparently can't read, friends - who ACTUALLY tries to make friends through p2p programs - this isnt facebook.  I'm sure there are many other things wrong with it, I have only been using it for 5 minutes.  I am also currently paying for the PRO version.  Looks like its time to start dedicating my funds to a megaupload account.

20090309202211AA0e92k	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Printers	Would printing in gray conserve black ink as opposed to printing in black-only, or is it the same?	I'm in a unique situation.  I just refilled my color ink, but the magenta is not printing, so I'm left with just yellow and blue.        I don't want the yellow and blue ink go to waste, and I want to conserve my black ink as much as possible, so I was wondering if printing grayscale would serve my needs.  I have a few hundred pages of black and white printing to do, so I thought I could print these documents in grayscale.  I ran a test page and the grayscale has a little tinge of green, but it is acceptable.        So again, "IN MY CASE", would printing in grayscale use up my yellow and blue ink, and conserve my black ink?

This should be a simple thing to fix for anyone good with AJAX/Javascript and ASP.net. I'm trying to send a variable to an ASP.net page named variable and return the value to the current page. Here's the Javascript code to look at:       var blog_id = 1;       var url = "comments.aspx?blog_id=" + escape(blog_id);       xmlHttp.open("GET", url, true);       xmlHttp.send(null);      On the ASP.net page, I have the following:   Dim blog_id As String = Request.QueryString(blog_id)   Response.Write("The blog ID is " & blog_id)      The ASP.net page properly communicates with the main page but does not print the blog_id. All I see is this:   The Blog ID is      The ASP.net page is not properly collecting the blog_id variable. Note, I've also tried without the escape function:    var url = "comments.aspx?blog_id=" + blog_id;      How can I pass this variable to the other page? What am I doing wrong? I've tested the blog_id variable with the alert function to check it's value and it's declaring right (it's actually be passed through a function) and it works right up until I try to pass it to that page!

20090309213144AAalCi3	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	When I'm playing games on my PC sometimes they mess up and everything turns random colors?	When I'm playing any recent game, sometimes it will randomly flicker all green, then ALL the graphics will mess up suddenly, and the ground looks like the matrix, and the sky looks like a map, and my HUD looks like some random color code mixed with some weird code. The ONLY thing that will fix it, is if I minimize the game, then bring it back up, then PRESTO, everything back to perfect, but eventually it'll mess up again in about 30 mins or so. I've replaced my video card and the computer STILL does this. I'm  leaning toward it being my memory, but i'm not sure if that could be the cause. I have the latest drivers, direct x, and everything etc.

See, a while ago, I looked up something on the internet. I put "Define: (then I typed the thing I was looking up). And something came up, explaining it, and it turned out to be a not-so pleasant thing.    I have Mozilla Firefox 3, so if I enter the word "define" in the bar where you'd put site names, it shows a scroll-down list, and the not-so pleasant thing is there, showing that I looked it up. Even though I didn't know what it was at the time, I sure know now, and mom, being worrisome as she is, will think, if she sees it, that I have been looking up dirty things, which I wasn't, I just didn't know what the thing was.    Is there any way to erase the fact that I've looked up anything leading to that site or is there any way to delete the search from the drop-down menu? Help please

20090309222803AAVKg73	Computers & Internet;Software	What is the fastest DVD burning software that uses GPU/CUDA?	I have a 9800GT and would like to use it to burn dvds   I have Roxio easy media creator 10, I like it a lot and it has many features.       My only problem is that when I get a movie ( 90 mins. .AVI format )   and try to burn it to a dvd. it takes almost the whole 90 minutes of the movie to only encode the thing. Then comes the burning part which is not that bad.      Is there any program out there that is made to use the GPU more than the CPU? I know it would be a lot faster due to the amount of parallel processes it could do. I have been looking through forums left and right with no luck.       Badaboom is the only thing I found and all it does is convert to MP4.      Will burning a movie in MP4 format be a lot faster than a movie in AVI?

20090310013403AAtsqFv	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	My computer is freezing up, any ideas?	I just recently (one week ago) put together a new computer. This is my first build and everything was going smoothly until it completely froze while I was playing Spore. I couldn't do anything other than power off and reboot. I'm running an Intel Core2 Quad 9400, Vista Home premium 32 bit, I have 4GB of RAM, a 500GB hd, and an ATI Radeon 4670 gfx card at 512 MB. This should be more than enough to run the games I play, or at least I think it is. I have only played Spore and Sims 2 thus far. My cpu and gfx card are running cool, all of my drivers are up to date, I have Vista set to basic and I don't have a virus. Could it be Vista hogging my RAM? Should I upgrade to 8GB? Any advice would be helpful, thanks.

I am contacting you on a business transaction of a huge sum of money   from a deceased account,though i know a transaction of this magnitude    will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I'm  assuring you that    all will be well at the end of the day and this is why am  contacting    you due to the urgency of this transaction.       We discovered an abandoned sum of (Seven million five hundred    thousand United States dollars) in an account that belongs to one of    our foreign customer who died along side with his entire family, and ever    since his death none of his next of kin or relations has come forward    to lay claims for this money as his heir.       We cannot release the funds from his account unless someone applies for   claim as the next of kin to the deceased as indicated on our banking   guidelines. And upon this discovery we now seek your permission to have   you stand as a next of kin to the deceased in which all documentations   will be carefully worked out by us for the (Seven million five hundred    thousand United States dollars) to be released in your favor as the    beneficiary's/next of kin to the deceased. And It may interest you to    know that we have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate    any of the deceased beneficiary.       Kindly acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of   our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the   following;       1. Beneficiary name and contact address.   2. Direct telephone and fax numbers.   3. Date of birth and occupation.       These requirements will enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate    departments and authorities for necessary approvals for the release of the    funds in your favor, before the transfer can be made to you. And we will be    compensating you with thirty percent of the total funds on final conclusion    of this project, while the rest will be for us and for investment purposes.    And If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of the    trust we have bestowed in you.       NB: If you are willing to assist me, including the information's i have   requested from you, call me on my confidential tel: +871-764107753 for   further details on what to do next.

20090310001510AAfyLKW	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Easy C problem, but I'm confused?	Based on the solution of assignment #2, using exactly the same computation to determine the grade, write a program to compute the grade for a class of students. To indicate that there is no more scores; use a negative # as the first assignment score.   If assign. #1 score is negative; your program should terminate without the need to read in the rest of the scores. However, for this assignment, it is acceptable to still require input for other assignment scores if assignment #1 score is part of ONE input statement for all scores of a student.      In addition to compute and report the grade of each individual student, output a summary report showing the total number of students, and the number of students receiving each letter grade.      No credits will be given if the program contains any   compile-time or run-time error.   Remember to comment your program, uses meaningful variable names,   Have good indentation, echo-print your input, etc.      Grading scheme:   If the first assignment score for a student is O.K., then   Normal computation if all other scores are within range   If any other scores are not good, then do not count that student (ignore the rest of the score). It is also acceptable if the program repeats asking until all good scores are obtained, in that case, you have normal computation.      Maximum point Deductions for programs that can execute, and give correct answers:   1. require to input the total number of students to control the loop 10   2. keep asking whether there are more students to control the loop 2   3. A sequence of if âs (not using else ifâs) 5   4. does not check score between 0 and 100 10   Minimal acceptable program: if any input score out of range, output an error statement and ignore the student.   Better solutions are also acceptable.   5. Minor mistakes in getting the Wrong answers for grades (A,B,C, etc.) 10   6. Minor mistakes in getting the Wrong counts for grades (A,B,C, etc.) 10   7. comments, indentation, prompts, etc. 20         that is my assignment and here is my finished assignment #2.      #include     #include        /*   **************************************...   * Author: Robert Dunlap   * Source: grades_earned.c   * Purpose: To computer the 7 grades from a student, give them the correct    * weight and then give them a final grade in character form   * Date: 02/08/2009   **************************************...   */      int main()   {     int asgn1, asgn2, asgn3, asgn4, test1, test2, exam, a1good, a2good, a3good, a4good, t1good, t2good, egood, asum, tsum, esum, fasgn;     float weight1, weight2, weight3, allscore, score, i, fsum, n;     char grade;                   //asks to enter in all the grades of the student (meaning input)                  printf("Please enter four assignment grades, two test grades, and one exam grade for each student:\n");      printf("Enter first assignment grade: ");     scanf("%d", &asgn1);     printf("Enter second assignment grade: ");     scanf("%d", &asgn2);     printf("Enter third assignment grade: ");     scanf("%d", &asgn3);     printf("Enter fourth assignment grade: ");     scanf("%d", &asgn4);     printf("Enter first test grade: ");     scanf("%d", &test1);     printf("Enter second test grade: ");     scanf("%d", &test2);     printf("Enter exam grade: ");     scanf("%d", &exam);     //now to make sure grades are within the appropriate range will will declare parameters from 0 to 100.     a1good=asgn1>=0&&asgn1 =0&&asgn2 =0&&asgn3 =0&&asgn4 =0&&test1 =0&&test2 =0&&exam =74)       {         grade = 'B';       }       else if(score>=63)       {         grade = 'C';       }       else if(score>=52)       {         grade = 'D';       }       else if(score<52)       {         grade = 'F';       }       else if(score<0)       {         grade = 'N';       }     printf("grade=%c\n", grade);     system("pause");     return 0;   }

Sexy little avatars staring at you in skimpy clothes and provocative positions luring you to click on the ad. Is this some twisted kind of propaganda? I mean, some people may find it okay, but I'm sick and tired of seeing these. I think they've made these things purposefully like this so more people will click on them. And besides, no matter how cool IMVU is, to get really cool stuff you have to pay, and its simply teeming over with perverts and pedophiles.

20090310014832AARwpVE	Computers & Internet;Security	Help! My computer is being ravaged by viruses?	Hey my computer is being ravaged by two viruses:    1. The sujin Virus   2. An unknown one but ill give you a brief description: I was chatting to some friends on MSN and one of them said (i reckon through a virus) is this a picture of you? and it contained a link to a website. Upon entering the website i was asked to download the picture which i said yes to. Also i downloaded a song from frostwire which i think helped. So now my internet browser has messages at the top of it saying stuff (obviously from the virus) like "YOUR computer IS FULL OF VIRUSES. FREE ONLINE SCAN NOW! and other messages of that nature. Also, when i start up my computer it has messages pop up when i go into my profile like C:\WINDOWS\_DEFAU~1.PIF invalid program file name, please check your pif file. chose 'Close' to terminate and if i close it shuts down my computer! any help greatly appreciated and its also disabled my Virus Checker so this is a toughy any help is great!
