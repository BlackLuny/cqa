I've been wanting to try it for a while, I make a mean spaghetti sauce, as well as a bow-tie pasta dish, but I want to make it healthier.  I've seen the various whole-grain pastas out there, but I'm concerned they'll taste sweet or weird and kind of ruin a good tomato sauce.        If you've tried it personally, what do you think? Will it hold up to a robust sauce, or is it better for something like alfredo.  Does it alter the taste much?

20090307172943AADsLpx	Food & Drink;Entertaining	What should I do after the party went down in flames?	I threw a birthday party just the other day and it really didn't end good. Ok so here's the full story. I invited about 20 people. There were boys and girls. The party was going great at the begining. I was still running around the house getting stuff ready. People arrived and talked downstairs. Well only about 11 or so people came. There were 5 boys and 6 girls that came i think. I thought the party was going to be great and every one was going to have fun. We waited for a while for people. I started a game and we played that for a while. Then opened gifts. After that it was down hill. Half of the people wanted to talk and half of didn't. I was really getting mad. Well i was trying to think of stuff to do My really good friend was talking with one of my other friends who was helping me control the party and well I went to my room calmed down. came out saw her face and well she was on the edge of tears. I ended up crying that night and 5 people stayed the rest left. After that I had fun with that many people. What I want to now is should I still hang out with the other people? What should I do?
