20090309131535AAQbIEg	Pets;Dogs	What breed of dog should we get?	My husband and I live in a one bedroom apartment. He's a cat lover so we have 2 cats, but I've always wanted a dog. It would definitely have to be a small dog. Weighing no more than 25 lbs at full grown. We both work so the dog should be able to stay indoors for the day. We run everyday so bringing the dog along would not be a problem as far as exercise goes. I would love a dog that is very calm and loves to cuddle, but my husband likes dogs that are also willing to play around (chase him, catch a ball, play tug-a-war, etc.). It would also have to be able to get along with our cats of course. Believe it or not but I am allergic to cats and somehow have grown immune, but as soon as I hold them for too long I have an allergic reaction. Same with dogs. Their saliva in particular makes me break out. So we appreciate any suggestions you may have whether they be professional or not. Thanks!
20090309131607AAs2FwP	Pets;Cats	There's a Stray Cat at my House and he's very Sick?	Hi, we have many stray cats that we take care of and there was one we had for a long time that disappeared...Well, he came back after a year. The problem is, he has Feline Leukemia.      I'm not sure what to do about this. It's a horrible thing to happen. There's no cure for it, yet. I have no money to do anything for him. His lymph nodes have already begun to swell up, his eyes and mouth look horrible.      I wrote to the Human Society, but they haven't wrote back yet. What place am I suppose to contact for this sort of thing? I don't want him to die a slow and painful death. I just want him to die in peace.      Please, if you have any information on where I could contact to get him help please tell me. I live in Bunker Hill, West Virginia if this helps any.      Thank you.

I had not been in all day but had been with them the evening before and they were fine, all squeaky and cheeky as always. They were eating as normally, and had not been out in the garden so the only food they ate was what I had given them. I'm still in shock, and worried that what ever killed them might spread to my other guineas.   If any one has any ideas please let me know. I feel so bad, what if it was something I did. What could have killed them all quickly and at the same time?

Even the 2 places I found online that have them are out of stock.        Do any Americans have a blue acara? How did you get it? I'm going to ask my LFS but they never get me what I want. Its always something close but not it. Like one time I asked for them to order more pit bull plecos. The guy said I will order a red fin/rusty pleco. I was like no they get too big I want the pit bull it is perfect. Sure enough he ordered the rusty instead. This pet store only get like 2 or one of a type of fish.       Do you think petco or petsmart would order fish for me?       Anyways can anyone help me out here.

20090309132412AAy9mVR	Pets;Dogs	Will dog attack their owner?	If you buy a baby Rottweiler and raise it from 8 weeks and treat him very well. When he reaches 2-3 years of age and if you are the pack leader and  you hit him/cause pain to him will he attack you or just yelp and put his head down showing that he cares about you but doesn't like what you are doing? Note this is just a question to determine the loyalty of a dog. I would never hit a dog no matter what so don't take this question the wrong way. Not only Rottweiler we can include guardian breeds like shepherds and dobermans. Im just looking for a dog that has that sort of loyalty that would die protecting my family if its needed just has I would do the same for him. And never question the owner.

Hello:      Yesterday we bought 6 angelfish from our local pet store.  2 small 2 med and 2 larger ones (although not full grown adults)  The two mediums seemed fine until this morning when one of them started darting around the tank and then sunk to the bottom...dead.  I thought strange but new envioronment, difference in water, etc = stress.  Then a few minutes ago, the second one did the SAME EXACT THING.  Both were pearls.  They are in a 75 gallon tank that has been established for over a year.  Had a red devil in it but moved him into a different established tank last week and decided on angels for this tank.  I have never seen this behavior before and so sudden.  Swimming around seemingly fine...then spaztic swimming and down to the bottom.  Water...0 ammonia...0 trates/trites...hardness 7.8.  They all had a bit of fin rot but nothing crazy and treating with aquarium salt and raised temp to 80 from 78.  Any ideas..I am so concerned about the others now  :(  Thanks

20090309145545AAw7mXy	Pets;Fish	My cats ate all my goldfish flakes, I have 8 goldfish to feed.?	I have a 55gal which 8 comet/common goldfish are housed temporarely. The range size is 9"-1". They got into the cupboard that holds my goldfish flake, opened the container (which was broken because it had fallen and I had stepped on it, so the lid didn't realy "hold". They ate all of it but a few crumbs. I threw the rest of the crumbs in the goldfish aquarium, which wasn't much.    I have pond bites, which are little balls that only the 6-7"+ can fit in their mouths. That's three of the eight that can eat off of the big flakes, the rest can't. So I grabbed about 7 of the flakes and crunched them up with a container on a napkin and threw them in the water. Is that OK for them, including the little ones? They ate some of it, the ones they got to before it sank. (they normally float, but since they were crushed they didn't.       Are my cats OK? The only ones I would think ate it was Habika and Charlie, my 8mo. olds, which had eaten it in the passed. I am trying to keep the food locked away from them, but they got into it again.      Ideas?   anything else I can feed them?   Can they live off of a diet of pond pebbles, tomato, cucumber, and things like that? What else can they eat?
20090309144017AANmX8q	Pets;Dogs	Have you used Aveeno oatmeal bath treatments for a dog?	My dog has severe allergies - most likely to food. He's been on a downward spiral for the past month and he is now on prescription ultra-low allergen food (z/d), Temaril-P, and Douxo calm shampoo and spray. It's been a rough ride so far, but we now have to ride out a food trial for 3 months without expecting any improvement in the next month or so...      Anyway, as I was driving home from the vet's today I remember that when I had a serious reaction to penicillin a couple of years back, the only thing that kept me from scratching my skin raw were aveeno oatmeal baths. This dog's skin is so irritated, so red and lumpy and he cringes at our touch. He's so miserable that he lies on the floor and shakes like he's freezing cold - something the vet attributes to the severe generalized itching and discomfort. Can I use Aveeno baths on a dog? I think the effect would be faster than the Douxo spray and it is not toxic in any way.      Any advice?      P.S.: I know all about holistic premium food and I hate Hill's as much as anyone else, so please don't tell me that this is all a food change away from a cure, ok? Been there, done that. At some point, when your dog is giving up and losing all its hair, you kind of have to trust your vet.

I'm thirteen years old and I really don't have a say in what kind of food I can give my dog, and lately I've been noticing quite of a few things, my shih-tzu is very sluggish, she walks like the pads of her feet are irritated (she doesn't look like she is in terrrible pain but instead uncomfortable), red spots all over her body, she is constantly licking her paws, and scratching her self all of the time (she does not have any fleas) she loses wieght then all of a sudden gains wieght. My parents purchase purina: beneful, what are some good quality pet foods I can tell my parents about?      On a side note I also have a cocker spaniel, he too eats the same food. He has a terrible ear infection that comes and goes, and that's the only real health issue we have with him.....Our vet (who is pretty old) said there isn't anything really wrong with our pet's food and that we could change to Science diet or Eukanuba. Are these good pet food brands?  Any helpful advice would be greatly appreciated.      Edit: Even though I groom my shih-tzu she always has a bad body odor, what could this possibly be?          Could these symptoms also be because of the pet food?

20090309152314AA0CvIl	Pets;Dogs	My dog with kids...thoughts?	I got my dog last June when he was 4 months old. He has been very well socialized to the world, he LOVES dogs, loves cats and loves people in general. However, he has not been socialized around children. I do not lead a life where I am around children on any kind of regular basis and I don't have any friends with children either.      I made sure when I got him to immediately get him comfortable being touched everywhere, feet, mouth, face, tail, etc. He has never once grumbled at me for touching him, nor anyone else.      However, I don't know how he is with kids. Right now it's not really an issue, but sometime down the line I'll probably want kids. Dogs who have issues with kids...is it basically purely about not liking to be groped all over the place? Or is there something innately about kids they don't like?      There was a 7 year old at the dog park yesterday and he went up to her and seemed fine, she even reached down and squeezed him tightly, with no reaction out of him except excitement. I'm going to be trying to make more of an effort to get him around some children, but do you think it sounds like he would be okay? Or could I only judge it by seeing him with them.

20090309152545AAbnjNa	Pets;Dogs	Dogs and Allergies...?	I'm bringing her into the vet this week. Just looking for others with this experience:      My dog constantly chews on her back paws. Like REALLY chewing: frantic, hard, long and does not like it when you try to get her to stop. She rarely if ever licks or goes after her front feet, and never licks or seems itchy anywhere else.      She does have dander though...      Could she be allergic to her food? We feed Canidae and she gets a little bit of rice, chicken, and two carrots per day (not all at once and we feed less kibble to make up for the additions.) Occasionally she gets pineapple.       I do not notice an increase in the chewing after feeding these things (either in that day or the following days.) She went after her feet even before we added the chicken/rice/carrots to her diet.      Would food allergies only affect TWO feet? Anyone have this happen before? The vet suggested before that is was something she walked in but it's winter (no fertilizer) and we don't walk often on the streets (due to dangerous conditions.) If we do i wipe her feet off after.      Any idea?

I would like to make her a little slide show with some pictures and a song to help her remember him by. I know it will probably make her sad, but sad in a good way. There is not much I can do for her except this so could someone please show me a website where I could do this because when it comes to this kind of stuff, I'm completely clueless. Also, if anybody knows any encouraging words I can give her that would be greatly appreciated.       http://i465.photobucket.com/albums/rr18/...

She has become aggressive toward our male neutered dog and we have had to separate them. Could she be being aggressive toward him because she is going into heat? We are not sure if she is going into heat but she showed no aggression toward any female dogs just the male dog.      Thanks for any information.       Oh and would getting her spayed make the aggression go away or will they now always have a issue with each other.
20090309162224AAggc6I	Pets;Dogs	How bad is it to get two puppies at different times, in terms of territorial issues?	My best friend and I plan to move in together soon. She wants to get a Shih Tzu of her own. I want to get a Chocolate Labrador myself. Up until yesterday, we planned on getting the Shih Tzu first and then waiting a little bit to get my lab.      Yesterday, a mutual friend of ours said that it would be bad to get them seperately because the dogs could get territorial [we both want male puppies by the way]. My bestie and I had not thought about that up until that point.      How bad would it be to get the dogs as we planned? Because if we get them at the same time, it'll be double the poop and pee and it could affect the bonding and the potty training and all of that.      what do you think is best?

Animal control found them, and had to put the mom down.  Sophie was only three weeks when she and her litter mates were taken away from her mom.  I adopted her at 10 weeks old. She use to be kept in the house, but only until she was about five months because my dad refused to keep her inside! Now she lives outside with my other dog whom she continually pushes around. She also chases cats. She respects me and listens to me MOST of the time, but i just want her to listen to me completely, and to stop her from chasing the cats and being so pushy. She is now 11 months and is spayed! HELP ME!!!

20090309171515AAT8wXF	Pets;Horses	Rain Damaged Saddle? Worth it, or Not?	I recently got offered a great deal on a Stubben Seigfried jumping saddle - the perfect size for me and an absolutely beautiful saddle that should fit most of the horses I work consistently (except a Belgian draft ;D). I've heard great things about this model, and I know it's probably worth it, but it has one flaw...      Some of the color is a little bit messed up from rain damage, NOT the leather, I would not consider buying a saddle with too much damage. The damage is purely aesthetic, but I am looking for a show-quality saddle, and would like to know if this problem is fixable. I already own a nice schooling saddle that I am perfectly happy with, so if no leather care will help with this problem, I probably won't buy the saddle (as much as I love the idea, I really don't need another schooling saddle, and I could easily obtain a slightly less nice saddle with a better look for about the same price)

20090309175037AAOm2g7	Pets;Other - Pets	Can my rabbit have free range of the house inside?	My rabbit is only 10ish weeks old and I am noticing that she is actually pretty well behaved!  I have taught her from the moment I got her home what is right and wrong and she also has very quickly learnt that her litter tray is where she is meant to wee and poo.        During the weekdays I work all day so while I keep her indoors,  I also keep her locked up in her 2 storey hutch.     While there is plenty of room,  it breaks my heart locking her in there as I know how happy she is to run and play around the house.        On the weekend I tested her out and I went out during the day and left her to it,  she looked so peaceful laying under the couch that I didn't want to disturb her.   Anyway, 3 - 4 hours later,  I returned and although she may have moved in the time I was out,  she was back under the couch when I showed up.  Nothing was damaged,  her litter tray had been used and she was happy and content lounging in her favourite spot in the house.        Do any of you have house rabbits that you just leave to it?

20090309174812AA0P7n3	Pets;Cats	My cats ears are bleeding?	I recently discovered that my cat has earmites, she has coffee ground looking substance, I assume is dried blood, in both ears.  She has been shaking and itching her ears frequently.  I tried cleaning them out with mineral oil/vitamin E mixture on a cotton ball-a natural home remedy I was told to try by a Vet intern.  However, after trying that unsuccessfully for a few weeks, the dried blood was still there.  So I went to the store this afternoon and bought an OTC Ear Mite treatment, followed the directions and put 3-4 drops in each ear, massaged and wiped with a cotton ball.     Immediately following I noticed that the cats ears were bright red inside now and when I wiped with a cotton ball again to make sure non of the medicine had come out from the shaking, her ears are bleeding fresh blood as well as the dried blood.  Nothing on the package says that this is a side effect...why are her ears bleeding fresh blood??

Can I legally train dogs in virginia if i am 14? i have a HUGE dream to be a dog trainer. I've made all my flyers, business cards, signs and my calendar (did i move too fast?! i tend to that ALOT its one of my weaknesses). do i really need a lisence to call myself a "dog trainer" is it illegal in virginia. i also don't think i am the right age. im ONLY 14. I have always loved animals.I was inspired by Victoria Stillwell and her show "Its Me or The Dog" as well as by Cesar Millan and his show "Dog Whisperer" i have all the books written by both of these people and have numerous books on dog psychology.Can i call my thing a Business without having a permit? I really don't want to interfere with the LAW!  also do i even need a permit, i have had numerous answers saying i do and ive also had alot saying i dont unless im doing like bird/duck hunting and the dog is going to retrive my kill (which i would never do duck hunting! poor animals imma vegitarian =D....) But can i be a proffessional dog trainer or just a trainer if my parents get me the insurance i need. or if i get it myself? i mean i already have a dog walking buisness and people give me tips which i put in the bank after a while wont it be enough for some sort of insurance? Also If i can be a trainer if i get insureace or my parents do or they get the buisness lisence (im not sure if they can dot hat..... can they?) would i be allowed to be a trainer or does me being a trainer at my age interfear with the child labor laws on virginia...which i dont understand because i can be an employee at the snackbar and my public pool and i get paid, i just have to take a 4 hour class before the snack bar opens. so i dont know how the child labor laws work. =\      My family has 4 dogs ive trained them all, they are all great dogs, and i have made it so everyone in my family is their pack leader which was tough there is 7 people in my family. I have also helped some of my friends dogs with their barking. biting, counter surfing, begging and even with recall. so far ive done okay. a couple times even i gave the dog a massage and my friends parents have said that they never saw their dog so relaxed the dogs almost fell asleep in my hands. also do you have any recomendations for fences... an 8 pannel fence is like $300.. i dont know if this thing ive had a dream for will even work so i dont want to spend 300 dollars on a fences... any ideas on how to make my own? i love carpentry i built all my dogs their dogs houses and ive made 2 chairs in my room, and a bird house. any ideas...       people also judge my strenth they dont think im strong and i walk all 4 of my dogs at once. they range in weight from 15-58 lbs. one time even at the rescue thing i volenteer at the owner said i was really strong, i worked with a tough tugger for 4 hours and never once asked anyone to hold her, she was 48 lbs. if i had a chance i would have worked with her but i like to work in quiet ares... they said that you couldn’t hide in the isles of the store so i couldnt work with her.       If i call myself a dog trainer is that the same or different as a professional trainer?      I think I dont understand some deffiniotions in their legal terms. I am 14 and i can train a dog basic commands and tricks and other stuff too, so i think of myself as a trainer. Because i CAN train a dog to do something.       Lets say someone i know gets a cut, if i put neosporin and a band-aid on it i consider myself to be a doctor. i know i dont have a medical degree and i never went to med school but i aided the wound therefore i think of myself as a doctor.       Can i call myself a dog trainer even though i cant get a lisence. Im not calling myself a proffessional trainer just a trainer or even a trainee. is that ILLEGAL?Because to me if i can train dogs to not bark or to act correctly when nervous or if i can train them recall or the bacis commands or to pick something up and bring it to me i consider myslf a trainer because i trained the dog to do something. Now if I want to pass on my ability to train my dogs onto other dogs in my neighborhood by teaching them the same things if i dont have a lisence because im not old enough is that LEGAL or ILLEGAL?       i hope you understand what im trying to say.          Thanks for all your help and kind words, and please if your just gonna get mad at me and tell me to stop asking these questions then please dont leave anything at all. I just want to know as many ways to work with my comunity and work with dogs and train them if its LEGAL for me to do right now.      please dont get mad at me for asking similar questions for the fifth time now, i just want to know if it is legal and then i want as many other options or choices of things i can do untill i can get my lisence. thanks :D         R
20090309174646AAeY1UX	Pets;Reptiles	Is it normal for my turtle to sleep on his side?	I recently bought a turtle (Ok technically a Russian tortoise that is the size of a turtle) and for the past two days his favorite spot seems to be in between his water dish and the back wall of his tank, where there's maybe 4 inches of space. He can't fit there on his stomach so he sort of crawls over the side of his water dish and ends up sideways in the crevice...and then falls asleep there. Is this normal? Is there a specific reason he is doing this? Is it like he's hibernating since he can't burrow more than a few inches or is he just weird?

We try getting her to stop but we're not sure how. She just keeps doing it and I feel so bad because she cuts herself and we can't figure out how to stop it.   Also, she tends to chew on her paws sometimes. Does anyone know why or how we can get her to stop?   Please help, I get so scared that she's going to seriously hurt herself one day.

It's so bad, i can take my two fingers, and pull of 50 pieces of hair!      Is something wrong? Or is it the winter coat going away?    And if something is wrong, what is it?

20070710202032AAbOqtJ	Pets;Dogs	Bulldog yelping, cant find where the pain is?!?	I am taking my bulldog to the vet tomarrow as soon as they open however, thought maby someone could shed some light into whats going on with him. He was fine yesterday, today, i got home from work, let him out of his kennal and he was walking funny, almost low to the ground?.. he started yelping a little every now and then like he was in pain. i checked all his body parts and he didnt seem to have any painfull spots. he runs around just fine, like usual, but when he tries to jump up, or put his feet up on the couch he cant get his front feet more than a few inches off the ground without yelping. anyone have any advice??? any ideas???
20080327205914AAyX86x	Pets;Other - Pets	Can horses react badly when throwing a shoe?	Hi, I am a beginner rider and have just bought a 15yo Thoroughbred Schoolmaster.  He loves people, is very friendly and seems amazingly gentle.  All "horsy people" who have seen him agree he is perfect for a beginner.      I took him for a ride in our paddock today for the first time and after a few minutes I noticed he kept on nudging his left foreleg with his nose like something was bothering him.  I decided to get off and take him back up to the stable as I thought that something was wrong, or that maybe I was doing something wrong.  As we got closer he tried to kick out at me while we were walking.  I took his reigns again and kept walking him, it was a fairly steep part of the hill and he objected, broke free and bolted off and kicked out.  He then made his way straight back to the stable and stood quietly waiting.      That was when I noticed he had lost his front left shoe.  Do you think that losing his shoe could have caused this seemingly out of character bad behaviour?

I have a lion head, mini lop girl (weighs 3 pounds) and a netherland dwarf girl (weighs 1 pound), both about 6 months old.  Can they be housed together in the same hutch safely?  The hutch is large and has a rabbit run.  The larger bunny currently lives there and i'm wanting to integrate the smaller bunny.  We have had the lion head for ~4 months and the netherland dwarf for about 3 months.  They get along well in the rabbit run while I sit and play with them, but would it be alright to move them in together?  Rabbits are naturally social and I want them live in the hutch together if possible.  Thanks!

20090309174423AAzH97X	Pets;Reptiles	Need help finding or building a turtle basking platform.?	My girlfriend and I are trying to buy or build a basking platform that fits with our turtle tank setup.  We are using a 45-gallon plastic storage bin for the tank, and we need a platform that we can somehow attach to the sides.  The plastic shelf we attempted to use was too light to stay still and too smooth for the turtle to grip.  The turtle (red-eared slider) is almost a foot long and too heavy for the popular store-bought floating platforms, so I was hoping someone would know how to construct a platform that could support the turtle, be easy for the turtle to climb into, and be able to be affixed to the sides of our plastic storage bin (it's a Sterilite, if that helps).
