20090222145416AAA4pR5	Dining Out;Other - Dining Out	Do You Ever Take Your Shoes Off In A Restaurant or Store & Put Your Feet On Top Of Your Shoes?	I was waiting outside in the seating area for a table to eat at after church with my family. I was wearing a nice dress, and a pair of high heeled thong sandals. I put my toes over the thong straps.        A hostess, waitress, or whatever (I don't know her job) comes up to me and says "You got only one warning. Put your shoes back on all the way or we're going to ask you to leave."      It wasn't like I came in barefoot, or holding my shoes. My feet were not even touching the ground. I just had my toes out of the thong strap piece.      My bf's mom was pissed at hearing this lady yell at me. Then this lady yelled at someone else who was standing with one of their feet out of their shoes while paying for their meal.      So we went across the street to IHOP instead.      Does anyone else do this? Why do people take this so seriously? Someone putting their toes over their flip flops does not ruin the Chicken Kiev sitting in the oven at 400 degrees. Has anyone else been yelled at for this?

Did you pay for your meal? Did you finish your meal?  Did you kill the roach or did it get away? If you killed it, did you show the dead remains to the management? Did you leave a tip?
