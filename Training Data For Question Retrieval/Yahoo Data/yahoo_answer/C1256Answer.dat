If someone manages to build space elevators, I think commercial flights to the moon could happen a few decades after that.|`|KHSOVxViaa	I'll hedge and go 150.<br>  <br>  I think we won't get any mass travel in space (beyond sub-orbital lobs) until we have relatively cheap means of getting to orbit.  This will almost certainly mean Single Stage To Orbit (SSTO) technology, which means the whole spacecraft makes it up without discarding parts.<br>  <br>  The projected way of doing this is by flying most of the way, using oxygen from the air, then using rocket motors for the last part.  This means having engines that will cope with takeoff speed, hypersonic speed, and finally orbital insertions.<br>  <br>  There are are designs for such engines and spaceplanes in development, such as the Sabre engine for the Skylon spaceplane.  It's a very similar technology to what would give us hypersonic air transport, which will probably be commercially viable sooner than SSTO.  The engine starts off as a jet engine, changes mode to a scramjet, then finally uses internal oxygen tanks to act as a rocket motor.<br>  <br>  When it's easier and cheaper to get to orbit, then it will also be much cheaper to get to the moon and elsewhere.  This will likely lead to a significant permanent presence on the moon, at least part of which will be commercial.  When the technologies are mature enough and cost-effective, then it makes sense that tourism will be part of this commercialism.<br>  <br>  So, I reckon 40 years for hypersonic, 10 years for SSTO, 50 years for establishment of a permanent presence on the moon, 50 years more for affordable tourism.<br>  <br>  OK, very ballpark!|`|0i80jUKeaa	200 years|`|f3399027b56ee13ae52644ed29eca245aa	Moon ?

eQCsKq4jaa	The Big Bang is a cosmological (study of the universe and its formation- lots of theoretical physics) theory regarding the creation of the universe. It is almost universally accepted as true. Simply put, it states that a singularity "exploded" (but there was no true explosion just expansion). A singularity is infinitesimally small (a grain of sand or so) but it had almost infinite heat, matter, and so on. And it is believed that space (the openness with no matter or energy) came from the singularity.  And it was as dense as everything in the universe (all in a little "grain of sand"). Then it expanded and chemical elements formed and over a long time the elements formed galaxies, planets, everything. And  the universe is still expanding.|`|2lQ8DJAcaa	The most prominent scientific theory about the origin of the Earth involves a spinning cloud of dust called a solar nebula.

Since the first atom that sparkled in the darkness, had positive and negative then all of creation bears witness to that atom - that there is no positive without negative; there is no darkness where you cannot find light etc.. They’re companions of each other<br>  <br>  So the scholars and scientists, who talk about the, "big bang" theory, talk about chaos as though it was first. Well, they don't really know the root of all of this. Out of what seemed to be chaos, came order. This produced motion.<br>  <br>  Taught us that the first law is motion. How can you produce motion unless these opposites are present? With the positive and the negative charges, you produce motion. <br>  <br>  So out of what seems to be only chaos comes order. Out of darkness came light. Out of nothingness came everything. Out of death comes life. So then, in another sense, out of evil comes good; out of demon or devil or Satan comes God. Well how is that? <br>  <br>  "Was God Satan at first and then becomes God?  Not in that sense.  But the Qur'an says that the jinn came before the man. In my humble opinion, it means that this fiery spirit and temperament is seen in the infancy of development, where one must learn to control the emotions in order for the rational mind of a man to come forth and that includes the Bible . <br>  <br>  That motion may appear chaotic at first but then the second law comes into existence, which is order. If you look at a baby, they want immediate gratification for the change of a diaper; for the bottle or for whatever they have a desire for. So they cry.  If you don't attend to them right away, you will see in the baby their cry, demonstrating an emotion that makes their face to become red with the flame of anger. So in the development of the human being, we go through these stages. <br>  <br>  <br>  Well, what about God? What about the making of a God?  If we are created from God, then the adversity that He went through, to evolve into Himself, shows us the path of all things to come to that point or place in development that God intended. <br>  <br>  "So, what's called "chaos" serves order|`|stAeoUeSaa	If you truly understand quantum mechanics then you will know that the Big Bang theory requires a creator by fiat. Think of the universe in reverse until it's small enough to be completely described by quantum mechanics alone. In order for the universe to start unfolding into what we see now, our universe's specific wave function had to be brought into existence as a certain possibility out of an infinite number of other possible wave functions that had to collapse or at least decohere. At this fuzzy nanoscopic beginning, this required a 'Prime Observer' to enable this and set the expansion of the universe into motion and those initial conditions became the very facets of physical law.

The carbon atom has 4 valence electrons and forms a double bond with each oxygen atom, meaning all of the electrons are involved in bonding. As there are no non-bonding pairs, the shape is not even distorted, or bent, and remains a perfect 180 degree line. The s and p orbitals of both atoms overlap to form an sp hybrid.

AA12350771	1. Diameter ratio is 6:12, so the ratio is 1:2. <br>  <br>  2. Surface area of a sphere = 4 x Pi x r^2.<br>  So Sphere A = 4 x Pi x 3^2 = 113.097<br>  Sphere B = 4 x Pi x 6^2 = 452.389<br>  <br>  Therefore the ratio is 1:4.<br>  <br>  3.

For any increase, in length or radius, the increase in surface area is x squared (x^2) and the increase in volume is x cubed (x^3). For example, when length is doubled (i.e., x = 2) surface area is quadrupled (2^2 = 4) not doubled, and volume is octupled (2^3 = 8) not tripled. Similarly when length is tripled (x = 3) surface area is increased ninefold (3^2 = 9) and volume is increased twenty-sevenfold (3^3 = 27). The increase in volume is always greater than the increase in surface area. This is true for cubes, spheres, or any other object whose size is increased without changing its shape.|`|sRvHkvJ2aa	1. 6:12 = 1:2<br>  <br>  2.

The ratio of the surface areas is not the same as the ratio of the volumes because surface area is dependent on the 2nd power, whereas volume is dependent on the 3rd power.

The density of the gas is primarily dependant on the mass of the number of protons and neutrons in the atomic neucleus, and this is doubled for diatomic gases.|`|wJTsifugaa	If you use the ideal gas law, PV = nRT and rearrange it, you'll find:<br>  <br>  n/V = P/RT<br>  <br>  n/V is moles per unit volume and the weight is just the number of moles times the molecular weight in grams per mole. <br>  <br>  So, since the molecular weight of the monatomic gas is 1/2 that of the diatomic gas, the density in g/L of the diatomic gas (O2) would be twice as much.  That being said, there is little chance you could get a stable volume of monatomic oxygen, it would readily combine to make O2.<br>  <br>  Update:  I beg to differ with Mr. Trevor.  The density is defined as weight per unit volume.  Take the weights he has given for each gas and divide them by the STP molar volume of 22.4L and you have the density!  Now the moles are constant (as shown in my equation above), but the density depends on weight.

Hydrogen is in the alkali family, and everything directly below it is too.  This means that even though it is a larger atom, the atoms below it only continue to only have one electron in their outer shell.  However, when you move right, the S and P sub shells begin to fill up, thus more elecronegativity increases.|`|Dd9m2ze1aa	answer:<br>  <br>  first a definition of electron negativity <br>  it is the property of an atom to lose electrons from its valence shells and form positively charged ions(cations)<br>  <br>  as we move down a period we know the size of an atom increases.<br>  this means that the no. of shells in an atom increases.<br>  also this means that the valence electron has a greater distance from the nucleus which has both neutrons and protons. <br>  <br>  so it is much easier for the shell to lose its electrons as they inter atomic force of attraction between the electron and protons is greater.<br>  <br>  therefore losing the electron is easier and does the electron negativity also increases
ThYN1mFFaa	First understand that a semipermeable membrane means that some things can pass through while others can't.  Usually the BIG things can't get through, and small ones can. So, in your experiment you have water (small), glucose (small), starch (big) and albumin (big).  Thus, you should expect the glucose to leave the tubing, until equilibrium is reached.  The starch and albumin should not exit the tube, but water should enter the tube by osmosis to dilute these substances inside the tube.  The presence of a bug should have no effect on the movement of glucose.

Try drinking cold water while you're studying. it actually keeps you more awake than drinking caffeine. Also, try to take breaks every 15 minutes. Your brain best remembers the things you start off studying, and you finish studying.. so the middle time is kind of wasted. (hopefully that makes sense?) So take lots of small breaks, (2 minutes each) and just walk around, or surf the internet, etc. I also try to have some health foods on hand.. so that when I'm feeling bored and like I want to quit, it can help me stay awake without having to worry about a sugar crash.

xXOnjDNOaa	Disiloxane means that the compound is composed of 2 units of a silicon-oxygen based compound.  Siloxanes are generally chains of  -O[-Si-O]-  with 2 side groups connected to the Silicon.  in this case disiloxane would mean it's Si - O - Si, and the substituted part means that there could be a number of things attached to the Silicon groups (they each have room for 3 more bond other than the oxygen).

DRVSCxKpaa	Kumo- is quite correct.  Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles.  If you compress a gas, what you are doing is forcing the molecules closer together.  there are more molecules in a givenn volume; so the kinetic energy increases, and the temperature rises.<br>  Let a gas expand, and the molecules move further apart.  Although the molecules might still be travelling at the same velocity, and each molecule might still have the same kinetic energy it had in the compressed state, , there are less per volume; so the average kinetic energy is less.  The result is that the temperature drops.<br>  The drop can be quite dramatic, as in the case of gas escaping from a compressed cylinder.<br>  <br>  edit: this is how a heat exchanger works: compress a gas, and it heats up.  Let the temperature of the compressed gas come to equilibrium with the surroundings. Then let the gas expand (say, INSIDE your refrigerator).  It cools down.  Then pump the cooled gas outside again and compress it ...|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	It's an endothermic reaction. As the gas is at high pressure, it is quite hot. As it is released, the pressure inside the container drops, leading to reduced temperatures.|`|WVPYem5Vaa	When a gas under pressure is allowed to expand, the original amount of heat present will spread out over a much larger volume. In effect, this causes the temperature of the gas to drop. Because of the high pressures gases tend to be under, the temperature drop will be extreme enough to cause water vapour to solidify to ice on the vessel.|`|wJTsifugaa	This is called the Joule-Thompson Effect.  What is happening is the molecules in the compressed gas have an attraction for each other.  So when they are released to a lower pressure, it takes energy to break those bonds.  The only energy available is the heat energy of the gas itself, so the the gas cools.  This cools the vessel, which causes water to condense and freeze on it.  <br>  <br>  This is the same principle used in refrigeration, used in refrigerators and air conditioners.  Compressed gas is expanded to a lower pressure and the cool gas is used to absorb heat and then put it outside in a continuous cycle.

R0Ogy5qlaa	The answer is that sometimes it's true and sometimes it isn't.  <br>  <br>  A significant part of higher level analysis deals with whether limits can be interchanged.  Since derivatives, integrals, and infinite series are all defined as limits, this covers all questions about whether limits, derivatives, integrals, and infinite series can switch with each other.  <br>  <br>  Here is a case of two straight limits that don't switch.  Let f(x,n) = x^n, defined on [0,1].  When n goes to infinity, the limit is the function f(x) = {0 if x < 1; 1 if x = 1}.  But if you let x go to 1 first, you get 1 for all n.  So lim_{n -> infty} lim_{x -> 1} f(x,n) = 1 but lim_{x -> 1} lim_{n -> infty} f(x,n) = 0.  <br>  <br>  If that can happen with two limits, then, of course, the same thing can happen with any combination of limits, derivatives, integrals, and infinite series.  <br>  <br>  Here is an example where things can interchange.  A derivative can be distributed over a power series within the interval of convergence.  So, for instance, if we know that <br>  <br>  (1 + x)^{-1} = 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + x^4 - ...<br>  <br>  for all x with -1 < x < 1, then we can say that <br>  <br>  -(1 + x)^{-2) = -1 + 2x - 3x^2 + 4x^3 - ...<br>  <br>  for all x with -1 < x < 1.  The same thing is true for the integral of a power series.  <br>  <br>  Now you have found a legitimate example of a case where the limit at infinity cannot be exchanged with a derivative.  If f(x,n) = (sin nx)/n, then the limit as n goes to infinity is the zero function, which has derivative 0, but the derivative with respect to x of the function (sin nx)/n is cos nx, which does not have a limit, for most x, as n goes to infinity.  Bravo!<br>  <br>  You are on the road to some very interesting questions in analysis.  Here is a theorem to think about for homework.  If a sequence of continuous functions f_n converges *uniformly* to a function f, then f is continuous.  (Look up the definition of uniform convergence online.)  In other words, under the right assumptions, the limit as x goes to a number can be interchanged with the limit as n goes to infinity.  (My example above is not an example of uniform convergence.)  <br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to post more questions or send me an email.|`|poEJEuwNaa	I've only given this a cursory glance because it's late, but one thing that jumps out at me right away is that the right side is not really defined. You have a function of two variables, so at the very least you would need to use the partial derivative. If I have the chance, I will look at this again tomorrow to see if this is a fatal flaw, or if there is something else causing your contradiction.<br>  <br>  Well I came back to revisit this topic, and I see that "strange" already beat me to it. I can't add much to that, except to emphasize that the derivative of course is actually a limit itself, so his example of non-interchangeability (it that is a word) of limits applies directly to your example. Thumbs up from me.|`|401e0b603e98257a6483b0111f39f2c3aa	My intuition would be no. The derivative with respect to x is a partial derivative on one side and a regular derivative on the other. Partial derivatives and regular derivatives are defined differently:<br>  d/dx f(x) = lim(h→0) [f(x+h) - f(x)]/h<br>  ?/?x f(x,n) = lim(t→0) [f(x+td,n) - f(x,n)]/t<br>  <br>  You've already given a counterexample to disprove the statement, but this would be my guess at the explanation.<br>  <br>  RHS<br>  lim(n→a) ?/?x f(x,n)<br>  This is a partial derivative because you are taking the derivative of a function of two variables with respect to a specific variable, namely x.<br>  <br>  LHS<br>  d/dx lim(n→a) f(x,n)<br>  This is a regular derivative because the limit will produce a function of one variable, f(x).<br>  <br>  Hopefully you won't yell at me like you usually do.<br>  <br>  ----------------<br>  "What do partial derivatives have to do with it? The variables 'n' and 'a' are independent of 'x'. They are relative constants."<br>  First you say they are variables, then you say they are constants. But really you don't have a choice: n is a variable and a is a constant. This is due to the notation: "lim(n→a)".  In this notation n must be a variable and a must be a constant. Since x and n are both variables, you must take a partial derivative on the RHS.<br>  <br>  ----------------<br>  "'n' and 'x' are still independent of one another."<br>  Correct, but they are still variables. That is the key idea here. When you are differentiating a function of multiple variables, you must use partial derivatives.|`|rlfaVhlxaa	well look at a problem... <br>  lets say we have the function f(x)= x^3<br>  and say we want the limit as x--->3<br>  <br>  the limit as x approaches 3 will be 27.<br>  <br>  now lets take the derivative of x^3<br>  f '(x) =3x^2<br>  when x=3 we get 27.<br>  <br>  so i think your question is right. as the answer above me states, the exception is if the limit does not exist then you cant use this reasoning.|`|AA11217846	Only if f(x,n) is differentiable and continuous at n, and d/dx f(x,n) is continuous at n.<br>  <br>  Continuity is the key.<br>  Limits can only be "distributed" if the function is continuous.<br>  This is why limits are often used as conditions for continuity.<br>  <br>  Remember that if the function f(x) is continuous at n, then lim_{x→n} f(x) = f(n).<br>  Using this property of limits of a continuous function, we see that<br>  <br>  d/dx [lim_{n→a} f(x,n)] = d/dx f(x,n) = lim_{n→a} d/dx f(x,n).<br>  <br>  <br>  **********EDIT!!!*************<br>  Hmm. I see your point. I've only studied functions of one variable.<br>  <br>  But if you have a function of two variables f(x,n), shouldn't we be taking limits at lim_{(x,n)→(a,b)} f(x,n) ? <br>  (I don't know the answer to this question, that is just what seems logical to me.)<br>  <br>  I read through your example several times, and I see your point perfectly.<br>  <br>  Actually, now that I think of it, I'm beginning to suspect that d/dx lim_{n→a} f(x,n) = lim_{n→a} d/dx f(x,n) isn't true.<br>  <br>  In the left hand side, the limit operates on the function f. And in the right hand side, the limit operates on the function df/dx.  <br>  <br>  To say that d/dx lim_{n→a} f(x,n) = lim_{n→a} d/dx f(x,n) <br>  would be like saying <br>  5f(x) = f(5x).<br>  <br>  Very interesting question. Sorry I don't know more though.

This is one of the first major differences between the two. Mitosis takes place within somatic cells (cells that make up the body), while meiosis takes place within gamete cells (sex cells). As such, meiosis produces more gamete cells, and mitosis produces somatic cells. Mitosis is the process which is responsible for replacing dead or wounded skin cells. Mitosis divides a single somatic cell into two daughter cells, while gametes are produced in fours; more specifically, one single cell produces four daughter cells. <br>  <br>  The type of cell that each process occurs in also affects how many chromosomes that each mother cell has. Somatic cells can have either a haploid or diploid of chromosomes. The number of chromosomes in the mother cell are duplicated in the new daughter cells, so both mother cell and daughter cell have an equal number of chromosomes. Meiosis' gamete cells are found only with a diploid of chromosomes. The mother cell will then divide leaving its four daughter cells with a haploid of chromosomes. This is because the chromosomes of a female and male sex cell merge when the female egg is fertilized and thus the new cell (formed through fertilization) will have a diploid of chromosomes from which to build upon as the new organism develops. <br>  <br>  DNA duplication is also confused as occurring in both Mitosis and Meiosis. In one regard, this assumption is correct. However, this correctness requires that a person specify at which stage of meiosis DNA duplication occurs. DNA duplication occurs during S phase of Mitosis as well as S phase of Meiosis I. Meiosis II does not see the S phase and as such does not see DNA duplication.|`|83A2wa6zaa	in mitosis: somatic cell divides into 2 daughter cells having the same amount of genetic material es the mother cell. for that to occure cell has to replicate its genome before mitosis starts.<br>   in meiosis: germ cell as in ovary or testis divide into 4 cells each of them has half the genome of the mother cell. it has 2 steps meiosis one and 2,  good luck|`|F4YhxWIBaa	mitosis refers to the cell division of body cells while meiosis is the division of sex cells|`|ndFUTEXlaa	<a href="http://onlyin.has.it" rel="nofollow">http://onlyin.has.it</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website

EOqxenK9aa	I can perhaps relate to my own experience. In high school I was really into computer science, but not so much into calculus. You can do a lot of logics and other fun things with say linear algebra. I sucked at calculus, though. Never had a good feel for it. Integrating countless functions was just no fun... somehow.<br>  <br>  These days I find that basic understanding of things is way more important than a particular skill in something -- at least as it relates to maths. Any monkey can solve integrals if he/she is good at picking up patterns and has good memory. In the end it's like memorization of integral tables. Almost.<br>  <br>  But the deal is that if you understand what you are doing, you will be able to look for resources to help you out, to classify which resources are good and which suck, and generally to move in the right direction. And come up with ways to check your own work, etc.<br>  <br>  Then, unfortunately, some higher-level understanding comes from exposure to a lot of basic stuff. And also from getting good explanations that actually work along the way. A lot of "explaining" done by teachers in "early" education (high school/intro college) is plain wrong, or seriously confusing. Some of those teachers are not much better than their students in their understanding! That'd be OK if they had sooper-dooper students, but it's definitely not OK if the students are bad.<br>  <br>  Tips are: understand, don't skip understanding. If you understand, you can do it. If you don't -- you can't really. Don't be a cargo cultist (see reference). Don't do things merely by rote. Make sure that everything you do makes sense to you.<br>  <br>  Well, some things come from experience or "rote", like some basic equation transformations. Sometimes you see (a-b) in the denominator and you "know" that to simplify you multiply both numerator and denominator by (a+b). This comes from seeing that trick enough times. But there isn't all that much of rote.<br>  <br>  Even if you didn't know that trick, you'll end up solving the problem. You'll reason about what can be done to simplify the equation, and you will happen on that trick eventually. Maybe you'll run out of time on your exam, but you should pace yourself to get partial credit on everything, right?<br>  <br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd first try to figure out what doesn't make sense. Attack that, and attack viciously. Then you'll run into more murky things. Rinse and repeat. In the end you'll be pretty good, it will make sense, and you will succeed.<br>  <br>  The particulars of understanding differ between people. Some people are particularly good at extracting patterns from numerous examples. Those are the ones for whom doing lots of problems is a way to go, often. Some people suck patterns directly from the rules/theorems they read. Some people are a mix. Find out which one are you?<br>  <br>  I, for example, have particularly hard time digesting rules with no examples. I quite often come up with rules/generalizations/"laws" based on experience, but "dry" math taught in theorem/proof/theorem/proof ad nauseam just doesn't work. You may well be different!|`|7lpS0h7Paa	To achieve gud marks in maths, u need to concentrate on ur conceptual part. Try to conceptualize what is demanded from u in the question.

0124d04ea568166ef47684e1b0bc96a0aa	well, the only way your daughter can be color blind is if you are either color blind yourself or you have color blindness on your side of the family.<br>  <br>  Color blind is a recessive X-linked trait that is carried on the X chromosome. Since male are XY, effected males would be XcY. Women are XX, so they can by either effected XcXc or carriers XXc.<br>  <br>  In order to have a daughter, the husband donates his only X chromosome and the mother can donate either X chromosomes. In your case, your husband donates the effected Xc chromosome. Now, if you are a carrier, you donate either the normal X or the effected Xc.<br>  Then your daughter has a 50-50 chance of being color blind.<br>  <br>  BUT, if you know there's no color blindness in your family, then your X chromosomes should be normal XX. So that means your daughter is a carrier of color blindness, but not actually color blind|`|aaC2Qx1Uaa	The most common form of red/green colour-blindness is sex-linked.<br>  This means the gene is present on the X chromosome; so if a man inherits the "faulty" X chromosome from his mother, he doesn't have the corresponding "healthy" gene - because he only has one X chromosome, and he will always be colour-blind.<br>  Women, OTOH, must have *two* faulty X chromosomes to actually be colour-blind, because the normal version will compensate for the faulty one.<br>  <br>  Since your father is colour-blind, he has the "faulty" X chromosome - and since you are female (we assume :-) you must have inherited that X chromosome. Your other X chromosome (from your mother) is normal - so you are a carrier for the colour-blindness trait.<br>  <br>  Your husband, like your father, has the "faulty" X chromosome.<br>  <br>  What this means for your children is:<br>  - Your sons will always inherit your husband's Y chromosome (and not the "faulty" X), but will have a 50/50 chance of inheriting either your normal X or your colour-blind X, and will therefore have a 50/50 chance of being colour-blind themselves.<br>  - Your daughters will always inherit your husband's faulty X chromosome, but will have a 50/50 chance of inheriting your normal X of your colour-blind X, and will therefore also have a 50/50 chance of being colour-blind, or being normal (but a carrier for the trait).|`|CYtMRC4eaa	No, unless you're a carrier  But, if you have no colorblindness in your family, daughter will be a carrier.  (Unless the colorblindness is caused by some other genetic defect than sex-linked).|`|JTOZJH7Xaa	Is there any colorblindness on your side of the family?  If so, then the chances would probably be greater, but if not then I don't think she will be colorblind.  Hope this helps!

Humans will probably still exist on earth because we are a resilient species. We will be reduced to small groups of nomadic creatures roaming the earth for food. Maybe some will re-establish a small nation. Space travel will be nothing but a forgotten dream, and the planet will go on like always, day after day for thousands of years. Maybe then humanity will rise again to the challenge of space exploration and finally leave the earth in great star ships to populate the stars. The earth will sit and wait for millions of more years, occasionally being struck by asteroids and being reborn over and over as it has in the distant past.

The atmosphere will become a smothering veil of carbon dioxide 100 denser than today oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere with surface temperatures at least as high as those on Venus. The clouds will be made of concentrated sulfuric and other acids, just like Venus today. Long before then most forms of life will be extinct, and we will be gone as a species long before the Sun's increasing heat spells the beginning of the end for life on Earth. Then 5 billion years from now the Sun's hydrogen supply in the core will finally be exhausted. The Sun will then expand into a menacing red giant star and boil the atmosphere away into space, and turn the surface into a deep, global ocean of lava. Then helium fusion starts and the Sun shrinks and fades, but that is little help to the Earth because with a luminosity still over 500 times that of the present day, rocks will glow cherry red from the 1,300 degree Fahrenheit surface temperatures. When the helium runs out, the Sun will expand and brighten even farther than before, and Earth will melt under the onslaught of 5,000 times more Solar energy than it gets today. The Sun's envelope may expand enough to encompass the Earth's orbit, and if so the Earth will spiral into the Sun like a satellite too close to the Earth's atmosphere and vaporize inside of it. At this time the Sun's outer envelope will fly off into space to form a planetary nebula, and as it loses mass the surviving planets will move outwards away from it due to it's reduced gravitational attraction. If the mass loss starts before the Earth is engulfed, it will be left behind as a fused cinder that was once a life bearing planet. The Sun will feebly light the sky as a white dwarf, which has the diameter of the earth but half the Sun's mass, a parody of the life giving star it once was. Earth will be a dead planet whose surface will be as chilly as the cold of interstellar space replaces the inferno the dying Sun created. As humans, we need not lose sleep over this. If we manage to survive long enough, we would probably have the means to relocate to a younger star system or otherwise avoid the apocalyptic fate the Sun will mete out to the Earth and all life on it.|`|KvAqGXO0aa	Nuclear holocaust homes|`|Uiab4hSaaa	Evil alien invasion?|`|I8yeRWw5aa	In some kind of fireball, hopefully.

Only stupid triangle answers.<br>  <br>  There are couple of ways of finding the area of an equilateral triangle whose sides are 12cm each.  You could use Heron's formula:<br>  <a href="http://www.juliantrubin.com/encyclopedia/mathematics/heron_formula.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.juliantrubin.com/encyclopedia...</a><br>  <br>  But I think it's easier to just split the triangle down the middle into to 30-60-90 triangles.  If h is the height of the triangle, then notice that sin(60) = h / 12.  So h = 12sin(60) = 12 * (√3 / 2) = 6√3.<br>  <br>  This means that the area of the triangle is <br>  (1/2)bh = (1/2) * 12 * 6√3 = 36√3<br>  <br>  Now that you have the area of the prism's base, you can multiply it by the height to get the volume.

eQCsKq4jaa	D-Lysergic acid diethylamide (the D(extro) indicates that LSD is the right handed isomer of the molecule). <br>  <br>  Has a half life of about 5-7hrs. About 3hrs after taking the drug, peak plasma concentration is reached. This means that for most people 3hrs after taking LSD is when the body has the largest concentration of the drug. LSD is a "dirty drug," a term used in chemistry to describe drugs that impact several different neurotransmitters. Alcohol is another example of a dirty drug where as Morphine is one of the "cleanest drugs." The main neurotransmitter involved is serotonin. LSD will bind actively (when used at a recreational dose) to all serotonin receptor subtypes except for 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 (13 or so serotonin receptor subtypes exist). But most of LSD's effects come from the 5-HT2A receptor, also where some antipsychotics, where LSD is a strong but only partial agonist. A partial agonist will only partially activate the receptor. <br>  <br>  Glutamate (a stimulant of sorts) is released into the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is the part of the brain controlling (at least in part) memory, perception, thought, and consciousness. <br>  <br>  LSD will also bind to ALL dopamine and adrenoreceptor (adrenaline) receptor subtypes. This will also alter consciousness. <br>  <br>  LSD will also blockade the action potential (nerve firing) in a part of the brain. Thus the Cerebrum, Grey Matter, (involved with sensory processing- what you see, hear...) is basically shut off from serotonin (because serotonin can not move there without action potential). <br>  <br>  Never the less no one really understands how exactly LSD works and even less is known why it works through these neurotransmitters. We do know that some hallucinogens used recreational are naturally occurring in our brains and play an important role in dreaming. <br>  <br>  Really LSD just alters how our brain identifies things. Parts of the brain are hyperactive and others silent. Some areas of the brain are flooded with neurotransmitters but some places become a virtual desert. In effect, LSD is simply changing what parts of the brain work and which don't. <br>  <br>  LSD does not cause addiction or dependence and has been used as a treatment for addiction. One study found LSD to effectively cure 50% of alcoholics given the drug. The statistics for AA are a 2% success rate. However in fairness the 2% success rate measures the % of people who never relapse. More practically about 10% of AA people will be in full remission (in recovery) and will maintain that but might relapse 1-3 times. For most addicts the average number of relapses is 3.<br>  <br>  And speaking from a completely neutral pharmacological stance, LSD is a much safer drug compared to Heroin, Cocaine, Methamphetamine, alcohol, and even cannabis in most ways. And death is rare if not unheard of. It is also much more safe in overdose compared to other recreational drugs.|`|NQURVW9Zaa	LSD destroying your lifetime.LSD will destroy your mind and your reality...maybe your future as well..|`|oRamqEGyaa	nobody is really sure.

HxXduL1maa	There are a number of different ways to make glass soundproof. The first involves simply making the glass thicker. The thicker the glass is, the stiffer it becomes and, as a natural consequence, less prone to vibration. In such cases, sound is naturally reduced. Another option is to insulate the glass with some other material, or perhaps just put an empty area in between two panes of glass.<br>  <br>  A common material used in soundproof glass is some sort of lamination. A thin piece of plastic is often placed between two panes of glass, thus cutting down significantly on the amount of sound that gets through. As an added benefit, this soundproof glass also is extremely difficult to break, which provides some security improvements and is even used to meet hurricane building standards in areas prone to the storms. Using this method of soundproofing glass also helps keep the thickness to a more reasonable level.<br>  <br>  For those interested in soundproof windows, perhaps the greatest indicator of how much sound is actually reduced is the Sound Transmission Class number. This number, for most traditional, single-paned windows, will run somewhere near 27. For double-paned windows, it may be slightly higher, perhaps 28 or 29. Some makers of soundproof glass say they are actually able to achieve a rating of 45 or higher. While this may not sound like much, it means that more than 95 percent of all sound is prevented from getting through.<br>  <br>  To make soundproof glass completely capable of blocking all sound would be prohibitively expensive and likely not recommended for windows. The glass would need to be extremely thick and would be very heavy, perhaps overwhelming any material used in a typical window frame. The most common place to find soundproof glass is a sound studio, where it is important for music and other types of recordings to have a quiet environment. However, even then the glass is not completely able to withstand all sounds.|`|DRVSCxKpaa	Sound reducing glass is usually double-glazed; which means it has two layers of glass, with an air space between. the thicker the glass the better; because sound is absorbed by mass.  That is why a concrete block wall will transmit less sound than a styrofoam wall; even though the styrofoam has many air pockets.|`|92264b45a5319ea8117fdd9736e333bbaa	Place transparent rubber / soft elastomer  between two sheet glasses<br>  (sand witch elastomer) , heat cure the laminate.

And the answer is<br>  <br>  pi/6 or 30 degrees. On the unit circle the hypotenuse is 1 unit, so imagine the legs of a right triangle as being the y value and the x value and  then use the fact that cos x is adjacent/hypotenuse and the angle is between the hypotenuse and the x axis so the side adjacent to the angle is the x axis and it's value has to be sqrt3 /2 and the hypotenuse 1. By Pythagorean theorem you have ((sqrt3)/2)^2 + y^2 = 1^2. Solve for y getting y ^2 = 1-(3/4)=1/4 take the sqrt of both sides getting y = 1/2 and that would be the sin x which we all know the sin 30 degrees is 1/2

Next Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) made important contributions by devising instruments to observe motion of planets. In particular, Brahe compiled extensive data on the planet Mars. However, Johannes Kepler made the monumental discovery of the time. Brahe, fearing his bright assistant might eclipse him as the premiere astronomer of the day, assigned Kepler the perplexing orbit of the planet Mars (Mars has the most elliptical orbit of all the planets). Ironically it was precisely the Mars data that allowed Kepler to develop his three laws describing the orbit of planets around the Sun. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Kepler's Three Laws of Planetary Motion: <br>  1. Planets revolve around the Sun in an elliptical path, with the Sun occupying one of the foci of the ellipse. <br>  2. Straight line joining sun and planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time. <br>  3. Squares of planets' orbital periods are proportional to the cubes of the semimajor axes of their orbits. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) <br>  Mathematician/astronomer/physicist who made numerous contributions to modern science. Galileo was first to use telescope to gather evidence proving the earth revolves around the sun. His position represented such a radical departure from accepted thought that he was tried by the Inquisition in Rome, ordered to recant, and forced to spend the last eight years of his life under house arrest. But most of Galileo's projects didn't conflict with the church's interests?falling bodies, magnets, floating objects, the tides, compasses, arc of a cannonball, and rolling objects. He informally stated the principles later embodied in Newton's first two laws of motion. He also invented the mechanical pendulum clock, improved the telescope, and developed the first thermometer. Because of his pioneering work in gravitation/motion and in combining mathematical analysis with experimentation, Galileo is credited with ushering in the new age of science. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) <br>  There can be no outstanding scientist list without Sir Isaac Newton; he made revolutionary advances in mathematics, optics, physics, and astronomy. In 1687 Newton published the Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica. Principia, as it has become known, is recognized as the greatest scientific book ever written! Newton analyzed motion of bodies under the action of centripetal forces. The results were applied to orbiting bodies, projectiles, pendulums, and free-fall near the Earth. He further demonstrated planets were attracted toward the Sun by a force varying as the inverse square of the distance and generalized that all heavenly bodies mutually attract one another. In order to perform his calculations, Newton invented calculus. <br>  Newton also explained a wide range of previously unrelated phenomena such as eccentric orbits of comets, tides and their variation, precession of the Earth's axis, and motion of Moon as perturbed by gravity of Sun. Newton was deeply interested in light and published optics in 1704. Although he believed a wave theory more probable, he relied on a corpuscular theory to account for phenomena such as reflexion, refraction, colors, and diffraction. <br>  <br>  Newton's Three Laws of Motion: <br>  1. A body continues in a state of rest, or motion with a constant velocity, unless compelled to change by an unbalanced force. <br>  2. The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting upon it and inversely proportional to its mass. <br>  3. For every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force. <br>  <br>  <br>  Charles Darwin (1809-1882) <br>  Darwin studied medicine at Edinburgh University but was repelled by the sight of surgery performed without anesthesia and entered Cambridge University to become a clergyman. In 1831 after receiving his degree, Darwin served as an unpaid naturalist on the H.M.S. Beagle for a five-year scientific expedition to the Pacific coast of South America. The research resulting from this voyage formed the basis of Darwin's famous book, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. Published in 1859, Darwin concluded: <br>  1. Evolutionary change was gradual and required thousands to millions of years. <br>  2. Primary mechanism for evolution was process called natural selection. <br>  3. Millions of species alive today arose from single original life form through branching process called "specialization." <br>  Variation within species occurs randomly and survival/extinction determined by organism's ability to adapt to its environment. Darwin's work had a tremendous impact on society since the theory challenged beliefs about the creation of life on earth. After publication of Origin of Species, Darwin continued to write on botany, geology, and zoology until his death in 1882. He is buried in Westminster Ab

I'll list them first, then go into them one by one.<br>  <br>  - Establishment of 3 types of magnetic fields to protect all living things from COSMIC rays<br>  - Creation of an Atmosphere to block out uv, gamma and x-rays<br>  - Bioforming a globe<br>  - Terraforming a globe<br>  - Aerobic activity to sustain a viable and dynamic environment<br>  <br>  If we moved just 1% of all mammals on Earth to the moons and Mars, it would be enough to start viable ecosystems.  All mammals (groundhogs, squirrels, gerbils, hamsters, lorises, lemurs, etc.) produce water vapor and CO2 as the 2 primary byproducts of Aerobic Respiration.  Add methane gas to this and you now have 3 potent greenhouses gases with which to build a rich and thick atmosphere.   <br>  <br>  Just fill a silo with dry pet food, fill a crater with clean water and provide salt licks. You might also set up a dome for them when temperatures get extreme, or dig tunnels for them to go underground.<br>  <br>  To provide oxygen for the animals, lunar and Martian CRATERS have to be filled with water, iron sulfate and phytoplankton. Thru photosynthesis, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is released, generating cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and OXYGEN. CCNs cling to water vapor and dust particles to create CLOUDS. Coal ashes can serve as dust, just use a fan to create some convection. Use an ozone generator to create ozone.<br>  <br>  However, to protect the animals from COSMIC rays, a magnetic field has to be in place.  Without a magnetic field, any water would be photodissociated by solar uv, a process which strips hydrogen from water molecules, while the solar wind blows it off into space. Mars once had flowing rivers, but lost all of its water and atmosphere due to photodissociation.<br>  <br>  To create a "global" magnetic field on Mars, a Superconducting Magnetic Ring would have to be imbedded deep into the crust, about 200' deep. You'll need to have a Superconducting Magnet that meets these specifications: variable ramping up from 2 to 14 Tesla; quench recovery; ability to sustain a "persistent current" indefinitely; backup and failure protection; 24/7 monitoring system. Super Pulsed Fiber Lasers such as the Photonic's IPG laser will make lunar and Martian excavation projects a breeze compared to conventional drilling equipment: rocks will glow red hot and crumble.<br>  <br>  On Earth, the magnetic field on the SURFACE is only 0.5 to 2.0 gauss, while near the CORE, it's approximately 100,000 gauss, or 10 Tesla. That's because magnetic flux varies as the Inverse CUBE of the distance, R. Use a fluxgate magnetometer to measure the magnetic field.<br>  <br>  A Samarium Cobalt magnet of 1 to 2 Tesla, imbedded 5' under a compressed dome will create "local" magnetic fields, protecting about 50 inhabitants from cosmic rays. Elongated bar magnets strapped onto spacesuits will create a cosmic umbrella of "mobile" magnetic fields, deflecting cosmic rays while you walk and work. Eventually, a global magnetic field will be necessary in order to walk out of the dome and begin building an atmosphere.<br>  <br>  METHANE gas will create a blue/green color in the sky. Compost piles and farm/animal droppings are a great source of methane.<br>  <br>  Then it's just a matter of building an ATMOSPHERE, which is literally, a piece of cake. All we have to do is build bakeries, restaurants and farms. That's because water vapor and CO2 are the 2 primary byproducts of COMBUSTION and AEROBIC RESPIRATION. That is, the more we eat, and the more active we are, the more water vapor, CO2 and Methane gas we add to a planet's atmosphere, 24/7. Pretty soon, it'll be flooding on the Moon and on Mars. Methane is 25x more potent at heating an atmosphere than CO2. Build a Fischer Tropsch reactor to make propane and other fuels.<br>  <br>  Funding for such projects might be from the ISDC Conference 2009 (Int'l Space Development Conference).|`|O8qyhAegaa	I could send a robot to the beach and sample the sand and water.

This resides in the 1st quadrant, where cosine is positive.  cos(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 so the secant is just the reciprocal, which is 2/sqrt(2).  This is just sqrt(2).

Look for something in common between this equation and the other identity equations.  (sorry, I don't personally have that info anymore so I can't demonstrate it outright).
4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	At it's simplest, I'd say Calculus is the branch of mathematics that studies rates of change.<br>  <br>  Most of the time in mathematics, you can assign a variable like "x" to the quantity you don't know, then use what you do know to say something about x, and do calculations with that until you can find out what "x" finally is.<br>  <br>  So for example, how long will it take me to make a 100 mile trip if I'm going 55 mph on the highway?  I know that speed is distance divided by time, so algebra tells me that time is distance divided by speed.  So if I divide 100 by 55 I get about 1 9/11, so it will take me about an hour and 49 minutes.<br>  <br>  Sometimes though, even your variables are changing on you.  If I step on my acceletor so that I go from 0 to 60 in 10 seconds, what's my distance after 10 seconds?  In this case my speed isn't constant, so I'm going to have to find some other way to use the available numbers to find my distance.  This is where calculus can help.  Calculus studies not only change, but RATES of change.|`|D0oYiivkaa	In arithmetic you have 4 basic operations and they are paired up by their relationship to each other. Addition and subtraction are related since they 'undo' each other and multiplication and division are related in the same way, that is they undo each other. In calculus you have two basic operations, differentiation and integration and they 'undo' each other. You can also think of calculus as a tool for problem solving. That's it in a nutshell|`|AA11611389	Calculus is part of the study of functions.  It was invented several hundred years ago to solve two main problems:  the "slope" of a curve that is not straight, like y = x^2, and the area underneath a curve that is not straight.  Both problems are easy to do without calculus for the case of a line, but calculus makes it possible for curves.|`|fIJHd2Qpaa	Look at a graph that you might have made in algebra.  Calculus is a tool to measure the area underneath the line/curve, down to the x-axis, from one point on the x-axis to another.  So in the graph of y=x, from x=0 to x=1, you would be finding the area of what would look like a triangle 1 long and 1 tall.|`|WPmR4kuVaa	Calculus is the study of change and motion.|`|VLT2VgP9aa	Ultimately, calculus boil down to limits.  Both differentiation and integration, the two main operators in calculus, are defined in terms of limits.  A limit is a tool that allows us to examine the behavior of a function at values that are arbitrarily close to a particular value, but not actually equal to that value.  Prior to calculus, you wouldn't have any tool that does this, other than approximation.  However, limits are accurate and exact, whereas approximation leaves room for error.

o91grX4zaa	Yes zero is a number. The more interesting question is about 0^0 and the question has been debated for a very long time by mathematicians without a definite conclusion. Some say that 0^0 cannot be defined to be the same in all situations while others say it has to be 1. A guideline seems to be that whatever 0^0 gets defined as it should be a matter of convenience (simplifying calculations) and not a matter of absolute truth.|`|AA11461259	I don't know but I love the power of zero!

E0j6mhqhaa	Excluding scours from over eating or over feeding, scours is more a sanitary and management problem than it is anything.  I know goats hate inclement weather, but the more sunshine and open area the better.  Things don't have to be manure free though.  I straw my barns very little because if you make it too attractive to them, they spend too much time in the barn and poop it full.  Leaving it dirty pressures them to spend more time outside.  The only time I straw is when we have one of those all day downpours and the animals are inside most of the day.<br>  <br>  Too many people baby their animals too much.  My ewes are for making money and not pets.  Because of that, they either get tough or take a trip to the salebarn.  I lamb out around 150 ewes a year and I haven't had any scours for decades. <br>  <br>  You might keep track of which animals have the scouring kids and see if it seems to be confined to certain individuals.|`|OltyaEbhaa	Do not know any scientific reasons, but has seemed to me that lambs, and sheep, are by far the weakest of the cloven hoofed and cud chewing.  They seem to be the hardest hit by parasites, disease, have the most difficulty coming back from disease and illnesses.  My husband started his flock 29 years ago, through breeding and careful stock selection  we finally have a flock of sheep that are much hardier than they once were, an example, we no longer have to trim hooves, we once had to do this twice a year.  We have also had goats so I can make the comparison in your question  well.  In short to your question, it seems to be the nature of the animal, they are not built to be as strong as goats, they have not been genetically designed that way, and I suppose we shall never know the answer to the why of that question!  Even watching how a lamb and kid behave, how they eat, there is tremendous difference in all of their natural habits.  Interesting.

AA11852174	You can identify if its covalent or ionic by knowing if either the electrons in the compound are shared or given/taken. In an ionic bond, ions are formed. In a covalent bond, sharing pairs are made.<br>  <br>  But using those numbers you have, you can exactly determine the type of bond. Those correspond to the electronegativity differences of the atoms which form the compound. Just subtract their electronegativity. For example:<br>  <br>  SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide)<br>  <br>  Electronegativity:<br>  Oxygen- 3.44<br>  Sulfur- 2.58<br>  Difference- .0.86<br>  <br>  It is a polar (Moderately, in your scale) covalent bond.<br>  <br>  When a metal and non-metal combine, its usually ionic. Between two non-metals, its usually covalent.

i0ypGmlQaa	Question 1: It tells you exactly what to draw. There is no question here.<br>  <br>  Question 2: For these constructions, just realize that you can now construct square roots of any integers.<br>  <br>  Then the x you construct in the first part is r / √2<br>  <br>  For the second part, you do the same, it's just a bit more complicated. The first circle needs 1/4 the area. Use r/2 for that radius. The next is the same one you had before, with radius r/√2. That will contain half the area, but subtracting the inner circle gives you 1/4 between them. The final one does the same thing, so you'll give it radius √(3) r / 2.<br>  <br>  Question 3 (called "Part B"):<br>  <br>  We may say, without loss of any rigor, that the entire circle has diameter 10. That would mean that the tiny white semicircle has radius 1. It sits inside of a light grey semicircle of radius 2, which sits inside a grey semicircle of radius 3, which sits inside a dark grey semicircle of radius 4, which sits inside a black semicircle of radius 5.<br>  <br>  Now, what is the area of the top white region?<br>  <br>  π(1)2/2 = π/2.<br>  <br>  What's the area of the top light grey region?<br>  <br>  π(2)2/2 - π(1)2/2 = 3π/2<br>  <br>  What's the area of the top grey region?<br>  <br>  π(3)2/2 - π(2)2/2 = 5π/2<br>  <br>  What's the area of the top dark grey region?<br>  <br>  π(4)2/2 - π(3)2/2 = 7π/2<br>  <br>  And what's the area of the top black region?<br>  <br>  π(5)2/2 - π(4)2/2 = 9π/2<br>  <br>  The odd number (times π/2) pattern here has to do with differences of squares, since the difference of n2 - (n-1)2 is the nth odd number.<br>  <br>  All of those are just subtracting areas of semicircles from other semicircles. Now, the bottom half of the circle is reversed. So the totals are simply:<br>  <br>  White: π/2 + 9π/2 = 10π/2 = 5π<br>  Light grey: 3π/2 + 7π/2 = 10π/2 = 5π<br>  Grey: 5π/2 + 5π/2 = 10π/2 = 5π<br>  Dark grey: 7π/2 + 3π/2 = 10π/2 = 5π<br>  Black: 9π/2 + π/2 = 10π/2 = 5π<br>  <br>  They are all equal QED<br>  <br>  We can check, their area sums to:<br>  5π + 5π + 5π + 5π + 5π = 25π = (5)2π<br>  <br>  That's the total area of the circle, which is correct! Cool.

157c840c4459e57440637f3fe001106caa	Recent evidence states that this assumption is wrong.<br>  Researchers now believe that every constant which was considered to be a universal constant before is not a constant, for example speed of light, Gravitational constant etc.<br>  This is the result of the new assumption that our universe is not infinite, rather convex shaped and spherical in four dimensions. It explains many things.<br>  Also, you are absolutely right. It is a paradox.<br>  EDIT : If the velocity of the galaxies is proportional to the distance, the expansion of the universe is somewhat accelerated, but a little bit more complex than that.<br>  EDIT : No the unknown force is not gravity, or electromagnetic etc. because these are only the forces in our universe and if something is effecting our universe as a whole, it must be dimensionally superior to ours. As our universe is a four dimensional one, so the force is outside of our universe and is five dimensional.<br>  In fact, no one understands much about these theories because they don't relate to everyday lives. So you are not alone.<br>  "If something explains everything it must be right" is the assumption we live on today.<br>  EDIT :<br>  The size of the universe is something different from the distance between the galaxies. The universe is not defined by the galaxies. So while gravity might affect the separation between the galaxies, it cannot affect the size of the universe.<br>  It is right that the universe is spherical in four dimensions with the galaxies at the surface at a given point in time.<br>  But the expansion of the universe is not uniform, so the rate at which the dots on the surface move away from each other is proportional to their separation at a given point in time, but the constant of proportionality is what changes with time and is not a universal constant.<br>  I might even mention some more details about the force that you are talking about.<br>  The presence of three free(space) and one non free(time) dimension has led the scientists to only one conclusion.<br>  This conclusion is that our universe is inside a 5 dimensional black hole, whose immense gravity has split the dimensions of our universe(implied the constraint that the universe can move only in one direction in one dimension, which is time) and this gravity of 5 dimensions is the mysterious force you are talking about.<br>  EDIT :<br>  Here are some links to confirm what i say :<br>  <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/BlackHoles/universe.html" rel="nofollow">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Re...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/09/030917072015.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/200...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath339.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath339.h...</a>|`|PG7WfGpHaa	To change the velocity of a speeding galaxy would require a force acting on it.

In fact the Hubble constant is usually written as Ho  (H sub zero), to indicate that this is the value of the Hubble constant at our particular time and place.  The value of Hubble's "constant" varies approximately inversely with time: it's the velocity between two distant galaxies that is approximately constant ever since the Big Bang, and so as the distance between them increases, the Hubble "constant" decreases accordingly.  Back in the past, the Hubble constant was bigger, and possibly infinite at the instant of the Big Bang.  As we see from the above, the Hubble "constant" is actually the inverse of the current age of the Universe, at each epoch.<br>  <br>  In actuality, the age of the Universe is derived from a best-fit Friedmann solution to the Einstein field equations, that takes into account all that we know about cosmology, in particular the pressures and densities of the various constituents of the Universe.  This gives an equation for the scaling factor of the Universe as a function of time, and the time derivative of the scaling factor is the local, temporal value of the Hubble constant.  A calculation of the co-moving proper time since the Big Bang gives the "age of the Universe".  That answer, however, differs only by 15% or so from the approximate equation  T = 1/H.|`|tjSxkBFXaa	μηδε? ?ετα τε?τιηg  is wrong on several points I'm afraid! Cosmo comes closest to the current understanding.<br>  Your premise.."This requires an assumption that the galaxy has always been moving with the same velocity." is wrong. It only needs the assumption that 1/H gives the age of the universe (to a good approximation at least). Recent evidence does show that the rate of expansion of the universe is increasing, leading to an OPEN universe, but the evidensc is not conclusive yet. If true though, the cause of this is presently unknown.|`|Tiph3lQcaa	There are recent studies that include the possibility of velocity variations during the early expansion of the Big Bang, but that is not what you are talking about. Remember that the velocity is relative, and is based on a constant expansion rate. Consider yourself as a dot painted on the surface of a balloon. As the balloon expands, other dots on the surface recede from you at different rates depending on their linear distance along the surface from you. The farthest dots will recede at the same velocity whether the balloon is small or large if the rate of expansion is constant. The nearest dots will behave in the same manner. There is no reason to believe that the velocity has changed significantly (notwithstanding the caveat in the first sentence above) except as dictated by the overall effects of common gravitation. That is the question dealing with whether the universe is closed or open, and that question has not been resolved yet. But your question about the velocities changing based on geometry alone is based on a false premise, i.e. that the rate of recession is due to stars receding within a fixed geometry and not a geometry that is itself expanding at a constant rate.

xXOnjDNOaa	If the thermocouple had a large heat capacity it would take more energy transfer to alter its temperature, hence it would be slower to respond to changes in the temperature of the system.  Small heat capacity means that it will quickly settle to the new system temperature, so it will give a more accurate reading.

You need to convert the volume of bromobenzene (3.0 mL) to a weight to figure out the number of moles you start with.  The theoretical yield will be an equivalent number of moles of benzoic acid.  The density is 1.495 g/cc for bromobenzene, so you start with 3 x 1.495 = 4.485 g bromobenzene. This translates to 4.485g/157.02 g per mole = 0.02856 moles.  This many moles of benzoic acid weighs: (0.0286 moles)(122.12 g/mole BA)= 3.49 g.  I would suggest using bottled Carbon dioxide instead of dry ice in the reaction.  Water crystals condense on the surface of the dry ice and this reacts with the grignard reagent very rapidly. This will lower your yield significantly.

Do you want a solution that is 10 nM, i.e. 10 nmole/liter, or do you just want 10 nmole in a particular volume, like 10 ul?  The MW is 4567.6 (you can probably forget the 0.6 and round off to 4567) and I think from the question you have 0.1 mg.  This 0.1 mg is the same as 100 ug, and so 100 ug/4567ug/umol = 0.02 umoles represented by that 0.1 mg.  The 0.02 umole is the same as 20 nmoles.  So, what you have in the 0.1 mg of powder is equal to 20 nmoles.  If you want 10 nM solution you have to dissolve that powder in 2 liters.  If you simply just want 10 nmoles of protein, you can dissolve it in any volume, and then take 1/2 that volume.

N6Ry349Raa	First multiply both sides by 200; this is a positive number so it doesn't change the inequality symbol.  This gives<br>  <br>  25 * (5^N - 1)/(5^N + 1) < 2N - 100.<br>  <br>  Now observe that (5^N - 1)/(5^N + 1) = (5^N + 1)/(5^N + 1) - 2/(5^N + 1) = 1 - 2/(5^N + 1).  As such, our inequality becomes<br>  <br>  25 - 50/(5^N + 1) < 2N - 100.<br>  <br>  Rearranging terms, this is equivalent to <br>  <br>  125 < 50/(5^N + 1) + 2N.<br>  <br>  Now observe that 50/(5^N + 1) is always positive, so really we have the inequality:<br>  <br>  125 < 2N < 50/(5^N + 1) + 2N.<br>  <br>  Since 50/(5^N + 1) rapidly decays to zero for N >> 0 (that is, as N increases past about 3), it follows that the smallest N satisfying our inequality is about 125/2 = 62.5.  Indeed, if you plug this value of N into a calculator, you'll get exactly 125 for 50/(5^N + 1) + 2N (though in reality, the value of this expression is just a tiny bit greater than 125).<br>  <br>  In conclusion, N satisfies your inequality if and only if N is greater than a number just a tiny bit smaller than 62.5.  We probably can't find an exact expression for this lower bound, and it is numerically equal to 62.5 to any reasonable precision.  <br>  <br>  From this analysis, it follows that the smallest integer N satisfying your inequality is N = 63.

39f3758933add65e2634bbff1b3a9a28aa	Although the previous answer has the right idea, it is not entirely correct. Silica content is not, in itself, what makes a mineral have a low melting point. In Bowen's reaction series, some of the first minerals to start to precipitate in a melt are calcium plagioclase, and pyroxene. Both are silicate minerals. The very last mineral to form in a melt, if silica content is high enough, is quartz, because most of the rest of the silica is incorporated into the previous minerals. To make a long story short, what mineral will crystallize last depends entirely on the composition of the melt. For more than 85% or more of volcanism on earth, this would be quartz.|`|2lQ8DJAcaa	Minerals with a high silica content have low melting points.

AA11824362	In a magma chamber, different minerals form at different temperatures. This is illustrated by Bowen's Reaction Series, which is a chart that shows what temperatures different minerals precipitate from a melt. If the melt has been cooling for a while (say, 1,000,000 years), some minerals will have formed but others will still be in solution. This can lead to "a slush mixture of crystals and molten rock".|`|Cc2Yb9DKaa	The internal heat of the Earth's core melts rock and other minerals.  At high temperatures and pressure, the rock turns into a viscous fluid.  Sometimes it finds its way to the surface through fissures and thin spots in the crust.  When magma reaches the surface, called lava, it cools and solidifies back into rock.    Rocks and minerals have different melting points and physical states at different pressure and temperature.  The difference cases an action similar to the slag or coke that separates from the ore during iron smelting.
o66JpGfHaa	For the average energy in J it is an easy calculation:  Ek(av)=3/2kT. T here is the thermodynamic temperature in Kelvin scale.  For Ar and Xe, the answer is the same: The Boltzmann constant being k=1.38x10EXP(-23)J/Kelvin where 10EXP(N) means the number 10 to the exponent N and T=(112+273)Kelvin then, Ek(av)=1.5x1.38x10EXP(-23)J/Kelvin x 385Kelvin or Ek(av)=796x10EXP(-23)J.    For the speed's root mean square we have:  1/2MV(squared)=Ek(av)  V(rms)=SQR(2Ek(av)/M) where SQR(N) means the square root of N.  V(rms)=SQR(1592x10EXP(-23)/M)  M is the mass of one single gas molecule.  For Ar, M={40x10EXP(-3)kg/[6,02x10EXP(23)]}so V(rms)=SQR(1592x6.02x1000/40)=489m/s    For Xe, M={131x10EXP(-3)kg/[6,02x10EXP(23)]}  V(rms)=SQR(1592x6.02x1000/131)=270m/s    For C3H8 we have:  Ek(av)=[1.5x1.38x10EXP(-23)J/Kelvin]x(...

V(rms)=SQR(2430x6.02x1000/44)=576m/s    It should bee noted that I am here calculating the root mean square or, say, the square root of the average squared speed. I do not know which is the level of this specific problem. If you are at the high school, ok. But if you study college physics, then, the most probable speed should be deduced from the derivative of the boltzmann speed distribution for the molecules of a gas and making that expression equals to zero.    In this late case, we have for the Boltzmann distribution of speeds:  dN/dv = const x V(squared) x eEXP[-MV(squared)/2kT]; where e is the euler number; e=2.718...  Taking the derivative of the above expression and forcing it to be zero we have:  V(av)=SQR(2kT/M)=SQR[4/3xEk(av)x10EXP(...    For Ar:  V(av)=SQR[(796x4/3)x6.02x(1000/40)]=39...

As children we are told it is foolish to think what we do so we become more sceptical and afraid of telling what we believe.  <br>  <br>  Mothers use that 6th sense when caring for children.  Women generally are very intuitive because they are allowed by society to have those emotions and our roles are different.  Men on the other hand don't indulge in that because it is not "manly" or thought of as crazy.  Men are generally more analytical in thinking where women are thought of as emotional.  The stereotyping of THAT is false...we all know that.  But men think they have to deny and believe only what they see!<br>  <br>  It is a shame we deny all our senses to work properly.  There are many psychic children who deny who they are because it ostracizes them from society. Others make fun of them and they are left alone to feel afraid and out of control.<br>  <br>  Some of us remain more in touch with that other sense than others because we refuse to shut it out.  It doesn't mean we are right or always  have the ability...but we are in touch with something other than the five senses.  It also does not make us right in what we see or think we sense.  <br>  <br>  Intuition is the power that takes a person from the known into the unknown. <br>  <br>  While the sixth sense is more-so associated with alerting us to real danger, like a stranger lurking in the shadows, sometimes it is associated with one’s ‘gut-instinct’ when trying to choose the right course of action. More incredibly, it might be telling us not to go somewhere that day as if, somehow, it can foretell events. This phenomenal array of abilities, surely to include more, aught to be a clue the sixth sense will lead to answers concerning life itself and we do not yet understand what and how this happens.<br>  <br>  We don't know enough about our phenomenal (mysterious) capabilities to start understanding them. People ususally make fun of it or make some kind of entertainment out of it.  Yet how many of you have "sensed" something once in a while and didn't listen to yourself and should have?  We all have.  We all say..."I KNEW ...but why didn't I listen to myself."  You can put it off to judgement or knowledge or some lame thing...but some things are just unexplainable.<br>  <br>  the sixth sense seems more a part of the human psyche than the other five senses, being more entwined with the makeup of the mind, whereas the other five senses are more 'independent' and animal in nature.

If we considered the sixth sense more as 'us', and less a tool, this different outlook should take us to an elevated path.<br>  <br>  In the end, a human can only be a greater phenomenon than we akkiw to be known.

TL1Jkqunaa	All plastics can be recycled.  The problem is that it is too expensive to sort  and separate the different plastics from one another to recycle them.  That is, each type of plastic must be separated from the other types.  Even plastics of the same type but different colors and thicknesses sometimes have to be separated to be recycled.    People interested in recycling understand this and are constantly pushing for laws limiting the numbers of types of plastics in use, trying to standardize what plastics are used for what purposes.  Since a huge amount of plastic is meant for single use and disposal (all the plastics used in wrapping products for sale, for example) there really is no need to use the huge variety we do use.  Limiting them would be a good start to usefully recycling them

To answer question directly: no.|`|uAEZeyAAaa	I believe in yes  there could be special circumstances in which a naked singularity might be created from a collapsing black hole, either by nature or perhaps even by some advanced civilization.

WPPIaLORaa	a.  Places near the equator do not experience summer and winter with large temperature swings.  Changing the tilt would not change that fact.    b.  Changing the tilt would not change the distance to the sun.    c.  Whether or not there is cooling in any place would depend on how ocean currents and winds are changed by the new heating pattern.  There is no way to predict the outcome.|`|8cLV2OPYaa	No, no, and no. There would be no seasons at all. All climates would stabilize to an average and remain there, hottest at the equator, coldest at the poles, the Earth itself would not be any closer to the sun. The climate at the equator would get slightly warmer overall, and stay that way all year. The climate at the tropics would be an average between its current summer and winter temperatures. The climate at both poles would be mostly colder, but perhaps not quite as cold as it is now in deep winter. Also you would no longer have several months straight of darkness and light at the poles. If you were standing exactly at the north or south pole, the Sun would look like it was skimming the horizon 24 hours a day, all year long. Like permanent twilight.|`|cJPOs7Tsaa	a) No. Axial tilt is required to have seasons.  b) No. The Earth's changing distance from the sun plays no significant role to our seasons. Fact: During winter in the Northern hemisphere, the Earth is closest to the sun.  c) At first, perhaps. In the long run, no. With the Earth evenly baking in the sun's rays, the polar ice caps would rapidly melt. Think about it: With no axial tilt, at the poles, the sun would never set. It would appear as a half disk (Half below the horizon, half above), and circle along the horizon 24/7. With all of Earth's water in the liquid state, I would expect a runaway greenhouse effect. Eventually, all the oceans would evaporate into the atmosphere, creating massive cloud cover, like on Venus. The pressure on Earth's surface would be roughly equivalent to the pressure at the average depth of the world's oceans. The temperature would be in the hundreds of degrees, worldwide. There would be no weather. Everyday would be the same.
YrOTZsjtaa	The answer is c. This is why : the volume of the block is:    V = 0.20m x 0.15m x L  = (0.03m2)L     Since specific gravity is defined as the ratio of the density of the object to the density of water (at 4.0C), then :    0.75 =  / 1.0 x 103kg / m3   = 750kg / m3    So,      = m / V  V = m /   (0.03m2)L = 8.0kg / 750kg / m3  L = 0.356m (or 35.6cm)    Initially I said 3.56cm. This is because I did not convert to cm from m correctly. Otherwise, my method is correct.|`|nDv2EtuGaa	The answer is c: 35.6 cm    8 kg = 8000 g  at a s.g. of .75, the volume must be 8000/0.75 = 10667 cu cm    10667/20/15 = 35.5555 0r 35.6 cm    (A good rule of thumb is that you are 1000 times more likely to be wrong than the book is!)|`|6J6S6ECoaa	c is the correst answer .  The equation is in the form of..    length in cms x breadth in cms x height in cms x .75 = 2000    let length be x then x = 2000 divided by 20x15x.75  This works out at 35.5 repeating or 35.6    OK ??

This locus represents an infinite number of concentric circles centered at the South Pole with radii of 1 + 1/(2πn) miles.<br>  <br>  He walks a mile south toward the South Pole.  Now if he is on a circle centered at the pole with circumference of 1 mile, he will walk the entire circle when he goes west and arrive back to where he is, thence walking north 1 mile to where he started.  Of course, two navigations of the circle will work too, and 3,4,5, etc.  If r is the radius of the circle then the circumference of the circle is 2πr and we want 2πrn = 1 mile where n is the number of circumnavigations he takes.  So r = 1/(1+2πn) where n is any natural number. <br>  1+r is his original distance from the pole, leading to the solution given above.|`|5W9KNNk4aa	At any latitude where walking a mile due west will place the hunter at the same longitude.<br>  <br>  ie he walks around the globe 1 time, 2 times, 3 times... etc. - all very close to the north pole|`|T8DThYKHaa	Points within a few inches of the north pole will give a similar result, but he won't be returning EXACTLY to his starting point. anywhere else on earth, more than 1 mile from the north pole, or south pole (where there are no bears), the hunter would be 1 mile west from his starting point|`|8S2rtfZXaa	methinks that locus of the infinitely many other points on Earth where this occurs is right there at the north pole.  for example:<br>  <br>  walk 1: North Pole (NP) - 1 degrees longitude south, mile west, mile north, NP<br>  walk 2: NP - 2 degree long so, mile west, mile north, NP<br>  walk 3: NP - 3 degree long so, mile west, mile north, NP<br>  walk 4: NP - 4 degree long so, mile west, mile north, NP<br>  and continue around the circle ...<br>  walk 359: NP - 359 degree long so, mile west, mile north, NP<br>  walk 360: same as walk 0 @ 0 degree long so.<br>  <br>  and then of course everything between the degrees too.<br>  <br>  the important point is he begins and ends each walk at the north pole.<br>  <br>  Viola!<br>  <br>  ps - i thought polar bears lived at the south pole?  or is that penguins?<br>  <br>  pps - i believe Xen has a valid point, his reasons are a little conflicted though.  1 + 1/(2πn)  looks like a variable starting point depending on n...really?  his last statement 1+r looks better (not the best) as a starting point.

70cf63c745874c449067b760725961e9aa	The important condition to have a high relative humidity is that the difference between the air temperature and the dew point temperature should be as small as possible.If both are same,the relative humidity will be 100%.So,if the dew point temperature is very low,then the air temperature should also be correspondingly low in order to a high relative humidity.Therefore,in this case,the air temperature must have been lower and very near to the dew point.This is the case with colder regions on the earth.That is why polar regions have the highest relative humidity and the desert regions lowest relative humidity throughout the year .|`|mH1Tnv5Naa	Relative humidity expresses the relation of how much water vapor is in the air compared to how much water vapor that air can hold.  Colder air cannot hold as much water vapor as warmer air.  As a result, if the air is relatively cold, then even a seemingly low dewpoint can produce a high RH.  For example, say the dewpoint is 32F (0 C).  If the air temperature is 60 degrees F (15.5 C) then the relative humidity would be about 34%.  But if the air temperature was 40 F (4 C), then with the same amount of water vapor present, the RH would be about 72%.

9lzNDwhZaa	I suggest that you read through the links listed below which I obtaned by a search on "wern ddu caerphilly coal"    Your (coal board) arguement should be based around the presence of coal reserves of ??? tonnage which is ?? deep which can be mined economically and which can give sustainable jobs to an area of high unemployment. The area is known to contain good quality coking coal and there is a ready market available at the Llanwern steelworks at Port Talbot.     The opposing arguement is that it is an area of outstanding natural beauty which has taken decades to recover from its coal mining legacy with increasingly attractive bird life and the possibility of generating tourism. The local economy should be more focused on 'clean' industries and we should be trying to generate more energy from 'clean' sources rather than from fossil fuels.

Hope this helps.|`|O9FojdEMaa	South Africa is rich in gold and diamonds. Mining and minerals in South Africa    South Africa, known throughout the world as a treasure trove, boasts an abundance of mineral resources, producing and owning a significant proportion of the world's minerals.    South Africa's wealth has been built on the country's vast resources - nearly 90% of the platinum metals on Earth, 80%   of the manganese, 73% of the chrome, 45% of the vanadium and 41% of the gold. Only crude oil and bauxite are not found here.    SA's share of world reserves & production  South Africa's share of world mineral reserves and production  (Data source: Department of Minerals and Energy)    The country is a leading producer of precious metals such as gold and platinum, as well as of base metals and coal. It is the world's fourth-largest producer of diamonds.    And experts believe there is still considerable potential for the discovery of other world-class deposits in areas that have yet to be fully exploited.  Place in the economy    South Africa's position as the world's largest gold producer - a position it held for over a century - was usurped by China in 2007.    China's gold production for the year was estimated at 276 metric tons by London precious metals consultancy GFMS, and at 270 tons by the China Gold Association. South Africa, according to the Chamber of Mines of SA, produced 254 tons of the metal in 2007.    Gold, once a keystone to the South African economy, has diminished in importance as the country's economy has diversified. In the 1970s and 1980s, gold exports were the predominant source of foreign exchange earnings, with mining contributing around 14% of total value added in the economy. This has shifted over time and, in 2007, mining and quarrying contributed about 5.8% to the country's gross domestic product (GDP).    However, mining as an industry is still crucial to South Africa, with precious metals contributing 65% to the country's mineral export earnings and 21% of total exports of goods in 2006. The country supplies about 80% of the world's platinum.    The mining industry is also South Africa's biggest employer, with around 460 000 employees and another 400 000 employed by the suppliers of goods and services to the industry. see the following link for locations of mines and quarry's;  http://www.dme.gov.za/pdfs/minerals/D1_2...|`|zJGju89Eaa	Kimberly diamond mines in the southern part of the country.

bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa	It's possible that a planet-sized object could form by itself in an interstellar cloud, but it seems this is unlikely: what usually happens is that a dense region in a cloud grows and continues to grow until it starts emitting enough energy to blow away the material that continues to fall on it.  The surrounding planets have already accumulated by this time, from the dense accretion disk of the star.<br>  <br>  So the point is that once a piece of an interstellar cloud begins to collapse, it keeps collapsing until the central material forms a star and stops the process.  To form only a planet-sized object, some other process (for example a nearby supernova) would have to intervene to blow away the gas that otherwise would fall onto the planet and make it big enough to become a star.<br>  <br>  If the Sun blew off most of its mass in a spherical shell, Neptune would become unbound.  It is unlikely in the extreme that it would ever be captured by another star---it would wander the galaxy alone for many trillions of years.|`|wuJ2pHoDaa	planes typically don't form without a parent star, the planet is formed from wat's left after the formation of the parent star.  if our sun exploded which it won't likely do, it should actually just basically shed and it will lose all of it's layers, if this happens earth would be still there, it would be a charred wasteland but it still would be there.  why do u care so much about neptune? there's a whole lot of nothing there.  but seeing how it's lost its main gravitational attractor it would be sucked into orbit around the next largest thing, Jupiter, a brown dwarf.

My suggestion is to use the method of balancing red-ox equations by   (1) assigning oxidation numbers to every atom on both sides of the equation,   (2) determining which elements underwent a change in oxidation number from left to right,   (3) writing the half-reactions for oxidation and reduction reactions,   (4) making sure that the number of electrons lost equals the number of electrons gained,   (5) using the coefficients in the half-reactions in the big equation, and finally   (6) finishing balancing equation by counting atoms of the same kind on both sides of the equation and inserting the rest of the coefficients.
V8jIAEmBaa	Yes, you can, if you can find an LED with a datasheet rating of enough reverse breakdown voltage, so that it doesn't conduct when the polarity is backward. LED's are generally not made from silicon, and the processes used normally have poor reverse voltage capability. Most I checked were conducting at -5V. A small Osram unit had 10uA at -12V, and a Rohm had 100uA at -12V, so you may be able to find something suitable. Check Digikey, Mouser, Newark, Allied Electronics. You could also put a better diode in series with the LED. more components, but it would work. Schottky diodes have modest forward voltage drop, depending on temperature.<br>  <br>  Even with regular diodes, there is some voltage drop. Be aware that LED's have bigger voltage drops than regular diodes. White and blue ones are over 3V per diode, and there are two diode drops on each path of the bridge. I would go with low voltage drop red or green ones, though you still won't get 12VDC out. <br>  <br>  You also need to check the current  capability of the diode; the  large voltage drop increases the heat produced which limits the allowable forward current. Some specs limit the current, others the temperature of the die.<br>  <br>  BTW, an LED driver is an IC designed to produce current to drive LED's.

7lvE9g9Kaa	In a way yes it could, but it probably won't be used for something like food and there may be laws restricting its use when it does become available.    Something strictly making an object appear would need enough energy to create the mass of the object, this is what the replicators do. So, from E = mc^2, you can tell that for even a tiny object you would need vast quantities of energy. If you made a full meal this way it would be more than enough to make the rest of the world goes without power until you are done.    The other option is to make stuff out of nano particles. This is possible and plausible. Unfortunately it seems unlikely that we could make food this way. Sadly we would be able to make something dangerous this way (ie a weapon) much more easily than food or medicine. This is why I think there will be an awful lot of laws for these things if they ever are made. The laws are likely to stop us ever reaching the point where foods could be made that way.|`|3OCx9lsOaa	I could be!  They have already developed a 3D copying machine that can copy solid structures using a plastic resin!    http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/31...|`|8cLV2OPYaa	Certainly it can. I can even tell you how to do it. Unfortunately when you realize how much it would cost you might not be so enthusiastic.     First you need significantly advanced nanotechnology. Most of what needs to happen we can already do, we just can't do it small enough.  Next, you need to build an extremely powerful fusion reactor that you will use to "fuse" atoms together into the elements that you need. You would be able to produce a rather wide variety of elements if you only had various isotopes of hydrogen, helium, lithium, and other light gasses.     ( I am not certain of exactly all the light elements you would need to start with in order to make most of the elements that you would likely need for most basic objects we use frequently. I am certain that there are objects that would be nearly impossible to produce. )     Then you need to build a chemical laboratory/foundry on the nano scale to combine and refine the elements into exactly the compounds you need. It will be much more difficult if you intend to use a replicator to produce organic matter. Then you will need to build a nano scale manufacturing facility inside the device that can "assemble" the compounds into the finished form of what you want. Then you need to be able to teleport the finished product into a hopper that can be accessed by the person ordering the object.     The teleportation part is the tough part. We have only been able to teleport light so far. We are a very long ways away from teleporting matter i am afraid. We are, however, fairly close to both nano-technology and fusion technology. It is a fairly good bet that the first "replicators" will simply be just like a "star trek" one, minus the teleportation effect. In other words, you would actually have to mechanically "deliver" the object to a safe extraction hopper located somewhere away from the reactor and other sensitve equipment. Whether that is done by magnetic levitating trays or platforms on a type of high tech "conveyor" or if it is done by forklift and handtruck is largely a matter of convenience and cost.    Obviously the computer alone necessary to run this machine would make our most advanced laptops look like preschool toys, but we COULD build it.     The question is why be in a rush to build something that we could not even afford to operate. the electrical cost alone of the magnets in the fusion reactor would bankrupt a small nation. there are many other things we need to accomplish first that would make building something like this a relatively simple matter, and perhaps even efficient. We should not get ahead of ourselves, we will only waste money that could be going towards accomplishing far more useful tasks.|`|DrwY7dJCaa	Not anytime soon, as we still can't fully manipulate single atoms.|`|GYt7QTJpaa	Sure, technology don't surprise me anymore!|`|27bc701367843ae2833d9bcda8c0f992aa	theoretical yes|`|74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa	Nope.    There is one main reason for this unequivocal answer.  The Heisman Uncertainty Principle disallows manipulating subatomic particles deterministically.  There will always be some uncertainty between the location and momentum of each and every particle in whatever we wish to replicate.  This means we cannot now or ever put atoms and their constituents back together exactly like they were before the replication attempt.    Star Trek is a fun show, but it is filled with false physics.  If you browse the web for "star trek physics," you'll find a lot of sources that address the bad physics Star Trek uses to entertain us.|`|tTC74bEjaa	I don't think so. To create a copy of something implies that you can create something out of nothing, but that's just not possible. It may be possible that, in the future, we'll be able to somehow transform certain materials into other objects, effectively "replicating" them.

9ec7BBgpaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  This is my first attempt at an answer on Yahoo! Answers, so be gentle with me. :)<br>  <br>  I find it always helps to draw graphs as a visual aid to what is going on. I couldn't work this out until I drew some diagrams.<br>  <br>  The main thing to understand is that you can take a graph of y = f(x) for any function f and translate it by adding constants to x and y.<br>  <br>  For example, the graph of y - b = f(x - a) is identical to the graph of y = f(x) except that it is shifted a units to the right and b units up.<br>  <br>  For those who don't know, |x| is the absolute value of x.<br>  I.e. |x| = x for x >= 0; |x| = -x for x < 0<br>  <br>  The graph of y = |x| looks like a big "V", with the corner at (0, 0), and the two lines going off like y = -x to the left and y = x to the right.<br>  <br>  Draw a graph of y = |x - 8|. It will be the same but translated 8 units to the right, i.e. a big "V" with the corner at (8, 0). Call this Graph A.<br>  <br>  Now draw a graph of y = |x + a| + b. You get the same "V" shape, but with the corner at (-a, b). Call this Graph B.<br>  <br>  What you want is for Graph A to coincide with Graph B for all points with x ≤ 5. That is, you want the left arms of the two "V"s to merge when x = 5.<br>  <br>  Substituting into the equation for Graph A, x = 5 implies y = |5 - 8| = |-3| = 3. So the graphs have to merge at the point (5, 3).<br>  <br>  Since the graphs need to go their separate ways for x > 5, we know that this point must be the corner of one of them. It's not the corner of Graph A, because that is at (8, 0). So it must be the corner of Graph B.<br>  <br>  Since we already know that the corner of Graph B is at (-a, b), we now have that (-a, b) = (5, 3).<br>  <br>  So a = -5, and b = 3.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!
GbLmBcIoaa	When an object is close to you, each of your eyes has an obviously different perspective of the object.  For example, if you hold your finger in front of your nose and close one eye at a time, you will see that the right eye has a very different perspective of the finger than the left eye.  Your brain puts the images together, and also takes into account how much your eyes are pointing inward, to figure out how far away the image is.  As your finger moves away from your nose, the difference in the angles of the eyes gets less and less.  If you're looking at distant mountains, both eyes are seeing the same image, and both are pointing straight forward, so the only way to judge which mountain is farther is by other techniques, like how obscured it is by the air, or whether one is in front of another.|`|WPPIaLORaa	Binocular vision for depth perception depends on different views of the same object seen by both eyes.

The further the object is away, the more similar is the angle and the less the contribution of having two eyes. You start using things like knowing the size, whether one object obscures another and so on instead.     You can easily test this. Put your finger somewhere in front of you. Close first one eye then the other. See how the finger seems to move sideways, depending which eye you use.   Look at something far away or at least across the room. Repeat. Do you still see lateral movement?    If you still have a problem understanding it, draw an example. It's simple geometry.

nTKuRFlKaa	*Soil compaction occurs when weight of livestock or heavy machinery compresses soil, causing it to lose pore space. Affected soils become less able to absorb rainfall, thus increasing runoff and erosion. Plants have difficulty in compacted soil because the mineral grains are pressed together, leaving little space for air and water, which are essential for root growth. Burrowing animals also find a hostile environment, because the denser soil is more difficult to penetrate.<br>  <br>  Increasing the density of soil, along with its side effects of increased strength and decreased permeability, is usually desirable in earthwork construction and below building foundations. Compaction is accomplished by use of heavy equipment. In sands and gravels, the equipment usually vibrates, to cause re-orientation of the soil particles into a denser configuration. In silts and clays, a sheepsfoot roller is frequently used, to create small zones of intense shearing, which drives air out of the soil.<br>  <br>  The result of soil compaction is measured by determining the bulk density of the compacted soil and comparing it to a maximum density, for example, obtained from a Proctor compaction test, to determine the relative compaction.|`|6XIDmojtaa	typically its referred to as compressing a surface to prepare it to be graded and road base then finally asphalt or concrete road surfaces, drainage or irrigation  trenches/spillways.

2lQ8DJAcaa	ENERGY FROM THE SUN<br>  The sun has produced energy for billions of years.  Solar energy is the sun’s rays (solar radiation) that reach the earth. <br>  <br>  Solar energy can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heat and electricity.  In the 1830s, the British astronomer John Herschel used a solar thermal collector box (a device that absorbs sunlight to collect heat) to cook food during an expedition to Africa. Today, people use the sun's energy for lots of things. <br>  <br>  Solar energy can be converted to thermal (or heat) energy and used to: <br>  <br>  Heat water – for use in homes, buildings, or swimming pools.<br>  <br>  Heat spaces – inside greenhouses, homes, and other buildings.<br>  <br>  Solar energy can be converted to electricity in two ways:<br>  <br>  Photovoltaic (PV devices) or “solar cells” – change sunlight directly into electricity. PV systems are often used in remote locations that are not connected to the electric grid.  They are also used to power watches, calculators, and lighted road signs.<br>  <br>  Solar Power Plants -  indirectly generate electricity when the heat from solar thermal collectors is used to heat a fluid which produces steam that is used to power generator. Out of the 15 known solar electric generating units operating in the United States at the end of 2006, 10 of these are in California, and 5 in Arizona. No statistics are being collected on solar plants that produce less than 1 megawatt of electricity, so there may be smaller solar plants in a number of other states.|`|A4G03Bzbaa	That means energy from the sun.

The gumamela flower comes in many colors: red, yellow, orange, white, purple, pink and other color combinations.<br>  <br>  Gumamela leaves, usually blended with Rose Hip has long been used in the Middle East and Okinawa as herbal tea. Today, the use of gumamela tea is gaining worldwide popularity - including Asia. Gumamela (Hibiscus) is associated with longevity.<br>  <br>  Gumamela as Herbal Medicine<br>  As herbal medicine, gumamela flower, leaves and roots are used. Gumamela has the following medicinal characteristics: expectorant, diuretic, emollient, anti-infectious, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, anodyne and refrigerant.<br>  <br>  Preparation & Use of Gumamela:<br>  There are two ways to utilize gumamela as herbal medicine. One is dried and the other is fresh. For Dried gumamela, collect the flower, leaves and/or roots. Wash, then cut into small pieces and sun dry. To use as decoction, boil the dried gumamela parts (1/4 cup dried gumamela in 1 glass of water). <br>  <br>  To make a decoction from fresh gumamela, Wash gumamela flower and/or leaves, cut into small pieces and boil (1/3 cup in 1 glass of water), let cool and drink.<br>  <br>  Use Gumamela as Poultice:<br>  Poultice is the use or fresh or dried herbs that is mashed, crushed or pounded - often heated (boiled in water to soften and heat the herb) and applied directly to the skin. A clean cloth or gauze can be used to help the poultice stay in place.

6eec006b47776bf59f7d10ddfd203e0caa	Aristotle disbelieved the ancient Greek theory of atoms being of different sizes, regular geometric shapes and beig in constant motion. He didn't think atoms could be in constant motion in a void. He developed the theroy that all matter consisted of four elements: Earth, Air, Water and Fire. There were also four qualities: dryness, hotness, coldness, and moistness. Fire was dry and hot, water was moist and cold, etc. Each of these elements move naturally in a line to their "proper place," where it will be at rest. Aristotle's theory also had two forces: conflict and harmony. Conflict was thought to cause bad things, and harmony good things. Aristotle also believed that the heavens were made of a fifth, superior element named aither. Aristotle's theory was used for almost 2000 years, until after the scientific revolution, when other theories prevailed.

AA11513203	At the risk of repeating what the others have said:<br>  <br>  >"1 How did the male and female sex's evolve from asexual organisms?"<br>  <br>  This is two separate questions.   The first is the evolution of sexual reproduction from asexual.   And second is the evolution of specialized sexes.    <br>  <br>  In other words, :<br>  (a) There are *many* examples in nature (from slime mold amoebas, to volvox, to aphids) that show that species can switch between both asexual and sexual reproduction *in the same species*.  So the assumption that there is a huge gap between asexual and sexual reproduction is false.<br>  (b) There are *many* examples in nature (from the flowering plants, to banana slugs, to some kinds of reptiles) that show that species can undergo sexual reproduction without individuals being genetically split into males and females.  So the assumption that there is a huge gap between no sexes, to separate males and females is also false.<br>  <br>  A full explanation for both of these would take a lot of room ... but i hope at least that this shows that this doesn't pose as much of a problem for evolution as you thought.<br>  <br>  > 2. How did birds evolve? ....<br>  <br>  When asking about the evolution of birds, don't just focus on the wings and their modern function of airborne flight!   Evolution makes no sense if you only focus on one small part or one isolated function.    <br>  <br>  First, there obviously are many, many examples of flightless birds in the world, and their flightless wings are not "useless stubs".   Have you ever tried to catch a chicken or turkey ... or watched an ostrich, run?   (An ostrich can run 40 mph!)   When they run, they flap their "useless stubs", which gives them lift.   A chicken or turkey can hop up to surfaces many times its own height, and hop down without injury.<br>  <br>  Second, don't forget all the other features that makes a bird: feathers that are both lightweight and outstanding insulation, hollow bones for lightness, small brains for lightness, enlarged heart and lungs for sustained energy.   All of these things can evolve slowly to make a birds lighter and lighter, more and more agile, and better and better adapted to running from predators, or chasing small prey.   The evolution of wings is just a small part of the evolution of birds.<br>  <br>  So the defining feature that birds have in common is not flight ... but *agility*.    Once you understand that, then you can see how the birds evolved ... as ever more agile animals that went from running, to flapping, to hopping, to gliding, to soaring, to full airborne flight.    When you can see that, then flightless wings do not appear as "useless stubs" anymore.<br>  <br>  >3. "Why are there no transitional fossil records?"<br>  <br>  The Creationist sites that tell you that "no transitional fossils have ever been found" are flat-out LYING.    No scientist has ever imagined that fossils are so plentiful that they appear as a continuous "movie" of evolution.   They are more like extremely rare snapshots ... dusty photographs of the tiny percentage of species that were "lucky" enough to die in an environment where fossilization can happen.   Of course each fossil species is "complete" .... in that it survived just fine in its environment ... but some of the *individuals* survived *better* and slowly changed, or branched into multiple species if populations got genetically isolated from each other.   <br>  <br>  And second, there is absolutely nothing in the theory of evolution that says that evolution *must* continue at a steady pace.    A species can exist for millions of years in a fairly stable form, well adapted to its environment, and leaving a fossil here and there ... but then an epidemic, or a drought, or a flood, or a new predator, or a parasite, or a rival species, or an asteroid collision, or a geological disaster, or a new niche, or a land-bridge to a new environment, or a new source of food (etc.) can occur that alters the environment significantly enough that there is a population crisis, or a migration of a founding population in the new environment.  And individuals at the fringes ... the individuals with some extreme features ... survive better.   And the result that appears in the *fossil record* is what *appears* to be a fairly abrupt change, or a splitting off of a significantly different species or branch.  But it is only "abrupt" in geological timescales ... say 100 million years of relative stability, with dramatic change occurring within the "abrupt" space of "only" 5 million years.   <br>  <br>  So those two things ... the rarity of the fossil record, and the jerky *pace* of evolution (called 'punctuated equilibrium') explain fully why the fossil record is what it is ... many, many, many "transitional fossils" where each species appears to be relatively stable.   <br>  <br>  <br>  So be careful when relying on those anti-evolution sites to give you honest information about evolution.  They have an interest in explaining evolution *BADLY*, and in selectively leaving out the very information that has convinced the overwhelming majority of the world's scientists of the validity of evolution.  If you want to know why scientists accept evolution, then ask one of those scientists ... read a book written by them, go to sites like UC Berkley's excellent evolution site (<a href="http://evolution.berkeley.edu)." rel="nofollow">http://evolution.berkeley.edu).</a>  <br>  <br>  Going only to anti-evolution sites for information about evolution, would be like going only to anti-Christian sites for information about Christianity.|`|aaC2Qx1Uaa	> "1 How did the male and female sex's evolve from asexual organisms?"<br>  <br>  Even asexual bacteria have the ability to conjugate and exchange genetic material.<br>  As soon as diploidy arose (from a simple nondisjunction event), it would become possible to "swap" genetic material and recombine it into an organism with a new genome: this would be the first example of sexual reproduction (and would be well before the emergence of two seperate genders).<br>  <br>  Specialisation of the two sex cells into sperm and eggs (one motile, and the other containing an energy store) would eventually lead to hermaphroditic organisms (making both sperm and eggs) - which include many still-extant sexually-reproducing organisms. Only after this would the specilisation into male and femal occur.<br>  <br>  > "#2 How did birds evolve?Example when a lizard or whatever started to evolve into a bird it would only have stubs growing out of it,and for millions of years these useless stubs kept growing/evolving until one day the they were able to fly?"<br>  <br>  That assumes the only purpose to such "proto-wings" would be for flight.<br>  They can be used for balance, for gliding, for display.

When single-celled eukaryotic organisms began reproducing with a diploid / haploid life cycle, there was a benefit to avoiding self-fertilization.  Mating types prevent this.  Some have two mating types, but greater numbers exist.  Some fungi have more than 1,000.  Where specialized gametes exist, two sexes are optimal, since two gametes fuse.<br>  <br>  #2 How did birds evolve?<br>  How useful were the stubby arms of a T-rex?

8Y7LQ6TGaa	what is the question?<br>  <br>  Lasers can transmit a simple voice signal over very long distances, and a lot of power is not required. You just need a good design.<br>  <br>  .|`|4fWZL4TRaa	I cannot see the circuit as this is a subscription site.<br>  <br>  Not sure what you mean by a normal laser, perhaps a laser pointer. If you can modulate the laser by analogue or digital means, and transmit the signal to a photodiode so that most of the beam lands on the active surface it will work. If it is an infrared laser it might be difficult to get it all lined up, but a visible one is easy. If you can see the spot on a piece of paper near the receiver it will work. You may need to shield the photodiode from sunlight, and if the diode is too big (area) it will respond too slowly. However sizes a few millimeters square will work. You need an amplifier at the diode.

E11gNiGNaa	There are several formulas for kinematics, but they all derive from the fundamental definitions of acceleration and average speed.  Different substitutions give different formulas, depending on which variables are given or are implicitly stated.  For free fall, you simply substitute g for a, always noting which direction you have chosen to be positive.  g is always downward, so your choice reflects its algebraic sign.  In your problem, you know that the initial speed is zero, the distance fallen is 5 ft and the time to fall is 0.5 s.  If you use feet as the distance unit, be sure to have g as 32 ft/s^2.<br>  <br>  Let h be the distance fallen in time t and let the downward direction be positive.  Then one of the formulas gives you<br>  <br>              h = v(0) t + 1/2 g t^2 = 1/2 g t^2<br>  <br>  You can now solve for t.  As for the maximum force, that is another problem for which you have presented insufficient data.  The force of impact is the change in momentum and that involves the impact time and knowing the speed of the object at impact (which you can solve from the initial data)

Then 4 weeks (1 month) + 3 months + 6 weeks (1.5 months) = 5.5 months, leaving 6.5 months. In reality our seasons go from the winter solstice to the spring equinox to the summer solstice to the fall equinox, and each period is 3 months plus or minus a few days since our orbit is close to, but NOT circular. As an ellipse, the seasons DO vary in length because the equinoxes and solstices are affected by the eccentricity of the orbit. If we had an exactly circular orbit, the seasons would be exactly 1/4th .of each orbit. Remember, our seasons come from the 23 degree tilt of the axis, NOT the distance from the sun.|`|zgVLOXsZaa	6 months and 2 weeks
Wagcdklxaa	Break down the distances travelled depending on what the acceleration is. However, I have a few questions of my own to properly solve the problem    1. What are the stipulated conditions from t = 0 to t =1? There is no mention of the acceleration during this interval. Only the acceleration after t = 1 is mentioned.    2. What does this mean " after 2 secs the acc is 2m/s^s etc etc until 4 sec the acc is 4m/s^2"? Does this mean that the acceleration is 2 m/sec^2 from t = 2 to t = 3? If so, does it follow that the acceleration from t= 3 to t = 4 is 4 m/sec^2?     Anyway, whatever the stipulated conditions are, as mentioned above, simply break down the distance travelled per appropriate time intervals.    Useful working formulas are:    D = Vo(T) + (1/2)(a)T^2    D = (1/2)aT^2 (for the interval where velocity is constant)    Vf - Vo = aT    where    D = distance travelled at a given time interval  Vo = initial velocity of car (at start of interval)  T = time interval involved  a = acceleration at any given time interval  Vf = final velocity of car (at end of interval)    Hope this helps.|`|SYZQZGesaa	If you wish to work the formula yourself rather than just get the answer, figure the distance for each second. Add them. Take the square root to get the base time in seconds. This removes seconds squared from your answer.|`|mwtNY4sTaa	Assuming the non-constant acceleration is increases linearly with time, ie a = t m/s^2, then the total acceleration from time 0 to time 4 seconds is the same as an average acceleration of 2 m/s^2 applied from 0 to 4 seconds.  This is because the acceleration v. time plot is a 45 degree line, meaning the area under the curve is exactly half of 4 seconds * 4 m/s^2, or = 8 m/s^2*s = 2 m/s^2 * 4 seconds.    use the average acceleration to figure the position change from 0-4 seconds using the equation:    p = 1/2*a*t^2+Vo*t; assuming Vo = 0 this reduces to p = 1/2*a*t^2;    p will be in meters.    you can determine the fixed velocity for seconds 4 to 6 by plugging the average acceleration into the formula:    Velocity = acceleration * time;    once you have the fixed velocity and time it is elementary to find the distance traveled during the fixed period and add it to the position change during the first four seconds.|`|NSQaDOhYaa	I take it that the acceleration a increases uniformly and linearly with time from the start, that is, da/dt = k = 1 from the figures given. At any time t the acceleration is obtained by integrating this to a = a0 + k.t, where a0 is the initial acceleration - like the other initial parameters, s0 and v0, this is zero since the car starts from rest.    If a = dv/ds = k.t, we may obtain the velocity at time t by integrating again, with v0 = 0, to give v = (k.t^2)/2, and then the distance travelled s by integrating v = ds/dt to give s = (k.t^3)/6.     So after 4 s the car has travelled a distance of (4^3)/6 = 64/6 m and has a velocity of (4^2)/2 = 8 m.s^(-1). (Sorry, the k wasn't really needed - it's just my training in dimensional analysis). At that point the rate of change of acceleration and the acceleration drop to zero and the car coasts on at 8 m.s^(-1) for a further 2 seconds, covering an additional 16 m to make a total of 26.67 m.    Note added: the distance travelled in the first 4 seconds is considerably less than that obtained above. This is due to the fact that the car starts from rest with zero velocity and zero acceleration, and takes a significant amount of time to 'get under way'. The assumption that a constant acceleration (of 2 m.s^2) can be applied over the whole of this period reduces this effect, but is invalid.

96145621c75947c84171b675f275b9cbaa	Sample size in scientific experiments generally refers to the number of observations being made. For example, for sample size of 4 (also referred to as n = 4) there would be 4 individual observations. These could be 4 different people, 4 different animals, 4 different cars, etc. It has importance in trying to evaluate your data on a statistical basis. The greater the number of observations, the greater is the power of the statistical tests. So doing statistics on 100 observations is infinitely more powerful than using only 4 observations.

If you purchase a small electric heater of any kind at all and use it as a portable, personal heater , allowing you to lower the setting of the thermostat for the whole house, you will save some money. If you do not live alone you will also hear some complaints.   You can do the equivalent by , er, dressing more warmly and not purchasing anything.   To cover all the bases, maybe the Amish are selling knit sweaters too.  One of the responses here is just another ad for such much-to-do-about-nothing quartz heaters.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Pretty much no.  All resistive type electric heaters are 100% efficient in the sense that they convert 100% of the electricity they consume into heat.  Since you can't have more than 100% efficiency each electric heater converts electricity to heat as well as every other one.  It is converting heat to electricity that is costly.    I've seen some of those ads.  The ones by "Eden Pure" are deliberately misleading.  Get a Holmes or DeLonghi or some other name brand from a local merchant and save a load of money and hassles.|`|oXPDFw4daa	The old saying is "how do you know that the sales person is lying?  His lips are moving!"    I tend to discredit advertising claims about efficiency and savings as mainly hype.    Infrared heaters are relatively efficient in two respects:    1.  the conversion of electricity to heat is quite efficient    2.  infrared heaters tend to work by heating objects rather than air.  That means that proportionately more energy goes into heating people in the area than in the air in the area.    On the other hand, the cost of energy in its electrical form is much greater than in the form of some other fuel (such as natural gas or even heating oil).  I think I would want to test the assertion with some real numbers before making that investment.|`|e0WfWpwTaa	I answer this and many other Infrared Heater questions at my web site: http://www.theinfraredheatsource.com    Here you can find information, read reviews and compare prices.

4b9ac58e789dd7441f61926ee404111faa	The way the food and drug administration judges the safety and efficacy of a medication is through a long series of clinical trials. First in animal or cell models, then in humans. No medication is 100% 'safe', that is, you will never suffer any adverse effects if you take it correctly in the correct dose. FDA approval merely means that for the indication (the symptom or disease the drug is meant to treat) the benefits of taking the medication outweigh the risks for the majority of people.   That does not mean that a small percentage of people who take a medication will not experience some kind of serious side effect or unintended consequence. This could be due to a number of factors, including genetic variations, abnormal immune system responses (allergic reactions) interactions with other medications or foods, or contamination of the drug lot (very, very, very rare) with a foreign substance or microbe.   Even Aspirin, which has been around for over 150 years, is not 100% safe. Some people can developed life-threatening allergic responses to a medication the first time they take it.  That is not to say that 'natural' herbal remedies are 100% safe either. A small percentage of the population can also have serious side effects or adverse events as a result of taking these. Some people have suffered irreversible liver damage as a result of taking mistletoe, kava or Ba Hua herbal remedies.  Chances are, if you take an approved drug as prescribed and according to the instructions on the label, you will experience relief of your symptoms and suffer no ill effects. No medication should ever be mixed with alcohol.|`|3f49d1173ab44657705ae3106bb11dc6aa	No, of course not.      In fact, in general ALL medicines are NOT safe.  Medicines are a unnatural perturbation to your system.  They should only be taken if your system is imbalanced or under attack and the detrimental effects of the medicine is out weighed by the positive effects of returning your system to balance|`|K2xgBbFPaa	only if they say they wont cause dizziness|`|keNFLjG3aa	yes if you take it according to what your body needs....no when you take it indiscriminately....
Cc2Yb9DKaa	The molecular forces go to a higher energy state when stretched.  As the energy state returns to normal, the material snaps back.  Some molecules express this higher energy state more forcefully than other materials.  Some materials separate (absorb the energy to create the fracture) or dissipate the higher energy as heat, like bending metal.    Materials that stretch and return to their original shape demonstrate the property of elasticity.  The materials structure wants to stay that shape, but it can be changed or deformed by applying a countering force.  Pulling the material changes the shape and stores energy as the forces counter the tendency for the material to return to a relaxed state.  Releasing the material, transforms the energy from potential to kinetic energy as the elastic releases the energy stored in its deformed shape.|`|jgEvnYNlaa	Do your own homework. It has to do with the properties of rubber.|`|AA11002089	elasticity =the property of a substance that enables it to change its length, volume, or shape in direct response to a force effecting such a change and to recover its original form upon the removal of the force.  so the answer is due to elasticity in it
YbVFL3SOaa	You need both medicine (SSRI) and behavior therapy (exposure and response prevention).  These methods combined give one the best chance of controlling the OCD.  I do not know where you live but get in touch with the Obsessive Compulsive Foundation (OCF) I believe they are in Connecticut.  They should be able to refer you to an appropriate therapist in your area.  As has been previously stated, get a therapist who has been trained in Behavior Therapy because not all therapists are knowledgeable in the treatment of OCD.|`|mCAWxobNaa	You need to schedule a consult with a psychiatrist as soon as humany possible to get this under control.    All my best to you|`|2rdXW293aa	My sister had OCD, which started with her about age 8 or 9. She finally consulted a therapist when she was about 25 .... please don't wait that long! But do get a referral from your primary care physician to someone good. Not all psychiatrists, psychologists and other therapists are "created equal." Nor is every psychiatrist worth the money you pay him or her. Choose carefully.    I wish you the best of luck. Remember that a qualified therapist has heard your story many times before, and been successful treating it. OCD is not at all uncommon.
Wagcdklxaa	Using Newton's 2nd Law of Motion,    F = ma    where    F = applied force = 94 N (given)  m = mass of the object  a = acceleration of the object = 0.60 m/sec^2 (given)    Substituting values,    94 = m(0.60)    and solving for "m",    m = 94/0.60    m = 156.67 kg.    Hope this helps.|`|NWcBNAgdaa	Force (N or Newtons) is mass x acceleration.    Therefore:  94 = m x 0.60    Simply rearrange your equation and you get:  m = 94 / 0.60    The result is in kilograms

But in all seriousness, without formally taking a look at exactly what kind of damage that's there and just how bad it is, it'd be remiss to to tell you to do one thing as opposed to something else.  If you cut off a piece of skin that's like 1 inch in size, that's a fairly sizable piece of skin/tissue.  I'm concerned that you may get an infection and then the situation can get even worse.  I implore that you have a physician take a look at exactly what's going.on.  It may sound like overkill, but trust me, sometimes things that look pretty innocuous later turn out to be a problem, so please do us both a favor and have it look at by a professional.    Please keep the area as clean as possible, applying betadine or neosporin if there are no contraindications (reasons which make it inappropriate).     Good luck with everything.|`|gat4KThKaa	Get well soon.|`|OXw0rv4Saa	Agred- keep an eye on it, and keep it really clean.  Use clean bandages, change them frequently.  Use iodine, betadine, or neosporin to keep it clean instead of peroxide- it works better and lasts longer.  Since it's already healing funny, my guess is that that little piece is going to die rather than be able to reconnect with your toe.    If it starts collecting dirt, it may be better to just clip it off with some nail clippers.    Get well soon!

b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	e. A, B, and C     Water loss doesn't seem like an advantage, but evaporation from the leaves is part of the transpiration-tension process which can move water from the roots up to the tops of tall trees.
lJ2XG0QMaa	well I could just tell you but you need to learn...  so NOT A, because if the stem is tall it takes a loooong time to get the water.  NOT B because what the heck does a stem have to do with reproduction!  Not C because nutrients come from the roots area not the stem.  D-yes because tall stem is closer to the sun and further away from the other short plants around it.  NOT E because a tall stem makes the plant wobbly and tall.  Ok there you go. Did you learn?
b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	Of those, the best response (and the one that your teacher wants) is:  d. Green algae live in many temporary habitats     There are plenty of organisms that live in temporary habitats, that aren't particularly related.    Response E is also a valid response.  There are other photosynthesizers that aren't related to plants at all, such as halobacteria.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halobacteri...
5al0K3N0aa	If he's genuinely showing an interest, then you'll want something that will keep that going for at least a few months or so.    For 150 I would recommend the SkyWatcher130P. Its a newtonian reflector on manual equatorial mount. And if you don't know what that means then you'll need to do a bit of background reading yourself. I doubt that he'll be able to use anything even reasonably decent without some help from either you or his dad.     This telescope has good optics and will allow you to see the Moon and planets (Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) in great detail. It is optically great for the money and will extend his interest if he really gets into it. Once you have got used to using it and know the sky a bit better, then you'll be able to see some nice galaxies and nebulae.    There are a few places in the UK where you can mail order this. Make no mistake that it will undoubtedly be larger than you think. But it'll only take about 10mins to set up and start using.     Like I said, you'll need a bit of background reading to have an idea of whats going on and to be able to find things.     Have a look at it here;  http://www.uk-telescopes.co.uk/sky_watch...    I would recommend buying some astronomy magazines if you don't already. Astronomy Now (a UK one) is the best selling in the UK, also Sky and Telescope (US), at WHSmiths. These will help give you a feel for astronomy, and will give you some info on using telescopes.    ***Update***  I just looked at the post above and at Amazon. They have some good ones on there. Please don't go for the 40/50 pound ones, you'll end up kicking it out of frustration.    This one is very good for the price though;  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Celestron-Astrom...    It's as good as the last one optically, but the mount has a motor drive so you'll be able to follow things as they move across the sky (you'll find this out soon).     That is best one you'll get for your money. Again, you'll be surprised how big and heavy it is, so get dad to set it up.    Hope you have fun with it.|`|kF5WGHxvaa	the boy is only 10 try something from walmart,before u spend a bundle.his intrests might change. also what u see in a telescope wont look like it does on tv.|`|f1beDbKIaa	150 British pounds = 216.51 U.S. dollars    You're in luck.  There is an excellent scope for this amount. Barely.    http://www.telescope.com/control/product...    This is a 4.5" Newtonian reflecting telescope on a Dobsonian style mount. The mount is stable - it's one of only two stable telescope mounts that can be had for 150. It fits in your car.  It sets up quickly.  It's designed for astronomy.  Orion has excellent after sales support. Though the scope is a complete system by itself, you can get carry cases, filters, other eyepieces, solar filters and so on for it.    Unfortunately, this is about half the money needed to get a scope that has a computer that can help you find things in the sky.

Different cells respond separately to red, green and blue light.    A good approximation is given by the RGB colour system used for computers which combines 256 levels of red, blue and green to produce nearly 17 million discrete colours.

It is nothing special. And there cannot be any new colors invented, every single possible color already exists, but they can be discovered. Even if there was a new color, you treat it just like any other color, either "oh, that's a nice color" or "EW, what an ugly color". As an experienced artist, I know that every possible color is already known to the human eye.
wfhZ5JuEaa	An element contains a single type of atom from the periodic table.    A compound contains a single type of molecule, made up from multiple types of atoms from the periodic table.    A mixture contains many types of molecules, made up from multiple types of atoms from the periodic table.    Table sugar - Either a compound or mixture depending on what is in it.  If its an artificial sweetener, it is probably a mixture of several compounds.  If it is pure sucrose, and nothing else, then it is a just a single compound.    Soil - A mixture.  Soil is made up of minerals, decaying organic matter, and whatever else happens to have been mixed in.    Nickel - An element.  Nickel is a metal from the periodic table, with the symbol Ni.  If it is pure Nickel (ie, not an alloy of nickel, or like, a coin) then it would classify as an element because it contains only atoms of Ni.    Aluminum foil - Technically a mixture.  Aluminum when exposed to air forms a 'passivation layer' where it reacts with oxygen, and so the foil (regardless of whatever else is included mixed in, or layered on top) could never be truely pure aluminum and nothing but.  The spirit of the question might want you to say element though... your call.    Copper - In this context, I think they want you to say element.  Much like Nickel, Copper is an element on the periodic table, with a chemical symbol Cu (in latin, its 'cuprum').    Ice Tea Mix - Mixture.  It includes all sorts of dehydrated flavoring, colorant, sugar, etc.  Lots of different compounds.

Tx8JHmDvaa	noble gas configuration is when the atoms have 8 electrons in its outer shell.     if the atom is an element from groups 1, 2, or 13, the atom has to give up electrons to make it have 8. For example, if you have Boron in group 13, it has 3 valence electrons, making it more likely to give up electrons than gain them. If you take 3 electrons from Boron, you get Helium. Helium is the noble-gas for Boron. B(+3) has a noble-gas configuration of He.    if the atom is an element from groups 15, 16, or 17, the atom has to gain electrons to make it have 8. For example, if you have Oxygen with 6 valence electrons, it is more likely to gain electrons than lose them. If 2 electrons are added to Oxygen the noble-gas configuration becomes Neon. O(-2) has a noble-gas configuration of Ne.    if the atom is an element in group 14, it can either gain or lose electrons. so the noble gas configuration could be the 4 electrons less or 4 electrons more than it. For example, if you add 4 electrons to Carbon you get Neon but if you take away 4 electrons you get Helium.    thats better:  1. I has noble gas configuration [Xe] because it has to add an  electron   2. Sr has noble gas configuration [Kr] because it has to lose 2  electrons  3. N has noble gas configuration [Ne] because it has to gain 3 electrons  4. Kr has noble gas [Kr] because it already has 8 electrons in its outershell thus fulfilling the octet rule!|`|X0e6p9Ilaa	What atoms?    Consider some salts:  When such a compound dissociates to form ions, then the more electronegative element will "take" the electrons that will give it an octet of electrons, which is an inert gas arrangement.  In the gase of alkali metals, or alkaline earth metals, the lost electrons will give the cation an inert gas arrangement.    In the case of compounds which have a greater covalent character, the electrons are shared so that each atom appears to have an octet of electrons.    Ah, that's better.    Iodine can form anions, by gaining an electron when iodine is the more electronegative atom, as in NaI.   Or iodine can share electrons to get to an octet when the bonds are more covalent.  Either way iodine will have filled outermost s and p orbitals and be isoelectronic with Xe.    Strontium can lose two electrons as it dissociates to form Sr2+ ions.  The resulting ion has an octet, an inert gas configuration for the highest energy sublevels, and therefore as the same electron arrangement as krypton.    Nitrogen can do essentially the same as iodine, except it can gain three electrons to form a nitride ion, or share three additional electrons to get an octet of electrons, and be isoelectronic with neon.    Krypton IS an inert gas and already has an octet (flled s and  p sublevels) and therefore does not react.|`|zWZe6wA0aa	The atoms being...?

JWa78QVoaa	The price of a barrel of oil and the price of a MCF of natural gas have fallen dramatically.  The drop seems to greatly effect the price at the pump, but in actuality it has caused mass layoffs and further injured the economy.  It's certainly a double edged sword.
ejodXS5naa	I don't have a problem with the word theory for this context.  A theory can be well tested or poorly tested.  It is still a theory.  Just because it is a theory does not make it as 'set in stone' as you seem to think it does.  And some theories are much more tenuous than others.  Obviously the theory of gravity is pretty solid.  And to a large extent the theory of relativity and quantum theory are reasonably well established (to the point that *almost* no one doubts them).  But string theory is little more than a guess and has very little evidence to support it, yet it is still a theory.  I think you should lower your bar for what makes a theory.    As far as electrons never being observed, I have to object to that.  I don't know exactly what you mean by electrons have never been observed, but I can name a number of experiments that have observed electrons.  Electron guns shoot off electrons, and when you put that beam of electrons in a low-pressure gas and a magnetic field, you can see the beam fluorescing in the gas as the field deforms it into a circle.  From that field, you can calculate the charge-to-mass ratio for the electron.  Given these two things (you can see it and you know its charge to mass ratio), you have observed a specific charged particle with a specific charge-to-mass ratio, which is an electron.  This experiment is... 100 years old or more.  We can also see single electrons pop on and off quantum-dots and single-electron-transistors (SETs).  And there are plenty of other such experiments.  So if you can observe a quantized particle with quantized charge and mass, then I would say you are seeing electrons.      You might be using the word 'observe' to mean optically observe.  In he first experiment, you aren't actually seeing the electrons, but you are seeing the fluorescence from the gas as the electrons slam into it.  So you could be claiming that that is not 'optically observing' the electrons directly.  But electrons are physically to small to be optically observed on a fundamental level.  Waves (such as light waves) can only image items that are larger than half the wavelength.  Since free electrons are smaller than any wave length, no wave can possibly image them.  But I think the notion that optical observation is necessary for confirmation of existence is a misguided notion.  The fact of the matter is we never really directly observe anything.  There is always some intermediary that carries the observation to you.   When you optically observe something, photons bounce off of it and then come to your eye.  Those photons are what interacted with the object and you can only believe that the object exists to the extent that you believe those photons are giving you the correct information.  Obviously, this seems like a safe assumption, but I bring it up because it is the exact same issue for the other experiments.  You only believe in the existence of electrons to the extent that you believe the operation of the electron/gas experiment or to the extent that you believe the detection voltages in your quantum dot or SET.  But there is little reason not to believe those.  They may not be photons, but they are still capable of showing you that electrons do exist through direct observation.|`|lsUMe5WVaa	I wouldn't consider electrons to be a construct, mainly because the term electron refers to something that is considered to be physical (unlike constructs like 'holes', 'field lines' or even 'time'). We can't see them directly, but we can definitely feel their impacts on things, and we can even use them to 'illuminate' other objects.    The problem with referring to all directly unobservable things as constructs is that all things with dimensions close to (and smaller than) the wavelength of light would need to be considered constructs. Its just semantics really, but it would be odd if someone where to insist that the transistors that make up the processor in my computer are really just 'constructs'. Or that the accelerometers that deploy airbags in cars, being directly unobservable, may not actually exist!

vEEeq7kYaa	I've seen some water lillies bloom underwater, but was told that was something that indicated something wrong with the lilly.  I don't know.  so I did a little google and found this interesting article  http://www.scienceblog.com/community/old...    I'm wondering what and how they were "pollenated"?      And I still don't know of any others, but I have heard of algae blooms. Bloom means to produce flowers, but I think in the instance of algae blooms..doesn't it mean an overproduction?    now you've got me thinking and wondering about things and that can be a dangerous thing!   :P    EDIT: Ok, I've been away googling for you..and I discovered a plant that sometimes blooms underwater    Anubias    72-82F (22-28C). Not really a rosette plant, Anubias all have a creeping rhizome that grows very slowly, throwing out new leaves as it grows. The plant is built like a tank, some having reported keeping them in a closet for six months in a plastic bag yet still surviving. It is also one of the most expensive aquarium plants. If grown emersed, they may produce larger leaves, and will grow faster, and flowers will produce seeds. Anubias will frequently flower underwater, but not seed. You can grow the roots in gravel, or even train the rhizome to grow on bogwood like Java fern does. (TAG 6:2) Most commonly kept species is A. barteri var. nana, the smallest Anubias, which has egg-shaped leaves and makes a great foreground plant in medium-to-large aquariums. A. barteri var. barteri looks similar to the nana variety, but with bigger leaves. A. congensis, A. lanceolata and others grow very tall and make good background plants. They can sometimes be seen in better stores.   Submersed plants grow entirely or almost entirely underwater. Some submersed species produce flowers and are pollinated underwater or at the water surface (tapegrass, above). Some submersed species have branches and leaves that reach and spread across the water just below the surface (sago pondweed). Some produce flowers that float on the surface (fanwort). Some have flower stalks that emerge up to six inches above the water (water milfoils). Some are free-floating plants that live underwater (bladderwort). And some have several of these attributes, such as coontail, which is a submersed, free-floating plant that produces very tiny flowers that pollinate underwater (coontail).|`|ubln4QxEaa	there are some, i think|`|QE77Oxtqaa	No. Plants have flowers for insects like bees to pollinate.

There is the occasional odd case of a lily blooming under water, because it didn't grow enough, or the stem twisted, and there are always gardeners who trim the plants so that they go under water. But no species. Sorry. :-(|`|M1OJ3oFeaa	im pretty sure an orchid does

HyUE9ON0aa	I used to raise pigeons and mourning doves.<br>  <br>  They do not leave the nest till they are close to fully grown and ready to fly.<br>  <br>  In human terms that might sound like a very long time but it actually is only a few weeks. Their transformation is unbelievable and in just a few short weeks they look just like their parents maybe an inch shorter.<br>  <br>  @@@@@@@@@@<br>  <br>  <br>  Mourning dove with babies <br>  <br>  Eggs are incubated for 14 to 15 days. The female doves sits on the eggs at night and during part of the day.  The male dove stands guard at night, often some distance away.  During the day the male relieves the female so she can defecate, eat, and drink.  Toward the end of the 14 day incubation period, both parents often incubate the eggs together to provide additional heat and humidity. <br>  <br>  After hatching, the young are first fed "pigeon milk" from the lining of the parent's crop, and later they receive partially digested food  from the parents.  Somewhere between 11 and 14 or more days after the babies hatched out the parents will leave the nest.  <br>  <br>  Within a half day after the parents left, the chicks will become hungry and one by one they take their first flight to the ground, often far below.  The parents usually remain out of sight until the babies are on the ground then they will feed them. <br>  <br>  During the next few days the parents watch over the babies trying to protect them from predators as they improve their flying skills and learn to peck seeds on the ground..  The parents will also continue to feed them up to another 12 days after they left the nest.  During that time the parents may rehabilitate their old nest and lay another clutch.  Meanwhile the babies will stay nearby several more days unless frightened away. <br>  <br>  It takes a pair of mourning doves on an average of 33 days to raise a brood.  They will make 5 or 6 attempts and of those attempts they will have 3 to 4 successful broods.  From the 6 to 8 eggs that are laid they will raise 5 to 6 young birds.  Mourning doves do suffer a high mortality and studies have shown that between 50 and 70 percent will die within one year after hatching.  Some reports indicated that hunting mortality is insignificant and others indicate that hunting is responsible for taking the lives of 15 percent of the birds each year.|`|el8yX5q3aa	<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=picture+of+a+baby+pigeon" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mo...</a><br>  <br>  You can see one here!  :))|`|uPVnqbE8aa	I've seen them many times.<br>  Feral pigeons roost very high in the trees or buildings, and therefore most people don't every notice the nests or the chicks.<br>  Have you ever seen a baby Crow or Raven?

asaeVSehaa	You use the integral side of Gauss's Law.  So find E?dA on each face (it should be zero on some faces), integrate each side, add up the sides.  That will equal q/0.    For instance, on the top side, dA is in the +y direction, so E?dA will just be Ey times dA.  And dA will be dxdz.

People believe the Mayan calendar because they've predicted a lot of things that have happened.  The phrase that people analyze to translate to "the end of the world " also translates to a "new beginning."  So no, I do not think the world is going to end.

Hopefully, it will be a long time away.|`|d0MIgl38aa	it is not the end of the world, it is the end of an "AGE" then the calendar starts again.    however it also mark the point where our solar system crosses the gravity field of the super massive black hole at the center of our Galaxy (the Milky Way)   I could explain further but people don't read long answers.    wow I got thumbs down for being factualy correct. Look it up at the center of our galaxy is a super massive black hole that spins so fast its gravity goes out into a disc. (the reason galaxy's are shaped the way they are) think of the gravity field like it is a CD. over time our galaxy goes over and under the gravity field. When it does there is a chance nothing will happen, but there is also a chance that very bad things could happen. Mainly the shifting of the earth rotational axis... big trouble there    so take your thumbs ans spin on them. - I think it will mean big problems for the people of earth and I think certain people already know its coming and have prepared for it (Svalbard Global Seed Vault) or a modern version of Noah's Ark. but for plants.      THE MAYANS DID NOT PREDICT THE WORLD WOULD END YOU FOOLS, they said that it is the end of the GREAT CYCLE - the great cycle is from when our solar system leave the gravity field till the time it returns to the gravity field. - it so simple yet people make it so difficult    The great tribulation is the time it takes for our solar system to pass through the gravity field - a period of a few years|`|ee3mDKNDaa	sadly yes,     I didnt beleive this until I watched a video about it.    To me its really beleivable that some old mexican group of tacoeating   freaks called the mayans predicted the world would end on 2012 and that nostradamus and old freak got high of some gas and predicted 500 events and got 10 of em right.     grow up seriously    the people who tell u this r confused idiots looking to scare society    AS IF WE DONT HAVE ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT!|`|j8y0tWrdaa	Yes.

They develop technology that are so advance that they can use it to change the environment of space and its stars. Humans would be the king of the universe some according to my hypothesis.

And then look what happened. 9 years later, we're still here.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	The Mayan calendar stops functioning around this time.    The idea is that the Mayans had some sort of ancient wisdom and knew a working calendar would no longer be necessary after this date. They were right. The Spanish killed them all with centuries still left on the clock.    There are no computers using the Mayan calendar so there's not going to be a Y2.012K bug.

Which is the main reason people think the world will end.  It also is stated that we are overdue for our poles to switch, ie the north pole would become the south pole, south pole would be come the north pole.  Another 2012 argument is that on December 21st the sun is supposed to align with the center of our galaxy.       Don't put stock into these end of the world theories.  It will happen someday, but probably not in our lifetime.  Live life to the best of your ability and forget the rest.|`|FCEw1jP9aa	That was when the Mayans predicted the world would end.  It's not going to end, though.  There have been many different times that people thought the world was going to end.  None of those times have proven to be true.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

So, you can take out a 16 and make it into 16(x^2 - 1). Then, factor x^2 - 1 and you're done.     2 is similar to  1. The "2" "-24" and "40" all share a factor of 2. Also, they all have at least x^2. So, you can pull out "2x^2" from each part and be left with: 2x^2(x^2 -12x + 20). Then, factor the part inside the parentheses.    For  3, it's important to know that 3 x 3 x 3 = 27. Good luck!

For starters, a 12volt device may not run at all on 8volts. Based on 12volts and 12 watts,  the device must draw 1 amp of current. If the device will not "run" on 8 volts at all, it will not draw current. In this case, the power is zero. To match the same 12 watts with 8 volt supply, you would need the device to draw 1.5 amps (8 x 1.5 = 12)|`|yxnUBSJqaa	If the device requires 12W when it is connected to a 12V battery then it will also require 12W when connected to the 8V battery.    The current will change.    Current = Power / Voltage    With the 12V battery you have 1 amp at 12W and with the 8V battery you have 1.5 amps at 12W.  The wire you use should support the full range of currents.

The boat exerts a force down on the table. The table must in return exert an equal force back on the boat to support it, or the boat falls through the table.   Now let's put the boat in a pond. The bottom of the boat forces water aside to make space for itself. Water will in return exert a force trying to fill the gap thus pushing the boat up. The boat floats.   You can now see why some shapes float better than others. The shapes that push more water aside for themselves will float best.(They have a bigger displacement).   Also of course the average density of the object must be less than that of water. So any object must displace more water by weight than the object itself weighs. So a ten ton metal boat will float if the bottom of it displaces more than 10 tons of water.|`|ArjjZ35naa	things float only if the water they push out of the way weighs less than the object itself|`|qQo3TIfjaa	Arcimedes Principle:    When a body is partially of fully submerged in a fluid it experiences an upthrust equal in magnitude to the weight of the fluid displaced.

The reason is that winds are blowing in different directions in different layers of the atmosphere depending upon the pressure gradient(difference in atmospheric pressure) prevailing at the particular level.Clouds which form in different heights are carried away by these winds in different directions depending upon the wind direction at the respective levels.That is why the clouds at different layers move in different directions.Winds blowing at the ground level may have a completely different direction.So,clouds need not move in the same direction as that of the ground wind.|`|mm1kfE7Qaa	SW is not the Opposite of SSE.

They rely on vaporizing mercury and mercury doesn't vaporize well at cold temperatures.|`|oXPDFw4daa	Fluorescent lamps have difficulty starting in cold temperatures.  To start a lamp, it is necessary to vaporize a small amount of mercury (or mercury amalgam), and this is harder to do when the temperature is colder.    That's one of the 'issues' that those who are promoting mandates to abandon incandescent lamps in favor of compact fluorescents have not been able to satisfactorily answer.  There are some lamps (especially those that are totally enclose in a glass envelope) that start more easily than others, but the ubiquitous spiral will have a problem.    That doesn't mean that fluorescents don't work - what it means is that they start reluctantly.  All fluorescents have a warm-up characteristic - it typically takes upwards of 5 minutes for a lamp to reach full light output (although they will be practically at max output in a minute or less).  But in cold weather, this warmup is far more pronounced and takes longer.  If the application is one that has a naturally long 'on time' (such as an outdoor security light that is routinely on for hours), this is not a big problem.  But it is a problem if the application is one where you need good illumination immediately.    That said, I installed a spiral CFL in my garage (where the temperature in the winter routinely goes well below freezing), and I have CFLs in a lamp post in the front yard.  The work just fine - just take a long time to warm up.

Cc2Yb9DKaa	The simple answer is because they are renewable.  People will eventually deplete current sources of energy.  Growing populations and increased industrialization complicates the problem of depletion of non-renewable sources of energy.  The logical response is to develop renewable forms of energy to replace the diminishing non-renewable forms.  As non-renewal energy supplies dwindle, the cost of these sources grows.  Renewable energy provides a way to create a steady supply that offers an opportunity for replenishment and cost stabilization.

Have it react in a container with a bottling-top (such as a 20oz coke bottle, glass of course not plastic) and make sure to wait a good while so that the hydrogen pushes out most/all of the oxygen. Then, light from the top of the bottle. This will burn the hydrogen slowly, in a candle-like manner, as more hydrogen is produced from the bottom of the bottle, and it is burned and pulled out at the top.

At the equater you get about 1600 W / m^2 for sunlight. I don't know where you are on the globe, so lets just call it 1000 W / m^2, which is probably optimistic.    However, the best solar panels are only about 20% efficient currently. With a cheap calculator solar panel, you'd be lucky to get 10%, which would come to 100 W / m^2.    But your calculators solar panel is not a metre squared, it's probably more like 2 cm^2, since there are 100x100 = 10000 cm^2 in 1 m^2, the cell is around 1/5000 of a metre squared.    Which means you're looking at 1/50 of a watt, 0.02 W, and that's being optimistic. Calculators do not need a lot of power, remote control cars do. There is no way you can run an RC car on one of these things.

Many people often ask what can be expected in the way of salary for zoo keepers. This is a difficult question to answer as there are many factors affecting this. Salaries will vary greatly depending on some of the following factors: size of zoo, whether it is municipally or privately owned, its geographic location, and whether the staff is union or non-union. Entry-level keeper position wages may range from a low of $6.00 per hour to an upper range of $10.00 per hour. Most full-time zoo keeper positions offer benefit packages, but these may vary greatly also, some will provide full benefits (health and life insurance, retirement, sick leave, vacation time) while others may offer only limited benefit packages. Since beginning wages are not high (considering the amount of education and training many zoos require in an employee), you should look carefully at the benefits package when making a career choice.    1993 SURVEY    In a survey conducted in January 1993 among the 2600 members of AAZK, Inc., the following was a breakdown in annual income levels for zoo keepers (based on 5% survey response):    $10,000/LESS 0%  $10,000/15,000 4%  $15,000/20,000 42%  $20,000/25,000 40%  $25,000/30,000 7%  $30,000/35,000 7%    http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=...  http://www.indeed.com/salary/Zoo-Keeper....      *what special skills, talents, or personality traits are necessar|`|SvmZlLdaaa	The most important thing for becoming a zookeeper is to gain experience with animals. Most zoos are more interested in this than in qualifications - I used to be a zookeeper and got the job without any qualifications other than G.C.S.E.s. Having higher qualifications is no guarantee of getting the job (my boss told me he's had people come in with degrees who didn't know which end an elephant craps out of!), and not having them is no guarantee you won't get the job. Volunteering at a zoo or animal sanctuary is a good way of getting experience - many zoos take on volunteers, and it's a good way of getting your foot in the door, so to speak, at the particular zoo you're interested in working at. You won't get paid, though, of course. Other things that are considered good experience with animals are working on farms and in dog kennels.    You also need to be able to work hard, not mind getting dirty (and I mean REALLY dirty!), and deal with people, in the shape of the public - this often requires a good deal of patience, as you will be asked the same question literally hundreds of times every day, and must always be polite however rude people are to you and however busy, tired and frustrated you are. Depending on which animals you're looking after, some degree of public speaking may also be involved - you might have to do a talk whilst feeding your animals, for example.    A zookeeper's pay is generally quite poor - I earned minimum wage, which at the time was about 10,000 per year (roughly 20,000 US dollars). You cannot afford to buy or rent a place of your own on this sort of salary - you have to share with house-mates or a partner. Many people want to work with animals, so they don't need to tempt workers with high pay. The hours are long and you may not be paid for any overtime worked - in the zoo I worked at, you were paid only between 8am and 5pm, even if you arrived at 6.30am and didn't leave til 7pm. You are also required to work weekends and public holidays without additional pay, and the most time off you'll ever have is 2 days at a time. Animals need feeding and their enclosures cleaning every day, whether it's Christmas, your birthday, a bank holiday or whatever. It is definitely not a job you do for the money, or if you like taking long holidays or socialising at weekends and so on.    I must add that TV. shows about zoos paint a very unrealistic picture of what the job of being a zookeeper entails, making it appear that things like hand-rearing baby animals and knocking animals out for medical procedures happen every day. In reality, these things happen only rarely. The work is physically very hard, and you must work outdoors in all seasons and weathers. There is often little interaction with the animals you care for - the majority of the job is cleaning (picking up faeces, sweeping up straw, window cleaning, etc.). You also often do not have a choice as to which animals you work with - most zoos will simply take you on as a keeper and place you where you are needed, though you can request to work with certain animals if and when a position with them becomes available.

Air is composed of many small molecules that push against eachother. In some places, such as inside a truck tire, they are pushed close together. The molecules push against their container and eachother and we call this force pressure.    On Earth the strength of this force is always around 14.7 pounds per square inch. However, in some places it is slightly higher or lower because of the uneven heating of Earth's surface.    Heat is a measure of how fast molecules are shaking and bouncing into eachother. If a truck tire gets too hot it will explode because of the force of the heated molecules banging into the sides, and if you place a filled balloon in a freezer it will shrink.    Areas of low pressure are caused by lack of heat. Clouds block heat, so low pressure areas follow storm systems. Low pressure means a storm is probably on it's way. High pressure is caused by high heat, and so it signals good weather. Air moving from high pressure areas to low pressure areas often pushes storms along with it.    You measure pressure with a device called a barometer. Because of the way pressure and storms interact barometers are valuable meterological tools.

pXW69Naqaa	Of course its JUPITER if the following information is true and i hope they are...<br>  The most massive planet in our solar system, with four planet-size moons and many smaller satellites, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system. Jupiter resembles a star in composition. In fact, if it had been about eighty times more massive, it would have become a star rather than a planet.<br>  <br>  On January 7, 1610, using his primitive telescope, astronomer Galileo Galilei saw four small "stars" near Jupiter. He had discovered Jupiter's four largest moons, now called Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Collectively, these four moons are known today as the Galilean satellites.<br>  <br>  Galileo would be astonished at what we have learned about Jupiter and its moons in the last 30 years. Io is the most volcanically active body in our solar system. Ganymede is the largest planetary moon and is the only moon in the solar system known to have its own magnetic field. A liquid ocean may lie beneath the frozen crust of Europa. Icy oceans may also lie deep beneath the crusts of Callisto and Ganymede. In 2003 alone, astronomers discovered 23 new moons orbiting the giant planet, giving Jupiter a total moon count of 49, the most in the solar system. The numerous small outer moons may be asteroids captured by the giant planet's gravity.<br>  <br>  Jupiter's appearance is a tapestry of beautiful colors and atmospheric features. Most visible clouds are composed of ammonia. Water exists deep below and can sometimes be seen through clear spots in the clouds. The planet's "stripes" are dark belts and light zones created by strong east-west winds in Jupiter's upper atmosphere. Within these belts and zones are storm systems that have raged for years. The Great Red Spot, a giant spinning storm, has been observed for more than 300 years.<br>  <br>  Atmosphere<br>  <br>  The composition of Jupiter's atmosphere is similar to that of the sun—mostly hydrogen and helium. Deep in the atmosphere, the pressure and temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid. At depths about a third of the way down, the hydrogen becomes metallic and electrically conducting. In this metallic layer, Jupiter's powerful magnetic field is generated by electrical currents driven by Jupiter's fast rotation. At the center, the immense pressure may support a solid core of ice-rock about the size of Earth.<br>  <br>  Jupiter's enormous magnetic field is nearly 20,000 times as powerful as Earth's. Trapped within Jupiter's magnetosphere (the area in which magnetic field lines encircle the planet from pole to pole) are swarms of charged particles. Jupiter's rings and moons are embedded in an intense radiation belt of electrons and ions trapped in the magnetic field. The Jovian magnetosphere, composed of these particles and fields, balloons 600,000 to 2 million miles (1 million to 3 million kilometers) toward the sun and tapers into a windsock-shaped tail extending more than 600 million miles (1 billion kilometers) behind Jupiter, as far as Saturn's orbit.<br>  <br>  Discovered in 1979 by NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft, Jupiter's rings were a surprise: a flattened main ring and an inner cloudlike ring, called the halo, are both composed of small, dark particles. A third ring, known as the gossamer ring because of its transparency, is actually three rings of microscopic debris from three small moons: Amalthea, Thebe, and Adrastea. Jupiter's ring system may be formed by dust kicked up as interplanetary meteoroids smash into the giant planet's four small inner moons. The main ring probably comes from the moon Metis. Jupiter's rings are only visible when backlit by the sun.<br>  <br>  In December 1995, NASA's Galileo spacecraft dropped a probe into Jupiter's atmosphere, which collected the first direct measurements of the atmosphere. Following the release of the probe, the Galileo spacecraft began a multiyear study of Jupiter and its largest moons. As Galileo began its 29th orbit, the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft was nearing Jupiter for a gravity-assist maneuver on the way to Saturn. The two spacecraft made simultaneous observations of the magnetosphere, solar wind, rings, and Jupiter's auroras.|`|e0227973f38e13ea78ebdb8fcda760efaa	Jupiter|`|WVPYem5Vaa	Jupiter.

ossCVxPqaa	You have to be very careful in your choice of antacid pill. Many of these are based on carbonates or bicarbonates. If you use such an antacid tablet, you will not produce less CO2, possibly even more, due to the reaction of the carbonate in the tablet reacting with the vinegar to produce CO2.<br>   You can do this in two ways:<br>  1) use an antacid that does not contain a carbonate or bicaronate Some antacids are based on Al(OH)2 which will not react with the acid<br>  <br>  2) Add the antacid, even one containing a carbonate, to the vinegar before adding to the test baking soda. The tablet would have neutralised the acid externally, leaving very little to react with the test baking soda.<br>  <br>  3) you will get no results if you grind up the antacid tablet and mix it with the baking soda before adding the acid. In brief, the antacid tablet is probably made from baking soda.|`|0W6caoLeaa	You will want to capture the CO2 to show that the volume of CO2 produced will go down.<br>  <br>  Here is how you do it:<br>  <br>  Place X grams of soda in a balloon.

DNpgwie2aa	Time dilation.  Time is not a constant..  It is relative as perceived by the observer.. This is best known in our satellites and gps systems..  The clocks on the satellites have to run at a different rate to be in sync with the clocks on the ground.   In space travel.  The faster you travel the slower time will be.  The traveler will not notice the slower time but an outside observer (not traveling at the same speed) will see time slow for the traveler.   It is figured that it might be possible to travel to another star system in a handful of years (for the traveler) if we could go near the speed of light but when you return, thousands of years might have passed on earth.  Its something you really need to think about a lot to get it.|`|SYZQZGesaa	The discovery channel did a piece on this a few years ago. Try researching speed of light on their site.

KJHw0oI3aa	To find the concentration of the chloride ions in the final solution, we need to calculate the number of moles of chloride ions in HCl solution and in NaCl solution separately.  Then we need to add them together to find the total number of moles of the chloride ions, and divide them by the combined volume (in liters) of both solutions.    Since NaCl(s) dissociates in water solution according to the equation:    NaCl(s) --> Na+(aq) + Cl-(aq)  ,    the concentration of "Cl-(aq)" will be the same as the concentration of NaCl in the solution because their coefficients are the same in the equation.  In other words, for every mole of NaCl(s) that dissolves, one mole of "Na+(aq)" and one mole of "Cl-(aq)" form.      Similarly, HCl is a monoprotic acid that ionizes completly in water solution according to the equation:    HCl(g) --> H+(aq) + Cl-(aq)    For every mole of HCl(g) that dissolves in water, one mole of chloride ions is formed.  The molarity of "Cl-(aq)" is the same as the molarity of the acid.    molarity = moles of solute / liters of solution  moles of solute = molarity x liters of solution    moles of Cl-(aq) from HCl = (1 M)(0.1 L) = 0.1 mol    moles of Cl-(aq) from NaCl = (5 M)(0.1 L) = 0.5 mol    0.1 mol + 0.5 mol = 0.6 mol of Cl-(aq) in the final solution    Total volume of both solutions is     100 mL + 100 mL = 200 mL = 0.2 L    molarity Cl-(aq) in final solution = 0.6 mol / 0.2 L = 3 M

2k4hWLYwaa	For one, your string could have been lengthening as weight was added by stretching.  That would change its length and cause the period to change.  Another thing is that perhaps you weren't controlling the angle with which it was released.  The equation for pendulum motion holds only if the angle that it is swinging remains small.  Once it starts to get up near 10 degrees of angle, the equation loses its validity.  Whatever your pendulum was swinging from would have to be pretty solid and not moving at all.  If it is flexing, that will affect the results.  Lastly, there is just a lot of variation with physics experiments in general and this one in particular.  There are so many other forces and factors involved that nudge the results one way or the other that getting the expected results repeatedly and accurately isn't likely.  Usually, for physics, if the results are within 20% of error, you're in the ballpark.  10% error is pretty good, usually.|`|o5NNAxMWaa	In theory, the center of mass is where the acceleration of the bob is measured from, which determines it's period.  Every time you added another washer to the string, you were thickening the stack of washers and changing the location of the center of mass.

ifwgd5dMaa	Hmm.. Other people have answered with inter- and intra- species answers, so let me just tell you what pops into my (zoo-employee) head.    Bonobos!  Bonobos are arguably among the most sexual of animals.  They are also known as pygmy chimps, but are really about the same size.  They use genital to genital rubbing like we use a handshake, and will interact with any combination of sexual partners: male-male, female-female, female-male, group.  They are the only other animals that I know of who will engage in manual or oral stimulation of other individuals (besides humans).  Tension after a fight about social or food-related things is often released in a short (60 second) bout of sex.    These great apes have not been studied as much as the more well-known common chimps or western lowland gorillas, but offer fascinating insights into the family tree of human sexuality.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	I'm sorry that I never got around to you at the last orgy.

QED|`|1iEtYKXmaa	This follows from the two facts:  (1) 3 is a prime number and (2) all integers have unique prime factorizations. So if the prime factors of x are a,b,c,... and those of y are p,q,r,... then the product     (a b c ...)(p q r ...) can be divided by 3 if and only if at least one of the prime factors is equal to 3. Suppose that factor is c; then 3 divides x. If no factor of x has a 3, then there must be one in the factors of y. Of course, there may be multiple 3's in the list of factors of x, y, or both.     Notice that a similar statement does NOT apply if the number in question is composite. For example, if x=4 and y=9, then 6 divides the product of x and y but does not divide either x or y.    Also notice that the statement can be extended to any number of factors. Thus, if 3 divides xyz, then if must divide at least one of x, y, z. And so on for any number of factors.

SvmZlLdaaa	First of all, I would like to point out that white tigers are not a different species or subspecies - they are just Bengal tigers with a genetic condition called leucism, which results in reduced pigmentation. This is not the same as albinism, which is a complete lack of pigment - an albino tiger would have no stripes, and pink eyes, not blue.    White tigers can and do occur in the wild, but are rare for two reasons. First, leucism is caused by recessive genes, meaning that two individuals carrying the gene must mate, and both must pass on the gene to the offspring in order for that offspring to be leucistic (if only one parent passes on the leucistic gene, the offspring will be normally coloured, since the gene for normal colour is dominant over the leucistic gene. If two white tigers mate, the offspring will defintely be white, since the parents have only leucistic genes to pass on). Second, being white is something of a disadvantage for a tiger. It lacks the natural camouflage of normally coloured individuals, and most of those born will be killed by predators whilst young and vulnerable, since they stand out. Those that do survive to adulthood will have a hard time hunting for the same reason - it will be easier for their prey to see them coming.    A male tiger knows when a female is in heat from her scent - she releases certain pheromones that inform him of her condition. You will often see male cats checking if females are in heat using the 'flehmen' reaction - a grimace in which the male pulls back his lips, baring his teeth, and sticks out his tongue. This draws scent over the Jacobson's organ in the roof of the mouth, which produces a sense somewhere between smell and taste and is especially useful in analysing pheromones. The female also 'flirts' with the male, rubbing up against him, flicking her tail across his face, and rolling on the ground in front of him. They will mate every fifteen to twenty minutes for at least three days. The penis of all male cats is covered in backward-facing barbs which cause pain to the female when withdrawn - this is thought to help stimulate ovulation in the female, as cats are induced ovulators (this means that their bodies require the stimulus of mating before they release eggs). It's also the reason that female cats often turn on their mates, snarling and clawing, when they dismount.    Tigers as a species are endangered due to humans - threats to the species include habitat destruction, depletion of their prey species, and hunting for various reasons (e.g. out of fear of them killing people or livestock, for their skins, and for their body-parts for use in traditional Chinese medicine). Since white tigers are naturally rarer than normally coloured ones, the more endangered tigers become the less chance there is of any leucistic individuals occurring and surviving.    However, white tigers are common in captivity as they are a draw for zoos and wildlife parks. Unfortunately, this has led to some unscrupulous breeding in the past, and many captive individuals are now inbred and suffer the detrimental effects.|`|0D4q4Q2Raa	The male white tiger sticks his penis in the female white tiger's vagina. That's how they reproduce. If you actually have to do a report on this, then you should already know that.|`|VAsHqPNJaa	First they reproduce the same as any other mammal on earth. They are albino so they could mate with the orange tigers and the baby tiger will have a 50 percent chance of being white (the recessive allele on the orange tiger could be the albino gene which would make the tiger white).

o5NNAxMWaa	The i component is the ball's horizontal velocity component.  The j component of the ball is it's vertical component.  The vectors are added to determine the ball's velocity in two directions, essentially.    At it's highest point, the ball would be neither rising or falling, so the j component would be zero.    Since the j component is negative, the ball is falling. Thus, the ball has passed it's highest point and is on the way down.|`|QkFnEIWSaa	At the highest point, the velocity in the y direction would be zero since that is when it starts coming back down again.

I'll break the 1st problem into sections.    1) 18    (18 factors into 2 no's.) 9 x 2.  Since the square root of  9 is 3, the 3 can be removed from the radical which leaves  the 2 inside which cannot be simplified.   ..................... 18 =  (9 x 2) = 32    That's only the 1st part of the problem, so let's look at the 2nd part.    ........+275 = 2 (25 x 5) = 2 x 5  5 = 10 5  I did the same thing as the 1st partof the prob..the only difference  was I had an extra step when I took the 5 from under the radical  sign.  It had to be multiplied by the 2 which was already out there.    3rd part:  ........-48 = - (16 x 3) = -4 3   this was just like the 1st part except we've got a neg. sign out front.    The complete answer to No. 1 problem then is:  .................32 + 105 - 43    I see that some of the other problems have terms with powers of 3.  Like actual numbers, those can be factored too.  For example  y^3 can be factored as (y^2)(y) where the y^2 term is a perfect   square and a y can be removed from the radical leaving the   remaining y under the radical sign as y y.      If there is a number under the rad. sign that cannot be factored  such as the 1st term in  5, just leave as is.    I hope you can get these.   Remember always look for terms that   can be factored into at least one term that is a perfect square  and can be removed from the radical.

z7BiMSWmaa	CAM Plants  These are also C4 plants but instead of segregating the C4 and C3 pathways in different parts of the leaf, they separate them in time instead. (CAM stands for crassulacean acid metabolism because it was first studied in members of the plant family Crassulaceae.)   At night,     CAM plants take in CO2 through their open stomata (they tend to have reduced numbers of them).   The CO2 joins with PEP to form the 4-carbon oxaloacetic acid.   This is converted to 4-carbon malic acid that accumulates during the night in the central vacuole of the cells.  In the morning,   the stomata close (thus conserving moisture as well as reducing the inward diffusion of oxygen).   The accumulated malic acid leaves the vacuole and is broken down to release CO2.   The CO2 is taken up into the Calvin (C3) cycle.      Other C4 plants have structural changes in their leaf anatomy so that   their C4 and C3 pathways are separated in different parts of the leaf with   RUBISCO sequestered where the CO2 level is high; the O2 level low.

In order to make a mixed number into an improper fraction you take the whole number and multiply it by the denominator then you add the numerator  whatever the answer is, make sure you use it the numerator but keep the denominator the same (in this case the denominator would stay 4)   2 x 4 +3= 11  2 3/4 = 11/4    now your problem is...  11/4 + 1 + 1/2    Every whole number can be changed into a fraction by adding a /1 (which makes it easier to work with).  so you want to change you whole number 1 into a fraction which will then look like this...  1 = 1/1    now your problem is...  11/4 + 1/1 + 1/2 =     In order to solve the problem now you must find a common denominator between all three fractions (4, 1, and 2). In this case the common denominator is "4" because "4" is a multiple of all three numbers.     In order to figure out the numerator, you must multiply the each numerator the same amount of times it took for you to get 4 as the denominator.  In this case, each fraction should now look like this...  11/4 = 11/4 (multiply by 1)  1/1 = 4/4 (multiply by 4)  1/2 = 2/4 (multiply by 2)    now your problem is...  11/4 + 4/4 + 2/4 =    Once you've done this, you add each numerator together. Don't forget to put it over you denominator.    your numorator is...  11 + 4 + 2 = 16    combinding the numerator and denominator would make it...  17/4 (improper fraction)                    or  if you are instructed to simplify your answer is would then be...  4 1/4 (mixed number)      Hope this wasn't too confusing and hope i helped you out|`|cXbQAQk2aa	Find a common denominator first which is 4 so  2 3/4 = 11/4  1 = 4/4  1/2 = 2/4,  then add the numerators    17/4 or 4 1/4|`|c3988adee76bb2df1e09bf7fdb3893bbaa	2 3/4 +1+ 1/2  = 11/4 +4/4 +2/4  = 17/4  = 4 1/4|`|PxOKD3Dqaa	common denominator it  11/4+4/4+2/4=  17/4=  4 1/4|`|VAsHqPNJaa	Convert the entire thing into having common denominators    First  2 3/4 is 11/4  1 is 4/4  1/2 is 2/4    add the top numbers    17/4  (Mixed number: 4 1/4)|`|1LqqDwIvaa	With fractions, put them into the same denominator to add them up.  2 3/4 is 11/4        1 is  4/4     1/2 is  2/4     11+ 4 + 2 = 17        So you have 17/4 or (4 1/4)
SEA8CAHnaa	An ISOTOPE is an atom of an element with a different number of neutrons than the original element. For example, carbon has an atomic number of 6- meaning it has 6 protons. Carbon's mass is approximately 12 atomic mass units (amu), which tells you a normal carbon atom has six neutrons. (Because mass minus atomic number equals number of neutrons).  So, a carbon isotope has the same number of protons (proton number never changes, if it changes, you're dealing with an entirely different element) and the same number of electrons, but a different number of neutrons. The most common carbon isotope is "carbon thirteen," thus titled due to it's mass being 13 amu's, which means it has 6 protons and 7 neutrons.    RADIOISOTOPES, however, are unstable by nature due to several things going on in the nucleus. They are isotopes by definition, but they have unusually high levels of unstable energy in the nucleus and thus emit this energy in the form of radiation.  They may undergo various types of radioactive decay (alpha, beta or gamma) or they may emit ionizing radiation, all in an effort to expel energy and become more stable.    By definition, "radioisotopes" are inherently unstable, whereas "isotopes" may be either stable or unstable... but usually refer to stable isotopes.    I hope this helps!|`|KJHw0oI3aa	The word "isotope" refers to an atom of any particular element that has the same atomic number as the other atoms of this element, but it has its own number of neutrons.  Practically every element on the periodic table has several iosotopes.  However, only some of these iosotopes may be unstable (radioactive).  Such isotopes are called "radioisotopes".    For example, potassium (K) has more isotopes than I can count, most of them unstable radioisotopes.  (See the source given.)  K-39 is stable, and so is K-41.  They both share the same atomic number (19), but their masses (39 and 41) are different due to different number of neutrons.  A couple of potassium's radioisotopes are K-43 whose half-life is one hour, and K-48 whose half-life is two seconds.  In case you don't remember, a half life is the time needed for half of the atoms of a radioisotope to change into atoms of another element.  Potassium radioisotopes are beta-emitters, so they decay to become atoms of calcium (Ca-43, and Ca-48).|`|MzqedfDeaa	A radioisotope is a version of a chemical element that has an unstable nucleus and emits radiation during its decay to a stable form. Radioisotopes have important uses in medical diagnosis, treatment, and research. A radioisotope is so-named because it is a radioactive isotope, an isotope being an alternate version of a chemical element that has a different atomic mass.    Some common elements are Oxygen, Aluminium, Silicon and Iodine.|`|b5a45b01671a5f0a34327589c9c53c10aa	isn't a radioisotope just one that is radioactive and can be used as a label to find other things? Isotopes are simply elements with a different atomic weight. Like deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen
xWFQLKfIaa	D is the correct answer and the reason why is because instantaneous velocity at a point is given by the slope of the line tangent to the point.|`|Ob9AZnA4aa	It's A because instantaneous velocity would be the velocity at a certain point. That would be working with derivatives... It's A because you find the distance something has traveled by taking the position (usually in meters) divided by the time (usually in seconds). Therefore, the graph would display something proportional to the distance traveled.|`|1jToUfoOaa	D velocity|`|CO7qRjJvaa	tjhe D ans is correct. slope = rise / run, which is dist / time = speed. the guy who gave a long answer why A is correct gave a long answer why he doesn't understand.
eY0MhGfmaa	Ideally, the force exerted by the pitcher is identical to that exerted by the catcher.    But there will be slight differences to account for energy dissipated in friction with air, and the resultant deceleration of the ball, acceleration due to gravity, etc.|`|lsUMe5WVaa	The catcher.    The pitcher accelerates the ball for a much longer period of time (i.e. the length of time it takes to throw the ball). Which requires a much lower force (over a longer period of time) to get the ball up to speed.    Whereas the catcher stops (decelerates) the ball very quickly (and F=ma, and 'a' here is larger in magnitude than for the pitcher).    EDIT: I should probably point out that I'm assuming that there is little air resistance. Gravity doesn't really matter, but it would actually give the ball more velocity by the time it gets to the catcher (meaning an even larger force from the catcher), so it doesn't change my answer.|`|ytNlz3b7aa	The pitcher. Air resistance and gravity reduce the force applied by the pitcher slightly before it reaches the catcher.|`|PxOKD3Dqaa	catcher  Force=mass*acceleration  same mass so its all on the acceleration  and catchers deccelerates the ball faster

ThYN1mFFaa	At 25 degrees C, water has a density of 1 gm/ml.  123.1g/82 ml = a density of 1.5 gm/ml.    So, mass of water is 82 gms, and density of solution is 1.5 gm/ml.  The mass of water alone is 82 gm and the density of the water alone is 1.0 gm/ml.  The question is a bit misleading.
AA11915874	both the other two answerers are correct.    as you heat water, dissolved gases, O2, N2, CO2, etc, become less soluble and bubble out.  these are the bubbles you see PRIOR to boiling.    as the water boils, H2O changes from liquid to vapor phases and bubbles of gaseous H2O form.|`|gjxUwmtWaa	The temperature is increased making water turn into the gaseous state within the liquid itself - hence the bubbles.

The Product Rule    f(x) = (sinx)^2 = (sinx)(sinx)    u = sinx  du/dx = cosx  v = sinx  dv/du = cosx    f'(x) = v(du/dx) + u(dv/dx) = sinxcosx + sinxcosx = 2sinxcosx    So you're right!
