YCeendraaa	if your pc and your xbox are on the same network when you power up your xbox a little bubble should pop up on your computer's desktop say Windows media extender found then click it and it will ask your for a code from the extender. then go to your xbox and open the windows media centre section and follow the steps. it will end up giving you a code and you can go on from there. i've done it it's quite simple. hope this helps. email me if u have any problems.

6000349dbd0a8f8b344256f6899b5461aa	Hello. I've owned my Kindle for over a year now, and I'm still crazy about it.    My pros & cons:    Pros:  1. It's very light and slim.  2. The screen doesn't strain your eyes like a computer monitor would. It reads like a regular paperback.  3. You can store as many books as you like. 200 on the internal memory and more depending on the capacity of the SD card you will insert. I used a 2GB SD.  4. No need to buy lots of books and carry it with you on your trip. I travel a lot so it's a wonderful device to have.  5. The Whispernet feature. You can buy books directly from your Kindle. Or sample a book. And it's wirelessly delivered to your device and free.  6. I can use it anywhere in the world, I just bring my USB cable and download the books I buy to the Kindle.  7. It has bookmarks, notes, highlights, etc.  8. There's a built-in dictionary and you can have access to Wikipedia.  9. The books are cheaper than the paperback and hardback.  10. There's hundreds of free books, especially classics.  11. Adjustable text size.  12. Kindle support rocks! They'll answer every question you have and they'll replace your Kindle if there's a defect.    Cons:  1. It makes me spend a lot on books ; )  2. It's easy to hit the next button by mistake. You'll learn the best way to hold your Kindle though. You'll get used to it.  3. There's no built-in LED light for reading in the dark. I needed to buy the M-Edge light.  4. It's a bit expensive.    You can buy books at Amazon.com's Kindle bookstore.  http://www.amazon.com/Books-Kindle/b/ref...    Also, you might want to check out the Kindle boards, they're very friendly and they'll answer whatever question you may have.    My sister has the Sony 700, I like it too but I prefer the Kindle.    Pros:   1. Touch screen is always cool.  2. No buttons on the edge that you might accidentally hit.  3. Like the feel of the left grip thing.   4. Has a built-in LED light for reading in the dark.  5. Light & thin.  6. Large internal memory plus SD slot.    Cons:  1. The books are more expensive than in Amazon.   2. The e-book selection of Sony is quite small compared to Amazon, who's really a seller of books.   3. My sis said that hers freeze up sometimes but can be remedied by resetting.  4. No Whispernet, you have to download books using a computer & USB.|`|AHuBqplbaa	They are actually very similar, using exactly the same display (only one company currently produces reader screens.)    The sony is a more solid machine overall, but the thing that sold me on the Sony is the smaller size - with the same sized screen as the Kindle, the unit itself is more compact and slips right into my coat pocket.    The biggest pro of the Kindle is nothing to do with the machine itself - it has to do with Amazon having a larger selection of ebooks.  I already found a free converter, however, so I can now read any kindle books on my sony anyway.|`|5Wie7d3caa	I like the Sony reader.  I have the PRS505 and I love it!  It's so convenient to use.  The only thing I had to get used to was not turning pages!

VMVW3E7Aaa	Start with the major camera manufacturers' websites, they all have "learning" or "school" sections.  I'm not fond of Olympus cameras, but their tutorials are great.    After that, just google - you'll find countless tutorials.    I prefer to get lots of different opinions from different sites, rather than being stuck with just one side of the story.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	www.all-things-photography.com...as it's writen here.
O7ufcgjGaa	Just the 8GB alone can hold up to 1,750 songs, and up to 10 hours of video! So unless your songs are in extremely high-quality or your movies are longer than 2 hrs each, the 8GB iPod Touch is more than capable enough to handle your needs.    But of course, a little extra space won't hurt either and you can do so much more with 16GB, twice the space. In my opinion, it really depends on your budget and how much are you willing to invest in buying your iPod Touch.|`|gbJ3Pewkaa	16b,... 8gb is very little believe me|`|AA12245212	i thing 8gb is sufficient but if u have money then go for 16gb.
c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	The battery seems to have died.  You can buy a replacement, but the cost may be fairly high. Hope the following will help.    In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches. Click links below for more details.  http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j... ...  http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h... ...     The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices. Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.    http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5... ...  http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po... ...     The batteries mentioned below are new formula NiMH batteries that will hold charge for one year when not used.  Also, 2000mAh batteries seem to have a longer life.  Did not like them at first, but have 12 of these batteries that are over five years old and are still as good as new.  Higher mAh batteries still work well in flashlights, but won't start my camera.     A friend asked me to clean and charge her new 2000mAh Duracell batteries as described in the last link.  Those batteries are still going strong after four months of casual use and haven't been recharged.     Click this link for complete instructions on cleaning camera and battery electrical contacts.   http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13...     Camera reports batteries low, but is it low charge or bad electrical contacts? Overcharging can ruin good batteries!  The secret to making digital cameras work better is having good electrical contacts between batteries and camera.      CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge.  To preserve battery charge, use the viewfinder.     NiMH batteries should be recharged when camera reports batteries low.  Old batteries can discharge over night, but may provide normal service immediately after being charged.  Battery pairs no longer usable in cameras may work well in flashlights.  Do not drop batteries on a hard surface or allow voltage below one volt to prevent polarity reversal.     CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged and don't delete. Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.     Never touch battery ends or camera electrical contacts.  Oil from fingers will contaminate contacts.  Use batteries in matched pairs of same brand and rating.  Do not mix old and new batteries.  New will only do as well as old.     Digital cameras reset to original settings if batteries are removed for one minute. Time varies with function/camera. Check display/setup menu for non-auto functions and date/time. Remove extra memory to eliminate this as a possible problem.  Insert fully charged/cleaned batteries and restart camera. The ultimate non-physical repair for software-using devices is reset by removing power ... VCR/DVD players one month.

The only thing that can really damage them is overheating (and your Olympus battery charger has circuitry that protects the battery against overheating) or leaving the battery in a discharged condition for any length of time (there is no time listed for this, but they tend to be very susceptible to this condition).      Olympus sells replacement batteries at authorized Olympus dealerships.  You will probably have to order it.

ssoZ33XIaa	With the subscription service, you can download an unlimited number of tracks and transfer them to your mp3 player without paying anything extra.  You can pay the $0.99 if you wish to purchase an individual track to keep, but you can download the tracks for free as part of your subscription package.  The thing about the subscription is that once you cancel the subscription all of the files you downloaded as part of it will expire and no longer work.
EfejPjIMaa	Everything everyone else has said will help.  The other thing is if you are playing a game, watching a movie, or using Folding@Home (Life with PlayStation), then all of these will slow down the download.     I try to download when I'm not using the PS3, as this increases download times significantly.  The more you make your PS3 work, the slower it is going to be.  Start your downloads before you go to bed and use the Auto Shut-Off feature (XMB far left, Turn PS3 off, Turn PS3 off after downloads are complete).  This should help speed up your download times, but it will still only go as fast as your internet will let it.|`|Li45o7ovaa	if your connection is wireless you could move the PS3 closer to your router but if the signal strength is at 100 percent or if you're on a wired connection then upgrading your internet is the only option|`|58K4Ft0uaa	plug an compatible Receiver into the PS3 which will boost it|`|HekFanRvaa	do wired connection during download then go back to wrieless afterwards.    that's what I do all the time.. i just have a long ethernet cable on stand by and ready whenever I need to switch on wired connection.

Eventually the lasers on them wear out (actually it's not the laser that wears out but the lens that focuses it that burns out). When that happens they usually stop playing PS2 games and DVDs first because those discs have more lines of data on them and are harder for the laser to focus on than CDs and PS1 games which have fewer lines.   It happened to my PS2 years ago and I bought a replacement laser assembly from eBay and fitted it myself which got it going again.  As mentioned above you should try clening the laser lens first though, the best way to do this is to open the PS2 and using a cotton bud (or Q-tip if you're American) and some CD cleaning fluid gently swab the lens. Allow to dry and reassemble.  Failing that the newer slimline PS2 is not very expensive to buy these days, or perhaps it's time for PS3?  Hope you get it sorted, good luck :)|`|GNullRFvaa	Hi, It is probably just that the laser needs cleaning. If you have a laser disc cleaner use that. Otherwise if you are happy to take the PS2 apart then you can clean it that way. Be careful and make sure you unplug everything 1st! You could also try blowing hard into the disc tray area. Another thing which worked for me until I got the laser cleaned was to stand the PS2 on its side and try loading a disc that way? If its not the laser then your possibly cheaper to just get another PS2??|`|9JUHT0blaa	Maybe it's broken. PS2's all seem to be gone these days. Im the only one I know who has a working PS2|`|9f8XoDKJaa	Assuming that the discs are clean and not scratched or the ps2 discs copies or ur ps2 has been modified then the DVD player is dead.    U can try a cd cleaner.  Chances are its not under warranty.  But i would check that first
KLL0Acrwaa	With the 18-105mm lens, you can turn a ring on the lens, and the view will get wider or get more "zoomed in" depending upon which direction you turn that ring.  This is what's known as a zoom lens.    With the 50mm, it's a fixed focal length lens, that is, the view stays the same.  If you want it wider, you have to step back.  If you want it bigger, you have to walk closer.    Next biggest difference:  the 18-105mm has VR or vibration reduction, which means you can hold the lens and be shaking slightly, but the lens will try to cancel out this movement to give you a sharper image.  The 50mm lens does not have VR.    However, the 50mm lens does have an f/1.8 lens opening or aperture.  If you set the camera to f/1.8 in dim light, it will let in more light than the 18-105mm lens which lets in less light.    The 18-105mm is an AF-S lens, which means it has a built-in lens motor and can be used with the D40, D40x, and D60.  The 50mm does not have a built-in motor and so, it must be manually focused with those cameras.    Overall, the 50mm is a sharp lens, and a great lens, but it can't zoom (you have to zoom with your feet), it must be manually focused with some cameras, and it doesn't have vibration reduction.  Depending upon what camera you want to use it on, it may or may not be a good choice.  By comparison, the 18-105mm will get you adequate to excellent results, zoom, focus quickly (due to the built-in motor) and will autofocus with any modern Nikon SLR.    So hopefully that explains the differences.|`|nU5UqACUaa	A 18-105 is an all-round lens for tourism and general photography.  A 50/1.4 or any similar like the Sigma 30/1.4 are prime lenses that offer one single frame view only and getting more or less on the shot is only possible by moving closer or further away from the subject.  The 1.4 / 1.7 / 2.8 apertures allow pictures in low light. A 1.4 will make a shot in low light where a 3.5 will be beyond it's limits. Wider apertures can also be taken for faster shooting speeds and for low DOF ranges.  Such lenses are often used for portrait works since they offer at wide open a very close focusing depth of field what is important in that kind of work. Shooting a face with front and rear out of focus has a special appeal and is the absolute must in portrait works.  One can do the same by shooting on distance with a tele lens. But with a close range wide open prime lens it's sometimes more funny.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	they're focal lengths. 'hard to explain in a few sentences. the first is a zoom and the second a prime or fixed focal length. the zoom goes from wideangle to short telephoto. and the 50mm is short telephoto. 50mm is optimum for portrature. you'll need to read a lot to get the fundimentals of photography. there's a ton of books. online tutorials. and photography classes around...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_lengt...|`|17EV9uuLaa	The 18-105 is a zoom macro to telephoto lens and the 50mm is a single set focal length with an f/of 1.8 (speed of the lens) AF is auto focus and 50mm is approximately life size imaging.|`|UiQ6V377aa	18-105mm refers to the zoom range of the lens.    A 50mm lens is not a zoom but stays at a constant 50mm lens. the f/1.8 refers to the lowest F-stop(aperture)    Which one you chooses depends on what kinds of subjects you are shooting.    Both these lenses are going to be very exspensive. So why don't you become a more of an expert at photography before you waste money on these lenses!
4Pk6VNftaa	Turn off the PS3, and connect it to your TV with the component cables.  Be sure remove the HDMI cable from the PS3.    Hold down the power button on the front of the PS3 for 10 seconds, until you hear a beep.  This will reset the PS3's video settings so that it will use the Multi-AV port where the component cables are connected.    You'll have to do this each time you want to switch from the HDMI cable to the component cables.    Yes, it's stupid that the PS3 can detect when you have the HDMI cable plugged in, but then can't detect when you DON'T have the HDMI cable plugged in.    As for internet, the easiest way to do this is plug your PS3 into the router.  This is a box that has ethernet plugs for your PCs and other devices on one side, and connects to your DSL or cable modem.  The router can provide your PS3 with the settings it needs to get online automatically.  Then just go to the Network are and click on Join PSN.  The onscreen instructions should walk you through the process.

b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	your xbox will find all media that is in your windows media player library.  so if you add the media from your new partition to your WMP library, then the XBOX should see it.|`|uesAHPidaa	try your ethernet cord|`|zh0X3mkyaa	I use a program called Tversity to stream to my 360.

b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	halo 2, halo.  Those were the games that made xbox live on the original XBOX|`|4Pk6VNftaa	The first Halo doesn't have online play, and I'm not sure if Microsoft is still running Live for the original Xbox, meaning, you may not be able to play any original Xbox games online at all anymore.
b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	i would have to think that most people have gone to 360 now, since its been out for over 3 years, is priced at $200, and the old XBOX was a POS.  But, to answer your question, there are still about 2000 people logged into halo 2 at any given moment.  Plus, you can play with all the people who are playing backwards-compatible games on their 360.|`|GpCAgL0Jaa	i do not know any body who even has an xbox. buy an xbox 360.they dont even sell the original xbox in pawn shops
becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	Yes, you can.
MGyzOIKqaa	i cna;t find it at the moment, but when you say contact sony on the website, there is a list of compatible ones|`|Li45o7ovaa	the older 20 60 and 80 gig models can but none of the newer ones can|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	Most people are clueless when it comes to backwards compatability questions.  They only think there is only one PS3--the one that they have, but just ignore  the people that say "yes, the 80GB plays PS2 games" or "No, the only one that   plays PS2 games is the 60GB. I don't blame the consumers, either. I think it is   Sony's fault for making so many PS3 models (20,60,80,40,80 again, 160) that it  can be confusing.    Anyways here's the answer you're looking for:    The only models that play PS2 games are:    20GB-Discontinued, all PS2 games $500  60GB-Discontinued, all PS2 games $600, later $550  Old 80GB-Discontinued, 80% of PS2 games $500    The following DO NOT:    40GB-Discontinued $400  New 80GB-in stores $400  160GB-in stores $500    All PS3's play PSone games.    An easy way to tell if a PS3 will play PS2 games    4USB ports=YES  2USB ports=NO    The reason is that the cost of putting the PS2 chip/CPU  and the PS2 graphics card in the PS3 was VERY expensive,  and as the PS2 only has about a year left (before it is  discontinued), Sony saw no reason to lose even more  money than they already are losing on the PS3, and  hence there is no backwards compatibility on PS3's today.|`|7gL9laqLaa	No|`|raEUval8aa	http://www.videogameall.com/ps3comp.html      Some can, you just have to find them.|`|xPy6ZePkaa	Yes they can play PS2 games. If your PS3 isn't compatible you can download a utility from the PS Store that will able you to play them.

becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	There are many digital channels, especially in the morning that "fake" an HD picture by inserting black bars. In thoas ecase, the aspect control does not usually work.    usually the aspect ratio is controlled either by using the TV's remote or the set-top box remote.    If you have a set-top box, make sure you specify you have a 16:9 TV and set the output to 720p or 1080i.|`|dqzoEw67aa	If you are using an HD cable box, go into it's settings and use 16:9, also be sure your tv is set to 16:9.  4:3 override would be for SD channels, but they don't have bars on the top and bottom, they have bars on the side.|`|qACzan5Faa	call teh company of your tv and ask them.

HBNx77BBaa	The 450D supports SDHC so I would have thought 16GB would be fine. I couldn't find confirmation of that anywhere so to be sure you would need to contact Canon.    Check that your camera firmware is the latest (v1.0.9). If it's not, you can download it from the Canon website.    You might try formatting the 16GB card in a card reader and then putting it back in the camera. If the camera then sees it, format the card again in the camera.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	read the manual. if it says it takes sdhc, it will, if it just says sd, then it won't. and or you may have to format the card to your camera|`|nU5UqACUaa	YES|`|mAirab0Daa	NO IT CANT ITS NOT MADE FOR THAT BUT YA KNO TRY ANYWAY IF YOU LOVE IT AND YOU WANT TO KEEP IT DONT.

qGfAlDd2aa	I couldn't find a lot on it.  However http://www99.epinions.com/specs/pr-Apex_... says the set contains a NTSC tuner.  That means it's analog and would require a converter box if you want to use it with an antenna after Feb 17 (or whenever the date is if Congress manages to move it).    If you use it with cable or satellite, you should be OK for the near term.|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	Do you have this hooked up to cable or satellite?  If so, don't worry.  Your provider will take care of converting it to analog for you.    If you get your signal from an antenna (rooftop or rabbit ears), you would already see the digital channels listed if your TV had a digital tuner.  They would shop up as a channel with a ".1" or ".2" after it, like 5.1.    So if you use an antenna AND don't see those digital channels listed, you do need a converter box.|`|qACzan5Faa	you should me.
NIwXEQafaa	try turning the "scart lead" - put the end in the tv to the dvd and end that was in dvd to the tv.when you switch the dvd on it should automatically change to the av , if changing the ends about douse not fix it get a "fully wired scart"|`|4iBIDgjRaa	The dvd will be connected to tv with a scart lead which is the AV channel. When you put the dvd on it should automatically switch to the dvd or Av. If there are 2 scart inputs on tv try connecting scart lead to th other scart input. this may switch automatically.                    If not a universal remote control from the pound shop should do it.( u will have to set it for your tv.)   good luck.|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	This probably won't help, but my sister has a TV where the AV is on channel 91.  Perhaps if you cycle through all the channels, it will be at the top or bottom of the list.|`|dqzoEw67aa	Well look a little harder at the buttons.  Somewhere there will be a "menu" button or something like that, push it and the inputs should show somewhere on the screen, and scroll using the volumn up and volume down buttons on the tv.  Experiment a little, something will bring up your menu or go on ebay and find your remote and buy a new one.|`|qACzan5Faa	the bottens on the tv.|`|rdamp9EOaa	go and buy a unversal remote control can be programmed to work with any tv  cheaper than a new tv you can by them in argos ,currys  ect ect
MeeJWmGtaa	You could get a prepaid one and spend only that much on it.    Every "real" cellphone plan costs at least $40-ish.
SqLIZQN5aa	I'm quite sure all iTouch apps can be used on the iPhone. iPhone apps using a camera, microphone, or gps have no use on the touch. There are some apps that require wifi to work, so you might want to check first before buying. The iTouch is a great buy. If you are looking for an iPod that can work as a productivity tool, a gaming platform, and of course your music player--its all there.|`|YDvZX9Ejaa	The apps are all the same and can be used on both, but some apps are designed to work using hardware only on the iphone, like a microphone or camera. I have an ipod touch, and if you have a wireless network where you spend most of your time, it is definitely a good buy. But without internet, the touch is really only good for games.
b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	make sure you have at least 1 controller connected.  Turn on the mic, press the connect button on the XBOX and then press and hold the connect button on the mic.  The  1 light on the headset should turn solid, meaning the headset is associated with controller 1.  You can change which controller it is associated with by pressing (not holding) the connect button again.

The line is called "Retentions"  It's used for cancelling, or the threat to cancel to lower your price plan.    Usually what you want to do is go to a new carrier, ask them to port your number over... and that you will cancel no matter what.    If you're experience crappy services from telus then try GSM    Fido or Rogers    Check their coverage maps first... maybe place you live only has telus/bell (same network)

ElvQTpUVaa	If you want free music (and are too lazy to read the answers posted every time this question comes up here, which is a few times a day) then read.    You have some options.    You can buy the music online at legit sites like iTunes.  If you dont have an iPod, you can use any number of free programs to convert the mp4 to mp3.  The problem is that much of the stuff on pay sites is covered by DRM that limits what you can do with it.    You can rip music from CDs  helpful if your local library is stocked, or you have friends that share your tastes but are okay with paying for them.    You can stream music from an internet radio station through your PC, then use a program like Audacity to record that stream as an MP3 or wav file.  You can scan through that recorded stream looking for the songs you want, then copy that part of the stream containing the desired song to an excerpted copy of the larger stream  (audacity handles this as well).    If you must use peer-share, you run the risk of infecting your pc by 1) downloading the client program, because it may have viruses; 2) visiting the webpage that hosts the program, because it may contain malware of its own & 3) downloading the media which (in peer-share) comes from other users.  No Peer-Share system can guarantee the safety or quality of its media.    Id avoid Limewire and its variants.  I tried limewire a few weeks back after years of happy reliance on winmx and emule.  It was nothing special  downloads werent fast, selection wasnt great.
9CKrP9Keaa	Most if not all phones have an indicator somewhere, usually under the battery. Wherever it is, it's there somewhere. If you find it and remove it, they will know you/someone did it. Insurance/warranty does not cover water damage. You're screwed, it's either repair or get a new one. I think the repair will  cost almost as much as a new. Check your USB again and try another Apple Store, you just might get lucky.

fe1d07deddd798cef8cc34a48d842115aa	Refurbished iPods are ones that have been returned for many reasons. Some did not work and they have been fixed, others were just upgraded within 30 days of buying them. They work just fine. My friend bought an iPod Video from Apple.com last year and it still works. They say (apple) that the warranty is 90 as opposed to new iPods having a warranty of one year, but buying directly from Apple is safer than trusting some random seller on eBay!|`|XHharKJgaa	Buying off of apple.com is always safe and reliable. The only question is if you're sure you want a refurbished unit.|`|GZjIVnULaa	you could buy it but i think apple may or may not put a new battery in the ipod and do all that good stuff if not than that could just be 70 bucks down the drain it also matters how many songs you listen to if you listen to 8 songs a day try a ipod shuffle or ipod nano both good ipods shuffle 60 bucks nano 100 to 200 lots of nanos|`|CHXyPvWYaa	Yes apple are a very reliable and trusted brand they will go through vigorous tests at apple to check they are up to scratch and if not apple should replace it for free !|`|Jdj3lInWaa	i would.  lots of times the items are simply items that have been returned and never used, they still have to sell them as refurbished.

It turns out, the control were very difficult to use, you basically have to turn the screen at a weird angle to where you're basically holding the ipod horizontal to the floor and can barely see the screen..You can't even adjust the sensitivity of the accelerometer which sucks.|`|cc3GVUZKaa	Well try it out. They have a Free Demo Version of it in the App Store. I personally don't like it. Maybe you will.|`|XHharKJgaa	I would recommend trying out the free version in the app store first, it is called "Super Monkey Ball Lite". The free version has three levels. However, after playing the Lite, I would not recommend it. The controls using the accelerometer are terrible. It is NOT worth the $8, but you should still try it out.

Or you could spend extra and get a wireless controller and a 60GB HD with the system.|`|LBQ50RnKaa	an xbox 360 arcade has poor graphic quality, cant play original xbox games, overheats easily (unless you buy an intercooler) not worth the money but xbox 360 is better and if you want an elite the only thing good about them is you can customize it so yeah if you want customizable get an elite but not get the original more worth your money!!!|`|LWyIsoblaa	get the pro becasue the arcade is cheap and will break often also the pro loads games faster and in my opion has a bit better of graphics|`|ex1sLVdUaa	you can save.. less memory... no headphones, no free live for a month, no xbox games,no free router cord is is worth buy the pro one|`|fcR06g9Saa	the arcade does not have a hard drive and the pro comes with two marvel ultimate aliance and forza motor sport 2 and i think it is a better idea to get the pro because the hard drive is alot of money and it does come with a memory card but the xbox will not perform as best as it can and the games will freeze more and certain games you cant even play without a hard drive.oh and the pro comes with a headset.|`|6jGmq2u8aa	If you are looking to buy I strongly suggest getting the Pro bundle, definitely well worth the money.    Here are the features:    ARCADE:  - 256MB hard-drive (Ridiculous considering some games require 8MB to save)  - Only standard TV input  - No Ethernet cable (used for LIVE)  - No headset  - Only compatible with 360 games    PRO:  - 60GB (More than enough for saving games)  - Standard AND high def TV input  - Comes with Ethernet cable  - Comes with headset   - Compatible with all 360 game + all the well know original Xbox games.    So the pro is definitely worth the extra money, arcade is a waste.|`|katIlecuaa	and arcade will get the red rings of death... which means it could break at any givin time for no reason... pro is protectec against that... but you should buy a ps3 because they are awsome|`|4LtszRxEaa	Go to this website http://www.xbox.com/en-US/hardware/compa...

785440e73a90380b1cea867ceab71780aa	Next year? This gen isn't over yet. The next PS3 will probably be made in 2012+, with the next generation being 2010-2014+. I'm actually not quite sure if it even will be as early as 2012, the console race is still going strong.|`|hHQIUrNjaa	ps4=not for a long time      fix your sources|`|pl2SocVKaa	give suzaku the best answer but there will be no ps4 next year|`|aicIZVGuaa	do you have any proof of this rumor? I think not|`|aROiy2Gnaa	dude the ps3 will be alive till at least 2015|`|d381leKpaa	that's BS, wherever you heard it from is an unreliable source. Apple, which i think is a much bigger company than sony (personally, i'm not sure if it actually is) can only reajust the ipod slightly once every year.  They also made the PS3 for about 10 years... sure some may break down, but they designed it for it to stay intact for like 216. But they may make ps4 slightly before that. They still havn't even breached 100% of the PS4's power, look at the graffics on killzone 2... supposedly that's only 60%, to make something BETTER we will have to be very far in technology.
fwnqB0dTaa	Your insurance will be "like for like" so they will replace it with another Storm.    As for the OS the other answerer so far has quoted .... that is an unofficial, leaked, test version that should not have been made public.    Some people have had severe problems with it, loss of internet, camera malfunctions etc.    It is also unauthorised firmware, so if anything goes wrong after installing, and you are unable to reset back to original state, your warranty is invalid and you can't get it fixed without paying the full price.|`|So1T9DKPaa	Go to crackberry.com and download 4.7.0.99.

She is the official owner of the XBOX 360, so you need to have her call Microsoft, and change the ownership over to you or whoever you are living with, and change the address to your new address.    Or, if you are so estranged as to make this impossible, you could impersonate her over the phone, although they may ask for certain confirmation, like the last 4 digits of her SSN or some security questions.

The empty spot might be empty on purpose.  Maybe it's not supposed to have a chip in it.    If this is a new treadmill you should call the company and have it repaired under warranty.  If you bought it used you'll have to call the company and arrange to have it repaired.

4Pk6VNftaa	Are you using the component video cable kit for the PS3?  This has 3 RCA cables for video and 2 for audio.  You must buy this cable as it's not included with the PS3.    The cable included with the PS3 is not component, but composite video, and is only capable of supporting a non-HD signal, which is why the picture is displaying that way.    If you are truly using the PS3's component video cable, go to the PS3's setup menu, and under video settings be sure to enable 720p and 1080i for supported screen resolutions.  That should force the PS3 into HD mode, and should display full screen on your TV.

This is how you do it:    Hold down the sleep/wake button (at the top right-hand corner of the iPhone) and home button at the same time for a few seconds. If you get a screen asking you to run the slider across the screen to turn the phone off, do it. This turn the device off. To turn it back on simply hold sleep/wake button again. This whole process reset the device. Hope that fixes your problem.|`|yqy5xfSbaa	reset it. to do this hold down the sleep/wake button and the home button at the same time...well that's how you reset the ipod touch, i dont know about the iphone, it's probably the same.|`|HXlsQ2LZaa	try turning it off  i had that then i took a screenshot and it froze on white and wouldnt unlock but everythign else worked  try turning it off if not then   http://www.zolved.com/synapse/view_conte...  force off is:  hold the top right button (for locking/unlocking) and the home button for 5-10seconds

XMJS3lrwaa	GOW2 is ok if you just want to play it once so make sure you get all you want. They put to much effort into the gore and none into the replay value. The multiplayer is ok but nothing really breathtaking.      For Left 4 Dead. It is a good game and is really fun...only on LIVE. The replay is pretty good but the gameplay is to repetitive for me. All it is is wave after wave after wave of mindless zombies. If you want a lot of killing this is your game. However, if you want a lot of killing and good graphics look somewhere else.      I hate RPG games but I have to say that Fallout 3 almost overtakes Halo 3, and I been with the Halo franchise since 2001. The replay value is unbelievable. I have beaten the game twice and barely explored and eighth of the world. The graphics are amazing, the gore is very satisfying and the story line knocks all others out of the water. Most RPG's are not very shoot 'em up but this game is the opposite. You get plenty of satisfaction from exploding heads.      In my opinion the single best campaign shooter of all time has to be Halo: Combat Evolved. But remember, this is counting the campaign. However, since Halo: CE is for the original Xbox platform you would be better off buying a new game. You said that you are getting LIVE and for that I say Halo 3. It isn't the most addicting game of all online games but it is the most fun and, even though there is a bunch of trash talk online, it is the most user friendly. The multiplayer gameplay is amazing. There is no gore like the games you first pointed out but it makes up for it by being able to teabag someone that you just sniped from two feet away.      My last suggestion is Call of Duty: World at War, or CODWAW. The replay on this game is very very very low. If you just want good campaign this is not the game for you. However, Call of Duty is not known for it's campaign. They are famous for their multiplayer. The online for CODWAW is easily the most addicting of all online games. This game requires a true eye for the game to see things that the other players can't see. Nothing is more satisfying than getting an eight kill streak and setting the German Shepherds on the other team.      As for the two games I recommend. Halo 3 and Fallout 3. There is no online for Fallout but Halo 3 makes up for that. Halo has medium replay ability and Fallout has a very high replay ability. All in all these game even each other out most for what you want. Fallout you can play for hours and never get bored and Halo is great for online. You will be happy. I promise.|`|vp1JASiTaa	Firstly you need to get Fallout 3. Everyone has to experience the greatness of that game.     Other than that, Left 4 Dead is an ok single player experience but an absolutely phenomenal multiplayer one on xbox live. It is the ultimate game of teamwork and teamwork is only fun when there are humans on your team. Killing zombies might get old eventually, but it is well worth your money.    Gears of War 2 is a great game. It has an pretty decent single player mode, but its multiplayer is where it shines as well.    I prefer Call of Duty World at War, but that is probably because I prefer realistic shooters. It is all a matter of preference though. Both Gears 2 and CODWAW are great games.|`|fiEtR7xNaa	Gears 1 does have replayability so I'm sure Gears 2 does 2. Not sure about Left 4 Dead. If u like shooters. . . . . . and r getting live.  . . . . do I really need to say it? Halo 3 duh lol|`|b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	i don't think left 4 dead has good replayablility.  it lasted about a week for me, because there are 4 scenarios in the game, with 5 levels each.  They are basically the same.  You move through the area, killing zombies, and eventually are rescued.  The multiplayer is cool because for a while you can play as a zombie, but in all it is just the same 2 scenarios over and over again.  Also, there is no party system, meaning it is difficult to set up games with friends and then add people through matchmaking    Gears 2 has some replayablility, but i hate their matchmaking (then again, i have been spoiled by the awesome matchmaking capablilites of halo 3)    I would get Halo 3 and gears 2 as the 2 shooters on the XBOX with the highest replay value.  You can play Halo forever, and Horde mode in Gears is really cool.|`|4LtszRxEaa	Well Left 4 Dead got pretty repitive. But Gears Of War 2 was good and had good replayable the xbox live isnt that good though. Ive seen some trailers online for Saints Row 2 that looks awesome for story and live and there is an online coop mode. if you cant get that get Call Of Duty 4 or 5 that is great for live and story.
d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	Are you sure about the 7XX channels not being HD?  Because that would explain the bars, and on my Comcast cable system, all the HD channels are in the 700s.    Another thing you may wish to check is which sort of cables you have connecting your TV to your cable box.  You need either HDMI or component (3 video cables that are red, green, and blue + the red and white audio cables).  Anything else is not carrying an HD signal and may result in the bars you see.
KNYF1hnhaa	No, if you update the software it will lock the iPhone again.
d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	In 2 ways.    1.  You should receive a better picture.  Digital doesn't suffer from things like ghosting or static.  It pretty much either comes in great, or it's blank.    2.  It frees up the radio spectrum that are currently used for analog TV signals, and let's us use them for something else.|`|rH3ylNuYaa	Free high def , the tv station can save so much more power as digital signals can reach far at lower power. Also you can fit 4 channels on one   channel , called sub channels. Also better sound.|`|cd444ad7205162c19a3662445956ed32aa	More channels and better picture quality are the main advantages.The government can sell the analogue frequencies for large amounts of money.The radio channels on digital Freeview  are poor in sound quality  compared to FM though. I would hope that DAB is better but I don,t see why I should spend extra to receive it.    I just looked at the technical spec. for DAB in the UK and I am not impressed.  So it looks like Hi Fi radio is going to finish when they turn off the analogue transmitters. Mind you with all the compression on the broadcasts on FM they are ruining it anyway.

HekFanRvaa	ahhhh...hello?|`|FboFkYDaaa	well if you mean how you can change the color of your PS3 the only thing i know is you can buy a white or silver(not really sure) in japan, you can go to playasia.com and order it from there but u will have to pay shipping fees    or you can buy a sticker for your PS3 in decalgirl.com don't worry it doesn't leave and residue when you take it out|`|MAadMKvZaa	wtf ?? is color??|`|PkHJy79Xaa	Go in your settings and see if there's a setting for this.  You might have gone in there earlier and changed something without knowing.  Make sure your Scart lead is in properly in the back of your PS3 and in the back of your TV.  When they are in crooked they can cause loss of colour, loss of sound or both.
B70mmVwPaa	Okay lets split this up into parts for you.    Game plays (I assume you mean saves) can be backed up to an external drive suck as a usb stick or an external hdd either manually or via the ps3 backup utility.    If you have synchronised your trophies lately they will be on the server, when the hdd is replaced its just a matter of getting your psn account to re-synchronise the trophies to your system.    Friends list is attached to your psn account so all you have to do is sign into your account, they wont be lost.    For your downloaded games there is a view downloads section on the psn store for you to see what you have purchased/downloaded in the past where you can download them again.    One last note, the hdd change now requires you have a copy of the most recent firmware on a removable device such as a usb stick, to get this go on the official playstation website for your region and download it there, it should be on your usb stick in the following structure: PS3 and inside that folder UPDATE which is the place the download goes.    Note those folder names are case sensitive so they must be in capital letters.|`|d17327cb4d7df3e7de42a5b5e3161f67aa	yes you can back up all your data to put on your new hd. There is an option in the playstation options to back up everything to an external hd prior to replacing the hd. then when you've replaced the hd you can transfere everything back to the new hd.  You might want to check out the playstation site for proper instructions or check online.|`|obIaluqHaa	You can upgrade your Hard drive as long as you buy a 2.5 sata.  Before you do it find back-up.  It will be under the second icon from the left.  Select it and make sure you have a thumb drive plugged into your usb port on the front of your ps3.  It will copy your saved games and other data such as friends list.  It will not however back up your downloaded games.  It's my understanding that you can download the games you have bought up to 3 times.  I replaced my 80 gig on my ps3 with a 320 gig and I'm very happy with that.  Also you will have to reinstall your disc based games that require installation such as "GTA"  Once your replace the hard drive and turn it back on the PS3 will do the necessary installation of the PS3 operating system.  Then you can click the icon to restore the saved data.  Once that is done you can then go to the PS store and download your games that you have purchased in the past.  They will have a small red icon over them showing you have paid for them in the past.    All your network settings and things that are important will still be there.    Another cool thing you can do is buy an laptop external hard drive case and then format the old ps3 hard drive and use it as a backup for the ps3.  My favorite site to buy the cases is "www.dealextreme.com". I now use mine to copy movies to then plug it in the ps3 and watch them.  You will need to format the external drive as fat32.  Create a folder system identical to that on the Playstation 3 by creating folders labelled "Picture" (not Photo), "Music", "Video" and "Game".  Then you can watch all your downloaded movies on your PS3.
fc73688b6b696bdb82f9d3d9da4d7e8eaa	You need to login to your t-mobile account and go to your handset settings. In there you can edit your signature as well as edit your email accounts. Alternatively, you can go to "Internet Email" in the menu on your phone and edit your accounts in there. Once you get into editing the individual accounts, you can edit your signature. It won't show on your phone but will automatically add onto the email once sent.

BTW in amazon they still sell the headset  bundle.    Good luck|`|7gL9laqLaa	Motorstorm Pacific Rift        Please vote me best answer :)|`|mPaqhgUuaa	The 2 games I would get will be GTA IV and Motorstorm. GTA has so much possibility and such a variety of things to do. It's almost impossible to get bored of it. Motorstorm is quite entertaining too.    For the greatest hits, depends on what you like. Assassin's Creed for an INSANE 2 hour experience, but then it become repetitive. Warhawk is a bit more re-playable I guess..
oFtwiquCaa	the blackberry storm does not have wifi you have to get the data plan for 30.00 and that will allow you to use the internet + what ever plan you get|`|CrjU3eWYaa	It has both. The blackberry you have to get its own phone plan, with unlimited internet, email, etc. Also, the internet isn't free on the dare. I don't know where you got that. The storm is a MUCH better phone, they actually spent time and money on it to make it a good phone. The dare is a iphone wanna be.
vQ0IyRluaa	Yes I think it is worth it.  Why would you want to play on a ps3 for its good graphics by using the AV inputs?  You will notice a big difference if you did HD!|`|EfejPjIMaa	If you have a component cable (red, blue, green and red, white) then no (unless you want the audio the HDMI cable gives you, but optical audio is still better than HDMI audio).  You can get the same video quality from component cables that you can get from an HDMI cable for a 720p TV (HDMI cable is required to get 1080p).  If you don't have component cables, then you might as well get the HDMI cable as you are going to pay about the same amount of money and get better audio.  I use the HDMI cable for video, and an optical cable for audio, but I also have a 1080p TV, that is why I use an HDMI cable.      HDMI and component cables are both better than composite cables (red, white, and yellow), and you can not get 720p with composite cables, only 420p.    If you want the best audio, use an optical cable.  If you want the best video for a 720p TV, then HDMI or component cables are equal.  You just get better audio with an HDMI cable over component cables.|`|FboFkYDaaa	yes its really worth it i bought an HDMI cable for my PS3 and even though its only 720 you can really tell the difference, just don't buy the really expensive ones you can get one in wall-mart for less than $35 and there are more games in the PS3 that are 720 than there are 1080 anyway
W40SuZICaa	no, headphones are just headphones. its doesnt really matter what brand. they all work with a headphone port.|`|u1GNB2W8aa	of course they'll work :]  any earphones will work on any ipod|`|vKDwaqPraa	yes the gummy earphones will work, any headphones work with the ipod o_o as long as it fits in the jack. but gummy hp break easily|`|AiOBRjYlaa	yes its universal|`|IWzsm7j0aa	if it looks normal in size its most likely will fit.    Ask any electronics person and they will know for sure.|`|hb1H5XAyaa	they will work fine.|`|FIG58FVpaa	They will work just fine.
3zM7JptVaa	first get the wiFinder on itunes. its free.  then click on that and if should load on... if you have a password they might ask you for it. also in settings you can save it...but it sounds like you haev done that.    if it still doesn't work, try and bring it to an apple store. i am sure they could fix it and if they can't, they would probably replace it right there for you.
LOuYcK0vaa	I think so.You need a converter to convert your movies.You can use Nidesoft Zune video converter.It can convert almost all video format, e.g.MPG, MPEG, WMV, MP4, MOV, AVI, DivX, 3GP, RM, Xvid, ASF, VOB to Zune Movie / Zune Video MP4, WMV, H.264, MP4 AVC format. Zune Movie / Zune Video Converter can also conver popular audio formats including WAV, WMA, MP2, AC3, MP3, APE, RA , OGG to Zune Music Audio MP3 , WMA, AAC.  http://www.nidesoft.com/zune-video-conve...
dRUgXlOLaa	i would choose AT&T over Verizon but i would choose T-Mobile over all of them.  If you go with AT&T see the following link for FREE phones.    http://wireless.5linx.com/mobile/?r=5lin...|`|cDYowiDNaa	US cellular has the best coverage, but AT&T is not bad. Don't get verizon....no     I canceled my verizon phone service a month ago because they were constantly messing up my phone bills. They were always trying to sneak in new charges.They were adding new charges every month and sometimes they would send me 3-4 bills. I had to call them every month, waste my lunch-break, just to get them fix their mistakes. They would always apologize, but the same thing happened every month. Finally, I decided to cancel them and get service else where. Well, I paid my final bill. Some how I managed to over pay it and they sent me a check for the over paid balance. The funny thing is that the very same day that I got a check in the mail, I got a letter from an attorney that was representing verizon, and it said that I owed verizon $21.00 I couldn't believe it. I got a check and a threat from verizon on the same day. I have had service with them for years, and I always paid my bills when due.  If anyone has verizon, you should watch your bills closely|`|KSPu9s9Iaa	verizon it has good phones good plans best coverage
lJAaBmlyaa	Online it is probably showing you your current usage. Look at the dates on your bill and compare them to the dates online. You are billed almost a month after you use the service.|`|k2wiYJAcaa	call them and explain to them your problem, there was probably a mix up on the bill.|`|ee74f3aa67efefa8e49e21be6f4ec61faa	Whoa!  You need to make a phone call or go back to the place that you got the phone and get this straightened out.

LkulUylbaa	Well, if you are talking about old cell phones versus new cell phones, there are a LOT of differences.     The camera: Old old cell phones used to have 0.3 megapixel/1.3 megapixel cameras. Now, we have 3.2/5/8 memgapixel cameras with more zoom and better quality/more features.    The screens: They used to be very crappy resolution, non color, and small. Now, phones like the iPhone and Touch Pro have phenomenal screens. The iPhone has a 3.5 inch touchscreen with 480x320 resolution! Touch screens are new too.    The size/style: They used to be ugly clunkers, fat and ugly. Now, phones like the iPhone/Storm/Behold/Curve 8900 are beautifully designed. We even have 'luxury' phones that cost thousands of dollars.    MP3 players: They used not to have them and now almost every single one has it.    Hope I helped!|`|7A8h5ralaa	phones are sleeker and more stylish now, as compared to the past, where they were bigger, and more awkward looking. also, phones can go more places, and perform more tasks, like play music, entertain with games, and even manage your schedule.|`|lRfxqScVaa	simple and bulky to complex and slick
ApnV9ePZaa	I'm not sure... I don't use sprint I use AT&T but you can try and ask them for a new phone. The charger is probably cheap enough where purchasable. I dunno what to do about the mute problem but I think its weird... XD
t2rUhyANaa	That is indeed an old camera. The Canon EF is a 35mm SLR that was produced between 1973 and 1978. The 200mm is just the lens that you currently have mounted. It is a detachable lens, so it's not part of the camera description.     Those numbers you are asking about are ASA film sensitivities (aka ISO). You load a film (typically 100ASA) and set this wheel to 100. 400 for 400ASA, etc...       Here's an online instruction manual:  http://www.canonfd.com/efind.htm    And here's a pdf of the owner's manual:  http://www.canonfd.com/pdf/ef.pdf    To do any kind of research on the web, just google canon EF. You might get some results that pertain to the current family of unrelated EF lenses, but you'll be able to tell the difference ;)
CVyVrUUAaa	You cant get any ring tones free because once you putt your number when you sign up they will make you pay like $5 every mouth!  It happened too me.
LkulUylbaa	I have the LG VU.    1) I say that the texting is pretty good for what it is (touch screen). It is not fantastic but pretty good.    2) No, I really do not get why the blue tooth would be hard to use, all you do is turn it on.    3) No, I have dropped it countless times and there are just some scratches.    4) Nope, it is very easy to use and not hard at all.    Hope I helped!
xPZVL8Gqaa	Wow, the same thing is happening to me and I came on here to see if there was an answer to stop it. The only difference between your problem and mine is that I texted google for a definition. I'm starting to think that there's a problem with Google, hopefully temporary. Sorry, this doesn't help... but I figured you would feel better knowing that this is happening to someone else too, haha.
9CKrP9Keaa	You can buy as many phones as you like and change them as often as you like. You have to call Sprint and they will switch service to new phone. If you had T-Mobile all you do is take out the sim and put it in the new phone. I switch between 2 phones every 2-3 months.
rDsKB0uXaa	i dont work there
FsPBIZOqaa	You need a converter to convert videos to mp3,try Joy video to mp3 converter,it can convert all video files such as DVD, MOV, MP4, RM, RMVB, DivX, ASF, VOB, 3GP, WMV, MPEG, AVI to MP3 .  You can enjoy your favorite DVD and video clip on your mp3 player as a portable DVD Player.   Download at http://www.mp3dvdsoft.com/mp3-video-conv...  GOOD LUCK!
becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	Well it looks that you don't have any HD set-top boxes for now, but continue asking for it, since if you just receive analog cable, your 42" TV is wasted.    Back to your questions.    With an HD set-top and an HD TV, yes you will get HD.  With digital cable you will get better quality TV in your room, but there is no way you can get HD.    Your TV is rather small, so everything looks good, even analog cable.|`|hQf0BwT2aa	You are terribly CONFUSED!!!  Plasma verse   CRT   are like comparing  apples and prunes.................Different technology all together.
cfaEVLwvaa	no but if you lost your one, or it doesnt work you can get a replacement, as long as you know your number and remember your details. otherwise check the website.  www.blyk.co.uk.  I know its not much but i hope it helped a little.|`|1eCY0lQ3aa	Email me for an invite code.
4Ofewbeoaa	30 a month|`|46cgStLTaa	okay...for one it depends what kind of phone you get...2 i have a razor and my txt messaging is only 9.99 a month....so if you have alltel or verizon its 9.99 but for the others i don't know!
yogS60O3aa	Yes I LOVE my samsung eternity.    Hey I just bought this phone a few weeks ago myself and I couldn't decide wether to go for it or not.  Well after reading reviews and watching videos, it went for it, and I absolutely love it no regrets yet.  If it helps, my husband got a blackberry curve 8320 and my phone is way easier to find things, and it's brighter and pictures/videos are better quality. Here's my opinion on the phone, likes/dislikes etc.    PROS:    --The Touchscreen.  This is my first full touchscreen phone, and I love it it's so easy to use, and you can set the calibration to the type of 'touch' you want, you know how hard/soft of a hit it takes to press the buttons.  It also has the vibrating ''haptic feedback''.  The phone even has 'widgets' on the side, kind of like windows vista gadgets.  You can choose which ones you want to display/not display, and just drag/click them for easy access to applications/music player/calendar/calculator/alarm clock, etc.  --Buttons! The call, back and end buttons on the bottom.  The Volume rocker key (which also doubles as a 'scrolling' guide through contacts and music), the lock/unlock button at the top.  The shortcut menu key, and the quick access camera button.  --Music.  The built-in 3.5mm headphone jack!  You can use your own set of headphones on this phone, love that.  The media player on the phone is awesome, you can minimize the player and you can listen to your own mp3's while browsing through your phone, or even text messaging.  --Texting. This phone has an accelerometer built in, so if you don't want to text regular t9 style, just give the phone a turn to the side, and you've got your full qwerty keyboard.  And now that full qwerty is available while entering contacts into the phonebook!  --The Camera.  Great 3 mega-pixel camera, the pictures look amazing, and crystal clear.  --Illumination Lights.  Choose from red, orange, green, blue and pink and when someone texts or calls, it'll light up from the bottom of the phone.  --Call.  The quality with calls and speakerphone is super clear, and loud.  And it has a proximity sensor, when you hold the phone up to your face while your on a call, the screen will stay dark, but if you pull it away from your face the screen lights up so you can see things.  --Video option.  --Memory Card slot  --Personalization of Profiles  --Bluetooth  --TV and GPS if you purchase an optional package.    OK, so obviously there's a lot to love about this phone, but I do have a few cons.    CONS:  --No speed dial.  Not a huge issue, they're working on an update for that.  --No themes.  And you can set your own picture for the background, but not the screen saver, but that's not a huge issue since you only see your screen saver for like 2 secs. when locking/unlocking the phone.  --No USB port.  --You can personalize your own ringtones for your callers, with your own mp3's, but the ringtone has to be under a certain size argh!  --No WiFi  --No flash on camera.    Overall, I love this phone!  Just a few quirks but nothing that stopped me from getting this phone!  I can deal!  I'm awaiting that update for the speed dial and that's about it.  If your into touchscreens, and your looking on not spending a fortune unlike the iphone this phone doesn't require an extra $60 dollar data/text package which is nice!  If you aren't looking for a confusing smart phone too, then just go ahead and get it.  Make sure your pros outweigh your cons, and go for it!  You won't regret it, I don't!  Hope I helped you out!      Sorry for the long opinion, just tryin to help you!  E-Mail me if you have any more questions!
aOZ7JPAgaa	If the phone is unlocked the phone should work with the 3G network BUT make sure where you live you have the 3G network b/c  not everywhere in the US does the T mobile 3G network work everywhere.........just some parts does tmobile have 3G network|`|XJSOToRGaa	Yes it will work on 3G as long as there is 3G coverage in your area (easy way to tell: on day 1 was the G1 available in your area?  If so, you have 3G coverage...if not, you dont).
JnuU4c5raa	you might be able to use a program called iPhoneBrowser to put it on manually. I haven't been able to figure out iPhoneBrowser, but I;m sure it's possible.|`|6f24c732a698db8d1059da86764daee8aa	The best way to Jailbreak your Touch is to do it with a Mac.   Until a solid GUI is made (not so buggy) you may incur problems   The Dev Team gave detail instructions on how to do it on a Mac, not everyone has a Mac. I have a Mac and a PC (5 of em). I have not jailbroken mine just because i am waiting for a JB that will break it and then when i have to reboot , i connect hit a few buttons and bam im on the go again! Theres nothing out like that , yet! I hope they figure out a permanent fix
kFW3U6u4aa	if you have itouch or iphone no problem  but if its a normal ipod u can only get certain games not apps  sorry
fbw7YijKaa	it is mandatory to have a data plan with an iphone. iphones are data dependant phones. if you were to get a bad rep that agreed to remove the data plan, then you could end up with a bill as high as 5000 bucks. the data plan for i phone is 30.00. you can upgrade to an iphone, but you have to have this data plan.
ReqWzUM0aa	Yes.
gASz3hDWaa	I do not think there is such thing as "the best" it is whatever you require or maybe the service that your family and friends have so it is cheaper to call.|`|lJAaBmlyaa	You have to find the one that's right for you. Check the coverage on the website, look at the plans, and look at the phones. Verizon has the largest mobile to mobile network, At&t has rollover and T-Mobile has the fav five. No matter who you choose check the coverage first!!! every carrier had street level coverage on their website|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	o2 are the best as their customer service is excellent and their deals are great as well go to www.o2.co.uk|`|aGaqc3lnaa	well it depends what features you like. i am on verizon and i luv it!!!|`|awUzUxo5aa	02    You get lots of free extras and Treats all the time....|`|119ef08c7749b873756963e35de2ab40aa	Defo o2|`|GxFsNjt7aa	Whizz mobile or 02
2afVnStxaa	What I would do is to go inside the verizon store and go to an actual person there. Tell them the problem and that you wish to pay your final bill but need to know the exact amount. They should be able to look it up under your name and other info if not by the number. If they cannot, they can call the customer service and get the info for you and then you can pay your bill. I had the same situation with verizon, it actually took me about three months to finally find out what I owed, but by then they had added late charges and made me pay it at the time, but then sent me a refund for the late charges after verifying that I had in fact been trying to get the info for three months. But it wasn't until I went into a store and talked with someone there that i finally got the amount, and it took her almost two hours to get it at that. Hope this helps. Good luck to you.
pmrKsxHTaa	I totally agree, but the better question is whats up with verizon's crappy *** service?  I NEVER seen to get service anywhere I go.  I thought they were never supposed to stop working for me or something?  As for your phone, just got a samsung glyde and its awesome, I love it.  The EnV is WAY cool, it has a full keyboard and internet access.  Also, the blackberry pearl.  The new LG Dare is pretty sweet too!|`|M9YNvbraaa	you can call customer service, they may have different phones, or you can consider going to a different carrier- at&t has a wide variety of phones, that is if you are not under contract to verizon. and for a 2 year contract the pricing is pretty decent.  You may want to check on the network service in your area though|`|gzERnclQaa	I also have Verizon and presently have a Samsung phone.  I've broke 2 Samsung phones at the hinge next to the little charge indicator light.  I live on the edge of a service area I guess, as I have trouble getting signal here.  If I drive down the highway either direction I get good service.  The replacement phones all look so cheap.|`|GhsqaXsdaa	I have the enV2, its amazing. Yes, the colors are crappy, but i got a pink case for mine. I seriously cant live without it!    and for the girl under me:  i dont no whats up with verizon with you, but it always works great for me....
f6914qM3aa	if you have verizon inpulse (prepaid) for only $20 a month you can get unlimited text,messaging,picture messaging,video messagining to anybody,any network,in the u.s.a.      Dial *611, select Additional Options, then select the option for calling plans and features and follow the prompts for changing optional features.    http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store...|`|Hf6ciYjmaa	Yep. You usually pay a bit more though.    I know you can with Virgin Mobile :D|`|LAai8mh4aa	$20 dollars for a month of unlimited texting through Virgin Mobile.|`|ReqWzUM0aa	Depends on what cell phone provider you have.     For AT&T, you press 611 and it takes you to a choice of things you can buy. Like free nights & weekends, unlimited internet, ect. One of the things is texting packages. Like $5 for 200, $10 for 1,000, and unlimited for $20. But after 30 days, it'll expire and you'll have to buy a new unlimited texting package.

YyXtxeNGaa	Either one is a trade off.  What is more important to you ... High quality photos or High quality videos?  You will not get both with the current products available.    Both Canon and Nikon make Digital SLR's with video recording capability.|`|mf0n9gaSaa	If it were me, I'd definitely buy the SLR.  However, SLRs can get pricey if you want to buy all the lenses and equiipment.   I'm not very sure whether there is something that takes both high quality photos and video, but cameras generally take decent quality videos.|`|RwqziqWgaa	Even professional SRL can record poor footage. On the other hand very expensive camcorder can take just decent photos and they lack most of the features you will find on cheaper point & shot cameras. So that depends most of the job you are planning to do.

tueHUkoTaa	Even though it may be converted to a proper format, as you say, certain cameras still contain certain codecs in their video files that are incompatible with Windows Movie Maker (even if they can still play in Media Player, etc.).    The only way to fix this is to update your PC, to try to keep your codecs up-to-date. I've had trouble with this, too, because the codec used by the camera couldn't be found through Windows Update (or anything else). But in any case, updating your computer is the most likely solution.

VJ1C5JsYaa	First off I got a 360 when it first came out and have never once even had a problem of any type. The new 360 arcades have the Jasper chip in them. It is likely that they will still have the RRoD however the number of problems will be lower. The problem more often the not comes from the owner of the system and not just the system. Stupid people that shove there system into a tight space are just asking for the system to over heat. All electronics are like that. They need room to discharge heat other wise it will be a problem.    The best way to avoid a RRoD is to place the 360 on its side. Before you turn it on put it in an area that it can "breath". Same with the "brick".    as for your questions about an entertainment stand......I honestly hope your not serious about not knowing what it is..... If not don't worry about it. An entertainment stand is just a piece of furniture that is used to hold DVD players, VCR, Cable boxes, ETC ETC.... I wouldnt even bother putting your 360 in it even if you had one.|`|KZsdVGJzaa	don't worry about red ring of death all u have to do is set the 360 horizontally on it's side, keep it off a carpet, (preferably put it inside an entertainment stand) give it at least 5 inches of room, and put the power brick on top of some type of book|`|OlW9SsmBaa	newer versions are not as prone to this as the older ones  xbox 360 is great   go for it!

You will have to buy a prepaid phone  (its called a GO Phone and will be in an orange round plastic container) you can buy them practically anywhere att stores or places like Walmart. The cheapest phone they have costs $19.99, it will be very plain and wont have alot of features not even a camera, but this is ok if you just want the sim card. Then after buying the phone with the sim card you activate the sim card and add money or features to it through calling and paying with a debit/credit card or by buying a prepaid att Go Phone card (again sold almost everywhere-like Walmart). The prepaid sim card will give you a new number because its meant to be for the phone you bought it with. If you just need a replacement sim card for your phone (so you can keep your number or because you lost or broke your sim card) you should go to a att corporate store and tell them you need a new sim card (it wont be prepaid), it could be free or cost around $20.00. If you go to a att store to get a new sim they will need your account holders information (the name, phone number and the last four numbers of their social) I hope I helped let me know if you have anymore questions.|`|qBDL8iFxaa	not very much. it varies|`|pws54J1daa	You won't get a new number but the price varies for it.|`|LFpglJWwaa	Really you can, if your Razor is unlocked, if its not you can call your service provider for the unlocking code, but only if your contract is done or they feel they can trust you. You can go to ebay.com and there are people that sell Pre-paid un-activated (so you can choose your area code)( some people sell SIM already activated and has a number like ex. California) SIM cards that are compatible with AT&T or Cingular. Just go to e-bay or whoever sells them. Im getting my pre-paid for $5|`|dYWlmncfaa	Just go to an AT&T store. I needed to port my number from Sprint to GoPhone and back to Sprint so I could get an awesome deal on a post plan only offered to *new* customers. I borrowed a friend's AT&T phone (happened to be a razor like yours), walked into the AT&T store and they gave me a free prepaid sim card. I had to buy 15 minutes worth of minutes and it took 10 minutes to port my number, but it was all worth the 0.99$ Blackberry 8830 and 25% corporate discount.     Bottom line: DO NOT PAY A DIME!!!!!!
xazut5X7aa	faster than calling, you can do it in silence, you dont have silences, you can think of what you want to say, easier to send like homework or something because you dont need them to write it down, and a lot more.|`|LkulUylbaa	There are tons! Here are some:    1) In quiet places, you don't have to look like a buffoon blabbering.    2) It is easier in some cases (awkward people/ just a quick message).    3) If you have unlimited, it is cheaper than talking.    4) On some phones, if you are in a meeting, you can have a text message sent and say you will call later.    Texting is a really useful thing!    Hope I helped!|`|qBDL8iFxaa	communication without awkward silence. lol,  long convos without wasting very much time|`|debe2c41970408fbfc290d64869a70c9aa	if you hav a unlimited text you dont have to use day time mins and if you cant talk at work you can text it is fast and you can hav a full conversation
q0ErVj1Daa	No. Unless your an expert with re-attaching wires, there's no way it will work. Your best bet is to go buy a new one at Gamestop. Get the Wireless one.|`|IlndnVyBaa	that wire is very thin, if you can strip off some of the plastic from the broken parts you should see some mini wires    Try joining these wires by twisting with plyers or with solder and it might work.    Actually a much much easier way is to use flashlights as a subsitute for the sensor bar. It will work.    Also if you have a video camera with night mode infrared light that will work as well|`|BOMu89Ttaa	No, it's not going to work. Sorry but that's how it's going to go. Either by a new one or you can get a wireless one which will prevent wire breaking :)|`|bff97b7c93b8f569c7a92eb295f974f2aa	nah man  you can use candles or a flashlight, it'll still work  or you can just go buy a new sensor bar, they're only around $15 i think

M9YNvbraaa	if you get a current phone that at&t offers,they all require sim cards, if the sim card that you currently have has a fireball on it yo are good to go.  The only at&t phone that would require a change to you family plan would be the i-phone.  you can use an i-phone on a family plan but the i-phone also requires an additional data plan- the lowest cost data plan for the i-phone i believe is  $30.00, you can find all this information about phones and plans on the att.com website or cal customer care at 611 from your wireless or 1-800-331-0500 from a landline|`|c4384Qf1aa	i think a palm,blackjack,blackberry are good heres a link for thousand hope i helped      http://www.wirefly.com/phones/at&t/upgra...      look around here theres others these are the upgrade prices but they have the regular to if you look around|`|ULX0NLUHaa	If you go on the at&t website, wireless.att.com and click on phones and stuff, look through all of the phones and pick one you want. You can get ANY AT&T phone you want, because they use a sim card. So you'll get your new phone, then take the sim card from your old phone and put it into the new phone. And it will work no problem!      Enjoy! =]   Any questions, email me!|`|TF7ffV6maa	Try ebay.  Or one of those authorized dealers that'll just trade phones with you.  if it's ATnT with the SIM card, it shouldn't be difficult at all.
ReqWzUM0aa	Look around on Youtube. I've heard that Redsnow is a good program to use in order for a successful jailbreak. But, I believe it's only a temporary jailbreak, so every time you turn your iPod Touch off, you'll have to re-jailbreak it.|`|kTyiKldbaa	just do a Google search of "dev team"    DO NOT attempt any iPod touch 2G jailbreak method no matter what YouTube videos say there is no jailbreak and people have failed to bring forth a jailbroken iPod touch 2G they just have powerpoint created tutorials no evidence.    simply put the Dev Team has jailbroken it, now the iPod touch 2G like the 1G and iPhones checks to make sure it has the correct software and is not jailbroken. but unlike the other ones that check only once the iPod touch checks on every reboot so they have created something you apply so that it can stop the check and it can be jailbroken. the problem is they can't find a way to stop it permanently so you'll have to re-stop the checks every re-boot and if you don't the checks will discover 3rd party software and you'll get White screen of Death and your iPod will refuse to boot. so they're looking for a solution and that's stopping them from releasing the jailbreak now since they have one al ready. Hope it helped:)
TF7ffV6maa	if u dont have insurance, i think you can pay 50 bucks and get a refurbished phone from verizon.   i have the lg voyager 2, it's not worth the money i paid for it tho.  the env2 is the exact same phone, without the external touch screen.|`|GhsqaXsdaa	env2 is amazing.|`|CNotcjbaaa	enV2's are great for testing and are pretty hardy, plus they're only something around 50 dollars.

You have had a hard lesson - sorry.|`|15c03bf06cee5a4061edb3180eff2867aa	Sorry, but once taped-over, it's forever lost.

The answer is no.|`|KNYF1hnhaa	When you restore from backup it replaces all content on your iPhone with the content in the backup file from the date and time the backup was made.  Because of this, it will erase any new data that came on the phone after the date and time of the backup and there is no way to get the newer data back.

I8yV5Hglaa	Plug it into the computer it is currently synced to.    Then restore it.|`|TfBImKibaa	You can try using restore option when you connect your ipod in.After the restore, you'll be prompted to choose to restore from backup. You might not want to do this because it might return the settings(Password and such) to your ipod. I'm not sure though. To play it safe, select the other option and just hit sync in the ipod screen. It basically does the same thing if you have all your stuff in Itunes.    If that doesn't work, you'll have to put your Ipod in recovery mode.

tueHUkoTaa	Try out Aiptek's line of digital camcorders. They are very cheap for their quality, which is above average. They are also compact, and very reliable.    Prices range from around $80 - $120, depending on whether or not you get an HD camcorder, or whether it's used or new, etc. But that's great, considering an average HD camcorder usually costs between $300 - $600.|`|DSTyTjoeaa	I just use my Sony Cyber-Shot digital camera on movie mode and it works great! so if you aren't going to do real professional movies I'd just stick with a digital camera that can record video (most can).

Cc6k5vJiaa	If you already have a cell phone and are just looking to get a new one, get the iPhone.    However, the iPod touch is just the iPhone minus the phone.  It doesn't have a mic, but you can get earphones with an embedded mic at target for like $20.  With the iTouch, even if you do get earphones with a mic in it, you can't blow out a candle on this app called zippo.  But what you DON'T get is extremely minimal.    You can get Fring for the iPod touch to call people for free when you're in a wi-fi network, but to make sure it'll work for SURE, download one of these onto your computer.    http://www.voipcheap.com/  http://www.voipbuster.com/  http://www.voipstunt.com/    I'm suggesting you to download these onto your computer first to make sure they work in your region.  When you get the Fring app on your iPod touch, if you live in the U.S., you have to dial 1 first, then the area code, then the number, then press SIP.    &If you're in a wi-fi network, with the ipod touch, you can send free texts to anyone with Yahoo! One Connect.  It'll look like an instant message conversation and you have to open Yahoo! One Connect to see if you have any new messages, but I like it.    I suggest you to just search through the app store to see what you'd be interested in.  Then, search it on Youtube.  People 'review' apps.  That way, you can see what's best for you and if the ipod touch / iphone is really for you.    The warranty isn't really worth it.  You get a one-year warranty for just buying the ipod touch.  If you want an additional year, it costs like $60.  If you find a warranty any longer than that, it probably won't cover the battery.  The battery will eventually go out and I believe it's like $80 to replace.    I'm not looking to buy the iPhone, but that's because I have Fring.  But, to give some background info., I was never big on calling, so the free daily calls with Fring are enough for me.  My main ways of communicating with people are e-mail and instant messaging.  I'm easy to entertain, but I like the iPod touch.  I've found that when I buy $50 games for game consoles, I get tired of them easy and I rarely get past the first few levels.  With the iPod touch, you have some GOOD games for FREE.  They play like real video games and you can play them wherever you are.    If you want to make sure you're making the best decision, I'll give you some examples of what I think is the best of the app store.

Change the "Media Kind" to audiobook.|`|N26qrTd3aa	Well I know with my MP3 player if you plug it into the computer and open it up to veiw its files, there is a seperate file that says "Audibles" and another that says "Recordings" or "Voice Recordings" or something like that. anyways, the songs end up being listed below the files and the books go into Audibles... using the computer I would just drag it to correct this problem and put it in that folder. Is there anything like that with yours?

hJP9y6kjaa	It sounds like the JSX is a little more versatile, but the 6505+ is all about the nasty crunchy distortion.    If that's what you want, I'd go with the 6505+, pretty much hands down.    Some reviews below.    The quality of your tone will depend on your speakers, too. More watts = better bass, in general, less watts = more cranked rock sound. I love the Celestion GT75-12's, 75 watt speakers, you normally find them in the Marshall 1960a cab, if that means anything to you. Consider swapping your speakers out if they're not up to snuff!

yIgd5vDAaa	The representative probably messed up a feature on your account when activating you to a BlackBerry plan. It has happened to me many times before with Verizon, having the same problem.

Wait a few seconds, then press the power key. It should go through its boot cycle and turn on again.    Did you install an app recently? If so, it may be unstable. Think about uninstalling it.

1d193a581f413c8f01296a8f36389636aa	Verizon has better programming and choices with telephone, television and internet. All three will cost around $120.00 but they have special promotions for all three for about $99.99.  The only requirement is that you need to make sure Verizon Fios is available in your city and house.  They don't have service in all areas.  A professional will come to your house and wire a fiber optic line from the telephone pole to the house.  Installation can take 4 to 6 hours.    Directv is better for pricing. They do have a variety of programming but not extensive as Verizon Fios.   If you don't need internet and telephone then Directv is more suitable for you.  Packages range from $29.99 to $90.00 depending on what channels you want.    The only thing you need to know is that during storms and rainy weather picture quality and sound will be interrupted because of the satellite transmission to your house.  They will have a professional installer come to your house to install a satellite dish on top of your home.  Installation can take up to 2 hours.|`|b69Gm5fPaa	What people seem to think about satellites getting bad reception is wrong. Just because you have a sat dish on your property does not mean that weather will interupt your service. It will have to be a VERY BAD storm. I'm talking the most Dense of dense. Do you know how the local cable company gets their programming? YEP, that;s right. SATELLITES!!!!! lol    If you look at stats, you'll notice that cable companies lose service more than DTV does
hWc65sEtaa	If they are purchased ringtones, they are locked to that phone and you won't be able to send them to the new phone.
5Wi9Tq4Raa	I haven't used a Samsung for ages, but in the Messages you should have settings and/or blocked numbers. Here should be the list of numbers your phone is filtering.  Highlight the number and press one of the softkeys to bring up a menu. One of the options here should be allow or unblock.    Although a bit vague should be enough to get you looking in the correct direction.|`|Vd7UrgHzaa	Get the customer assistance phone number for your provider - you'll be put on hold for ages but eventually you'll get to speak to someone who can get your phone unblocked.
EYoyBdjpaa	call your provider's 1-800 line and confirm your account etc. and they'll unlock it for you.|`|gIn29wqoaa	you will have to speak to your operator and they will probably have to get your phone sent away to get it unlocked.
fwnqB0dTaa	YOU CAN'T
T87pwfi4aa	Yep.  On most phones companies charge you for GPS   and everything else!  My older brother had it.  And he liked it.  Then he got a car one so he doesnt have it anymore.  :]|`|Jvdg74UYaa	I believe they do. Mostly every phone company does. A couple of my friends who have At&t have that phone in Blue..I would say its pretty good. I sometimes use to it and text a couple of my friends while were hanging out. I like the camera. I dont really like the Keyboard tho since its very small. But I do like the phone.
t90SMugDaa	Yes, but right now you have to use one of a few apps to do so. One is called S&K Sync - it just transfers files from your G1 to a place on your PC - and/or vice-versa.
d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	Unfortunately, you've learned the same hard lesson I did.  5 days after purchasing my big beautiful 52" LCD, my kid threw a pacifier at it and knocked out a small area of pixels, which grew to about the size of a pencil eraser.    I was lucky in that my retailer took mercy on me and let me return it and exchange it for a plasma, which have much more durable screens.    I would call the manufacturer and talk to them about what you can expect in the way of a repair bill.|`|AinG1PCBaa	Unfortunately, replacement screens cost more than the T.V. in the first place. I work at a tv repair shop and I have seen first hand how expensive it can be. My advise is to get a new tv and purchase an extended warranty. It will not cover a busted screen BUT it will pay for itself the first time something else goes wrong...and trust me it will!!!!|`|27bc701367843ae2833d9bcda8c0f992aa	Sigh...  It's more cost affective to replace it.    Same thing happened to my Laptop..|`|2c3rcQRbaa	Wii remote got tossed into it, eh?    Call a TV repair shop and ask if it is possible to fix.  My guess is that it is if you want to pay a ton of money to do so.  But it would be less expensive than buying a new TV.
6jbZAPyzaa	i think the 2nd..because you are going to have to buy a upgraded for the 1st gen if you want to put games or APPS..which cost 10 dollars..and the 2nd gen has speakers so its funner to use :D|`|YxpfbQbSaa	The first generation does not have an external speaker and the second does. Not that much difference any were else. The best is a 16 gig, and the 1st and 2nd generation should be based on your needs.

KLL0Acrwaa	For Canon point and shoot cameras, look for the letters "IS" after the name (example:  Canon A590 IS).    But when it comes to SLRs, only some cameras, like those from Pentax and Sony have IS built into the body.  For Nikon and Canon SLRs (single lens reflex), the image stabilization is built into the lens, if the lens has it (designated VR for Nikon and IS for Canon).    SLRs are the interchangeable lens cameras, which are much larger than point and shoots.  It sounds to me more like your friend is looking for a point and shoot camera.  If that's the case, I would in fact recommend Canon point and shoots and I consider the Canon A590 IS to be a great value at this time.|`|nU5UqACUaa	Sony DSLR's have built in Image Stabilizer called Steady Shot. Some Pentax models might have it too.|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	The digital SLRS either have the image stabilizer on camera body or its lens. So its possible to buy camera body that wasn't designed to have image stabilizer, but you can bet the lens has it.|`|38c6373fd3b19e3800899c623919c0e0aa	Only if the camera's name ends, or begins with, IS.|`|hl9nqKQ2aa	Not all manufacturer's have them they are specific to each model/make/price.  Dont listen to what was previously said as i believe it is canon that use the IS in the model codes, while as  Sony for instance have Slr's like the A100 that has an IS built inside but does not state it in the model code itself

pmSHKJSPaa	Hi   I assume you know how to use explorer if you are using MS XP or Vista   After you plug the camera or the memory card into your computer you could look at your camera by going to "my computer" and finding the device on the list of devices in your computer. The camera should be there by name  or it will have taken on a "drive letter" ....just like your hard drive (s) have letters. You can then go into that drive "D" "E" or some letter and move them or copy them to your computer or any other device. To get into explorer right click on start and go to explorer. You can anything you want once you get it into explorer.

O8qdCBzLaa	Yes, you can use more than one set of wireless headphones for the same TV, provided they are either operating at different frequencies or they have a programmable transmitter/receiver pair.    Many wireless devices have dual in-line position (DIP) switches that allow you to match a particular transmitter/receiver pair to work with each other. A DIP switch has a number of little miniature switches (like 4 or 8) in line in one package.     You then set the DIP switches in the transmitter to a certain pattern (like up-down-up-up-down-up-down-down). And, you set the DIP switches in the receiver to the same pattern. Unless additional devices have the same DIP switch pattern, they will not cause interference with this transmitter/receiver pair.    Sennheiser headphones are outstanding. What's nice about Sennheisers too is that they advertise on their website that they have spare parts for every model of headphones they have ever made. So, it's easy to get spare parts and use your same headphones virtually forever.|`|OueLHhNgaa	Yes you can use more than one headphones, go get headphone Spliter you can check with any musical instrument store or Radio shack.|`|d1fee41232bb81bff138e747ce6187bdaa	The most popular brand is TVears. They have a dual set of headphones available on one model.    My parents are older and need the volume up and they have treadmill in the family room so they can't hear the normal TV volume. They got a set of these and it works great for about $100.    TVEARS.com
UAYzLyN4aa	Not without an air conditioner or similar.     A fan is good for moving heat around (and that's good for not allowing heat to accumulate near the TV, and so heat it unnecessarily) , and by blowing air across your skin it makes you feel cooler, but it doesn't get really get rid of heat.     If the TV uses, let's say, 150 watts, then it is going to put out about as much heat as a 150 watt electric heater, or a 150 watt light bulb. Even the energy emitted as light (both by the TV and the light bulb) gets turned into heat when the light is absorbed elsewhere.     The only way to really get rid of the heat is with something like an air conditioner to "pump" the heat outside.     The cheaper alternative is to use a fan to bring cooler air in from someplace else and move the warmer air in the room out.  But in summer it's tough to find "cooler air from someplace else."|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	Point a fan at where the TV is hot.  The air will help wick away the excess heat.    Of course, that doesn't really solve your problem in that the heat is still inside your room.    It's odd that the screen is extremely hot.  I've had tubes, plasmas and LCDs, and none of the screens ever got more then warm.  Now my plasma does have a lot of heat coming out the top back where the vents are.  It makes a nice extra heater for the room in the winter.

On screen it will say something has been plugged in, and then click to look at the PS3's files, and open and save them. I'm not sure how much this cord is, but it is not free, so just go with the emailing version.|`|mH26I4f2aa	i had the same problem.

There is nothing like it on the web today    and you can make animations and graphics            or     follow these steps and you can have any of their millions of ringtones sent      -step 1-  after you sign up, make sure you login      -step 2-  go to the Ventones home page and click on the free Mosquito Ringtone  link. That one will also take you to the "free ringtone preview page" and it will show   the Send to Phone button. Don't click on the Send To Phone button though!    -step 3-  Next open the Ventones site in a new browser window but leave the first   one open as well. Search for the ringtone that you want   (from their free ringtone page ) and click on it.   That will take you to their "free ringtone preview page"   which will NOT have a send to phone button    -step 4-  now go back to the first Ventones window (the one with the mosquito ringtone)  and  click on the send to phone button.    It will send you the ringtone you opened in the 2nd ventones window.   Sounds complex but it works every time for me|`|KNYF1hnhaa	Unfortunately you can not legally copy a ring tone from iTunes to any other phone other than the iPhone.

M9YNvbraaa	the i-phone is normally locked to the at-t network so if your friend bought if rom at&t you should be okay.

If your friend bought it originally from at&t, you should be okay, but in any event i would either check with at&t customer service or have customer service check with their tech department.  since at&t is the only licensed carrier in the united states to provide service to the i-phone you should be okay -if your friend got it from them in the first place- if not then you may have problems.  HOw e well do you know this friend, can you be sure he is selling you a functional 3G [product- not one that has been reported lost stolen, or even a 2 G model?

lkqjJisaaa	Yor friends are wrong.  The D90 is able to use all Nikon AF lenses, AF-S lenses, and even third-party lenses from Sigma, Tamron, and Tokina.  U can even use really old Nikon manual focus lenses, for manually focusing although they will not meter.    By contrast, the Canons cannot accept their old manual focus lenses because their mounts R completely different. Bet yor friends didn't know that.    Yor friends should do more research.  U should have no regrets with your choice.    EDIT:  David M is mistaken to suggest a D60--it won't AF with non AF-S lenses.  Bad advice on his part.  Stick with the D90.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	i like canon. veteran of 35mm. changed over 5 years ago after making a lot of mistakes, like getting an olympus e500, changed to canon. the rebel xs is getting the best reviews. check it out on dpreview.com|`|pZGLhV2Waa	No Nikon has even more available lenses than Canon. Nikon's can you use virtually all Nikkor lenses from 1959 on while Canon from 1987 on. For their current new line up they are about the same. The Nikon D90 is a great camera but unless you really want the video feature I think you would be better served with either a D40 or D60. The camera body you use will make absolutely no difference in the quality of the photos it takes. The biggest determiner of image quality is the lens you use. So it is better to buy a cheaper camera body and invest your money in good quality lenses. Whichever camera you choose will be outdated in a couple of years. Your lenses will last a lifetime. For the cost of the D90 you could get a D40 with kit lens plus a very good telephoto lens.    If this is your first DSLR you wont appreciate any of the differences in the D90 if you leave it in the auto modes. Unless you can competently use the camera on manual the extra features will be of no use to you anyways.|`|AbRfd29Haa	They both have very complete lines of lenses.     Back in 1987, Canon dumped their old mechanical lens system entirely for a new electronically managed lens system, called EOS. Every Canon SLR since then has used these electronic lenses, including all digitals. They have made electronic lenses for longer than Nikon has, so there are more full-featured lenses for the EOS system.     However, Nikon has managed to maintain a fairly reasonable level of compatibility with every lens they've made since 1959, when they introduced the Nikon F (at the time, like Canon, they made interchangeble-lens rangefinder cameras, though based on their own lens mount, while Canon used Leica's screw mount, except for their fairly special f0.85 normal lens.. but I digress). The older lenses needed mechanical coupling to indicate aperature to the camera, which the modern camera can't couple to, and of course, they had no autofocus back then, but the lens mount is the same. So while there are fewer lenses with full electronic control for the Nikon, there are more that fill directly fit.     Neither line will give you a problem. If you're concerned, check out the current offerings, look at eBay, etc. and see what's available. Between the two of them, Canon and Nikon hold about 90% of the SLR market.. they are that good, and IMHO the only real choice for serious SLR photography (but give Sony a few more years... they're new to SLRs, but one of the Big Four in video cameras). You aren't going to buy every lens, so the total number doesn't really matter... the difference between 60+ current-model Canons and 45-or-so current model Nikons isn't significant (I mean, how many different 70mm-200mm zooms are you planning to buy... Canon offers four, as well as two 70-300mm and two 75-300mm lenses -- and those are just the current ones).|`|nU5UqACUaa	What ever the kind of pictures you do, you need 4 lenses to fill all you needs. Nikon, Tokina, Sigma and Tamron have them. And, there is no lens more in the Canon selection then in the one from Nikon.  Canon has 180 lenses to choose among but almost 60% of them perform crappy on digital. The same at Nikon. All lenses that fit must not do a good job and it's up to you to find out if you buy elder lenses.|`|ByS1Ye8raa	canons lenses fit all their cameras (except for their weird new rebel sized lenses) so you can upgrade bodies and keep lenses|`|yhoHiONpaa	From what I've read about Nikon, they can be somewhat limited. Nikon has about 60 different lens to choose from. Sigma and Tamron have plenty of discount lens to choose from, but if I were to go with the Nikon SLR's I'd choose a Nikon lenses to go with it.    Steve    EDIT: I'm a canon guy anyway.|`|11203bd3a8dfc0f691ecda1122ff3c2eaa	Hi there, Nikon lens are not too much to choose, about 45 to 70 types only.

If u get a camera body and 2 or 3 lens (Nikon or 3 party) that's can be US$2500 and above. try to search for Sigma,Tamron n Tokina lens and u will know what am i talking about.    After considering those price, i prefer Canon dSLR. Body only, same std of Mega Pixes, Canon dSLR body price will be 10%-20% cheaper. Why pay more ??    Check out the price of a 3rd party lens for both Canon n Nikon. Eg.: Tamron lens 55-200 mm, about US$30 different. That's US$30 for a lens, how about 3 different types of lens ??
3r8IH2czaa	It's the evenly distributed direct heat that is applied to the pad that activates it when you touch it. It's the same with older touch screens too (like the ones on ATMs).you can test this out by holding your hand in a jar of ice water for a while then if you try to use the touchpad and it won't work (just dry your hand before). Some also say that, they work by the electrical capacitance between your hand and the pad at the point of contact.

mKzJgOvxaa	Tough question. I'm a 31 year old gamer that has pretty much owned every console to come out. I got my first console when I was little being an Atari which was quickly followed by intellivision (I think it might have been called Collico Vision in the states. I'm from Aus). Next one I got was a Vic 20 followed by a C64 then I started on the Nintendo systems (never owned a Sega though so), followed by the PS. I own every console from the current crop and had everyone from the last gen.    My criteria for judging was what console gave me the biggest wow factor when I first played it. The current crop are very low on my list as there wasn't that massive evolutionary leap from the previous gen to this one other than the Wii's (and to a lesser extent the PS3) motion sensor gaming. There are 2 really big wow moments I remember. The first was for a racing game I had on the c64 where the game started off with a voice counting down from 3 to go. This was the first time I had ever heard a voice in a computer game and was absolutely amazed by it (seems crazy now but that was amazing at the time). The biggest moment though was my ps one. I played a star wars game called Rebel Assault that started off just like a star wars movie. It was just a cutscene and the in game graphics are crappy by today's standards but I couldn't believe my eyes at the time.     The PS was able to do so much more than any other console before it and really accelerated gaming to where we are today. So many people I know call the current crop of consoles "3rd Generation" which really shows how influential the ps one was as many feel that all that came before it weren't that significant. I don't think like that but I do think the leap forward by the PS was by far the biggest that any console has ever taken and for that reason, it gets my vote as the best!!|`|ayLYuIvOaa	nintendos are mostly for all ages  while other might be for core gamers  also that they say nintendo tends to break or have problem less than other console|`|9AR6B4ELaa	XBOX 360 ROCKZ!!! better graphics than the ps3,, cheaper console and games and more selection of games.|`|4NE4kPGpaa	I personally think XBox is the best.

It had online play, a browser, great graphics... if the system didn't break from being looked at funny it would have lasted much much longer then the ps2|`|Xxviy63Paa	The best would have to be the ps3, simply because it's the first one since the very first ones that exceeds pc's, and has stolen much of the market away from it. Also because higher-tech is better, and the ps3 is of course the highest-tech yet.    The second best would be Intellivision. It's ignored usually because it had to compete with the legendary Atari 2600, but it had not only better graphics than Atari, but a better controller too. In fact its controller was a precursor to the d-pad adopted by Nintendo. At the time, though, people didn't really like it so much, all they knew was joysticks because the first real video games were in arcades.    Speaking of arcades, I think arcade games should count as consoles, since they aren't pc's and because single-game consoles sold in stores count too. The best arcade games were:     Discs of Tron  Galaga  Hard Drivin' (later changed to Race Drivin') first force-feedback 3d-accelerated driving game.    The Nintendo consoles, I wouldn't give an award for any of them. Every one of them has been designed for kids and casual players, that's how they broke into the market. At the end of the 1980's, Commodore had singlehandedly bankrupted the entire console industry, even Atari, and IBM pc's were just getting into the game with good VGA cards, and later, hardware video acceleration. This wasn't something Nintendo could compete with, and they didn't try, they took the low road instead: 2d platforms, Mario-this, Zelda that. Some legendary games, maybe, but not a great platform.    Finally the playstation 2 which dominated its generation like no other besides Commodore 64. C64 was nominally a computer but everyone used it for games, and the ps3 is a better computer than C64, so there it is, it's a console. The ps2 somehow managed to take some average processors and design a brutally efficient 3d gaming machine around it. It doesn't have a lot of memory, its video card has only 32mb of gddram, and its cpu runs at an ancient 300mhz. But the 128-bit bus size and vector algebra co-processors and other hardware make it run 3d games so efficiently that its still used more than twice as much as any other platform, including pc's. Considering it's almost 10 years old, that's an incredible record of success, particularly for a game machine. It's supposed to be obsolete, but it's still number one.    That last consideration gets ps2 the grand prize for best of all time, and ps3 is best currently. C64 is best for hackers, and Intellivision most original.

VMVW3E7Aaa	People so often ask: "Which one is a good camera to buy?"  Here is my 10 cents on the subject:    Point & Shoot cameras are wonderfully handy because of their small size.  When light conditions are ideal, they even take really nice photos - all of them do.    However, they all DO have limitations - they don't do very well in low light situations  (i.e. noisy photos, hard to avoid blur, etc). The little onboard flash is very harsh at close range, and doesn't reach very far.  Many of them have no manual functions, so you are limited to only very basic photos, you can't compensate for unusual situations, or do many fun "tricks" and special effects.  P&S's  also suffer from  frustrating shutterlag and many of them chew through batteries rather quickly.    However, if you're ok with all those limitations, then go ahead and pick one, most of them (the same type and same price range) are rather similar. Personally I would pick either a Canon or a Nikon, and would certainly stay away from Kodak.     A higher end P&S will give you more manual options and better quality.  Many of those even give you the option of adding a proper flash (which makes a big difference to your flash photos).    Don't worry too much about megapixels. there is a limit to how many pixels you can squash into a tiny P&S sensor before you actually LOSE quality rather than gain it.  Don't worry about digital zoom, in fact, don't EVER use it. It simply crops away pixels , i.e. destroys information. The only real zoom is optical.    Decide which features are important to you, and look for cameras that have that feature.   Then go compare a few models on www.dpreview.com  .      The very best thing you can do for your success is to borrow some books and learn about basic photography.  A bit of knowledge will make a much bigger difference to your photos than your choice of P&S camera can.    For what it's worth - if I was in the market for a P&S camera right now, my choice would be a Canon Powershot  SX10 IS http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...|`|7SXA5dhDaa	You didn't limit your question with price.  Digital SLR's take the best pictures and open up the whole world of photography to you.  The Nikon D90 also takes HD video.
WP5dSiCmaa	NEVER buy the Best Buy 'service plan'. Total waste.|`|HwxBL1B1aa	yes buy it totally worth it. think about it this way the tv doent work and you have to get a brand new one go and pay $550 for another one when you already have paid $70 for it youll get another one for $70 dollars or yours repaired for that price soo just get it so i can sleep soundly tonight :)|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well yes have fun.|`|Nv3eQenUaa	TV are pretty much solid state and pretty reliable.   Samsung is among the most reliable brands.   I would skip the warranty.    If Best Buy is willing to be that the TV will be problem free over the next four years, I would be willing to take that risk also.   Save your money.|`|ZA6QVbsHaa	Yes its always good to get this for high dollar items and by getting the warranty from Bast Buy if some thing goes wrong you can take it back to them and let them deal shipping...|`|sER6UGMWaa	Why wouldnt you get it??  Is there any logical reason not to get it?  This is newer technology...think back like 4 years ago how much do you think that television would of cost... now your getting it alot cheaper becuase there mass producing them so there not spending alot of time making them... also there filled with mother boards, circuit boards and things like that. Anything is bound to go wrong at any time..     and its not a warranty....   warranty- is what the manufacter would offer on a product that only covers defect that they caused during the making of the television meaning if something was installed wrong then they will cover it...     Best Buys Service plan- goes above and beyond the manufacter by covering power surges, over heats, normal wear n tear, parts and labor for 4 year and its in home...     The way i look at is its BETTER TO HAVE IT AND NOT NEED IT THAN TO NEED IT AND NOT HAVE IT|`|pPBeOpgRaa	Well since it's not plasma then I wouldn't but if you're worried that something might happen with it then be safe and get it. Always better to be safe then sorry.|`|Ccy7RslDaa	Definitely that would be the greatest thing to do specially if you want your tv to last long.

Ur6H8gwkaa	Lithium ion batteries do not suffer from 'memory effect' like other types of rechargables. It's one of the key advantages of the technology. They are also very light and pack more power for the given weight than just about everything out there.

It does not require a data plan so you can save money on it unlike the G1 which i think its expensive. Also, the camera is a 5MP which takes pictures very good.
LzSj90pbaa	Theres a guy on ebay that will fix the screen. its $125.   unless its the lcd, then you might as well buy a new phone because its going to be cheaper.|`|48xxYQsaaa	u could tell them that it broke.  perhaps you might be able to trade it in for a new one.|`|peMJ5cd7aa	well you might consider getting a new iphone because it would cost about 200- 250 to get it replace...

I currently use the Voyager. I actually plan to upgrade to the Dare or the Storm. The voyager is a pretty good phone. But the touch screen response, i've heard, is better on the dare than the voyager.  Sometimes mine doesn't want to do what i tell it. Ofcourse theres always going to be some type of glitch or problem with technology in general but, you know, that's life. i am a really big txt person so i love love the keyboard, but on the other hand i've always had a "fetish", i guess you could call it, for touch screen technology. its just so cool. lol. in all truthfullness i'll say they are both great phones but um...  i suppose it really depends on your preference: neat technology or easy keyboard.|`|k32ktOLmaa	i have the LG Dare... its sorta like the iphone but with LESS features..     the good thing tho, is that the battery outlasts the iphone by a mile...    i charge mine every 2 to 3 days... my friends with iphone charges once per day...     but yeah i have no complaints against LG dare so far!! GET IT|`|vZdiZzBYaa	I just ordered the LG Voyager because i love the keyboard and i also love the touch screen.  I am not too familiar with either phone but in my opinion the Voyager is a better deal and your getting your money`s worth with that phone.

O8qdCBzLaa	The only thing I would be concerned about is someone buying the cabinets and then putting a poorly balanced set of drivers and cross-over in them. Then, no matter the quality and performance of the enclosures, they would still end up with a set of mediocre to poor speakers.    I would recommend that you experiment with different sets of drivers and cross-overs, and then either recommend a specific set of electronics or include them with the enclosures. That way, you can advertise that your enclosures have been fine-tuned to a specific set of drivers and cross-overs, which is why you think your enclosures are superior to others on the market.    You could also then use the same basic enclosure design with sets of drivers of different quality. That would allow you to offer a budget, mid-range, and high quality line of speakers.    BTW - back in about 1982, my dad gave me his copy of How to Build Speaker Enclosures and I decided I wanted to try making my own based on the design principles in the book. I built a pair of enclosures out of 3/4-inch plywood that I basically designed after the Klipsch Hereseys, except I made a tuned port enclosure instead of an infinite baffle. I put in 12-inch Pyle Driver woofers, Pyle 3x9 horn midranges, and Pyle 2x6 inch horn tweeters. I don't remember the brand of cross-over. But, those things totally rocked (I drove them with a Kenwood KA7900 integrated amp). I've had to replace the woofers a couple of times, because of degradation to the foam ring around the edges of the woofer cones. But, they're the best speakers I've ever owned. And, they cost about $400 in parts.|`|kHwjvZKgaa	I think speaker enclosures would be a great business. Just make sure you do it right. With proper bracing, 3/4 Inch birch ply and good acoustical treatment for the driver resonances.     Sorry to burst the other poster's bubble, but speakers boxes aren't complex. They are simple. Especially if well built and fitted with the right drivers. And they will simply blow away most speakers at the same price.      Subwoofers is the area where this shows up the most though.    I would consider actually consider buying them. If I liked the response.|`|f56d5c8e603ceda9ee44fa6104637c4caa	Its a novel idea, but anyone who is looking for quality cabinets is also looking for sound quality at the same time.  Many sound companies such as McIntosh, Definitive Technology, and Polk spend years developing cabinets based on sound reproduction of the drivers.  Even if you build a better cabinet quality wise, there is no testing of the cabinets acoustically (dimensions of cabinet, port vs no port, port size / location, etc etc.)    I really do like the idea, but drivers and cabinets are designed around each other. I know that if I had the access to a quality shop like that, the thought of doing what you want to do would cross my mind as well.    Sorry :-(

zpmXGZsCaa	The RadioShack Concertmate would have been a great synth for $100.  Your mom likely wanted to get you something new, but unfortunately, $80 at Target doesn't get beyond a home keyboard.      The Concertmate is a double oscillator analog synth with a 24db filter - and made by Moog as you know.  Not bad for Radio Shack!      Some alternatives are:     1.  Novation BassStation Keyboard is a good little analog synth.  (I have one.) Unfortunately, they only made it for one year, so they're somewhat scarce (it evolved into the BassStation Rack the following year.)  I recently saw one listed on Denver's Craigslist, so you might start there.  http://www.vintagesynth.com/novation/nov...    2. & 3. Dave Smith Instruments (DSI) MoPho ($400) or Evolver ($600)  These are both modules and need to be connected to another keyboard (your mom's present if it has MIDI Out,) or a MIDI controller.  The Evolver is an extremely cool synth.  I see them sell used for around $400.     4. Novation BassStation Rack - as above but in module form.  Might be easier to come by than the keyboard version.  There is also a Super BassStation Rack that incorporates a rhythm section.     All four of the above are true analog, double oscillator, and monophonic - meaning only one note can be played at a time.          Another good synth is the Alesis Micron.  It isn't analog, but analog modeling, also called virtual analog (VA.)  This is a digitally generated waveform, although it is modeled after analog oscillators. The Micron is a great sounding synth and costs $400 new.     And there's the Novation XioSynth.  It's also a VA and doubles as a midi controller.  Unfortunately, I've never gotten my hands on one.  Perhaps some one's put up a vid on YouTube.

Download at  http://www.mp3dvdsoft.com/ipodpctransfer...  GOOD LUCK!|`|uyj52zs3aa	try using the ipod as a hard drive (i think you can do this with tthe nano)..if you cant see it on the windows explorer windows ..go to folder options and have it reveal all hidden folders.....know that for a touch you cant do taht unless you have the touch jailbroken and have open ssh and winscp|`|ARYLg8ghaa	ipod can only sync with one computer itunes. itune blocks this function since itune is the tool with one way to transfer files from itune to ipod. you must utilize other tools to achieve that. There're couple of tools for transferring the files between ipod and computer (for backup)depends on your demands, e.g transfer only songs/videos, transfer photos etc. You can have a look of below review site, hope it useful.
QOlk2mFeaa	They will txt u wen its been activated. it shud b soon, mine came on the same day tho|`|5e564f59771ed76baf9cdea62df489eeaa	that happened to me with at&t  i thought unlimited media net started immediately and it did not so i had overage i now know anything you add or get with your plan ask when it starts.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Should begin immediately unless you made other arrangements when you took out the contract.
yqy5xfSbaa	i dont think so
AA11383464	welcome to iTunes hell  do yourself a favor and don't let iTunes to EVER automatically download a damn thing.  always download manually and you'll never lose your library again
AA11620172	Get Tap Tap Revenge on the app store, it's free. Tap tap revolution was only for 1.1.1-1.1.4.|`|rQf9uwsgaa	Stick with revenge. You can add a rockband or guitar hero theme from cydia if you want.

8JNZ8Il0aa	You cannot open a zip archive in WMP. just unzip it ( i think by just clicking on it since I am on a mac I don't have windows) and then play what is inside of it.
4793dc3cd4fd80d46ddf53b18e344fabaa	iTunes.|`|mpmR0s9Waa	plug it in the show it whos boss
AA11383464	1) download it from iTunes store  2) put your CDs in the computer and transfer that way  the iPod choice depends on your needs...if you *remember* more than 15 years of music and have more than 50 CDS, get the big sucker--  if you are under 25, a 4 or 8 gb is enough.  the nano is fine, the touch is GREAT|`|pwmfQHjAaa	You have to have itunes is the first thing. I have music elsewhere in my computer that isn't a part of itunes. I just plugged my ipod in my computer and then dragged the music into itunes and onto the ipod.    I really like the ipod touch. I have one and it is a miracle worker. Haha.|`|ecf00daa21f02ddc8cca44864655d066aa	You have to use iTunes and I think the iPod classic is much better but that's just because I have a lot of movies and music in my library. Plus the games for the classic are much better than the ones for the touch.
B0vUA0NPaa	Heck yes, I have an iPhone and love it, and switched over from Verizon, At&t has far superior coverage, and I wouldn't trade my iphone for anything....completely worth it..
TJfs8yfsaa	Never thats why im getting it..but you can buy the lg verision at full pop like 599|`|VMH0mm3maa	I feel they will get it in the future
