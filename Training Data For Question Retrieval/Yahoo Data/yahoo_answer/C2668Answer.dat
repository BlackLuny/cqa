OA7cPgGNaa	The ideal answer to this question should be ONE and only one. A dog should be placed into a home and they should remain in that home. A dog is not disposable, same with all animals. They are not something you buy for your little Johnny because on his 5th birthday he begged for a dog and a week later he loses interest.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, I think the average is around 2. A person buys a puppy, realizes its too much for them, didn't research the breed, moved, joined army, had a baby, foreclosure, death, etc. and re-homes or dumps at a shelter.<br>  <br>  I am in animal rescue and founded my own rescue and I think I have heard every single sob story. My responses to them are (blunt):<br>  >> Allergies: Me too. I own 7 dogs, 4 cats, 3 horses, and work with sheep and 10-15 fosters daily. Tell me about it.<br>  >> Moving: Stressful, isn't it? I've moved to 3 different locations in my past 15 years of training. I've finally found my perfect place. But I kept all my animals AND children!<br>  >> New baby: Aren't kids wonderful? I have two boys. One is 5 and one is 3. I home-school my 3 year old. They love helping me train the dogs, clean out the fosters, exercise them, ride the horses, etc. Builds character.<br>  >> Don't have time: Are you kidding me, then why did you get a pet? Get a pet sitter to let your dog out, wake up 20 minutes earlier. Go to bed 20 minutes later. <br>  <br>  And there are so more I can't even think of right now. Granted I realize sh*t happens, but deal with it if possible. Would you re-home your kids if it pooped on the floor,  or ate something it shouldn't? Grows up and is no longer cute? Talks back and has no house manners?<br>  <br>  I realize with the economy with the way it is, some have no choice and my heart goes out to them. It is a horrible, unplanned thing to deal with. <br>  <br>  =) Sorry...this turned into a rant!<br>  <br>  My answer is 2. Final answer.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Amazingly sad you have to even ask- huh?  Our dog is like part of the family, and could not go away for any reason!!!  You mention the older dog being given up, how sad.  I do not know how you can stand to work at a shelter for reasons like that one!  Good for you fo being able to help the furry friends of the world!|`|R4gWNdvgaa	i feel so bad for the average american god because they should only have 1 home!!|`|CtYqMs5Paa	Ideally one...but realistically people do get dogs on whims and dump them for reasons that are unacceptable in many cases.  3 of my dogs have had the same home since they were puppies...but my other 3, 2 had only 1 previous owner, the other one had 2 previous owners before coming to my family.  But I don't know if there is a real way to statistically say that the average is "this"...since I know of dogs that started in one family, were given to a friend/family member for one reason or another, then given up on and dumped but the shelter may not know about the home before the owner dropping the pet off.|`|nYv65TlEaa	even though there are so many dogs in shelters,there are 95% who have only been in 2 homes,breeders and family homes,so 2 homes total of 99% 0f dogs,some are strays who have puppies,I'll say that's 1%,but i do thinks it way less then 1% for strays|`|a1343f058c3dec40fe918611b8bc0ceaaa	mine have only been with me so one in my case|`|AA12128656	i had a dog with some kind of nervous problem who had gone through 7.<br>  all my other ones were raised at home, so one.<br>  oh but i took a pup back from a family so he's had 2.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Hopefully most dogs only go through one home. My foster (soon to be mine) will be on his 2nd, and should be his last.<br>  Both of my parrots have been in 2 homes.<br>  <br>  I have moved my whole crew twice and hopefully I will never move again
NJKzRNHkaa	Im a vet in training and i've seen these types before.<br>  Give ur pup some cooked rice cause thats what calms the stomach and make it stop pooping.Give her alot and i mean ALOT of water too.This can also help calm the stomach.If u take my advice ur dog should be fine in a few minutes or maybe even a few hours.<br>  No vet is required unless she still is after a few hours or she is doing this alot.I hope this helps!|`|ISLflp54aa	Definitely take her to the Vet.  Blood in the stools is never a good thing, and shouldn't be ignored.<br>  <br>  Hope she is ok!|`|a1343f058c3dec40fe918611b8bc0ceaaa	take her to the VET|`|58AWfvrMaa	There could be many reasons for this.  Most dogs stay in heat up to 2 months (large or small breed?).  She could have also gotten ahold of something that is cutting her insides.  The same thing happened to my dog (a lab).  I took her to the vet and they told me to give her a piece of bread with 2 tablespoons of Pepto or Mylanta on it (less for smaller dog).  It will help settle her stomach.  You chould also feed her softer, more simple food.  Try boiling rice with chicken broth until you notice she is no longer vomitting or beeding.|`|euwbbibZaa	Take him to the vet, some dogs will act fine until they cant deal with whatever is hurting them and you dont want to wait till the last minute. My dog acted normal until one morning he didnt want to get up I had to really coax him to get out of bed and then when I came home from work he could not walk any more. He had prostate cancer but he acted and ate normally the whole time.|`|mRevWUxlaa	If she doesn't have all of her shots..... or isn't U.T.D. you could be facing a problem. Puppies can die from parvo. But you mentioned she has just come out of heat. She could have something lodged in her intestines. take her to a vet immediatly and have her examined.... she may need an X-ray.What ever it is, It probobly won't go away and you could loose her.|`|VvPaJHW9aa	Glad you think that blood in the poop is "nothing major".<br>  Speechless!!!!|`|4TOpkZ7Gaa	You need to get her to the vet for some tests. Don't wait.|`|AA11154106	ummm.....go to the vet<br>  <br>  <br>  DUH!
ECCoeifyaa	one girl who does not even own horses tried to tell me that they don't have a forelock, and she wouldn't believe when i tried to explain to her that they DO have hair between their ears there even though i own two of my own horses =)<br>  sorry to hear ur having a bad week, feel better!  go for a ride, maybe :-)|`|034f5753f9ad6567e841eda4b3bd8210aa	I've heard a lot of stupid things in my years around horses.  My favorites are:<br>  <br>    A black hoof is stronger than a white hoof.<br>    The chestnuts on a horse's laegs are to keep the legs together while it's being born. <br>    "I want to buy my 7 year old daughter a yearling so they can learn together and grow up together"  (not only is that stupid, it's dangerous)<br>    Quarter horses can't jump.<br>    Arabians can't run barrels or poles.<br>    All Arabians are hot headed.<br>    All quarter horses and Paints are calm and lazy<br>    A pony is a baby horse<br>    <br>  I could go on and on for a while.  These are the ones I hear the most though.|`|KiGnomhZaa	My next door neighbor is 6 and he came out to the stables with a sausage and said "Does lucy like sausages?" And i said "no, horses don't eat sausages" then he asked me if Lucy would eat a sausage if he ate grass so i said "I don't know, eat some grass and see if she'll take it." Anyway i left him too it and he came back to me later and said "I quite like grass, I think i want to be a horse when i grow up. I don't think Lucy wants to be a human when she grows up because she didn't eat the sausage."<br>  <br>  It made me laugh anyway. lol|`|n2dUmfcQaa	i was talking to this man! he said yeah my dad owns a stallion and i ask if his father stud him out. he gos no he keeps him in a barn. i go o ok, then i asked well is it a filly or a mare, just to see if he new at all what he was talking about, he go a filly that races on the track! lol so i go well whats the breed, jumper or hunter, he said jumper and then i laughed because i counldn't hold it in any longer!<br>  <br>    i know tons about horses, i have 35 horses at my barn right now that board, and 5 of my own!|`|zywQwkwcaa	Ohh I have a goooood one!<br>  So for my birthday I was going to go on a nice trail ride with my two closest friends and my stepdad. None of them have any horse excperience really so it was new and exciting for them.<br>  One of my friend's was talking to her mom about it and her mom said,"Alright, so if the horse freaks out and starts running really fast just jump off and roll."<br>  HAHHHAHA.<br>  I'd like to see someone try that without hurting themselves. There's no way you could do that and be able to do a nice roll once you hit the ground and then just hop to your feet. It was so funny because that's defidently NOT what you should do. You should stay on the horse and try and stop it. I bet you would end up getting more hurt jumping off a galloping horse then staying on it.<br>  ahhhhh. yeah.(:|`|BI1GbIZUaa	I teach at a hunter/jumper barn. We have a super fat paint pony that is a saint. She's perfect for beginners, never spooks or doesn't anything bad. Her name is feathers, her nickname is fat feathers. She gets some grain and hay. We put her on a diet (no grain) and she got so grouchy and started dragging kids into the feed room. We figured it was better to have a pudgy pony that's happy then a pissy pony that's slightly skinnier. Multiple times I have had kids come up to me and ask when she's having her baby. It cracks me up every time.|`|KqjVgJdSaa	Well, haha i was leading this girl around on a pony and she turned around and looked at the back of the horse and  said, "Look! It's wagging its tail, it must be happy!" And same my dad did this once there was a pony in the pasture and some other horses and he said "What a cute baby" haha I was like that's a full grown pony. I don't think he even knew pony's existed! =D|`|WlCvwBFLaa	Okay so in the fall my barn holds a big day full of pony rides and apple picking and we call it the Fall Fest....so me and some girls from the barn were giving pony rides, and there was a plumper child so we brought out the draft horse.(Note: We had NOT used the horse all day he was just kind of stubborn and didn't want to leave his hay) So we finally got him out there by giving him little bits of hay, and when we got him out there, a lady about 65yrs of age comes out furious with us and starts screaming,"That horses needs a brake you should go give him and let him rest I want my child off that horse and on a different horse NOW!!" We'll because we only had ponies for pony rides I had to explain to the lady that this was his first ride of the day and that we can't use any other horses because her child was over the wieght limit...And here is the best part then threatened to call Animal Control because we put her fat kid on to small of horse.|`|MxIQkMUxaa	Just today my friend tried to convince me that Eventing was a combination of Western and English.<br>  Her logic was that a trainer by her said it was, so it must be true. Oh and that since she lives in South Carolina, it's something different than it is here in Michigan. <br>  I've been eventing for 6 years. I nearly died laughing.|`|780c50eb467560c6248a0ca6f53da60caa	Ahhahahah, I live in the north. A non-horsie person once told me that I cant ride horses in the winter because if they walk on ice their hooves will crack. Uhh ok??? My god. While I'm at it Ill be sure not to walk on that so called concrete too. Because if ice will crack their hooves I should probably stay off that too. LOL|`|wa2Am5m2aa	you would not beleive some of the things i hear on Youtube comments! everyday on videos i get stupid comments of people either complaining i cant ride (even tho their videos prove they are no better then me).  some are funny and some are just plain stupid!! i laugh about their immaturity though haha. once i got a comment on a horse falls video saying "take dat one vid off of dat blond girl at 1:26, ya dats me i am her" but the rider was Tina Lund, a top grand prix rider hahaha i laughed so hard..|`|pk8Oemycaa	I was talking to a girl and I told her I own a horse and I have been riding for 16 years and she said, "so you ride your horse?"<br>  <br>  And I had another little girl that was out at the barn, she was watching me tack up my horse, and she said, "Is he your horse?" And I said, "yeah." Then she said, "Have you ever ridden him before?" <br>  <br>  hahahaha.|`|F8qAgR3Vaa	Someone once asked what a female stallion is called.|`|MUfMJYHGaa	This from someone who took money as an equine expert at clinics<br>  "Yellow is their favorite color."|`|amJ7EcD1aa	Some people say their not smart..

I will add them as I remember.<br>  <br>  I have also heard that "look a baby horse shouldn't it be with its mother?"

People are funny.|`|BHkwWWIAaa	Teehee.<br>  When I was up riding dressage in Ohio, we bought new flymasks for all of the horses, since their old ones were falling apart. Lo and behold, the next day someone called the SPCA screaming:<br>  "These people are putting masks on their horses' heads and they can't see!"<br>  Well, one of the agents actually had to COME to our barn to see the horses because this lady (who knew nothing about horses, it turns out) was so hysterical, even though the poor guy had tried to explain to her about flymasks xD<br>  We had a good time explaining that one.<br>  <br>  Also, one time I was using a crop on a stubborn horse, and to get the canter I had to tap a little behind my leg, and lo and behold someone yelled from the side of the ring:<br>  "OMG she's abusing that horse!"<br>  (This has happened a couple of times, even when I don't use the crop and am only holding it because the horse occasionally tries to refuse a jump xD)<br>  <br>  Once, I was in a barn show with a red-ribboned horse. Someone cut directly in front of me with their rump basically to my horse's nose...<br>  AND THEY HAD A RED RIBBON, TOO! d.d<br>  Luckily, nobody got hurt and I shot out of there like a greased pig.<br>  <br>  Our 30 year old shetland has often been called the baby of our 30 year old mare and 30 year old gelding xD! Both 'parents' are QHs, one is a foundation, the other is an American.<br>  <br>  I was called a horse abuser (yet again xD) while holding a horse's poll and squeezing the corners of their mouth gently to get him to accept the bit.|`|BCZ1ezXMaa	haha okay so there is was this like 16hh gelding and this mini shetland and they live in the same stall. and when they were in the paddock this little girl goes "look! a mommy and her baby!"<br>  i was laughing cuz the big one is A. a gelding and B. a wayyyy different breed!<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  "do you feed the horses straw?"|`|01e20da0d169c7d0c6c0a2c2631a8036aa	It wasn't funny, but in school the other day we got into this big debate over "if horses should be used for food"<br>  I don' t think that they should. <br>  I do not know what runs around in some peoples heads..|`|KeQOHakpaa	i tried to explain the differences between riding styles to my friend once and she got so confused. she had been riding some of her neighbor's horses western, and she wanted to know what the riding style was that i ride, which is english. so i tried to explain the differences to her, and then the next day she comes up to me and goes, what was the type of riding you ride? isn't it eastern? this made me crack up, she was so sure that eastern was the style i ride horses, so we all got a good laugh that day. <br>  it irritates me when people are convinced they don't need to wear a helmet because they ride western or they think they know what they're doing. (they'll say, i've been riding for 6 years so i know what i'm doing, i don't need to wear a helmet, and i'm like that's all well and good, but you're risking your own life, even if they feel they know what they're doing)<br>  when someone says they have a 20.5hh horse, and i'm like well you must have the biggest horse in the world, and a horse that doesn't follow the hand system.<br>  it also bugs me when people try to trick us on y!answers by posting pictures they claim as them even though it's pretty obvious it isn't. <br>  oh and here's a funny story, once my trainer was giving this little girl a lesson (she'd only being riding for a few months) and the horse she was riding decided to stop dead in her tracks and scratch her head on her leg. and this little itty bitty girl didn't expect it and she just rolles/does a somersault over the horse's head onto the ground. so my trainer runs over and askes if she's ok, and the little girl just says, At least i didn't fall in poop!. this was so cute, that little girl was a tough one too.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	"Do horses eat like... meat and stuff?"<br>  <br>  "So if a horse is yellow that means it's a girl, right?"<br>  <br>  "Awww!

XurYYreBaa	Actually, you *shouldn't* get a rat-- it's best to get @ least 2 of these smart, social creatures.  I agree with your 1st answerer, Martin's cages are really good.  So are Ferret Nation & other multi-level cages intended for ferrets.<br>  Domestic rats are. generally speaking, intelligent, friendly, funny & playful.  They learn their names & other words quickly.  Every rat is an individual like the rest of us & each of our 6 rats has a unique personality.  Most of our rats enjoy going places with us in the car & when we bring them visiting people often are surprised @ how well behaved they are.  Our 2 youngest females (6 & 12 months old) enjoy playing tag with each other.|`|1YcKHGLqaa	Um... why... if you don't want one...?<br>  <br>  Well, anyways... um, each rat is different. I've had rats ranging from quiet and shy to very vocal and confident. I've had rats who were good about "following the rules" and I had one who was like Houdini about getting out of her cage. In short: every rat is TOTALLY different. To try to say that they are all any one trait would be impossible; they're just like people.<br>  <br>  Cages... I like these: <a href="http://martinscages.com/products/cages/rat/" rel="nofollow">http://martinscages.com/products/cages/r...</a><br>  <br>  I like the Highrise model, personally. Gives the rats lots of room to run, climb, and play. <br>  <br>  I'm at school right now, so I can't keep furry pets, but I had several rats back home :) All lovely, wonderful little girls.|`|RPaHObubaa	One cool thing about rats is that they all have different personality's like humans do! If you pick the right one, it can be sweet and clam, sweet and energetic, or anything else! I have had MANY animals such as gerbils, ferrets, hamsters, rabbits, guinea pigs, dog, cats, birds, mice,and i have yet to find an animal better that a rat. Rats are truly amazing little creatures. The more you watch their behaviors, the more you will learn about them and grow to love them. Their capacity for affection is startling, and their unique personalities are a joy! There is no doubt that they are Intelligent individuals that actually want a relationship with their human families. Their behaviors don't exclude us from their world; they actually invite us in!<br>  <br>  Cage: <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3057122" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  This cage is great because it has a metal bottom that prevents corner-chewing, it is big enough to fit a couple of rats, and is cheap!<br>  <br>  I have had 6 rats in my life time.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Let me preface this answer with an apology for its length, but I did want to cover all the bases and give you some links that will help you.<br>  <br>  I was heartened to read your final edit,10 hours ago edition, that you won't declaw your cat. Also thank you for rescuing a homeless cat. Your heart is definitely in the right place by adoptiing him. This being said . . . <br>  <br>  From what I am reading it sounds to me that you are frustrated with your kitty, but no matter what other kitten or cat you bring into your home, you will be facing the same  problem. Your statement about your cat not needing his claws is actually not true. Cats need their claws for many reasons, including if they escape out the door, for protection.<br>  <br>  As far as the ASPCA is concerned, here is a link to their website about declawing.  They do not condone it, or will they help in any way to defray the cost.<br>  <a href="http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/scratching.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/s...</a><br>  <br>  One can clip cat's claws, but it takes some patience and training to be able to do it so it doesn't hurt the kitty.<br>  If you go too far into the nail itself, there are very sensitive nerves in the area which is darkened, and not clear. This hurts the cat dreadfully, and once a cat is "clipped" too close, the cat gets scared and gets defensive. So one has to go very slowly and patiently. I once accidently got too close with one of my cats, and it took weeks for him to trust me again. Lots of treats and using extra caution, I was able to bring him back to normal, and he doesn't resist anymore. <br>  <br>  Providing your cat with an adequate and inviting scratching device helps immensely in preventing curtain climbing and destruction of furniture. The scratching post needs to be tall enough for the cat to completely stretch out the body., See, cats don't scratch to "sharpen" claws, they do this to help stretch their muscles and also to leave scent markings. They also "clean" their nail sheaths by scratching.<br>  <br>  While carpet posts are attractive to us humans, the texture is really not great for cats. It is like filing your nails with a dull emory board. So get a few scratching posts and a cat tree that has sisal covering. Your cat will love that, and use it. Also giving a cat a scratching poost covered with carpet can confuse a cat, because it may be very similar to your own carpets, and he won't understand that he is not to scratch carpets.<br>  <br>  Young cats, which I assume yours is, are very playful. They can get play aggressive, and scratch and bite. They must be trained that this is not acceptable. Never hit your cat if he is doing this. It will only get him scared of you!  Redirect his behavior by tossing a toy that he can bite. A sock stuffed with cotton and catnip is a great toy for cats to get their claws and teeth into, so your hands will not be the object of play. Some folks enjoy rough housing with their cats and offer their hands in play. The cat is only cooperating in the game, and learning that this is ok. So never use hands as a toy.<br>  <br>  Be patient with clipping, and using soft paws. With patience and rewards with treats, you can easily get your cat to cooperate, of course understanding that young cats can have lots of excess energy. Wrap the cat in a towel, or use a "sling" device to  confine your cat so he can't scratch or bite. <br>  <a href="http://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/clientED/cat_restraint.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/clientED/cat_r...</a><br>  <br>  Here is a great article on how to clip nails for your convenience, as well.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/ClientED/cat_claws.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/ClientED/cat_c...</a><br>  <br>  Hope all this information is helpful and thanks so much for reconsidering. It takes time and patience, but your goal for a cat that is well behaved and cooperative is highly achievable. I once adopted a cat that had been declawed, and I soon learned that many cats develop neurotic behavior after the procedure. She chewed holes in all my lampshades and windowshades. So obviously declawing is not the answer.

And they will NOT declaw - as they see the results of this mutilation.  Cats who get de-toed often have unwanted side effects - biting, aggressiveness, and refusal to use the litter box.  It leave them with painfully mutilated feet, can you blame them?  Imagine lopping of the first joints of all your toes, then sending you home the next day to walk on your now-deformed feet. <br>  <br>  Put your money towards some other disposable item, clearly a living breathing creature isn't the right "possession" for you.   If you don't want to shell out money for a spay, then I shudder to think about what would happen if the poor cat ever had the nerve to get sick and need vet care.|`|IuYekkPVaa	ASPCA has the word "protection" in their title so they will not declaw a cat, but they may be able to assist you with the cost of neutering.<br>  <br>  A cat needs their claws regardless of whether they spend any time outside or not.  Cats are digitgrade (they walk on their toes) and declawing means amputating the end of their toes.  It is extremely cruel and 25 countries have banned it for this very reason.  UK legislation goes so far as to refer to it as an "unnecessary mutilation".  <br>  <br>  Neutering will benefit your cat's health in so many ways, but declawing is only for the benefit of the owner and the vet who makes a small fortune by encouraging people to do this.<br>  <br>  If you have genuinely read the truth about declawing and still want to get it done, then a cat is not the pet for you.  You don't sound like you have much patience with animals, so it's probably better that you follow through with your idea of surrendering him to a shelter who can find him a new owner.|`|4aAhEK9daa	You're mistaken.  A shelter would never mutilate a cat for an adopter. <br>  <br>  Why do you want to declaw?  Do you know what it REALLY is?  Cat claws are retractable so they can't be "declawed" - they're actually DETOED.  They CHOP OFF THE FIRST JOINT OF EVERY TOE to remove the claw.  It's such an unnecessary and barbaric thing to do to a cat that it's illegal in many countries.<br>  <br>  Paws come with claws.  If you don't want claws, don't get a cat - simple as that.  Try chopping off one of your fingers at the first joint - how does it feel?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.declawing" rel="nofollow">http://www.declawing</a><br>   Pic of declaw - <a href="http://www.animalvoices.ca/images/declaw.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.animalvoices.ca/images/declaw...</a>|`|AA11887983	I doubt that the ASPCA will declaw the cat at all.

You have to call and ask.|`|G032Flc3aa	TTC is talking rubbish, her announcement of "OK here comes the vet technician" would be laughable if it wasn't such a load of c***!<br>  <br>  Poster, you do not deserve a cat, you don't even want to pay for necessary things like neutering and vaccinations and then you also want him declawed for free and couldn't care less about the pain you put him through, no animals rescue is EVER going to encourage or pay for declawing, the best thing you can do it give him up to the ASPCA where he will not be mutilated out of selfishness, he will be neutered and found a loving home with someone who understands and cares about cats.<br>  How you can say you "love animals and stuff" then write like you did about your cat beats me.  I'd say giving him up to the ASPCA is urgent because it sounds as though he is scared of you and trying to defend himself.|`|huEWXxmLaa	Well hooray, he will be better of with the ASPCA and then you can get yourself a toy cat that just sits on a windowsill and you can pick it up and do anything to it when you feel like it. It won't have claws,toy cats don't need them as they have no feelings, and don't know if someone is mauling them about. That will maybe make you happy.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	The SPCA does not declaw.  They have programs for low income households where you can get either free or discounted spay/neuter.  You should really reconsider the declawing.  It's more than just removing the claws- they actually amputate the first joint of the cat's toes.  It can result in the cat becoming aggressive and biting and sometimes they stop using the litter box because it hurts their paws to dig.  Instead of spending money to hurt and mutilate your kitty, invest in a good cat tree with scratching posts so she has somewhere appropriate to claw.

Do you think people give money to charities to pay for people's cats to be mutilated ??? Do you even know if you have a male or female cat ?

Think about what you are doing.....and to the person working at a vets  and saying declawing isn't the same as it used to be, you must be the cleaner there dear as it IS STILL amputating the cats toes, whichever way, cut off or lasered off, the pain is the same and the lifelong effects are the same, the cat is left crippled !!!!You say you've seen pictures and it is horrible, no it's not horrible, it's worse than that, it's DREADFUL animal abuse and that's why it's banned in 25 countries. <br>  Look into your heart and then get your cat a decent home !!!|`|wx1WVpP5aa	I can't believe you want this done for free !

I wish the local media would do a story on you so that your whole town could abuse you, not just the people on here.

Do NOT clip the horse's head until the bar is up. Once the first horse is securely loaded the the same with the second (if there is a second.)

Do a safety check (double check the doors, the tailgate, the hookup, the lights) and you're set! <br>  <br>  To unload, you do everything in reverse.

CkecSp4Uaa	Some dogs just have poor dentition and are prone to dental problems no matter what.  I'm sorry about your situation, it's frustrating and a difficult one to be in.  Would your parents listen to your vet if they were the ones advising that the teeth need to be cleaned?  <br>  <br>  Dental disease can lead to heart problems and systemic blood infections if they are bad enough because those infected, inflamed gums are a gateway for bacteria to get into the bloodstream.  Vets don't want to pull teeth unless they have to, but if the teeth are diseased then it is better to pull the tooth than to let it abscess and make the dog really sick (and very painful).  Brushing her teeth daily or every other day can help to keep a dog's teeth clean, but in your case I would recommend not brushing until after you can convince your parents to get her teeth professionally cleaned.  At this point brushing probably isn't doing much good and is probably painful for her.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Wow, you're more responsible than your parents in this case.<br>  <br>  Keep working on your parents, tell them leaving bad teeth in will only make teeth that are good go bad sooner.  <br>  <br>  Or maybe go ask them what you can do to earn some money.

And I believe you have to be 18, or at least be with an 18 year old, because if anyone under 18 signs papers, they are void.<br>  <br>  Add: Blue Buffalo is a great food! Just add a couple meaty bones in (I'd go with one a week for starters), to help her getting healthier teeth.|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	You are a GREAT dog owner...put lots of adult to shame.<br>  <br>  The best cleaning tool for dog's teeth...Knuckle bone!!!  Some pet store sell BIG smoked one....or you can go to a local butcher and buy it cheap.  Don't cook it though, the bone may splinter.<br>  <br>  The dog will love you for this.  hmmm..yummy|`|TRfF23afaa	Hi,<br>  Let me start with, in the state I live in, Illinois, anyone can make an appointment and bring a dog to a vet. I assume your dog was originally  given it's shots by a vet, If you have never been to this vet they will probably want you to bring in papers to prove the dog is up to date with rabie shots etc. Keep in  mind that most Vets, unless they know the dog, will expect payment at the time of the visit. You can ask ahead of time what they charge. Also, many larger PetSmarts have vets available, which may be less expensive. I have never heard of the owner signing any papers to have the dog examined. IF a procedure needs to be done, you would make another appointment and then you would have to have an 18 year old sign the permission form.<br>  My Golden Retriever had black and brown spotted gums, and yellowish teeth, she was checked yearly by a vet and her teeth were healthy and strong. She only ate dry food and I gave her milk bones as treats and to help remove tartar. I don't know what kind your dog is, but in any case you should have him checked out, it's up to you and your parents wether or not you choose to have any teeth removed, but since none of you are vets, you wont know what, or if, anything is wrong, so stop second guessing, tell the vet you haven't much money but want the best for your dog, and are concerned. A good vet wont want your dog to suffer either!<br>  You sound like a great kid, the vet will appreciate that and be honest with you, if you are honest with them. If not, call a different vet.<br>  Ladyday<br>  PS. My daughter used to make the appt., with my permission, when she was eleven and walk our dog over. She is now a Vet herself! Good luck honey!|`|PM23RDycaa	Just keep nagging your parents. She needs a PROPER cleaning done by the vet.<br>  <br>  She will if she hasn't already, eventually develop periodontal disease. The bacteria will spread to her heart, liver and kidneys.
8cikAYp3aa	in young horses its a habit they get into.  One thought on it is low minerals,  but you say he's been checked.  The other thought is that he is lacking natural digestive bacteria and trying to suplement himself.  Alot of young animals especially grazers do it  to seed their own systems with more of the proper bacteria to help them digest their food.  A small study was done at penn about it and horses put on a probiotic suplement ( commonly given to Sr. horses or foals) stoped eating the manure.   You can try giving him a suplement|`|EQvAbyvcaa	He could be hungry and is eating what is available.  Also, he could have a vitamin or mineral deficiency.  Check to make sure his food has all vit. and min. requirements.   May sure he has good quality hay 24/7.   He should have access to a salt block or free choice mineral/salt mixture.  If available, horses will self regulate on salt and minerals.  good luck.|`|qw9ZjAlDaa	Some studies say that horse eat manure when they are low on certain minerals.  Although some horses still ingest manure when their minerals are balanced...they do it out of boredom or to pick at the grain that isn't fully digested and comes out in the manure.  My guess would be that he's picking at grain since he has minerals available and plenty to do.|`|C6Ozw9draa	The quarter horse i lease does that. When there is Manure in the ring and we are walking, he will nose it and pick up little bits. I think its just a habit (he is on supplements and everything)<br>  talk to your vet about vitamins, maybe he is missing out on some that he needs.|`|gvx9Jiteaa	It depends on digestive system he has.|`|JcwQ4nK7aa	it's just a stinky habit they sometimes pick up out of boredom -unless their nutrition is lacking -then that could be the cause... make sure you have a mineral block in the pasture...blocks are like lolly pops -gives them something to do and get their nutrients....|`|ccfeffd151719aa73771808d66461cd2aa	my friends horses and my aunts horses eat their poop too. its really kinda normal. most likely his poop tastes just like his food. is he passing any whole food? he could be missing some nutrition.  but for the most part he prolly just thinks its food.|`|MUfMJYHGaa	He's probably picking out the grain from the manure. It's not an odd habit at all. The younger ones are more prone to it tho.|`|8fyMtGjdaa	Ok, are you trying to say that your friends CHILD or ANIMAL is eating the horse manure? I am assuming you are talking about an animal.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Well my mare does that too.  Its disgusting when she eats little bits and then comes over to me and just licks my arm (blech i dont want pooies and spit combined on me!) It's no biggie, I know a million horses who do that, I was a bit concerned about my mare for awhile but then I saw other horses doing it at boarding farms and stuff, and I stopped worrying about it.<br>  As long as all the horses there are UTD on everything that affects them internally (deworming, vaccinations...) then there should be no trouble.  I wouldn't want my horse eating worms if I were you, so if a horse gets worms (you see it in their poop) then you have to worm your horse and that horse.<br>  I thought you were talking about a person eating horse poop =O
0f3fde633bd5c269a5dc7fc600702cccaa	Perhaps you are using the wrong dewormer.  They don't all deworm for the same things.  If its tapeworms you need to go to the vet and get an injection of Droncit to get rid of them.  If its roundworms your puppy might be reinfecting himself if the area he goes to the bathroom in is not cleaned up regularly.  You don't state what kind of worms it is so its hard to say.  You should go to the vet,  have them run a fecal to tell what kind of worms exactly he has and get the right medication to treat it with.  You can also do heart worm prevention once a month that will deworm for roundworms and hookworms monthly.<br>  EDIT: What you are describing are tapeworms.  You need to treat the fleas as well as deworm your dog with either Droncit or Drontal plus.  Dogs get tapeworms from fleas so you have to get rid of them or the problem will just keep coming back.<br>  The fastest easiest way to stop a dog from eating its own feces is to make sure its not available.  Clean up the poop as soon as he does it then he won't be reinfecting himself either.  <br>  There is absolutely no truth in the statement that dogs eat poop because of poor nutrition.  It is a behavior problem not a nutrition problem.<br>  EDIT:  As young as he is it is very possiable he had the tapeworms before you got him.  He may have had fleas at the breeders house.<br>  EDIT:  Strongid (pyrantal pamoate) does not deworm for all worms.  It does not treat tapeworms and if your vet said it does you need to find another vet.<a href="http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_pyrantel_pamoate.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_pyr...</a>|`|GaL66jbQaa	Take him to the vet.  if he's not on a preventative he's just going to keep giving himself worms over and over again|`|4hNRTWtDaa	The worms that look like rice come from fleas, or if your dog eats rats or mice (seems unlikely).  You need to get rid of fleas on your dog, AND more importantly, in your home.  If you don't get rid of the ones in the carpeting and bedding, they will keep hatching out and get onto your dog.  Ask your vet for advice on all of this.<br>  <br>  Also, if your puppy is eating stool, he can keep reinfecting himself with other kinds of worms.  If you walk him on a leash, and keep the poop picked up, you won't have that problem.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	A dog doesn't just get worms once, they can get re-infected by what they eat.<br>  <br>  Fleas are part of the tapeworm life cycle, so if your dog has fleas and one or more are carrying the larvae stage of tapeworm and your dog eats one while licking his fur, he'll get re-infected with tapeworm.<br>  <br>  If he eats other dog's poo he can get any of the worm types that are in that poo if the worms are still alive.  If he eats dead mice or birds he can get worms that way as well if those had parasites themselves.<br>  <br>  You ALSO have to treat for the correct worm.  A roundworm medicine won't get rid of tapeworm. Take a poop sample to the vets and have them check it. They'll recommend what you need. Ask them about how the dog would be getting re-infected.<br>  <br>  (Your description in the details would be tapeworm).  Fleas don't have to be in the home. You can bring one in on your shoes or clothing, or he could pick one up while on a walk outside. It only takes one for the dog to be infected if the flea has the tapeworm larvae and is eaten by the dog.  The dog won't necessarily be dripping in fleas before he'd get infected.  Tapeworm requires a different worming medicine usually.  The worm meds over the counter usually only do round worm, hook worm and a few others. It doesn't touch heartworm or tapeworm.|`|87e42b12d9375f23a7f6007b19387ae4aa	thats why he gets the worms. my cats get them from licking fleas off of eachother. dont let him eat his own fesces and dont let him have fleas/lick them off himself and keep applying medicine after time they will cycle out. the worms are toxic to humans so never touch them, and make sure that if the dog has them around his butt that you keep where hes been sitting clean because like i said they are really bad for humans to come in contact with.|`|0haWIfVMaa	Well if he is digesting the worm back into his body by eating his feces, then it is not helping the problem at all. Try to stop that habit right away and take him back to the vet. Those worms could reach his heart and be fatal so help him out!|`|dl1OOOT8aa	"he eats his own poo"<br>  There lady is your problem. Roundworms is transmitted through the feces. Take the dog to a vet to get treated again and make sure you keep the dog's quarters spotless! You can do this by using a crate and following a strict feeding schedule.<br>  <br>  Dogs tend to eat their poop because there still some undigested food in it. Switch to a better quality food and maybe add a teaspoon of plain canned pumpkin or pineapple to the food.|`|EcAeLWLFaa	My mom's dog had the same thing. What type of medicine have you given him? If you have a Petco or a Petsmart you can try getting  8 in 1 safe-guard 4 Canine Dewormer and it worked 100% for my mom's dog. Check to make sure you get the right one because they come for each weight class. It easy to use and you give it to them with their food. One way to help him stop eating poo is to get the canned pineapple's and give him a little bit before each meal unless u leave food out just give him some in the morning and afternoon. This will make their poo bitter and they wont like it. The main reason they eat poo is because she aren't getting enough nutrition from the food they are eating or they are merely cleaning up after themselves. The pineapple won't do any harm it's safe you can look it up yourself.|`|N9IE36uBaa	What kind of worms are they? That's the first thing you need to know. Take him to a vet to get a stool sample and have it analysed.|`|IBEl08szaa	My shih tzu had worms like yours did i got him to the vet and he gave me alot of medicine and gave him shots all within a couple weeks now he's fine so get him looked at
Rrpb5aLMaa	A-Airway<br>  <br>  The first step in dog CPR is to obtain an open airway. Do not continue to B-Breathing and C-Circulation until you have an open airway. <br>  <br>  Please be careful when doing this as, even if she is unresponsive, your dog may bite by instinct.<br>  <br>  If her tongue has rolled into the back of her mouth, pull it straight out of her mouth to open the airway.<br>  <br>  Ensure that her neck is straight by bringing the head in line with the neck. If she's suffering from head or neck trauma, do not over-straighten the neck. <br>  <br>  Perform two (2) rescue breaths. Do this by holding her mouth closed and then giving mouth-to-nose ventilations. If the breaths go in easily, continue on to B-Breathing.<br>  <br>  If the breaths do not go in, or if you detect some resistance, reposition her neck and try the two breaths again.<br>  <br>  If these breaths do not go in, inspect the airway by looking into your dog's mouth. Look down her throat for a foreign object blocking the airway. If you see one, reach in and remove it.<br>  <br>  Try two more breaths. If you can't get them into her, you'll have to use the Heimlich maneuver.  <br>  <br>  <br>  A-Heimlich Maneuver<br>  <br>  Only perform the Heimlich Maneuver if you could not remove the object from your dog's airway.<br>  <br>  Turn her upside down, with her back against your chest. If she's large and/or heavy, you may need someone to help you hold her.<br>  <br>  Wrap your arms around her, just below the rib cage (since you're holding her upside down, it's above the rib cage, in the abdomen). Grasp your fist with your other hand.<br>  <br>  Using both arms, give five (5) sharp thrusts to the abdomen. The thrusts should feel like quick bear hugs. Perform all five as if each one is the one that will force the object from her airway.<br>  <br>  After the five thrusts, check her mouth and airway for the object. If you see it, remove it and give two more mouth-to-nose ventilations. If the breaths still do not go in, or feel restricted, repeat from Step 1, above.<br>  <br>  <br>  B-Breathing<br>  <br>  Once you have cleared her airway and given the two rescue breaths, check whether your dog is breathing. If she is breathing effectively, you can now perform dog CPR. If she is not breathing, or her breathing is labored, focus on helping her breathe first.<br>  <br>  If her tongue has rolled into the back of her mouth, pull it straight out of her mouth to open the airway.<br>  <br>  Ensure that her neck is straight by bringing the head in line with the neck. If she's suffering from head or neck trauma, do not over-straighten the neck. <br>  <br>  Give her 12 breaths per minute, one (1) every five (5) seconds. Each breath only needs to make her chest just rise. Do not over inflate the lungs, especially in a small dog.<br>  <br>  If the breaths do not go in, return to A-Airway and A-Heimlich Maneuver.<br>  <br>  If the breaths go in properly, proceed to C-Circulation and begin dog CPR. Continue the breathing support if it is still, or becomes, necessary.<br>  <br>  C-Circulation<br>  <br>  Before beginning dog CPR, be sure that you have a clear airway and that your dog is breathing properly. Only begin CPR after completing all steps in A-Airway and B-Breathing.<br>  <br>  Before beginning dog CPR, check for major bleeding. Look for pooling or spurting blood. If you find either, control the bleeding by applying pressure with your hand and a gauze bandage.<br>  <br>  Check for a pulse in her groin (where the inside of her rear leg meets her abdomen). Be very careful if you check this on a conscious dog, as she may snap or bite.<br>  <br>  Lay your dog on her right side, with her back towards your knees.<br>  <br>  Place your hands where her left elbow touches her chest. This should be more or less in the middle of the rib cage.<br>  <br>  Compress her chest 15 times, followed by two mouth-to-nose breaths. Give three (3) compressions every two (2) seconds.<br>  <br>  The size of your dog will determine how much you should compress her chest.<br>  <br>  If she's a small dog, compressions should be a half inch (1/2", or 1.25 cm).<br>  <br>  If she's a medium size dog, use one inch (1", or 2.5 cm) compressions.<br>  <br>  If she's a large dog, one and a half inch (1.5", or 3.75 cm) compressions are sufficient.<br>  <br>  Repeat Step 5 as necessary.<br>  <br>  Once these dog CPR steps have your dog breathing again, or if you are unable to stabilize her problem, lift and move her to the car and get her to your vet or emergency animal clinic. <br>  <br>  Let them know that you're bringing in your dog, and that she has had either respiratory arrest or cardiac arrest. Also provide any other details, such as the cause (electrocution, poisoning or unknown cause). The more information you can provide, the better prepared the clinic staff will be when you get your dog there. <br>  <br>  There is no doubt that dog CPR can save your dog's life if she goes into cardiac arrest or respiratory arrest. Invest some time in reviewing this information and "practicing" on her. <br>  <br>  Please remember, however, not to attempt CPR on her if her heart is beating. You might create more problems than you'll fix if you do. <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!!!!|`|bIaywrBCaa	if she is choking, get her to a vet ASAP|`|bTLwhwR3aa	I cant tell, by what you have just said... mine do this too.. but they are playing, when they do..|`|kbajDcJlaa	She may be choking. Get a grip and go down into her airway. Also check the roof of her mouth for a stick that may have gotten caught across the roof of her mouth--between her teetch. Should something be caughter down there, try heimlech manuveur--spot just behind her rib cage. Call ER vet if no success by the time you read this. If she is choking she will lose consciousness. Think. What has she been into.<br>  CAll ER vet for other things, such as antifreeze, poisons or is this an epilepsy event? Should it resolve itself in next few minutes, follow up ASAP|`|7OLg13B8aa	Check her mouth see if shes has anything stuck in there|`|eSDoWrgoaa	take her in right now!!!!! geesh|`|VnNyHkImaa	if she was just running around all crazy id say let her burn off her energy, but if shes choking, id get her to the emergency vet asap.
GaL66jbQaa	liquid there's a list out there of all the brands affected just google it.  it's probably not going to hurt him as long as you found it and got rid of it|`|t9Fxx75uaa	It was a liquid that was used in the gleuten part of the food.  If your food does not have gleutens in it, then no worries.  I think the piece of hard plastic was something that just slipped thru but I would get in touch with them and give them the lot number and all.  Maybe they'll send you a coupon for a free bag.  You can google "dog food recalls" to see what it was and the brands involved.  If you feed a good holistic food there is no problem probably but if you feed from a grocery store or wal mart brand or Eukanuba, Science Diet or anything else corn based, look out.
3p6wp7DYaa	I have to say that my dog's experience with Wellness was not that great. I switched him from Iams to Purina Pro Plan and then from that to Wellness Whitefish and Sweet Potato Formula. He ate Wellness for two weeks (not very eagerly, mind you) and then he started vomiting and having serious issues. After switching to Wellness he started to shed a lot and seemed uninterested in the food and I had to spend $250 on vet bills to rule out any serious problems...<br>  <br>  He's now eating California Natural lamb and rice food. Some dogs just don't do so well on ultra rich ultra high protein food. And if your dog doesn't have any food allergies or any other health problems on Iams, maybe you should just let him eat it. At least there has been several generations of dogs fed Iams that were routinely observed by the manufacturer. The same cannot be said by some of the smaller newer  companies that simply manufacture the food to adhere to AAFCO standards but have not been observed in actual food trials.|`|MPQI8Bg3aa	I bet your dog will love Wellness brand food. My dog used to be on Iams as well and made the transition really well. Wellness is a much higher quality food so your dog will probably eat less. Also, as mentioned, slowly change the dog over by feeding the old food and gradually adding larger amounts of the new food to it.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	My dog has similar problems on the very high quality, high protein foods.  They give him the poos so I figure the top of the line stuff just isn't good for him.<br>  <br>  So I've stepped him down to the Wellness White Fish and Sweetpotato ... not the Wellness Core, but this stuff <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/showproduct.php?product=324&cat=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a><br>  <br>  And he did great on that.  But, then I noticed that Welness went up in price and Solid Gold went down, so I switched him to the large breed dogfood (which is lower in protein than their regular adult formula) and he's doing well on it as well.  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/showproduct.php?product=2121&cat=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a><br>  <br>  I think a lot of people will try to tell you that you should feed the very high protein, top of the line foods ... but in all reality, you should feed your dog food that doesn't give it the runs lol.  And these two have seemed to do well with my guy.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|t9Fxx75uaa	I feed our dog Wellness and we love it.  Try a 6 lb bag of the adult mix and see.  Just make sure you do the switch over a week or so time.  Mix a little in the first few days then 50-50 for a few days then more new stuff then the final switch. Hope it works cause you are correct that Iams isn't the greatest but sometimes we just have to go with what our dog likes and agrees with.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Wellness is a great brand you have to switch dogs gradually to any food.  I also like Eagle Pack , Innova, and Eukanuba naturally wild|`|pTYbhKf5aa	Get a blend for sensitive stomach, like one Wellness makes with Venison.  Gradually switch the food, mixing mostly the old food and 1/4 new for a few days or so, then mix it 1/2 and 1/2 old and new, then 3/4 new and 1/4 old then all new.  You can also add a few heaping tablespoonfuls of canned pumpkin (no spices added) which is great for settling the stomach/digestion at a time of change.<br>  I think that would be an excellent choice for your dog as long as you make the change gradually.  Wellness was not recalled during the mega-recalls of the past few years.<br>  In addition to your dog's food, you might consider sometimes scrambling an egg and adding that to the food.  Ours eat another brand, healtheir than Iam's, which is a Venison blend and tolerate it well.  We give them Omega 3 fish oil caps for humans in a Vet recommended amount.  Also we add a bit of Activia to their food. They love it and it's great for digestion.  I bake them biscuits from scratch using ingredients sold for humans. We don't give them rawhides of any sort and are careful with the treats they get.<br>  Fine tuning their diet has made a significant improvement in their skin, coat, over all health and appearance.|`|kbajDcJlaa	You will find as many answers as there are stars in the sky. Find a food she does well on, and keep her on it. Talking dog food is like talking religion--Everyone--including me-- has the "truth" regarding dog food. Every dog is different. Talk to your breeder or your vet, and if your pup is eating well, pooping well, looking healthy, I think you are in good shape.|`|WyNOAZb9aa	Innova dog food is the only dog food that is rated human edible.  It has all sorts of yuppy stuff in it like sprouts and stuff, but the main ingredient is still meat (or was when I last bought it)<br>  <br>  It was a bit more but why give your dog something you would not eat?|`|Grb85RJuaa	When you change their dog food you have to start off my mixing the new food into the old food so they can adjust to the new type of food or they'll get diarrhea.|`|fgxajTiBaa	I tried my dog on some of the super premium foods and he had the same reaction as yours. Even after a couple months he was still having consistent diarrhea and would not put on any weight. I ended up putting him on California Natural, currently he's eating the adult Herring & Sweet Potato. It's made for dogs who can't tolerate rich foods and has limited ingredients. I saw an improvement really quickly and he loves it. It is also still a really high quality food. <br>  <br>  In terms of Wellness, my own experience is that it is just as rich as some of the other great foods out there, my dog couldn't tolerate it.
IX9znFLAaa	Depends on if they suddenly began to sag or if they gradually became that way.  If they suddenly became that way, she may be pregnant.  Try emailing a pygmy goat breeder, they have great advice and are usually very eager to help!|`|CuGT5X6eaa	if she has been bred before and had kids then she might have a baggy bag (lol) but if she has never had kids she shouldnt have a bag at all....
y31mee4Faa	If you have another cage, separate them & watch her.<br>  <br>  There is a uropygial gland on the tail, right above the vent of many parrots.  It's their preen gland & sometimes, if this gland is dry, irritated, itching or otherwise bothering them, they can mutilate it.<br>  <br>  This is true of their vent also.  Lift her & carefully feel her abdomen, from about the center of her belly to her vent.  If you feel anything hard, she may be egg bound (carrying an egg that she can't pass).  If you think she may be egg bound, she needs to be taken to an avian vet ASAP, but in the mean time, she needs warmth & increased humidity...vaporizers work well.<br>  <br>  If you don't feel anything hard, check her vent area to be sure that that is where the blood is coming from.  Since she is moving around, it could be that she broke a blood feather.  Hens that are egg bound are usually lethargic & look sick, as the egg often presses on internal organs.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|j4R5JLBAaa	Might be she pluck off a blood feather?
46Mv3zl3aa	I LOVE the name Bobbin.<br>  It's different, but really really precious.|`|GERrhExAaa	Bobbin sounds like a fish name lol.

q0vKbocHaa	that crate is like a den to him. It gives him a sense of secuity. Just like how your home is too you. Putting him out of that when your gone is like having you being lost in Walmart of something as a kid without your mom|`|GaL66jbQaa	Maybe you need different toys my dogs eat most of their food out of a tricky treats ball, buster cube and dog pyramid|`|kbajDcJlaa	Crate means den--den means security. I don't think it is as simple as putting her back in the crate while you are gone. It sounds like separation anxiety or boredom--plus the crate deal. I would pretend to leave as usual and watch her from a window to see if she is having anxiety or settles in, or starts barking up a storm. If it is separation anxiety, google that for some advice that makes sense to you. She apparently learned her den is a clean place, but the house isn't. That can be rehabbed quickly with your help. Shih-poo is not my breed, but I think six hours without a potty break is too long.|`|DTGO1pgyaa	some dogs get comfortable with routine. if the crate is more comforting for your dog, there shouldn't be a problem. it is comforting. he may have a fear of being left alone in a "new" place.
f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Bloody stool = trip to the vet.  It could be anything from worms to colon cancer.  The kitty needs to see a vet soon.  If it was bloody urine, it could be a UTI which needs to be addressed ASAP. Those can become very serious very quickly.<br>  <br>  No, cats don't bleed during heat.  If she's not spayed, I would suggest having that done as well.  Unaltered females are at risk of developing deadly cancers and infections of the reproductive tract.|`|osFEzMy5aa	Could she be in heat?  If it looks more like a bloody stool I'd take her in just to make sure.  She might have ingested something sharp or have severe health problems.  If you decide not to take her at least do more research about it online to see what suits her.  But at least call, they're always willing to offer some advice over the phone.|`|7fVr3q0kaa	Un-spayed cats can bleed at certain times of their cycle.<br>  <br>  Another possibility--depending on your cat's age--is that she's loosing her baby teeth. If this is an adult cat, then that's not possible. However, if she's just a few months old, loosing the baby teeth can result in a little blood.<br>  <br>  Since the blood was in the litterbox, was in her her stool or urine? If the answer is yes, she needs to go to a vet. If the answer is no, and she is not spayed, and seems otherwise fine, her cycle might be the cause.<br>  <br>  -KittyMamma<br>  <a href="http://KittyMamma.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://KittyMamma.blogspot.com</a>|`|T0Plec3Aaa	Sorry to hear that your cat is not feeling to bright - the answer is not complicated though - it is probably a worm - so get some worming treatment from the vet or supermarket and give it to it. They contract worms through mozzie bites - hope this has helped. If it continues then maybe a vet visit is in order but try this first - with a couple of follow up treatments - by the way paste is easier to give than tablets.|`|II5N7XYKaa	Whatever it is, it needs to be checked out by a vet.  Cats are very good at hiding illness, so don't fall for it.  It could be any of a number of things, but only a vet can determine what.  Good luck.|`|fYbAS8xwaa	The best way to solve this problem is to put the cat down you don't want it suffering because of a sore paw.|`|5ZrVP3Xjaa	She probably hurt herself badly and doesn't realize it.

hmXWk90waa	A guinea pigs gestation period is 66-72 days so the 27th of feb should be about right or later, remove the male right now! just in case because if she gives birth while he is in her cage he will possibly kill the babies and an hr after the birth the female will become on heat again which means he will mate her and this can become very stressfull for the mother! Hope This Helps! Please feel free to ask me any other questions you have!|`|EhmERbKSaa	The gestation period for a guinea pig is approximately 2 months.

He could be either.|`|3hBQz33Yaa	i agree with the other responses i can see some pit in him...hes adorable!
y0cbLn0Yaa	Whether your dog is from a puppy mill or not is really irrelevant as the very fact that it came from a Pet Shop, pedigree or not, reveals that it is very poorly bred and comes from either a Puppy Mill or an ignorant and uncaring backyard breeder.<br>  <br>  One fact is clear and that is that it did not come from a responsible and ethical breeder.<br>  <br>  I will excuse you saying that you "dislike un-neutered dogs", usually referred to as intact or entire, as you are obviously very young and ignorant and therefore have much to learn about dogs in general.<br>  <br>  Personally, I dislike dogs purchased from Pet Shops and Backyard Breeders.  But then, I have very good reason for this as I don't believe that Puppy Mills and Backyard Breeders should be supported as their breeding practices are abusive and neglectful.|`|AA10412922	There are red flags on many but puppy millers have been known to copy good pedigrees off breeders websites and print them up as their own.I would research the dogs on the pedigree and email the kennels but I'd be very surprised if it wasn't from a puppy mill|`|LfZk2NGBaa	If you bought from a pet store you will have a puppy mill dog. Also a way to check is if the breeder is from the mid-west those are normally two give aways.|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	Are there dogs who have titles in the pedigree?|`|xZOlsByJaa	MOst pet stores broker in puure breed puppies.

Often times people breed their dogs, can't get anything for them and they end up in puppy mills.BTW. there is nothing wrong with the dogs, it's the puppy mill breeders that suck.<br>  I personally would never buy a dog from a pet shop with the intention of breeding and selling it, unless you are doing so to friends and family, who happen to love the dog as much as you do!|`|PM23RDycaa	Don't have to look at his pedigree(probably fake anyways) he was in a pet shop he either came from a puppymill/commercial breeder or a byb.|`|bIaywrBCaa	puppy mill because that is where pet store puppies come from.

tShDXmgbaa	Your tank is recycling itself to get the good bacteria colony again which was disturbed when you did the water change.  Leave the water alone so it can re-establish the good bacteria colony. If you dont leave it alone...it will continue to stay cloudy and your fish will become severely stressed.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	If your tank ecology goes off-balance, the water will often cloud up since there isn't enough "good" bacteria to keep the tank clean--you probably over vacuumed.  Just keep doing ammonia and nitrite (note:  it's with an "i" not nitrate with an "a") tests twice daily and if those are higher then zero, do 1/3% water changes until things settle down again.  (The water changes are more so your fish don't get poisoned by the ammnonia/nitrites.)|`|jzPOCzO1aa	try cleaning your filter|`|5u1G3Qb8aa	clean it
3BMBZtDxaa	Okay, don't get a Maltipoo. They are only dogs bred at puppymills and aren't good!<br>  <br>  All the breeds are totally different. A Maltese is a great little lap dog if you don't plan on doing anything with huge exercise with them. Great dogs! A Daschund is a quirky dog but that are prone to back problems and basically you're guarenteed to have to pay for at least one surgery for them. Beagles howl and bay which may not be great for apartment life. Corgis are hearding dogs and most likely if you don't have enough space for them to roam or give them enough exercise, they will often nip at your heels or run around you. Pomeranians are noisy, yappy dogs with huge personalities. Huskies do NOT do well in apartment life. They are big dogs who need a ton of exercise. I mean two hours of vigorous exercise at the least! Dalmations are prone to deafness and hearing problems and aren't the best apartment dogs unless you can run with them multiple times every single day. Yorkies are awesome little dogs.<br>  <br>  I would suggest a Maltese or Yorkie out of those for apartment life. The rest just don't fit well with apartment life or would be too noisy for you to keep. Read up on both the Maltese and the Yorkie to see which one you prefer better.<br>  <br>  Here are some links about the Maltese:<br>  <a href="http://dogbreedinfo.com/maltese.htm" rel="nofollow">http://dogbreedinfo.com/maltese.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltese_(dog)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltese_(do...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/breeds/maltese/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/breeds/maltese/index....</a><br>  <br>  Here are some links about the Yorkie:<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/yorkshireterrier.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/yorkshireter...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Terrier" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/breeds/yorkshire_terrier/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/breeds/yorkshire_terr...</a><br>  <br>  Go to your local library and see if there are any books about them, too. Then your family can decide which one you like best. Be sure to rescue! There are plenty of purebred dogs who need new homes that are much cheaper than dogs from a breeder. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|a4eca20886ed5136a1b67933a28ef01baa	Okay I can already rule out the Dachshund,Beagle, Husky, and Dalmation.  These four are terrible apartment dogs.  Dachshunds and Beagle are terrible barkers.  Your neighbors will get VERY angry at you.  Huskys and Dalmations need A LOT of exercise and with no yard you will not be able to successfully own one of these dogs they will tear your house up.  Pomeranians can also be very bad barkers.  I would look into the Maltese, Maltipoo (mutt), corgi, or Yorkie.  Though with any of these dogs you will have to take it on at least two 30 minute walks a day, especially the Corgi.<br>  <br>  Here is a good info site on the different breeds.<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/a-z.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/a-z.htm</a>|`|pGacaRuFaa	Go to petfinder.com and use the questionnaire to figure out which breed would match your lifestyle best. It will have listings of all the shelter pets in your area that match your results. i would avoid anything big or energetic. We have a corgi, and he is an absolute hellion when he gets bored. Huskies need acres of room to run, and dalmatians need lots of space too. Something along the lines of a Yorkie or chihuahua would be the right size for an apartment, but you still have to walk them.|`|d8043f9c983ac001a490a18c9fc2a60aaa	You should not be getting a dog at all, if you have not researched and made up your mind as to what breed of dog you want you are certainly not nearly ready to care for a dog.Forget it, it's only an impulse, Buy some gold fish or silk worms|`|E3SKXPF1aa	Beagles are great dogs. Friendly, a little sporty, really loyal.<br>  Dalmations are also good but need more exercise and aren't quiet as loyal, well they can be but normally begals are more.<br>  Get a begal!!!!|`|D5eQqTmCaa	Definitely do not get a husky or a dalmation. It would be cruel to keep such big, energetic dogs cooped up in the house. To be honest, I don't think it's even appropriate to have a full time indoor dog...but if you're going to get one, I may as well try to be helpful...<br>  <br>  I would say get one of the smaller breeds...maltese, yorkie, dachshund, corgi...but you are going to need to somehow bring it outside to play sometimes. It would be really quite irresponsible to have a dog when you know it's going to be in the house constantly. Maybe you should think about getting a cat, or a caged animal, such as a rabbit or guinea pig?|`|Y6xanshEaa	T_T Apartment?<br>  No yard? First dog?<br>  <br>  ..Don't get a beagle,by any chance,DO NOT get a Beagle. They're horrible for first time owners,and apartments. <br>  I should know,I had one for one year..<br>  <br>  I'm unsure about your situation,but I'd say..<br>  Wait,big dogs are not good for apartments,also the ones you said aren't good for first time owners.<br>  <br>  Also..Maltipoo? You know one in a shelter?<br>  <br>  >< I don't really think any of these dog breeds are good for your situation.<br>  Why don't you search the breeds up,and figure them out yourself,before you adopt one,or get one from a breeder?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/breeds/complete_breed_list.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/breeds/complete_breed...</a><br>  <br>  However,Maltese do sound like the best breed for your situation.
AA10129150	You didn't say if your rabbit is fixed or not. If he is not, then this can be part of his normal behavior because of all the hormones he is producing. This kind of behavior is fairly common in rabbits that have not been fixed. If he is fixed then again it might just be his personality, and you should spend time with him, giving him treats for doing tricks like standing on his back legs, or sitting quietly and letting you pet him. At this age you might not be able to change him. If he doesn't have enough food, or space he might need more. Rabbits can be territorial, so try and figure out what he is comfortable with. Please don't drop him off on the side of the road, if you have to get rid of him call a shelter, they will find a good home for him.|`|Ro4H1kT8aa	take him 2 the vet|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Well he probably is just territorial. <br>  <br>  You just need to keep trying to get him to tame down.

ptNy4uicaa	Try using a spray bottle. It is a easy method of correction and 99% of catsdislike it and it works very well (it works for all my cats)<br>  Every time your cat "swipes" something spray it and say no, or sppppppppp.. or whatever, the cat will know the result of being sprayed, then it will associate the sound with the water, then eventually will react to just the sound and you will not need to use the water, and eventually your cat will stop all together. and that sound will work for other things other then swiping !<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|fKYi3IJ2aa	Cats are not the best listeners trust me I have 5 who don't hear a word I say until I start yelling. For your cats safety I would just baby proof the house (hide the wires and any other form of danger). You can try the squirt bottle but only some cats react to that. Your cat should grow out of that stage. when my cats got older they lost interest in little things like that|`|pT0SFrlFaa	I would put the wire away. I have tried the spray bottle and now my cat will lay his ears down, squint and still do it.|`|rJu4X6MDaa	put a body harness on it then hang it from the ceiling|`|Y8fDB2V7aa	since your cat swipes at anything and everything in sight first i would say no and then smack him or her on the head but not to be abusive but if that doesn't work use the spray bottle with water.  they'll get used to the word no.  to keep your cat from the desk you should try to find a clear plastic cover that will be see through but she won't be able to play with it at all.   Keep all wires hidden from sight.|`|7IjGzvqTaa	Maybe you could try using a spray bottle.  Whenever you see her swipe at something you'd prefer she didn't swipe at, give her a quick squirt.  Simply pulling her away isn't enough as it doesn't let her know that what she is doing will have unpleasant consequences.  The only trick to the squirt bottle method (or any type of negative reinforcement, really) is that she may simply learn to do it when you're not around.  If you haven't already, I would suggest getting her some type of toy, like a string with feathers and maybe a bell on the end.  When she realizes that you don't squirt her for playing with this, she'll be more inclined to play with that than the other objects.  Good luck!|`|qQJdi0p1aa	people are going to tell you to use a spry bottle...it works only for a while though. you should place some loose pocket change in a small coffee can(or similar metal can) and shake it when the cat goes near it. they really don't like to be startled ...good luck<br>  <br>  you could also close the door to your room if need be....lol|`|nB0sKXJ1aa	it sounds like she needs toys a great thin is a scratching post with those little toys that hang they love them or just grab some wool and make a ball and string hang it and it will love it thats wat i do hope this helps.|`|ncpgez55aa	Well try to get her more toys like a scratch post or a swiping toy.You could also get hear things that move easily or have bright colors like balls and streamers.a good idea for the wires is try to unplug them and hide them or unplug them and put paper towel tubes around it.(put the wires through the tubes)She also might be excited and really want to play.And if you still cant get her off your desk close the door until she stops.Keep Cats Off Furniture, Cars and Other Off-limit Areas <br>   <br>    <br>  Most cats hate being startled and the Jumpo Trainer is great at startling! It practically explodes upwards and makes a heck of a racket when an animal steps on the unit. Jumpos will train a cat to stay away! You might need to reset them a few times to get the training done. <br>  <br>  You can use Jumpo Trainers as stand alone units or with extended triggers. Use a lot of Jumpos to increase the chances of a training event. <br>  <br>  Jumpos can be used just about any place you have a cat behavior problem. <br>  <br>  You can use Jumpos on televisions, stereos, mantles, countertops, tabletops, chairs, in and near Christmas trees and house plants, etc. Wherever you need to teach your cat to stay away from, use Jumpos. <br>  <br>  Jumpos also work great outdoors. They are durable and UV-resistant. They work well on cars, both with and without expanded trigger setups. <br>  <br>  Cats in the garden? Cats attacking birds near bird feeders? Setup a minefield of Jumpos!<br>  <br>  Jumpos also work well under hummingbird feeders to stop cats from jumping up and catching hummers!<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Here a couple of ideas not shown on the home page: <br>   <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>    <br>    Keep cats from jumping on your car. <br>    <br>      <br>  Cats will get the point! <br>    <br>      <br>  Stop cats from scratching furniture. You can use Jumpos individually like this, or add some expanded trigger setups. You can place Jumpos on kitchen counters, tables, sofa, stereos, televisions and more. Your cat will learn quickly not to jump on those areas. <br>    <br>      <br>  This is a replication of a photo from the tips page. I want you to see all the inexpensive ways to expand the trigger area. This setup uses 5 pieces of cardboard and two Jumpos. If the cat steps on the center area, both Jumpos fire! It makes it tough for a cat to avoid triggering a Jumpo. Many variations are available using cardboard. Thin wood can also be used. <br>    <br>      or get a jumbo tranier!!!!!!<br>      <br>      here is more things you might need in the future:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>      A cat that suddenly stops using the litter box is making a statement: something is wrong.  If your cat won't use the litter box your first call should be to your vet.  It could be illness (a urinary tract infection is a serious illness and requires prompt veterinary care). Once you have ruled out a medical reason other possible causes include; a dirty litter box, change in the type of litter you use, or perhaps something scared her the last time she used the litter box, distress over the introduction of a new pet or baby into the home, or moving to a new home, .   <br>  <br>   Here are a few steps you can make to get your cat back on track:<br>  <br>  Destroy the Evidence – Once a cat has marked an area with urine or feces, the cat may naturally regard it as an appropriate area for relieving itself.  Do all that you can to eliminate any trace of odor from the “trouble spot”.  Clean it thoroughly with a liquid, enzyme cleaner or vinegar.  You can also cover the area with a plastic carpet runner with the spike side up, self-sticking shelf paper placed with sticky side up, or aluminum foil.  If your cat still can’t resist the area, try placing its food there.  Cats are not likely to urinate where they eat.  <br>  <br>  Freshen Up – Your cat’s sense of smell is nearly 1000 times better than yours, so clean the litter box thoroughly and make sure you remove feces and urine clumps daily.  If your cat does not respond to a clean litter box you may need to replace it.  Old litter boxed can become scratched and permeated with a scent your cat finds unpleasant.  <br>  <br>  Make Over your Litter Box – Hooded litter boxes were designed for owners not cats.  Try removing the hoods and rethink the location of the boxes.  They should be in a quiet, out of the way places with convenient access for your cats.  Keep the boxes away from bright lights, loud noises, and vibrations from washing machines or furnaces.  If your home has multiple floors, have a box on each level.  Finally, do not put a litter box near the cat’s food dishes.  <br>  <br>  The Right Litter – Cats prefer fine-grained litter because it is softer on their sensitive paws.  Many of the low-dust scoop-able clay litters on the market today are usually acceptable to your cat.  It is also recommended that you used unscented litter since many cats are repelled by the odor of scented litters. For the same reason, it’s not a good idea to place a room deodorizer or air freshener near the litter box.

ykaO6cuxaa	They don't die from being caught or held.  But I wouldn't recommend keeping one as a pet.  They are very active birds and need a huge amount of room, special diets and conditions only a zoo safely can supply.  They are most likely to die, if kept.  I've held a couple that were in trouble.  One got caught in a garage.  I gently carried it out in my cupped hands and let it go.  Another exhausted itself in an outdoor skylight.  It just lay on my hand for a while until it regained its strength and then took off.|`|bFzu835Aaa	They won't hurt you, you're more likely to injure the bird trying to catch it. They're also very hard to take care of in captivity. It's not that they die fro being caught or waste away indoors, its usually the fact that the people who try to catch one, don't realize how incredibly complicated they are to keep alive. Their diet it very specific and hard to replicate.
TdrgZwnoaa	Dogs are extremely resilient. As long as the dogs lung wasn't punctured it will be just fine in about 2-3 weeks time. It may walk funny for a while because of the discomfort from the ribs. And 99% of the time the ribs will reset themselves. Just remember to keep the dog relatively inactive for a while. If you regularly walk the dog continue to do so; just shorten the interval a bit. <br>   I had a dog with cracked ribs, not broken, and and she lived to a ripe old age after the 'incident'.
R93qp2Zxaa	There are some "spray baths" that are safe to put on cats (make sure as they will lick it off) but not a real bath.  That's not a good plan on a cat.<br>  <br>  Any change of diet etc.?<br>  <br>  I'd say likely it's all ok, especially if it happened once before and went away, but mention it to the vet when you're getting the appointment for the spaying and perhaps they'll have some ideas / quick checks for you.|`|xBcdX9MMaa	Hi there, I don't think you cat is stinky because it's in heat, Yes try giving it a bath and if that doesn't work check with a neighbor or the vet.

Hp2Irez1aa	Hi there <br>  When ever we babysit for friends or relatives the dogs, we always made sure that the main dog or leader of the pack was acknowledged first, to the visitor and we never left them alone together - way to risky with yur back turned. We gave each dog what the other got and made it a special treat time after they got along and played and if needed I did one on one with the aggressive dog that needed some coaching and lots of talking to them and eye to eye contact. Sounds kind of silly but talking to them in a calm voice, petting and eye contact soothed away fears amongst them. As silly as this was, these dogs and other dogs we had liked catnip.....and yes loved to roll around in the smell of it if we sprayed it on a blanket or in a dog bed they loved it.<br>  It neutralized the tension if any existed....just wish I could have got my former spouse to play in catnip! lol <br>  Take care and good luck!<br>  Jen <br>  Ontario Canada..........hey did you see the Obama crowds here on tv? Hotels sold out to see Obama drop in Ottawa Ontario Canada, people went nuts some fainted - I have never seen the crowds rally that much with so many thousands here for a US President and I wish I could have been there! You guys are so lucky over there! Give him time, give him space to move forward and clean things up. I think he's going to do really well - compared to others there!|`|4AoMi1NLaa	take toys for them to play with and some plastic bags so if u take it for a walk u can pick up it's droppings and just be with it all the time u are there and it will be happy!|`|wStPZeEEaa	maybe just bring lots of toys....and keep throwing them until it gets tired?and your not really gonna put that dog in the basement are you?!|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	First of all, take care in introducing the two. The easiest and most efficient way to introduce two dogs is through parallel walking.<br>  <a href="http://www.mastiffonlinecommunity.net/viewtopic.php?t=86" rel="nofollow">http://www.mastiffonlinecommunity.net/vi...</a><br>  <br>  Now, do you mean that you are not used to hyper dogs, or that your Poodle isn't? Is you mean your poodle, make sure that you don't force them to stay together. The Poodle should be allowed to leave at any point for some "quiet time," or s/he is likely to reach a snapping point from the Yorkie's incessant hyperactivity.<br>  <br>  Try to get some supplies from your aunt. For instance, if the Yorkie has a crate, have your aunt bring it. Have her bring his or her favorite toys or blanket. These will make the Yorkie feel more comfortable. (A stressed dog is more agitated and restless than a relaxed one.)<br>  <br>  Yorkies aren't typically very big on exercise, but it would probably really help the energy levels in the house if you could take the dogs out for a bunch of quick walks. Not only will this drain physical energy, it'll help tire them out mentally.<br>  <br>  I assume that your basement isn't dark and dank or anything, and that you don't plan to just leave the dogs down there. It's more like a possible play area, yes? <br>  <br>  Remember to stay calm and patient throughout the day. The energy level you're not used to might try your patience, but seriously, getting frustrated, irritated or otherwise fed up will do absolutely nothing to help the situation. Instead, just calmly find a solution. If the Yorkie won't give up jumping around your feet, play tug or fetch with him or her.<br>  <br>  Try to keep plenty of toys around. It's even better if you have stimulating toys like Kongs or Buster Cubes, which can provide some relieving distraction. (If you don't know what Kongs or Buster Cubes are, you can Google them. They aren't a necessity, though.) <br>  <br>  Minimize the possibility of any fight. You must be careful with any dogs you don't know VERY well. Do not feed them together. Do not give them the opportunity to fight over a toy. Just be careful and mind what's happening at all times.<br>  <br>  If the Yorkie knows any obedience commands, take advantage of them. It's relatively easy to tire out a dog with a barrage of "sit, down, sit, down, sit, down, sit, down, sit, down, sit" exercises. And if s/he doesn't know commands, teach him or her some! It's seriously not difficult to teach a dog a command. Refer to Google for some easy training tips.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
IrdZKYT3aa	Really, I would have taken it to the vet.  At least there they have meds to put him out of his misery painlessly.<br>  As for shooting, how experienced are you?  Do you know the best places to shoot an animal to ensure instant death?<br>  If yes, and you were able to, you probably should have : (<br>  If no, than you made the right choice.<br>  This is a tough choice, one I do not envy you for having to make.  <br>  But something should have been done rather than leaving it there to suffer.|`|5iFNV78Caa	Eh, either way he's dead now. Stop worying about it|`|c720a537294a26363d1792085df262cdaa	in my opinion, i would've wanted to shoot the dog.  if there wasn't anything at all that could have been done for him, then i would have tried to put him out of his misery, and my first choice would be to get him to the vet to be put to sleep humanely, but if that wasn't possible, then i would have done the next best thing.  my husband believes, however, that you should put yourself in the position of the dog and then ask yourself that question...(if i was dying on the side of the road, would i want to be shot?)  but since you didn't shoot him and he's dead i hope you do plan on burying him so that he doesn't lay there and rot.|`|fH0cZIy1aa	Yeah you should've. Two of my dogs got run over by a tractor and my older brother was forced to shoot them. A lot of people will probably say it was the wrong thing to do but they never had to deal with something that horrible. Just seeing a dog covered in blood and hearing it screaming. It really scared me and the kids when that happened to our dogs and i'm really glad my brother killed them so cleanly. Hopefully this sort of thing doesn't happen again.|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	In two hours you could have taken the dog to a vet, or a clean shot to the head or heart would have ended its pain. After all, they shoot horses.|`|fqvLguGCaa	Well, you first went wrong by not doing anything about the poor dog that was dumped by it's owner and left to rot while you watched. <br>  <br>  Don't you think it would have been a good idea to say.. umm... put up fliers, take the dog and try to find it a good home on CL or some adoption site, take it to a non kill shelter............. hmm............. <br>  <br>  Second thing you did wrong was not rush that dog to a vet as soon as it was hit but in stead got your jollies from watching it and deciding whether or not to play target practice on the dog. <br>  <br>  This all would have been avoided if you would have taken in the dog or did something with the dog before it was hit.  Nice work.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  You're a heartless ***** who I hope has to ***suffer*** like that dog did. Karma sucks, you'll get it in the a55 some day soon keep that in mind   :-)   The thought of YOUR KIND getting what they deserves drives me! Psycho|`|P7ZqJXi7aa	Probably should have shot it. I can understand not wanting to do that or not being able to do it.  But I mean to let it suffer is kinda hurting....  I have a stronger stomache than most so i would have ended his misery....  or taken it to a vet if there was one close by.  But if it is not your pet then they probably would have euthanized it anyway.
MstjbpVJaa	The first question I must ask is,Do they have a Nest box because without this then she will never nest,<br>  <br>  Don't look any more , let her settle down for 3-4 days and by this time she could have laid more,if she has then do not disturb her till at least 10 days then only look in the nest,when she is not sitting.<br>  <br>  You will soon know if she has young,they will hatch about 21 days after the last egg is laid.|`|2Ku4DuvCaa	Your female cockatiel doesn't appear to be ready or interested in being a mom. If that's the case, you might want to separate them into different cages for awhile. They can still play together, but perhaps having separate cages will give her time to decide it's time to be a mom.<br>  <br>  Beyond that, make sure both of their needs are being met. Because she's laying eggs, she'll need more calcium. Make sure she has access to a cuttle bone. Make sure they both have large cages, plenty of toys, a healthy diet of pellets and bird friendly fresh foods (just seeds aren't good!), and plenty of time outside the cage to socialize. <br>  <br>  If she doesn't want to take care of her eggs, you can't make her. This is just something that might encourage her to try. I've heard of it working about as many times as I've heard of it not working.|`|j4R5JLBAaa	Cocktiels can lay eggs in anything that looks like a safe nest to them - behind the refrigerator, behind open doors, in any dark corner as long as male approves it first.<br>  <br>  Your bird is still not ready for parenthood, however it cant resist calls of nature or maybe your male's temper;)<br>  <br>  Cocktiels start laying eggs as soon as all favorable conditions met : its warm, safe, bright, humid in your house. Bird start thinking its it mating time; if you keep same conditions year around they will never stop laying, its very dangerous for female bird and can result in death from calcium deficiency.<br>  <br>  Easiest thing to do is to make an "artificial winter" in your apartment. Not the temperature-wise of course, but by shortening the length of their light day. Try to cover your bird's cages when it's light out or when you have bright lights on. You may also consider a winter diet for them as well - cockatiels originated from australian desert, do a little research to see what food they normally can't get during winter there and take it off their menu;)<br>  <br>  Hope this will help;)
AA11457471	I own a LOT of cats & I agree that it may be a little weird & not always the ideal situation BUT:<br>  they are all spayed/ neutered, vetted as needed, regularly groomed....<br>  They all have their claws & my furniture isn't shredded because they have scratch posts, condos & lots of toys & interaction to keep them occupied.<br>  I have litterboxes in the basement & spare room & they are cleaned at least once daily. I may be the "crazy cat lady" but it's important to me that my home doesn't smell like it.<br>  They all manage to find a way to get their fair share of attention- some are bathroom buddies, some are bed buddies, some are couch buddies...<br>  When I accumulated most of them I was a Humane Officer. Unfortunately, I'm now disabled & we've all had to make adjustments.<br>  They don't eat the best food anymore, but then, neither do I. They eat the best I can possibly buy & I haven't added any new cats to the menangerie now that my income has taken such a hard hit.<br>  I practice what I preach & each gets an individual meal twice a day. <br>  I have a drawer full of supplements & meds so they each get what they need to live the best life I can give them.<br>  I used to have 4 dogs too, but i've lost 3 to old age. The one left is 13. As I don't have the physical ability anymore to get dogs exercised the way they should be, I won't get another when this one is gone.<br>  I am NOT a hoarder! I strongly suspect you aren't either. Just know what your limit is!!!<br>  Tell your friends to stick it where the sun don't shine! ; )|`|HuJmTs8xaa	Hey, I have ten, but there are 8 people in my family to take care of them all. I don't think you're a hoarder, just a sweet person, with a kind heart. It's likely that your dogs wouldn't be alive if it weren't for you. Shelters euthanize so often. At least the ones around here do.|`|uSjy6vgnaa	As long as you are looking after them your not doing any thing wrong.  Dogs by their nature like to be part of a family or a pack.  So it is more natural to have a large number of dogs than cats.

Only thing.  Just remember you can never help all the animals so know your limit of how many you can feed and care for.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	As long as your taking care of them, then NO your not a hoarder. I have alot of acreage, and quite a few animals (some were rescues, some were not but I love them all the same). <br>  <br>  Most of those people that have the 200 cats that make tv are the ones that are not taking care of them and the cats are pooping on the carpet, and living in disgusting spaces.|`|zzkmdusEaa	No, that makes you a caring dog-lover.<br>  <br>  We need more people like you!|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	If you have the time and money to do it, that's great!  Just maybe stop at 6, ok? ;)|`|dZCsMyjXaa	It is great that you rescued all those dogs, but be sure to ask yourself - are they all getting a lot of attention, individually? Do you take them all on walks every day? I think that even though you give them good care, you should probably avoid getting any more animals. <br>  If you think you're overwhelmed, consider finding one of them a home with someone you trust to take good care of him/her.|`|g5dzse2Zaa	No way as long as you take good care of your pets it doesn't matter how many of them you have! When i have the money i wish to have four dogs (my substitute for children i think).<br>  Stuff your friends if your happy and they're happy that's all that matters. I think its awsome you rescued all those dogs you definatley do have a big heart!|`|Kwo0ELq7aa	I have 5 dogs and 4 cats all in my house.  3 dogs are Great Danes.  I have rescued 5 of these animals.

4V4m2uZ5aa	Without actually seeing your dog it's hard to figure out what's going on with him. Here are some suggestions I hope they help:<br>  <br>  Buy a crate. I can't stress how important a crate can be to your training and sanity. lol If he's chewing thru doors that is a clear sign you need a crate.<br>  Have him checked out by a vet. Anytime a dog regresses on his potty training you want to make sure there's not a medical reason. <br>  Always make sure when you are reprimanding him for pottying in the house you catch him in the act. If you walk in and the mess is already there it's to late. <br>  As for the chewing on the furniture just keep an eye on him and reprimand him for it.  Remember the key is catching him in the act.This could be a great place to use your crate if you can't watch him then put him in the crate. There are also products that you can buy to put on your furniture to keep your dog from chewing on it. Just go to your local pet store and ask them. Honestly I never had much luck with them but maybe you will. Hopefully he will grow out of the chewing. <br>  <br>  I hope some of these suggestions will come in handy for ya.|`|iNvGnl0Xaa	I bought a full bred shephard and have the same problem, puppy's I guess..... though the dog has stopped chewing things up other then toys.|`|TmUQbODJaa	When he pees, it can be a sign of submission meaning "I am not as important as you- you're a good, very strong and capable leader but I'm sorta scared of you." It is not housebreaking problems. <br>    You can try being more gentle for him, and when he submissively urinates, don't reprimand him, he going to start peeing again. Speak to him gently in a medium toned but soothing voice. It should be like conversation- Hi. How are you? I'm fine, nice weather we're having, eh? Make sure you are not comforting him like a baby- JUST words.<br>    When you reprimand him, don't touch him. Just say NO, in a loud clear, but deep tone.<br>     As for his chewing issue, you can spray the area with Bitter Apple. It is repulsive to dogs. Whenever you catch him chewing, say NO, and give him a chewing. It should work soon. <br>    If it doesn't, you shold put him in a crate. Times change. Leave him there for 5 minutes. Don't pay ANY attention to him. Take him out, praise. Then give him a chewie. Since you don't use the crate, then it is fine. I wouldn't suggest it otherwise becasue the crate is supposed to be his "safe haven". <br>  Tip- cover chewie with masking tape. It tastes good to them. Also when he looks like he is going to start chewing say I WOULDN'T in a growly, deep but strong voice.<br>  Good Luck!|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	Sounds like you are doing the right things the best you can, but I have to ask..Is he a shepard/huskie mix?  If so you have your work cut out for you. My (now) ex brother-in-law had one named Earl. earl was in puppy mode for 5 years, and just a big bundle of energy. Everybody loved Earl as long as they did not have to deal with owning him. We all called him Earl The Pearl. But he was a hand full. Earl has since passed way from old age but he was something else in his day. Good Luck to you with your shepard mix.|`|pJnLRwLFaa	well..I think you have to cage him just until the "restroom" training is done...We always train our dogs in the cage..we let them out and teach them to go when they are outside...If the dog is going outside then coming in he needs more time..tell him repeatedly to "go potty" just keep saying that and pointing..don't talk to it or touch it or praise it until it has done so.|`|qO5woDAgaa	lol wanna beef my red nose pitbull?|`|G4N7cSOYaa	Ha, my puppy is the SAME way. You pretty much described my puppy. Both my dogs have chewed holes in our drywall. My puppy is just now starting to not have many accidents. It seems like it has been forever. You just have to be VERY patient. Some dogs just take longer than others. Maybe starting taking her to training classes like at PetSmart. They can give you good advice too!<br>  <br>  I know I didn't really answer your question, I just wanted to let you know youre not alone! Good luck!|`|ax3ixodEaa	We usually just spank our puppy when she chews on stuff and rub her nose in her poop/pee and make her scrach the door afterwords. then put her outside. she has been chewing on less stuff and is starting to scrach the door when she has to go and it hasent even been a week yet.|`|IaiqsKlvaa	the first thin you can do is go to hotpinkflower.webs.com.thers this thing where u can write and u will get alot of information.u write on guestbook.|`|pxuDr2T4aa	dog training skool pop him on the nose and hes yung so he has alot of energy so mak sure anything dangerous is not around|`|tQ4QlE8Waa	Still too young for them to remember anything.

Also make sure he's being disciplined when he does use the bathroom inside... we always used to rub their nose in it (literally) and then scolded them like a child. Other than that don't know what to say... try discipline and make sure he knows who's the boss of the house...|`|F8825TIRaa	Yes I have herad of rubbing his nose in it & then taking a spry bottle filling it with wate & sparying him with it. Best of luck to you
UIM8X38Oaa	You need to go clean up the moldy stuff.  And go through the whole area.  Yes, some horses will eat it and it is not worth loosing your horse from colic from it.  Some horses won't touch it but you don't want to take that risk.  I would suggest just raking up the good stuff and make sure it is not tainted with mold or dusty and feed that to him.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jenny|`|bI7wMCJXaa	The hay on the floor is NOT good for your horse. It may not LOOK moldy but being on the damp ground - and the ground is damp unless you live in the desert - the hay has absorbed the moisture and is not safe for your horse to eat.<br>  <br>  If there is no other hay to eat your horse will eat bad hay, and get sick, and possibly die. If he is underweight he needs to be checked for melanomas, ulcers, bad teeth, etc. A horse being old is no excuse for him to be thin. Feed better hay, better grain, give him a place with GOOD hay to eat on his own or separate your herd into groups to minimize the competition for hay.|`|ccfeffd151719aa73771808d66461cd2aa	do not give him the chance to get some of the bad hay! he probably wouldnt eat it but would u want to have moldy food on the same plate with what is supposed to be ur dinner?! i wouldnt. and plus u really dont want to take that risk! it could cost him his life!|`|EMYlCPfuaa	he will probably go for the good hay first as you would wouldnt you? the hing is i wouldnt let him havethe moldy hay cos it can make him very sick! <br>  of course depending on how moldy too. if its not too bad, then spread it out on say some fencing wire or similar and hose it off and let dry in sun. you do this to remove mold and by drying it out it helps to ensure the hay doesnt go moldy all over again. it really will only beused for bulking up cos there'll be no real nutrient left in it. <br>  sometimes, just as with good meadow feed, the horse will eat it all because it smells more of the good stuff! if there is weed amongst the good feed they have been known to eat it and it can turn out detrimental to their health. the same would apply to their hay. <br>  just make sure everything is clean and hygienic. and check the hay as you're taking it out. i know you dont want to waste hay but truly if its badly moldy, use it for mulch in tyour garden!|`|9zrHyhknaa	it could make him very sick i would be safe and go through all of the hay and get rid of the moldy hay but by the sounds of it he wont even get to the moldy hay if there is any|`|psNR7hDJaa	Go through all the hay and make sure it isn't moldy! And get rid of all the moldy ones! Even if it's in the middle of the hay stack(Don't be lazy!! Especially when it comes to your horse's health!!).|`|ij3fQSmlaa	Christ, don't do that. If its moldy or damp your horse probably wont eat it. Mine wouldn't.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	most horses will not eat moldy hay, especially if there is good hay available, i know people who feed roundbales to their horse that they leave outside, uncovered all year, the horse throws the moldy hay on the ground and eats what is good on the inside, they have been doing so for about ten years and have never had any of their horses get sick or any side effects from eating moldy hay because they skip the bad hay|`|RloOJ43haa	You cannot guarantee that the horse will not eat the moldy hay even when there is good hay available. If you want to feed this hay to your horse, I suggest you go sweep or pile it up and give him portions only after you have inspected them.

XvqX0Vv5aa	There could be multiple reasons for her behavior. Anything from a simple bad tooth to a more dangerous intestinal obstruction can cause these behaviors.  Due to her age and the amount of time that has passed since she started acting sick, you need to get her to the vet Asap. Also, in the mean time, keep an eye out to see if she is pooping at all in her litter box. I'm not trying to be gross but the vet will want to know if she has had any bowel movements or not. He will also want to know how often she's taking liquids and whether she has thrown up at all over the last few days. Good luck!|`|SLdZPu4Qaa	well there is a huge possibility she is pregnant. feel her belly. don't squish her though. if it is hard or stiffer than usual than she is probably pregnant.if she feels normal you should probably take her to the vet.<br>  <br>     that is the way my cat acted three different times when she was pregnant. she may not be pregnant enough to be hard bellyed but they usually act that way when thay are a ways along.<br>             good luck!!!|`|vyTAJeFsaa	i think she may be constipated. take her to the vets|`|AA10091923	well even at 9 yrs old she could be pregnant...is that a possibility?<br>  <br>  maybe she is just not feeling ok...like we do.....try cuddling with her,<br>  <br>  if all else fails...of course take her to the vet...but it does not sound like an emergency....<br>  <br>  good luck  :)|`|RlATSbfZaa	I think she needs to go to the vet, because of the change in behavior. Cats try to hide it when they're sick. They also stop eating when they're running a temperature. Other than that, if you are feeding her dry food, is it a new bag ? Maybe it's stale or doesn't taste right to her. Will she eat treats? You can also warm her food up so it smells better, add a little water if its dry food. Good luck, and I hope your kitty feels better soon.|`|9G03aQhsaa	Well if she's meowing weird, could she be congested, maybe out of breath?

B6zl0AJDaa	Anytime you have a saddle that is NOT leather, you're dollar value goes down the tubes.

KeevlZnTaa	Pedialyte is not a cure, it is used to keep the animal from dehydrating, since the feces is mostly water. Do not take away the hamsters food. Hamsters are small with fast metabolisms and need food available at all time, or else they will become emaciated.<br>  <br>  Give him a little pedialyte in a bowl. Do not replace his water with pedialyte, as he may not drink it, and then would become more dehydrated. <br>  <br>  You need to get him to a vet ASAP. Wet tail needs to be treated with antibiotics. There is no way to get rid of it without antibiotics. If you do not treat eventually your hamster will become dehydrated, stop eating and die. Your hamster already seems as if he is at a serious point in the illness, and is getting to the point of no return.<br>  <br>  There is a "medicine" in stores, but it is a waste of money b/c it does not work. DO NOT bother with Dri-Tail. Here is a bit of info on Dri-Tail and why it does not work:<br>  Dri-Tail is an over-the-counter drug found in most pet stores to treat Wet Tail. Neomycin is the active antibiotic of Dri-Tail. However, the antibiotic dosage is often not adequate to cure the disease. In fact, without veterinary supervision, Dri-Tail can actually worsen diarrheal symptoms by killing off the hamster's "friendly" or resident bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. This in turn, lowers the ability of the hamster to fight against the disease. Resident bacteria are usually kept in high numbers in healthy individuals, which compete against lower numbers of "intruder" bacteria. In a sense, these resident bacteria play a role in your immune system. Under stress, the number of resident bacteria can lower, thus allowing "intruder" bacteria to invade and thrive. In addition, ineffective antibiotic dosage encourages antibiotic resistance. Dri-Tail is not effective at clearing out the intruding bacteria, thus allowing the pathogens a chance to gain resistance to the drug. Dri-Tail may temporarily relieve symptoms, but the pathogens still remain. As a result, the hamster will become sick again later once the number of the pathogenic bacteria rise up again. At this point, your hamster will be facing an infection that will be even more difficult to treat, as the bacteria developed resistance.|`|PaVyuYVUaa	ok. i have a lot of experience with hamsters. every time i got a hamster i had to watch the first couple days for wet tail. there is a medication you put in there water that helps them. i have a site attached. use it and your hamster will get better. hope your hamster gets better and i hope you and them have a happy life together. hope this helps

And if you get two they won't bond to you.<br>  <br>  How to tell if you have a healthy bird:<br>  <br>  - Active<br>  - Bright eyes<br>  - No discharge from eyes, mouth, nostrils<br>  - No deformities<br>  - Good feathers<br>  - Nice beak<br>  - Clean environment<br>  - Healthy parents<br>  - Good vent (bottom)<br>  - Clean cages<br>  - Fully weaned<br>  <br>  Also, just because a bird isn't the most healthiest, doesn't mean you shouldn't get it. It may need a little bit of extra love and attention, but that little bit will make a HUGE difference!<br>  <br>  How to tell if the bird LIKES you:<br>  <br>  - Snuggle you<br>  - Follow you<br>  - Feel a connection<br>  - Lots of eye contact<br>  <br>  There is so many ways I can't tell. Don't get a bird because of its gender, color, or health. Whichever one yu feel a CONENCTION to is the one you get, nothing else matters.

tz6ksGFkaa	Actually, the other responder is wrong.  You CAN give your dog cooked chicken.  I have also fed lean, drained cooked hamburger.<br>  Hot dogs, deli meats are not good for them.|`|bIaywrBCaa	chicken breast, boiled or baked. Low fat hamburger meat, fried and drained of all fat.

It has loads of preservatives, and it's processed meat, so don't feed it to them all the time.|`|pT0SFrlFaa	Dogs are omnivores so they eat meat and plant material. All meat except the processed stuff is ok for them as long as its not the only thing you are feeding them. meat alone does not give them a balanced diet.|`|Kt0qVNZOaa	Lamb, Venison, Beef, Turkey, duck|`|WPYRSSlQaa	beef liver is good for dogs|`|QLrk3ep9aa	You don't want to cook any meat you give to your dogs. cooking takes away from the nutritional value, and cooked bones can and will splinter.<br>  <br>  Stick to raw chicken to begin with, it is one of the more mild meats. If you do not feed RAW as the main diet, avoid any organs and gamier meat, as it will be too rich for a dog not use to raw meat. Raw chicken is great, beef, pork. Some raw hamburger is a good treat. Throw down a raw chicken drumstick as a treat for a larger dog, or a raw chicken wing as a treat for a younger dog. Bones are very nutritional for dogs, and raw bones do not splinter and cause no harm to a dog at all. A frozen rib on a hot day. Most larger chain stores, such as Walmart, sell packs of pigs feet for cheap, and they are a great treat, although even my big german shepherds can't eat the big bone in the middle of the foot. If you find a cheap cut of meat and you want to feed it, go ahead. There is no type of meat bad for dogs. There are just some you don't want to overly feed, such as organs and game meat for a dog not use to game meat<br>  <br>  EDIT: Dog's are NOT omnivours! they are carnivours! They have the same exact digestive system as a wolf. The only plant matter wolves get is from the organs of the animals they digest. And in larger prey, it is now shown that they do not eat the stomach contents. So no, a dog does NOT need plant matter! They have a very hard time digesting veggies (they can not break down the skin of vegetables), and a lot of fruits are bad for dogs.|`|S8aCj7m7aa	Well technically you can feed a dog ANY type of meat that it isn't allergic to. Dogs are meat eaters...lol....you just don't want it to choke on bones...like chicken or fish bones (use common sense). Then you do always have the possibility of running into a food allergy, so stick to basics, no preservatives or seasoning.|`|YVen9Hdkaa	Yes, all kinds of meats are fine for dogs, just make sure they're not processed meat like hot dogs,<br>  <br>  I was interested in raw food for a while, but one of my vets told me that my poodle & 2 chinese cresteds were so far removed from wolves that I didn't need to feed them that way.  If your dog is more of a "wolf type" then yes, raw food makes sense.  There's some good books on the subject.<br>  <br>  When one of my dogs got heart disease, and couldn't have any salt at all - my vet told me to I had to cook their food from then on.  <br>  <br>  Meat, rice & veg together.  Sort of like a balanced diet.<br>  <br>  Think of the ratios as this - if the dog was hunting, the prey that they would eat would be mostly protein, plus some plant material (from the stomach contents).  The addition of white rice or potato makes it easier for them to digest.  Unfortunately brown rice is a little too hard for them to digest and get enough food value from <br>  <br>  I spent all my time hunting for cheap meat at the supermarket!<br>  <br>  I found frozen ground turkey or ground chicken to be the cheapest - $1.99 or $2.50 a pound in my area.<br>  <br>  The cheapest and easiest way to get ground beef was to buy cheap steaks or roasts, trim off most of the fat, cut it up into small cubes, then grind it up (in small batches) in the food processor.   That way you don't get all that fat from the packaged pre-ground beef.<br>  <br>  Then I would break up all the ground turkey, chicken, or beef.  Dump it in boiling water, cook it for 10 minutes (a little longer for poultry).  Drain it out, add rice & cooked veggies.  I'd cook enough to last for several days.<br>  <br>  For my picky eater who only wanted to eat the meat - I'd pre-mix everything w/egg (kind of like meatloaf), then I made little meatballs with the melonballer. Dropped the meatballs carefully into the boiling water so they wouldn't fall apart.  Cooked them for 10-15 minutes.  They are the perfect bite size for small dogs.<br>  <br>  I thought of mixing the meat, rice, veg & egg together like meatloaf - and actually baking it like meatloaf - then slicing or crumbling it up for them.  But I never got around to trying that yet.  I'm totally happy with the boiling water method.  So simple, and easy to clean the pans (no greasy pans).<br>  <br>  Remember to sometimes cut up the steak (not grind it) and boil it it bite sized chunks, so they actually get to chew on something.  Some variety is good.  Try different kinds of meats or fish.
EJpiaCMQaa	I agree with the first answerer about xyloma being a type of fungus and is highly unlikely in birds.  If your bird has a lump on its wing, it would most likely be a fibrosarcoma, which is a tumor arising from the connective tissue.  It's one of the most common cancers found in pet birds, and often seen on the wing or leg.  It can be treated if found early enough.  I don't know who gave you that information about xyloma, but I would advise having an avian vet take a look at your bird.<br>  <br>  It could also be a lipoma, which is a benign tumor, which can grow very large.
798ff6d0944436a66873f343e3aaeac2aa	I suggest you look into pet breeds, to see if the temperaments, adult size, and necessary care fit into your lifestyle. Once you've looked into pet breeds, you'll have a better idea of what kind of dogs you should be looking for. Look at dogs from local shelters and/or find breeders around your area who are willing to let you come look at the dogs before buying to assure that you're getting the best match for your family.|`|bIaywrBCaa	Please check out the shelters. You might find a small mixed breed there. How old is the son? Small dogs and young kids do not mix well.|`|3p3otDlXaa	I don't know where glendale is, and not any dog breed is okay.

Going to a local shelter or breed rescue is the best option. They usually have puppies, though they have a higher adoption price. Some will ask anywhere from $125-350.<br>  Try www.petfinders.com. Search for the Baby or Young dogs in your local area. Good luck!|`|TRfF23afaa	Try Petco, Petsmart might also have the same service, they do a wonderful job hooking up owners and puppies.

8owlj2xHaa	The turn over rate is based on the display size. 3-5x turnover in a tank. So about 150 gph is what your looking for, but dont forget about head loss. The amount of flow lost due to height putting back pressure on the pump. An Ehiem 1250 would give you about 190  gph  which is perfect. going over the flow rate is fine, when you are talking about flow under 500gph going thru the sump. <br>  For added circulation in the tank use power heads and wave makers. <br>  Never try to get more flow thru the sump  as it makes bubbles harder to deal with. Also you always want to try and match flow the sump with the flow thru a protein skimmer. Going to high will decrease a skimmers effectiveness.

AA10129150	Loud sudden noises can startle a rabbit, but my bunny had no problem with the television or radio being on. Anything that is too loud for you is probably too loud for the bunny. Also look at how your rabbit responds, if your rabbit doesn't like the noise he or she might try and get out. They have very good hearing, my rabbit could hear when food was put into her bowl from wherever she was in the house.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Depends on the rabbit. They do have very sensitive ears, so it's best that you don't allow loud noises around them. I did have one rabbit though that would throw a fit if the music was OFF. He loved country music. When it was off, he would start thumping in his cage, chewing his cage bars, throwing his litter box and food dish around...just being as bad as he can lol. The country music to him was relaxing, and he enjoyed it. The rabbit I have now doesn't seem to mind my tree frogs or feeder crickets making noise...puts him to sleep, actually. If you WISH, you can have some music on low to where it is difficult to hear it when you close the door, and see how your rabbit reacts to it.|`|v1dnnMQuaa	Rabbits don't mind low noise, but they have excellent hearing and are very sensitive to loud, grating sounds, or any sudden noises that would surprise them.

HvbIE03saa	Well, if the former owners said you could have the cat, then it's okay that you have her. I would suggest asking them what vet they took her to and taking her to the same vet.

EWXzNyk8aa	You must be excited - getting a puppy is always fun!<br>  <br>  Here are the vaccinations your puppy needs:<br>  - Parvovirus (hopefully got this at 5 weeks, otherwise he needs it now)<br>  - Combination vaccine without leptospirosis (ages 6 weeks and 9 weeks)<br>  - Rabies (age 12 weeks or older)<br>  - Combination vaccine - including any or all of the following if they are concerns in your area (talk with your vet): leptospirosis, caronavirus, or lyme (age 12-16 weeks)<br>  - Distemper (6-8 weeks, 10-12 weeks, and 14-16 weeks)<br>  - Dewormer (should have been dewormed at 2, 4, and 6 weeks; you should get him dewormed at 8 and 12 weeks, and then a few more times until he is 6 months old - talk to your vet about when to deworm inbetween ages 12 weeks and 6 months)<br>  <br>  Through your dog's adult life he will need the combination vaccine (talk to your vet about how often) which is the same as above, but you add rabies into it also.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Congrats!<br>  <br>  This is how my Vet does it:<br>  6 weeks=distemper/parvo-wormer<br>  8 weeks=DHPPL/wormer<br>  11 weeks=DHPPL/wormer<br>  14-16 weeks=DHPPL/Rabies/wormer
vfhKkiSKaa	I think her upper body looks good, but there is something that bothers me about her legs.  Her pasterns are way to long and straight and I think the problem is that her cannon bones are also way to long.

Those legs are really long, particularly her cannon bones.  And that neck is really long too.  I know you can work on it and muscle it up eventually but it's still too long for the rest of her.  I know you didn't ask about price but...I think $1500 is WAY too much for an unregistered horse with conformation like that.  They are riding on the word "warmblood" and the color.  I know you can find something better than that for the money.|`|z6OqBkBGaa	shes gorgeous!!~ i think she would make an excellent hunting prospect!!~|`|eXDDODfHaa	she looks really pretty|`|jzKS5pxkaa	shes gorgeous and probably will be an excellent jumper (she is a warmblood) dont let those people bring you down about painted colors as higher class jumpers they can all do it.

BI1GbIZUaa	A square saddle pad works best. You just sit on it and it'll stay because of your weight on it. if it slides back then it means that you're sliding back.

The playful action of the Toller retrieving a stick or ball along the shoreline arouses the curiosity of the ducks offshore. They are lured within gunshot range, and the dog is sent out to retrieve the dead or wounded birds.<br>  <br>  This medium sized, powerful, compact, balanced dog is the smallest of the retrievers. The Toller's attitude and bearing suggest strength with a high degree of agility. He is alert, determined, and quick, with a keen desire to work and please.<br>  <br>   Many Tollers have a slightly sad or worried expression when they are not working. The moment the slightest indication is given that retrieving is required, they set themselves for springy action with an expression of intense concentration and excitement. The heavily feathered tail is held high in constant motion while working.<br>  <br>  The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever Club (USA) feels strongly that all Tollers should have these innate abilities, and encourages all Tollers to prove them by passing an approved Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever Club (USA) field test. <br>  <br>  Size, Proportion and Substance <br>  Size: Height at the withers - males, 18-21 inches. The ideal is 19 inches. Females, 17-20 inches. The ideal is 18 inches. Bone: is medium. Weight is in proportion to height and bone of the dog. The dog's length should be slightly longer than height, in a ratio of 10 to 9, but should not give the impression of a long back.<br>  <br>  Head <br>  Skull: The head is clean-cut and slightly wedge shaped. The broad skull is only slightly rounded, giving the appearance of being flat when the ears are alert. The occiput is not prominent. The cheeks are flat. The length of the skull from the occiput to the stop is slightly longer than the length of the muzzle from the stop to the tip of the nose. The head must be in proportion to body size. Expression: The expression is alert, friendly, and intelligent. Many Tollers have a slightly sad expression until they go to work, when their aspect changes to intense concentration and desire. Eyes: The eyes are set well apart, slightly oblique and almond in shape. Eye color blends with the coat or is darker. Eye rims must be self-colored or black, matching the nose and lips. Faults: large round eyes. Eye rims and/or eyes not of prescribed color. Ears: The high set ears are triangular in shape with rounded tips, set well back on the skull, framing the face, with the base held slightly erect. Ear length should reach approximately to the inside corners of the eyes. Ears should be carried in a drop fashion. Ears are short-coated, and well feathered only on the back of the fold. Stop: The stop is moderate. Muzzle: The muzzle tapers in a clean line from stop to nose, with the lower jaw not overly prominent. The jaws are strong enough to carry a sizeable bird, and softness in the mouth is essential. The underline of the muzzle is strong and clean. Fault: dish face. Nose: The nose is fairly broad with the nostrils well open, tapering at the tip. The color should blend with that of the coat, or be black. Fault: bright pink nose. Disqualification: butterfly nose. Lips and flews: Lips fit fairly tightly, forming a gentle curve in profile, with no heaviness in the flews. Bite: The correct bite is tight scissors. Full dentition is required. Disqualifications: Undershot bite. Wry mouth. Overshot by more then 1/8 inch. <br>  <br>  Neck, Backline, Body <br>  Neck: The neck is strongly muscled and well set on, of medium length, with no indication of throatiness. Backline: Level. Faults: roached or sway back. Body: The body is deep in chest, with good spring of rib, the brisket reaching to the elbow. Ribs are neither barrel shaped nor flat. The back is strong, short and straight. The loins are strong and muscular, with moderate tuck-up. Fault: slack loins. Tail: The tail follows the natural very slight slope of the croup, is broad at the base, and is luxuriant and well feathered, with the last vertebra reaching at least to the hock. The tail may be carried below the level of the back except when the dog is alert, when it is held high in a curve, though never touching the body. Faults: tail too short, kinked, or curled over touching the back. Tail carried below the level of the back when the dog is gaiting.<br>  <br>  Forequarters <br>  The shoulder should be muscular, strong, and well angulated, with the blade roughly equal in length to the upper arm. The elbows should work close to the body, cleanly and evenly. When seen from the front, the foreleg's appearance is that of parallel columns. The pasterns are strong and slightly sloping. Fault: down in the pasterns. Feet: The feet are strongly webbed, slightly oval medium in size, and tight, with well-arched toes and thick pads. Front dewclaws may be removed. Faults: splayed or paper feet.<br>  <br>  Hindquarters <br>  The hindquarters are muscular, broad, and square|`|nPuZVGFRaa	<a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/novascotiaducktolling.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/novascotiadu...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nsdtrc-usa.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nsdtrc-usa.org/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/breeds/nova_scotia_duck_tolling_retriever/" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/breeds/nova_scotia_du...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia_Duck-Tolling_Retriever" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia...</a>|`|c3cVJXioaa	I wish I had a a nova scotia duck-tolling retriever.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	wilipedia or do they have a website you can log on to
xyPpruSjaa	Hi, I used to have rats :]<br>  <br>  Anyway, it should be fine if you put a little bin on the bottom with bedding in it! Also, some owners use fleece blankets or towels instead of bedding, but you always have to wash them when you clean out the cage. I'ts your choice whether you want to use fleece blankets/towels or a bin with bedding. If you use a bin, just make sure it's one that fits in the cage well. Good luck!! :D!|`|JNnSMh64aa	They don't need bedding. Like you said, I would just put a bin with some shavings in it in the cage.

0c5e60ce4b8fdd00c644bddf68b7f9caaa	The writings in the Foster's adds are pretty thorough. The things that you need to learn would be how to provide the water,biotope and live foods for these fish. That will require two or three books and some more research. The sort of information that you will get on a forum such as this will be incomplete and sketchy,as well as contradictory at best. These are fascinating animals,but are a step up in difficulty over the average aquarium fare. I guess what I'm getting at is the ads tell you what you need to know about the fish,now you must learn how to provide those requirements and this is going to require some study. If you can find an experienced soft water aquarist in your area it would be a good start.
im3vWyv6aa	We have rescued Huskies for 15 years. They are a very challenging dog to own. Containment is a constant battle as they are escape artists. Our Huskies could climb fences, dig under fences, open gates and break through any under wire electric fence - it just doesn't matter. Once they get free they are completely deaf. Our female Huskies would always come back after an hour or two - our male Huskies we would have to go look for (they each had their favorite neighbor to visit.) If you get one, be sure your neighbors will be friendly about visits and that they will call you when they are blessed with a visit. We had one neighbor that would call and say, "Juneau is here, right now we are eating breakfast together... I will bring him home when we're finished."<br>  <br>  They will keep your yard free of any 4 legged critter - you will find trenches dug as they follow the path of a mole. They also love to dig BIG holes to sleep in.<br>  <br>  Now, having said all that they are the most wonderful dogs. They have very beautiful souls. They love everyone and welcome all thieves (not good guard dogs). They are wonderful with children - our 4 children couldn't do ANYTHING to upset them. Our rescued Huskies had horrible past lives - but still we never saw any kind of aggression in them to indicate it.<br>  <br>  Huskies do not bark, but they will howl. However, the only time we heard anything out of our Huskies is if there was something (an animal they needed to catch) in our yard.<br>  <br>  Be prepared for serious shedding. You will find "tumbleweeds" of fur floating around your yard and house. The worst kind of shedding I've ever seen in a dog. I'm talking HUGE cotton balls.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this will help with your decision making. If you decide to get one, be sure you're up for the challenge. As challenging as they are, they are also a very rewarding pet.|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  The Siberian Husky is a beautiful breed with a thick coat that comes in a multitude of colors and markings. Their blue or multi-colored eyes and striking facial masks only add to the appeal of this breed, which originated in Siberia. It is easy to see why many are drawn to the Siberian's wolf-like looks, but be aware that this athletic, intelligent dog can be independent and challenging for first-time dog owners. Huskies also put the "H" in Houdini and need a fenced yard that is sunk in the ground to prevent escapes.<br>  here's more info:<br>  <a href="http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=713810205926675480233580916630" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=713810205926...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|7vJNHaskaa	They can be really insane dogs if you don't know how to train them right. They need a lot of mental stimulation and a lot of exercise. They are very smart and can escape out of pens/fences and things like that. And they are pretty stubborn too.<br>  <br>  This doesn't apply to all people, it's just that a lot of people get their first dog and find out it's a lot more than what they thought it would be, and then they have a dog that's out of control.|`|53giV6PFaa	All the above answers are correct.  Also, keep in mind about the shedding.  They require lots of grooming.  Mine is going through a "blowing the coat" stage right now.  I have never had a dog with this much shedding.  He's my 5th dog - others weren't huskies.  It's just takes patience.  <br>  <br>  Other than all of the negatives you hearing.  They are great dogs.

They are so much more than just beautiful dogs.  The link above will explain it all.|`|jZGg0gNKaa	They are extremely smart and because of this they can be more stubborn then anything. Most take slow to housebreaking, they are escape artists and diggers. They shed like crazy. They need to be excersied daily (mentally and physically.) Often they will run out of the front door (or escape out the back yard) and won't come back when called. Most don't do what you ask unless they see a reason for it. Most are dumped at shelters because of these main problems. You have to know what your doing and you need to know how to make boundaries and stick to them.<br>  <br>  EDIT: not saying that no first time owner could ever handle them, but they need a lot of work. Training, crating, and boundaries are a necessity for these guys. Most people are captivated by their beauty and buy on impulse to find out these dogs are way more then they bargained for.
lNzhglLFaa	i would wait a couple of days after feeding her (like if you fed her Thurs. wait till Sat or Sun to hold her) so you know that she wont regurgitate her food... maybe till the lump goes down a bit?|`|AZKbJESUaa	It is a myth that  the size of the cage will determine the growth of a reptile. They will just keep growing there whole life and don't stop though they do slow down but this is a natural slow down and has nothing to do with the size of the cage. <br>  <br>  If you fed her Thursday wait until about Saturday or Sunday to hold it again.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	give her time-they will ussually start moving about when can be handled
yUbS5Ou0aa	My hamsters cage door was latched shut with a thick metal wire because she would throw all of her weight on it and break out. We also used trash bag ties.<br>  <br>  hope i helped!|`|TrEDiWR7aa	the latch that came with the cage..<br>  in your case i would suggest one of those mini colored clip key ring thingys to keep it secure(:|`|xyPpruSjaa	Hello! I used to have rats and they could easily push the door open and escape. I used those little clamping clip thingies that are used to hold papers together, etc. I used the ones in the third row....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.germes-online.com/direct/dbimage/50098543/Clip___Binder___Bulldog___Magnetic_Bulldog_and_Spring_Letter__.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.germes-online.com/direct/dbim...</a><br>  <br>  Safety pins work very very well too! Good luck :'D
uJJfco2Iaa	Actually they don't have to be fan tails but they can. veil just means long. Veil tail means long tail XD so yeah. A common goldfish can also be veil. Btw fantail veils are SOOOO pretty!!!|`|NoOM7eZnaa	They're simalar, but different. Veiltails have very long tails and fantails generally just have tails that look like a fan. I personally consider both varieties as offshoots of Ryunkins, but not a lot of people would agree with me.
lNzhglLFaa	i would assume so.. they are also nocturnal so maybe try later in the day to play with your hammy ham.|`|7j3l8EJZaa	Yes, they start sleeping more, and lose interest often around age 1 1/2.|`|ICCP8m26aa	Hamsters are more energetic when they are younger. They lose joint muscles when they get older. I suggest that you get vitamin food for them. It will help, a bit.|`|oNHtVHzsaa	yes... they seem to get lazier. they don't have as much energy. you should still give them the same oppurtunity to exersize, but don't push your hamster. good luck and say hi from Maya|`|JNnSMh64aa	Yes they do. As they get older, you should provide safer and easier toys. Get tunnels or bowls full of dirt, something that an old hamster can play with easily.|`|kBn3UsjTaa	Yes they are still interested but you should make sure they are more friendly for thwir age and safter! :)|`|soVgzyvHaa	Yes.  About a month ago, my teddy bear past away.  I noticed that once he got older, he absolutly never ran on his wheel or played with his toys. Hope This Helps|`|bR1jDMDRaa	Yes, becuase when they are younger they are more energetic then when they are older.|`|kO2bbNghaa	Yes as sometimes there joints may get a bit sore. See if you could get some calcium tablets for it.|`|yh6na9Ycaa	I own a Teddy hamster. He is 3 1/2 years old, and LOVES toys|`|HW8ybM2Paa	yes, probably, i recommend the little igloos!
F0UF9DDeaa	You sound responsible enough, but you are involved in a lot of activities. You sound like you may be away a lot. Would this be a inside or outside job, when you go to college, will the dog be excepted in the dorms or apartment you will be living in, and are you ready to put a life equal to yours in order to take proper care? These are questions you need to ask yourself. Dogs are somewhat like children. They will be around for 10 to 15 maybe more years. You need to be sure that you are ready for a responsibility of that magnitude. If you are then I say get a dog, but now you need to figure out what type of dog best suites your life style. I think that is the most important question. What type of dog. For a first timer, may i suggest the dashhound or datsun aka winnie dog. They are very easily house trained, if you get the miniture they max weight is 6 lbs normally and they do not shed. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your new addition and keep us informed on your adventures.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Impossible to tell.. Just cause you get good grades doesn't mean you<br>  would be a good dog owner.. Are you responsible ? Willing to give up time to make sure your dog gets enough exercise, training and socialization? Do you have enough time for a dog? You sound like you are pretty busy now and will be even more so when going to University. What will happen to the dog when you go off to school? <br>  Can you afford good quality dog food, and preventative health care? Can you afford it if the dog has an emergency ?<br>  <br>  Dogs will not wait to go out til you are ready. They will not sit around and wait for you to pay attention.. a bored dog can be a destructive dog, either to your home or itself. Do you have enough time and energy to attend school, take care of other things in your life and dedicate time and energy to a dog each and every day... whether you feel like it or not?|`|qJXdyUY3aa	I think you sound pretty responsible, but how much are you home during the day/week? What's your daily/weekly schedule like?  If you leave early in the morning and don't get back until the evening every day, then that leaves your dog at home alone without you for a long time.|`|0SHAY9TQaa	You don't want any negative comments? Then how can we help you?<br>  <br>  Dogs are a lot of time, work, and commitment. How do your parents feel? Listen to them--they know you best.<br>  <br>  Adopt from petfinder.com<br>  <br>  Good Lck!|`|rMhJceVuaa	yea for sure!|`|imKCvvFKaa	no. your life seems a little too busy! you don't seem to have the time. i'm 17 and i love my puppy. he's my responsiblity and he'd take up a lot of your time and you seem to help your parents alot. unless you get a small dog, a dog can be pretty destructive and bored if he doesn't get at least 2 hour walks at least 2 times a day and plus 15 minutes training 3-4 times a day, and feeding it and stuff. and he's perfectly awesome. i paid ofr his vet, his insurance, his bones, toys, sometimes i stay without money for him. and my family helps me, even after they said hes your responsiblity only you'll buy him food, you'll pay for this and that.. (i pay for everything, they just look after him , or buy him his canned foods once in a while, i get the sack) it's time consuming, you keep your room clean? anoth erproblem, unless you get a dog that doesn't shed as much either|`|o2FJIXS9aa	Because you seem responsible, my answer is yes. You do have to realize that dogs are the kind of animal that can't be left alone for too long by themselves, and require a lot of attention. They need to be walked, have attention paid to them. I was raised with dogs (I know that sounds weird but I was) and my family always considered our dogs as part of the family. As an adult I have always had cats. They are  good pets for me because I am not home all the time and don't require the attention that a dog does. I say get a dog, preferably from a shelter, those are the ones that need a home the most. Your best friend will probably love watching TV with you.|`|mCEKMWTYaa	You sound like a responsible person at home and school but owning a dog is another huge responsibility!  If you feel like you can do it that is wonderful for now.  Also think about the future for you and for the dog because a dog probably cannot go with you when you go to college!  I hope you make the right decision for you and your family.|`|cTuaFrYiaa	If you have to come to YA to ask this type question then no you shouldn't have a dog. I fear if you get one you will have to ask YA if you should feed it of walk it.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I would have to say no because of everything you have going already.  Being responsible means knowing your limits.  Dogs and pups need time, a lot of it.  I don't see where you'd have a lot of free time for a dog.|`|1aee9196e19b183947c5fd70d396dd1daa	i think you are in the position where you could be responsible to have a dog!|`|6hvf02Eyaa	Well question is do you have the time it would require.. If so I would say you GO GIRL!|`|4c047641be778d779abfa8ec0d667d8caa	So far so good, but who is going to take the dog out or on walks when you are at Kumon, taking piano, going to chinese school, etc?<br>  Are your parents willing to drive you to the vets office?  Who will be paying for vet visits, food, toys and etc...  <br>  <br>  Are you going to have time to enroll and participate in classes with your new dog?   <br>  <br>  What will you do with your dog when you go to University?<br>  <br>  I think a super great idea is to foster a dog for the local rescue or shelter in your area.  That way you can show your parents that you are responsible and can take care of a dog.  You will also see how to balance your time with out making such a huge commitment for life.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ErjSVRkqaa	A dog has nothing to do with good grades and piano lessons. I'm rather "slow" as my teachers call me to my face. My GPA is like 2.7 and I take better care of my dog than any of my friends who are on honor roll....a dog takes a different type of responsibility, love, devotion, and trust. I know you can take care of a dog-if you truly want this dog and you love this dog it will become like your child. You would give anything for him/her.|`|cs0YDOTbaa	the question is not really how responsible you are i think. it has more to do with your ability to love something unconditionally.  the dog will love you no matter what.  but you can't ever get mad at the dog for being a dog, because they don't come equipped with human etiquette... which can be frustrating.  <br>  <br>  they are good for you though.  if you love the dog, the responsibilities will pretty much sort themselves out as they present themselves.  it's pretty straightforward.<br>  <br>  the one thing i would really consider though is the next few years of your life.  i got a dog a couple of years ago, and although i regret it in no way, shape or form, it has occurred to me on several occasions that if i didn't have a dog i would be just a little freer to do what i want when i want to do it.|`|loFKGeI8aa	well, i just got a dog and it's ALOT of work. you might be able to handle it, but you absolutely can't do it by yourself. if you have so many activities to do, you  might not have time to be with it. it depends how old you are, since i don't know.|`|CX7o9faQaa	I've seen you grow up and know how well you can handle a big responsibility like caring for a dog. I know that in your heart you are a kind and caring person and will give a dog the love and attention they need. Good luck! I know you can do it!|`|CF5Tc8mnaa	I think you can do it just remember it is a lot of work and a lot of responsibility in taking care of a dog.  Make sure you are ready for it ok good luck.|`|xzMfrcPvaa	You seem like a pretty responsible person. As long as you know what you are committing to and prepare for all the challenges and the costs of caring for these loving animals, I think you can do it!|`|w7XNcmihaa	I think you seem very responsible and patient! (:<br>  <br>  You would be a wonderful dog owner, as long as you have enough time to play and care for it every single day !|`|dCHd0FX7aa	I would say no! Becuase you have alot on your plate, I don't want you to be stressed out. You seem like a good dog owner, but it also seems like your really buzy, and having a dog is a big responceablity|`|SrRsoLfmaa	I think if you are home enough that you would walk and feed and bath and be able to afford a dog yes you have a great life it sounds like and a dog would just make it ten times better!!|`|Mr7sJyUMaa	yes you are a good dog take-carerer|`|43CAj5M8aa	An animal can be a big responsiblity. It's almost as big as having a child. At least a child understands you when you tell it not to pee on the rug. With all that you listed I don't see why you wouldn't be a responsible dog owner. They can be alot of work. You have to always be there to make sure they don't need food, water, walked, and they need alot of attention. I am a dog lover. I have three dogs and one cat. I will say that the cat is easier to care for. They're a little more independent. Still nothing beats my dog laying at me feet. They can be the best friend in the world to you. I don't know of any friends that you can yell at and hit with a newspaper, and five minutes later they're licking your toes. Is your family supportive of you getting a dog. They'll have to help with it while you're at school and events.|`|brrTzyt9aa	If you have never taken care of a dog in your life, then you might not get along with dogs that much. But if you really want one, I would start out with a small little dog. You should try getting one that is small, friendly, and easy to take care of. If you don't think that you can handle a dog, then you should wait and see if you change your mind on getting a dog. If you go to a pet store and you don't like the dogs, I think your next option should be a cat. Cats are way easier to take care of than a dog. I think cats are really easy going and maybe you should get a cat instead.  <br>  <br>  I hope that I helped!!!!|`|l23ttRePaa	Well speaking as an older adult that's had dogs most of my life ... they are lots of work.<br>  <br>  Do you plan of getting a puppy? If so, you had to consider that it has to be house trained unless you plan to leave it outside. Mine were always indoor small dogs .. mostly Chihuahua's and or Chihuahua mixed. They are very hard to train and males are the worst. They will hike their leg on anything in their path and leave urine stains with horrible odors as well. Not to mention that they will deposit other little gifts for you to clean up as well.<br>  <br>  If you are not going to be home very much ... it's going to be very hard for you to care for the animal, assuming it's an indoor one. However an outside pet would be a different matter and you wouldn't have to worry about the above.<br>  <br>  Also it would depend on the size of dog you adopted. A large dog leaves lots of eliminations and it really piles up very fast. We've had a black lab as well. Needless to say there would be lots of clean up even with that one being outside esp. in summer if there are flying insects.<br>  <br>  There's so much for you to consider in owning your own dog. I love dogs but would not have a male after experiencing all that I have with both animal sexes. A female can also leave deposits for you but it will not be all over the furniture which is a plus.<br>  <br>  The house training is the biggest issue for the dog/puppy unless you're planning to get a full grown dog that someone has already trained & that's a good possiblity also. My son and family did get one from a military family that had to give their's up, a pretty blonde golden retriever that was already trained and very good natured.<br>  <br>  Well, I don't know if any of this has helped you in any way, but it's a big responsibility having a pet. To care for, groom, clip nails, feed and play with plus take it for walks etc.<br>  <br>  The best to you whatever you choose to do and have a great evening.|`|oz4c1aX8aa	I think everyone should have a dog at some point, But if you get a puppy they are a lot of work and training.  I think that a puppy may be a mistake,   However I would say adopting an adult dog may not be as bad,   They are much calmer and happy alot of the time to just relax with you.   You do seem like a very busy and motivated person.  <br>  Also I would recommend picking a dog that is right for you... Animal Planet has a show on called dogs 101  that goes through breeds their characteristics and what they are and are not good for. <br>  Meaning if they are high or low maintenance, a single person dog or a family dog, etc.   <br>  I wish you a lot of good luck.|`|wRPfk2bzaa	Depends on your age, if you dont have a job then you cant have a dog because you need to pay for its food and stuff. Unless your parents are going topay for it. But i wouldnt get one if u have all that going on the dog might feelneglected because your always busy.
5PsKGss7aa	Talk to the neighbors.<br>  Sounds as though that dog needs more exercise to run off that excess energy he has built up and can only seem to release it through barking....<br>  If they dont do anything then you will just have to file a noise complaint through animal control.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Well if your neighbor isn't aware of this dog's barking all the time, you should bring it to their attention and ask them to quiet the dog down.  If nothing happens with this, then report it to the police as a disturbing the peace complaint.  If they don't help call the humane society and see if they will do anything about it.|`|6hvf02Eyaa	The dog wants you to play more than likely or at least give it attention. I would talk to the neighbors and tell them  you have homework and stuff and the dogs barking is annoying could they please give it some indoor time after 4 or 5 pm. The dog may be lonely also you can ask if you wish if the dog would be friendly enough to possibly take it for a short walk a few times a week.|`|1aee9196e19b183947c5fd70d396dd1daa	my neighbors dogs are like that too, they bark late at night and are really loud so one night my dad just went over and talked to them and its been getting a little better since. just try talking to them asking them if there is anything they can do about it since you dont wanna hear their dogs barking and being a pain the the butt all hours of then night!|`|V5ZpqRs8aa	I live in an apartment building and then people above me got a dog and it would bark 24/7 and it would pee up there and the pee would drizzle down and it was sooo gross.

WE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR AND TRIED TO GET THEM TO BRING HIM IN OR SOMETHING BUT WE ENDED UP CALLING THE COPS AS MUCH AS WE DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT TO OUR NEIGHBOR. WE HAVE NOT HAD THE PROBLEM SENCE.|`|xzMfrcPvaa	You should talk to them about it and see what they can do. If they're respectful of their neighbors, they would try to solve the problem.|`|dCHd0FX7aa	Call the cops, or talk to them|`|0fKQhIX0aa	if the neighbors dog is spending the majority of its time in the backyard....by itself, its bored out of its mind.  dogs usually bark to get the attention of someone or something.  sometimes they bark b/c they are cold, hungry, wet, thirsty, need shelter, etc.  is everything ok with the dog? assess the situation.  are you a dog person that would be able to ask your neighbors if you can walk or play with the dog to help cure its boredum?  <br>  <br>  also check into your local animal laws.  is there a barking dog ordinance or an adequate shelter ordinance? (are there any welfare concerns or violations?)|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	You have the right to a quiet neighborhood. The owner of the dog should not leave it out to hang around and get bored enough so you are the only moving thing in its sight.<br>  <br>    The next time the dog is out making noise, call the animal control officer and report it.  They don't have to use your name, they can say it was reported anonymously, or that they observed the dog making noise.  In fact, the ACO will most likely park nearby, and listen for the dog to bark.<br>  <br>    And then they will get a ticket, and a stern lecture.  There are local ordinances against barking dogs disturbing the peace, and you pay the animal control officer to enforce them.

4c047641be778d779abfa8ec0d667d8caa	I think it is great that your dogs are so healthy and a 22 year old Chihuahua shows you are doing something correct!!!!<br>  George Burns lived to or almost 100 and smoked cigars and drank everyday, so something has to be said for genetics as well.<br>  <br>  When dogs eat grass it is USUALLY because they have an upset stomach.   There is something in the new blades/shoots that will help easy or make them expel the problem.<br>  <br>  You have a few choices to help with the heat/acid.....you can speak to the vet about Famotidine (drug name for Pepcid A/C).  <br>  <br>  Another is to  use food as medicine and supplement things like cucumber, watermelon and duck to help cool the heat.  This is food therapy used by Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine and/or Holistic vets. <br>  <br>  Keeping your dog on the same diet with no variety WILL cause an excess or deficiency of something over time.  This is a fact!  It doesn't matter what commercial food you feed IF it is the same brand, flavor and type it will have an issue at some point happen.<br>  <br>  Try adding a small amount of wet food or raw to their diet after you have discussed the possibility with the vet.  Famotidine is a safe medication to use and even to see if it will help.<br>  <br>  Do you add any supplements to your dogs diets?  Like digestive enzymes, probiotics or an all in one such as Nupro?|`|43CAj5M8aa	That is normal behavior for dogs.

Wow! But anyway, my guess is that they are bored, or simply like how grass tastes. Sometimes dogs will eat grass if they have the instinctive need to increase their fiber in their diet. Now if the grass has been treated with chemicals and your dogs are eating it, that's a whole different ball game. Not a good one, either.|`|ydshiNrKaa	There actually appears to be two types of grass eating behavior in dogs. Some dogs take a few nibbles, while others eat quickly, barely chewing the grass. Unchewed grass often translates to near instant vomiting. Dogs that are careful grazers, on the other hand, may not get sick from grass.<br>  <br>  The latter case suggests that some dogs eat grass because they enjoy it. Most dogs don’t need it to supplement their diets, but because dog diets are primarily made up of herbivores, that grassy taste may be reminiscent of the cattle or lamb product they had for dinner. Some dogs also enjoy green vegetables like broccoli.<br>  <br>  If your dogs eat grass on a regular basis, this could suggest dietary imbalance, though many vets might dismiss it. You may want to consider giving the dogs some green vegetables if they appear to want “something green.” Cooking the vegetables first may make them more digestible, resulting in less vomiting.<br>  <br>  It’s also important to be careful when your dogs eat grass regularly. Grass from manicured lawns can contain fertilizers and pesticides, which can be toxic to dogs. Instead of allowing “grazing” behavior on lawns, consider providing some doggy grass at home that is not treated with chemicals. Also, if your dogs eat grass all the time, don’t walk them on lawns that have been recently treated with chemicals. Most of these chemicals will break down in a few days, but during the first day or two after treatment, grass-eating behavior could translate to more than tummy upset.<br>  <br>  If your dogs eat grass as a new behavior, and are exhibiting frequent vomiting, it’s also important to check with a vet. A dog that suddenly begins to have a taste for grass may be trying to compensate for gastrointestinal problems. This could signify viral or bacterial infections and might require veterinary treatment. On the other hand, when dogs eat grass only occasionally, you can chalk this up to normal canine behavior. A mouthful of grass or two may mean cleaning up some nasty dog messes, but it is unlikely to signify poor dietary health or illness.

They also get in trouble once in a while like kids :o)|`|yc4y7yKkaa	Why do men act like dogs and expect their wives to clean up after them like children?|`|YLYAo2zmaa	Why do men treat their hoo hoos like separate entities?|`|AA11244754	for the same reason some men do it, to us they ARE our babies.|`|7ViHb7cwaa	Personally; because my dogs are my companions and they are always excited to see me when I come home, are never mad or upset at me even when I feel like everyone else is, and are just so happy-go-lucky.

I treat it as such, It is a working dog who has helped me on many occasions and I am a woman and would never let my dog sleep on the couch, give it a bath in the house in warm weather, let it disobey me, or let It be spoiled. I love my dog a lot, but It is a dog not my baby. that sickens me just saying dog and baby in the same sentence, like some people saying to their son "where's your brother" then pointing at a maltese in a back pack dressed as a person. Sickening<br>  <br>  EDIT: my dog is family, but it is a dog.|`|VkFDAQ46aa	hmm. thats a good question. couldnt answer that for sure, seeing as im not a woman. however i do think some of them go a little overboard. no offense.|`|2YHpV9koaa	Women have motherly instincts and they rock|`|OBh7uEd1aa	dont know but my old bird dogs enjoy it for job well done|`|DeUuipSBaa	They are babies.

MUfMJYHGaa	He's got a great rear which is what he'll need to get over a fence. He looks a lot like a jumper I had who could go right to the bottom and pop over  or go long and launch. You'll never know what he can do till you put this horse over some fences. A horse needs the heart and drive to do eventing. If he's sound and can clear some fences well in a jump alley, consider him|`|MxIQkMUxaa	Cute! Except the neck is too short to be of any real good balance. When doing cross country with the reins at the buckle, you want to have a horse that's going to have good balance going that quickly over such tough fences. <br>  Nice short back though. That's excellent for jumps<br>  The shoulder is also very straight... not very good for lengthening the strides and good bending in dressage.<br>  Besides that it's alright... <br>  <br>  I might say go for a "longer" looking horse for eventing. Especially in upper levels. But for novice or anything he'd be fine!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck in your search!|`|jzKS5pxkaa	its from petfinder so never actually know the personality and in my opinion he's built more like a QH rather than TB as in he's built a little more heavily than most<br>  <br>  he is cute though and sure does look like a jumper and because of the QH build could be good for probably anything|`|TTLIp8Beaa	-tiny feet (bad)<br>  -short neck (also bad)<br>  -long back (bad again)<br>  -nice shoulder (good)<br>  -weak hind/rump (bad)<br>  -high withers (bad)<br>  -nice pasterns (good) <br>  -short gaskin (good)<br>  <br>  personally i don't think he would make it to be a good eventer. maybe a good english pleasure or hunter under saddle, but he's not really built for jumping or dressage.|`|UZBl63blaa	NOT MUCH SHOULDER AND VERY STREIGHT IN THE HIND LEGS,MAKING HIS JUMP NOT AS SCOOPY AS YOUD LIKE, TAKE NO NOTICE OF STEPH AS NONE OF WHAT SHE PUT IS CORRECT OR FUNDAMENTAL .

I would actually peg him as better suited for hunters. The rugged warmblood look is very in right now and I would bet he has a large stride just by judging the size of shoulder. I like how his withers are a little taller than his hindquarters -- horses who are built "uphill" are traditionally better jumpers. As far as eventing goes... that is more of an all around sport and harder to judge if a horse will be good for it just going by their conformation. I would say he looks like he could be an all around guy once he lost a few pounds and got in shape, but you would have to see him go to be sure. Also keep in mind that he is only five and should not be begin jumping hard for another 1-2 years.|`|vfhKkiSKaa	If he is sound I don't see any reason why he could not be an eventer.  He is very nicely put together.
mGgvW4xhaa	Breed doesn't matter at all. But you do have to consider what kind of discipline you want to ride, like English or Western. Some breeds are better at western than they are in english or the other way. Of course there are other disciplines, but it's all up to you.  A good gender for you would be a gelding. They aren't as out-of-control as stallions and not as moody as mares.|`|9zrHyhknaa	im am your same age and my parents wont buy me a horse i ride my grandparents. but you could manby get them to get a rescue or find a cheep one they are hard work but you get lots of exercise riding and taking care of them for a first time horse manby get a quarter horse a calm mare. you would have to live on a farm or acrage or you have to find a bording center or get a job to help pay for one|`|ij3fQSmlaa	Can you ride? <br>  Try joining a riding school or loaning a pony. 14 isn't old enough to have your own horse, even if you are from a horse riding background.<br>  <br>  Edit: 14 is to young to have your own horse. What 14 year old can pay for one? I got mine first very own horse when I was 15 and I could never looked after her all alone, even with 11 years experience under my belt.|`|psNR7hDJaa	How long have you been riding for? When I read you say "I also play on howrse.com that thought me alot of things as well", well that is an online game. It is not real and not even really close to real ownership. If your parents are saying no, there probably is a good reason. They might not be able to financially support it. Just maybe take lessons for now or try leasing a horse.|`|kIh5iLBXaa	Well if you have never had any experience with REAL horses than please don't. I think a person should spend about 3-4 years with horses before they even think about horses. There are a lot of cons about it also. It gets very expensive. And you have to see your horses everyday. You have to clean its stall EVERY SINGLE DAY.|`|eStfxj7Taa	What about loaning a horse.? or part loan/share? if you dont know what they are look it up, but the better you are the more  they see you ride, the more they;l know you can handle one.|`|bStEdyqEaa	good luck iv been wanting a horse for 8 years now|`|5rEWdAuxaa	How to talk your parents into letting you get a horse? Well, we all want to ask that question sometime in our teenage years. Anyway, here are a few tips:<br>  -Create a list of every single item of equipment you will need to own a horse responsibly and safely. Get prices that are approximate or dead correct and work out how much money you will need to start off with. I would suggest at least $7500. This includes horse, equipment, vet checks, feed, boarding and dentist and farrier. These costs are also ongoing, as each month I spend about $200, $50 a week. Do you have somewhere to put the horse? Will it go in the backyard or at agistment or boarding stables.  <br>  -Research, as playing on that site doesn't give you all the knowledge in the world, Would you know what to do in an emergency, or what to feed a horse and do you know how to ride? Ask yourself these questions. Read books, magazines, watch videos and ask friends who may have horses or go to a local stable and ask questions about owning a horse. Make sure you know about health problems and when to call the vet etc. If you don't know these sorts of things then you may be putting your future-horse in danger.<br>  -Look at your life and think of whether you have enough time, love money and resources to look after this animal properly. Do you have someone to look after the horse if you go on holidays and is school going to be a problem.?<br>  -Persuading your parents- ask them politely. If they say no, or maybe, ask them why. Don't get upset but find out why. Then show them your list of costs and persuade them that you are responsible.( all the things I have listed above.).<br>  <br>  Hopefully they say yes for you. Now, breed does't really matter unless you are going to do a particular disipline. Gender wise though, unless for breeding purposes or he is going to get gelded, do not go for a stallion. They are tough to ride and are dangerous. Mares are also a pain as they go on heat. This gets them tempremental and are cranky when you ride them. I have always found geldings a great choice. Make sure you chose a horse at your level of riding ability and is quiet and possibly not green. A good idea is to not get a young horse but not old. Also choose a hprse that wont be too small or too big for you. Decide this depending on your height and weight. Hope this has helped, and goodluck on your adventures.|`|6GehblM3aa	First of all, how many years have you been around horses?  And, I will point out that playing howrse won't really help you with real horses (I'm a howrse player and a real horse owner).  Remember, you can't suddenly wake up one day and say "I want a horse!"  Horses are not like a cat or dog...they are more than just a hobby or sport...they change you life in so many ways it's crazy.  Find a trainer and take lessons with them, then they will tell you when it's time for a horse.|`|xLNzdxsOaa	I'm 14 and I have my own horse, so it's not too young. But you will need a lot of parent support, I couldn't do it myself no matter how responsible I am. But it is a lot of work and expensive, and you haven't even mentioned if you ride. You should have been riding for at least 2 years before you even consider owning. How long have you been riding? What level are you? Can you afford to/do you have time to look after a horse? It's a bit different than a pug. I recommend getting an older gelding from some quieter breed like a quarter horse if it's your first horse, but it really depends on the horse itself not it's gender or breed. And your experience level would help.|`|qw9ZjAlDaa	There's a lot more behind getting a horse than just being mature and responsible.  Maybe your parents can't afford it.  They really are expensive.  And with the state of the economy, it's a particularly bad time to get a horse.  You may THINK you know the situation behind your family's finances but you probably don't know the whole truth.  Parents don't discuss those things with their children.  Plus it's a time burden on them to drive you back and for to the barn (I'm assuming you'd be boarding).<br>  <br>  Why not try to talk them into leasing or even half leasing first to see if the time commitment and money works with that first.  Then if it does, maybe you can work up to purchasing a horse.<br>  <br>  I wanted a horse very badly when I was your age too but unfortunately I had to wait until I went through college and got a job and could afford one myself...which meant waiting until I was 22.  Sometimes you don't always get what you want.  It hurts, but it's one of life's greatest lessons.  And I was mature and responsible too!|`|bI7wMCJXaa	You need to stop and think about the huge costs of owning a horse. Boarding is at least $350 for a half decent facility. That's every month. You will need a farrier every 6-8 weeks for between $50 - $200 depending if your horse can go barefoot or needs corrective shoes. Worming is $15 a pop and has to be done on a schedule. Vet care and vaccinations you can kiss $300 a year goodbye. Blankets and halters are their own small fortune and will need to be replaced as your horse destroys them. That's not taking into account your bridle, bit, saddle, pad, stirrup irons and leathers and pad, etc.<br>  <br>  Talk to your parents about taking lessons if you do extra chores to help out around the house. One lesson a month. Learn how to ride, get to know real horses and then when you're out of college and live on your own and have about $900 a month in disposable income get a horse.|`|at7LXbEfaa	all i can say is DONT RUSH.<br>  i did. (im 14, first horse as well)<br>  and now im stuck with a green horse, who we were lied to about and i cant ride.<br>  Take it slow. stay away from TBs and always take a trainer<br>  <br>  <br>  i first got my parents to let me lease.<br>  After 3 months of watching me cleaning paddocks and looking after the horse ALL by myself they let me start looking<br>  But i sadly made my mistake as i mentioned above. But he was different when we brought him and he WAS NOT drugged (vet check always)<br>  now i have caused my family a BIG hole in our pockets,<br>  and we have to try and sell a horse that bucked me off....<br>  and start all over again.<br>  the only up side to this is when i start looking again my price bar has risen $2000 so i an buy a safe educatd horse.|`|jQvT6k7raa	You can not talk your parents into anything they are hard set against. You have to show them how dedicated, and responsible you are, and hope for the best. I would suggest that you lease a horse for a few years. Just get the feel for riding regularly rain of shine. Also do lots of research. Don't take this the wrong way, but if you learned a lot from horse, there is probably a lot lot lot more of the basics you still have to learn.<br>  Before you buy a horse, you should:<br>  Be able to groom and saddle a horse alone<br>  Be able to adjust and clean tack on your own<br>  Be able to ride at a walk, trot, and canter in good form, with control<br>  Have a good idea of equine first-aid<br>  Know the basics of equine nutrition<br>  Be able to lunge a horse safely<br>  Be able to lead and tie a horse safley<br>  And for selecting a good horse, you should also be able to judge movement, conformation, and temperament.<br>  <br>  You will also need lots of disposable income! Horses are not like dogs that just need exercise, food, and love:<br>  Horses also need to have their own homes, and need to have stalls cleaned daily, pastures need to be kept green, and clear of toxic plants.<br>  Horses also need a lot of special gear..EXPENSIVE special gear. Here are some of the things you will need:<br>  Rubber Curry Comb, Metal curry comb, Shedding blade, hoof pick, sweat scraper, Body brush, dandy brush soft brush, a mane and tail comb, something to carry it all, a lead rope, a halter, a lunge-line, a first aid kit, a saddle, a cinch, a head-stall, reins, and a bit.<br>  You also need a place to keep it. While I tiny stall works, it is far from ideal, and is like a tiny prison cell. at least one acre of grassy land is ideal. You should also have a three-sided shelter. If you plan to board, you need to find a good stable, preferably with a riding area, that gives the horses fresh water 24/7, and feed at least twice a day. You also need to be prepared to pay $200-$500 a month for this boarding stable,and you have to make the commute to and from the barn at least a few times a week, preferably, every day.<br>  Vet bills, on a healthy, sound horse, are about $400+ a year, counting shots, and worming. Farrier bills vary, depending on what kind of shoes, if any, you horse requires. Expect to pay up to $300 a month for this. <br>  Then you still have the issue of what you will do if your horse is injured. You may have to pay several thousands in vet bills, and may then be stuck with a horse who is permanently unridable. Can you afford to support a horse that can no longer be ridden?<br>  So, you see, a horses are very, very, expensive, high-maintenance creatures. not pets, but family members...best friends.<br>  There are, of course, many befits, and heart-aches of owning a horse, but if you think you are up for the callenge, give it your best shot!<br>  <br>  Your parents have every right to refuse...you are asking them to pay thousands and thousands of dollars that they may not have, so that you can have a big,dirty, smelly, and dangerous "pet". But give them time, and offer to pay a portion of the costs...keep up with riding, and learn all you can, and someday, you may have a horse.<br>  Go to the library and checkout all the horse books you can. But don't believe EVERYTHING you read. Just see what opinions are out there, and form your own.<br>  <br>  As for breed and gender, many people with suggest geldings,and many will tell you to get a so called "calmer breed" like a paint, or quarter horse. not that Quarter Horse Geldings are not fabulous, but the idea that geldings are better them mares is a sterio-type, and there are tons of great breeds out there, so don't get your heart set on one. Just look for a fairly calm, well-trained horse, who's sane, sound, and suitable to what you plan on doing with him.<br>  Best of luck in all things horsey!
Jm8C7caUaa	go to a vet!!!|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	Dogs show allergy by getting very itchy.  They'll chew their feet in particular.   The skin can get very flaky, and hot spots form from the constant scratching and chewing. The skin reaction you describe sounds a lot like allergy.  If she is having any trouble breathing, including wheezing, it's an EMERGENCY.  Give her a Benadryl, 1mg/pound of body weight, if you have it on hand, and get her to an ER vet. <br>  <br>  If she hasn't been exposed to anything else new in her environment, such as a new cleaning product or flea preparation,  it is probably allergy to some ingredient in the new food.  Stop that food right away and go to boiled rice with lamb or rabbit meat until you can get her to the vet.  This will stop  her exposure to the food she is reacting to, since most dogs have not had previous exposure to lamb or rabbit meat.  This diet is not for long term; it's just to break the reaction and settle her immune system.  Probably the vet will have you do an elimination diet to identify the problem food. I feel for you.  I went through that to an extreme degree with an Aussie of mine.  She ended up part of a Novartis study on using the drug Atopica (cyclosporine) to stop allergy symptoms.|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, dogs can suffer from allergies as well as cause them--in fact, allergies are all too common among canines. They can't be cured, but they can be treated, both with medication and by protecting your dog, as much as possible, from whatever's making him sick. <br>  here's more info:<br>  <a href="http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=136251148394990207251230587414" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=136251148394...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	Could be allergies, could be the shampoo if you have bathed recently, or the laundry detergent that you washed bedding in....<br>  <br>  Food allergies show up in different ways, it could be the type of food you are feeding.

65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	No you should not mix goldfish with tropical fish.  Tell her thank you but no thanks.|`|iZPWWLqVaa	Hi there,<br>  Well heres the go with your fish: Mollies, Platies and Guppies can be adapted to live in either cold water OR tropical water. Unfortunately, gold fish can live only in cold water, so if you do wish to take these goldfish, then you will have to adapt the Mollies etc. to cold water, not the other way around! (Trust me on this one, I work in a pet shop and I have done it myself and my Platies and Guppies are still going strong in my pond! And contrary to popular belief, my goldfish which are approx. 5 inches long and my Koi which are atleast 10 inches long, have not, I repeat, have not eaten a single fish.)<br>  And to answer your other question, goldfish are easier to care for than warm water fish. You don need to monitor water temp which makes things easy. However with any fish, you need to keep and eye on ammonia levels, PH, temp (in tropical tanks), and water quality.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, and your right, you did get a bargain!<br>  :)|`|hfg4SbEkaa	yes, tropical fish and goldfish are different. If the tropical fish live in salt water for xample, it would not be a good idea to mix them. At the same time, if they live in freshwater, they still would not be a good mix because tropical fish do not get along well with any other fish besides tropical fish and they will eat the goldfish.|`|ZVYY7nOlaa	Goldfish won't go together with tropical fish. Maybe when the goldfish is small, they can go together temporarily. Goldfish grow very large and produce a lot of waste enough to kill your tropical fish. They are coldwater fish. If you put them in warm water, there less oxygen for the goldfish. Also, when they get larger, they will eat your fish. It will eat whatever fits in its mouth. Fancy goldfish grow up to about 7 inches. Common goldfish, koi, comets grow over a foot long.|`|AtLdnZd5aa	goldfish are very nasty and even if they don't harm your fish their toxins will.|`|25CAIGfeaa	First things first. Never put goldfish with tropical fish. They are coldwater fish and they give off a lot of nitrites and ammonia off their skin. They will sikin the other fish. No goldfish with tropical fish!!! Try guppies, tetras, or 1 grami or somthing like that.

Those work alot. You can also use a sponge over him to get it not as frozen but make sure its indoors and don't let him out till he is fully dry.|`|IWP0gop5aa	Use warm water (not hot) and sponge him down (or tip the bucket over him if he isn't spookey) so it melts it. then get a sweat scraper and scrape it all off. Then wait till he's dry (don't put him outside, he'll go all icey) and thoroughly brush him with a curry comb for a couple of minutes to properly get rid of the dirt, then go over him again for a couple of minutes with the dandy brush to bring up all the dirt on his skin, then go over him again with the body brush to polish him off and remove all the dirt that the dandy brush brought up. The if you want you can 'Bang' (also known as 'Straping') him.<br>  <br>  How to 'Bang' or 'Strap your horse:<br>  It's not THAT kind of banging lol. <br>  What you do is you get a tea towel, fold it untidily till you have a kind of ball, but make sure you have a flat side. Put the screwed up side against your palm and hold it to the side. Then, with some force (not too much, you'll hurt him) slap the tea towel against his neck. Do this a few times but not too many as you need to get him used to the feel of it. DO NOT DO THIS IF HE IS SPOOKEY! This technique is used to tone a horse's muscles. It's great for shows!|`|lTeXIjpOaa	i am also in michigan, i like the idea of the shedding blade but definately know what you mean, sometimes there is just too much mud/poo for that to work, i would recommend a warm bath, but only if you can do it indoors, afterwards i would put a blanket on him til he dries, but i'm not sure what your facilities are like, do you have warm water in your barn? i hate even bathing our racehorses in this weather, even with the warm water it just seems like it is way to cold to be doing so, but you do what you have to do; good luck|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Take a bucket of warm water and sponge the dirty spots.

I would think they would be fine either way.|`|sOkePjK3aa	Sorry, never met one. But I think they are adorable in the pictures I've seen and probably hard to keep clean.|`|9dn7CaHQaa	I have a 3 year old male Coton de Tulear and I think this is a wonderful companion dog and I'm very surprised that it's not more popular since they are so cute, smart, affectionate, and get along great with other animals and kids.  I have made some long car trips with my dog (ranging from 5 to 8 hrs) and he's done very well.  We had some issues when he was a puppy since he was so scared of all the cars and noises on the road, but we took him on a lot of short and fun rides in the car until he got used to it.   I keep my Coton in a puppy cut so I haven't had any issues with grooming and this breed doesn't shed so I found them easy to maintain.  If you keep the coat longer, they just need to be brushed often to keep them from matting.  Good Luck|`|n46bdwUqaa	Yes I have one...have had him for 4 years now. He is sweet, calm, cuddly, and loving. Not at all hard to get along with or anyone to love so whether you take him or leave him he will do just fine. He is hard to train as they are stubborn & grooming you have to keep up on but other than that easy going. Would recommend one for sure. Good Luck and good to hear you are adopting.
1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	Galvayne's groove are not 100% accurate, I think it is more around 50% from what vets told me. Sometimes they don't even have it, or it is uneven (ie one side says the horse is 10yrs, the other side says 15 yrs). There are better ways to tell age up until 15 or so by the wear on the incisors, but I don't know of a website- I have it in a text book.<br>  <br>  Galvayne's groove shows up on the 3rd incisor at about 10 yrs of age. By 15 years it is half way down, 20 years it is all the way down, and at 30 years it is gone.<br>  <br>  EDIT: here is a link.

L9WZJw2paa	Well I have heard it does not matter the color of the fish, they should still school together.  The reason they are shredding each other is there are not enough of them in the tank.  Are those the only fish in the tank because that would def. explain the aggression to each other.  If you had a school of at least 6 (regardless the color) they would be busy chasing each other but would not do each other harm.  They would also not nip other tank mates because they would be too busy with each other.  <br>  <br>  O, what size of tank do you have because if its small that could also cause problems because tiger barbs grow pretty large and are of course very active and need lots of swimming room.  A larger tank will also reduce their aggression.|`|4c50260b4401a8982a4125a4f42c298eaa	maybe they  dont like  each  other|`|wLbXsvAKaa	Tigers need to be in a group of atleast 5.<br>  <br>  Because you mixes greens and regulas it like mixing tow differn species of fis.

Most canine skin allergies are food related. As with any health problem you really need to take your dog to the vet. That being said, try feeding your do a higher quality food like Flint River Ranch (online store) or another comparable "super-premium" food. Dogs tend to have trouble with corn, wheat and beef..sometimes chicken. Lamb/duck or venison and rice formulas tend to cause fewer allergy problems. <br>  <br>  The addition of brewers yeast to their food helps many dogs. You can buy brewers yeast at any health food store. Sprinkle a tablespoon or two on their dinner. <br>  <br>  If the allergy is acute you give your dog one benadryl. Make sure it is the one with anihistime only.......NEVER give a dog sudafedrine/ephedrine medicines, they can kill your dog. <br>  <br>  As with any medication, consult the vet before giving any meds....do not rely on internet message boards to diagnose and treat illness.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.doggonehairy.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.doggonehairy.net/</a>|`|3KAyrh40aa	You have to find out why he is scratching.

I found that using some witch hazel and rub it inot her fur helped some and a weekly bath with moisturing shampoo.  Good luck.|`|Wt61EclRaa	Why is he scratching?  Has he been to a vet-checked for parasites? Could be food allergies. Try feeding a good food.  We use Verus fish and potato food.  It's supposed to be great for skin and coat.  We feed it because our dog happens to love it. There are tons of food out there to try. I hear a lot of dogs are allergic to corn or chicken

If you don't know what that is, ask a store worker. It's usually between 5-10 dollars depending on what kind.

In terms with the fry, I would wait until they appear larger than the fit-into-someone-else's mouth.  I've never had fry, so I can't say how long that will take.  Watch out too because the fish aren't the only problem as they could get sucked into the filter as well.

kUYRnmRRaa	Catfish commonly get very large, depending on the species.  This goes for plecos as well; this fish are commonly sold for smaller tanks but I've seen many of them get up to a foot long.  Catfish will eventually grow even bigger, and, especially if you don't know what species you have, I'd either invest in a much bigger tank or try selling or donating them to someone else who has the space.  They'd also eventually go after your minnows if you housed them together.  Without knowing what type of catfish it is I'm not sure how big your tank would need to be, but it's likely that they'll grow to at least 8" long, and require around 40 gallons of tank space.<br>  <br>  If the fish you've got isn't a large type of catfish (or isn't a catfish at all), it might be an otto cat (narrow, gray bottom feeders that get around 3" long when full grown) an algae eater (yellower color) or a cory catfish. These could potentially be kept in a ten gallon tank, but maybe not with your pleco, minnows, and betta all in the same one.<br>  <br>  Determine the species of your catfish (ask a petstore worker if you can't find an example on the internet.  Heck, post a picture of them on answers and I'll give it a shot myself.)  If their full grown size is less than around 4" or so, you could potentially keep them in the ten gallon with your minnows.  Any bigger than this, and I'd try to find a bigger setup for them.  The betta could remain in the two gallon tank alone, or go in the ten gallon with the minnows and (if they turn out to be a small, non-aggressive species) the catfish.  <br>  <br>  The pleco will definitely outgrow a ten gallon tank sooner or later.  If I were you I'd get rid of it and keep the minnows and betta, which are better suited for a ten gallon.|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	2 gallon tanks for 2 catfish-like fish.. WAY too small. I'd say a bigger tank than 10 gallon... <br>  <br>  the minnows should be in at least a 5 gallon. a 10 is better.<br>  and the betta should maybe move up to the 2 gallon.<br>  <br>  if you are going to get a ten gallon for the catfish then do not put any other fish in it.<br>  after they get bigger, you should get about a 20 gallon tank. so perhaps move straight to the 20 gallon.<br>  <br>  i am not sure if all those fish can be in one tank, regardless of size because they may eat each other.|`|01e20da0d169c7d0c6c0a2c2631a8036aa	How big are the catfish?

ea073a7e51b6c89785bcfc0713212cf2aa	Congrats on supporting puppy mills.  Way to go.<br>  <br>  What you have is an undersized runt and a mutt.  Call it whatever stupid names you want, but realize you're only fooling yourself.  You paid money for a dog that once upon a time people couldn't GIVE away.|`|gx4s68s8aa	1) when he bites then you have to act like it really hurt.  Say Ouch! loudly and then turn away from him for a minute.  Even if the bite didn't hurt.  He is just playing rough with you and he needs to learn now that it not acceptable.  He wants you to like him so if you yell out and ignore him for a short time then he will understand that biting is not right.  It should stop in less than a week if you do it every time he bites.<br>  <br>  2. try adding fish oil to his diet.  There are tablets available at the pet supply store.  It takes about two weeks to see full results or longer.  But fish oil is a great thing for most skin problems.  And if it doesn't work then it will not hurt your dog at all.<br>  <br>  3.  We like Blue Buffalo brand.  It is a very good variety of dog food.  They make it in dry and in wet, but I always get the dry because it is cheaper.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in teacups or Morkies- but that is not your question.  The dog is with you now, so I do sincerely hope all works out well for the both of you.|`|bIaywrBCaa	the skin problems are probably caused by a poor diet. We feed Nutro Lamb and Rice. Our dogs do not have any skin problems.  Correct the biting by saying "NO" firmly. Give him something appropriate to chew.<br>  <br>  As for the teacup and the morkie part. It is not a teacup and it is a mixed breed, not a morkie.|`|d90ff91e5a5e8b266b8723372b08326aaa	Hi, mix in 1 sardine every breakfast with the normal hard food, it takes the dry out of the skin. Take dog for outdoor walks everyday. Put a ton of clean water out every day, don't forget to clean the dog dishes. And clean the bedding.

No such thing of a Morkie. You got a mutt my friend. Ask your vet--he can answer all yor questions.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	First of all you aren't supposed to bathe a dog every day. Just once a month.  If it's a puppy under 12 wks of age it's not supposed to be bathed with a shampoo at all because he's to young.<br>  <br>  If he's been taken from his litter before 8 weeks then he hasn't learned bite inhibition.  You must "yelp" when he nips your hands and stop playing with him. He'll soon realise that biting ends playtime and lovin'.<br>  <br>  Dry skin could be an allergy. Have the vet test him and see if he has a food allergy, common allergy that can be easily treated or if he's possibly allergic to fleas. If he's allergic to flea bites then even ONE bite will make him itch all over due to the saliva.<br>  Try baby oil on his skin and give him fish oil in his food.<br>  <br>  Yes, there are better dog foods depending on what you're feeding now. Try Nutro Small Breed or Blue Buffalo.  They are the better brands and you can find them at Petsmart.  Possibly switch him to a lamb & rice formula in case he does have a food allergy.<br>  <br>  Now that I've given you "help/advice" I'll tell you another thing.<br>  The Maltese breed needs sunshine and enjoys laying outside on sunny days.  They are not good for small children.  Higher protein and fat in the diet is also recommended.<br>  Yorkie - delicate digestive system, so avoid strange treats (people food or unknown dog treats). Don't do well under anesthesia. Sometimes suffer paralysis or herniated discs. When you brush the coat (and it must be done daily) use coat conditioner beforehand. If you don't the hairs will break. <br>  <br>  Now...since you have a mix between these two breeds you could get a variety of all health problems (including retinal atrophy, luxating patellas and bronchial collapse).  You could get one breeds health problems and not the other.  You could get the temper of one, the looks of the other or a combination of the two.  The point is you will NOT know what you are getting.  The skin issues could be due to very poor breeding practices (obviously, since it's a mixed breed), poor living conditions, poor eating habits, bad food, not enough oil being produced or any other number of reasons.  <br>  <br>  Next time someone wants to buy you a puppy make sure they pick an actual breed from a reputable & ethical purebred breeder.  Then you won't have so many issues (now or later in life).|`|Re576Xa5aa	I am helping. That dog will probably have hoardes of problems.

Also, dont put out all the toys. Dogs get bored easily. Exchange them on the weekly basis.<br>  Oatmeal shampoo should do the trick. But dont bathe him to often....that can ruin is skin even more. <br>  Just stick with the dry food. I wouldnt even mix it up. Maybe just add a little warm water to bring the smell out better. Make sure you have set mealtimes for him. Housebreaking will be alot faster if you feed him 3 times a day. <br>  Good luck with your puppy...;-)|`|IMa9kGZraa	1) OK! I have 10 dogs and they have ALL gone through this! My advice is to put on gloves and start training him! the best way to do this is to get treats and let him know that there is no treat when people get bitten!<br>  2)It is called "Doggie Dandruff " and it is normal! the best way to treat this is to stop using that shampoo! it works for full grown dogs but not for puppy's! instead if your puppy isn't rowdy then use human dandruff control shampoo!<br>  3)If you dog is getting skinny maybe he doen't like the food. change your food and by the way natural food doen't help the dog it just hurts your budget!|`|Pz8rIt26aa	I have a Morkie!<br>  It sounds like he's teething. They do tend to gnaw on you when they do that. I used to sit on my hands until she calmed down.Does he have a toy especially made for teething? You can get them at Wal-Mart.<br>  <br>  My Belle has also had problems with dry skin, she is allergic to fleas.  He may need a cortisone shot to clear it up--it worked for her. Also, make sure you're bathing no more than twice a month and keep him very flea-free.<br>  <br>  Is he eating puppy food? It has a higher caloric count to help them grow--not too fast or slow.. The bag has recommendations on how much you should give him according to his weight. Beneful is my favorite--both my dogs love it.She didn't seem to eat a lot at first either but over the last few months her appetite's increased .Her weight is right on target. Just keep an eye on him. If he's not eating at least what the bag recommends, ask your vet.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.beneful.com/Dog-Food/Healthy-Growth/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.beneful.com/Dog-Food/Healthy-...</a><br>  <br>  Oh and to all the rude, nasty people answering this question--you don't know where she got her dog, who her breeder was or how much she paid, so how dare you judge. My dog is a Maltese/Yorkie mix and she was bred in a very loving home under the best care imaginable. She is a healthy and beautiful dog. And we can call them whatever cutsie name we want to because they are our pets and we love them.

She needs tons of training.  First things is you should get her into a class for her age.  The trainer can then send you on to where you would like to go with her.  Also off subject...

You don't need to step in unless someone is being actually aggressive, not simply dominant. Watch for poofy fur, approaching sideways and listen for really dramatic shrieks or hisses. As the saying goes among ratty owners, "No blood, no foul!"

Its okay for him to go outside for a while but all day is increasing the risk of something happening to him for the worst. <br>  But if your answer to question three is yes then your answer is probably no.

HZvdr8VLaa	I've had several, and I will be getting 6 more in a few days. One that I have laying right now lays eggs that are anywhere from close to a robin egg blue to a bluish green. There legs are more of a silvery gray color. It's hard to describe but it is very distinctive. Since there feathers can be so many different patterns, it makes it easy to tell them apart from other breeds when they are young. They are not an extremely friendly chicken, but they are not as aggressive as the RI Reds that you already have. Like anything, it depends how much time you spend with them. They can really be about any color combination so any website pics you see are just one possibility. I've had some really beautiful ones and some I thought were the ugliest darn things.|`|DEYvhPtpaa	First off, Americanas are very rare. Many, many, many people and hatcheries advertise their birds as Americanas when in reality they are Easter Eggers. Easter eggers lay an drab green egg. They also tend to be very skittish and not as friendly as other breeds. To get a real Americauna you must buy from a private breeder who has ACTUAL Americana stock.

wLgGD63raa	How much are regular Leo's a piece: Regular standard leopard geckos shouldn't cost you any more than $30, sometimes less.<br>  <br>  How big should the tank be: The tank can be a 10 gallon but that is the bare minimum, I would suggest getting a 20 gallon.<br>  <br>  What should be in their tank: You need some type of solid substrate, sand has too much of a risk for impaction. I suggest unglazed slate tile, paper towel, or non adhesive shelf liner. You will also need three hides, one humid one (made humid by sticking wet paper towel, reptile carpet or spaghnum moss inside) on the hot side, one on the cool side, and one in the middle. You will also need a food and water dish and a dish for pure calcium.<br>  <br>  What are some specialty items leos need: The only thing you're really going to need is an under the tank heater, a thermometer, digital food scale (to keep track of weight), pure calcium powder and a multi-vitamin to dust food with.<br>  <br>  What kind of food: Leopard geckos can eat crickets, meal worms, super worms, horned worms, butter worms, silk worm, phoenix worms and occasionally wax worms as treat as they are fattening. Female leos can be fed pinky mice but only while breeding them.<br>  <br>  How much heat do they need: Leopard geckos need about 82-88 Fahrenheit, this can easily be obtained with an under tank heater.<br>  <br>  How much does owning two leos cost:  I would not suggest put two leos in the same tank, this causes a lot of different problems. Two males will fight, sometimes to the death. A male and female will breed even if you don't want to and this can sometimes lead to a very stressed out female, or a female that dies due to not laying her eggs if you don't care for them properly. When they're not in breeding season males will continue to harass females. Two females together can still have it's fair share of problems. One may bully another, hog all the food, and things like that. On top of this it is hard to monitor both gecko's health in the same tank so just double the price for everything you need minus the scale, calcium, and multi-vitamin.<br>  <br>  How much will all of this cost: For everything you need it will probably cost you around $140+ for one gecko and everything you need. A lot of the times you can find second hand items for cheaper in the newspaper or on websites like Craigslist.com and Kijiji.com. You can also check out local privately owned pet shops for tanks and heating pads.

These people (byb's and puppymills) are unethical, immoral, don't care about any breed, only want money, don't care about health or where the dogs end up.  <br>  <br>  If these ignorant beings would stop doing this then we'd have a lot less dogs in shelters.

vvJBtxXHaa	that tank is NOT overstocked...and the filtration is excellent!<br>  ...may times you hear a 'rule of thumb' that some folks govern their lives by, however, the actual bio-load of a tank is found in recurring water parameters and functional swim space based upon species need....in your situation as you have described, you are neither exceeding the 'rule of thumb, nor are you under filtering the volume of water and sebsequntly, your water parameters are great<br>  <br>  ...i should say, the corys are good in that they don't miss much of the food that falls to the bottom<br>  ...the tetras have a small adult size and less bio-load compared to 2" or 4" adult species, such as gouramis...your pleco is lucky if he gets much algae though, as your tank gas exchange is high, and algae thirves in lower oxygenated water paremeters (as do other live plants in aquairums).... the less O2 exchanged leaves more CO2  for the plants to use....there is a balance to be found when using live plants that NEED alot CO2 suppliments and huge amounts of light....there are plant species which do not NEED lots of light or huge CO2 suppliments<br>  ...the chemistry in a heavy bio-load is simple as you are monitoring  the paremters, you can gradually add to your compliment and see the changes say 10 neon tetras add to your current tank (not much)<br>  ...Best Wishes|`|gBd3f0jZaa	i think ur ok... also depends on how big the fish are, sounds like you got alot-o-money on ur hands, if you thing that u might have too many fish, just sell the tank, and get a bigger one... remember, don't get anymore fish (impulsive buying)|`|25CAIGfeaa	YOU might have to get a bigger tank.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	If your water tests are OK, and your fish are healthy, then you are not overstocked.<br>  <br>  Those are the things that matter, not measuring your fish with a ruler and applying some crappy 'rule'.<br>  <br>  If it's not broken, dont fix it. ;-)<br>  <br>  Ian
lNzhglLFaa	get the tank and fish all at once...<br>  <br>  if the pet store sells Stress Zyme get some and add according to the instructions.<br>  that will build your beneficial bacteria base faster and aid in filtration.<br>  <br>  only get 2ish fish to start with so you can build up the beneficial bacteria before you get new fish...<br>  <br>  only feed once a week and a VERY small amount for the first month or so (your fish will not starve and the tank will stay clean that way)<br>  <br>  add new fish once a week and only 2 or 3 at a time..<br>  <br>  and inch of fish per gallon of water is recommended don't  over crowd your tank!<br>  <br>  <br>  and last but not least HAVE FUN!|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Wherever you put the fish, you need to cycle it.<br>  <br>  You should never buy the fish and tank in the same day. You need to cycle their tank. You should cycle it for 3-4 weeks. So get the tank, and cycle it, then go back to the shop in a few weeks to get the fish.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Adding everything at once is setting yourself up for failure. Give yourself every chance of success and wait. This cycling period gives you time to research fish compatible with your Betta and tank size.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is wait. Buying all those fish tomorrow will create an ammonia spike which will cause the fish to suffer and potentially die.<br>  <br>  They cannot be housed in bowls while the tank cycles. A Betta is forgiving of poor water quality, low oxygen levels, and less than ideal temperatures, other fish...not so much.|`|25CAIGfeaa	You rushed it soooooo badly! You should have researched before you started:[ Don't get a fish tommoro omg NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO don't!<br>  YOU NEED TO CYCLE THE TANK FOR 2 WHOLE WEEKS!!!!!!!!!<br>  IF YOU JUST PUT THE FISH IN WITHOUT CYCLING IT WILL DIE BECAUSE OF AMMONIA AND NITRITS AND STUFF YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW!! epic fail|`|uke9Ysrvaa	hey, i know what your talking about i have the same problem(the mom part) well just cycle the tank first then get your fishes.|`|asXq2cFDaa	I would say try your best to wait a few weeks till the tank is cycled b4 you get the new fish.|`|4ap1GPvsaa	Ok i can tell you how to get an aquarium ready for a fish in approx. 1 week, what you should do is when you get the tank also look for any kind of water conditioner that says it works instantly (i strongly suggest AquaPlus if they have it) set up your tank and if your housing goldfish make sure the tempurature is at 66-68 F and if its tropical make sure its at 71-80 F, read the instuctions on the bottle and put in the required conditioner, then wait atleast 2 hrs and then you can put in ONE fish. take care of that fish for a week then you can put in a maximum of 2 fish after the week has passed.<br>  <br>  Hope This Helps<br>  ~Sincerly Cori~

Nothing smaller than five gallons.<br>  2. They are fairly cheap. Price depends on type, but they are usually under four dollars.<br>  3. They are not difficult, but do breed like crazy, so only buy one gender.<br>  4. At least three.<br>  5. Should you get different fish too? It depends on tank size.<br>  6. I would not house them with the betta. They have long tails which are prone to attack.|`|uke9Ysrvaa	well for about 3 of them, 5 gallons is enough but for more, then you might want to upgrade.they do not cost more than 5 bucks, over in brooklyn they cost about 2.50 per one. it is fairly easily to take care of a guppy all you have to do is make sure your water parameters are stable, changing water weekly, feeding regularly and just keeping the guppies with fish who are tropical, and non agressive. if your going to get guppies get 1 male and 2 femals and follow that rule. and no do not put the betta with the guppie you could keep the betta in a bowl as long as you change the water every 3 days.|`|WNPBGYQ4aa	find out if you're allergic first.  we once got a bunch of puppies and fell in love. but then my dad and i had serious allergy attacks and we had to return them within like 2 months :(  it totally broke my heart.  check to see if you're allergic first.  if you're not, get 1 or 2 to start. not more!  they're somewhat hard to take care of.  i would go for golden retreivers if i were you.  they're not as hard to take care of and they're so loving..you can get them free or for your donation on craigslist sometimes.  i would also get a book puppies or dogs for dummies.  it teaches you how to train them so they don't crap everywhere.  as far as fish,  ??  i don't know enough..but anyway, good luck!  <br>  <br>  <br>  ****oops!  so sorry.  i have the flu so i'm not wearing my glasses.  i could have sworn that said puppies..i so need lasik :)|`|Rdpv91NTaa	with your betta buy him maybe a filtered and heated 3 gallon tank.<br>  if you want guppys this is a good website. also bettas will rip guppys tails to shreds.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fishlore.com/Profiles-Guppy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishlore.com/Profiles-Guppy.h...</a><br>  <br>  if you get guppys get aleast 10 gallon you could put 8 in there or 4 guppy and 4 platy i would say get 4 male guppy and maybe 3 corys to clean your algae. don't get female guppys because they will breed like rabbits. guppys only cost 1.50 each or less.
KeevlZnTaa	The pups are not going to be able to breed until they reach sexual maturity. If you separate the males from the females at 5 weeks they will not have the opportunity to produce babies.<br>  <br>  You need to get a bigger tank if you are going to keep all the pups after they are old enough to leave the mother. The general rule is  gallons per gerbil. Therefore if you have 4 female gerbils you will need a 20 gallon tank or larger.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure you know how to tell an infant male from a female, as you do not want to have a male in with the females accidentally. When it is time to separate(at  5 weeks) you should be able to see the scrotal bulge in the males.|`|AA11878029	you have to keep them seperated.  My daughter got some hamsters for her birthday .  we ended up with 96 hamsers in 3 months.....we no longer have any hamsters !!.....We have a fat snake !!!|`|Nyc2WH9Baa	I had baby gerbils about a year ago, and, well, i have experience. Im not sure why, but right after the mom gave birth, the dad and mom mated again! unless you want more than one litter, i would suggest taking the dad out before the mom gives birth! google 'american gerbil society' for TONS of really helpful info! good luck! :)|`|i6oMPSexaa	Keep the girls with the mom and the boys in a whole seperate cage.  Even if wire split it I heard they can still breed with wire seperating them.  Sounds weird but you don't want to end up with too many Gerbils.
tPGxPDvBaa	Maybe she jumped down from something or simply put too much weight on that leg.<br>  <br>  It is a very common hereditary issue with small breeds or overweight dogs.  If your dog is even the slightest overweight, she needs to lose it.  I have seen many ppl have the surgery repeatedly done to their dogs  cuz they didn't get the weight off the dog.  Ask vet about any meds she might need. Lots of times they pop in & out all day long but it is when they popped out & not going back in is the problem.  You might want to try a holistic vet for acupuncture or massage therapy instead of drugs or surgery.|`|TDBPf3fNaa	No she didn't "sprain" her ankle. Patellas are having to do with the knee caps. Some breeds are prone to this, genetically and heredity.<br>  <br>  There is surgery for this, but can be expensive to fix. Anti-inflammitories will help. As long as the vet doesn't feel she's in pain. Then I wouldn't worry to much. Or get a second opinion.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	Your vet can feel the patella going in and out of place.  Most dogs who have this are born with an abnormality, it's likely nothing you did.  She may have had it all this time, and it never really bothered her.  What did your vet recommend you do about it?  What kind of dog is it?|`|0fKQhIX0aa	no theyre probably right.  its very common and the surgery has great outcomes.  it just means that the knee cap is shifting.  look into starting your dog on a glucosamine supplement to help out.. there are many reasons that could cause it.  and sometimes you dont even know about it until the vet does an exam.  they just get sore like us if we have tendonitis or arthritis|`|bIaywrBCaa	it is common in small breed dogs and may take months or even years to start acting up. I think you have a chihuahua? Did he suggest surgery? I had one chihuahua that had the surgery. I think it was $225 a few years ago.
SzW9GmRsaa	It's not about the head, and messing with the reins will annoy the horse and deaden his mouth.  It's so easy to spot a horse who's had his mouth interfered with.<br>  <br>  A good horse will offer his mouth when he's feeling balanced enough to do so. If you abuse that balance by socking him in the teeth he'll be quick to withdraw his offer.  Keep riding him forwards quietly and it'll come.<br>  <br>  Your instructor will be able to explain with demos.  If she suggests wiggling the reins, get a new instructor.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	i get my horses on the bit by gently squeezing my hands.<br>  (sort of like you're ringing out a sponge with water in it)<br>  alternate hands until he gives, and then relax your hands forward. (he should take the bit and move down and relax his frame)<br>  your trainer should be able to tell you how to do it though.|`|6FsZykp1aa	squeeze the reins, every two steps, like a sponge. you may not be able to feel it much, but they sure can and well trained horse become round.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Did you ask your trainer?<br>  they should be able to show you.|`|1kSRPadaaa	ok first of all you need to stop thinking of it as "on the Bit", the horse should be round b/c he has impulsion and is moving from his hind quarters and over his back, there fore making a soft contact and bring his head round. to achieve this you need to be moving freely forward and have your legs on, keep your hands up and dont see saw them, gently ask him round and as soon as he responds soften your hands. the key to having him round is using your legs|`|eXDDODfHaa	yep the people before me got most of everything.
fgxajTiBaa	Innova is a great food. I fed my dog California Natural Lamb Meal & Rice. He has a sensitive stomach and it was a very nice limited ingredient food. He has an amazing coat and looks fabulous! He'll be one year old on the 23rd.<br>  <br>  Add: I think Terry is overgeneralizing the 'puppy food' thing. Giants breeds such as St Bernards, Danes, Newfies, etc. should either never eat puppy food or eat it for a short time.  The reason for this is the calories in the puppy food pushes them to grow much faster than their bones are ready for and they can end up developing some serious issues with bones. There is actually a load of research out there on this, but I've never heard about smaller breeds having this problem, so I'm sure you're fine with puppy food.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Innova is fabulous.  I also like Eagle Pack and Canidae.  Eagle pack is really popular with show dog owners/breeders.|`|7TKRtDanaa	Wellness has a puppy brand called diamond that is really good. I use blue buffalo puppy food large breed for my Rott. It's all natural holistic a little bit pricey but it's well worth it. Zero by-products!!!!  His coat is so shiny thats the first thing people ask me when they see him. Oh it's at Petsmart and they have small breed as well|`|XvqX0Vv5aa	Personally, I love Science Diet.  Any vet will tell you it is a great food to feed your puppy. Many even carry it themselves. Just check the ingredients list on the bags to see what the first few ingredients are. Those are the main components. Then check protein levels, etc. Good Luck!|`|paduuGEraa	Puppies should not eat puppy food. It is bad for them. It will make them have fast growth spurts, resulting in weak bones. You should get Blue's food, it is very healthy.|`|ysJusb21aa	I use nutro puppy small bites.
pYF9KnNeaa	Depending on where you live, yes, the birds could be mating already.  That doesn't mean they are going to lay any time soon, especially if it's still very cold where you are.  Mating is not automatically followed by egg laying.  I think you could be right in that your husband has a bit of a fascination for it and may not always be seeing what he thinks he sees.  Generally speaking, birds do not mate that much, out in the wide open.  It would be pretty difficult to see a bunch of mating going on.  An occasional pair, few and far between, yes.  But constantly?  Not likely.|`|yMbw0Osnaa	is your husband sure the birds are not just youngsters socializing and playing.here in australia where i live it is pretty much breeding season all year because it never gets cold but over there is different.i think he is just seeing playing and socializing.as the previous person said.they just dont do it that much

Cats need their tails for balance.  <br>  <br>  Dogs with docked tails are usually that way because the owner either wants to FIGHT the dog, or show the dog.  Regardless of that fact, IT IS STILL WRONG to do to both animals.<br>  <br>  A responsible pet owner would buy an animal, and ACCEPT that animal as it is.  Otherwise, why get one?<br>  <br>  Please, tell me, im curious to know, Why do you want to cut off your cats tail?  What are the benefits?|`|iJtuhLMTaa	Cats are not typically docked as unlike dogs they use their tails for balance,  however dogs are docked at 2-3 days 5 days max  after that it is an amputation and would require general anesthesia.   So based on that yes it is too late to dock|`|zguucR8yaa	Your question is immature and ridiculous. <br>  I think you should have your ears cut to make them pointy, just because I like ears to look like that.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	**cries**|`|k0kKaRZ7aa	I don't know but cats have a tail for a reason. They use their tails for balance and without it can't balance very well and can most likely fall off railing and other places. Manx's were a breed of cat with a natural docked tail. They were bred to be balanced well without a tail. In any case you should not dock your kittens tail if it commonly goes on high railing, bars, stakes/poles, etc. This is common in dogs to dock their tails. Not common in cats. I would reccomend you not to do it but then again its not my cat.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	Why would you want to?  And if you don't want to hear that it's wrong, tough.  There's no good reason for it.  Cats have tails for a reason.<br>  <br>  addition: no difference between cats and dogs, in my mind.  they should both keep their tails!!|`|fWI8QxB7aa	Well in Australia in is now illegal to dock dogs tails, unless for medical reasons, and I think it's wrong, why not just get a cat with a tail and it can be all slinky, like a cat should.|`|ulhyTxoGaa	you're not right<br>  <br>  ADD:  I don't believe in docking a dog's tail either.  you should accept them the way they are.<br>  I can understand if it's for medical reasons, but about 95% of the time it's not|`|Yc6eUIW9aa	Why would u want to do that?

nP1hNAUDaa	A HOT (hang on tank) filter would work a lot better if you had powerheads that keep their waste from settling.

Clown loaches are schooling. And both grow to 12 inches. Your tank is not large enough.<br>  <br>  But otherwise, the paradise fish would work with these guys. Except maybe the swordtails, Im not positive with them.|`|dJs2s9pfaa	They can be aggressive, but with gouramis I just avoid getting gouramis with similar gocolors and markings that way they are less likely to dominate. The paradise gourami will not be a threat to the other species. If they are similar in color then I'd choose another. I learned this the hard way so I hope this helps you.

ff42beaeb7a8ee5d3b32dd2655c08c36aa	all foals go through different growth spurts.  one day the rear end is higher and the next the withers are higher.<br>  most foals will level out.<br>  tb's are frequently bred to be "down hill"...rear higher than front, for speed.<br>  the problem is  is that it puts all the weight and strain on the front legs, which is why they so often break down training and racing at the track.  the other part of the problem is that since the hind end is higher.....the hind legs are straighter (often called post legged).  this will make it almost impossible for a horse like this to work with the hind end under neath him as required in dressage.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	it's called being downhill<br>  =]]<br>  and most foals/horses will grow out of it.<br>  if they're 5 and are still downhill then keep looking. <br>  a horse that is downhill will automatically be heavier on his forehand then a horse who is balanced or uphill (shoulder higher then hips)<br>  this can prevent a horse from doing jumping or dressage, but is more liked in things like cutting, when the horse is supposed to be on his forehand.|`|psNR7hDJaa	They are only foals, they are still growing so we don't know yet if they will have higher hindquarters. And are you talking about it being higher than the withers? Because that sounds more right. The hindquarters are always higher than the shoulders. :P|`|MUfMJYHGaa	No, this is normal in all breeds. Foals grow one end at a time, up in the rear then up in the front,then up in the rear etc It's more noticeable in some than others. Quarter horses are bred for an elevated rear so it's really noticeable in them.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Most people already told it like it is.  They are foals and are growing you cant judge them by there hindquarters yet.  All youngsters go through times like that.  Look at the sire and dam to get a better idea.|`|DtXM9xMhaa	Most foals are like that, and it is mainly a quarter horse thing. They'll grow out of it or mostly out of it by the time they are 5.|`|JcwQ4nK7aa	Young horses often have higher hindquarters than 'shoulders'... they grow from the back to the front.... however, a 4 or  5 year old should not have higher hindquarters.|`|LkCKzaAXaa	Even if their withers and hind quarters stayed that height, they could be used as sulky horses, where that is seen as a great quality!|`|JXJvxhZPaa	It's really hard to say with a foal.  Young horses don't always grow evenly, so their front ends will most likely eventually catch up with their hind ends.  A croup high horse can be very limited in many English disciplines as collection is made more difficult.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Like others said, it is called "downhill built"<br>  It might (if they dont grow out of it) affect them in barrel racing, jumping, and dressage.  They can't get under themselves as easily in barrels and dressage, and in jumping, they have to lift their fronts higher than usual.<br>  I definitely wouldn't buy that horse...  just personal preferences!|`|vfhKkiSKaa	Foals and young horses go through growth spurts are are often taller in either the front or back.  Most of them (not all) will outgrow that and be balanced as an adult.  <br>  <br>  A good way to get an idea if it is a growth spurt or a conformation fault is to look at the parents.  If one of them is downhill (or uphill) there is a good chance that the baby will  stay the same as an adult.|`|WJJMZ9IQaa	Do you mean the withers?<br>  <br>  They're just downhill. Most foals will grow out of it.|`|eXDDODfHaa	yeah most foals are like that.   I heard that it is better to have them with short front legs than to have long necks?|`|ysJusb21aa	I don't know.

CkecSp4Uaa	Well, with a 15 month old child in the house obedience classes should not be optional.  For your child's safety you need to learn how to properly train your dog.  Until you can afford to get some real training your best bet is to shut the dog in another room while your son is eating.  Your dog is not being "bad," he's just doing what comes naturally to all dogs unless they are very well trained not to.  It's not your dog's fault, it's your fault for not training him properly in the first place.  Clearly your dog can not resist the temptation of the food around your son, so your best option at this time is to simply not give him access to the food while your son is eating (actually, your BEST option would be obedience classes but if you are unwilling to do this then restricting access eliminates the problem without the risk of causing other behavioral problems in the process).|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	OK, if you are not willing to take your dog to obedience training then you need to train your son to eat at the table or in his chair. Don't let the child walk around with food.<br>  <br>  All dogs will pick up food that is dropped on the floor. That's what dogs do.  <br>  Positive reinforcement training will teach the dog not to steal food from a childs hands. No point in trying to 'discipline' a dog without training.|`|ydshiNrKaa	You need to make the dog stay in another room when you are eating and not to be at the table begging.  If he is crate trained, put him in his crate while you eat.  If he does not have a crate, give him something to entertain him in another room while you eat, like a kong stuffed with peanut butter then frozen, or a bully stick to chew on.|`|GLsCVPCuaa	I think that the problem is the fact that your dog thinks that it is dominant over your infant son. My dogs love human food more than the average dog, but they wouldnt dare take it out of my hand..they know better..im assuming that he doesnt act this way when u have food in your hand?|`|88a821ff156d404073518f9a8da929c6aa	Don't you need to stop it at source?!<br>  Dogs do that,it's just what they do.<br>  <br>  Isn't the lovable fallibility the attraction?!|`|AA10743313	obedience classes are not an option?!  <br>  <br>  <br>  all dogs need basic manners; if not via a class, then <br>  they must be TAUGHT by U. <br>  <br>  dogs are opportunistic eaters; the toddler dropping food is <br>  ** not! ** the dog;s fault; it is poor management by the parent -- <br>  which would be U, or any other supervising adult. <br>  <br>  separating the dog from the child whenever the child is <br>  eating, would be a good, simple preventive management <br>  scheme. <br>  <br>  ppl who leave food on counters, plates, coffee-tables, etc, <br>  are TO  BLAME if the dog then learns to eat it... this is not <br>  * stealing*   to a dog, no one OWNS this food -- owned food <br>  or bones or toys, etc, are in someone;s possession. <br>  <br>  most adult dogs will NOT take food from even a puppy -- <br>  because for dogs, 99% of ownership is physically HAVING <br>  the food.  a pizza on a coffee-table is not owned, <br>  by dog-rules. <br>  <br>  if U or Ur family are not willing to police the table, clear <br>  the counter, put the trash in the can INSIDE the closet, <br>  then the dog is not to blame...  the humans are, IMO. <br>  no * discipline * is apropos for the dog; <br>  the PEOPLE need a good scolding.|`|3GHXk05saa	To the dog anything within a foot or so of his face is his. That's the 'personal space' of a member of the pack. So if it hits the floor, it's his, in his mind anyway.<br>  As far as taking it from your son, in the dog's eyes, your son is the omega-the lowest in the pack so he doesn't need to consider your son's personal space quite so much. He'd never take it from your husband.<br>  As to how to stop it, well, consistent 'no' will help, but look at it from the dog's point of view. Good food within reach and he doesn't know for a fact he'll eat tomorrow. That part of his brain is still wild. Is snarfing a few Cheerios off the carpet a bad thing? You don't want your son eating off the floor so let the dog have it.<br>  To keep him from taking from his hand, hold some people food in the boys hand with your hand around his. Show it to the dog and say 'no'. Then take it out of reach quickly (he's just a dog, you can't expect miracles) and immediately give him a dog treat from the other hand. Even a few bits of his regular food will do. Keep this up and lengthen the time he has to sit without taking the food and gradually move your hand away from your son's. You're building the dog's understanding and bestowing your rank upon the boy so the dog will understand he needs to listen to your son.<br>  Of course if the little one is feeding treats to the dog then that tends to dilute the training.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I'm curious as to why obedience class is not an option.  Although I probably wouldn't recommend a straight obedience class for this dog.  I'd recommend a trainer that works on specific problems.<br>  <br>  The dog steals food because he can and because you haven't made it clear to him that he's not supposed to.  It's a tough thing to cure.  You have to teach your dog to leave it, he has to know that command inside and out and you have to be able to apply it to food that's dropped and food your son is eating. <br>  <br>  If you can't hook up with a trainer that can show you how to do this properly, you're next best option is to keep the dog away from the kid when the kid is eating.<br>  <br>  And no ... food on the floor does not have to be "fair game."  My dog knows better than to eat things off the floor .. or off the sidewalks when we're walking.  In fact he won't take treats from stragers.  It's all about the training.|`|0fKQhIX0aa	1.  for all these people telling you to phyiscally touch the dog to disipline it is very wrong.  this can redirect a dog's behavior back to you or your son and cause horrible bites.<br>  <br>  2.  the dog needs to learn self control.. try teaching the dog a "leave it" command.  <br>  <br>  3. an easy solution is when your son has food. the dog is not in the room.<br>  <br>  obedience is the key factor.|`|1WmDOPGtaa	Focus less on disciplining, more on training.  What you need to do is teach your dog the "Leave it" command.  A fantastic adjunct to this is the "It's Yer Choice" game (see link below).  All this will take some time, so in the meantime you need to keep your dog from being reinforced for stealing food.  When your child has food, the dog should not have access to him.  Either crate the dog or (even better) train him to lay down in a particular spot and stay there during meals/snacks.    At first, this will require a bit of up and down from the table to return him to his spot.  But your pup will get the idea soon enough.  No anger, no frustration... just matter of factly return the dog to his spot and praise for staying (in a low, calm tone... don't excite him into breaking the stay).<br>  <br>  PS~ If going out to an obedience class isn't an option, there's always in-home, one-on-one training.  Doesn't give quite the same socialization but it's great for working on little kinks like this.|`|FFLUenuMaa	ok one thingis to never pull the dog away or its going to get mad and bite u so what u do is u dont hbit it or scream. simply clap hard so it can get distracted. get it focused on something else an deverytime it doesnt eat the food or drop it, give it a treat. its going to take a few times but it'll get it rite|`|lNzhglLFaa	well.. <br>  <br>  in my opinion the food on the floor is fair game<br>  <br>  however the food in your sons hand is not<br>  <br>  you could crate him while your son is eating....<br>  <br>  or lock him in another room <br>  <br>  or you could get a squirt bottle and hit him in the face every time he steals food..sometimes that works.|`|RgYuXggfaa	I was right there with you.  I ended up locking the dog out of the kitchen.  Baby gates are not just for babies.  If you cant or dont want to do it that way.  I put the leash on the dog and tied her to a door.  It also took about 3 months to convince my son not to drop the food for the dog.|`|X2041t44aa	i would yell first if that doesn't work then i would spank not to hard but enough for it to get through to him|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	The best thing to do is teach him the 'leave it' command. <br>  <a href="http://www.loveyourdog.com/touch.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.loveyourdog.com/touch.html</a><br>  Then, when your son drops food, you tell the dog to LEAVE IT, then reward the good behavior with something else.
ptNy4uicaa	Raccoons don't hunt cats but they fight over food, or territory<br>  your best bet is to set live traps and relocate them in the country or a ravine|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Call animal control.

If the raccoon is trying to pray on your pet, point him in the direction of the nearest church.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Where I live you can. But if your worried your going to get into trouble you can call animal control or your wildlife place and they can let you know. They can also set traps and come pick up the coons for you.|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Absolutely not!  It is illegal to kill any animal other than ants, rats or mice with poison and certainly illegal to shot any kind of wildlife without a hunting license.<br>  <br>  Racoons do NOT prey on cats or dogs.  A mother racoon might fight with a cat if her babies are threatened.<br>  <br>  No cat should be outside after the sun goes down because there are predators who will kill them - foxes (maybe), certainly coyotes or cougars and such.|`|HmPivTTcaa	It may not be legal, but I would.<br>  I live in Australia - if there was ANY animal trying to harm my pet on MY property, I would certainly try to kill it, but definately in a humane way. eg. we would set a cage trap and then shoot it. Sorry but my pets are like kids to me - if an animal was trying to attack your kid would you kill it?|`|IRaIxWJKaa	The raccoons here are nasty. They used to eat side by side with the ferals, but three years ago I noticed the cats would wait halfway down the driveway till the raccoon finished, so I got myself a live trap, baited it with cat food and moved the raccoons 6 miles out into the country, putting them near a river so they had a water source.  Moving them less than 4 miles would have them walk back, but six was far enough.  They say not to move them more than 20, as that may bring disease from one area to another, via the local population.<br>  <br>  If you're in a city or town, there are rules against shooting guns, which can get you some nasty legal troubles.  It's just far easier to live trap and move the suckers.|`|h38M7Eofaa	yeah|`|v0l1JEloaa	Yes.  It is legal to kill an animal that is attacking you, your family,  or your pets or livestock.  It's self-defense.|`|AA10912606	if it was my pet i would kill them, however you might want to contact your local conservation agent to find out the legalities and possible non lethal alternatives, like exterminators or live traps and relocation|`|dZCsMyjXaa	It probably isn't legal wherever you live. Call in animal control and have them moved.|`|KhMVpxCVaa	yes ur saveing ur pet from other wild animals
rmziCueQaa	yes they can swim for a little while|`|nmkgd7luaa	Mice can swim but I wouldn't recommend it. If you do, make sure to dry them afterwards and try to keep them warm.<br>  <br>  My cousin tried it once with a baby mouse and it died because it got too cold. It was young and didn't have a lot of fur.|`|X6rFPI2laa	Yes, mice can swim, but apparently they don't enjoy it, because almost immediately they spread out their legs and float, using the air in their fur to help with buoyancy.  Or perhaps they enjoy floating, who knows?  A friend of mine is a college professor of anatomy whose research for several years concerned exercise and aging, and he used mice swimming.  He always had to have  his lab assistants right at the swim tank with a soda straws to keep touching the mice as they tried to float rather than swim!  The mice went for 3 minute swims, and it was important that they actually swim for that time, not just float.  (It turned out that mice who went swimming several days a week lived longer than non-swimmers.)  Anyhow, I don't see that you would have a problem letting your mice enjoy a brief dip now and then in a sink with a shallow pool of tepid water.|`|oNHtVHzsaa	i would strongly not suggest it. mice can drown very easily compared to rats. i would find another way to keep them active (like a ball). make sure that you listen to the mice and if they are showing any signs of being unconfortable or scared, REMOVE THEM FROM THE SITUATION IMMEDITALLY. good luck and say hi from Maya.|`|HmPivTTcaa	Yes, mice can swim. Make sure the water is warm. I used to put my mice in a bowl of water for a few seconds at a time as sort of a 'bath' to keep their fur clean. :-)|`|jBIaUfUzaa	yes any rodant has a natural ability to swim why do you think there are so many rats in sewages !|`|oh72PlQCaa	i think they can... if they do i would try it just watching a mice swim around like that is funny in my mind 0.0|`|yh6na9Ycaa	They can swim, but only for a little.<br>  Be sure you dry them off throughly afterwards :]|`|HW8ybM2Paa	no, it is mean.
7fVr3q0kaa	It can take a really long time for cats to adjust to a new environment...and the more human and pet family members there are to adjust to, the harder it is.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are doing a great job with her, and have already made inroads toward her trust.

If she follows you when you have a treat in your hand, put the treats on the porch and see if she comes outside. If not, well, some cats are different than others.|`|d6cbd4f49a6660cc733a0b7ea8151199aa	Cats hallucinate. Many people do not understand that they see things that aren't really there. I think the change in her surroundings is causing her brain to be more active. There may be something in the new location or surroundings that is also contributing. <br>  <br>  Some animals just are not the same if they are removed from their environment. They are animals and thus unpredictable and cannot be trusted. That is why a dog will be great with kids, but as soon as it is sold or given away, it bites someone. <br>  <br>  I would give the cat back or put it back in its accustomed surroundings and find a kitten and raise it in your home.
Qa1DoqdJaa	The only other thing your missing is something to remove the chlorine and other bad chemicals from the water. I used to buy a product called Start Right at walmart to go in mine. Also when buying your mollie be careful if your buying males or females. The femals under fin are triangle shaped and the males kind of go straight back in a line. Often the females in the tank are pregnant. Their normally pretty easy to spot though. If you do buy a preg female or buy males and females and the female becomes pregnant, be expectant for live birth. They just some swimming out. You would then need to buy a net thing that hangs inside the tank or buy lots of small grass for them to hide in if you want to keep them alive. Otherwise they will get eaten. I had a lot of mollies at one time. I loved them. Lived for years. Oh and you may want to buy a heater to go in the water too. You can constantly regulate it by adding hot or cold water but it's easier to just buy a heater. They like water around 76 degrees. Oh yeah and a filter as someone also mentioned. If you buy a starter tank they normally come with almost all you need.|`|2Bb9GnCLaa	A heater and a filter, you sound like a beginner fish keeper, but that's ok, everyone starts somewhere. You could get a larger tank and put a large quantity of mollies in there, (or just 2) but get male and female and breed them, (basically all you need to do is put them together and they breed like crazy! LoL) you can make a hefty profit from doing it a few times! But yeah, tank, molly, heater, filter, food, and probably company...|`|qRyZ8FcIaa	honestly you dont need a heat mat! i have four in a fish tank and all i have in there are the mollies some stones a fake plant and a litle guppy! ive had them for a few months now!<br>  <br>  also when you feed them they like to nibble your fingers if you stick 1 in there! it tickles!|`|q0vKbocHaa	umm, you need a heated tank (about 80?F) and you need some hard water. They need a good amount of space in otder to thrive. And they don't really do well with tetra's and stuff. You will also need a filter in order to keep the tank clean as well|`|JxaE5r1Zaa	well you need a heater. mollies like warm water about 70-82 degrees farenheit.  and adding a tablespoon of aquarium salt per 5 gallons is best they live in brackish waters. so they can live in freshwater or saltwater but will be happiest in saltwater.  and yeah a snail or a shrimp will be fine with mollies.  and they will help keep the tank clean.  mollies breed a lot so don't be surprised if you see a bunch of little babies swimming around. and they live about 3-5 years
2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	The only listings I found didn't indicate whether they were 24 hour clinics are not.  Sorry.

8owlj2xHaa	You need your salinity to be at least 1.024 for starters 1.025 even better. Most of the micro life on rocks need at least this level to survive. Snails are very sensitive to this.  Your salt is mixed so that when mixed to a level of 1.024 will give you a ph of 8.2 the ideal level. anything less than 1.024 will give you lower levels of trace elements.  PH is light and therefor time of day sensitive. So if you test ph at the end of the day your tanks ph will be at its highest. If you test ph in the morning or in the early period of your light cycle ph will test the lowest. Always test ph at lights on and lights off to know what your highest and lowest ph levels are. You do not want to go below 7.7 or over 8.4 .  <br>  Never try to adjust PH> test alkalinity levels and make sure they are at least 8 DKH 9 DKH is a little better. As long as your Alkalinity is at these levels low PH is not a problem, and ph will not go over the safe HIGH level. <br>  some good reading,<a href="http://www.reefkeeping.com/issues/2004-09/rhf/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.reefkeeping.com/issues/2004-0...</a>|`|nP1hNAUDaa	Let the tank cycle through first everything should settle and even out in the end. If its an ongoing problem maybe its the tap water, if that's what you're using, maybe you could get some sea water from the pet store as opposed to mixing it your self, but i think it should be fine after cycling.|`|H06PtiIAaa	you shouldnt have a problem with marine buffer. seachem works extremely well as it isnt just carbonates that raises the ph like a mask but actually buffers it so you cant go over 8.3 if you add too much.<br>  <br>  The only thing to do is add some crushed corals to your substrate in hopes of raising the ph.
DwYX4pAvaa	Raw chicken necks are great for cats teeth. Also you can get your vet to give a proper scale and clean to your cat. Although my cats teeth are healthy (he had a recent teeth clean at the vet) his breath still smelled. I recently bought  a product called 'Fresha Breath' that has chlorophyll in it.  You put a little bit in his water every day. <br>  <br>  Immediately my cats breath improved. If you can't find 'Fresha Breath' then find a product that has chlorophyll in it. If his breath doesn't improve immediately  with chlorophyll, then he has greater oral/health problems.|`|vv2uk9hHaa	Buy him holistic cat food, don't give him the crap they sell in grocery stores it'll make him sick in the long run. Your cat should have dry food by now it's old enough for that. Also buy him Greenies (they're holistic cat treats) they make their breath smell a little bit better for a few minutes.. But accept it, your cat will always have bad breath. You'd smell just as bad if you never washed your teeth. Speaking of that, you could ask your vet to show you how to brush your cat's teeth with their special kits. Never attempt to do it by yourself or EVER use toothpaste for humans. It's toxic for cats.|`|KsLm8qg3aa	Canned food isn't really the best for their teeth.  At 2 mo he should have all of his teeth... definitely at 6.  You can buy him dry kitten food or even treats that are specifically aimed to benefit his teeth or get a kitty toothbrush.|`|GwwOoZdFaa	there are things you can buy like a finger toothbrush and make sure u keep that cat clean. Canned food does make it mouth stinky but don't illiminate it from the cats diet. Male cats need canned food mostly only if they are neautered, it helps them digest the hard foods. my cat had crystals and soft food worked with the hard food for hsi digestive tract. Cats normally have a stinky mouth too.
u4WU01EXaa	Like all purebreds they do have problems I have a dachshund and he is very loyal to me and my family make sure you find a reputable breeder and they can help you with any questions you have. Also having any rough children doesn't help their delicate build just watch the weight and make sure they don't go jumping on and off furniture all the time, just let your daughter know that she will have to be gentle with him or her. Hope this helps they really are a neat little breed not to mention always entertaining people close by.|`|N9IE36uBaa	For a child, a dachshund can be a mixed choice... some are great with kids, others act like true hounds and can get a little testy with an impatient kid. It depends on your kid's temperament too. They are prone to back problems and such so if you do end up getting one make sure it doesn't get overweight.<br>  <br>  Remember to check the Dachshund Club of America's website for local rescue dachshunds in your area and petfinder.com as well!|`|MPQI8Bg3aa	I would discourage a Dachshund for all of the reasons already mentioned. They are very prone to back issues because their backs are so long. A terrier breed might be a good fit for you, they come in all different types and activity levels but all stay fairly small. Just as a side note, I know you said you don't want a long-haired dog but dogs that have to be sheared usually shed less (a little tip I learned the hard way...). As long as you keep up with the grooming their hair won't get stuff stuck in it.|`|VnNyHkImaa	My sister has a mini dachshund and he has sooo much personality. Hes alot of fun. Hes good with kids, LOVES being around people, and other dogs. Hes also very intelligent. He travels well. and hes a super cute little low rider, extra long dog. The downside to pure bred dogs are the possibility of health problems, and back problems. You have to be very careful with making sure they dont jump off of anything thats too high up such as couches or beds.<br>  <br>  I have a puggle, and shes absolutely amazing. PROBABLY the smartest dog ive ever met, sweet, loving, and healthy as any dog ive ever seen. My fiance's uncle is our vet and goes on and on about her health and how shiny her coat is and what an amazing dog she is. The other vet in the practice's neice also has a puggle, and she hasnt had any problems with hers either|`|T6SPad3Haa	I have owned miniture dashunds and they can be rather weak little things as they come out of their youth. Its bad for them to jump/be held wrong because they can slip disks in their backs really easily (not an ideal younger kid pet). The back problems are more of your worry than the seizures, those are genetic I believe.<br>  <br>  Get your daughter a nice mixed breed mutt from the pound! Theres so many dogs there who need loving homes (puppies too!)|`|GaL66jbQaa	Get them from a reputable breeder that does full health testing and doesn't breed dogs under 2 years.   <br>  <a href="http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_adoption_information/how_to_find_a_good_dog_breeder/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_adoption_in...</a>|`|DTGO1pgyaa	because of the length of their back in proportion to their legs, they tend to have a problem with lameness and back problems. These problems become more of a problem especially if they are over weight. The dachshund also should not be encouraged to jump up on or off the couch. They ARE great dogs but have a greater chance of serious health problems over many other breeds. If i were to get a dog for my young daughter i wouldn't get a dachshund because worse case scenario, the dog has to be put down, it would leave your daughter heart broken. I personally would pick a different dog.
PGq1Jm4Maa	TEDDY BEARS SOUNDS CUTER, BUT GET A DWARF...|`|ICCP8m26aa	Teddy Bear hamsters are really cute and clever, but they bite a lot. Honey Bear hamsters are really tame.

CHPuhiOyaa	It is a VERY bad idea to take a pit bull to a dog park. Yeah, they aren't human aggressive, but most (I do mean most, maybe 95%) will display dog aggression sometime throughout their lives, typically after their puppy years. It's never a good idea to have a pitbull offleash with other dogs.|`|DTGO1pgyaa	not only pits but any dog really can be friendly, shy, or mean. A lot of times the temperament has to do with the breed but situations can make things change. I am not sure what they rule or law is about muzzling dogs but if it didn't create a problem or make a cause for concern, then it should be okay. I personally wouldn't say anything if the dog was fine. However if there ever is a concern for safety or anything you can bring it up to the owners about muzzling the dog.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	A good rule of thumb, something to remember for all situations is:  Don't create problems where problems don't exist.  <br>  <br>  Since the dog was friendly and playing nice, there was no problem.  Saying something to these folks would have just ruined their day.  And what would the point of that have been?  Other than just being mean.<br>  <br>  And yes, pits are GREAT dogs if they've been raised right.  It's just that ... people can be stupid.  I think it's a shame that you have breed laws and muzzle laws like that where you live, but many places do now.|`|dlqa6yFkaa	I'm a firm believer that a dog's behaviour is a direct result of how they are raised, regardless of the breed. This one was raised right so behaved in the right way.|`|dl1OOOT8aa	If there is no problem, don't say anything. That is like an unwritten law for all dog owners. APBT and staffies are supposed to be people friendly but some are dog aggressive, so that is why they are not common to see at dog parks. In fact, the staffie is rated as one of the top ten breeds for families in one study.|`|EJqsqnZFaa	Absolutely! They are one of the most friendly breeds out there (unlike many breeds they were bred specifically to live in the home with the family so any kind of human aggression was culled immediately. When dog fighting became less popular people continued to breed them for there sweet nature and the dog aggression became less of an active trait, except for in the "fighting bloodlines". Unfortunately over the past couple of decades the APBT has become a fad among young people and they think its cool to breed for aggression and color (blue). A well raised pit bull (well bred or not) can most definitely make a wonderful pet but people tend to treat them differently then most dogs, causing unstable fearful dogs that are at risk to bite. It has nothing to do with the breed though, people also tend to shy away from small dogs in fear of being bit and that is how they learn to control the people they are afraid of with their mouths. <br>  <br>  Thank you for taking them time to ask about the bree,d they truly are a lovely breed, just horribly misunderstood. <br>  <a href="http://www.ukcdogs.com/WebSite.nsf/Breeds/AmericanPitBullTerrier" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukcdogs.com/WebSite.nsf/Breed...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FV7aLCrgX0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FV7aLCrg...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ***EDIT***<br>   Oh wow, those are some pretty strict laws. The owners may not realize the severity of the laws, but I wouldnt walk up like another pit bull hater trying to make trouble, Pit bull owners in general tend to be rather defensive, we constantly have people judging us and our dogs and eventually you kind of get your back up. Go up and make conversation, play with the dog and make sure he knows that you dont hate his dogs breed. Casually bring up how silly it is that the laws are so strict and mention the muzzle law in passing so he doesnt feel attacked or judged. <br>  I dont know if I helped but I hope it all works out for the best, Im glad you took the time to see what a sweet dog he was before you judged him.|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	Why was it supposed to be muzzled? That's doggie-discrimination.<br>  <br>  Yes, pit bulls are very friendly. It's a shame they have such a bad reputation. They're also extremely willing to please, and pretty intelligent. The perfect family dog.<br>  <br>  Add: Oh my. I'm so sorry your area has submitted to BSL and banned the number one family dog. That really blows. :/|`|0fKQhIX0aa	badrap.org<br>  they arent all bad.<br>  <br>  but if it a law they did violate it, i would report|`|6IEvOJ37aa	you know pitbulls arnt born knowing that everyone will hate them and that they are "supposed to attack and kill" i think they are the best dogs with a good owner they fit almost every life style kids, no kids apartment, big house|`|ulhyTxoGaa	if they are raised right yes they can be friendly.<br>  the media is stupid and only show pits that have been raised WRONG.|`|NVyCF9llaa	i would just let it slide unless the pitbull was being aggressive, etc.|`|UZBl63blaa	ITS THE SHITTY LITTLE ANCLE SNAPPERS YOU NEED TO WATCH.

Pits have such an awful reputation...but they are loyal and loving.  I have never heard so much crap about any other breed.  It just makes me sad.<br>  <br>  My pit is the friendliest dog I have ever met.  He absolutely adores my kids, the neighbor kids and my cats.  He is a bit territorial and doesn't like other dogs coming near our yard but all he ever does is bark at them.  <br>  <br>  I do muzzle my dog when we take him to the vet because he just gets so nervous.  I don't want him lashing out at the other animals around.  Plus it makes all the human in the office feel better but he sure hates that thing.|`|Mmd07IcOaa	Yes, they are normally that friendly. They LOOOVE people lol.<br>  Mine are like that, and are very cuddly!<br>  Pitbulls are no different that any other breed...just smarter and cuter and sweeter. But i'm a little biased :)<br>  <br>  Many people are stunned the first time they meet a pitbull, because they hear so many bad things that give them thier repuation, then are confused by how different they are.|`|fgxajTiBaa	Pitbulls are amazing dogs with a bad rap. Much like Dobies and Rotties had 40 years ago. Pitbulls were bred to be animal aggressive much like the entire terrier group (remember APBT IS a terrier). However, they were NOT bred to be human aggressive. I have never met a human aggressive pit, we have a few at our shelter right now and they are the most amazing, sweet and gentle dogs we have there. They are great with children and adults alike.<br>  <br>  If the dog was supposed to be muzzled, you must live in an area with BSL. No, I wouldn't bother saying anything at this point because it will look like you're trying to get them in trouble. But if you see them again at the dog park, you might mention something, just so they don't get in trouble with Animal Control.<br>  <br>  It is very possible though that this dog is not a pit bull at all. Many people mistake other breeds for pitbulls, which is where a lot of this 'human aggression' comes from.|`|q0vKbocHaa	Pit bulls are not man eaters! A responsible Pit owner realizes the bad repuation they have and make a special effort to make sure there dogs are VERY socialized and well behaved
Kt0qVNZOaa	I really think that they don't care too much because they have more freedom with doing things to animals than to humans. If a human gives birth to a child with birth defects, then they can sue the doctor for the xray causing it, but if a dog has birth defects because of an xray at the vet, they will just say it's because of poor breeding, meanwhile the xray was to blame. <br>  I wouldn't do it. I would not allow any pregnant thing to get xrayed. There is way too much that could go wrong, if not at the beginning then later down the road the dog could get cancer.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	X-rays during late pregnancy (which is when vets do x-rays to determine how many puppies are most likely present) do NOT cause birth defect in dogs OR humans.  Exposure to radiation in early pregnancy can cause death of the fetus (abortion) or sometimes (but very rarely) birth defects, but x-rays at the end of the pregnancy do not carry the same risks because the fetus' cells are not dividing at nearly the same rate.  Also, the amount of radiation in a single x-ray is not that dangerous as a single x-ray actually contains less radiation than what you are exposed to sitting in your house watching television over the course of a year.  The risk comes with accumulation, and accumulation over the entire lifetime counts.  This is why pregnant women STILL get x-rays when necessary (such as if they tear a shoulder) even though there is a slight risk to the baby...the radiologist simply does their best to use extra protection (lead shielding) if the x-ray is necessary.<br>  <br>  As for how the vet was "wrong," x-rays are not an exact science.  What the vet is looking for on the x-ray is the number of skulls and spines that can be seen.  Depending on how the puppies are laying in the uterus it is very easy for one to "hide" among the jumble of spines/skulls.  Even with the most advanced sonograms used on humans the doctor is sometimes wrong about the number of babies.  Also, sometimes dogs can have what are called "water babies" in a litter.  These puppies are not properly formed and actually have no bone mineralization so they don't show up on x-rays.  When they are born the look bloated like they are over-full of water.  "Water babies" always die within minutes of birth, so if all of your neighbor's puppies survived then it was just a matter of one of them being positioned so that the vet couldn't see it on the x-ray.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	One x-ray will not cause a birth defect.  Multiple x-rays can, but most vets will not take more than 2 within a few weeks time.  Usually only around days 53-56 of the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Your neighbor's dog was x-rayed because she wanted to see how many pups to expect.<br>  <br>  The reason one was missed could be due to a number of things - placement during the x-ray, bones not fully visible due to the mothers insides, or a fuzzy x-ray.  Doesn't mean the vet is "bad" or anything.|`|AA10356572	lots of things they do to pets they would never do to people<br>  <br>  if the owner wanted the dog xrayed it is them to blame because they knew the risk and took it anyhow..<br>  <br>  the fifth pup was hiden|`|k5mUMLJPaa	A vet will only xray a dog after the 55th day of pregnancy leaving only 8 to 10 days before delivery.  At this stage it has no adverse affect on the pups.  One thing about xrays it that it can still be had to tell exactly how many are in there if the bladder  if full it can hide a pup or three depending.|`|dl1OOOT8aa	That is why most breeders just do an ultrasound not an xray.  From what Im aware of, vets do xrays on pregnant dogs simply because there is no law that prevents it for animals just humans. Also a lot of smaller vet clinics just don't have ultrasound equipment so instead they opt for x-rays.|`|PM23RDycaa	X-rays are more accurate then ultrasounds for a puppy count. <br>  <br>  One pup could have been hiding the other or the pup was higher up than the others. <br>  <br>  So did she at least apologize for what happened? Because a responsible owner and breeder would have NEVER left a pregnant dog close to whelping with someone who didn't know anything about handling a pregnant dog.|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	x-rays aren't harmful after a certain period in pregnancy. X-rays can't give an exact on the number of puppies, they can only give an approximate. How many puppies show up depends on how they are arranged in the uterine horn.
oMmBhWK4aa	You should be able to, but too much of such organ meats are too rich and bad for long term health. Suggest not more than once a week. Beef heart is also a favourite of some large carnivorous fish. The main regular diet should be specialist cichlid pellets, but give them occasional treats of live foods for variety. If they don't eat the liver, take it out to prevent pollution. There's probably some risk of nasty stuff in raw meats though. Sometimes it's just trial & error to find out what particular species like and individuals differ too. Variety in their diet prevents boredom and makes for balanced nutrition.|`|hvJ3rQfFaa	Try it see what happens if they live why not?|`|4v7W5SBVaa	Hey you can feed them, but very little.

Aggressive dogs have no place in a group class and certainly no place in a group class that will take place off lead.  If my trainer allowed aggressive dogs to run off leash in a class where there weren't walls or fences separating them from the rest of the class I sure wouldn't continue to take classes there!<br>  <br>  Muzzles do NOT prevent dog attacks or bites, nor do they stop inter-dog aggression.  In fact, depending on why your dog is aggressive a muzzle might actually make the problem worse.  They do however lull you and other dog owners into a false sense of security which is just a dog bite waiting to happen.  You need to work with your dog more on leaving other dogs alone before you can consider taking her to group classes.
IrdZKYT3aa	It's a toss up.  <br>  Unfortunately there is no one hundred percent chance of her survival in there.<br>  However, putting her in there will not only help keep the babies safe, it will help keep the other fish from her and lower her stress level on that end.  Especially if you have a male housed with her, male livebearers will often harass the females, pregnant of not.<br>  I usually place my female guppies in a few days before I expect them to drop the fry.  This allows them to calm down in the new space so they don't stress out and loose the fry.<br>  Make sure to follow the instructions on "flushing" the box, they aren't known for the best filtration.

I'd let the water run near your horse while you're sponge bathing her so she gets accustomed to the sound. Just work on desensitizing her to being sprayed with water. If she's ok with having her legs sprayed then start there and every hot day spray her legs off. Once she is comfortable try moving up her body a little bit. Eventually she may get used to it.

However of a quality natural diet may be too much.<br>  <br>  The best rule of thumb is that you should be able to feel a dogs ribs, but not see them!|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	If you are feeding a premium quality food that is not full of grains and fillers then maybe she needs to be fed 3 times a day.  <br>  If the food does contain a lot of grains and fillers they are not digestible so not of much nutritional value to your pup.<br>  <br>  How old is the puppy?<br>  You should be able to feel the ribs but they should not be clearly visible.  A top quality food is your friend and you need to feed less of it than the cheaper brands.|`|02afccc3abbd7877c182c4b1daa8d2a9aa	I would say you're feeding your dog correctly.  We have a GS/mix, a full blooded GS and a Beagle/mix.  We feed the GS dogs 2 cups of food twice daily and the Beagle is 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup twice daily.<br>  <br>  Our dogs are well defined and I'm sure you've taken your pet to the Vet and if the Vet doesn't see a problem with her weight or definition of body then you're okay.  It could be a weather thing.  If you have warmer weather more often then you may want to up her food by a half or three quarters.<br>  <br>  Here we take back on some when it's colder because we can't get out to walk the dogs as often even though they have a yard to play in.

dJs2s9pfaa	10 gallons is plenty! If you are getting a frog only tank then 3 frogs per 1.5 gallons. <br>  <br>  African dwarf frogs should only be in tanks with peaceful community fish, such as a single Betta Fish, Coolie Loaches or Coolie Fish, Goldfish, Tetras, and even Bala Sharks. Most important though, if you start mixing the communities, is to watch for overcrowding. It is the number one cause for fish diseases, because it messes up the pH levels of the tank, and will eventually impact the health of your frogs as well.|`|fYbAS8xwaa	Sure 10 gallons is like a mansion for a dwarf.

8opg5OSQaa	Well, I am still working on getting my parents to agree to getting me some Leopard Gecko's so I will tell you how to ease them into the idea.<br>  <br>  1.Research-reaserch on the bearded dragon, wright a report on why you should have one and its health care ex.<br>  <br>  2.Dig up the money to pay for it, it will be expensive so be willing to pay for it.<br>  <br>  3.Clear an area for the tank and show all of these to the most marshmellowish parent you have. One will give in soon.<br>  <br>  (I am on stage two Leo's are amazingly expensive!)|`|AZKbJESUaa	Do research show your mom you know how to take care of it, what it needs to live, and study them learn allot about them this shows that you are interested in one.   <br>  This is what I did to get a corn snake, I first asked right off the bat and got shot down, the next day brought my parents 1 piece of paper on how to take care of them and some info about them and they said yes.  <br>  They think it is cool wanting to hold it when ever I have it out and showing new guests in the house my pet snake.  <br>   <br>  Of coarse there fascination with it lead them to asking me if I wanted a leo. <br>  Now I got a green tree python, A carpet python (getting a second soon so in a year when they reach sexual maturity I can breed them)  <br>  A second corn snake, I breed them now got 16 hatchlings .

eS8wuYRfaa	I currently own a Zilla Topper for reptiles and have used the one for small animals in the past.  They work well and are fairly easy to remove to clean the tank.  The only problem is if the topper itself needs cleaning.  It's all wire and very difficult to get in between.  I had to throw one of the small animal ones away because my rat got mites and we couldn't clean it well enough.  Sometimes too if your animal urinates on the wire (which does happen) it will start to rust after a while.  But, all in all, it's a good topper and worth the money.|`|XvqX0Vv5aa	Our son has a Zilla tank topper for his iguana tank and it works perfectly! Hope this helps!
jDPULfjKaa	have you even thought about the commitment!! They are NOT throw away pets! you can not just get a turtle for your birthday then not keep it correctly, abuse it, malnourish it then eventually kill it because you had no idea how to care for it!<br>  <br>  Turtles live 40 to 200 years. Pet aquatic turtles are a HUGE responsibility. they require a LARGE tank, with heating, filtration, lighting, land area, and a varied diet.<br>  <br>  it looks like this: <a href="http://i157.photobucket.com/albums/t65/TurtlePhoto_Album/TurtlePics003.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i157.photobucket.com/albums/t65/T...</a><br>  <br>  and thats a 100 gallon tank, and will need to be upgraded even bigger to a 150+ for 2 turtles.<br>  <br>  Turtle supplies cost a lot of money too. A tank = $50 (cheapest) A filter = $200, a heater = $40, a basking bulb + lamp = $30, a uvb bulb + light fixture = $60, 3 cans of pellets, 3 cans of different insects, leafy greens, live feeders = $30+, add that up it equals $400+ . Is that not a lot of money?<br>  <br>  in addition there is maintenance supplies! extra filter media every 3 weeks, clean and scrub the inside of the filter tubes, every month. Replace the water and scrub down everything in the tank every 3 weeks. Scoop out turtle poo and other waste with a large net, TWICE everyday. Feed in a seperate container every other day. Yada yada yada.<br>  <br>  Do you get my point? they are a lot of hard work, a lot of money and a lot of sweat and effort! Peek ( a turtle keeper and friend) has had her turtles for almost 37 years, in a pond outside......<br>  <br>  DO YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE THAT KIND OF COMMITMENT?<br>  <br>  <br>  to answer your question, there are hundreds sitting in reptile rescues, and up for adaption on giveaway websites. Why, because the owner realized the commitment, and could not make such a promise.<br>  <br>  i hope you take in my answer, and never get any animal before knowing how huge of a commitment it is going to be to take care of the animal. you are 13 you, don't even have a job, parents will have to pay hundreds of dollars for the pet's supplies. And in this economy, your parents could lose their job any day now. stop being so selfish and wake up to smell the reality of REAL LIFE!|`|8opg5OSQaa	Nearest Pet Store|`|vS1Z0inOaa	There are quite a few online breeders and turtle rescue organizations I know of. If you could specify what kind of turtle you are wanting to get I can help you locate one. It would be best to buy one from a breeder rather than from a pet store that most likely sells them collected from the wild.|`|f7Ftz9gkaa	At your local pond, creek, river, lake, or swimming hole.|`|xtcSsPPwaa	PetsMart|`|rAAHHYEWaa	the mall|`|zltJwdYyaa	well i don't recommend getting one from the wild because they might have issues... try a pet store located in a strip center; it's a whole lot cheaper than the big companies such as PetSmart and PetCo|`|UW97kf4Baa	You can get one at PetCo for a resonible price.|`|UcmRqoKeaa	i think Petco that's where i'm getting my lizard that i asked here|`|egOzHS8Jaa	You can get your pet on pet shop. there is so many type of pets you can get from there..............|`|fVVbVpTPaa	pet smart or a pet store but there are diffrent kinds of turtle than may be better for you to care for so do some research 1st
Rdpv91NTaa	umm sorry but that is a male this is a picture of a platy but you can tell the difference.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://thesmileyfish.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/tropicalfish010.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://thesmileyfish.com/wp-content/uplo...</a>|`|iZml58CAaa	Very likely......guppies are sexually mature at a very young age. They are live bearers and are fertilized internally. Females can store sperm for up to 6 months and use them when they are ready if no male is around. Hard to tell from the pic, but if the fishes scales are popping up, and it gets bloated looking, it has dropsy, and will probably die. More likely it is pregnant.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.doggonehairy.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.doggonehairy.net/</a>|`|9QF6GGyiaa	Your guppy definitely looks pregnant. But once the guppies are born most likely the mother will eat them.|`|25CAIGfeaa	Yea it's pregnant.|`|AtLdnZd5aa	looks like it to me|`|pQWZNafqaa	No, sorry, it is not pregnant. It is a male. Look at the "fin" on the bottom of the fish, the long one that doesnt quite look like a fin. That is the male fishes penis. Females are usually larger than the males, and not as colorful. Both the fish in the picture are males. Also, you can tell a female is pregnant because you can actually SEE inside the cavity where the fry are. If you have any fish that have a dark brown or black spot/area on the back part of its stomach, it is a female.<br>  <br>  I have bred guppies before, and I can tell you that it isnt hard at all. The hardest part is keeping the fry alive long enough for them to grow into adults, which takes a surprisingly long time.<br>  <br>  Sorry if I disappointed you, but your fish IS NOT PREGNANT. I AM 100% SURE that it is a MALE.|`|yVsuERSFaa	I think so. some symptoms of pregnacy are: she becomes a loner, she goes near the heater, when she is almost ready to give birth her stomach will turn into a square shape, males will sniff her udder, her gravid spot will become darker, she will get fatter.
yf0tevyfaa	I don't think cats have the ability to truly hate a person. She may be annoyed with what you are doing if in fact you are interacting with her at the time of biting and smacking.<br>  <br>  My kitten loves to smack my boyfriends head when he sleeps for some reason. It's not a mean smack, just a curious "bap" on the head. He also loves to smack at my bangs when they hang down.<br>  <br>  As for the nose nibbling, we here in my household call this "Love nibbles". Only one of our four cats do it, but he clearly does it out of pure affection. I don't know why, but some cats and dogs love to nibble the tip of the nose, chin, or cheek. Usually when he does it, he'll rub his face against our cheek and then take a quick little nibble on the tip of the nose. Sometimes it's a little too powerful but most of the time it is tender.<br>  <br>  I can't say for sure this is what is going on with your cat because I cannot see the actual behavior but I think your best bet is to observe and take mental notes of what's happening when she does it. That way, you can change what you are doing if you are doing something wrong. If she is doing it with anger (signs are ears back, tail flipping around) then stop whatever you are doing, that is her way of telling you that she doesn't like that. If not, then she may just be playful, affectionate, or curious.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you  (:|`|35f126768433fb7bc9a5037cf6657dbcaa	the nips and bites are actually "kitty kisses" she likes you and want to express her affection for you, <br>  it is a cat culture thing...<br>  the paw smacks are play, she is simply playing with you.|`|jfwmelYgaa	Yes..... she hates you because you are weak and she knows it.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Since this just started recently, you need to have her evaluated by a vet.  8 years is not an old cat but it seems something is going on since she suddenly began to act aggressively.  She could also be stressed.  Has anything changed in the house? Cats can become stressed by the slightest of change (moving furniture around, a new friend coming over, etc). Stress can be dealt with effectively in most cases by using a Feliway diffuser to calm the cat.|`|vv2uk9hHaa	The biting is probably because she wants something. My old cat used to bite my mom like that when he wanted to be fed. My new cat puts his paw on my face quite often, but that's just a way of saying he likes me I guess. Remember that they can only really "feel" with their paws, the rest of their body is covered in fur so they only get an impression of pressure, they don't have the same sensation as we have with our bare hands.. except on their paws. Gently take her paws and put them down when she does that.|`|II5N7XYKaa	Don't worry, she doesn't "hate" you.  Cats' emotions aren't that sophisticated.<br>  <br>  Regardless of the reason she does it, she must find it rewarding somehow.  Try making it a negative experience everytime she does it.  For example, keep a squirt bottle handy and squirt her whenever she does it.|`|HQFUnslhaa	The same thing happened to me with my cat a few years ago. She was always in a bad mood and would try to scratch me. I have no idea why, but whenever I want to play with her now she is so affectionate and even lets me tickle her. Maybe just a phase they go through.  (I've also had her since she was a kitten)|`|GwwOoZdFaa	Depending on the nature of the cat it could be curious of your face.. or it may be showing affection. If you have glasses or freckles or anything that stands out it will paw at you or it has sight problems... You may want to take the cat to a vet to get checked out.|`|xuCY36yWaa	KEEP YOUR FACE AWAY ,OUT OF ITS REACH.SOMETHING IS UP SETTING IT.TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT.|`|VDFpYjCmaa	PUNCH HER!!!|`|ZTZBItU0aa	she's playing. try flicking her on the end of the nose when she bites. it works for ferrets
dJs2s9pfaa	Yeah Melafix never helped me either. I personally use Lifeguard by Jungle Labs ($5 at LFS) an all in one med for a wide range of bacterial,viral and parasitic illnesses. It has saved many of my fish in the past. <br>  <br>  Also be sure to use  Aquarium Salt. Use 1 tbsp per 5 gallons and it helps build up immunity and healthy slime coat. Cichlids like brackish water a great deal. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps=)|`|25CAIGfeaa	Keep up with Melafix. Is the carbon insert removed because the carbon insert dissolves the medicine.|`|pQWZNafqaa	It may be "hole-in-the-head" disease. If that is the case, then there is not a whole lot you can do. My bichir fish got it, and virtually all of the flesh was taken off its skull, but it survived and is recovering right now.<br>  Hole in the head is usually fatal.<br>  <br>  BTW I just bought a cichlid today! Arent they great???
JpH6FAlBaa	Well a Border collie would be great but they do tend to be a little neurotic sometimes and distructive..no always but sometimes ,,for you by the sounds of your lifestyle and what you want from a dog I would suggest a Labrador, Weimaraner, Alsatian, Doberman something along those lines. Herding dogs while smart must be kept busy at all times they tend to get carried away and find their own things to do and it is usually not in the owners best interest lol same as JRT . Staffordshire Terrier would be suitable too|`|tmGRe2Jraa	Many dogs at shelters aren't purebreds.  If you go in looking for a particular breed you may or may not find one, and even if you do, it might not exhibit the characteristics or temperament that you're looking for.  Besides, a lot of what you're looking for has more to do with training than breed.  Your best bet is to go in with an open mind and get to know the dogs a bit before you make a final decision.  Almost any shelter will give you the opportunity to take the dog out and play with it a bit before you commit to adopting.|`|oBwU1zB6aa	I would have to say that a border collie is the best they love to run so they need a lot of exercise but they are very loyal they are great with kids but they also protect their territorry, if you dont like this type of dog go to iams.com and you can take the quiz they will find the purfect breed for you.<br>      hope this helps:)|`|nIP5bRVzaa	a labardor retreivor|`|bIaywrBCaa	border collie or australian shepherd.

0f3fde633bd5c269a5dc7fc600702cccaa	I also have a cat with renal failure. His values are BUN/45 and CREA/3.5.  He may have had it for longer but we first noticed it 3 years ago.  He has done very well and his values have not changed in that time.  I have him on Royal Canin Low Protein and Hills K/D because he is kind of picky and some days he will only eat one or the other.  I also give him good quality protein like boiled chicken and occasionally Blue Wilderness chicken or turkey.  There is a lot of research that says a really good quality protein is ok to feed.  So far I haven't had to do sub-q fluids or hospitalize him in the 3 years he has had this.  There is so much new research on renal failure in cats.  Lowering phosphorus may be of more benefit than lowering protein.  Unfortunately even though you can slow the progression of the disease it will never completely go away. Good Luck.  E mail me if I can be of help.|`|AA11887983	If he is not lifting his head, his potassium level may be low.  check with your vet, to see if this might be the case.

We have lost 5 cats to CRF over the past 5 years.<br>  <br>  The vet can monitor the cat's condition and the levels of various substances in the cat's blood.<br>  <br>  Some need to be increased and some need to be reduced. The numbers which give an indication of the cat's condition are the kidney numbers - BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) and creatinine.<br>  <br>  Both of these substances increase as the kidneys become more and more impaired.<br>  <br>  There is one thing you can do for your cat at home. You spoke of him getting fluids - I assume the vet was giving him fluids at the vet office.<br>  <br>  You can do the same thing at home.<br>  <br>  Additional fluids help reduce the workload of the kidneys.<br>  <br>  The vet will give the fluids as an IV (Inter Venous). You can give the fluids subcutaneous (under the skin)<br>  <br>  Do to this, you will need an IV bag of fluids (usually Lactated Ringers Solution - LRS), needles, and IV tubing.<br>  <br>  All of these are prescription only and you'll need a prescription from your vet. You can probably buy these from the vet but you will pay up to as much as 9 times the cost as you would if you get a prescription and purchase them yourself.<br>  <br>  Everything has to be done in a manner to not contaminate the fluid, needle, or tubing.<br>  <br>  A short explanation of the procedure is this:<br>  <br>  You take the stopper out of the IV bag and push the tip of the IV tubing set into the bag. Then you remove the protective cover from the other end of the IV tubing set and put a needle on that end of the tubing.<br>  <br>  Now you immerse the IV bag in hot water until it is about body temperature. Do not let the end of the bag attached to the IV tubing or the needle get in the water.<br>  <br>  Once the fluid is warmed up, you put the cat on your lap and pull up the skin at their shoulders and insert the needle under the skin, not vertically - that would hurt.<br>  <br>  Then you squeeze the bag to inject fluid under the cat's skin.<br>  <br>  The usual dosage is 100 ml.<br>  <br>  There are more details to be observed, but that is the basic procedure.<br>  <br>  Email me for more information.<br>  <br>  You need to understand that your cat's kidneys will never be cured - CRF is for ever.<br>  <br>  Email me for more information
zTeLhroWaa	yes.  they absorb heat from their bellies and need it to digest food.|`|GZ0sh4pmaa	yes it does not only because it helps reach the right temperatures but because after you feed your gecko the heat on your gecko belly will aid in digestion. it will also help when the temperature lowers at night and your geckos looking for some extra heat.|`|0yK8Sw8eaa	yes you need a light at one end and the heating pad on the other side under what ever you are using as be ding so at it can get out of the light and still will be heat|`|8opg5OSQaa	YES|`|wLgGD63raa	If you're not using a lamp then yes, your gecko does need a heating pad.<br>  <br>  I would suggest a heating pad over a light anyways, leos are nocturnal animals and don't need light anyways.

XEbe4Votaa	Exercise, fun, strength training.<br>  <br>  Strong neck and head muscles are good for lots of breeds, especially the ones with big 'ol heads...lol.|`|GpiRaSvPaa	Both. My husband and I own a 3 year old male American Pit Bull Terrier that LOVES his spring pole. We have owned 3 APBTs in all and we have had up to as many as 10 APBTs (including our 3 at the time) living in our home at once! All of them have LOVED the spring poles we have had. All of our dogs have been family pets, so we didn't get a spring pole specifically to build muscle, however, that does happen. We just got them for fun. It's great exercise for the dogs and they really enjoy it. <br>  <br>  I also wanted to add that spring poles are not just for the "pit bull" breeds, or bully breeds. I have met some people that seem to think they are something that just "pit bull" or bully breed owners buy. I have even met someone that thought spring poles were something that only fighting dogs used, which is not true at all. As I already said, we got them for our dogs for fun, and at the same time, they are great for exercise. <br>  <br>  Here are a couple sites that I just found on how to build a spring pole. I hope these help.

034f5753f9ad6567e841eda4b3bd8210aa	palomino's right.  You don't want to push too rich a feed program on a young horse or you could end up with epiphysitis, problems with tight check ligaments which require surgery to correct, or even an unruly horse that has too much energy it can't exercise off.  I've had good luck just by supplementing with a good quality mineral block that has extra copper, zinc, and cobalt in it.  The brand I use is called "Micro Equine".  I get them in individual sized blocks at my local farm store.<br>  <br>    I would not be feeding a yearling more than 14% total protein at all.  That includes hay and grain.  Oats are fine and if that is coupled with grass hay you should be ok.  There are some vitamin supplements out there, but you need to look for something with copper, cobalt and zinc in it because these minerals help keep growing joints and ligaments and tendons from getting bad.  I like Copperquine, but it is getting hard to find.|`|MUfMJYHGaa	Please talk to your vet.

RUzBDX6Jaa	relaxed tail head is a sign<br>  wax is a sign of one day (aprox)<br>  belly dropping is a sign that baby is getting into birthing position<br>  rubbing tailhead is a sign<br>  not wanting people touching her is a sign.<br>  Has she been avoiding other horses/people?  Wanting to be alone?<br>  I think she will foal really soon- start watching her (if you do the foaling attendant thing) and if not, then just be prepared to walk into her stall with a foal's clumsy legs right there in front of you.<br>  :)<br>  Aren't maiden mares great (not.. haha)<br>  Good luck with the foal- have fun.  Please post pictures when it is born- I'd love to help you come up with a name!<br>  EDIT<br>  I came back here to see if anyone gave me a thumbs up or thumbs down- thats just what I do- and I saw LittleFilly's answer.  No, mares do not always foal at night.  About 80% of mares foal at night because they do prefer to foal in the dark, but if their water breaks in daylight, then that's just when they are going to foal- they can't change that.  Be prepared for any time of day/night (even 4 in the morning) and maybe you should inform your vet.  Maybe they could come give a quick ultrasound or just a check.  Odd question, but is her vulva dropping/relaxing?  If it is, foaling may or may not be close.  Keep watch at her water/hay intake and urination/pooping patterns.  if they start changing/lessening/rising substantially, foaling may be near!  and labour looks like colic, so if you see something that looks like colic in your horse, she may be in labour.|`|MUfMJYHGaa	Congratulations!!  Expect a baby in the next few days, but don't intrude on the process. make sure she has lots of room and good clean bedding. And call your vet if you are new at this so they can tell you what to look for in a normal birth, what to do with the placenta and how to handle (or not handle) the baby.One of the worst things you can do with a maiden mare is to interrup the mare/foal bonding process by jumping in and "imprinting" . Give them some time alone if all is well.There is lots of time later  for you to bond with the baby|`|sKZbK6Y5aa	its very hard to pinpoint exactly when she will drop the foal. we have had mares that waxed for a week before foaling. the best rule i have found is that when her sides go flat,tailhead is relaxed,shes waxing and or drops of milk,her private area has elongated.(FYI also  alot of maiden mares exhibit bizarre behaviour.) its pretty close to foaling time and the mare should not be left alone. have fun!! good luck!!!|`|TTLIp8Beaa	waxing up happens about 24 hours before she gives birth.<br>  so yes, i would say it's coming up soon.|`|psNR7hDJaa	Instead of asking YA where people can give false answers, call your vet!|`|JcwQ4nK7aa	since this is your mare's first foal, don't be surprised by anything! we have had mares wax up, drip milk and look like the foal was coming -only to stop and go 'on hold' for 3 or 4 days!!! just keep an eye on her but don't make her nervous with your constant presence.... our mares always foal at night when no one is 'watching'.....|`|UZBl63blaa	WHAT AN AWFUL ,MONTH TO HAVE A FOAL.

f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Neutered means the cat's testicles are removed.  It's a very safe operation that most cats recover from in a couple of days time.  Having him neutered takes away his sex drive which means he won't be prone to territorial spraying (peeing on stuff to leave his scent) and he won't be running off for miles looking for a mate. Neutered cats are less likely to develop prostate problems and the risk of developing testicular cancer is eliminated.  Neutered cats are unable to get females pregnant.  Here's a website that tells all about it<br>  <a href="http://www.marvistavet.com/html/neutering_the_male_cat.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.marvistavet.com/html/neuterin...</a>|`|m7KyfJnKaa	It means castration.

pYF9KnNeaa	The band on your bird would have been placed on by the breeder.  At least it was, assuming it is a closed band, with no seams at all.  It is done primarily for the breeder's use.  They use them for record keeping.  The information on them is not nearly as useful to the owner as you might think.  You would have to know the breeder, then ask them what the other information on the band means.  If you would like to place another question, giving me the information that is on the band, I'll be glad to help you if possible.  But keep in mind, the odds are against any of us being able to tell you anything for sure.  As for "registering" your bird, I'm not sure what you mean exactly but to my knowledge, no one keeps such a registry.  Yes, you could have him micro chipped but that has nothing to do with registering.  That is for identification purposes only, in the event he is ever lost.  Just keep in mind that a micro chip is only as good as the person who finds him.  If he is ever stolen or even if he is only lost, unless someone takes him to a vet to have him scanned, the chip will not bring him home to you.  Consider that if he is stolen, that's the last thing a robber would do.  I hope this helps.|`|7HEZhx46aa	That's not what a leg band is for. You don't get registration papers -- there's no AKC for birds. Leg bands are for the breeders' record keeping purposes.

That can help identify him in the future. But leg bands can get lost or removed (by thieves). Microchipping is the method used today but not everyone agrees that birds should be microchipped. I've included a couple links below that you might find interesting about microchipping.<br>  <br>  @bruce also mentioned that there's not a single source for registering leg bands. I've included a link to a good Yahoo Group about Leg Bands that you might find useful.|`|Yr4eBnXlaa	Have you vet record the leg band info in your bird's vet records, and have him microchipped.  <br>  <br>  The band itself is your only proof that he was captive bred.    Microchips can and do fail, so don't have his leg band removed unless it is medically necessary.
QaJGkXp2aa	She was a stray. People don't give cats credit for the emotionally complex creatures they are, but if she was a house cat previously, then her time as a stray was probably pretty traumatic. Now you represent protection, love, and security. Good on you!|`|KdR1Lx3yaa	SHE WANTS ATTENTION SHE WILL GET USED TO U PICKING HER UP TAKES TIME .. MAYBE GET HER SOME TOYS OR TOYS WITH CATNIP AND A SCRATCH PAD?.|`|vv2uk9hHaa	She just likes you. Cats are sociable and curious creatures. They like to be around you and see what you're doing. My cat follows me around 24/7, he gets sad when I lock him out of the bathroom for 5 minutes : / he walks right next to me at all times. My cousin's cat does that too. She walks right next to her at all times, adoringly looking at her. She ran into a wall doing that once, too. Poor siamese, didn't look where she was going. But cats like to follow their people. It's a good sign she does it, means she trusts you.|`|YDF4TSjWaa	well she wants you to pay attention to her but not to hold her just to pet her... she also feels scared in your house when your not with her... so she will follow you to make sure you r ok and that nobody hurts you or her!!!<br>  <br>  i hope that helps!!!|`|DwYX4pAvaa	She loves you.

4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	You have to do research on that in your local community.  Vet prices will vary all over the US.  Low-cost spay/neuter clinics may be available through your humane society.<br>  <br>  You can call 1-800-SPAYUSA or go to their website to find low-cost clinics in your area.|`|XxU94aKlaa	Pull out your phone book and just start calling and asking- Prices vary pretty much everywhere.<br>  Spaying a female usually costs a bit more than neutering a male and an additional fee is usually tacked on if the female is in heat as well.<br>  If you call your local animal shelter they can generally tell you where to get the procedure done cheaply or at times even based on your income.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	In Milwaukee the humane society AND animal control have low cost neuter/spay programs.  Male cats are $40 and females are $60 for instance.  Contact your local groups and ask, they'll quote you over the phone.|`|ptNy4uicaa	male animals are cheaper, younger animals are cheaper.<br>  Usually between $150 for males and $300 maximum for the procedure alone, no shots, etc.
9kceDOTraa	Nix the Demasoni, too aggressive for this mix, especially with only a 40 gallon fooprint, and the Venustus too large for that tank when full grown.  <br>  <br>  The Jewels are a bit borderline here since they are actually a Riverine African, not a rift lake, and actually dwell in water similar to that of South Americans, but you could probably work this guy in.<br>  <br>  Get one species of Peacock too.  Keep in mind, only the male Peacocks are going to have any color and having three males in a 40, that's pushing having some tempers going.  You have to remember, you only have a 40 gallon footprint here, 1 Mbuna, the Riverine and Peacocks.  I know this seems light, but you must also respect the aggressive levels males tend to take on.<br>  <br>  On the bottom feeders, you could try the albino bristle's, but you may also as well enjoy something like a Polka dot Botia, or even cories.  With only 1 Mbuna species and 1 male of that on top of it, you probably would have little issues with Cories.  I keep cories in all my African tanks and they have worked out quite well.|`|25CAIGfeaa	put african cichlids with african cichlids. if they are african cichlids they should be fine|`|omBhu3gjaa	i agree, although i love demasoni, they might be too agressive for these other cichlids. as for other suggestions, I really like kenyi, which are golden males and dark blue females. another very colorful cichlid is a cynotilapia. (although these take patience, i have one of these and they are rather bland looking as juvenilies but i cant wait for it to morph because they have really nice colors as adults). my last recommendation would be a couple perlmutts. i also have these in my cichlid tank and really like them. the males will turn a pearly light blue color with back and yellow striped fins. also as far as a cleaner, i just have a chinese algea eater in my tank. he does a good job and was inexpensive. as long as he is the same size or bigger than your cichlids he will do fine holding his own against them. but most plecos should be fine with the cichlids as they are not a threat to the cichlids, just try and get one around the same or bigger size then your cichlids
yMbw0Osnaa	what you describe is the onset of the mating ritual.the male will regurgitate food to his hen ,groom her ,and yes try to climb on her back.when the hen is responsive to his advances you will see her go into a sort of trance and her eyes will dilate and she will bow down on the perch and raise her tail then the male will climb on her back and copulate with her.he whistles and sings to her and rubs his beak up and down hers.she may be a little young yet and not ready to breed.all the signs are there though so good luck.have you given them a nest box?put a small amount of damp wood shavings in it.she will throw most of it out.dont stress and dont replace it.you want moma bird to concentrate on her eggs and young and not cleaning house.hope this helps|`|gdvCvWrLaa	well if they arem mating this is what it would look like.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uLCEWYAvVY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uLCEWYAv...</a><br>  <br>  sorry. lol. but you asked what the signs were.

qOiv8d3Laa	You have done everything but call out the professional exterminator!!!  If you haven't seen any fleas, you should be in the clear.  But if you DO find some in the future, don't freak out so much depending upon the number of them you see.  Only a couple, no problem, just spray with bug spray.  If there are many, then you will have to go through the "process" again.  Fleas are like ice bergs, whatever is visible is only a small portion of the actual number.  But if you do not have a dog or other animal that goes outside any longer, your flea problems should be at an end.<br>  <br>  Have you considered a cat?  I have three, and in the years I've had them have only seen maybe 4 fleas on them in over 8 years with them.  And a flea/tick collar works just fine.<br>  <br>  <br>  Me.. kittyslave23...

JpH6FAlBaa	There is a difference between honey and sugar..just like there is a difference between fructose and glucose..one is natural one is refined..honey is natural but of course only feed it in small quantities.we give our dogs honey a peanut butter on toast for a treat|`|bIaywrBCaa	It is good for small dogs who have low sugar problems but not recommended for regular use. Too much sugar is bad for them and honey is indeed sugar.|`|VnNyHkImaa	I have never heard anything about honey being bad for dogs. I had a yorkie that had blood sugar problems and the vet had me give him honey twice a day. I just wouldnt give it to YOUNG puppies. Its sticky, and i would worry about them swallowing it. After they are able to handle solid food i wouldnt consider it a problem. <br>  <br>  Plus, Im sure they think its good!! :) It is high in copper, calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, enzymes, protien, carbs and vitamin c. It is a strong anti bacterial, natural sedative, a laxative, immune bulider and energy enhancing predigested food.<br>  <br>  Most vets would probably recommend royal jelly above honey, but im sure your dog would disagree. :)|`|JRqzkUxUaa	A holistic vet recommended honey for our dog when she had a terrible respiratory infection and horrible cough. What we bought was high quality raw honey from the health food store, not the overly processed junk in the grocery store. There is a big difference.  The cough syrup she had been prescribed didn't work at all but the honey really soothed her throat and she was able to get some much needed sleep instead of coughing every few minutes.

y31mee4Faa	If you & he interact now, he'll prefer the company of his new mate & may not interact with you any longer.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|Gr6Xe1gGaa	That would be a great idea to do. Although, you can't just put the new bird in his cage right away you have to let them get used to eachother. You do that by buying a separate cage good enough for one parakeet. Put the new bird in that cage and place that cage next to your original parakeet for about a week. you might notice them getting close to eachother on that side of the cage that is facing eachother. Try letting them out of their cages so they can interact with eachother. If the male doesn't seem to like that female then return that bird and get a new female and see if that works. It usually works the first try. Also, remember try to get a female parakeet close to his age so they don't fight even though females are dominant in cages the male might not respect her if she is young. A parakeet is young if it still that those bars on its forehead. Here is a site about their ages if you need it...<a href="http://www.budgieplace.com/age.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.budgieplace.com/age.html.</a> I hope this helps Sorry if I'm giving you information you already know.

Jkt3UkTBaa	I'm guessing this is Freshwater.<br>  <br>    If that is the case, stick with one big fish, it's much easier and you will not have to worry about aggression, compatibility, gravel types and so on.<br>  The fish I recomend you get is an Oscar fish, they are sooo full of personality and if they are kept in right conditions they can live up to 10-15 years!!<br>  This is what you will need to care for them:<br>  30+ gallon tank<br>  No decorations he can knock over<br>  Don't even bother with fake or real plants because he will rip them out of the ground.<br>  A very thorough filter, for a 100 gallon or 80 gallon at least.<br>  These are very messy fish and will require every other week or every week 50 % water changes and 1-2 daily feeding of a varied diet, blood worms, Cichlid Staple, Romain LLettuce and so on.<br>  <br>  All you will need in the tank is, a filter, 4-5 big rocks (not too big
IrdZKYT3aa	I'd be careful adding more, you want to keep a close eye on each one to make sure they are eating well.<br>  Also, each is going to reach about 4-5 inches in length, so at full size you'll be pretty much stocked.  Perhaps one or two more if you're water quality is consistantlly good once you have it fully cycled and these guys all introduced.<br>  I don't think you'll have any aggression problems, and it seems like you should be able to comfortably house them all together.<br>  Just make sure to offer fresh veggies and sinking chips for them to munch on.  And a few live plants every now and then might be enjoyed as well!<br>  Best of Luck!|`|a2cjwMKcaa	You can probably make it work.<br>  <br>  The problem with a Pleco only tank is that you turn on the lights and it looks empty. <br>  <br>  The tank may be able to support more fish, but plecos can be a bit territorial so watch for agression if you overcrowd them.<br>  <br>  But if you like Plecos, no reason you cant do it.<br>  <br>  Ian|`|MPQI8Bg3aa	I don't think it would work...All of your fish will occupy the same area of the tank and so they will be competing for the same resources. Also, many plecos get territorial and so they will probably get nasty with each other. If you wanted to do a specialty tank like this I recommend a tank that is long but not tall and probably a fair amount bigger than this...40 gal or so.

You might enjoy a little spraying if you like attracting pussy.|`|Amkmles0aa	yes|`|RN1wGlWWaa	If both cats are spayed and neutered and you take introductions slow, then he probably will not spray (my cats never did).  But if they are not altered, then its a high chance they will not only spray, but they will breed.    So if they are not altered now, get him done before you bring home any other cat (male or female).|`|J6kMNre7aa	Male cats spray to mark their territory, but they do  that too if they have a mate.. Be careful, I think you  should neuter your male, unless your planning for kittens.    If he is an outdoor cat beware, he will fight alot. My one  cat I had a couple of years ago wasn't fixed, he fought  constantly. Now I have another, he fights here and there.  And he is a little over a year old and not fixed.    I'm going to fix him asap. He doesn't spray in the house  though, like my other cat did. He wakes up at around  4 am to 5:45 am to eat, then go outside to go to the bathroom.|`|HAT8jivxaa	well it depends on how old he is . my girl cat was in heat last week and i have a boy kitten but he didn't spray.
feUxjBbnaa	He is going to start spraying urine in your house if you don't neuter him. You must neuter or your house is going to smell like a toilet! It's really not that big a deal to have your cat neutered.  I promise!  Remember, it's not YOUR balls dude. lol  He will be so much happier, more calm, no urge to mark territory with his URINE, not "frustrated" constantly, less meowy, and he won't be humping on that poor female that has no desire now that she's been spayed!  : O    edit: I felt bad about doing it to our males, I even procrastinated a few extra months, but I still went through with it.  They don't think about it like we do though, so they don't really know their "family-jewels" are about to be altered. : )    EDIT:  YES IT WILL START THE TYPICAL UN-NEUTERED MALE CAT BEHAVIOR WITH THE FEMALE THERE.  It doesn't matter if she's spayed or not.  I would call the vet, set up the neuter appt., and keep them separated as far as possible until he gets neutered.  Even if it's a week.  Keep them separated until he's recovered, then introduce them gradually and slowly.      * I think it's awesome that you want to give him another feline companion!* : )|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	You may want to get him neutered , he may start spraying in the house with another cat around.   It may take a while for both of them to adjust.. Start the new cat in a room like a bathroom let her get used to her environment for a few days before you introduce.|`|MYhQqeV7aa	Your female cat is not "spaded", she is spayed. It is not true  that a typical male cat owner does not have his male cat neutered. Only irresponsible men do not have it done.|`|DtkLsetkaa	He is going to have some possible behavior issues if a new female is introduced, more so as a territorial thing.  He will probably start spraying, and may act very territorial about food and toys etc.  You really want to give some thought to getting him fixed, its much better for his health and attitude.    Regardless of any other reasons, your male cat will be much happier and much  healthier, your new cat will be happier, and you will be happier because your house will not smell like cat pee.  Its not a big deal to get your cat neutered.  Please consider it before you introduce the new cat.

AA12006477	it's probably a chinese crested.  they are mostly hairless except for their feet, tail and ears.  http://www.pedigreedatabase.com/dogs/i/c...  is this dog u r talking about?|`|IdSqunZuaa	Yeah, you got the right description. This is the one you're describing, http://dogtime.com/chinese-crested.html. Awesome dog!|`|AA10229248	Sounds like a Chinese Crested.|`|I5wje0J1aa	I love my Palmerian.

a2cjwMKcaa	The fish and tank dont NEED to have live plants, in fact having dieing plants in a tank is much worse than having none.    Many types of plant that are sold as aquarium species are quite hard to grow, need special lights, fertiliser, added CO2 etc.    Good fake plants will provide the cover the fish like, and decorate the tank for you. Or get some easy to grow live plants like Java fern or Moss. They will grow in almost any tank setup.    Ian|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Hey, how are you.  Yes you can use fake plants. In fact fake plants can be used with any fish. Its hard to keep live plants alive because the need lots of light. About 5 watts per gallon of water, also a supplement like Flora Pride by Tetra and a Co2 system would go a long way to promote growth. But if you don't want the Extra hassle and want to just worry about the plants then feel free. They do no harm.     Good Luck to you, Mickey    O ya and just a side note, you should get 3 more cardinals and 3 more Rasboras because they like to and do Better in schools.  Watch the gourami too, when he gets bigger he may find them a nice snack. Unless hes a dwarf, your ok in that case.    Edit: You can keep that many fish in a 10 gallon. Its not a problem as long as you add them over time and not all at once. Also you should keep up on your 35 % weekly water changes and Gravel Vacuum. The problem only comes when your lazy and you let maintenance slide.  I have One 10 gallon right not that has 20 Neon Tetras in it. Its just a little side project of mine, I have many tanks and breed fish. If I can do it anybody can, WITH the proper care and upkeep.|`|TYohMrlXaa	Your fish would love the cover of any plants, real of fake. There is no problem with using fake plants, they wouldn't help the water quality like real ones would, but they don't hurt it. Make sure you buy ones specifically for aquariums though.|`|W6hHqgpGaa	Maybe you should try using real plants that are easy.  I really like java moss and java fern.  they both do well in a wide varity of water conditions very low light to alot of light,  very cold 62 to very warm 86 or so degrees.  they are really cool looking too imho ;) they will do wonders for your water quality!!|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	Although Mickey is correct in saying that those are schooling fish, I wouldn't put 11 two-inch fish in a 10 gallon tank.  That's too many for that amount of water.

YyXtxeNGaa	Teach him to drink from a straw.    Actually there are devices called nipple waterers that are used to minimize water spillage.  The animal simply bites down on the device and water flows.  They are sized depending on the amount of water flow you want.    http://www.valleyvet.com/ct_detail.html?...  http://www.qcsupply.com/Catalogs/12012.a...|`|AA10229248	Probably not. Some dogs are just messy drinkers. I have one that insists on drinking from the bottom of the bowl so he gets his whole face wet. I have another one that sometimes forgets to swallow so he walks away dribbling water until he remembers to swallow or opens his mouth and dumps water everywhere. I've never found a way to fix the problem so I just live with it.|`|FewhKlx9aa	There really is nothing unless you put a large area rug the whole width and lengh of the drool..I have a little peke that puts his head in sidways so his whole ear goes in the water dish so I'm always waiting there with a towel to mop him up..|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	i put a placemat under mine.     Hmmm..  how about a carpet runner?|`|p7swtBYzaa	I doubt it, some dogs are just sloppy drinkers.  I have one who gulps and then spits half of it on the floor, another who just about bathes in the water bowl, splashing it all over.   Forget putting ice cubes in the bowl, they get played with all over the house.    I keep a Swifter nearby, just mop up the water, less frustrating and doesn't help to yell at the dogs - they're just being dogs and this is a pretty minor nuisance considering how sweet they normally are.|`|eDySIDPQaa	Maqts will not stop the water dripping at all.    I have my large dogs, Newfoundland and Akita with tall water dishes, way up off the floor, they stopped dripping all over the place, the tall dishes allows the dogs to drink and get the water down and not hold it in their mouths, low water dishes causes a dog to hold the water in the mouth longer, since their head and neck are bent down to drink, it holds in the mouth instead of going down like it should.    Try the tall dishes on legs and see if this helps you out.    It stopped my dogs from dripping all over the place, no water held in their mouths, all down....    good luck|`|vHPXAH5Jaa	Put a mat underneath the bowl, to soak the water up.|`|KSpnZ0QHaa	erm i suggest you grow some grass and put the water dish there the water drips water your grass XD HA HA!!!!    no seriusly the grass can obsorb water serius|`|zSOnXtiQaa	Both of my shepherds are the same way. They end up with water all over their heads, legs, paws and tons of it on the ground. I just keep a towel near the dishes and when i hear them drink i just wipe it up, its a pain but i haven't found any other options =(|`|1c74cc7ee9876780e94d288d920e0d0aaa	I wish!  One of my dogs, who is close to 14 dribbles water all over my kitchen.  Not much I can do about it.  He also seems to drool more now, so I'm forever cleaning my floor.
eDySIDPQaa	Some dogs will do this if they have been kept in a crate or very small place to go potty...they have had no real room to bend the back end to poop or pee, so he holds his butt in the air as he does not realize he now has room to do it right....    We have had dogs like this come from puppy mills into the shelter, they were kept  bunces together in small crates and could not poop right, so they stand on front paws and poop with rump in the air.    this could be the reason he is doing it...|`|vHPXAH5Jaa	He wanted to make sure he was marking the objects. Territory markings.|`|a1uoxczTaa	my small dogs do that too, especially my Min Pin. it looks like she is doing like a frog jump and stands on her front paws only. i think it is too keep from getting her back feet wet or something. she also does it when she pees n it looks like she is lifting her legs. i think it is took keep them out of the way...|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	ur dog is funny|`|FewhKlx9aa	I had a yorkie that pooped as if he was peeing with his leg lifted,the oddest thing
S8aCj7m7aa	why is it wrong to spend this money to save the life of a friend and companion? we american's waste more money than that on designer clothes and purses. i volunteer at a rescue organization, and a yorkie that we saved helped a crippled 18 month old girl move for the first time, simply by spending time with her and giving her joy...so was the money we spent curing a skin condition ($2,000) wasted on that yorkie or should we have let the shelter put that dog to sleep like they wanted to? if that little girl never met that yorkie, she may have never started moving...the therapists were giving up hope, but that baby wanted to touch that dog. Hmmm, so who's to say what's more important. Each creature on this planet has its right to live...and its own unique purpose here. That dog was put into your life for a reason...not just anyone would be willing to spend that kind of money to heal a dog....why do you think it found its way to your home...one that would spend that type of money....when you find the answer to that question....you will have the answer you need.|`|d9xXIe9waa	I think you already know the answer.|`|QLrk3ep9aa	People are just idiots. Ignore them. There are many places that can help you. Care Credit is a great thing, most larger vet branches offer it. It is like a credit card that can only be used for medical emergencies.<br>  <br>  There are also several rescues that will spend the money. Unfortunatly, most of them require that you sign the dog over to them, and then when it is healed they adopt it out to a new family.<br>  <br>  Try to get insurance on the dog. There are several that are 30$ a month or so, and some will reimburse up to 80% of your medical bills.<br>  <br>  Speak to your local vet about setting up a donation fund. Most people don't want to donate to a private individual in fear of getting scammed, but many will donate directly to the vet. Craigslist is a great way, I live in Colorado and I've seen several cases like this on there. There are also idiots on Craigslist, ignore them. Also, find breed rescues in your area for springer spaniels, and maybe they can help you with a donation fund. If you can come up with the money, do it. <br>  <br>  Who cares how you spend YOUR money! So what if it is on your pet and not someone else's kid. Some people don't like kids, some people don't have kids, and to some people, their pets ARE their kids! Why waste that money donating to a kid who will grow up to be an angry person like the one that emailed you, when you could spend it saving a member of your family? No, you are not crazy. I would spend everything I have to save my dogs.|`|lRrOwswYaa	no dear..i think you are a great owner i m sure you and your dog have a great bond...you ll find mean and useless suggestions from irresponsible people all over...so stop listening to them...its about you and your dog and you dont need to listen to heartless people who probably dont even care...and as you put it i think you have already made your mind up for going ahead with the operation( am i going to far "i dont think so..") :)<br>     about financing the operation...get a second opinion from some other vet and see if you can get it done for a better price.<br>  Here is something i googled up that might hopefully be of some use:<br>  pet and animal welfare society:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pawsct.org/shownews.php?article=1#Financial%20Assistance%20for%20Medical%20Expenses" rel="nofollow">http://www.pawsct.org/shownews.php?artic...</a><br>  <br>  hope it helps...take care ...love him unconditionally cause that is what he would do  :)<br>  best of luck!!|`|PM23RDycaa	Its craigslist what do you expect? The vast majority of people on that site are complete and total a holes. Just let it go, some people are not animal people and other people  don't understand that some people are willing to do anything to help their animal if they can.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	It depends on what will be the outcome from surgery. If the dog will be fine & never have it happen again then yes do it.  But if outcome is questionable & a good chance of it possibly happening again or something else equally serious happening, then probably not.  I hate to see animals put thru a lot of surgeries or procedures if there won't be a good life ahead.  It might be more humane to let dog go & save another dog.  Since I don't have enough info, I can't give you an opinion on what to do other than you have to only think about the dog's quality of life & not let your personal feelings steer you.  Often owners only think about how much they don't want to lose their pet & not what is the most humane thing for their dog.  They don't understand any of it.<br>  <br>  You didn't mention what your dog might have but check out this link for clinical trials being done on AKC breeds & maybe one is being done on your breed & you could get assistance that way.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.akcchf.org/research/grants/search/index.cfm?search=breed" rel="nofollow">http://www.akcchf.org/research/grants/se...</a>|`|3BMBZtDxaa	No, the people were wrong. Most likely they aren't dog owners or they are the type of people who own a dog but think a dog is a dog. You know, the kind that feed cheap food and keep their dog outside without a collar on? <br>  <br>  People don't understand that dogs are part of the family to many owners. There's nothing wrong with you doing this. I mean, it's not like after the operation he'll die or something. This isn't cancer where it may or may not work. This surgery will help him have a better way of life. Putting him to sleep would be cruel compared to fixing him.<br>  <br>  Just continue looking. You may want to talk to the surgeon and see about payment plans. Most likely if you can pay for the x-rays and half the operation, he'll allow you to pay the other half of the operation in segments. But then again, he might not. Maybe you should contact local shelters, animal organizations and other things and see if they could donate even a tiny bit. You may not get much, but it's worth a shot.<br>  <br>  Be diligent and have faith that you can get the money! It'll come around at some point. He is your family and you love him, we get that. Don't listen to what anyone says. He'll pull through.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|71i6IjdZaa	Its not going to far at all love, he is part of your family, I would do anything to make my dogs better aswell, as for the lady who said to 'save a child not a lousy dog' heaps of people donate to kids charities, but not many people donate to save a dog charities.

I honestly don't think the dog is inbreed, nor is that the cause of this:)<br>  xx|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	You are not wrong, what is wrong is someone criticising your for trying to save a pet that you love. Some people don't understand the connection that people have to their pets....it's your money and your right to spend it on what you wish. <br>  That said, have you looked into Care Credit? It's a company that provides loans for vet care at little to no interest. <br>  <a href="http://www.carecredit.com/vetmed/whycc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.carecredit.com/vetmed/whycc.h...</a><br>  <br>  I have to add.....I wonder how much money the jerks that criticized you spend on coffee in the morning, eating out, etc. People don't realize how much money they really waste.....at least this is going to save a life of a beloved companion. I would do the same thing, and have done pretty much the same thing and I don't regret it.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	When you adopted your dog you took on the responsibility to care for it to the absolute best of your ability.  No, you are not going too far.  Everyone is going to have an opinion how you should spend your money.  Only you and your family can make these decisions.  Whether or not you save your dog will have no affect on the sick children of this world.  Best of luck to you and your dog.|`|Kt0qVNZOaa	No you are not being stupid! You are being loving.  I would totally do the same for my dog.  When you get a dog, it soon becomes part of the family and you would be considered heartless if you didn't care!

If I wasn't so poor I would help you. :(|`|dZCsMyjXaa	Keep looking for help; there are programs out there. Just because some people are nasty doesn't mean that your dog is worth any less to you and your family.|`|wGL2A3C8aa	I dog is a persons best friend.

Good luck!|`|8ym4ypABaa	Your dog is your child. Don't listen to those people.<br>  I would try going or calling your local SPCA (they have a lot of good suggestions when it comes to these problems)<br>  Your dog does have a deformity that needs to be fixed..i wouldn't jump to assume it was inbred tho..it could be but it might not. <br>  <br>  If you really can't afford the operation and you can't find any other options...you are going to have to think about the possibility of surrendering the dog to the SPCA or to a family that can afford the bill (i know that seems horrible...but its always best to prepare for the worst)<br>  <br>  I really hope this works out for you..|`|dl1OOOT8aa	Tough question. You are not being stupid though, those people on craig list were immature and just plain nasty. It is a very serious situation that many owners today have to face and what those people said wasn't right. <br>  <br>  I would still do the x-ray. So he can diagnose the dog properly and you can make a decision. If the dog can make a full recovery and there is a high percentage that the dog will be "cured" then I'd say do it. But it could be something serious like rickets or Panosteitis which can debilitating and require lifetime treatment and care.|`|xZOlsByJaa	Don't give up. Go to the specialist. There maybe an answer. Your not being stupid. The people that respond with meanand ridiculous answers are. They have no heart.<br>  <br>  Talk with the vet. Explain your situation. They may reduce the cost. Or vets have payments plans.  Most vets would rather help a dog stay in a good home, than have to have it wind up in a shelter.  Hang in there.
RDsZFfLOaa	yes, mostly all puppys are born with roundworms. they should be dewormed for up to 6 months of age. Sometimes you will notice roundworms in the feces and they look like spagettii, but other parasites you will need to bring a sample to your vet to see if they may have hookworms, whipworms, coccidia, and other parasite. To treat roundworms they need strongid to get rid of them. strongid also takes care of hookworms and whipworms. Tapeworms look like rice and they get them if they recently had fleas. You need drontal to treat them and they are alittle more expensive then strongid. Also you need to get heartworm prevention for your puppy as well i suggest getting INTERCERTOR, because is by some chance they get heartworms with it the company will pay to treat them. <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|0fKQhIX0aa	it depends.  sometimes yes and sometimes no.  you can usually tell by the distinct feces that the animals deficate or a smell.  its best to check with the vet.  sometimes if a worm is in the intestinal tract it sheds eggs and they can only be seen under a microscope.  <br>  <br>  are you seeing something?|`|EcAeLWLFaa	They should be depending on what type. When it comes to a puppy then you should try taking them to the vet. I've used 8 in 1 safe-guard 4 Canine Dewormer that you can get from Petco or Petsmart on my dog but she is already 1. Good luck.|`|CADfxb8waa	Um, when my dog got his shots he pooped them out. Yes, you do see it in the feces. My dog's was like small little worms.In a way they looked like rice. But that was just the type of worm he had -I'm not sure what kind- but I think it depends on the type of worm your dog had/has.<br>  <br>  -hope i helped!|`|4hNRTWtDaa	When you deworm the puppy, you may see dead worms pass.  They are usually long and thin, like spaghetti.  Yes, kind of gross, but don't be too worried.  Just make sure to pick up the poop from your yard and get rid of it.|`|41m6RZ4Jaa	i went to puppy pre-school last night and they discussed worms and yes they are visible. they look like normal white worms, but smaller than human worms(ewwwwww). so good luck|`|9aLNaMP3aa	yes, the ones i've seen are white and thin. but i've heard there's other types|`|bIaywrBCaa	sometimes you will see them pass. Some look like spaghetti. Tapeworms are found around the anus and look like white grains of rice. Tapeworms take a different kind of dewormer.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	yes|`|k0kKaRZ7aa	When they defaecate you should see worms as they are being 'emptied out of their system'. This is normal. After we got our dogs wormed they had worms in their feces for a few days to a week until the worms were gone.<br>  <br>  Usually, if the dog eats dirt/feces, then they can get worms again and if they do do this it is best to boost their fiber/potassium level. Banana's can boost their potassium level but I cannot remember what can boost their fiber intake. Hope this helps!|`|pMUZVP1Oaa	yes, you can see them.  they look like small pieces of spaghetti, for the round worms, which is what you normally see in the poop.  small rice segments or flat pieces, usually seen around the rear in the hair, or very flat segmented pieces are tapeworms, and take a different dewormer.  if any questions as to what you are seeing can be taken to the vet for identification.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Sometimes.  Sometimes, they throw them up too.  Sometimes, you don't really see them, but they're there.  It depends on what kind of worms and how badly they had them.<br>  <br>  The thing I would watch for, not to be gross, but pups will sometimes try to eat their poo or worms they just herked up.  So watch him kinda close for a bit.|`|AA12283580	Yes.

I was feeding Nature's Recipe for a while because I could get it at Petsmart, 20 pounds for $17.99.      I wish all companies would sell 20 pound bags and 30 pound bags.  None of these stupid 15, 17, even pathetic 13 pound bags.  They make the bags look like 20 pound bags but put a measly amount in the bags.    Okay, rant over.|`|9tGy76hpaa	I would go with either Innova or Wellness.  The others are not in the same league.

0Gyrecxxaa	No offense, but whomever told you that a Goffins is not as loud as an Umbrella LIED! I just had to tell you that up front because I'm owned by a Goffins, an Umberlla and a Mollucan. I hope you live in a house and not an apartment, becase if you do you'll be in the street. And I hope talking on the phone, watching tv, or having company isn't all that terribly important to you because those things will stop. And don't forget to name a caregiver for this bird in your Will. You just never know and they live a LONG time. They are also notoriously psychotic birds and they pluck, maime themselves, and turn vicious sometimes without CONSTANT attention and sometimes seemingly for no reason at all.. I'm done preaching, seriously.<br>  <br>    I just hope and pray to God you know what you're getting yourself into. That said, here ya go.<br>  <br>     HANDS DOWN...GO GOFFINS!<br>  <br>       My Goblin, or Gobble Lynn as she refers to herself, is the most exquisite creature imaginable. She isn't the most prolific talker but she has a personality the size of an elephant. Keep in mind I hand fed mine from a day one baby and when you find the right breeder, you need to be in on the hand feeding too in order to bond more closely to this bird early on if the breeder will allow you to participate in some way. Goblin prefers to be carried around, on her back like a baby, in the crook of my arm. She sleeps in my bed, under the cover with her head on the pillow like a child. I get in the shower, she goes. You get the idea. This is the most affectionate creature on the planet. Cockatoo's are the teddy bears of the bird world anyway but in all honesty, if I had to do it all over agian, I wouldn't have had larger Too's. A Goffins is all the personality and affection you're looking for in a compact, less DANGEROUS version of a Cockatoo. A Goffins could take your finger clean off. An Umbrella or a Mollucan can rearrange your face. Spend some time with a baby Goffins...that lil thing will wrap itself around your heart so fast you won't see it coming...guaranteed. I love all of my birds but I'm old, I'm practical, and I've lost many pets in 39 years. But if something happened to my Goblin, wow, I don't even want to think about that.|`|0e887501126bed50bff9795d128b616faa	Goffins are VERY busy birds, way higher energy level than an umbrella. Also, don't let anyone tell you goffins are quieter: they might not be able to attain the volume of an umbrella, but they can be VERY loud, and most of the goffins I have met are much more vocal / chatty than umbrellas. A friend of mine has a goffin that has been rehomed twice because he was so loud. One of the previous owners had the police called to her house several times for noise complaints. The same person who owns him now has a total of 6 goffins.<br>  <br>  I have an umbrella and a citron crested. Trust me, if noise is an issue for you, don't get any cockatoo; quiet toos are the exception and not the rule!  Having said that, I just love goffins; they are very fun little birds. If I was brave enough (or stupid enough) to get another too, it would have to be a female goffins.  <br>  <br>  As far as cuddliness goes, nothing beats an umbrella for hands on lovin', but that can cause a whole other set of problems.|`|yMbw0Osnaa	it all comes down to the time , effort ,respect ,love and attention you give your bird.cockatoos are noisy birds its their nature.if you want a quiet bird then maybe a cockatoo isn't for you.they are great birds though.as with anything you get back what you put in.
00f9873d58a871ae31ecf33313f803caaa	My son has a Newfie that is a marvel with his two small children.  He even pulls them out of the swimming pool when they go in to swim.  The kids find it annoying but their parents and I find it reassuring!|`|Il0QA1Hcaa	You can go to petfinder.com and fill out a survey and it will tell you what breeds would be good for your environment. Personally I have a samoyed and a beagle with 2 boys now ages 15 and 9. When we got the samoyed when my son was 3 she was 6 wks old. All the dogs you listed are great with kids, maybe you can look for an older dog and 1 or 2 so that they are not as hyper.  You can contact a breeder on the internet or again use petfinder.com. They have a classified section for people who can no longer keep there animals. I have always loved Great Danes if you have the room. If you get them as a puppy they are on same plying field as your children, so they will grow up together and learn from each other. They will knock them down, but then the kids will knock him down, it will become a game.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	How about if you go to the local shelter and check out what they have?  The shelter staff can help you choose the right dog for you and your family and if you geto ne that is a year or two old, it will be house broken, crate trained, fixed, and you will have a good idea of what the temperament would be.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	bichon frise|`|9p9DDRSnaa	labs are the best...(i have had great danes mostly, a boxer, min pin, cocker spaniel, rotwieller and a few mixes..)  A lab-retriever mix is a fantastic dog!  dane's are just too big for their own good.. (we had one who accidentally stepped on a kitten- no more kitten), boxer we had slobbered everywhere, cocker spaniel is a little smaller than what you were looking for, but they are very loyal and gentle.  My lab (he's 12) is the most gentle, smart, kind animal I have ever had in my life...and he lets my 1 year old crawl all over him and let's her put hats on him...he also gives her a kiss when we get home.  very good with children...|`|xetVyGOdaa	The only one we trust with our 3 kids (all under 7) is a Bichon Frise. We did a ton of research - see http://www.bestfamilydog.co.uk.|`|J3UOc8Npaa	I understand why you want a large breed because I would like a large breed. Here are some common dogs that I think you would want. But generally small dogs are better with kids. But PLEASE PLEASE train your dog carefully and it does not matter if you think you are being mean to him/her you probally are not. Only warn them by giving them a gentle tap on the nose or if it the dog has done something worse then tell them of verbally and physically if needed.    Irish Water Spaniel (Maybe a little mental on walks and play)  English Pointer ( Rather delicate footing but strong legs)  Flat-Coated Retriever ( Less drool than a Golden Retriever)  English Setter ( Very calm as older dog and brilliant for small children)  Border Collie ( Can be a bit mental and also can knock a kid flying without intending to)  Rough Collie ( A bit like the English Setter but not as calm)  Boxer ( Can be a bit rough and mental but when setteld is calm)  Dalmatian ( Can be a bit clumsy so would be able to trip over a small child)    Hope this helps and if you need any more information about dogs please email me up at francescadaw@yahoo.com Good Luck!|`|oNQeg4xWaa	great pyrenees they are big but very gentle with children.i have one with small children he is great with them very loving and patient,and protective over them.|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	it all depends on how u handle it not the dog in general|`|Ox2ojFCHaa	German Shepard, they are large and powerful, but know how to act around the disabled and small children. Get a puppy and that way you can mold it into the perfect dog. Good Luck!|`|zSOnXtiQaa	I agree with previous answers. Most breeds will do well with the children if trained properly. Time spent with any dog will help them understand what it is you want from them. They will do anything possible to make you happy =)|`|VY4LqfLpaa	we have a golden retriever...he's almost 2 years old.  when we first got him (we had him around kids for about 6 months - till he was about 8-9 months old - b/c of where we lived)...he would always crouch down to go up to kids till the kids understood that he was ok...then he would get up to play with them.  So far he absolutely loves our 7 month old.  And he's always gentle when our son is around.   I know a couple who have 2 great danes and they are really good with their kids as well.  I've never heard of the other breed so I don't really know.    One thing to remember though, is it doesn't really matter what the dog breed is...about 99% of it is how YOU raise the puppy.  We have a chow that loves our son just as much as our golden retriever does.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	Your animal shelter will be the best help. Breed can't determine everything, a mixed dog can be the best for your kids. Dogs at the shelter usually have been evaluated as in terms of personality and behaviour so there is probably a dog there perfect for your family lifestyle as we speak. Good Luck|`|IdSqunZuaa	I think that breed is the Golden Retriever. This breed is known for its compatibility with kids. It is very friendly too. Take a look at this, http://dogtime.com/golden-retriever.html... I learned a lot from that. Hope you also do.|`|ZHWo2du2aa	great dane - far too big.  ridgeback too probably although they are great dogs.  staffies are the greatest with kids - and golden retrievers / labs are too.  also, boxers are great with them.  infact to be honest, MOST dogs are if trained PROPERLY however you should still always ensure you supervise them.  the one great thing about staffies are that they can tolerate a huge amount of annoying pain inflicted by kids, and are very very unlikely to ever react. labs / golden retrievers will alot sooner if for example they're having their tale pulled etc. thats a fact.  i have a south african boerboel who is amazing with kids, but again  -  being not quite as tall as a dane, but MUCH more heavily built - an excitable 6 month old pup of one of this breed unintentionally knocking over a toddler, well...... they're gonna fly!!|`|jOTKKREMaa	It's great to see you're considering your lifestyle. You should be VERY CAREFUL about selecting a dog when you have small children in the household. Here are two excellent articles to help you decide...    http://www.doglirious.com/best-dogs-for-...  http://www.doglirious.com/best-dog-breed...|`|AA11171343	Labrador and golden retrievers are excellent choices as they have very stable temprements.    If you want something for protective purposes I would recommend a staffordshire bull terrier, contrary to belief they are excellent with children.    Bull mastives are great with kids and big in size so good for family protection, very loyal and mild in temprement.    They are also known as Nanny dogs because of this, if you google nanny dogs you will see for yourself.    Ridgeback i  wouldnt recommend as they can be over powering and tempremental.    Great dane to be honest I dont know what would be like with kids but I believe they are mild in nature.    Avoid dalamtions as they are very boystress with kids and can be difficult to train and altho i love jackrussels to bits and have one myself who has been great with my daughter [my daughter was 2 yrs when we had the dog] and they are inseperable i have known many unpredictable jack russells.

Treated water (although we cant smell it) produces a chemical scent that offends a cats sense of smell. Thus, puddles outside...or in your case, condensation on the outside of the toilet seems more attractive to cats because its natural and doesnt produce chemical smells. Try setting out another bowl with tap water for the cat, perhaps in a place where the dog cant get to it, after letting it set for a few hours. Letting it set will allow some of the chemicals to evaporate, producing a better chance of your cat accepting it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	Cats are just weird like that sometimes.  I have a friend who has a cat who will only drink from a running faucet.  They have preferences as to where they get their water, and it's hard to change their habits.  They just like it that way.  Guess you just need to keep the toilet lid closed.  ;)|`|17v06tO7aa	both my cats do it. and i change their water bowl 2 a day and they still do. i think it is because its colder water and its more fresh i guess...i dont know. my mom has this water fountain in between her plants at her house and they LOVE that thing.. try getting one of those!|`|9G03aQhsaa	Cats love to drink  cool moving water since it seems "fresher" to them.  That's why they are drinking from the toilet and licking the condensation from the side of it and drinking from the tub too.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Really the only way to stop this behavior would be to make it seem less appealing.  Try spraying the side of the toilet and the tub with lemon if the behavior really bother's you, its safe, but cats hate the taste and smell, and then be sure to keep the lid down.  Honestly though, there will be times when someone forgets to close the lid and she'll try drinking from there anyway, so don't use any tidybowl type stuff.  Keep the bathroom door closed too.|`|fKYi3IJ2aa	Its not weird at all 2 of my cats use to do that all the time and they would still be doing it if I didnt shut the bathroom door. My reason behind it is because its colder water than what in their bowl and probably more refreshing. Try changing the water in its bowl more often and maybe add an ice cube or two if this habit really bothers you|`|Zirwfsg4aa	My cat likes to play in the toilet water, and he loves watching it flush...then he splashes around in it and licks his paws.  So your cat is not really weird. Just make sure that you don't have bleach or anything in the toilet.  We shut the door to our bathrooms for a while and he seems to have gotten over it mostly, or he waits until we're not home.  Try shutting the door for a while without making a big deal out of it in front of the cat and see what happens.|`|T0Plec3Aaa	I know it sounds gross but it's not harmful to them - it probably is because the dog drinks form her bowl - you could put out a couple of alternative water sources for her. But as I said it's not harmful.|`|LGrjW4ijaa	The dog drinking from her water bowl doesn't have anything to do with it. I have 4 dogs & 3 cats and they all drink out of the same bowl. Just keep the lid down on the toilet that is what I have to do.|`|KLMo9jbzaa	Close the bathroom door.

mFa5ZDtcaa	Why do you want to do that? Your cat looks to you for affection and companionship. To cut them off from that in their own home is a little cruel. They sit around all day waiting for you to come home and when you do, you exclude them from the affection, contact and approval they crave. If you do that, cats can develop behavioral problems. They are smarter and more feeling than some people realize.    Waking up in the morning with a little pair of green eyes looking at you can be a relaxing way to start the day. My little calico can hear the click if I wake up and turn off my alarm before it goes off. She will be on me within 15 seconds of the "click".|`|5919d59a9a07aac4e14c50ba4d7d46b9aa	try using a child proof gate or when you catch the cat going into that room spray him with a water bottle
AQsiugSpaa	Hi Badassbowtie!    I am confused here. Weren'y you aware of the cat's propensity to climb before you invited one to share your home and heart?    Cats and climbing are synonymous.Just like ham and eggs, Romeo and Julliet go together, so are cats and climbing. Cats are attracted to places higher than the floor because they are predatory animals and need to check out their environment. It is instinctual!    That being said, have you provided alternatives for him that he can claim as his own?  Have you given him a tall cat tree upon which to climb and hang out in the shelves and tunnels which most of them include?  Does he have a "safe" retreat high place that is exclusively his? Cats need a stimulating environment, with toys and  lots of attention as they get bored easily since they are highly intelligent animals. The more bored they get, they either withdraw emotionally, or get into mischief.    My cats enjoy hanging out on top of our very high refrigerator so they are able to keep abreast of all happenings in the house. They love to walk on the back of our headboard on our bed.  In our household there are very few "forbidden" places and they are doing fine. But we knew about how cats are climbers before we brought them into our home.    You can redirect your kitty's behavior though, by supplying him with alternatives, and when he is on "forbidden" spots, gently remove him and place him on a higher level that is ok for him. He will "get it" eventually.     The problem with using a spray bottle is that you must catch him in the act. When you are not around he will more than likely resume his passion for your furniture, and only stay away when you are home. So having his own places will be far more attractive to him as he learns his boundaries.    Hope this helps and that you will get him the objects that he needs which will prevent you getting annoyed at him. He is only being a cat, afterall.

And I guess it makes them feel superior to their surrondings.    Use a water bottle whenever she jumps up onto a ledge, but be sure to spray her just as soon as she does it. Because cats have such a  short memory, they easily forget things they had done moments ago. So if you don't spray her fast enough she won't realize why she is being sprayed. Resulting in one confused feline.|`|J6kMNre7aa	Cats will be cats.    Try a scat mat, it sends a pulse that animals don't like   when they jump on your i.e furniture.     You can get it on http://www.jefferspet.com.    The reason  your cat(s) jump on the couch is because it's in the   feline nature to jump up on things to be high and away  from the ground, like, for instance to get away from a dog  if you have one.. Cats are very independent, they sometimes  just want to be in a high place where they can be alone.    I hope this helps :)    Christina|`|bj1fT8ctaa	In addition to using a squirt bottle like mentioned above, you can also try putting double-sided tape down wherever he shouldn't be.  Cat's don't like they way it feels, so they'll try to stay off of it (and hopefully learn to associate it with places they don't want to be).|`|Amkmles0aa	you can not get the cat out of the cat that's just that's cats do|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	Because, cats are instinctually  predators.  And most predators prefer to hunt/stalk from high ground.|`|bLnvyyP8aa	its just their natural instincts of jumping on their prey (like mice) which are very agile, so cats jump on everything|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Cats seek high places.  And they are notorious for doing the opposite of what you would like them to do so pretend you don't care!|`|gU34xa9vaa	You say 'my furniture, my windows' etc but you know, since you gave him a home, they are his too ! Cats just love to be up heights. Can you imagine how big we loom to those little creatures on the floor ? They jump up on things to be nearer to us, it's an honour,so I'd just let your cat be a cat. If he jumps on something he shouldn't, just lift him gently down and distract him with a toy.You could always buy or make him one of those cat tower playthings, with platforms and scratching posts, he'd love that !

Pee turns into ammonia, that will only intensify the smell.   Go to this site www.planeturine.com and buy their product.

It is available at home depot|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Pro cleaners or replace the carpet.  If you decide to replace, have them treat what ever you have under the carpet before putting the new rug down.

I have used that on many things and it has worked wonders.  You can even use the Nature's Miracle in that, it will deep clean the carpet.  That is that I would do.  If nothing else works, I would tear that rug up and get a new one before the smell gets worse.  Also, next time you foster a dog, use a crate!|`|4hNRTWtDaa	Ammonia will only make it worse.  At this point you may need to have the carpet replaced, as it may have soaked deep into the floor below.

You do need to get the rug doctor and take a day to clean all your carpet. It works sooo good and it got all my smell out. You have to do it right though and it will take you all day because  you must take your time so it cleans your carpet the way it should. I spent my money and got a Hoover Steamvac Silver for $150 and instead of buying the expensive liquid I fill it up with water and add detergent and it cleans out all my pee. So amazing!|`|TRfF23afaa	Hi,<br>  I assume your carpet is wall to wall, and it sounds like the urine has saturated the carpet pad underneath.I have owned dogs for over 30 years and have learned the hard way.<br>  Unfortunately, the more different chemicals you use, the less effective you make them. The only thing that has ever worked for me is plotting to bring up the urine (and I am talking about a whole roll of white paper towels, changed every hour, with weights like books put on them) and then saturate ewith natures miracle. They do make it to dilute and clean whole carpets, it's expensive, and the bad news is, now that you have used to many products the first treatments will only remove the product, not the urine. Eventually you should be able to improve on the situation if you work at it constantly. Also let the mad underneath have time to dry out before you keep soaking it. That could take days to up to a week, depending on the humidity.<br>  Good luck!<br>  PS. male dogs will "mark' an area with urine.
4aAhEK9daa	Both breeds are very sweet.  Very laid back.  Very affectionate.  Quite playful.<br>  <br>  If you get the kittens from a REPUTABLE breeder then the kittens will stay with the mother cat till they're at least ten weeks old and will already be litter trained.  DO NOT buy a cat from a breeder willing to sell them earlier than that.<br>  <br>  The Ragdoll requires minimal grooming.  You only need to run a comb through their coat about once a week - their coats are virtually mat free.  They don't have the heavy undercoat like a Persian does.<br>  <br>  The Persian needs to be COMBED - not brushed - at least EVERY OTHER DAY ALL YEAR LONG.  Miss a day or two and the fur will mat.  And once the coat mats it's very painful for the cat to comb them out.  Don't get a Persian if your solution to this would be to shave it down like some lazy pet owners do.  A cat's fur insulates it from both heat and cold so it's very cruel to shave them.<br>  <br>  A pet-quality Ragdoll will cost you at least $500 from a REPUTABLE breeder.  A Persian will cost you $600-$700 for pet quality.  Breeders sometimes have cats that are "retired breeders" that they sell for only a couple hundred dollars.  <br>  <br>  Note I keep stressing REPUTABLE.  There's LOTS of bad backyard breeders out there.  The Persian is a breed that is genetically predisposed to PKD - Polycystic Kidney Disease.  Good breeders test their cats and never breed PKD positive cats so they can breed this disease out of their cats.  Bad breeders DON'T test their animals and then end up breed PKD positive cats which of course results in PKD positive kittens.  Buy one of these kittens and you could end up with a cat in renal failure as early as 4 years old.<br>  <br>  Why don't you check a shelter first before going to breeders?  Both breeds can end up at shelters.  In fact, because they're so high maintenance the Persian is one of the most surrendered breeds of cats.  Ragdolls not nearly quite as often, but it can happen.  Pick an adult cat over a kitten.  With kittens you never know what their personality will be like while with adult cats it's right there before you.  I have a Persian I adopted when he was 2 1/2 and he's one of the sweetest, most loving and most playful cats I've ever know!<br>  <br>  You also might find that a cat there catches your eye that's neither breed.  Maybe it's just be a tabby of no particular breed or a domestic longhair.  Just go check out what's available and see which cat most responds to you.  The sex of the cat has nothing to do with personality, by the way.  It has to do with the particular cat.<br>  <br>  Also note that whichever cat you choose - please keep it indoors.  It's not safe to allow any cat to free roam but especially so breeds like the Ragdoll and Persian.  They're very sweet, very trusting and they would fall easy prey to a dog or wild animal or simply be stolen by someone.|`|LxBwmRTlaa	Persian Cats are affectionate and tranquil. They need extra grooming car because of their long hair. There are different types of Persian Cats, such as: By-Color Pesian, Shaded Persian, Smoke Persian, Solid Persian, Tabby Persian, Doll Face Persian, and MIniature Persian. <br>  <br>  You can find more information on Persians on this website:<br>  <a href="http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/persian.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/pe...</a><br>  <br>  Ragdoll Cats are very affectionate and docile.They love being around people. They need to be groomed as well but not as much as the persian Cats. The colors on the Ragdolls can be: Seal Point, Blue Point,  Chocolate Point, Lilac Point in bi or party color, Red Point, and cream point.<br>  <br>  About training your cat it just depends on the cat itself.<br>  <br>  <br>  You find alot of information about Ragdolls on this website:<br>  <a href="http://www.ragdoll-cats.com/descrip.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ragdoll-cats.com/descrip.htm</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I would suggest you get a Ragdoll.|`|SRzL2Wexaa	In my experience, I don't think it matters.  I think what does matter is how you treat the cat, as to how it reacts to strangers and you.  I've only adopted cats from misc. Humane Societies, and all have been very loveable, and friendly, other than one that was skittish when kids were around. It was probably beaten on by kids before we got it.  I've noticed most of the time the male cats are more loveable and relaxed.|`|3IXDx9nhaa	You should adopt one.  There are so many little kittens who need good homes.  Go to the RSPCA site in your state.  In QLD alone there are 8 pages of gorgeous kittens of all sorts.  Check it out please.|`|uSjy6vgnaa	I think my Manx is the best breed going.|`|fKYi3IJ2aa	I"m not familiar with a ragdoll cat but I've had a few persian and they are great cats. They are very mellow and calm. The only bad thing is is they require a lot of attention when it comes to their hair. If you dont brush it it'll get knots and when that happends the cat has to be shaved. Persian are also great with kids and other family members.|`|nd30LQhlaa	I think that you might like a persain...there friendly and lazy/and playful at the same time..and I think both cats are the same as far as training...<br>  <br>  the only down side to a persian is that they can ring up a huge vet bill due to there closed noses...they do tind to weezz and you have to clean there dischargy eyes....<br>  But my moms breeds them and I love all their differnt personalitys =] <br>  goos luck in picking the cat you want!|`|741ae50bbc3a424e88ff8d0a0bc91407aa	Between the two you are considering, I'd go with the Ragdoll. They are more family oriented and a very hearty breed. A persian has a smaller snout and will start having some breathing complications along with eye problems. A Ragdoll kitty is so laid back and fun!|`|pT0SFrlFaa	both are really good breeds. very friendly. persians are highly recommended to be inside only. i have heard thay ragdolls are vocal. And when you say train you just mean to use the litterbox right because thats about as much as any one cat train any cat.|`|PXIoiNSvaa	Check out the Cats 101 series on the Discovery Channel.

Normally they are more laid back, and affectionate but don't need attention. Their bulky body structure causes them to not want to really jump up on things like other cats. <br>  <br>  The bad part is their coat needs constant grooming. An upside to that is there is a short hair version of this breed called exotics.  Extreme face Persians ( the ones that look like they ran into a door) tend to tear really bad, but the semi/doll face don't tear hardly at all. <br>  <br>  I bought a Persian kitten recently from a breeder out in Tennessee, and I got such a great kitten, I would have paid 3 times the amount she asked for him. She cleans them regularly, socializes them with other cats, takes special care of them, makes sure they are litter box trained, scratching post trained, and she posts daily pictures of them on Flikr.com from the moment they are born. If you're not in the area and weather permits, she will even ship the kitten to you. Best of all she is there for the life of your kitten to offer any answers to questions you might have through your kittens life.|`|cvtYbKXXaa	I googled ragdoll cats and found the following:<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  What type of personality does a Ragdoll cat have?<br>  <br>  When many people think of cats, they often characterize them as being highly independent in nature, and not very social.<br>  <br>  The ragdoll cat does not fit this description at all, and is not your typical cat breed!<br>  <br>  They usually have a very calm and easygoing personality. The agreeable ragdoll makes a great companion for someone looking to have a pet that is gentle, adaptable, and mellow. It is a very social creature, often following their owners around, enjoying the company that their owner has to offer.<br>  How large can a Ragdoll cat get?<br>  <br>  The ragdoll is listed with guinness records as the largest cat, with adult males ranging 12-20 pounds, and females averaging 10-15 pounds. They usually mature slowly into adulthood, taking sometimes a few years to reach full size and for the color markings to be complete.<br>  Should the Ragdoll cat be kept indoors at all times?<br>  <br>  We recommend that if you decide to get a ragdoll, that it should be an indoor pet. Ragdolls by nature, do not have the aggressive instincts to fight other animals, or the natural ability to defend themselves as well as other cat breeds. <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  <br>  It also mentioned that they get their name from the fact that they go limp like a ragdoll when you pick them up.  They seem to be medium long to long hair so will require brushing daily just as a Persian will.  If you want a more independent cat, choose the Persian.  The ragdoll will need a lot of attention in the form of petting and talking to it.  One of my cats is part maine coon.  He is very large (19 pounds), long haired - but not super long, needs brushing every day, and makes it a point to lay on the remote control when I am watching television.  Although he doesn't require my undivided attention all the time, when he wants it he will have it, period.  There are so many breeds out there, I would do more research if I was making the choice.  Do you want a vocal cat?  Siamese and Abyssinians talk a lot.  Do you want a long hair?  Himalayans are beautiful too.  Do you want a cat that will get along with children? That would certainly be the ragdoll.  Do  you want a large cat?  A lap cat? One that doesn't want to be bothered with silly human affection all the time?  What do you mean by "train"?  If you want it litter trained before you take it home, make sure it is 8 weeks old, not 6 !  If you want it to do tricks, get a dog.  The perfect cat is out there, but you must know what will fit your lifestyle.  And there is still no guarantee.  Cats, like people, have individual personalities.  Good luck in your search and I hope the right cat finds YOU!|`|RN1wGlWWaa	In general, most cats are people friendly (if you get them from a reputable breeder, they will be socialized properly and the breeder keeps them for 3-4 months before rehoming them)  Males tend to be more laid back and outgoing to strangers and other pets.<br>  <br>  Persians:<br>  Pros - pretty to look at, quiet cats, not hyperactive in playing<br>  Cons - DAILY combing to keep mats from forming.  This is a must and the cat has to be trained from a kitten to accept grooming.<br>  <br>  Ragdolls:<br>  Pros - more active then Persians, more people oriented and very littel matting of the coat.<br>  Cons - needs to be combed 2-3 times a week.<br>  <br>  Persians - males average about 11/12 lbs, females about 8-9 lbs.<br>  Ragdolls - males average 18 lbs, females about 13/14 lbs.
44gTtORXaa	It'll usually take 1.5-2 years before they can breed. You can "power feed" them, and this will cause them to gain faster.  Basically you just feed them about double the suggested amounts. You'll want to stop power feeding once it becomes an adult though, otherwise it'll become obese and develop health problems.|`|PIwP8DFxaa	There are two indicators of sexual maturity for a female<br>  1. 1000 grams in weight<br>  2.

fypgDK53aa	A sexually intact male will mount anything, both in dominance and for sexual reasons - regardless if your other bun is male or female. If your new bunny is a juvenile, he also doesn't smell "male" to your resident bunny, so he automatically assumes "female".     While bonding two male bunnies can be tough, it's not impossible. That being said, keep in mind that some buns have really great memories, and one fight can cause them to never really bond with the bun that they fought with.     Be cautious about them being together if your older male is being aggressive - bunny fights can turn quite viscious.     The best course of action is to have both buns neutered. Many people don't like this suggestion, but I have found it really helps stop hormonal behaviours like mounting, aggression, territory marking. It makes it a little easier to litter train your bun, and you will have less chance of the boys fighting.    Some great rabbit resouces:    www.rabbit.org  www.ontariorabbits.org  http://homepage.mac.com/mattocks/morfz/r...    You'll find a lot of info on rabbit behaviour on these sites.|`|woYQ7cp6aa	this is most likely because he's telling him who is boss, or is a little confused. Either way, it is probably best for them to be separated, at least until your older rabbit comes back to his right mind.|`|YpEswTQdaa	Its done in Dominance.    The Older bunny is telling him,he's boss. If the grunting noise is a Soft,almost purring noise its a courtship behavioral,sound,if its harsh & sharp,he isn't a happy bunny. The new Rabbit may still smell a little like his mum--a female.Some Rabbits will hump anything,even footballs,which isn't done in dominance. He will carry on doing this,plus the young bunny may catch on when older. If you neuter them,it will stop this behavior.    Hope this helps,xxx|`|LcHg1UqJaa	well i don't really know i suggest this web site         http://www.fuzzy-rabbit.com/behaviourfaq...|`|ti3AEcIFaa	spank him|`|qsjGiaW2aa	He might just be so excited to have a new rabbit around.

Or maybe hes gay?|`|kSCS1lR0aa	he is really just trying to show him who is boss and he was here first!|`|AA10496780	They should be separated. The old rabbit will force his maturity and age and become dominant and agressive over the baby/new bunny since he was there first.  They are not nice when it comes to their territory.  The mounting is a natural thing that happens with rabbits and other animals if they are not neuterd. The baby still may have his mother's scent on him. Move them now before the new one gets hurt or worse. I am not kidding. I had twin dwarf rabbits and one grew faster than the other and "took over" their cage.  It progressively got worse and me not knowing what to expect or what was really happening, found the smaller one dead after work one day.|`|5919d59a9a07aac4e14c50ba4d7d46b9aa	sounds like a horny rabbit to me|`|HoClTGcQaa	This rabbit is gay.  No doubt about it.  You don't think only humans can be gay do you?  NO.  Obvious homo-bunny.|`|VlP7ESH1aa	it doesnt mean that ur old bunny is gay. it jst means that he is a little bit confused. scare your older bunny, show him that what he is doing is not ok. give your new bunny a bath-- it takes away alot of sexual attraction.|`|ZOakpNy7aa	Its Normal rabbits have a over active sex drive I used to raise rabbits and my male stud would mount and hump a soda can if you put it in his cage, And I dont need to say why his food was tossed into his cage after the first time I put my hand in there to get his dish.lol Anyway your other rabbit will put a stop to it when its had enough. Do watch to make sure the aggresive one is not biting I had to keep my little horndog separate,. have fun they can give you hours of entertainment.
bepZupAfaa	i have this particular cage but don't use it . i found that it was hard to clean and if you don't get the doors close just right your ferret can get out. especially if they ping and pong on the wires to  get your attention. one of my females realized that if she did it long enough she could get the door open. Smart huh!    i now have a midwest ferret nation 2 story cage. you can go to petsmart.com under small animal cages to see what it looks like.  it has extra wide doors making it easy to clean.  it is a little on the expensive side but in the long run well worth the price.     i house 5 ferrets in mine and they have lots of room to stretch out in it.    hope this helps and good luck when you get your ferret|`|F3LBgfvwaa	I actually have that cage. It's not a bad cage overall. I took out the slide and the tube because the ferrets didn't like them much. I bought some hardware cloth from Home Depot to make some ramps for the cage. The best thing about this one is you can rearrange the shelves. I put two together to make a complete level, and they get into it through the holes. Over that I put one shelf, half a floor, next to their hammock. You can also make floors out of linoleum if you don't like the shelves already in the cage. I'll give you a link to instructions how to do that. You can do what you want with them and ferrets love when their cage gets changed.    Oh and remember to let their out of their cage, at least four hours a day, more if possible. They are not happy being stuck in a cage all day!|`|GTmkQzCgaa	The Ferret Nation Model 141:  http://www.ferret.com/item/ferret-nation...    the people of the ferret.com forums seem to love that cage, and say their fuzzies do too. You can get the add-on if you want. It's perfect for one or 2 ferrets, and it's very good quality.|`|djjVYhWiaa	I wouldn't really suggest using a cage like that because ferrets need a lot more space to move about in.  I would suggest either buying a huge bin cage (google image it, it'll bring up loads of pictures), or buying him something similar to a rabbit hutch, but for indoors.  Ferrets grow to be quite large and they need enough room to stretch out and be able to play and run.  Consider getting your ferret a big run with a large cage (bin or hutch are my recommendations).  Good luck!|`|jyGTlpzTaa	It is far too small. A ferret cage should be at least three (feet) long by two wide, and as tall as possible...at least two or three levels are necessary. That would be a prison for your ferret. Its barely long enough for rats!

Apisf1gAaa	I wish I had a more profound answer for you, but the reason they do things together are because they're friends.  You have a fairly decent colony, and just like humans they're bound to find other hermies they prefer than the others.  They probably bonded over their similar tastes in shells, and it evolved from there.  It's best to think of hermit crabs in human terms sometimes, because it's usually the best way to explain their behavior.  They're a lot more human-like then we give the little guys credit for.|`|xKgcqyeDaa	Do you have sand twice as deep as your largest hermit crab? Is is moist enough that you can make a hole in the sand without it collapsing? Do you provide both salt and fresh water, and food without preservatives? What's your temperature and humidity like?<br>  If all your conditions are correct, then just let the hermit crabs go about their business. They'll molt when they need to.|`|3PEQAUT9aa	Well, usually, they are trying to find the best fit shell for them. It does take awhile so be patient. I know, they look gross! lol.<br>  <br>  It took my crab about a year to molt.. but I noticed it didn't molt, it died..<br>  <br>  Haha.
AA10412922	A three year old is too young to understand they need to respect a dog,it's best to wait afew years|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Its actual the Opposite, larger dogs are better with very small children.<br>  The reason being is small breeds are incrediable fragile and can be easily be killed by being dropped on the patio or seriously injured. Also small breeds in young children eyes look like soft toys-so they don't realise there a living breathing animal and small children will often play roughly with a small breed dog. Small dogs were bred for Adult companionship, Large breeds such as Labrador Retriver, Golden Retriver, Scotch Collie and Newfoundland were bred to be family and children dogs-they are specially breed to be tolerant of kids doing typcial thing such as pulling ears, pulling tails and poking etc. Small dogs DO NOT tolerate this, they will bite and snap in return! Also larger breeds are larger and small children are generally more cautious around these dogs.<br>  <br>   If you buy a dog over the Internet, at a pet store or through a newspaper ad, your new pooch may very well be from a puppy mill—a mass dog breeding operation. Protect yourself from scams and don't be fooled into buying an overpriced, possibly sick puppy. <br>  <br>  If a puppy does not teeth on your possesions, it will teeth on you and your children. Rescuers often get calls from panicked parents sure their dog is about to seriously injure their children.  It usually turns out the puppy is just doing what puppies do, i.e., mouth or nip. Parents, too emotional to see the difference, just want to get rid of the dog.  A growing puppy is going to put anything and everything in their mouth. It must be taught bite inhibition. As the puppy grows, the puppy's jaws become stronger and its teeth are replaced by its adult teeth.  The mouthing and nipping it did as a puppy now can have serious consequences.  Far better to get an adult dog 2years+  that has "been there, done that, moved on." <br>  <br>  chihuahua<br>  Chihuahuas are NOT suited to children, no matter how well-meaning the child. Children cannot help being clumsy, and that a child meant well is little solace to a Chihuahua who has been accidentally stepped on, sat on, rolled on, squeezed, or dropped onto the patio. Most Chihuahuas feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making -- and stress and fearfulness (even defensive biting) may be the result.<a href="http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews/chihuahuas.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews...</a><br>  <br>  border colle<br>  Temperament:  This breed is intelligent, responsive, and devoted to their master and work. The Border Collie is extremely sensitive and thrives on human interaction. They are not recommended for the novice, sedentary or apathetic dog owner or for a home with a two-career family. They do not do well if left alone for extended periods of time and will suffer separation anxiety or become destructive. Border Collies do best in a home with older considerate children. They typically get along with dogs they have been raised with but should not be in a home with cats or other small household pets. This breeds inherent work ethic will lead them to attempt to herd anything and everything that moves.<br>  <br>  American and English Cocker spaniel are no longer recomend for small children as they are inclinde to be snappish with children under 13years.<br>  <br>   dachsund<br>  If you have small children, I do not recommend a Dachshund. First, children cannot help being clumsy, and that a child meant well is little solace to a Dachshund puppy who has been accidentally stepped on, sat on, rolled on, squeezed, or dropped onto the patio. The Dachshund's long back is especially fragile and prone to damage when he is picked up incorrectly or dropped. Second, even Dachshund adults may feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making -- and stress and shyness may be the result. Finally, some Dachshunds simply do not tolerate any nonsense from children and will bite if pushed too far.<a href="http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews/dachshunds.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews...</a><br>  <br>  Jack Russell<br>  Temperament:  The Jack Russell Terrier is a loving and devoted breed. They are spirited, lively, amusing, and energetic. They get along with older, well-behaved, considerate children. They are not recommended for children under eight years of age. They do not get along with other pets. Their natural hunting instinct brings out their aggressive nature. They are highly intelligent and bold. Their courage often leads them into dangerous situations that may lead to fatal results. The Jack Russell Terrier requires an extraordinary amount of human attention. They are not well suited for a two career family.<br>  <br>  Pugs are good with older considerate children-as the eyes of the pugs are incrediable fragile and a poke in their eye can easily completely remove the eye, making the dog blind and is a blind dog good with children?<br>  Pug-There fragile eyes can easily be poked out-and is a blind dog good with children? -Puppies & adults may be injured by boisterous children.<br>  Small children and pugs are not a good combination. While pugs are not generally aggressive dogs, young children tend to be fascinated with their curly tails and bulging eyes. Pugs eyes are very sensitive and easily injured, and having their tails pulled can make even the most easy-going pug snap at the person who is doing the pulling. From Frank the Pug-site is down at the moment!<br>  <br>  <br>  Beagle<br>  BEAGLES-Lots of incorrect info in BOTH books & Internet but here the shocking truth! Beagles are HIGHLY energetic BREED, who being a scent hound, shouldn't be let off- lead as THIS BREED would just follow scent-trails. They love to dig, bark and howl, they are stubburn and difficult to train, but do require intensive training! <br>  a very common breed to be surrendered at shelters, so please research this breed before you decide to adopt. They require very tolerant owners! Not suitable with small animals. The Beagle is an all around happy dog that makes a wonderful companion. They are genally excellent with children and other dogs, however they REQUIRE 4km daily walks!<br>  <br>  Scotch Collie-EXCELLENT WITH CHILDREN UNDER 8YEARS OLD AND NOT AS HYPER AS YOUR LEAD TO BELIEVE <br>  Temperament:  The Collie has a very even and well-mannered temperament. This dog is regularly seen in homes with other animals and children, as they are very gentle and passive. Originally bred for herding, this dog has the tendency to nip at ankles as a pup, however most grow out of this stage. Willing to learn and very loyal, this dog will surely provide you with a lot of love.<br>  <br>  Golden Retriver-EXCELLENT WITH CHILDREN UNDER 8YEARS OLD AND NOT AS HYPER AS YOUR LEAD TO BELIEVE <br>  Temperament:  Golden Retrievers are loveable, polite, and highly intelligent. They exude charm and confidence. They are sweet, eager to please, and devoted family companions. They do not do well if left alone for extended periods of time or they will become mischievous and destructive. They have a tendency to be overly exuberant and distractible. They are always gentle and patient with children. They are friendly with other pets. In fact, they are friendly with everyone. They tend to bark as a form of greeting. The Golden Retriever is not well suited for a two career family as they require an inordinate amount of human interaction and companionship.<br>  <br>  Labrador-EXCELLENT WITH CHILDREN UNDER 8YEARS OLD AND NOT AS HYPER AS YOUR LEAD TO BELIEVE <br>  Temperament:  This breed is highly intelligent, loyal, and deeply devoted. The Labrador Retriever is reliable, affectionate, and thrive on human companionship and attention. They are absolutely wonderful with children and get along exceedingly well with other dogs. They may be reserved with strangers and make good watchdogs. If this breed is left alone for extended periods of time without attention or stimulation they will become lonely, bored, and destructive.<br>  <br>  Newfoundland-EXCELLENT WITH CHILDREN UNDER 8YEARS OLD AND NOT AS HYPER AS YOUR LEAD TO BELIEVE <br>  Temperament:  The Newfoundland is generous with love and affection. They are very sociable and friendly to visitors they know. They have a keen sense of responsibility and are excellent with children. They become so attached to their families that they cannot ever adapt to a new home or environment. They are generally good with other pets. This breed thrives on human companionship. They are gentle, heroic, and docile. Newfoundlands are extremely protective and will place themselves between their family and any danger that appears to be of a threatening nature. Actual they can and WILL adapt to NEW homes!<br>  <br>  Whippet<br>  Temperament:  Amiable, docile, yet high energy, the Whippet makes a wonderful child's companion providing the child knows how to handle a dog. Rather independent, this breed is also a quick learner but does require consistent training methods and variety as they bore quickly. The Whippet is a very sensitive breed and should never be roughly handled, as shyness is a factor.<br>  <br>  Bichon Frise<br>  Bichon Frise puppies are NOT suited to small children, no matter how well-meaning the child. Children cannot help being clumsy, and that a child meant well is little solace to a Bichon Frise puppy who has been accidentally stepped on, sat on, rolled on, squeezed, or dropped onto the patio. Even Bichon Frise adults may feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making -- and stress and shyness (even defensive biting) may be the result.<a href="http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews/bichonfrise.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews...</a> <br>  <br>  Boston Terrier<br>  Temperament:  Highly intelligent, alert, and enthusiastic, the Boston Terrier is affectionate and loyal. This breed is quite animated and has a lovely sense of humor. They thrive on human interaction and on being an integral part of the family. They do best in a home with children over the age of eight years and are exceedingly good with the elderly. They will generally get along with non-canine pets, although males may fight with other dogs.

They don't have any idea that its an animal that breathes, feels pain and emotions. A small dog that your child can pick up and carry is a total NO NO, what if your sister drops it on a staircase or onto something hard and injures the poor animal? Dogs of a small size your child can rival in strength with and can really harm them, you want ones that can take the beating of a rough housing three year old and still keep its cool. Chiuhuahua's? Absoloutely not.<br>  <br>  From this conclusion, Old Yeller fans may think "Why not a Golden Retriever? From the movies they seem like great dogs and excellent companions!". This is also a no. While the media depicts Goldens as loveable, caring, nobel, and gentle tag alongs, what most people DON'T realize is that the first two years of raising Goldens are a complete nightmare. Thousands of Goldens are returned every year because people did not realize how obnoxious and immature they were through their puppy years and were not the dogs they thought they were. Goldens are way to rough for a three year old, and just like your sister, a golden puppy will not realize that that is a breathing thing that he or she is plowing over when playing.<br>  <br>  I would say a Collie or a Saint Bernard, maybe even a Husky or a Basset Hound.

wqazD9quaa	I have a 1 1/2 old male and I am just in love! I think I might have gotten lucky, as he is a somewhat calm terrier and was very easy to house break (contrary to most reports). While I love my little man, I would recommend getting a female (because of territory/aggression issues).  You wouldn't want your older dog to be hurt, or your new tiny baby :) Either way, the decision is yours... but a good tip on potty training that helped me was to take them outside right after they:  1. Eat  2. Wake up from a nap  3. Play a lot  And when you take your dog to the door, use a catch phrase each time that will help them remember the routine. (Paxton automatically runs for the door if he hears "You wanna go outside?!") I believe it took me two weeks to get him trained. Now he simply runs to the back door if he needs to do his business. Hopefully these little tips will help you in training your dog, whichever gender you choose! Good Luck!|`|vFgioY0iaa	i think you should get a girl|`|C1eHfhrHaa	If you already have a male, then get a female.|`|F27az9NEaa	It typically doesn't matter the gender of the dog, as long as it is spayed/neutered at the proper age (which some do it as young as 8 weeks, but the general age is 6 months)    Yorkshire Terriers generally have a big ego, so you'll want to watch him/her around larger dogs.    Other than that, just be sure to do your homework on the breed to be sure it suits you.  Also, don't let anyone fool you-there is NO such thing as a "teacup", "mini", "micro" Yorkie. The Yorkshire Terrier is a toy breed of dog and comes in one size. If anyone tries to sell you anything other than one-size of Yorkie (this includes the terms 'tiny' or 'babydoll face') run in the opposite direction because they're trying to sell you a sick runt that probably won't live passed it's second birthday.    Also, when looking for your Yorkie pup or adult, avoid buying online or from pet stores. Those dogs from from puppymills which are nothing more than factories used to churn out massive numbers of dogs to ship to pet stores around the world. So never, ever buy a dog online or from a pet store. To learn more about pet stores and the horrors of puppymills check http://www.adoptdontshop.com/ and http://www.stoppuppymills.org/    You could think about rescuing a Yorkshire Terrier, and saving it's life.  If you live in the United States, you can check http://www.petfinder.com/ for Yorkies (or any breed of dog) for adoption in your area.    If you're set on getting a dog from a breeder, you'll want to get one from an ethical and responsible breeder. But you'll want to remember one key thing: patience. Not only will it take time to find the right breeder, but you may be put on a waiting list or even denied by the breeder. Getting a dog from a responsible & ethical breeder is a lot of work. To see those breeders check out the Yorkshire Terrier Breed Club http://www.ytca.org/|`|WajPIdN6aa	Male or female, they require the same amount of training. There is not much of a difference. for a detailed guide, check out http://anand00.blogspot.com . i posted a very detailed article on training yorkshire terrier|`|s84kP2Fiaa	I have 30 + years of experience with yorkies, and which sex is easier to train is all up to you. Either sex will make you a wonderful little lap dog. Make sure you get a small crate, have the puppy on a leash or have a FENCED area to take the puppy to to do his business, they are quick and curious and it would only take seconds for your puppy to get into the street or get hurt or killed. The more time you put into training your puppy and the more you talk to him or her, the better pet he/she will become.The amount of time to housebreak also depends on you, I have some that were housebroken completely by 6 months old, others took up to a year (when I worked and couldn't be home to take them out during the day.)  If you can't get up in the middle of the night when they need to go out, you can easily get puppy pee pads or newspaper and put them near the door. This helps in 2 ways, first, they will learn to go to the door and then you know they need to go out. Second, it alleviates the puppy trying to hold it, yorkies are very small and they can not hold it for long periods of time. When they need to go, they need to go right then..  Get a book on housebreaking, all the answers are there.The biggest mistake people make is NOT crate training the puppy first. I hope this helps
8i90ov0Gaa	You don't say what kind of snake, but I'm guessing a red tailed boa since you mentioned one in a previous question. I feed mine rats and rabbits. If yours is eating two mice, you can move up in size to a small or rat. A meter long boa can easily eat a small rat.|`|7IVrBiT1aa	Oh my gosh.

35ec2288b9b65db7c42cb30727a1daf2aa	Elbow grease! Groom him really well before you ride, making sure to curry him well to shed excess hair, remove surface dirt, and let down natural oils. Then use a medium brush followed by a soft brush to remove dirt and hair. Curry again after to you ride and brush him again. (Make sure you also rub down his legs). Before you touch his mane or tail, put some detangler in it. I like Cowboy Magic, but use whatever you have on hand. If you want a thicker mane and tail, there's a great product called MTG (mane, tail, groom) by Shapley's. It works in about a month. You can use oral additives; like Nu-Image which is pretty inexpensive. A hoof supplement will help his feet and his coat if that's something he needs. Adding oil to his feed will also help him put on weight and help his coat. (But nothing compares to good, daily grooming. His coat will be beautiful if you put the effort in.)<br>  As far as the muscle goes; lots of trotting! Trotting builds muscle, cantering breaks it down. Turn on the forehand and haunches will also help build muscle. (This is why you want to curry him after riding, building muscle can make him sore, but currying will decrease lactic acid build up and promote circulation.) Also, half-passes, side passes, and leg yielding are all great ways to build up hindquarters. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|gDh1t1Yyaa	That made me lol :P<br>  Erm first of all, that horse has obviously been proffesionally groomed, specially bred and it has a different type of fur, and it's body is very toned.<br>  Your pony has his winter coat, which is why his body doesn't look like that. If you want more muscle on your horse, trot up hills, lunge him everyday, do things that will build him up.<br>  As for his mane, its just how it is. Some horses manes are really afro like, others a dead straight - its just how it it :)|`|IJoM4Q50aa	Depends on how much of all this feed you are giving him.  How old is he? I think it's safe to say he won't look quite as nice as that horse, which is a lot younger and most likely a stallion. <br>  Your horse looks like he could be pretty nice in his own right. Just take it slow building him back up. Be sure to get his teeth checked. That could make a huge difference in his appearance along with worming.<br>  I think he's going to really nice.|`|qIOYS9vKaa	There is definitely a difference in the two horses.

Have his teeth looked at.Free feed him lots of long hay, grass or teff. Give him some good fat sources,  such as corn oil or rice bran. The beet pulp doesn't really put on weight. Replace it with a good senior feed that is easily digested. And brush, brush ,brush his coat every day to stimulate the natural oils.It is harder to put weight on a working horse than to take it off. He needs more calories than he is using. Keep working him but not to heavy. Good long walks and trots up hills will build up his butt.Use a good conditioner on his mane, something you would use yourself.Keep it trimmed and lightly brushed|`|UIM8X38Oaa	I LOVE your horse buy the way,  I love the foundation bred ones he looks alot like my mare.  Anyways, I would suggest a blanket, hood, and sleazy if you can afford if you are going to start showing him soon.  If he is blanketed he will hold his weight better to.  Then just start grooming his coat give him a good curry and brushing every day.  Exercises him everyday. You can also put some vegetable oil into his feed. And you probably don't want to do alot now in the winter but when you give a horse good workouts and they sweat then you just rinse them off with water as using to much soap will remove the oils and dry out their coat but rinse with water you will start to see his shine coming through.  It works great. <br>  <br>  How Fun!  I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Jenny<br>  <br>  Lots of great advice on here.|`|7e0e9a04534a32e816cd47711fb850c9aa	Many gave you good answers. <br>  <br>  Make sure he's sane and parasite free. Ivomectin liquid is good.<br>  <br>  Food wise, this is what I give my horses for weight control:<br>  Purina Horse#3582: 3lbs per meal  2/day<br>  Purina Equalizer: 100ml per day (for energy)<br>  wheat bran: 1/2 cup per meal<br>  corn oil: 1 cup per meal<br>  Free fed hay all day :1.75lbs per 100 lbs<br>  Carrot,potato,beet,turnip and garlic added to feed(gives a shinny coat and the vitamins he needs),<br>  If he is healthy you will begin to see a difference within a month.<br>  <br>  Exercise every day but no work out. Go gradually so he can keep the extra pounds you are working on him to gain. <br>  <br>  Another reason why he may not gain weight is that he may suffer some kind of pain. Check his tail how he carries it: centre, to the right or to the left when he walks. If it's not centred he has pain, tail to the left =pain on the right side v/s. If he carries it high and on either side = pain upper back or neck, opposite side of the tail. A good equine acupuncturist could relieve him from his pain, but make sure he uses saline water and not iodine.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Oh! he is a pretty horse|`|MJpDjGeUaa	Definitely needs worming, I thought "he" was about to foal with his hay belly. I'm not sure of of what type of showing you're into, but working Q/H's around here have "roached" manes. The mane is cut off with the exception of a hand hold and forelock. A good exercise if you don't have cattle to work is simple "pole bending", letting the horse set his own pace. As he progresses you can offset the poles to make him work the bends a little more, instead of pushing him hard.  RScott|`|pMMcEvFsaa	Potentially, you could make your horse looking that healthy, but it would take a lot of effort and time on your part. First, build his muscle up a little bit. I used a performance feed to boost my Quarter Horse when we first got him...let me tell you...it worked like a charm! It does two things: gives him more muscle and gives him more energy and spunk (of course, that which you could handle!) in the show ring. Next, work on his coat a little. There's a product called Show Sheen that you can get at your local tack store...they might even have it a t a feed store! You can spray it on his body and his mane and tail to make them extra-shiny! You also might want to clip him a little to get rid of some of his winter coat.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and I forgot to tell you that if you go to a local feed store, you can just tell them that you're looking for performance feed, and they'll know what you're talking about.|`|AA11498082	Good coat starts inside.<br>  <br>  Grooming.

They're not like kittens or puppies, where yu can pet or scratch them a couple of times & they'll go off by themselves.<br>  <br>  If you start out giving them a lot of attention, then don't give them the same amount, some turn into screamers or biters or feather pluckers or even mutilators.<br>  <br>  A dusky would need a cage about 24"x24"x24" as a minimum...but bigger is always better.<br>  <br>  Since you have cats, you should wash your hands after handling your cats, before handling your bird(s).

However, if you can have your bird out for at least four hours a day in a bird safe room, without cats, then it's entirely up to you. You must keep in mind though that something as small as a lick or a scratch from one of your cats to either of your birds can be a death sentence. They have such potent bacteria under their claws and in their mouths, cats do, that it doesn't take much to kill the bird.<br>  <br>  Right off hand, I would say get the conure. Not that I have anything against cockatiels- it's just that you said you were able to hold him and that you fell in love with him. Generally that means that he had a favorable reaction to you as well. If that's the case, then you're more likely to have a good relationship with that conure than a randomly picked cockatiel.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, though, that you need to do plenty of research. A conure can be much louder than a cockatiel. You need a large cage, plenty of toys, a healthy diet of pellets and bird-friendly fresh foods (which means you have to find out which foods are toxic), and he needs plenty of time outside of the cage. Also, since a conure is bigger than a cockatiel when he does bite you (and he will; it's part of having a bird) it's going to hurt a lot more. <br>  <br>  As for the first few nights, keep him away from your budgie and somewhere away from your cats while he adjusts to his new home. Make ABSOLUTELY sure that your cats can't fit their paws through the bars of the cage.

Maybe you can trade the cat's room to be a room for the birds. i'm just suggesting.|`|qENGaDWdaa	Hi there<br>  i'm the proud owner of paco, a green cheeked conure, and two cats. in my aviculture experience, i've found that conures are much louder than cockatiels and budgies, but also have alot of personality. be forewarned that just because the bird loves you in the store doesn't mean that he'll be quiet and cuddly once he learns how to push your buttons. my bird loves to pull strings and test boundaries with loudness and such. a dusky conure can be very loud*.<br>  however, as part of being louder, the cats pose much less of a threat to them. cockatiels will act like prey around cats, and look it too. their large fanning tails scream out to bored cats. my cats, however, are afraid of my bird because of his size and beak.<br>  in conclusion, i think conures are much easier to screw up, as they learn quickly from your mistakes as a trainer and will not forget how you gave them attention that one time for sqwawking and will continue to try, but they also have a great potential to be a longlived companion.<br>  hope it helps!<br>  <br>  *i've always hated when people just say things like "loud" or "fairly loud" so here's a comparison by a dusky conure owner."How loud is loud? Well, to me, if Dusty is at full volume I can't get closer than about 3 feet without my fingers in my ears."
g5dzse2Zaa	Oh no that's horrible. I totally agree is disgustingg to cook an animal alive no matter its size, they apparently scream when they are cooked alive. I also don't eat lobsters but my family do and if they catch them they will put them in the freezer first as the go to sleep and then they will cook them.|`|py25T599aa	meh life sucks <br>  you pull vegetables out of the ground alive so there is no difference|`|IrdZKYT3aa	Weird but I actually just read about this the other day = D<br>  Diff article though : )<br>  What the article said, was their nervous system wasn't technically capable of the higher functioning thoughts required for pain.<br>  However, it also stated that they do exhibit the tail twitching movement they would have performed to escape a predator in the water.  Bacially, recognizing the damage.<br>  The article summed it up with they could clinically catalog and recognize they were being damaged but were not capable of feeling pain as we know it.<br>  As for why do we cook them alive?  Their bodies contain certain bacteria and enzymes that begin to rapidly multiply upon their death, killing them and then cooking them allows these life threatening bacteria to take hold of the food and potentially make us very ill.  Killing them as you cook them is an efficient way to prevent these from spoiling the lobsters meat.<br>  The article also stated that putting the lobster on ice first and then boiling it did not anesthetize the animal, it in fact prolongs the death and torture.<br>  So bringing the water to a boil and then dropping them in is the quickest way to do this.<br>  BTW I don't eat them either, this was all from the article : )<br>  Hope this helps!<br>  Best of Luck!|`|zzkmdusEaa	Why do they boil them alive? Because if you cook them with their soul intact you gain their abilities and wisdom.<br>  <br>  No, I have no idea, be sure to bring this up to the next person you see doing this.

0e887501126bed50bff9795d128b616faa	Too hot or too cold, the baby inside will die. Is there some reason the egg would have gotten too hot or cold? It takes about 18 days for a budgige egg to hatch, so too much over 18 days, and chances are, it won't.|`|L0xlHKCeaa	Make sure you do not disturb the nesting bird at all. Good Luck.
oACF40HYaa	W.C. is wrong when he states that the hen usually does not sit until she has laid all her eggs. Although this is correct for some species it is incorrect for budgies.<br>  Budgie hens usually start sitting from the moment the first egg is laid. They lay every second day and the babies usually hatch on the 19th day. Sometimes the hen, if inexperienced, will not sit until the second egg is laid. A hen budgie cannot feed four or five babies that are born the same day, she needs the young to be different ages so that she can feed each one food relevant to it's age. This ranges from crop milk for a new born up through different consistencies for each chick.<br>  You say that she was sitting in one box but laid in another. Once your hen settles into a box any surplus boxes should be removed to avoid this happening. If she has returned to sitting in a different box from where the egg is you could consider moving the egg, I would be more inclined to wait until she has laid again and is sitting on it before transferring this egg to the box she is sitting in.|`|y31mee4Faa	Leave her alone & see where she lays the rest of her eggs.  Usually, birds don't start sitting their eggs tight until the last one has been layed & your budgie should have 3-5 more coming.<br>  <br>  Don't remove the eggs or she will just lay another one to replace those taken & this can be dangerous for the bird as it will take too much calcium from her body.<br>  <br>  You need to provide her with a source of calcium, powdered supplement, cuttle bone, scrambled egg, etc.  The powdered can be sprinkled over soft food like oat meal, farina, applesauce, etc.<br>  <br>  Let her sit her eggs until she gets bored with them or they hatch (if she's got a mate).  If she's the only bird in the cage, you need to move her food & water closer to her nest, as males normally feed setting hens.<br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|yMbw0Osnaa	now that she has started laying take all boxes out except the one she laid her last egg in.put the egg from the other box in the one you keep.

8ym4ypABaa	You can spend sometime just sitting out by the cage reading a book, listening to music..w/e.. so she can get used to your presence. Then you can maybe feed her treats and pet her little by little. It does make it more difficult when she is outside. You can maybe get a animal playpen and sit in it with her.<br>  <br>  As far as holding her, it depends on each rabbit if they even like to be held. Their natural instinct tells them to struggle when being held/restrained..so some don't even like being picked up. You have to read her body language and actions when you are about to pick her up. I would suggest not doing this right away so you don't stress her out..wait till she gets to know you. Also, when a rabbit struggles they can easily injure their spine (so be very careful).|`|nOU8WvmDaa	to fully bond with a rabbit you must become the rabbit, think like the rabbit, eat what the rabbit eats, hop around your house with bunny ears on, feed the rabbit off of your body.

It's more a question of where you'll be getting a dog from.  If you want a purebred, go to a good breeder who will allow you to see the parents.  If you go to a shelter, the staff can help you find a dog that gets along with other dogs.<br>  <br>  If you need a dog that will get along with rodents, avoid terriers and hounds.  They were bred for hunting rodents, so while there are exceptions, generally terriers and hounds are not generally considered good around small animals.
1Qh9i9cWaa	Most fish problems are caused by poor water quality. Immediately test your water for ammonia and nitrites. Ammonia and nitrite should be 0ppm. If you have recently changed any of water and added water that differed from the tank temp, you could have shocked the fish. Likewise, if you have buffered the water for pH, you could have shocked the fish. pH needs to be stable. Stable pH is always better than fluctuating pH, even for cichlids. <br>  <br>  Many fish will rest on the bottom due to constipation from overfeeding. Check your water chemistry. If your ammonia and nitrites are more than 0ppm, perform partial waters of about 20% per day until the parameters are in line. If you've over fed the fish, starve it for 2 days and it should become active again.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Goldfish if not eaten immediately by your oscar are huge ammonia waste producers..|`|u5dF8i8haa	yo bro maybe their sleeping

jQvT6k7raa	I had a similar experience, (I was bucked off) and I can honestly tell you that time will heal all. Just go to the barn as often as you can, maybe just lead him around. What helped me was hanging the lead rope over my horses neck and having him walk beside me. Just remembering how much he trusts you really helps. Then lunge him, and when you feel like it, saddle up. Push your self as far as you are comfortable, and end on a good note. I was also felling scared at a canter, but what I ultimately did was just ask for a lope, relax my seat, and ask for the transition..then lope just a few good strides, stop and reward If I got tense, I would bring him to a walk, reward him, breathe, and try again. Eventually, I decided to do some bareback riding, so my horse would learn to be more responsive, and we would both improve, even I if only walked of trotted. It worked wonders. With a little encouragement from my friends, I was soon loping around bare back with perfect ease..on a very fast horse! Something I couldn't do even before my fall. I also learned how to do around the world, and rode side saddle bare-back, rode with just a halter for the first time, and now, I'm braver than ever before! And as a little extra bonus my instructor said that riding bare=back improved my leg position sooo much!<br>  In your case, I think you should continue riding as you always do, but remembering that when you are tense you stop riding and start scaring your horse, so if you start to get scared, breathe. Then, if you are up to it, ditch the saddle and just get the feel of your horse again. You will also improve you balance, and your over all riding ability, and your horse will learn to listen to your seat, and your emotions more than your hands, witch makes for a much nicer ride.<br>  The scariest part of it, for me, was the transition...my horse has a terrible canter transition. If the transition is hard for you, too, just kiss, grit your teeth, and once you get up to the canter, relax, and move to the rhythm. Loping bareback is amazing, once you get it down!<br>  You can also to the lunge line, and just do ground work, but if you want to get back into saddle, you have to face your fear as soon as you can, or you could develop a permanent fear of loping. I didn't have anyone around to keep my on a lunge-line, so I relied on my own abilities, and just did it!<br>  Best of luck in all things horsey!|`|IJoM4Q50aa	Just get back on. Take it slow until your ready to step it up. Try some breathing techniques to help with your nerves. Talk to your self and calm your self down.|`|MUfMJYHGaa	Did you see a doctor? You may have suffered a concussion or brain bruise. You also may have tweaked your spine and have a pinched nerve. Any of these can cause balance problems. The jitters come from having injured yourself and being worried it will happen again. That is something that you will have to work on just by riding in environments where you feel secure. Get a helmet, change your saddle, ride with friends, stay in the arena..whatever it takes.And you probably got nipped in the head when he jumped over you. You won't remember it because that's what knocked you out.|`|Qj9pPMf5aa	I've had that almost exact same thing happen to me, I'm thirteen. what I did was at first I just spents time with my horse, walking around his turnout with him. to get his trust agian. Then when I decided to ride i rode at everything EXCEPT the canter. And at about the third lesson, have someone watch you so you feel you have to push yourself. Then do your normal routine and ask for the canter. I know how hard this is, trust me though a for a couple of laps and you'll be fearless agian. Also, when you are really tense and scared, your horse can sense it so try and relax! I know how hard it is but you'll get over it soon! Also after you first canter, only do a couple of laps, then tell him he's a good boy and cool him off, this wy you end on a good note!|`|yNHBBQ6faa	this happened to me! people always say that you should get back on the horse after a fall! it doesn't seem obvious to any one else why some one who fell of a week ago won't canter, but to the person who fell it's as if it's the most obvious thing in the world. don't not ride, that's not going to solve any thing- just work at your own pace, how ever if your trainer asks you to canter it's not because she wants to get you killed, more because she knows you can do it and the more you put it off the more chances there are of you backing down and think about why it's so terrifying.<br>  don't think about it as much as possible and try to stay calm and relaxed when you're asked to canter, you'll canter in your own time (a little steering in the right direction by some one experienced can help). just do what you're comfortable with and try not to get up set about it.|`|6FsZykp1aa	wow you havent been riding since you were two years old, your parents probably held your hand while you were on, not the same thing, you dont actually learn much posture of any kind until you've been riding for at least two years and you are older than 12.|`|Fmq1YEtyaa	start off slow and remember...if ur nervous your horse can feel u and he will think "well if shes nervous i should be too" u dont want that to happen! start slow and maybe on the lunge line and when u feel a little more comfortable u can start cantering! but stay calm and relaxed dont make ur horse think u r nervous!<br>  sorry about ur fall!|`|OJIXRFxMaa	Is there anyway you could work with your horse on the lunge line to help build or confidence? I had a bad fall, and I had to re-build myself on the lunge line, where I was sure that somebody had a grip on him.<br>  <br>  Try spending time with him on the ground first. Not in the saddle, take a break for a while. Work on your bond some more.<br>  <br>  If you get all wound up in the canter, just take a deep breath, and work up to being able to do it again.
8Cvv86Jeaa	The best advice I can give you is introducing them on common ground. Your dogs are being aggressive and passive because they are on dominant ground. You need to introduce them where neither can claim territory. Like a park or something. Don't bring toys because that will give them something to be dominant over. The worst thing to do is keep them in the house together but separated. It makes one think they are getting something the other isn't. Another thing...don't ever let the other dogs stand over one another while one is on the ground or something. You need to break your dogs of showing dominance over anything. You are the dominant one and that needs to be made clear. Especially with a Rott. This will help you big in the long run. If they do it, catch them off guard and shove them away while saying a firm no and walking into them! Trust me, I've had a Beagle and a German Rottweiler. Best two dogs I've ever had. RIP|`|3hBQz33Yaa	we just got a puppy and i have another dog who is 5. he does NOT like the pup..he will snap at him if he touches him (doesn't actually bite i think its more of a warning) and he growls at him. i watch him very carefully when theyre both roaming free in the living room and if the pup goes near my older dog, touches him etc. and my older dog doesn't growl or snap i praise him i tell him good boy, give him a treat and love on him. it seems to be working because hes not near as bad as when we first brought the pup home. now he knows when i say good boy what the routine is because he will come running to me waiting for his treat. lol|`|EcAeLWLFaa	awwww! well for the dogs who arent mean to the new baby then its okay they will get used to the new baby if u decide to keep it. and for the ones that are mean u have to let it be know that they have to calm down. sit with them and feed them yummy treats when they are nice to the puppy until they learn to be nice without treats. Good luck.|`|N9IE36uBaa	Don't listen to Michael R. They are just like every other dog breed- if raised in the wrong environment they get temperamental. Temperament tests show that, proportionately, there are more aggressive golden retrievers, cocker spaniels, and chihuahuas in the US.|`|HmPivTTcaa	Show them to each other through a closed screen door so they can sniff and get used to each other.|`|mLKxxHefaa	pits are not the devil, michael r is the devil for saying so.|`|WPYRSSlQaa	they just want to show ur dog dominance let them ruff him up a little they will eventually stop|`|9G03aQhsaa	Well, since it is a puppy your dogs should come to accept it a little easier than if it were an adult since puppies are less threatening.  Really it will just take time for them to get used to each other.  I'd keep the puppy in a seperate room when you are not there to keep an eye on things.  When the dogs are seperated, make sure that the puppy has something with your other dogs scent and your dogs have something with the puppies scent.  Most importantly, you want you other three dogs to think that this new puppy is the best thing ever.  To do this, give your other three dogs extra attention and play time.  Also, give them a treat each time you bring the puppy in to play with them.    Also, give each dog some one-on-one play time with the new puppy so they can form bonds.|`|GaL66jbQaa	they just need time don't leave them unsupervised. only have one of them around the puppy at a time so it is easier to control the situation|`|uSjy6vgnaa	I know you not going to like me asking but how did you "find" a puppy.  I have had my dog three years.  One time he got lose.  It wasn't that far from home and he would have found his way home but guess what.  Some kids found him and thought he was lost, so they took him home.  I spent 24 hours on the coldest day of the year (-30) looking for him in a panic.  I have heard about other people losing their dogs this way.<br>  . I often think lost dogs would find their own way if people wouldn't interfere.<br>    I apologize if I am just jumping to conclusions.|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	It is normal for other dogs, when bringing a new member in to the pack, to act dominantly toward it. Packs have ranks. You have to establish yourself as the alpha, and spay and neuter your pets also. Unneutered males will often display unnecessary aggression.|`|C1fBdw95aa	Just make sure it's not a pit bull because pit bulls are the devil.|`|eSDoWrgoaa	haha its a rot?

zqVDJxUIaa	Ok this is probably going to be the only serious answer :)<br>  First of all, your conditions are not great. your ammonia levels are way too high and you are planning to put in way to many fish. Keep in mind that it's 1 inch of fish per gallon, and most of those fish grow much larger than one inch. For a 5 gallon, I'd say maybe three fish or so, to allow for growth. Second, get rid of the ammonia and nitrites. Right now, your aquarium would be 'total tourture' for your fish. Get some ammonia remover and use Cycle (a product by Hagen) to establish bacterial colonies. This 'biological filtration' is important for your aquarium, because bacteria convert harmful chemicals (ammonia and nitrites) into harmless ones. Lastly, a guppy is probably one of the most peaceful fishes out there, and is probably going to be the smallest in your aquarium...so no worries :)<br>  For more info (IMPORTANT!) on cycling, visit <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biologicalcycle/a/nitrogencycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biolog...</a><br>  Good luck with your aquarium, and don't forget:<br>  -Don't overcrowd!!!<br>  -guppies are peaceful!<br>  and about 1" of fish per gallon of water<br>  P.S. I can tell you're new at this, you don't need to say....|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Joke topic is fail.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	You gotta watch them guppies man, you're right to be wary of him  : P|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Trolling, trolling, trolling|`|25CAIGfeaa	hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..............|`|MPQI8Bg3aa	LMAO!|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Kids.. stay away from the Drugs...|`|nP1hNAUDaa	haha yea everything you have sounds like perfect water conditions...watch out for guppies mine bit me bad when i was sleeping, they can walk
IrdZKYT3aa	Pretty much all of them can turn on their tank mates for their slim coat.  The key to avoiding it is keeping them well fed.<br>  A bristle nose will stay relatively small, but how big is the tank you intend to have these two in?<br>  If it's too small and he  feels crowded the bristle nose may become territorial and aggressive towards the goldie as well.<br>  Basically, make sure the tanks big enough for both and the water conditions are good.  <br>  Don;t expect the pleco to live off of only what's in the tank.  This is a sure fire way to turn him on the goldie.  Make sure to offer fresh zucchini and cucumber as well as algae chips.  I've tossed in vacation feeders as well, they like these.  Just be careful as these can break down  pretty quickly in the tank and trash the water quality.<br>  Other than a bristle nose I just suggest rubber lip and clown pleco's. They all stay around the same size.  Just avoid common placos and chinease algae eaters, both can get very large and CAE are known for turning on thier tankmates for more protein when they get older.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Tropical fish and coldwater fish should not be mixed.|`|nP1hNAUDaa	they generally wont attack other fish so i doubt the slime coat would be endangered, you could even buy slime coat if you are worried. people have koi and plecos together often make sure the temp is at a range suitable or somewhat suitable for both and theyre be fine
ptNy4uicaa	at 3 days old they cannot swim, due to the fact the down feathers will soak like a sponge and the ducklings will drown. You can house the ducks and the duckings together, but do not allow them in the pond until they get their adult feathers. Mother duck usually secrete a oil to prevent water from soaking in. I would wait until the ducklings start to develop mature feathers. they can go in shallow water that they can touch the bottom, or if you supervise the swimming they can go in deeper water.
m1ypmbNKaa	Absolutely if you put it in a light and you see pink that means the egg is in good condition.If you cracked those eggs and you see that pink baby it was about to hatch but you killed it.Its alright just be patient and the bird will hatch.People say birds that lay there egg it will take 18-22 days for it to hatch.It could be like it little longer like one or two days,but otherwise the bird will hatch.When it does hand feed it and feed it good diet for the baby.Good Luck!|`|yMbw0Osnaa	yes it was going to hatch.eggs are laid on alternate days so the incubation time is two days different for each egg.be patient.and leave the last egg to hatch on its own.
JgC9a8m2aa	It could be a sign of periodontal disease. How do his gums look - do they appear to be inflamed? When he eats, does he look like he's having a hard time chewing the kibble? Do you notice any plaque or tartar build up? If it's his breath that's stinky and you notice any of the other problems I mentioned above, then you might want to have him looked at by a vet. Your vet can do a more extensive cleaning. Periodontal disease can lead to other problems, so get him checked if you think there's a tooth/mouth problem going on. Good luck with him!|`|BdlGBdE5aa	Dog bad breath is caused by the same bacteria on the tongue was the bad breath in humans.  This bacteria needs to be removed if you are going to cure bad breath.

jhZegrqRaa	Puppies are (or should be...) wormed every two weeks until they are 12 weeks old. Starting with a liquid preparation at 2 & 4 weeks then when they are 6 weeks and after use a worming tablet specially for puppies. Whilst the pups are still with their mother she should be wormed at the same time as the pups as she will pass them back to the babies via her milk.<br>  <br>  A day or two after worming it is normal to see long thin worms in their feces. <br>  <br>  After 12 weeks, worming every 3-6 months is sufficient.|`|b1461ee6cb21361aad22b1b0151b5104aa	take him to the vet, dont worry, my 4 month old pap just had his final shots, and to the person who said that they do not do shots for deworming, is wrong , i've had all 4 of my puppies dewormed by a shot. good luck.|`|O4M6BEDJaa	Take him to the vet, are you sure what they gave him was a de-wormer I work at a vet's office and  I've never heard of a shot for worms they have always given them meds by mouth.|`|A9j7ahwsaa	shots do not cover worms. they cover viral disease such as, distemper and kennel cough. dogs are supposed to be wormed with a suitable tablet or suspension every 6 weeks|`|YdI0TLczaa	It's probably a tapeworm. Vaccines don't deworm. I use WormX plus. It takes care of tapeworms, roundworms, and hookworms. At the vet it'll cost you about $40 - $60 but I get mine at a local feed store for $12 for medium and large dogs, 4 tabs (1 tab per 50#). I don't know how much it is for small dogs, you would have to check. I have never had to treat my dogs a second time using this product. Also, tapeworm is usually transmitted by fleas. Keep your dogs flea free.**I'm sorry, I just realized I had a brain fart. They are roundworms but WormX treats these too,Tape worm looks somewhat like rice in the stool-edited 2/21**|`|ptNy4uicaa	if the worm looked similar to spaghetti your puppy is the host of some round worms (Toxocara canis and Toxascaris leonina) !!!!! <br>  <br>  This is very common for puppies, although they do not pose a serious threat should be taken care of. You can purchase a product called advantage multi, that treats fleas, intestinal worms, ticks, and heart worm!! You buy it in 6 month packages, that are a little pricey but is definitively worth the money!! A vet does not give worm shots, but rather gives you dog pills, liquid, or a topical solution like advantage to cure the worm infestation<br>  <br>  <a href="http://advantagemulti.petparents.com/aboutAdvantageMulti.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://advantagemulti.petparents.com/abo...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.beaglesunlimited.com/beaglehealth_canineintestinalworms.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.beaglesunlimited.com/beaglehe...</a>|`|S8aCj7m7aa	You didn't say if you lived in the North or South...it makes a big difference. If you live in the south, you need to have your dog on a monthly heart worm and flea medication to prevent this. Puppies normally get different types of worms (especially if you live in the South) but they are easily treated. HEARTWORMS are another story. Prevention is the key.

bnJLKQWMaa	I have a two year old Pembroke Welsh Corgi.  I train and show her in agility.  You should not have a problem with the apartment if you give your dogs lots of exercise, and I mean LOTS and things to keep the mind active and busy.<br>  <br>  You will get destructiveness if the dog is bored, left alone for long periods or lacking in stimulation.  What we have to remember is these tough little (don't let them hear you say little!) dogs were bred to run all day, herd cattle and be a watch dog for the farms in the harsh and hilly climate of Wales.<br>  <br>  The noise level can be trained out, mine does not bark much, if we have visitors she barks for a short time, they ignore her and it stops.<br>  <br>  I hope this is helpful.  I searched for a long time for my dog and am thrilled with how smart, loyal and obedient she is.  I have owned 7 other breeds before her but she is the best yet.  If you have time and patience you will be richly rewarded.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	As I explained when you asked this question before, as a Corgi owner, and volunteer with Corgi Rescue and with a fair amount of Corgi experience, I really wouldn't recommend a young Corgi in an apartment. I understand this is not what you want to hear, but I know how often we get Corgis into rescue because they barked too much, or were too distructive. <br>  <br>  If you have already made up your mind to get a Corgi, please consider an older rescue Corgi (over 7 or 8) who will be a little less high-energy and less likely to bark at every unusual noises. Corgis bark at noises. That's what they do. Some are boredom barkers as well. Even if you manage to avoid the boredom barker, Corgis were bred to alert their owners of approaching danger. You need to be ready to deal with 1000+ years of breeding. <br>  <br>  If you want a calm, quiet dog, DO NOT GET A CORGI.<br>  <br>  If you aren't ready and able to deal with a barky little dog, and I don't mean just haul it off to the Vet and debark it, DO NOT GET A CORGI. I have worked with several Corgis and have lessened the barking, but have not come close to eliminating it.<br>  <br>  Corgis puppies are destructive until they are over a year old. Most puppies are and Corgis are no exception. One of my rescues was under a year, and every blanket I own has been chewed, plus shoes, pillows, hats.... And someone was home nearly all the time.<br>  <br>  Please don't get a Corgi just to stick it in a little cage all day. They don't do well being crated.<br>  <br>  ADD: I expect you will listen to the one person who says it is a good idea to keep a Corgi in an apartment, so here is a link to Mayflower Corgi Club in your area. Contact their Rescue team if the Corgi doesn't work out. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mayflowercorgiclub.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayflowercorgiclub.org/</a>|`|4hNRTWtDaa	That's a pretty high energy dog.  They also tend to do a lot of barking.|`|TRfF23afaa	Two of my friends have PWC's. They live in homes with fenced in yards with family's and other dogs around. It's been a challenge, but not impossible.<br>  These are not easy dogs. If you read up, and are dedicated to socializing and exercising them round the clock then they shouldn't be any more destructive than any other bored puppy. The barking is a BIG problem, that's where the socialization comes in as they are guard dogs and very, very protective and become very attached to their  owners One of my friends dealt with it by going to group dog classes early on. The other one, the dog drives me nuts with the barking at everything that moves, and I can't be around it.<br>  HTH<br>  <br>  PS. Personally, I would remove the threat about points, i almost didn't answer because I found it insulting, and could care less about 2 lousy points, others may feel the same.|`|xZOlsByJaa	Corgis are herding dogs. They need loads of excersise.  Socializing and training are a must.  Most small dogs do well in apartments. If you give them the attention they need.  Corgis are not for everyone.

90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	Well, even though I don't normally answer these, I'll go ahead and do it, since I know the outcome.<br>  <br>  This is, of course, assuming both animals are near the same size.<br>  <br>  Having had the honor of witnessing fights of this sort at the alligator farm I got my start at, I can tell you that although crocs will typically start the fights in a captive setting, alligators finish them.<br>  <br>  Here's the thing though, both of these animals will posture and try to impress the other with how big it is before it actually breaks down into physical violence. They know that once it comes to locking jaws, there's not only a good chance of losing a limb, but also of losing a life... when adult crocodilians fight, they don't call "uncle" too often.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  As I said, this is if they're both near the same size, no arguement on the fact that an average adult salty or nile would eat an average adult alligator for lunch any day of the week, but put a 9 footer against a 9 footer or a 10 footer against a 10 footer (even give or take half a foot to a foot and a half) and the gator has it. Not sure if it has something to do with the broader jaws and therefore more surface area being covered by that 5000 pound plus per square inch or what, but as I said, gators will finish a fight in a captive setting. (considering that's one of the few setting where fights like this have a chance to occur... in south Florida where we have both alligators and American crocs, there's not too much cause for aggression against the two, it's just that in a captive setting there's usually not really enough room for everyone to be completely happy...)|`|2EIvAsZ6aa	Probably the crocodile, considering it is more aggressive and can grow larger in size to an alligator.<br>  <br>  I personally like the appearance of an alligator better though.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	Against an adult salt-water croc or Nile croc, an adult alligator does not stand a chance.

Dogs that have owners & escape are often picked up by animal control as strays.|`|C90bta8Saa	animals that are always in your freakin trash!!|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	"Strays" to me means any formerly domesticated animal - or whose parents were domesticated - and is now let to run through the streets and woods to fend for itself because it either ran away from its home, got out and got lost and never picked up, or someone dumped it.  But an animal can be considered a "stray" after just one day when it is picked up by animal control without a collar, for example, until the owners come to pick it up and pay the fine.|`|zzkmdusEaa	A stray animal is a domesticated pet that lives on its own, maybe it had a home before, maybe it didn't. Most of the time they exclusively mean dogs and cats, since those are the two main house pets that seem to runaway or get abandoned by their owners more often. You won't really find a stray bird, and if you did find one you wouldn't know if it was a stray or not because birds fly freely in both urban and rural areas. Dogs and cats on the other hand are mainly used as pets, if you see one wandering around you think "Poor thing where is its home?". Dogs and cats are the only housepets that get the animal shelters called on them to come pick them up (Excluding raccoons, coyotes, etc. Those aren't housepets.)<br>  <br>  So in retrospect, a stray animal is a homeless pet.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	stray animals are ones that someone dumps off somewhere. they dont' want them so they just take them out in the country and dump them to whom ever. that is why they are called strays.|`|a8gigwF8aa	lost animals....w/o a collar|`|dZCsMyjXaa	Any normally domesticated animal that is roaming wild, particularly around a city or town. There are also feral animals, which are different and usually several generations away from domestication.
55oy2i5caa	I just looked this up today for a pet sitting client of mine. <br>  Got it from Alley Cat Allies website: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.alleycat.org/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=375" rel="nofollow">http://www.alleycat.org/NetCommunity/Pag...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Quick Solutions:<br>  <br>  Scatter fresh orange and lemon peels or spray with citrus-scented fragrances. Coffee grounds and pipe tobacco also deter cats. <br>  <br>  Plant the herb rue to repel cats or sprinkle dried rue over the garden. <br>  <br>  Obtain Cat Scat?, a nonchemical cat and wildlife repellent consisting of plastic mats that you cut into smaller pieces and press into the soil. Each mat has flexible plastic spikes that are harmless to cats and other animals, but discourage digging. Available at www.gardeners.com. <br>  <br>  Plastic carpet runners, which can be found at local hardware or office supply stores, can also be used when placed spike-side up and covered lightly in soil. Or, set chicken wire firmly into the dirt with sharp edges rolled under. <br>  <br>  Place some of the following over soil: branches in a lattice-type pattern, or wooden or plastic lattice fencing material artfully arranged. You can disguise these by planting flowers and seeds in the openings. Try embedding wooden chopsticks, pinecones, or sticks with dull points deep into the soil with the tops exposed eight inches apart. <br>  <br>  Cover exposed ground in flower beds with large attractive river rocks to prevent cats from digging. (They have the added benefit of deterring weeds.)|`|IRaIxWJKaa	The strays do it here too, and the flowers use it like manure (which is what it is). I keep a trowel and some dirt handy and just toss more on top if the stuff wasn't buried.  My flower garden never had plants die from cat poop or pee, and I've got over 15 different varieties in there.|`|xBcdX9MMaa	I know how i got my cats to stop it, Put mint flower things in and they will stay away. All the cats in my street hate it. So give it a try it really works. And if it doesn't work for those cats, Put a kitty litter out there ( if they are your cats.) hope i have helped :) Byeeee   Taylor|`|NzOSFfojaa	If you don't mind the appearance, cover the ground with pea gravel. It looks very neat, organized, and my cats haven't been in the flowerbed since I spread the gravel.|`|nd30LQhlaa	theres some kind of plant that you can use....and sprays...and if you go to a walmart of tractor supply I believe they have something that you can just throw in your garden and it will help.|`|yRzEkPnpaa	Why dont you try spread a pungent mixture of oranged peels and used coffee ground onto your flowerbed.|`|53748744cddefdf672838d27d8300662aa	You might check out these ideas.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cat-repellant.info/html/renardine.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cat-repellant.info/html/renar...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cat-repellant.info/html/diy-cat-deterrents.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cat-repellant.info/html/diy-c...</a>
YAPYO7L8aa	My cats have been wet with sweat right before dieing of kidney failure. But to have just the head wet.... I've never heard of that one.|`|9G03aQhsaa	My cat gets hairballs a lot but her head is never wet, I can't even imagine how you're cats head would get wet from a hairball.  Was this just a one time incident, maybe she just got splashed with water or something?  This sounds really weird, if its happened more than once, you might want to call your vet.|`|Y8fDB2V7aa	i've noticed with my cat that her head gets wet when she gives herself a bath or even when she gets a drink from the tub or even the sink that her head gets wet. only on occasion she get a fur ball she will give herself a bath to make her head wet
rchaTSI9aa	First of all, please don't buy your hamsters at Petsmart. They're cruel to their small animals.<br>  <a href="http://www.petsmartcruelty.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmartcruelty.com/</a><br>  Yes, you could put them in the same cage as long as you follow these few rules: 1) Don't put two syrians in the same cage, they will fight to the death. 2) Make sure they're both boys, or they're both girls, or else, you're gonna end up with a lot of little hammies. 3) Make sure you have a big enough cage/ aquarium. <br>  <br>  Good luck choosing your hammies! ;)|`|ICCP8m26aa	No! Don't!! If you buy two hamsters and put them in the same cage they will fight. One will get killed, in about a year or so. They only put them together because they are the same kind of hamster. Don't put them together, OK? Otherwise when you love one, that could be the one that dies. Sorry about that talk. Just old school gerbils; one died.|`|sdqmO15Aaa	Yes, you could, they could make babies though. Watch them for a few days and if you start to see them fight, you know you have to switch the cages, which isnt hard, it will be fine, try it. If you get a boy and a girl, which i wouldnt do, they would make ALOT of babies so if that is what you want, go for them otherwise go for two girls-two boys.|`|oNHtVHzsaa	you need to make sure that at the store they were in the same cage. the hamsters can't be territorial and have to get a along. the first few days just make sure that they get along. good luck and say hi from Maya|`|dc500182581d351f03c845444a3479f5aa	yes|`|jUtURfrXaa	if they are the same gender DO NOT put them in the same cage... they may fight and that can result to bruises and even death among hamsters... on rare occasions they might be friends but you dont want your hamster to die. I think you should *** the hamsters *** if they are the same gender so they will get along
f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	This is a result of bad breeding. People who breed mutts do not do any health testing, nor do they know he dogs in the pedigree, and the health issues they might have had.. It is actually very very irresponsible of them to do this.. as you now know, a badly bred dog comes with severe health issues.. Do not support puppy mills and backyard breeders, or you will always end up with dogs with horrible health problems.<br>  <br>  Take the dog to your vet and have him treated properly.|`|PM23RDycaa	Bad breeding and poor genetics<br>  <br>  Limping : patellar luxation or hip dysplasia<br>  <br>  Seizures: Pug Dog Encephalitis or Epilepsy <br>  <br>  <a href="http://bostonterrierclubofamerica.org/boston-terrier-health/articles/Patellar-Luxation-in-Boston-Terrier.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://bostonterrierclubofamerica.org/bo...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pugs.org/indexhealth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pugs.org/indexhealth.htm</a><br>  <br>  Talk with your vet about diagnosing the problem and treatment|`|ptNy4uicaa	the seizures and limping is probably not related is seems that your dog may have a few issues.<br>  <br>  I would take it to a vet ASAP, as seizures can be fatal, it has a neurological disorder that can probably be taken care of with meds. an example would be epilepsy.<br>  <br>  the limp may be cause by a lot of different things, maybe a sprain or something while jumping or a orthopedic problem such as a luxating patella (knee problems) which is common in small breeds<br>  <br>  Please take your pet to the vet asap, for the fact both orthopedic and neurological problems get worse with time, and should be cared for asap, because the can result in irreversible damage|`|dZCsMyjXaa	Take him to the vet.

b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	IGNORE IT|`|PM23RDycaa	And just how long has the dog been there? If its been there long enough for them to suspect that its actually living there they have every right to ask for a deposit.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Yes, they sure can. And ignoring it can get you evicted since it is a breach of your contract. It's a deposit, meaning that if the dog doesn't destroy anything then you'll get the money back when you move out.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	If the pet is in your apt, you are responsible for it and any mess it makes.  Typically the pet fee and deposit is to clean the apt after the tenant leaves.  Clearly, you are keeping the dog in your apartment, so yes, the landlord can require the fee.|`|m1V5ws73aa	Regardless of whether the dog belongs to you, yes they can.  However, if it wasn't in your lease when you signed it and moved in, they cannot legally change the existing lease, they can only add it onto the new lease should you renew it in March, if you stay.  Since you are planning to move, I would not pay it for the remaining time you will be there.  All they can do is try to bill you for it retroactively after you move, and if they do, you will be in the right legally.  Just make sure you keep your copy of the old lease, because you may have to go to court to fight it if they sue you.  It's a pain, but you have the law on your side.  If you need more advice, try contacting a legal clinic.  They are usually free and they can get you specific info on your state's lendlord/tenant laws.|`|KvUJZa1Paa	You should have told land lord or rental agent that you would be taking care of moms dog for a short while. How does he know you are not lieing to him and dog belongs to you. I mean you have been hiding dog for how long noe.  But had you told him he may have said it is ok as long as you pay for damage dog does, I doesn't matter when your rental lease is up, it was your place to notify land lord instead of sneaking one in. It could have caused you to be evicted.|`|FdcWPp48aa	Yes, they can.|`|DqUi0xPhaa	How long have you been watching it? If over a week or 2 I would pay it and not say another word.  Once the dog is gone then I would tell them and you should not have to pay the fee anymore but will not get the deposit back until the end of your lease.|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	hell no but check ur bylaw cuz it aint like that in ontario canada|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	Well, if its their policy to do this, which for many rented apartments/houses it is, there is nothing you can do. It does not matter that the dog is not yours, it is being kept on their property and they do have a right to ensure there are additional deposit funds to cover any damage repair/cleaning that may be needed.    As you are leaving in 6 weeks, try just going and talking to them and see if you can come to some agreement.|`|gJlxZdL5aa	Yeah they can.   Because that is a dog in the apartment and that dog could cause potential damages and they want that fee to cover the costs.  I'm not saying the dog is causing damages but that is how they see it.   Its policy    If the dog has been there more than a week or two you need to pay it.    They will continue to press you on this.    I would talk to them and explain the situation but they will still want it.  But since you are leaving in 6 weeks see if you can work something out|`|TjcPVFciaa	They can ask for a pet deposit, per your lease agreement.    I would make an appointment to talk to the property manager in person.  Explain the situation and see if there is any way they can work with you.  Perhaps they will let you pay a smaller deposit or none at all.      Whatever you do, don't ignore it, because they may be able to take that amount out of any deposit refunds owed back to you.|`|4c7QomPoaa	How long will the dog be there all together?  What is the policy on pets?  Did you speak to the landlord before you brought the dog in?  It doesn't matter if the dog belongs to you or not, this was something you should have addressed BEFORE you brought it home.  The fact that's it's only 3 pounds and you're lease is up soon doesn't have a thing to do with it.  You might try to negotiate and see if you can just pay the fee, but at this point, you might as well just pay it.|`|6cCWUf9xaa	All the leases I have been in states if the pet is yours you have to pay the fee, but if you are watching it as in pet setting no. The landlord is trying to extract more money out of you. Find out from an attorney on this matter where you reside and mention that they may deduct this from your security deposit. See what legal avenues you need to go through if landlord takes money out for this.
RN1wGlWWaa	If you mom is HIGHLY allergic to cats, she probably would not be able to tolerate any cat in the house.  Those with mild allergies can handle some breeds (Rexes, Sphynx, Ocicats, Bengals or Siberians).    Unless your mom is willing to take meds all the time to tolerate a cat in the house for the family, it would not be a wise thing to get any cat.    I bred Cornish Rexes (which are one of the breeds to cause less reactions).  A family wanted one cause their daughter was allergic.  So I let them take one of my kittens for a week (with instructions to keep the kitten out of the daughter's room at night) to see if they could adopt him.  Unfortunately after 3-4 days, the mom called in tears as the girl could not even tolerate a Rex (which doesn't shed).  I took the kitten back and sold him to another family.|`|hetZz4c1aa	Sorry, but a Bengal would be a problem for your Mom.    good luck!|`|6I8oG7DOaa	There is really no such thing as a "hypoallergenic" cat.  It is the dander and saliva that your mom is probably allergic to.  They have medications that she can take to reduce the symptoms just speak to your family Dr.|`|AA10496780	I don't know of any cat that is hypoallergenic. Poodle, Bichon Frisse, Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, Portugese Water Dog and Chinese Crested dogs are the only home pets I know that do not shed or have  dander.|`|NmoFHWUraa	all cats with fur have dander which is the common cause for allergies in people.  sphynx cats (hairless cats) are less likely to cause allergies (unless you mom is allergic to the cats saliva).  these are awesome cats, great personality and so funny looking! they do require extra care, such as baths and nail cleaning, and they have to be purchased from a breeder, but worth every penny.|`|61PECjigaa	I actually got a bengal mix, and I am allergic to pets. She got shorter hair and the reaction was less servere. I think once your allergic your allergic. But one thing I tell u about a Bengal is they ARE VERY LOUD....they talk and cry all the time. And very active ...running at least 8 hrs a day and you'll need a big house for this activity or u lose and arm or leg as she darts through. Hope I help ya I love her though..just a very demanding bengal named Peanut.....Shelley
kWwgWSSgaa	Regular grooming will help to keep the skin/coat in good condition. I also use a good quality salmon oil, dry coat wipes & have an excellent vaccum cleaner to remove all the hair which would otherwise coat the house, when my Dobes are shedding profusely.    My Dobermanns shed profusely twice a year & minimally for the rest of the year.|`|3wJGXfkKaa	The vet has something you can put in the dog's food that will greatly reduced shedding, don't remember the name but I've used it and it works.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	because she has a thick coat.  get a shed-ender or another shedding brush and brush her every day.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	It's normal for Rotties to shed constantly.

Rotts shed PROFUSELY=24/7/365.  Get used to it or place it.  There's absolutely NOTHING you can put IN or ON any dog to stop shedding.|`|Cni4Zh77aa	Feed him/her wild salmon oil. Just mix it in the food. That might help some.|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	Nothing but brush her regularly. Dogs shed all the time. If it seems excessive, make sure your house is not too hot, but otherwise, that is part of having dogs.    It's not just them......ever wondered why you have to clear your hair from your hairbrush regularly but don't go bald??? We shed hair too.    Just make sure your house is not too hot and that she has a good diet.|`|HlujNBdhaa	Not sure what you can do but my parents used to have a Rotty and he shed a lot.  It is part of the breed.|`|uWnFrXwHaa	aw i used to have the same dog but im not sure lol|`|5919d59a9a07aac4e14c50ba4d7d46b9aa	daily brushing|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Because that is what rotties do, they are a breed that shed a LOT. So long as her coat and skin are healthy and glossy, this is not unusual. You can get proper brushes or even mitts to 'strip' the coat so that less of it ends up around your home.    Chalice|`|AA10331093	You should groom him more often and it sheds a LOT LESS.....
ltIuUBXNaa	For the most part I agree with Obilysk, except about the pinkies. I was having problems with my BTS Yura, a trip to the vet proved that he had vitamin A & C deficiencies. After 3 weeks of injections and starting to feed him pinkies/hoppers once a week he improved. So feeding a pinkie isn't as bad as it could be. Yura is also too big to feed crickets to now so I don't bother with them. A great list of good fruits/veggies for them to eat is on the bluetongueskinks.net website. If you still can't get him to eat after trying some new items on the list a trip to the vet would be in order, he may have some parasite or worm.|`|TkJn9gO0aa	You're feeding him the wrong food items.    For my 2 Blue Tongue Skinks, I make a custom mixture using a blender.    I add : green beans, canned cat food, carrots, corn, and peas..... along with RepCal Herptavite. I freeze most of the batch in small containers and leave the container that I'm using in the fridge.|`|TmEoTapDaa	What's the temp in his enclosure? pinkies really are not healthy for them, they are mostly fat.

There are exceptions, but many people are in work attire.  Very few people wear evening clothes; really, that is only in the VIP section.  Last year, my friend was an honoree for a program at her work and she wore a simple dress.  I presume that you would not be asking this question if you were a handler.
4cWtH7X2aa	I'd recommend maybe going to your local shelter and adopting. Unless you're involved in showing it doesn't really matter whether you get pure bred or not. There's lots of animals out there needing forever homes.    Sorry this doesn't really answer your question but maybe something to consider :)|`|FXeuwkX0aa	Get a German Shepherd - all short hair dogs shed but shepherds are really smart- I used to have a white one (a llittle collie mixed in), you can imagine white hair- but isnt that bad as long as cordouroys stay out.

He shed some at first but we changed him to a better food and the shedding stopped.|`|Rok8nqKsaa	Both dogs have similar personality traits but the German Shepherd is generally more protective while the lab is hyper and outgoing.  Both dogs do shed.  I have a 7 month old lab and it seems like his hair is everywhere but it's nothing a good vacuum and a pet brush can't clean up.  You should also bring your current dog with you to pick out a new one so you know that they will get along alright.
YUQgyPT3aa	If you want a mutt / mixed breed / designer dog / whatever...your first place to go is a rescue or shelter, or Petfinder.com|`|C1eHfhrHaa	That is not a breed, so there would be no "breeder".  Check out the shelter.  They always have tons of mixes and you'd be saving a life.|`|PM23RDycaa	Nowhere.

4KY26xQqaa	mmm... You do get what you pay for...  But it looks okish but if it doesn't have a changeable gullet I would prefer a saddler to look over the saddle and check that it fits the horse or do it yourself at least...  http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-fit-...  If your doing jumping it's more comfy for the horse to have a fleece half-pad underneath but just a couple of local shows, hacking and a little schooling something like this would be fine..  http://www.horsetackinternational.com/al...  If you want to splash out this one is gorjusss!!!  http://www.tackroominc.com/perris-plaid-...    You just need an all purpose one really!|`|AA10986942	Do yourself a big favor and buy a used good brand saddle.  You will be much happier with a well broke in used quality saddle than a pretty (in the pictures only) looking new cheap hard one that is made of plastic or really really poor quality leather and will be horrible to ride in.    Look on ebay, you will find many many nice older saddles.  The good thing about English is they never go out of style they only get more comfortable with time and it is a plus that it is aready broke in for you!  So buy used, but top brand and you will never be sorry and will keep your saddle forever!|`|7lsU5bcoaa	OK The seat size tells us nothing about how the saddle is going to fit the horse. The horse's height also tells us nothing (btw 16.4 isnt a height it goes 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 17.0 - so 16.1 means 16 hands + 1 inch etc) To know how the saddle will fit him you need to know what tree size he uses. Tree sizes for english saddles are narrow, medium, and wide. If you choose a tree to narrow, it will pinch his withers and be very painful for him. If the tree is too wide it will not clear his withers and it will push on top of them. This also causes pain and discomfort. If you continue to use an ill-fitting saddle, you can cause long term damage. Here is an article on saddle fitting (fiting the rider is at the top, fitting the horse is at the bottom) : http://www.showhorsepromotions.com/saddl...    As for types of saddles, here is a brief overview:  Close contact - type of saddle used for jumping. The flaps are cut more forward, so the rider can ride with shorter stirrups as is necessary for jumping. The seat is shallow to allow the rider to move out of the seat easily for fences. (http://www.fourwinds.net/esadcat/img/er4... - picture)  Dressage - flaps are cut very long and straight, so the rider must use long stirrup. Less pads and blocks to allow the rider to give complex lower leg signals to the horse. Deep seat. Not suitable for jumping (http://www.hobbyhorsefarms.com/uploads/t... - picture)  All purpose - Longer straighter flaps than the close contact, more rounded and forward cut than the dressage. Deeper seat than the close contact. Can be used for low level jumping or flatwork. Ideally, if well made, should be suitable for all purposes (http://www.dragonflysaddlery.co.uk/items...  - picture)    SO, unless you want to do a lot of jumping or a lot of dressage, I'd say take the all-purpose, so you aren't limited by your saddle    The saddle you posted does not seem to be very good quality. I'd reccommend looking for a well made used one instead of a cheap new one. If you do buy that saddle, I highly recommend a new girth and bit. The girth posted looks like it would chafe the horse and be uncomfortable, and cheap bits risk causing metal splinters in the horse's mouth. But as I said I don't recommend that saddle. Also, you should get someone more experienced, like a coach, trainer, or barn owner to help you find a saddle that fits your horse.    As for saddle pads, get one that suits the saddle you get. Don't get a dressage pad if you buy a close contact saddle. A plain square pad should do, as long as it is of decent thickness and quality. Something like this : http://www.germes-online.com/direct/dbim... or this: http://www.abitoftack.com/product_images... , would work fine. You can also get a shaped saddle pad if you prefer (http://theloft-tackshop.com/media/Fleece... just make sure it fits well under your saddle.|`|Q8Sv4V48aa	That's a crappy saddle. They are made of cheap leather that falls apart, and they way they are built puts you in a bad position. If you are serious about riding you need to get a good quality saddle, bridle, and girth. Try looking on Ebay. I got a good saddle on there for $300, and it also came with a saddle pad, saddle cover, girth, stirrup leather, and stirrups. That saddle has lasted me 5 years and is still in good condition.  You would need an all purpose saddle pad. You can get them pretty cheap from almost anywhere.    Edit:  Here are some good saddles and saddle pads. =)  http://cgi.ebay.com/Thornhill-17-Pro-Tra...    http://cgi.ebay.com/Crosby-Mark-VI-17-En...

(I have one of these.)  http://horseloverz.com/Air-Cool-Waffle-W...|`|LGARG2zAaa	The problem with saddles is, you can't know if the saddle fits your horse until you actually put it on the horse!  If it fits poorly, your horse will be miserable at best and act badly and possibly buck at worst.      The saddle you're considering is an inexpensive, beginner-level saddle perfectly good for what you want to do, that may or may not fit your horse.  All horses are different widths and shapes!  But I assume since you're looking at extremely inexpensive saddles, that right now you're not going to be able to spend what it would take to consult a professinal saddle fitter and buy a saddle based solely on fit.  That's ok, as long as you do your best to make your horse comfortable with the saddle you choose.    So, the next best thing is to do your best to insure fit.  When the saddle arrives, clean your horse off thoroughly so you don't get the saddle dirty, and sit it on his back in the appropriate place.  Do not put on the girth. Examine the withers- is the saddle high enough that it's not rubbing the withers?  If it touches the withers, it doesn't fit, and will cause pain and even open sores where it touches, send it back.  If it clears the withers, great.    Next, stand at your horse's head and have him put his head down lower than his withers so you can look down the gullet of the saddle -the space between his backbone and the saddle- there's an open channel there- you should see daylight at the other end, if it's all the way down touching his backbone, it doesn't fit.  If you can see daylight, great.  Next, with the saddle still just sitting on the horse, insert your hand into the gullet (the area over the withers) and place it plam flat on the horse, and slide it down underneath the front edge of the saddle- the pressure should feel even on your hand the whole way down.  If it feels tighter near the withers than lower down, it's too narrow.  If it feels really loose near the withers and tighter below, it's too wide.  If it's too tight, send it back.  If it's too wide, but the saddle still doesn't touch the withers, you can make due by adding extra padding to make your horse seem wider to fit the saddle.    As for saddle pads- if you do all three checks for fit and the saddle seems to fit ok, then all you need is a plain all-purpose English saddle pad.  For example, this one:  http://www.chicksaddlery.com/page/CDS/PR... would work fine.  As long as the pad is described as "all-purpose" or "a/p" it will be the right size and shape for your saddle.  You can get really pretty ones these days in any color you like.  Or plain white or black if you prefer.  Avoid pads that are really thick or have extra padding- just a plain pad will be fine.    Once you've examined the saddle and determined that it seems to fit ok, tack the horse up completely including your saddle pad, and climb aboard.  Does your horse react to your weight in the saddle by hollowing his back or pinning his ears or any other sign of discomfort that he normally does nto display when ridden in a different saddle, or bareback?  If so, it may be a sign that the saddle is causing him discomfort or pain.  When you ride him in it, are you comfortable?  The comfort for the rider varies widely from saddle to saddle, and it's important that you are comfortabel in it.  If it's poking you somewhere uncomfortable, it won't get better, it will get worse!  You won't get used to it, I promise.    Ride your horse in the saddle, preferrably at least an hour of vigorous activity like trail riding or arena work involving lots of turning and trotting.  Does he seem to be moving freely and normally, or is his movement restricted and his strides shorter than usual?  If he acts strange the whole time, it may be the saddle doesn't fit.      The day after your ride, examine your hrose's back for signs of soreness.  First, look for obvious rubs or visible injury.  Then stand beside him, facing his withers, and place the hand nearest his rear on his back, flat, with the tips of your fingers touching his spine, and using firm to hard pressure, slide your hand down his back muscles along his spine towards his rear, all the way to the top of his rump- if at any time he flinches or sinks away from the pressure, you've found a sore muscle.  The most common place for soreness is the loins, the section of his backbone from mid-way down his back to just above his hip bones.  Repeat this on the other side- if the soreness is only on one side, it's likely you ride off-balance with more of your weight to one side!    If the saddle doesn't fit properly, your best bet is to return it and get something different to try.  If it's fit is close, you might be able to use padding to make up for the fit, but you need the hands-on help of a person experienced with saddle fitting to do it- maybe if you have a riding instructor or knowledgable sales person at your local tack store you could ask for help.|`|xi6avrGgaa	I may suggest you to visit a website given below which offers Quality Western Saddles, English Saddles, Horse Saddles, and Pony Saddles.    www.saddleonline.com    Thanks
89512b4a439d6f311cd06b16d97c9b22aa	Ok did your vet run a heart worm test? Just to be Sure!  Also to help him out a little make sure he is on a low sodium diet because alot of sodium can cause fluid to build around the heart..  Sweetheart there isnt much they can do about an enlarged heart,  except give him some meds maybe..  And i wouldnt let him be over active try to keep him as calm as possible so just make his life as great as possible... I am sorry!  alot of things can cause an enlarged heart. But it may be something else. That is why i asked if the vet check for heart worm or even kennel cough. Good luck please keep me informed. I so wish i could help you out more.|`|GT6396BDaa	Enlarged hearts are common in dogs as they get older.  You need to take your dog to his regular vet to be checked out.  They can give you medications to help.  When the heart is enlarged, fluid collects in the dog's lungs, which causes them to cough.  The medications help to get rid of the fluid and regulate the heart.  If it is very serious, they may refer you to a cardiologist, who can prescribe other stronger medications or treatments.  Dogs can live for years with this problem. I've had 2 that have had heart problems and have been on the medications for years.  They may need to change the dosage of the medications, until the coughing and stops.  Also, don't let him run a lot, because it will just make him cough more.  Best of luck to your dog.  Hope I helped.|`|5919d59a9a07aac4e14c50ba4d7d46b9aa	sounds like inbreeding raising its ugly head|`|AhCuDpU0aa	im sure he'll be alright just let him run around the house for awhile i hope he will be better :)|`|iIGOi2Idaa	The vet is the one to answer these questions, why aren't you asking them?!    Yes an enlarged heart is potentially serious. You MUST talk to a vet about this - if they suggested referral to a cardiac specialist, they will be able to put you in touch with an appropriate one.     Please do not take advice from people on the internet regarding you dog's condition. You will get a lot of conflicting advice and misinformation - even people who have also had dogs with enlarged hearts will not necessarily have advice or experiences relevant to you.    Chalice
B6zl0AJDaa	I found LOTS of links for it and here's one that describes it's use as far back as 400 B.C. for women.  Some articles I found said that it's been tried on horses with cushings.    http://www.emeraldvalleyequine.com/discl...|`|IMPvzBk1aa	I'll find you some links on it.  I found nothing worth posting on this. There is not much in the way of studies other than its use in treating Cushings in horses. There have been many studies on that, but still not FDA regulated.  I didn't even find product-sponsored studies into its use for reducing stud behavior.  All information relates to its use in female humans, or to its use in equine Cushings. Side effects, as far as they are reported, seem to be minimal, and not what you are describing.  I found nothing that supports its efficacy in reducing stud behavior, and nothing that explains your horse's reaction.  I would stop giving it if this were my horse, and if there is a question of hormone levels, have the vet perform bloodwork to measure his levels.|`|y7H1V39Jaa	By whom were you advised, a vet?  Was testosterone level taken?  Is the reason that you are giving this to him is to keep him from acting like a stallion?  If you could give us more details, it sure would help.|`|5kUxkun3aa	I couldn't find anything to say yes or no to  about it either.  I would get a vet to do more tests on your horse. Was he cut late on,is he a rig?
h4xcrlUuaa	try hand feeding him with tweesers. give him more options like wax worms and meal worms. i had the same issue and i took him to the vet. he was "backed up". try and switch back to smaller crickets. if that doesnt work dip your finger in olive oil and put it on his lips so he will lick it off. that may help him digest it easier. :)|`|LJ9hyvg2aa	Your leo sounds ok if he has a fat tail. Dont feed him any wax worms. That's not necessary. Just raise the temp a little and make sure he has plenty of tummy heat.|`|9GMePSopaa	I'm having the exact same problem!  I hope this can get me some answers :(|`|pf21XfB7aa	My gecko doesnt eat much either.  The gecko is ok they just eat when they are hungry.

The Vet told me it was normal after deworming. If it lasts more that a day or two, I would recommend calling your vet. Make sure you give your dog plenty of water to help flush out its system.|`|IdSqunZuaa	Yeah, that's just normal. There's nothing to worry about. Just continue observing your puppy. Another thing, make sure that your puppy gets the right nutrition. Here are some guidelines on feeding, http://dogtime.com/feeding-puppies.html
8i90ov0Gaa	It depends on where you buy them. I know many pet stores around here charge two dollars each for pinky mice, which I pay 18 cents a piece for. I pay 52 cents for adult mice, and I don't even want to know what they go for in pet stores! I buy from the following place, which is local for me so I don't deal with shipping: http://bigcheeserodents.com
OA7cPgGNaa	As your puppy matures into an adult (most dogs are considered puppies until age 2) it is likely the pecking order will change.     When dogs are around puppies, they treat them differently. Once they start to mature, the puppy code of conduct changes. The puppy likes to test their boundaries, as would a small child with their parents and siblings.     Treating them the same in every aspect is important right now. For example, make them all sit and HOLD their sit until you place their food down. Make them all sit before opening a door and having them WAIT until you release them. If one dog is allowed on a bed/couch, the others must be allowed to.     If one dog is playing with a toy, do NOT let another one take this toy. You need to be the alpha. They don't need to be fighting for spot  1 and spot  2. YOU are in spot  1 first and foremost.    Some fighting is expected, as females can get moody. A little growl here and there is fine, but you should correct this with a firm, sharp AH AH. This is not acceptable and they need to learn this.    Do not ever scream, hit, kick, or yell at your dogs. This will only make them take out their aggression on each other more.    Eventually they will get over this as Gracie matures.     But yes, you need to be the sole alpha. You need to:  -Make them all sit before feedings, water, treats, etc. YOU give commands to say it is OK to eat.  -Make them all sit when putting on a leash, YOU give command to say OK to release them from a sit  -Make them all sit when opening a door. They must remain seated while the door is being opened. YOU must give them the release command to say it is ok to go outside. If one of the dogs breaks the sit when you are opening the door, quickly close it and start over again.    This will take patience on your behalf, but your dogs will keep this fighting up until YOU become the alpha and YOU decide the pecking order.|`|AA12083992	Yes, that is no doubt what they are fighting about. The young one wants to take over. You do not decide the pecking order, the dogs do.  It's good they understand you are in charge but they still will try to determine who will be top dog now. Surprisingly, it may not end up being the young one. The older girl may just put her in her place.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	First, you have been reading the wrong books. You should NEVER let two dogs fight it out. The only result will be a whopping Vet bill. VERY bad advise.    Corgi females are notorious for being alpha b*thces. She is quite sure she should be the one in charge and will continue to behave that way unless you make some changes. I assume all dogs are neutered? If not, start with that.     I would try a dog behaviorist (who has the good sense not to tell you to let the dogs fight it out) who may be able to help with working out the pecking order.  http://www.apdt.com/  http://www.nadoi.org/index.htm    If this doesn't work, and I am very serious about this, you may need to keep them separated for their own safety. Corgi females can be extremely assertive for their size, and simply won't back down. Trust me, a Corgi b*tch fight is one of the scariest things you will ever witness.|`|1c74cc7ee9876780e94d288d920e0d0aaa	Had a similar problem with two of my dogs, the puppy wanted to be top dog.  We are still teaching him we are top, not him.  Also, he is getting neutered tomorrow!  We have been doing the crate,rotate system for aver a month now, but it beats having another fight .|`|1399ad3bbdc56a8d68fc6ce5430a21ffaa	You've got two bitches- they are going to fight.  The pecking order can change constantly, and it is up to YOU to remain on top, no matter what changes between the two who are fighting.      Your best bet would be seeking out professional help with this.  If you don't fix it now, it is only going to get worse.    Corgis are a herding breed- and for that matter, they herd cattle.  You've got a tough as nails female who is never going to back down unless you have a professional help you step in.|`|frUqL8L7aa	You need to let this little madam know that YOU and you alone are the alpha in the home. This behaviour would never be tolerated in the pack so you must let her know she is in the wrong any time she attacks the older dog. She might be fighting for top place in the canine pack and it might not be long till shes doing it with the human pack. There should never be two packs in a household anyway. Only one. Look for signs of her attacking before it actually happens and if your not comfortable getting her on her side and submitting to the older dog then lock her away for a bit until she calms then let her back in. Continue this until she sees this behaviour is not on!|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Absolutely and it will every time you bring in a new dog and as dogs age and mature.
8i90ov0Gaa	Honestly, I see no real problem or reason to call a vet. It is not uncommon for snakes to ingest pieces of substrate  that get stuck to their food. It is not a reason to panic like the previous answers would have you believing. Snakes have one of the strongest digestive systems of any animal. Although impaction can happen in lizards, I have never heard of it happening in snakes. As for being in his hide, this is what snakes do after they eat, and also if they're getting ready for a shed. If he defecates like normal and eats the next time you offer food, there is absolutely no problem.|`|B5kUQd3Gaa	It's normal, just leave it.|`|5919d59a9a07aac4e14c50ba4d7d46b9aa	ASK YOUR VET|`|edaWSMFJaa	Call a vet immediately. You should always consult the professional when something serious like this happens. ANYONE can answer on yahoo answers and give you information that could be lifethreating to your animal.    Like I stated before-call your vet.
YVen9Hdkaa	It's called Lick Granuloma.  And yes, it's a doggie OCD.<br>  <br>  It can start from a bug bite, or itchy skin, or stress, or whatever.  Sometimes they lick themselves to comfort themself.  At some point it turnes into OCD, and they just can't stop.  But it has to be stopped, because it can get worse.  A lot worse.<br>  <br>  Scolding or punishing just makes it even worse.  They become upset because they think they made you mad, so they lick the spot even more trying to comfort themself.  It's a viscious cycle.<br>  <br>  Research all the options.  Immediate Vet care and medications are going to be essential.  It's a slow process, but it can be helped.  You need a lot of patience and determination that you're going to help your dog through this.  And other family members need to understand what it is, and not be trying punish her to undermine your treatment<br>  <br>  There's a chapter about it in the book "The Dog Who Loved Too Much".<br>  <br>  Good luck with your little sweetie!|`|nd30LQhlaa	my chihuahua did this..its because the dog is having an allergy attack..my dog stopped even though she look horrible...but you may want to see a vet for meds...good luck!|`|II5N7XYKaa	You answered your own question:  It's red and inflamed.|`|Kt0qVNZOaa	Aw poor doggie.  It could be allergies. Check her food.  Try changing it.|`|8FdOfT11aa	I had a dog that did this once.  I was told to gently wash the area with soap and water, dry it off, and to put on some Neosporin.  That seemed to clear it up.  Her fur grew back in a month or so.  I'm still not sure what it was that bothered her.  Could have been a bug bite or maybe she wasn't used to the Florida heat...who knows?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  If nothing seems to help, take her to the vet.|`|NzOSFfojaa	She could have an irritation...you should ask your vet. There are also online vets available. :)|`|9G03aQhsaa	Some dogs just get compulsive about things, doggy OCD.  There could be something wrong though, maybe an irritant or a minor injury, not enough to make her limp but just cause some discomfort. Try cleaning and bandaging the spot.  If she pulls the bandage off and keeps licking it, you may want to get one of those cone collars to make it impossible for her to lick the spot.  I think you can get one at Petsmart.  If she keeps trying to lick it or seems to be favoring the paw, take her to the vet.|`|9093de6692223005aee5cc23526be087aa	Allergies!!!! Talk to your vet.!
L0mVDp5Yaa	has she been with a buck?<br>  <br>  oh it was 4 days ago...how is she now?
3LXbUg1raa	2nd Cutting is usually the better quality...It also depends on other factors too, though...such as how much rain was received and if the hay was rained on while it lay and if it did how long did it take to dry so it could be baled or was it baled wet?  Insects?  How was the hay stored?  How much nutrients were in the soil and how well did the hay grow/turn out? When was the hay cut?  Did the grass head out before it was cut? Was it cut too early? Etc... <br>  <br>  Normally, 2nd cutting is better, but it is dependent on many other factors so the hay will still need to be looked at on an individual basis.  The best hay will be fresh almost cinnamony in smell, no dust, no mold, good color, thin/small stems with lots of leaves, no seed heads or flowers...And you shouldn't have a problem with grass hay being too rich, either.<br>  <br>  <br>  ~Oh, and it also depends some on what types of grasses are in the hay...|`|fc5e4f4741642787d64f7d84cccb7b94aa	2nd crop is preferred usually for healthy non foundering/cushing horses. 1st cutting for those problems.  This is for east coast and midwest hay.<br>  I know people love alfalfa but that is to rich for all horses unless given as a treat.  Studies have been done that prove it has a harder time leaving the digestive tract and some never leaves.  It also produces to much sugar which can lead to foundering and cushings.<br>  A timothy grass mix, A timothy orchard mix or just grass mixes usually don't cause to many problems.<br>  Every field is different and if weed control is not done than even a second cutting will not give enough nutrition to the horse.  If the hay is not dusty, moldy (get your hand in the center of the bale) or weedy (weeds, sticks, gross stuff) your horse should like it.<br>  My horses do not like thick stemmed hay no matter what type it is.<br>  Kath|`|I55JNnvpaa	Everyone has their opinions, but I prefer alfalfa. It provides warmth in the winter from the energy it provides. At night I feed 1 flake of Alfalfa, and 1 flake oat in the mornings|`|MUfMJYHGaa	On average second crop is fine. The yellow dusty hay was left in field too long or stored for a long time without cover. But he ate it and lived so it was probably ok.|`|C68dKT0Saa	sorry this dosent really answer your question, but try pea hay its green and got the odd pea (obviously) its apparently nice and sweet!|`|AA12048299	Agree with Jackz. But I'll add, the only way to be sure of *any* hay's nutritional value is to  have a sample sent off to a local Ag Co-op, or university for nutrient testing. <br>  <br>  Ask your vet how to procede.
HvbIE03saa	Probably because they're considered "exotic".<br>  <br>  Much like ferrets, sugar gliders, etc...I think it's a load of crap though. Stupid politicians. You could still probably get away with owning one though...there are plenty of people who own ferrets in California even though they're illegal. You just have to go to a bordering state that has them for adoption or sale and get one.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Kouneli - gerbils are not illegal in California. You can find them at ANY pet store or PetCo.<br>  <br>  Dr. Doolittle - I have a hard time believing that if Animal Control found out you had an illegal exotic that they would put it down. Most of what I've seen is that they would take control of the animal and find a shelter/zoo/etc. that would be able to take the animal in.<br>  <br>  Lady - I agree. I know quite a few people here in Cali that have ferrets and they are able to take them to the vet all the time because the vets also recognize that calling an animal like a ferret (an animal that basically could no longer survive in the wild without human aid anymore) exotic is ridiculous. As long as you don't have something that is really exotic like a chimp or tiger or something, most vets are cool.<br>  <br>  And hell, you can go to petsmart/petco and find ferret food, toys, bedding, etc...so they're clearly not that strict on it.|`|nHp8zzkjaa	They are illegal in cali because the gov. believes that if they escape they well kill native animals and cali. does not believe in letting people keep exotic pets... we had one brought into the wildlife center and if it weren't for the Oakland zoo taking him we were going to have to put him to sleep (which i am totally against) so please don't get one because if ur caught it will cost the life of your pet.|`|Ro4H1kT8aa	dunno coz there idiots....or coz the hedgehogs dig holes|`|pGSfFI6aaa	I have no idea, but just get one. Its not like they are gonna come hunt you down.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	My guess is that the same idiots who made ferrets and gerbils illegal decided to make up another law that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Just the fact that they have nothing better to do.|`|AA10129150	California is funny about their exotic animals. If you purchase one out of state and bring one in you will probably be able to still take it to the vet if you need to. You should look into your local vet first and see how they are about these semi-exotic animals. One of the issues is that they don't want the animals go get out and start breeding in the wild and fight with the natural species, but with all the feral cats they probably wouldn't last very long anyway.

The newspaper, the washington post if I'm not mistaken, claims it was meant to portray his bail out reform thing or whatever, sorry, wasn't watching that cclosely: P<br>  Anywho, they apologized for peoples "misconceptions and misunderstandings", as it was not meant to be related to him, only his policy or whatever.<br>  They offered no apology to the people "who are using this as a vehicle to settle long term vendettas"<br>  I'm pparaphrasingof course.<br>  I think that  people sort of took the picture as too close to a derogatory pharse I will not repeat but refers to African Americans and monkey's.  <br>  But it's a very political newspaperand they're constantlly pushing the envelope.  Attacking the first Black Presidant so soon and in such a way was probablly not the smartest thing if they wanted to avoid conflict.<br>  However, we are all talking about it aren't we?  So they did succed in getting more attention ou of all this.|`|AA10129150	I saw the cartoon, and I didn't understand the point of it. Either it was about how the stimulus was written by monkeys (possibly supported by monkeys) or about how police have to shoot out of control animals, and the stimulus message had nothing to do with anything else. The artist won't explain the cartoon so I guess we all have to guess what it means.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Believe it or not, Obama is black. As are chimps. And the artist most likely considers Obama a less-than-adequate president, like a monkey is running the country. (Yes, I know, chimpanzees aren't monkeys, but that's not the important part.) It's meant to be insulting, and I personally consider it degrading, racist and insensitive.<br>  <br>  While I do think it's pretty nasty to parody such a recent unfortunate incident (I feel bad for both the owner and the chimp), I don't think it's so terrible. I mean, it's not like the animals are being offended by the comic. That doesn't necessarily make it okay, but I do place the focus on the insult to Obama.|`|XI2iylR4aa	Here's an article with a picture:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jlBBpB0_XF-eJt6GGtXCSl5bfV1AD96F9ONO0" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/arti...</a><br>  <br>  It was very poor judgment, on many levels.  I don't think anything about the chimp attack was funny.  <br>  <br>  I don't believe that the cartoonist meant it as a racial thing, they just wanted to comment on the stimulus thing being "out of control." But uh, duh, what were they thinking? It is not at all a stretch to see this as an EXTREMELY offensive, racially charged cartoon.   <br>  <br>  If it was an honest accident then there are a lot of oblivious/inept editors over at the NY Post.  If not, I don't even know what to say.  Maybe I just prefer to give them the benefit of the doubt, because if the racial connotation was intentional, it would be too upsetting to deal with.<br>  <br>  The whole thing was in poor taste, that's for sure.|`|AA10048946	I fail to "connect the dots" on this one.

Are some of us really blind or are those offended by it making an issue out of something that actually isn't there?|`|peQIh3Pgaa	I'm sure it wasn't meant to be racist at all!  Who said the chimp was Obama and why are people who are "offended" so racist to automatically assume that a chimp would mean a black person?

QLrk3ep9aa	You want to get a dog shampoo. Honestly, with something like shampoo, price is an indication of quality. Get a good quality dog shampoo. Human soaps have harmful chemicals.<br>  <br>  Also, you shouldn't bathe your dog more then once a month, especially a longer haired breed like cocker spaniels. Too much washing will strip the hair of natural oils, and cause dryness and breakage|`|OPOBIzqMaa	Either way, you should purchase a dog shampoo because some human shampoos are harmful to animals (although I hear that dawn dish liquid works well on animals...I have never tried it.)

Most owners opt to have a professional groomer bathe, brush, and trim their dogs' coats every six to eight weeks, and prices are high for this time-intensive breed.

OAzJPUkHaa	Your temperature and humidity are a tad low.  Increase it to 75Fahrenheit/percent for the overall health, and activeness of the crabs(the temperature and humidity should be around 75-80).  If you use the light bulb as heat, try going the next size up until you hit good temperature and perhaps buying a second light source(it's cheap at a home improvement store, just ask for chicken brooding lights) for a more even distribution of heat.  If your using a UTH as the main heat source, your substrate is probably too deep for it to work effectively.  If you don't have a moss pit already, get one to increase your humidity.  Moistening your substrate more often may help, as will wrapping something like Glad Press and Seal to the lid if it's mesh.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, to answer the question.  Aside from the temperature and humidity(fortunately, it's easy to fix :) ), you seem to be doing everything fine.  The crabs will molt when ready, so don't fret yourself.|`|iB22RWkGaa	They'll molt when they're ready.

veDvtYhJaa	I don't feed Taste of the Wild, so I don't know what the instructions are on the side of the bag.  It's an excellent food.  But, as with all dog foods, I go by what it instructs on the bag.  <br>  <br>  Look on the bag for instructions on how much to feed her at each of two meals a day.  The amount is determined by her weight.  <br>  BUT<br>  She's a large breed dog, and she's in her rapid growth period.... so she may need more than what it says because she's not trying to maintain that weight... she needs enough to continue growing.  <br>  <br>  So, feed what it states on the bag for breakfast and for supper, and then offer her a dish with a partial serving midway between those two meals.  By the time she's 7 to 9 months old, she probably won't need the added meal, but she probably does right now. <br>  <br>  You should be seeing your vet again for rabies or something, so ask your vet to show you how to tell if she's a good weight.  You can look at her body and feel her spine and ribs to tell if she's underweight, just right or overweight.  It's hard to describe over the phone, so it's best to do this during one of the routine puppy visits. If I can remember the website that discusses this, I'll post a link.<br>  <br>  As for the routine, since you have one who's willing to eat the food of the other dogs, you need to change your feeding routine to controlled feedings, where all dogs are fed at the same time, somewhat separated from each other, and after 20-30min, their dishes are put up where none can reach.  This way you are right there to make sure she doesn't go get anything from someone else's bowl. <br>  <br>  Actually, although she's got St.B and Pyr in her, if she's ONLY 23.5# at 5 months, then she's either a really slender dog, or she's a small dog for the breeds involved.  A St.B or a Pyr at 5mo would normally weigh close to 50#.<br>  <br>  My dogs are 6, 5 1/2 and 5, but I have to change my routine periodically as their needs vary from season to season, and according to who's on a diet. <br>  <br>  You're invited to join a pyr group for more support.  I'll post the link below. -!-|`|53oR82lgaa	I work for a vet and i would say feed him 4 cups a day 2 times a day.|`|LGpv2grIaa	A puppy eats a lot of food. From birth up to six months of age, he'll need to eat two to four times as much as an adult dog to support all that growth. A good rule of thumb (paw?) is that after his first week of life, when his weight doubles from what it was at birth, a puppy should gain one to two grams per pound of anticipated adult weight each day. This means that if your German Shepherd puppy weighs 75 pounds as an adult, he should gain three to five ounces per day as a puppy.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Depends on the weight and activity of the dog.

Every fish needs oxygen, and plenty of it. They don't get big (about 3" body length), and on average, they cost about $3 or $4.|`|kUYRnmRRaa	A betta fish needs no oxygen in the water, since it actually gets its O2 from the surface (watch one for a while and you'll notice it takes frequent trips to the surface for a "breath", unlike most other fish).

They're about $4 at the pet store, and one of the hardiest and easiest fish to care for.<br>  <br>  Other hardy fish are white clouds and danios, if you want to try caring for a school, but they need more space than a betta fish, at least 10 gallons for a school of five or so.|`|ufKp4Z9Uaa	what your looking for is a toy fish

The vet will tell you how to clean it. <br>  <br>  Or you can go to a pet store and browse through their dozens of products for cleaning a dog's ears.

X2FrjG8Laa	hi baby i got 2 points|`|zdBInQReaa	Yes, there are dog microchips! They are very efficient and are good for smaller dogs, but large dogs can use them too. But I would have a collar too, because if your dog ever gets loose... most people don't have a microchip detector in their house and most people don't think to take it to the vet or shelter to have it scanned. In case the dog gets stolen.. I don't  know what could help you there.... as your vet or shelter for andy ideas. But the idea of someone stealing you dog is highly unlikely, I just could not imagine it happening!|`|8FdOfT11aa	Yes, there are microchips available for dogs (and cats and perhaps a few other animals).  But, the only way the chip works is if the animal is taken to a shelter or vet that can scan the microchip.  If some random person finds your dog on the street without a collar, they may or may not take him to be scanned and returned to you.  SO, even if you do get your pet microchipped, I personally would not let it go without its collar.  If someone from down the street finds her and sees that the animal's owner lives nearby, it's a lot easier to walk the dog back to your place than to cart it all around town.|`|oqLqPwsJaa	Yes there is. I just had my puppy done last thrusday. What they do is they put a chip in behind the neck, its the size of a grain or rice. The company that my vet is with is called Avid. Then there is a fee to register the dog. It is a life time membership and it is only $18.50 with the company that my vet uses. I dont know if there are different prices with other companies. To have it done was only $40.00. So its well worth it. I hope this helped you out. =]|`|0diOaNoxaa	It seems like you're asking about GPS, so you can actually track your dog if it gets lost or stolen.

Most are fairly inexpensive to get put in and maintain.  Good way to trace a dog if it is lost.  Obviously the dog will have to be 'scanned' and then the chip read, you will be listed as the Owner.  That is how it works|`|OPOBIzqMaa	Yes, they are inserted into the back of the neck with a needle.

I lost my best dog ever, last year, when either my wife or I accidentally left one of the fence gates in the back yard ajar, and the younger dogs discovered it and took off for a romp in the woods.  Our German Shepherd, however, was much older, and had developed hip problems, and couldn't keep up with the younger ones, and so, somehow he was unable to return home.  I'll share with you our painful discovery of him, or his corpse shall I say, on the side of our little highway, not far from our house, with buzzards all over him, and by the time I was able to get back to him, only minutes later, the buzzards were gone, and all that was left were his bare bones and skull, and the dog tag, which I just HAD to take off the corpse and bring home.  We could never discern just how he died, or, whether he was dead when the buzzards got to him, or  was only injured or incapacitated because of his arthritic hips.  I hurt every time I think of it, and I, too, chastise myself for not being more careful about the fence gates.  They had gotten out before and they all, including the German Shepherd, had returned safely.  And we had just built a brand new  home out in the country, and fenced in a BIG back yard for them, and took excellent care of them, but, dogs-will-be-dogs, and, given an open fence gate, will take off like they were breaking out of prison, just to go for a romp.  But that time it cost the life of my all-time favorite dog, and hopefully he was completely dead before the buzzards got to him.  I shudder at the thought of him being even partially alive when the buzzards came to eat him.  But, if you'd like, I can share with you something I've learned over the years, and maybe my "advanced years" have some wisdom that might help you here.  You can be the absolute best dog owner on the planet earth, and still there's the chance your dog's going to  meet an accidental death which you simply cannot protect them from.  There are just some things, a LOT of things actually, in life that you CANNOT control, and accidents are in that category.  So, as pained as I am in losing my most favorite dog ever, I know that life just has it's bad spots, and as good a pet owner as I like to think I am, there's just some things I cannot prevent, even if something I or my wife did may have initiated the cause of our dog's death.  And so, you "have to go on" as the saying goes, and when I go out to feed our remaining dogs, I know that my German Shepherd wouldn't want my grieving to lessen the quality of love and care I give to our remaining three dogs, and so, in his memory, and in knowing what he'd want, I continue to take the best of care of our remaining three dogs, who are wonderful in their own right.  You may never lose the pain of feeling somewhat responsible for the death of your dog, or maybe it will lessen over time, unless you dwell on it, but remember, you're not God, and so there's sometimes you'll make mistakes, and sometimes those mistakes will cost you, but the clock keeps on ticking, and life keeps on going, and everyone still wants you here with us as an ever growing, ever maturing young adult, to become one of our society's strong ones as time goes on.  And I'm sure you've found out by now, maturity doesn't come free, and it doesn't come painlessly.  God Bless you, young lady.|`|3p3otDlXaa	Try not to let it happen again.

KeevlZnTaa	I going to be blunt and straight to the point... You are not feeding them properly. Sugar gliders need very specific nutrition, and you cannot make it up as you go. Without proper nutrition you are going to cause health problems, a common glider illness is metabolic bone disease, and it is a result of improper feeding.<br>  <br>  The feeding requirements of a sugar glider are somewhat controversial. It is only recently they have been kept as pets, and needs are somewhat of a mystery. As time goes on people will learn more about the needs of these little creatures. Sugar gliders are omnivorous, meaning they will eat plant material and meat. In the wild they feed from nectar, fruit, insects and even small birds, eggs or rodents. This diet is pretty hard to replicate in captivity. People feed them a variety of foods trying to mimic their natural diet as best they can. Some people feed insects such as crickets, meal worms, wax worms, moths and spiders. The insects should be fed high quality food such as commercial cricket food, and dusted with a complete vitamin/mineral supplement. Hence their name, the sugar glider loves the taste of sugar. They like fruit cocktail. The fruit should be fed in small amounts, chopped together so the gliders can not just pick out their favorites. There are many different diets that can be fed. These diets cannot be mixed and match and must be fed according to directions. Incorrect diet can cause serious health issues. Some diets you may want to research<br>  BML, Taronga Zoo Diet, Chicago Zoological Park Alternative Diet , Darcy's Sugar Glider Diet , Elwin's Fresh Food Diet, Priscilla Price's Sugar Glider Diet, Suncoast Glider Diet Plan, etc(there are a few more to this list)<br>  <br>  I personally like the BML diet, it was fairly easy to put together, and the recipes made enough food to last about a month. Choose the diet that works best for you, but please choose one proper diet.<br>  <br>  At this point I would just keep them in the pouch. Allow them to choose when you can touch them. You want to build trust, and grabbing them to put them in a pouch will not do that. Most people get a small tent(so the gliders are in a secure area), and also bond that way. In a tent they will be able to get used to being without outside of the pouch. It will allow them to see that you are not a threat. Bonding can take anywhere from a week to months(depending on the glider). Take you time and don't rush it, your gliders will eventually get used to you.|`|WFzt2fHOaa	There are some really cool videos on expert village!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.expertvillage.com/search.htm?s=sugar+gliders" rel="nofollow">http://www.expertvillage.com/search.htm?...</a>

If the rabbit is not consuming anything it may be hurt or in a state of shock. Release it into a wooded area, turn it into the local SPCA, or turn it into any veterinary office. When you turn animals over to animal hospitals, you relinquish all contact with the animal for the duration of its stay there.|`|LaiANzeAaa	wild animals don't aprieciate your kindness (crude but true!) most likely its not eating because the poor guy is stressed out of its mind.

wStPZeEEaa	okay first off may i just say good for you for bringing the dog inside at nighttime because most people dont do that.......anyways when my dog was still learning to go outside, when she'd go id start saying good girl!!!! and start clapping my hands and maybe when we go inside id get her a treat but make sure your always happy whatever it does and remember words are better then actions meaning if it forgets to let you know it needs to go outside Dont hit it just say nooooo dont pee in the house!!! but dont ever hit it! and maybe get some paper to put on the floor just when your not around to let it outside then it can just pee on the paper and you can just clean it up|`|9G03aQhsaa	Get Some old newspapers or better yet "weewee pads"  sounds a little gross, but next time he has an accident, when you clean it up, put a little on the pad and leave it there, this will show him that that is the place to "go" when he is in the  house at night.  Also, try taking him out right before you go to bed, and getting up about 3 hours later to check on him and take him out again.  Then again three hours later.  You'll lose a little sleep, but as he gets older he will be able to hold it longer.  If you don't want to get up at night, just do the pad thing.  Since he spends a lot of time outdoors anyway he already knows about "going" there.|`|iQN5KGaTaa	congrats on the lab.

giQKWV3Raa	As a breeder of Cane Corsos I can say with 100% confidence that your dog IS a Cane Corso. It is definitly not a presa nor a boerboel. I believe from the pictures that you provided that your dog is a purebred. <br>  <br>  Congratulations! He is a great looking boy and Canes are a fantastic breed.|`|26PPwzrWaa	Based on this he definitely has some cane corse in there: <a href="http://www.sovranacanecorso.com/sabfront8.18.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.sovranacanecorso.com/sabfront...</a><br>  <br>  And possibly Boerboel as well. He could just be a byb/mill production of a cane corso. Which would be the only reason he would've ended up in the shelter. <br>  <br>  What ever he is, he is gorgeous. <br>  <br>  Here is a forum that may be able to help you more: <a href="http://www.bigdogsporch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigdogsporch.com</a> <br>  (It is a forum for large and giant breed owners and there are a few cane corsos and boerboels on there).|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	I don't think he looks *precisely* like a Cane Corso, Presa Canario or Boerboel. He may be any of the three, and simply be a less-than-stellar example of the breed. Or, he may very well be a mix, considering he was just found as a stray. However, he does resemble a Cane Corso quite well, so if I were you, I wouldn't feel too crazy calling him such.|`|dl1OOOT8aa	He looks like a cane corso BUT here in the U.S. it is not uncommon for byb's to mix all the different mastiffs together. Nevertheless he's a great looking dog and a lucky find at a shelter. Presas aren't supposed to have their tail docked as well, this would be a serious disqualification but who knows what byb do. <br>  <br>  Somethings to note: One very distinctive character of the presa is it's back, the croup is higher than the withers (the rear is higher than the shoulders) and it has a shorter neck than a cane.|`|53oR82lgaa	I would say that he is a cane, but he may not be full thats y he looks like the others as well

It is possible that a human can die of fright, so it is possible for animal to die of fright.|`|0f3fde633bd5c269a5dc7fc600702cccaa	If you kitty had an underlying medical condition that no one was aware of it is possible the stress could have caused him to die.  A very common problem in cats is cardiomyopathy.  It is a condition you wouldn't know your cat had unless he had a cardiac ultrasound.  If that was the case it is conceivable that the stress could have caused him to have a cardiac event that could have killed him.  The vet should have offered to do a necropsy for free.  If they didn't I would be asking why.<br>  Sometimes the first symptom of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is sudden death.|`|zW5OWgXtaa	Well that is something new, I don't think that really happen, was your cats hair white? Becuase usually when someone gets so scared to death their hair turns white. If he got scared he would have scratched and bite really hard and ran. One time my dad droped and egg on my cats head on accident and he screamed and ran so fast. I think he was thinking his brain exploaded. lol it was funny though bcuz it was only an egg. But i do think the vet is lieing, don't go there again, go to a different vet.<br>  <br>  I would sue that place. That can't happen like that, unless your cat was like really old.|`|y9a8cfusaa	A cat can be so shocked it dies that happend to my cat a car went by and it shicked her so much she couldnt walk move eat drink i took her to the vet and the vet said she was going to die bc she got so shocked|`|IRaIxWJKaa	No they would not.

You do NEED to take this dog to the vet. She needs a good exam and she needs x-rays. If you intend to keep this dog then it becomes your responsability to care for her and this includes appropriate medical care. If you can't or don't want the responsability of vet care then I suggest you surrender her to the shelter or rehome her with someone who can/will give her the appropriate care.<br>  Owning a dog is a responsability.|`|SnAsZapMaa	No, nothing there suggests HD.<br>  <br>  If you can't afford vet care you can't afford a dog.<br>  You certainly can't treat her problem yourself.<br>  <br>  Your description has elements of Locomotor Ataxia aka Chorea aka "Cerebellar Cortical and Extrapyramidal Nuclear Abiotrophy", but that disease usually develops at about 11 weeks old.<br>  <br>  Myelopathy is a possibility, it tending to be recognised at 3-8 months old.

Possible an inner ear infection, or an old injury to the head and/or ears. Dysplasia does not cause this. Think of dysplasia like arthritis. It causes them to walk very stiffly, and have sever pain while walking. They will have trouble getting up, or can not get up at all. A dog with joint problems or dysplasia will not walk around with floppy legs. They will be exactly the opposite. They will appear lame and limp. Besides, 9 months is a little young, and dysplasia would not affect the head.<br>  You need to get her to the vet. It is some kind of neurological issue, and needs to be seen. Something as simply as medication could fix it. If you can not provide it, find a german shepherd rescue in your area that you can surrender her to, and they will provide medical care. I know it sucks, but it is ILLEGAL to withhold medical care from your pet (it is animal abuse), and this is not fair to her|`|8FdOfT11aa	I'll just reiterate what many others have already said.  She needs to see a vet.  If you cannot afford a vet, find a rescue, or give her to the SPCA.  I know it sucks having to give up your dog, but you have to think about her.  Does she deserve to feel like this?<br>  <br>  Again, like others have said, call around for a vet that can take payment plans.  Sometimes, a vet will be more interested in an animals well-being than in the money and they can work with you.<br>  <br>  Also, look into CareCredit.  My vet told me about it.  It's a credit card that you can use only for medical purposes (including veterinary).|`|53oR82lgaa	That sounds like she might be having seizeres, or shes has had one and now has problems controling her movements.

FvAl3UgQaa	I actually don't think you need that many years of experience (as stated by the previous answerer) since I certainly didn't have that much , BUT what you do need, which many people don't realise, is separate accommodation for the male and females - only introducing them for breeding purposes - and a thorough understanding of the responsibility involved in finding good homes for the offspring. You should also only  breed from particularly good parents (i.e. you know they will produce healthy, vigorous offspring) rather than wanting to breed for breeding's sake, even if the parents are nothing special...|`|8opg5OSQaa	When you breed them I will buy a CB09 or two.<br>  <br>  It is easy to breed them buy it is expensive|`|wLgGD63raa	I would not suggest breeding your leopard geckos.
