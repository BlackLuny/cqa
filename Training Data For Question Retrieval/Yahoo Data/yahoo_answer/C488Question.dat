Meine Termine widerum hab ich im Kopf, ich brauche keinen Kalender.

20070512223016AA0MaAM	Health;Women's Health	Anyone with interstitial cystitis, IC?	I had a cystoscopy about a year ago, after six months of undiagnosed painful urination. Dr. said exam was "inconclusive" for IC--can't confirm the diagnosis, can't rule it out either.   Symptoms have remained pretty constant for the year since then, not better, not worse, I can diminish the pain considerably by avoiding acidic foods and drinking gallons of water.   I'd like to ask people with IC: how long before the onset of symptoms and the time when it was possible to confirm a diagnosis?   Also, any thoughts about natural remedies, or ideas for something to drink other than water, would be much appreciated.   Thanks.

20070605233039AAtdhr3	Health;Men's Health	Do older men, like in they're 60's lose their sex drive after heart bypass surgery?	My Dad had surgery about 4 summers ago and apparently he's lost his, my Mother is always accusing my dad of cheating because he doesn't "do" anything with her since his surgery, when he was active before. I'm tired of hearing her accuse my dad of being unfaithful, I've always been close to my Dad. My dad is not that kind of a man, and furthermore, he'd never have that opportunity because he's always busy! He never rests, energizer bunny type. Works his butt off! I have addressed this to my dad and he says Mom is making excuses because of some things she's done to him, and he just doesn't feel the way he used to towards her, because of all her accusing and nagging all of the time, and he's tired of her insults. She's accused him of having thinsg to do with an ex co-worker to before and embarrased my Dad at a company party, as a result, he quit out of embarrasement. I think she's losing her mind! I think Dad is tired of being embarrased by her and her jealousy. What do you think?

Se ele pára, come?a a morrer! é uma ferramenta completa de trabalho que se adapta às mais variadas condi??es.   Claro que quando está cansado precisa de descanso para recuperar as for?as e quando está muito velho precisa ser substituído. Mas, estando sadio, se ficar parado muito tempo, os problemas de saúde aparecem.   A saúde é fundamental e com movimento do trabalho sem exagero, ela se mantém. Portanto é ilus?o pensar que ficar parado é bom. N?o é. Quem acha que n?o tem nada pra fazer, procure fazer o que gosta porque se ficar parado vai definhando.   Todo trabalho construtivo é louvável e n?o é por ser diferente do trabalho pesado que deixa de ser trabalho. Qualquer coisa que se coloca em prática é importante para movimentar o corpo. Até mesmo escrever.   Sem esquecer os outros cuidados que se deve ter com a saúde, quem menos pára, mais vive. E se o trabalho for para o bem de todos, melhor ainda!                              ASF

20081012060010AAWvcVx	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	What blood glucose level constitutes an emergency?	Ever since I was a young teen, I've struggled with PCOS with frequent bouts of hypoglycemia (that diet never could control)  and, now that I'm 43, it looks like this has finally crossed over to diabetes as my doctor predicted it would.  My blood sugar last night after a vegetarian dinner was 359.  I haven't eaten anything since, more than 12 hours, and it's still a whooping 258. So it's going down but very, very slowly.        My question is, at what level does high blood sugar become an emergency?  I think I can wait to call my doctor on Monday.  Tonight, I'll simply eat ultra low carb foods like green beans and mushrooms.      
20081021235356AA7ZEeA	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	My husband doesn't seem to care about my kidney damage?	I suffer from PCOS, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Recently, I learned that I have early kidney disease.   They ran a microalbumin test, which was over 112 (normal is below 30).  My doctor said that if the damage continues, I will have to have dialysis soon. I'm on Diovan HCT, which I've been on for a couple of years, but he also put me on Altace to slow down the damage caused from my high blood pressure.  It's not caused from my diabetes as it has been under control.  My Hemoglobin A1C tests are always normal.    This has been very upsetting. I've been depressed since I found out a couple of days ago.  Obviously, I'm probably going to end up on dialysis.  At the very least, my life span will probably be shorter than normal. If you have high blood pressure, insist that they do a kidney function test.  If they would have ran this test earlier and monitored my kidneys, this damage may have been prevented.     Anyway, what I can't understand is why my husband of 28 years whom I'm very close to and who's also an RN who used to work on a dialysis ward, is acting like this news is unimportant.  He said that I'm making much ado over nothing--that it's certainly not time to sell the farm yet.     I'm very hurt over his reaction. Does he just not care or is he unable to deal with the reality of the diagnosis?  Or maybe, since he's a nurse, he's used to distancing himself from such things.  I don't know, but I now feel like I can't talk to him about it. So on top of dealing with this diagnosis, I'm also having to deal with doubts about my husband's sincerity.  Any suggestions?  I don't know what to do.

I've never gotten it before, even when my lips have been VERY chapped!       It is a cut on the middle of my exterior lower lip    (location = visable when mouth is closed as well as open, but high enough so it can be hidden when i slightly curl my lips, so basically, on the outer-edge of the top of my lower lip and centered)      I have been using alot of chap stick!      sometimes, it feels fine, and feels as if it will heal soon, but later, for no reason, it will feel so bad and dry, it hurts to moove my lips even slightly      This has been going on for a few weeks, PLEASE is there ANY way to heal it so it isnt visable, and doesnt open when its dry?

Something Like:       tape edges of mouth to cheeks to put the lips tight, and put glob of neosporen on the crack, place a small peice of damp paper towel on it and repeat every night till its healed!

My 15 year old son is having a lot of problems in high school, mainly focusing and comprehending what it going on.  He just sits in class and does nothing.  He has always had focusing issues, but he is in danger of flunking 10th grade.  My ex-husband has a friend who is a doctor and suggested that we try Strattera.  I am worried of course, of the high rate of suicide thoughts.  I don't want to make it worse.  He does NOT get in any trouble at school, does not do drugs and is all around a good kid. But, he does absolutely nothing at home... to get him to do a mundane task (like putting his own dishes in the dishwasher) is like asking him to mow the back 40!  I know that some of this is teenage stuff, but I am worried about this drug.  Anyone out there have any experience with it?

I am drinking water and eating ok I think. I am still working out but I am not able to push myself that much. I only work out 3 times a week with at least one day in between workouts. It is a full body workout that takes about 1 hour. Anyone know what could be causing this.      Also, I haven't gained any weight in the last 3 months and my body fat percentage has stayed the same. Could these be related? Why am I not gaining weight?      Ryan

Das finde ich ziemlich heftig. Und dann steht in dem Schreiben auch noch, wenn ich bis zum 6.12 nicht zahle, kommt ein Vollstreckungsverfahren mit ggf. erheblichen Mahngebühren bzw. Gerichtskosten.

How do I know if I am? I'm too afraid to see a psychiatrist because I have to use my parent's insurance and they'll find out and I don't want them to, yet. I tried talking to a school counselor but I limited what I said and all I got was to join their thearpy sessions. I'm afraid that if I tell them everything they'll send me to a hospital.   A lot of people say that I'm starting to act real awkward lately and a lot more wild than I used to. I get frustrated very easily and I don't seem to enjoy the things I used to.    To top it off, has there been any connection between depression and violence? lately whenever I see someone I have a tendency to want to hurt them. Both verbally and physically. I haven't done it yet but I'm afraid sooner or later I'm going to lose it.    Any advice is appreciated.

20070115111057AAJqSzk	Health;Mental Health	How do you adjust to moving to a new city and taking a new job when its all very different?	I moved from the small town I grew up in to a big city for a job.  I live downtown now and have been here over 3 months.  I hate driving here and I'm literally scared to go places because its that confusing and I get lost easily.  My jobs a really good opportunity, but its my first professional job and its taking getting used to with wearing a suit every day and the pressure and formality of it.  I'm lonely, and I'm trying to make friends, and have actually made some but I still just miss my hometown and the family and friends that were there.  I don't want to quit and go back home until I can say I've stayed here at least a year.  And if I get used to being here there's more opportunity here than back home.  I did start going to a therapist and my doctor prescribed an anti-anxiety medication.  I also found a church up here I like.  So my question is what else can I do that would make this all easier (besides quitting and moving back home)?
