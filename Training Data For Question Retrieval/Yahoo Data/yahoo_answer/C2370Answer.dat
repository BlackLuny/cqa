68fd68c756ace3979820e8ad03d4237daa	There are tons of online programs. I personally attended American Intercontinental Univ. and Capella University, and teach for the University of Phoenix. All three are accredited and solid programs. Online courses tend to vary in price, so we could say they are more expensive, but that is relative. Of course they are more expensive than a community college, but less expensive than Harvard. The price range varies. <br>  <br>  The key is to find a program that is fully accredited. Is it worth it? YES. My career has boomed since my MBA at nearly 5 years ago. I am nearly finished my PhD through distance education, and I am at the job that I want. I know I wouldn’t be here without the education. If you are looking at work in the U.S., then you need a school that is accredited and recognized by the Dept of Ed. I can give more info on that later. <br>  <br>  You should market yourself and not the degree or university. There are many traditional universities offering degrees that can be earned through online methods. Look at that if you are truly concerned with the name of the school.

8a584bd26674f8336cbce595e12f64b1aa	1. The resurrection of Jesus is important to Christians because it proves to them that Jesus is not just an ordinary human being, he has miraculous powers just like the Bible promises. <br>  2. When Jesus was resurrected, he opened up the gates of Heaven for all Christians, which promises them a blissful afterlife. <br>  3. It also gives them hope that even in their toughest times, there is still a positive solution to their problems.<br>  4. When Jesus was dying on the cross, he was frightened and called out to his father for help. This proves that Jesus still had human emotions. It gives Christians reassurance that it is human nature to feel scared, as even Jesus himself had these emotions.<br>  5. The resurrection of Jesus is the most important story in the whole of the Bible. If Jesus hadn't resurrected, we would probably not be aware of his existence today. The resurrection of Jesus helped Christians all over the world to become aware of his amazing actions.|`|lObEjUh1aa	forgive me for sounding crude, but this question is a bit like asking "why is water important when boiling water?".<br>  <br>  the resurrection of jesus is the central theological axis around which all of christianity swings.  it is _the_ separation point between christianity and judaism.  you only asked for 5 reasons, but the reasons why that's important to christianity probably number in the hundreds.<br>  <br>  If Jesus was not resurrected, the theological consequence would be that Judaism is right and he is not the messiah -- this would essentially mean the collapse of the entire theological basis of the christian faith.  If you would like more specific reasons, perhaps the best thing to do would be to read a bit of the Wikipedia article:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianit...</a>
SHvkmpWwaa	The first semester in college is always the toughest!  Is there a group or club you can join that shares your interests?  Have you looked into a mentor program at your university? I'm sure they have one!  Consider that no matter what college you select, your problems would probably be the same.<br>  <br>  I went to a school where I knew no one, but I joined a theatre group.  Theatre people are the most outgoing!  Another way to meet friends is to go to the library and see who else is hanging out there because they have no friends.  There are many people in your position, new to the school, etc. Don't give up!  You will move forward!|`|RlzkeY0gaa	I agree with most of the above suggestions, but as someone who actually respects the reason we all go to college ie. to become educated, the library is not the kind of place you want to go to start up random conversations with strangers. Many people go to the library to actually study rather than because they have no friends. What a silly idea! <br>  <br>  Why not talk to some of the people in your classes before or after>?|`|POAyvrizaa	sometimes schools arent perfect for the person but that doesnt mean that it has to be horrible! just go for it with people, maybe sit next to a group in a lecture or a class and just introduce yourself, dont worry about making yourself look like an idiot! just go for it! people will be much more friendly than you expect. if you're nervous about doing this, ask a question about the class that you're doing (even if you already know the answer) this could be a good way to start chatting. I had this same problem when i started uni, i was just too set with my old friends and it was bizarre being without them. don't worry though, i'm sure youll be fine!

Now, if you are a married student, this could be waived, or if you were a commuter.<br>  <br>  Some colleges have so many requests for on campus housing and not enough rooms, so they waive the requirement.<br>  <br>  Living on campus can be a lot of fun, you learn a lot about yourself, and it can also be very challenging or even stressful. I enjoyed my on campus time since I went to lunch or dinner with different people, went to the academic quad with different people at different times, and in general, didnt have to worry about things like who didnt pay the electric bill, who drank the last glass of OJ, or what to do when some other utility system went down. <br>  <br>  |`|dafae2ae3b86a68e315dfbc92b268dc5aa	Dorm  is  a  housing  option ,<br>  Not  mandatory .<br>  <br>  Most  American college  students  live  at  home   because  dorms<br>  and  other  housing  is  tooooo  expensive  for  a  student .<br>  <br>  >|`|G13DBUcUaa	It depends on how far away you live from the college.

Your answer depends on if they want it exact or rounded to a certain number of decimals.

AJKcB6UYaa	If you're a business or finance major it's a must. If it's your first accounting class, it's just the basics and requires just debiting and crediting a bunch of different accounts in financial statements. The second accounting course is a little more complex, but doable. If you're talking about acc 1, then the class is relatively easy (was for me) and you should be able to handle it even with 18 credits. If it's acc 2 and you have a strong understanding of accounting 1, it's still a bit more difficult, but you should be fine|`|VZ21gL81aa	If you are an accounting major, then by all means take it. if you are not an accounting major, then why put yourself through that?<br>  <br>  18 credits is not easy, and FinAcct is not an easy class.... lots of work.|`|a4f920fd6be64536039828f19bd58f14aa	No, I wouldn't recommend taking financial accounting as one of your classes especially with you taking 18 credits. Accounting is very time consuming plus you need more time to study the chapters and understand the concepts to get your assignments done. Exams are by far not so easy. In fact, I am taking Financial Accounting right now and I was taking 3 other classes (2 of them 8-weeks) a while back. I barely had the time to do my work for classroom participation and homework but luckily with the online practices I have been pulling my grade up which is helping me improve.|`|jtyWsiKvaa	It all depends on the university you go to. I'm in Financial Accounting right now and at my university it is a lower division class so it is not bad. If your Financial Accounting class is an upper division class though, it could be pretty time consuming. In general, it is not a super difficult class, but it is definitely one of those classes that you need to put some time and effort into. Either way, I think you could do it, as long as you are a hard working student and not a slacker :)
GCKo4aWhaa	Your SAT scores sound exactly like mine - I mean I think I scored a 640 in english and a 410 in math (over 20 years ago - don't quote me).  Math has always been a problem for me and I don't understand either.  I am extremely strong everywhere else (except where math was a basis, such as Physics).<br>  <br>  You will do fine - if your curriculum is anything like I had to go through you will probably have to accomplish the basic math course and then 3 -4 others.  I recommend taking them all back to back.  They build on each other and it will help keep it fresh in your mind.  I did not get math until I was in college so maybe I had sucky math teachers.|`|vxEWguqqaa	See I'm not as good in reading as I am in math. No one can learn different things at the same speed.

There are probably a lot of holes and things you've forgotten from basic math that you need to know with your current math.|`|3608GdQXaa	I think some people are just good at different things.  For example, I am great at math.  I always get A's in my math classes with ease.  However, I read so freakin' slow its ridiculous.  I dont think I actually finished one book in highschool or college.  I mostly used cliff notes because I could never finish reading in time for the assignments.  Im just a math person and not a reading person. We are all unique.<br>  <br>  EDIT: dont give up though.  It just will take more work to understand math for you, but nothing is impossible.|`|2HyVuI86aa	you have to take the time ti understand how the theories of maths work! dont just apply them without it|`|1188fbe348398bbf359d2045d72e7956aa	peoples brains are wired differently - natural aptitude may be a lot stronger in one discipline from the next. if there is a subject you struggle with you need to find the right teacher who can explain in terms you can process, and never be afraid to ask about stuff you don't understand, no matter how dumb you may feel at the time - if bill gates doesn't get something, he asks someone who nows the answer and can explain it to him.|`|0T6BnLgEaa	depends on your major - if you are majoring in something that is in the sciences, etc. then you will have a lot of math.

GYtW6i4vaa	My first semester sucked too. I had a hard time adjusting and it seemed like everybody made friends without me. I was seriously considering transferring, too, at the time. However I stuck it out and eventually made friends and now in my Junior year I love it here. Just try to be positive and friendly all the time and eventually you will click with a few people who will introduce you to even more people. And joining a couple organizations does help too. Even if only a few people go, you could involve yourself with making improving the club and making it something people WANT to be a part of. Also make sure you bathe regularly too. Some people at my school smell like wet dogs and that's why they have no friends. :)
2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	Academically, is the major in which you are interested offered there?  Are there others in your classes who are doing as well or better than you are?  If not, then maybe you aimed too low.  If so, then talk to a professor in your field to find out if things are expected to become tougher after the first semester or not.   <br>  <br>  Socially, what are your expectations and what have you done about achieving them?  I see a lot of students in this forum complaining because they haven't made close friends within a few weeks of starting school, which just isn't realistic.  Acquaintances are about all you can expect until you have finished the first year or so.  And what activities have you tried?  If you have gone to everything, but the life there doesn't include anything you can enjoy, then it may be a mistake.  I had one student at my Catholic university complaining that she couldn't find a nice Jewish boy there.  Obviously, she had made the wrong college choice!|`|AA10023710	I agree with jess. If you don't feel challenged, and you don't feel you fit in, socially, you probably should transfer to someplace that fits you better. <br>  <br>  The good thing is that, based on your experiences at your current college, you have a better idea, now, of both what you like in a college, and what you do not like. You also probably have an idea of the things you need in your next school. So think through all that, and try to figure out what you like about your current school, and what you don't like. Try to find a school that both fits you academically, and personality-wise. <br>  <br>  Think through the following: How do you best make friends? What sort of social life do you like? Would you do better at a small school, where everyone knows everyone, or a bigger school, where there's a wide variety of types of people? A school that's residential, where everyone stays there on weekends? A school with a lot to do on campus? A school with lots of parties and drinking, or a school with next to none? Or even a school where you're kind of forced into situations where you must make friends, like Prescott College in AZ, where the first weeks on campus are actually spent in the wilderness with a team, doing a task - basically forced bonding. <br>  <br>  There are all sorts of schools out there. If you can figure out what you need in a school, you will find one that fits. |`|671SwG7Raa	That is great that you don't feel challenged enough so I would definitely look around to see other universities that will accept transfer credits from your school.  <br>  <br>  I feel like you already evaluated the major components of the cons of your college.   Is it your school that isn't challenging or is it your major?  I mean, if you're a psych major and know a lot about the subject from high school, then of course the intro level won't feel challenging.  Are you taking any higher level courses?  If you don't feel challenged by those then yes, you should find a more suiting college.|`|vigFmfLmaa	Well, I think the fact that you don't feel challenged is a good indicator you aren't in the right place.  You and only you can determine what's important to you.  Make a list of pros and cons of where you are.  Start looking around at other colleges to see what they offer that yours doesn't.  The thing I always have to weigh is location and cost, since I'm an adult student.  Social activities, sports, work study opportunities, etc may be important to you. |`|e2cf497fb8528f8c556d43e9580066c5aa	Academic challenges are important in your decision too, but if youre not making friends and not having a healthy social life, I think that's also an indication. Perhaps you should go to schools that have students who are very focuse in academics than social life. Many college students tend to be more obsessed with their social life than studying.
d2823184e1eaeb783d457b6f2494f2eaaa	I would try to visit the other schools first, so you can see what they are like.  I would also make a list of the pros and cons of the school your at now and what ever schools you decide you are interested in.  <br>  <br>  I go to school with a lot of people that have transfered out of their original schools for various reasons.  You are not the only person to go through this.  As far as what school is right for you, I think it would be good to figure out what is the most important to you (ie social aspects, majors offered etc.) and try to find a school that can fulfill your needs.<br>  <br>  I don't think you should stay where you are not happy, b/c then your risk of dropping out is going to be greater..

vFUtotY9aa	It means that people are socialized to behave a certain way based on culture, accepted "norms" or any other factors.  For example, in France, babies are taught their parent's native language (usually French), and other Western cultural "norms" such as girls should like pink, boys, blue.  Girls like dolls, boys trucks.  In other countries, there are different sets of rituals and expectations for each gender and each person.  Babies ARE all alike until adults teach them--they are a blank canvas. |`|AA12205301	It means they are a fresh slate. They come out just ready to learn.  They aren't predisposed to speak a certain language, but they learn it from parents and other people.  They aren't predisposed to have a certain outlook on life, pessimistic, optimistic, etc, but they learn those from others around them and circumstances.  A baby comes out fresh and then learns everything from their surroundings and the people they come into contact with.  It is pretty simple. Just like a dog isn't viscious when it is born, but by training or abuse it becomes viscious and angry. It was fresh when born, but learned a certain behaviour because of circumstances and the owners treatment of them. |`|bCDvuk7Faa	Guess it means that as babies we learn from our environment and our family.|`|L80zkgHUaa	It means we are all a product of our environment.

Psychologically speaking human beings are naturally optimistic, but find bad news more interesting. <br>  <br>  2)Clinton, Obama, McCain. Talk about how the media absolutely reamed Clinton despite the fact that her numbers were up. With all her dirty family secrets being brought into light during her husbands presidency she was a fountain of gossip and scandal. How did the media negatively affect her chances of becoming pres? <br>  Obama was considered an angel in the medias eyes with nearly a 3-1 good things said about him. Why? He's charismatic and offers hope. This is rarely seen in presidents. The hope for change and reform. It usually happens after major war when the country is looking for someone to help them up. <br>  McCain, how did the media affect his campaign? He was potrayed as overly conservative. How accurate is all this, and how much did it completely ignore issues in order to tell you all this gossip?<br>  <br>  3) The affect of Obama's internet campaign. A new step in the evolution of political media coverage. He certaintly used it well. This would be a great oppertunity to discuss how his own fundraising alloted him more money for media coverage and as a result lead him to be more successful<br>  <br>  4)How much clout does the media have on the election?

RqpSMJGuaa	It is an inexpensive and wholesome snack provided it isn’t drowned in butter and smothered with popcorn salt. Everyone could afford and enjoy popcorn. But before popcorn became the norm in movie theaters, it was sold by popcorn vendors in the early years who stood outside movie theaters selling their popcorn from their popcorn carts. The movie owners, seeing the brisk business these vendors were doing, decided to eliminate the ‘middleman’ and offer popcorn themselves in their theaters. Later, they added candy and other items that resulted in more profits. This all transpired in the 1920s and 1930s. By the 1940s, especially after WWII, popcorn really 'popped' in movie theaters. No theater worth its 'salt' was without it. <br>  <br>  Popcorn, along with soft drinks, have the highest profit margins of any food/candy items sold in movie theaters and movie theater popcorn is actually the most expensive popcorn you will find anywhere.|`|GtOSTBu1aa	corn was a cheap crop on farms & it is tasty|`|Fnp2MIycaa	Simple answer - because it was inexpensive and convenient (and tasty). Popcorn, at the movies, became popular during the Great Depression when patrons had very little money to spend on luxuries.<br>  <br>  More involved answer -<br>  By the eighteen hundreds, the cultivation of maize became widespread in the continent and the uses of the grain became even more popular. In half a century, popcorn became a hot favorite with the young and old alike and more and more methods of imparting it more taste were dug up. Fairs, parks and expositions would be deserted without a popcorn counter. No outing would be complete without a large helping of popcorn. Mechanized methods of popping now came into use and the demand pushed up the number of new inventions for this purpose. <br>  <br>  Till the Great Depression, street vendors would set up shop wherever there was a reasonable crowd, pushing their steam or gas powered poppers through crowds. <br>  <br>  C Cretors and Company of Chicago introduced the first mobile popcorn machine to the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. It was an instant hit, with the convenience of "moving it about to any location where the operator would be likely to do a good business". It could be "drawn readily by a boy or by a small pony to any picnic ground, fair, political rally, etc. and to many other places where a good business could be done for a day or two." The era of the popcorn vendor had arrived. <br>  <br>  During the Great Depression, with very little money in circulation, popcorn was one of the last few luxuries that the average American could afford. Binging on the extravagant five or ten cent pack of popcorn was all most of them had to be content with. As a result, even as the bigger, better restaurants failed, popcorn business thrived, though at a much lower financial level. The situation was comic in some cases and downright ridiculous in others. Some rags to riches stories too were based on the popcorn magic, like one Oklahoma Banker who lost everything when his bank failed, so he bought a popcorn machine in a store near a theatre. In a couple of years, he had enough money power to buy back three of the farms he’d lost; such was the power of the little popped corn.|`|2e3741216767a389faecfd74b525fe41aa	because corn on the cob was messy.....

Sit in on a class, go to some activities, talk to people in the cafeteria, and just wander around.  If you do leave with doubts, don't let your desire to get out of where you are or your friend's enthusiasm persuade you to doing something that isn't going to satisfy you.

I would do acting skits in front of people and be judged. And trust me, that is very nerve wracking. Especially since you are really putting yourself out there and making yourself very vulnerable.<br>  <br>  After a little practice you begin to realize how pointless the fear is. People aren't all about judging you the second you get in front of them, trust me. There are other people out in the crowd that are just as scared as you.<br>  <br>  Just don't worry about it and you will be fine! Practice your speech and just remember that even if you do mess up, NOBODY WILL CARE!! <br>  <br>  You will be fine....just remember to RELAX and ENJOY informing everybody about your topic.|`|wRpY2FRXaa	You are not alone.  Where I used to work, I did a lot of public speaking as resource person/facilitator  in official assemblies.  My best mentor  assured me that stage fright/nervousness is normal especially to beginners. I adopted her teachings that gave me self-confidence.  These are:  fully prepare and master the subject matter, be very presentable in appearance, talk slowly, make eye contact(connect) with your audience, and assume to yourself that you know more than your audience.|`|UxSyRGcTaa	Who cares what they think of you?

Remeber that when your nervous, it will be over very soon, so why bother even worrying about it?<br>  <br>  Good luck, and remeber....if they taunt you for being bad at public speaking just play the badass card, say you dont care or were too drunk last night to remeber some stupid speach...works everytime.|`|rVA7j5Wcaa	sounds like a self-confidence issue..Do you feel "lesser" than your peers?  If you figure out that that's what it is then you need to ask yourself why do you feel inferior to them or think they will judge you in a negative way, do you not think you're smart enough?.  While youre preparing for the speaking situations, answer those questions..and make sure you understand your material to the fullest, and think of yourself as the teacher.|`|e7wD8sUiaa	Remember, it's a class. It's the perfect place to confront that fear. In fact that's what it's for. I've had similar feelings before performing on stage. In dress rehearsal I'd be shaking and worried to death I would forget my lines or the words to the song I had to sing(solo). Sometimes in dress rehearsal(we always had an audience for the dress rehearsal) I would forget. I knew I forgot, the director knew it and some of the cast noticed it, but the audience didn't have a clue. Opening night I was still nervous, but I felt much more confident because I survived the rehearsal. The more I did it the more confident I became. Now I still get nervous, but that's mostly just wanting to make sure it's a good and entertaining show for the audience.<br>  Take a deep breath(or several), take it slow and steady and don't worry about mistakes. You're human like the rest of us. And don't worry what people would think of you. That's a waste of energy you could be using to focus on your speech. <br>  There's a saying that goes something like this "Worrying is like paying interest on a debt you don't owe". <br>  You'll be fine.|`|VWILDaYPaa	you can do what most people do amd thats look behind everyone or there seats to pretend thr not thr.or you can walk the streets topless to build aliitle confidence.or say high and introduce yourself to random people. the 1st is the only 1 you can do on yr own the other 2 youll need to be pushed|`|569a7cb7c1da8cc36ac60e88ef7c900baa	Learn the speech in segments so that you don't have to read it. Practice the speech and emulate a public speaker, actor, actress, or news personality that you like.<br>  <br>  When giving a speech don't try to be perfect and worry yourself about what other people think. And don't try to look at the entire audience. Look at only one person at a time as you make sure that you are loud enough to be heard. <br>  <br>  Be natural.

If the object is moving with a velocity of +4 m/s, then the slope of the line will be +4 m/s. If the object is moving with a velocity of -8 m/s, then the slope of the line will be -8 m/s. If the object has a velocity of 0 m/s, then the slope of the line will be 0 m/s. The slope of the line on a position versus time graph tells it all. Because of its importance, a student of physics must have a good understanding of how to calculate the slope of a line. In this part of the lesson, the method for determining the slope of a line on a position-time graph will be discussed.|`|2kop2XV6aa	slope can also be defined as diff b/w two points of y axis upon diff b/w of two points of x axis i.e m= (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) where m is slope &y2 ,y1 are two points of y axis & x1,x2 are two points of x axis. m is also equal to tan@(theta)|`|T5jxYoBMaa	my assumption is that, this is a basic question for Algebra, and not a calc. question?  If so, just remember, rise over run.|`|kiWJGE6taa	Slope is used to describe the steepness, incline, gradient, or grade of a straight line. A higher slope value indicates a steeper incline. The slope is defined as the ratio of the "rise" divided by the "run" between two points on a line, or in other words, the ratio of the altitude change to the horizontal distance between any two points on the line. It is also always the same thing as how many rises in one run.<br>  <br>  Using calculus, one can calculate the slope of the tangent to a curve at a point.<br>  <br>  The concept of slope, and much of this article, applies directly to grades or gradients in geography and civil engineering.<br>  <br>

Then in 1939 the Japanese military forces occupied Yichang and surveyed the area. A design, the Otani plan, was completed for the dam in anticipation of a Japanese victory over China.[6] In 1944 involvement from the United States began when the Bureau of Reclamation engineer J.L. Savage surveyed the area and drew up a dam proposal. Around 54 Chinese engineers were sent to the U.S. for training. Some exploration, survey, economic study, and design work was done, but the government, in the midst of the Chinese Civil War, halted work in 1947.[7]<br>  <br>  After the 1949 communist victory, the leader Mao Zedong supported the project, but the Gezhouba Dam project was begun first and economic problems including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution slowed progress. In 1958, after the Hundred Flowers Campaign, some engineers who spoke out against the project were imprisoned.[8]<br>  <br>  During the 1980s plans were revived. Pushed through by Li Peng, the dam was approved by the National People's Congress in 1992 with a record number of abstentions and dissenting votes.[citation needed] The construction started on December 14, 1994.[9] The dam was expected to be fully operational in 2009, but due to additional projects such as the underground power plant with 6 additional generators, and due to the complexity of the ship lift, the dam is not expected to become fully operational until about 2011.[8] The dam will raise the water level the third time to its designed maximum water level (175 m above sea level) by the end of 2008.[10]
zFE1MVqPaa	All year long I've been taking online classes, but I'm not in college, so I don't know if your experience would be really much of a difference for you. But anyways, I think it's a very good alternative to classes on campus. To the other person who said it's horrible - self motivation, time management and the ability to focus on your work at home is the three things necessary for taking online classes. Especially  because they expect you to do more, since it's online. And I think that because I am naturally relaxed at home, getting schoolwork done is more pleasant for me than it is in a stressful environment. <br>  <br>  The downsides to online classes would be technical errors, not being able to pass notes or chat with others in your class freely between lessons. Also working at your own pace, if you're not good at managing a schedule for school work. The only other thing I can think of is not being able to contact your instructor at the appropriate time. But if you have any questions with the material, they're someone who you can ask, which is as convenient as being on the campus. There's usually also tutoring offered with online classes as well.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|6vLuEppFaa	well i attend a campus but i took an online course this past summer and it was horrible. it was really difficult for me to manage my time since there wasnt really a set schedule.  It is kind of hard to get in "school mode" when you're not in school.  When i'm home id rather relax and be comfortable doing the things i normally do without having to worry about class.  online classes definitely were not for me.|`|GZQXsOKDaa	Personally I think you should attend a campus, there's nothing like one-on-one teaching to help you excel.

Mg7THwCLaa	I don't think it should because the stuff is all very low level like fourth and fifth grade level plus it only puts value in math and english while people in the arts can earn much more money than someone with an english degree. Why does our society have to only put value on these two subjects? it doesn't even include science which is a very important field to the advancement of our society. I just don't think that whether you can graduate from high school or not should be judged by how well you write an essay or how many math formulas you have memorized it needs to be a more equal system so that students who learn differently can still receive a high school diploma!|`|ebaad9ef6100d3944ecaad5bbf4b8a1aaa	Of course it should be.

7Kzv3mGzaa	E' la classica situazione in cui i prof, per quanto sbaglino, hanno il coltello dalla parte del manico. Al limite li si può contestare per compiti a risposta chiusa, o di matematica, etc, ma in un'interrogazione, un tema, una versione.... sfido a dimostrare che ci si merita 9 invece che 7 o 8!<br>  Anch'io comunque trovo che in certi casi questa sia una cosa ingiusta... nessuno ovviamente chiede di avere i voti regalati, ma certi "limiti" autoimposti e autoreferenziali non hanno alcun senso. Fra l'altro c'è anche il problema delle borse di studio, che molto spesso farebbero comodo soprattutto a persone con difficoltà economiche ma che, ovviamente, sono assegnate in base alla media scolastica... Così può capitare che qualcuno ne sia automaticamente escluso perchè i voti massimi sono 7 o 8, e a ottenerle sia gente magari meno meritevole, per la fortuna di avere professori larghi di manica...|`|BfSaO9bTaa	è sbagliato sono d'accordo con te perchè altrimenti cosa ci stanno a fare il 9 e 10 come voti?? la scala dovrebbe essere 1-8 invece che 1-10...purtroppo potete fare ben poco voi studenti a parte farlo notare, questa è una situazione in cui il "potere" ce l'ha chi sta in cattedra. questo metodo di valutazione era applicato al tempo dei nostri genitori in cui i prof davano raramente un 8 ma ora i tempi sono cambiati ed è sconfortante per uno studente questo metodo di valuatuazione perchè non premia gli sforzi degli studenti che si impegnano per avere un voto alto e una buona media. io ormai le superiori le ho già finite e ho avuto la fortuna di non incontrare prof del genere cmq ora all'università capita di incontrare prof che agli esami il voto più alto è un 25-26...ci sono dappertutto persone che approffittano della loro posizione!! provate a farlo presente ai prof, o anche in consiglio di classe tramite i rappresentanti di classe che hanno il diritto di partecipare al consiglio con i prof e di intervenire ed esporre i vostri problemi|`|Zxi44ZRWaa	Hai ragione.<br>  Conta che il MIT, per esempio, che è una famosa università a Boston, chiede tutti 10.<br>  Al massimo un 9.<br>  E un voto perfetto al SAT.<br>  Io ho fatto 2370 al SAT, su 2400, e mi hanno rifiutato.<br>  Anche se poi sono andato in Nuova Zelanda e ora studio in California.<br>  Cerca di fare un ottimo SAT, se riesci, andare all'estero non sara' difficile.|`|ztBUlfUOaa	non è giusto,i voti devono essere giusti,e soprattutto,senza preferenze.....ciao|`|3IrcM7LIaa	è sbagliatixximo!!! e t comprendo! e io m arrabbio qnd sento ke altri miei amici prendono 8-9(e studiano qnt me, o x niente) qnd io x prendere un 6 m devo fare c**o così. sn i prof!!! e nn lo dico xke odio i prof e x prendermela cn gli altri,ma xk è cosi. ritengo d meritare nn un 8 ma un 7.(e nn lo penso solo io) vado bene in tt, xo qll ke prendo è sl quel 6(niente male si, ma x la fine dell'anno no)ma il fatto è ke nn sn sl io ma tt i miei comp. forse ho divagato un pò cmq hai ragione è sbagliato. e poi nn c spronano x niente così. sn loro ke pensano di "farci del bene"|`|A6qWE1T9aa	purtroppo i prfessori sono solo degli emeriti stronzi comuqnue quell "giusti" credo che non mettano voti alti per non farci montare la testa ma è una cosa inutile perchè se io so che 8 è il massimo e ho 8 mi monto la testa lo stesso perchè ho preso appunto...il massimo!|`|U4SLDJDxaa	Hai ragione nn è giusto!!!!!!! anke nella mia scuola è la stessa cosa!!!!!!!! nn capisco, se il 10 esiste xkè nn usarlo!?!?!??! forse qcs si può fare....parlarne cn il preside o consultare il pof (il patto formativo, ke ogni scuola dovrebbe avere)....forse qcs c'è.....o cercare d far ragionare i prof (cosa impossibile)|`|hojtYrngaa	Pienamente daccordo!!!!

Then take at least 4 your senior year. The average GPA of their class of 2010 was 3.6, so you should aim for something a little higher. They do not consider the SATs, but I would talk them because other colleges do. It is in your best interest if you apply to a number of schools, I would pick around 6 schools you would want to go to. 2 should be reaches (one slight and one high), 2 should be matches, and the last two should be safeties. <br>  <br>  SLC is a great school ,and if you are interested in writing then that is the place to go. They have a very unique was of teaching there that emphasizes community, and has a real commitment to the betterment of their students. I hope you get in.

Just enjoy the time you have at home before you leave. There is no point in worrying about something that you can not control. This is just an experience that you will have to go through when you get there. Uhh, I am not an Ateneo, but here I can give you advice based on my experience in America. First, keep your priorities in check...do not get caught up into partying if you know you have a test to study for. However, do not spend all your time trying to maintain a immaculate GPA (even if you are planing on going to grad school). What I am Saying is find a balance. Second, meet as many people as you can. This is a time in your life to experience new things and new people. Third, never sign up for credit cards. These things can ruin your credit. Fourth, look into studying abroad (even if it is only for the summer). Fifth, do not chose your major until your Junior year. You may think that you know exactly what you are going to do with the rest of your life, but people change drastically from year to year. You do not want to get stuck doing something that you are going to regret pursuing down the road. So wait until you absolutely have to when it come to declaring your major.

Je crois que c'est du début du passage argumentatif.<br>  <br>  D'abord ce texte argumentatif comprendra au moins deux parties. Et n'oublie pas : une idée par paragraphe (ou partie, en 3ème), développée par une ou deux idées secondaires et illustrées d'un ou deux exemples. <br>  Tu commences par exposer directement ta première idée (appelée aussi argument, parce qu'elle doit être sensée et pertinente)<br>  Ex: Pour ou contre la mixité au collège.<br>  <br>  (introduction, que je ne fais pas car je crois que tu parles du début du texte lui-même.)<br>  Début du texte argumentatif:<br>  "    Les statistiques les plus récentes prouvent que les filles travaillent mieux en collège que les gar?ons (idée principale): elles ont des qualités d'attention et de sérieux que personne ne peut nier (idée secondaire). D'ailleurs, bien des professeurs préfèrent les classes avec une dominante féminine en raison du calme qui y règne (2ème idée secondaire). Ainsi, (1ère exemple), avant 1968 , pour schématiser, les collèges et lycées étaient réservés soient aux filles soient aux gar?ons et la discipline y était plus stricte. Nous pouvons supposer que le travail était plus efficace. A contrario, (2ème exemple), dans ma classe de l'an passé , il y avait plus de gar?ons que de filles et le chahut était récurrent."<br>     "(suite: 2ème paragraphe) L'adolescence est une des périodes les plus troublées de la vie ( 2ème idée principale). Les bouleversements hormonaux entra?nent des pulsions difficilement contr?lables (idée secondaire.) . Dans une classe mixte , cela prend une ampleur désastreuse. ( 2ème idée secondaire ).<br>  Puis tu mets un ou deux exemples.<br>  Si tu avais mis le sujet sur lequel tu dois plancher , cela aurait été plus facile de t'aider. Vérifie que l'on te demande bien un texte argumentatif seul, sans introduction, car si tu dois aussi faire l'introcduction, il te faudra exposer le sujet, et le présenter , en t'aidant de tes acquis de 6ème et de 5ème.<br>  <br>  Bon courage ! amitié.

Se dice que una persona padece SIDA cuando su organismo, debido a la inmunodepresión provocada por el VIH, no es capaz de ofrecer una respuesta inmune adecuada contra las infecciones.<br>  <br>  Cabe destacar la diferencia entre estar infectado por el VIH y padecer SIDA. Una persona infectada por el VIH es seropositiva, y pasa a desarrollar un cuadro de SIDA cuando su nivel de Linfocitos T CD4 (que son el tipo de célula al que ataca el virus) desciende por debajo de 200 células por mililitro de sangre.<br>  <br>  El VIH se transmite a través de los fluidos corporales, tales como sangre, semen, secreciones vaginales y la leche materna.<br>  <br>  El Día mundial del SIDA se celebra el 1 de diciembre. La Real Academia Espa?ola (RAE) recoge la palabra sida en la vigésimo segunda edición de su diccionario, por lo cual puede ser utilizada en minúsculas<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Prevencion!!:<br>  <br>  La única causa de la transmisión es el intercambio de fluidos corporales, en particular la sangre y las secreciones genitales. El virus VIH no se puede transmitir por la respiración, la saliva, el contacto casual por el tacto, dar la mano, abrazar, besar en la mejilla, masturbarse mutuamente con otra persona o compartir utensilios como vasos, tazas o cucharas. En cambio es teóricamente posible que el virus se transmita entre personas a través del beso boca a boca, si ambas personas tienen llagas sangrantes o encías llagadas, pero ese caso no ha sido documentado y además es considerado muy improbable, ya que la saliva contiene concentraciones mucho más bajas que por ejemplo el semen, y también porque la saliva tiene propiedades antivirales que hacen que destruya al VIH.<br>  <br>  El contagio de VIH por las relaciones sexuales ha sido comprobado de hombre a mujer, de mujer a hombre, de mujer a mujer y de hombre a hombre. El uso de condones de látex se recomienda para todo tipo de actividad sexual que incluya penetración. Es importante enfatizar que es el condón hecho del material látex el que se debe usar, pues otro condón ("de carnero") que existe en el mercado, hecho a base de material orgánico, no es efectivo para la prevención. Los condones tienen una tasa estimada del 90-95% de efectividad para evitar el embarazo o el contagio de enfermedades, y usado correctamente, esto es, bien conservado, abierto con cuidado y correctamente colocado, es el mejor medio de protección contra la transmisión del virus VIH. Se ha demostrado repetidamente que el VIH no pasa efectivamente a través de los condones de látex intactos.<br>  <br>  El sexo anal, debido a la delicadeza de los tejidos del ano y la facilidad con la que se llagan, se considera la actividad sexual de más riesgo. Por eso los condones se recomiendan también para el sexo anal. El condón se debe usar una sola vez, tirándolo a la basura y usando otro condón cada vez. Debido al riesgo de rasgar (tanto el condón como la piel y la mucosa de la paredes vaginales y anales) se recomienda el uso de lubricantes con base acuática. La vaselina y los lubricantes basados en aceite o petróleo no deben usarse con los condones porque debilitan el látex y lo vuelven propenso a rasgarse (y no por el mito de que el virus pueda pasar a través del látex).<br>  <br>  En términos de trasmisión del VIH, se considera que el sexo oral tiene menos riesgos que el vaginal o el anal. Sin embargo, la relativa falta de investigación definitiva sobre el tema, sumada a información pública de dudosa veracidad e influencias culturales, han llevado a que muchos crean, de forma incorrecta, que el sexo oral es seguro. Aunque el factor real de trasmisión oral del VIH no se conoce aún con precisión, hay casos documentados de transmisión a través de sexo oral por inserción y por recepción (en hombres). Un estudio concluyó que el 7,8% de hombres recientemente infectados en San Francisco probablemente recibieron el virus a través del sexo oral. Sin embargo, un estudio de hombres espa?oles que tuvieron sexo oral con compa?eros VIH+ a sabiendas de ello no identificó ningún caso de trasmisión oral. Parte de la razón por la cual esa evidencia es conflictiva es porque identificar los casos de transmisión oral es problemático. La mayoría de las personas VIH+ tuvieron otros tipos de actividad sexual antes de la infección, por lo cual se hace difícil o imposible aislar la transmisión oral como factor. Factores como las úlceras bucales, etc., también son difíciles de aislar en la transmisión entre personas "sanas". Se recomienda usualmente no permitir el ingreso de semen o fluido pre-seminal en la boca. El uso de condones para el sexo oral (o protector dental para el cunnilingus) reduce aún más el riesgo potencial. El condón que haya sido utilizado ya para la práctica del sexo oral, debe desecharse. En caso de que exista coito posterior, se utilizará un nuevo profiláctico; ya que las microlesiones que se producen en el látex por el roce con las piezas dentarias, permiten el paso del virus.<br>  <br>  Se sabe que el VIH se transmite cuando se comparten agujas entre usuarios de drogas intravenosas, y éste es uno de las formas más comunes de transmisión. Todas las organizaciones de prevención del SIDA advierten a los usuarios de drogas que no compartan agujas, y que usen una aguja nueva o debidamente esterilizada para cada inyección. Los centros y profesionales del cuidado de la salud y de las adicciones disponen de información sobre la limpieza de agujas con lejía. En los Estados Unidos y en otros países occidentales están disponibles agujas gratis en algunas ciudades, en lugares de intercambio de agujas, donde se reciben nuevas a cambio de las usadas, o en sitios de inyecciones seguras.<br>  <br>  Los trabajadores médicos pueden prevenir la extensión del VIH desde pacientes a trabajadores y de paciente a paciente, siguiendo normas universales de asepsia o aislamiento contra sustancias corporales, tales como el uso de guantes de látex cuando se ponen inyecciones o se manejan desechos o fluidos corporales, y lavándose las manos frecuentemente.<br>  <br>  El riesgo de infectarse con el virus VIH a causa de un pinchazo con una aguja que ha sido usada en una persona infectada es menor de 1 entre 200. Una apropiada profilaxis pos-exposición (con drogas anti-VIH) logra contrarrestar ese peque?o riesgo, reduciendo al mínimo la probabilidad de seroconversión.<br>  <br>  Un estudio de 2005[7] ha demostrado que estar circuncidado reduce significativamente la probabilidad de que un hombre se contagie de una mujer seropositiva por penetración vaginal. Los rumores en este sentido, producidos a partir de trabajos anteriores no concluyentes, han aumentado ya la popularidad de la circuncisión en algunas partes de áfrica. Un trabajo relacionado[8] estima que la circuncisión podría convertirse en un factor significativo en la lucha contra la extensión de la epidemia.<br>  <br>  Investigaciones recientes confirmaron que de hecho existen personas inmunes al Virus, debido a una mutación en el código genético llamada "CCR5-delta 32". Según se cree, habría aparecido hace 700 a?os, cuando la peste bubónica diezmó a Europa. La teoría dice que los organismos con ese gen impiden que el virus ingrese en el glóbulo blanco.

J7UWoek5aa	Wow, I actually think you have a very good shot. Remember, minority status is only beneficially if you are an under represented minority (Hispanic and black). If you are then that will help. Your GPA is great, and your ACT score is very good as well so I would not retake it (I am not sure if they even consider your score if you have your Associates, or if you took it after high school). I would not take a SAT2 subject test, since you are taking the college course equivalent. Your courses look very challenging, and that is a plus too. I don't know what else to say, I think you have a great shot. <br>  <br>  Good Luck
CeXNxNl6aa	dipende da quello che ti piace fare. se preferisci le materie umanistiche o quelle scientifiche. <br>  tieni conto però di due fattori inconsueti però purtroppo reali:<br>  <br>  1. lo studio della lingua latina stranamente è più assiduo e viene svolto in più ore al liceo scientifico <br>  <br>  2. lo studio del latino al classico è più sistematico, e semplice e minori sono le ore dedicate a questa materia.<br>  <br>  questo paradosso è stato introdotto recentemente con delle riforme ministeriali le quali hanno aumentato le ore di latino allo scientifico diminuendole al classico. Tuttavia non tutti gli istituti sono strettamente conformi a tale direttiva, molto dipende anche dall'insegnante che può dedicare maggior tempo al latino a discapito però di altre materie.<br>  <br>  per il resto devi decidere te. ricordati anche che lo scientifico in alcune città è anche sperimentale ed è stato introdotto lo studio dell'informatica e l'uso dei pc.<br>  devi informarti se lo scientifico sperimentale c'è anche nella tua città.|`|1kaqQUB7aa	ciao, frequento il liceo classico e l'anno prossimo avrò la maturità...ti posso dire che questi anni sono stati davvero impegnativi..ho condotto una vita scuola-casa per quattro anni e il sabato sera qualche uscita ma niente di più..quindi devi essere superconvinta se scegli questo tipo di scuola....Certo il liceo classico ti dà una preparazione e ti imposta un metodo di studio unico che ti sarà utilissimo se vorrai andare all'università però preparati ad ore massacranti di italiano,latino e greco, senza contare che nella mia scuola anche le materie scientifiche sono molto approfondite...spero di esserti stata d'aiuto..in bocca al lupo!|`|974cf9ad27e1eadfa2201d7626be0ba8aa	Molto dipende da quello che tu ami fare...comunque ti consiglio un bel liceo classico che ti da una preparazione di base superiore e che ti permette di accedere a qualsiasi facoltà universitaria tu voglia (non dare ascolto a chi ti dice che il classico ti da solo una formazione umanistica....la maggior parte dei miei ex compagni di liceo sono iscritti in  facoltà scientifiche quali medicina ed ingegneria...e se la cavano egregiamente)...l'unico difetto che ha il liceo classico è quello per cui non puoi fermarti al diploma ma devi continuare per forza con l'università perchè, dal punto di vista strettamente lavorativo, quel diploma non serve a niente...ma se vuoi andare all'università il liceo classico è la scelta migliore...fidati ;-)<br>  <br>  Ciao|`|E5RnM0aZaa	sei piu' brava di italiano o di scienze-matematica?

If this is a writing-oriented job (journalism, research, public relations, etc.) you should provide a sample that demonstrates your abilities to do that specific type of work.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if this writing sample is simply an opportunity to show what a good candidate you are, consider a creative nonfiction essay.  Creative nonfiction takes elements of good fiction, like plot, character, tension/conflict, humor, description, and action, and applies them to an essay with a point.  David Sedaris is a master of nonfiction--listen to him reading his essays at <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/specials/lists/sedaris/" rel="nofollow">http://www.npr.org/programs/specials/lis...</a><br>  <br>  If your don't feel that any certain subject or type of writing is required for your sample, try describing a situation in which you solved a problem, worked as part of a team, or applied your skills to a situation successfully. Those are things any employer will want you to do. It's always hard to convincingly tell a potential employer what you know or what you can do--but with a creative story of personal growth, you can *show* your capabilities in a very compelling way.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Unsolicited Commercial Email and other forms of spam have become so prevalent as to have become a major nuisance of users of these services, as well as being a financial burden on internet service providers Advertising is increasingly invading public spaces, such as schools, which some critics argue is a form of child exploitation .

Ads are the MAJOR revenue source for most publications.  Subscription and newsstand purchases come nowhere close to offsetting the cost of staffing, printing, and distribution.<br>  <br>  Ad-free TV is possible, but the costs have to be met somewhere.  In the absence of ads you'd be subsdising TV productions via taxes and -- possibly -- TV licenses (as in the UK) that have to be purchased by the user.<br>  <br>  Yes, I know, you are paying indirectly for the costs of advertising when you purchase a product.  To my way of thinking, there is more of a personal choice in this system.  You can choose to purchase or not, watch or not, etc.  If you pay taxes in the UK, the government allocates part of your income tax revenues to the cost of running the BBC -- whether you watch TV, regardless of even if you have a TV set!<br>  <br>  I would rather have my monies be used in supporting advertising and related industries, rather than generating more IRS jobs.<br>  <br>  As to the usages of advertising, very briefly......<br>  <br>  A) Create awareness;<br>  B) Create the desire to make a purchase/sample a service.<br>  <br>  After that the product has to deliver to maintain the consumer's loyalty.|`|5IEtIQ9yaa	Because it makes us aware as to what products and services are available in the market and it gives us choices from among them. Of course, the downside is there are a lot of false advertising because no product would ever claim to be less than its competitior. Then again, the intelligent consumer can use ads to think about (even test) the claims of these products and services.

sT7Nn1NLaa	first, be yourself =)   visit the school before the school yr. starts and see if you can get your schedule so that you can look for your classrooms, so you won't get lost on the first day. and so you know when lunch is, also. since you're going to a large high school, there will probably be two or much lunch periods. try and find out which one is yours. your school also might have lockers and you should probably figure out how that's going to work out or where your locker is going to be. i don't know if you're going to be taking PE, but some high schools do require that you have your PE uniforms ready on the first day. so you should try and find out about that, as well as all the other things you might need. you should also familiarize yourself with the school rules and events. and during the year, join sports or any activities you are interested in, because that's a good way to meet people. good luck and have fun :)|`|AA12378278	well i am also going to be a freshman next year  and i think we should just be friendly and try and make friends with people who like stuff that we like since there are going to be different groups/clicks|`|WbbF7svZaa	Everything will come natural.<br>  Just be nice to everyone, get good grades, don't be shy and everyone will love you.|`|AA10294268	jus act normal and get cool with the others in your classes and by lunch u can be hangin with them...|`|dtMY9cByaa	Even if you are scared, do not show weakness.

Ask a teacher where a certain room is if you get lost, or the security, if you have that at your school. Ask someone for help if you cant open your locker. (My locker got jammed so many times!!)  Also, try to make new friends in your classes or by your locker early. That way, you will have someone to talk to in your lunch period. <br>    Sorry if I didn't help much, but that is all that I can tell ya. Be prepared, and dont be nervous if you a late to classes the first couple of days. Most teachers let freshmen get away with it. <br>     Good luck, stay outta trouble, and keep your head up. =)
0cc161ff5c4a48e6e463a279c916b3d0aa	You have to understand that the English language has been influenced by Shakespeare to a degree almost unrivaled by any other single person. I say almost because William Tyndale, a translator of the Bible into English whose language was used extensively in the King James Version of the Bible and Thomas Cranmer, the man who wrote the Anglican Book of Common Prayer also made significant contributions.<br>  <br>  So many phrases that literate people take for granted originated in Shakespeare. Reading Shakespeare gives you an appreciation for language and a vocabulary of words and phrases which will server you well.<br>  <br>  Beyond that, many of Shakespeare's works are damn good reading. While the English may seem stilted at times, the plots and characters still work. This is one reason you keep seeing them remade, with or without attribution.|`|5cef5b7fffe19af05a2309d5c9a9d24daa	It is extremely important. Many of the novels and plays which have been written in modern times have allusions to a Shakespearean situation - even some of the things we see on TV. If you are familiar with Shakespeare's works, you will understand the subtle references that others may miss. It may not make a great deal of difference to your life, but you will feel a sense of satisfaction that you 'got' the reference.<br>  <br>  Shakespeare is unwittingly quoted in much of our everyday speech, so we should do him the honour of studying his works if we have the chance (like in school!). For instance it was Shakespeare who first used the term 'salad days', tongue-tied', 'fair play', 'fool's paradise', 'more fool you', 'high time', 'the long and short of it', 'bag and baggage', 'the game is up', 'foul play', 'without rhyme or reason', 'good riddance', dead as a doornail', 'an eyesore', 'a laughing stock', 'for goodness' sake' and many, many others. Most people don't realise that.<br>  <br>  Study him while you can.

e25732a8dbc93e25f7478a65d5d449e8aa	A black hole is a region of spacetime from which nothing can escape, NOT EVEN LIGHT. <br>  <br>  To see why this happens, imagine throwing a tennis ball into the air. The harder you throw the tennis ball, the faster it is travelling when it leaves your hand and the higher the ball will go before turning back. If you throw it hard enough it will never return, the gravitational attraction will not be able to pull it back down. The velocity the ball must have to escape is known as the escape velocity and for the earth is about 7 miles a second. <br>  <br>  As a body is crushed into a smaller and smaller volume, the gravitational attraction increases, and hence the escape velocity gets bigger. Things have to be thrown harder and harder to escape. Eventually a point is reached when even light, which travels at 186 thousand miles a second, is not travelling fast enough to escape. At this point, nothing can get out as nothing can travel faster than light. This is a black hole.|`|cb969765e0982907b660a4f84d4db657aa	well there are 2 answer for blackhole....*<br>  <br>  a black hole is NOT a "dark spot" in the universe. it is a collection of extremely dense VERY large mass which has gravitational power capable of sucking in light (not "absorb the speed of light"). because even light does not escape a black hole, we do not know what one looks like, because one cannot be observed with the human eye or any light sensing equipment. the only reason we know black holes exist is because we can see their effects and theorize the cause. fortunately, this theorizing is most likely right <br>  <br>  and...<br>    <br>  Blackhole is a C program designed to stop spam and prevent unwanted senders from sending you email.

Yo opino que tambien hay buenas escuelas públicas, y es el alumno el que debe responsabilizarse junto con sus profesores de su preparación, es decir, el alumno y los padres tiene tanta responsabilidad como la escuela, sólo que a las escuelas privadas estas en todo tu derecho de exigir calidad en su profesorado por lo que pagas$$$$
7e37e10c84b94859d022a9d34c3d04a9aa	In a sense yes but they no longer perform the same function as in the states.<br>  What might be a better bet for you would be to look into 'Foundation Studies' courses. Many UK Universities offer what is effectively - and some times referred to as - a 'year zero' for a degree. Mostly they are broad one year courses in a field rather then subject (some art related foundation courses are 2 years). They do not lead to a seperate qualification and are not normally of use outside the University that you have chosen. <br>  However, many Universities will allow you to follow ANY course after completion. Most will require you to apply for a specific course before starting, but transfers in this first year are common.<br>  <br>  Both Loughborough and Liverpool University have extensive foundation studies and a wide range of degree's on offer.<br>  <br>  hope that helps.<br>  (loughborough link follows p.s. get in touch with the admissions tutor - nice guy - explain your situation and i'm sure he'll help)|`|J7UWoek5aa	I know a lot of people from the states who apply to colleges in the U.K. Why don't you look at the universities you want to apply to in the UK and see what they say about international applicants. There may be a certain standardized test they look at, or they may require something else. Now, if you had a bad high school experience academically and you do not think you would be competitive for universities in the UK than that is a different story.

nNifcLf8aa	Aimer ce que l'on étudie, avoir de la passion, être curieux sont essentielles. Il ne faut pas faire des études pour avoir des dipl?mes. Sinon, c'est l'ennui assuré et une réussite forcément limitée. <br>  <br>  A contrario, il faut savoir se sacrifier en bossant des choses que l'on aime pas ou moins et en passant du temps à apprendre. Lorsque l'on apprend, on n'est pas au 35h. On partage pas son temps de travail avec les autres. <br>  <br>  Bien s?r, travailler 70h devant son bureau ou à l'école n'est pas une solution. Il y a un équilibre à trouver. De plus, ce ne sont pas les seuls lieux pour apprendre. Un reportage à la télé, un livre littéraire ou non, un article dans un journal ou une ballade dans un musée font leur office. Il faut se cultiver. <br>  <br>  D'autre part, cela dépend des matières mais dans beaucoup de cas, la meilleure fa?on de réussir est de limiter intelligemment ce que l'on a apprendre. Il faut avoir la flemme d'apprendre trop de choses par coeur tout en voulant les savoir à tout prix. Pour cela, il faut prendre un maximum de recul, situer les informations les unes par rapport aux autres. C'est une attitude que l'on doit avoir en permanence. Lorsqu'on aborde une nouvelle notion ou un nouveau thème, il faut toujours chercher à le situer par rapport à tes connaissances acquises.|`|588fc443d0edf153be792aeb0754fad0aa	deja oui il faut travailler regulierement et ne pas attendre le dernier moment ca marche rarement cette technique ! ensuite moi je fais des fiches au fur et a mesure que je met bien en valeur pour que l'info rentre plus facilement , et puis des fiches c bien vu ke ca resume tout ! apres selon les matieres pratiquer ! cad faire pleins d'exos regulier pour que ca devienne facil de voir un enoncé vu qu'on a fait le meme genre d'exos plusieurs fois ! et voila ! normaleemnt c la methode qui marche ! enfin sur moi ca dechire ! bisous bonne chance|`|xRaGyugTaa	révise et travaille régulièrement|`|0935d02e8453f19715d0277648afb28eaa	Pour les revisions (qui ne doivent pas etre des visions), je te conseil de te faire un planning et de t'y tenir coute que coute...<br>  <br>  Accorde toi les matinées pour la revision, et l'am pour faire les annales.<br>  du style lundi matin je travail sur tel chapitre de tel matiere, mardi am je fais les annales correspondant à ce chapitre.|`|8b576Cs7aa	Le plus important à mon sens est d'aller à tous les cours, d'y être attentif à 100% et de participer aux travaux dirigés/pratiques.<br>  Combien j'en voyais qui ne venaient jamais aux cours du matin, et qui à la fin n'ont pas eu de super notes.|`|vNG511khaa	Arrêter de perdre du temps sur Q/R!!!|`|XQo4sQP5aa	je pense que l important pour réussir est d'effectuer un travail régulier.

It's also "fair" because those students are likely to do well on the test anyway, while people with a 72 percent may not have a good grasp of the subject matter so a test is needed for them to prove it.  |`|G13DBUcUaa	I guess you have to look at it both ways. Your professor probably just wants to reward all the students that are doing well in the class, by letting them not to take the test. Every professor has his different ways of teaching, and he is just trying  some sort of motivation for you to do well in the class. But if I was the student that had less than the 95%, then I definitely would find it unfair. It depends on how you look at it. |`|86r27q1Eaa	Your professor is teaching a valuable lesson. You need to pay more attention.  Fools may laugh, but the wise know.<br>  <br>  Sally Cat> I'm not talking about your schoolwork. I'm talking about the Professor. Its a lesson to be learned from his actions.|`|tee9vCm0aa	I say it's fair to reward the students with higher average by giving them an exemption from taking the finals.|`|R3bkbDBXaa	Stop whining.  You must be a freshman.  Welcome to college life.  Go whine somewhere else.|`|ODedx7t4aa	I agree.  Exempting people from the exam seems like a way to reward hard work, but the consideration for those who are working hard, but struggling with the subject are paying for it, just as if they didn't do anything.  However, I can see justifying it as a way to encourage hard work and participation.  I see both sides of the story, but as a teacher, everybody would take the test, otherwise what's the point of having an assessment?|`|AA11652116	I am with Dan on this one.  Courses are formed around learning objectives (what you want students to learn) and tests are simply a way to determine if the students have met their objectives.<br>  <br>  If they are going into a final with an A, is there really any point to testing them?  It creates more work for the professor as he would have to grade the exam.  It is a nice reward for both student and teacher imho.<br>

Fnp2MIycaa	Hatsune Miku is the most popular character originating from the Vocaloid voice synthesizer software by Yamaha.|`|6rNmAqXnaa	Hatsune Miku (初音ミク ?) is the first installment in the Vocaloid2 Character Vocal Series released on August 31, 2007. The name of the title and the character of the software was chosen by combining Hatsu (初 ,First?), Ne (音 ,Sound?), and Miku (未来 ,Future?).The data for the voice was created by actually sampling the voice of Saki Fujita, a Japanese voice actress. Unlike general purpose speech synthesizers, the software is tuned to create J-pop songs commonly heard in anime, but it is possible to create songs from other genres.<br>  <br>  Nico Nico Douga played a fundamental role in the recognition and popularity of the software. Soon after the release of the software, users of Nico Nico Douga started posting videos with songs created by the software. According to Crypton, a popular video with a comically-altered Miku holding a leek, singing Ievan Polkka, presented multifarious possibilities of applying the software in multimedia content creation. As the recognition and popularity of the software grew, Nico Nico Douga became a place for collaborate content creation. Popular original songs written by a user would generate illustrations, animation in 2D and 3D, and remixes by other users. Other creators would show their unfinished work and ask for ideas.<br>  <br>  On October 18, 2007, an Internet BBS website reported Hatsune Miku was suspected to be victim of censorship by Google and Yahoo!, since images of Miku did not show up on the image searches.Google and Yahoo denied any censorship on their part, blaming the missing images on a bug that does not only affect "Hatsune Miku" but other search keywords as well. Both companies expressed a willingness to fix the problem as soon as possible.Images of Miku were relisted on Yahoo on October 19.<br>  <br>  A Hatsune Miku manga called Maker Hikōshiki Hatsune Mix began serialization in the Japanese manga magazine Comic Rush on November 26, 2007, published by Jive. The manga is drawn by Kei, the original character designer for Hatsune Miku. A second manga called Hachune Miku no Nichijō Roipara! drawn by Ontama began serialization in the manga magazine Comp Ace on December 26, 2007, published by Kadokawa Shoten.<br>  <br>  Her first appearance in an anime is in (Zoku) Sayonara Zetsubō Sensei, where she (and various other people and characters) try out to be the voice of Meru Otonashi. For online multi-player games, the Japanese version of PangYa started a campaign with Hatsune Miku on May 22, 2008 in which she is included as one of the characters.Her first appearance in a video game is in 13-sai no Hello Work DS (13歳のハローワークDS ?) for the Nintendo DS where she is included as one of the characters. Hatsune Miku will be given a PlayStation Portable game called Hatsune Miku: Project Diva to be released in 2009 by Sega.Hatsune Miku made a cameo appearance in the Lucky Star OVA in the form of Kagami's cosplay in her dream. Hatsune Miku received the 2008 Seiun Award in the free category.<br>  <br>  On August 27, 2008, Victor Entertainment released the album Re:package which contains a collection of songs performed by Hatsune Miku and composed by a pair of dōjin artists named Livetune. The album sold over 20,000 copies in its first week and successfully broke into Oricon's charts by placing fifth for the week|`|ktLhatITaa	Hatsune Miku is the first installement in the vocaliod2 character vocal series released on august 31, 2007 by yamaha

If you are referring to transferring from a community college to a four-year college, most states have articulation agreements between such schools so that your credits fit right in to the requirements of the senior college.<br>  <br>  s
AA11201256	yes, if you have less than 60 credits, they will look at your high school records. 
2YkEQrmvaa	It doesn't matter what your major is when you apply.  Most Freshman aren't even declared!  Just keep your grades up and make sure you're active in clubs or community service.  Good luck!  |`|hdPoog0waa	Is it possible to apply to 2 different colleges?  I owuld if you can.  If not, I would try to talk to someone who goes there to learn more about their selectivity.<br>  <br>  If you think it may be easier to get in, I would apply, as long as you have reviewed their policies on changing your major.  You don't want to jeopardize your admittance if you change your mind later.  Just for the record, General Studies colleges and degrees are not as easy to persue as everyone thinks.  They require numerous upper level courses in different diciplines. Good luck!
AA11798704	If you are still living at home you need to go with their rules. If your parents are helping you financially, you should gratefully accept it.<br>  <br>  Stay at the small school. The other distractions at the big school will cause you to seek entertainment and you are supposed to be in college to get an education not to improve your social life.<br>  <br>  Focus on your major, your grades, and getting a job and thank your parents for their financial help.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Grad schools don't care if you were involved in sports or clubs.  If you were involved in a club related to your major, or did volunteer work in that area, then that's great and worth mentioning, but much more than that will just suggest to grad schools that you are doing too much outside of school to finish your work.  Depending on the program, grad schools can be more demanding than a full-time job - working nights and weekends as well as weekdays.  Don't make them think anything will distract you from doing well.  They'd much rather take on a person who will publish 5 papers than someone who's well-rounded.|`|f2b6d8aa39507900c3d4c0785edd85bbaa	Yes.

Who knows who merged them into one paragraph.<br>  <br>  The first part, "The most effectual means of preventing the perversion of power into tyranny are to illuminate, as far as practicable, the minds of the people" is from "The Diffusion of Knowledge Bill" 1799.<br>  <br>  The second part, "It is an insult to our citizens to question whether they are rational beings or not, and blasphemy against religion to suppose it cannot stand the test of truth and reason" is from a "Letter to N. G. Dufief, Philadelphia bookseller 1814, who had been prosecuted for selling a book that Jefferson himself had purchased.<br>  <br>  I believe this refers to freedom of speech, a condemnation of censorship, and the populace's ability to judge a book by what is between the covers.<br>  <br>  The third part, "Light and liberty go together" was said by Jefferson to Tench Coxe, 1795.  Light or education, being necessary for liberty or freedom.<br>  <br>  The fourth part, "I look to the diffusion of light and education as the resource most to be relied on for ameliorating the condition, promoting the virtue, and advancing the happiness of man" was said by Jefferson to Cornelius Camden Blatchly, 1822.<br>  <br>  The fifth part, "Enlighten the people generally, and tyranny and oppressions of body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day" was said by Jefferson to Pierre Samuel Du Pont de Nemours, 1816.<br>  <br>  The sixth part, "If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be" is from Jefferson's Letter to Colonel Charles Yancey, 1816.<br>  <br>  The last part, "No nation is permitted to live in ignorance with impunity," is from Thomas Jefferson, Virginia Board of Visitors Minutes, 1821.<br>  <br>  The theme of all these statements by Jefferson is...

In this exte|`|SIhxrxD3aa	The first answer would have been fantastic if you'd asked about vet tech.  But you didn't, you asked about veterinarian.<br>  <br>  It takes 6-8 years to become a veterinarian and for about 90% of people it will take all 8 years.  It is possible to be accepted into vet school without a bachelor's degree, but it's very difficult.  Each vet school requires about 2 years worth of pre-requisites before you can be admitted into vet school.  About 10% of people are accepted after only these 2 years.  Most people go on and pursue a bachelor's degree because it's easier to be accepted with a degree.  This 4 years would be taking classes full-time<br>  Vet school is 4 years and your only option is full-time.<br>  <br>  Every vet school's pre-requisites will vary, but here's a rough idea of the classes you'd need to take.<br>  2 semesters of general chemistry (with labs)<br>  1-2 semesters of organic chemistry (with labs)<br>  Most schools require 1 semester of biochemistry (with labs)<br>  1-2 semesters of general biology (with labs)<br>  1 semester of microbiology (with lab)<br>  1 semester of genetics (sometimes a lab is required)<br>  Some schools require more advanced biology courses as well like cell biology or embryology<br>  2 semesters of physics (with lab)<br>  Some schools require a semester of calculus and/or statistics<br>  Some schools require a semester of general animal science and a semester of animal nutrition.<br>  2 semesters of english/composition<br>  1 semester of public speaking<br>  3-4 courses in social sciences/humanities<br>  <br>  That list above is not all inclusive and as you can see it can vary a lot between schools.  For the exact requirements for the school(s) you're interested in you can go here:<br>  <a href="http://www.aavmc.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.aavmc.org</a><br>  <br>  Once in vet school the classes only get harder.  But, the courses are more specific to veterinary medicine and you'll be able to see the relevance of the coursework right away.<br>  In vet school a common curriculum will include the following:<br>  Gross anatomy<br>  Microanatomy<br>  Physiology<br>  Epidemiology<br>  Immunology<br>  Ethics/veterinary law course<br>  Parasitology<br>  Bacteriology<br>  Virology<br>  Pathology<br>  Pharmacology<br>  Medicine courses (food animal, zoo, production, etc.)<br>  Surgery courses<br>  Zoonotic diseases<br>  Radiology<br>  Theriogenology<br>  And then your 4th year is entirely clinical.<br>  <br>  As far as cost, it's very expensive.<br>  The average debt that vet students graduate with is around $200,000 total.<br>  If you can go to vet school in-state, then that's your cheapest option.  However, I am in-state and I'll still graduate with around $140,000 (from vet school alone).<br>  There are very few scholarships for vet students and those out there require you to agree to work in a specific area or for a specific company after graduating.  The army will pay your tuition throught the health profession's scholarship, but that means 3 years of active duty and 5 years in the reserves.  Some states have programs where they will pay your tuition if you agree to work in an underserved area for a X amount of years after graduating.  <br>  <br>  All of the above information asumes that you're in the US.  If you're not, then ignore it because the US system of educating veterinarinans is very different then most other countries.

She slaughtered young girls without concience and drained them so she could drink their blood, or alternatively use it to bathe in 'blood-baths', and thus preserving her looks. She also was the one who requested the help of a German clockmaker to design her a torture device, which drained the blood of young girls through a series of sharp spikes and ran into channels ready for the Countess to drink.

AA12145338	Universities look for over all well rounded person. Good grades, AP courses, active in clubs/sports at school (holding an officer's position is better), community service. Essays are a must for top notch Universities and Colleges and most scholarships, please do your best in English and Composition. Good Luck!|`|SKhL0PPTaa	It's stressful. Very, very stressful. You are trying to keep grades up, do extracurriculars, apply to colleges, and apply for scholarships - all at the same time.  <br>  <br>  Figure out what you want to study in college. It doesn't have to be specific, just 'I want to do something artsy' or 'I want to do something sciencey'. Then take the classes that will make you appealing to schools with an art or science focus.<br>  <br>  Extracurricular-wise, it doesn't really matter. Find things that you really enjoy doing. Get involved with one or two clubs and stick with them. Do a sport. Learn to play an instrument. *Do community service work* A huge number of scholarships and colleges want to know if you have done any, and you want to be able to say 'yes, I have'. <br>  <br>  Really truly though, don't stress yet. Your grades don't start counting really until about halfway through sophomore year. Keep them as high as you can. Good luck with high school.|`|ACksTjZIaa	I am a senior in high school waiting for my admission decisions to come in the mail, so I have some good tips for you.<br>  1. Of course you want to take as many honors and AP classes as you can. Try to especially take classes that will benefit what you want to major in (example: take AP Biology, AP Physics, and AP Chemistry if you want to go on the PreMed track) And of course get good grades!<br>  <br>  2. Get involved in your school. Whether it is making a club, playing sports, singing, theater, student council, band, orchestra, drum-line....do as many things as you can<br>  <br>  3. Do community service. Schools love this. And do it during summers and school year. You can pick the local library, hospital, YMCA....there are many places who love free help. It will benefit you the most if you volunteer places that connect with your future college major (example: work in a hospital if you want to be a doctor or go on the PreMed track)<br>  <br>  4. Start studying for the SAT and/or ACT as soon as possible. Even if you decide to take it junior and/or senior year. The more practice, the better you get. If you are wealthy, get a college counselor and/or take SAT classes. It helps a lot for some people<br>  <br>  5. Take college classes at a community college. Colleges love to see that you go the extra mile and take extra harder classes at another school. Even if you take a couple it looks good, but the more the better.<br>  <br>  6. Play an instrument (Ex. piano, harp)<br>  <br>  This is all the tips I could think of off the top of my head. I did it all and I am just waiting for the admission letters!<br>  <br>  On the topic of applying to colleges, it is complete hell. My advice would be to start applications the summer before senior year. Expect different essays from every school you apply to. You will have a horrible first semester during senior year. But i wish you the best of luck and I hope these tipes will help you get into the school of your dreams!
wJSYSgIlaa	Reminds me of Socrates saying "A life unexamined is not worth living".<br>  <br>  For me, the true meaning to be alive is to be able to do something about what's going on around you. I believe that in our own little way, we can make a difference in this world. If you continue living like, "everybody's doing it (even if it's wrong) so i'll do it as well", we're just like bodies without a soul. I believe indifference just breeds injustice. We have to speak up if there's something wrong or we're just the ones who'll suffer later.<br>  <br>  Sorry too much cliche. Can't think of better way to put my thoughts together.

SPxckhNtaa	The key to a good white russian is to shake the cream before pouring it over the rest of the cocktail. This will help thicken the drink. Most people overlook this step because they feel that Kahlua is thick enough. Speaking of which, don't make the mistake of thinking you have to use Kahlua. If you look around the liquor section of your Kroger, you can find other coffee-based drinks you can use in this cocktail.

If you're really scared of getting married and.or having kids then don't. Wait until you feel right about it. Don't rush yourself into a relationship because of someone else. All mothers want to be grandmothers when their kids are grown up but usually they will understand when you don't want them. Just trust your heart and you should be fine. The only thing I wouldn't truly trust my heart with would be love. I've never trusted my heart when it comes to men/guys/boys.<br>  <br>  Hope This Helped!

OJtZRHTMaa	(*cough* grammar...)<br>  <br>  You're talking about a book, and even though the era was in the past, the book is not. The setting doesn't change. I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to say... when you say the era, are you trying to say the setting? The second one makes more sense, but change the was to is. Also, I don't know if this is a book or a poem/essay, but if it's a book it should be italicized or underlined. And also, the years shouldn't have apostrophes in them. It should just be 1960s and 1970s. You may want to phrase it a little differently to make it sound less awkward too. Something along the lines of "The 'Secrets in the Fire' took place in Africa in the 1960s through the 1970s." (and if you're sayings 1960s to 1970s, it should probably be the 1960s/1970s).<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|5c6671e8f478958f34681c2f7e863dc2aa	I'd say:<br>  "Secrets in the Fire" is set in Africa circa 1960-1970.<br>  <br>  "circa" means basically "around that time"

JQKADWyzaa	My school doesn't. I've taken three classes and none of them have bumped up my grade. It seems to me though  that the AP test is pretty foolproof.

It takes a whole year of the work|`|e4b32e33b8c5f290f2ac40c695f487f2aa	A few teachers in my school used to do this, but they stopped after a bunch of kids kept failing the class, then studying to get a five and thus an A in the class, rather than an F.  So, I think it's a good policy regarding how students take advantage of it in such a bad way.|`|c2f9617e59062c6f3782e4ecaa4a42b5aa	Yeah, but only by a letter grade. So if you had a B in the class and get a 5, they bump it to an A, and if you had a C it would become a B.  That way you don't get like people going from Ds to As.  I think its a great policy; it makes people really study for the APs, but not slack of during the year too much.  :( unfortunately only one class does it in my school, and I dont take that class.

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	One of the interesting things about life is that the more you learn, the more you realize that you didn't actually know after all.  I've had students tell me that they have always read the Wall Street Journal daily, and assumed they knew what it was talking about, but after taking my class, they realized that in fact they had previously been skimming over the parts they didn't understand without noticing it, because after the class, they were suddenly aware of all the things in there that they had only learned in the class.<br>  <br>  I've been teaching for 30 years now, and when I first started doing so, I thought I knew a lot about my subject matter.  After getting a Ph.D. and learning about the discipline for decades, I'm embarrassed that I used to think I knew anything, because as much as I've learned, I've very much more aware now of all the things that I still don't know.  You know business management schools?  I've been teaching in them for 30 years and now I run one, and there's still a huge amount I don't know about business schools!<br>  <br>  What I'm trying to say is that life protects you when you don't know a lot by making you unaware of all you don't know yet.  Life will unfold over time, and by the time you are in 12th grade, you will laugh at how little you knew when you were in 7th grade.  I'm not saying that you aren't smart or that you aren't doing interesting things, but the only way this would make you "too mature" for your age is if you weren't enjoying it.  <br>  <br>  By the way, most of the people I went to school with in 7th grade "knew" exactly what they wanted to do when they became adults.  The problem was that by the time they became adults, they were not living in the same world, and the available choices were quite different.  Almost none of us are doing what we were so convinced we were going to do.  The world isn't likely to slow down any, so you may be surprised at the exciting careers available to you later on that you could not have conceived of in 2009.<br>  <br>  As to the relevance of plant or amoeba reproduction, the main point of all that is for you to learn how science works, which is extremely important in today's world.  You watch the stock channel.  Well, how will you be able to assess the value of biotech stocks if you don't understand what those companies are doing?<br>  <br>  Basically, I don't think you are too mature for your age.  You are probably a bright kid who occasionally feels out of place, just like the rest of us.|`|MTcxXWw3aa	yea but thats a good thing|`|57HnZfZ7aa	I believe you are definatly more mature then what i would expect from a 7th grader i dont know u personally so i cant say u are to mature for your age but u need to enjoy it while u can the sex jokes 24/7 are a big part of middle school (puberty starting) and high school and even college and when your an adult so dont try to escape that because you wont.

The concept of a university with different faculties for different subjects dates back to Al-Azhar University,[1] which had individual faculties for a Madrasah and theological seminary, Islamic law and jurisprudence, Arabic grammar, Islamic astronomy, early Islamic philosophy, and logic in Islamic philosophy.|`|zMD0VeOmaa	it's not true. also the word phallus comes to mind as it sounds similar.|`|TX5uV9bIaa	It's not true!|`|QbJ04Zqiaa	It's a lie.

dtcRLnshaa	My daughter'd guidance counselor had us check out a book by Rugg's. It is in the library section that has the big college handbooks by Peterson, Barrons, etc as well as how to study for SAT's , ACT etc. This individual rates the top programs in various schools. The best way to understand his approach is to read the forward. She went to the majors she was considering and hylighted the colleges she might consider. They she looked to see if any overlapped and were all at the same school. It breaks them down by major and then by how selective the colleges are.  For us, it was a good place to start because it also tells you what state the school is in. Good Luck!
Dh0JX2Onaa	Nothing is certain about future college admissions.Do the best that you can and apply to Columbia. You have nothing to loose./|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	While that's a good ACT score, your GPA tells them you're lazy and/or unmotivated, and that doesn't look good for colleges.  Without some outstanding activity on your resume, you really don't have a shot at Columbia - the ivies turn down thousands of straight-A students, valedictorians, and perfect SAT scorers every year.  You'll be competing with those students.<br>  <br>  If you had a 2.6 for 3 semesters, and get nothing but A's from now on, taking the same number of classes every semester, your highest possible GPA when you apply to colleges is (2.6 * 3 + 4.0 * 3) / 6 = 3.3 GPA.|`|jiBMFeihaa	Your a sophomore. You have more then a enough time.|`|6ccd4882dc74fe3bac069fc84fb4af63aa	The second answerer's right.  A 31-32 is a very good score for a sophomore, and your GPA should reflect that (by being 3.75 or higher).  Like you said, I'm pretty sure you are very intelligent, and if you just pushed yourself a little, you could probably get amazing grades.  If your school does weighted GPA's for Honors and AP, you should definitely sign up for those, but if you lack motivation to study, you shouldn't sign up for them just because they're Honors or AP classes; you should sign up for them only if you have a true interest and only if you know you'll be willing to study for at least 1-2 hours a night for that class.  <br>  <br>  As for motivating yourself, you'll have to think negatively!  I'm sorry, but a 2.5 won't get you into anywhere, let alone a prestigious Ivy League!  So if you want to motivate yourself to study harder, think, "If I don't get my GPA up, no Ivy League school!  I won't be able to get into any college.  I'll have to work as a janitor, cleaning up puke for the rest of my life."  I know it's harsh, but it does work as a motivator.  Good luck.

All dependant on what degree you choose. Right now public health is a great degree plan and it pays the most from what I know. I am working on my BS and am making 46k working in safety (public health) my boss who is working on his DrPH (doctor public health) makes 100k. This is working for the state.

Kemudian buat comitmen dalam diri anda bahwa anda pasti bisa dalam sebulan mampu. Jadi modal awal letakkan diri anda dalam situasi kritis hanya sebulan kesempatan belajar kalau tidak anggap anda diultimatum akan dieksekusi mati. Selanjutnya harus bertindak,yaitu belajar setiap saat baca,bicara dan menulis bahasa Inggris dengan dibantu kamus, berulang-ulang setiap ada kosakata baru catat dan ingat terus hafal secara berulang-ulang, latihan terus, kontinyu. Jika capek dan jenuh, ingat anda ada ultimatum satu bulan tidak bisa anda akan mati masa depan. Kemudian ikuti dengan tekun. Jadi ulangi:letakkan dalam kondisi kritis, bertindak dan tekun.

xSnMtUmraa	io mi chiamo GIULIA<br>  <br>  Deriva dal latino Iulia, che era il nome gentilizio di una antica e nobile famiglia romana, la Gens Iulia (il cui più illustre rappresentante fu Giulio Cesare), che si vantava di discendere da Giulio o Iulus (Iulo) o Ascanio, figlio di Enea. Se questa ipotesi fosse vera il nome potrebbe derivare dalla parola greca Julé ossia bosco, e quindi significare "del bosco"; infatti il secondo nome del figlio di Enea era Silvio ossia "della selva", quindi "del bosco o della foresta".

Fg5qosaSaa	It's SO great you want to help your cousin out. Can you even imagine how hard it'd be to want to convey something and not be able to?<br>  <br>  I'd recommend the DVDs "Signing Time." I'm not sure about the ones from Target as I haven't seen them but they could be good. It's worth a try, at least.<br>  <br>  Also start with signs that are useful. Makes sense, but some people try to teach signs that aren't really useful at all. "More" "please" (which you already taught her =)) "no" "yes" "happy" "sad" "food" "drink" are good starters. You can start with www.aslpro.com (online dictionary) if you don't want to wait for the Signing Time videos to arrive from Amazon. (Some bookstores sell them as well, but I'm not sure which.)<br>  <br>  Youtube "Sesame Street sign language" or "Sesame Street ASL" or "Sesame Street Linda Bove." <br>  <br>  It's amazing how great Sesame Street works- it's not boring and the child can watch it and then practice with others afterwards! I 100% recommend Sesame Street.<br>  <br>  Another idea for communication is to get a board with pictures- so she can point to what she wants. Or look up "augmentative communication." These are computers that can be programmed to speak. You can often try a trial for free if you contact the company or talk to her school. Special needs children are definitely able to use these. (Look up Dynavox or go to www.lovethatmax.blogspot.com)  Also, speech therapy can really help. If her voice is too quiet because of low tone in muscles, try buying a kids' portable microphone with speakers. My disabled cousin has celebral palsy and brain damage; she LOVES the microphone since it amplifies her voice. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure how developmentally disabled your cousin is but ASL is definitely a GREAT way to go!<br>  <br>  Just keep repeating- helping her sign, making her sign before she can get anything. For example, teach her "cookie" then make her sign "cookie" before she can get a cookie... also make it fun, like with games or signing as you speak. Don't worry if she signs the signs wrong or differently, as long as she's near and is trying. <br>  <br>  If you can manage to dig up any Bravo Family videos, those are good for *you* and her family to learn sign.<br>  <br>  Sorry this is so long.<br>  Good luck!! =) If you want or need more help, feel free to email me|`|pvosPN40aa	repetition is the best way to learn ASL. Depending on how old she is, start with basic words and numbers. Use visual aids and miming|`|AA12367392	My mother taught me to sign but only through the alphabet, there are moves that you can do that just express something with just one movement of the hand, those I can't remember, but you can always just show him the alphabet then a picture of the letter, their are also braille libraries they are awesome, I don't know how to read it but its fun to learn, see if theres a library near you or ask at the schools, because they would be able to help you where to go, goodluck! :)

What i suggest is join a group outside of school, sport, music or even a gym, somewhere where you can meet other younger ppl and enjoy doing what you like at the same time. Don't spend all your time on a computer hiding from ppl.

244Txwu6aa	Being a candidate for accreditation means that they are in the middle of the accreditation process and have already undergone a fairly rigorous examination by the agency but haven't finished the complete cycle yet.  Usually once a college is a candidate the final accreditation follows within 12-18 months.  I would look at it as a positive that the college has chosen to undergo such a complete examination of its procedures.  <br>  As for whether or not it should affect your decision to apply to the school - it is up to you but, for the student, accreditation usually mostly affects the ability to transfer credits and once the college is even a candidate that is usually not a factor any more.  The most important factors should be whether or not the college has a good reputation and a solid program in the area you wish to study.|`|AA11286626	You really should talk to someone in the field who hires people. <br>  Not all fields require big name colleges.<br>  Good luck|`|n9av5rxCaa	??? ???? ?? ?????

cAaNsGguaa	Just because most of the students are from the same state doesn't mean they are going to know each other! <br>  <br>  Schools usually go out of there way to make their freshmen comfortable and to make sure they're meeting people. I can't imagine it would be any more difficult to make friends than if the school had students from all over. <br>  <br>  The one thing that you do want to look for is the statistics on how many students are residents on campus vs commuters. It is a little more difficult to make friends at commuter schools since most students live close to campus and go home after classes. <br>  <br>  If you really want to get a good sense of how you fit in on campus, go on a campus visit! It's a great opportunity to see how you fit in and what the students are like.|`|vyVDWIehaa	At commuter schools it might be harder to make friends as most students drive to campus and will still largely hang out with their high school friends.  But neither of those schools are commuter schools.  Also, people who go to non-commuter schools never end up hanging out with their high school friends who go to the same school.  You'll be fine.<br>  <br>  I was from out of state too and I went to a school that was about 90% in state.  I think the whole time I was there I met one guy who commuted.

Once you have T3 you can work out T4 and so on. The arithmetic is very simple.<br>  <br>  Hint: T6 = 8

Zg1ih6gcaa	There are some programs like that.  They're sometimes called accelerated or fast track for people who already have degrees.  You'll still have to take the science pre-reqs that you haven't previously taken however.<br>  <br>  Oops, guess I could answer the rest of your questions too huh?  Yes, there is a test, it's called the NCLEX and it's a national licensure exam that you'd take after graduation from nursing school.  You don't need to have a BSN to be a nurse.  I've heard people say it's better to have a BSN but I'm not totally sure I believe them after seeing the associate degree nurses in the hospital doing much of the same things the BSN's do.|`|DuGAysygaa	Yep, have sex with a doctor.|`|5d1uZn1Yaa	You may need a little more training in the medical field. There are colleges out there (even online colleges!) that will help you get qualified in less than 2 years. Although from what you state, you may finish in a much shorter time. I believe after you finish your courses, you would need to be state and nationally licensed (which i believe is a series of multiple choice tests, which you need to make a passing grade on in order to get your nursing license), which shouldn't take long to complete.|`|J7EWQHYJaa	It's best to go straight to the appropriate department of whichever university that offers the program and ask the advisors or whoever has that knowledge.|`|7SNPAJm4aa	Aww, hope I will help. How has the job search been with your B.A in liberal Arts? You also have a science degree? Not sure which country you're in, but some nursing schs have accelerated programs in which you can finish in 2 yrs, 2 and a half or 3yrs -if you already have a degree, or even if you don't have a degree but have taken some post-secondary courses. There's a sch here in that if you have 10 post-secondary courses (university courses), you can get into the accelerated program and finish in 2 and a half yrs. And I was accepted into it (and was in the program for a year), but decided not to continue for personal reasons. Now I'm considering going back. So you can do it. The fact that you already have a degree works even better to your advantage because that's what a lot of these schs that offer accelerated programs are looking for. So find out which nursing schs in your area allow you to finish in less than 4 yrs and apply to them. And no, you do not need to have taken Physio, chem, anatomy, etc. You will take those along with the other students in the accelerated program when you get in, so don't worry about that. I hadn't taken them when I applied and still got in. You said you've taken statistics, which is good. In the program I was in, there was a course simiIar to Stats (think it was a Psychology course) and if you've taken Stats in your previous sch or a similar course, you'll get transfer credit for it, so you would not have to take that Psych course when you get it. But when you get accepted, you can find this out. Every nursing sch's different, so you may not even have to worry about this. I didn't take those and got accepted. I did have courses like Psych, Soc, etc. You also need to send them your high sch transcripts, so I hope you've taken Bio in high sch and Chemistry too (and passed them), because they're required. Biology in high sch is a must. I'm not sure if every nursing sch wants you to have taken Chemistry, but I'm pretty sure it's needed because in first year you will take a nutrition course that's based on Chemistry and, they would like you to have had a previous knowledge in Chemistry. Any more questions, ask me, would be glad to help. My profile is not open for email/contacts, but I will come back and check your question, so if you want to contact me, just write it as an "added detail" under your question and I will open my profile for you and you can contact me that way. Which country are you located? Any questions, let me know.<br>  Cheers.

cAaNsGguaa	If you're interested in being a news reporter, I would definitely recommend majoring in journalism! I'm a journalism major and did have to apply into the program at my school after being accepted into my liberal arts college (the journalism department only takes a limited number of students since the job market is so bad), but I'm not sure how it works at other schools. <br>  <br>  When you're in a liberal arts college, you take some general requirements (math and science, etc) and then there will be courses required for your major and electives you can take within your major. There's really no way to tell you what classes you should take until you know more about your college and your interests. And a lot of it will be decided for you by the program directors. <br>  <br>  Also, you'll have to meet with your major advisor several times, and they will be able to help you our with your decision<br>  <br>  Honestly, it's not really that important what classes you take in high school about journalism or related fields. <br>  <br>  And, for the record, you can start out as a reporter. Just make sure the schools you're applying to have journalism schools or departments.
b6c083e8702dbef9e8f370340bd74453aa	Will you be teaching mostly High School, or Elementary?  I would have some really good writing assignments up your sleeve.  I would also carry around a copy of Roddy Doyle's book "The Giggler Treatment".  It's good to use as a read aloud for students up to Grade 6, it's very funny, and it is a quick read.  Learn some good Math games like Bus Stop (otherwise known as Around the World).  Get the picture book "One grain of rice".  This can be used in High School and Elementary school.  It looks at exponential growth.  There are lessons online for this book.  You can tailor the lesson to the grade level.  Have a few Drama and PE games in your repertoire.  A good art project is to have the students draw an everyday object from memory, and then from observation.  Finally, they draw the object and turn it into a comic book-type character and write a story with the character as its main character.  Learn some games to help you learn the kids' names.  You could have the kids debate something like "there should be no homework in Grade ____".  This depends on the grade of the students (wouldn't work well for younger kids). <br>  <br>  Good filler games - Silent ball, Four corners.<br>  <br>  I also agree with one of the above posts.  You need to have a good behaviour system.  Usually the teacher will have one, but sometimes what works for one person does not work for the other.  Make your expectations very clear right away.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fPOg9DuXaa	Come with a few extra things to do in case activities run short. Have your favorite book in your bag so that if you have some extra time you are not scrambling around the room for something to do. You can appear in control and take out your reading if there is extra time. <br>  <br>  Students are generally not on their best behavior when the substitute is in the room. Sometimes they need a little extra incentive. Have something to entice them with. I know the most successful substitutes rely on the teacher's behavior system, but supplement it a little for that day. For example, have a special treat/ privledge for the end of the day for the top few 'stars' throughout the day. Hold that over them the whole day. In line "I'm still looking for my stars..." While reading and students are getting squirmy, "I'm still looking for those stars. I think I found one. I'll keep my eye on him/her." The suspense will keep them with you. <br>  <br>  Communicate with the teacher. So many times when I get back from having a sub, there is no info about anything that happened! The kids are telling me, he hit her, he said a bad word, etc. etc., but the sub didn't tell me anything. That's why kids think they can get away with anything when the sub is there- because when the sub gets back, there is no consequence for what happened. Let the teacher know what happened so they can follow up on it for you. And, let the kids know that you are keeping track for their teacher. This will help. <br>  <br>  Learn some little games that can be done if there is any down time while waiting in line, for recess, etc. Mental math is a great (and adaptable for any grade). Just say, 2.... plus 1..... minus 1.... plus 10.... etc, etc. and have students raise hands to give answers.|`|azO0V5kTaa	Some great answers from others -  however,  since I don't know what and where you will be subbing  there are some excellent books  actually called "Bag of Tricks" for subs.

In that case, I would suggest that you bring in a folk song or a song with lots of meat to it, one that you can play for the students and have them create some great discussions about the meaning or opinions of the writer of the song.  You could have them explore the history of the song or the life of the person in the song... <br>  I say bring a song that you could play from a CD because kids love songs and are always curious about music.  They would love to know more about the classics too.  Besides, listening to a great song over and over is a great way to pass the time.|`|KToEYmwWaa	Something that makes the kids feel like they are getting away with something.  I remember when I was a kid and we had a sub we did everything in our power to make her miserable...unless, she make it worth it for us to me kind to her.

zCOvQwQhaa	They don't - saying "all wealthy people" can't be correct since there's a wide diversity among both the people and what is considered to be "wealthy".<br>  <br>  It's very possible that the degree is not the source of the wealth at all but instead that those people that are conditioned/motivated to achieve wealth are also conditioned/motivated to seek a higher education.<br>  <br>  Some people will tell you that if you go to college and get a degree that you will make more money.  If you don't go to college and get a degree then you won't make much money.<br>  <br>  We know this isn't exactly true as an absolute statement because there are examples of millionaires/billionaires who didn't graduate from college and there are examples of destitute homelessness that did graduate from college.<br>  <br>  BUT - there is plenty of evidence that shows that the more education you get, the more you can expect to earn; generally - when looking at the whole population.  Your chances of success (as we tend to define success) are higher with the degree then without.  There are no guarantees though.<br>  <br>  This is probably because all of that information that you learn throughout your education (no matter how unimportant it may seem right now) adds to your available knowledge.  Knowledge and skill are generally rewarded better than is ignorance and ineptitude.<br>  <br>  But, again, drive and motivation is often rewarded even better and someone with all of the knowledge in the world but no motivation to do anything with it won't earn much.  The person with strong drive and motivation will work to overcome the lack of knowledge.<br>  <br>  --------<br>  <br>  The Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts are types of degrees and have little to do with the subject studied.  You can get a Bachelor of Science in Music and a Bachelor of Arts in Biology.  These can be earned in just about any subject that can be studied.<br>  <br>  What makes it a BA or BS is the percentage of coursework done in the liberal arts (why of things) versus applied sciences (how to of the world); not the subject that was studied.  You see more people with a BA or BS than most other degrees because these are the degrees most colleges issue to the most students.  They are simply the most common degrees in the US.|`|2HMaRuihaa	If you're looking for wealth in life, you're looking for the wrong thing.

Look for the link that says "databases", "Find articles", or "Electronic resources". <br>  <br>  If you have a public library card (or can go in person to the library) then you can also use the databases from that library Web site.

The librarian can give you more help with search strategies and selecting the appropriate databases.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	It will depend on the field, but some can be found online - places like PubMed for medical fields and <a href="http://www.arxiv.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.arxiv.org</a> for the physical sciences.

IFL3GcM9aa	It really depends on the college and the degree.  However, odds are you don't have to learn everything about computers to get a particular career in computers.  While you need to understand something about hardware, computer hardware people usually have a different degree, and sometimes are in a completely different department (such as electronics or engineering) from programmers.  It takes a lot of different people with a lot of different skills to create video games.  <br>  <br>  Check with your local colleges.  Don't forget to check with community colleges.  See what programs they offer.

With the increasing economic power of the middle- and lower-income populace since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century, artists created various new diversions to answer the needs of these groups. These have included pulp novels and comic books, film, television, advertising, "collectibles," and tract housing. These have taken the place among the bourgeois once taken among the aristocracy by literature, opera, theater, academic painting, sculpture, and architecture. But modernist artists rarely cultivated the popular success of these new cultural forms. Modernist works were little appreciated outside of a small elite. Life magazine's 1950s articles on the abstract expressionist Jackson Pollock (American, 1912-1956), and the silkscreened paintings by Andy Warhol (American, 1928?-1987) of soup cans and celebrities signaled unprecedented fusions between high and low art and the transition to the postmodern age.<br>  <br>  (more........)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Pon.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Pon.html</a><br>  <br>  refers to cultural items or styles that are are well known and generally accepted but not always accepted by the vast majority of society.

This is often defined or determined by the mass media. Popular culture is deemed as what is popular within the social context – that of which is most strongly represented by what is perceived to be popularly accepted among society. Otherwise, popular culture is also suggested to be the widespread cultural elements in any given society that are perpetuated through that society's vernacular language or lingua franca.<br>  <br>  It comprises the daily interactions, needs and desires and cultural 'moments' that make up the everyday lives of the mainstream. It can include any number of practices, ideas or memes on various subjects such as cooking, clothing, consumption, mass media and the many facets of entertainment such as sports and literature. Popular culture often contrasts with a more exclusive, even elitist "high culture",[1] that is, the culture of ruling social groups.[2] The earliest use of "popular" in English was during the fifteenth century in law and politics, meaning "low", "base", "vulgar", and "of the common people" 'til the late eighteenth century by which time it began to mean "widespread" and gain in positive connotation. <br>  <br>  (more.........)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/popular%20culture" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/popular%20culture</a>|`|r5Mxre6Saa	Popular culture<br>  American popular culture has expressed itself through nearly every medium, including movies, music, and sports. Mickey Mouse, Barbie, Elvis Presley, Madonna, Aerosmith, Babe Ruth, Baseball, American football, Basketball, screwball comedy, G.I. Joe, jazz, the blues, Rap & Hip Hop, The Simpsons, Michael Jackson, Superman, Gone with the Wind, Marilyn Monroe, Michael Jordan, Indiana Jones, Sesame Street, Catch-22—these names, genres, and phrases have joined more tangible American products in spreading across the globe.<br>  <br>  It is worth noting that while the U.S. tends to be a net exporter of culture, it absorbs many other cultural traditions with relative ease, for example: origami, soccer, anime, and yoga.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Exportation of popular culture<br>  The United States is an enormous exporter of entertainment, especially television, movies and music. This readily consumable form of culture is widely and cheaply dispersed for entertainment consumers worldwide. It's even considered to be an "entertainment superpower" along with Europe, and Japan. Part of this is because America owns so much foreign property[citation needed] and has so many military personnel serving overseas (Japan for instance).[citation needed]<br>  <br>  Many nations now have two cultures: an indigenous one and globalized/popular culture[citation needed]. That said, what one society considers entertainment is not necessarily reflective of the "true culture" of its people. More popular syndicated programs cost more, so overseas entertainment purchasers often choose older programs that reflect various, and dated, stages of United States cultural development.[citation needed] Pop culture also tends to neglect the more mundane and/or complex elements of human life.[citation needed]

eG7rb1Kbaa	1. The requirements for home school vary on state home school laws.<br>  <br>  2. This depends on your curriculum. You can either enroll online, or have a textbook curriculum.<br>  <br>  3. No, you get up when you want.<br>  <br>  4. The length of time per day varies. It varies depending on the number of subjects, length of assignment, and time took to complete the subject.<br>  <br>  5. If you enroll with an online school, you usually pay tuition. If you're doing your own curriculum, you would have to buy textbooks and standard school supplies.<br>  <br>  You would also have to pay a fee for the final exam at the end of the year.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	It all depends on which way you want to go with homeschooling.<br>  Homeschooling is where the parent(s) or other adult teaches you. This part can be quite expensive. Reaching into the thousands. Still you can find some ways of cutting costs by using used books and stuff. Plus you get to choose your own curriculum.<br>  Charter/Virtual schools are where you are taught by a teacher who is 'sent' to you via internet. The school charges no fee since they are funded by the state. You are supplied a computer or laptop (depending), a printer, books and other necessities.<br>  My son goes to a virtual school and some days are 3 hours and some are 5. It all depends on your pace. You don't have to get up at a certain time unless of course the virtual school my sons attends has classes that he has to meet at certain times. Also in my state he has to have a minimum of 25 hours a week. So if he misses a day he can always make up for it on Saturday. (Not that I recommend that) lol<br>  It can be hard or easy. <br>  Best thing about it is that you can work at your own pace and not be stressed out as much if you were in a public school setting.<br>  Hope this helps you out~|`|CsRokAMkaa	The requirements vary depending on your state. Many states require 180 days or 900 hours (which adds up to 5 hours a day).<br>  Here is a website that can tell you the legal requirements in your state:<br>  <a href="http://www.hslda.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.hslda.org</a> <br>  You can get your school books from different suppliers. There are some companies that use the computer to teach. One for math is <a href="http://www.teachingtextbooks.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.teachingtextbooks.com</a><br>  Here is a good company to get science materials from<br>  <a href="http://www.highschoolscience.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.highschoolscience.com/</a><br>  You can also use library books or  online classes.<br>  <br>  You won't have any fees except for your books. Some states require the school district to loan you the books you need.<br>  <br>  You will have to wake up whenever your mom tells you to. That is one thing about homeschooling: an adult has to be in charge of you. You have to cooperate with your mom just like you do your other teachers or it won't work. <br>  <br>  I think homeschooling is easier in some ways because you don't have the distractions during the day of going from class to class or peer pressure.|`|cMZEmpp0aa	1) Requirements vary depending on where you're homeschooling. You need to check your own state's laws and your own district's regulations to see what requirements you might have to meet.'<br>  <br>  2) That's up to you and your mom. I didn't use an online program, but many people seem to find them helpful. One of the major benefits of homeschooling is the ability to choose an educational method that works for YOU, not for someone else. <br>  <br>  3) Also up to you, since you get to decide your schedule.<br>  <br>  4) Again, you get to decide your own schedule.<br>  <br>  5) This depends very much on the materials you choose to use and where you get them. For example, if you use brand-new textbooks it will cost you a lot more than if you don't use textbooks at all, if you get them used, or if you can borrow them from your district or other homeschoolers.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	There are legal requirements, which vary from state to state.<br>  <br>  Homeschooling generally involves a parent doing the teaching, though there are some virtual programs that are done via computer.  Public school at home, done via the computer, is also called Virtual School.<br>  <br>  What time you get up depends on the requirements your mother/teacher has for you.  While sleeping in is not a bad thing, you do need some sort of structure to your day so getting up at a certain time is a good thing.<br>  <br>  How long you work depends on a variety of factors-the laws in your state (some require a certain number of hours), and most imporantly how hard and well you work.<br>  <br>  Homeschooling is not the easy way out, though it is more natural and comfortable.  <br>  <br>  The costs involved with homeschooling depends on a variety of factors.<br>  <br>  I really think you are wondering about the public school at home virtual school, and not true homeschooling.

ndSzlZKxaa	?Hi There<br>  ?I found this article very helpful.? Hope it does the same to you as well.? <br>  ?Regards<br>  ?<br>  I DON'T CARE IF YOU ARE LAZIEST PERSON WHO EVER DREW A BREATH If you just can't get yourself to do what you need to do, if your willpower and persistence always seems to fizzle out, then check out the new paradigm in personal growth. Click here to learn about it now...<br>   ?=======================================...<br>   Tips to Empower Yourself<br>   <br>   Everybody desires success in life.? Success is defined as the complete attainment of the goals that a person has long planned, like a journey where a person starts taking one single step at a time before he finally achieves his tasks. A certain level of personal development, personal growth and self-improvement helps you to achieve goals and attain success in your life. These ingredients enrich your relationships, career prospects, professional success and life in general. Personal development, personal growth and self-improvement techniques are inter-related and help you to improve your personal and professional management techniques. With hard work, discipline, and careful planning, being successful can easily be attained.<br>   <br>   Succeeding Through Optimism<br>   <br>   Do you know that your body and mind react a lot in the way you think? If you think you want something in life, you will get it, though it may take some time. Your body works on energy systems and energy flow, the more positive it is, the more you feel positive and the more positive things happen for you. Yes it is true. So if you want success in life, it has to start with a positive attitude.? A negative attitude stands as a stumbling block in anything and everything you do in life. It vaporizes the much-needed energy associated with attaining your goals. Positive attitude on the other hand keeps your creative ideas flowing and makes you feel energetic to move forward towards your goals.<br>   <br>   Stress management<br>   ???<br>   Almost everybody is complaining that they are stressed out, tired and stretched to their limits.? If that is so, why don’t they take a much needed break?? If they feel tired and stressed, there’s no use in forcing themselves to become productive because for sure, with the state of mind that they are in, they won’t go near being productive and successful.<br>   ???<br>   Stress challenges everyone in life. If you buckle down under stress you would not be able to achieve anything in life. If you let stress overrule you completing even simplest tasks would pose a great challenge. There are many stress relieving techniques you could learn to overcome stress and meet life’s challenges in order to meet your goals.<br>   <br>   Building Self Confidence<br>   <br>   Self-confidence means believing in oneself. A little boost in self-confidence allows you to take long strides towards achieving your goals in life.? A lack of self-confidence hinders personal growth. If you are one with low esteem and low self-confidence you should take steps to build your self-confidence before it is too late. People who lack self-confidence tend to have self-doubt, fear, inferiority complex, etc. If you want to be successful in life you need to overcome all these negative traits.<br>   <br>   Feed Your Soul<br>   ???<br>   Your body is not the only one who craves for food.? Your emotions and soul also needs to be fed, and you can do it by engaging in warm-hearting activities such as doing some volunteer work, spending time with your loved ones and family, taking care of a pet, etc.<br>   ???<br>   As long as you don’t deprive yourself of the simple yet priceless things in life, you can be sure that you won’t have a hard time seeing the positive side of life.? Learn to cherish and appreciate the simple things in life, and make it a habit to be optimistic, yet realistic at the same time.<br>   ?<br>   ========================================... <br>   In-home Behavior Modification Growing in Popularity Unique in-home programs can now help people to quickly end chronic depression & panic without drugs, wipe out food addictions, build self-esteem, quit smo king, get organized, increase sales, keep more earnings, eliminate pain, and much more.

YqZLy1DFaa	"Persecution it is a sad reality in every corner of the world." should be changed to "Persecution is a sad reality in every corner of the world." The first one is a sentence fragment. You also need to indent your paragraphs. At the end of the first paragraph you an apostrophe at the end Trail of Tears. You put: Trail of Tears'   It should be Trail of Tears with no apostrophe. Also, I'm not sure what Diff? ^^^ is and your teacher might not either. "Jews inferior, Hitler didn’t like them, and wanted to kill them." doesn't need a comma before and. I also don't think you can start a sentence like that. Do you mean "The Jews were inferior?  In the sentence "The thing that made each group similar and different was of the leader they had." You should change this sentence to "The thing that made each group similar and different was the leader they had."  In paragraph 4 I think you have a typo in the sentence "The Nazi’s used a phrase called “The Final Solution,” which meant for the Nazi regime to find and easier way" You put and easier way. I think you meant to put "an easier way" At the end of paragraph 4, in the sentence " Others would be burned to ashes in ovens, designed to burn humans." There is no need for a comma.  The sentence "Hate and hate crimes will always exist within our world, we cannot escape it, but we can fight against it." is a run-on sentence and should be changed to "Hate and hate crimes will always exist within our world. We cannot escape it, but we can fight against it." In the last paragraph you're talking in the present except for in one sentence. The sentence "Many people found it hard to believe the Jews because the events were too horrible for men and women to believe." does not belong in that paragraph. You should probably place it somewhere else in the essay since you are talking about the past in the other paragraphs. You can't be talking about the present in a paragraph and then out of nowhere have a sentence talking about something that occured in the past. It is irrelevant. You also need a period on the last sentence of the paragraph. Hope this helps. If you have any questions you can email me on here. Good luck with your essay! It is a good essay, very interesting.
ccT5wEbcaa	You can go to school on-line and not lose your day job (which is what I did).  I got my degree at an accredited online college and you can find them at www.wgu.edu.<br>  <br>  I was an accountant for a long, long time and finish their program for a post-bacc in teacher prep K-8.  I am licensed and teaching now.  It is a two year program, but I completed the program in about a year--you can work at your own pace and I stepped it up because I didn't feel I had the time to waste. <br>  <br>  While you don't need to be licensed to teach in a private school, they would probably look for either your having the license or working towards it.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

These opportunities are based on citizenship not heritage or ancestry.  <br>  <br>  If your ancestor was enrolled in a tribe, you'd have to contact the tribe they were enrolled in, get their enrollment information, find out if you qualify for enrollment, complete the enrollment requirements and submit all necessary paperwork to the tribe.

Even though much of the world’s oceans are still unexplored and unmapped, scuba diving allows ordinary people to discover and explore part of the underwater world.<br>  Scuba is the acronym for Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus.This equipment consists of a portable metal tank attached to the diver's back that supplies compressed air which allows people to stay underwater for extended periods of time. Scuba diving as a recreational sport has become extremely popular and people take scuba vacations nowadays. Recreational scuba diving uses only compressed air as the breathing mixture, is never done solo, does not exceed a depth of 40 metres and doesn’t require decompression stops.<br>  Other forms of diving, such as professional diving, used for military, governmental, commercial and scientific purposes, involves a specific mission for each dive and divers are paid to dive. Technical diving exceeds recreational limits but is not for profit. <br>  The nature of these other dives and the type of equipment used far exceed the boundaries of Recreational Scuba Diving. However, they add much to our knowledge of the vast uncharted, underwater world that lies all around us.|`|d3346d4431bf0f9cc0e6f3b97c6c1778aa	I would make only the changes shown below:<br>  <br>  A portable metal tank attached to the back of a diver supplies compressed air for people to stay underwater for great lengths of time.

AA11765949	Falcon Punch refers to Captain Falcon's neutral B attack. It is one of most powerful moves in all three Super Smash Bros. games, with the highest knockback of any of Falcon's attacks (including charged smashes). This move is one of the few attacks in the game that is more powerful than the Home-run Bat at high damages (and since Captain Falcon's home-run attack has an upward trajectory, it is always more useful), and thus players use it in Captain Falcon's world record Home-run Contest strategies.

89ab1554abb8b48fcd9577d80bac730eaa	Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies such as lakes, rivers, oceans, and groundwater caused by human activities, which can be harmful to organisms and plants which live in these water bodies.Although natural phenomena such as volcanoes, algae blooms, storms, and earthquakes also cause major changes in water quality and the ecological status of water, water is typically referred to as polluted when it impaired by anthropogenic contaminants and either does not support a human use (like serving as drinking water) or undergoes a marked shift in its ability to support its constituent biotic communities. Water pollution has many causes and characteristics. The primary sources of water pollution are generally grouped into two categories based on their point of origin. Point-source pollution refers to contaminants that enter a waterway through a discrete "point source". Examples of this category include discharges from a wastewater treatment plant, outfalls from a factory, leaking underground tanks, etc. The second primary category, non-point source pollution, refers to contamination that, as its name suggests, does not originate from a single discrete source. Non-point source pollution is often a cumulative affect of small amounts of contaminants gathered from a large area. Nutrient runoff in stormwater from sheet flow over an agricultural field, or metals and hydrocarbons from an area with high impervious surfaces and vehicular traffic are examples of non-point source pollution. The primary focus of legislation and efforts to curb water pollution for the past several decades was first aimed at point sources. As point sources have been effectively regulated, greater attention has come to be placed on non-point source contributions, especially in rapidly urbanizing/suburbanizing or developing areas.<br>  <br>  The specific contaminants leading to pollution in water include a wide spectrum of chemicals, pathogens, and physical or sensory changes. While many of the chemicals and substances that are regulated may be naturally occurring (iron, manganese, etc) the concentration is often the key in determining what is a natural component of water, and what is a contaminant. Many of the chemical substances are toxic. Pathogens can produce waterborne diseases in either human or animal hosts. Alteration of water's physical chemistry include acidity, electrical conductivity, temperature, and eutrophication. Eutrophication is the fertilisation of surface water by nutrients that were previously scarce. Water pollution is a major problem in the global context. It has been suggested that it is the leading worldwide cause of deaths and diseases, and that it accounts for thHealth impacts of water pollution <br>  <br>  It is a well-known fact that clean water is absolutely essential for healthy living. Adequate supply of fresh and clean drinking water is a basic need for all human beings on the earth, yet it has been observed that millions of people worldwide are deprived of this. <br>  <br>  Freshwater resources all over the world are threatened not only by over exploitation and poor management but also by ecological degradation. The main source of freshwater pollution can be attributed to discharge of untreated waste, dumping of industrial effluent, and run-off from agricultural fields. Industrial growth, urbanization and the increasing use of synthetic organic substances have serious and adverse impacts on freshwater bodies. It is a generally accepted fact that the developed countries suffer from problems of chemical discharge into the water sources mainly groundwater, while developing countries face problems of agricultural run-off in water sources. Polluted water like chemicals in drinking water causes problem to health and leads to water-borne diseases which can be prevented by taking measures can be taken even at the household level.<br>  <br>  <br>  Groundwater and its contamination <br>  <br>  Many areas of groundwater and surface water are now contaminated with heavy metals, POPs (persistent organic pollutants), and nutrients that have an adverse affect on health. Water-borne diseases and water-caused health problems are mostly due to inadequate and incompetent management of water resources. Safe water for all can only be assured when access, sustainability, and equity can be guaranteed. Access can be defined as the number of people who are guaranteed safe drinking water and sufficient quantities of it. There has to be an effort to sustain it, and there has to be a fair and equal distribution of water to all segments of the society. Urban areas generally have a higher coverage of safe water than the rural areas. Even within an area there is variation: areas that can pay for the services have access to safe water whereas areas that cannot pay for the services have to make do with water from hand pumps and other sources. <br>  <br>  In the urban areas water gets contaminated in many different ways, some of the most common reasons being leaky water pipe joints

2hJG4XgCaa	Probably the earliest concept of the "iron triangle" was on January 17, 1919 by Ralph Pulitzer. It was the post World War I era when Pulitzer wrote a statement referring to the Paris Peace Conference between the allied Governments. He stated, “Three forces are laboring for such a sinister peace: <br>  (1,) the bourbonism of politicians…; <br>  (2,) the materialism of industrial…; <br>  (3,) the militarism of professional soldiers…” and “If the Peace Conference is allowed to remain between governments instead of between peoples it is apt to degenerate…”<br>  <br>  In United States politics, the iron triangle is a term used by political scientists to describe the policy-making relationship among the congressional committees, the bureaucracy (executive) (sometimes called "government agencies"), and interest groups.

YUcl70rbaa	1) The Battle of the Granicus River in May 334 BC was the first of three major battles fought between Alexander the Great and the Persian Empire. Fought in Northwestern Asia Minor, near the site of Troy, it was here where Alexander defeated the forces of the Persian satraps of Asia Minor, including a large force of Greek mercenaries led by Memnon of Rhodes.<br>  <br>  The battle took place on the road from Abydos to Dascylium (near modern day Ergili, Turkey), at the crossing of the Granicus River (modern day Biga ?ay?).<br>  <br>  2)The Battle of Issus (or more commonly The Battle at Issus) occurred in southern Anatolia, in November 333 BC. The invading troops led by the young Alexander of Macedonia, outnumbered more than 2:1, defeated the army personally led by Darius III of Achaemenid Persia in the second great battle for primacy in Asia. After Alexander's forces successfully forced a crossing of the Hellespont (the Dardanelles) and defeated the Persian satraps in a prior encounter, the Battle of the Granicus, Darius took personal charge of his army, gathered a large army from the depths of the empire, and maneuvered to cut the Greek line of supply, requiring Alexander to countermarch his forces, setting the stage for the battle near the mouth of the Pinarus River and south of the village of Issus.<br>  <br>  3)The Siege of Tyre was orchestrated in 333 BC by Alexander the Great who set out to conquer Tyre, a strategic coastal base in the war between the Greeks and the Persians. Unable to storm the city, he blockaded Tyre for seven months, but Tyre held on.

There you will find everything you will need to know about home education laws in your state.  I think HSLDA's site lists 'home school friendly' colleges and universities; or maybe that's on the state home school association's website.  Some states are very home education friendly, some not.  <br>  <br>  I personally home school my son, but it is due to medical necessity.  I was very unsure about doing it; I really read as much unbiased info as I could find.  I even spoke with my child's doctors about it.  He told me that in his experience, kids that were home schooled were usually more self confident than their same age peers, and usually more mature.  Let's face it, ignorance is contagious.  If you are unhappy in school, but you are otherwise happy, I would say go for it.  Life is too short, even for a teenager, to be miserable.

They wrote the song for the disney movie "Mary Poppins". They got the title from the time when one of the brothers learned the word at summer camp in the Adirondack Mountains - it was a word only kids knew the meaning of and adults did not.Said Richard Sherman,"When we were little boys in the mid-1930's, we went to a summer camp in the Adirondack Mountains, where we were introduced to a very long word that had been passed down in many variations through many generations of kids. The word was first coined in 1918, and was supposed to be even bigger and harder to say than antidisestablishmentarianism. . . . The word as we first heard it was:<br>  super-<br>  cadja-<br>  flawjalistic-<br>  espealedojus." <br>  <br>  The Sherman Brothers wrote this for the Disney movie Mary Poppins. Robert Sherman Jr. explains the song's meaning:<br>  "Many people comment that this song is just a tongue twister and that there's nothing more to it. Actually, this song is integral to the plot of the Mary Poppins motion picture. When Mary, Bert and the children escape into the magic world of Bert's street pavement pastel drawing, the foursome shares a "supernatural" adventure. Mary Poppins then, with the greatest of subtlety, gives the children a special, undilutable keepsake, just before it rains and the magic world washes away. That keepsake is the word, "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious." The rain washes all the magic away, but because their collective memories remain intact, the children are able to keep a piece of Mary Poppins' magic. The word's repetition throughout the rest of the movie is evidence that Mary Poppins' magic is real, and not just a product of the children's imaginations. At the end of the movie, when Mr. Banks has lost everything, he looks down at the tuppence which his son had given him. He then utters Mary Poppins' word, a word he had heard his children say. Doing this serves as Mr. Banks's own baptism into the magical nanny's alternative perspective. Mr. Banks, it turns out is the protagonist of the Mary Poppins story. It is that word which becomes the key to his growth."|`|AA11765949	a nonsense word meaning fantastic; also called supercalifragilistic <br>     popularized by the movie 'Mary Poppins'|`|igLGjvXjaa	the Disney movie Mary Poppins...it's one of the songs she sings|`|Kswn0Aqcaa	Mary Poppins<3

3mAgM405aa	Besides setting all margins to 1", the most important criteria for setting up a professional resume besides relevant text, is "scanability." Here are some helpful tips:<br>  <br>  1. Place just below your identification header [your hame, address, phone, email address] any Conditional Warning Statement such as "Confidential Resume,"Do Not Contact Current Employer," etc.<br>  2. Always fill-in an Objectives category [just below the Conditional Warning Statement] and make sure that he Objective will contribute to the profitability of your future employer;<br>  3. Select a mono-type font such as Helvetica, Arial, Courier or Times Roman; do not select any cursive handwriting styles which cannot scanned;<br>  4. Keep font sizes within a range of 10 to 12 pts.;<br>  5. Avoid styling text with a justified alignment, keep it flushed left;<br>  6. Instead of using tabs to set up blocked text entries, generate a table and use the column and row settings accordingly;<br>  7. Do not place an i.d. picture anywhere on the resume, this is a major taboo due to discrimination issues;<br>  8. Do not place any graphic text [saved as .gifs] onto the resume since it may be overlooked during the scanning phase;<br>  9. List at the very end of the resume your interests which should include travel experiences, language skills, social interactions such as golf, team sports, tennis, etc.<br>  <br>  In conclusion, the above helpful hints were designed to allow ease of scanning of your resume into PDF which can then be text captured for seach purposes by your potential employer. If the original resume was created in Word, WordPerfect or Mac Appleworks, it can be Saved As a PDF file which then can be saved as an email attachment. Otherwise, you can simply use a scanner and scan a hard copy of the resume and then save as a PDF file. <br>  <br>  Failure to conform the resume to appropriate fonts and styles as outlined above will result in rejection of the resume simply due to the inability of the scanning device to properly index relevant resume entries.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

OsNS1sHlaa	Disagree, just because we have genes doesn't mean that we are no longer given a choice because we are naturally predisposed to do a action.  that takes far too much away from the fact that all humans have choices that determine their character because it is those choices that cause their lives to take a certain path and eventually end up creating a complex multidimensional human character.  Genetics has no ability in determining choice and therefore is irrelevant to the determination of character compared to experiences from nurture.  Human choice is the difference behind human development to higher cognitive function and animal's primitive nature and natural tendencies making it more crucial towards character development than nature<br>  <br>  EDIT: Just because two people share one element in common does not mean that they are therefore going to lead the exact same lives.  Being a twin, (that means that our genetics are identical) but living different experiences than my twin anyone I would ask will say that we are completely different.  For example, my brother is a professional snow-border and is very social, but I am just some kid that is not perfect in athletics, and has less of a social life.|`|SnDTQwGnaa	Is it too late to do your homework?|`|wYVJJbLPaa	I agree. Our reactions to our thoughts can change, but we are each born with a nature that does NOT change.<br>  <br>  For example: Two people can have horrible, abusive childhoods........yet one grows up to be a serial killer and the other grows up to start a charity for abused children. Who we are, fundamentally, stays the same throughout our lives.|`|LGQIvxMvaa	Basically, both yes and no can be argued, but I would say no. Even though we are genetically integrated as humans, we are able to fight it. Human nature urges us to be selfish and selfcentered, but we are able to control it if we have the self-discipline. Let's say you have a pie. Sharing is a good principle to follow, but you want it all for yourself preferrably. However, the generous part of you counteracts the selfish part of you and you end up sharing your pie with others. If you have the will in you, human nature has nothing against you.<br>  Things that happen around us can shape us in ways we will never realize until it hits us.<br>  <br>  This is a very good statement to contemplate. I could think for an hour about these things.|`|ReHJAUfRaa	i most definintely disagree. just think of who you are, what you do, how you think-its all based on your surroundings and experiences. example: i live in an extremely conservative town, im republican, wear polos to school everyday, virgin, blah blah blah. my whole towns like that. i grew up being taught to wear and act and think this way with others who dress, act, and think the same.- think of culture shocks when you leave home, NYC life-people are mean, move quickly, dress similarly. although i do believe there are exceptions in some ways, my environment and how iv been raised is how i think and act. thats why most political party preferences are all the same in families (most of the time) b/c theyv been surrounded by those opinions and trained to believe thats the right and logical way. brains are crazy the way they work sorry but this quote is wrong in my opinion!

CtqWRAcFaa	Over time, colors come to be associated with ideas or emotional states.  For example, blue often symbolizes sadness, while white may represent purity.  While color symbolism may vary from person to person, or from culture to culture, it can be used effectively as an expressive tool in works of art such as F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby.  <br>  <br>  In his portrayal of Gatsby as a young man rising from poverty to wealth, striving for the attention of the woman he loves, Fitzgerald uses color to symbolize the flamboyant and immoral society of the '20s.  For example, he uses gray to represent the Valley of Ashes,  which portrays the truculent life of the Wilsons.  He uses white to symbolize the  irresponsibility and coldness of Daisy and Tom, and he uses green to represent  Gatsby’s ambition and worldliness.

QmwYOQuDaa	There are only a couple of States that allow you to do that in the US.  You need to check with www.ncarb.org to see what the requirements are.  Keep in mind that certain States will not allow reciprocity of any candidate without a professional degree.  In California, a candidate without a professional degree is required to work under the direct supervision of a licensed architect for 8 years.  <br>  I personally have worked with four architects without professional degrees.  The one thing all four had in common was they all did not fare well with the Architectural Registration Exams.  It took 5-9 attempts to pass while it took me one try.  In the office, they work as project architects and do very little design work.  This is not a blanket statement to say architects without a professional degrees are all like that, I am only speaking from my limited experience.|`|3B1g8cVBaa	Work alongside an architect, its better!

If you have a doctors certificate stating that you have been seriously ill with pneumonia, your teacher should be prepared to give you an extension.<br>  <br>  The second option would be to compare the two main characters Batman and the Joker. Compare the anarchy of the Joker to the reserve of Batman. You can also compare the empathy of Batman with the lack of empathy of the Joker.

cAaNsGguaa	University admissions are on a case-by-case basis, so there's no standard way to know if you'll get accepted or not. I work in a University admissions office and everyday I see students with high GPAs get rejected, while some lower GPAs get accepted... it's based on a lot of different factors! <br>  <br>  One hint is to look at the admissions profile of the current freshmen class and see what the average SAT and GPA was. A good resource for this is www.princetonreview.com. You'll have to register, but it only takes a few seconds and it's worth it for all of the information on the site.|`|5mIhU9KAaa	sorry but i don't think you will get in. your gpa is far lower than what the average gpa is for freshman who get accepted into all of those schools and your SAT isn't that high either. if you really ant to go to a UC you should apply to UCR, UCSC, and UCM you might have a chance at those ones. other than that you should apply to cal state schools like CSULB, San Diego state. and SLO because they are the best overall<br>  <br>  good luck.

YxiqI903aa	You should talk to her parents and discuss the whole issue. Also bringing to kids together and talking it out would help. Talk about it doesn't matter who started it and come to a resolve, stating how it's not right and just end it. Tell them that physical behavior, like so, or worse, doesn't resolve issues but makes things worse.<br>  <br>  This will help them learn how to deal with issues without fighting. Already, they have developed a bad habit, so you must reverse this asap or else it may be permanent and corrupt their way of thinking and reasoning.<br>  <br>  After you have done that all, since they are kids, have them play together or do things together. This way, this would help them understand that even though there are issues with those close to them, they can learn to look pass it and still be friends.<br>  <br>  From personal experience, I argue and fight with friends and family, but after words, I make it a point to do something with them. This is to let them know that arguments and disagreements happen, but that doesn't mean I hate them or anything.

AA12095483	Um, overpopulation doesn't really have much to do with geography, it's a social issue, a political issue and an economic issue. <br>  Some countries, for example, China, set limits on the number of children a couple can have  -  and they enforce it, rigidly. <br>  Other countries pay a bonus for every child a couple has, so there obviously isn't world-wide agreement on the question of overpopulation.

7fwNxpGkaa	Well this is how I would do it:<br>  <br>  So the cruise costs $2757.<br>  It is on sale 2/3s off. <br>  So why don't you figure out what one third is?  That would be 2757 divided by 3, which equals 919.            <br>  <br>  So 919 is 1/3 of 2757.    But you don't need 1/3, you need 2/3.  <br>  So just multiply 919 by 2, which equals 1838.<br>  <br>  So it is 2/3 OFF the regular price.<br>  That means that you would subtract 1838 (2/3 of 2757) from the total price.  And voila, you have the answer.<br>  <br>  The entire process:<br>  <br>  2757 / 3 = 919<br>  919 * 2 = 1838<br>  2757 - 1838 = 919<br>  919 is the answer<br>  <br>  You will notice that the answer is the same number as 1/3 of the price.<br>  This is correct because 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3. And as we know, 919 is 1/3 of the original cost.<br>  <br>  And for the other people who answered I may be wrong but it would only be 1838 if it was 2/3 OF the regular price, not OFF the regular price.  <br>  Of course I could be wrong but I don't think so...<br>  O and I am assuming that you want to know how much the cruise costs, not how much you are getting off...|`|Zy8quCAGaa	First you find 2/3 of $2757. Which means you multiply<br>  <br>  2/3   X 2757 = $1838<br>  <br>  You subtract:<br>  <br>  $ 2757<br>  - $ 1838<br>  -------------<br>  $919<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The cost will be $919|`|XayiqDyUaa	original cost divide by 3 multiply by 2...this is the 2/3 discount<br>  <br>  <br>  (2757 / 3) 2<br>  (919)2<br>  $1838<br>  <br>  original cost minus 2/3 discount =discount price<br>  <br>  $2757-$1838=$919|`|U2rY9uKNaa	You would multiply 2757 by .667, or multiply it by two and then divide by three, or use a proportion.  Any way would work just try to work it out, <br>  <br>  P.S. If all else fails the answer is 1838

wMxJDXcRaa	The Zimbabwe Ruins is the largest single ancient structure south of the Sahara. The perimeter wall is 820 feet in circumference and 36 feet high, and it is estimated that nearly a million granite blocks were used in its construction. The roughly oval-shaped structure encloses an area 262 feet by 180 feet and contains a number of stone features, including the Conical Tower. The Great Enclosure evolved to its final state over the period of time during which Great Zimbabwe was a large town. Two high walls form the narrow parallel passage, 180 feet long, that allows direct access from the north entrance of the enclosure to the Conical Tower. The inner wall of this passage was originally built as the perimeter wall; the massive outer wall was constructed later, surmounted by monoliths and decorated with two courses of chevron pattern high up on the external face in the area of the Conical Tower. The Conical Tower, one of the last structures to be built in the Great Enclosure, is 33 feet high and 16 feet in diameter at the base, tapering to 6.5 feet at the top where, originally, there were an additional three courses of 'dentelle' decoration. It is solid, built of granite blocks throughout, and rests directly on the ground with no underlying chamber. Its large size and seclusion behind an equally massive enclosure wall, together with the narrow passageway leading to it, indicate that it was an important structure. Next to it is a smaller tower, and similar examples are also found in other Valley Enclosures. The purpose of the towers is unknown but as they seem to have had no functional use they were probably symbolic. Traditionally, the Conical Tower is said to represent a grain bin, symbolising good harvests and prosperity. The remains of stepped platforms and hut floors are found inside the Great Enclosure but most of the archaeological stratigraphy which would help explain its function and history was removed between 1890 and 1910. It has been suggested that it was the chief's residence or a court for the chief's wives or a premarital initiation school.

That is solid evidence that an increase in knowledge is an increase in sorrow.|`|5lsOxHnUaa	1)  When children find out about mortality - that all living things eventually die - they become sad.  More wisdom, more sorrow.<br>  <br>  2)  When people found out that the economy was really a bubble - with house prices that were inflated and loan repayment expectations that were too optimistic - they became sad and stopped investing so much.  Lower investment led to greater economic pain.  More wisdom, more sorrow.<br>  <br>  3)  In the abtract: when you learn more about things, you really start to appreciate all the things you don't know.  For example, when you start learning arithmetic - 2 + 2 and all that, and it makes sense - you celebrate and you think you know math.  But there are guys like Stephen Hawking who drive themselves crazy trying to see how else math can be used and how they can make sense of some contradictions between different mathematical theories.  More wisdom, more sorrow.
