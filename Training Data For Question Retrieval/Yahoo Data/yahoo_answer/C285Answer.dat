H5wdVWTeaa	It was really good and exciting. I didn't like it as much as Indiana Jones 2 or 3, but it was at least equal to Raiders Of The Lost Ark.|`|NXcTnS9Xaa	Yes it is go Rent it|`|toLCaFc9aa	I found it dumb, but don't mind me, I don't like Indiana Jones.|`|9ae55890a5fcfea5236690724138dc1faa	It was good but it wasn't in the same league as the other 3. I was disappointed as I was a big fan of the others. <br>  The story while carried out well by Spielberg still wasn't very good to begin with. I found the action scenes were a bit more bland than the other one, they were also less frequent that's not to say they weren't good though just a bit more predictable. <br>  It had parts that simply couldn't have happened (surviving a nuclear blast by climbing into a fridge)<br>  It swapped the adventure theme for sci fi. It gave up it's main theme that Christianity is right and that its myths(Lost Ark and Holy Grail) are true in exchange for a new idea that aliens exist and have visited the planet leaving artifacts containing advanced scientific secrets.<br>   <br>  It also tryed to introduce a new character Mutt, I wont spoil it for you but they are trying to line him up as a younger version of Indiana Jones to replace Harrison Ford. It didn't really fit for me and I hope they dont toy with this classic franchise anymore.<br>  <br>  Dont get me wrong it's a good movie but it really shouldn't have been made and was sub par for the franchise.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	I didn't like it, and I'm a big fan of the Indiana Jones movies.  I loved "Raiders of the Lost Ark", and "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade", but I hated both "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", and "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".  I thought they were both a little too absurd.<br>  <br>  If you're a fan of the films, I'd say go ahead and rent it just so you can see it, but then again, as a fan, I like to pretend that it just didn't happen at all. lol.|`|tuvcxnJXaa	Catherine E echoes my thoughts.|`|SuKS1OQtaa	I didn't really care for it...|`|akcGfgdcaa	If you want a decent night in, then Indiana Jones won't disappoint, true, it's not as good as the first 3 and although all the films are pretty silly, this is definitely one of the more sillier of the 4.<br>  <br>  BUT everyone in the cast is decent, it still has that great combination of humour, action, romance, adventure and fantasy.|`|zovrJ0yXaa	the first 3 movies are some of my favourite movies ever, so maybe thats why im particularly harsh, but the 4th indy movie was appalling. it wasnt exciting, it had a stupid story, the stunts were done with very bad computer effects, it just didnt look convincing at all. considering the series is founded on excitement thats a pretty shocking thing. indy himself was good but it was stupid to put shia labeouf in it. great actor and comedian but completely wrong for indy. and come to think of it, indy is many peoples favourite movies|`|d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	I'd say it was the worst movie of the series. Yes it's still Indy, but so watered down with stupid twists...  I loved the earlier films, this one was disappointing.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for an enjoyable movie- rent Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Pineapple Express, Live Free or Die Hard, or Get Smart.|`|7ZfGqo3qaa	It was probably the worst film of the series... Certainly nowhere near the brilliant 1st and 3rd films, about even with Temple of Doom, I guess.  <br>  <br>  This last film went waaaaaaay over-the-top with some things,  which killed any sense of real excitement.  It became more like "The Mummy" films where you just sit back and don't expect much.|`|8a1003a8e944c1c1e1968057edfe9aebaa	I Loved it, It was vary good, Go rent it! I loved it and all my friends did too, Go rent it!|`|mdfKV703aa	I think it was cute. It shouldn't be taken too seriously and it's nowhere near Lost Ark status...but it's a good movie.|`|43sVTaCMaa	i loved it|`|xoxXq3w5aa	I personally, totally loved it! It was awesome and it was just like the original Indiana Jones movies, but with a little modern movie look in it. The action and special effects were great and were totally better than the first three. It isn't good, it is excellent and you should definitely rent it!  If you liked the first three, you'll love this one!|`|BgouZaeSaa	i don't like it so much. i believe that harison ford gave his turn to the young indiana.

Fill a cheap water pistol with white vinegar. If your victim Clair has any hair color in her coiffure the vinegar will have the effect of either turning blond to a lovely shade of green, black to bright red or red to purple or blue. Even if it's just her natural color and lots of hairspray it will look like Swiss cheese or a mud dawbers nest with just a couple of well aimed squirts.|`|OXleDYVQaa	Um, no but I was on an elevator once and had to sneeze and grabbed hold of a girls hair to cover it.

You're either a spammer, a troll, or a little kid who thinks he has something to prove.<br>  <br>  Anime is a distinctly Japanese form of animation.  End of story.<br>  The majority of it is written by Japanese manga-ka or screenwriters, produced by Japanese agencies, and aired originally on Japanese television.|`|btFSgJmlaa	Anime comes from Japan, as in Japanese Animation.<br>  <br>  The toys are made in China.|`|AA10614226	Anime began at the start of the 20th century, when Japanese filmmakers experimented with the animation techniques that were being explored in France, Germany, the United States, and Russia. The oldest known anime in existence was screened in 1917 - a two minute clip of a samurai trying to test a new sword on his target, only to suffer defeat.<br>  <br>  By the 1930s, animation became an alternative format of storytelling compared to the underdeveloped live-action industry in Japan. Unlike in the United States, the live-action industry in Japan remained a small market and suffered from budgeting, location, and casting restrictions. The lack of Western-looking actors, for example, made it next to impossible to shoot films set in Europe, America, or fantasy worlds that do not naturally involve Japan. Animation allowed artists to create any characters and settings.<br>  The success of Disney's 1937 feature film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs influenced Japanese animators. In the 60's, Osamu Tezuka adapted and simplified many Disney animation techniques to reduce the costs and number of frames in the production. This was intended to be a temporary measure to allow him to produce material on a tight schedule with an inexperienced animation staff.<br>  <br>  During the 1970s, there was a surge of growth in the popularity of manga—which were often later animated—especially those of Osamu Tezuka, who has been called a "legend" and the "god of manga". His work and that of other pioneers in the field, inspired characteristics and genres that are fundamental elements of anime today. The giant robot genre (known as "Mecha" outside Japan), for instance, took shape under Tezuka, developed into the Super Robot genre under Go Nagai and others, and was revolutionized at the end of the decade by Yoshiyuki Tomino who developed the Real Robot genre. Robot anime like the Gundam and Macross series became instant classics in the 1980s, and the robot genre of anime is still one of the most common in Japan and worldwide today. In the 1980s, anime became more accepted in the mainstream in Japan (although less than manga), and experienced a boom in production. Following a few successful adaptations of anime in overseas markets in the 1980s, anime gained increased acceptance in those markets in the 1990s and even more in the 2000s.|`|LIwx56Qcaa	Actually it's Japan. Bakugan Battle Brawlers is a Japanese anime television series originating in Japan. The story revolves around the lives of creatures called Bakugan and the battle brawler characters who hold them. In 2007, Bakugan Battle Brawlers debuted in Japan on TV Tokyo. <br>  <br>  See the ref site for more about the Bakugan game.|`|F60JZOU3aa	some animes may have been make in china for the japanese because its cheaper to produce but all the content and design is japanese|`|CMkxSYJjaa	....noooooooooooo....that would be...uhhhh...japan, maybe?<br>  \|`|7kMeaccWaa	not everything is made in china. animes originated in japan.<br>  <br>  Anime (アニメ?, taken from half of the Japanese pronunciation of "animation", pronounced [anime] Anime.ogg listen (help·info) in Japanese, but typically pronounced /??n?me?/ or /??n?m?/ in English) is animation in Japan and considered to be "Japanese animation" in the rest of the world.[1] Anime dates first started from about 1917.[2]<br>  <br>  Anime, in addition to manga (Japanese comics), is extremely popular in Japan and well known throughout the world. Anime itself is considered a form of limited animation. Anime can be released either by television broadcast or released directly to video, in which case it is often called OVA or OAV (Original Animation Video).<br>  <br>  Anime can be hand-drawn or computer animated. It is used in television series, films, video, video games, commercials, and internet-based releases, and represents most, if not all, genres of fiction.

Sp02im20aa	I just listened to her,<br>  and she sorta does just a little <br>  bit though. She is really good
AQFwSLgiaa	What we hear inside our head is totally different when we record our selves and listen to it. I did that too and i was like wow I don't like listening to myself sing but I'm very good at singing. It's just the way the phone is and it's not like a professional recording studio...So it's totally different and makes your voice sound weird.|`|5xxZyyoMaa	A little bit of both. The phone picks up on the breathing because our ears are trained to ignore that, phone microphones are not. Plus they're not that great of quality.
tuPbOTvUaa	chinese democracy duh!!!!! the other bands suk!|`|0vm66wlcaa	Well, I don't think any of them are all that great.<br>  But Weezer is my favorite of all of those. Go with the Red Album. It is definitely not their best album (Make Believe and Blue Album are their best, I think) but it beats the other 4.<br>  <br>  I would not recommend Nickelback at all.|`|YwtXSUAdaa	Red Album for sure. It's pretty good and much better than anything else you listed anyway.|`|8zJy3jeOaa	you still buy cd's?<br>  <br>  Black horse - Nickelback|`|SToOdHj1aa	How about the new Lamb of God that comes out tomorrow!|`|Vu4A83dyaa	Sound of Madness!

Nickelback is just terrible, i cant stand weezer, and GnR is just a joke to me. and Shinedown is a fail to me as well. I just love A7X cause off that cd there is Almost Easy, Afterlife and Dear God as for the amazing songs on it. So i would say take that one|`|WOMjtldKaa	I got Chinese Democracy and it's awesome!! And Dark Horse is awesome too. (By the way, the album's DARK Horse not Black Horse.)|`|HtAXbr2Taa	They all are good but I would pick Red album by Weezer.|`|BUOJJpaCaa	Personally I would pick Shinedown just because they are awesome to listen to on CD and even better live!|`|EO35Luyuaa	The Weezer album ;-)|`|4iaswP8Kaa	I personally would prefer the new Nickelback album..they have a lot of new, nice songs.

FTL1F0fGaa	ok well part of it is the beat and we may not necessarily understand where they are coming from but its the fact that right now in society it is the popular music so people give into a certain amount of peer pressure and listen to rap. for me i never really liked rap until i decided to open up and i like it for what they talk about because they talk about their life and how they came to be famous there are also many underground rappers such as immortal technique who talks about the corruption within the government and i really can relate to that cuz i cant stand our government. long enough for ya :)|`|cb917qxUaa	It's music .. they like it cause they THINK they can relate to it but obviously only a minority actually can. Some of them probably just like the beat, the meaning .. It doesn't matter about colour, Black, Brown and White can go through the exact same hardships in their life to have experienced the negative effects of racism, poverty, struggle, murder ect so anyone can relate to the music even if they currently are living in the suburbs or not. Also maybe some of them live a boring life so they like to fantasize about living a life that gangsta rap portrays. Its a mystery ..|`|cd8ff0f053ce1a2e1b3303ea5ec2f1c7aa	Maybe because they can relate to it on some level. Not necessarily having witnessed a friend or family member being murdered, but they can relate to the pain. I listen to rap that I can't exactly identify with, but I appreciate it as art, because it is a form of expression. We are all human, so we all experience the same feelings no matter what causes them.|`|K8e4T5nOaa	this is because kids (color does not matter) are ...... i guess you could say brainwashed (i cant think of a better word) into thinking this kind of music is kool. i disagree. rap is not music. its retards attempting poetry. plus they use a machine!! not insturments!! that is not music. <br>  <br>  but it could also be because they have not experianced anything that is "rapped" about and so they think it is kool and be fun to experiance since they have perfect worlds and think no matter what happens everything will get better (soooooo not the case) <br>  <br>  and to the people that think im stupid, its mine own ******** opinion and you can stick it up you a(ss|`|jz7dbg2saa	hi, i'm one of those kids...the songs' beat just gets in your heart, you dunno how you want to listen to them... its just in ya...what confuses me is that white kids sometimes hate black people:S<br>  see, when you listen to the songs, they have something true between the lines which other songs don't have....they have got real life experiences, such as discos etc... they say that the rap and R&B are for dirty people who only talk about sex etc.. look at life today...this is reality.... can explain further on daniel_fenech_1994@hotmail.com<br>  <br>  bdw even though i'm one of 'em, i don't act like most of songs appearances(f*cku every girl etc... i just  try to live my life, as in Live Your Life<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aq4AaKL9jfl49S5ZICdu3cPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220084041AAExPYJ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|7bd5c38d38a3cb435c27ea516c76a8d0aa	Because music is art, a form of expressionism that has no boundaries.

Is your source credible? Though the numbers are overwhelming in your defense, it seems like it wouldn't be that extreme.<br>  <br>  It's not all that I listen to, but I grew up in the 90s in white suburbia, and I like to listen to rap sometimes because it's fun. <br>  <br>  Also, how do you know that whites in suburban areas will never face racism, murder, poverty, etc.? I agree that poverty wouldn't be as much as an issue as it would be in the city, but crime still occurs in suburbia. Also, there is racism against whites. It just doesn't seem like there is because of the rise of African Americans and how they overcame oppression. I could go on and on about this, but I'll spare you that one. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck on your research<br>  Rachel|`|iYNE88S6aa	Well, It's "influence". Why is there such a big war with rap and rock. It's just preference. I like a lot of rap and hip hop artist, but there are many that I don't like. It's either the lyrics, the beat or just the ideas of the music that they like. I mean, why do so many people like pizza? <br>  <br>  Can people just give it a rest. If you don't like rap, don't hang out with people who like it. It's like--I like hip hop, but I am going to be accepting of other genres.|`|0b8887cb1bb770f83c9043e623f4cffcaa	because, maybe some of them really do live in the city and really do experience these things...i live in a country *** town but i used to live in the city and i grew up listening to rap...no one should really care about what people listen to...and yes i am white...i do listen to eminem, 50, snoop, tupac, whatever rap, i don't care...the beat just calms me down...it really shouldn't matter what people listen to|`|52bdac00d172eaaeb319c1e4ccc9e5bcaa	Like eating ice cream - different flavors and different ways to enjoy it.  Times change - Every generation has their own music idols.  Look at country & western music - the C/W music of today doesn't sound like the C/W of  the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's.   Today it is country rock.

FdqCnU03aa	:::: Hiii~!! ^^<br>  <br>  [1] Who are your top three favourite anime or manga characters. Give one reason why. (If you don't know why you like a character, then it's fine to put "I don't know")<br>  <br>  :::: List:<br>  --- 1) Koizumi Karin (Eyeshield 21) -- She's pretty. She's accomplished. She's the top quarterback (and a female one too) in the nine-years-running top school for high school American football in Japan (in the manga anyways). She can draw, and she can play piano!<br>  --- 2) Abarai Renji (Bleach) -- meh... Renji ish too kawaii~!! And he's a great fighter. xDD<br>  --- 3) Kakei Shun (Eyeshield 21) -- he's really cute too! and an amazing linebacker (football player). He's also really tall! O.O And he has blue hair~! :3<br>  <br>  lol is it okay if I put two others to share third place? ... >.> meh.. I'm putting it anywayzzz~! mwahahaha~! ^^<br>  --- 3b) Grimmjow J. (Bleach) -- also is kinda cute, is a great fighter.. AND HAS THE PRETTIEST LIGHT BLUE HAIR~!!! :3<br>  --- 3c) Wanajima Agito/Akito (Air Gear) -- he's the cutest little kid! Or rather, Akito is. [[Akito/Agito is one person, one body -- but Akito's or Agito's personalities kind of take turns depending on which side their eyepatch is on. >.> Akito is super cute, and Agito is... also cute, but more of a little-tough-guy type. Agito is also amazing at fighting/etc., though.]] And Agito -- well he's cute in his own ways. <-- lol Agito is the one in my profile pic<br>  <br>  [2] Pick any character from an anime or manga: if they were to take a job in today's society, what would it most likely be? If they already have a job, put down what job they do hold, what job they want to hold or what job you could see them in.<br>  <br>  :::: L (Death Note) -- is the top detective worldwide, in the manga<br>  ... or rather, he's the top three detectives worldwide -- 'cause the top three are all him, but with different aliases. xDD<br>  <br>  [3] If you knew them in real life, which anime/manga character would be most likely to be your best friend?<br>  <br>  :::: Koizumi Karin (Eyeshield 21) O.O She's just too pretty! But she's really nice, and she's my height and is almost exactly the same age! and we both play sports and instruments. :3<br>  <br>  [4] Have you ever been motivated to watched/read an anime/manga for a reason other then actually liking what you're reading/watching? (I don't know if I made much sense on that, but for example, you watched an anime just because your favourite band did the opening theme, instead of actually being interested in what the anime is about.)<br>  <br>  :::: YES. xDD Because those types are the ones suggested by friends that I'd been eying (sp?) skeptically for a while. But then I generally begin to like it.<br>  <br>  [5] Favourite character who's ever worn an eyepatch or bandage over an eye? Doesn't have to be permanent; they could've just worn it for one episode or something.<br>  <br>  :::: O.O lol one of my fave characters does wear one... xDD<br>  --> Wanajima Agito/Akito (same as in profile pic) from Air Gear<br>  His eyepatch is permanent. Except for the very short time that the third personality Lind emerged, with the eyepatch off.<br>  <br>  [6] Remember those guys you picked for the first question? Pick one and tell me your favourite quote from them.<br>  <br>  :::: Kakei Shun (ES21), speaking hostpitably to Kobayakawa Sena. Sena had been ordered to spy on Kakei's team (this is a football series, lol).. by doing his managerly duties and delivering shoes, but he's discovered by Kakei's team.<br>  Quote: "I apologize. You came in good faith and we treated you like a SPY." -- ES21 vol. 13, ch.111<br>  <br>  lol.. and Kakei was being totally serious. (He always has a serious expression though. O.O) In that scene.. the irony was so hilarious! xDD<br>  <br>  [BONUS]<br>  <br>  Here are some lyrics from an anime/anime movie/OVA/ONA/whatever; What song is it, what band sings it, and what's it from:<br>  <br>  Run and run!<br>  Run and run!<br>  Kaze ni nari hashire<br>  Sa kinou no omae wo koeteyukunda<br>  Tachimukae jibun yori ookina mono ni<br>  Sou sa wakasa wa moetsukinai ryuusei da<br>  <br>  :::: O.O<br>  Song Title: Nagareboshi Gin (Shooting Star Gin)<br>  Anime Opening Song<br>  <br>  Band/Singer: <br>  Performed by Hitomi Konno<br>  Lyrics and Music by Shinya Himeno<br>  <br>  Anime: Ginga Nagareboshi Gin|`|GhhbZphuaa	i'm only gonna write the answers:<br>  1)-toshiro hitsugaya<br>  -byakuya kuchiki<br>  -inuyasha<br>  because they are all smexy(i'm a girl,so....)<br>  <br>  2)Reborn: Magician(watch as he turns from a infant to an adult!

SEzMrFrbaa	black sabbath create it,pantera,sepultura and slayer formed it,metallica took it in the prime and slipknot,m.manson and korn ruined it|`|M7E1uIsKaa	I think metal is still good!  There are lots of great bands out there. Sure, there are lots of bad ones too, But music evolves and changes.. You just have to be open to the change.|`|R1WapAO6aa	There were no creators. It was like a transition from rock n roll and blues to something a bit "heavier." I guess a creator would be the band black sabbath, but i don't think they intended to create a new genre. <br>  <br>  I think they would say that it turned out really well because there's so many new genres because of them. Death metal, thrash metal, power metal, black metal, doom metal, folk metal, plus many many more genres and subgenres.|`|hSNni3mSaa	I guess that depends on who the "creators" are. I've been a fan for a very long time, and today it seems that heavy metal is making a comeback. More new fans, more looking up songs and bands on youtube that was not possible a few years ago. Bands like the Sword and Wolfmother (maybe they aren't considered HM...so what they rock) are well liked, yet not really getting radio play. However, radio is no longer relevant anyway, so when I read about how much Lars Ulrich (not saying he's one of the "creators") likes the Sword and invites them on tour, then something is going right.|`|DLk9SRjRaa	If by creators of metal you mean Sabbath, Purple, Sir Lord Baltimore, Budgie, Blue Cheer, MC5, etc. then theyre probably not thrilled with some of the more 'commercial' (screaming, blood-curdling(not in a good way) headbanger's ball type of stuff) but there's still plenty of doom metal and stoner rock to go around.  Enough so that i doubt Tony, and Geezer are going to hang themselves in desperation.  And i'm sure our metal forefathers dig bands like Danava, and Witchcraft, who stay true to the original template, and kick tremendous amounts of *** in the process.|`|2c9e27b528ec302c442a3ff42014807daa	Since I consider Ozzy Osbourne/Black Sabbath as the Godfather of Heavy Metal I'd say they'd think it's great! Ever heard of Ozzfest?

2k8TEiRtaa	The Washburn Bad Dog  BD25R is a very good amp for the purpose you have in mind. It has an echo knob, and distortion  channel. The other is just the regukar "clean" Channel. You can only connect 1 guitar on it though. But it is powerful enough to wake the neighbors as the previous user said. It is pretty cheap compared to the good sound it has. you can get it from www.musiciansfriend.com or www.music123.com. I have one and it is a good little amp. It kind of surprised me when I connected my electric guitar to it. I don't know how it will sound with an acoustic /electric. It depends on the guitar and pickup quality of your guitar. But that goes for any amp.|`|uP0ydiO1aa	ok exactly how cheap? i have a line6 spider III i got it for 250 and i love it its relativley lightweight( for me anyway only weighs like 20 pounds) but i would suggest a line6 amp only cause i think they are the best. but if your looking cheap but pretty high end and portable then i would suggest a roland micro cube amp.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Fender Frontman 15G. It's loud enough to annoy the neighbours.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Any Marshall amp 25W or less. You can always resell it. Look in the papers, craigslist, ebay, the green sheet, the pennysaver, etc.. You could get one used.

2ZXt112Qaa	I will answer this question though I believe is stupid. She could be too nice or a simple bitc...., no man should hit a woman.  It shouldn't happen to anyone yet its very common in society. Now what bothers me is the fact that everyone is making this Rihanna case such a big commotion because of the tiny little fact that she is in the public eye. There are many women like Rihanna who have suffered the same or even worse. Let's stop the bullshit about this singer and get more focused on other victims of abuse.|`|4IDgCFWdaa	How do you know she's too nice? <br>  <br>  Though I don't think she deserved to be beaten the way she was... I would however agree with putting her in a headlock if she truly deserved it. Maybe even the camel clutch if she was really bad. Like if she cheated on me with my brother or something.|`|fv2GAAdPaa	What hapopened to her should never happen to anyone...its as if she isnt human(the way he did her) its justw rong and he should be punished for it!|`|Uihh8Cqqaa	Yeah, stuff like that shouldn't happen but women should probably look out for men like that. Oh, and it was Chris Brown....|`|4zahzGnJaa	Yup Yup.|`|Fd0hvyoyaa	No it should never happen to anyone and LOL bobby brown, it was chris brown.|`|hEdEpOQbaa	If you support Rihanna then u hate Chris Brown Boo you CB i never liked his music but cos she is a celebrity have you seen the picture of her he turned a really Beautiful face into something mashed up so even if she's a celebrity and she gets publicity for this she never planned it for attention it just happened So even if Rihanna got publicity for injuries nobody deserves what chris brown did i read first of they came out of a nightclub and Chris crept out to text another lady behind Rihanna's back She saw and got angry they got in the car and she shouted at him for texting another lady so chris said ''Im going to kill you''  so she got out of the car which made chris even angrier he started punching her face and biting her arm So Chris Brown might be jailed for attempted murder.|`|ebcecbda8ee44b29592cc34cd3e1a0e6aa	OMG......!!! I Liked Chris Brown and you no wat now i hate him so much cos of wat he did to rihanna it was out and he is a men man ever i liked his music but not now cos of wat he did im so sorry to rihanna and i hope she get better soon xxx

They where going to name is young and reckless or something like that and a show was going to sue them so their layer made them change the name of the song.|`|ABSka1puaa	"Thanks for The Memories" is saying that the person they're referring to they really didn't like.<br>  <br>  "I Don't Care" is that they really don't care what people think of them, whether they're good or bad.|`|5yn7Wh7Aaa	songmeanings.net is full of people who try and work it out.

oP71CqVjaa	I watch it its alright Paris Hilton really gets on my nerves sometimes she seems so fake and the way she walks is a bit over the top as well apart from that its quite amusing to watch the contestants lick her *** LOL|`|wKCgaoZVaa	I've seen it and can't stand the woman. She puts on a baby voice, then speaks normal.  She said in an interview that she wanted to be a vet, then realized she could just buy all animals she wants.  Animals aren't robots or clothes!!<br>  <br>  She's famous for being famous, I can't stand that. What about real people out there, like Nelson Mandela, or Martin Luther King.  Sure, they're not bubbly and blonde, but they fought for what they believe in, and were famous for fantastic reasons.<br>  <br>  But if you want to go to more popular "modern" ones, then I love Hayden Pattener (spelling?)  she supports the Whales and dolphins foundation, and is great for charity.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Sorry, just a note to blazinsquad, I find that really offensive that you say that she looks retarted, and then relate that to down syndromes.  Retarted is an awful word, and just because people with Down syndromes have different faces does not mean that they are "retarted".|`|WPlEOkE5aa	i honestly do think she has issues... i think shes downsyndrome cus she acts so retarded its untrue. she speaks reli slowly and mongy. and shes so fake and smirky. and no1 wants to be her friend really, and that carrie is on drugs. she cant make any friends normally so she makes a tele show on how to gain one friend!?   loner.  but yes i have watched it twice to see what my mates were onna bout ( its stupid )|`|WKWejOllaa	I think it is stupid because friends cannot be made by winning competitions and you cannot make a friend 'official'. I think it is just a way to gain even more fame (as if she needed it) and money.|`|67Nju9Pmaa	My opinion is that we have reached the as$ end of television entertainment.<br>  I think people should stop humouring Parisite Hilton with this stinking garbage and didn't Andy Warhol say "15 minutes"?|`|YcxJQ6N3aa	its not brilliant i think most people would agree with me no offense but her voice can get on my nerves and she seems so fake|`|CFKV5ddfaa	It's daft and shallow who hosts a show to find a best friend?!<br>  <br>   but i guess it's a laugh :D<br>  <br>  ttyn (talk to you never)|`|DDuLoMWxaa	OMG im so sick of her voice<br>  its 2 girly and it jus makes me wana punch her<br>  u can tell its fake|`|gRcXNB5Caa	she's pathetic<br>  and needs to do something better with her life<br>  she's fake and has no education.|`|SHeLdu8haa	I don't like it.|`|Jj8JlApvaa	cheap and boring|`|DtU1EpoVaa	i don't like it but cant help but watch all the little wannabes sucking up to her.<br>  <br>  as for paris she is the biggest wannabe out there she is so fake and plastic like she makes Barbie look real<br>  <br>  but like i said i cant help but watch|`|0PoyiLJWaa	love it and carrie 2 win :)|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	Only saw part of it last week and it made me cringe!<br>  Not my thing at all.|`|dc0555756d85fd8e835261e426845615aa	Load of crap........all i have to say about it.

5c32c20454730c4d102bcfbf98334674aa	The runner-up that season was Brooke. She was a younger girl, 24 I think. She has a Southern accent and blond hair. I believe it was her that has a father in jail during the show. She was really upset about it, and was afraid to tell Aaron. She was cute and sweet. I never understood what Aaron saw in Helene- she seems like such a controlling b*tch!|`|aihogb26aa	Reportedly, Aaron broke up with Helene a few months after the show ended. He had stated that he was really focused on his career and that his life was just too busy. The runner-up was Brooke Smith.|`|6CAsx3jaaa	runner up was the girl from alabama - brook. my theory is that the bachelors get famous and girls start throwing themselves at the bachelor plus time away from each other . add to that the relationship starts with the woman chasing the bachelor but it changes when the show is over.  the fun is in the journey once thats over it like starting over|`|5Pgs61ePaa	Brooke
9YShCg40aa	hmmm it might have multiple meanings, but over all I see it as she's not perfect, she has some strong flaws "standing by a broken tree her hands are all twisted" he looks past these flaws and is utterly in love with her, which means he is "damed" all he really wants is to be with her, even if she is far from perfection. <br>  <br>  hope that made sense =]|`|Ge6LrNGDaa	<a href="http://allininfo.mooo.com" rel="nofollow">http://allininfo.mooo.com</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|9Zjk9dRqaa	i thinks she wants to keep him away from the happiness of his life just to keep him with her or something like that.|`|K8e4T5nOaa	i dont know but he sucks and i hate him. <br>  plus its a pretty stupid song anyway

eT6SsCaraa	Well, I'm a Pisces, and I'm really, really sensitive... while I don't get angry, I do get easily hurt and upset. Rather than blame others for it, I blame myself and put myself down...<br>  <br>  Who upsets me the most? Well.. anyone who puts me down or makes fun of me.. no sign specifically. It really hurts when someone makes fun of my intelligence.. or doubts my kindness... or makes fun of how I look... or insults me in anyway... Even if it isn't really serious, I'll often take it seriously. And if, for example, someone insults a shirt I'm wearing.. I'll never wear it again. Or if someone makes fun of a habit, I'll never do it again either...<br>  <br>  I don't like being the center of attention, it's very frightening for me... but I don't like being ignored either. ): It hurts, I want to be appreciated and have my input valued..<br>  <br>  If anyone puts me down, and others cheer them on, that really upsets me too. It happened just yesterday here... I ended up deleting my answer because I was so hurt...<br>  <br>  What would hurt the most was if I was lied to or cheated on by someone I thought I could trust...|`|jTkzSyzbaa	somebody messes with their beloved ones. believe me it pisses them off big time.|`|BeLcoS6Aaa	being lied to and betrayed by loved ones. and someone messing with my kids. grrrr|`|QbQwTSHbaa	well lets see.. just to name a few: being ignored, someone trying to hurt me or just hurting me in general, being pressured into something, people that think they are always right and know it all, stuck up people, people who think they are better, doing chores, being unappreciated, being taken advantage of, being sick, annoying little kids, umm yaa maybe that was more than a few and im sure theres lots more.. i just cant think of them all right now. lol.|`|TgGJVbZeaa	lack of communication, being insensitive, being dishonest, and impulsive.

A boyfriend of mine had all four sessions of House Md on DVD and wanted me to watch it. I remembered it being advertised when it first came on T,V and thought it was just another medical drama and not for me. To please him i watched the first episode just in case it was any good. Well, it's not good. It's brilliant. The boyfriend is now an ex-boyfriend and the best thing i got out of the relationship was House! The show is a drama about a medical doctor who is brilliant but injured his leg and now walks with a limp. He now thinks the world owes him something and has a huge chip on his shoulder. The guy is grumpy, bitter and moody but he never fails to make me laugh! It's got action, drama, comedy and there's a great chemistry between House and his boss Lisa Cuddy, who wants to strangle him half the time and wants to be with him the other half! <br>  Seriously watch it! <br>  <br>  Other choices on my list would be Medium [ a women who helps the police solve crimes through her dreams and seeing spirits] Ghost Whisperer [which is similar but a more weepy, sentimental version with Jennifer Lose Hewit] Desperate Housewives [which provides great drama with lots of twists and turns and can also be quite funny] and Dexter's quite good as well!|`|RNnqh8f4aa	It seems like you prefer to watch American Shows, as do i.<br>  <br>  A really good comedy is HIMYM (how i met your mother) theydo a good job with character Barney and i think you'll like it a lot.<br>  <br>  A good Drama is possibly Grey's Anatomy, they are like the queen of Dramas and you'll be hooked onto that show.|`|YpDvYy5qaa	Gavin and Stacy, Fat Friends, Will and Grace, Lost, Shameless, Teachers, Desperate Housewives<br>  <br>  Hope this gives you some ideas|`|z03coR1Oaa	being human is great its a comedy and a drama so every thing you could want. its the last one on sunday but you can watch all other episodes on iplayer.|`|0Ikzr2Taaa	Law @ Order SVU<br>  House<br>  The L word<br>  Dexter<br>  OZ<br>  Rome|`|0ffdb9dc23ea4daa66d018dcdabc0a14aa	House <br>  Will and Grace<br>  <br>  Two of my favorite shows|`|9MXG3O74aa	Mammas Family if it still comes on.

7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Don't get me wrong...I'm a huge fan of Joaquin Phoenix, but I am still going to say that I thought it was hilarious.  I'm sorry, but as much as I love him, his behavior on the Dave Letterman show was deserving of being mocked.  There was really no excuse for the way he behaved that night.  It wouldn't have been too much to ask for him to give a decent interview on behalf of a film he was paid a LOT of money to be in, and a part of that paycheck requires doing promotion work for the film.<br>  <br>  I get the feeling that, despite his claims to the contrary, this IS all some sort of elaborate joke; some sort of mockumentary that he and Casey Afflec are making.  I think that's he's very much into the joke, and is not offended by Ben Stiller mocking him at the Oscars, because part of this whole experiment includes and depends on recording the public and his peers reaction to his acting this way.<br>  <br>  Either way, I hope he snaps out of this soon.  I miss him.|`|y1Yl6p9Qaa	If you mean the award show itself, I thought it was great. I was surprised to see them do a lot of singing, but Hugh Jackman pulled it off very well, very energetic. As far as Ben Stiller mocking Joaquin Phoenix, that was hilarious. I know a lot of bloggers were saying it was stupid, some people have no sense of humor.|`|6YPNM71Iaa	i didn't know what he was doing at first but then i found out that Joquain did that so yeah i thought is was very funny. <br>  <br>  i am guessing by your icon that your were very happy when Heath won<br>  i cryed i was so happy and emotional haha|`|m2jeeo4Laa	It lasted too long.  At first, it was a bit funny, then I was annoyed with it.  I heard that Phoenix is doing a documentary or mockumentary, so I'm excited to see what this whole "act" is all about.|`|tuvcxnJXaa	I thought it was comical, but it seemed to run its course very quickly, based on the audience reaction.|`|5bTBcBZ4aa	I think that they should just have left the poor guy alone.|`|hGVkInSnaa	I think that they should just have left the poor guy alone.|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	I really think Joquain is serious about this, as some of his friends claim it isn't a joke at all.  So having said that, good for Stiller, Joquain needs to laugh at himself because he is acting like a total buffoon!<br>  <br>  Anyone who takes himself that seriously deserves to be mocked without mercy.

They get trapped and it's  a psychological illness.  Almost worse than a disease.  So if there is someone you know who "keeps going back"  realize there's more to the story and she has to break free mentally before she ever can physically. A lot of counseling is the next step... but she has to want to do it herself first.

I would go live with my mom until I'm positively sure that he wouldn't do it again. <br>  No man should hit a woman, esp. his wife or gf. <br>  <br>  So, I would forgive him if he did it once without considerable damage and promises never to do it again.|`|uLHyDOm1aa	well no<br>  if thats the case<br>  he clearly has no respect for me<br>  even if he didnt think about it; hes a complete twat for doing ITFP<br>  and we shouldnt just go running off and crying for attention<br>  we should hit them back!<br>  its like with chris and rihanna<br>  i mean - if i were her (which i gueuss im not but...)<br>  id hit him back and attack him too<br>  no matter how hot they are <br>  in answer to this intresting question...<br>  never **** off go die dude!<br>  (is what id say)|`|6iCOMx8laa	No. It is inexcusable and unforgivable.

XD|`|1vCoaf08aa	Never my friend.<br>  <br>  Actually, I think you should only not wear a band shirt if you're doing it just because you think it's "cool".<br>  <br>  Ya know, do it cause you want to.|`|AA11209233	Never!|`|llNoDDCsaa	I WANT TO BE BURIED IN ONE!|`|R1WapAO6aa	Wow what kind of question is that? Never, if you have a passion for the music you like, keep on wearing them.|`|94b168e3b778f875c1c60bf262ec0752aa	Right after you start your dirt nap|`|qRM0r7eVaa	NEVERRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!|`|DnWsMhwLaa	if you like a band and want to promote them, it doesnt matter if you are 70.|`|gQkPrGAQaa	When you pass away and are buried wearing a band t-shirt|`|76d0f42b082dd7b4403317013a48817eaa	I'll quit wearing band shirts when my mullet and Camero goes out of style.|`|2c9e27b528ec302c442a3ff42014807daa	90, so you don't drool all over it!|`|AA12071039	My grandmother is 71 and wears a Norah Jones t-shirt she got in 2004.|`|YWVCaIqmaa	Never. Why should you? I think I'm gonna wear one in my grave... And I hope I'm goin to be packed on a coffin with Dark Funeral's logo on it... Or any other band I like.<br>  I have many other "things" with bands like pants, gloves, socks, hats, shoes, key chain and so on. I still wait for the band condoms to come. I think there's allready with Megadeth...<br>  <br>  So, never stop wearing your shirts... in public.|`|AA11184526	I will NEVER stop. I enjoy wearing shirts that show what music i listen to. Music is just a great part of my life and its always dependable to put me in what ever mood i need to be in. Its the only consistant thing in my life. So i will ALWAYS be proud to wear band shirts and show my love for music lol.|`|pdNMXNX2aa	Whatever age you want to. If you want to wear a band shirt when your 100 years old then wear it! If someone tries to judge you just tell them to back off. Rock stars don't stop playing just because they reach a certain age. Ozzy lost his mind but that doesn't stop him.|`|j8CeFZOvaa	I would never stop wearing band shirts. To me It's a symbol of the music I love. And since I like music so much, band shirts kind of make me happy. There isn't an age limit to wearing a shirt with your favorite band's name on it. It's actually pretty cool. Hope this helped. Peace :)|`|K5Vi0APEaa	No age. The way I see it, the older you get the more you've earned the right to wear whatever in the heck you want to wear. So if Grandma wants to wear a Green Day t-shirt, then I say "Go, Granny, Go!"|`|QJpbPWxaaa	Probably 73.224.<br>  <br>  Why would it matter? It's cloth and covers your body. Doesn't matter if it's a band shirt or not.|`|wTjshz0raa	What?! you should never stop wearing band T shirts if you truly are devoted to that band. you can be an old man and wear a Metallica shirt for all I care.|`|ijhHql0Qaa	I don't know about you, but I'll never stop wearing shirts of the bands I love, regardless of how old I get.|`|dQvKvnVuaa	NEVER!!!|`|jBCFncYTaa	AS SOON AS BORN YOU SHOULD BE WEARING A METALLICA SHIRT|`|VVqGQfJYaa	at birth,<br>  better t-shirts can be worn than band t-shirts! <br>  (and cheaper aswell)|`|EDMAqIcBaa	it depends how large you are, sometimes they never look good!|`|jlHz0Fg1aa	you shouldnt <br>  who cares? do whatever you want, as long as youre not hurting anything<br>  and what do band t shirts hurt? (unless its an MCR shirt)<br>  in fact, buying them helps the economy
ziFMYqtoaa	Yes, I've done that on the piano.  It happens sometimes!|`|gDxjINbQaa	Yea, I went back and repeated a section because the passage leading to that section also led to a different one later in the piece. So when I got to the second transition, I went back to the beginning of the piece.<br>  <br>  And my left foot was quivering so bad at the piano today that i started hit the keyboard. My god, it was embarrassing.|`|mhvb9eFkaa	Yes, but being a drummer it just sounded like a paradiddle! lol.<br>  ;-)|`|Qf3Mgaalaa	I play classical guitar.<br>  Long ago, when I started studying the guitar, I had it, stuttering some notes or some chords several times before I went to the next notes.<br>  I think it happened because I wasn't prepared well for the next chords, so I stopped at the chord by playing it repeatedly to keep the beats.<br>  And the way to get rid of this stuttering is to learn a new piece of music at a slow tempo. As slow as you can play it without stuttering.|`|jR8kyp0Taa	It would suck even more if your instrument was your voice.<br>  <br>  Ohhhhhhhhhhhh Fr-Fr-Fr-Fr-Fr-FREUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNNDE!<br>  <br>  <br>  hehehe<br>  <br>  Sometimes while practicing my trumpet, if I go to hit a note, and the tone is off, I will keep playing that same note until I get the tone right. Not on 16th note runs, but normally on the last note of those runs. Or the beginning of a legato passage.<br>  <br>  Boy Wonder|`|10mOHSZTaa	I've done that a lot. In my case it's because I recognize the patterns, so I stop reading the score, so I screw up and get lost and keep playing the one thing I recognize. Sometimes it just happens when I'm reading, but I can't figure out why.<br>  <br>  If I'm working on the rhythm of something, and someone interrupts me, I'll stutter out whatever I was saying in that rhythm. I've been working on the third of Bach's Little Preludes; my boyfriend asked me something while I was practicing, and I looked up and said, "a-WHA-a-WHA-a-WHAT?" (Caps are strong beats, not yelling.) I sounded like Porky Pig.<br>  <br>  Here is an Asian kid who looks to be 1/4 my age (I'm 16) playing what I'm working on. It's a little hard to hear the interplay between the left and right hands, but if you listen when the left hand is descending, you'll see what I mean: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHHhvAt4Hsk&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHHhvAt4H...</a>|`|64jTtN0jaa	I do on occasions, but it's only when I'm trying to learn something that is fast paced. Instead of moving on to the next note my hand likes to stay where it is and play the previous note again... It's rather annoying. <br>  <br>  I catch myself stuttering sometimes at work, but only at work. Outside of work I don't stutter. But then again when I work it's fast paced and I constantly helping folks as fast as I can x_x...<br>  <br>  So maybe when your working too fast for your brain to think you stutter xD?
yqe0I5zpaa	I loved it, it was very well-made. The love story was amazing, it really made you feel for both characters, they kept finding eachother.

ZgNPIlWFaa	well they aren't releasing that much information but from what i can gather they were on there way to the Grammies and Chris received a txt from a girl that he was sleeping around with and Rhianna read it and got really pi**ed at him so she made him pull the car over and they started fighting and she grabbed the keys and threw them out of the window of the car and that just sent him off and he started attacking her.|`|YCDS4Am8aa	well i heard on the news he got a booty call she got angry and started fighting first so he fought back and also he was angry already at her cause she was grinding all up on timbaland|`|K8e4T5nOaa	i heard about this.<br>  well apperently he was drinking earlier during a party for the grammys that both of them were at. since they were dating they left together in a limo. <br>  i would guess that he did it because he was drunk and they maybe got into a little fight (something probalby not that big of a deal) and since he was drunk he got really upset and beat her. no i dont know if this is why for sure but he was drunk. for sure. <br>  this, kids, is why you shouldnt drink. learn from his mistake|`|goe3y4FPaa	cause hes a dumba*** no other reason.. and now hes blaming his step dad.. for him... hitting rihanna.. thats just an ''excuse''  so if his dad ate sh*** from the floor... chris is gonna do that.. i dont think so.. get my ''drift''|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Because he's a misogynistic ba$tard who can't communicate well with words, so he uses his fists.|`|OtfSP7kHaa	Because she needed it.|`|jyjVRDpOaa	because she is a &*#$%<br>  <br>  jk<br>  <br>  supposedly because she was cheating on him. <br>  <br>  only they will know.<br>  <br>  <br>  don't believe the news!|`|agEgQZDMaa	i've heard that is because Rihanna gave him herpes.|`|9vccbqrVaa	Because he's a little *****.|`|x2mgUMb6aa	because she wasn't very good.<br>  because he is a prick.|`|ct62QzfVaa	b/c he ist not a REAL man
OUo9J4i1aa	wow that is really clean I'm used to gangsta rap but never mind I like Jurassic 5 and stuff like that also. I think you need some deeper lines like what you honestly think rather than sugar coating it. It doesn't have to be gangster rap that's not what I'm saying but you fail to express any pain which is what it has really caused you so you get what I'm saying?|`|ek1193Qiaa	they rhymes are really good but it talks a lot about cars|`|3hceNM0jaa	I think its amazing. Its alot better than anything I could write anyway. It probably sounds even better with music.<br>  :]|`|o2gjtUw9aa	yeah agreed<br>  the lyrics are great and really creative.  Although a little feeling is needed or its just words nothing esle, you know what im saying?|`|77taT7vvaa	Well, I don't listen rap but I write poetry and that had excellent rhyming! You were detailing it and gave me a stupendous image. Great Job!|`|cftWwsidaa	its acutal pretty good|`|fqlZVY1Raa	it's ok.<br>  add more feeling to it.

Im gonna watch it.. cant wait.. i saw the previews and it looks like some dirty laundry gonna be hung out....|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I'll probably watch it, but this is the episode I like the LEAST- the women tell all. I hate seeing this 'cause there are always a lot of hurt feelings and accusations brought back up again after the thing was over and all, and I'd rather just get on watching the show through to the proposal.<br>  <br>  Hopefully we'll have a wedding again this time!|`|Iyr1nJ4Laa	OMG!

ADBMrG87aa	Blair got stabbed because she's been causing trouble for Marty, the latest round was calling the cops to say that Marty murdered Wes.  All the people so far murdered or maimed by the mysterious serial killer so far are connected to Marty and in some way or another have done or said something to upset Marty.  Wes was about to kick Marty out on to the streets so that would upsetting to Marty.  I suspect that the serial killer will turn out to be either Miles Lawrence the nutjob who's obsessed with Marty or Marty herself with maybe a split personality.<br>  <br>   ???|`|AA12390047	It's a serial killer.  Probably the same person who stabbed Lee Halpern and Wes.  I don't think it's anyone we know.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	It's a serial killer, the same person who killed Wes and Janet.|`|2kpr2arRaa	my guess is Tea|`|ce35927379e187a9a9405823379c0faaaa	I think it's a serial killer. I notice that everyone killed or maimed so far has something to do with Marty.

Pi2jc5kZaa	OK, I play guitar and sing at the same time. Here is what I did to get there:<br>  <br>  1. Start harmonizing with each note/chord you play. Just a humming sound and practice from there.<br>  2. Start humming a different song and play at the same time. <br>  3. Start forming the actual lyrics while playing at the same time. <br>  <br>  I suggest you start out my singing easy songs, anything from Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon album is easy.|`|SmFcDx4waa	i dunno i guess you could think blasphemous thoughts about god as you play...that would be a sin i suppose...|`|jreon8v0aa	Just practice singing by itself, then guitar by itself and then together.

I foresee difficulties in making any kind of play/serial/film or other entertainment without them.<br>  <br>  I visit America often.  Their DVD stores such as Barnes and Noble have a huge selection of British TV series.  Nearly all of it is from the BBC.  Indeed, America celebrates the BBC by having  it's own channel on cable.<br>  <br>  If anyone feels aggrieved about the licence fee,  may I suggest they consider everything the BBC does rather than focus on one individual performer.  World class Television, an unparallelled radio service and a range of programming that has represented, entertained and educated Britain for over 80 years.<br>  <br>  Give me Fawlty Towers, Blackadder and The Office over Coronation Street, Gladiators and Hearbeat any day!<br>  <br>  I might further add that if you enjoy 14 minutes of mind numbing advertising in every hour of broadcast (actual ITV figures!)... then get rid of the licence fee and the BBC.  If your idea of entertainment is being brainwashed... then go ahead.<br>  <br>  Don't be fooled into thinking that commercial tv is free... it isn't.  It comes at a price and that price is the need to programme according to the lowest common denominator audience.  That means the first casualty is quality.

It's just sad people with nothing better to do.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Trolls hate all good or bad!|`|zDQIPFH2aa	Your question would be great in a chat room, but is not allowed on YA, being a chat violation.  It provides no useful facts or figures for the YA database and the question only benefits you., not the general population of users.<br>  <br>  Chat is defined in the YA Community Guidelines (link at bottom of every page). There are specific things listed that you may not think are chat, but Yahoo defines it that way and you have to live with it. You should go to the site dizzay.com and see what a YA type site looks like when chat is allowed.<br>  <br>  Just stay away from questions that simply ask people's personal opinion or personal information. Those can sometimes be ok, but most of the time they are chat. Stick with questions that only ask for facts, figures, and data like a teacher might ask in school. You can ask for example Paris Hilton's age, but you can't ask what people thought of her dress. You can ask "What is a good SUV for a big family?", but not "What type of SUV do you drive?".<br>  <br>  Chatting is asking questions that can only be answered with personal opinion and to which only you and the answerer will give a hoot. You can tell most of these by the presence of pronouns (I,we,you,me,us) or pronoun adjectives (your,mine,ours). If these are present your question will be chat 90% of the time and if you can not rewrite the question without them, it is chat 99% of the time. <br>  <br>  People have different takes on violations, but I hope you will reread the community guidelines for other types of questions that are not allowed and specifically spelled out such as Fill in the Blank questions (link at the bottom of the page).|`|E9MF18FRaa	TROLLS I TELL YOU ITS THOS TROLLS|`|S9F6RUncaa	lol I know.

mTxLvmRkaa	Thats Gods way of telling you to behave|`|AA11593134	I think because alcohol dilutes your blood, plus it dilates the blood vessels, so when you stand up, all your blood goes to your lower body, and no blood to your head...|`|7nRom97Daa	signs of alcoholism|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	That doesn't have to happen you know, like when you keep it down to only two or three drinks instead of ten.
H4isBL4jaa	No i dont think she is fat.. she is very CURVY!! which is Sexy .. <br>  its better then her STCIK SKINNY!!|`|bltgAc9Maa	Well, she is basically a very curvy woman. People can tell that she's not a stick-thin figure since she first came out in Destiny's Child. But yes, compared to the old days, she does look somewhat a bit "thicker" lately. Has she neglected her workout routine, I wonder? And the problem with that mermaid dress she wore to the Oscar is that it's quite tight on her body so it looks as if her body is about to burst open in it. Well, maybe she's happy with her marriage life, thus explains her weight gain?<br>  <br>  To me, Beyonce's body looked the best in the movie Dreamgirls. She was curvy but not too voluptuous/thick. That's the best look for her.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Btw, I just realized that you and I share the same screen name. Arrgghhh...!!!!!|`|XOlnc8iBaa	Yes she looked fat alright. May have been the outfit, but she should have looked at herself more closely in the mirror.|`|nBjlJftnaa	no.. she's just thick.. plus the dress def didn't help out at all.<br>  and did anyone notice that it looked like she was lip syncing??<br>  weird stuff..|`|UyHSZBAxaa	I saw the Oscars tonight and I don't know what you think 'fat' is but Beyonce isn't it.|`|a2b8641f3900ff3887ba8bb3aa67fb65aa	*Like u say , it just might be the dress !!~?|`|aVEVchFxaa	No, she was not. Maybe you just had on fat glasses. She's not trying to be an anorexic like Lindsay Lohan. Lindsay better get some help before she wakes up one morning and finds herself dead.

0fQk2spXaa	My biggest argument for school uniforms is safety.  If someone doesn't belong on campus, they stick out like a sore thumb.|`|tFGMfDthaa	I think uniforms are very important part of making people feel as if they belong. Not everyone is rich and can afford all the latest styles. And kids in school should have their minds focused on what they are learning and not on how someone is dressed. Sometimes I wish I had a uniform for work. Actually, I've been putting together my own uniform of polo shirts with my work logo on them to wear this summer.|`|AA12073868	As a child from the 70's I have never liked the idea of school uniforms and would have opposed any attempt to force them on our children.<br>  <br>   A simple dress code, properly enforced should be enough.|`|2qmB4pdkaa	I answer this as a teacher who worked in two different districts and got to watch the change from no uniform policy to having a uniform policy.  Without speculating on all the reasons, I noticed a change for the better in my classroom and in the hallways when the students were in uniform.  They were more respectful, and education seemed to happen more smoothly with uniforms.  So I absolutely support the idea.|`|py39L7Wraa	in my country each school has uniforms, private and government or public schools. it helps because sometimes different students may end up in fights so with the uniform it helps for them to be pointed out. as one person said it's easy to tell a student from a non student. the downside is that no one really wears the correct uniform.|`|PvlbqhlPaa	facism|`|ozCn1feYaa	I HATE <br>  SCHOOL UNIFORM<br>  <br>  they should have something like optional uniforms or something<br>  where you can wear uniform.but only if you want to|`|MSHxYrLEaa	i think its a good idea because it makes the school look smarter, and reduces peer pressure significantly

Remember this men. Women want to be noticed by us, but not smothered. Subtlety is very important for example the lovely young lady that asked this question. She would be attracted to the man who looks her in the eye and smiles with the words "Has anyone ever told you how sexy the little gap between your front teeth make you look?" This would tell her that you notice her for more than just her beauty, but the subtle nuances that differentiate her from women who are just as lovely as her. Attention to detail is important, but so is subtlety. On the other hand, don't anyone think this would be an easy way to "buy" her affection. The bottom line of this illustration is that the man that approaches a woman in this manner would be more likely to have a successful encounter than one who is boisterous and forward with financial aspirations. Here's something else to remember if perchance men, you are like the latter wealthy individual. Hide this fact in the beginning of the approach for a possible relationship, but don't bury it completely in the hopes that you can use it as "leverage" to maintain your hold on her. That's all the advice that I'll offer, but you can find out much more with Dr. John Gray's book.  Dr. John Gray illustrates many of the differences and similarities that can stimulate the growth of a healthy relationship in the book "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus". It's a metaphor for human interaction. Men tend to relate more with violent tendencies like the mythical war god Mars. Women are more emotionally nurturing with the gentle loving nature of Venus the love goddess. I apologize Wascally if I may have caused any problems using you as an example in my illustration. I do hope sincerely that I may help some men with marital difficulties or beginning strong relationships with women that they want in their lives.|`|nxymxSUFaa	A good and decent man.|`|ujIinLzGaa	A good man.|`|6UlOorwMaa	my cat|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	Their vibrator|`|2wptPP8xaa	The always seem to be smiling while riding horses .|`|qlcY8aKFaa	Men and there personal item|`|8ed1c4b4b5ab2e0f6329de8048b39995aa	I've always found my best friend to be my best friend.<br>  <br>  Maybe that's me!|`|1xd3p2x4aa	I've been trying to figure that out, would you give me a hint?|`|dKyUhbYOaa	"Diamonds"... shows how much materialism has taken over.<br>  <br>  Giving me those thumbs-down shows that my point is correct and you're pissed about what I said.

CdaCtm8uaa	Angel was a good show. Not as good as buffy, but it was still good and it has all the great moments. At times, I found Angel to be boring in season 1, but it still had its comedy. You have buffy appear a few times and also the classic cordelia. If you did not like the mean, rude, cordelia that she was at sunnydale high, you will find to know she is absolutely poor in Angel. But i personally loved Cordelia so this was kinda sad. Anyways, the cast of Angel started with just Angel, Doyle, and Cordelia. It expanded a lot by adding these characters throughout the series--> Wesley [[yea the watcher from buffy]], Illyria/Fred, Spike, Connor ect. I hope this helped and I do recommend Angel to you :)<br>  Also, if you do what I'm doingn, its kinda cool to go back and foreth with episodes of season 4 of buffy and season 1 of angel and so on. Because somethings that you don't understand in buffy will be understood in Angel. Like, in the first episode of season four in buffy, buffy gets a phone call but you never know who it was. But when you watch Angel, you find out it was Angel who called and hung up. Yea i typed alot but i want best answer a lot and yea Im a huge buffy/angel fan :)|`|7K559hbHaa	ANGEL is generally considered a more adult and darker reflection of Joss Whedon's Buffyverse.  The show maintains it's older sister's combination of action, drama, comedy and horror, but often puts a darker spin on things.<br>  <br>  The series features a main cast over it's run who don't always trust each other at times and a good deal of the characters die over the course of the show, including a handful of the main cast.<br>  <br>  Personally I like ANGEL, it's a worthy spin-off to BtVS and should be watched as several episodes in ANGEL S1, S2 & S4 interlink with BtVS episodes to give you the whole picture.  However I will say that at times it has a habit of feeling a lot like BtVS S2 set in LA with a more grown-up cast.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for even more offical BtVS/ANGEL stories from Joss and Co, Dark Horse comics publishes BtVS S8 which continues the characters adventures after S7, as well as ANGEL S6 from IDW comics which follows his series.<br>  <br>  Also if you like Joss Whedon's work check out his Sci Fi-Western TV series Firefly and it's film sequel Serenity, and Joss and Eliza Dushku's (Faith) new series Dollhouse on FOX (it's just aired it's second episode as of this week).|`|MxAy96itaa	Yes it is and has the same humor as Buffy

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."|`|qWIRefnwaa	"Fat people are harder to kidnap"<br>  <br>  :P|`|3L6REiEWaa	Mine is.

oZE510pGaa	i thought the effects were good and the supporting cast were great however the stroy moved slow and brad pitt wasnt as good as he was acclaimed for. i thought it had good art direction though|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	I thought it was an extremely well made movie with terrific performances and a great story. However, I think it suffered from being at least 30 minutes too long. They could have left out the parts at the beginning and end with the clock and the part in the middle where he has the affair with the woman at the hotel. With those parts eliminated I think it would have been a much better movie.<br>  <br>  The reason I say they should have eliminated the parts with the clock is because it wasn't really tied into the main story, and didn't really do anything to enhance the main story. Ok, so the clock was built and ran backwards over the course of Benjamin's life. So what?<br>  <br>  And I think the part with the woman at the hotel could have been eliminated because it gets away from the story. Other than a line or two of dialog, it's not tied back into the main story with Daisy. And it never seems more consequential to Benjamin's life than a trip to the barber shop.|`|n5u3rkV4aa	i really like it.....i liked how it mentioned that some people were born to do this and others to do that and the whole clock going backwards thing....however i think its plot was a little loose and not as defined and strong as it shoud have been. =D

9ko5WUFkaa	Spelling, grammar and punctuation seem to be lost here.  While some of it is lazy computer abbreviations, a lot of people just have no clue.  Excepting typo's (because we all mistype from time to time) there's no excuse, there's a spell checker!!!<br>  <br>  God help us when they start applying for jobs with their outstanding literacy skills....|`|ehMPOlefaa	I agree with Water and Kim (and even a few others here too)  As to your own question, I think that it's probably some peole's inability combined with a lack of knowledge as well.  Spell check is fine but it won't be at all useful when a person types the word 'then' in a sentence where the right word would have been 'than', or vice versa.  I also wouldn't accept any explanation that such was a typo, given the location of the two differing vowel keys on the keyboard.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Both!<br>  As with every generation they have devised their own language and way of speaking. i.e, texting speech. <br>  Also with computers and spell check most people do not bother anymore to learn the words.|`|AA12262106	It's a combination of techno-speak and laziness.|`|zYGJh5Odaa	there are alot of people that spell the way they speak.

I think it's unfortunate that the short-hand used in "text-speak" on cell phones has become the predominant form of written communication.

QazJZyg2aa	First off that show is legit! <br>  Anyways, I do. I really look for personality. Now don't get me wrong, looks are very important to me to, because if I'm going out with someone unattractive, its not cool. lol<br>  I look for both.|`|pfR5t4zkaa	I've always been one for personality over looks...<br>  But looks do help...<br>  <br>  Look at my previous dates and you'll know am not lie-ing lol...<br>  <br>  Something about good looking guys annoy me!|`|Gln3WGojaa	one thing... someone can be absolutely gorgeous, but if I can't have an interesting conversation with them I find it pointless|`|a37cc61e403f0d20764cd4a57c4b871baa	NO WAY.......looks ALWAYS over personality!|`|zKyy1gE2aa	For the most part yes, I wouldn't date someone who I thought had no looks at all but, personality means more to me. Sense of humor is what I look for.|`|dpCsTIEIaa	honestly, personality. You could find one of the hottest guy/girl out there and if their personality sucks, their not so hot anymore. I've seen alot a lot of people turn ugly fast.|`|skYjY1craa	i wish that personality would determine how good looking a person would be...|`|UdoLcwm4aa	Only at certain times.|`|q8Tkh1zdaa	looks are somewhat important.... but I look for a sense of humor the most, and if I find them attractive or not|`|bymxJfbtaa	I really do, yes.|`|TJw2CeNmaa	yes|`|d71b6bede46fcef686934136cd281153aa	i like a little bit of both|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	Well I'm not about to bang your interesting personality out of you on the first date, but a personality does help.

She was the one for me!|`|5faa7df1dbf6be8d22c72f7cca966e7baa	I definitely do.  Looks fade with passing years, but someone with a good personality can help get you through the hard times in life and also make life more interesting.|`|5uG358Xsaa	personality definitely<br>  <br>  it also brings out there beatuy|`|7R7e6yX5aa	i dig fidelity|`|AA10140520	Oh yea, & I found her, she doesn't have the body or looks of a "model", but we're happy & love each other for "who we are", not for looks, values, money, etc. (I've been used for "cash" too many times, she's been used for "sex" too many times.)|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	I want looks, followed closely by personality. I don't care what anyone says, looks are the first thing that draw you to someone. After that, if they don't have the personality to match then you keep looking.|`|AA11938631	yes, looks can be improved, also looks will fade over time, however a well rounded personality will always be there.|`|b1u9jlRhaa	look : find together<br>  personality: stick together|`|ULx2vAB1aa	i am not going to date someone who is absolutely butt ugly. looks do matter, but personali|`|8HDlfG2Iaa	if there was such a thing as a man with looks and personality it would be GREAT !! but until then personality :)|`|P5eEZCpMaa	To be honest - I want both.|`|hYbYA9HCaa	why can't I have both?

Rmtfm7qnaa	Neither. I don't tend to get a lot of answers because my questions are more specific and I tend to get very few answers. Most of them are varied, too.<br>  <br>  If I got 2 identical answers, I would give it to whoever gave that answer first... first come, first served, after all ;-)|`|nErAWfHxaa	I generally award "best answer" to the most useful answer. If two or more questions are equally useful then I look to who was more thorough. If two or more are equally thorough, then I look to see who had the best spelling and grammar. If more than one answer had good spelling and grammar, then I likely will choose whoever had humor in their answer or whoever is my contact|`|2ZLXSetRaa	i just answer d best i can<br>  <br>  without consider their points at all

Mine played with cardboard boxes and were very content to do so.|`|2WfHLUyOaa	Okay so everyone knows that woman want to be like the stars a figure to die for,..perfect hair , teeth , and of course lots of money .. for woman we look at magazines and follow the celebs and for young girls they start f with the doll that has perfect hair and body etc. You can dress up the doll and alot of it is that you can use your imagination and play with the dolls.. Do you see what im getting at.<br>  <br>  Really its a trend ...you see whats the next best thing for example the barbie doll has alway being around but then the brat doll came along and everyone started buying one and you dont wanna be left out so of course you ask daddy and mammy one but adults do the same... lady gaga seems to be the next big thing and so all of a sudden she is idolised by woman everywere.<br>  <br>  Its basically margeting . Just like boys play with balls and tractors.|`|AA10720479	I hated dolls, and always played with my brothers hot wheels. But to answer your question, I guess it's roll play. They see their mothers raising babies, and want to do the same. I guess that's why I have alot of toys now(ski boat, sport bike, fast cars,ect). I never had a barbie, and I hated every thing about dolls. You couldn't beat a good mud fight.

That's also why they play with fake Kitchen sets and stuff like that. Its an old fashioned sexist thing, and I would never give my daughter dolls to play with.|`|ozCn1feYaa	they are expected to. they are given dolls and therefore they play with them.|`|FuRZktAraa	well its most probably motherly instinct, mother loves her child very much and a doll kinda looks like a child, so she plays with it, like a mother plays and lover her child|`|mdc31lidaa	Why don't guys? Jk, I think we do because it's fun to dress up the little dollies, and make a house for them. =-D|`|seO0kwGVaa	i think girls play with dolls because it gives them of control or a motherly feeling.|`|4dSoMFWKaa	because girls like the dolls and dolls that girls play with are girls so they love to|`|Af6e3RUOaa	Because they are a mini version of themselves i think or what they wanna look like|`|qtYc8g81aa	Because they get to style them and brush their hair.|`|E3yOmel9aa	I don't know.

When i tried to unstuck it i squirted glue all over my hand and i got glitter allover it and it burned like hell.

I pulled real hard and now I can commit a crime cause I have no finger prints anymore....hmmmm|`|a1gSZzoyaa	i super glued my fingers together once...not gonna tell you how i got out of that one...|`|qLvhoRpsaa	Personally, no. I learned a  First Aid trick while halibut fishing in Alaska. If you get a cut from rigging, gear, or a knife, clean it out immediately, pour the strongest alcohol you have (it’s a fish boat, there’s booze!) and shake to dry. If you get a cut infected with the crap that you come across on a commercial fishing boat, it can be extremely serious and can end up in the loss of said finger. To help keep it clean and dry, use Crazy Glue. You have to go back to work when you are out at sea fishing. You cannot go home to get your Mom to kiss it and put a band aid on. The Crazy Glue helps seal the now cleaned out wound and will hold for a long time as well as keep the salt water and fish slime out! <br>  This was done "on purpose" and you cannot get it off. Give it a week or two and it should be gone, just in time for your cut to heal! Magic!|`|0vQsoYIbaa	I got superglued to a girl I didn't know at a party.  That was when no one knew what superglue was.  There was a happy ending.|`|2d798720df19272d2c93262dbfedc5a3aa	I superglued myself to a ceramic cat once... <br>  I ruined the poor thing after all with all the crap I tried to get it off of me.  I had to smash it off my hand and try to remove the little bit that was actually well adhered to my skin.  I ended up using a chemical in nail polish called acetone (I had it full strength from my dad's shop so it worked much better than nail polish).  Still, my finger was raw from peeling off several layers of skin.|`|g7uMKvEzaa	Just my fingers and I used baby oil and finger nail polish remover..It worked from what i remember. GOOD LUCK! if you did it too.|`|J9AvKefwaa	ha yes... my fingers, used nail polish to unstick them!

It is just my strange way to calm myself! lol|`|7769bb12a9339d6add718a4ad2b9363caa	lol,  "Don't touch me with your boob hand!" i count things like how many things are around me and how many steps there are, don't know why.|`|iWLaHVbfaa	i mess with my nose and sniff a lot as if I have a coke problem and they called me out for it....but it's just a weird habit|`|I1tnVvVGaa	when i'm not paying attention, i don't blink lol....i always hear 'ZOOM!

Zgs4RncIaa	I can tolerate everything you said too, but when someone takes a personal hit on me I will block. <br>  <br>  I have respect for others and that's all I want too. <br>  <br>  FYI I've only had to block one person.|`|AA11398236	I have never done that, so I can't say for sure.<br>  But for me to block someone is them asking like 20 questions a day. That gets annoying|`|oC8U5Bl5aa	i've never blocked anyone no matter how ignorant they are<br>  <br>  stomach apron|`|q02UN23aaa	If they are rude or if they answer one of my q's just to insult my appearance they are blocked!|`|5aXKo6uCaa	for your look at the results|`|SwlBtByzaa	cheetos and vodka now go change your socks dimwit!
4x2KMVbBaa	I'm 35 and I loved Twilight. I read the entire series too and loved it. I also got my mom to go to the movie and read the series and she loved it and she's 53. So, no, it's not a teeny bopper obsession thing at all. I mean, yes, they are the majority of the fans...but I know several older people who love it just as much, but are of course, mature enough not to say they're Mrs. Cullen and all that crap. My library science professor loves it too and she's in her 40s. I do agree that some girls are too crazy about it. I mean, it IS just a movie/book. But, as younger people, we all had our loves...|`|gA9VyfuZaa	i LOVE twilight but i think some people have taken it too far.<br>  i myself, being 13 can see this and to tell you the truth, i think that it has not been "ruined", just the whole twilight craze has become annoying. its a great book, movie was pretty good too but i think they need to stop carrying on and living in something that's not there.<br>  but in a way, yes i agree with you.|`|69ckxAIYaa	Im 14 and I read the books before they were all poplular and liked them...then eveyone read them and they got old then teh movie came out and they were ancient and annoying|`|HCInHBosaa	NO<br>  Twilight fans are awesome =]]<br>  Mainly because im one :P|`|dpSTgytfaa	On the night Twilight came out (the midnight showings) i didnt go to it because i wanted to read the book first. But after coming back from another movie i got on here and for the next three hours all that was asked on here was stuff about Twilight.<br>  <br>  By 3am that night i knew the whole dang movie by heart.<br>  <br>  I never bothered watching it because i figured, must suck as bad as it was being put down and the fact that i wouldnt see anything i didnt all ready know about.|`|mPLXUorTaa	I think Twilight ruined itself.  I read Twilight and it seemed like it was written by a 13 year old.

I guess from the hospital. My mom went in without one and came home with one.  It just stands to reason that's where you go to get them.<br>  <br>  I guess that must be what my 3rd child thought too because after a few weeks with her new baby sister she thought we should return her to the hospital.  When I told her they didn't take returns she asked if we could just flush her down the drain with no floaties on!|`|n3pSWkg0aa	when i was small, my dad told me he found me on a sale..<br>  and he said my brother was from a stork <br>  but i always thought from a hospital cuz that's where my mom went, and she came back with my brother|`|dprURFLxaa	My 2-year-old told me that I ate him and he went in my tummy then came out my butt.

She believes in telling your child the truth is the best way. And why not all this cabbage patch and stork rubbish, whats the point of it. I mean if you don't want to talk about sex, say something milder like " mummy and daddy are going to have a baby and it grows in mummy's tummy etc" Whats the problem with that if your a prude|`|GU325Ap1aa	When I was told babies that 'came out of mummy's belly' somehow I imagined they would came out of the belly button.|`|wGr95PkBaa	i didnt have the attention spand to even wonder when i was little..... i had better things to ponder....... all i remember was knowing that a baby came from a mommy's tummy and thats all i really wanted to know|`|blseasswaa	i believed the whole stork thing...and then someone told me angels delivered them to hospitals and mommies got all excited and had to go there to pick them up.|`|OQ5HAfyIaa	Planet BABIES!|`|O5n1aABNaa	The stork delivers you.

ZuWD3SVfaa	I like music that is good, I do not care what is popular I have a very wide variety of music on my i-pod from instrumental some from recent composers to the classical composers.<br>  I can go from one end of the scale to the other, I listen to what I like and what is good for myself. Stuff wanting to listen to only the popular music most of it can be shite anyway.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Because it's good - most of the stuff that's considered popular I can't stand.  I'm a huge smooth jazz fan.|`|CtJLXDJjaa	hah, because its good, im not inot all this popular stuff.... dont get me wrong, i still like to listen to it sometimes, but i would rather be listening to something different.  like damien rice, tietur, or ben harper etc....|`|Yyt8ZjU2aa	No, I actually hate most of the "popular mainstream" music. For example, I can't stand Lil Wayne or Kanye West or TI. I also hate most popular rock groups including the Jonas Brothers and Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, Paramore, etc.<br>  <br>  I only listen to the sh*t I like, regardless of its popularity status.|`|sbmzMVLraa	I like listening to songs because they are good and because I like the song.<br>  <br>  I do not like Lil Wayne as his music is stupid and he is not a good singer/rapper.|`|64cUxJn1aa	Only cuz it's popular.

I'm cool no matter what|`|07b79d340204b9e6e177e4f0be0ffa72aa	i naturally hate most music that everyone else likes. i like good music though, if there's a good song in the charts, it won't stop me listening to it...but once everyone else starts liking it too, i stop listening to it.<br>  Lil Wayne is the "best rapper alive" only because thats what his label has decided for him. the label has planted that seed in the heads of the world, and naturally people accept it. doesn't mean he actually IS the best rapper though...|`|ed5eD98aaa	Both... I usually start to like the popular music cuz it's good|`|UdoLcwm4aa	I've never cared about popular.|`|EihCVyg4aa	definitely because its good|`|bvWA6bINaa	yes

Its sad that it has come to that but what can you do.|`|YRJShhKraa	No I have not. I try not to let rumors that are most likely not true to not ruin a good show for me. I myself haven't heard to many horrible rumors about the show that would make me want to stop watching it. I enjoy the show, and plan to keep on watching it. Hope this helps! =)|`|XgAea2Olaa	i wont stop watching that show thats the best show ever how cares wat other people say i LOVE THAT SHOW!!!<br>  there new house is SOOOO KOOL!!<br>  i wish i lived there its soo awesome|`|cZhxp9f4aa	I haven't stopped watching it just because of it. I didn't watch it just because she was a stay home mom blah blah. To me Kate treats Jon like a dog :P|`|D3Fyxj0raa	no i just got tired of her treating her husband like he was another one of her kids and not her husband plus i got tired of hearing her annoying ungrateful voice|`|Leda2ha0aa	I did not watch the show from the beginning, but have watched on and off the past few years.  So many people have such nasty things to say about these people (especially Kate) and so I started to really watch it again to see if what they say is true.<br>  <br>  I do notice that on one episode Kate bragged and just touted over her new washer and dryer (whirlpool duet) and immediately I thought that they were sending her a check for doing them this service.  <br>  <br>  I truly enjoy the show and cringe every now and then at what Kate says to her husband, but people need to see that she is a stereotypical Type "A" personality and he is extremely laid back. I have worked with "A" types all my life and am use to this personality.  When things begin to get chaotic, Kate becomes frazzled and looks to Jon to help.  If he's not fast enough - she can see what is going to happen and so she becomes more insistent with what she wants done (like what to dress the kids in). She is also very specific in her mind what and how she wants things done.  If it's not right then she feels she needs to give more direction or do it herself. This goes on in MANY marriages (from my parents to friends of mine that are married) and I think many people who hate Kate for how she talks to her hubby don't really get her and aren't married themselves with so many kids.  I personally could not take on that many kids and smile and stay sane... but that's just me.<br>  <br>  So all in all, I think they do a great job and the negative things people have said on here inspired me to start watching more.  It's a good 1/2 hour of chaos and entertainment.

AA10823062	Normally, you would worry about another person's opinion for only one of two reasons:<br>  1. You think the other person is right and you are wrong. In that case, you SHOULD worry about the other person's opinion..<br>  <br>  2. You KNOW you are right but you want the other person to like you even though you are doing something the other person hates. This could happen if the other person is your boss, neighbor, someone you love, etc. In that case, you have the choice of being unhappy about the person's opinion and doing what you think is right or doing what you KNOW is wrong (for you) just to get the other person's good opinion. <br>  <br>  The bottom line is that you always need to worry about the other person's opinion but you should always do what you feel is right for you. Caring about other people (and their opinions) is a GOOD thing. But, in the end, it is YOUR life.

tMvWqGY4aa	New Jersey's Courier-Post talked to Batman Begins and The Dark Knight executive producer Michael Uslan, who expects the third installment of the Christopher Nolan-directed films, starring Christian Bale, to hit theaters in 2011:<br>  <br>  Uslan will be onboard as executive producer for the "Dark Knight" sequel, which he estimates will be theaters by 2011. As for the identity of the next round of Batman's supervillains and love interests, Uslan remains tight-lipped. "It's one of those deals where if I told you, I'd have to kill you," he says with a chuckle.<br>  <br>  In related news, while The Dark Knight did not receive the Producer of the Year Award at the Producers Guild of America Awards on Saturday (it went to Slumdog Millionaire), the movie did receive awards at the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday - Heath Ledger won for Best Supporting Actor and The Dark Knight also won Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=52278" rel="nofollow">http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews...</a>|`|SZZkfVzbaa	I think they will leave the Batman series alone now; with the whole Heath Ledger tragedy, it's best that they finish off Batman with Heath's work.

LkTcLWTOaa	No, Heath Ledger was not snubbed. He was an amazing actor and will be missed by many fans. He  was included in last year's memoriam because he passed in Jan 2008. As for the poster who said they preferred Jack Nicolson's portrayal of the Joker, Jack had nothing on Heath. He played that part to perfection!<br>  <br>  Heath Ledger Oscar Tribute<br>  The Academy honored the late Heath Ledger with an Oscar tribute at the 80th Annual Academy Awards ceremony on February 24, 2008. He was best known for his portrayal of a homosexual cowboy in the blockbuster film Brokeback Mountain.|`|EiZ69tYmaa	he was a drugged out loser and he should not have gotten an oscar. everyone talked about him as though he was a saint. he was a second rate actor with a drug problem and he is gone and no one will ever confuse him with a great actor. he should not have an oscar....he only got it for dying.|`|xE6nrLbfaa	If he was snubbed, why did he get an Oscar?<br>  <br>  I was not all that impressed with him as an actor, I preferred Jack Nicholson as The Joker.|`|AA11111233	Heath Ledger was not snubbed.  I believe he passed away before the 2008 Oscar award ceremonies were held, so they did a tribute in his honour.  They included in this year's tribute Anthony Minghella, who passed away earlier this month, if not sometime last month.|`|dh48AkbCaa	they did his tribute at last years awards, as he died in jan '08, prior to last years ceremony.<br>  <br>  also, how can they snub someone who, in recent weeks, won the oscar, golden globe and screen actors guild awards?
mko359wNaa	I use Tiscali and pay around ￡8 a month as I got my deal a while ago.<br>  There are no hidden charges, you get a wireless router and the broadband has always been reliable and fast.<br>  Virgin broadband is to be avoided in my opinion, they are always hitting you with hidden charges,installation fee, and if you download a certain amount they reduce your connection speed. <br>  I reccomend Tiscali.|`|gdGHuFA0aa	I used to work in tiscali in the billing dept and also customer services and i would just like to say PLEASE don't choose tiscali, The packages are really shoddy compared to bt and other ISP providers.

They only make the world an uglier place to live in. There isn't enough good news out there, even though many good things are happening.<br>  Not only is there something wrong with 11 or 8 year old psychotic murderers, there's something wrong with the news/media who dwell on such negativity simply for ratings.|`|3buQDaRDaa	People who say there are too many guns are idiots. The problem isn't the availability of guns. It is parents that don't know what the hell they are doing i.e. they are terrible parents. <br>  <br>  Another thing. He hasn't admitted to killing her and hasn't been found guilty yet.|`|ewDKMeJkaa	i agree =/<br>  <br>  stories like that just make you think whats the world coming to like you said|`|gnABxaKmaa	All these answers are just answers everyone wants to hear... But that is not the truth!<br>  <br>  First, people don't DO things for no reason. That's includes killing. Actual murders which involves actual phychos are VERY little... Every other murder has a motive. This is something you must realise before you analyse this incident further.<br>  <br>  Second, do you see the REAL problem of "An 11 year old boy shot and killed his fathers pregnant girlfriend, she was 8 months pregnant"?<br>  Everyone turns their attention to the boy killing... No one bats an eyelid on "his father's pregnant girlfriend". The real problem is the girlfriend... The dad and the girlfriend aren't officially married... There'll be a future kid that'll take away most of the love given to him... and the "girlfriend" probably treats him badly in the first place. I guess a lot of people who are in the boy's situation claims that they wouldn't have killed the girlfriend... But then, we are not him and we can never truly understand the pains and scars of his life! <br>  <br>  Third, now focus on the whole picture. Are you sick to your stomach because of the killing? or should you be sick because of unhealthy relationships which are built at the expanse of others? You can be selfish and said that you can do whatever you want in life (by taking in a girlfriend)... but then, note that other people can react to your selfishness by being selfish themselves (killing the girlfriend).<br>  <br>  Whenever you see news like this in the future, please analyse things on ALL sides.

7p3TCz3qaa	Taurus and Aries aren't opposites,they are next to each other in the zodiac,and they actually do get on well,but, like I've said many times you are much more than your sun signs.If you like each other ,and get along then it doesn't matter if people say your signs don't get along,it's simply not true.I have studied Astrology for many years and I can assure you that there is no proof that one sign doesn't get along with another.Some have to work harder to get along than others but in the end it's the two people in the relationship that decide how well you get on - or not - Astrology will give you information on each others traits and behaviours,it will tell you about your similarities and your differences,what it can't do is tell you how you feel about another person.So go with your feelings and enjoy the experience.|`|0Q52IPQZaa	I don't think so.<br>  <br>  I'm a Leo and I have an equal amount of Water and Air signs as friends, more than my Earth sign and Fire sign friends. I think its just your personality and how you present yourself which attracts people. Though people may argue that your star sign affects your personality.|`|f2de69824f8f7f59d202bbc8b3f22d5caa	as a taurus woman and being therefore fickle you may well get on wi the aries man as they love to flirt wi others even if your there and you may relate to this, aries are unreliable in the faithful side of a relationship mostly and taurus are ususally faithful, i wouldn't go there personally|`|tvTnjozqaa	no. stars don't determine who you can and cannot get along with.  they are stars, just big balls of fire in the universe.|`|8ZUVToXgaa	Yeah, it matters to an extent. I mean, I think almost any relationship can work out if you work at it, but Taurus and Aries are very, very different people.<br>  <br>  My cousin has been dating an Aries for at least 4 years now and it's going OK. I mean he was interested in her before she was interested in him, but I guess now they love each other.<br>  <br>  It will probably need some work put in though.

DhmUgq0maa	Yes and no.<br>  <br>  Yes it's easier in certain ways...I used to be a model, I get a lot of attention from men & women, More people approach me to talk to me, I make friends a lot easier, I have a lot of confidence, people take notice of me an listen to what i say, I get modeling offers...etc...<br>   <br>  And no because i have to deal with being called a sl*t, skank, whore, white trash, arrogant etc... a lot of women hate me before they even get to know me, men don't know what the word NO means an think if they offer to buy you a drink they've secured you for the night, People try to bring your confidence down by saying nasty things about you just because they have insecurities and want you to feel as bad as them, And apparently being blonde automatically means your a dumba§§ that puts out for everyone...<br>  <br>  May seem like attractive people have it easy but you don't see the nastiness and jealousy that they also have to deal with...|`|WvWFmwQoaa	no not really its the good looking ones who are really sad on the inside and they make their looks tell others different like for instance you see a nice pretty looking person and you automatically think they have everything they want and nothing to worry about but they really do have allot to worry about like most of them don't have a happy and stable relationship or they are in debit so no i don't think they have it as easy as they make out they do|`|cJwve90Gaa	Even as a little infant, we are programmed to look at pretty faces.    It is a natural thing for our eyes to go straight to a pretty person.    It is the same thing as when you see beautiful scenery, you will look at that side of the road and not the side with the building on it.<br>  So, goodlooking people (pursay)  DO have it easier in this world.|`|UT2tv5N3aa	yes they have lol not fair for us ugly f ***ers is it now|`|9xgGd9praa	Us better than average girls do, people can be nicer or meaner to us, depending on the amount of jealousy.<br>  And guys are always politer and nicer.|`|YnBdka6naa	Most, yeah.|`|E5rhAaLGaa	Yeah, REALLY easy<br>  Damn them|`|P5eEZCpMaa	Doesn't help that you're good looking but dumb!|`|392052a3dbd6d94cc65100310f44fccfaa	No,not really.I think it's equally hard for good-looking people as it is for less good-looking people.There are disadvantages for good-looking people as there are disadvantages for the not so.For example:If you're a good-looking female and wanna build your career intop science,be that physics,astronomy,anthropology,archaeolo... would expect you'd be less capable and smart than otherwise would if you were not so attractive.So,in this case,you need to prove yourself wrong,break the stereoypes and earn that respect that you so need in that entourage.<br>  Also,i've noticed that a lot of the guys would tend to assume that you're a slut,or easy,or a spoilt brat,or arrogant or just a huge player if you're a good-looking woman.Or,you'll be seen as a sexual object.Many guys will fail to see you for you,and dig beyond that pretty surface of yours.Physical beauty IS a big distraction,if you really want people to care about you for real and love you for YOU.So,let me think,if you're after popularity and casual sex and superficial relationships,then,it's ok to be good-looking.But if you want a REAL relationship and to just have your own piece of heaven,it's harder.You have to prove yourself against the stereotypes.And,of course,if you're an introvert,one of those typical who don't like to be in the center of attention and just wanna be chill and left alone,it's hard to stay unnoticed.Because people will notice you anyway and they'll be curious about  you,and probably even nosy.Blah.So really now,you could weigh the advantages and disadvantages and see for yourself.Sure,the compliments are nice,the admiration's nice,too,but how much does that matter when you're looking for something real? Not at all.|`|4SGBr8cWaa	it's not working for me|`|iBH7NTl3aa	no even I still have to go to work|`|BRnYseFKaa	nope, personality counts when getting to know someone.<br>  <br>  appearances only matter when you first lay eyes on someone and judge them, which is what most people tend to do<br>  <br>  besides that first split second though...no i dont think they do.|`|83f04RMRaa	sort of..so much of this world is based off of visual stimulation so an attractive person would have it easier in this world|`|LOQMQU8Saa	They got it easier yes. But that fact could also play against them sometimes|`|IkWcwsj8aa	yes in some aspects<br>  <br>  BUT they are also descriminated against as "just a pretty face"|`|RqevddVvaa	definitely<br>  I believe that even good looking "avatars" have it easier.|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	Easier, yes. Politically correct people will deny it but it's definitely true.|`|4d2a746b2c406b888ee53ccce2cd95e0aa	yes... on youtube all the hot ladies have millions of subscribers...|`|bgE2gRwSaa	Not all of them do...that would be a silly generalisation.|`|ZbZnIcoIaa	Not all of em.|`|sEpBQjQjaa	If they get lucky.|`|tkQNTs72aa	YES, they do.|`|AlBtezd6aa	yea , dats true !|`|GQJfBM5Uaa	sure if there hookers|`|GfRxRFtHaa	no|`|VCReAmkzaa	I think that they may have it worst of all.<br>  Yes, they might get material things more easily. But when you think about it, that just means that they have to try harder to learn all of those life lessons that other people have gained through experience, through not getting all of those material things so easily. They miss out on a lot on thing that really matter. It seems rare to have power and not become corrupt with it. It seems as if good looking people may have power, but without those life lessons that should improve your character what can you really expect them to do with that power? Do you see what I'm getting at?<br>  Life, to me, seems to be fair. If you have one thing, you may be missing out on another.|`|hQJpPwEpaa	I don't know about this one. Different women see different men as 'handsome'. Wher one girl might be attracted to a guy....another will not. I've heard some girls say....wow that guy is soooo hot. I've thought....no he is not any hotter than me. I think alot of it is blagging and self assured confidence. Some of us fairly short, blond haired, very young looking guys have to be very self assured and work on our 'aura' and character.....beacuse girl do not often take very young looking less mature men that seriously. Example. My twin brother attracts more women than me at first meeting.....because he  is 'considered' to have more 'classic' looks....longer manly face and just plain looks older. Very often I get ignored by the girls who like my bro. Sometimes I do get more attention from girls over my bro....but they have to get to know me first....then they like me.<br>  <br>  So I think the best lesson to learn is looks can be very deceptive. Never ever disregard or ignore a girl/guy just because you 'think' he or she is not 'good looking!' It's very often the not so conventional looking guys and girls who are more interesting....and probably better in the sack!!|`|3xz9lgB4aa	F*CK YEAH!!!!<br>  I've gone from being the ugly duckling in high school to being one of the hottest guys and its really sad how much difference it makes.<br>  People respect you. always smile at you. will do anything for you.<br>  it truly is sad|`|n3ZE9cIdaa	Yeah. It's just as easy as a b d. wait, a b e. uh,what is it again?|`|fcHN7Mrcaa	You could say that. Especially girls.|`|RV0YnoHHaa	Yeah!!!|`|gUdlaaGwaa	They certainly get more attention, but I've hard many of them complain the opposite sex won't approach them because they think they're playing out of their league. I'm not especially good looking and I don't mind cause I get by nicely.|`|Ofx0LpMlaa	yeah i suppose we have lol|`|6JimMvcDaa	Not so easy, but easier.<br>  We have no one to blame but ourselves.<br>  We pay to watch good looking people on T.V. then we make fun of the different looking people. We want to all believe that we could be that person. To be good looking and have it all.|`|J9AvKefwaa	yes and it has been scientifically proved. fat ugly old people make a bad first impression and that then clouds how people view them.|`|0QqFd23Saa	Yes.

Hollywood now faces a stiff competitor with more Americans watching Indian cinemas. I don’t know if Slumdog millionaire deserves the Oscar awards they bagged. The recent trend is comedy and therefore Bollywood has seen lots of comedy movies getting released and becoming hits. Barah Aana, for that matter, is a light-hearted comedy. I enjoyed the movie much more than Slumdog millionaire. I happened to watch the movie in Pune film festival and the movie was awesome. Check out their blog link <a href="http://barah-aana-the-film.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://barah-aana-the-film.blogspot.com/</a>|`|QHLG81pHaa	Hey I really loved it just strday i saw in " 9" NEWS channel. You know one thing Amitabh and some film producers did not like that film. i THINK they all are jealous of it !!!! I really dont like Amitabh . wt he is just tall enough in that Generation. So this Indians liked him. He has not done any action movies like Akshay or anything extraordinary films so that no one can do it . I love Rishi Kapoor  and he doesnot show what he is! <br>  But I loved the SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE  dear and it truly DESERVES IT!!!

So that shows right there that it takes talent to rap well.<br>  - Note that I am not a big fan of Hip-hop, so I am not biased in any way in saying this.<br>  <br>  Now, guitar does take talent, too. But as a guitarist, I'm sure you know that there are some pretty bad guitarists out there, and you've probably seen them. Now anyone could play the guitar, but not just anyone could play the guitar well. I bet any person who picked up the guitar for the first time could not play it well.<br>  <br>  You see the connections?<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...<br>  <br>  Anyways, yes, that does suck. It's strange, today I was just telling my friend to try out and do the McDonal's rap as a joke. He has a youtube video of him doing it, and I'm trying to get the whole school to see it haha. He's trying to take it down, but he mustn't succeed! I'm going off-topic; I'm sorry. I thikn it's stupid that they have a cut at the talent show. then some really talented people don't get to play :(<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Well, if they were not really serious and kind of just messing around, then that sure is stupid. I'm sure you took your guitar playing seriously. I think they are just going by what the kids will find interesting or cool in choosing the acts to include. In general, that is probably some crazy kids rapping to the McDonald's rap, which sure is sad. I wish that today's kids appreciated some beatiful guitar music or stuff like that.|`|XuFmnqSpaa	Well, more work went into your part than their's. They were really creative, but all they had to do was go on Youtube and find the rap, and practice some. You actually had to practice a real talent. Anyone could do the McDonals rap. Not everyone can play the guitar.|`|kP0JGI1waa	that sucks man, your talent show must be really intense bc we never turn down an act, resulting in several that are just stupid wastes of time.  post a vid of yourself playing and i can either agree more.disagree with you.  rapping does take talent as mentioned above, but i am way more impressed by a solid guitar player.|`|PeuFnqQwaa	I have to agree with you....|`|6HyFHrfIaa	Wow, I'm sorry but I, personally would be very angry. Guess these brats do not know the difference between toilet poop and culinary arts. Must be because they are 4th Root Race souls. Anywho, that does suck. People forget all about talent these days. I mean, anyone in their right mind can (Heck, if you are going to rap, make it complex and lyrical).<br>  <br>  For a person to actually to pick an instrument like Miles Davis, Stanley Clarke or John Lennon, that is talent because you put time and effort in something you love to do.|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	Well, I can't say anything about who was better than who or anything like that. No one can. I will say that it's a shame that there is a cut for the talent show. At least as of when I went to school there was never enough interest in a talent show to make it so that everyone who wanted to couldn't perform. I understand screening for content, but I think it's a shame that everyone can't participate. That part kind of jumped out at me as something that is a shame.<br>  <br>  As for the rap act, it does require talent to rap. Look at it this way. If it took no talent to rap then when your average person did it they wouldn't sound like an idiot trying. Not everyone can rap and not everyone can play guitar. It's really kind of a wash. I obviously can't say who I thought was better, and I wouldn't want to cut acts at all, but the situation for what it is I don't think it's so egregious to take a rap act over a guitar act. It's just which one came out better at the audition.<br>  <br>  I understand being bummed. I would be too. Trying out and not getting in like that but don't be "rap takes no talent" guy. It clearly does.|`|AA11184526	Well i would side with you BUT it does take talent to be able to rap good. Idk if they were good because i didnt hear it but it does take skill to be able to rap. Sure it takes more to play instruments, but thats why you have to have everyone doing good, it cant just be a one man show.|`|tcFGLlS3aa	I agree.<br>  I don't care what anyone says, rapping takes no talent whatsoever.<br>  It actually takes skill and talent to play instuments rather than talk into a mircophone with electronic musical backup.|`|XYp9vKOwaa	I Agree With You Mate, Rapping.. Any Non Talented Dumb *** Can Do It!<br>  To Be Honest Rap Is A Waste Of Time!<br>  You Should Have Made It Not Them McDonald Rapping Freaks|`|GWha8Hz3aa	Same thing happened in my school. A kid played eruption by van halen perfectly and lost to a group playing cypress hill|`|1UOnrM1Maa	There are several things you have to factor in here.<br>  <br>  A: Not many people are interested in hearing someone play a guitar, especially a mediocre, without singing.<br>  <br>  B: A lot of people can play the guitar. Less people can rap well.<br>  <br>  C: Rapping does take a lot of talent. Coordination with voices is a million times harder than with an instrument, because you can't touch anything to see if you're pressing the write key. You can't tune your voice to make it sound better. Rappers often have to go to "classes" for breathing, and learn to make use of diction, which is very difficult.<br>  <br>  D: Not anybody can rap. Personally, I despise rap. But I respect rap artists for their ability to prance around with all of their hand gestures, rap as quickly as they do without all of the breaths inbetween, and to actually play the part. <br>  <br>  E: Anyone can play the guitar. A few years of lessons will do that for anyone. Some longer than others. Rapping requires your voice, something that can't be altered without use of hormones. You either have it, or you don't.<br>  <br>  F: Maybe they didn't like the song you played.
XuFmnqSpaa	No she is not.<br>  <br>  I believe she is still going by Carey and not Cannon, because Carey is the name she became famous under. Could you imagine now saying I'm going to go see Mariah Cannon in concert? Also, Carey-Cannon does sound really retarded. Not like Longoria-Parker, which I think sounds okay, but I like Longoria better. Maybe they just don't want to. I am not changing my name when I get married. I might hyphenate, but that's it. I love my last name!|`|M7MrhmXXaa	who cares about her?|`|DEcunDd5aa	No she's not.<br>  <br>  * Probably 'cause Mariah Carey-Cannon would sound as good.|`|cUT7n5gOaa	"preggers" sounds retarded, therefor I won't answer your question.|`|EufLQ9dKaa	No, she isn't pregnant. Just a rumor.|`|1ecqcgBNaa	No.
hgqau23Waa	ARE YOU SERIOUS?????!!!!!!!! NOOOOOOOOOO OF COURSE NOT!! THAT INNOCENT FAMILY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT...THEY COULD HAVE FOUND A MUCH BETTER WAY OF HANDLING THE SITUATION...MURDERING HIS FAMILY?!? WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT??|`|SaUIJeKDaa	No of course not.....they were just a happy ordinary family...but without their deaths, there wouldn't be "the punisher" "/|`|XKhNw221aa	no, why would they?|`|qF94liibaa	They had to die ecause the Marine would have been bored otherwise.|`|lD1MBeAMaa	Absolutely not. They were killed in retribution over the death of their son Bobby.|`|kYcBVmRMaa	i have watched tht movie and no one desvered to die  lmao|`|K224LOmXaa	no dat was messed up
MLwhrBjgaa	Because it is written...|`|ErmcT4uUaa	Yes, I said the same thing when Kung Pow was up for an oscar.<br>  And that was a Japanese movie.|`|bltgAc9Maa	The Oscar is not just for American movies and/or actors. There were many non-American movies/actors that got nominated and even won the Oscars in various categories in the past incl. Best Picture, not just for Foreign Language Film category alone. Last year, all the winners in all 4 acting categories (actor, actress, supporting actor, supporting actress) are non Americans. So to answer your 1st question, no, the Oscar are not just for American movies and actors.<br>  <br>  Besides, SM wouldn't be eligible for Best Foreign Language Film because that category is intended only for non-English language films. And since all the dialogues/script in SM are in English, the movie wouldn't qualify as Foreign Language Film.|`|OeF7G0A8aa	Oscars are given to any film - the foreign film section is to allow non-English speaking films to get a chance of an oscar.<br>  <br>  Seeing the photos on Yahoo today showing the dazzling dresses and jewels on the red carpet - and then the slums in India - made me want to cry! These 'actors and actresses' combined have enough money to rebuild these slums by selling the jewels and garments they were wearing on the night!|`|oZE510pGaa	the movie was produced by americnas and distributed by an american company, foreign films mainly relates to films in a differnt language that wouldnt of beeen shown in the US.<br>  to be eligiable for best picture the film had to show in LA, be associated in some form with an american company even if that meand the distributor.|`|b8dc8adb41a42f13a584203d858553e4aa	why did they win? can't see it.|`|TcaWW4OBaa	oh, please, the british are hardly "foreign". the foreign fim category means japanese films spoken in the language, or german, french, russian, chinese, whatever other country that doesnt speak english basically.<br>  <br>  i mean surely you realise that America was colonised by the british. and Heath ledger won several oscars so im told, and hes Australian, but doubtfully foreign.<br>  <br>  anyway, slumdog millonaire is a good film. its got that guy in it, from skins. the pakistani bloke. whatshisname. yeah im not too good with names....
M5HHf6FWaa	Jack Nicholson wins hand down.|`|KHFehqzyaa	Tommy Lee Jones for me, but if you want to see a 23-year-old Jack Nicholson in a really freaky role, watch the original Little Shop of Horrors from 1960.|`|uJFXbHA7aa	Jack has had the better bad guy roles and has received more accolades; however, Tommy Lee Jones definitely makes an impression on each of his roles.<br>  <br>  Love Tommy, but there is only one Jack.<br>  <br>  BTW - You forgot Col.

A tight curve came and couldn't make it so my car flipped over a bunch of times and landed on its roof. As it landed on its roof it slid getting closer to the edge of a cliff but stopped just in time. I got out of the car and the ambulance approached me but denied to help me because I didn't have insurance. It was crazy weird. I was trying to drive really safe the next morning thinking I would get in an accident.|`|q0Dg8a1haa	Wow, I've had a LOT...<br>  <br>  1. The Joker was in this huge crowd of people and he was freezing them by poking them, one by one... then he blew up the universe, and I was in my house, and I was afraid to go outside, but when I did I found other survivors and we rebuilt civilization.<br>  2. My brother was half donkey and he took me and my other brothers camping to hide from my parents.<br>  3. I was riding in my mom's car, only it was flying and I was smoking with my head out the window, and then I went to stop at some place and got a beer. (I'm only 13 btw)<br>  <br>  Many, many more that I've had though.|`|S4W7FojCaa	I have a lot of weird dreams...<br>  <br>  I dreamed that I was overlooking an elderly couple in the past. They lived in a nice home. I watched someone murder the man, the woman screamed and ran out of the house. Then she's sitting on her porch, sun setting, a young man (teen) comes up and offers her some Ranch Dip. She accepts. (Lol I had eaten chips and dip before I went to sleep.)<br>  <br>  Another is when I was running for my life from demons. I had different hair. It started when I came up through a hole in the ground and onto a dirt path in middle of a forest. I was running and completely aware of my fear and rapid heartbeat (like I was half awake). Then I was running on top of houses (dim and scary red and blue houses). I went inside one and I met a guy...he died and then woke up. (I had watched The Descent before going to bed.)<br>  <br>  Another one was ok..not a nightmare. My grandpa was in it and he lived in a house that was among many others, it had only one room and stood up like a 100 feet in the air. He stuck his head out the door and his head was huge! That's all I remember of that one. The houses looked like something Tim Burton would design. (I had visited him that day.)|`|ch3cnSTzaa	I actually dreamed i died and and was afraid it really happened and then I woke up in a cold sweat. It was really weird cause it was the dream where i fall down this long dark hole and and i usually wake up before I hit the bottom. But this time I didn't. Freaked me out for weeks!|`|a68665ef6c4434c025138a75281114eeaa	that one minute i was 17, driving around with friend, drinking beer and smoking pot- and then next minute i was married with an 11 year old, a nine year old, and some gray hairs.<br>  <br>  o wait.... that's real|`|mJmG3i4Oaa	When my neighborhood was being invaded with large bees....<br>  that was a scary a#$ dream.! ;)|`|LOQMQU8Saa	I have many weird dreams, but the weirdest I had was when I was riding an outdoor metro train that would go in the water and then out, and then at one point the train was riding next to the eiffel tower, and under the tower were two team, one team made of metal bulls (like the one in NYC) and the other was made of metal ostriches. The two teams were playing soccer and chasing each other.|`|yLY8B4scaa	ok so mary poppins was getting it up the "chim chimminy" my bill clinton then barbra streisand comes out of no where and starts singing to mary poppins and then bill clinton runs away with cabbage.|`|hCRxXDFgaa	I seem to have really weird sex dreams about geriatric celebrities when they were in their prime... like sean connery when he played bond|`|TuGkVqwraa	I was walking on the surface of water and when I woke up from my sleep, I fell down from my cot.

We played UNO|`|8aa2f76f19d65cc5bc682422bda1ee49aa	Sometimes we have those random dreams for no reason.<br>   If you are into this sort of thing and you like to interpret them, they say there is really no answer for it, but it everyone's dreams can be a message of some kind, like a reminder or to pay attention to something in their waking life.              I don't try to interpret mine, if I have a dream that is strange or unusual, I figure out what it had to do with my life and usually with thinking it over, I find that in some way I am avoiding a situation; to confront it or else I have a way of getting recurring dreams of the same thing or the dream is situated in the same setting for example. I know then this has meaning.<br>    Such as last night, I had a dream that I visited my childhood neighborhood block in my town and I passed my Friend's houses whom I still am in touch with.          For this, I can say probably I am missing my childhood and my dream took me there.    See?<br>  <br>  I have had many dreams that make me wonder but there is one I had a few years ago and I won't forget it.      Long story short....................<br>   My mom passed away in the year 1994.  every once inawhile I dream of her, well in this particular dream I was at some previous apts. I lived at when I was a single parent in the 80's and my mom was very much in my life then.    So in this dream, I am outside of the apt, and I don't have my car as I needed to go somewhere and my Mom walked up and handed me her car keys to borrow hers.  I walked to the curb to go and her car was nowhere around as I was looking for it.   I turned to go and tell her and I looked by my apt. and she was walking into an apt. over there.  I followed her and she walked into an apt. that had the number 13 on the door. I didn't knock, I was bewildered about the number for some reason and then I walked away and down the neighborhood street and next thing I knew, I woke up.        I told some friends then about it and they assumed it was a bad sign because of the number 13.     I don't believe that for a minute.  It isn't a concern or anything about the number but since the dream, I wonder alot why this would have so much significance to it.      Doesn't mean it is something bad.            Aren't I right?<br>    After all, dreams only have meanings to the dreamer; no one else.|`|CWqzvsK2aa	I dreamed I died, ended up at the gates of Heaven<br>  Greeted by a man Saint someone, said how’s the ride son?<br>  It’s been alright, at times a little rough, but why am I here?<br>  You did alright, lived a little dark and that’s alright<br>  <br>  ‘Cause we made the darkside and the rightside is to have no fear, no fear<br>  My whole life flashed in front of me<br>  I saw everything that I was and what I had done<br>  Even let me look back on some good times for a little fun<br>  Yes, a little fun<br>  And then I heard damn boy you done good<br>  Did the every little thing that you could<br>  And then I heard damn boy you done good<br>  Damn good|`|gTslbP6Baa	Iv had allot of weird dreams but i think the weirdest ever! would have to be the one where i was just randomly walking down this road when a pink unicorn walks out, so i climb on its back for a ride and it disappears into smoke,i fall and hit my head because of it and wake up surrounded buy leprechauns trying to get me drunk. lol!|`|yte0BzXKaa	When i was SEVEN i had a dream i had sex with a gorilla and then had a 5 some with loads of girls.<br>  When i woke up i had wet myself.<br>  <br>  Weirdest dream ever, and when i was 7 i didn't even know about sex.|`|Jaaasoolaa	i had a dream that the clouds were coming down and i got really scared it was so weird and i went out in to the street and i told her why are the clouds coming down|`|HYPMGkj9aa	Very weird dream!<br>  <br>  I had a dream I was sledding on a saucer and I pulled up a little.

The songs I have selected are not just dance sequences type with 50 dancers behind thew main lead actors, nor about songs that titillates the hormones. The songs are selected purely on the merit, on melody, based on the universal theme of love<br>  <br>  10. Do Do Do Do - Raamji Londonwaley : The slowly developing love between Madhavan and Samita Bangargi in Ramji londonwaley is nicely shown through this song, Suresh Wadkar and Alisha Chinoy provide that hard outside but soft inside kind of feeling.<br>  <br>  9. Mujhe Tum yaad Karna - Mashaal : Just one reason is enough, picturised in the Great Indian Railway Yard. Indian Rail which is soul of India and the lifeline of the middle class population back then. Unusual combination of Rati Agnihotri and Anil Kapoor worked very well plus the rain in the train.<br>  <br>  8. Mere Jeevan Saathi - Ek Duje Ke Liye : One boy, one girl in the lift, lift stops and both start singing a song which has just the film names in the lyrics but cleverly done to show the perfect emotions. The police sequence in the end shows the rebellious side of the lovers, ready to face any challenge from the society, and if necessary fight back to keep their love alive.<br>  <br>  7. Koyal Si Teri Boli - Beta :  Again just one reason is enough, great visuals of erstwhile splendour and richness of the palaces of Indian Maharajas neatly incorporated in the song along with the superb dance of Madhuri in the galleries, generous use of the greatest love instrument of all time - the Basuri (flute), very melodious and good song.<br>  <br>  6. Dheere Dheere Pyaar Ko - Phool Aur Kaante : Nadeem Shravan magic in full flow, very touchy song with great lyrics. Love of  Ajay Devgan for Madhu, love of both parents for their child, and love of child for their parents shown beautifully.<br>  <br>  5. Sapno Ke Ghar Ki - Daddy : Dads' love for his daughter, I would have included the song of Hare Rama Hare Krishna - Phoolon ka taaron ka, but that song feels like it is giving a preaching, but this song from Daddy clearly shows the love.<br>  <br>  4. Chod Do Anchal - Paying Guest :  Lovers wanting to love but scared of being caught, scared of the society but so strong is the will to love that they are willing to ignore the basic societal norms. This scandalous message is shown by this great Dev Anand Nutan song with absolute intent  along with decency, message very unusual for 1957 society, the song became an instant hit amongst rebellious lovers. This song was recently raped and murdered by the Bombay Vikings.<br>  <br>  3. Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kyaa - Mughal Ae Azam :  Fearless love not afraid of the mighty emperor's wrath, this emotion is very well sung by the great Lata Mangeshkar.<br>  <br>  2. Kabootar Jaa Jaa - Maine Pyaar Kiya : Distance is not a problem for true lovers they somehow manage to communicate with their love, be it with the help of an unusual messenger - the Dove. Again heavenly voice of the great Lata Mangeshkar makes this love song even better<br>  <br>  1. Pyaar Hua Ikraar Hua - Shree 420 : The greatest love song of Hindi Film Industry. Popular even today. Greatest rain song of all time. Great chemistry between Raj Kapoor and Nargis. Great Shankar Jaikishan music with magical voice of Manna Dey and great Lata Mangeshkar.<br>  <br>  The ones that missed out narrowly in my list are:<br>  <br>  Dil Mera - KNPH<br>  <br>  Dekha Ek Khwab - SilSila<br>  <br>  Karwaten Badalte Rahen - Aap ki Kasam<br>  <br>  Mere Sapno Ki Rani - Aradhana<br>  <br>  Dream Girl - Dream Girl<br>  <br>  Chukar Mere Man Ko - Yarana<br>  <br>  Chandan Sa Badan - Saraswati Chandra<br>  <br>  modern day songs r not good enough to take on theese|`|QbcnDDxUaa	Aaja Sanam Madhur Chandni Mein (Chori Chori)<br>  * Aankhen Bhi Hoti Hai Dil Ki Zuban (Haasil)<br>  * Abhi Na Jao Chod Kar (Hum Dono)<br>  * Ae kaash ke hum (Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa)<br>  * Aye Mere Humsafar (Quayamat Se Quayamat Tak)<br>  * Aye Uri Uri Uri (Saathiya)<br>  * Baahaon Ke Darmiyan (Khamoshi)<br>  * Chalo Dildar Chalo (Paakezah)<br>  * Chehra Hain Ya (Saagar)<br>  * Chookar Mere Man Ko (Yaarana)<br>  * Dil Ka Bhanwar Kare Pukar (Tere Ghar Ke Samne)<br>  * Do Dil Mil Rahein Hain (Pardes)<br>  * Dil Tadap Tadap Ke (Madhumati)<br>  * Pyar Hua Iqrar Hua (Shree 420)<br>  * Humein Tumse Pyar Kitna (Kudrat)<br>  * Jo Wada Kiya Woh (Taj Mahal)<br>  * Khoya Khoya Chaand (Kala Bazar)<br>  * Ehsaan Tera Hoga Mujhpar (Junglee)<br>  * Ek Ajnabee Hasina Se (Ajnebee)<br>  * Ek Ladki Ko Dekha (1942 A Love Story)<br>  * Hoshwalon Ko Khabar Kya (Sarfarosh)<br>  * Pehla Pehla Pyar Hain (Hum Aapke Hain Kaun)<br>  * Hum Hain Is Pal Yahan (Kisna)<br>  * Jiya O (Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hain)<br>  * Karvate Badalte Rahen (Aap Ki Kasam)<br>  * Khwaab Ho Tum Ya (Teen Deviyan)<br>  * Lag Jaa Gale (Woh Kaun Thi)<br>  * Mein Shayar To Nahin (Bobby)<br>  * Mein Yahan Hoon Yahan (Veer-Zara)<br>  * Mein Koi Aisa Geet Gaaun (Yes Boss)<br>  * Mere Sapno Ki Rani (Aradhana)<br>  * O Re Chori (Lagaan)<br>  * Phoolon Ke Rang Se (Prem Pujari)<br>  * Raat Akeli Hain (Dev Anand)<br>  * Suraj Hua Madhyam (Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gum)<br>  * Tere Mere Milan Ki Yeh Raina (Abhimaan)<br>  * Tere Mere Sapne (Guide)<br>  * Tere Mere Beech Mein (Ek Duje Ke Liye)<br>  * Tujhe Dekha To Yeh Jana Sanam (Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge)<br>  * Tum Aa Gaye Ho (Aandhi)<br>  * Tum Bin Jaaon Kahan (Pyar Ka Mausam)<br>  * Tumse Milke Aisa Laga (Parinda)<br>  * Dil Cheez Kya Hain (Umrao Jaan)<br>  * Kabhi Neem Neem (Yuva)<br>  * Pehla Nasha (Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar)<br>  * Chura Liya Hain (Yaadon Ki Baarat)<br>  * Jab Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya (Mughl-e-Azam)<br>  <br>  ww.smashits.com/music/hindi-film/songs...|`|VzMVNRLwaa	Khuda jaane(bachna ae haseeno)<br>  Teri ore(Singh is king)<br>  kal ho na ho (kal ho na ho)<br>  jashn(jodha akbar)<br>  <br>  etc.....................|`|yYQfqRtMaa	jab koi baat bigad jaye jab koi mushkil pad jaye............|`|AA11116002	Almost every movie in Bollywood has romantic and love songs, it really depends what you are looking for.

I would think that you had an issue, if you were not speaking to me then i would leave you alone to work out your problem.

JjNgIyJgaa	well, if you both read the manga AND watch the episodes, you should have noticed that one episode is pretty much equal to the length of 3-5 manga chapters. The episodes air every week, but there is only one 17-page chapter for the manga. the series catches up really fast. If there was no filler arch at the moment, but the episodes went on to the next part in the manga, not only would everything be really fast, the episodes would have caught up to the 'end' of the manga really fast, leaving only about 30 chapters. that would mean masashi would have to write a lot more each week, or the episodes would have to come out at a much slower rate. So when the episodes start to 'critically' catch up to the manga, the make the series longer, to give 'more time for the manga to go ahead' of the series. In the last Naruto series, when the had about a hundred consecutive filler episodes, it was probably because the series had seriously caught up to the manga. and also, it was a 'perfect spot' for fillers, because there was a break in the story. But they still take parts of the manga to put it into the series, it's just that in the manga at this point there are a tremendous amount of different stuff going on at the same time. They're just stretching it out (and adding stuff of their own too, i admit).<br>  <br>  hope this cleared up the situation for you, at least a bit.|`|Z15TM1VQaa	Naruto is amongst the top 10 best mangas in America and Japan. Because it's so popular the people in the studio that make the anime is hopping to get more money from the anime by sending out so much fillers and twisting them into the plot.|`|6rR7LTl1aa	"Just a little more..."<br>  <br>  Besides, it's Naruto, and the studio knows it can be milked even further.<br>  That's all the reason the studio needs.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Ayanna, pretty sure that he wasn't asking that.|`|3BfmNEdPaa	If your wondering why we watch it it's because we want to see what happens when they get older. If you watch the series then you'd know that Sasuke ran away. Everybody wants toknow if they find him. And if they do, do Naruto and him fight again cause thier fight was #1 in the top five ninga battles ep.<br>  LONG LIVE NARUTO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GPEC8tocaa	yes you can take your digital camera. the 6in rule is probably because the flash on those camera is crazy bright and a little bit distracting. it probably depends on the performer themself weather or not you can take pictures of them while preforming, but he's been around long enough, that i'm sure it doesn't bother him anymore. if anything just keep your flash off.|`|HtAXbr2Taa	Unless they say you cant take pictures then yes.|`|yMgIoYmhaa	At concerts you are not allowed to take pictures or videotape the concert but people do anyways. They sneak cameras in, like cell phone cameras or they have a trick on how to hide cameras that are not cell phone cameras. Call the theater ask if any cameras are<br>  allowed during that show, you may not be able to take a picture with<br>  the flash on. If they say you can bring your basic digital camera but<br>  No Flash Photography is allowed. Just forget your pictures won't come<br>  out good if you can't use your flash.|`|6tfDuytlaa	From what you said, it sounds like its okay to bring a digitial camera. They will let you take pictures, but probably no video or flash.<br>  Have a good time =)

BpOXKd2xaa	i was wondering the EXACT same thing!!!!!!!!! like i haven't seen slumdog millionaire but from what i have read and what i have heard the Dark Knight was WAYYY better!!!!!!!!!    i don't care if it was based on a comic book or not the movie was AMAZING!!!!!!!!|`|X8u7FMBnaa	Because the people who nominate the movies usually vote for the underdog movies or feel good stories. Rarely action movies because they are a conservative bunch and The Dark Knight was action packed. At least they gave Heath Ledger what he deserved. Thats what counts.|`|JmHBplRIaa	I agree! It's only artsy films that get nominated. Peh.|`|qVFqw8iLaa	Errrm.... Because it sucked ??|`|KEsf9ziJaa	fiction movie and comics cant be the best any whrere|`|2WKN9kZiaa	TOTALLY agree with JK<br>  they are given to people who are making the effort to be known!! whereas people that make AWESOME movies such as dark knight arent given recognition because EVERYONE KNOWS it was an AWESOME movie|`|yqe0I5zpaa	It was advertised as an "superhero, action movie" the movies that the Academy looks for are well acted dramas, thing is, HOLY CRAP! The Dark Knight was a well-acted drama. Well, the Academy likes well-made films, wait HOLY CRAP, it was well-made! Script? Music? Director? Were all of those done well .... no way!!! You got me, The Dark Knight was incredibly snubbed.|`|q6uyloYdaa	Too many industry folks would be up in arms if it were. I thought it was a good movie, but in the long run it was just another superhero action movie. The only actor who did a decent job was Heath Ledger, and he got his due credit.|`|Gem96NQyaa	Because despite some excellent performances IN Dark Knight, the movie as a whole was just another comic book movie.  It wasn't all that great (and this is coming from someone who is a huge Batman fan).|`|48b84a8f546ab32d894f3370f4eca47faa	Because few Comic Book films have ever if ever been nominated for that honor, and The Dark Knight is no different.|`|087668cd7a5ba290ec84fbbb0fd621eeaa	because the Academy hates comic book movies. Instead the would rather nominate movies like Slumdog Millionaire that nobody has seen or cares to see.

Nb78LtG9aa	Quest Crew, of course.<br>  They are consistent and creative every single week.<br>  The only time they were put down by the judges was for "posing" and having sloppy transitions.<br>  <br>  Honestly, well doesn't every crew "pose"? Not a good reason, JC.<br>  Well I guess sloppy transitions are good comments but I don't think that it only refers to Quest Crew.<br>  <br>  Beat Freaks are sloppy all around.<br>  If you watched the latest episode, check them out during the housing section AND the krumping.<br>  <br>  However, MAJOR props to Beat Freaks for the tutting and ending (when they fogged up the camera and wrote "BF"), I thought those were really creative.<br>  <br>  Well, at this point, any crew can take the win.<br>  I have mad respect for Beat Freaks, but I have to tell the truth, they aren't as clean and creative as quest. For example, their Britney performance... don't you think that it was completely copied from the video, EVEN the outfits? Whatever, don't hate me for my opinion.<br>  <br>  Go Quest (and D-Trix<3).<br>  <br>  May the better crew win.|`|9UgGwvtlaa	BEATFREAKS ALL THE WAY<br>  questcrew is like another kaba and wannabe jaba....i think therye a great crew,great b-boy movements especially with the air flares,but they "pose tooo much", thats their biggest flaw...but mtv will probably have beatfreaks win because its an all female group.for 2 seasons, its been men winning.<br>  I love questcrew<br>  but i think beatfreaks should win<br>  <br>  BEATFREAKS!!|`|sMa56Y0Laa	I like how you didn't even mention Fly Khicks (wtf? how do people like them?). But yeah, I've been with Quest since the beginning of this season and I'm definitely not changing my mind now. Quest is entertaining in both their dancing and their personalities. On the other hand, Beat Freaks are really good dancers all around (popping, locking, b-girling, etc) and they seem to have more fans. So, I HOPE Quest wins, but it'll be a really close call because they are both great crews (Quest was my favorite this season and Beat Freaks were my 2nd favorie :).|`|w4qS66aqaa	I LOVE QUEST CREW! they are so entertaining and have been consistently good the entire competition while beat freaks had 2 good performances. i think quest has the real talent, and heres a video to prove it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrXKo93nywI&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrXKo93ny...</a>|`|5DJcir9saa	Beat freaks need to win!!!

RAHAMAN, THE GREAT!<br>  Congratulations!|`|CUqXYNHvaa	Slumdog Millionaire. It's time to party, Slumdoggystyle, Mumbai! Eight awards, including Best Director and Best Picture. What an achievement. What a night. The whole cast and crew is up on the dais, over twenty strong. Jai Hindi! They're calling Mumbai a 'fabulous' city. Anil Kapoor is there, immaculate mustache on display! What a night! <br>  <br>  And now the Don of Hollywood on to present the Best Picture Award. Steven Spielberg announces that the winner is... <br>  <br>  Stunning visuals accompany the run-up to the presentation for best Actor. And though most thought that Brad Pitt or Mickey Rourke would carry the day, instead it is Sean Penn for his role in Milk, who's captured the award! Congratulations, Mr Penn! A bit of a political speech from Mr Penn. But that's to be expected. <br>  <br>  The winner is Kate Winslet for The Reader! She breaks the 13 year curse and is justly rewarded for her fantastic work, year in and year out. Now, let's see how she handles this speech. <br>  <br>  And again they're using this interesting format, where former winners announce the nominees in a given category. This time, it's best Female Lead (former winner Halle Berry looks stunning! Sophie Loren? Not so much). Up for the award are Anne Hatheway, Kate Winslet, Meryl Streep, Melissa Leo and Angelina Jolie. <br>  <br>  And he's done it! Danny Boyle has done it! Best Director for Danny Boyle and Slumdog millionaire. He jumps for joy (literally), and with good reason. It's the films seventh award. He gives a great speech and finishes it off with a heartfelt thanks to Mumbai. <br>  <br>  Again, must mention how impressive Hugh Jackman has been. The rugged Aussie is deftly manoeuvring about the stage, controlling the action without hogging the limelight. He passes the stage on to Reese Witherspoon, of Legally Blonde fame, who is wearing a gorgeous dark blue/purple gown. She's giving the award for Best Director, where Danny Boyle must be considered the favourite. <br>  <br>  Looking regal and royal in blue, Queen Latifa is on-stage in a gown quite befitting of her name She leads us into another of these cool montages. The big awards are so close we can almost taste them! Only a few more minutes! <br>  <br>  Looking regal and royal in blue, Queen Latifa is on-stage in a gown quite befitting of her name She leads us into another of these cool montages. The big awards are so close we can almost taste them! Only a few more minutes! <br>  <br>  Now the lovely, exquisite, delightful Freida Pinto is on-stage to present the award for Best Foreign Film. The girl exudes class, whether it's on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, in the pages of Vanity Fair or on the red carpet at awards show. The winner is Departures, a Japanese film. <br>  <br>  And Jai Ho has won the Oscar for Best Song! Two Oscars for India's finest modern musician! What a night to remember. India at the Oscars will never be looked at the same. And a classy, gracious acceptance speech from Mr Rahman. Well deserved, sir. Well deserved. You've made all of India proud! Slumdog, for those keeping count, has collected a staggering six awards already. <br>  <br>  And an incredible treat, the great AR Rahman is performing live at the Oscars. Wah! Wah! Triple Wah! O Saya is by Rahman himself, and accompanied by a platoon of dancers and drummers. It segues to a Western song and soon comes back to Rahman. This time, it's the song that made the film famous: Jai Ho! And now it's a collaborative effort. East meets West. And it sounds great! The crowd is on its collective feet, applauding. Now, to see how he does in the Best Song category. <br>  <br>  And the winner is AR Rahman for Slumdog Millionaire! He's looking dapper in a black sherwani. Like a good Indian boy, he mentioned his mother and said a few words in his native tongue. India has arrived, ladies and gents. There's no point denying it now! <br>  <br>  A lovely piece of orchestral music leads us into the award for best Original Score. AR Rahman, India's son, is up for the award... <br>  <br>  Ahh, we're well past the halfway stage, at this point. Now it's time to dig into the really meaty awards: best film, actor, actress, director, etc. Where as previous years have dragged, this year's show is flying by. <br>  <br>  And we're back, to find the enormously talented, uproariously funny Eddy Murphy on-stage. He gives a classy introduction to film legend and comedy guru Jerry Lewis, who comes on briefly to accept the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian. <br>  <br>  And the winner is Slumdog Millionaire!??! Wah! Wah! The film is really and truly hitting a six in cinema's version of the World Cup. Chris Dickens brings it home (Best Film Editing), with a classy and gracious 'thank you'. In true stiff-upper-lip fashion he thanks his Indian hosts, his English friends and his own family. Classy, classy. Slumdog has won four awards! <br>  <br>  Another award presented by Will Smith? He might as well have been named co-host. The award is for Best Film Editing. Can Slumdog win another? <br>  <br>  And the Best Sound Mixing award goes to Slumdog Millionaire's Resul Pookutty.

It's time to party, Slumdoggystyle, Mumbai! Eight awards, including Best Director and Best Picture. What an achievement. What a night. The whole cast and crew is up on the dais, over twenty strong. Jai Hindi! They're calling Mumbai a 'fabulous' city. Anil Kapoor is there, immaculate mustache on display! What a night! <br>  <br>  And now the Don of Hollywood on to present the Best Picture Award. Steven Spielberg announces that the winner is... <br>  <br>  Stunning visuals accompany the run-up to the presentation for best Actor. And though most thought that Brad Pitt or Mickey Rourke would carry the day, instead it is Sean Penn for his role in Milk, who's captured the award! Congratulations, Mr Penn! A bit of a political speech from Mr Penn. But that's to be expected. <br>  <br>  The winner is Kate Winslet for The Reader! She breaks the 13 year curse and is justly rewarded for her fantastic work, year in and year out. Now, let's see how she handles this speech. <br>  <br>  And again they're using this interesting format, where former winners announce the nominees in a given category. This time, it's best Female Lead (former winner Halle Berry looks stunning! Sophie Loren? Not so much). Up for the award are Anne Hatheway, Kate Winslet, Meryl Streep, Melissa Leo and Angelina Jolie. <br>  <br>  And he's done it! Danny Boyle has done it! Best Director for Danny Boyle and Slumdog millionaire. He jumps for joy (literally), and with good reason. It's the films seventh award. He gives a great speech and finishes it off with a heartfelt thanks to Mumbai. <br>  <br>  Again, must mention how impressive Hugh Jackman has been. The rugged Aussie is deftly manoeuvring about the stage, controlling the action without hogging the limelight. He passes the stage on to Reese Witherspoon, of Legally Blonde fame, who is wearing a gorgeous dark blue/purple gown. She's giving the award for Best Director, where Danny Boyle must be considered the favourite. <br>  <br>  Looking regal and royal in blue, Queen Latifa is on-stage in a gown quite befitting of her name She leads us into another of these cool montages. The big awards are so close we can almost taste them! Only a few more minutes! <br>  <br>  Looking regal and royal in blue, Queen Latifa is on-stage in a gown quite befitting of her name She leads us into another of these cool montages. The big awards are so close we can almost taste them! Only a few more minutes! <br>  <br>  Now the lovely, exquisite, delightful Freida Pinto is on-stage to present the award for Best Foreign Film. The girl exudes class, whether it's on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, in the pages of Vanity Fair or on the red carpet at awards show. The winner is Departures, a Japanese film. <br>  <br>  And Jai Ho has won the Oscar for Best Song! Two Oscars for India's finest modern musician! What a night to remember. India at the Oscars will never be looked at the same. And a classy, gracious acceptance speech from Mr Rahman. Well deserved, sir. Well deserved. You've made all of India proud! Slumdog, for those keeping count, has collected a staggering six awards already. <br>  <br>  And an incredible treat, the great AR Rahman is performing live at the Oscars. Wah! Wah! Triple Wah! O Saya is by Rahman himself, and accompanied by a platoon of dancers and drummers. It segues to a Western song and soon comes back to Rahman. This time, it's the song that made the film famous: Jai Ho! And now it's a collaborative effort. East meets West. And it sounds great! The crowd is on its collective feet, applauding. Now, to see how he does in the Best Song category. <br>  <br>  And the winner is AR Rahman for Slumdog Millionaire! He's looking dapper in a black sherwani. Like a good Indian boy, he mentioned his mother and said a few words in his native tongue. India has arrived, ladies and gents. There's no point denying it now! <br>  <br>  A lovely piece of orchestral music leads us into the award for best Original Score. AR Rahman, India's son, is up for the award... <br>  <br>  Ahh, we're well past the halfway stage, at this point. Now it's time to dig into the really meaty awards: best film, actor, actress, director, etc. Where as previous years have dragged, this year's show is flying by. <br>  <br>  And we're back, to find the enormously talented, uproariously funny Eddy Murphy on-stage. He gives a classy introduction to film legend and comedy guru Jerry Lewis, who comes on briefly to accept the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian. <br>  <br>  And the winner is Slumdog Millionaire!??! Wah! Wah! The film is really and truly hitting a six in cinema's version of the World Cup. Chris Dickens brings it home (Best Film Editing), with a classy and gracious 'thank you'. In true stiff-upper-lip fashion he thanks his Indian hosts, his English friends and his own family. Classy, classy. Slumdog has won four awards! <br>  <br>  Another award presented by Will Smith? He might as well have been named co-host. The award is for Best Film Editing. Can Slumdog win another? <br>  <br>  And the Best Sound Mixing award goes to Slumdog Millionaire's Resul Pookutty.

A global online tourism vendor, Expedia.com. inTM, which has unveiled a Oscar holiday destination package, is promoting Dharavi and the city of Mumbai as one of the hottest tourism destinations this spring and summer.<br>  <br>  'I am amazed by the size of Dharavi. I have never seen anything like it,' Trout, who planned his trip online on Expedia.com, told IANS from Mumbai.<br>  <br>  A bulk of Mumbai's recycling units are based in Dharavi, apart from pottery and textile industries. The slum that has an estimated 15,000 single-room factories has been featured in several international publications.<br>  <br>  Managing director of Expedia Asia Pacific, Arthur Hoffman attributes the popularity of the destinations made famous by the movies nominated for Oscar awards to the impact cinema has on the travellers' psyche.<br>  <br>  'Movies have a powerful ability to evoke a sense of the exotica about the locations in which they are filmed. They are widely acknowledged to inspire travel to those destinations. For travellers, the fascination of picturing scenes in the film and then comparing it to real life can lead to a strange sense of deja vu, particularly for those who have seen the movie several times,' Hoffman said.<br>  <br>  According to Expedia sources, post 'Slumdog Millionaire', Mumbai now tops the chart of global tourist destination followed by countries like Japan, made popular by the movie 'Memoirs of a Geisha', South America because of 'Motorcycle Diaries' based on Che Guevera's life, and New Zealand for the 'Lord of the Rings', which has 17 Oscars to its credit for the trilogy.<br>  <br>  The top 10 Oscar destinations - in which popular Hollywood Academy award-winning movies were shot over the last four decades - include Mumbai ('Slumdog Millionaire' in 2009), Kyoto in Japan ('Memoirs of a Geisha' in 2006), South America ('Motorcycle Diaries' in 2004), New Zealand ('Lord of the Rings' in 2004), Scotland ('Braveheart' in 1995), Transylvania in Romania (Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' in 1993), America (various locations related to the movie 'Thelma & Louise'), Florence in Italy ('Room with a View' in 1985), Kenya ('Out of Africa' in 1986 ) and Salzburg ('The Sound of Music' in 1965).<br>  <br>  According to Hoffman, each of these destinations unveiled by Expedia has interesting histories which are linked to international cinema and the Oscar awards. 'Slumdog Millioniare', for instance, tells the story of a young uneducated man from the Dharavi slum in Mumbai.<br>  <br>  The movie captures life and locales of Mumbai- both in the shanties of Dharavi and in the homes of the rich. The music of the movie, which is the toast of the Oscar, captures the diversity of musical genres of the country.<br>  <br>  The ancient province of Transylvania in Romania for example - immortalised by Bram Stoker's 1992 classic 'Dracula', which won three Oscars in 1993 - is known for its famous castle of Bran, supposed to have been the home of prince Vlad Tepes, who inspired the Dracula legend. It is also one of the picturesque provinces of Romania.<br>  <br>  Kyoto, where was the movie 'Memoirs of the Geisha' was set, is home to the Kiyomizu temple, the Fushimi Inari shrine and the rich geisha culture of Japan. The movie won three academy awards.<br>  <br>  Scotland made famous by 'Braveheart', won five academy awards. The movie features the famous Scottish highlands, the river Nevis and the famous castle of Edinburgh.<br>  <br>  Hotels and local tour operators are offering discounts to woo tourists in the season of the Oscars. A trip to any of the foreign locations, if made on a shoestring budget, said sources in Expedia, would not exceed Rs.300,000.<br>  <br>  it mumbai meri jaan..........................|`|GbciNkZeaa	You already got the answer :)|`|FP6VLDaiaa	we win  oscar<br>   of 2009 slmudog mlledera  and a.r raman|`|YDyhZXQCaa	probably slumdog is  the best movie.<br>  it won many oscars.<br>  a r rehman was one of them.|`|kvaQIlySaa	Slumdog millionaire has won 8 awards......congrats 2 the entire team....|`|24dQzG9Yaa	www.oscar.com<br>  u can have all the info u need|`|lDCQVdioaa	<a href="http://www.24timepass.com/blogs/kate-winslet-gets-oscar-for-best-actress.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.24timepass.com/blogs/kate-win...</a>|`|AA11181253	click the below link to know it:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hindu.com/2009/02/24/stories/2009022457771700.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hindu.com/2009/02/24/stories/...</a>|`|AA12096290	The full list:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://thetvuniverse.blogspot.com/2009/02/2009-academy-awards-winners.html" rel="nofollow">http://thetvuniverse.blogspot.com/2009/0...</a>|`|CbB6KEueaa	its slumdog millionaire which has been chosen as the best film an A.R. rahman has got 2 oscars|`|JHPHlKenaa	slum dog millionair and smile pinky|`|qBX3SyZfaa	dog dog|`|yYQfqRtMaa	slumdog|`|yQCg9Kemaa	Indian's all the way.....:)|`|JFmb0o0Raa	Sean Penn Anne Hatheway, Kate Winslet, Meryl Streep, Melissa Leo and Angelina Jolie, Danny Boyle, Hugh Jackman, Queen Latifa,Freida Pinto, AR Rahman, Eddy Murphy, Resul Pookutty...|`|tz8Wv9Ktaa	Slumdog Millionaire|`|KEsf9ziJaa	best movie -slumdog and 2 music awards for AR rehman and best actess:Katewinslet and best supportin actress is Penolape cruise and Slumdog bagged 8 awards|`|5oDsmJzIaa	katewinslet|`|7clgyjkeaa	slamdogmilenior|`|iqZdPEIYaa	slummdog millionaire|`|j7BX0kNhaa	slumdog millenier|`|Oxon3rgHaa	india is the winner|`|SWiHBwtvaa	ar rahaman.|`|UJBoFwpRaa	a r rehaman, and kids, in the movie of slum dog milinior|`|Gd8AB95iaa	A.R.Rahman,<br>  Best Cinematography - Anthony Dod Mantle for 'Slumdog Millionaire'<br>  Best Sound Mixing - Ian Tapp, Richard Pryke and Resul Pookutty|`|QLy7kx9waa	smiling pinkie|`|MCmIFl9saa	its slumdog millionaire who has won the oscars in 2009..|`|bsBgQT3eaa	A.R.Rhaman|`|Zik6UKCvaa	rehman,gulzaar,patudi.for slumdog millioneer,& to smile pinky documentry pic<br>  8 to slumdog<br>  1 to pinky|`|SVpiRKtnaa	a.r.rahman|`|FITSoc0Paa	a.r rehman (2 oscars)|`|37HlJRyaaa	Indians|`|DkvLTloSaa	A R Rhaman and Gulzar|`|jdi1XSl2aa	A .R  RAHMAN|`|wRUOlFvpaa	SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE|`|2ALxNIHOaa	A .

DeDDKZ61aa	You might not believe me, but the name of the song is "Attack of the 60 ft Lesbian Octopus" by Does it Offend You, Yeah.  They're a British band who released that album at the end of 2007.  <br>  <br>  I was both excited and confused that the Academy would choose this song, and I'm sure it would have caused some controversy if they mentioned the name. <br>  <br>  If you don't believe me, look it up.

agRLoU9naa	It is one of a kind movie.<br>  <br>  If you have seen Danny Boyle movies, you gona agree with me, he makes movies that are just out of the blue!<br>  <br>  The story is different and there are unexpected twists!|`|75nbESJUaa	I haven't seen it, but I have mixed feelings about if the movie really did achieve artistic standards to gain that many awards. Politically, a few years back, the Academy handed out Oscars to a Chinese production:  "Crouching Dragon, Hidden Tiger", something like that. That movie failed to hold my interest after the first trapeze demonstration.<br>  <br>  No, the execs at Hollywood dream about CGI, mass crowds of extras, cheap costumes, and technological breakthroughs all without union costs. I look for America's last major export to leave the shores of America -- Hollywood films and Slubdog will be remembered as the milestone when things started moving to Asia.|`|zovrJ0yXaa	it is an excellent film but it doesnt deserve THAT many oscars cos its not the best film of the year. either wall-e or dark knight are|`|yV1jZkqGaa	I seriously love that film. <br>  <br>  I expected to come out of it feeling happy though! It was a bit depressing as Danny Boyle did a great job at showing India as it is supposedly supposed to be. It was realistic, but not without that element of fantasy that makes a film interesting :)<br>  <br>  <3 Plus, Dev Patel's really cute ;)

The food is spectacular, but the setting truly lacks romance, as do most chain restaurants in that price range.  Still, it's the thought and the company that are important besides the food, so have a nice time wherever you dine.  Oh, and happy birthday.|`|c9b6778bcf8abb59cfb68e059b6f01c9aa	My first choice would be The cheesecake factory.<br>  My second choice would be Ruby Tuesday<br>  and my last choice would be a mexican restaurant where they make the guacamole in front of you.<br>  <br>  Happy Birthday!|`|XZecjMyXaa	If you can't find any good restaurants, do a picnic at the park or beach etc...

T3X7Aci4aa	He does have a lot of potential, but the content of his songs is so inconsistent. Some of his songs are meaningful and the others are just cliche garbage. I like his flow, but I can see where it would be annoying to some people.|`|wfZhkZO0aa	Joe Budden has jockers just as bad as Lil Wayne.  I'm not a fan of most of his stuff.<br>  <br>  Mood Muzik was some good stuff.  The first one was really the best one tho.|`|gUYcVXMTaa	I was never a big Joe Budden fan as well.  All I really remember was that song pump it up!  But I dont think I really gave him a fair chance.  So if you get some songs posted on here I will listen and give him a chance!|`|F1SjcigGaa	Buddens from jerzey!|`|0TAld46gaa	I don't like him either<br>  I gave him a chanc but still a no|`|1sapXjMvaa	I've never even heard his stuff.<br>  Sounds like a Jim Jones alias.|`|8M36dNvxaa	Well, I'm not referring to you, but many people who say "Joe Budden sucks" have only heard songs like "Pump it Up" and "Fire".....and they just write him off as a 'one hit wonder'....which isn't really their fault, because they just don't know about his other music....but honestly, if you haven't already, go download Mood Muzik 1-3, Halfway House, and Padded Room....I don't think you'll be disappointed....if you want to just go for songs, here's a list of "must hear" tracks:<br>  <br>  sidetracked<br>  whatever it takes<br>  so long goodbye<br>  3 sides to a story<br>  hiatus<br>  all of me<br>  10 minutes<br>  walk with me<br>  just to be different<br>  better me<br>  stained<br>  the future (not the song with Game, it's on Mood Muzik 2)<br>  Family Reunion<br>  Dear Diary<br>  Broken Wings freestyle<br>  dumb out<br>  <br>  I could keep going and going....Budden has an endless supply of classic songs.....if you go through those songs and you're not impressed, I guess hes just not for you...|`|m2UUrurBaa	@ least you gave him a chance, that's all any artist ask b4 you write em off, most people will say they don't like an artist off of 1 or no song just hear say. but ummmmmm if i could give you just one to listen to, it would be 10 minutes off of his 1st album, and maybe "slow down" so that's 2. his new joint thats dropping tommorow isn't that bad either, i just might cop it.|`|9wUrbqT3aa	I like Joe Budden but not to the extent where  I cant see why people don't like him.  His first album was alright, but the mixtape scene is what got me as a fan.  Joey * Fab use to kill the mixtape scene wit DJ Clue.<br>  <br>  who<br>  <a href="http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/audio/id.5291/title.joe-budden-who-full-version" rel="nofollow">http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/audio/id.5...</a><br>  <br>  In my sleep<br>  <a href="http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/audio/id.6774/title.joe-budden-in-my-sleep" rel="nofollow">http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/audio/id.6...</a>|`|l72FO4eMaa	How can you rate somebody after 1 track? Listen to a whole album. Even his first album "Joe Budden" was pretty good.|`|HL8W9yU6aa	I think I got 4 thumbs down once because I said I didnt like him...|`|NUS7MIVRaa	I don't either....who cares what people think?  Opinions are opinions are opinions, you know??|`|u8hsZ7claa	I don't care for him either|`|wAAhMn6Xaa	I don't like him either...|`|mKNzCIwuaa	hey listen to these songs you can find them on youtube. <br>  type in Joe Budden-Broken Wings, All of Me, Dear Diary, through the wire, sing for the moment freestyle,Unforgiven, Stained, Dumb Out. <br>  <br>  also take a look at his latest album Padded Room, some standout tracks are "in My Sleep, Blood on the wall, Exxxes, and Future<br>  <br>  I hope this helps...his music is introspective, it takes an intimate look into his life that some people cant relate to because they prefer dance music or the catchy lil wayne songs. But any true hip hop head knows that joe budden is very skilled and takes his music seriously. Dont believe me just see for yourself. Great question! <br>  <br>  His new album Padded Room comes out tommorrow in stores Feb. 24!|`|t74KHpcsaa	Joe Budden has pigeon-holed himself as a rapper forever on the verge. I don't dislike him, but I don't love him either. <br>  Mood Muzik (the three of em) are good. <br>  But I don't check for that cat.|`|1Cznz2mkaa	because hip hop fans (most hip hop fans) are the stupidest fans there are.  the minute you don't like something you're hating.  opinion is obviously a word that doesn't exist in hip hop<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  hate me now|`|RcNAzealaa	I don't like him as well.
NGNeT3rYaa	I don't think they could ever find a suitable kid to play him so they just don't show him. They aged the kid like 2 times in a month and then they haven't shown him in over 6 months. Knowing how most rich kids on soaps are, he was sent to boarding school just like Jason and AJ were until they were in high school!|`|EhBF31evaa	He is mentioned occasionally but we never see him anymore.  He is either with a nanny or with Leslie which I really think is crappy.  Nicholas went through so much in the short time that he and Courtney were together and then finding out that Jax and Carly had lied about Spencer and finally getting is son.  He really should be more of a priority to Nicholas.|`|RIRRITy8aa	Spencer has gone off to where all soap children go.....The Magic School Bus of Aging. He will be back soon and sleeping with Elizabeth & Rebecca.|`|VAp5ICaBaa	They rarely show anyone's kids but you're right we see Spencer fewer than the rest of them maybe he's off to college it is a soap|`|tgVGE2Umaa	Well since soaps seem to age kids faster than the speed of light...he is probably 15 and in boarding school by now. Haha. But really they are making Nikolas look like a horrible father.|`|sGLRpQWvaa	I think he spends a lot of time with his grandmother (Laura's mother)|`|UY3zl9dFaa	He's probably off with his cousins Christina and Molly- they should all be back as teenagers in a month or two. LOL Where is that place where kids go that makes them age so fast?
9KWVgb9naa	the hawaii shows rock ! ann b. davis  as her cousin emma ,but my fave has  peters classic line ";porkchops & applesauce "|`|L94XXSO5aa	I like the one where Bobby falls in love with Cindy's friend Millicent.  He kisses her and then the whole family flips out because Bobby may have gotten the mumps from her.  I also love that when Bobby daydreams about Millicent he imagines them slow-motion running toward each other and then do the twirling embrace.  Hilarious.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	The one where Marsha gets hit in the face with the ball<br>  Joe Namath throwing footballs to Bobby<br>  Greg and Marsha knocking an egg off a traffic pylon during a driving competition. Marsha won I think...

0ffdb9dc23ea4daa66d018dcdabc0a14aa	I think most people give a crap about their own lives and not these actors who gets millions of dollars a picture.|`|y1Yl6p9Qaa	I enjoyed watching the Oscars this year, some people like it some don't. i am not going to knock you for your opinion. Heath Ledger definitely deserved the oscar and it was no surprise Slumdog won as many awards as it did. So the answer to your questions is yes, I do give a crap.|`|BHpELpEqaa	not really. i just watch it if i am really bored and i wasn't. the only thing i know is heath ledger won an award. :]|`|6YPNM71Iaa	yes!!  i was crying when Heath won<br>  <br>  i want to be part of the movie business some day<br>  <br>  i love movies so much|`|LDChWlW2aa	unless your the one getting the award, not really.

Do we have a troll here?|`|W0ZsuxRTaa	definitely agree with you. it's just another reason for hollywood to create drama and get all dressed up. some of the speeches are fun to listen to but half the time, stupid movies win and the speeches are way too long and boring. i feel like it's a disappointment every time since it's supposed to be a big deal, but it sucks.|`|EO35Luyuaa	The Oscars?<br>  Nahh, don't bother. <br>  Does anybody care other than the people nominated?<br>  <br>  I prefer the Brits, or the Grammys?<br>  Or even the Comedy awards? (dunno what there called)<br>  They are better (i)|`|hGVkInSnaa	No, not really. In fact, if a movie wins an Oscar, I'm less likely to want to see it. With the exception of Slumdog Millionaire, which looks amazing.|`|xoxXq3w5aa	I cared about Heath Ledger winning, but other than that I didn't give a crap who won everything else.|`|QKVheuAXaa	no they are completely pointless they are awarding people who do not deserve to be awarded. there are millions of people out there who are risking their lifes everyday but do they get there own tv show no....|`|zovrJ0yXaa	only occasionally when i feel someone really deserves it. otherwise, its always wrong|`|eZOPPFcaaa	i really couldn't care less about the Oscars|`|6abd3bdb56caa5b55d37adf04ec88a38aa	Not really, I find those shows can be a bit of a bore.|`|00390bee0bdfb56e0334bd2845fadd9aaa	those who won, obviously do<br>  but frankly I could care less|`|tgxDZ7Bjaa	I could care less.

I'm happy for Slumdog Millionaire for getting that bonus money for Oscars.  But the awards themselves are a joke/popularity contest.  And I hate watching the celebs try to lose gracefully - it's the last thing I care about.  In fact I only watched the opening number and read who won on IMDB afterward.|`|YkseyT7zaa	Does it change my life - no<br>  Did it entertain me - yes<br>  <br>  These aren't life changing events, it's entertainment|`|yqe0I5zpaa	Yes, Sean Penn's performance in Milk is going to go down in history as one of the best. Slumdog Millionaire is going to go down as a classic, it won 70 Awards this year including 8 Academy Awards and 4 Golden Globes, the film was an incredible piece of work. Kate Winslet finally won her Oscar. An actor who will go down as a truly lost piece of amazing talent, Heath Ledger won the Oscar for his iconic turn as The Joker, with his proud family their to accept. The Oscars were great this year.|`|tuvcxnJXaa	It's the second most watched TV show on an annual basis, next to the Super Bowl.   Obviously, a few people care.<br>  <br>  I'm laughing at all the people who made the effort to come to the Movies section on the day after the awards show to comment on how much they "don't care".   What a tool shed this place is today.|`|YW74O9aNaa	well the show is entertaining :) i watched it.. i don't care much who won who lost..were the mvies really good etc etc.. but love to watch the show.

I will never eat again at a Steak & Shake, they left us sitting there for so long we finally walked out after we had asked for our check from three different people (including a manager!) and sat there for more than a hour!! Also there is a Denny's where we had the same thing happen to us, my friends and I and there was hardly anybody else in the restaurant so it is not like they were busy. Ruby Tuesday too. TGI Friday's is notoriously disgusting and even dangerous to eat at down here in Florida, the one in Boynton is like a ptomain palace. And I cannot say I like Applebee's either since for some reason the people who work there are very ghetto and seem to have a grudge against even friendly customers.|`|AA11729534	I like Red-Robin.  There menu is expansive enough that there should be something to find..but it does get boring going to the same restaurant all the time.  If I don't care for a place I don't go back - so can't say I hate eating anywhere.

They are basically the same in every role. I kept expecting Ross to walk in and try to get Rachel, oops, Jennifer back. And the dog was annoying with his lack of training.

gHRbi3c5aa	Your instincts are right. Don't take it. Stop thinking of yourself as a construction worker. Look at your skills and your abilities. Are you a good communicator? A people person? are you approachable? do you pay attention to detail? Are you calm under pressure? <br>  <br>  Experienced and qualified staff will always be more expensive than people who have the broad skills but need some in-house training. <br>  <br>  Most of all don't let the credit crunch make you panic. I don't know what aspect of construction you're in, or where you are, but have you thought of self employment. You could set up with government support - loans or grants and provide services for people unable to do the work themselves. There's loads of info on funding and managing your own business.<br>  <br>  You could offer your services to companies as well as householders - people will be attracted to lower costs but be sure that you can do what you say you can, otherwise there's no chance of earning a living . Good luck|`|Mu7rnIoMaa	Double glazing is hard enough in good times!  <br>  <br>  If you are not an experienced Direct Salesman you are going to get nowhere!  <br>  <br>  Sorry, I know it's not what you want to hear!|`|pPr4gWXyaa	Well I cannot see how you would possibly be able to survive at this kind of employment level, the benefits office would see that too. The problem here is this is not a job instead it is work wrapped up as a career, in a job one is equally re numerated accordingly for their services and this so called opportunity fails to provide that.

Johny thinks for a minute and says, None.And how did you come up with that number? asks the teacher. Well, Johny says, if you shoot one of them you'll scare the other two away. The teacher is surprised by little Johny's thinking and says, That's not bad, Johny, I like the way you think. Johny then asks the teacher, Can I ask you a question, teacher?"OK,she says. There's 3 ladies all sitting on a park bench eating ice cream. One's licking the ice cream, one's biting the ice cream and one's sucking the ice cream. Which one is married?

wNbK0i9Naa	Holy ****  by far one among superior in death metal circle .where should i start okay <br>  one of the very few who have consistently produced good quality metal over their career right from Procreation Of The Inner Temple (sorry haven't heard the demo may be tron you can leave a comment on their demo ) t`ll latest The Spell of Retribution band which got better which every subsequent record just like what we have with Deathspell omega (although death spell had pretty disappointing debut by are force to reckon in black metal circle now .although that isn't case of the chasm 1st album was pretty above average decent but later ones especially  "Deathcult For Eternity" sheer intensity of it blows your brains out of skull  none the less they followed it up with Procession To The Infraworld and  Spell of Retribution which are masterpieces <br>  guitars always had that dark edge somehow this isnt a perfect brand of death metal fed. band has coined in lots of influences has that atmosphere which black metal bands provides in their music  and then combine with ear ripping thrashy riffs (especially in later albums), some dazzling solos with impeccable growls with a touch of black metal screech its almost like wild flow of emotions thats what Daniel depicts through his voice some kinda hysteria .<br>  best way to describe music would be mixture of lots of elements you can find bits and pieces of black ,doom added to Death metal devastation which is gonna crack you`r`e mirror  <br>  <br>  some amazing song writing with complex musicianship free from any kinda voids. <br>  earlier albums are bit more melodic then later ones but still great work.<br>  Daniel Corchado and crew has always guarantee  100% satisfaction for the listener  .Band must in every death metal fan collection <br>  <br>  Take my word you`re gonna be exposed to one unique Death Metal .honestly got no idea how many really do know about this band hardly have seen anyone mentioning this band|`|h1yGVkkfaa	Hey tron<br>  Lol I was actually looking at this band at HMV i was thinking about buying it(but not knowing how good/bad they were lol)<br>  <br>  But now i actually got to hear it these guys are pretty solid.<br>  <br>  I think i might have to go back and get it.<br>  Thanks for confirming and sharing = )<br>  <br>  I love foreign METAL(usually)|`|ObeBvtzgaa	They seem pretty good.

AnhoHRFTaa	Pluto is officially no longer a planet. If you interested in astronomy I am surprised you do not know this and still call Pluto a planet.<br>  <br>  Since it's discovery hundreds of other similar objects have been discovered in the same eliptic. Many much larger then Pluto. Which proves that astrology is nonsense. Just because an astromer saw Pluto before seeing all the other objects that are so similar in the same area of our solar system, astrologers use pluto as one of the nine planets. But it is no longer a planet. How does that effect astrological charts then?<br>  <br>  Please do a search on something like, Pluto not a planet. Here is one link for you. National Geographic. There are literally thousands of websites that will confirm the official re-classification of Pluto. <br>   It is not a planet<br>  <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/08/060824-pluto-planet.html" rel="nofollow">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/...</a>|`|HZxX9ke8aa	1. jupiter, saturn, uranus, neptun and pluto's effects rather on generations than individuals (sign position, not aspects or houses)<br>  <br>  2. pluto is there, whether it's considered a planet or not. it is symbolizing something. the god of underworld and that's what is important.<br>  <br>  3. hey, astronomers said it's a planet. now they are saying it's not. should we say astronomy is bull because of that? <br>  <br>  4. astrology is NOT science. we merely trying to explain in what spesific ways heavenly bodies (sun or moon are not planets too) affecting us looking 1000 natal charts and trying to generalize things. it started centuries ago, you figure how many natal charts created. how sun signs pretty much tells your most important characteristics. <br>  <br>  5. astrology deals with human psyche. that's a frakking hard thing to do, you know? explaining some random person's character just by looking at a picture of skies when he/she born... should we say quantum mechanics or big bang theory or evolution bull? those are theories and they will probably stay as theories forever. what astrology trying to explain even harder, much more profound. science since centuries crashing electrons and whatevers into each other to UNDERSTAND their nature, what atom made of, what's anti-matter etc. and they are still sticking with higgs particles, which is never observed and a very crucial part of standard model. should we say quantum mechanics bull?|`|c99d38fb90a9cc5176dbffea6d850563aa	They could not have...Pluto was discovered in the 1930's...it cannot be seen by the naked eye.  Pluto is not considered a Planet now... nor would it be the farthest in our system if it were....Sedna is almost as big as Pluto and farther...there are others as well.<br>  No, Ancient Astrologers, did NOT know about Pluto..I don't know where others are getting their facts...|`|ampkZtrXaa	Serious science regards astrology as a waste of time. Apart from the fact that it is all made up, astrologers go into a panic when the more seriously minded astronomers make another discovery, thus making the astrologers charts obsolete!

If a girl has the sun sign of Taurus that is close in degree to his natal Venus, wham!   Mars in leo mean that he needs attention when striving or fighting.  He like to be number 1 on his path or job.

ee7afa2284dbb71d60c6d9445eb13af8aa	Maybe so. The notion of Sean Penn being rewarded for being an anti-American sleaze is sickening. Next time he goes to Cuba or Venezuela to kiss *ss I hope that they keep him.|`|yqe0I5zpaa	I saw both The Wrestler and Milk and Sean Penn was brilliant, he transformed into Harvey Milk, it was an incredible performance, truly heartfelt and amazing. Mickey Rourke broke my heart in The Wrestler, but c'mon he played himself, which was more of a stretch?! Who really was the best actor, Sean Penn, the award went to him and he deserved it. I am not gay and i don't believe in being gay, but everyone is human, we should all have equal rights, it is their life, not ours. Great speech by both Lance Black and Penn, they were both well deserved. Also, Brokeback Mountain didn't win Best Picture, Best Actor or Best Supporting Actress, all three lost and that was a film about homosexuals.....|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	yes & if his last name was Penn.|`|d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	I think more people saw Milk than Frost/Nixon, the Visitor, the Reader or Vicky Cristina Barcelona.  While I thought Mickey shoulda won, it wasn't a huge upset.  And I agree for Penn to play Milk was a bigger stretch than Mickey playing an over-the-hill former star whos earlier abuses have taken their toll.  <br>  <br>  And let's not forget that favorites don't always win- Shakespeare in Love won, over Life is Beautiful and Saving Private Ryan. Forrest Gump beat the Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction.<br>  <br>  I AM disgusted by Benjamin Button getting best visual effects over Iron Man and The Dark Knight... now THAT was robbery!!!|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Yes, I saw it.

86990ea910ba06fc1046c0e615f983d3aa	You met your girlfriend on Y!A? Seriously? That's awesome!<br>  <br>  For me, I was going through a divorce. We'd been separated for a long time and I decided it was time to move on with my life. So I started divorce proceedings and my best friend took me out to celebrate (it was an abusive marriage, hence the celebration of it ending). Anyway, this group of guys were at the club in Dayton celebrating two of their birthdays. He says he noticed my long blonde hair from across the room and wanted a better look. We ended up talking and dancing most of the night. He asked for my # and I refused to give it to him. Some guy I just met? No..lol. I got his instead. The next night, we talked on the phone for over 8 hours! I found out he lived just 20 minutes from me and I knew most of his friends but had never met him. We started dating and eventually, I introduced him to my 2 little boys. They loved him as much as I did and two years later, we got married. We will be celebrating our 9th anniversary in May. We have a six year old together and he's been a great dad to my boys and a wonderful husband. Sure, we have our spats, but I love him more than anything. <br>  <br>  Funny thing is...he never went out clubbing and I rarely did. It was just chance that we were both out at the same club, 50 miles from our homes that night.|`|AA10138269	I first saw him at a skating rink in 1988 and he was a very good dancer then we met for first time at my first job in 1990 and I found out that he was one of my friend with benefits best friend (said a mouth-full huh lol)<br>  so I dumped my friend with benefits and I called him up and we have been married for 13 yrs. Definitely, The Love of my Life!|`|vYTRMm69aa	Well, lets see, I came upon this forum and thought I would dabble in it and was in the family/relationship category, During the U.S.A. presidential elections I switched over and stayed in the political category, I then noticed more people and their avatars. One in particular drew me in and I liked the way he answered questions and his personality showed through, This was the first time I took interest in a contact on Y/A. It seems he was attracted to me the same way, and the subtle flirting began. and the rest is history, we found other ways to communicate and connect. The great part was that we both live in Canada and not that far away from one another. We got to know one another from the inside out and this has been one of the ultimate love connections I could ever have imagined, we are so compatible and the chemistry between us is uncontrollable, we cannot even fathom not being together forever, I love my Gentle Fox, I am the Angel he often speaks of in some of his answers, whew, this was the most unexpected love of my life, love from Joey , xxxooo|`|qY9svA3taa	Online.

This guy lived on my block, I knew he liked me, anyway I was learning how to ride, and I fell off my bike into some bushes, I was so embarrassed. But the good thing about it, he didn't laugh he helped me up and told me to try it again. You know I didn't fall don't you, how could I with him standing there. lol|`|kBbUxJ8Aaa	the first time i ever tried to forge a field trip form i was in like 1st grade. i would have got away with it if i didnt sign it MOM|`|SN2LzME2aa	I was 7 and singing a solo in the church choir.

1f4c803984defdfd24e382289f4e3180aa	She's not mean.. She just says the things we wish people would say. This is her shtick and what makes her unique from the rest of the talk shows. Everyone else kisses butt and tiptoes around the Hollywood elite and she actually says what's on her mind which is funny most of the time.<br>  <br>  The guests have a choice to appear or not on her show and if they do, they better be ready for anything.<br>  <br>  In example when Audrey O'Day was on the show a few weeks ago, she ended the interview with "You're not as dumb as I thought you were". I don't know any other talk show host that would have the balls to say that to their guests face other than her and that's why I like to watch her show.|`|V7mW3KWIaa	i think that if you really listen to any comedian, they are really mean. but its their appeal. if you ever notice, the only way that anyhting can be funny to us is if its making fun of someone or yourself. (excluding some things). but that is just kind of our society.<br>  <br>  i think shes just more open about her opinions and i love her to death!|`|a002ffcbd40afa45e8f5b3068f771ffcaa	i wanted to like her...she can be funny at times but for the most part, she's just inappropriate and rude. i don't loathe her as much as sarah silverman, though.|`|pcSe793Naa	no, shes mad funny!|`|Le53Bggxaa	No, she's just outspoken and says what many of us actually think  about, yet wouldn't really dare to say. I find her hilarious and very comforting, almost every single thing she says I have to agree with.<br>  <br>  I will admit though, sometimes there are some stuff which comes off as rude, but that's her personality and shes a comedian so there's no limits for them.<br>  But overall I think she is a cool person...she doesn't take crap from no one...|`|nDSLNnguaa	The truth is often spoken in jest.<br>  <br>  I think that's her appeal.  Personally she cracks me up most of the time but yeah, she can sometimes be a little mean at times.  Poor Chuy- he gets most of it doesn't he?  I hope he gets paid well.|`|QBzcHxSgaa	yeah, she's funny but she crosses the line with somepeople. especially when she does it infront of them.

aihogb26aa	There will be 3 rounds, each with 12 singers. Each round, 3 people go through ( the male top vote-getter, female top vote-getter, and next highest vote-getter, regardless of gender). That will be 9 total. Then, there will be a wild card round where the judges will bring back singers who they feel deserve a second chance.  They will sing again, and 3 singers from the wild card round will be chosen to move on and round out the top 12.

I've heard many groups and bands but no artist has ever really mixed up their sound like Gorillaz. (Albarn provides the vocals, which are fabulous!)<br>  <br>  And, not only is the music very ingenious and experimental, but the lyrics are often cryptic and puzzling. Personally, I like songs that I have to listen to several times to figure out what's being discussed; it's like the difference between chomping down on a piece of chocolate and holding it in your mouth to savor the flavor.<br>  <br>  Lastly, Hewlett does a great job designing the band members to act more like "real" people than stock-like cartoons. His drawing style is loose but clever; and there's a ton of bathroom-esque humor! (Some of it can run a bit dark for my liking but I haven't found it to exceed too far outside the bounds of good taste.)<br>  <br>  If you want to give Gorillaz a listen yourself, be sure to check out "Demon Days," which is the second album but the best in my book. You won't be sorry! :)|`|LFC1AcmGaa	Cream, because they were the best (best as in musically, not by their popularity). They used to improvise every song they did live and had to meet back for the ending of those songs or they totally f*ck up, and they're each the best of their kind.

pR0pJNJkaa	Well, they were both black leaders during the 60's. The both worked from a religious base. King was christian and Muhammad was Muslim (his own brand). They were both originally from the south. They both had children and wives. They both were monitored by the FBI and considered threats.<br>  <br>  The difference would be that Muhammad pushed a black separatist agenda, where as King pushed for Integration. King practiced non-violence. Muhammad preached violence for protection and dignity's sake.|`|Sx5HDgtpaa	idk who elijah mummad is, so sorry

They can't show the same people over and over or the tribute would go on for days, they did show a  couple of repeats of last year and older, which I didn't think was right, if you are going to say "over the past year" it should just be that period of time, they put in Oscar winning actors again like Paul Newman and Charlton Heston.<br>  <br>  Also I would like to point out that Brad Renfro, from the Client, Apt.Pupil, The Cure, Ghost World, Bully etc. Has never been in the tribute, he died last year right before Ledger did and the Oscars never said a damn word about it, disgusting.|`|p0guNQhiaa	Likely because he received his own tribute earlier in the show when he won his oscar for best supporting actor.

Artie sighed, rolled his eyes, & reluctantly agreed to accept the dollar as down payment for the dirty deed.<br>  <br>  A few days later, Artie followed the man's wife to the local Super Wal-Mart store. There, he surprised her in the produce department & proceeded to strangle her with his gloved hands & as the poor unsuspecting woman drew her last breath & slumped to the floor........<br>  <br>  The manager of the produce department stumbled unexpectedly onto the murder scene. Unwilling to leave any living witnesses behind, ol' Artie had no choice but to strangle the produce manager as well.<br>  <br>  However, unknown to Artie, the entire proceedings were captured by the hidden security cameras & observed by the store's security guard, who immediately called the police. Artie was caught & arrested before he could even leave the store.<br>  <br>  Under intense questioning at the police station, Artie revealed the whole sordid plan, including his unusual financial arrangements with the hapless husband who was also quickly arrested.   <br>  <br>  The next day in the newspaper, the headline declared ...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  (You're going to hate me for this ... )<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  'ARTIE CHOKES 2 for $1.00 AT WAL-MART!'|`|St4i1Wlhaa	im using this joke w/ jeff gordon<br>  <br>  <br>  there were 3 kids walking along a bridge and they saw jeff gordon drowning after they saved him jeff said ill buy u andything u want the fist 2 got a psp and a wii the 3rd one said i want a wheelchair jeff said y do u want a wheelchair the 3rd one said ill need 1 when my dad found out who i saved|`|AgzRyqWTaa	why did the chicken cross the street.<br>  to get to the border,his friend hen told him about the recession period and he was trying to avoid it.|`|0Iin6kO4aa	What do you call a scouser with a suit .<br>  The accused.|`|JmHBplRIaa	A zoophile, a murderer, a necrophile, an arsonist and a masochist are all sitting on a park bench on a sunny but rather quiet day.

kfOpbbCyaa	Now, that is a common misconception.<br>  <br>  Originally the sheep attempted to count wolves, but there were two problems with this idea: 1-they couldn't figure out how to count and 2-the wolves made their hearts pound so much, they became more and more alert and terrified (the poor dears were too mentally challenged to realize the wolves were in their own imaginations and not right there with them and ready to pounce).<br>  <br>  The Border Collies (and other dogs) guarding them got really frustrated (how could they sleep with so many terrified sheep around?). The network of dogs got in touch and decided the best way to calm the sheep and make them sleep was for each to command his flock, "Go to sleep...NOW!" Sheep being docile and easily lead, it worked.<br>  <br>  In very rare instances when the command doesn't work, the dogs came up with the extreme plan, which they told to the flock (they'll probably have to tell them again, each time this extremity is faced). Since sheep have a tendency to follow one another and there is always one who eats so much he falls asleep mid-chew, the plan was to find that first "sleeper" and circle him and simply stare. As followers, this has been found to be an effective way to send the flock to sleep.<br>  <br>  Okay, I'm being silly, but that was fun. :)|`|lFqUMMAGaa	They spend their time plotting revenge on the sheep dog who heards them ;-)|`|ymK1hg2Raa	heck yes they do!!!<br>  <br>  well, maybe they count goats................no it's defiantly people!|`|M0bE2IBQaa	The real question is, if humans get goose bumps do geese get human bumps?<br>  <br>  ck1 summed it up pretty well :D|`|tR36oILvaa	no, my friend they count sheep dogs|`|DUg1IkTIaa	Yes, they probably do.|`|ne2sEeLJaa	Yes.|`|JLP5IhFDaa	Haha I'd like to think so|`|hwDtWCAjaa	yes they do i just got my check yesterday i was # 41|`|DXjMfIuLaa	I am sure these so-called sleepless sheep are counting their lucky stars that I haven't -- as yet-- found a way to maneuver them onto my charcoal grill.

How sad!|`|GqImSTt4aa	No, they count pigs or chickens.|`|j6RbKNmjaa	Yes...|`|wmBK9uASaa	They count kebab shops,|`|4GCH1lTyaa	well duh...but they have an advantage...if a real obese person comes thru they can count them as 2|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	I would think they fall asleep from shear boredom......get it?

9FCxm8qJaa	Mainly because he's a jerk.  But, he is blaming her for not telling him that Billy is Chloe's baby's father.  he feels betrayed by everyone and is really feeling the loss over not being the baby's dad.|`|AA11172374	He thinks she should have told him that Billy was the baby's father,<br>  and she told him it wasn't her place to say anything.  which is true.<br>  He's feeling hurt and used by a lot of people, and he's lashing out<br>  at Lily.|`|ce35927379e187a9a9405823379c0faaaa	Because she knew about the baby and wasn't the one to tell him. He feels he need to blow up at everyone. He's seeing her imperfection as much as she saw his.|`|cr5TQgmUaa	He's feeling betrayed and took his feelings out on her. He'll get over being mad at her later this week.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	I know Cane is angry. But he has little reason to be treat Lily like he did at CL. <br>  <br>  Just when was Lily supposed to tell him that she found out the truth? While her and Billy were trying to help Chloe give birth? While Chloe was almost bleeding to death? While they were dragging her through the snow to get her to the ambulance? While they were checking the baby to make sure she was okay? While Chloe was fighting for her life in the hospital? <br>  <br>  There was so much going on; there really was not a good time for Lily to say, oh by the way...that's not your kid. I think it was Chloe's responsibility to tell him and she did that. It is no one's fault but his own that he was too stupid to suspect that he was being punked, even though there were plenty of signs (like how large and heathly your premmie baby is, not remembering the one night stand and the DNA results not being conclusive).<br>  <br>  And then to gril her about if she would have told him if Billy and Chloe had not confessed??? WTF??? OF course she would have told him; this pregnancy is the reason they are not together! <br>  <br>  If I were Lily, I would thrown my coffee is his face, and told him to kiss my *** and go to h*ll

6Au5FIYWaa	Well, a lot of things would probably hurt her. To be honest, she is probably sarcastic and rude BECAUSE you hurt her in some way. Maybe you make her jealous, and she thinks (wrongly or rightfully) you do it on purpose? Maybe you do things that are rude to her and you don't realise it. Both pisces and scorpio are highly sensitive, and are often horribly yet subtly cruel and rude out of defense more than anything else, like in reaction to something that someone did to them. And they can be randomly rude in order to make themselves feel better.<br>  <br>  So, chances are, keep doing whatever you're doing and you're probably hurting her. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, you could of course just talk to her and ask her why she does that - pisces are often very sympathetic and understanding if you speak to them honestly and tell them how hurtful they are being. I'm a pisces, and I've been sarcastic and rude and I often haven't realised that I've hurt people's feelings. It's freaked the hell out of me when I've found out they were so hurt - so maybe you should just talk to her and ask her why she does that. If she's a pisces with more firey influences like me, she may just be trying to joke around and is oblivious to the fact that it's a sensitive issue.<br>  <br>  Anyway, trying to hurt her back will only exacerbate the problem, because trust me, with a sensitive and revengeful pisces/scorpio combo she will NOT let anything go as long as no sincere apologies are made. So in turn, the ruder you are to her, the ruder she will be to you. So just stop the vicious cycle, try talking to her, and if she doesn't respond, just ignore it and be the bigger person.<br>  <br>  Edit: I don't know, to really know what might be bothering her or what's up with your relationship, many factors need to be taken into account (the whole chart, synastry, transits, current particular situations, etc. etc.) <br>  For a wild leap though, with you being a gemini, she may be annoyed if you flirt a lot with a guy she likes, flirt a lot with guys in general (she may not be so forward and it may make her envious), hang out with lots of different people (she may feel like you get all the fun while she's left out, or that you are being disloyal to her as a friend), or if you take things she says lightly, treat her emotions without tact, or act distant and cold towards her when she expects you to show warmth.<br>  <br>  Either way, you seem like a conscientious person, so I would definitely try talking this thing out.|`|811921e95b3795dad10075b3f9e12029aa	No, its your whatever you've got in Virgo that is sparking her off.  Plus Pisces can see what a horrible, hurtful place the world is, and no, it's not fair.  Take her sarcasm as a comment on the world in general.  If she is jealous at all, it is of your ability to have fun and the places you can get to that she can't.<br>  <br>  As a Gemini you are only showing her one side of you- you expect her to be polite when (maybe) you have hidden accounts, ulterior motives, things you choose not to discuss with her.  Scorpio moon will be able to dissect your emotional attachments with surgical skill - which is why she can hurt you so well.  However I take issue with the earlier answer- Scorpio is not nearly so vengeful as virgo (say)  and Pisces never looks for an apology.<br>  <br>  Hide your heart and skip away at the first sign of rudeness.  Do not try to get back at her - her wilful strike would cut you even more deeply.  If you want to take her out of her comfort zone, take her somewhere you thrive.

I love that song it is sooooo cute =D|`|LWsyxuMfaa	George Strait|`|3BLnUnnQaa	hi there,<br>  <br>  if you don't want to go with the George Strait song, maybe you can take a look at :<br>  "Check Yes or No" by Bre Morgan<br>  <a href="http://artists.letssingit.com/bre-morgan-lyrics-check-yes-or-no-82fr8gn" rel="nofollow">http://artists.letssingit.com/bre-morgan...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Mike Dennis.|`|94b168e3b778f875c1c60bf262ec0752aa	You misspelled "Cutie Pie" unless it's a self-harm reference.<br>  <br>  And yes, everyone saying George Strait is correct.
NGNeT3rYaa	May be because someone who has connections to Krystal, David, Tad, JR and Adam is coming back and they said we will be shocked.|`|AA12319351	No Babe is dead and buried. Hayward has an informant at the hospital who tells him what is going on with JR and Amanda like the sneaky little villain he is. He is out to prove that he is the father of Amanda's baby and not JR. He is so desperate to have a child he will do anything to get one even using Krystall to get his hands on little A. For once in his life JR should be happy Adam is his father as he will do anything to keep his grandson safe.|`|97158e12e6c17080ec04a0a2b2456b2aaa	god i hope your scenerio is correct. i really miss Babe, however, i would like for the origional babe to come back, Alexa Havins.|`|D3Fyxj0raa	u know i was thinking that same thing today as i watched amc|`|ADBMrG87aa	The mystery person could very well be Babe; that would not be something new for David to accomplish, he's done it before so why not his own daughter.  You're absolutely that David is not grieving like a person who's lost his child so that makes me even more suspicious of him.  I'd really love it if it turns out that Babe is indeed alive.|`|AA11202477	It's not a theory that I considered, but in PV, it's definitely within the realm of possibility. To date, there has been nothing "leaked" about a Babe return, and I believe that the person on the phone is helping to set up Amanda, but what you've written could certainly happen, especially considering that it's Pine Valley and David Hayward we're talking about, especially with his history.|`|AA12390047	I think Babe is dead.  I think the person on the other end of David's phone has something to do with an under-handed scheme of David's to prove he's the father of Amanda's baby.  And I don't think he's "hiding" Greenlee anywhere either.|`|vvgC20BHaa	I agree!  But then to make it more plausible, they'd have to give Babe amnesia so that she would agree to be away from J.R. & Little Adam! Unless ofcourse, Hayward has her stashed away against her will!!!!!!!! Then they could do a whole really cool dramatic sequence of J.R. rescuing the love of his life!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I love David Hayward!  He is such a good villain!!!!!!!!! So easy to hate him! But then, you almost want him to succeed with his diabolical plans sometimes!|`|74K8V3pSaa	I had considered that scenario. I would be quite happy with that, but only if Alexa Havins came back. If they brought it someone else, it would just be a waste of a big story for me.|`|6efb881973246debd62243c5b0b3f7d6aa	Today the person identified herself as someone named Gail.|`|AA11451041	It's so hard to say with AMC lately.  David is just a jackhole and does anything he can to ruin peoples lives.|`|d5K8wORqaa	he has babe and greenlee stashed away!|`|WjuSuKjoaa	I don't think so, because they already did that storyline with Babe very recently.  When she "died" by Zach's father Alex, but she really didn't die because Josh had taken her away.  I know Alexa Havins is staying in LA since Justin is the new Knight Rider, so I'm not sure who the mystery person could be.  We need more clues...|`|YrOaSXLwaa	I have said it from the beginning that David has Babe and is healing her.  I think that is why he is so hard up to get custody of Lil A too.  I also though that he may have Greenlee but i don't for-see him having both of them so I think it is Babe he has not Greenlee.....|`|iPoWzRSVaa	no she is dead didnt u see the show when JR visit bebes grave|`|MdqFclDbaa	I heard that Brooke English is returning|`|UY3zl9dFaa	On the Soaps anything's possible, but since he was lurking around during the wedding, I think that the calls may have something to do with Greenlee. Maybe he rescued her and has her stashed away somewhere.

Good times.<br>  <br>  If it's your first, I'll warn you now that it gets loud! Really loud! <br>  It doesn't really matter what the people are like - sometimes there's older people, or younger kids or kids around my age (16) that go. Basically, there's a mixture.<br>  <br>  Enjoy the supporting acts - love the real thing! The supporting acts tend to show me how great the band I'm seeing really is.<br>  <br>  There will be an intro in which one of the supporting acts should play. They play a few songs whilst people are still arriving. Then there is an interval for about half an hour or so in which they change the band. That's when you can get drinks etc.<br>  <br>  Maybe another band with another interval before the real band starts. When the real bands starts, expect a LOT of cheering, screaming, shouting... It's awesome.<br>  <br>  It generally gets really hot in there, so I wouldn't bother with a coat unless you are walking quite a bit to get home otherwise you'll be taking it around with you everywhere.<br>  <br>  Dance! Definitely rock out!<br>  <br>  You'll know what to be like when you get in there and it all starts. Just have a ton of fun, it's really worth it! You will honestly have the greatest time!<br>  <br>  Whenever I come home from them, I find that I fall in love with the band even more and then I kind of get obsessed. Live music is so much better!<br>  <br>  When you get out of there, your ears might be ringing a bit - it's normal, mine always do. I go deaf and can't hear anything for a bit LOL.|`|5G4cRjA5aa	I've never been to an outdoor rock concert event before, but:<br>  1) Look up the weather for those days<br>  2) Bring clothes suited for the weather<br>  3) Watch out for moshpits and if someone falls, help them up or they'll get crushed.<br>  4) Take care of yourself.<br>  5) DON'T WORRY! :)<br>  <br>  That's all the advice I can give.

E2VUH8Q0aa	My friend is a retired LTC...he's a Pisces Sun, Capricorn Moon, and he did really well there. Pisces as a Sun sign works well in the military environment if the Mars and the Moon are aspected correctly. <br>  The idea that "military people have issues" is bigoted, hollywood-generated projected. <br>  Just as ASSuming that a Pisces Sun couldn't handle it. They can, and they do well.<br>  <br>  ** I have 18 YEARS of military service, in two different services, 5 as a contractor and 2 in Civil service under my belt. My husband is retired with 23 of service. Is that specific enough for you? <br>  <br>  Just because your EX and his buddies "had issues" does not mean your experience is  global enough to become a law of nature.  <br>  <br>  So perhaps its who YOUR hanging with that's screwed up.  Because, I assure you it's not everyone. <br>  <br>  Questioner, if you want further details on real, up to date military experiences, please feel free to contact me by email. **|`|aymBTRlyaa	Well, pisces are usually very emotional people and get emotionally hurt easily. Military people have MAJOR issues. They end-up crazy and often push people away. So putting those two together I don't think would be a good idea. BUT it all depends on who you are as a person, not always your sign. Good luck and just try not to internalize things too much if you do go.<br>  <br>  <br>  "military people have issues" is bigoted, hollywood-generated projected"...... NO, I was married to a marine and know several people in all branches of the sevice and the majority DO HAVE ISSUES. This is not coming from "Hollywood" it is coming from reality, personal experience, and the experiences of other people I have known. I take it that you do not know very many military people - probably just one or two and probably not very well on a personal/emotional level. I doubt you have delved into their psyche as much as I have espeicially since I was married to one and lived on base and knew very many people that were in the service intimately.<br>  <br>  These other answerers might have "known" or spoken with people who were in the service, but have not lived with them and the quetion that was asked and answered with a "it has to be done" is not a straight answer. Military people are conditioned to respond like that, but their hearts and minds are not in that place. I knew a man very closely who went to Thailand to rake up the dead bodies after the tsunami and he would reply with a stearn, "It had to be done" answer as well, but at night he would scream and cry to me. THESE ANSWERERS DO NOT KNOW THE ENTIRETY OF IT as I have seen.<br>  <br>  p.s. I have also dated a pisces so I know them well and two of my best friends are pisces too.<br>  <br>  <br>  OK...<br>  I am not getting personal. I do not look into your accounts to see who you are to me or what you are like by your other aswers/questions. This is my opinion on this issue and you have your own also. I did not attack you guys, you attacked me (by saying ASSumining and calling me an ****hole) and I defended my standpoint. <br>  Quit bringing my child into this. You have no idea of who I really am, just as I don't know who you really are. Yet I have not attacked you and don't plan on it because I am better than that. Thank you.<br>  :-)<br>  And maybe it is the people I've hung out with, but they ARE in the military (and in my age range, I do understand that old-school military is completely different, and yes, honorable. Seems like now most people just serve to have a job and not for the honor) and that is my take on it based on my experience which is what YA is for, right?<br>  <br>  Also, if you look at the first answer I wrote, you will see that I said, "BUT it all depends on who you are as a person"... ie: everyone is different so can handle different things.<br>  <br>  p.p.s. "who YOUR hanging out with" should be You're, not your.  Your shows possession, and you're is a conjugation for you are.|`|3WItFAwlaa	I'm starting to believe that a mandatory two year service in the military for all American would be very good idea.  I know I could use a little of the discipline that the military would've provided.  The ignorance of that first answer shows what a thankless job defending our country has become.  It is disgusting that our last few presidents never spent one day of their lives doing so.  People have no respect for anything any more.  <br>  <br>  I have a Pisces friend who has a Pisces son who is in the Army.  He was a sensitive artist little boy with a tremendous sense of honor.  He was always defending children who were weaker than he was.  Now he defends our country.  When he was stationed in the Middle East, his job was to rebuild bridges that had been blown up.  My friend asked him if he ever got discouraged rebuilding the same bridge several times.  He just said that it had to be done.  <br>  <br>  Your question says "I am very well interested in joining the Army".  If that is true, then join.  Don't let assh*oles like the first answerer discourage you,  Good luck.<br>  <br>  ***The only thing J25 knows about what I know is my answer to her question about her Virgo baby that she gave be best answer for.  I am feeling sorry for that child having such a closed minded mother.

ee1TLZ2gaa	This is one of the worst signs put together. Because, Sagittariuses  are jokers, they aren't as serious as Capricorns. Capricorns seek security, someone decent, knows what they're doing, what they want, and how to get it. They aren't attracted to people who are confused or lost. Sagittarius is the "one night stand" kind of person. Likes to joke, and looks forward to tomorrow more than they do about today.<br>  <br>  Also, Sagittarius will accidentally make you the butt of all jokes. CAPRICORNS HATE THAT !

4P9no5CTaa	These two could stumble upon each other almost anywhere and wind up getting married the next day. There are strange but true occurrences when a Cancer and Libra meet. These two cannot get enough of one another and Libra will truly appreciate the sensitive side of Cancer. There will be a lot of baby talk, gifts given and displays of romance. Sex will be great with Libra, and Cancer can sexually energize Libra in a way like no other. This is a memorable and worthwhile encounter that has potential for children and marriage. Cancer must brush up their social skills while Libra could learn a few lessons about patience and tolerance from Cancer. These two will balance each other out beautifully. There are too many promising aspects for sex and love to ignore. Cancer will create a sparkle in Libra’s eyes. Experience this relationship while you can. <br>  <br>  <br>  3 hearts|`|uFSDEo9Uaa	See <a href="http://zodiacal-compatibility.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://zodiacal-compatibility.blogspot.c...</a><br>  The site explains compatibility between all possible combinations among the zodiacal signs, with emphasis on relationships.

ILbgqBLxaa	its on. but the cast will most likely NOT be returning for the 4th film. however if they are given a good amount of money MAY return. all we know for plot at the moment is that it WILL feature and have a plot around the freshman that were introduced in the third film. It has also been finalized that jack bolton (father of troy) will be returning yet his role in the plot is unknown. the plot is hard to decide without the cast members that were in the first three movies but the cast at this time does not feel that they can take the story any farther than senior year and that starting with a younger cast is the only way to move ahead in production and still hold the fan base<br>  <br>  if you have anymore questions email alycat1232@yahoo.com|`|hGVkInSnaa	Supposedly it's being written, but I don't see the necessity for it.

xFSXryiaaa	first of all, you posted a link to one of the worst pix of regina ever taken.  anyone can take a bad picture, even a beautiful woman.  especially celebrities who cant go anywhere without a bunch of bozos snapping away.  i posted a link below to some better pix of regina.<br>  dont get me wrong i think taylor is ridiculously beautiful and so dam tall she makes me want to go ape-lesbo to be honest.  but so does regina.  for me, like most people i think, the mouth and eyes are most often used to evaluate beauty provided everything else is in place and not too salient.  regina's got those huge, beautiful blue eyes that will hypnotize u if u get too close.  taylor has small, unremarkable eyes.  regina also has those nice, sweet, full lips that u just wanna kiss till u die.  taylor has nice lips too but reginas are much better.  most important, regina seems to be smiling all the time, taylor not so.  most people are prettier when they smile, so my vote has to go with regina based purely on physical beauty.  but i cant separate that from the non-physical beauty,  so together with the fact that regina has a sweeter voice, plays much better music, and is a brilliant songwriter, regina wins hands down.|`|7hfbQTxjaa	I have to say Regina:)<br>  Taylor is pretty and all, but Regina is much more unique and has her own style.<br>  Regina Spektor<3333333|`|jeZmqhNcaa	I don't think regina is very pretty, but her music is better|`|0QR5sSICaa	Taylor all the way|`|F8AeRhFyaa	Taylor swift. 1000 times better|`|7lXXOJwIaa	I Think Taylor is prettier|`|e55d4a01420a2827c4108baf10b7d77daa	It's a close one, but Taylor Swift is a little hotter.

Somatic class)<br>  <br>  But in the manga, the difference is mainly concerning Mikan's powers. She was found to have 2 Alices, the Nullifying Alice and an Alice that could steal another person's Alice. <br>  <br>  Mikan's parents past is only touched on in the manga. Her father was once a teacher in the Alice Academy when her mother was still attending. Her father was the teacher in charge of the Dangerous Ability Class at that time and was the teacher of Persona. <br>  <br>  After her father died(i think it had something to do with the academy), her mother gave birth to Mikan and left her at the grandfathers before going to join the Anti-Alice organization. Mikan inherited the stealing Alice from her.<br>  <br>  She appears in the later parts of the manga and you can easily see the resemblance between Mikan and her. She's currently still alive.

InAICv25aa	I've had the same kind of stuff happen to me. I first performed when I was 8, and I still remember the memory blank I had. Then I had a period where I started shaking uncontrollably. It really just comes and goes...<br>  <br>  1. Pretend you're playing for people while you're in the practice room. So a day before the concert, go to your instrument, bow to "nonexistant" public, start playing, and don't stop. Whatever happens, imagine this IS the performance. When you're done, you'll know which parts of the piece you don't do well under pressure. Repeat those.<br>  <br>  2. Plan out everything you're going to do onstage. If you know the room already, picture how you're going in, how you're going to bow, how you're going to the piano, what your first note is. (A friend of mine did an international competition and forgot how to start his piece) It's the details that count. You don't want your mind to blank out as soon as you enter the stage.<br>  <br>  3. Practice makes perfect. To get a really good performance of a piece, playing the piece a lot in your practice room won't let you improve much after a certain point. You need to perform that piece a few times. It's only after a few tries of stage fright on that piece probably that you'll get it as well as you play at home. Try to perform as much as you can. <br>  <br>  4. Peers are actually really frightening, I think much more frightening than a real audience because they know every single mistake you make, and are much less likely to forgive you for them. Plus, you have to hear afterward how much they liked (or not) your performance. I always shake much more for studio classes than playing for an audience of strangers. So I think it actually makes more sense you shake for a performance with your class.<br>  <br>  5. You know professional performers have their little quirks during the concert day? It helps with the stage fright. Some want their lucky penny in their left pocket, some insist on eating a banana right before. I can't give you sources, but I'm definitely sure of it. If anyone can list anything odd things by professional performers, I'd be glad to read it.<br>  <br>  6. I don't know about piano, but when I was shaking, it was because of the way I held my bow, so technical problems actually made my stage fright worse. <br>  <br>  Hope all this helps! I still can't overcome my fear sometimes--when the stakes are high, when I'm not familiar with a piece--but performing more helps with the stage fright thing. Some people never get over it. I know the famous violinist Menuhin stopped playing in public for a while because he kept shaking, so now you know the greatest musicians in the world had the same problem. Don't get discouraged!|`|qswrz268aa	What is there to fear? Especially if most of the audience are complete strangers that you will probably never meet in your life. So even if you have a complete blunder, why will it matter? <br>  <br>  The key is optimism over fear... You can do it!! I know you can!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|mUP35mo7aa	Betend that they arent their. Andd you know what i think when i come to that scituation i say to my self " who cares what they think at least i try" - good luck|`|951tTsRQaa	I have the EXACT same problem!  I recently performed on the piano and I was physically shaking so that I really couldn't play well.  My fingers wouldn't work and I couldn't even pedal well, my whole body was shaking so bad.  I had to perform on the violin, too, and music doesn't come out well when your fingers don't work and your bow is shaking.  Unfortunately, I haven't found out how to completely eliminate these symptoms of nerves, but I have noticed something.  The more absorbed I become in my playing while performing, the easier it is to let the crowd go and do well.  Let yourself enjoy the music you are playing.|`|KYFLS2Qyaa	Yeah stage fright is a common thing. All people probably have it more or less, you might have it more than others. Yeah if you keep facing your fear of singing or speaking to a crowd of people you'll get used to it, probably as you get older it'll become easier too. My tips for overcoming that fright is for you to realize that there's nothing to be afraid of, it's not like you're going to die if you get something wrong sometime, all people make mistakes. For your trembling hands, well if you don't want to drink alcohol before every performance you just need to practice and lower your nervousness level.|`|RQpasDZaaa	Performance fears are pretty bad.  But if you brainstorm honestly with yourself, you will realize that the fear is based on believing that you will make a mistake, or many mistakes.  Stop the chances of many mistakes by practicing. Practice, practice, practice.<br>  <br>  Once you know you're not likely to make any mistakes, you have to realize that making a mistake occurs more often than most people think.  And when you make a mistake, your career's not over, and the world will still keep turning.  So you will have a better chance of learning from your mistake.  Some of them will even make you laugh at yourself.<br>  <br>  Alway's take three deep breaths before performing, and learn to have fun with it.  Even when you make a mistake.  This will help you recover from your mistakes a lot easier.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	When I was younger, yes, I got nervous. It's normal. Eventually it goes away just keep playing in front of people. I'm guessing you have the same kind of anxiety if you have to do public speaking. There isn't much to do than convince yourself that you are 100% ready to do it. I could say ignore the fact that there are people out there, but that's impossible. <br>  <br>  So do the next best thing. KNOW that you are better than any of them.|`|mZlPj8Guaa	Practice does make perfect.<br>  <br>  I used to teach religious classes. And I had to do this in front of 7th graders. VERY hard grade to teach. Well, I overcame my problem with repetition. It did help that I had a good class that did not make fun of me and my mistakes.<br>  <br>  Picturing people in their underwear did not work for me. For obvious reasons.|`|GhetCx0iaa	I didnt read all of that, because its long. But i like to sing, and i used to get so so so nervous - you dont even know! The way to overcome your fear is to just go out there and do it, dont even think about it.<br>  <br>  You're always always going to have little nerves before a performance, but it will get easier each time, and the crowd reaction is deffinetly rewarding! <br>  goodluck xoxo0x|`|vbNVlcNNaa	I've been singing in front of people since I was 3 and I still get nervous.<br>  <br>  Just breathe and try not to think too hard about the audience. Juts try to stay focus on what you are doing. I like to stare at a spot on the back wall and sing to it. By the middle of the song, my nerves are gone.|`|ziFMYqtoaa	Keep doing it!  Each time you play in front of people, you get more <br>  used to it.|`|WPVpOfuwaa	play in a park in front of complete strangers. <br>  you get to practice and overcome your fear.

g4APbW4Naa	Two common sources are the Overstreet Comic Book Guide and Wizard magazine.<br>  <br>  The Overstreet Guide costs about $20, is released annually (the next edition is due on April 7) and is VERY complete and thorough.  Available in bookstores and comic stores.  (You might be able to find last year's guide cheaply...)<br>  <br>  Wizard magazine is available monthly at comic shops and newstands, and lists prices also, but due to space constraints, it only prints prices for the most commonly sold and traded comics.<br>  <br>  While these will give you the widely-accepted values for certain comics, you won't discover their true value until you try to sell them.  Some stores buy at "50% of guide" or some other percentage.  The simplest answer, of course, to "How much are they worth?" is "How much is someone else willing to pay?"|`|rrBbcOPWaa	Also, one nice website I use is www.comicspriceguide.com <br>  It's pretty user friendly and really good for a quick glance of what a book could bring.

She opened it then slammed it shut and stormed back into the house. A little later she came out of her house again, went to the mailbox and again opened it, and slammed it shut again.

"Your car looks like an accordion that was stomped on by an elephant. Are you OK ma'am?" <br>  "Yes, officer, I'm just fine" the blonde chirped. <br>  "Well, how in the world did this happen?" the officer asked as he surveyed the wrecked car. <br>  "Officer, it was the strangest thing!" the blonde began. I was driving along this road when from out of nowhere this TREE pops up in front of me. So I swerved to the right, and there was another tree! I swerved to the left and there was ANOTHER tree! I served to the right and there was another tree! I swerved to the left and there was ...." <br>  "Uh, ma'am", the officer said, cutting her off, "There isn't a tree on this road for 30 miles.

Get yourself involved in other drama that is not with relationships or life threatening. Think about all the good things in life and think of the bad things about the person. Stay away from those depressing songs and listen to songs like “Breaking dishes” by Rihanna or songs that make you feel better about yourself and how stupid he is.

fKcr6KU0aa	For more shounen-ai (boy's love) anime, I'd recommend:<br>  <br>  Sukisho<br>  Gakuen Heaven<br>  Junjou Romantica<br>  <br>  All of these are short - Junjou Romantica is the longest one, since it has two seasons.<br>  <br>  If you like Gravitation and you are okay with fantasy/medieval comedy, you may like Kyou Kara Maou (Kyo Kara Maoh!) - it has a lot of strong, deliberate shounen-ai implications, though there isn't any actual romance that I remember.  It's really long, though (100+ episodes).<br>  <br>  ...I'd actually recommend KKM over some of the straight-out shounen-ai stuff, since it's so much fun.<br>  <br>  For shows about bands and singing...there's Kaikan Phrase.  I haven't seen much of that one, though, so I can't recommend it personally.<br>  <br>  For bishoujo stuff - Maria-sama ga Miteru is really addictive, though I think it's probably more serious than what you're looking for?  Best Student Council (Gokujou Seitokai) is a comedy with some shoujo-ai implications that is a lot of fun, too (though not really a romance).|`|lMYIKNE2aa	i agree with the person above me :D~<br>  junjou romantica is love~!<br>  its so cute~<br>  as for series bout bands and singing<br>  i recommend skip beat! ~ <br>  its one of my favorite animes ^^~|`|6qDhXpWfaa	Yaoi/Boy Love:<br>  <br>  Junjou Romantica - SO good =D<br>  Gakuen Heaven - boy love too, a bit more mild, but still good<br>  Antique Bakery - very funny<br>  Loveless<br>  <br>  Yuri/Girl Love:<br>  <br>  KashiMashi<br>  Strawberry Panic!<br>  <br>  Bands/Singing:<br>  <br>  Nana - loads of romance and follows the band "black stones" and how they get pic. Very good. Osaki Nana, the vocalist of black stones and reira form Trapnes sings =)<br>  <br>  Beck - very music and band oriented. Some singing too

tuvcxnJXaa	Of the five movies that were nominated, it definitely deserved to win.    'Milk' was quite good, also, and I liked 'The Reader' more than I thought I would.    'Frost/Nixon' was so-so, but NOT Oscar-caliber.   'Benjamin Button' was a remake of 'Forrest Gump'.|`|OotxETpGaa	I haven't seen Slumdog but to whoever said that Benjamin Button was a remake of Forrest Gump clearly didn't pay much attention<br>  it was nothing like Forrest Gump, unless you consider the way Benjamin talked...both he and Forrest had prominent Southern accents<br>  other than that two different stories and Benjamin Button was amazing|`|zovrJ0yXaa	of the nominees i only saw slumdog and benjamin button, and slumdog was the better of the two. but it wasnt as good as wall-e or the dark knight. so yes and no|`|yqe0I5zpaa	Yes, the movie was very well-made. The story of the film is haunting, both Boyle made it with such pride, it was tragic and disturbing at times, funny in brief areas and in other times you wanted to smile and just let out a shout of excitment. The film is truly incredible, it is filled with tremendous performances, the soundtrack was great. The movie is a once in a life-time film, i've never seen anything like it, most likely will never again, that is why it was the Best Picture of the year.
sS352szAaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_and_Mary_Parker" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_and...</a>|`|AA10614226	In Amazing Spider-Man Annual #5 it was revealed that the Parker's were assigned to infiltrate an Algerian based spy-ring controlled by a communist agent who took on the identity of the Red Skull. After the Skull learned of their true intentions, he had them killed by blowing up their plane. Peter first learned the truth about his parents after discovering some photos of his deceased parents, and asked his Aunt May the full story. At first, it was thought that the Parkers were traitors to their country, but Peter went to Algeria to find the truth. After defeating the Skull, he also learned that his parents were double agents.<br>  <br>  Peter found the necessary evidence to clear his parents, and not much was else was said about them until years later. At the end of Amazing Spider-Man #363, a couple with a striking resemblance to Peter's parents were introduced, and in Amazing Spider-Man #365 the family was "reunited". It was explained that Russian agents saved the Parkers just before the plane explode, and served time in various prisons before they were set free after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Everything went smoothly for a couple of years for the Parker "family", but of course, this is the Spider-Verse after all. Something was wrong.<br>  <br>  In Amazing Spider-Man #388, it was revealed that Peter's parents were artificial life constructs, an off-shoot of the same technology that allows the Chameleon to change appearances, with the help of bio-chips the size of body cells. The whole affair had to do with the Chameleon's plan to discover Spider-Man's true identity. In the end though, the Chameleon never got the truth out of the constructs before they were both destroyed. Peter eventually learned in Amazing Spider-Man #389, that it was the Green Goblin II (Harry Osborn) who was the mastermind behind the constructs, for payback on his belief that Spider-Man killed his father, the original Green Goblin.|`|gJMBiuIdaa	The first person NAILED it. However, they left out the recently popular Ultimate version.<br>  <br>  <br>  In Ultimate Spider-Man, Richard Parker and Eddie Brock Sr. invented the symbiote Venom. The project was funded by Trask Industries. Once Trask realizes the military potential of the symbiote, they cut Parker and Brock out of the project. Later, Parker and Brock are planning on making a deal with Trask Industries over ownership of the symbiote. To prevent any deal from occuring, Trask destroyed the plane that Peter's and Eddie Brock's parents were on.
d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	I know this isn't a reasonable suggestion, but I bought an Orange tube amp this weekend and that thing even makes my standard Tele sound heavy. Hell, I just put my distortion pedals away, don't need them anymore. Awesome freakin' amp!! That is what James Root uses if I'm not mistaken. Good luck.|`|4wlwyhvnaa	A lot could depend on strings as well. You are going to want a heavy low e string probably a 52 gauge. What I use are the Ernie Ball Beefy slinky which is the yellow pack if you go buy them. If you have the wrong strings your sound wont be very good. Try that and I hope that helps some.|`|V4ZSGQBoaa	Try adjusting your amplifier so that your low is turned up, your mid is mid and your treble is around 7 and your bass mostly up.  Your pedal should supply you with plenty of gain.  This should work if you are plugging your pedal into your amps guitar input. I am unfamiliar with your amp so it may have a specific input for pedals/effects loops.  If you are plugged into the guitar input make sure that you are using your clean channel.  If you have your amp on the distorted channel with your pedal they will not react correctly and sound like garbage together.|`|e0WfWpwTaa	This could be because of how you have the EQ Settings on your Boss Metal Zone. <br>  <br>  If you think your sound is thin, kick up the low end EQ Control. <br>  <br>  I suggest experimenting with EQ Configurations, I have a Boss MT-2 and can get some really awesome, heavy tones out of it|`|xtnwyELDaa	try using "drop D" tuning.

Kyle realized he could get rid of it through electricity (short it out).  He didn't want her to notice, Jessie was helping him and they decided he could pass the electricity through a kiss. He needed to practice his control and didn't want to hurt Amanda so he practiced on Jessie. Then Amanda walked in.

Ultimately, the two sides opted for the last resort of diplomacy - in other words, they went to war. Our story begins roughly a year later. Heliopolis, a resource satellite belonging to a neutral nation, is suddenly attacked by a Zaft mobile suit force. Their goal is to seize the Atlantic Alliance’s newest Gundam mobile suits, which the Alliance has produced here amid total secrecy. The raid is successful, and Zaft captures four of the Gundams. Kira Yamato, a student at an industrial college, is drawn into the conflict when he is reunited with his old friend Athrun Zara.

Tohru finds out that certain members of the Sohma family have a curse on them, when hugged by members of the opposite sex, they turn into animals from the zodiac. Since Tohru is a girl living with three of the zodiac guys, she sometimes turns them into animals (obviously). There's a lot of things in this that would make you laugh so much you wouldn’t be able to breath.<br>  <br>  Ayashi no Ceres<br>  There is a legend of an angel who fell to Earth many years ago, and was forced to marry a man because he held the key to her only way home.

Shinichiro has known Hiromi for years, but before he had always treasured her smile, though now she acts coldly when at home and he cannot bring up the nerve to talk with her either. When she is at school, Hiromi is popular, always smiles, and is talented in sports, but Shinichiro knows she must be hiding things inside her. At school, he meets a strange girl named Noe Isurugi who wishes him misfortune after Shinichiro teases her. After a bit of bad luck, he reconciles with Noe by crafting a chicken out of a tissue box and finds out from her that she "gave her tears away".

It's both an anime and a manga.<br>  <br>  "Set in Victorian London at the end of the 19th century, Emma is the story of a maid who falls in love with a member of the gentry. However, the young man's family disapproves of him associating with people of the lower classes."<br>  <br>  Also, for old-school shoujo anime, The Rose of Versailles.<br>  <br>  "Raised from birth as a man, the Lady Oscar commands the palace guards at Versailles in the years before the French Revolution. Her beauty and noble spirit make her a shining figure in the eyes of both men and women but she is torn between her chosen life of service and duty to class and country and her own heart and desires. She lives as a noble amidst the opulence of Versailles but her keen senses and compassion are not blinded to the poverty of the French people."<br>  <br>  And Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo, too, though that one is not shoujo.  And also set in the future (!?!) even though it is based on a historical novel.<br>  <br>  "Trying to escape his uneventful life, Albert, the son of a renowned general from Paris, makes a journey with his friend Franz. During his travels, he meets an immensely wealthy nobleman named The Count of Monte Cristo. Living in luxurious hotels, surrounded by beautiful women and strong bodyguards, the charming but enigmatic count fascinates Albert. Albert invites the count to join the high society of Paris. However, unknown to Albert, his father had once framed the count and took the Count's fiancee as his own."<br>  <br>  Also seconding Rurouni Kenshin, also not shoujo (though it is very good).|`|X3dfHBGGaa	fruits basket<br>  skip beat<br>  wild ones<br>  special A<br>  wallflower|`|IcPX9VSAaa	shugo chara <br>  fruits basket<br>  azumanga daioh<br>  cardcaptor sakura|`|sXMqIgQZaa	Rurouni Kenshin|`|100d4d6d377b86b48c4e5e6fa8632cb5aa	fruits basket <br>  wallflower<br>  tsubasa chronicles<br>  dnangel<br>  pretear|`|dpAD1KoEaa	inuyasha.<br>  but if you'll settle for my fave... code geass is awesome.

kP0JGI1waa	I will have to go with Axis Bold as Love.  I mean AYE? is great but it has alot of the tunes you hear all the time.  I mean Purple Haze is great, but yeah.  Electric Ladyland is one where I have to be in the mood because of its experimenting and longer jam based songs, although it is brilliant. ABaL is the one where I can always listen to it, some fabulous songs and a well-paced album in terms of speed and intensity mixing it up.  Plus Little Wing has to be my fave hendrix song ever!<br>  <br>  BQ: Whoops, jumped the gun. Prob Little Wing, although Machine Gun, Villanova Junction. Spanish Castle Magic, Wind Cries Mary, etc are all incredible.<br>  <br>  edit: oh snap dude my bad, you are totally right, i was just kind of listing my hendrix songs i forgot about you saying jhexp explicitly.  now i just sound like some wannabe hendrix fan when i actually know alot about him. wow.<br>  <br>  edit2: actually i guess they played it on the dick cavett show, with mitch on drums and billy cox on guitar, so i guess 2/3 of the jhexp.  haha i thought for some reason i had seen mitch play it before...|`|GbyHQQLiaa	Well I'd actually have the list in reverse:<br>  1. Electric Ladyland 2. Are You Experienced? 3. Axis: Bold As Love<br>  <br>  They are all brilliant but Electric Ladyland has to be my favourite.<br>  <br>  BQ: 1983, Voodoo Child, All Along The Watchtower, Little Wing, Are You Experienced?|`|7sqjaYx6aa	1. are you experienced<br>  2. axis: bold as love<br>  3: electric ladyland<br>   <br>  BQ: foxey lady, hey joe, purple haze, fire, voodoo child, castles made of sand, all along the watchtower|`|XHwhhSgaaa	Hmm...I like Axis: Bold as Love and Are You Experienced the best.<br>  Favorite songs:<br>  Spanish Castle Magic<br>  Castles Made of Sand<br>  Little Miss Lover<br>  Hey Joe<br>  Purple Haze|`|i5YJBqnZaa	1 Are You Experienced?<br>  #2 Axis, Bold As Love<br>  #3 Electric Ladyland<br>  <br>  Favourite song: Third Stone Fom The Sun|`|EzqfAUFuaa	it's too hard for me to order them. they each got that special thing about them that could put them above the rest, but then the rest each has that special thing, so i cant say...<br>  <br>  bq:  1983... (a merman i should turn to be) and little wing :)|`|hZegT1raaa	are you experienced?<br>  <br>  bq: purple haze

Dumbass.|`|jUXGp146aa	definatly guns n roses<br>  <br>  Guns N' Roses has sold an estimated 100 million albums worldwide, including over 43 million in the United States. The band's 1987 major label debut album Appetite for Destruction has sold in excess of 28 million copies and reached number one on the United States Billboard 200. In addition, the album charted three Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, including "Sweet Child O' Mine" which reached number one. The 1991 albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II debuted on the two highest spots on the Billboard 200 and have sold a combined 14 million copies in the United States alone. After over a decade of work, the band released their follow-up album, Chinese Democracy, in 2008.<br>  <br>  The band has sold over 19 million records in the United States and their worldwide sales exceed 85 million albums.<br>  <br>  The original lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, percussion and vocals) is the most successful and identifiable. With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personae of comic book-style characters: The Demon (Simmons), Starchild (Stanley), Spaceman (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. The "Demon" makeup reflected Gene's cynicism and dark elements, as well as his love for comic books. Paul Stanley became the "Starchild" due to his tendency to be referred to as the "starry-eyed lover" and "hopeless romantic." Ace Frehley's "Spaceman" makeup was a reflection of him wanting to go for a ride in a space ship and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss' "Catman" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Peter had nine lives due to his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Due to creative differences, both Criss and Frehley were out of the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes had also waned considerably by that point.<br>  <br>  but i definatly think guns n roses. chinese democrasy was a big let down though...|`|0PFQipk4aa	KISS- they are classic.

I decided to Google "who are you wearing?" and came up with this pertinent CNN article...<br>  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/02/10/academy.awards.dresses/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/0...</a><br>  that pretty much supports what I had already said.<br>  <br>  "If all goes well -- and especially if she turns out to be one of the evening's winners -- the gown can propel not only the actress to new heights of stardom, but her designer as well."<br>  <br>  Here's another...<br>  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7019234/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7019234/</a><br>  "It’s a given nowadays that stars get to keep the outfits they wear — some worth thousands of dollars. But the new buzz is that some companies, especially those late to the celebrity dressing game, will offer cash to ensure that stars wear their label."

Change can be a good thing.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	I moved here almost seven years ago and left behind my family, my home, hometown and old job for a big organization to live here with my husband. I love being here because this is where my husband is. Some of the area is nice and interesting, but really too close to Toronto for me. I am very much a country girl. I used to go hiking and kayaking all by myself where  I lived up north. Here I can't do these things alone because my husband is afraid strangers could hurt me if I run into any. Also we have next to no money for doing the fun and interesting entertainment around here because over half of our money goes to hubby's ex. I like that my husband built alot of this home himself, it's a nice place. But it is big for just two people. And it would be nice to have a house that is just mine and his, with nobody else's history so I could feel free to decorate the way I want without changing something that has a bunch of feelings and sentimentality for them.|`|oXf5Ir5Uaa	id rather move to a new house more than a new place because then id have to switch schools again|`|nkmwGAKjaa	I would love to, but am very afraid to make any kind of move in this financial climate.|`|yo30g3pPaa	Not really. but I want to move now<br>  I simply think that Tennessee has nothing for me, and the people are immature.

Poor panda.<br>  <br>  I Love The gay twin... shes so cool... its nice to see someone gay that isn't a guy for once.. although i cant for the life of me remember her name :P<br>  <br>  Effys a bit messed up because of her family and that... its a great twist because you want her to be lovely and she just isnt.<br>  <br>  I also think skins season one and two was better than three, although  three is pretty good. There's too meany chavs in this one.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. My favourite is Jay Jay.
kP0JGI1waa	idk man what bands are playing in it? i saw last years w/ opeth, btbam, dt, and some band named 3 and it was incredible (although they shafted btbam on time).<br>  <br>  edit: i looked around and didnt see any dates.  it looks like dt, zpz, and two bands called pain of salvation and beardfish i have never heard of.  i dont think it will be as good as last year, so i prob wont go.

0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	I so agree with you Hotlips and no Jade wasn't racist, just lost her temper with a stuck up baitch.  Given Jade's horrendous childhood it is no wonder she has a temper because she must have so much repressed anger inside her and it had to come out somewhere bless her.  I had wondered myself whether Davina had had any contact with her - you would have thought she could have had the decency to wouldn't you?  Hadn't thought about the producers - they stitched her up big time with that CBB and I hope they are feeling remorseful and ashamed of themselves now.  As to BB going ahead this year, yes I think it should and I know Jade wouldn't want it any other way.|`|aGwjf2y4aa	why shouldnt the show go on shes not the only person dying with cancer i mean i really do feel for her and have been reading up on everything about her lately and for me she did make bb and should have won i think everyone is going on about it as it came as a shock that its only 2 weeks she has left she will always be remembered as the biggest bb star as for the shilpa thing i dont even thing jade done anything wrong that shilpa was asking for it and was so clearly winding her up so she said popadoms soo what|`|zZ3Uxllfaa	i read somewhere they  were going to do a couple of specials being that its the tenth series and  Jade was going to feature in them thats if she's well enough for it ,I hope she is bless her .|`|FcHplZtQaa	I completely agree hun.....<br>  <br>  Why wasn't Davina or Dermott at the wedding???<br>  <br>  And no I think BB SHOULD go ahead, if it didn't WTF would we do???|`|NQFV2AdZaa	There were a lot of messages in Heat magazine today from heatworld users and her fellow celebs. Davina, Dermot, even Danielle and Jo sent messages of support. Her fellow BB housemates Tim Culley and Spencer Smith also sent supportive messages.  Regarding the locals in India, after the race row, they held a hate campaign against Shilpa after Richard Gere kissed her on the cheek in public! So it proves that they overreact over the slightest thing, so Jade was an easy target for them. I didn't think she was racist though. I do hope BB10 will still be on!|`|Kkov1gVWaa	I dont know if Davina has but I just want to say that I think Jade is amazing. She goes out bald in to which stars who have had Cancer I havent ben seen bald. She has raised a lot of awareness over this also. She is a fighter & I have seen her programmes on Living TV & she is very open about her cancer.|`|1hLxd5DWaa	i dont know but im getting pretty fed up of hearing about her, i mean yes it is an awful thing that is happening to her but what about all the other people in the country dying from cancer who cant afford their bills anymore and she gets ￡1million contracts - why is it more important that she is dying just because she is famous? Its sad for anyone around the world.|`|AE9dKMEFaa	davina is on twitter all the time, and said yesterday that the wedding was amazing, jade looked wonderful and the whole ceremony was beautiful.|`|N8gFlymmaa	In the Sun one of the producers of bb made a statement concerning jades cancer.|`|ZulFhMdIaa	they should release a statement, but its not like she is the queen and the show shouldnt be cancelled because of the situation.|`|079IZgBAaa	i think that if she has cancer she should be allowed to live the rest of her days in peace but as all celebrities do they make attention of them self's and she made a big deal of her wedding and she should just be left in peace and its people like you who care about someone thats racist that has cancer but you couldnt careabout any one else that has cancer and when she was making all her money and you cared about her when she insulted another persons race and she doesnt care about you or anything you do<br>  <br>  <br>  also why would they cancel it just because shes dying that would mean a loss of money for channel 4 so why would they do that|`|bNykcEVXaa	I think BB should go ahead....<br>  ...and I will be watching that load of cr*p<br>  <br>  I have as much sympathy for Jade as i have for all the other millions of people dying of cancer... no more .. no less<br>  <br>  in fact I may have more for others who were no as lucky as she has been in her recent life.<br>  <br>  <br>  dR bad<br>  you in a fighting mood Hot??|`|AA10077992	I'm sure there will be BB10 - there's GOT to be !<br>  I will agree with Tony that Davina is on Twitter so she 'does her bit' but it may be the right time , now, for the BB bosses to issue a statement- as you rightly say - Jade IS Big Brother and well done to her for her fantastic bravery during this dreadful time<br>  Jermaine was equally if not more racist in CBB than  Danielle ( the other 2 were ,very much, egged on)
Wly8rqrKaa	I'd like to know more - like how statistically significant these results are.  For example were the numbers really close, or was there a statistically significant difference between Aries and Sagittarius?<br>  <br>  For that matter, how much did the numbers differ between Sagittarians and scorpios?<br>  <br>  100% / 12 months = 8.33333 % / star sign<br>  <br>  I'd only find this interesting if the sample was large enough and saggitarians were well above this 8% and arians were way below!|`|42SR3g2jaa	I would like to know more about it. That company is GEICO, if I'm not mistaken. I would first suspect a twisting of statistics, but yet I see no reason for them to twist the statistics? <br>  <br>  It would be great if they actually published the numbers. It looks like it would be interesting to read.<br>  <br>  Edit @ Dr Octavian: No, it is not astrologically sound that the sign Sagittarius would be prone to have the highest rate of accidents.|`|AA11508270	I(many other people too) have always say this about statistic.  You can twist any statistic to fit a certain agenda.  I can easily take any sport whether be it basketball, soccer, or football(American), and give some random stat concerning the months they are born.  For example, let's take basketball.  I am sure if i collect all the data(let's say points scored) of all the basketball players born in different months of the year, i will most likely find some gap between some months.  This is what you call a coincidence.  There is nothing causal about being a certain Zodiac sign will cause you to have more or less accidents.|`|ajzq5nKIaa	Unfortunately, without accompanying statistics such as number of drivers polled and relative proportions of each star sign rated by whether they did -and- didn't have accidents, this data is not able to be used for interpretations.<br>  <br>  The 'study' may be true, but meaningless... does anyone here know whether it is 'astrologically sound' that Sagittarians should have more accidents than any other? Otherwise it seems to me that in any one experiment, one sign is bound to correlate with more accidents than any other, just because it would be incredibly unlikely to find a completely uniform distribution anywhere. I'd like to see the experiment repeated - although I feel that it would come up entirely differently... <br>  <br>  Like Scrander Berry says above, how statistically significant are the findings? This is the problem with stats - it takes more than just a single phrase like 'sagittarians are worse drivers' to sum up an analysis of data.|`|nUYuqUQTaa	"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, <br>   that we are underlings." -- Julius Caesar, Act 1, Scene 2|`|3GPF11Qpaa	I'm a Sagittarius.  Would you count being hit by a deer as an accident?  Not me hitting the deer but the deer running into the back of the car! Other than that I haven't been in an accident but deer do seem to like to jump out in front of me while driving.|`|MYL2dU8paa	Thats weird...how come it's differnt based on their Horoscope....hmmm...that was interesting...<br>  I'm an Aquarious so for me it's 50/50 <br>  haha|`|k9gp11PMaa	Wow, I REALLY see y people dnt believe in astrology.|`|C3gaC24Iaa	Totally meaningless.<br>  <br>  As you well know, if you list anything, like the number of accidents over a year, babies born, volumes of vomit, how often one picks one's nose, or anything else, and state a category, say birth months, star signs, age groups, sexes, sexual preferences, eaters of various foods, etc...you will get a hierarchy.<br>  The whole point of listing them together will indicate a hierarchy.<br>  Some will do more of some action than others, because that is the function you performed.<br>  Totally meaningless statistics.<br>  <br>  Someone at the Department of highways has too much free time on his/her hands.|`|r1mmYhBQaa	Personally, it makes me happy, as I am an Aries!  So I guess I'm not very likely to be in a car accident.<br>  <br>  One problem though....I've been in 3, actually 4 if you count when a car ran into me when I was doing my paper route years ago.  Though I wasn't driving in any of these accidents, so I don't know if that actually disproves (or weakens) the article or not. :)|`|tip6XQnkaa	interesting statistical coincidence.<br>  <br>  that's all.<br>  <br>  @Donald C, yes, someone must be having a lot of free time his/her hands.|`|jxm3yEHRaa	i lol<br>  <br>  stars?!<br>  <br>  there just faraway suns and they dictate how you drive<br>  <br>  i guess reasonable|`|awLQeRkMaa	It dosn't say much, but it could be true I'm a sag moon never been in a car reck.

rMP9BCyGaa	I'd be more than happy to sit in a bath tub of baked beans for 24 hours to raise money for charity but they'd have to be Heinz! lol.<br>  Red Nose Day coming up soon so there'll be quite a few bathtubs filled with beans and other stuff I should imagine.|`|uqMK3rUZaa	Sure, why not?

It's so much better if you do, You can relate to like everything in the book.|`|qTKSvULiaa	well i found it disappointing somewhat but i am crazy about the book there are a lot of details in the book that are not in the movie some of my favorite parts too|`|DTbrNPsvaa	you should read the book it is way better i love the books but i do not think the movie was all that great|`|XcOGn6quaa	books always are better, and the movies are worse, so very much worse because idiot producers think their "additions" to the movie will be better only to have that blown up in their faces, and for some idiotic reason movie producers keep doing that even though they could make alot more if they did follow the book instead of their own stupid idea's|`|pcJOC416aa	i saw the movie before too and now im reading the books. i probably should have done it the other way around but i surprisingly find the books really boring..|`|6TdlNfgeaa	Twilight sucks.<br>  <br>  I agree with you 100%.

Oooh The Garden, probably :)<br>  <br>  Its really stupid when people say you're not a big fan of a band just 'cause your favourites are their more popular songs, IMO. Why shouldn't you like some of their more well known tracks, as well? <br>  <br>  Like with me, Queen are my favourite band (GNR is my second favourite) and Bohemian Rhapsody is one of my favourite songs by them. But I know and love pretty much every other song they have ever done. So does that make me just discovering them or not a big fan, just 'cause Bohemian Rhapsody is one of my favourites. No, of course not. It just means that I really love Bohemian Rhapsody, Just like you really love Paradise City, Welcome To The Jungle and Civil War. <br>  <br>  Just 'cause you like them, it doesn't mean that you don't know plenty of other GNR songs...<br>  <br>  Oh my gosh, some people annoy me...|`|OrAk4Fpoaa	ITS REALLY HARD TO CHOOSE BUT IF IT WAS THAT OR DEATH I′D SAY:<br>  CIVIL WAR<br>  SWEET CHILD O MINE<br>  DON′T CRY<br>  NOVEMBER RAIN<br>  RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO HELL<br>  NIGHT TRAIN<br>  DOUBLE TALKIN′ JIVE<br>  DEAD HORSE<br>  KNOCKING ON HEAVENS DOOR <br>  MR.

We'd all had 'assistance' from the same brand of hair- lightener, and all wore an identical hairdo, dead straight, with a fringe. We looked quite spooky, and were known as 'those chicks from ' Village of the Damned', a sci- fi movie of the time!|`|DoaMYpfMaa	i went from natural brown to highlights brown and gold the i went blond for my husband now i want to go back to try hazelnut and blond highlights i like changing but it has to look good on me and i think blonde for me didn't work but with highlights it looked great.|`|6a701b4b5de581198b488e25c6da4395aa	ive never dyed mine, but my sister has dyed hers like a brownish colour with high lights only once someone change the colouring in the box and she only realises when she looking in the mirror nd it was red, it was called rum truffle haha|`|iA5kZv15aa	Yes, White blonde, ginger, bright red, green, bright red and blonde stripes (got suspended from school for that one).<br>  Regretted it in the end as I still think that's the reason my hair started falling out...|`|AA10230930	I dye mine all the time, its currently a chocolatey brown, the time before that was a warm auburn!<br>  <br>  Too much grey hairs not to dye, and to hell with growing old gracefully when Im not even 40!!|`|4XTxSfR7aa	i dye it loads. <br>  pink, purple, black, red, brown, blonde, green, blue and orange.|`|7o0YmBroaa	temporary: pitch black and brown<br>  I highlight it blonde/light brown/ carmel/ permanently|`|Xdtel78Naa	ive dyed it a lot, such as aburn, red, brown and once a freak accident it went purple O_o hehe|`|UTZ2Lor4aa	I dyed my hair black once big mistake.

Sometimes it doesn't look good out in the sun.|`|QsyEZhqwaa	She's pretty but oozes sex appeal where as Naomi Campbell is a stunningly attractive woman, but has all the sex appeal (for me) as a dead fish.|`|Hc2XlRO4aa	I think shes a Witch...|`|m5J36D28aa	Same with Elizabeth Hurley, sometimes she looks incredible and other times I want to tell the cat to drag it back outside.<br>  <br>  There are some actresses who are consistent, like Jaclyn Smith, I've never seen her not look outrageously attractive.|`|BZMPax7Naa	I'll agree with that.  I think she's had a lot of work done.|`|m25lpepOaa	I think she's pretty in a "different" way. I mean, to be completely honest if i were to see her in the grocery store or something, i wouldn't pick her out individually and call her 'beautiful'. If you look at a lot of her features, though, she can be 'attractive'.|`|0O3JvmE7aa	I think she's ugly.<br>  <br>  Nothing pretty about her fivehead(too big to be a forehead),carp lips,vein-riddled claw-hands,skinny body and badly done tattoos.|`|vRk86MYnaa	Since she's been stressed out lately, it looks like it's made her age faster in appearance, so she looks pretty ugly now! Her lips look crinkled and her eyes are scary looking. Her veins stick out on her arms too A LOT!|`|aROi7KG5aa	I agree with you. She can be pretty but I do not think stunning.
NV9FoM5Jaa	Check from what? your joking right? Honestly I am sure your good at something besides juvenile behavior. ........Right?....

And get friggin real dude when you get a nest egg built up it's lap dances and black jack........401 k would just confuse you!! lol <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  jk?|`|5ac2dCxJaa	Yes. The thing that your "Retirement Specailist" doesn't tell you is that your 401k gets hit by 17 hidden fees which erode approx. 33% of its value in time and the longer you have it the worse the effect. <br>  <br>  Also I know everyone loves to think that paying taxes on their income in the future instead of now is some great idea but you have to ask yourself 1 question, do you really believe that taxes the year you retire will be lower than today? <br>  <br>  The 401k is the biggest fraud in America. Trust me.|`|6pk6HnuSaa	BUY GM at <$2?<br>  <br>  you cant go wrong really - if it comes back, you will make a killing, at least 1000% in 2 years - if it tanks, the economy will crumble and money will be worthless anyway<br>  <br>  or do what I do - I am buying LEAD|`|bIhyeMJVaa	cashing out my 401k before the recent crash was the best thing I've ever done.  <br>  <br>  Put the money under your mattress.

They don't call them one armed bandits for nothing.|`|AA10690306	Naw, Roulette like the banks and stock market are rigged to pay the house.  If you want to make money then just by US Savings Bonds.  The returns are smaller but you stand a better chance of actually getting your money at the end.|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	put money into your 401k!!! <br>  <br>  <br>  you see this is how the prediction of a minor recession created a major one... and it's exactly how a recession is going to become a depression if people don't cop on...|`|G1VsV0wWaa	Craps is better odds.<br>  Bet the Field...|`|30iqJREVaa	You need to think about what is better for you and more beneficial in the long run|`|rh8m6Wepaa	That's exactly how I feel!|`|AA11644298	probably.  better odds in your favor anyways.  let me know how that works out for you.|`|MaDN7knJaa	what ??<br>  r u saying what should u  do  with ur money??<br>  i would buy the cutest clothes and stuff<br>  <br>  LOL|`|Aavq7SMWaa	Go to Compton and shoot craps.

Zb7H4B3Xaa	Leo and Gemini.<br>  <br>  Scorpio's are too passionate and deep for most Gemini's.

7i6qj4OXaa	This one never has been.  I am now in my sixties and have never had a one night stand in my life.  In fact, I was a one-man woman until my husband betrayed my trust.|`|c0XomxxEaa	No, youd have to wait a while to be with a gemini.. there not really one night stand kinda peepz.. most of the time. Ive known a lot of geminis, and there big flirts but thats all it is.. they like being in a relationship. This is a generalisation ofcourse.|`|n53BNB8taa	It depends on their moon, venus and mars signs.|`|oX7M4FoIaa	No. Pick a Pisces|`|pLUItVZ1aa	yes deffinatley, <br>  geminis, saggitarius and virgos are the signs that are most able to engage in one night stands without feeling guilty, or having feelins for the person after.<br>  least is cancer and libra<br>  <br>  it also depends on your venus and mars though|`|1QKYkISEaa	you are only looking for a one night stand, no need to bother knowing their sign. just get the blood test report. see HIV positive or negative.<br>  buy 4 pills of viagara .....start shooting|`|6c7oOFM7aa	no|`|8ZUVToXgaa	probably. but some of them would want more.|`|ythN9BQgaa	More like a TWO NIGHT STAND!!

cdgm85A6aa	I like him better when playing Edward because he looks great them.

[In my opinion at least.]<br>  I agree with you. He was good in Harry Potter because of his acting skills and stuff, but he was so ugly in Twilight. <br>  I was seriously disappointed with their choice of whom Edward should be. Isn't Edward supposed to be perfect or hot looking or something?<br>  Shouldn't that right there be enough reason NOT to choose Robert?<br>  He is an alright actor, yes, but for Starclan's sake... WHY WOULD THEY CHOOSE HIM?!!<br>  Ew, sets off my freakin gag reflex. [That's not a good thing.]|`|qB7DldnBaa	uhh i think hes ugly when he looks like a mess and dusnt wash his hair...i much prefer him as edward clean cut and every girls fantasy that has read the books|`|SMuXt38iaa	Luv Him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  ?Robert Pattinson?|`|QPbgZ0EPaa	that's wonderful. everybody has their own opinion.|`|XCPctxGHaa	yeah, i saw him at the awards last night & it wasn't a cute vision =/|`|kJgCYNjVaa	blahhh!<br>  i HATE him!<br>  gosh hes freakin disgustingg!!|`|LZeC0blJaa	my personal opinion is that he is SMOKIN'|`|BoGdUFAXaa	ugly is a pretty strong word!!!!!!!!! i don't think hes ugly AT ALL.|`|LZgVsIpKaa	no way!<br>  <br>  he is the opposite.

NZ044KkJaa	because someone was mean and spiteful to them. maybe they live in a family of drugs or abuse or in a broken home. maybe they hang out with the wrong crowd. I wish everyone was kind. (: i think it's easy and rewarding to be kind. (:|`|tDU347knaa	Fear is usually the reason for any type of nastiness, so I suppose such people live very fearful lives.

6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	I'm usually disappointed for most people to lose, but not for Brad and Angelina.  The moment I really like was when Kate Winslet didn't know where he parents were and she told him to whistle.  And he DID!  He whistled just like my dad would when he was looking for us growing up.  He passed away recently and it tickled me to hear it.  I sure knew that sound!<br>  <br>  I wish they would cut back on the filler junk and let the winners speak longer if they want.  Having 5 previous winners introduce the nominees was interesting, but it was slow and a big time waster.|`|4636c77ba0bd1830e80c0cae29293574aa	I was pulling for Slumdog Millionaire all night! Super stoked to see it get so many awards!<br>  Other than that I don't really have high stakes in any of the categories, but I would have liked to see Robert Downey Jr win for Tropic Thunder.

If she makes it through the first few eliminations, she'll build a new fan base, and that show makes everyone look like a lovable sweetheart. If she doesn't go back to making whorish music, and starts making music that's more accessible to an older crowd, I would expect her career to be almost fully revived.|`|BnopoNhhaa	I don't think its a smart career move by far.

Too many actresses were pasty and washed out for me. She had some color to her body and didn't wear white/off white which seemed to be the color of the night.|`|d55D0Ci4aa	Yes, she looked amazing!  I thought she did her little skit with Ben Stiller very nicely too.

0r3Yu1e5aa	i dont know! i was just about to ask the EXACT same question - sorry im no help but i saw this question on google and thought id check it out but no ones answered it yet..
u6Fhrs8naa	Hey, count me in too...I absolutely adored it as well! Yeah, your question is kind of a difficult one but assuming from what the girl (I forgot her name) was doing in the end, (by doing everything Jesse did), we can suppose that he did eventually pass away. It was a very touching plot line and I totally agree with you; it should have had a happy ending. :-)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
ynSXiWWSaa	Superman is about how everyday people are sometimes expected to do things beyond what they are used to doing. They might be looked upon as heroes or put up on a pedestal, whether they asked for it or not. Ultimately, they are only human and are subject to human faults and frailties. The song equates regular people to what Superman had to constantly go through in his life, flipping between being the superhero and Clark Kent.  <br>  <br>  Whether it's appropriate for your friend's memorial kind of depends on the situation. If you feel your friend was experiencing the above, then, yes, it would be a nice song.  Baby Blue is also right about 100 Years...it's often used to celebrate or memorialize a person's lifetime. Five For Fighting is an awesome singer-songwriter!|`|AA12150970	I'm not too sure about appropriateness for a memorial service.  It really depends on the age of the person<br>  Seriously you should listen to the song 100 Years by Five for Fighting.<br>  I heard it at my best friend's funeral and I cried like a baby.  It just has so much meaning to it. I love that song.
nUkCnrA3aa	Ain't that the truth. By far, greatest composer to ever live. Highly debated point- but I am on the Beethoven side 100% <br>  I can assure you, there is no more passionate music in all history, then that which was written in Ludwig Van Beethoven's hand.<br>  -Ryko|`|ThKkn5fKaa	Definitely not a question, but I've been known to make exceptions.<br>  <br>  This qualifies.|`|qswrz268aa	Thats not quite a question... But yes, he certainly is...|`|NrkWd4Aoaa	I agree.|`|7Jt0kLV4aa	This is a true statement.  Beethoven is an amazing composer.  It blows my mind how much he could do even though he was deaf.  It is amazing what a brilliant composer he was.  Imagine everything he heard in his head, even if he couldn't hear it in real life.  I...I'm speechless.|`|P8gGMlbIaa	I'll agree.

qW3dVcRtaa	No shes not stupid, you are for making fun of her. If she wants to wear pink knee high socks she should be able to without immature individuals like yourself making fun of her.  Grow up.|`|of4Ieho2aa	that is what starts fights (my experience )  //// and its like bullying|`|AA11622716	Look at all the people who had the opportunity to make fun of you for being a moron but declined to do so.|`|wdvPCU7Taa	And I didn't tell you to post a stupid question, but no, you just HAD to go and do that.

If she likes knee high pink socks, let her wear them. There may be some things you wear that people feel like making fun of, but they don't because it's sort of pointless other than to make a person feel bad...next time, tell her something you LIKE about what she's wearing :)|`|Rp6cxboYaa	Wow, she must be really cool to be able to make her own socks.  I assume she made them, because if she bought them, that would mean that other people must wear them, but according to you nobody else does.<br>  <br>  What's it like walking around dressed the same as everyone else?  Probably pretty boring, eh?  You probably got your hairstyle from a magazine as well, right?|`|6af207c38805ab4288e53331ea169938aa	I think that is just plain mean of you. Why would you even do that, if she wanted to wear that she did, you don't have the right to tell people what they can wear or what they can't wear. Treat people the way you want to be treated by showing some RESPECT!!!!!|`|2e41492627923affb8e7fc267ed04777aa	No, she wasn't stupid.<br>  But you must really hate what you see in your mirror, if you have to criticize silly stuff like that.<br>  You got a baseball bat? See how many times you can hit yourself in the head without knocking yourself out.|`|m8kF5U84aa	you are so stupid and that is so mean if she wants to do that she can do that so leave her alone and you should say your sorry to her. meany|`|tMcIcpQIaa	Lucky your avatar looks hot so assuming you do  If not I'll phuck you in the phucking face you lazy *****!|`|8BG2tqTGaa	you zebra headed fool|`|jN9qXQz6aa	PINK KNEE HIGHS ARE PHUCKING AWESOME!!!!! she sounds like someone i would hang out with. thats really low, making fun of someone for being different.

Taylor's last album has only been out for a few months, so it is very unlikely that she'll release another one in just a few weeks.<br>  <br>  I've given you a link to her label so you can read about what's going on with her rather than just believe me.
24x4vdCzaa	It's about Taylor having a best friend,she knows everything about him and loves him.
KjzR1k1Kaa	are you trying to vheer me up? thank you! <br>  I think yes, people judge themselves too harshly, and then theres no room for the important things in life. i get nervous in public, because all the other girls are into the makeup, and the fancy hair, and the nails, and the clothes, and more... so should I be TOO?? (im not) but yeah im not saying its  good or right to go around putting other people down,  but its easier to remind yourself about your good qualities when you ask yourself  'would i rather be like that' or something along the line of this, and just be grateful for who you are. no one is perfect. Some people are very beautiful models and are in the magazines because of it, and yes they may be pretty, but the media plays it up and most of it is done on the  computer and with loads of makeup.

Once you are in the room, the door disappears. There is no electricity in the room and no windows. There is a man in the room. He has a knife. What do you use to defend yourself? A chair or a power saw?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A: You use a chair because if you used a power saw, you would have to plug it in and there is no electricity in the room. The answer was really hard for me to get because I thought it was a power saw because you could wack the guy on the head.

UVnr7wrmaa	I think most of the film will be in Bella's point of view, but perhaps they will show Edward. It'd be great if they did :] But you're right when you say that they could be filming in Canada just to make it seem like Alaska. Wow, someone pays attention, hm? :) I just guess that they wouldn't not show a main character through the movie, so they'd have to stick him in somewhere in the middle of Bella's depression, don't you think? Or they might throw in one of the other Cullen's, just for fun :D<br>  <br>  But I'm sure it'll be a great movie, either way, and I'm sure New Moon will get more publicity than Twilight, now that more people have started reading the books. And it'd be great if they filmed Eclipse and Breaking Dawn. Don't they realise how much money they could make from those films?!?<br>  <br>  So Kristen, my answer to your question is... yes, they will most definitely show Edward's perspective sometime through Bella's depression :)|`|DOkWTB8baa	I don't think they should show Edward at all during that time.<br>  I DO think that we should be able to hear him in Bella's mind but not see him.<br>  <br>  It's what makes the reunion at the end so much better. <br>  Seeing him for the first time in a long time :)<br>  <br>  I never understood why they would go there, someone should explain that to me.|`|GL95xSFXaa	Well if you think of it, it's never in Edwards perspective in New Moon. I agree with one of the previous answers. We should be able to hear him in Bella's mind, but not see him. But then again, he is one of the major characters so it'd be stupid to almost completely drop him for like 95% of the movie.<br>  I'm a HUGE fan of the Twilight series.<br>  Hope that helps. =]|`|XcOGn6quaa	all i know is that when i go to see it..i'm bringing a dozen boxes of tissues for all of the girls there that will over react, i'll walk into the theater and yell "okay girls its okay, i brought the tissues"|`|qTKSvULiaa	they might jump to check on edward but no its from bellas point of view|`|SVqjzEE3aa	I want to see that movie sooo bad!!!

gJGn1m7Taa	There's no message anymore.  No stories being told.  It's just a big ole game of simon says now!  (Snap yo fingers, do the stanky leg, shake that laffy taffy)  It's not saying anything anymore.  The new artist need to listen to that classic hip hop and classic rhythm and blues in order to understand and respect what the music was born to be about. <br>  For example:  KRS-1, Wu Tang, Run-DMC, Tupac, Biggie, Big El, Redman, Jay-Z, .......F*** let's even take it to Black Sheep, Black Moon, PRT, K-Solo, Ed OG, YZ, S*** Kwame' even.  <br>  Writing music is all about telling a story.  Your story, my story, a story, fact or fiction.  What does shaking your *** have to do with it?  And speaking of *** shaking -- I also believe that television had an immense affect on music.<br>  Remember when ***** couldn't be said on television.  Damn and hell was on the borderline.  When Uncle Luke and  2 Live Crew got banned in the USA for bad language and scantily clad women gyrating onstage.  Do you not see the same thing everyday now on MTV, BET, VH1, and all those other cable channels, let alone the change in the storylines for daytime soaps and afternoon cartoons.  It's an obvious sign of the changes of time.  If things have expanded to these lengths in 30 years what's left to come in the next?<br>  Music included.  Like KEEPING UP WITH THE JONESES.  <br>  But I feel you, I miss that real stuff too!  That's all I listen too - No radio for me.  The Real Hip Hop is all I can live with!  <br>  We can bring it back y'all if we try together!<br>  Let's find a way to ban THAT bullsh**!|`|IFWishIKaa	Overproduced? You mean things are going mainstream? No, nothing is inherently wrong with that. It's just that the mainstream music is basically ignorant and fake and it gives rap and hip hop as a whole a bad name.<br>  <br>  And you know, old white guys in suits who could give a care less about rap are the ones runnin' the show, just tryna make money. That's what changed.|`|1qUokeKOaa	its not that lyrically they are less skilled its that they rap about what there fans want to hear but there are a few that are different but anyway the game is all together different now most ni99as are just rappin for the money<br>  <br>  not overproduced over hyped by ppl who dont care about lyrics only **** that makes them dance|`|AA11892617	The only way Hip Hop has gotten worse is because more people are gettin CD's off the internet for free. They are workin against the artist who put their heart and soul into the albums. Hip Hop isn' gettin worse lyrically because thats not what hip hop is about. Rap is about expressing how you feel, however coarse it may be to some listeners. And please do not diss the south because the north has never had any good rappers. The south has always stayed the same with the Gangsta rap style. The north had to make its style reflect that of the souths in order to sell records. Thats when you started hearing rappers like Jay-z and Nas start talkin about Choppas and Calicos. I bet no Ni66a from the north can tell me what a Yoppa, Donk, Choppa, Trap, or a slab is. Didn't think so. 334 Wall Street Cert-A-Fyed Choppa Zone! Git It Right!

I think what makes a girl special is what you feel is special.  For example, are most girls you know jealous but this 1 particular girl isn't?  Or do most girls you know hate sports but this 1 particular girl loves sports?  Is there someone that just gets you?  Every girl has special qualities.

hmsCFQocaa	Probably right on both counts. I find that if I rush to finish, I am usually stuck with something I felt could have been better.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Oh yeah, they say that we are our own worst critics. It can also be good for us. That will motivate us to hone our craft to the best it can be. One word of advise. Don't ask family for critique. To them we all sound good. Then when you send in your music to the real Songwriter Associations critcs, they tell you your music sucks. But this too can be used as constructive criticism.|`|6HyFHrfIaa	Oh, all the time. Depends like what the one girl said with your mood. Some days you may be MAD and write something so disturbing yet great, look back at it a couple of a days later when have cooled off and realized, "What the heck is this?!" Trust me, I also do this.<br>  <br>  I would suggest to avoid this problem is to write how you feel all the time whether it's happy or sad.|`|3Ve9bJwCaa	well, i don't know if this will help you- but a lot of writers tend to find faults in their own work even if said works are famous for being excellent - for example flaubert hated madame bovary which is a classic and was wildly popular in his time - he reasoned his hate came from the desire writers have to find the right word - they will never be fully satisfied unless it is completely perfect to the last punctuation<br>  personally, in my songs, i tend to dislike a majority of them after i look at them again, however, if i go back to songs i wrote a long time ago, i can easily find what's good and them and build off of it<br>  songs generally sound the worst if the lyrics are forced - my best songs are the more free flowing ones that i just burned through, however, some songs can be masterpieces if you put a lot of focus into the words and their meanings<br>  (p.s. sorry for lack of punctuation)|`|tPteqyWGaa	I have the same problem! Just remember, you're your own worst critic. If you feel comfortable with it, have other people listen to your songs and rate them. Make sure they're fellow musicains - if you use friends and family, they're likely to tell you it's great no matter what. Just keep writing music, good ideas come in time! : )|`|EL5ALn3faa	Yeah dis happens to me too. its because when you write a song you write it with the emotion and mood you feel at the time then when you look back at them your kind of like HOW COULD I HSVE EVER WRITTEN THAT? it dusnt really stink im sure...............................beliv... in yourself..........................x good luck.............x

30iqJREVaa	I love boot camp!<br>  <br>  But I love a challenge :)|`|GBSnBbWiaa	What have you gotten your self in2?<br>  My friend went and she said they killed her! And yes i mean literally! <br>  they do drug you and if you are caught drinking or smoking you have to do 1000 push ups and do a SO HARD opstical coarse! And if you don't do in 2 minutes, I can't tell you because it violates the rules but you need to do it!!|`|de7bf90bb2066bf0f7dc80a921ffc779aa	It's worth it, but you will have to give up the drugs.  And also you may get called up if they need you to fight in the war.|`|v1tHjJ3haa	Why wouldn't boot camp drug test ppl, you should stop doing drugs cause it you go it'll take time for your body to completly eliminate the drugs out and I think it's worth it it'll probably be a challenge but who doesn't like challenges and you'll probably be happy in the end, like muscles useing your head more -smarter- money and benefits, I would do it! :D|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Yes they test you! When going through boot camp, just like any military branch, they give you shots, exams,ask you personal questions. If you smoke a lot, you may not even pass the physical tests.|`|a68665ef6c4434c025138a75281114eeaa	if you are a wake n baker, it could take 3-4 months to be totally clean.<br>  <br>  its a federal thing! OF COURSE they are going to test you.<br>  <br>  sheesh!|`|AA11656632	Of course you get tested. Boot camp is very hard. Yes it's worth it.|`|Ucovfo2Xaa	Which is it...National Guard or Reserves?  They are two different entities.<br>  <br>  before you go, you'd have to pass a piss test and endure random piss tests while in the service.<br>  <br>  i was in the regular army for 6 years.  boot camp (actually called Basic Training) is tough and lasts eight weeks.  AFter that, you'll have to go to advanced training.  that can last from 5 weeks up to a year or more, depending upon the MOS (Military Occupation Skill..or job) you choose. <br>  <br>  Is $200/month worth it to you?  We can't tell you if it's worth it but if you're thinking of joining the national guard, you better quit smoking that crap now.|`|nooi0ldjaa	do it, it'll make you a better person.<br>  <br>  yes they drug test you.|`|5jqfKDdfaa	Youre gonna beg for that bong afterwards (is what my friend is telling me). <br>  <br>  Yes they test, but its worth it...good way to clean yourself up and start over|`|JZMfUDylaa	yes they drug test you and you lose freedom of smoking i wouldn't do it do something you like to do besides boot camp|`|G7OwyyHPaa	yeah it's worth it.|`|bYWTE40Vaa	And go work for the man? What kind of a stoner are you lol|`|AA10286634	have you considered a career as a sign spinner?|`|0fUUoTcTaa	I can only attest to Navy/Coast Guard basic training, but I don't think that it will be fundamentally different.  The actual training you will be going through will likely be more strenuous than the NTC.<br>  <br>  Unless they do a hair test now, you should pass the urinalysis with no problems if you abstain from substance abuse until then.  Afterward  you may be subject to random drug testing.<br>  <br>  Is it worth it?  That's going to be up to you and what you are used to.  Basic training will be physically and psychologically strenuous, but afterward (assuming you didn't do anything to get yourself into major trouble while there) you will likely look back on it as one of the most rewarding experiences of your life.<br>  <br>  Be prepared to be activated, though; even though we are wanting to pull troops out of Iraq, we are /sending/ troops to Afganistan.  So if you aren't prepared to serve your country and your president, then perhaps it will not be something you want to pursue.|`|15423591314a80b690eb6deb8aaebcb4aa	Do the Army or Airforce, they have the easiest bootcamps.  Yes they test, stop all drugs at least three months before bootcamp and shave your hair.  Bootcamps by difficulty easiest to hardest: Airforce, Army, Navy, Marines.  Also if you do a more difficult bootcamp, and go to an a branch with an easier one, you get to skip the easier bootcamp.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	For you  NO! Boot camp will bust your butt big time. You will get drug tested more then once.and you might get your tail sent to Iraq. Plus do you have any idea what is like to have a drill sargent scream in your face, and I do mean right up in your face?? They have a sane in the army during boot camp,"Pray your soul goes to heaven because your *** (Butt) belongs to them.|`|OCMSTxYfaa	don't think you will be doing any drugs in the national guard, and if you do, don't plan on being there too long. yes, you will be drug tested, and if you test positive...well...good luck to you.|`|AWSAnX3iaa	I don't defiantly know,but im sure something dealing with the government would require a drug test in the physical, i mean even high school kids are now getting random drug tests.|`|wKjFn7Nsaa	Im pretty sure they drug test you at boot camp. It sounds worth it, but is it worth giving up the best thing in the whole world?|`|0OUrijq5aa	come on nick you could just be a stoner and not join and go to iraq or afganistan|`|cSPxoFe6aa	it is not worth it and they do a urine test and its very very hard just like military school but harder|`|kRu5Z4vBaa	They'll drug test the piss out of you, no pun intended.<br>  <br>  It's not even worth it, haha.|`|G3tDNWQqaa	They will drug test you.|`|011sgO01aa	Well how bout you stop smoking? It's stupid, and you only get 1-2 hour high for money you could be using for snorting|`|iiRbOAQnaa	I don't think its worth a measly $200 a month....|`|bRfRXY3Paa	yes i know iam in it my self|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	sounds worth it|`|JRsUkDdQaa	no, go there|`|vX2O4v7haa	stoners get paid for doing jack all<br>  <br>  damn i love this country

Just try and do it like you do with the other one. I can do it but I can't really explain how to it just like does it.<br>  <br>  EDIT: and yeahh their speed is done with computers, they probably did it once and replayed it to music.|`|XVMxuADtaa	Hahahaha!<br>  <br>  You gave me the best laugh so far today :-)<br>  <br>  If you can do the eyebrow thing and work the balloon without computer effects you'll make a poo load of money!|`|AA11616170	Yes, I have seen the advert.

DMGvBceDaa	I think he's a very attractive guy, I like (LOVE) the character he plays, he seems very relate able to in real life, and he isn't like every celebrity. His ego is about as big as a pea, not as big as the universe.|`|v1tHjJ3haa	I understand what you mean and little 7, 8, 10, 13 year old shouldn't be watching it in the 1st place cause of their hormones kicking in getting ready to be teenager, casuse then they are in lala land and are in love with someone who doesn't exist ! only more mature ppl ashould watch who know reality n stuff :D  You made a really stright forward point ! Poor guy, ppl know ham as Robert Pattison, not Edward Cullen :(|`|kIh5iLBXaa	You took the words right out of my mouth. I loved Twilight, but I read it before it got so popular! When it came out in 2005! People are really pissing me off with him. And actually I don't think he is that appealing, he always looks stoned or drunk to me.. I think people need to grasp that Edward Cullen is a fictional character and he will NEVER BE REAL!|`|djuRlggeaa	I didnt bother to read that but... I LOVE Rob. But I dont' like him for Edward (eveen tho i love edward also). Rob is funny, shy, sexy, a good singer, great actor, and has the sexiest accent... i love him for that.|`|3a8e968728b8c9b42046c8b83c563c22aa	i know his not even cute<br>  <br>  he looks like a guy who was stumbled by a train track|`|GyFwkIbEaa	lol i dont know why poeple go crazy for him...<br>  no offence but he looks like he is gonna go bald in the front ofhis head in like ten years...<br>  Edward is the cute one... Robert is the not-so-good-looking one... lol<br>  i dont think taylor launter is cute either... i dont get it... the twilight series is good but i personally dont like robert or taylor.... <br>  ya i dont get why that girl asked him to bite him... i would have just been like oh hey there is robert pattison oh kewl i saw him and move on with my life lol but with the jonas brothers i would be like omg did i really just see them!!! but ya robert just reminds me of like a drunk or rapist or something lol no offence to anyone that likes him|`|7GwYY19Haa	i know! I feel the same! God, I even feel sorry for him, it must've been SO embarrasing for having the show named 'Edward Pattinson', and having all these screaming fangirls begging him to bite him,seriously...it's even like what happened to Daniel Radcliffe! Everyone recognized him as "the Harry Potter guy" I only learned it was actually daniel who played Harry Potter in like fifth grade or something...<br>  <br>  yeah, and just cause Robert is famous doesn't mean that he's extra special or something like that. If I saw him like at Starbucks I would be really surprised, but I wouldnt ask for an autograph or something like that. Probably just hide somewhere and take a picture of him without anybody knowing.. hehe. Though I find it funny of him cuz he always looks like he's either drunk,stoned, or something like a rapist haaha I find it kinda sexy-ish :]|`|EyAAFfaMaa	That took forever to read, haha. Well, I'm a fan of his but not the crazy delusional kind. If I saw him on the street, I'd probably walk over to him to say hi. He seems like a blast to hang out with though, I always crack up when I see him in interviews and he kinda also looks high all the time but that's not the point. I don't get it either. I mean, yeah he's gorgeous but I know people who are "fans" and by that I mean crazy,delusional people who have posters of him and t-shirts with his face on it, and yet they don't know the actor's name. They're all like "Edward is so hot" or "Edward was on z100", I always have to say "Edward is a book character, get over it." It sounds mean, but these people are delusional and would probably pounce on the poor guy if he was within a ten foot radius.

IK3d2EgZaa	My fav is "Gosselins Go Skiing",  Season 3, aired March 3, 2008 -episode 12.  Looked like a fun time out in Utah. At that time they were still allowing family to be shown on the show.  I'm not as big a fan of the show after the mid part of season 3.|`|Leda2ha0aa	I love the show where it was Mady's day with her parents and she got her ears pierced.  In fact, I love every episode where Mady has a fit because you see that it's not just your child that has off days.  I laugh every time she throws an attitude and have to applaud her parents because they remain calm and don't feed into it.  Makes you wonder how she will be as a teenager when she's so dramatic when she's 7.|`|YRJShhKraa	My favorite Jon and Kate Plus 8 episode was when Jon and Kate renewed their vows in Hawaii.

Sun + Moon (Amavasaya dosha in H5 of children), get its puja from some learned Brahmin.|`|FE96lTPLaa	Yes, it sometimes happens. It the same case in my family. A son of mine is Leo, the other is Virgo and the 3rd is Libra.<br>  I have found the Shani Yantra very effective in reducing the Sade Sati effects. Sade Sati does not affect every Leo or Virgo in the same way. It depends on placement of all planets in the birth chart.<br>  So get a Shani Yantra and worship it with 23000 Shani Mantra “Om praam preem praum Sa Shanae Namah” and keep the yantra with you.<br>  ShaniYantra can be prepared by drawing a 9 square figure and putting these numbers in it in black ink.<br>  12 7 14<br>  <br>  13 11 9<br>  <br>  8 15 10

UVnr7wrmaa	Well if you've got the books, and already know what happens in the movie, then maybe you shouldn't really buy the DVD.

I'm a HUGE fan of the books. I own each one in hardcover, I have posters on my wall and even on my ceiling. =] I already pre ordered my copy of the DVD.

I had the same exact problem. I know a way around it<br>  <br>  First: when you hit login and the technical glitch thing comes up just keep on hitting the refresh button a couple of times. The login in page should come up.<br>  <br>  Then: Type in all your info and hit Enter. Now this is where you have to have patience. A pop will say something about whether you want to cancel or retry. Press retry and then refresh the page. Keep doing that back and forth for a while. Then it should take your account<br>  <br>  Now... after that everything is basically continous. If you click on anything and the technical thing comes up just refresh the page a couple of times again and the page you want should come up<br>  <br>  YOU NEED TO HAVE PATIENCE AND DETERMINATION! Trust me..|`|6r2eDLs9aa	I've been trying for two days, and nothing has happened. They'd better be working on a massively incredible update, because the log-in problem is absolutely ridiculous.

84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	You are curious, instinctive, intuitive, perceptive and maybe even psychic. You mostly trust your impressions of people and rightly so, you have a considerable intellect and judgment abilities. You are a natural leader. This Astrology combinations nervous energy and sensitivity are both tremendous and need constructive outlets or you will probably burn out early in life.<br>  <br>              You are very social and like sharing ideas and emotions in a group context, instinctively knowing it's a rewarding and a cathartic process for all those involved. You have many ideas about reforming society but both need compatriots and supporters in that quest. You understand the universal framework [mathematics] behind ideas, goals, and the needs of the people and society.<br>  <br>              Information is a commodity that you find very interesting, a career could be dealing with and maybe selling it. As the "Information Society" evolves and progresses you could become a major influence if you play your cards right or if your don't get bored first. You also make a good detective or researcher because of that innate curiosity.<br>  <br>              Lots of short distance travel is natural to you. You enjoy day or weekend trips to nature or resorts equally well but your all time favorite place is probably home and near food and the kitchen.<br>  <br>              In love and relationships you are affectionate, communicative, sensitive and romantic. You need companionship and responsible feedback. It might be a smart idea to get attached to a good person early in life. Relationship training is a good idea.<br>  <br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  3-2 Gemini/Taurus<br>  The combination of your Sun sign and your Moon sign produces one of the most popular personalities in the zodiac. You have the cleverness that attracts friends and a stability that retains them. Both signs are sociable and outgoing, and there is something likable about your easygoing, cool headed intellect that people relate to automatically. Intellectually you are impressive, having practical wisdom to back your broad expansive plans. A natural conversationalist, you are loaded with interesting tidbits of information to share. It is surprising that you can have such a driving personality, able to move mountain in record time under a highly social and charming cover. Your intelligence is unassuming and your driving force of your personality is not readily evident. This lack of pretentiousness makes it even more surprising when you reveal your accomplishment. Your judgment and business sense are inevitably sound and accurate. Your fluent mental ability is underscored by a determination to see any task through to its conclusion, a trait most Gemini fail to possess. Highly understanding of a broad cross section of people, you are rarely fooled or taken in. You are too smart for most people with whom you come into contest, but you won't hurt their feelings by letting them know they have a lot to learn. Your sense for sociability extends to all.|`|1QKYkISEaa	refer www.astrolife.com

Those poor kids are blissful in their ignorance but how will that help them to survive in the outside world? At least the Amish send their kids away when they're of a certain age and let them choose the 'real' world or to return to Amish life.

8OOoECZxaa	She asks either tribe "Which road would the other tribe tell me to take,to get to the castle?"<br>  <br>  If she asks the "lying" tribe,they will point to the road where the dragon is.<br>  If she asks the "truth" tribe,they would also point to the road where the dragon is.<br>  <br>  So either way, she picks the opposite road of where they are pointing!!!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|79b2yM3saa	have her ask<br>  Did I already ask my question?<br>  and when the tribe says yes they are the liars. If no then she can ask what way to go??|`|zZ0gU40Kaa	Which road would the other tribe say, If I asked them which road would lead to the castle. (You then take the road that the tribe does NOT point to.) ----This question may confuse your teacher. :D|`|ATKZ39Ceaa	she should ask " what path would the other tribe make me go" and go to the opposite path. if she asked the liars, they would tell her to go to the dragon path. if she asked the truth telling tribe, they will tell her to go to the dragon because that is what the liars would say.|`|jN9qXQz6aa	ask each tribe this question:<br>  <br>  "What path will the other tribe tell me to take?"<br>  <br>  the truthful tribe will point out the wrong path and since the untruthful tribe HAS to lie it will point out the wrong path as well which will tell you to take the path that neither tribe points out.|`|AA10619470	the most common solution to the above scenario is to ask one of the tribes "If I asked you if the path you're guarding leads to where I'm going, would you say yes?"; if he says yes, then you godown his path, while you go down the other path if he says no. This is because, with the way the question is presented, he has to give a truthful answer no matter what: say he says "yes" to the question. If he's telling the truth, then he would say that the path leads to where you're going, and thus, the path will lead to where you're going; if he's lying, then he'll have to lie about whether or not he'd say "yes" to the question (which, in this case, he would not say yes if asked if the path lead to where you're going, and would in fact say no) and, thus, is forced to give the correct answer to where the path goes. <br>  <br>  The second most common solution is to ask either of the tribes "If I had asked the other tribe which path was the correct path, which path would he have pointed to?" If you're talking to the tribe that tells the truth, they will (truthfully) indicate the door that the other tribe would have steered you towards — which would be the wrong door, as the other tribe always lies. But if you're talking to the tribe that always lies, then he would still point to the wrong door, as while the other guard (the truth-teller) would have indicated the correct door, the tribe you're speaking to is lying to you about what he would have said! So either way, the answer to your question will be the wrong path — and so, either way, you simply use the other path. <br>  <br>  Do note that one of the keys to this puzzle being a puzzle is that you have to get a piece of information out of these two guards, rather than just determine which one is lying. That's what prevents you from simply asking them what 2+2 is. Some works can forget this, and make the hero look like something of an idiot for going for needless complexity.

I understand she took to drinking right after we split up those many years ago, and I hear she hasn't been sober since."<br>  <br>  "My God!" says my wife. "Who would think a person could go on celebrating that long?"<br>  <br>  And that's when the fight started....<br>  <br>  -<br>  <br>  After retiring, I went to the Social Security office to apply for Social<br>  Security. <br>  <br>  The woman behind the counter asked me for my driver's license to verify<br>  my age. <br>  <br>  I looked in my pockets and realized I had left my wallet at home. <br>  <br>  I told the woman that I was very sorry, but I would have to go home<br>  and come back later. <br>  <br>  The woman said, 'Unbutton your shirt'. <br>  <br>  So I opened my shirt revealing my curly silver hair. <br>  <br>  She said, 'That silver hair on your chest is proof enough for me' and she<br>  processed my Social Security application. <br>  <br>  When I got home, I excitedly told my wife about my experience at the<br>  Social Security office. <br>  <br>  She said, 'You should have dropped your pants. You might have gotten<br>  disability, too' <br>  <br>  And then the fight started...<br>  <br>  -<br>  <br>  I rear-ended a car this morning. <br>  <br>  So, there we were alongside the road and slowly the other driver got out of<br>  his car. <br>  <br>  You know how sometimes you just get soooo stressed and little things just<br>  seem funny? <br>  <br>  Yeah, well I couldn't believe it.... he was a DWARF!!! <br>  <br>  He stormed over to my car, looked up at me, and shouted, 'I AM NOT <br>  HAPPY!!!' <br>  <br>  So, I looked down at him and said, 'Well, then which one are you?' <br>  <br>  And that's how the fight started..... <br>  <br>  -<br>  <br>  A man and a woman were asleep like two innocent babies. Suddenly, at 3 o'clock in the morning, a loud noise came from outside. The woman, sort of bewildered, jumped up from the bed and yelled at the man, "Holy Crap! That must be my husband!"<br>  <br>  So the guy quickly jumped out of the bed, scared and naked he jumped out the window like a crazy man. He smashed himself on the ground, ran through a thorn bush and then started to run as fast as he could to his car.<br>  <br>  A few minutes later he returned and went up to the bedroom and screamed at the woman, "I AM your husband!"<br>  <br>  The woman yelled back, "Yeah, well then, why were you running?"<br>  <br>  And that's when the fight started...

He then joined the National Youth Theatre, spending two seasons there and earning a scholarship to train at the (British American Drama Academy).

If its all girls get those jewels you put on cell phones, plain stud earrings or hoops, Mardi Gras beads, sunglasses, (they have good deals at like Charlotte Russe: 3 for $5 or something), colored pens, necklaces, bracelets, candy, etc.  If its both, get general things like iTunes gift cards (my friend had a party once and all the favors had $5 iTunes cards.  I don't know if they still sell those though), candy, little perfume and cologne samples, pens, lei's, if you know skater guys get those stickers to put on their boards, tiny picture frames, keychains, you could get the tiny axe bottles, these links have some cute stuff:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pwponline.com/favor-savors-birthday-party-favors11.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pwponline.com/favor-savors-bi...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.party411.com/custom-invitations-teen.html#sweet16" rel="nofollow">http://www.party411.com/custom-invitatio...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.beau-coup.com/birthday-party-favors.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.beau-coup.com/birthday-party-...</a><br>  <br>  Those looked pretty cool.

ajEnp6cAaa	With all the splash of the Carmen Aria in my opinion you need something from Cosi by Mozart. I don't remember the Italian title but it is sung in English a lot, it is about speaking to lovely women.  I would suggest Ombra mai Fu in the Baritone Key. That would give 3 dynamite songs from the Baroque, classical and romantic periods.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|aSTmFCiBaa	germont,libbiammo...la traviata|`|CrAwmz65aa	How about the elder Germont's aria from La Traviata:<br>  "Il Provenzia, il mar, il suol."|`|ThKkn5fKaa	Although I agree with the italian on some aspects, I will point out that most people living in America have absolutely no idea how to produce " è " without copying and pasting.  And if we left opera up only to those who "respect it", then it would die off pretty quickly.  One of the best ways to learn to respect opera is to learn it by performing it.  There's no reason to act all high brow.  Before studying opera, my knowledge of vocal music consisted only of the orchestral and sacred variety.  I gained an appreciation for opera by studying it.  Who are we to deny the asker the chance to learn more about opera?<br>  <br>  As per the question, what is your range?  Baritones, in particular can range all over and have very different sounding voices.  I'd offer up some of the rep that I've done, but range is a big factor.  I don't want to give you any music with high G's if it's out of your range for example.<br>  <br>  Also, how long have you studied and how old are you, so as to give us an idea of your voice and skill.  You can't just dive into Puccini and Donizetti before you've worked on your 24 Italian Songs and Arias.|`|hpgXPKIbaa	Try some German Lieder (art song, usually voice with piano Accompaniment).  Schubert and Schumman wrote some good ones for Baritones, particularly "Erlkoning" which is really cool and creepy.

ce83aaa18b48dd89e8f2ce5b7f9d7885aa	That is the way I have always played it. It is the easiest for me to play and to change to and from quickly. Practice it a lot. You can play it and let the E ring open. I do it all the time.|`|5ZqCJFoBaa	Try using your pinky, middle and the other finger to do it. Ive tried barring but your right, you cant get the open e sound with it. Try the way i told you and if it doesnt work, get smaller fingers :P<br>  <br>  Happy playing,<br>  John|`|2k8TEiRtaa	It takes getting used to. Playing it with the index finger flat on the last 4 strings on the second fret is just as good as playing it with the index middle and ring finger on the same fret. Except that the 1st or little string is not left open.<br>  Using it on the fifth fret with your index finger covering all the six strings, middle finger sixth fret, and ring and pinky on the seventh fret is a bit harder. but that's how it's always been done. Pratice makes perfect.|`|1KHUtZ94aa	the one that buzzes is not correct.<br>  <br>  You will want a strong index to make bar chords. Bar Chords will look like the open chords but elsewhere on the neck. <br>  <br>  So if your teacher is telling you to make the A with the ring finger that might be to prepare you for the bar chords. <br>  <br>  You will need to make a portable "A" using your index finger as the new neck and your ring finger or pinky forming the A. But when you slide it up a fret it becomes Asharp or B flat major. then one more fret then its a B major...and so on<br>  <br>  Good luck and happy playing|`|9Lk8iHFZaa	i understand your difficulty as i have attempted to play guitar aswell!!!!! i was always told that it doesnt matter which figuring you use aslong as it feels the most natural and comfortable for you- i also bar with my index!!!!!!!!! you dont need to let the 1st string to sound to make the chord sound right.|`|02hspQaBaa	i play it with my two middle fingers in between the three strings<br>  it takes a little practice but it enables you to use you other fingers for something else|`|vzsnyIsqaa	Well, you can bar it, but it takes practice to be able to keep the high E string vibrating freely. There is also a little trick you can pull. If you are not familiar with the "caged" system for guitar, email me at benjaminlbryce@yahoo.com, and I will see if I can't hook you up with some more info. But, back to your question. When you make your bar at the second fret, use your pinkie-finger to hold down the E and B strings at the fifth fret. Both of those notes belong in the A chord (they are the 3rd and 5th notes in the triad), and I play this version of the chord quite a bit. I hope that helps.<br>  <br>  here is a diagram - the numbers represent frets.<br>  <br>  e- 0<br>  a- 0<br>  d- 2<br>  g- 2<br>  b- 5<br>  e- 5

087668cd7a5ba290ec84fbbb0fd621eeaa	I interpret the song as a boy and girl fall in love. it goes well for a while, but the guy's destructive behaviour makes him decide to break up with this girl. hence "i still love you girl but i'm not the answer to your questions" meaning she deserves better. Meanwhile, she says " i want to save you" meaning she wants to save him from himself, for example his alcohol/suicidal/going nowhere in life/or combination of all.

I also hope that they come up with something more creative than a long-lost twin.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I read that she will have memories of Emily because she is Emily. That Helena drugged her and when Diego strangled her, she wasn't really dead that is when she passed out! Helena has had her hidden all this time to get back at Nikolas.|`|M1ymLE9Paa	If it's true, then I think that's great!  =)  Can you post a link to the spoiler site you found it on?  I had heard over and over again that Natalia did not want to play Emily anymore, and one of the reasons she came back was b/c she was being offered a chance to play a completely different character.  But I've been hoping that in the end she does turn out to be Emily so if that's true, that would be so cool!  =)  Thanks for sharing.|`|AA12315431	I read the memory thing as well. If she isn't Emily or her sister why would she have her memories? Something is definitely fishy about that. I also hope it is somehting more creative than a twin or Emily just being kidnapped and brainwashed. I think Emily is going to stay dead and Rebecca starts liking Lucky which will really be awkward for Elizabeth I am sure.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I heard Helen brainwashed Emily and gave her a new life as Rebecca.|`|8xdcBKfUaa	Yes, I've read the same spoiler as Jen. The drug had a nasty effect on her, thus the rude behavior. She was sweating the whole time at Wyndemere today when Nikolas was relaying their love story, and she totally flipped out at the picture. In a way I hope that Rebecca is just a coincidence, not even a sister. Just an average, random person. But in a completely different way, I hope that she is Emily, or at least a sister. I just hope that this doesn't take a turn for the worse as Dallas did. What if the last few months have just been a dream of Nikolas? That's super unlikely, I'm just throwing that out there. But I say that more than likely, Jen's correct, and out long lost Emily is really Rebecca.|`|BtIm6Txxaa	Back when Emily was killed, I posted about Emily being kidnapped by Helena.  Everyone said that wasn't going to happen, but I am still holding out that maybe Helena kidnapped her, drugged her, etc. and Rebecca is really Emily.  I just think it's pretty pathetic for the writers to bring her back as someone else.  I felt that way about the actress playing Claudia, who used to play Carly.  Are we supposed to be that stupid or naive...a little haircut, hair color change, and poof...it's a new character?  Sorry, that's a little off tangent, but it bothers me when they do this.|`|tgVGE2Umaa	The way she looked at Nikolas today it is obvious that she knows 'something' about Emily and her mother. My guess would be a twin sister with a psychic connection or something completely soap crazy like that, lol.|`|EhBF31evaa	She will probably turn out to be Emily.  I have been thinking for a while that it is about time for Helena to cause some trouble.  She has been quiet for way too long!|`|AA10583675	Then why the sam hill did they kill the girl off the first time.  Rebecca having memories of Emily.|`|sGLRpQWvaa	ohh. I can't wait to see what happens. I like Rebecca better because she has a bit of an edge. Emily was boring.
Um8osMNuaa	She helped them locate the bomb, and then she detonated it, but doing so meant that it blew her up. l think she realised what a cow she'd been and it was her way to make amends.<br>  Although in order to get information Harry had to trade himself, so he was carted off at the end, now we have to wait until the next series to find out where he is and how they get him back, which obviously they will.

q4XUy0Duaa	Q1- I actually feel like there's more haters today than there were back in the day because the quality of the music back then was better, and there was less to hate.  Since there was no youtube back then, it was also harder to get your opinion across to so many people.  I think there are more artists that hate on each other today because they realize that fake beef=record sales, and they're usually both garbage which is actually the funny part.  I wish the one's who do suck could be weeded out and quit, but there's a large fanbase for garbage so they won't quit as long as they're making money.  If you look at the beef between Nelly and KRS One, or Canibus and LL Cool J, you'd think most people would have recognized that Nelly and LL were wack, but instead, it was pretty even, which was a good indicator of where rap was headed.<br>  <br>  Q2- I think it's usually out of respect for the artist's past accomplishments.|`|haxPqmIgaa	Q1: your damrite... i noticed that! Imma name names right now:<br>  FU*KKKKKK!:<br>  Lil Wayne<br>  Soulja Boy<br>  plies<br>  ----Jay-z borderline----<br>  Fu*k politacally corecct. We should have freedom of speech and be able to do and say whatever the hel we waant!!<br>  Q2: no. i think its respect, unless there totally whack, then you loose most respect and its a combonation.|`|7gH7sgi6aa	First....so glad to see you back!!!<br>  Q1:  I totally agree that artists are not called out for their back work and are allowed to be called "superstars" when their work is "whack" and even they know it.  The same goes for some of the emcee's and producers of today.  A lot of the younger generation is making computer music, not really "creating" beats, hardly writing their own rhymes and cannot rap to save their own Mother.  YET...they continue to sell millions of downloads and albums due to creative marketing schemes and "dances".  It is a new generation and a new "way" for music, but these kids will grow up and realize the CRAP they are listening to and will grow out of it.<br>  <br>  Q2:  Another point I totally agree on.  I am so glad to see a lot of the ol' skool legends coming back and doing some concerts and stuff to show the "newbies" what hip hop what really about and bring the focus of RHH back to what it really was.  BUT..some of the people are putting out albums...LL Cool J for one puts out sub-standard albums that just don't cut the mustard and tarnish the work he's been famous for.  I think some artists are still live like Mos Def, he;s still got it going on, and I think KRS-One is still a positive force in RHH.  But Big Daddy Kane cannot put on two hour shows anymore.  I saw him personally and the first 30 minutes were live, but it was nosedive after that.  Let a legend be a legend and be known for what they DID do.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|MAkEKCUfaa	Q1: I think the whole "beef" mentality has been abused lately as a way to sell records.  No one ever really cares about the opinions of the individuals, they just want to hear about the drama.   In addition, I think there is a disconnect between people's opinions based on what is "Hot" because it has come to mean two different things.  To some people it means how many records did it sell (voiding any merit to the lyrics, how the beat was composed, overall sound, quality, etc.).  Others, like myself, rely more heavily on a ear for greatness (regardless of if the artists sold 5 mil. records or only put out a 500-copy vinyl-only 12'').  It's a matter of what you like.  I personally can't follow the sheep in the pasture any longer...the grass in greener by my damn self now.<br>  <br>  Q2: I hate when legends fall off or sell-out.  It's a disappointment, I think that's why people don't like to talk about it.  It's like Jordan playing baseball, it's just not needed.  Let us remember you at the high-water mark.|`|VclnZhSCaa	Q1: I hadn't noticed that trend. People still call people out quite a bit, actually. Even if there is a bit of reluctance to name names, I doubt PC or the pursuit of PC is the cause.<br>  <br>  Q2: Nostalgia. KRS1 thrives off of it.|`|hwKFm7H8aa	1- Hip hop as it was known in the 90's that street cred hiphop disappear and it moved to suburbs to where rich kids live...no respect<br>  2-  Once you are a Legend you cannot "fall off" sure your albums might loose quality but you still got that stuff from the past holding you. Legends are to be respected..this is why hip hop is what it is today... Legends are not being respected...and you got lil wayne and soulja boy;'s fans calling legends " old ******" or "that old ****"<br>  or " who the **** cares about that ****"<br>  <br>  you loose respect...you loose hip hop|`|wfZhkZO0aa	Q1:  Political Correct attitudes are causing problems in every genre and venue of life.

dprURFLxaa	"After surviving breast cancer through aggressive treatments including a double mastectomy and radiation therapy, she became a spokeswoman for the medical center in Nashville where she had been treated and somewhat for cancer survivors in general. She took on this role as herself, Sarah Ophelia Cannon, not desiring the "Minnie Pearl" character to be associated with such misfortune, although a nonprofit group, the Minnie Pearl Cancer Foundation, has been founded in her memory to help fund cancer research. The center where she was treated was later named the Sarah Cannon Cancer Center, and has been expanded to several other hospitals in Middle Tennessee and southern Kentucky. Her name has also been lent to the affiliated Sarah Cannon Research Institute.<br>  <br>  Cannon's performing career was ended by a serious stroke in June 1991.[1] After the stroke she resided in a Nashville nursing home where she received frequent visits from country music industry figures, including Chely Wright, Vince Gill and Amy Grant. Her death on March 4, 1996, at the age of 83, was attributed to complications from a stroke. She is buried at Mt.

1y5IxCVyaa	The idea of time travel is like a set of chinese finger cuffs; the more you struggle with it the worse it gets<br>  <br>  Personally I think that although Donnie went back in time to change the course of events so that it never happened, the idea of alternate dimensions, which allows for time travel and paradoxes mean that somewhere his girlfriend and mother did meet. This half recognition that they share could be an echo of that. <br>  <br>  Also don't forget that these are two people who deeply loved Donnie, so they must have qualities in common, and so it could be a recognition of that.<br>  <br>  Its a great film and one I think intentionally keeps the answers vague|`|EilAm0Dkaa	The director deliberately meant it to be like this.<br>  There was never an answer to it.<br>  He said he wanted a film that people would go mad over, meaning they would remember it for a long time.<br>  You can try and try to come to a conclusion, but it will never work, because you'll find ever conclusion is completely bizarre!!<br>  <br>  Amazingg film though :)|`|OIS808Qmaa	It insinuates that more than one dimension or world can exist at the same time (hence the hole that the plane went thorugh).  Even though they never met in that dimension, they are still connected somehow.  It's a loose idea, open to a lot of interpretation.|`|0e8mlXveaa	I watched it 4 times and each time thought something different had happened. Seeing it with friends doesn't help either. If there is a director's commentary on the disc I may try watching it with that on to see if it helps.|`|AA10175631	I think the wave was a gesture of sympathy. The mom was quietly devastated by the death of her son and all the girl could do to express some sort of sympathy was to give a sad wave hello. I mean, what else could the child do? She didn't really know the mother and she didn't want to (and probably couldn't) just walk up and say something to her. As to why the mom waved back, I think she understood the gesture and simply replied back. Both women knew Donnie. Both had an important relationship with him. And with a simple wave, they both acknowledged their grief and sadness about his loss.|`|4bc7b70eda9643e233469e2d9bca1f54aa	the point of the ending is to let you make you own mind up about what the whole film is all about. it leaves it up to you instead of telling you exactly what is going on like just about every other film there is.<br>  <br>  so make your own mind up instead of sitting and getting annoyed about it!! lol|`|6da136429953fa0aaf7405c93b94bdb5aa	Fugett-about-it !<br>  No wait, that was Donnie Brasco.|`|TMejdd08aa	yea..it creeeeeeeeeeeeeeeps me out. big time.|`|b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	Donnie Darko and Frank are both capable of impossible things but they never say exactly what they both are since it's obvious they aren't normal humans. Donnie had to die so that the Earth wouldn't end, things were just fated that way, there is no direct explanation. Towards the end of the movie did you see those dark, mysterious funnel clouds? The earth was going to end or Donny was going to die at that exact point, because of the weird weather phenomena Donnie was able to break the jet engine off the plane with his telekinesis and it fell into a wormhole of sorts which allowed it to be in the exact same spot but go back in time about a month killing Donnie before the events of the movie take place. So everything you saw never really happened except for the first few minutes basically in the real timeline, the events of the movie were taking place in the real timeline but it became an alternate timeline when the jet engine went back in time killing Donnie before the events of the movie. This is why he asked his professor about time travel after he read that book, and the teacher told him of the wormhole phenomenon "using a metal craft." Donnie used his powers to kill himself so that the Earth could keep living becoming a Jesus like figure. Many fans miss this entirely but I've examined the movie its all there, that weird guy in the bright jumpsuit was an FAA agent watching Donnie.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, they recognized each other slightly because they had met in the alternate/real timeline I believe but it could have been a pure gesture of sympathy. The movie events had to have taken place, but they also never could have so it's a paradox with no answer. This is why I don't believe in time travel in to the past, too many paradoxes, if you sneezed then you would effect the Earth in such a way that your transport vessel would have never been built and yet you are there or are you? Maybe you would alter the timeline is such a way that your own self ceases to exist.|`|QMYNDtHgaa	Yes that was a great though provoking film.  It's a bit over the top in bizarreness and I don't think the director himself was quite sure of what was going on in the end, which was the point.  Someone earlier sad Mad ending which is very fitting for the Tune Mad world which is playing.  You can take a lot away from the movie weather it be thought provoking feelings or I can't believe I just saw this piece of crap feelings.  It invokes emotion and that is the point.

Viola Davis' performance was much more oscar worthy. I agree with you, Hugh Jackman was perfection! And rest of the winners deserved Oscars they won except for Penelope. I'm not saying that she is a bad actress but shouting, smoking and looking sexy was all she ever did in that movie and that was not an Oscar worthy performance.|`|772c599fdea7d81b38d09306a6450d3eaa	NO ///// BUT YOU SEEM TOO HAVE THE DIRECT SUM  OF THOUGHTFULNESS!|`|NZ044KkJaa	some of it.

jD6TJgYdaa	I think that when he said that he meant that they would be there for the fans when they need help. He also meant that because they do care for the fans that the fans will care for them in return. For example when Joe fell at the AMA's the fans didn't make him feel bad they were really worried for his well being. Just like the fans worry about Nick's well being with his diabetes. <br>  They are really thankful for the fans because without us they wouldn't be able to do what they do and live their dreams everyday.|`|oNlLKAWFaa	I think it just meant that fans of the Jonas Brothers will always stick by them, and won't leave them hanging. They just want their fans to always be there.|`|39wcLSoPaa	the jonas brothers suck whoever likes them doesn;t know good talent-they're gay|`|mDzIvOjCaa	He means "favor" of the sexual kind. That is if the fans keep them giving them money for not doing ****.|`|k39bNUgeaa	Yeah some people do know what good talent is<br>  <br>  It's clearly not you fans|`|duN63EkIaa	He meant that since they do so much for us, that we'll do the same for them. That since they are always there for us, that we'll be there for them. I loved him for saying that.

His name is PAT METHENY. ----- <br>  Beside this there was (!) a modern jazz piano trio from sweden, that made a new thing in modern jazz piano trio music. They improvised a lot, but needed good melodies to do so. I never had heard such dynamics in music, so thrilling compositions between calm and power jazz. That was the ESBJ?RN SVENSSON TRIO. Unfortunately Esbj?rn died last summer. Maybe you will gave this great music a try.

OIqNq4tYaa	Yeah.  It starts out for my feeling like I have spent a day at the amusement park, where you kinda feel like you are still moving when standing still.  Then for me it progressively gets worse as the week goes on. In the morning, I am fine.  But throughout the day it can get really bad where I feel like I am going to throw up because I am that dizzy.  I usually get vertigo after flying, or after a bad ear infection.  There is over the counter meclizine, which is the same active ingredient in antivery which is commonly prescribed for vertigo.  The over the counter brand is bonine and can be found by the motion sickness meds, not dramamine though.  It can cause some drowsiness but not too bad.  Sometimes I get occassional vertigo from an elevator, but that doesnt last.  Flying seems to set vertigo off the worst.|`|thcr8Y5vaa	No I haven't...|`|BBVfRheyaa	Yes, occasionally.|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	Yes.

dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	I still purchase them both retail and online because until the day comes that the record companies do away with all of the protections and crap I still want my discs.<br>  <br>  When itunes and Microsoft will create interchangeable files then maybe I would download. I grew  up making compilations from cassette to cassette and no one cared... I still enjoy making compilations  and while .99 may seem cheap for a song I am not interested in only being able to burn it 5 times or to have to listen to it on an ipod or something like that.<br>  <br>  My CD's stay in the house and I make copies of what I want for my car or anything else... That way my actual discs stay clean and unscratched.... Of course I am that weird guy that still has LP records and a turn table too! Vinyl is coming back in a big way in case no one has been noticing. <br>  <br>  So when we get to a place and time where you can download without restrictions... I may be in... But I still like album covers, liner notes, and to hold them in my hands when I listen to them..<br>  <br>  The Red and Green Atlantic labels... The Elektra "Butterfly" logo.... I don't want to let that go... "In the Court of the Crimson King", "Houses of the Holy", those covers would never be if someone was told to only consider a jewel case canvas that is 4.6 inches square.<br>  <br>  Yep... I am old.|`|OTFzJbaMaa	well yah im usually one to download them because of everything thats been goin on with me latley however yesterday i changed my ways and baught face lift an alice in chains cd. their my favorite band and i wanna support them as much as possible. <br>  i will continue to do that with my favorite bands, if i only like 1-2 songs from a band or artist i see no point inb buying the whole album.<br>  and i dont have itunes.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Yes, because owning music for me is more about hearing the waveforms. It's about holding something tangible in your hands, reading the insert, appreciating the cover art. All of that is becoming lost in the digital age.<br>  <br>  Plus, I'm fussy about how my music sounds. If I really like a piece of music, I don't want an MP3. I want the full, lossless file.<br>  <br>  And by "download all the songs online," I hope you mean buying them at places like iTunes, and not stealing them. If people keep taking music without paying for it, the musicians aren't going to make any money, and they won't be able to *keep* making music. It's only fair to pay artists for the fruits of their labor. Some people act like they're entitled to all the music they want for free, but put yourself in the artist's shoes. Would you want to get paid if you were a musician, if making music was how you made your living? They don't make music so you can steal it from them. They deserve to have bread on their tables, too.|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	Sometimes I download online but I like buying an album WAY more cause there is just a great feeling I have to have that cd and not just on my computer and ipod. It just gives a different, better, feeling.|`|AaXl3vcCaa	ys if it is a good cd that i know i will listen to the whole thing i will buy it, if there is just a song or two i like then i will download them|`|5uvTte8Zaa	I still like to bring home the album, open it, look at the liner notes while I listen to the album in it's entirety.<br>  <br>  It's part of the novelty.|`|B20aEPkqaa	I do all the time, its nice to have something to hold in my hand and i like reading the lyrics or notes in the booklets|`|py7iFq0Vaa	i still buy CDs, its half the fun of it!! its a shame zavvi closed down..<br>  i love having the album art and stuff...|`|9KYSkEwRaa	Yeah, I do, even though I put the songs off the CD on my ipod and just listen to it on my ipod. I dunno why I do it, I guess I jut like to have the CD's of the bands I like. And I like reading the things inside the CD case (dunno what they are called). Besides, the computer could totally crash or my ipod could break or something, but then I will have the CD =)|`|nHWmDirFaa	I do it to support the 'underground' ones. Immortal technique, DL incognito, Jedi Mind tricks, Ill Bill. I download and listen to some of their songs, and if I like them, I'll go buy the album (I see downloading as my own personal all request radio station ) Those rappers will never go Platinum or become rich and famous, so I think it's more important to support them.<br>  <br>  Whereas with 50 Cent, Lil wayne, Kanye West, They don't really need my support because they sell tons of copies even with downloading.<br>  <br>  Plus in a few occassions (with Ill bill's cd) they come with extras and dvds. Which admitedly can be downloaded too, but it's only a few bucks here and there.|`|Sih0xHJgaa	Yeah because it's nice to support the artist(s) and I like the idea of actually owning the physical record/cd. And another thing is that half the time I can't find the songs online to download them anyway and it's hard to find stuff through bit torrent and it slows down the internet a **** load so that's annoying. I just bought 5 cds today haha :D|`|DwsHXG30aa	Yeah!!! I do... I just put myself in the situation of the artist. If i were pouring my heart and soul into something I would want people to pay the full value, even though they may not like to whole thing. Think about it, if you are at a store and there is a package of various cookies and you dont like a particular kind, you sure as hell wouldnt go to the cash register and offer them .99 for something that would normally cost $1.50<br>  just a thought.|`|0euOXngXaa	Yes!<br>  I love going to the store and buying albums from my favorite bands. It's half the fun of it; listening to an album for the first time in its entirety and reading along to the liners. Also whenever I go to shows I usually bring the band or bands CD's for them to sign. I have a whole collection of albums that are signed by the members of the band, its awesome.|`|bl7ZzF9saa	I still buy from bands who i think deserve it...Offspring, Bad Religion, Third Eye Blind, theres a couple more...but usually i find myself saying why should i give you money if you really only have ONE good song? ya know?|`|f1ni8mvraa	I still buy them if I get them on Amazon for cheaper than $9.99 (what it costs to download an album on iTunes).  Usually I can get the CD for a lot cheaper, so there is no reason to download it.|`|NfB9kpFraa	I stay in India and i don't get all the rock albums i need over here, so unfortunately i have to download them, but i would buy all if i get them here.|`|8ff1af21b9165832d739515702f5f7b4aa	i do both<br>  <br>  i like having the cd's because i have like old ones from when i was really little adn i look back and remeber them<br>  <br>  i thinks it's fun<br>  i have a big collection of them.<br>  baha!|`|WkmC9TNKaa	yes cause if my laptop ever dies i can still have all the songs on cd<br>  <br>  and i take cds in my car <br>  <br>  and sometimes the cds are cheaper in shops than on itunes<br>  <br>  but i download some songs online :)|`|x5ftqjo5aa	Alot of the rarer bands and songs arent on limewire and defintitley not itunes, so i go to CD warehouses for those.|`|Ml22a6evaa	I still go To Cd store,used to sell albums,cassettes,eight-tracks.The excitement of touching the item you purchase nothing else will touch it<br>  I am old also|`|f8ed328242d905d1e234676aa09ce11faa	i do.  i like having all the album art and liner notes.  And besides, i don't own an i-pod or mp3 player or anything like that.|`|vK9Vv9gjaa	yes got to support my favorite bands, Its not fair for them to do all that hard work just so someone download it for free!|`|tlj3c50Haa	Yes.<br>  Because I like supporting the artists, and I like having physical collections of things (instead of buying the songs on itunes or something). I'm interested in graphic design, too, so artwork comes into it a little.|`|MwiBGBK1aa	All the time, I never digitally download for the purpose of burning the music and not buying it...|`|5HvdcWvBaa	WHAT???!! HMV is closing down??!! Oh ****!! Where am I gonna get my cds from now...??! :(<br>  <br>  Yeah, I do buy cds!! If you hadn't already guessed!! I never download actually, and thats the truth. I guess I'm just a little bit retro, I love having the cd case and the little booklet and... awwww... :)<br>  <br>  Plus I think its really important to support the bands, you know?<br>  <br>  Yup, I love cds and I'm not afraid to admit it!!!!!! Hehe!! XD|`|sC09VfIsaa	yep all the time i think the sound quality is better, and i like the liner notes too<br>  <br>  btw whoever said hmv is closing down is seriously misinformed, they bought 5 zavvi stores this year to take over, doesn't sound like something a dying business would do to me|`|vqqxD6Teaa	If I preview a cd and I like it then I will buy it. I like to support the artist. If there music means that much to me then why shouldn't I pay them for it, ya know?!|`|M3CsxF2jaa	I DO BOTH TOO
ubf26k2Oaa	He is a taurean and ' blows hot and cold'! I love him to bits, but he is a bit stand-offish, scared of commitment, etc<br>  Very loving, caring, gives loads of compliments. Generous with money, not with his time! <br>  Very talented at the arts, especially writing and music. Has a very active and vivid imagination. Good looking, loaded with charm and charisma.|`|HSrDRu4Raa	well im a taurus and other taurus girls think they are the **** when they really arent and the guys sometimes try to take control and sometimes they are nice|`|DLAkIHsDaa	I am taurus|`|ykIleAQ7aa	I'm a Cancer Taurus tend to make really good friends for Cancer. <br>  Anyway - I have more experiences w/ Taurus women than Taurus men. In fact I think I only know 2 Taurus men. <br>  My grandmother was a Taurus and she was mean (I think its a May Taurus thing more so than an April) anyway she had a nasty side to her don't get me wrong sometimes she could be very pleasant to be around. But my grandmother was the youngest and prettiest so she was kind of stuck up. And she was very judgmental. She made my teenage years awful always pointing out any weight gain and pimples. She never complimented me when I got into shape and my skin cleared up she always had something negative to say.  <br>  I used to be friends with a girl who was a Taurus and she was kind of obsessed with me it took me 12 years to finally break off the friendship. <br>  Nicer things to say about Taurus, well one of my very best friends is a wonderful Taurus woman. She is very supportive and kind. We get along just great, I miss going shopping with her (she moved to another state). She always had the knack to find designer clothes on sale and I mean dirt cheap. She could find a $3 DKNY shirt in Macy's! She is a great person.|`|bvwYVGJOaa	up and down in friends but have good connection together
GdBG4PGYaa	To be totally honest, I thought you were good.<br>  <br>  You need to sing a bit louder (I can understand if you were nervous), and open your mouth, plug your nose, and breath from your stomach. Not your nose (not saying you were.)<br>  <br>  I am 13 also, just turned about a month ago. I have been singing (without voice lessons) since I was 4. I can imitate singers voices, and hit most notes easily.<br>  <br>  Just practice, you have the makings of a real singer! Sorry if I sounded harsh, I thought I should be honest with you. That is the only way you get anywhere. :)|`|SHE7SAGWaa	with a little more practice you can get better i think you should get sing lessons so you will now what octave to sing in all that other stuff|`|eR2rrcJcaa	yawn! honey, u need more energy, i was falling asleep about 30 seconds into the song, sry.|`|gQJUrbZOaa	for thirteen ur not so bad just a few issues with keys a few lessons will do ya the world of good but well done|`|l5HRmfC0aa	Yes, you are good. Next time, try singing with more louder and with more energy.|`|S7qkGJLlaa	I think you have potential... but honestly I didnt feel it. It sounded like you were bored...|`|EB5rI5bQaa	Okay well i am assuming you want us to be completely honest. That is what this is for. I really think you have the potential to be a singer, BUT a couple of things that you need to work on...<br>  -Sing a little louder, you were very quiet and i had to turn the volume up 100 percent.<br>  -Try to breath out of your mouth only when you sing. Like, stop the air from coming through your nose. You sound a wee bit nasaly but not too bad.<br>  -You need a little vibrato in your voice, you can tell you are thirteen and your voice hasnt matured much and you sound like a little girl, but if you add vibrato (a quiver at the end) it will make you sound more mature and advanced. <br>  -Listen to singers like Leona Lewis, Carrie Underwood, and Christina Aguilera. They are powerhouses and if you try to keep up with them and practice, you will be helping yourself to become a better singer, which will help with some of your pitch problems.<br>  <br>  All in all i think you are a good singer for your age, some people have the natural talent, and some people have to work for it. Just keep working and i know you can become something!|`|ojEkgJoqaa	spam

Don't rush anything.|`|RK63biHQaa	The best advice I ever got was...<br>  "No answer is your answer" in other words, if he is silent, hes refusing to answer you or doesn't care about you and your feelings. He's therefore given you his answer by telling you he doesn't respect you or the relationship enough to tell you he;s not interested anymore and he's taking the cowards way out through silence. <br>  There there are two quotes that embody this message:<br>  <br>  "Sticks and stones are hard on bones<br>  Aimed with angry art,<br>  Words can sting like anything<br>  But silence breaks the heart."<br>  ~Phyllis McGinley<br>  <br>  <br>  "Spiteful words can hurt your feelings, but silence breaks your heart."<br>  <br>  In my opinion any guy who can be so hurtful through silence you shouldn't waste your time on having any feelings for, because a real man can face up and tell you.|`|plBXp91Daa	Maybe it is indeed better not to mail him for a while let him work things out.

Oh, did i mention my names Hildegard Alexandra Robusk? I was voted most likely to die alone in the year 2008. And let me just say, I have not died. And I... am alone. I am the complete OPPOSITE of the word platitudinous. I've had a crush on Bill Nye ever since I first saw him on my 2nd grade video. I wish to marry that young lad. I have 4 cats, all named after my grand ancestors. One named Bertha, Jilusephit, Gredle, and Sniffles. Sniffles was my great great great great great grandma and since they couldn't speak fluent sentences, her name was Sniffles.<br>  Ive recently painted all the walls in my house gray, to match my exuberant personality!<br>  And in conclusion- What was i answering again?

6HyFHrfIaa	*Not sure with Overlord Ben. Seems to be confused on astrology.* Anywho, perfect match, do not worry. Water and Earth signs are sensual and more emotional so they balance each other out. Being that both Pisces and Virgo are of 'Mutable' quality, they make great servants and have great flexibility, especially for each other. Virgo, being in the First Half of Life, is more personal but more out going but Pisces, as part of the Second Half of Life, is more, way more quiet but more accepting.|`|szYAHqwTaa	Its a crazy pair but they can work out. Virgo men are stubborn, hard headed and like it done their way. Virgos are usually introverts and enjoy the outside. Pisces are so open and carefree and emotional. The biggest issues are that pisces are carefree and go with the flow. Virgos are so strict in everything they do.<br>  <br>  This what i go through <br>  <br>  hope it helps**

NH6CD5v2aa	Because its not a trail blazing thing like Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Huey Newton, etc... So when you break it down and truly be honest they haven't really did anything seriously as positive as those people I named. They haven't invented anything or made a way for other black people. Dr. Ben Carson & Obama compared to Ice Cube and Jay-Z it isn't even close who did more for the African American race.<br>  <br>  We have had some positive people like Public Enemy, The Roots, Common, Tupac, etc. That spoke of black power and becoming better people but its much easier to speak it than to actually do something about it.|`|pfOU3I7Zaa	Too many people look at hip hop as a negative thing- it promotes violence and evokes anger.|`|ZZejs5YXaa	i would assume that it's because that's somewhat of a stereotype, hip hop is not always accociated with african americans|`|cR4W88GYaa	cuz they don't rap about politically correct things just controversial things so only hip hop fans can truly like it and understand it.|`|wfZhkZO0aa	Because in the grand scheme of things, Hip Hop hasn't been around nearly as long as Jazz and the Blues and it hasn't given as much of a positive impact on peoples lives like other things.  I mean, yeah some rappers give back to their communities but you don't really hear a lot about it..  It's different for Jazz and Blues though.|`|6fxr3VBGaa	we need a hip hop history month|`|a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	Hip-hop isn't Black. It's universal. It's never been just a Black thing.<br>  <br>  In the beginning it was mainly Black and Hispanic.<br>  In the 80s it started to gain mainstream popularity.<br>  In the early 90s it gained respect and a lot of white fans that liked hip-hop for what it was. After '95 people started liking Hip-hop because it was on the radio. In 2000 Wu-tang grabbed a few more fans. And in the current decade, more white people like rap, confusing it for hip-hop or urban culture, than Black people.|`|JmKPNP3Qaa	i know... it just needs to be.|`|oJfBZ8wOaa	cause no one talks about guys like public enemy no more?|`|1lvyUwo7aa	I don't know, it should be. my school is doing a play, and I'm gonna be LL Cool J. Our play ain't like most schools. Ha HA|`|pB55nws3aa	Because black history month mainly talks about how African-Americans changed society for the better and made African-Americans more accepted in society. Sure, Hip-Hop is a great thing, but think about it, not everyone in hip-hop is African-American, and even the people who kind of started the hip-hop culture, not all of them were African-American. Remember, hip-hop isn't just the music, it's also the style, dance, slang, etc.|`|FAaePWPWaa	Because Hip Hop hasn't done much  in Black History. It hasn't made a big movemet in Black History. Like people like Malcon X, Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, etc . They actually have fought for Blacks to be treated equally. Yes Hip Hop has raised questions about the living conditions of blacks etc. But the genre hasn't changed anything. A genre like Jazz is a subject in Black history because during the 1920's it actually brought both whites and blacks together to enjoy the genre together(Harlem Renassiance).|`|BUuZyplnaa	Russell simons always bring up the topic when he`s interview for black history|`|VclnZhSCaa	Because its done more harm than good for the "movement".|`|haxPqmIgaa	maybe the government don't like it?<br>  <br>  <br>  (they dont like alot of things......)<br>  Lol...<br>  <br>  Edit: OO WAIT BUSH IS GONE!!<br>  <br>  Hip hop history month has a chance, our government now anint AS bad!<br>  <br>  haha|`|8de9fT87aa	Good question|`|AA11892617	I don't know.

Even if Spiderman can sense danger, Superman would still be too fast for him to respond.<br>  <br>  The Hulk vs the Thing has been done many times, and everytime the Hulk has won.  The one advantage the Hulk has, is that the angier the stronger.  The Thing has a limit, while the Hulk will just get stronger and stronger.  The Hulk will win.<br>  <br>  Batman vs Daredevil...This one is really hard because in the two crossovers, they didn't fight but work together.  Daredevil is blind but has a radar which allows him to use pin-point accuracy to hit his targets.  Batman is just really good at responding to attacks and throwing bat-like boomerangs.  But, Daredevil can also dodge these as well do to his ninja-like reflexes.  Daredevil may be able to hit Batman more since Daredevil can hear Batman's moves due to the wind caused by the movements.  BUT Batman can hit harder.  In DC vs Marvel when Batman hit Bulls-eye, Bulls-eye said "You hit harder than Daredevil"  I think the overall would be a tie between these great warriors.

Maybe you should just ask him as he could be sincere and doesn't want to take you out if he has no money.  He could be one of those guys that do pay for the other person, so you might have to let him know that you will go out with him no matter what.  Even if it's down the beach/park with fish & chips.  I can remember one of my dates in the younger years and that's all we could afford or even make a picnic for the 2 of you as the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.  There are alot of ways to go out and not spend any money and you can make it perfect for the first time.   Good Luck
HuXMiJLpaa	I do give mixed signals, and I know I do by others reactions. Honestly, my feelings just fluctuate, that and the only time I send mixed signals is when I truly am not that attracted or that into the guy. But, I must admit even if I like a guy I won't let on, because I don't want him to think he has the upper hand, but I won't send any mixed signals, I just send none at all. Hope this helped. The best way to know where you stand with a scorpio is just to ask.|`|SzAc05CVaa	Sometimes we do that just because we are passionate about things and wanted our FRIEND feel great. But then GUY FRIENDS just response it AS FLIRT. But sorry, we DON'T flirt. we just nice to one that helped us, we just try to be Polite. So when the boy then RESPONSE in WRONG TERM,i would BACK OFF. I dont like givin mixed signal.<br>  <br>  So when you think you were given mixed signal: she just not that into you. Sorry.<br>  <br>  If I like you i would make you feel comfortable around me, and make your way to me easier but without make me seems easy. <br>  <br>  The difference is: if you are not comfortable with the situation: then that is what us wanted you to be. We are very manipulative. Trust your gut everytime.|`|tBsMH9kGaa	I don't think so.|`|6NZeItMAaa	Those who have not earned the higher law of love are often very unsatisfactory and eccentric in their dealings with their friends. A friend is a splendid fellow as long as he can be used, but when he no longer contributes to their happiness and wellbeing, he will be tossed aside with no more compunction than one would throw away a squeezed lemon. Later, if they feel that the assistance of the enemy is necessary, the bridge will be rebuilt and used to the utmost. Scorpio people have infinite tact in such matters, and their wonderful magnetic power enables them to destroy and restore these friendships with ease and grace. <br>  <br>  When Scorpio people live on the higher plane, they are very superior individuals; when they do not, they are apt to be tricky, subtle, and very cunning. They have a way of finding out secrets, and especially those which pertain to business and social successes. Information thus gained is always utilized to the best advantage, and if it decreases the income or the power of the friend, it is regarded as a good joke by the one who has used the information thus fraudulently obtained. These unawakened Scorpio, people will stop at nothing to attain their ends on account of their determination and persistence. Whether working for good or evil results, they are indefatigable in their efforts to accomplish their purposes. <br>  <br>  The women in this sign who have not learned to control themselves are apt to be great scolds and the worst naggers in the world. Their children are usually the especial victims. Such women are so jealous and suspicious of their husbands, and so fearful that other women will have some power over them, that they are constantly on the watch for an appearance of infidelity. A smile or a look is sometimes sufficient to cause a serious domestic storm. When this suspicion keeps up, separations and divorces are sure to follow. These people will lie just to make mischief.|`|yLQ5b5Rmaa	he key to ScorpionsCOMMUNICATION. if you dontdon'tl them how you feel no matter how intiintuitive senssensitivey are they cant guess you. in fact no one can,COMMUNICATION you need to communicated my dear Bear|`|Zb7H4B3Xaa	The main trait of Scorpio is possesiveness.

ce83aaa18b48dd89e8f2ce5b7f9d7885aa	They are ok for the money. But don't let Hawk kid you. You can't lump Austin, Yamaha, and all those other guitars in with Martin. Martin are some of the best made guitar out there.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Austin is just as good as the Yamaha, Martin , and all those other guitars. They are not too expensive. Even the Jap made Fender is just as good. But the best guitars are the Amercan made Fenders,(the older the better) Specially the Strats and Teles, the Epiphone Les Paul, Gibson Casino, Flying V, etc. The Epiphone Les Paul Vintage is probably the best guitar according to many. For newer Guitars , Ibanez S series is a good guitar. Lightweight, good sound . As opposed to the Les Paul.  Anything over 5-6 hundred dollars are good guitars. Means better qauilty. Beginners guitars are such as the ones mentioned above. Including Austin.|`|3SO9tsdsaa	Impossible question to answer - different guitars suit different styles and different players.  If there was a "best", you wouldn't see professional musicians using such a wide variety of instruments.  Two of the most popular models, however, are the Fender Stratocaster and the Gibson Les Paul.<br>  <br>  Try checking out an instrument review site like Harmony Central for opinions on specific models.  The Austins seem to be well-regarded for reasonably-priced models.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://reviews.harmony-central.com/" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.harmony-central.com/</a>|`|vzsnyIsqaa	Wow, talk about a vague question. It depends on what style of music you are into, and what you hope to accomplish. I love the Fender Stratocasters, but I play music styled after Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughn - all notable Strat players. Another amazing brand (if you can afford it) is Gibson. They make some of the most recognized guitars in history. The Explorer, the Flying V, the SG, and of course, one of the most used guitars ever, the Les Paul. Metal-heads and shredders are famous for using Ibanez, who are endorsed my such notable people as Joe Satriani and Steve Vai. (both have there own signature model). P.R.S. Guitars are a fairly recent company, but with their amazing attention to detail (and endorsement by such notable players as Carlos Santana) they have quickly become the third most popular brand in the United States.<br>  <br>  As for Austin...<br>  <br>  Not a very well know brand, but from what I can tell, a very respectable company. Most of their stock are spin-off models of Gibson and Les Pauls, and it really comes down to what sound you want. Sweet Jazz sounds with a hollow body, crunchy humbuckers, shimmery single-coils, they seem to have it all. Definitely lower in price range, but they seem very well made and have great reviews.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped.<br>  <br>  Check out these sites....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.austingtr.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.austingtr.com/index.html</a><br>  <a href="http://reviews.harmony-central.com/reviews/Guitar/brand/Austin" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.harmony-central.com/revie...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/reviews/electric_guitars/austin/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/reviews/e...</a>

J1elZSMUaa	If your playing horde by yourself I wouldn't use the sniper because enemy can easily sneak up behind you. If you are playing with your buddies then I would use sniper on either gridlock in one of the two temples. If you don't have the flashback map pack then try playing on DayOne and just climb over that small barrier where you pick the sniper up and sit there. Hope this helps.

AA10532675	Nah, we're not all that trashy.  And Brits here are stereotyped as snobs with a dry, boring, sense of humor; which is why I loved Benny Hill, (and own just about anything he ever did), he blew that theory out of the water!.  Although years ago there was a poll, "Which family does yours most resemble on tv?"  The most popular answer here was Roseanne.  Even that is scary! When I was a kid, it was "Leave it to Beaver!.  Mercy, how times have changed.  The Cosby Show was good though. Seriously, there were many good shows that depicted real life.  Nowadays, most of it's just hype, and they wonder why our kids are so screwed up, when they have the role models they do.  I'm sure it's the same every where though.  Hey, you guys started it!  yOU SENT US THE bEATLES AND A WHOLE NEW ERA WAS BORN!  TEE HEE, JUST JOKING, ALTHOUGH i CAN REMEMBER MY MOTHER TAKING THE SCISSORS TO MY BROTHER'S HAIR WHEN HE TRIED TO GROW IT LIKE THEIRS. Darn it, sorry about the caps, and I'm too tired to type the whole thing over, sorry.  Yeah, sometimes I'm truly embarrassed about the message our tv shows send to other countries.  But there are some good ones; they're just not publicized as much. <br>  Funny afterthought, can you imagine if all anybody saw in other countries was "My Name is Earl?"<br>  I LOVE Dr. Who, watched it in the 70's.  But I can't get PBS where I am now.|`|XNBMzuxbaa	No, those are soaps and drama TV shows.

It does portray some our struggles, thoughts, and motives, but the beautiful bodies, the money, the houses, the cars, the romance...most of that is just a dream for Americans. Thus, the American dream. The most realistic American show I've ever seen is probably the Cosby show. While it is a little cheesy, it's a good portrayal of modern American life.|`|Asn27TsTaa	TV is not reality. I do live in the United States, and TV is so dramatic.

Although there are communities and individuals who are very wealthy, superficial, vain, promiscuous and stupid all over and not just in the US.  If you want to find vain superficial botox plumped and plastic surgery gone bad folks, you can find many of them in places like Beverly Hills California where alot of them are stinking rich.  Desperate 30 something working women who can't live without their Dolce Gabbana, Jimmy Choos or Manolo Blahnik shoes can be found in droves in places like Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, California and Manhattan, New York and other expensive areas throughout the US.<br>  <br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|SqNPj54Kaa	If you really want to know what life is like for most of us from the states, watch a few episodes of Roseanne; that's more in the ball park!
p6I881Lwaa	Of course. Your ascendant does not only influence your physical appearance, but how you act in public eye. While your descision-making and emotions is that of a Scorpio, people might first give in to the thought that you act like an Aquarius, because that is who you unconciously try to be. Also, during the mid-ages, astrologers believe that a person gradually becomes more like the ascendant, rather than the Sun sign.<br>  <br>  try reading about the effects of the rising here: <a href="http://www.elbertwade.com/page108.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.elbertwade.com/page108.html</a>|`|AA11899483	well that depends if there is anything else in your chart, and the aspects, and house placements.

zXHNSohTaa	This is a tough one. I loved the graphic novel so much that I am definitely interested in seeing it, but I am also scared that they'll screw up like they have with almost every other Alan Moore adaptation (V for Vendetta was the only one watchable IMO).<br>  <br>  The posters look good, but the trailer and commercials are kinda meh. Rorschach (my fave character) looks like he could be good, but Dr. Manhattan looks stupid to me.<br>  <br>  So in a nutshell, my answer is that I hope it will be good...but I fear it will be sucky! LOL|`|NUc6Aw9Gaa	I think it looks good and I have read alot of good things about it but I have learnt my lesson the hard way before with films like this. I want it to be good and I hope it is.|`|RBS5ngKQaa	I have a good feeling about it. To be honest a lot of film adaptions of books can be a bit questionable.  Changes have to be made in someway as it is an altogether different medium. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.<br>  I think Watchmen is going to be along similar lines as the Sin City movie. From the trailers it looks like they are staying quite faithful to the book.|`|8OREBeRdaa	I like the trailers.   I like the fact that Nite Owl doesn't have a beer gut. I don't think it will be a HUGE blockbuster but I hope it doesn't suck. We'll just have to wait and see.|`|4636c77ba0bd1830e80c0cae29293574aa	i like the trailers. <br>  i think it will be good and sucky, at the same time.|`|j4wEXD29aa	I think the only good part of the movie is the trailer...<br>  but, we'll have to wait and see it|`|fddRY8Uiaa	I think it looks pretty good, although trailers are never really a good way to judge if a movie will be good or not. Most trailers are edited together up to a year before the movie is finished and often can seem more action-led than the actual finished movie,etc. In my opinion I think the slo-mo bits in the trailer look quite cool. Can't wait to see Watchmen and indeed if it will live up to the graphic novel's reputation. I think (and hope) it will. Only down side is Ozymandius wearing a black costume, instead of gold!|`|Z7hrRgEmaa	It looks pretty amazing to me.<br>  I've read the graphic novel and the actors resemble the characters nearly perfectly. Plus the sets, clothes and scenecs look exactly the same. Unlike some book to movie adaptions this one seems like it'll actually be worthy of the graphic novel.<br>  <br>  But of course I can't say for sure until I've actually seen it.<br>  I hope I'm right though.|`|UeGbG8Axaa	good and sucky...mostly sucky

Sg8ClJuzaa	Its about this kid named Ichigo who in the beginning has the ability to see souls.  He soon meets this girl named Rukia who is from this world called the soul society (She is a Soul Reaper - a person who can help souls stock on earth pass on to the soul society).  Well one day Ichigo is sitting in his room and Rukia appears, she is suprised that ichigo can see her but does not mind it for long b/c she soon remembers she is in a fight with this large creature called a Hollow(which is a soul that never passed on to the soul society and when this happens the chain the hangs from a souls chest begins to dissapear, when it is completely gone the soul becomes a hollow).  Any way Rukia gets fataly injured by this thing and is forced to pass on her powers to Ichigo who becomes a substitute soul reaper.  he ends up defeating the hollow and goes on to many more adventures but that is bassically the beginning.  Its a great show and if your a anime fan you should have no problem getting into it.|`|uQCuW2P7aa	Bleach is a manga series that is from Japan.

I live in the U.S.,therefore, I'm speaking from an American perspective. Slavery was here (in the U.S.), the Holocaust wasn't. And let's not forget that the civil rights movement ended apprx. 100 years after slavery...just 40 years ago.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also,  a lot of people can't tell if someone is Jewish by looking at them. Thus, they're less likely to be racially profiled. With that said, both events were both horrific.

Klw3Ke3Haa	Sosuke Aizen.|`|lqWaiQnAaa	I LOVE GRIMMJOW AND ULQUIORRA! I like Grimmjow just a liiiiitttle bit better than Ulquiorra. They are my second and third favorite characters, after Renji. I like Grimmjow better than Ulquiorra because Ulqui is cold, quiet, and expressionless (except with Orihime :-D) , and Grimm is cruel, but he is sooooo fearless. LOVE IT!!! If I knew guys like them, I would so date them! I also really like, Halibel. I don't know why, maybe it's because she is the only female and I respect her for that. She's quiet, doesn't like fighting(like almost everyone else), is wise, and she seems to have some weird concern and sensitivity towards her enemies...?(not like a hollow or arrancar AT ALL!) Oh, and LOVE Nel, but she's not really an antagonist, is she? No. Hehe! So yea, there you go.......;-)|`|m2BCAdD3aa	I really liked Szayel Aporro one of the espada in season 9, his abilities are very fasciniating since he can get voodoo dolls form people and damage their internals organs with em , he can reborn etc..<br>  But my all time fav. antagonist is Aizen since i could actually  understand why he become who he was by watching the episodes from 206 to 208 ( 110 years ago ) where he was the vice captain of one of the 13 protection squads and the captain of the squad is the current one of the current vaizards<br>  He is strong , VERY intelligent and not only but he could get to manipulate the espadas without even beign an arrancar + his plan of using karakura to make thw King`s Key is brilliant|`|bRjq7xZ5aa	gin! he's so adorable yet sinister at the same time|`|wO2WY54kaa	my favorite antagonists in Bleach are Grimmjow and Jin.

The only person that really talks to her is Shouta Kazekaya who is popular in class and eventually gets the class to accept her. She also gets close to him....<br>  <br>  Kyou, Koi Wo Hajimasu<br>  <br>  It's about this girl who loves to style hair and pretty much does her sister's hair everyday. She herself thinks that she doesn't match the great hairstyles she does and only has braids. She quiet, reserved, and values intelligence yet when she finds out the rude guy she met the other day is actually the smartest guy in her school, she's baffled. Conflicts arise between them and he cuts off one of her braids and to revenge herself, cuts his hair for him (though it looks good), he decides to take her firsts for everything, kissing her...<br>  <br>  Special A - you'll like it if you like ouran. <br>  <br>  Nodame Cantabile - perfect for you! This quirky, weird girl falls for the most popular guy at her music college. He's cold to her in the beginning, incredibly good-looking, and very talented. Also, the first time her hears her play, he can tell she has hidden talent beneath her sporadic playing. She plays the piano and he plays the piano and the violin. <br>  <br>  Koukou Debut - it's about this girl who was a tom boy most of her life and when she reaches highschool decides to get a boyfriend, yet fails terribly at it.

Ow3O7h4caa	Jupiter stays 1 year in each sign approx. This transit is usually excellent for most kinds of relationships, but ehre are some pitfalls. This transit signifies a desire to grow and advance through contacts with others. Probably you are willing to give as mush as you get, although in some people this transit triggers a desire for advantages thorugh others without giving anything in return. In fact, as they get ahead, such people are arrogant toward everyone and when they hit hard times, there is no one to help them out.<br>  <br>  But this result is totally unnecessary,  and all you have to do to avoid it is to keep a sense of humility and recongnize what others havve dones for you.<br>  With this transit, one has the potential to become a better person, but only if they keep these warnings in mind.<br>  <br>  Even though this is a square aspect which are categorized stressful and bad, benefits can come to you in either your personal and domestic life or in your work. There may be opportunity  to make money or to make improvements in your home that will make it more pleasant.<br>  Or you may meet people who will help you learn more about the world and expand your view.  One other point, in all negotiations and transactions with others, you have a pronounced tendency to overlook details and to assume that everything will work out. But it won't if you don't pay attention to the details.<br>  <br>  On a physical level, you may tend to put on weight as Jupiter does signify expansion. and usually, the part of the body that is square to it is often, the area when tends to expand, swell etc...<br>  <br>  This transit will happen twice a year as well as the opposition. This is not uncommon since unless a person has a short life-span. Basically, the square is felt 3 years after its conjunction, and on the 9th year after the conjunction.<br>  Also, if Jupiter is badly placed, you will still gain but lose it afterward. If well-aspectd at birth, the square won't prevent the good from happen . It will simply diminish somewhat, the full benefit.|`|HZxX9ke8aa	jupiter is insight, understanding and luck.<br>  <br>  ascendant is self-projection.<br>  <br>  square aspect is tension between these two.<br>  <br>  first of all, this is not a good aspect. then, it will probably make you choose wrong directions. <br>  <br>  what happens when there's a conflict between your insight/understanding/luck and the way you act?<br>  <br>  nothing good for sure. be cautious, think twice or even thrice.|`|TQz6pIExaa	it appears what we have here is an extreme sensitivity to caffeine which is causing your heart rate to go extremely high which in turn causes your blood pressure to drop and gives you the hot flushed feeling "like your going to pass out." this occurs when you ingest large doses of caffeine without eating, and should be closely monitored. <br>  <br>  we recommend giving up caffeine for a while, or having much smaller amounts coupled with food. keep your blood sugar levels constant and see if that makes a difference in the way you are feeling. <br>  <br>  if symptoms don't change with the lower intake of caffeine and steady food consumption, recommend visiting family doctor for physical and blood work due to the fact that it could be a new onset of cardiac problems.<br>  Source(s):<br>  husband is paramedic...typing everything he says...lol<br>  23 hours ago
Ow3O7h4caa	As for the frequency of this happening, once it makes a conjunction to natal Jupiter, it will square it 3 years down the line, and then in another 6 years from the square.<br>  <br>  Jupiter to Jupiter is very important for you to keep your affairs from getting out of hand. Their is strong tendencies to excess, which may make it impossible to keep up with whatever you are involved in, simply because it is more than you can handle.<br>  You have to be careful concerning financial situations, for you are likely to spend without thinking, confident that there is an abundance of money or other resources to back you up.<br>  But money is not the only area of concern. You may be overcommitted to projects that demand more time than you really have. So in every area of your life, make sure that you really have the time or resources to do what oyu have set out to do. Do not overestimate the resources at your disposal.<br>  <br>  If you avoid the pitfall, this can be a very fruitful transit, because it gives you more confidence and optimism and allows you to undertake projects that you would ordinarily be reluctant to take on. Also your basically positive attitude helps to ensure that your affairs will turn out the way you want.<br>  Under this transit some persons experience a kind of ego inflation in which they have delusions of grandeur or overestimate their self-importance. This can lead to arrogant behaviour and inflated pride with little or no real substance behind it. What does this transit does is test you sense of proportion. You have to know what you really can and annot do and who you really are. Insofar  as you fulfill those conditions, this transit will give you apparent luck and greater power to achieve. Insofar as you do not know about yourself, you will experience the negative effects of the transit.<br>  <br>  This transit lasts one year approximately. Everybody has this transit in their chart.

fBZqFBsPaa	I think they're alright! =]<br>  But it would be a lot easier to judge the song if you put it to music. If you want to get noticed - try YouTube. Keep up the good work, I know writing music isn't easy sometimes... ( I write my own music too ;) ... but writing your own music is very admirable. Artists who sing other people's words are not very sincere and they aren't around for a very long time. However, writing your own music will definitely get people on your good side. It takes practice, and you may start writing a song and end up hating it or vice versa, but practice makes perfect and if you really want to get noticed keep it up and look for opportunities that may help you. Maybe you could even try taking up guitar - that way you have more control over what your music will sound like and you could play your own songs on stage too!

uUA0iy5uaa	Well, if I can recall correctly, Griffith wanted Gutts to be the part of the "Band of the Hawks." When Griffith learned about his plan of leaving the group, he had fought him. Gutts obviously won, and this fight left Griffith basically "scarred". As a result of his loss, he committed such atrocious acts such as sleeping to the daughter of the king. He had apparently loss his sense of faith or common sense that he didn't even think the consequences of his reckless behaviors. After that, he was tortured, but was released later.<br>  <br>  If my summary still confuse you, you can check this nifty Berserk encyclopedia:<br>  --- <a href="http://www.skullknight.net/encyclopedia/" rel="nofollow">http://www.skullknight.net/encyclopedia/</a>

PzSI7EPEaa	It maybe unique for western audiences but it's like a typical Bollywood movie about childhood sweet hearts, going through poverty and triumphing in the end. It plays on stereotypes that appeal to western prejudices though. A below average film which has only been awarded because it's made by a westerner about Indian poverty. It plays on religious stereotypes too without ever understanding the history of Hindu muslim conflict in India, presenting Hindus as some sort of rapacious monsters and muslims as victims. It shows westerners as generous and Indians as people who would not even give bread to a poor boy hanging off the outside of a train. It skips from Mumbai to Agra in one scene to show Taj Mahal which is 1000 miles away only to show the Taj Mahal a symbol of India in the west. Over the top with broad generalisations and negative stereotypes designed for a western audience.|`|4636c77ba0bd1830e80c0cae29293574aa	it's a love story.<br>  and has another underlying message.<br>  but it's really amazing you should just see it.<br>  I'm sorry I can't really say a lot about the theme, etc. bc I don't know what to say, without ruining the story.|`|m8kF5U84aa	I have not watch it yet but i do it looks super good. its pro ally just a real movie.|`|Gy5OV6CZaa	Watch it and find out.|`|6Y1A1UG7aa	The movie is about a boy who grows up in the slums. He makes it onto "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" and wins all the money. But, the officials don't believe him because he is poor and grew up on the slums. While in jail he convinces the guard guy that he didn't cheat by telling him about his experiences while he lived in the slums. <br>  <br>  I don't want to spoil too much, but it also has romance and drama in it.|`|UAyCxFIRaa	i think the "big whoop" bout this movie is that, it has never been done (not a remake, at least i don't think).great storyline.  it makes u appreciate life, shows u how other people in the world are living. you have to watch it, it's really good. i don't wanna give anything away..|`|QMYNDtHgaa	Because Danny Boyle only does super bizarre crazy films that everyone loves but would rather not admit how super cool and great they are.  So he finally settled down from a cynical all life is meaningless type of film making and made a film the academy would love.  You know a movie that respects an art that will never be acknowledge by the academy with an over the top happy go lucky ending.  I think he deserves an Oscar but not really for Slum Dog.  Glad he won though. <br>  <br>  You don't have to watch it, you can pretty much fake having seen it and no one would question you.  It's very pain by numbers, very cliche.  I was only shocked at how plane and ordinary everything was in a Danny Boyle film.  OH WOW THE CAMERA IS TILTED AWKWARDLY QUICK BRING ON THE OSCAR!

Some will work and some won't, that's why they provide you with a few and some are in higher quality than others, I usually use the megavideo link if there is one available because those give you the option of fullscreen and are of reasonable quality. Megavideo does open a popup first before you can watch your content which is annoying but you can just close it.<br>  <br>  Otherwise learn how to use bittorrent and then go to www.torrentz.com and search for what you want and there's a very good chance someone will have put the whole series up there for you.|`|d740a1806ac12ea6cc4e2e9a03202502aa	NBC.com|`|eYItq8vuaa	you can go on youtube.com and search it.<br>  if that doesnt work well for you, you could go to the networking site.

The Shining - amazing build up and great shots<br>  3. Who Can Kill A Child - possibly most underrated movie ever made<br>  4. Evil Dead II - classic horror/comedy/strange<br>  5. The Tenant - creepy Polanski movie<br>  6. Cannibal Holocaust - extremely disturbing<br>  7. Rosemary's Baby - another creepy Polanski film<br>  8. Suspiria - by the Italian Hitchcock beautiful colorful film<br>  9.

Adams favored grandiose titles such as "His Majesty the President" or "His High Mightiness" over the simple "President of the United States" that eventually won the debate. The pomposity of his stance, along with his being overweight, led to Adams earning the nickname "His Rotundity."|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	He was obnoxious.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	He's "obnoxious and disliked, you know that, sir!"<br>  <br>  The point of the musical number, "But, Mr. Adams," is that John Adams is a pushy, loudmouth, opinionated little cuss, and if he writes the "Declaration of Independence" then no one will read it!

bvwYVGJOaa	Virgo and Cancer are like best friends and complement each other really well and appreciate each other. But anxious to please each other.<br>  <br>  Keep up the friendship level first and then fall in love and have down to earth relationship. Virgo and Pisces could work but i doubt it Virgo would adapt to Pisces romantic skills..no offence. Virgo likes to be more passionate and sensual-intensed.|`|6cZeMyyFaa	I would have to say Cancer is more compatible. I know a Virgo Cancer couple and they are inseparable. Even though Pisces and Virgo are opposites and, in theory, complement each other this can be too much at times and not always good for long term relationships.<br>  <br>  Remember there are many aspects in one's natal chart to consider in terms of compatibility. But, again, I would go with Virgo and Cancer :)<br>  <br>  All the best!|`|8sMr9Vmtaa	See <a href="http://zodiacal-compatibility.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://zodiacal-compatibility.blogspot.c...</a><br>  The site explains compatibility between all possible combinations among the zodiacal signs, with emphasis on relationships.|`|kfMcRr1Vaa	virgo&cancer|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Cancer.|`|HZxX9ke8aa	pisces are always more compatible with any sign than cancer.<br>  <br>  1. cause they are a mutable sign while cancer is cardinal.<br>  <br>  2. even though dreamy and very emotional they will not be cranky like cancerians.<br>  <br>  3. as long as you show that you care pisces' feelings it's gonna be alright. but it doesn't matter how much care or whatever you show for cancerian, their moods are just gonna keep shifting. one day they will act like as if they are leos, one day as if pisces and one day as if scorpians. that, is their nature.<br>  <br>  unless you like wierdos like me and like psychological challenges go for pisces.

We've been dating for 6 months. He is a great guy, really nice, little shy but extremely loyal and caring! He is very committed. <br>  <br>  We do bicker at each other from time to time but we always talk about everything and make things work out in the end.<br>  <br>  I don't know to what extent I believe in astrology but I say go for it, regardless of his sign!|`|d2uGruHiaa	A Capricorn and a Scorpio feel the attraction the first moment they meet. (If they really are around the same age & serious about each other.) Well, that's how it was with me and my current boyfriend. When you first meet, you'll feel strong attraction towards each other, but as you guys talk more and more often, those strong feelings of attraction will turn into the feeling of falling for you even more. It is said that Capricorns and Scorpio are the best couple for each other and the other way around. Even though Capricorns take time/need time for everything, Scorpios will wait if they know that you are worth the wait. If they didn't think you'd be worth the wait, they would've left you already. Once Scorpios start opening up to a Capricorn, that Capricorn will open up to you. Just like I said, it takes time for everything to work. Of course you guys will have small arguments, but it's nothing that you can't fix. It may be boring sometimes, but you have to consider your surroundings. It'll be tough, nothing would be easy, but if you believe in love, and in him/her, then go for it. Don't let nothing stop you. Capricorns are secretive also. So, if you open up, he'll open up too- just like that! And I know why? Cause I waited for him to open up to me. I hope this helped. Just know that, if you want it to work, achieve it. If you want more than that, then work harder. :)|`|u0AmiATbaa	I have read in a lot of places that the relationship between a capricorn (myself) and a scorpio is a fantastic one.  Scorpio is probably the best partner for a capricorn and vice versa.  <br>  <br>  My best friend is a scorpio and we get along extremely well.  I know you aren't looking for a friend, but the same applies for partners as well.  We both have similar interests, but are a little different, so aren't in competition the whole time (e.g. wanting the same job, liking exactly the same things, liking the same people etc, which could be a problem as capricorns like to win and get really annoyed when they loose, trust me, I know!! <br>  <br>  They both have the same interests and a both similar (which is good) but aren't exactly alike, so there is room for variation (which is also good) and they can try each others ways of doing things and interests etc.<br>  <br>  They are a FANTASTIC match.<br>  <br>  I have left some websites for you to have a look at, they will explain what I have said better!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!

6NZeItMAaa	Aries is called the sign of sacrifice. People born under Aries are usually very executive, earnest, and determined. They accomplish what they resolve to do against all opposition. They are leaders, and naturally dominate those about them. They are noble, generous, magnetic, pro-gressive, and have occult power and meta-physical tastes. They are good schol-ars, are bright, genial, witty, and great talkers. They can always lead the con-versation into new and interesting paths, and are never at a loss to provide enter-tainment. The genius of this sign is intuition, and silent electro-magnetic power by means of the hands.<br>  <br>  These people are large and true, but are apt to be children of caprice, which has a sad effect upon their destiny. They reach their highest attainment through knowl-edge and the regenerative love-action of the heart. They love beauty, order, harmony, and elegant surroundings. They should not be circumscribed when giving out their true work of genius. If these people are born when the Sun is well centered in   Aries, they may attain the rhythmic swing of their regenerative centers, and there arises an electro-magnetic solar fluid which is so power-ful that it can be cast to a great dis-tance; in fact, there is only one other sign so strong in this direction and that is Aquarius. <br>  <br>  The dominant faults of persons born in this sign are selfishness, anger, and impetuosity. They are also whimsical, ca?pricious, and fickle to the last degree. They do not easily forgive their enemies, although they are rarely tempted to seek revenge for their wrongs. They will die fighting for a friend or a principle, but they will not yield a point until obliged to. These people do not like details. They are fond of planning, and are usually possessed of good taste and judgment.|`|Po6dgusAaa	You have a big imagination,you are quite charming,you would do just about anything for the people you love.You have a great sense of style,and you are picky.<br>  <br>  Edit: I would send you paragraphs loaded with info about aries with taurus rising but you can google that yourself.Am i right?|`|bq255NKSaa	Aries Sun = Your Core Personality<br>  <br>  Taurus Rising = Your Appearance / Your Body <br>  <br>  -----<br>  <br>  In your Character, you are an Aries - self confident, assertive, a Fighter.<br>  <br>  But your Outer Appearance, your Body, your Ascendant is a Taurus.<br>  With Taurus Rising you ray out to be very realistic and comfortable, in a negative way you can also just stop in your way and need a push from others.<br>  You dont like changes and are very comfortable and very calm.<br>  You have a strong need for security, both in a material and emotional way. You can be very stubborn and naive.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	You are magnetic and vital with considerable energy. Even though you may piss people off, most times you can use your considerable charm to get out of an impossibly difficult situations, you're one of those people who can usually get away with almost anything. Don't press your luck, however; it could run out.<br>  <br>              You have tremendous natural business sense and should rise high in the corporate structure which you have great admiration for and faith in. Any business that you personally start, based on your creative interest should also meet with considerable success.<br>  <br>              You are strong both physically and emotionally; and a person who seems laid back but is actually very intense. You are very opinionated and can be a powerful fighter when it comes to your point of view or if someone threatens you. As a general rule you are more self-centered than most and not that to considerate of others.<br>  <br>              Your energy needs constant dissipation and long outdoor exercise is recommended. This natives sexual expression may not always be along conventional lines but is substantial. The home is particularly important to you and probably reflects considerable work. You might really like living on a horse ranch.<br>  <br>              In love and relationships you are active, intense, loyal and passionate. This Astrological placement makes for an especially strong female's horoscope; one who rules her roost. A family and children are indicated.|`|Zb7H4B3Xaa	You are adventurous, carefree and friendly.  You have a bit of a stubborn streak and can be a bit predictable at times.

u7I3U8kLaa	After a period of bouncing from major to major and briefly dropping out of school for a semester, Washington worked as a counselor at an overnight summer camp called Camp Sloan YMCA in Lakeville CT. After participating in a staff talent show for the campers, a colleague suggested he try acting. Returning to Fordham that fall with a renewed purpose and focus, he enrolled at the Lincoln Center campus to study acting, snagging the title character in both Eugene O'Neill's The Emperor Jones, and William Shakespeare's Othello, where he earned rave reviews. Upon graduation, he was given a scholarship to attend graduate school at the prestigious American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco, where he stayed for one year before deciding to return to New York to begin a professional acting career.[7]|`|YhuH2k4Caa	wow you really love him, huh? lol you asked 3 questions about him.|`|t1QtLK4oaa	OMG!

JI00LaXxaa	First of all, chill on the caps lock! Thank you.<br>  <br>  Second of all, acting is something you need to commit to. It wont just take a year, it will take several years of hard work. Hard lessons, auditions all the time, etc. I know this from experience, my old best friend is an amazing singer, actor/actress, and model and has been taking classes at John Robert Powers for years. I think for at least 5 years now. So far? She's performed in front of tons of agents at a talent showcase that is hard to get into and has been in a commercial. <br>  But it wasn't easy at all. It will eat up so much your free time, and you might have to cancel things at the last minute to get to something else. Like my friend, I was at summer camp with her and she had to leave to audition for that commercial she was in. Luckily she got the part, but it still sucked because she had to leave me in the one part of summer that we got to hang out in. <br>  <br>  Anyways, back to helping you. I'm really no expert, but a few things you'll need:<br>  <br>  -A headshot<br>  -A resume<br>  -Time<br>  -Classes<br>  -Money to travel. I'm not saying you have to be rich to become famous, but this is just like any other job. To become a lawyer you need to go to law school and to become an actor/singer/whatever, you need to take expensive classes. Same with acting.<br>  <br>  To help you with each thing I listed above;<br>  <br>  Headshot info - "An 8x10 black and white headshot is a must have for all those who are actors or hope to become actors. A headshot is a photograph taken from the top of the shoulders up and has truly captured your look. One of the biggest pet peeves of casting directors is when an actor has a headshot that has been gussied up and looks nothing like the actor in person or on camera. Why black and white? It’s simple, it’s basic, and it looks professional. All actors should include a resume with their headshot, some even do it on the very backside, listing their statistics of eye color, hair color, weight, height, etc. along with their listed acting experience. "<br>  <br>  I'm sorry this is so long, but there's soo much info you need to know. I'm just going to post this question now so you can get some info already to help you, then edit this answer more later.|`|g1AtI2t2aa	NO COMMENT.|`|zkV7BiRPaa	you're annoying.<br>  you could never be an actOR by the way you sound.|`|YhuH2k4Caa	before you pursue acting....you need to take some english lessons.|`|f6wT7ZASaa	i doubt that raven is your cousin. lol. and even if she was, she shouldnt be too busy to help you, its not like shes even famous anymore.|`|8N4J9S7taa	You can get to Acter after the mission "four leaf clover."|`|7fVDo1cyaa	U act everyday its called lying|`|uCxYdyQXaa	Learn how to spell first.|`|k39bNUgeaa	First it's actor<br>  Second since your a girl you would be an actress.

Maybe we just know what great music is, and don't listen to pop crap. The Jonas Girls have nothing that I'm jealous of. I have nice hair, I am attractive, I can sing better than them and if I took only 1 guitar lesson, I would be 100 times better than those girls. You little girls should come up with something better and respect the opinion of other people. For now, we still enjoy freedom of speech!

2k8TEiRtaa	Welcome to the rest of the bar gig playing world. You obviously need some exposure. Do a demo of your music and your band. Then go everywhere and talk to the mangers, leaving your demo copy with them. Go to Casinos, bars, etc. Play at anything you can even if it's only for the exposure and not for money. Join the battle of the bands in your area. if you are good enough , you will get high exposure there. If you don't have one. Create a challenge to other bands with an ad looking for bands to do a battle of the bands. Then ask them to help you make it a reality. That's what we had to do when we were playing. Undoubtedly other bands have done this too.|`|3MAL2W3Eaa	Get your band known; put up posters, MySpace, FaceBook, whatever you can think of. Try and get your friends to tell their friends. Also, you could offer playing at small, family events.|`|78zZyNf5aa	Make up flyers, sheets of information about your band and drop them off at bars.|`|AA12203920	pay to play at bars/nightclubs. tell everyone you possibly know about it. if the sold ticket price surpasses the amount you payed+the amount the owner wants, you even get some profit !<br>  <br>  make a myspace for your band. request people who you think might be interested due to their existing musical tastes. post bulletins when you have performances coming up.|`|cy7freI8aa	You have to start with a studio-quality demo for sure, doesn't have to be long, three or four songs would be fine. Maybe a video. Write a bio for the band and put all of this stuff on a MySpace profile or website so it can easily be accessed for anyone interested in your band.<br>  <br>  Bars want to know you can bring people out, if you had a good amount of people come to your prior gigs, let them know that.<br>  <br>  As far as parties go, make up business cards or postcards and give them to everyone at your shows and make sure they say you are available for stuff like that.<br>  <br>  good luck!
unvP5cUdaa	Yes a new AMP format is being launched without Adam Carolla or any of the other jox. It's basically a Top-40 station with a few bells and whistles. The truth is: it's cheaper to run a music station than a talk station with expensive talent like Carolla.<br>  -a guy named Duh|`|Vhv1vyKWaa	Actually, the station is still owned by CBS. This is a "format change" with the goal being to lower operating costs. For whatever reasons, the company figured that the format had run its course.<br>  <br>  Leykis and Carolla are off the air for now but will probably pop up again in other places.|`|j5hn1QPOaa	The station wasn't sold, the owners wiped the station and started over with a brand new format to go against KIIS FM. It's called AMP RADIO. All of the old talk hosts were let go and have to search for new gigs.

Buffalo head is also a nice tune.

hj6XcV3Taa	Well I'm not 100% sure but I though he played the Old Man aswell because it actually looks like him and they can use make up and special effects to change his appearance dramatically. The voice over also sounds like him so I think they must have just put affects on his voice as well to change it a bit. I am certain that it's him when he's the middle aged sailor with White hair though and then obviously when he looks like Bradd Pitt. I thought the amazing bit was when he was like the teenager and he went back to see the woman in the dance studio because you could immediately tell it was Bradd Pitt but he looked really young ! <br>  <br>  I thought the film was really good but didn't realise how long it was untill I looked at the time afterwards - I was like Wooahh 3 hours !!|`|5135834c90cc2c12523172c90a0e1a7eaa	he started playing it as the old man. it's called special effects.|`|EMfLFsXEaa	Actually, I heard that it was his face in the entire movie.

7ba8b2fd4e9d10984fb9932e42a1afa5aa	Every singer has their own ranges of what is chest, mixed and head voice. Whistle notes are a rare register for females and even rarer to almost non-existent with male voices. This is one of many areas in which a voice teacher can not only help identify, but help develop.<br>  <br>  Here is a general description of the voices that might help you understand more about what they mean. This is information my voice teacher passed on to me early in my lessons with him.<br>  <br>  "Chest Voice" refers to singing with the power and support of your chest. This generally means singing on top of the power of your breath, supported by your diaphragm. It is the power aspect of this that differentiates chest from head voice, as both need the breath support to sustain.<br>  <br>  Your "head voice" is a much lighter sound that uses the breath for support but does not have nor does it need, the power that your middle range can produce.<br>  <br>  Your "mixed voice" uses a combination of the the two. You have the power of the chest voice, but the sound spins through your head voice range and is sung lighter.<br>  <br>  If you're male, then your other voice is "falsetto", which means false voice, and is made when you physically shorten (through technique) your vocal chords to create a higher range of notes. (Women do not have falsetto.) This also takes breath support, actually more than usual, as falsetto requires the shortened vocal chords to move fast, thus needing more air.<br>  <br>  When singing through your different voices, you want to think of the power as an upside down cone. The base of which is widest at the bottom which represents the bottom of your range. As you sing up the scale, the volume, or power of the notes decreases. You do not need the same power in the higher registers or top of the cone, to be heard at the same level as the lower notes of your range.  In other words, the higher into your range you sing, the softer you want to sing it.<br>  <br>  IE.  when you sing you lowest range, it probably takes all the power and breath you have for the notes to be heard, but if you try to sing your upper ranges with the same power and breath you use for your low notes, you will be screaming.   The key is to be aware that as you sing higher, back off on how much power you put behind the sound.|`|tbeO3Lataa	Everyone has a head and chest voice.<br>  <br>  Head voice is the upper range of the voice. When singing in head voice, you will feel the sound resonating in your head. It is also in this voice that high notes are hit by lifting the soft palette (Yawn. You've just lifted your soft palette). <br>  <br>  Chest voice is the lower range of the voice. When singing in your chest voice, the sound resonates in the chest. <br>  <br>  Both voices take practice to get used to and learn to use properly. However, it is quite important. It is very hard to sing high notes in chest voice, and vice versa.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!

EJ cancels the agreement with Melanie, much to the surprise of Phillip and Brady.  Brady supports Melanie after EJ pulls the deal.

irSBrZiQaa	first let me say I am so excited to see Phillip, he is one of my favorite characters. The show has not been the same without Grant(Phillip). I will do my best to make this as short and descriptive as I can :)<br>  <br>  Well Bill thought that it would be a good idea to find Phillip, so that he could help Lizzie break away from Alan's claws. Lizzie is going through a lot and it's mainly Alan's fault. Lizzie and Bill split because Cyrus convinced Lizzie that Bill kidnapped her. Bill is getting closer and closer to the truth.<br>  <br>  Beth and Coop were having an affair and Alan finally found out about it. Of course he went all physco and told Beth that if she did not stay away from Coop he would hurt the Coopers. Beth being afraid for Coop decided to break things off, however Coop was not ready to give up. Alan forced Beth into marrying him by making her sign a prenup saying if she cheated he would be able to keep Payton. Right before the wedding Coop was driving to get there to stop it, but he received a call from Alan saying that he would never touch Beth again. Coop was upset and lost control of his car. Right before the car caught fire Phillip appeared and pulled Coop from the car. Phillip rushed Coop to the hospital, but tragically he would pass on a few days later. Coop got to say his goodbyes to everyone. Poor Buzz is the one that had to make the decision to take him off of life support. <br>  <br>  Phillip is in jail for the kidnapping of his kids before he got shot. Lizzie called the police on him because she was scared. Alan and Alexandra are working to get him out.<br>  <br>  Everyone thought that Phillip was dead however Alan hid him because Phillip had gone crazy. Phillip did not want to return until he was sure that he was better. Alan did shoot him though.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped.<br>  <br>  Your welcome I am glad I could help :)|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Amazing answers - not much to add except that Phillip had occasionally contacted his old pal Rick Bauer so Rick knew where he was living when Bill wanted to go find him.|`|iSRsE8MBaa	Phillip was never dead, only believed dead.  Alan had been keeping him locked up somewhere for a long time.  By the time it was discovered he wasn't really dead Phillip had escaped confinement and nobody knew where he was.  <br>  <br>  Phillip knew Bill was looking for him so he came back.  He arrived upon the scene of Coop's car accident and rescued him from the car.  It would seem that he is back to his old self, I sure do hope so.  Phillip has been sorely missed and if anyone can help turn the show back around it is this actor as this character.  Welcome back Phillip!|`|wfCkAZJqaa	Let me just say I too am glad Phillip is back-he is a good character...but, I am devastated about Coop.  I really liked him.  Let's wait and see if and when Phillip returns to his old Spaulding persona.  Where has Grady been, and better, what has he been up to? I am angry about Cyrus tho' but I guess you can't teach a old dog new tricks.|`|9FCxm8qJaa	I love Philip and and am so glad he's back on!!|`|nucQYOf3aa	It hasn't been the only time he was back....at least I think so...!
upwbTscqaa	here are some amazing reasons!<br>  1) if he goes to an event you go to the same event<br>  2) if he is flying into a town close by you you go there<br>  3) if you are rich buy a meeting with him<br>  4) Dream<br>  <br>  hope these helps!|`|39wcLSoPaa	donno , but why would you want to meet him he's a gay retard. He dated Vanessa Hudgens to cover his gayness.|`|ht4Yzzu9aa	An autograph signing maybe???<br>  <br>  He's not my type, but just giving suggestions.|`|fpuHVNYgaa	In your dreams!!|`|WVVdf4ILaa	if you get cancer the make a wish foundation might come to you and ask you what you want|`|kdmhuVTEaa	Going to any events that he intends to attend.

EPPb5pRBaa	yeah, she is trying, but she won't...|`|RoFfCYGxaa	No.  If she is, she is failing miserably.  Tyra's show is a lot younger and trashier than Oprah's.  I think Tyra is just trying to produce a well-rounded talk show for younger genenrations, I don't think she wants to be Oprah or have a show just like Oprah's.|`|usIma0vIaa	She will NEVER be like Oprah,Oprah has much more history than Tyra does and her show will always win best talk show,Tyra needs to sit her self down and stop trying to be ENVIOUS of herself.|`|AA12382198	Per an interview she gave....she knows she can never touch Oprah.....but with her demographics (16-25 years olds) she's number one.|`|AA11322689	No I dont think so. She did say that she is influenced by Oprah but I highly doubt she wants to copy her in any kind of way. Shes doing her own thing. She may do some things that are similar but not exact. Tyra seems to be very independent.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Oprah started out trashy, and became boring.|`|bhyVC2mtaa	duuuuuuuh.<br>  she is like a mini-wanabe!<br>  i love tyra but shes never going to come close to oprah.<br>  she took a lie detector test and failed when asked if she was jelous.
jTkzSyzbaa	Libra and Pisces:<br>  <br>  These two will drink, dance and make music together. Both are talented, social and appreciate the good life. There will be fun, variety and attraction when these two are together. Libra will see a future and security with Pisces. Pisces will see class and style and will want to show off Libra in public. This could be a lasting and memorable romance. There will be a strong family tie involved in the relationship at some point. If both are committed to being committed to one another, then aspects are very good for long-term love. Sex will be very passionate and Pisces may want to make it legal. Avoid secrets and go for it. Children could be a surprise here! <br>  <br>  Compatibility Rating: This sign can teach you more about<br>  sex and love relationships.<br>  <br>  Note: Your compatibility with other signs of the zodiac also depends on your planets, rising signs and other aspects!|`|8ZUVToXgaa	Yeah. I noticed that October 20th is Libra. But I don't know how compatible it is with Pisces. Not sure.<br>  <br>  Look it up! :)|`|ee1TLZ2gaa	Oct 20 is not a Scorpio. That's a Libra. Libra and Pisces aren't very compatible.|`|MF9YknDYaa	57.39%?|`|TrGi75m3aa	When Scorpio and Pisces make a love match, theirs is a splendid union of much respect and understanding. These mates share the same Element -- Water -- and thus have keen insight into one another's minds and hearts. Scorpio is very profound and covert, often caught up in their own secret plans, while Pisces is idealistic and looks for the nuances of a situation. However, Pisces also has a tendency to withdraw into their own mind, and can forgive Scorpio for being mysterious or withdrawn at times. <br>  <br>  Both Signs are intuitive and in touch with the subtleties of human interaction. Scorpio can help Pisces fulfill dreams and ambitions -- to turn ideas into reality. The Scorpion will provide a steadfast foundation for the relationship to revolve around, and the more ephemeral and intuitive Fish will become entangled in Scorpio's web. In return, Pisces offers gentleness, kindness, and sympathy, which Scorpio admires and appreciates. Scorpio is interested in certain material comforts and intense emotional dramas, and at times cannot understand the simplistic, charitable attitude of Pisces. Their long-term aspirations can be completely unalike. Once they can understand and overcome this difference, theirs will be a very rewarding relationship. <br>  <br>  Mars and Pluto rule Scorpio, and Jupiter and Neptune rule Pisces. Mars is the ancient God of War, and Scorpio individuals are living proof of this aggressive, courageous, daring and sometimes-belligerent influence. When Pluto combines with Mars, Pluto comes to symbolize new beginnings. Scorpio can take it, but they can also most certainly give it. Jupiter's rule of Pisces represents philosophy, expansion and excesses. The Neptunian influence gives Pisces a dreamy aura and a love for popular culture and media. Pisces dreamy, ethereal energy softens their Scorpio love's rough edges. The composite power of these four planets creates a balanced relationship, one of drama and emotional intrigue; this is a true celestial bond. However, a Scorpio mate must let their beloved Fish swim about a bit; a sensitive Pisces will suffocate under too many demands. <br>  <br>  Scorpio and Pisces are both Water Signs. They're so compatible because Water is a tangible, physical entity, and both Signs appreciate and use this characteristic to their advantage. The destiny of a Pisces is to bring people together, and when this energy meets Scorpio's intensity and tenacity, there is no stronger bond. Also, Scorpio has an absolutist view of life; everything is either golden or tarnished. A patient Pisces opens the world up to their Scorpio mate, allowing them to see the bigger picture rather than just all that minute detail. Scorpio could grow weary of Pisces's unsteadiness, and Pisces may see Scorpio as self-absorbed and insensitive to their emotional needs. Still, it's not beyond these partners to seek out and find a compromise. <br>  <br>  Scorpio is a Fixed Sign, and Pisces is a Mutable Sign. Scorpio puts their energy into one thing at a time, but Pisces skips around to wherever their feelings take them. Pisces, as a Mutable Water Sign, then, molds easily into their Scorpio lover's life and pastimes. In turn, Scorpio needs to give Pisces the freedom to enjoy personal interests. A Pisces can show a Scorpio that flexibility can be fun and exciting, that compromise can be reached without a big fight or struggle. The energies of a Scorpio and a Pisces feed off of one another's energy well, making for a powerful and emotionally satisfying union. <br>  <br>  What's the best thing about a Scorpio-Pisces love match? Their similarly intense emotional natures, their shared sensitivity to the undercurrents of life, to the more ethereal magic of love. This is a relationship of harmony and fulfillment. Scorpio and Pisces both live empathetically and seek true, profound commitments, and this connection will keep the ties strong and their love enduring.|`|4P9no5CTaa	When these two connect for the first time, sparks will fly and both might feel they have met a soul mate. There will be a deep, unexplained mystical connection when they get to know one another and start dating.<br>  <br>  Pisces represents Scorpios fifth house of love and sex. This could be love at first sight. Many relationships and marriages take place when these two fall in love. Both will remain loyal, committed and be highly understanding of each other. This could be the one you have been waiting for, Pisces! Pisces and Scorpio are very mesmerizing water signs and capable of captivating each other. Sexually they couldn’t have found a more compatible partner. The need to express love will be felt very strongly by both parties and sex will be exotic, erotic and intoxicating.<br>  <br>  Memories of this attraction linger in both Scorpio and Pisces minds long after their romance is over. Don’t let a bad day ruin your chances for long-term love. <br>  <br>  4 hearts|`|spo9KBRpaa	Chemistry and compatibility come naturally when a Scorpio and a Piscean get together and from a relationship.<br>  Making a perfect duo, they complement each other very well.<br>  While the Fish can pacify the Scorpion of the tension and the turmoil which he often comes across, the latter's intense passion and possessiveness is sure to bring him a feeling of security.<br>  Since both are intuitive in nature, they will read each others mind, needs as well as fears very well.<br>  This brings in a lot of understanding in the love match, which makes life easier for both of them. <br>   <br>  It is known that the Fish lives in a dreamy world of his own, which is full of fantasies and fancies.<br>  And a Scorpion would happily fulfill his whims and desires.<br>  The latter would also help the Piscean realize his dreams and make them come true.<br>  There would be intense emotions and great intimacy in the relationship.<br>  Both of them would share a harmonious one bond, full of contentment, fulfillment and satisfaction.<br>  Their bonding would be strong, physically, emotionally and psychologically. <br>  <br>  Scorpio Man & Pisces Woman<br>  The chemistry between a Scorpio man and a Piscean woman is visible from day one of their relationship.<br>  There is an unknown spark that lightens both of them and sustains the compatibility forever.<br>  Theirs is an everlasting relationship, full of love, romance and intimacy between the Scorpio male and the Piscean female.<br>  Both would dwell in each other’s heart, with feelings of passion, loyalty, truthfulness and closeness overflowing.<br>  The couple would be a mirror to each other - knowing what the other feels even before the person has communicated.<br>  Things would come naturally to both of them.|`|d9hzMrzwaa	it tends to be good.

FRE2gov3aa	Geez whenever anyone one says anything negative about Esther everyone jumps on them. I know she has been on the show a long time but come on.<br>  <br>  I do agree with you completely! She looks terrible with those teeth and that make up! <br>  <br>  And she is annoying as hell!! <br>  So naive and stupid.<br>  <br>  She seems like she is a nice person but she just gets on my nerves.|`|C3yO4HYUaa	I don't think she needs a makeover. The only thing that really sticks out is her teeth, but I wouldn't have surgery on that. <br>  Her face looks pretty tight which makes us think she has had some work. I think she looks fine personally.<br>  Everyone has flaws and the actors/actresses get the butt of it because we see them so much.|`|AA11111233	She is very pretty, but maybe they could do more with her hair, and maybe give her more elegant clothes.  Of course, Esther pales in comparison to how crappy Sharon looks... that nasty stringy stripper hair.|`|EzZk2pyNaa	No I just think she needs an intelligence make-over.|`|17d2bf173d4736ad8ae99a2e1672a131aa	OH YESSSSSSSSSS!<br>  THE WIG IS OUTDATED, the make up just limits and the wardrobe shows what she should hide! But remeber she is a nouveau riche and has worn a uniform most of her life!!! Her duaghter works in the fashin field no??? It's her fault!|`|lGdzb8aqaa	her mouth is terrible, reminds me of Micheal Jackson's bad surgery, I hate to see her smile, the rest of her is passable.|`|uKXgg9heaa	OMG! I just wrote that on another post! She looks a crazy, hot mess! That neck needs major surgery as well.|`|VAp5ICaBaa	Those teeth are just awful I definitely know what you mean|`|ce35927379e187a9a9405823379c0faaaa	She's supposed to look the way she looks. She's grown up on the show, but not where love is concerned. Esther falls hard for the wrong men, and the writers do not want to make her more intelligent than her station allows. I think the actress is really beautiful, but she's playing down the character.|`|qPCXsXfNaa	I think she looks fine, for the most part. She does need a real man though. Someone who actually likes her and not using her.|`|9FCxm8qJaa	I think she needs counseling more than a make-over.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I agree, I like Esther, but she is looking like a clown.|`|df7eb800ff0d3d2aec218aae79b6f9cfaa	I will have to take a closer look at her.|`|CpzlUpEnaa	Yeah she does.<br>  lol she looks abit old|`|jpWtZUEqaa	And that nose, my goodness. I liked her alot better when she was a servent who was seen but not heard.|`|QeALCWbqaa	no

My favorite was twilight because that is the birth place of a story about true love, and breaking dawn because so much happened in the book and its amazing. <br>  3. I can't choose. <br>  4. My favorite scene was the baseball scene. <br>  5. I liked the movie it was fun to watch but the book was better. <br>  6. Team Edward...he seems so much better for bella<br>  7. I have not read her other books except the twilight series<br>  8. The super speed and strength would be awesome and to live forever<br>  9. Vampire, werewolves can't have extra abilites like reading minds or seeing the future. <br>  10.

Jasper or Emmett.<br>  Jasper because he is so different. He tries so hard to be good at a lifestlye, and i can kind of relate in a way.<br>  Emmett because he is funny and very protective.<br>  <br>  2. Twilight. <br>  This was the book that introduced us to these characters that we all obsess over and love now. It's great :)<br>  <br>  3.New Moon.<br>  I didn't like that Edward left, made me cry.<br>   <br>  4. The baseball scene was perfect. Ashley as Alice doing the dance moves.<br>  <br>  5. I liked it, it wasn't that bad. I think it could have been better, but it was good. The actors were perfect though. Robert is gorgeous, Kristen is amazing(I've loved her since 'Speak'), Ashley, Kellan, Jackson, Peter, Billy, Taylor - all amazing.<br>  <br>  6. Edward. Because he belongs with Bella. He's the one she's supposed to be with. <br>  <br>  7. Yes, I read the host. It was pretty amazing too. She's a very talented writer. <br>  <br>  8. If it was a Cullen vampire, maybe. <br>  <br>  9. Vampire. Strong. Fast. Special. Who wouldn't want to be one? :)<br>  <br>  10. I've read the whole series multiple times. :)<br>  and the draft of midnight sun. <- which was amazing, of course. It would have been a terrific book :)|`|MQd6WSh6aa	1. Alice is my fav character.Because she is optimistic and nice.<br>  <br>  2.Eclipse<br>  <br>  3.New moon<br>  <br>  4.When there playing baseball.That seems so cool.<br>  <br>  5.I liked the movie twilight. Because it has action and adventure.<br>  <br>  6.Edward.because he's a vampire and robert pattison is a good actor like taylor lautner(jacob) but more expereinced.<br>  <br>  7.NO<br>  <br>  8.YES,i wouldnt want to be a mosnter.But having those cool powers would be awesome.<br>  <br>  9. A vamp because they live forever and they dont sleep.<br>  <br>  10. I finished reading all the books and i might read all over again, those books are addicting<br>  <br>  HERE IS SOME SECRET INFORMATION:<br>  new moon the movie should be released on nov.20,2009..<br>  Eclipse should be released on june.20,2010<br>  <br>  thats all i know and taylor lautner(jacob) had to add on 30 pounds and turn it into muscle for the movie in new moon|`|TuygBbDAaa	1. who is your favorite character?why?<br>         Edward, because i like how he is towards girls and how polite he is and i like robert pattinson :D<br>  <br>  2.

Jacob or Edward?why?<br>            Edward because when i first saw the movie and read the book i loved him because of who he is.<br>  <br>  7.did you read Stephanie meyers other book, The Host? was it good?<br>             No i have not but that is actually my next book. I am getting it from my friends mom :D<br>  <br>  8.If you could would you be a vampire and why?<br>          Maybe, its a tough question because one you would be with another vampire if you choose then you can be with them forever and no because i would not be able to tell anyone you are and then you would never age so you really cant keep that secret.<br>  <br>  9. would you rather be a vampire or a werewolf?why?<br>  Vampire because it would be too hairy to be a werewolf and you could become gorgeous and stay the same your whole life...<br>  <br>  10.what book are you up to?what part in the book are you up to?<br>  I am finished with all of the books unfortunatlly :(|`|joLnoshKaa	1. Alice because she is just so cool, plus she is an essential character. She's the light person in the group.<br>  <br>  2. I would have to say 'Breaking Dawn' because 'Twilight' was just the kind of introduction. 'Breaking Dawn' is the perfect ending to the perfect series, it makes them seem so real, like I could see them down the street and be perfectly fine with it. <br>  <br>  3. New Moon' was just sad, it really pissed me off. <br>  <br>  4. My favorite scene was when Alice and everyone came to Bella's rescue, and then Alice totally twisted the dude's head...:)<br>  <br>  5. I liked everything except that Robert was cast as Edward, but seeing as I can't think of anyone age appropriate to be cast ( the Rock is just too old) I got over it. <br>  <br>  6. Edward all the way. Vampires are too cool...<br>  <br>  7. I didn't know she had another book...wait...I think I read that. I didn't know she wrote it. I enjoy books, and yes. It was great.<br>  <br>  8. I would be a Vampire...I don't really know why, but if I had the choice, I would be. <br>  <br>  9. Vampire...I've got asthma and can't run all the time. lol. But, for real, I couldn't take being in everyone's head and they in mune. That's just rude. Change form and then talk, or use a cell phone.<br>  <br>  10. Oh, I'm waiting on Edward's side of the story...|`|nRYVWkpEaa	1. Hm, Probably Edward, because he cares for Bella so much, and he'd do anything for her.  He's very under control, and just, I don't know, wouldn't you LOVE to be with someone who was almost "all-knowing?!"<br>  2.New Moon is my favorite, because even though I'm officially Team Edward, I absolutely loveeee Jacob (as well as Taylor himself, lol).  I would so marry him.  Jacob is just soooo sweet in this book.<br>  3. Least favorite?  Probably Breaking Dawn - simple - not enough action =/ lol, but I still liked it a lot :)  Despite the popular opinion.<br>  4. Sooo many favorite scenes.  I LOVE when Bella and Edward are "public" and they walk into the school from the car together - I love when he's finally telling her about himself, and he kinda pushes her up against that rock wall in the forest, and says "tell me what you're thinking"  & in the car, alice and jasper hold hands, and when Bella first goes to the Cullen house (that whole kitchen scene<3) and of course, the baseball scene:)!<br>  5.I LOVED the movie.  I think they did really well with what they had.  They got it all of the important parts, the casting was mostly excellent, and ... I don't know, it was just great!! lol.  It was a little choppy, but whatever.<br>  6. Team Edward - I'd feel sooo safe and loved with him - Plus, you'd get to love him FOREVER!<br>  7.  I did NOT read the Host, I've only heard of one person who didn't really like it.  Everyone else seems to enjoy it a lot.<br>  8.  Vampire.   I don't know.  I've thought about this.  Probably, only cause you can technically choose how long you get to live.  You'd be super beautiful, super smart, and super strong.  Sure in order to die would be veryyy painful, but I think it'd be pretty cool.<br>  9.  I don't know actually.  Possibly a werewolf, because your life would be more the same as a human, in comparison to being a vampire.  It would be a little bit easier I think (unless of course you get really mad =/)<br>  10.  I'm finished with the books :)  & no, I haven't read them multiple times, I just can't do that lol.  I tried reading Twilight again, but I don't like knowing what's going to happen.<br>  .goodday:).|`|nFakIvgoaa	take this twilight quiz i made and answer each question and explain. <br>  1. who is your favorite character?why?  <br>  Edward.

Which book is your favorite twilight,new moon, eclipse,or breaking dawn? <br>        Eclipse. Hands down. There is so much drama. And action. And excitement. And I love the moment when Bella realises she's in love with Jacob as well, not because I love Jacob, but because it reflects something similar in my own life. I can relate.<br>  3. what is your lest favorite book out of the whole series?<br>       Uhhhh..

Wasnt as good as the Twilight Saga, but interesting.<br>  8.If you could would you be a vampire and why?<br>        No, I dont think so. I'd rather just be human than have to struggle so hard against my own nature, even if it meant living forever.<br>  9. would you rather be a vampire or a werewolf?why?<br>      Hmm since I said I dont want to be a vampire, that leaves werewolf, doesnt it?

BhQSTvLsaa	Shoot em' both for the hell of it!|`|EggNmoRvaa	When I was 6 yrs old, a dog crapped in front of our house and My mother knew who's dog it was, she scooped it up on a paper towel and walked across the street and put it on the steps so that the owner would step in it.[ she did this after dark so that they didn't see her do it]Well you guessed it, they step in it and the language wasn't so nice. We just watched out the window. Well the dog never did it again in front of our house.|`|ff8f1f5e6ae77b2318640fce7787a746aa	Owner is in charge and responsible for their dog; even their feces?|`|HDqOXDFIaa	Shoot them both in the @ss with a BB Gun!! They'll both get the message!|`|3694eca278728fd0a36c2ea7419c2fd1aa	lol poor u<br>  bt its the owner fault the dog aint gonna pick up its own poop|`|pfUOkdahaa	You can fine the owner for this offense by calling the police stations non-emergency phone number and tell them the info they will ask for when you report this offense.|`|f6wT7ZASaa	hah. well you could shoot them, but you might get in trouble. lol. i would perhaps tell the owner to stop letting his dog crap all over your part of the side walk ! :DD|`|s3QWedUFaa	both, but the dog first; in front of the owner.|`|547Ln6rNaa	Just get a bag and go remove it before you forget it's there and skid over in it going to work tomorrow.|`|eDq5eLtiaa	make the owner eat the poo|`|a31kUn1Naa	Owner!<br>  <br>  He is supposed to poop scoop.|`|ff772a25081c886385c2eb6a501e148aaa	Watch where you step or you'll soon be in deep Doo-Doo.|`|grifjdr0aa	I have 5 pits living next door and they all crap in my yard.  Grrrrr.<br>  <br>  It' ain't worth going to jail for, but it's the owner's fault, not the dogs.
3NLThcMUaa	Lola Caricola
NGNeT3rYaa	That is what I was thinking too. He is not the same guy that he once was. That has to be the explanation. I would hate to think Ryan was just stupid, insensitive or whatever we want to call it!|`|d2RV8HTmaa	Ryan is acting like I remember the old Ryan acted back when he first came to PV.  He was pretty much a jerk.  Remember he just bolted on his motorcycle and let Kendall think he was dead?  And how ironic is it that now Greenlee seems to possibly have done the same thing!  But he is acting like everyone else caused her death.  Everyone!<br>  <br>  I'm not liking Ryan's attitude these days.|`|AA12390047	Ryan has always been selfish and it's always all about HIM.  I cracked up when he told Jesse to arrest Zach for murder.  Talk about over-acting and over-reacting!  You pose a good question.  I don't think he recovered from his brain injury at all.  He just regained his memory.|`|D3Fyxj0raa	i was thinking the same thing i cant stand the new ryan with his holey ur than thou act|`|fTDLUe8daa	wow if i didnt watch this show and if you didnt mention all my children i would think you were talking about a real persons life. he didnt really have this trouble and have them work it in to the show did he? ha ah|`|Zss0O9tjaa	Ryan is suffering from way more than a brain injury. As sexy as he is, I think it's time for Cam to go on vacation. We could use a little break...|`|75354f898ff7737b3aacdf85ed7acf69aa	He has probably never really recovered. Has anyone else besides me noticed that when he talks now he sounds just like Kevin on The Office?|`|AA11451041	Ryan has his own zip code!!  He is just plain annoying.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	You make a good point. He hasn't been quite the same since then. Maybe it is still affecting him. That would give him a good excuse for some of his more ridiculous behavior.|`|AA12319351	I doubt that he was ever really normal. His character is getting weirder and weider every day. Today he acted like a demented person with Opal trying to get in touch with Greenlee. It really is sickening. The writers are going nuts with him, having him blame all his problems on everyone and not taking the blame for anything that has happened. If Ryan had just kept his mouth shut and not jumped to conclusions like he did, Greenlee would probably still be alive and they would have to recast her again. Maybe the writers should put Ryan in Oak Haven for a while and see what happens.
y6wikiJDaa	In my experience, they've always been good. Except oral. He sucked at that. But he was a Virgo Mars, so maybe it was a sanitary issue. Otherwise very passionate.|`|AA10197672	Scorpios, once they feel the love from you, and trust you, consider yourself the luckiest man alive as they will do anything to keep you happy! They are insanely passionate, they will do anything for the one they love and will never stop pleasing! However, you play em, you take them for granted and if they feel they've been used, watch for that tail!...|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	My Scorpio ex sucked in many other areas of the relationship but he was awesome in bed. Always "aroused" and ready to go lol. I'm sure there are some that suck though. It wouldn't be possible for ALL Scorpios to be passionate and great at sex.|`|872fcc76954a83920779a9df510b118baa	it;s very possible because of insecurities they can be actually very selfish and self centered in the bedroom.  they say Capricorns are cold but the best love I'd have is from a Capricorn Sun (Taurus Moon, Virgo Rising)  all the fixed signs sometimes like to act immoveable like a rock, a very very heavy rock.<br>  <br>  but in Scorpio's case I'd say it has more to do with selfishness.  Just watch their responses.|`|ed3eK4mHaa	YES, I have been with the Scorpio male. Everything says he is so sultry, so passionate, and how he will just fulfill your wildest dreams, but the one I was with was boring, lacking in passion, self centered, and horrible HORRIBLE in the bedroom. His kisses were bad as well. He just didn't know what in the world he was doing, and he was 45 years old at the time and had been married before. I feel sorry for his poor exwife. Hope she found someone good!|`|4esOOErCaa	yes. my first girlfriend was a scorpio<br>  but like, we were 18 at the time and young and inexperienced so she may have changed<br>  <br>  we lost our virginity to each other.. she just lay there literally.. didnt move.. didnt make any noise.. barely even kissed me back whenever i went to kiss her.. we only had sex about 7 times and she never got any better. she was kind of a cold person in real life as well.|`|8326e8ed18368243be0734a4088435e3aa	Lol
GcLZjfCyaa	it's quite good=)<br>  r u a beginer?!|`|qRDHEGHJaa	After    the way your moving tonight put                                             your looking so very tight just want to make this right tonight the way we are gringing on the dance floor             rymes and sounds better
hqA9rzE5aa	Its good if your into those types of songs but I happen to like more meaning, romantic lyrics where as those are about basically grinding and groping. But everyone has their own opinions about their kinds of music and that was mine.|`|YZddsudlaa	ha ha its umm... different but don't feel the need to make everything rhyme|`|Bf8PVFSSaa	Sucks. Very "Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch". Try getting out of the 1990s.<br>  <br>  <br>  Eat Funyuns.|`|b8VRlStoaa	yuck, you want to improve, get a bic and burn those lyrics down.
FVtAx6LLaa	He serenates a girl to Oxygen at each show. I was at the February 14 concert and he picked this tall, blonde girl. The girls he picks are usually in the front.... good luck :)|`|bKEa8oJGaa	no..he only picks pretty people
AA12390047	OMG.  That just happened this morning.  You can tell when they only have one cup each in front of them and no newspapers.<br>  And they didn't say a word about the Oscars or what they did last night or over the weekend.  I HATE that.|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	then they act all interested in their mindless chatter, intently listening LOL|`|BwHoLEHvaa	I don't understand how these people get these talk shows & they're not there half the time.  I'm so sick of watching reruns on both "Live With Regis & Kelly" & "Oprah" just came back from a break (again) last Friday.<br>  <br>  I just don't get how they can keep doing that!  How many of their reruns are we supposed to watch?!|`|YHvKLeilaa	I hate that show!!!!|`|VAp5ICaBaa	Yes I know I guess they just figure were too stupid to notice|`|EPPb5pRBaa	yeah, it is so stupid...

JKQGy2aZaa	no real guys arent like that<br>  <br>  yeah and i wish that girls school unaforms were as as hot as they are in manga but thats never goin to happen|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Its the ideal dream for most fangirls.<br>  <br>  In the real world, you just have to go with what you see. You can't always base your ideal kind of guy on real males.<br>  <br>  Its sad because every fangirl is just picky.|`|UepGEiR9aa	you'll find one eventually, i'm sure....and if he has a brother, call me. XDD<br>  <br>  i wonder myself if some guys in reality are like anime guys...|`|yMjocqmUaa	There is no such thing as loving caring real guys, that is impossible. :[ I don't know how they can be so perfect. <br>  <br>  I'm actually in love with someone that everyone hates...(In the anime anyway xD) -sigh- I love Sunohara xD He's so funny =3|`|6rR7LTl1aa	That basis is idealized fantasy.<br>  <br>  It's the same basis that spawned the female animated traits of huge @-eyes, impractical hairstyles, and massive, gravity-defying breasts.<br>  <br>  You have to understand that many Japanese are somewhat starved for these things.|`|5O7op0oIaa	They have romantic anime? I thought it was mostly tentacle rape, and stuff....<br>  <br>  <br>  Maybe my mates just look at the slightly weirder sorts of anime, who knows. But no, there are no people like that. Or at least, not with so many tentacles.|`|IGu36Iwwaa	Sorry to say but there are plenty of guys who are sweet and kind and generous, but they aren't the kinda guys most girls go for.  Most guys with that kind of personality aren't going to be uber sexy bishi boys, geeks ladies, geeks.  They're emotionally deprived and desperate to be loved.  Also look at your guy FRIENDS, they don't want to be friends, unless they're gay, or pathological liars, or horribly afraid of confrontation.  No man willingly enters the friend zone.  So that super nice guy that you love hanging out with and does all sorts of stuff with you like taking you shopping and pays for everything, hes trying to send a message, sad thing for guys like that is girls DON'T really want them.  They don't want sensitive nice guys, they want men with confidence, the Alpha-Male, a man who takes charge and kicks ***.  Thus the nice guys get stuck alone, or with the girls noone else will date, further driving them down the ladder.  Oh and unfortunately, men are pigs...well apes, and heavily driven by instinct, even the nicest guy out there is still using being nice as a means for sex, yes they do want a relationship, yes they want to worship you ladies but they also want to get laid. Its just what guys do.  And guys, don't try to claim you're not, you are, you're just not putting it up front, you're just being smarter about it.  Its basic sociology.|`|2wgEsVmsaa	Lydia Ann -- shame! It's the same about the women in anime, too. If a guy said that, though, you'd be all in his face! Don't you think guys WANT to be like that? They can't compete with perfect fantasy.|`|4PmfE1Rjaa	Lol, I really doubt it hun :(<br>  <br>  Edit: Fangirls aren't the only ones that are picky, don't forget males are pretty picky themselves.|`|JjNgIyJgaa	i often wonder the same thing, and you know, i am sometimes absolutley positive that those who create it think the same...*sigh*|`|Fd0hvyoyaa	Well people make them "perfect" so there is a weird connection. You know it isn't real but when something bad happens to them you have to feel sorry for them =)|`|3NLThcMUaa	There's a reason it's called "fiction".|`|100d4d6d377b86b48c4e5e6fa8632cb5aa	there are some guys out there who are that sweet...you just have to wait and find them|`|dpAD1KoEaa	yes, but alas, we are no where near as good looking or smart.|`|m0KleJrvaa	I could wonder the same about why don't the girls look like anime girls. Lust from Full Metal, The main villain from Afro Samurai, Officer Jenny from Pokemon, Sailor Moon, etc|`|6DMhG4Oaaa	Anime guys seem to be much better then real guys because they're not the real guys. They are just made up cartoon characters of what every women wants in a man.

Do you get along with our opposite sign, Virgo?<br>  Yes, in fact I can usually get along well with anyone if I try. Right now, a Virgo guyfriend of mine has a crush on me. ): I feel bad for him, too bad I'm taken, he's really nice.<br>  <br>  4. Do you get along with other Water Signs (Cancer, Scorpio)<br>  Yes. ^_^ My love is a Scorpio.. and we get along so well. I've never be so close to or open with anyone. I also have a Scorpio friend, and he's nice.. and a Cancer friend. He's very sarcastic, and can seem mean, but he's quite nice beneath the shell. :)<br>  <br>  5. Do you get along with the other Mutable Signs (Virgo, Gemini, Sagittarius)?<br>  Virgo.. same as I said before, and I have a Sagittarius friend. :) He's cool.. a bit insane and hilarious. I haven't seen him for so long though, I hope to see him again soon. My ex was a Gemini.. we used to get along very well, but then he tried to make me do things I didn't want to do, and I got frightened and had an emotional breakdown...<br>  <br>  6.

4imsjgE2aa	"The Wind That Blew My Heart Away"<br>  <br>  Season: 3 - Episode: 13<br>  <br>  First Aired: 2/1/200<br>  <br>  Nathan and Haley are eating and he notices she is wearing her hair the same way she was the first time he tutored him. She asks him what else he remembers and he cannot help but bring up the poncho. <br>  <br>  Then he gets serious and says she wore the jeans when they fell asleep in the park together and her shoes when they got stuck at the dmv for five hours waiting for her new licence with Nathan’s last name and her shirt when she woke up and played a Black Bird by the Beatles on her guitar. He says he remember more that she thinks.|`|gs2AN4iUaa	I don't know but the best place to look would probably be here..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.oth-music.com/azlist.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.oth-music.com/azlist.html</a>
