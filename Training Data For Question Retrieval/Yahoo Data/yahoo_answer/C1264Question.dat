20081120054441AAnW9uX	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	What is the definition of a disease, and specifically a mental disease? Has science truly failed?	I think this is the biggest failure of science and generally the world. It is full of imperfections, even though religion is not a better alternative.      But, what can you define as a disease; and what can you not? First of all, we have to realize that all humans are different physically. But they should be treated equally on moral basis, and on the basis of humanity (whether its gay ppl, straight ppl, women, old ppl; they should be treated equally on moral grounds).      Because people are different physically; they exhibit different behavior due to the chemistry of their body. Here is where the tricky part comes. What can you categorize as an illness/disease/disorder and what can you not? This is the biggest failure of science: why do you need to categorize things into illnesses and non-illnesses? It is clear you are letting your bias through. Modern feminists define rape that is only committed by a man on a woman. So there come the discrepancies. Why can you not accept behavior that everyone's behavior is deviant from one another. Why do we have to claim somethings are anomalies, and some are not? I know pedophilia and rape is wrong, but can you categorize is as an illness/disease/disorder? Do we have any proof that pedophilia and rape are not illnesses/diseases/disorders? Is there any proof that homosexuality is not an illness/disease/disorder? I dont think so.       So why do we have to say that pedophilia and rape are done intentionally, when they could very well be 'illnesses'. And how can we say homosexuality is not a disease/disorder when it could be?      The fact is that these are faulty premises. We cannot categorize things into illnesses/diseases/disorders. Everyone is different from each other physically and psycologically. That is the best way to deal with things. Science cannot even come to a consensus when (at what time period) a child in a mother's womb is alive; or whether abortion is murder or not (after what stage). So i think science has failed in that aspect.

Int ( dt/sqrt(x^2-4x+40))      Let's work with the denominator for now: (x^2-4x+40)   To make the square i look at (x^2-4x) so have to add 4 to this for the square.  (x^2-4x+4) - 36.    So I chose to substitute U=x-2 to make the denominator sqrt(U^2-6^2)   This is the identity sqrt(x^2-a^2) so now I have    u=6(sec(U))    du=6(ln|secU+tanU|)   sec^2 - 1=tan^2      so now i get completely jumbled up   I know that du i wrote has no merit in this problem.       i think i should end up with 1/(sqrt(tan^2)   so i have int(1/tan)=ln(sinu)       then i input ln(sin(6secU))   =ln(sin(6sec(x-2)))      This isn't correct can anybody throw me a tip?

A thruster expels gas through a nozzle, which results in the application of a force to the satellites. To make on change, the satellite fires three thrusters at the same time. Thruster A exerts a force of 20 N directed to the right. Thruster B exerts a force of 30 N directed to the right at an angle of 30 degrees above the horizon. Thruster C exerts a force of 20 N directed straight up.       a. Graphically add the forces in the order A+B, then add the result to C. This result is the vector sum A+B+C      All I got so far is a triangle!

20071221074817AAWeTHy	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Quali sono i punti deboli della teoria dell'evoluzione di Darwin?	Questa teoria è spesso criticata da persone incompetenti, che alle volte non conoscono Darwin se non per sentito dire...   Infatti, molti dicono che un punto debole della teoria dell'evoluzione darwiniana sarebbe quello di affermare che l'uomo discende dalla scimmia. Niente di più falso! Darwin non ha mai detto che l'uomo discende dalla scimmia (è un'accusa mossa da una parte della chiesa per alimentare la disinformazione). Egli ha semplicemente scritto che l'uomo e la scimmia hanno un antenato comune.   Altri, dicono che un punto debole di questa teoria è che non spiega l'origine della vita. E allora? Non era un proposito di Darwin spiegare l'origine della vita, suo proposito era spiegare come la vita si è evoluta nel nostro pianeta.   Ora, da voi, vorrei affermazioni intelligenti e sensate che riescano a mettere in difficoltà la teoria dell'evoluzione di Darwin.   Grazie a tutti

20090304090533AAH9rX0	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Seeing different colours through the eyes of another (my theory)?	I know this has been debated before by scientist and they often come to the conclusion that another person looking at one colour and another person looking at the same colour will always be perceived the same. "Blue" is "blue" for everyone, “blue” does not look "red" to someone else and "purple" to another as long as they have proper eyesight.       The evidence often given by scientist that say all people see the same colours, is basically the human anatomy of the eye (with the lenses and such) and physics in terms of colour, light, wave length, etc, which indeed everyone will see the same thing through this fact. That is, if you were to take the consciousness of one person with perfect colour vision and put them in another body with perfect colour vision, colours would still be the same, which is very much a true statement.      Culturally we may associate "blue" with calmness/tranquillity/etc  and someone who sees "blue" as, for example, "red" will also associate their version of "blue" (even though they perceive "red") the same as the cultural norm.       Through the physical science of anatomy and physics, we know this is not possible, but what if it’s the mind perceiving the “contradicting” colours? What if the reason you stick my consciousness into the body of anyone with proper eyesight will project the same colours as they are supposed to be, because that is how my mind perceives them? Beyond the physical sciences, what if my mental perception and manifestation of such memories and associations, in terms of colours, were different to that of another person, even though our cultural colour association is the same? In other words, even if my mind ‘receives’ the same wave lengths of light and such, my mind may ‘interpret’ these differently to another person’s minds, giving me a unique colouration of the world around me.      Is this a viable argument for the case of “one person perceiving a colour differently to another person”? I want to hear other peoples’ thoughts on my theories with their feedback and criticism. Truthful and brutal is usually said to be the best criticism, but please try to be nice about it.      I understand I have a “flowery” wording style, which can often make it hard to understand what I’m trying to say, but please bare with me, lol.

You dilute the sample 1:100, and then 1:100 again, and finally you dilute the sample an additional 1:3.  You add 0.5 ml of the final dilution to a plate.  Assuming that most of the cells in the original culture were living, how many colony-forming units do you expect to count on your plate the next day?
20090304085920AAn1B67	Science & Mathematics;Other - Science	The most fare out invention of all time. can it be real?	what i hope to get out of this blog are some theories of such technology existing.  It was a massive mile wide and mile long "stain glass window" with all the optics of a telescope or microscope. It aligned with the sun and focused its power into a point like a magnifying glass. Looking forward, back, left, and right in all 4 dimensions opening a prism into a different dimension. suddenly the dream ended and i thought i was dead. the vision was like falling through a kaleidoscope with complex geometric patterns moving in syncronistic order through space. Thinking i could never go this fare and come back to tell of this dream. I awoke checking if i was still alive.        A black hole's eminence space, time and energy is contracted into a point like a magnifying glass. All astrophysicist know that the other half of this energy can not be contained without resulting in a release.   There is a large amount of energy that has transformed into a worm hole, or a portal into a different dimension.

A hunter is standing on flat ground between two vertical cliffs that are directly opposite one another. He is closer to one cliff than the other. He fires a gun and, after a while, hears three echoes. The second echo arrives 1.93 s after the first, and the third echo arrives 1.47 s after the second. Assuming that the speed of sound is 343 m/s and that there are no reflections of sound from the ground, find the distance (in m) between the cliffs.
