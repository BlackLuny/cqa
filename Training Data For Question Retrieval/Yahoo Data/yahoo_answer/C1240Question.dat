20090222201625AAUN3F8	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Why does America have such a hard time accepting evolution?	I'm an American and I always hear other Americans going, "it's just a theory! why can't they teach the other theory, creationism, too?!"      Now, evolution is a fact as far as a theory of natural origins can be a fact. It is a scientific "theory" in the same way gravity is a scientific "theory".      Only 40% of American adults accept evolution while most European countries and Asian countries had around an 80% acceptance rate. Only Turkey is lower than America with the acceptance of evolution. Is this just a problem with our education system or is it a deeper, cultural problem?      Discuss.

20090222201548AA10uMI	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Is it true extroverts don't do well in engineering profession?	According to this CareerCritique review      I've worked for many types of companies from oil and gas to defense contractor. Right now I'm a mechanical design engineer.            I've noticed being an outgoing person as an engineer is not received well. This is the only profession I know of that operates like this. Extroverts equals bad. Keeping your head down and mouth shut is good. This sucks for me as I've always been a social guy. I'm unhappy but not willing to take the risk to jump into another career because I have a family to support. Engineering has been one of the worst decisions of my life. If you're considering this as a career (the degree is fine, the job is not), there are plenty of things about this job which will frustrate you.       http://www.careercritique.com/addcomment...

In my chemistry class I was asked about designing and creating and experiment that revolves around acids and bases. I dont know what to test for.. Anyone have any ideas of what I should do. This lab must revolve around either bases or acids, it can't be both acids and bases. Also it would be good if the lab/experiment could be around one or two days since my teacher only gives me two class days to do so. Also, for the lab/experiment I need to be able to record or measure something, and I need to be able to do at least 3 trials (thus,each trial can't take too long). Also its best if the acid being used or tested is HCl, or if the base being used it NaOH (and I can use different concentrations of the acid or base)

We do know that unlike European honey bees, Africanized bees, if disturbed, can bring a swarm of about 50,000 bees to sting you directly in an aggressive frenzy.   European honey bees, however, will only usualy bring 200-300 bees in a swarm to sting you if you disturb them. This is what makes Africanized bees so dangerous.

I share the same notion with them. This fascinated me to no end. Though I would also like to take this same notion and somehow link it to biophysics but when i read about what biophysicists do it sounds boring to me. I am also not that big on math but physics is so cool to me. Please give me info that would really help. Thanks!

I can never get them right. So can anyone give me some tips or anything that might help me do better in physics?   Your help would be greatly appreciated!!!   :)

Oil is being pumped continuously from a certain oil well at a rate proportional to the amount of   oil left in the well; that is,  , where  y  is the amount of oil left in the well at any time  t.  Initially there were 1 000 000  gallons of oil in the well, and  6  years later there were  500 000 gallons remaining.  It will no longer be profitable to pump oil when there are fewer than 50 000 gallons remaining.      (a) Write an equation for y, the amount of oil remaining in the well at any time  t.      (b) At what rate is the amount of oil in the well decreasing when there are 600,000 gallons of oil remaining ?      (c) In order not to lose money, at what time  t  should oil no longer be pumped from the well?

20090222222010AA3VRCK	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Why does salt water taste salty (haha let me explain)?	When you eat solid crystal salt, it tastes salty. But then you dissolve the salt in water, and it's not salt anymore as much as it is Na and Cl particles in water. So why does it still taste salty? Is the taste of salt actually the taste of sodium and chloride? If I were to lick a piece of sodium metal (not that I would since that would be incredibly stupid), would it taste "salty?"      Also, potassium chloride is eaten by people on low-sodium diets as a table salt substitute. That still tastes salty, so then maybe taste of salt is actually the taste of chlorine, since that is the common element of table salt and potassium chloride?

I have a pretty good understanding of what the slingshot effect and and Conservation of Momentum is pretty basic.       But in regards to this problem: The gravitational slingshot effect. The planet Saturn moving in the negative xdirection at its orbital speed (with respect to the Sun) of 9.6 km/s. The mass of Saturn is 5.96 × 10^26 kg. A spacecraft with mass 825 kg approaches Saturn. When far from Saturn, it moves in the +x-direction at 10.4 km/s. The gravitational attraction of Saturn (a conservative force) acting on the spacecraft causes it to swing around the planet and head off in the opposite direction. Estimate the final speed of the spacecraft after it is far enough away to be considered free of Saturn’s gravitational pull.      okay. basics taken a step further. Both energy (this is considered an elastic collision) and momentum are conserved.    But I'm still confused on finding the speed of the aircraft? How do I set this up mathematically?
