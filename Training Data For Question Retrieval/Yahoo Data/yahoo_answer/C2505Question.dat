My interlude in space this time was brief   I was to watch an interstellar game   The winning team defied my firm belief   And put the losing team to dire shame   When it was over I felt sweet relief   The rest of my visit was pretty tame   It seemed like entertainment was my job   So, grabbed a couple fellers, Jim and Bob      While something I was trying to arrange   This cute Martian couple up and eloped   I thought there sense of timing outright strange   This whole charade was harder than I’d hoped   Overhearing words furtively exchange   My ride home those two renegades had scoped   Now my hope of leaving here by midnight   Was waning as my narcoleptic sight      They read my thoughts, I received my answer   The assured me I would not be lonely   They would send to me a private dancer   Who would cater to my every only   He was cute and said his sign was cancer   And if I lived on mars, he would phone me   Sleepy now, he began to rub my feet   As I dozed off, I thought how very sweet      Must have brought me home, while sleeping   As I wakened in my own bed at home   With my cancer Martian slyly creeping   To his spaceship out there, beyond my gnome   And the light from it was brightly seeping   Through tiny cracks like sun on shiny chrome   I stretched and pondered the bizarre events   This will defy in daylight, common sense

God, please tell me, why won't I wake up!? When did I fall asleep, when did this utter relapse first occur? My being is crying for understanding, it's crying for you! I need my savior.   But I can't seem to find you, I Still cling on to this human pride, this optimum desire. I know that I need you but the problem is I'm not willing to change.   I'm so lazy, so arrogant! How can you love such a selfish thing as I am?! I want the easy way out, to gain comprehension without working for the knowledge. But aren't we all like that? Isn't that what we all want? We're all sinners in the end, all equal in the grace and love of You. Or at least that's what I want to believe.   Even now I don't want to change the way I've been living even if it is the wrong way to live. I want my freedom, I want my heart.   I want love.   ....Where am I? Who is this holding the pen? Nyljoe? Surely not. But he's somewhere in this body, this Earthly shell.   I must find him.

Hey everyone, I have a propane bottle (a little smaller than a 2 liter soda bottle) with a blow-torch tip, with an adjuster to let out a certain amount of propane. I light the end with a flint or a lighter. If I purchased the right glass rods, would I be able to use that as a glass-blowing torch to practice to see if I would like to get into the industry? Also, where would I be able to purchase beginners rods, for making things such as tobacco pipes, water pipes, as well as other items that would be sold at a tobacco store? I'm thinking about opening my own store, and have no experience at all, but am very interested in art / design. Any help would be greatly appreciated. If that blow torch wont work at all, then any links as to where I would buy an appropriate beginner glass-blowing torch would be great. If anyone has any online guides as reference to blowing pipes and such, that would be a great help too. Thanks in advance, Zach.

And in themselves their pride lies buried,   8. For at a frown they in their glory die.   9. The painful warrior famoused for fight,   10. After a thousand victories once foiled,   11. Is from the book of honour razed quite,   12. And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:   13. Then happy I, that love and am beloved,   14. Where I may not remove nor be removed.

XD lol       Sirenity’s bloodstained blade had not grown ever nearer to the raging fire burning inside her. She had no remorse for traitorous fools and no patience either. That gouge was running on empty for quite some time now. Had it not been for his actions she may have been able to keep a firm hold on her sanity, but...it had slipped, and she was growing nearer and nearer to the darkness that masked her world of light. Her destiny opened and closed many doors now. And she feared that some may never open again.    “Is he...is he, here?” She shuddered, locking an interested gaze on the shining red substance, as it made crimson trails down her blade.       “No, the-the bastard left us here! I knew he was an animal, b-but I figured he’d have the dignity to leave a sign! Or something!” Courtella hissed, watching the flames engulf the house, admiring the orange glow it reflected upon the night sky.       Sirenity, distracted by the blade, could only nod, lathering the substance on her hand absently, “J-just a taste...” She grinned, dabbing a small amount on the tip of her tongue with savage eyes and a crooked grin. Courtella could only watch in disgust, cringing at the thought.       “Enough! We have more important things to do than linger in this place! It simply reeks of betrayal!” She sneered, hoping for once Sirenity would listen, or at least care.       Sirenity scathed at the blood, spitting it out, squinting her eyes in disgust as she let the blade drop with a loud ‘clinking’ sound on that pavement.    “That is disgusting! What does he eat?” She coughed, desperately wiping it off with her hands, which made the situation worse, for they we smeared in dirt.       “Serves you right, when are you going to take responsibility? Already he has started to cover this world in shadow! Night-time was never more scarce until now, some even fear it now! Because they fear when they wake up in the morning, the sun won’t rise! You have a responsibility, you were born of fire, not of childish games!” Courtella crossed her arms, scathing, already she was becoming irritated with her, and right when she thought Sirenity had a chance of maturing.

20090128221128AANzfZL	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Why does my boyfriend ask: What do you do when your garbage cans are full?	He first asked me this in a text message, and then told me the correct answer was "You use your neighbors." When I asked why he was talking to me so much about garbage cans he didn't respond. Later he said something vague like, "You'll know what it means when your hero is in a hospital bed." He's in the Air Force, but I can't image that he would be laid up in a hospital bed anytime soon.      About a month later he quizzed me on the phone by asking the question again. When I responded with the answer "You use your neighbors," he said, "good." He refuses to tell me what this riddle means, only that when the time comes I will know. I need to know now. Any ideas?

Hoping someone would hear.    Anyone.   No one responded.   I prayed harder for his life.   No one heard my calls.   I just sat there.   Without father, without hope.   I wrote a letter.   It was two sided.   Having memories and memories that would never be on the sheet.   I threw it into a fire.   The flames flickered up towards the sky.    Hoping those flames would reach the Heavens.   Hoping I would get a sign.   Nothing.   There must be no God.   I prayed harder for his soul.   Nothing.   There was no God.    I walked away with a hole in my heart and an ache in my soul.   I’ve lost faith.   Not a sound.   Just the loud silence of nothing    But the stillness of the night.

20090128231007AANXD8o	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Could it be that he is my soul mate or what?	ok this is going to be a long written question but all details are very important..   i was raise very poorly. my father choose drugs over me. my mother men. i have been thru alot of trauma in my life. my mothers men beating me and her. i have been raped 3 times. twice as a young girl. my mother never believed me. and i dealt with the pain all alone. with this i raised myself and my seven year younger brother.   with growing up like this i became disconnected from people and i trusted noone.   but when i was 17 i meet him, we will call him boo.(its his pet name) well boo fell in love with me the moment he meet me. we dated and he did more then anyone in my life ever had. took me to school, picked me up. took me to work and picked me up. he opened every door for me. basically he would go around the world to do what ever it was i wanted or needed. but as said before i was raised without love and i had no clue that this was anything good. (and i was just 17, you young and dumb) i broke up with him and he still did all those things for me. well time went on and we both went our ways. 2 years later he called me at work and asked me to go out with him. it was like two am so we walked around wal-mart for hours talking and then we got back together. he still did so much for me and god he loved me perfectly. my friends told me he was the one. seven months down the road i was yelling at him to leave. now this is where you think i am crazy, but i was falling for him and it scared me. i had lost so much in my life and i thought if i made him go i would hurt less. not only that i did not believe in love so i had to ran(or so i thought then). when he left for about two weeks i found notes on my window. " i love you and hope you had a good day" " good morning beautiful" still i would not talk to him. about 3 days after he was gone. i was raped for the third time. the guy kicked down my front door and i froze. i could not move for the life of me. he walked toward me and took the last bit of back bone i had in me. he held me down and i screamed ( which i can do loudly) noone heard me, more or less no one cared the neighbors were home. but within ten mins of the struggle it was easier to just let it happen. i closed my eyes and i cried. i told noone of this for a year my mother would not had believed me and my friends had so much going on in there life.   i then moved on and dealt with the pain. i got in another relationship and got pregnant.(lost the baby 4mon 1week). well about three months later i woke up in a cold sweat tears running down my face and for the 1st time in my life i needed someone and that someone was my boo. from that moment on i have loved him. i never thought you could really feel from your heart. i did not know that someone could make me feel complete. i told his sister in law that i wanted to talk to him and she arranged it to happen. for the 1st time i told someone what happen and it was him i told. i told him with tears running down my face that i was so dumb and that i loved him. i thought we would try again but he had turned so cold. he played games with me. ( today i believe he was more confused) we would be talking. but dare i say we were together. he was seeing this other girl and for three months i did all i could to prove to him that i was real. he would not commit to me. after a while i just could not anymore. i drop all contact with him six months later i started working where he was working and i had no clue. we started talking again. and once again i did all i could to prove to him that i loved him truly and deeply. well we once again would not settle with just me. i broke it off again.   okay now you are going to think i must be insane but months later i was still working there but he wasn't. he walked into the superstore and i knew it b4 i seen him with my eyes. my heart felt like it was going to fall out of my chest and i became shaky and i looked up and there he was. my heart knew he was there b4 i did. another time i was taking calls from around the us for a cell phone company and every hour on the hour i got a guy with the same (of course each time a different guy) name all 8 hours of work that day almost killed me. but i got off and went to wal mart and was going to check out a phone for my little bro. i was texting a friend and not watching where i was going and i stopped two inches before i ran into him. i walk over to the phone and started reading about the phone and i swear i read the same word 7 times. i could not focus so i decided to walk around for a min in the hope of him to leave. but when i had went back he was still there.   another time i was really, really upset and i had by then not talked to him for months and he out of the blue texted me. " whats wrong? you ok" now we do not have the same friends so i know for sure he could not had heard about it plus i do not show my pain well to others. how did he know?   there was a time when he came into the store i worked at and once

20090128225026AA0vc0h	Arts & Humanities;History	Paternity issues in the mid 1600s?	So, I started this story for a writing assignment, and the plot seemed like a good idea right up until I got to the "good part," at which point it met reality and fell apart like a house of cards. LOL      This guy was cheated on by his wife. Years later she makes a deathbed "confession" (which is really one last attempt to spite him) telling him that she had a child and it wasn't his. Then circumstances lead to him meeting the child and... um. That's where I'm stuck.      There's this big inheritance at stake, and I don't think the guy wants to go by "oh, well, it sort of has my eyebrows, if you turn your head sideways and kind of squint." I also don't think I can cram any more confessions in there.      So... anything? Anything at all? Some old wives tale or something?

African tribesmen sailed large ships to the Caribbean Islands.             Europeans traveled across a landmass that connected Europe and North America.             Native Americans migrated to Asia and brought others with them when they returned.             Southeast Asians sailed across the Pacific Ocean to North America.      2)What river flows from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico, draining the area between the Appalachian Mountains and the Rocky Mountains?             Columbia River             Missouri River             Mississippi River             Ohio River      3)What is one way that the Columbian Exchange affected Native Americans?             It kept them disease free for several generations.             It brought them domestic animals they had not seen before.             They constructed oceangoing vessels modeled on the European ones.             They learned new techniques for building homes.         4) What was a major difference between the Massachusetts Bay Colony and the Rhode Island colony?             Rhode Island founder Roger Williams believed in religious toleration.             The majority of Rhode Island colonists had been born in America.             Massachusetts Bay founder John Winthrop encouraged religious diversity.             Both were founded by Puritans and were very similar.

I was just thinking about this as the other day I was at a party and met a fellow atheist philosophy major, who told me he was very interested in ethics and all small talk aside, he believed there is an objective morality. I personally am a moral relativist. I just don't understand how we could have an objective morality in a Godless world. The idea of it makes no sense to me. Maybe I'm just looking at it wrong. After all, Kant believed in it, and that it could be discovered with pure reason alone.       What do YOU believe?        (oh, and please don't say God. I already made the effort to make this hypothetical a Godless world. If you believe in God and that morals come from him then don't answer this.)

20090129004502AAnlSsl	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of this beginning to a story?	Note: It's pretty basic and with very little polishing. Also, copying it ruined all formatting, so bare with it.      The hunter was awake, but he knew that it would not last for long. Staring at the full blood moon rapidly descending in the western sky and the faint orange glow already beginning in the east, he knew that his night of enjoyment was coming to a close.    And he still hadn’t eaten.    The hunter’s stomach growled loudly as he sniffed the air. This was a dense forest. Something had to come out soon. The hunter wasn’t choosy about what he hunted tonight. He just wanted the crimson lifeblood of some creature to wet his lips.    Despite his hunger, he was still confident. He could easily take down absolutely everything that this forest had to offer. When you combine the intelligence of a human with the natural instincts of an animal, the resulting hunter has no equal.    The werewolf is that hunter. Weighing in at a five hundred and fifty pounds and standing at eight feet tall, the wolf was gigantic. The weight was not in fat, either. The wolf would have nothing to do with fat. Almost all of weight was muscle, making the creature look weaker than it truly was but allowing for more speed and agility.    The grayish fur on his back was standing on end as his seemingly pointless sniffing of the air finally paid off. A scent… no… two scents.     One was very familiar, but the hunter did not waste much time with that scent.    The other creature that dwelled in the immediate vacinity, though was exactly what the hunter had been looking for. Fresh meat and, as if to make the hunt even more enjoyable, the wolf’s superior sense of smell picked out the scent of blood on the wind.    The prey was already bleeding. A twisted smile contorted the wolf-like muzzle of the hunter as he dug his front paws into the earth in front of him. The image of this smiling monster was made all the more grotesque by the fact that the paws ended in human fingers with the finger nails sharp and pointed like that of a large canine.   Dig the fingers into the early morning earth, the hunter sprang out of concealment and raced in the general direction of the scent.

20090129021928AAgQd1C	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Any tips on writing poetry..? (poem inside)?	I used to write poetry alot when I was smaller for I had a great imagination and thought of all kinds of things. Now that I'm older, I look at the paper and I'm blank. I get "writer's block" constantly. It makes me frustrated because I used to be such a good writer (for my age, in my opinion anyway).. and now I can't write if my life depended on it.. yet I have so many things I want to write about. Love, life, happiness, heartbreak, you know.. the usual stuff.      Here is a poem I just wrote last night in a short while, and I think the only reason I finished it was because I had inspiration in front of me (my boyfriend). I know the poem sucks, and it's basically simple, or maybe not..?      He looks so peaceful   With his head on his pillow   While time just passes by   Far away he's dreaming   As I watch him sleeping   In my bed he lyes   I start to wonder   Why he's right here with me   Out of everyone else   He could do better   Lord, He could do better   It's how I've always felt   I sit and I pray   Please don't take him away   I love him with all my heart   If he ever leaves   Then right here I'll be   Dreaming we never apart      So anyways, any tips on writing poetry..? All advice will be appreciated! Thanks:)

20090129001023AAwKjQ7	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would like some feedback on a short dialog piece i have written?	basically this is a more or less philosophical exchange between a more or less pessimistic man, and a optimistic girl. their ideologies clash all the time, and this is just a short example i made in a few minutes. it starts with the girl asking the question, mid discussion. not that i purposely didn't put any in between thoughts and actions or descriptions because, as i have said, i made the dialog in a few minutes, and its just an idea right now. this can also be considered a part of one of my earlier writings, though not the same excerpt:      "are you giving me a lecture of a battle between good vs evil?"   "the thing is, people have neglected to tell that evil has already won, there was no fight, there is no battle. there is no good left to be found."   "what about me?"   "the few good left, is a dieing breed, and is overshadowed by the evil that exists. even the beauty of your light is darkened and cannot be seen through the thick cloud that has been casted."   "you know...in the darkest of our nights..event he darkest of our days..the light which we are shines the brightest."   "i think its YOU who's giving me the lecture."   "i think you might be right."   "im trying not to think."   "good. its a bad habit."          "...how come i cant see it then?"   "see what?"   "this "light" that you speak so highly of. how come i cant see it?"   "maybe its cause you turn away from it, close your eyes and shut yourself away from it. or because you run from it. maybe its cause your too scared to look into it. i don't know. its something you should be asking yourself. but i do know this..and you do too. wherever there is light. anywhere there is even the smallest source, darkness vanishes. it runs. fear strikes it, and it disappears."   "are you saying that i am this darkness? the very thing i want gone?"   "that...and imagine what would happen..imagine what it would be like, if we all chose to be the light that we are- instead of denying ourselves. imagine if we all chose to play the role of the good."   "ive learned that imagining and hoping, only leads to disappointment."   "then your denying yourself of what makes you human."

I've gotten into it from a friend who is most likely going to be famous someday and she also wants me to learn how to dance so that she can learn to dance with a partner. At the moment i can only afford to join in on her conditioning class while the rest are out of my price range. Now that i have the background out of the way, onto the question.      My main interest is Ballroom/Latin, we've somewhat found a place that has cheap lessons for that but i want to know what are my chances of getting serious and good at it at this age. For both me and my friend our goal is to get onto So You Think You Can Dance. She is making it for sure, and I'm struggling to find ways to get better. Ballroom/Latin seems like a good way to get the sexual emotion (and maybe some others) into the dance and i also want to learn to dance with someone else. The steps seem like a good way to learn movements and lifts could help my strength.      This is a very open question but does anyone have any advice for any of this?

20090129000657AAYltLX	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Would the world be a better place if Hitler had won?	Okay before you go crazy let me explain myself. I'm a nice guy. I'm all for affirmative rights and feminism and Id be one of the first people to help you if you needed it. I am not racist or sexist and I love America and I have been all around the U.S. and also to Canada, Panama, Germany, Kuwait, Dubai, and Iraq. In each place there were awesome people, people that I learned from and admired. I am not for violence and I accept ALL religions (including atheism which I consider a religion) but I am not religious myself (though I pray sometimes and think there may be a God... even though this subject is way too deep to cover here). I am only saying this to try and tame the vicious answers from people that I am expecting and also to show you I'm not stupid. Also, I am about to finish my Bachelors degree in computers (CIS).     OKAY, please for this question you REALLY need to zoom way out. Maybe even a few millennia (100 years). If Hitler (who was 100.000% pure evil) had conquered the entire world (eventually) and established a world order and abolished religions violently (actually I'm not sure about Hitler's faith but at least there would have been only one) would we not see the entire world as one and each other as neighbors and be working together as a Globe instead of living in our little lives?    Now, I need to buffer some more. Hitler would have exterminated even more people than he did (which was millions). I might not be here. You might not be here. The Jews would be dead.

20090128233244AAhOLmT	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	The power of the human imagination...?	Why is it that the human imagination is capable of creating so much more than what exists in the real world? Our minds are so ridiculously incredible it's baffling, but it seems to me that the world we live in that is so much more powerful than us should be capable of more. But it's not. Our own imagination is the most powerful thing I know of in the universe. Even if the imagination can't make the things we create tangible, we're still capable of making it. It almost seems unfair.

20090129010850AA429AX	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do I have talent or am I seriously insane?	im ten. I had my birthday a week ago.   Im just wringing a bit of a story, its going to be very cliche and im not gonna even think about the plot, what do u think of the language?      In every century, every universe there has to be a miracle. A miracle of a child seeing past the wintery cold, scorching desert and slashing of the rain. A chance to forget what had happened and see into the future a chance of improvement.   Im one of those children, my name is Nathan Sorenson. I've always been weird in my own way. I could run faster than any other boy in school, I breathe less and I happen to find a way out of everything. The part of life that I regretted the most, hated the most, was the ages of sixteen and seventeen. Maybe staring at orange leaves in a round barn at a chilly night in the middle of december wasnt the safest, but ti has always been for me. I was extra sharp, extra fast and extra strong for my age. I knew that I can beat the hell out of any burgalar that crosses me but the moment I saw its flaming red eyes, heard it jagged uneven breath and inhaled in its toxic smell I knew that I was facing something more than a burglar. I knew that standing up to this thing would only make my death even worse, I held my breath, leant against a tree and meant to say good bye to everything I knew. Memories ran into my open mind. I remembered Art, my brother, I remembered his last smile and his last words "Nathan," I would be joining him now, we both belong together. Maybe my death wasn't going to be all for the worst....    --------------------------------------...

Following the Civil War, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments were passed. What large issues did they address?             states' rights, slavery, and the Electoral College             slavery, equal protection under the law, and voting rights             voting rights, popular sovereignty, and declarations of war             impeachment, equal protection, and war reparations            62. What was the effect of the Homestead Act on western settlement?             It had little effect on western settlement, but a big impact in the South.             It brought a great number of settlers to California.             Homesteaders settled much of the Great Plains.             It slowed the building of the railroads because the best land went to homesteaders.            63. How did western settlement affect Native Americans?             It brought income, as settlers paid for their expertise.             It didn't affect them, since they remained on their reservations.             It created an opportunity for cooperation between Native Americans and settlers.             It forced them from their lands.            64. Which men were responsible for the development of the steel and oil industries in the United States?             J.P.

How did nineteenth-century railroads influence today's "corporate America"?             Railroads stressed the benefit of competition and opposed monopolies.             Railroads were the first business to raise funds by issuing stocks and bonds.             Railroads created an awareness of the importance of transportation.             Railroads brought the need for effective scheduling to the forefront.            66. What law was passed to eliminate trusts, monopolies, or any agreement that restrained trade?             Vanderbilt Banking Regulation             Rockefeller Monopoly Act             Sherman Antitrust Act             Chase Trade Restraint Agreement            67. Which organization of craft unions focused on improving wages and working conditions?             Eugene Debs's American Railway Union             Bill Haywood's Industrial Workers of the World             Samuel Gompers's American Federation of Labor             Terence V. Powderly's Knights of Labor            68. Where were nineteenth-century immigrants processed prior to entry into the United States?             Angel and Ellis Islands             Boston and New York             San Francisco and Philadelphia             Catalina and Manhattan Islands            69.

Which statement is true of relations between Native Americans and the colonies or the United States between 1607 and 1900?             Native Americans opposed European colonization at first, but in the 1800s chose to assimilate into white American culture.             The desire for land led colonists, and then the United States government and people, to push Indians off their land and destroy their way of life.             Native Americans suffered hardships when Europeans first arrived in North America, but relations improved during the 1800s.             Native Americans avoided contact and conflict with non-Indians in North America as much as possible.

20090128235632AAsnoB6	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	How do you define what a person is?	I know that's a little vague. I'm looking mostly for philosophical, psychiatric, or intuitive answers. For example, at what point would we give an artificial intelligence the status of personhood? Why are conjoined twins, who share one body, considered two persons? If we discovered extraterrestrial life, how would we recognize if they were "people?" At what point does a fetus become a person, and why? [The purpose of this question is not to address the abortion debate.]      To sum up, what criteria should be used to determine if an entity is a person? The definition should clearly and universally address questions such as the ones above.

When I strum down, the sound of the pick against the strings is really loud, kinda distorting the overall sound. When I strum up, it sounds worse. The distorting sound caused by the pick is louder, and it sounds like I'm strumming the notes slowly. How can I fix this?       Thanks in advance :)
