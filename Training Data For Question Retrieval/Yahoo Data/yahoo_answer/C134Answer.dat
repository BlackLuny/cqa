Good luck!
a0c102b8ca14a50e8e38a99b46dd5505aa	Maybe you should take her for the stories, but then if she gets up and starts running around, pick her up and take her out of there.  Explain to her as you do it, that she was expected to sit quietly and listen to the story.    Don't let her just continue to run and distract the ones who are listening.  It could be that you expected her to sit for more stories than she is able to do just yet, too.  Maybe one or two and then out if it looks like she's gonna fuss.    Two year olds are independent, learning their limits, so set some limits for her.|`|r5YAyYkLaa	Don't take her to story time until she shows the ability to sit down for an extended period of time. She just may not be interested in it at this time, and you can always try again later. The important thing is that she is exposed to reading and books, and you can do that at home. |`|q3i4oUhraa	My toddler LOVES books at home. Will sit through about six. At playgroup, she will not pay attentions at all!. I think there are just too many other things more interesting to her there. It is frustrating, because it does seem like all the other kids listen. Now I just think, oh well. She'll sit when she is ready. I would keep taking her. It is introducing her to reading, even if she really isn't paying attention!|`|0BOVOHWQaa	Do you read stories with her at home? I have a 2 year old also and we read 2-3 times a day at home. He normally doesn't have problems listening to a story, even if it isn't me who's reading it... In fact, that's the only time he will sit still. |`|RpTE8H1Kaa	maybe they don't like stories  duhhh|`|J9W2LXzCaa	My 3 year was the same way still is to a certain extent. What I have done to resolve the problem is I have enrolled her into a mommy and me preschool. Basically it is exactly like preschool accept all of the parents are also in class to help watch their child and a few others during play time. My daughter wouldn't sit still or follow direction an d after 2 week in school she began to see all the other children following rules and began to understand  that if she sits trough story time she would get to play and do crafts with the other children. Occasionally she still refuses to follow the rule and wants to do her own things but on those days she sits on a time out until she wants to follow the rules or I take her home early. I ve only had to miss class with her once. We go three days a week but you can go 5 days 2 days even one day. We enrolled through the local adult school. It really is great. I wish you the best and hope your are abe to find a program that suits you and your daughter.|`|hKYU7yxAaa	totally normal my daughter barely sit through the first page then yells out the end LOL!|`|VwMkiLFPaa	My son is 23 months old and the ONE thing holding him back from switching to the 2 yr old classrom at daycare is exactly this. I went in her classroom to say hello and I was amazed at her kids. They were all sitting in their chairs, lights off, listening to music quietly and coloring until Mommys and Daddys picked them up. She said, When your son can do this, hes more than welcome to come to my class (Were friendly so we were semi-joking) I spoke with the 2 yr old teacher and she said that even some of the new 2 yr olds still struggle with it but its something that happens in the early stages of being 2. And it helps when they can see other kids doing the same thing. So we discussed to just slowlg introduce him to things in groups with other kids. Eventually hell pick up on it    Id say to be patient. It takes time for some kids to adapt like that. If the library doesnt seem bothered with you there, Id say to keep going.     My son is a VERY active and busy little man and I cant ever imagine in my lifetime taking him to storytime at a library. LOL. So youre a few steps up on me. LOL.     Good luck! I wish I had better advice to give!  |`|AA11210211	ahh yes my son is the SAME way I have found nothing that works,so I just gave up on it,I figure when he is older I will try it again:)|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	oh wow and I thought my son was the only one!!  Just keep taking her, eventually she'll want to be like the other children and sit down to read the book together. As for now, let her be adventerous, as long as shes there and shes not interupting the book its fine.|`|AA11327039	Bring a special cup with juice that she can only have when she is in the library sitting at story time.  Bring a special bowl of snacks for her to munch on.  If she sits for 10 minutes, that's great.  Maybe she'll sit longer next time.|`|NYU37jfGaa	She obviously doesn't like story time.  Why try to make her do somethign she dislikes?  Take her somewhere where she can run around and exercise, which is what she needs at her age.  Normal two-year-olds don't go in for sitting down much.  Take her to the park instead of the library, she'll enjoy it more.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	oh dont worry, your child is most definatly not the only one who does that. i dont have kids yet but i volunteered at a place that had play times and what not every week and offered parenting classes.  cool little place.  well near the end of each play time thingy, we would have story time to kind of wind down before they went home.  there were always at least two little ones that ran around and did their own thing dispite our best efforts.  what did tend to keep them interested is if the storys were somehow interactive.  like, if there was a duck in the book, the kids would all get to go "quack quack quack"  at certain parts of the story and things like that. or if they got to shake their butts to act like ducks waddleing or something.  it didnt ALWAYS work but it significantly cut down on the ones who were more interested in toys.      sometimes two isnt quite old enough for story time though. so if you happen to catch your daughter on a good day and she is listening to you, then that would be a good day to take her to story time.  if story time happens to fall on a day where she is acting out more, maybe skip it that day, and continue in this pattern till she learns that story time is kind of a reward?    you could also ask the lady who does the reading if there are any suggestions she has, because well, she does it kind of for a living so she must know how to keep them still.  or ask the other parents at story time with you.  dont be embarassed, im sure all their kids have done it at some point too|`|R5qr96pPaa	My 2 year old would NEVER sit still for story time. I think some kids are just like this. It can be stressful, but maybe instead of story time at the library, you could joina play group. Or bring her to the park to run around with the other kids. If not, I am sure every other mother at story time knows exactly how you feel, so I wouldn't worry about it too much. |`|pX7G7Ujcaa	There isn't anything wrong with be independent, it's actually a good thing. Not everything that works for one child will work for another. I think she will be okay. Just like we adults there are some conversations that just doesn't stimulate us in the slightest so we dint engage in them.|`|AA11327878	she is not ready to sit down in a big environment for story time.  a 2 year old only has a 2 minute tension Span.  i would stop taking her to the library for this.  if you want her involved w/ other children then either take her to the park or do a mother's day out thing.  |`|DDFSITiYaa	I used to take my oldest to Gymborre when she was 2... they had a organized routine each week but my daughter would totally do it out of order... first she'd do the balls, then when all the kids came over to do that, she'd go over to the climber, when they would sing, she'd look at a book... etc.  .  I was embarrased at the time but now looking back and after 2 more kids, I relese that it is  just her way of exploring the world.  She is still like that now to some degree (she is now 8)  She doesn't always follow the crowd which I think will serve her well in life.     I'd first check with the librarian and see if it is ok that she wander around as long as she isn't disruptive.  Some kids actually do listen to the story while on the move.  If you daughter shows interest in the book later or even if you just want to meet some other moms, its perfectly fine that she explores the library and not sit at all.  She may come around or not.  Its just who she is. 
9vgZNLP8aa	My first was 5 stinking days late. I went into labor on my own and had him vaginal.

XhIYAH6Laa	I have had that since basically day 1. I am 8 weeks and I bloat mostly after dinner...so you could be pregnant...test as soon as you can!|`|9fQuzK15aa	hey, you need to stop thinking about it. Just relax. The possibility of you being pregnant seems slim, however Im unsure of other factors which may have led you to think that e.g contraception. If you are constantly aware of it every time you eat , you are probably making it a bigger deal in your head, and each time the bump may seem bigger because of this. So for piece of mind, pee on a stick!|`|efa66e2f18237473926b5cc54a4c58cfaa	Maybe you have IBS
TJ04fAgNaa	You can get pregnant if you're breastfeeding or not.  The pull out method is not a good one to use if you're not wanting to have another baby yet.  I would suggest using some form of birth control other than pulling out.|`|tShDXmgbaa	Very good chance of becoming pregnant again.  I have a neice who had a baby boy and when she went back for her 6 weeks checkup she was pregnant again which is not good on your body as it has not had time to heal itself from the previous pregnancy.|`|AA11327878	your chances of becoming pregnant again are likely.  i wished i would have waited or had protected sex between my first 2.  they are 13 1/2 moths apart.  if you don't want to be pregnant again you better be careful.  having 2 babies is very hard. i was 21 at that time.|`|3777e5fd9a70f37dacaa0f155f884bf4aa	honestly this happened to me and I ended up pregnant when my baby was 2 months old.

From the time you have a baby to your first period is the biggest fertile time.  Be careful or you are going to have another one running around.|`|ml0GGUMuaa	the chances of you getting pregnant again right after you have a baby are very high and it also depends how fertile you are. if you got pregnant fast i'm sure you might be again but if your  not try to be more careful next time good luck|`|lA4MSk2Jaa	They say the chances of a woman getting pregnant right after having a baby are higher than  if it were just any day. Be careful!!|`|zhNEgCzXaa	a REALLY good chance..its very easy to get pregnant..i heard after u have a baby you produce 2 eggs at once!!!
AA11291954	Avoid deep penetration to avoid abdominal cramps.|`|AA11308339	The abdominal cramps that can occur while having sex during pregnancy are usually from the penis hitting the cervix.  It can also be from pressure and the position you are having sex in. If it's painful you can try another position or try putting a pillow under your hips.|`|VeJH9b2yaa	not normally, the baby is fiercly protected in the womb and cannot be budged even by a fall. it could be the bowel thatis irritated as this can make cramps come on during or after sex.  how far gone are you? have youhad spotting? keep an eye on the pain as this could indicate problems. BUT not all pregnancies are pain and blood free so don't try to worry too much.|`|EF7nwvpzaa	Thats your baby saying quite poking me in the head|`|EVoNevUSaa	Unfortunatly I always get cramps after we have sex.  It has gotten to the point to where I don't want to have sex just to avoid the cramps.  Not really because of the belly being in the way and not because my desires have totally died.  Afterwards I just hurt.|`|AA10028105	yip thats normal to get cramps coz i asked my doctor and its normal but just take it easy.|`|gWGpRwt0aa	That is very normal. I had it with my 1st and 2nd pregnancy from very early on, all the way to the end.|`|xgfvUZNYaa	yea i do and they hurt really bad. i have to only do it in certain positions.|`|XFdinRWhaa	try the spoon position this helps. i use to get it all the time with all three pregnacies and my doctor told me i had a really low cervix, so thats where the pain comes from and does not cause any harm to baby. ask your partner for a back massage before to get you more relaxed too.|`|YfeqOppWaa	these abdominal cramps are completely normal, these cramps are just srong Braxton Hicks contractions which is completely normal, this is quite the reason midwives tell you to have sex to help bring on labour near the end.  Don't worry though your body will only go into labour when your body is ready and will be activated to go into labour when you have sex but only when your body is ready.  No worries xxx|`|cglqSNSTaa	yes very normal!

Clayton    and as for Elijah, Easton, and Leighton, I'm not a fan, so they go in no particular order.  I wouldn't worry about any of those being too common.  I know one little boy named Landon, one named Noah, one named Elijah, and 2 named Clayton.  Never met a Leighton or Easton|`|9lvybFqNaa	Easton & Leighton are my favorite.

None of these names are common, don't worry. =D|`|68d970a94ff2c1ff8d1b0d1bfdc0fed0aa	I like Elijah, Noah and Easton... pretty much in that order, too. The only one that might top all of them is "Torin." It's a nice, strong Irish name that is VERY rare in the states. In fact, its the name I wanted but Daddy-to-be insists on a Bible name so we're stuck with Ezequiel (pronounced with the Spanish "A"). I'll be nicknaming him "A-Z" or something b/c that's just too much name for a little baby. |`|AXEp1Bu6aa	Elijah - Cute.  Leighton - I think of this as a girls name rather than a boys.  Noah - Cute.

Varient: Eastaugh ('East-oh') just thought I'd suggest it seeing as you like Easton.|`|AA10512500	clayton,sounds good  |`|PE0pcTX9aa	I like Elijah, Landon, and Clayton.|`|pj6mwZaAaa	I like Noah. |`|AA12090960	Out of the names you have given Noah is the best. Although common its not too common and its old/biblical yet timeless. it works with any age and it won't matter if the child grows up to be punk (if it comes back) or goth or emo or metro or just your average normal bloke, noah works every group.    I wouldn't name my child Landon it sounds cockney for London. Elijah is ok but people need to give the name a rest and for it to phase out before it can come back again. And ppl might think the childs named after the actor which is ok if the parents and the boy is ok with it but I wouldn't personally do that.    I already mentioned about clayton and all the other names you say I can now see who ever picked the names really likes ON sound to names but thats too common and I personally do not prefer those names.    I would either stick with Noah if these are the final choices or get back into names list.|`|AA11327878	i really like landon.  i knew a guy with that name and he was the sweetest most good looking guy ever.    i would stay away from Easton.  that is a brand of a baseball bat.|`|rsOeXLq7aa	I like more masculine names for boys.

fSulSn3Saa	tell someone. do you have a older brother or sister? this happened to me ALOT in 6th- grade. i was to the point were ppl were throwing stuff at me and stalking me on the way home form scool going to jump me.(sadly im ashamed of that person and dont tel ppl i used to not stick up for myself) but there was this one time when my older sister (who is loud and threating) went up to this girl who was talking about me at the moment and yelled her. not saying much more then that she is ignorant and if she hears her talking about me then shes gonna kick her ***. this did what i wanted and she stopped talking about me. but the bullying didnt stop completely. what i eventually did was tell the princaple. yes you may seem like a "tattle tell" but o-well. they will get in trouble. im in 9th grade also and in jr.high there were plenty of ppl who talked about me. but YOU NEED TO STAND UP FOR YOUR SELF!!!!!!! i promise it is the ONLY way to get some one to leave you alone. take a boxing class of selfdeffense class. learn to protect yourself. i did this and i grew to be a threatining person because i was so sick of getting picked on. no one messes with me now. and if they do i have the confidence that even if they do wanna fight i can handle myself. learn to be strong. learn to stick up for yourself. tell them to shut the **** up. lol. do something.     well i hope this helps a lil...but whats the worse thats gonna happen?? you get in a lil trouble? o-well..your in HIGHSCHOOL. your supposed to get in trouble. lol.     Desi    ps. im sorry they bully you. . .i know how you feel.  pps. IGNORING THEM DOESNT WORK!!!!|`|QLoqwyA1aa	make friends with other people that they bully so when you guys are bullied there is more of you and you can have the courage to stand up to them.    The girl in your Bible class is just teasing you because she isnt confident with herself thats why she sees the wrong in others... next time when she bothers you like that just tell her   to stop noticing everything you do.|`|AA11287657	Firstly, you really should TELL YOUR PARENTS or the person/people who are your guardians.  By all means also tell your Bible Teacher - if he is a good teacher he will make sure this dosen;t happen again and he may verywell tell your parents anyway as an extra protection for you.  Nornmally your parents are the people who care for and love youmost in the world and will go out of their way to protect you.  You may feel it will annoy them but I think you will be suprised - I think they will probably go out of their way to help you.  If this is not at all possible, go to a trusted relative or friend about it and also the the Principal of the school.  If you get no help from the school - contact, or get someone to contact the police for you.  All schools should now have a ZERO TOLERANCE for bullying.  It may only be words now, but usually if a bully is allowed to get away with this they will progress to more harmful, violent behaviour.  Hope it all turns out well for you.|`|PPHsKM26aa	Join a fitness gym, hire a special trainer to help get you started on your routine. Why am I suggesting this? To get muscles so you can beat their asses? No. Violence is pathetic. Get a hard body, seduce the bullie's girlfriends, have sex with them. They'll stop eating after they find out what you did with their loved ones.    |`|kau3VH2Zaa	seriously you need to stick up to these mean people!!!! |`|BeSb3avSaa	I'm not encouraging you to give in to this girl but you'll feel much more secure with yourself if you handle the underlying problem.  If you are excessively sweaty (which many girls are) you may want to try a clinical strength antiperspirant.  Also, when she says something to you could just say something simple like "mind your own business" or "why are you worried about what I am doing?" that way you won't be tempted to get emotionally charged with the conversation. Good luck.|`|B9hBVXDZaa	i think you should just do wat i learned to do say something so that she hates you forever but only talks **** about u behind ur back i do this to girls i find bitchy ye they talk **** but it doesn't matter also if  u want to care less find something u love and pursue it for me it was  music|`|sdHVSBi1aa	Okay, here is what I would do. Instead of using the roll on deodorant, use the powder deodorant because it is more effective and carry body spray. Tell the teacher and if you want to, you can take out your lunch. This girl is a ***** and this is in Bible school? |`|M6c0hUefaa	Tell her if she keeps bothering you you're gonna wipe your sweat on her face...then she will be really happy  |`|y96eYj0Faa	:[    There is this kid in my grade who just smells really bad. It's natural. I feel really bad for him because he has to wear alot of deoderant and cologne to cover up his B.O. Just ask your teacher to switch seats, or if you can, switch out of that class. Talk to your school councelor too.|`|zrBzRYI8aa	Well maybe you should just go to the restroom and apply the deodorant, even if you really dont want to.     Or maybe you should stand up forr yourself! 
RWaRSAfJaa	I love this name! It is very different, and new.|`|XpfGuOcQaa	I like it!

I like names that are different but a girl's name should be soft and pretty. Sorry|`|KiGQV0MSaa	i think its nice.   i love the name persia for a girl (purr-shh-ah)  :)|`|dk8y4eseaa	I don't really like it. But that's my opinion. Sorry.  It sounds like Piranha- fish. :S  The upside is that it's a goddess of Rome, that's all.|`|dPmK83UYaa	i agree. too much similar...like joking about a girl's....  yeah not a good choice.|`|EgbIYBehaa	Its reminds me of parana fish! sorry..|`|rgOBHB5uaa	not really.|`|6SB4ufEYaa	Makes me think of  perineum.

Sorry|`|PX4u59tkaa	shelly im so sorry for what im about to say but for some reason it sounds to me like it would be a medical name for some kind of me of girl-parts! is that b/c of the pereneum? ...i'm wincing!|`|HM0cxcahaa	Sorry to say it reminds me of pernirium hahaha|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	if you insisted take the first part of the name anna i think it is a cool name anna|`|wN8pDYZlaa	i know a girls whos name is persephonie ( dont know how to spell it ) but it sounds AWSOME ! and i think its a greek goddess name (goddess of spring who goes to the underworld with hade each winter )     Maybe its Perspini or Peirsephinie ????|`|5p7NhwQuaa	No... sounds like piranha to me.|`|85a7adb7410df3ce980f02b34377f6edaa	hmm im not sure    but i like Sienna
f9819fdd5fcae169b0d2b14feb317aadaa	Weirdly enough, even tho u have a double barralled first name, i think a 4 syllable name wud go with it best.     How about...    Peyton-Jay Olivia Wells.   Peyton-Jay Alicia Wells  Peyton-Jay Amelia Wells  Peyton-Jay Felicity Wells  Peyton-Jay Liliana Wells  Peyton-Jay Victoria Wells    Wierdly enough i actually think Elizabeth wud go nice! hehe.    But out of the names ive written, i think Olivia flows better.    Hope this helps    xx :-) xx|`|PGDbGgoCaa	Lola  Daisy    i think it needs to be a name with 2 syllables|`|56216275babe93f0f69ad2124d3724deaa	emily|`|yLG6QUuaaa	How about Ann?  Rose  Elizabeth  Patrica|`|0tZxcTcUaa	amy|`|MMOwlLw3aa	levinya|`|BLhPNe17aa	i like peyton-jayNE better and for the middle name maybe tayla or lee?|`|dK6YGyNyaa	i think because jay is so short, you need a longer middle name to make it flow well - probably three or four syllables. how about:    peyton-jay francesca  peyton-jay maria  peyton-jay rhianna  peyton-jay katrina  peyton-jay eliza  peyton-jay lucinda  peyton-jay alesha  peyton-jay miranda  peyton-jay verity  peyton-jay victoria  peyton-jay olivia  peyton-jay marissa  peyton-jay serena  peyton-jay daniella  peyton-jay brianna  peyton-jay alexandra|`|5ZvALiclaa	This is tricky one. You already have a lot of common sounds in those names so getting one to match in may be difficult.   I think "Peyton-Jay Wells" sounds great as it is but if you want another name in there what about....    Peyton-Jay Chloe Wells  Peyton-Jay Elizabeth Wells  Peyton-Jay Victoria Wells  Peyton-Jay Madison Wells  Peyton-Jay Savannah Wells  Peyton-Jay Isabella Wells  Peyton-Jay Katrina Wells  Peyton-Jay Rosalie Wells    Hope that gives you some ideas. I still think that just Peyton-Jay Wells sounds the best|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	Isn't a double-barrelled first name enough?!|`|AA10302841	Peyton-Jay Gwendolyne Wells    I notice you are adding defensive comments to your question in response to perfectly helpful suggestions. This kind of proves their point - you may have to spend the next 30 years responding in a defensive way and the child will too.|`|9A2lfMVHaa	To be honest I don't think you need one. Peyton-Jay Wells sounds fine as it is.|`|tjLODo1Caa	Annabel|`|4048ad82d67909905629720173b0aa1caa	Think of the child not you, ??  (AT SCHOOL)|`|sf88YCpgaa	I agree with the person who suggested Emily.  I like the middle name Grace, but I think two syllables sounds better with the first name and the short last name.|`|OzFJpI2Waa	Peyton-Jay is enough.|`|vY4FZeuGaa	Kelly, Lisa, Claire, Michelle, Louise, Jennifer, Miranda.You could make it your name or your middle name. Best luck with the pregnancy and with everything else.|`|GBy0W2YEaa	i think ebony goes well with these name and congratulation :) and if you want a long name for you baby it up to you not what everyone else thinks toddler learn really quick so having a short name make no difference to a long name|`|8QZNMyBvaa	I like Peyton-Jay Emily Wells :o)     Whatever you decide on it definitely needs to have more than one syllabal in it.  Good Luck!|`|wzLvf0plaa	Peyton-Jay Arlette Wells    well the meaning of the names you chose are 'fighting mans estate' and 'bird'.. so I went with Arlette that means 'eagle' so it kind of fits in..
rHLmVnq5aa	I'm Auntie Cathy to my friends son. When he was born I bought him a stuffed Monkey (I love monkeys), he is 5 now and still has that monkey and if you ask him where he got it, he will tell you Auntie Cathy. |`|X70So9rvaa	you can get her a monthly calender thing, i got one for my girls and you put their hand print or foot print on it each month.  you could also give her a blanket that has her name on it.  a stuff toy is a good one too. if you do ebay i know a lady that will do a blanket with her name on it with a animal or cartoon person. you could also put on it from auntie jennie... if you would like her link to the blankets just email me.|`|3Gz9BghCaa	A blankie! I still have my blanket! You could give it to the baby to snuggle with in hospital and they will likely have it all their life. Even more, you could buy some lovely polar fleece and sew one yourself.|`|A7025pm1aa	I would say a blanket or a charm bracelet  that you can buy charms for every birthday.

Enbfw2tJaa	A change in your cycle and cramping between periods really does demand an examination and consultation with your Ob/Gyn. There are causes other than pregnancy and stress that can present in unusual cramping and disruptions of a normal cycle, including cysts and endometriosis. Have a check up and make sure to mention all your symptoms to your physician.|`|6HMgT5LCaa	I would say that you maybe pregnant, but very slight chance. I'd say go to the doctor and figure out why this is happening. As I bet everyone on here is going to tell you the same exact thing. I'm sorry, wish I could help you. That's happened to me before, but I never seen a doctor for it, I didn't think anything of it, and no, I wasn't pregnant, I guess my body was just being that way, I don't know. It's pretty scary when it happens though, because you're wondering to yourself, uhh what's going on? Haha.. so yeah just go and see a doctor   [=|`|AA11104833	Have u been under a lot of stress? Cause stress can wreck havoc on ur body?      However, ur light period in December coudla been implantation bleeding.     I woudl wait and see if u start..and if not do a test to make sure. But I wouldn't be to worried. You also said u wre sick for 3 days. Sometimes the flu can alst up to a week..so maybe the cramoing is a side affect of the flu thing u had?|`|VyqXk7Ppaa	It was probaly a bug and you are unlikely to be pregnant as you had a period|`|8UYOQ9tMaa	If you have had sex you could be pregnant.  I suggest a pregnancy test then you'll at least be able to rest easier knowing one way or another.|`|1T1rHTGBaa	I would say take a preggo test, wait a week and a half and take another if it came back negative. you may have had implantation bleeding  It may very well be a bug, but the daily cramps were what made me realize I was preggo.|`|3Hu2Sh7Baa	yes though i had a period for 2days very light and i am pregnant next period never came. Id go and get checked out incase you are miscarring and mayb complications cramps shouldnt be going on this long hnz. Go to doc get checked out better to be safe.
d078065f40a2ddd595ae99fbba5afc3faa	Sometimes stress and or diet can cause an absent period.  You could try another test, and if that is negative and you still haven't had your period, get a blood test done at your doctors office.  In the meantime, act like you are pregnant and avoid drinking and smoking.    Hope you get the results that you want!|`|19be321f7e9cc0ed9e2fd617e4993561aa	theres a chance that you might be pregnant...maybe its the brand of tester you used? try seeing a doctor. they can do a blood and urine test to be sure. good luck!|`|15ec59839f6401c70ff82989b8c9c7adaa	go to the doctors you may need labs(blood test) that would be accurate to the date|`|ca598b1246139344b09476ec45e2fab3aa	there is nothing wrong, and sure it's possible you are preg..|`|e8973a0426a9b4109c704aa51b2c8c8baa	you need to go to the doctor it is possible you have hemroids|`|aaa4e9309b5e851aea98b3e553fb23e7aa	there is a chance your pregnant|`|f14c9c4b604b6615d5995a5951f7564aaa	a lot of things can contribute, such as, a new diet, excercise, stress, or even a false-positive pregnancy test.  I'd take another test and make an appointment to see my doctor.    Good luck

ebM6CxRQaa	I have heard some different things. PLEASE call your doctor and ask... but I have heard of pedialyte helping w/ congestion. My nephew is only 2 months and that is what the pediatrician told her to give him. (I dont think I could give it to my baby but it did seem to help) Steamy bath may break it up a little.. Lots of water. Unfourtantly there is not too much you can do since he cant cough and spit it out. Breast milk and formula are going to make it worse but of course your son still needs it. I hope your little man is feeling better! Its terrible when they are sick!|`|AA11327878	i am the type of person that really hates meds and hate giving them to my children unless it is absolutley necessary but for now i would get the bothroom at hot and steamy.  that will clean out his chest but you have to do it 2-3x a day.  think of other ways that you take care of yourself when you get sick and just reduce all of that for a baby.|`|j7cOJL25aa	Is it in his nose or is he coughing it up?  My 9 month old twins both have a cold right now too.  Lots of runny noses around here.  Get a cool mist humidifier, use saline drops in the nose and the suction for the nose if that is where he is stuffy, vicks baby vapor rub for on his chest.  Vicks also makes a plug in vaporizer which has helped my boys.  Avoid milk products (expect breast milk, formula) because they can make congestion work.  Also, give a little tylenol or motrin ( I tend to use motrin with my kids, it seems to work better) - he is probably uncomfortable.    I also set my kids up in the exersaucer in the bathroom while I run a hot steamy shower to loosen up the mucous.    Give a call to the doctor though.  He/She may some more suggestions.

What you said here sounds pretty relevant as to not getting you into further trouble. I think you should tell your parents just in case you need to pay for something. Your parents should have understanding as to how you were feeling with about this.|`|6fd9fd183a5ca46ed3b3e1e38846464eaa	you need to tell your parents, get the doctors note, and be prepared to be honest with the judge....he may cut you some slack....you r guilty you were speeding and driving with no insurance....but you had reason to. plead guilty and ask for a reduced "sentence" providing proof of what you say.|`|685fcaaa3357cdd67f8e979b9f201c9eaa	I would fight the ticket and make sure you tell your parents and show them the note also.

The judge may see it that not only were you speeding, but you also had impaired vision.   You can look into traffic school so you don't get a point on your license. You can also see about making payments if you want to pay the $500.00  But any way you go, you will probably need to tell your parents about it.|`|3381e08d8b15969d59bb25d602d74b63aa	What you need to do is have your doctor give a statement to the police officer that gave you a ticket about your contacts and tell them what happened.  Asked for supervised driving which means you can't get another ticket for so long. Plead guilty.
e9fcc3005143d4e931a3524100e49114aa	If it was before you stopped taking your pills you shouldn't have been ovulating.  That is what the pills do, stop you from ovulating.  You should expect your period at the same time it usually comes.  It may be irregular for while and you may not be fertile for up to a year.  So use protection, you never know.|`|55a0b44ae232d5e463255c61a889ca78aa	Yes, because the sperm lives inside a woman's body for about 5 days.

Lernen sie keine Regeln zu Hause, werden sie es in ihrem Leben sehr schwer haben, denn berall gibt es Regeln, an die man sich halten muss. Das f?ngt schon im Kiga an, sp?ter in der Schule und auch im Beruf ist es so.

LG, Duffy|`|b0f867710059666b652c59b5c11f2a20aa	Die Frage ist ja, was man unter "verw?hnen" versteht!? Wenn einem Kind alles in den Scho? gelegt wird, es nie etwas alleine tun muss oder fr etwas geradestehen, wird es eines Tages extrem unselbst?ndig sein. Ausserdem wird es sehr hart, wenn es dann fr seinen Lebensunterhalt einmal selber sorgen muss! Die Eltern tun weder sich noch dem Kind einen Gefallen. Was ist, wenn die Eltern eines Tages mal nicht mehr da sind? Wer kmmert sich dann um diesen m?glicherweise verzogenen und unselbst?ndigen Menschen?    Ich selber habe eine extrem behtete und geliebte Kindheit als Einzelkind genossen. Gleichzeitig wurde ich aber auf die praktischen Dinge im Leben vorbereitet. Beh?rden, Formulare etc. stellten fr mich nie ein Problem dar. Ich musste im Haushalt helfen, bin jobben gegangen, hatte jedoch trotzdem immer ausreichend Taschengeld, Klamotten und was ich sonst noch brauchte. Wenn ein Problem auftrat, konnte und kann (!) ich immer auf meine Familie z?hlen.

Das Kind wird nie selbstst?ndig sein und alle tyrannisieren, wo es nur geht. Wenn du dann mal nicht mehr da bist, wird es sich jemanden anderes suchen, der einem alles hinterherwischt und den man tyrannisiern kann.  Ein Kind darf natrlich verw?hnt werden und mu? seine Freiheiten haber, aber es mu? auch Grenzen gesetzt bekommen.|`|6bc3ecca9ed8606a2e7fc9aaa775afe0aa	Ich denke, dass "verw?hnen" mit materiellen Dingen nur ein sehr m??iger Ersatz fr echte Liebe und Zuwendung ist.  Und weil es nur ein Ersatz ist, wird er nicht die gewnschten positiven Ergebnisse haben.   Kinder brauchen eine Orientierung, die Du ihnen als Erwachsener geben musst, indem Du Regeln aufstellst, Grenzen setzt und Konsequenzen setzt. Du musst als Erziehender konsequent, und zugleich gefhlswarm und verl?sslich einsch?tzbar sein.  Verw?hne dein Kind mit Liebe, zeige ihm immer und zu jeder Zeit (auch wenn Du schimpfen oder Grenzen setzen musst), dass es ein einzigartiger, liebenswerter und wichtiger Mensch ist, und Du wirst eine selbstbewusste, freie, gefhlswarme und reife Pers?nlichkeit heranziehen, die nicht ihre emotionalen Bedrfnisse mit materiellen Dingen ersatzbefriedigen muss, und der auch mit Entt?uschungen angemessen umgehen kann, d.h. eben nicht wie ein verw?hntes Kind.|`|053071905ae02dad7b24c1ce6fd5af44aa	Ich habe mein Kind sehr gerne verw?hnt.

Sie hat es verstanden und akzeptiert. Sonst gab es keine Verbote. Wegen des guten Vertrauensverh?ltnisses mu?te ich keine Einengung vornehmen (z.B. Heimkehrregelung 22:Uhr oder so). Ich wusste immer wo sie war und wir konnten uns immer auf uns gegenseitig verlassen.    In der Zeit der Pubert?t hat man mich beneidet, warum wir uns so gut verstehen. Jetzt ist sie erwachsen und wir sind die besten Freunde.|`|b1ec0c793bd6973fdc165c42637630efaa	ich finde es gibt kein verwoehnen. jeder der sein kind oder seine kinder liebt hat, macht und gibt ihnen alles was sie brauchen und wollen. zu mir sagen viele ich wuerde mein kind (2) verwoehnen weil sie noch bei uns im bett schlaeft,aber ich mag es mit der kleinen zu schmusen,und nicht sie in ein anderes zimmer abzuschieben.|`|1488b16ff2bd8e2e5a1e597eb779ace2aa	Bravo zur "Ja-Sagerin"!-Ganz meine Meinung und ganz genau so wie es mir und meiner Schwester ergangen ist! ;o)    Dann kommt aber auch noch ein anderer negativer Aspekt hinzu: Das sehe ich ganz extrem an meinem Kumpel und seinen gro?en Bruder (der ist 29!!!).

Und ich habe nach der Trennung sehr lange gebraucht, damit er mir nicht jedesmal das ganze Gesch?ft zusammenschreit wenn ich ihm seinen Wunsch mal nicht erfllt habe!    Ausserdem leiden auch die Kinder dann sehr darunter wenn sich nach nur einem halben Jahr verw?hnen oder auch l?nger auf einmal etwas ?ndert! Teilweise verstehen sie dann auch nicht warum das so ist!!    Ich habe es so gel?st, mein Sohn hat seine Urgro?mutter die er verg?ttert und die ihn auch wirklich verw?hnt, aber er wei? auch, dass das die Ausnahme ist, und dass es zuhause "leider" nicht so funktioniert!!!!!

Verw?hnt man es mit Aufmerksamkeit und Verst?ndnis,  mit Liebe also, so ist das ganz etwas Anderes, als wenn man es mit materiellen Dingen verw?hnt.  Dies kann zwar auch scheinbar negative Folgen haben, weil sie vielleicht l?ngere Zeit unselbst?ndiger bleiben, als Kinder, die diese Aufmerksamkeit nicht so sehr erfahren.  Doch wie gesagt, das sind nur scheinbar negative Folgen.  Denn tats?chlich werden die Kinder, die mehr Aufmerksamkeit und Liebe erhalten gefestigter und k?nnen dann etwas sp?ter vielleicht, jedoch viel besser selbst?ndig, eigenst?ndiger werden, weil sie einfach beruhigter und gefestigter an die Problemstellungen herangehen k?nnen, als ein Kind, mit dem die Nerven durchgehen.    Verw?hnt man es mit materiellen Dingen, so verh?lt es sich wohl eher so, da? es immer noch mehr Neues haben will und da? es mit nichts zufrieden ist.|`|a4b41839ec2063dfd2b211bc0f689ff0aa	ich war immer ein ziemlich verw?hntes kind,also spreche ich aus erfahrung:  es stimmt, man ist meistens unzurfrieden,obwohl man eigentlich alles hat. man m?chte besser als andere sein.  nun,bei mir sind die verhaltensweisen nicht so deutlich gepr?gt, ich hab immerhin ein ganz normales leben hinbekommen. ;)  lg,angel

3388eef71a492c26e281234ab27fcaf3aa	What Does Board Certified Mean?  Becoming a licensed, board certified physician means meeting the most rigorous training and continuing education offered in the field of medicine.     Certification of physicians is done by medical specialty boards, recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) and the American Medical Association (AMA), as a way to tell consumers that the doctors with this credential have successfully completed approved training and have passed an evaluation process assessing their ability to provide quality patient care in their specialty.    Board certification is time-limited, and to maintain their certification, doctors are periodically reevaluated. They must present evidence of licensure and scope of their practice and pass an examination every 7 to 10 years, depending on the specialty.    Board certification is a good indication that your doctor has made a commitment to continuing education and is keeping up with the latest findings in his or her field.|`|8b9c375f4300a87e545baf45bf68b3acaa	If they are bored cetified they past a very regeriuos traning and if they are not i would find another doctor|`|eed63e891c7a7c90dd890643428dd133aa	Board certified means you a certified by the specialty board (in this the the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology) as being trained in that specialty. You would have had to go through a residency and then pass a very hard test.    Now a Family Practice (also called Family Medicine) physician can deliver a baby.  In some rural areas, where there are less Ob-Gyne they do most of the low risk deliveries. Again, they would be board certified in Family Medicine.    I would check if he was a board certified Family Medicine physician.  If he is, that is o.k. for a low risk pregnancy.    If he is not board certified in anything that would be a matter of concern.  Many years ago, there would be general practitioners (GP's) who did a little bit of everything and didn't take the boards, because boards were only for specialist like OBGYN's or surgeon's.   They pre-date the development of a Family Medicine residency program and certification.  These were often very good doctors. However, these days almost every doctor takes a residency and then the boards.     A very young doctor, fresh from residency may be waiting to take the board examination and that's fine.  The boards are offered only once a year.    Otherwise a non- board certified doctor is either old, near retirement, or could not pass the boards.     An old doctor may be good, but if the doctor is young, (and not just waiting to take the next boards) I would change doctors.

Se voc est insegura com algumacoisa  pq n?o est preparada. Quando vc estiver preparada n?o sentir mais esta inseguran?a...tenho amigas que perderam com 13; eu perdi com 18 e tenho amigas que perderam com 24!  Vai muito de ser o momento certo com o cara certo!  N?o existe este lance de idade...existe maturidade!!!  Se n?o se sente preparada, n?o fa?a. Quando chegar a hora voc saber!    Boa sorte!|`|c7Rj1Rs7aa	17 ANOS|`|35ed328f6b1ff6ed70889860846475b5aa	Olha, eu n?o entendo essa importancia que as pessoas d?o  virgindade da mulher, e todo aquele papo de "s depois do casamento"... Se a pessoa  evanglica, eu at compreendo essa posi??o, embora n?o concorde.     Mas h uma opini?o generalizada, seja crente de qualquer religi?o, praticante ou n?o, ateu ou agnstico, de que a mulher tem que ser casta pelo menos at os dezoito anos. Acho que isso  machismo, hipocrisia e falso moralismo. Para mim, o nico problema  em torno da libera??o do sexo para as mulheres adolescentes   o risco de DST e gravidez. Somente.    Sinceramente, sei que muita gente n?o vai concordar comigo, mas eu acho que voc deve fazer o que voc sentir vontade.  A nica coisa inadimissvel  que hoje em dia, com tanta informa??o, internet, rdio, televis?o, jornais, revistas,etc, uma mulher ainda tenha rela??es sexuais com um homem sem se prevenir de doen?as e gravidez indesejada. A eu concordo quando as pessoas falam que a menina deve estar "preparada",  nesse sentido que eu entendo esse conselho.     Eu perdi a virgindade quando tinha 15 anos. Mas eu n?o estava "preparada." Colhi as consequncias. Posso lhe garantir que n?o foi nada bom, nada mesmo. Por isso, eu acho que  difcil a gente saber qual  a hora certa. No fundo a gente sempre pensa que a hora certa  a hora que a gente quer, e n?o  assim. Eu acredito que 14 anos  cedo para iniciar uma vida sexual, pois exige amadurecimento da parte da mulher, principalmente por causa do risco da gravidez. Mas eu sei tambm que, nessa fase e, principalmente, nos dias de hoje,  quase impossvel pregar a castidade aos jovens e ainda esperar que eles cumpram. Ent?o a minha proposta para a educa??o sexual : informa??o. Alm,  claro, do importante papel da famlia que  de educar seus filhos com o senso de responsabilidade.     Eu, por exemplo, adimiro a educa??o que uma tia deu para minha prima. Quando a gente tinha na faixa de uns treze, quatorze anos, lembro que minha prima tinha camisinhas no guarda-roupa. Eu nem sabia o que era aquilo. Ela riu. Me explicou que a m?e dela disse que n?o tinha idade ainda para ter rela??es sexuais, mas que se por caso ela resolvesse fazer o que n?o lhe foi recomendado, pois a m?e n?o poderia vigi-la 24 horas por dia, que n?o deixasse de usar o preservativo para n?o contrair doen?as horrveis (ela sabia at os nomes e sintomas) e/ou ter que perder uma fase maravilhosa da vida para cuidar de um beb. Ela abriu uma camisinha, me mostrou como era, e ficamos dando risada!!! Essa minha prima tem 30 e poucos anos agora, sempre tansou com quem teve vontade, nunca engravidou nem contraiu DST. Est muito bem casada e feliz.    Sexo, no meu entendimento, n?o prejudica ningum, n?o desvirtua ningum, quando  feito com vontade e responsabilidade. E ent?o, voc est preparada? S quem pode decidir  voc. Tem que ter conscincia disso. E cuidado para n?o se iludir com as promessas dos homens. Se for transar com esse menino de 17 anos, v consciente de que dessa rela??o pode sair tudo ou nada, quem sabe alguma coisa... mas nada de levar as coisas t?o  srio. Voc ainda  uma menina...  s um conselho.     Boa sorte!|`|bd3f02158ea0590086b10932a37dc7d1aa	OLha gatinah o negcio  o seguinte, sem querer desfazer seu romance mais essa histria de casar, sendo que namoram pela net? ? caia nessa ? ta  pura bucha, recentemente passei por uma situa??o dessas converso com uma garota a dois anos ja e tinhamos tudo combinado ela veio para ca no natal passou 4 dias comigo e nem se ficamos, ent?o olha a quase cero que el esta querendo apenas se aproveitar de vc.

Perder a virgindade n?o  s perder o hmem,  perder muito bem, voc deve estar bem preparada e madura para isso. Se voc ceder ao primeiro que aparece, ir desperdi?ar com ele um momento nico em sua vida. Por isso, n?o deixe o seu corpo mandar mais que o seu crebro.  Voc conhece mtodos contraceptivos?  Voc sabe como se prevenir de uma doen?a sexualmente transmissvel.

7a1e7d95141fde36789d4a1318dd1bdcaa	Jos,  sua pergunta tem dois lados. Se a mulher esta esperando ter um filho, a menstrua??o n?o vir  muito bom, significa que conseguiu engravidar. Por outro lado, se a mulher n?o quer filhos e se descuidou com os preservativos, e mesmo uma situa??o muito aflitiva. E muitas vezes esta afli??o causa um stress t?o grande que a menstrua??o demora mais ainda a descer. E como algum j respondeu ai em cima, ela tambm pode n?o vir por velhice, quando a mulher entra na menopausa. (certamente sua pergunta n?o foi neste sentido, ne?) Tambm j responderam que quando a menstrua??o vem a mulher se sente mal, e neste ponto  ruim mesmo.

c91a5e53d80677a56b31f437c9856363aa	O perodo frtil corresponde  poca da ovula??o, isto , o momento em que um dos ovrios libera um vulo, que vai ser fecundado pelo espermatozide. Isso ocorre cerca de 14 dias antes da menstrua??o. Se o espermatozide encontrar o vulo e fertiliz-lo, a gravidez acontece.     Neste caso, imediatamente ocorrem intensas modifica??es em todo o organismo, que podem ser sentidas como sensa??es de incha?o, nuseas, v?mitos. Dentro do tero ocorrem tambm altera??es que s?o importantes para que o ovo recm-fecundado possa ali se fixar e se desenvolver. Por essa raz?o, durante a gravidez a menstrua??o desaparece. Caso n?o ocorra gravidez, nada disso acontece. Dentro do tero s?o frustradas as mudan?as e o vulo  eliminado - a mulher menstrua.     Aps o trmino da menstrua??o todo o ciclo recome?a. Inicia-se nova fase na qual, no interior do ovrio come?a a amadurecer outro vulo, que estar pronto para "ser ovulado" aps duas semanas.     Tem-se ent?o, no ciclo menstrual, duas fases:     1a. A primeira  aquela que vai da menstrua??o at a ovula??o. A dura??o desta fase  varivel, pois depende de quanto tempo o vulo leva para amadurecer - aproximadamente 14 dias (s vezes mais, s vezes menos).     2a. A segunda fase vai da ovula??o at a menstrua??o seguinte e n?o varia: quase sempre dura 14 dias .     Conclui-se que o ciclo menstrual normal pode variar, ms a ms (25 a 35 dias, aproximadamente), dependendo da dura??o da primeira fase do ciclo.     Outra informa??o importante  a de que o perodo frtil se estende dois dias antes e dois dias depois da ovula??o, porque o espermatozide pode durar no organismo feminino por cerca de 48 horas aps a rela??o sexual.     Agora, resta a pergunta: levando-se em conta a varia??o da primeira fase do ciclo, como determinar exatamente o momento da ovula??o? A maneira  calcular a dura??o de todos os ciclos (entre o incio de uma menstrua??o e o incio da seguinte), ms a ms, durante um ano -  a famosa "tabelinha".     Consideram-se os intervalos do ciclo mais longo e do mais curto. Por exemplo, suponhamos que, em um ano, o ciclo mais curto tenha sido de 26 dias e o mais longo de 32 dias.     1o. Para determinar o incio do perodo frtil, utiliza-se o ciclo mais curto e se descontam 14 dias (segunda fase) e, como garantia, mais 2 dias:     26 dias - 14 dias - 2 dias = 10o dia = incio do perodo frtil .    2o. Para determinar o fim do perodo frtil, utiliza-se o ciclo mais longo, descontam-se 14 dias e se aumentam mais 2 dias: 32 dias - 14 dias + 2 dias = 20o dia = fim do perodo frtil .     Assim, os dias em que h menor chance de ocorrer gravidez s?o: do 1o dia da menstrua??o at o 10o dia e do 20o dia do ciclo at o incio da menstrua??o seguinte.     Por seguran?a, prolonga-se o perodo frtil em dois dias (no exemplo, do 9o ao 21o dia), pois o vulo permanece "fertilizvel" por 6 a 12 horas.     A eficcia deste mtodo varia de 60 a 80%; para compara??o, a da plula  de 98 a 99%.|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	14o dia aps a menstrua??o.|`|L2EZDlSkaa	se vc for irregular na menstrua??o esse metodo  o mais indicado,e se for regular  so contar 14 dias apos a menstrua??o  e verificar seu muco vaginal quando parecer clara de ovo vc estara fertil, boa sorte|`|A9a7dqx4aa	http://www.alobebe.com.br/site/ferrament...   este site calcula pra vc bjs|`|oleu5Jnraa	contar 15 dias para traz  a partir do ultimo dia da sua menstrua??o ( geralmente  5o dia dia do ciclo , de um ciclo de 28 dias)|`|iUJW8l6Waa	vou te dar uma dica de um site bem legal para vc acompanhar isso,  http://www.tabelinha.com.br

O ovulo tambem vem em direcao contraria, mais nao possui  capacidade de movimentacao, ele  impulsionado por movimentacao peristaltica do utero e trompas de falopio. Ao encontrar-se nos 2/3 da trompa de falopio ou em qualquer parte do utero, existem grandes  possibilidades de feculdacao.  Caso os espermatozoides nao possuirem grande mobilidade o que torna dificil uma fecundacao por vias de fato, por um tratamento profilatico, a pessoa pode sim ter filhos, por que com o avance da medicina atualmente ja fica mais facil resolver este problema.|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	Sim.

Olhe bem a sua situa??o: vc n?o precisa roubar; vc n?o precisa de sandlias; e roubou por "zoa??o". Na minha casa temos um termo para crian?as como vc - DELINQENTE.

Seus pais s?o certos pq, se n?o te castigarem como se deve, vc vai dar na cara deles ou, pior, vai ser mulher de bandido.  Quer a prova disto? A sua chorumela aqui no Y!R.    Na minha opini?o, a palmatria bastava, mas cada pai sabe de seus filhos. Priva??o de privilgios  maravilhoso, s que se fosse na minha casa, tanto vc, quanto a empregada, se arrependeriam amargamente, por isto. Est?o passando por cima da autoridade dos DONOS DA CASA e espero, sinceramente, que vocs sejam pegas e sofram o castigo adequado.    Todo crime tem a puni??o que merece. Andar descal?a, garota, n?o  vergonha alguma; vc est em contato com a m?e-terra, aproveite para se livrar da energia podre que infesta vc e evolua como gente. Medite acerca do que vc fez.    N?o  s vc que tem que servir de exemplo para a toda "galera jovem" da cidade, pequena aprediz de Maria Metralha, suas amigas capivaras, tambm. Ah, sim, providncia primeira,  afastar vc da convivncia destas capivaras, daqui a pouco, se elas come?arem a sair com os traficantes da cidade, vc vai seguir o mesmo caminho, "s de zoa??o".    Que bom que todos elogiaram os seus pais.  por isso que vc veio chorar pitangas, aqui. Eu j vi meia dzia de gatos pingados falar asneira e  isto que vc quer ouvir, n?o ? EST ENGANADA!!!!!    Repito, o castigo est sendo JUSTSSIMO e tenho minhas dvidas se vc vai tomar jeito, porque passou por cima da autoridade dos seus pais, com a ajuda da empregada. Juro, eu espero que eles vendam o seu computador e despe?am a safada da empregada - a casa e a filha N?O S?O DELA, ent?o, ela que respeite a decis?o dos DONOS DA CASA. Ah, se fosse aqui, ia ser demitida POR JUSTA CAUSA!    Como o amigo acima disse, a MENORIDADE PENAL MUDOU,  BELEZA.

He doesn't drink cold syrup drinks as well. He drinks a lot of milk and cooled boiled water and for a period, he luv orange juice. My son is 3 now and he still hates cold flavoured drink, which I thought is good 'cos he hardly falls ill and his immune system is very strong indeed. Now that he's 3, I started giving him a little bit of ice cream and chocolates and fried chicken wings.

427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	Honestly, if there's no medical reason to be induced, I'd see if you can wait it out a couple more days, especially if you're not 100% sure about your date of conception.  Some inductions go very smoothly, but others are long and hard and just lead to one problem after another.    I've had three induced labors, and they were long and difficult.  I've heard that inductions are much more painful than natural labors as well.    With my first, I was induced because my water broke (on my due date), but contractions hadn't started after 8 hours.  So my water broke at 1am, my induction started around 9am, I got an epidural at 9pm when I was still only 3-4cm dilated, I pushed unsuccessfully for two hours around 3am, and ended up with a c-section at 6am.  (It was 29 hours from the time my water broke until my c-section.)  In my case, the baby was not in the right position.  You may want to spend some time rocking on your hands and knees tonight to get baby in a good position for delivery.  Also, try to do that during labor to keep baby moving down in a good position.    I learned with babies  2 and  3 that labor pain is much, much worse after your water breaks.  Both those times, I wasn't progressing quickly enough on pitocin (induced due to pre-eclampsia), so they broke my water.  Labor was immediately much more difficult.      With baby  2, I got the epidural again and almost ended up with another c-section when my daughter's heart rate dropped.  Thankfully, her heartrate recovered, and I did have a vaginal delivery, but it was a very difficult recovery b/c they pulled her out with a vacuum.  That 2nd labor was also over 24 hours.    With baby  3, I was able to labor in the shower for 45 minutes when I felt like I was about ready to get the epidural (and I really wanted to go unmedicated that time).  During that 45 minutes, I went from 5cm-9cm and came out ready to push.  It was still a long day (12 hours), but being unmedicated allowed me to push at my own pace, and my recovery was amazing.  It was still difficult due to the pitocin, but I just felt phenomenal afterward.  As soon as baby was out, there was no more pain.  Oh, and that time, they just poked a hole in my amniotic sac to let the water trickle out rather than fully breaking it, and they turned my pitocin down a bit once labor was progressing well.  I think that made a huge difference, too.    Good luck to you, and enjoy that new baby!|`|jNYEi0CTaa	My mom had to be induced with me,  She said it didnt hurt,   And I turned out fine!  Good luck|`|g5RS83paaa	how exciting for you, my water broke and 16 hours later not much was going on so they gave me pitocin and suddenly  the labor pains quickened and got much stronger, it was pretty painful. but then they decided to give me a c-section because I wasn't dilating, everything turned out great    good luck|`|RSEp960aaa	I was induced and it took a while, but there were no major problems due to the induction.  The important thing is to relax! For me it took about 13 hours after initial induction with a hormone ring. Once they started a pitocin drip things moved faster. It took 27 hours between the initial induction with the vaginal ring and having my baby boy!|`|3gXQPso5aa	I was with my second who is 6 weeks:  I got there at 8am   8:30am: I statred getting IV's put in etc  9:00am: They statred giving me potocin to start contractions  from there I got to 3cm then the doctor broke my water.  I went from 3 to 5cm and then they started uping the potocin every 30 mins. by 1:00pm he was there|`|52U22fiAaa	Pitocin will make contractions real strong and you will have to drink a lot of water so that the baby's heart rate doesn't jump too fast.  I was in labor for 30 hours... but that is not common.  Goodl uck.|`|7bTOY5vHaa	I have had to be twice induced. Have they told you how they are going to induce? I had my membranes sweep with my first and it put me in prolonged labor and then after 3 days of that they put me in the hospital and put me on pitocin and my labor only lasted for about 10 hours after that. Then my second time I was induced they put the foley bulb inside my cervix and it hurt and it took 5 hours to dilate me to 4 cm then I finally had him after 24 hours of labor.
kQC4HX6vaa	I have PCOS and was on Metformin for 2 years, didn't get pregnant.    Later the doctors added clomid.  I took 5 rounds of clomid and a shot of Ovidrel, and that did it in the end.    It took about 3 years for me to conceive.

Sounds like a growth spurt to me.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	This will continue until the growth spurt passes, which could be a week or two.    Try spoon feeding him cereal of a thicker consistency instead, also try spoon feeding him some fruits and veggies, this will help and still provide him with nutrition.  Some babies get very cranky with growth spurts as well.   Hang in there, it does get better.|`|a70231ccec5d44c2d21f177c98496f1baa	I think hes going through a growth spurt and it will go away soon but don't over feed|`|AA11138222	Why don't you try feeding him baby food? You could have starting it around 5 months old or so. Maybe the formula alone isn't enough.|`|fHjSonssaa	I thought I had it bad at a point in time with my son- but that tops it.  How do you keep up with cleaning to bottles?    That seems to bit be a bit much every hour.  I would agree that a baby would eat more often during a growth spurt- and I don't know specifics on your sons pancreas condition.  Since you're trying the rice in the bottles- it just seems like too much-     I think you need to get him in- or at least call the DR, especially because of his pancreas.  Or you could try foods- but still, that's quit a bit.    Call DR and see what they have to say.|`|c5519f0ed7a867f4c4afd56a3ecd58b1aa	He should be on gerber stage 1 or 2 by now. Are you sure he is crying b/c he is hungry?|`|jgDlkSiWaa	He is probably going through a growth spurt. It should only last a few days.   Do you feed him anything else besides bottles?|`|Yx5LTlDwaa	its time he should be eating solid food by now, feed him baby food that will fill him out. You have to cut down the bottles milk in half and give him juice instead or a water.  He needs something to digest in his stomach instead of just bottles which will just go thru to his "pee".|`|5bcucG6raa	I am no sure what type of health problems your baby has, but most babies should be eating solid foods by 4-6 months of age. It is time to introduce table foods to your baby, of course you can start with baby food. Rice cereal, oatmeal cereal, and jar foods (start w/fruits & veggies) are good places to start, but eating 7 oz of milk every 1-2 hours at this age is not optimal. It should be more like 6 oz every 4-6 hours or so... He needs a little more substance at this point.|`|kLYoRiFeaa	you really shoudlnt put the cereal or baby food in his bottles cuz he doesnt know when to stop so he is going to over eat....and also if u feed him by spoon then he will het the taste of it instead of not tasting it in his bottles....and ur pedi wil tell u more

I was wanting to do something special for my hubby too. We were talking about going out to dinner, but according to my hubby we'd have to hit the dollar menu b/c we are so broke. Plus my mom would have to come down to keep the baby so we wouldn't have any "alone"time. Im thinking of making him something with a pic of the baby and her footprints on it . It could read" Be Mine" or " Be my valentine" or something like that.I was gonna make him like a coupon book from me. Coupons of things he can cash in when the time is right. They sell them at Walgreens but I was gonna make my own to give him with some "extra" stuff.  And just try to make some time when we can be alone.

Then I got some votive candles that I'm going to light and place around the living room. I'm also going to get a bottle of champagne and some strawberries and whipped cream to have. I'm also going to have "It's your love" playing as it was our first dance at our wedding.

My hubby likes to take control of that.  But I was thinking that I would go to the dollar store and get some little decorations and cut out some hearts from colorful construction paper and put them up around the house.  I also like making special food for her on special days so i'm thinking heart shaped cookies, pancakes, etc.

AA11210211	With my son I only had 1 ultrasound my whole pregnancy most insurances only cover 1 unless there are reasonable reasons for another one.With my daughter I had a total of 5 I think but that was a different case.|`|Pf9fyEyQaa	I got one at 13 weeks (Nuchal translucency) and 18 weeks (anatomy) and a repeat of the anatomy when they couldn't see his face.  Other than that all other ultrasounds have not been the "normal" ones...but overall I have had:  5 weeks: confirm pregnancy  8 weeks: only saw a sac in the 5 weeks scan  13 weeks: nuchal translucency  18 weeks: anatomy scan  21 weeks: repeat anatomy  23 weeks: 3D optional  25 weeks: repeat 3D, covering his face at 23 weeks  31 weeks: 3D optional    So I guess I've had 5 medical ultrasounds, 3 optional ones, and 8 altogether.  I don't expect to be getting anymore, I am now 35 weeks.  I guess the only way they would do one now is if they suspected something was wrong.  A friend of mine had an ultrasound while she was in labour to make sure baby was in the right position.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I had one done at 8 and 22. That's all my insurance covers. I don't think they generally do it past then because they have all the medical info they need and fat starts accumulating so they can't really see anything new. I was told I MIGHT get one at my 36 week appointment to make sure she is in the correct position, but that is only if they can't tell by feel her.|`|WPI0Z47saa	Usually the last one is around 35-37 weeks (depending on your doctor) to see how everything is progressing and make sure the baby is ready for delivery.|`|3SIRKIBaaa	Usually they only give you one  ultrasound if there are no complications. With my son I only had one.|`|xue72D76aa	I had 3 done during the course of my pregnancy.  The first was at my 10 week appointment to estimate the due date.  The second was around 22 weeks to measure the baby and find out the gender.  The final one was during my 39th week to estimate the baby's size and weight as a factor in considering c-section (the doctor was considering it anyway, I didn't want a c-section).|`|fVpRVofLaa	It's up to the dr and how your pregnancy is going.Me,I ALWAYS took my VCR tape so they could record it. Take one just inc ase, and in the future ask when the next one will be, especially so you significant other can plan to be there to.|`|P2hhUsoMaa	Usually you only get one ultrasound if you don't have any complications.
P2eCpu5gaa	No problem, Its normal...It is like asking yourself "I have to have fun from 6:00 to 8:00"...  No silly there is no distinct pattern. He kicks when he kicks!|`|PN7ELn3aaa	No, you don't need to worry. The baby will have active days and lazy days. As long as you are feeling the baby regularly you have nothing to worry about. :)|`|8gI2WPpbaa	It is all normal dear. Do not worry. Since he moves, this is all right. I guess your frequent visit to the doctor must insure you.|`|ostF23Omaa	as long as your baby moves everything if fine. no worries!  Good Luck.|`|qaMrAspCaa	That should be fine, just as long as you feel the baby move everyday.  At your next check up make sure to bring this up to you doctor. They will probably have you do kick counts.  Soon the baby will have more of a pattern. If you are worried that you haven't felt movement in a long time try sitting down and focus on your belly, tap it a little, or drink cold water to stimulate some movement and see if baby is reactive to the surroundings. I'm sure you are just worried over nothing!|`|sFPV2KbBaa	i think that if my memory serves me its normal.  if the baby doesn't move for a 12 hour period then you need to be concerned and go to the doctor.|`|6NS3UUaQaa	I remember when I was around that time in my pregnancy i would freak when i would not feel her move. This was the time that they said you  should start counting the movement and what not. I say its normal sometimes they move sometimes they don't but only you know your baby and yourself so if ever you get to worried check it out. But just know there is no exact time they say usually after you eat there was not always movement from her after I ate you just got to go with your instincts. Good luck and don't drive yourself to crazy.|`|xq8Kn7Phaa	MY BABY IS THE SAME WAY IT IS A LIL SCARY SOMETIMES BUT AS LONG AS U FEEL THEM MOVE PERIOD ITS FINE    YOU ARE ALSO GETTING CLOSER TO FULL TERM YOUR BABY WILL MOVE LESS AS HE/SHE MAKES THERE WAY TO THE BIRTHING POSITON THEY KINDA GET WEDGE AND WILL ONLY FEEL KICKS TOWARDS UR RIBS UR BELLY WILL ALSO LOOK LIKE IT DROPPED A LIL
8WRnqs08aa	My Dr. advised to wait one year. However, I got pregnant 5 months after my c-section.|`|8uiH6iRbaa	they recommend you wait for a year     but anything after 8 months is ok     i was told this by my doctor and my sister fell pregnant had a c - section and then fell pregnant again 6 months later and all was ok|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	Till your completely healed. That's different for everyone. I would really ask a doctor about this because she could really hurt herself if her body isn't ready again. I'm hoping there's a good reason for wanting to have a baby again so soon.    Edit: Wasn't saying it to be mean just saying, usually it's a good idea to put some time in between babys. I wasn't sure if she lost her baby or what. It wasn't a judgement.|`|dBpmyIduaa	When my sister had hers the doctor told her to wait two years.  I would tell your sister that she should ask her doctor the next time she goes for a checkup.  Women have had cesareans with less than two years between but the risks are much higher.  Why take a chance?|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	Is she planning to have another c-section or a VBAC?  I know that there's a recommended 18-month healing time recommended between a c-section and a VBAC.  That means that she could get pregnant when baby is 9 months old, but she should definitely talk with her doctor first b/c only s/he knows the circumstances of her c-section.    I personally had a c-section with my first, got pregnant again when she was 8 months old, and then had a VBAC.  My girls are 17 months apart.|`|KHbqfLRUaa	My doctor recommended having two years between the births of my children.  He said that giving my incision two years to heal would lessen the chance that a problem would arise during a subsequent c-section or that I would hemorrhage during a vbac.  Hope that helps!|`|174a0c67c52bf2d640d056db3d05e137aa	i don't think she wants another right after she has this baby. its hard on your body having a baby cesarean way. i would wait for a while.|`|kcdB6sswaa	I would wait several months and make sure your healed.  Probably wait at least 2-4 regular cycles.  This will help insure a better second pregnancy too.
Ohsqy2xoaa	you look fine, everyone is different.  you have gained a little more than normal at this point as well so that could add to it.  I was showing from about 8 weeks and have always looked ahead but baby is measuring just where he should be.  My total weight gain is 40 lbs and i am 40+ weeks|`|yznZqcznaa	Wow you are really big for 23 weeks.  However I dont think it means you will have a big baby unless you have gestational diabetes.  30 lbs at only 23 weeks seems pretty high.  Has your Doctor said anything to you about that?  I mean that is only a little over half way there.|`|FAQldsUZaa	For about 5 1/2 months pregnant, your belly is a little big... You very well might be carrying a big baby, or you could be a little further along then you think. That happened to me w/ my 1st child... the dr said she was measuring big, but she was only 6lbs 13oz.|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	You're 23 weeks and 1 day pregnant and you've already gained 30 lbs? That's just craziness. I only gained 30 lbs my whole pregnancy. I'd say that if you're eating junk food (chips, cookies, soda) stuff like that...cut it out! You're putting on more weight than you need. Start drinking water and eating tons of fruits and veggies. If you are eating healthy and so forth, then I would honestly say you're having a large baby. Good luck!|`|UADLdXBtaa	My mom looked like she was having twins when she was pregnant with my brother but it wasn't customary to get sonograms in the 70's unless you thought something was wrong. My sister, who was two, could stand under my mom's belly and hide from her! At birth he was 11 lbs 4 oz. I don't recommend going the natural route like she did though! He was a chub as a baby but soon grew out of it and was a 6'4" rail thin kid in HS and hasn't gained much weight since.|`|DNygQdmVaa	you don look too big.  I was around that size when i was 23 weeks, i had gained 26 pounds by that point.    my baby weighed 1 pound 12 ounces, he was premature.|`|fHgbL046aa	You do look kind of big, but that doesn't mean a larger baby. Your doctor can estimate the size. I was 8lb 3oz,my boyfriend was only 3or 4 pounds(he was a twin) and our daughter was 8lb 12oz. I gained 39 pounds in my pregnancy.|`|5X6C4s7zaa	awww..you look adorable, don't worry about it.  As long as the baby is healthy and moving around in there you will be fine.  Maybe the doctors are off about your due date.|`|EzbJsE5eaa	It's a good chance the baby could be big. I know I weighed 8lbs 10oz, and my mom was miserable with me! :) One of my other friends that was pregnant also showed very well, and her baby came out to be pretty big. Don't be surprised if that baby comes out to be a bit bigger than you'd imagined.|`|fVpRVofLaa	Maybe you are further along than you think.|`|X3gbFDnDaa	You look further along in your picture|`|prq0Y1Jaaa	Hi, congrats! I always show bigger than my weeks and have done with all my pregnancies, my babies have weighed between 5 lbs 7ozs(5weeks early first baby)  - 9lbs  1oz, you might be carrying a lot of waters. I found my biggest baby the easier to deliever. Good luck|`|pjgMW6qaaa	you look fine  or maybe because youve gained 30 lbs    i didnt start gaining weight till i was 23 weeks and the total gain weight for me was 21 lbs and my belly was really big everyone thought i was having twins.    youre belly looks fine and very cute by the way.    congrats.    by the way i was a 9 lbs baby and my daughter was only 6 lbs 5 oz|`|Jswomud7aa	It depends on your height and weight, or body mass index (BMI), before you conceived.     If pre-pregnancy weight was in the healthy range for your height according to your healthcare provider (a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9), you should gain between 25 and 35 pounds, gaining 2 to 5 pounds in the first trimester and about 1 pound per week for the rest of your pregnancy for the optimal growth of your baby.    If you were underweight for your height at conception (a BMI below 18.5), you should gain 28 to 40 pounds. If you were overweight for your height (a BMI of 25 to 29.9), you should gain 15 to 25 pounds. If you were obese (a BMI of 30 or higher), you should gain no more than 15 pounds. If you're having twins you should gain about 35 to 45 pounds. If you fall into any of these four categories, talk to your healthcare provider about how much you should gain each month..    Tracking your weight gain weekly may help you feel more in control and give you a chance to make some adjustments in your eating before the total weight gain gets out of control.    Pregnant women should increase their total calorie intake ONLY 300 calories per day!    I gained 35 lbs with my first and 40 lbs with my second and my doctor was telling me I was gaining too much!|`|XCueIYnYaa	You could be having a big baby, or it could mean you may be a couple weeks farther than predicted before. You never know for sure, if you are within 2 weeks of your due date, they say you were "on time"  Best of Luck|`|OKarH9Zsaa	They may have Miss calculated your due date.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	I measured 3 weeks ahead during almost my entire pregnancy.  I gained 70lbs by the day I delivered and had a 9lb4oz baby.  So yes, you may have a big baby.|`|LrHPqW0aaa	I measured 2 weeks further too with this pregnancy but I make big babies my last 2 was 9lbs 11oz. and 9lbs. 3.2oz.. You look real good in your picture.  If your sugar level is too high I would worry about you having a big baby but if that is fine your baby should weigh around your birth weight, I think.  Talk to your Dr. about your concerns of having a big baby.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	I`m only 26w0d and i look full term already.lol.here is my pic at 25w4d.Which i`m carrying him really low.  http://i273.photobucket.com/albums/jj224...  http://i273.photobucket.com/albums/jj224...  iv gained 41 pounds which is awful!but its all in my belly.
Z8Ui1ugLaa	My first pregnancy they didn't perform many u/s's and kept telling me that my baby was around 6lbs.  Well he was born 9lbs. 14oz.  w/ a c-section.  My second, I went to a new Dr. and he monitored the size of the baby with u/s throughout because I wanted to go V-Bac.  She always measured about a week big. They never formally "changed" my due date, but I was induced a week early and she was 8 lbs. 12 oz.  so if I carried her to her proposed "due date" she also would have been around 10lbs.     So for me the u/s's were correct on my infants size.  Good Luck|`|g5RS83paaa	maybe you're farther along than you think. Have you been check for gestational diabetes, that can make babies very large. I had i with mine and had to eat no sugar, he was 8.2 lbs but would have been bigger if I hadn't stopped sugar|`|rUPjr7hjaa	I was measuring about a week sooner also.  They didn't move my date, but they would have if I was measuring 10 days sooner.  My baby was a week early and weighed 9.4.|`|pWA3gybAaa	wow 5.5 pounds is tiny, just have the kid|`|ZusC87WBaa	When I had my ultrasound with this last pregnancy, the tech said he measured 1 week ahead.  Every time I went to see my midwife and was measured, I measured 1 week ahead.  My baby was born on his due date (my original due date....wasn't adjusted any) and he was 7lbs. 11ozs.  Certainly not a large baby.  I wouldn't worry about it at this point...especially since it's not your first baby.|`|y5i8GIFWaa	sorry i wouldn't know im on 13 and i haven't got to that stage    YET  lolx        well...........since you have had your children   i was wondering what pain did you get during periods and birth?, because im getting to that period stage and im getting curious to what i should do or be feeling...should i be feeling tired .......or harsh cramps in my ovary area ?   help!!  i need to know!  lol    good luck with your question anyway   :)    email me on      :      TheBlueDevil_SKJC_@hotmail.co.uk|`|HIyPtsOhaa	yeah youre screwed|`|ca9dEvSAaa	My baby has measured ahead my whole pregnancy. I've had 7 ultrasounds (high risk patient) and she is now 8 days ahead. The doctor has not moved up my due date, but has said to be prepared early. My induction is already scheduled 7 days post due date. My baby was 3 lbs 14 oz at 30 weeks! AHH, Im scared she'll be large, because her father and I were both large babies.    Don't worry to much, the doctors will take care of you and your little one.|`|AA11099771	I'm 29 weeks and due April 22nd with my first. My last appointment showed that i was also measuring a week ahead ans i too got a little nervous. But, my BFF who just delivered Jan. 15th was induced early because she was told the same thing, that her baby was measuring really big. But to everyone's surprise her baby weighed only 6lbs 10ozs, which was smaller than her first born at 7lbs 3ozs. The doctors and nurses were so sure that this baby would more than top her first baby's weight. So maybe it's just a miscalculation and nothing for you to worry about. It sure made me feel a little better about my baby possibly being on the big side.
mc6YtaRbaa	It's probably the iron in the prenatal vitamins and increased blood flow. There are a few things that will make it a little better, but it will not go away for awhile. You can eat ginger snap cookies. They will cover the taste pretty well or drink a little bit of pop that seemed to help me.|`|a6103b5448a81b3f2d761f035154c522aa	It may be your prenatals or just a pregnancy thing.  Blood flow to the gums and nose increase with pregnancy and sometimes that can cause a sensitivity to tastes/smells and more bacteria growth.|`|JMDQr0tqaa	I have had this even when not being pregnant. Like I feel like brushing just doesn't do it and either does mouth wash.  But, this time around my mouth feels like this and I'm 14 weeks.
vue9NOhYaa	You lie on your side.  Baby lies beside you, belly to belly.  YOu don't have to support baby's head OR your breast, because  you are lying down, so the matress supports you.  All you need to do (when baby is very young) is guide baby's head a bit.  And, as baby gets older, you don't even need to do that.     Is is possible to nurse lying on your back?  I suppose so, but it seems pretty awkward, esp. when baby is young. You WOULD have to support her head, and crane your own neck so you can see what you're doing.     Once you start doing it, nursing lying down (on your side)  is not awkward.  Like anything else new, it just takes a bit of practice.  Sitting in a chair is fine too, but you'll probably find, when baby wakes for that third night feeding in a row, that lying down so you can snooze while baby eats is the easier option.|`|KmC0K59taa	You lie on your side.  Prop your arm up on your head or under the pillow.  Have your baby lie on his side facing your breast so he can nurse.  Just get up and lie on your other side if you need to switch breasts.  That's the only way I ever did it lying down anyway!  I had several breastfeeding books with pictures and I recall that being the only way to nurse while lying down.|`|xRiQUZt5aa	Don't do it on your back.    I know it seems weird until you do it. My oldest daughter would ONLY nurse lying down, and all my others loved nursing that way most of the time, too.    Put the baby next to you on her back. Then turn toward her and have her turn her toward you, so you're both on your sides facing each other. Just support the breast with your opposite hand and you can put your arm around baby and bring her close to you. Put the nipple right near her mouth. She will latch on. It will be totally fine.    Actually, I think nursing while lying down is awesome and very comfortable. It is also very easy once you get the hang of it.
Iqifd3SGaa	It is a tiny stick like swab that they put in your vagina and rectum, they barely put it in though. It is just around the opening. It isn't that bad, maybe a little uncomfortable when they put it in bum. But yes I just had that like 2 weeks ago and that is what they did. It didn't hurt or anything and they don't use any thing like they do when you get a pap.|`|b3CwObBdaa	it's a cotton swab, they do a quick swipe of both.|`|MtC3CWZraa	It's more of a running it across the bum area with a giant q-tip. Mine was far less invasive than the internal exam that followed.|`|mBeGdFO2aa	I had it done a few weeks ago, very quick and very painless..both areas were swabbed at the same time so I assume it was kind of a 'double-ended' swabber :)  Don't think twice about it, it was over in a fraction of a second.|`|0uhRgfcsaa	when i had mine at 37 weeks, they just stuck a little cotton swab in me. nothin up my butt but Ive heard they do a lot. idk.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	No, nothing goes "up your bum".  They use a long q tip like what would be used for a pap smear and swab around your rectum. (They also do a swab around your vagina, with a different q tip of course)  It's over by the time you feel it.|`|C55pji5Qaa	Some doctors do both a vaginal and rectal swab. Mine did not, only vaginal.It did not hurt,they used a q-tip looking thing and just swabbed.|`|RzYePezkaa	no they just take the long cotton swab and rub it around down there and on the butt area.It does not hurt and only takes a couple of seconds.|`|ba11762437a3276bc8acfec56128a271aa	Yes they will do a full pelvic exam, and yes they stick a swab up your bum. It sounds worse than it really is. I didn't really even feel mine, its done very quickly. Congrats on the baby! Not long to go now!|`|XyAWAoSoaa	They take a swab and rub it around your vagina.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	My Dr did use a speculum (the metal thing) and they just take a quick swab with a big Q-Tip  and a swab of your butthole. They don't stick anything in it. Just a quick swipe.|`|LABC73E7aa	all they do is run the swab up and down ur vagina and rectal area. its painless.
mBeGdFO2aa	My dr started checking me at 38 weeks....but it really doesn't matter :)  Your state of dialation really has nothing to do with when labour will begin, you could be dialated for weeks or you can stay closed until right when you go into labour.  (but I know it's nice to know, I've been checked the last two appts and will be checked again tomorrow!)    I don't really think your dr will check today, but ask when she'll start :)|`|fVpRVofLaa	They should start checking very soon!|`|AA11612508	yes, and ask her to check. i was 3 cm for a month before my planned induction.|`|xRiQUZt5aa	I think they start doing that again in the last two weeks or so - unless you start showing signs of labor earlier.|`|AA12358335	Just this week I hit 38 weeks and had my first internal exam. So if your dr.'s not checking now, s/he will start SOON!|`|7uVlYPEIaa	I was never checked with my twins, he asked if i felt any signs of labor, i said no and stats were all good. First time I was checked was when I went in for my induction at 38 weeks. My son it seemed like that DR checked from 30 weeks on. Depends on the doc and if you are showing any signs.|`|nfLyS1toaa	they should check. my dr. starts checking at 36 weeks. and from here on out you will go every week.|`|MtC3CWZraa	Mine started at week 36
JnLoHaoAaa	About 10 or so|`|mjlhZAVxaa	Since 6:30am (the time my son wakes) til now, 2:30pm I have changed him 4 times.    He is napping now, so I am sure I will change him a few more times before bed!  Maybe 5 more times.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	it depends on how often you change them, ideally they should be changed every couple of hours at least to avoid diaper rash and  them laying  there wet. and when they nap, any time they wake up they need a fresh diaper,  alot of it depends on their sleeping habits.  but 8-11 seems about right.|`|1dueLOdvaa	They should go through anywhere from 8-11 diapers a day.|`|MQ34YW28aa	my son is 9 weeks now and he uses about 8 diapers a day but when younger it was about 10 or so.|`|EAzyjftKaa	The first month about 10 and then it changes I am down to 1 pullup at night and sometimes it's dry in the morning we are 3 yr. old|`|1ZGDnSX4aa	around 11|`|AA10478146	I just asked my sister in-law (who has 3 kids and a newborn) and she said about 10.|`|AA11429685	between  10-15..... I say go to Sam's club or Costco's and stock up...lol|`|NIEt2CEZaa	Im not sure but if your baby is spitting up a lot or throwing up formula a lot then you are over feeding which would lead to a lot more diapers than normal.     I have three sons but they are way past the diaper age so i can't remember the number per day.    Another good tip is if your baby is fed by formula and it has iron make sure they drink a bottle of applejuice once a day so they don't get constipated.|`|W0gMQVoDaa	i would say about 10 xx|`|QYDIgOp0aa	Ok, different people will say different things cause some poeple change a lot and some don't..I personally change my son EVERY TIME I see that he has peed or pooped..Now I will tell ya, I get critisized a lot for that..People are like well it won't hurt him to pee a few times, well my theory is.. I wouldn't wanna sit in pee..My son is 4.5 months and he goes though atleast 13 a day. Some poeple will tell ya to do the every 2 hour theory but I just can't know that he has peed and not change him..My diaper bill is about $80 a month and I use papmpers swaddlers!! Oh & because I change him so often he has NEVER had a diaper rash!!|`|hXoUFWL1aa	my son is 3 months and he has always gone through about 8-10 daily
khM3eZnZaa	Okay those tests arn't all that great honestly. I mean some women have way clearer results then others but the others can never seem to get a clear answer. You may not be pregnant so calm down a little bit. First you need to go to a doctor and get eveything checked out because that will be the most reliable test.    Just thought I should share this with you. When my mum was pregnant with me the plus sign was very faint. But another time she was having the same thing happen to her for a couple of mounths and she took sseveral pregnacy test and they all read the light plus sign but it turned out just be a hormonal in-balence.|`|AA12361841	those tests are pretty accurate.I would try one more. if its negetive ur not pregnant. If you are trying good luck!|`|5UoLngxfaa	i say wait alittle longer like another week and then if its still says no go to the doc and get a blood test|`|YFPMcHCbaa	I'm really getting tired of seeing this type of question on here. None of the people on here will be able to tell you if you're pregnant. All the symptoms you get during pregnancy can also be associated with something else.  Take a test, or do some research. There are so many different places to get great information on the web.    babycenter.com  pregnancy.org  pregnancy.com  americanpregnancy.org  webmd.com/baby  pregnancy360.com  fitpregnancy.com  surebaby.com  pregnancytoday.com  pregnancy-calendars.org|`|e64yqjCXaa	seems like you either really are pregnant or you have some major problems with your body.    I would go see your doctor or your gynocologist right away, because if you are pregnant you want to be taken care of. you would want to be taken care of if you were sick, too.|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	I would say to go to the doctors and get a blood test done for pregnancy. If it turns out that you're not pregnant, it may just be that your cycle is changing as you get older. Mine did! At 19, I knew exactly when I'd get my cycle and it always came on that day. When I turned 22, my cycle started changing and now I can never judge when it's going to come. I can always say though that it only stays around for a few short days. Good luck!|`|UADLdXBtaa	If you are stressed out, that could make your period late. It is also a possibility that the "spotting" you had last week could have been your period, it just doesn't look normal. That happens to me sometimes, but I am on the pill so it could be different for me. The only way to know for sure is to make a Dr. appointment and get a urine or blood test. I would go just because of the symptoms you are having. You may not be pregnant but something else could be wrong too like an ovarian cyst or something. If you are going to have unprotected sex and don't want to get pregnant, you should figure out your ovulation cycle and then make sure you don't have sex on your most fertile days.|`|3sGtibk5aa	some tests might give a false answer, the best thing to do is go get a ultra sound, or get a test done by the doctor. Blood tests work alor better than pregnancy tests aswel, so maybe try that.  Every symptom sounds like you may be pregnant.  Good luck :-)  x|`|f9b85050d33b3fd3ebe8752d14b6659baa	It sure sounds like it! I would go to a doctor if i were you and see what happens. The pregnancy tests you took were probly wrong. but especially with those symtoms, those sound right... and not just a hormonal freak out or something. I would understand missing it if you were depressed.. but if you wern't i mean... my guess is you are most likely pregnant.|`|5919d59a9a07aac4e14c50ba4d7d46b9aa	go to your doctor!|`|mMZo0Tbbaa	I think you are pregnant.  get a blood test taken as soon as possible just to be on the safe side.     First of all calm down...stress can delay a period    if your going to have unprotected sex take plan B    although it should not be used as a regular birth control method|`|96HWpdkFaa	You should go to the doctors for a blood test.  It could also be a a hormone imbalance so check that out if your not preg.|`|VUNfI7yBaa	Maybe you should try one of the tests that tell you "pregnant" or "not pregnant" That will make things clearer.    If you are, well congrats. Babies are so precious. I have two of them, they bring such joy|`|AA10186411	Sounds like you are pregnant.  People seriously need to realize that just because it didn't happen before, that doesn't mean it won't happen now.  You could very well have gotten pregnant.  See a doctor.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	It's possible to have a false negative on a pregnancy test.  If you want to be sure, go to your doctor and have them do a pregnancy test.  There could be other reasons why you are having an irregular period.  Again...see your doctor.|`|XCueIYnYaa	It sounds like you could be. Congrats! I would wait about a week and then take another. If still nothing I would be going to see a doctor and get a blood test.  Best of Luck.
mbh3eex7aa	It is standard procedure so they can not get sued if you were pregnant because X-Rays can harm the baby.|`|27a59a3f8abd3e63add7b64e8f5a132aaa	They just need to make sure you are not pregnant for their own liability.  They aren't trying to judge you, but they have to test every woman before they do x-rays.  If you were pregnant, by any chance, the x-rays could be harmful.|`|joPJtKemaa	They must make sure that you are not pregnant.    Pregnant women are not allowed to take x-rays. Its radiation.|`|xue72D76aa	It is a precautionary measure.  If you were pregnant and they gave you an x-ray, you could turn around and sue them for not checking first before the x-ray.  They don't want the possibility of lawsuits, so they cover their bases by testing all sexually mature females.|`|iq5uwobOaa	it is legal.   they have signs posted that if you think you are pregnant let the x-ray tech know.|`|N83Po9PZaa	Yeah, when I was fourteen, I needed x-rays and had to go through the same thing....in front of my mom! It was horrible, I was still a virgin and not even allowed to have a boyfriend yet, but they don't know that. Just warn your daughter of it in the future, so she won't be caught off guard.|`|dPULl5hjaa	They could ask you are you pregnant or might be?|`|MtC3CWZraa	It's a liability issue. They were just covering their tails less you were pregnant and they did x rays on you causing some damage.|`|PN7ELn3aaa	They do it to protect the fetus (if one could possibly be there). I took one when I was 16 before I had chest x-rays done. It is just procedure. I live in Orlando too.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	The reason for that is bc pregnant women shouldn't have an xray. The concern is the radiation "can" cause birth defects. Will one xray hurt anything..probably not but they are covering themselves is all.|`|TXddP0uxaa	If you are or have been sexually active in the last few months, they always do a pregnancy test.  The law requires that they do so, because an x-ray can do damage to a fetus.|`|FgAPXhVRaa	X-rays are harmful to you, not horribly harmful but still... and they are very harmful to babies. I had to had chest x-rays at 19 weeks and they put this shield thing around my tummy. I would bet that is just their precaution to make sure that if you are pregnant the baby is not affect by the radiation from the x-ray! Don't worry or take insult, they were just protecting you by making sure they were covering all areas of questioning!
pXSKSS3daa	My son started this "swimming" deal around 6 months but didn't actually crawl until this past week. He just turned 10 months yesterday.|`|mjlhZAVxaa	It depends.  My son would scoot around starting at 4 months of age.  My niece started crawling at 6 months!  Actually CRAWLING too!!!  Crazy!  My son didn't start crawling until he was 8 1/2 months.  My other niece who is a week older than him crawled at 7 months.    My son would do this one arm push thing, he would sit up and scoot with his arm, and his butt!  It was very weird.  I honestly thought he was just going to do that and then just walk, but one day he was with my husband and he just did it!  So it really just depends on the baby ;)
BWL2P49oaa	I would take him into the dr.  I haven't heard of many babies who are still SO distraught after trying all of those things.      Other than that, here are a few tips that worked for us:  Gentle Naturals Homeopathic teething drops  sliced lemon, making sure to remove seeds and supervise  pickle, just big enough to knaw on and watch he doesn't choke   (the last two are highly acidic, and you should be careful using them once teeth are in.  Make sure to wipe his teeth afterward to keep the enamel for wearing)  ground cloves, add just enough water for a paste and it will numb his gums    Other than that, I can just offer you the consolation that it won't last forever and good luck!|`|3F8bCZ55aa	If walking seems to comfort him them walk.  I sometimes use a bouncer for my granddaughter during those times. It seems to work.  So does the swing.|`|TZN0v8r4aa	I know this sounds gross but wash your hands and see if he'll gnaw in a finger or knuckle.  One niece would gnaw on my finger, necklace, slim jim beef jerky.  My necklace wasn't just any necklace but an amulet on a leather chain because didn't trust her to play with gold.  A nephew liked to suck on bolitos, they're frozen juice in plastic tubes to freeze as ice pops.  Oldest would suck a wet wash cloth.  Didn't have to be cold just something to suck on.|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	First thing you can do is offer all the comfort and cuddles they want... when they need more...    * Freeze a wet (clean) rag and let them gnaw away at it.  * Teething toys: especially the frozen teething rings (all babies prefer different ones... Jude likes the combi ones that give age ranges for different teeth coming in)  * Freeze a spoon and let your little one gnaw on it supervised.  * Mesh teethers:  freeze fruit chunks or freeze applesauce/baby food in ice cube trays and pop in the teether  * Popsicles or freeze-pops (stickless popsicles)   * Teething biscuits, you can also freeze the teething biscuits (if they are old enough to eat them safely) for recipes: www.wholesomebabyfood.com/teethingbiscui...  * Frozen mini-bagels or bananas (if they are old enough to eat them safely)  * Massage the gums with your finger (you can also massage vanilla onto the gums, it helps soothe the pain)  *Teething tablets (Hyland's) or teething drops (Gentle Naturals)   * Oragel, sparingly... if your baby can stand it... be careful it can affect their gag reflex, make sure it has worn off before feeding the baby; it also tastes terrible, and it is easy for your LO to swallow more than he should of it.  * OTC Medication: Acetaminophen/Tylenol or Ibuprofen/Motrin (ONLY if your child is over 6 months) Always use the recommendations by your child's weight. Only use as a last resort, as teething will last a long time and you want to save the pain meds for the days (and nights) they REALLY need it.|`|VUNfI7yBaa	Maybe it isn't teething. Did it just start today? Have you got him immunized in last couple of days? My son cried non stop after immunizations. \\  For his teeth i gave him teething tablets. it's got Chamomile it is supposed to calm them, it worked for him,\\   You should call your doc, maybe their is an advice nurse    I wouldnt do popcicles, it might brake off and choke on it. Thier are these feeders you can get it is like a pacifier with a big net on it that you put frozen food in and they just chew on it|`|h59Bc4wfaa	Frozen waffles are awesome! They even have built in drool cups, lol. But, wait. He doesn't like cold stuff. Try getting a clean wash rag wet with cool water and letting him chew on that for a bit. Sounds like you have tried just about everything, so the only other thing you could do is just sympathize with him.|`|kLYoRiFeaa	call ur pedi right away...sounds like more than teehing...maybe reflux...|`|4ksa4lhWaa	That does not sound like teething to me,  call your doc.      But you could try a wet cool washcloth and let him suck on that.  And see if that helps also take him for a ride in the car to help calm him
jNErU39iaa	How much rice do you put in a bottle? Hmmm.. that's a tough one. How about NONE?    FOOD is eaten of a SPOON not drunk through a bottle.  Didn't you go to antenatal classes?  Not only is it a choking hazard - but if your baby can't eat it off a spoon, guess what, he's not old enough to eat.     You might not like what you've heard darl, but it's the truth. Obviously, there's no 'chart' available because you are not supposed to do it.  I'd seriously go and have a chat to your doctor, why the hell would you want to feed your baby at such a young age? Why??|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	thats ridiculous..he isnt READY for FOOD  putting food in a bottle is a choking hazard  your child could have   digestive disorders  obesity  diabetes   hypoglycemia  You dont know what youre doing|`|4604flr2aa	Just because your family has been doing it doesn't make it right.    But if you're going to do it anyway, knowing it's not best for your baby, do it whatever way you like.  Right?|`|UMRdHuuVaa	DO NOT PUT CEREAL IN A BOTTLE!!    IT IS A CHOKING HAZARD!!    PLEASE USE YOUR COMMONSENSE.    Do you drink cereal from a bottle??  Than do not inflict such idiocy on a helpless child!  I swear this must be an american thing, NO ONE i know has ever done that here in australia - we would be flogged if we did something so stupid.  Oh to the poster above - obviously the doctor isn't too bright either.  ** As a side note - i started my son on solids at 3 months, but would never give him anything but water or milk in his bottle.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	My doc told me to put in a half a scoop per 2 ounces, i was told this when she was 9 weeks, it was to help her gas and spitting up.  Sometimes ill put it thinner or thicker.. there isnt a certain amount or a chart that explains.  Its really up to you and your preference.. if he likes it that way, id say its fine.    Why would a doc recommend it, if it was hazardess????  And unless your making it like actual cereal, there is no risk of choking.    Many people chose to put cereal in an infants bottle, and most doctors do not see a problem with it.  And i much rather take the advice of a doctor over someone on YA.    There are many health and medical sites that tell you exactly what my doc told me, for the treating of acid reflux.|`|AA10526033	well since you arent supposed to give a 2 month old cereal and you arent supposed to put it in a bottle at all i doubt there is a chart. you are supposed to wait for a bunch of reasons one being too much iron ive known atleast 3 kids who have had hernias due to too much iron. talk to a dr please. jar baby food at 3 months is a great way to choke your kid. babies just arent ready their digestive tracks are immature to its really not a good idea talk to your dr please. if your baby is still hungry give him more formula! no reason formula wont fill him up.  yes some drs will recommend putting cereal in a bottle for spitting up or reflux the pros outweigh the cons in that senario. i have never heard of a dr saying feed them cereal to fill them up. if my dr said that im thinking id switched docs. its commonsense  go to the site below. it talks about why you wait for solids pay close attention to the tongue thrust reflex. most babies under 4 months push things out of their mouth with their tongue to stop them from choking. so one of 2 things will happen, your baby will choke or they wont get enough food. then look up too much iron for babies and find another reason to wait for cereal. its just not worth it.   sorry im done now.|`|lMvwVvqbaa	i gave my daughter one to two scoops in her bottle. and my son like three because he was a little pig!|`|1SGl03Zlaa	It is not recommended to put rice cereal in a bottle because it is a choking hazard.  If you want to give him cereal feed it to him in a spoon, just make it really runny.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	I'm glad that it is 'like a generation' but your baby doesn't need it. There may not have been any food allergies in the past but why would you want to risk your baby to be the first.   Putting cereal in the baby's bottle is a no-no. It could cause the baby to aspirate. Please read some studies on this.|`|pZg05uygaa	First of all, you shouldn't put rice cereal in a bottle, it's a choking hazard. It should only be fed with a spoon. Secondly, your baby is too young (sorry, I know you've heard it before) to be having solids. The absolute minimum age to have solids is 4 months...your baby's immune and digestive systems are too immature to handle anything but formula or breastmilk. He will not be able to digest the food and will lose calories and nutrients since it will make him full and miss a meal of breastmilk/formula.   You're right, everything will turn out fine, it wont kill him or anything but it is far from the best thing for a 2 1/2 month old. A generation or two doctors used to advised this to get babies to sleep through the night, but the information around this is now obsolete.|`|B1JFBV3jaa	For all of the "SOLID FOOD BEFORE 6 MONTHS" bashing parents out there, for your information, my daughter has been consuming rice cereal in her bottle since she was about 2.5 months and she is perfectly healthy.      She asked a question for people that obviously partake in cereal feeding their children.  If you don't, you should find another question to answer.  She didn't ask for approval.    To answer your question, dear, I put 1/2 a scoop for 4 oz. bottles, 1 scoop for 6 oz bottles, and 2 scoops for 8 oz. bottles.  It satisfies my daughter more than regular formula.    And for all of the breastfeeding nazis that are going to tell me that "if I breastfed her, she wouldn't need to depend on formula to satisfy her", before you judge, understand that I DRIED UP AT 6 WEEKS.  So no need to waste your breath.    My daughter is also eating jar baby food (she is 5 months) and has been doing so since 4 months.  She LOVES it and even whines for it sometimes.  She loves Sweet Potatos and Carrots.  :-)    There isn't a chart to go by.  It's more up to your discretion.  Just don't make it too thick and be sure to change the size of the nipple you are using so that he is able to actually get the slightly thicker formula through it.    Good luck!!!  :-)
kaqPSgTVaa	Go to Planned Parenthood but when you take birth control it STOPS you from ovulating so you probably didn't ovulate when you think you did. You also are going to have a messed up cycle for a while because your body is confused.     Go to Planned Parenthood. They don't need insurance and don't charge very much. I doubt you are pregnant.
kcdB6sswaa	Its normal... pelvic softens before delivery.  Try reclining on the couch on your left side more.  Sometimes that helps.  Don't over do it, you will need your energy soon enough.  I was never a fan of walking or anything to induce labor (didn't work for me).|`|W8aiAWe2aa	It might be sciatica? (nerve pain)  Try taking pain killers and rub some massage oil or embrocation in the area of pain.    see your Gp if the pain has not eased up after the weekend.    EDIT  Baby can press on nerves causing sciatic nerve pain!|`|F89MNQheaa	Any amount of pain like this and you should go to the doctors and get it checked. We can give our oppinions but until you are examined then you wont know for sure.|`|iwtetdBoaa	ttry resting  mines been doing this also  im 38 weeks today-babys pushing on ur pelvic

Using, smoking, and drinking are all horrible things to do while your pregnant, however I think at your age you would realize any left over effects. You did most likely have problems when you were first born though.|`|6wUojgSRaa	they end up being a lil  "drrrr" (sound it out)
iR9w7d7Yaa	Hiya,  When i lost my twins at 16 weeks my boobs leaked for about 2 weeks then stopped. It was excrutiating pain and i was going through breast pads like no tomorrow so i can totally relate with you.   I really hope it dries up soon for you. I got my period about 4 weeks after my loss and it was heavy. I must admit it did take quite a few months for them to settle down too. I didn't start ttc for a long time afterwards because my partner didn't want to and then we split up soi can't give you any advice on how long it should take etc,  I am so sorry for your loss xx|`|sk46uigvaa	I had periods throughout the 3 years that i breastfed my daughter.  They were always bang on 28 days as well.    Just let your milk dry out it will be fine.    Good luck! x|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	there are tablets to stop this, check the GP.|`|DVmDWDC4aa	Firstly, I'm so, so sorry. I really feel for you.    Secondly, I'm afraid this is really normal. They may leak for several weeks yet. If they are still leaking for over a month, then I'd see a doctor, but 9 days really isn't long for it.    You want to make sure you have at least two periods in between your horrible experience and trying for another baby, to ensure your body and hormone levels get back to normal, to give your next pregnancy the best chance of survival.    Good luck sweetheart.|`|FmSWPS7Paa	sorry to hear about your loss    however, it shouldnt take that long for the milk to dry up!  good luck and dont give up!|`|93d1272e676f48f0eee8d8378c0b91f2aa	I'm so sorry for your loss. your milk will dry up, just give it time. I lost a baby through miscarriage years ago right before Christmas and once i finished bleeding i got pregnant straight away. my son is now 18 years of age and perfectly healthy.   Good luck hun.xx|`|OJFz0LBZaa	im really sorry for your loss, when i had my son at 26 weeks but sadly he died 18hours later my breast leaked for about 2 weeks, like you it  wasn't much and your doing the right thing not not expressing just let it dry by its self, i then had a period the next month and fell pregnant after my 2nd period, doctors do say wait 3 months before trying again but i felt i and my body was ready to try again, wishing you all the best for the future xx
PN7ELn3aaa	Yeah, I'm a server and I almost cannot make our chocolate cake dessert for a table for fear that I will either buy one for myself or "disappear" before the table gets theirs. ;)|`|RzYePezkaa	lol yup except my craving right now is bacon but chocolate sounds yummy right now|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Hmmm that chocolate fudge frosting sounds good! It's totally normal to have these cravings for things that you don't usually like.|`|M9ApBTYvaa	I ate cinnamon red hots during my pregnancies, and I don't especially like them.  I think you should go to the store or send someone else to buy you a few cans of frosting to hold you over until after the baby's born.|`|yznZqcznaa	I cant wait to get to the craving stage.  I am in the food aversion stage where nothing sounds good to me.  I can hardly stomach anything at all without getting the gross feeling in my stomach.  I can no longer eat any meat, usually I just ate chicken, now I am practically a vegetarian.  I just cant wait till food sounds good again.|`|joPJtKemaa	I never craved sweets, but now all I can think of is a  big strawberry short cake with a lot of frosting.|`|osDB2fSRaa	LOL!!!

8WRnqs08aa	In 2006 I suffered a miscarriage. I didn't find out that baby had died until the 13th week, but I do remember that I had a foul odor appear shortly after I discovered I was pregnant @ 7 weeks. The baby had stopped growing @ 8 weeks. After my D&C the odor was gone. From what you described, I would say it sounds like you possibly did have a miscarriage and for the doctor just to flush the toilet is preposterous. Get a different Dr. next time!    Good Luck|`|627pWyVkaa	Ive never had one but i have had friends that had them and didnt know at the time they were about 3 months pregnant, and said they passed it when they went to the bathroom. Never anything about a smell or anything. If you were pregnant it could explain why you had positive then negatives after a while the hcg will go very low and it wont detect pregnancy anymore which might explain why after it said negative.... or vice versa depending how you took them. Honestly If that was my doctor i would go with another doctor. I know here in canada just because your female any abdominal or urinary tract problems or possible ones they always test for pregnancy first, mostly because its the cheaper of the tests and can cause a lot of other symptoms.   I would get another doctor. And Im sorry it sounds like you passed it in the bathroom.|`|umGzyElZaa	I had a miscarriage, I didn't get to see what the baby looked like when the took it out, but my husband did :o(    He said it looked like a small blood clot (i was only about 4weeks) and there was some skin colored looking tissue on one side of it.     I have never heard anything about a foul smell, but it would make sense that it may produce one. I also have NEVER heard of a false positive pregnancy test. I was only 3 weeks prego when I took mine, and it showed positive. Now, I have a son and when I found out I was pregnant with him...it was about the same! I got pregnant shortly after valentines day, and found out the end of the month...It was pretty quick. So it picks up on that hormone pretty accurately.    I would say that you were pregnant and that you probably did have one.  Just my opinion. If you did, I am very sorry. I know it hard and even not knowing for sure is enough! Your time will come!|`|Jswomud7aa	It's more likely than not you were pregnant and what you passed in the toilet was a miscarriage.     But your doctor seems like a friggin jerk! Not explaining anything to you are asking you how you felt or recommending any advice! I'd get a new doctor!|`|5yAsj29Vaa	It does, but if what came out of you was a fetus, your Dr. would have, or at lest should have, told you.  I'd call the Dr. and demand an explanation as to what that mass was.|`|FgAPXhVRaa	I guess that it could have been, I am just not sure why, if it was a miscarriage, that your doctor wouldn't have told you so. I mean the fact that you got 3 positive tests says something... ya know.
5805bf3a9bb2e4808ef2d73593aaab11aa	I'm so sorry about the lack of sleep due to heartburn. I read that heartburn during pregnancy is related to your baby having a lot of hair on it's little head. Something positive to think about during the pain. I would recommend drinking a glass of milk before you hit the sack. That should help ease the attacks. Good luck, and hopefully, sweet dreams. :)|`|Iqifd3SGaa	I get like that a lot and have been for most of my pregnancy. Having ice chips or something to drink like water or Gatorade next to my bed helped sooth it when I got it. You might want to try tums. You can also ask your doctor to prescribe you something a little better but is safe during your pregnancy.|`|419a565a52065b636ce5b8996bdef713aa	I am 39 weeks and have had bad heart burn for over a month now, I was taking tums but now I am taking Zantac and that helps much better.|`|9qkCf6Mlaa	I eat tums like candy..I don't know what I would do with out them.|`|ANVgXpQnaa	WHEN I WAS PREGNANT I HAD HEARTBURN THROUGH THE WHOLE 10 MONTHS.

When I was pregnant with my son I woke up every night and was throwing up it was so bad, TUMS did nothing to help.  My Dr had me take a prescription that really helped.

(the pharmacy ended up giving me Prilosec becasue it was identical to the prescription he wrote)  EDIT also if you can prop yourself up when sleeping or even sleep in a recliner it should help a lot|`|UaL28atDaa	Its possible. Here are some really useful videos about where you should be in terms of development and also what medication you can take for the heartburn without harming your baby.     http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...    http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...|`|AA10780655	Im almost 37 weeks and I have the same thing  Sometimes the heartburn is so bad that my eyes will water  Tums seem to really help me|`|ostF23Omaa	tums will help.

mZzQQUABaa	Not really sure hun, just saw that no one answered yet...try posting again....
vue9NOhYaa	You have several options:    1. You can try to work through your discomfort and get past it. You DO have 7 months yet. Go to LaLeche League meetings. Read books. Most of us have never even seen a nursing baby before we get pregnant, so it's not surprising that it seems a bit strange to you.  We live in a society where bottles ARE the norm.     2. You can decide to do what's best for your baby, even if you makes you uncomfortable.    3. You can pump and bottlefeed, if it's the nursing itself that troubles you. (Though most moms who exclusively pump will tell you that it's FAR more work and bother than just nursing.)     4. You can give formula.     5. You can try breastfeeding, and you'll probably discover that it isn't awkward or bothersome at all.  If you do, then select from  2,  3 or  4.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	Like you said, you have plenty of time to think about it.  Keep reading those benefits and think about what you'll be doing for your baby.  Eventually, focusing on your baby and how important it is for the baby will hopefully make you more comfortable with the idea.  Also, talk with other people who have breastfed their children.  Ask them how they felt about it.  Maybe they had similar feelings about nursing at first then had a change of heart.    As for nursing in public, there are many ways to be discrete about nursing.  There are coverups or you can use a blanket.  I used my jacket to cover up in a restaurant yesterday because I didn't have a blanket with me.  You just practice covering up at home so you'll be more comfortable with it in public.|`|nKwcGLQraa	well, your kid is gonna have to breast feed a few hours after it is born anyways. but after that you can "milk" your breasts and you can bottle feed it to your baby. if your parents or whoever are gonna looka after the baby for a while, you can keep milk in the fridge and even freeze it i you want :).|`|44OH7Si6aa	Read as much as you can on the subject. Talk to a lactation consultant, the hospital you are planning to deliver at should have one you can speak to. He/she can give you information and tips. There may be breastfeeding classes available to you also, go to one. It's possible that once you feel confident that you know what to do you will be more comfortable with the idea of breastfeeding. If not, then it is a personal decision and don't let anyone make it for you.|`|63a5d617239afd4f62c7622fb8d95be3aa	Read loads! Also don't knock it until you try it. I was against breastfeeding when I was pregnant, was adimant I was going to bottle feed. Then when it came to packing my hospital bag I realzied it was going to be too much hassle to take bottles and formula to the hospital. I then decided I will give breastfeeding a go and loved it. Alothough I did stop and wish I continued.    Give it a try! And if you are still not comfortable it will NOT kill your baby to give him/her formula.     You don't see much breast when breastfeeding and it is not something you should be made to feel uncomfortable about. When baby is born try it. Breastfeeding is SOO much easier then bottle feeding any day. If I was going to have another baby I would deffinatly try to breast feed longer.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	There is therapy available, and I think you would benefit from it.  Obviously I do not know you, and have no idea what your past experiences have been. But I will tell you that discomfort about breastfeeding, particularly in a person who grew up in a family with a positive outlook on breastfeeding, can indicate a more serious unresolved issue.  Such as being abused as a child, rape, or self-esteem problems.  The first two are obviously more serious, but all three can impact pregnancy, birth, and your ability to parent.    Honestly though I'm going to assume that you primarily use your vagina for fun?  But the baby is also (presumably) going to come out that way.  And of course your menstrual blood comes out there as well.  Men use their penises (a lot) for fun, but they also use them to pee!  Body parts are rarely single function.    All you can do is try to find the reason for your feelings and work through them.  And then I would strongly encourage you to commit to nursing for at least 8 weeks.  At the end of 8 weeks you will be over the hard parts and will be able to make a real informed decision about whether you want to continue or not.  Its far more difficult to go from bottle feeding to breastfeeding if you feel guilt over your decision.  But you have to firmly commit, or you will find a "reason" to fail which you may regret later on.    http://www.normalfed.com/Why/wean.html  Breastfeeding your baby for even a day is the best baby gift you can give.  Breastfeeding is almost always the best choice for your baby.  If it doesn't seem like the best choice for you right now, these guidelines may help.         IF YOU NURSE YOUR BABY FOR JUST A FEW DAYS, he will have received your colostrum, or early milk.  By providing antibodies and the food his brand-new body expects, nursing gives your baby his first - and easiest - "immunization"and helps get his digestive system going smoothly.  Breastfeeding is how your baby expects to start, and helps your own body recover from the birth.  Given how very much your baby stands to gain, and how little you stand to lose, it just makes good sense to breastfeed for at least a day or two, even if you plan to bottle-feed after that.         IF YOU NURSE YOUR BABY FOR FOUR TO SIX WEEKS, you will have eased him through the most critical part of his infancy.  Newborns who are not breastfed are much more likely to get sick or be hospitalized, and have many more digestive problems than breastfed babies.  After 4 to 6 weeks, you'll probably have worked through any early nursing concerns, too.  Make a serious goal of nursing for a month, call La Leche League or a certified lactation consultant if you have any questions, and you'll be in a better position to decide whether continued breastfeeding is for you.|`|rAkWoweOaa	Make sure your baby gets the colostrum. I know I'm going to get a thumbs down for this, but if you really are that uncomfortable with breastfeeding, then don't do it. Maybe when you see your baby for the first time you will change your mind. I did, and I felt the same way as you.|`|1ZGDnSX4aa	its sounds like your being guilt in to breastfeeding (by yourself) your the one carrying this baby for 9 months everyone one and their babies are different so don't go off of what your mother didi for you. breastfeeding can be very painful not to mention weening him off will be hell and he may be a biter. think of whats best for YOU.|`|2ZoUduoPaa	Before you make a definite answer, comtimplate the idea more.  Talk with a laction consultant or find someone in your area who nurses, that you could befriend.  I wanted so badly to breastfeed, but was unsuccessful.  If, after toying with the idea a bit more, you are still uncomfortable with the idea, don't do it.  Or, wait until the baby gets here, try it, and if it's too much to bear, they will be glad to give the baby formula.    If you want more detailed information, check out a few books from your local library.  Books like "The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding"--This one was great.    If your final decision is not to breastfeed, don't let anyone make you feel guilty.  You are choosing what's best for you and your family--and that is not always the thing that would be "right" for another family.  Your option is your own.        ***On a side note:  The world doesn't have to "watch" you breastfeed.  It can be done very discreetly.  I have a friend who BFs and my husband walked into the room where she and I were once and sat down to have a conversation.  He was completely unaware that the baby was nursing!!!!  You don't have to be the woman walking through walmart with the baby in the buggy and boob in it's mouth!!!    Good luck with the pregnancy and the decision!!!!!      EDIT: NOTE TO MARMALADE:  you do NOT HAVE to breastfeed at all if you don't want to!!!|`|3K7ffKn2aa	I say don't knock it till you try it. Although it may seem as if it will be uncomfortable i doubt you will find it that way. Your not the only person who sees breast as a source of pleasure, and no one says its not, but that's not its only function (just like the vagina). Try and keep an open mind about this have the things around to pump or bottle feed but after you have your baby try it out. At lease you can know you tried to give your baby the best but it just didn't work out. I don't know why you would feel like the world is watching lol i guess just don't do it in public. Just like you changed your mind about children you might change your mind about this. At least  you won't have any regrets if you try.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I feel the same way and I am going to try to pump and then bottle feed the baby my breast milk. If you're not comfortable then don't do it. It's your body and your baby so do what makes you happy and don't listen to anyone else but your heart.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	You have plenty time to think about it and decide. It's your body & your baby, no one's going to judge you if you decide not to breast feed. It is good for your baby if you breast feed. You save lots of money & time too(mixing formula vs just feeding right away).       Read lots of books which you will anyway for your newborn. You might change your mind because it is really easy. Just remember there are many people want to breastfeed but they cannot for many reasons - medical or not producing any milk.      By the way, Congratulations !!|`|145RUNQHaa	Wait until your baby is born and give it a go it will probably feel strange at first but stick at it as long as you can.it felt strange to me at first too but if you can get the hang of it it is worth it for the sake of your baby's heath.if it doesn't work out you can always stop.you don't realise it yet but when you finally lay eyes on your little one your natural instincts will kick in and all you will want to do is your best.|`|wphLaVs6aa	I remember feeling similarly about breastfeeding, but now, I am so happy that I breastfed my baby and that I continue to do so. It's an incredible experience. Breastfeeding is about far more than nutrition. It's also about comfort and bonding. You can give comfort and bond with your baby when you're bottle feeding, of course, but the bonding experience is a built in, oxytocin-induced part of breastfeeding.     Also, breastfeeding is so much easier than pumping. There are no parts to wash (other than your usual shower!), nothing to sterilize, nothing extra to carry. I pump during the weekdays because I work, and it's such a pain. Many moms who exclusively pump will tell you how much work it is.    You can't curl up with a breast pump, but curling up with your baby to breastfeed in the middle of the night is a very sweet thing. Getting up in the middle of the night to soothe your crying baby AND pump isn't quite as easy as just soothing your baby by breastfeeding.    You might feel very differently about this over the coming months as your body visibly changes with your growing child. I know it's a weird identity thing, but as your pregnancy progresses, your connection with your baby probably will too and you might be more open to the idea of breastfeeding.     My advice is to give yourself time to get used to being pregnant -- 7.5 weeks is so new, and there's so much to digest!). And like others have said, read a lot about breastfeeding. The book, "So That's What They're For" is great.|`|4JFtk1xqaa	Just wait a bit and think things over. Like you said you have plenty of time to decide which way you want to go. The important thing is to be comfortable with your decision. When I was pregnant with my first child I really did not think much about breast feeding. I considered it for a few months, changed my mind, changed it back etc... When my son was born I had decided to breast feed by that point. After his first exam they told me that he was a little tongue tied. That means the little web of skin under his tongue was closer to the front of his tongue than normal. It curled just a bit and the lactation nurse told me that I he may do better on the bottle. I tried the breast first and he had no issues what so ever at all. After that first time, that bonding and a feeling that I cannot explain to you, I decided to nurse my son as long as possible. I also nursed second son as well. It really is a personal decision. You have to be comfortable with it so your baby will feel comfortable as well. Nursing a baby is the most natural thing in the world, but it does take commitment and a willingness to be the bottle for a bit. LOL So my suggestion to you is to read up on all the pros and cons, talk to other mothers you know who did both, nurse , bottle or bottle and breast fed and get their point of views. In the end it will be your choice and no matter which way you go it has to be a decision you are comfortable with. Good luck to you and I hope everything works out!   :)|`|e49178f67a815a64799d8c1237b9affaaa	It's up to you.  Follow your instincts.  My sister had no interest whatsoever and fed with formula.  I felt I wanted to breastfeed (mostly because I'm tortured with IBS and allergies and wanted to make sure this was ruled out for my baby!!)      Have to say having breastfed first and then formula fed a few months later I got so sick of washing bottles I was sorry I swapped to formula!!!  Also I could leave the house knowing that if baby got hungry I didn't have to pack a bottle!|`|SZdT1r8saa	How about you don't decide until the baby comes. Sometimes people want to and their milk just doesn't come in or the baby doesn't cooperate.  So don't worry...   You can always give the baby formula should you decide not to breast feed.  But I can bet you'll change your mind about it.  There is something incredible about being able to nourish your little one.  Good luck  and don't stress!|`|t9S0dqfLaa	My feeling about breastfeeding is this...If you don't want to then don't :)|`|1Yi0Z1JJaa	If you're really uncomfortable it's going to be a horrendous experience for you and your child, and while you change your mind eight months from now it's best to plan.   It's possible to supplement with breast milk, it's what I did with my son. I breast fed for about a month, a little over, but I supplemented with formula after about six weeks due to other issues I won't get in to. So, if you want your little one to get the breast milk without actually having to breast feed you can get a pump and express the milk into the bottles and reheat them (they have to be reheated in boiling water NOT the microwave though, some thing else to bear in mind) and use them that way; and depending on how much milk you make you can either entirely use breast milk from the bottle or you can alternate between breast milk and formula feeding.     I know people tend to get really up in arms about the issue; but to me as long as your baby is well fed and happy and healthy that is the important thing.     Now if you want to find out more about breastfeeding itself to see if you might take to it I suggest getting in touch with a local branch of LaLeche league. They have a lot of information that is really useful and overall try to be informative rather than pushy (at least in my experience) they can give you some other information that may help you out and show you different ways so that you might feel less awkward about it. You can also see if there are female OBs or Gynos in your area (if you don't have one) to get different information and also if you decide not to they can also give you pointers on ways to help things dry up without being painful for you.|`|BXtRVcl0aa	Take a breastfeeding class offered by the hospital.  Talk to women you know who have breastfed.  I believe that this is TRULY a personal choice for each woman, but please do some research first before you give up.  You also may feel really different once you have the baby.  The fact that your mother did it is great, she will be supportive of you and if you are comfortable could help you.  There are LOTS of free hotlines and local support groups you could call.  You will have a lactation consultant in the hospital when you have the baby who can get you started.    Breastfeeding is not awkward once you get the hang of it, and it is a commitment but one that is infinitely rewarding.  You can always STOP breastfeeding your baby if you change your mind, but if you don't even try it from the start you may regret it later.    So please just try to get more comfortable with the subject first, be open to it, and if it doesn't work out, you can say you tried it.  Each and every drop the baby gets, particularly in the first week, is so helpful to him/her, so even if it's just for a short time, you won't regret it.  Finally, I want to say that I was very nervous about it before having both my kids, and had planned on stopping after a couple of months with each child, but after I had my children I felt very strongly about it and nursed each child to one year.  I am a breastfeeding advocate but also acknowledge that every woman should make the choice that is best for her and her baby, so I wish you lots of luck either way and CONGRATS on your pregnancy!|`|AA10207874	Im am breastfeeding my 2 month old son and when he is on my breast I'm not thinking about sex.

YCICrIKyaa	I'm no doctor but I called a hair salon for myself during my first trimester. I was told that the chemicals don't effect the baby at all. The only reason they tell you not to do this type of stuff during pregnancy is because your hair will change and whatever you end up doing to it may come out differently or not take at all. I didn't end up getting what I wanted but I'd call your doctor and ask over the phone if what I was told is correct. If it is, then you can get your highlights.|`|eu6UQElYaa	wait until you hit the second trimester.  Then you can go to the salon to get it done as long as you don't make a constant habit of getting your hair colored.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	first of all, don't believe wut people say, u can have ur hair colored and even apply hair dye on ur scalp while coloring it, the only thing u have to try to avoid is inhaling the fumes.     lots of research has been done on this, and there is still no proof that hair dying during pregnancy causes any harm to the baby. i talked to my doctor and she told me it's an old wives tale bout the hair dye, it's a bunch of b/s.     i've been dying my hair during my pregnancy, and my baby is perfectly fine, so as everyone else i know.     the chemicals don't actually get into ur blood stream as people say. so u're ok w/ going to a salon, it's even safer to do it there than urself bc the place they do it at is more ventilated than ur room would be, so u wouldn't have to inhale so much ammonia.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	vents and good luck i have with botth babies and it was fine the dye does take longer to take , i went once to salon and it took forever!!!!! and they smell worse have a gf do it for ya at home crack the window and order pizza|`|iyL6dyMyaa	Don't color your hair, because it can harm the baby.

Baby comes first.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	According to my Dr. it is perfectly safe to get hair colored or highlighted during pregnancy as there is not link to the chemicals causing issues for your baby. She only suggests that you wait until you are out of your first trimester because the smells in the salon may make you get nauseous. Call your Dr. to see what they recommend.|`|MtC3CWZraa	I'm with diamond. I'm the child of a hair stylist, my hair stylist just had a healthy baby boy last Friday, and I've actually colored my hair more often while pregnant than before (since my hair grows faster) and everything looks fine.     I know 3 women, including my mother, who have been doing hair for 40 years each. They have 8 healthy children and 9 healthy grandchildren between them. I can promise you they were getting perms & color themselves while pregnant in addition to breathing the fumes.  I have a hard time time believing that salon products are that dangerous.|`|OU9xnW86aa	If you MUST get your hair colored you really should wait until you are safely into your second trimester. You don't want to risk absorbing (or inhaling) any harmful chemicals that could disturb your baby's forming. The first trimester is crucial for development!|`|AA11220327	I am pregnant with my 3rd, and I have been a hairstylist for 10 years. I am going to tell you exactly what I always tell my pregnant clients. If it were true and not a myth about salon products not being safe, all stylists would have to quit their job to be pregnant. which is not the case. It is truly a myth, go ahead and colour, just let your stylist know, because some peoples hair type/texture changes when pregnant, and their formula needs to be adjusted.|`|1gxGih7Gaa	Everything I've read says it's okay to have your hair dyed. The chemicals they use in salons are not nearly as harsh as they used to be, so they're safe while your pregnant... At any stage of your pregnancy too. You just want to make sure the room is well ventilated...     It is recommended however that you do a test strip because the hormones your body is producing may cause your hair to react different than normal to the dye.    Good luck!|`|82023d32c67aacffdd25314a33b1ea50aa	You should definetly hold off on highlighting your hair.

rqOIqO7Raa	Sounds like you are! I would wait a couple more days and test again, when you took the first two negatives your hormones may not have been high enough to detect the pregnancy and the last one may have picked it up but only faintly so there is a good chance you are. I had 12 negatives before I got my positive!|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	When I tested positive, the line was really faint too. If you think that you might be pregnant, either wait for a couple of days and test again or go to the doctor. She will be able to tell you for sure. The sore nipples and nausea could be pregnancy symptoms, but I know that when I was trying, I thought that I was pregnant with the same symptoms, but it was really pms.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If you had a positive then you are pregnant. Call your doctor to confirm. False negatives happen all the time due to lack of hormone in the urine used to test. False positives don't happen.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	When you take the tests are you using your first mornings urine? If not, that can alter your results. It may be too since you had a faint line that you are testing too early. I know you waiting until you missed your period but every women produces hCG hormones differently and it just may have been too early for those tests to pick it up. I would take another test first thing in the morning and see if you get better results from that. If not then I would go get a blood test from your Dr. so you can actually see your hCG levels. Good luck!|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	Go to the doctor and get a urine test there and they will be able to tell you for sure, make the appoitment for a week from now though, just to make sure.|`|akB0gV20aa	It may have just been to early for the other two test...if you had one faint positive...you may very well be pregnant.  Wait just a few more days (pregnancy hormones double every other day) and test first thing in the morning.    Are your breasts sore and veiny?  Nipples darker?  You have alot of the other signs...|`|Azp6bBazaa	when a woman tries to become pregnant and wants it bad enough her body will go through the pregnancy changes without actually being pregnant. Your body is also under too much stress and your period may be late or not come at all. this isnt because youre pregnant but because psychologically you think you are.     or 2 you may actually be.   if you havent started in the next week and tests are still showing negative make a doctors appt. they can check your blood to see if youre pregnant.|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	hmm maybe for the other two it was still too early to tell but if u got even a slight positive i'd say u very well could be. u should try taking one of those digital ones in id say 5 days, cuz usually it takes a week of being late to really show up good luck!|`|W0gMQVoDaa	if you had a faint line i would say you are pregnant,have you got a pic of the test ?some people put them on here so we can look at the result,good luck and take care xx|`|OU9xnW86aa	Call your doctor. Make appointment for blood test.|`|2HETgiwgaa	I don't know of any sure symptom of pregnancy BUT even A faint line is still a positive - get a blood test from your doctor if you want reassurance.  But, I'd say CONGRATS!!!|`|2cstdEkIaa	Take a Clear Blue Digital test, they say "pregnant or not pregnant"..test in another 3-5 days|`|vKvNDPbDaa	it's good you had a faint line, congrats! ur hcg level probable wasn't high enough yet to get a stronger result.  take another test in a couple of days.  swollen boobs are another big sign.|`|bc8a8d7595f1051b6a4ba4c3045875ddaa	i definatly knew when i was pregnant, the smell of meat cooking made me feel sick and my early preg test came back negative although i KNEW they were wrong x|`|u43wh6q5aa	it is possible give it a couple more days and do another test good luck baby dust 2 you.xx|`|u3gkczBOaa	from your symtoms (sorry, im not a doctor and don't have much expiriance with this stuff) i would say you are pregnant. i've often heard things like that when someone is discovering that they're pregnant and if one of your tests came out sort of saying that, that's good chances. the store-bought tests don't usually show accurate results for a week or two, i would test another in another week or so if you haven't found out by then. but, then again, im not a doctor : ) so you might want to have a check-up. good luck!! :D|`|ImkdE2toaa	I had similar symptoms bugging me for a while and then tested positive two weeks ago, so you may well be pregnant...I also had a faint line, it was because I tested in the p.m. so the HcG hormone wasn't strong enough yet.
oUcLSDZ6aa	Nope. But it could seriously mess with your body.   Talk to your doctor before you hurt yourself, or someone else.|`|zwctZ812aa	No, that is not true.|`|7C9Ett7Caa	nope|`|KcHSMb0Iaa	NO!!! theres tons of women on birth control who dont find out theyre pregnant until theyre a few months along. all while taking birth conrol the entire time. these babies turn out fine. if your considering self abortion, you should see a doctor and a shrink. and maybe call the cops on yourself|`|4lpJRXYsaa	no that is not true, thats a medicine abortion where you take a certain type of pill given to you by a clinic when you are an abortion, there is a medicine abortion and a surgical/suction abortion, but no birth contorl cannot make you kil the fetus, thats an abortion|`|10mOwk0Taa	Not true.  Even Plan B won't work if its 72 hours past ovulation and the embryo has implanted.  Here's a little story if you're thinking of doing it:    There was a young woman who used the morning after pill too late and her baby was carried to full term.  Her babies lungs and heart were developed inside her body, but the rest of the organs developed in a sac outside of the body and were attached via an umbilical cord type thing.  They had to give the newborn surgery to put all of the organs back inside the baby's body.  The baby was a girl and she had a huge scar from her chest to her pelvis.  As she grew up, the scar shrank and when she was 12 years old they turned the scar into a belly button.  My mom nannied this baby, so I know it was true.  Please do not do this to your baby.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	No, most if not all of birth control pills cannot terminate an already established pregnancy or do any harm to the fetus.|`|VESdMODnaa	birth control CANNOT kill an already implanted embryo.|`|W0gMQVoDaa	i really dont think that is true|`|vZwJyqc6aa	I don't think so. Hopefully you are not planning on trying this.|`|MQ34YW28aa	no it wont kill the fetus. just stop taking it when you find out you are pregnant. i've had 2 cousins that were on birth control and found out they were pregnant when they were 3 months along and was taking BC still, well stopped when they found out. And 1 is due next month and her pregnancy has been great and baby is healthy.|`|627pWyVkaa	No if that could work woman wouldn't need to surgically have the fetus removed from their uterus. Or take an abortion pill (that IS NOT any type of birth control) to make the fetus die, and pass through with blood, and blood clots. NOR does Plan B (2 high dose) of birth control pills Will not kill/abort a pregnancy. The only thing that will is if a woman naturally miscarries, Or has it medically terminated by a doctor, Through the abortion pill or surgical procedure.|`|Ed7qNFdzaa	even plan b can't kill a pregnancy thats already implanted.    i don't believe that 3 birth control pills= the abortion pill!|`|K6rZmVmAaa	Are you asking us how to kill your baby?|`|AA11609300	I have never heard of this.  But, that doesn't mean it's not true...    I have heard of people taking Plan B (which is essentially a high dose of birth control), not knowing they were pregnant, and the baby being just fine, so I would think not.|`|hUTkuOYmaa	Nope. My coworker was on the pill when she got pregnant and didn't know for about two months. She was taking the pill every day. Her baby is fine, in fact she's an adorable little redhead munchkin, I love her! :D|`|pjgMW6qaaa	are you trying to have a cheap abortion?    sick.    that crap you're saying is so ignorant.|`|winmjHAmaa	It will not kill it but can cause mental retardation or growth defects.|`|3OVn4Ceoaa	Who would want to do that?|`|y5sWmbtnaa	If that were true everyone on a 3 month birth control shot who got pregnant would all have had miscarriages.|`|shOAZyNTaa	I haven't heard anything like this.  I have however heard of women having children born with severe birth defects due to taking birth control during pregnancy.  I think that you need to talk with someone about your options and realize that this isn't something that you can "take care of" by yourself.
rqOIqO7Raa	I would say no. You are able to work, it is just uncomfortable for you to so (which it is for a lot of people)|`|WxoZrTPlaa	You're not disabled.  You're pregnant.  As much as some people think they deserve special treatment when they're pregnant, it's just another stage of life.  If you think this is hard, wait til your kids are teenagers!  Baby, let me tell you . . . this is CAKE compared with what's coming!|`|PBI3tCKaaa	I would speak with the head of your HR department, because disability varies.|`|OU9xnW86aa	Um...that's a no!|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	from wat the nurse was telling me at the clinic just yesterday you're eligable for disability up to 6 weeks after you have the baby even and that's just a normal pregnancy.|`|sLERr3aAaa	I'm sure that don't qualify for disability
HBgnkltfaa	My favorite from her list is Ciara Holly.  Michelle Faith is nice, too, but I prefer the first name Ciara to Michelle.  While I like both Ciara and Holly, I'm not sure they flow together very well, as both names are two syllables with the stress on the first syllable.  She might want to consider Ciara Michelle, Ciara Faith, or even something like Ciara Juliet -- I think they have a slightly better rhythm.    The only one from the list I dislike is Catielyn.  For one, Caitlin/Katelyn/Kaitlynn (and its myriad other spellings) is an extremely popular name right now.  I teach at an elementary school, and every grade is bound to have one or two Caitlins.  For another, the Catielyn variation your sister is considering sounds very juvenile.  (I'm guessing it's pronounced like Katie-Lynn.)  While Catielyn might be darling on a first grader, I can't imagine wishing that on an adult as her only formal name option.  If your sister loves the sound of Catielyn, she may want to consider naming her daughter something like Katherine Lynn or Katharina Lynn and then calling her Katie-Lynn as a nickname.    Good luck, and I hope this helps!|`|6lzQJAteaa	Michelle Faith..      My list.  -Alexis Faith   -Morgan Rose  -Skylar Faith |`|QNYDwo9paa	Michelle Faith sounds nice|`|tRbWn6ZXaa	Catielyn Rose    It's Cute!|`|voyH3d1Kaa	They are lovely names    I love Caitlyn Rose|`|GCN3dquAaa	Ciara looks like key-arr-ah. I love the pronounciation keer-uh. Why don't they try Keira?    Michelle Faith isn't bad.    I don't like Catielyn. (caitlyn?) It's too common.|`|rlLf5m0xaa	Caitelyn Rose is pretty, Michelle Faith is also pretty,and I like Ciara Holly (reminds me of Christmas), about Angela Rose, to match up with her brother?Or Angelina Grace?|`|044f19b85001d22c56f93ef315b4e977aa	I love the name Ciara, one of my favourite names.    Michelle Faith is ok. I think possibly you could find a better spelling for Catielyn|`|ZwZOmT4baa	i like Catielyn Rose|`|sNw7xNcNaa	i think she should name her kaitlyn rose|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	I like Catelyn Rose...    but as far as Ciara.. if it's going to be pronounced soo different then just go with Keera, or Kyra..|`|0SIhrYCbaa	If your in the US no one will ever pronounce Ciara any way but See-air-ah.|`|MwjUhHE5aa	Catielyn Rose- I'd spell it differently, it looks a bit weird.  Michelle Faith- Pretty.  Ciara Holly- Nobody will ever pronounce it right. It looks like Kee-ar-uh. Maybe spell it Kira?|`|CiczhPboaa	I like ctlyn Rose and Michele faith  Here are some other names......  Good luck with your new niese!!!    Lilah  Brooke  Krissy  Cooper  Victoria  Maddie  Makayla  Katie  Sophie  Kayla  Lauren  Carmen  Brenda  Ava  Gillian  Casey  Jaime   Miley   Lexie  Alexis  Emma  Olivia  Addison   Nicole    Lindsey   |`|9680447e242a7c540f97466fb79f7a74aa	  Ciara Holly   Try Kiara.. ( For K sound ) Holly is the best for me.. Others Great  but probably they will not pronounce it as you spelled it for sound    Or  Kira .. most will pronounce as  KERA ( WITH E  If tried out and   mispronounced spell it as below. ALL WILL PRONOUNCE PROPERLY    BEAUTIFUL NAME :)    Ciara Holly   and   Keera Holly

AA12302228	hi star, i cant see any point in you telling your mother, why cause upset over spilt milk ,dont be hard on yourself, you havent done any wrong.the world hasnt stopped turning, just put it down to experience and move on....james.f|`|dPULl5hjaa	No, I wouldn't tell her NOW.......POSSIBLY years down the road.|`|AA10186411	I wouldn't have the problem, seeing as I would never abort my baby no matter what the risks.|`|o8xNTVWTaa	i dont think i would be telling her now... i would like wait till i got prgs aAgainand like u said being oolder and really ready and then casually bring it up|`|a3MSSvdcaa	I personally would live by the saying "What she doesn't know can't hurt her."  I know you feel guilty, but just keep in mind that you did the best for you right now.  If your still in school and have a medical condition, it's best to wait until you can have the time off if needed if your pregnancy will be considered high-risk.  Just please, learn from this.  Use protection!  Get on the pill!|`|DNygQdmVaa	tell her years from now.|`|AA11220327	I had to have an abortion for medical reasons as well, about 10 years ago. I never told my parents, because I didnt want them to be devestated that what would have been their 1st grandchild couldnt have survived, and continuing with the pregnancy would have killed me as well.|`|meisgiZBaa	i answered your other question too.     a mother doesn't base her love and pride of her children on whether or not they had an abortion.    to the answerers who have been condemning this girl for having an abortion: 1) have you EVER had to make that kind of choice before, where your child could be under a serious amount of risk if you continued the pregnancy? and 2) isn't it tremendously selfish to bring a child into this world who would not have the opportunities that should be offered to everyone (even things like simple autonomy) so you can feel self righteous in that you still brought a child into the world and upheld YOUR beliefs?     the prolifers in this thread really need to take a step back and think about how selfish *YOU* can be - I don't take issue with most prolifers because they are smart enough to realize that an abortion is warranted in the case where it endangers the mother's life, the baby's life, or in cases of rape and incest. you seem to be radicals, and radicals of anything are the type to spew out whatever they can just so they can get the attention they feel they warrant.    EDIT: it's fine if you have your opinion, it's not fine if you plan on attacking this girl for hers - which is what you were doing.|`|rJTvmV9Caa	Shame on you for doing that. If you weren't ready for a baby you shouldn't have been having sex. Rad -tech should be praying for you for being so self centered. So what if your child is deaf, retarded, or with out limbs? IT WOULD STILL BE YOUR CHILD. Becareful what you say because Karma is a B****! You never know what life has in store for you. That could be the only time you get pregnant, or in your case have a child that has something"wrong" with it.  ***EDIT***  She never said she would die or that she was raped or that it was incest! She simply stated that it was a risk. Maybe she needs to be more blunt about what the risk was. Risk for who her? BooHoo poor her! Quit having sex if that is the reason. I just found out at the age of 30 that I am expecting. If for some reason something is wrong with this baby I would NOT have and abortion. I would love this child just like any other mother would love their child. Everyone is going to have their own opinion and this is mine so R3D don't get mad at other peoples opinions. That is why this girl asked the question is to get opinion of others.
AA12358335	As long as the paint was latex (which is what most people use) and the area was reasonably well-ventilated, you'll be fine. You probably noticed the smell more than you would have otherwise, so that may have bothered you, but other than that, no harm.|`|7C9Ett7Caa	Not if you were only in there for 5 min. The babys fine!! Congrats on the pregnancy!!
Xnr5Y7Coaa	I found out a few days ago and I'm 16 weeks pregnant.  I think it all depends on the position of the baby.|`|iyL6dyMyaa	About 20 weeks or 5 months.|`|9Jnf5jRQaa	probably not until your 20 week ultrasound|`|weO1J2Eaaa	16 weeks but sometimes longer dependsing on the baby and its position congrats|`|eMwIh50Qaa	I'm 16 weeks 2 days and I don't find out until March 23rd. That's 23 weeks! I tried to get in earlier but they are checking the anatomy then and said it's the best time.|`|j9axB0YMaa	18-20. I was 20 when I found out.|`|W8gKP5h8aa	my sister just found out today and she's 18 weeks|`|3OVn4Ceoaa	I was seventeen weeks when I found out I was having a boy. And you'll only be able to tell if your baby cooperates with the person giving the U/S. My son was very cooperative. Drink plenty of water before you go for your ultrasound cause that helps alot with movement of the baby.
VueZ5u9Waa	That's interesting actually. Maybe it's the foods you're eating that's causing some tummy issues. Maybe you should consult your doc before you make the switch permanent. Although there's absolutly nothing wrong with formula at all, it's what I had to feed my son as I couldn't breastfeed.|`|bd22ca32eb55bc06eaa923b22bd0e54aaa	Enfamil AR is thickened with rice starch which thickens in the stomach so it will stay down. That's probably why she's not spitting it up.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	Look at your diet.  Are you eating something that could be upsetting her stomach?  She may be allergic to something you're eating.|`|M5E3mDBJaa	Perhaps you are eating something that is present in the breast milk and upsets her tummy?|`|PYSMK0JBaa	Formula is heavier and that is probably why she isn't spitting it up.     You may have something in your diet that doesn't agree with her and she spits up the breast milk.|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	try pumping your breast milk and feed it to her, if she spits up again then you know its something your eating that is upsetting her tummy ie spicy foods, green veggies, alchohol etc.|`|yXiyhD9zaa	Maybe ur let down reflex is really strong so the baby has to eat really fast which causes her/him to spit up. When she is eating from the bottle it comes out more slowly therefore she doesnt spit up. Still breastmilk is the best for ur baby.  Try another experiment and give her the breastmilk in the bottle and see what happens.   Congrats on breastfeeding!!!|`|vue9NOhYaa	She might be allergic to something in YOUR diet. (Babies are never allergic to breastmilk, but she may be allergic to something you eat that passes into the milk.)    She may be latching not quite right and swallow a lot of air.  Check with an LC to be sure she's latched well.     She may be nursing a lot for comfort (babies don't really take bottles just for comfort) and so take more milk than she can hold, and spit up the excess. This really ISN'T a problem.  If she's not in pain, spitting up in a laundry problem, not a health problem,    She might have reflux.  There are ways of treating reflux in breastfed babies that don't involve bottles or rice starch, so, if you suspect reflux (she's in pain as well as spitting), then speak to your doctor.    This is not a reason to wean, so I hope you are not going to consider doing it.  Spitting up or not, breastmilk remains far healthier for her than any formula.|`|heDtLdz5aa	maybe it could be that the formual is a little heavier than the breast milk...that would be my guess...but ask a doctor..they just might have the answer...  edit: Luv my kids.....i didn't think of that one..great point...
JnLoHaoAaa	No which is exactly while I'll do anything I can to stay away from daycares.|`|264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	Nope, I live in Southern California and our rent is MUCH more than day care.  Day care is very expensive though.  That's why I'm a stay at home mom.|`|mCDopsLEaa	I had my kids young and received day care assistance from DSS, but once I got on my feet and have a good job, I no longer qualify. They give me some assistance until the period runs out. Once it stops in May my 5 and 2 year old will cost 960.00 a month together. My rent is 550.00, so I will be paying more. Sux. I'm trying to figure out a way around it and whatnot.|`|jN3pRKkEaa	When I had my son in 2000 exactly 50% of my take home pay went to daycare and the other 50% went to rent.  I made about $27k per year.  I worked weekends and odd jobs to pay for the utilities and diapers.  I could not get any assistance.  Needless to say we went w/ out a lot of basic things some months.  It really sucked.  I was a single mom, had a child support order but ex did not work....8 years later, he still does not have a job and still no child support but I received my MBA 1.5 yrs ago and have a decent job and got married last year, so things are much better now.    PS - I have an 8 yo now and am pregnant.  Our rent is $1000.  Daycare for both the children during the summer will be about $1800 per month and about $1300 during the school year.|`|EeGgovyCaa	oops misunderstood the question. I don't pay for childcare, their dad stays home with them. Which is still tough because we are on one income. So most of my money goes to the rent and utilities.     We have extra help with family though.|`|9de230e5b3f196d4083653e2703f4b13aa	Nope, Im in MASS and my mortgage is $2800/monthly so, daycare is far cheaper.  But I have 3 children and I worked in daycare.  I understand daycare is expensive but there are alot of expenses that go into taking care of children.  Trust me, noone in the daycare business is getting rich.  Teachers make a few bucks over minimun wage, to feed, diaper, dress, play with, love, heal boo boos, potty train, teach and basically raise other peoples children 5 days a week.  I stay home with my children to save money.|`|sWpxLiN5aa	I don't. I pay $92.00 a week to a wonderful church daycare that treats my son like their own. I could not ask for a better daycare, and my son loves it.

Pai, n?o me d tudo que pe?o. s vezes pe?o somente para obter, para compensar, para chamar a aten??o.   02. N?o me d ordens. Se ao invs de ordens me pedisse as coisas com firmeza e carinho eu as faria rapidamente e com muito mais alegria.   03. N?o me fa?as promessas. Se me prometer um prmio, d-me, mas tambm d-me o castigo, se prometido e caso seja justo.   04. N?o me corrijas as faltas diante dos outros, ensina-me a ser melhor quando estivermos sozinhos e com o seu exemplo.   05. N?o me compare com ningum, principalmente com meu irm?o ou irm?. Se me fizer sentir pior que os outros eu sofrerei muito mais.   06. N?o grite comigo. Respeito-o mais quando voc fala comigo e n?o me fa?a gritar tambm.   07. Deixe-me andar com meus prprios ps, ter minhas prprias emo??es. Se voc fizer tudo por mim, eu jamais terei a alegria de poder aprender.   08. Quando voc estiver enganado em alguma coisa, admita-o, pois crescer muito mais a minha estima por voc, e isso me ensinar a reconhecer os meus prprios erros.   09. Trata-me com a mesma amabilidade e cordialidade com que trata seus amigos, assim aprenderei com voc o respeito e amizade.   10. Quando eu estiver atravessando momentos difceis, ajuda-me. Tente me compreender. Demonstre o seu amor por mim. Gosto de sentir que sou amado. Preciso de seguran?a para crescer. Atenda meus pedidos, pois assim serei capaz de ser feliz.

Antes da ejacula??o (de gozar) sai algumas gotas de esperma, e uma simples gota j pode ser suficiente para engravidar. Alm disse at se ele nem penetrar e somente gozar na parte de fora corre risco tambm (esse  o caso clssico na medicina das "virgens grvidas").    Mas o pior n?o  ficar grvida! O pior de tudo isso  n?o usar camisinha. Camisinha alm de prevenir a gravidez ainda previne doen?as como sfilis, gonorria, herpes genital entre outras, mas a principal  a AIDS! Lembre-se que AIDS n?o tem cura e  mortal! Alm disso  uma morte lenta e dolorosa, s quem trabalha na rea da infectologia sabe o estado das pessoas em estgio terminal. Por isso  obrigatrio o uso da camisinha. Sei que a pergunta n?o era essa mas  obriga??o de todos dar esse alerta.|`|NU1KT0Fwaa	Pois , parece que estas meninas est?o se informando muito pouco.

8T1JXMIAaa	Querida ai voce tem como se calcula o periodo fertil.  Primeiro precisa-se saber quantos dias tem o ciclo menstrual, ou seja, o nmero de dias entre o primeiro dia menstrual de uma menstrua??o e o primeiro dia da seguinte, para a maioria das mulheres  de 28 dias. Geralmente a ovula??o ocorre cerca de 14 dias antes da menstrua??o seguinte, ou seja, para ciclo de 28 dias, ovula-se no 14o. dia, para ciclos de 30, ao redor do 16o.dia, e assim por diante. O perodo mais frtil come?a cerca de dois dias antes e vai at cerca de dois dias depois da data da provvel ovula??o. Se o ciclo  bem regular, est fcil: basta subtrair 14 da dura??o e ter rela??es mais freqentes entre dois dias antes at dois dias depois do obtido por esta conta. Ex. ciclo de 28; 28-14=14; ter rela??es entre 12o. e 16o. dias do ciclo. Ciclo de 31 dias; 31-14=17; ter rela??es entre 15o. e 19.o dias de cada ciclo. Mas, infelizmente, n?o d para saber rotineiramente a data exata da ovula??o, assim, para ciclos menos regulares, pode-se usar a seguinte regra prtica: observe o ciclo nos ltimos 6 a 12 meses. Anote a dura??o do ciclo mais curto e a dura??o do mais longo. Fa?a as seguintes contas: Subtraia 17 do mais curto (vamos chamar o resultado de A), subtraia 12 do mais longo (vamos chamar o resultado de B). O seu perodo mais frtil ser entre os dias A e B do ciclo (sempre conte a partir do dia em que come?a a menstrua??o). Exemplo: vamos supor que o ciclo mais curto observado foi de 27 dias e o mais longo foi de 31 dias. 27-17=10, 31-12=19. Perodo frtil inicia-se no 10o. dia do ciclo e vai at o 19o. dia do ciclo. Que Deus lhe ajude e ilumine|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	Se precisar de ajuda  s falar comigo.|`|PnduWF3waa	Para calcular seu perodo frtil conte 14 dias da data do incio de seu ltimo ciclo menstrual, e a partir da conclua que voc estar ovulando entre dois dias antes e dois dias depois desta data.

bb8fd004d586212774b7c8f0810de347aa	Amiga, voc ir ovular quando seus horm?nios assim o determinarem e isso pode levar um tempinho. Veja bem, voc estava grvida e portanto estava produzindo os horm?nios da gravidez. At que seu organismo tome conscincia que n?o est mais grvido e comece a produzir os horm?nios sexuais e esses horm?nios cheguem a uma concentra??o suficiente para que a fa?a ovular, demanda um certo tempo. De qualquer forma, mesmo ovulando, voc deve esperar no mnimo 6 meses para tentar uma nova gravidez e o ideal  que durante esse tempo consulte seu mdico para que pesquisem juntos as causas do aborto e possam trat-la. Essa  a forma mais eficiente de evitar que a mesma coisa ocorra na prxima gravidez. Boa sorte.|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	S depois de um ms.

Olha tambm passei por uma curetagem e pelo que meu GO me explicou, a mulher j pode ovular logo no 1o ms, mas isto depende de mulher para mulher. Acontece que quando passamos por uma curetagem, o nosso corpo, principalmente o utero, precisa de um tempinho para se reorganizar e por isso  at indicado esperar uns 3 meses, para tentar uma nova gravidez. A casos que a mestrua?ao pode fica desregulada por uns 3 meses e segundo ele isto  normal, mas isto n?o quer dizer que a mulher n?o esteja ovulando. Voc pode observar se voc est tendo aquele muco , tipo clara de ovo, que  caracteristica da ovula??o, para saber se j esta ovulando ou n?o. Se passar uns 3 meses e voc n?o conseguir observar este muco, procure se GO para saber se voc esta ovulando ou n?o.  Espero ter te ajudado!  Beijinhos

Apesar do Conselho Federal de Medicina acabar de aceitar o uso do anticoncepcional de emergncia, conhecido como "plula do dia seguinte", e publicar resolu??o que regulamenta sua aplica??o,  importante estar informada sobre suas atua??es e efeitos. Afinal de contas, este tipo de plula chega a conter uma dose de horm?nio de 10 a 20 vezes maior que a plula anticoncepcional comum e vem sendo utilizada, principalmente por adolescentes, como o nico mtodo anticoncepcional ou como um mtodo adicional.   Abusar destes "comprimidinhos" pode causar danos graves  sade, como cancer de mama e de tero, problemas em uma futura gravidez, alm de trombose e embolia pulmonar. Alm disso, o contraceptivo de emergncia n?o protege ningum das doen?as sexualmente transmissveis. Apesar de aps dois ou trs dias, a droga ser eliminada do organismo, mais do que uma dose em apenas um ms j  considerado abuso. A recorrncia a ela deve acontecer apenas em casos de emergncia.   Pode ser tomada at 72 horas depois da rela??o.   S?o dois comprimidos - um a ser tomado de preferncia nas primeiras 24 horas, quando sua eficcia  maior, seguido de outra dose aps 12 horas.   A plula do dia seguinte pode ser adquirida em qualquer farmcia sem prescri??o mdica, mas  importante informar ao seu mdico sobre esta alternativa. Os efeitos colaterais mais comuns s?o altera??o no ciclo menstrual, possveis dores de cabe?a, sensibilidade nos seios, nuseas e v?mitos. Apenas quem possui alguma doen?a hematolgica (do sangue), vascular, hipertens?o ou obesidade mrbida n?o pode usar o medicamento.

dA9Tcp8Qaa	I was home all the time without my parents taking care of my step sisters. It made me responsible and learn about priorities.     The youngest sister had some mental issues, and she blamed everyone but herself about her problems. She became completely out of control and by 14 was into drugs, drinking, smoking and sleeping around. She is now living with her grandmother, 16, failed 2 years over and over. Typical low life.    So, overall I think it depends on the kid, the lifestyle, age...everything.     But I can't stand it when kids blame all their problems on their parents. Kids can make good choices for themselves. |`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	I was a latch-key kid and it depends on how the parents have raised the child and the values the family has. I've heard of kids who got into lots of trouble at home alone, but they can also drink and do drugs while a parent is at home. The boundaries in my home were well founded and understood by everyone, screw up and you suffer the consequences, like being babysat by your least favorite relative. |`|x8Q6cLbwaa	it all depends on what kind of upbringing they have. if you're a good parent who's involved in you child's life they should be fine.|`|wZAeBisbaa	Some do, some don't.  But if the parent is gone a lot, they are certainly giving their kids the opportunity to get into trouble. If their friends are into drinking and drugs, it could be a disastrous combination.  A lot of kids do just fine when home alone, though.  It just depends on the child.  And the parent can do some things to reduce the risk, such as talking to their child, knowing who their friends are, setting ground rules, and checking on them often.|`|puEjSoDfaa	My mom hasn't really been at home since I was about 8. She works all the time. I dont get into bad stuff when she isn't at home but I really resent her now even though I know she was trying her best to provide for me being a single parent, I resent her for not ever being there for me.,|`|CXHY5Inxaa	yep, drugs, sex, alcohol, pregnancy|`|9uu5rB7vaa	The child partiess hard core =) |`|ipaAiX8xaa	I was home alone since the age of about 7.

I had to learn to fend for myself and I got depressed a lot. I even cut myself a few times.     I would say it's good if the child has to learn some responsibility but the parents should be there enough to teach them and learn what is going on in their children's lives. |`|3lvHcNG8aa	How old?|`|Ae0MwCPxaa	Well my moms never home,im 14, and ive never drank,smoked,or gone to parties...O_o|`|Kj56AiKpaa	In the case that the parents are always absent, i think that their kids could be partying and chilling with theirs friends, so it means that they could be drinking, having sex or using any kind of drug...... |`|JLBuXqStaa	i talk to my friends, hang out on the computer, watch movies    nothing bad, im a good girl :]|`|0xQYwNpcaa	while the cat is away, the mice will play :P hehe    my mom&dad are hardly ever home. they work&i'm 17 so they most likely trust me to stay out of trouble now a days, but back about a yr or 2 ago. i was always gettin into stuff. while they were gone, i'd invite friends over&drink.. or i'd invite my boyfriend over&we'd fool around. now that i've grown up a lil&matured i'm now a lil more responsible.     not everyone does drugs, has wild parties, or drinks while there parents are gone.some are mature enough to respect the house rules&their parents rules.

Sure, they're cool for having a touchscreen, but I doubt you need any of the smartphone functionality it offers.    Most kids I know need to send text messages or actually talk, set up their ringtones, and maybe take pictures. Most cheaper phones offer that functionality.|`|11etxEVvaa	uhhh if you can pay for it sure.  if you have to mooch off your parents for it- then no|`|5YspJ7RZaa	Although I do not believe a 13 year old even needs a phone, they certainly do not need an expensive phone.

8t8NjjnVaa	Cooking with alcohol is absolutely fine.  Most of the alcohol gets burned off by the cooking process, so the amount of alcohol in a meal with wine sauce is very very low.    On your anniversary (congrats, BTW), you certainly can have a glass of wine.  One glass will not hurt your baby.  I would advise against drinking anymore than one glass, unless you plan to "pump and dump".|`|cYRZpGkqaa	If the wine in the sauce is cooked, it's fine because all of the alcohol is cooked out. They say it's safe to have one drink, I personally wouldn't want to take the risk though. They also have milk screens that you can buy to see if the alcohol content is low enough for safe nursing.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	Yes, but there are guidelines   http://www.cfpc.ca/cfp/2002/jan/vol48-ja...|`|hieQHR0daa	There is no reason why you shouldn't have the occasional glass of wine or have food in wine based sauces. As long as you don't overdo it there shouldn't be any problem. If you are breast feeding then the first feed after alcohol intake may result in baby either sleeping more or sleeping less. As with all things when breast feeding some things do affect baby and some don't.  Have a very happy anniversary.|`|SM4xIodaaa	I breastfeed and do not drink at all but that is MY choice. I just do not feel comfortable with it BUT my dr says you can have a glass of wine. The lactation cunsultant told me that if you drink wait 1.5 hours before your nurse.   It is annoying because everybody you talk to (even professionals) all have different answers.  But if you just want one glass I think you are totally fine!|`|hTQg5tgPaa	It should be ok.  I would nurse first before I have any alcohol.  A glass(not huge) should be ok... everything in moderation.  But I would have only 1, nothing more.  If the wine sauces are cooked, then all the alcohol should be out of them.  I heard that if wine is cooked that the alcohol evaporates or something like that... so I wouldn't worry about the sauces, as long as they are cooked. Shows that  you are being responsible by asking and not just doing it!|`|yqAwWO4uaa	My wife does on occasion.  She has these strips her doctor told her about.  She got them at the local drug store, they test the milk for alcohol content.  If they turn a certain color then the milk has too high of an alcohol content.  She never drinks enough to change them, except once on our anniversary last year.|`|oDyNiJi7aa	When you cook with wine the alcohol is cooked out of the food.  About having wine yes you may have a drink.   ~I hope that this helped you.
ry3yUnoaaa	At 6months which is considered early. The key is to allow him to be on the floor as much as possible. Don't hold him all day or let him sit in a carrier like a lot of people do.

nBlSS6HUaa	Honestly...your better off trying Craigslist. The salvation army normally sells them. Or atleast here they do. We have a Salvation Army store. And anything brand name..they price way high. Which really means the 'needy people' aren't getting a bargain.

You can also donate to a local shelter, many of the people utilizing their services leave bad situations with nothing more than the clothes on their back.  Your local freecycle group or Crags List would also be places you could give them away.|`|VnRECJJxaa	salvation army is always good    also you could try and contact some of the women's shelter's in boston i'm sure some of those ladies need clothes

5805bf3a9bb2e4808ef2d73593aaab11aa	My husband and I got pregnant using the Billings Ovulation Method. It helps you to read the natural signs of your body whether you have a regular cycle or not. I would recommend looking into it. www.woomb.org    Best of luck to you two!|`|3XFZHhWgaa	Well in order to fget pregnant, you need eggs and eggs are dropped when you get your period, but women have eggs no matter what. Maybe try going on a diet, it might help make your period come and more regular then before to where you would know when you are ovulating.    Good luck and I hope all goes well!
EtwDYTC2aa	She is probably just experiencing PMS, if she's always like this then chances are she's just late.  You don't say how old you are but some girls take a few years to become exactly regular...  sometimes its a little early, sometimes a little late.  If she continues to worry, take an over the counter test to ease her mind.  While it IS possible to get pregnant the way you describe, she probably isn't and is just worried which can also cause it to be late.    To the guy above about sex ed:  No...  sadly a lot of schools don't teach it anymore because parents decided if you teach kids about sex they will have it.  Whatever.  Bad move...  but schools don't want a lawsuit...|`|mIm3PYqLaa	Most likely not. The chances of that happening are exponentially high. It sounds like she's PMSing right now, so give it another couple of days and I'm sure she'll get her period.|`|fVpRVofLaa	Yup just over paranoid.|`|A6rZIwAbaa	i think its very common that girls have delay in there periods so its nothing too worry just relax buddy..having baby its not that easy proper penetration is necessary and nice amount of sperms should be there but in your case no penetration was done so forget just chill..|`|RUfBeZNiaa	Sounds like you may just be paranoid. But if she is late..go buy a pregnancy test.|`|mOJhj3ssaa	i can understand why your worried, but the penis has to be in the vagina, if there was never any penetration, then there is nothing to worry about. & besides sometimes your just late for no reason.|`|jhNUuz0maa	Odds are, she is not pregnant by you. If what you say is true, about any bodily fluids and you and your underwear, then the odds are very slim she could be pregnant with your baby. However, she could be seeing someone else and it be that guys child.     If you are that worried, go buy a pregnancy test and have her take it.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	don't public schools teach sex-ed anymore???? Man.... Look... ALWAYS a possibility if you're talking bodily fluids.. but i highly doubt it. go get a dollar pregnancy test and a book on sex.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	It's a very very very slim chance that's she's pregnant. Nothing that a good ole pregnany test won't calm the nerves for
EvRIwz4Laa	1. yes as long as there is no cramping or sharp pain. Also implantation bleeding should not last longer than a few days   2. You will not ovulate while you are pregnant. It could be bloating or constipation both of which are common in pregnancy especially in the first trimester. If you are having sever cramping or sharp pains OR if you see red blood at all or any type of blood for more than a day or so you need to see your Dr. Also have you been in to you first OB appointment. Now is the time to go   3. If you were doing sit ups before you should be fine. There will come a point when you will not physically be able to do it any more but as long as your heart rate stays low it is safe to do moderate exercise. This is also a question to ask your OB because everyone is different. Like for me I am a marathon runner and was for years before I got pregnant with my twins. I ran a marathon at 6 months and I felt great. However if you are not a marathon runner you should not start while pregnant   4. If possible it is best to have no coffee but a cup a day should not be horrible. Again this is something that will depend on your particular circumstances. If you are deemed a high risk pregnancy it may be best for you to have no caffeine. But under normal circumstance one cup should be fine...Oh and if you are drinking decaf you can have as many as you want just be prepared for potential heart burn   5. You should just take prenatal vitamins. Most prenatal have everything you and your baby will need for the next 8ish months.  beyond that you should eat smaller meals more times a day and increase your caloric intake by no more than 500 calories a day unless you have been instructed to gain weight. A common mistake women make is thinking that because they are eating for two that can eat what ever they want. and if that is you plan more power to you. But the more unnecessary weight you gain the longer it will take you to lose it. Also by eating a ton of junk foods you will be at a higher risk for gestational diabetes and putting your baby at risk for health problems in the future. This does not mean you cannot eat icecream or chips, but keep it in moderation.    6. NO NO NO ibuprofen is very bad and can cause bleeding the only thing you can take for headaches and what not is Tylenol in moderation! for other things like colds and what not there are a few other meds you can take but for the most part the golden medication rule is unless the benefits of taking the medication significantly outweigh the risks to you and your baby then the meds should be avoided. An example of this is certian anti-depressants, such as Zoloft. In some cases there are greater risks associated with quickly pulling a pregnant woman off Zoloft than the potential risk the drug would have on the fetus (which studies have found to be minimal at most)   7. sure. itching is totally normal and if you feel pinching then I am sure that is nothing to worry about. I did not experience that but every woman is different as is every pregnancy   8. I did not sweat more since I was pregnant during the winter but I think I was hotter then I normally am during that time of year. Your hormones are raging and you will be carrying around extra weight.|`|s6stLtvLaa	1).  It is common to bleed off and on during your first and beginning of your second trimester.  I had some heavy bleeding for an hour in the beginning of my second trimester and freaked.  7 hours later my baby was just fine!     2.)  No you don't ovulate.  You can experience some tenderness on one side or another (usually the side you are most tender is the side the egg came from).  The cramping combined with the bleeding could very well be a miscarriage happening.  Look to see if you pass tissue (or better yet, beat it to the punch and call a doctor).      3).  I can't see how it would hurt right now.....but later on I would probably try and avoid it.      4).  each doctor will tell you something different.  Some say up to 200 mlg of caffeine a day (coffee, soda, chocolate, etc).  Others say up to 300 is ok.  Some believe it causes miscarriages in early pregnancy and behavioral problems (ADD, ADHD, etc) during later pregnancy.  My dr. gave me the ok to drink a little Coffee in the morning because I was on medication and I couldn't take Tylenol with it this medication and caffeine helped with my head aches (caused by the medication).     5).  I was told to just eat normal.  When they say you are "eating for two" they don't mean to double on everything you eat.  Eat healthy but more of it.  Really, just eat until you are full.  I guess it is common for women to have problems with the smell and taste of meat during the morning sickness phase (I know I did, it all made me so sick and turkey burgers were out of the question the entire pregnancy).  If that happens to you then amp up on your dairy proteins (milk, eggs, cheese, beans, etc.).      6).  Tylenol is fine, DO NOT USE IBUPROFEN!  no advil either.  Stick with tylenol.      7).  Your boobs can itch (your skin gets dry)  your boobs will also hurt like H*** too.      8).  You probably will.  I was pregnant during the summer and heading into the cooler parts of the year and I was soooo hot! We had our apartment at 55 and a fan going and I was STILL hot!    Good luck!  And if you ever have any concerns do not hesitate to call your doctor! they will always be more than happy to answer any of your questions!|`|PN7ELn3aaa	1.) Normal. Absolutely okay :)   2.) No, you cannot ovulate when you are pregnant. It is probably just your tendons/uterus stretching and preparing.  3.) You can do them in the first trimester but shouldn't later on. It will be too difficult and uncomfortable to do them later anyway.  4.) 200mg a day is okay. 1-2 cups (not Venti from Starbucks, like a coffee mug)  5.) 300 extra calories a day is all you need if you were "normal weight" before.  6.) No. Not at all. Do not take any meds until you get a list from your doctor. (Ibuprofen is a no-no, but there are too many for me to list here)  7.) Yes, they are growing and your skin is stretching :)  8.) I didn't, I haven't heard this, but I suppose it could be because of extra hormones.     Good luck! The book "what to expect when your expecting" is great :)|`|GrpYjwH8aa	You need the book "What to Expect When You're Expecting". There is a new version of it, it's a great book. But I will still answer some questions.  1. Your spotting doesn't sound like anything is wrong, every woman is different as is every cycle. I didn't have any spotting with this pregnancy, but I did with my first.    2.It is normal to have a crampy feeling for a while when you are first pregnant. If it gets to be really painful then you should tell the doctor, or if you have bleeding. You do not ovulate when you are pregnant.    3. You can do sit-ups in early pregnancy, but you won't be able to later. Also, as you get bigger you are not supposed to lay flat on your back. Continue to exercise safetly as this helps with soooo many things in pregnancy.    4. If you are worried about caffeine then you can slowly ween yourself off of it, or you can have one cup of coffee a day. Or switch to a good swiss water decaf instead.     5. I believe you only need about 300 extra calories a day. It's best to eat small meals and snacks throughout the day keep up your energy and blood sugar.    6. The only "safe" medication for pain during pregnancy is acetaminophen (tylenol). Try other things like a warm bath, heating pad, exercise, etc.    7. Your boobs are changing a lot, they could itch because they are swelling. Mine itch.    8. Some women do sweat more.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	1) Some women never even get implantation bleeding, i never did. The dates they five you are guidelines, not set in stone.    2) You'll feel period-like cramps most of your pregnancy. It's your uterus stretching.    3) Not sure about the sit ups, ask your doc    4) Limit your caffeine intake to  under 300mg a day, be sure you know how much is in everything you drink.    5) They say 300 extra calories a day    6) Take tylenol (acetomophine), it's really the only safe pain killer in pregnancy. Ibuprofen/naproxen sodium/aspirin, etc aren't proven safe.    7) Everything will itch. And hurt. You're growing at stretching all over, and it's pretty uncomfortable.    8) You can, your body temp tends to be higher by a degree or two.    Congrats and good luck!!|`|SRzswqTeaa	1)  Implantation bleeding (IF it happens at all, it's not 'usual') can happen at any time.  It takes several hours/days for the sperm to reach the egg (everyone is different) and then it take several days for the fertilized egg to travel to the uterus and implant - and each time it can take a different amount of time.  Day one is your period, day 14 (on a 28 day cycle) is the day you might ovulate.  Add about 14 more days to see any implantation bleeding - IF you see it at all.   It's okay, and normal, but not something that happens to everyone. My guess, is you probably have not experienced any implantation bleeding, it might even be a bit of bleeding from ovulation.   Or your period being weird.. but time will tell.    2)Cramping can happen during ovulation, before or during your period, or even if you are pregnant.  No, you do NOT ovulate while you are pregnant.    3)not harmful to do sit ups while pregnant, especially if you have been doing them before pregnancy, and they do not cause any cramping..     4)You really should cut out caffeine if you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant.  If you must drink a cup of coffee, limit it to once or twice a week, and don't drink as much as you usually do.       5)200-300 extra Kcals a day, and some say it isn't necessary to increase at all in the first trimester    6)ibuprofen should be avoided in pregnancy..stick to acetaminophen and use it sparingly.      7)usual.. probably not.. but nothing to be concerned with I don't think    8) You can sweat more, but I doubt you would feel any symptoms right now, even if the baby did start to implant, your body has a few more days to even start to notice anything.  If you are prone to sweating, you *might* notice it.  Many won't notice it at all , or at least until they are in their 2nd and 3rd trimesters.  I've never sweat more, but that is me, and everyone is different.  Good luck|`|AA11220327	not everyone has bleeding durring implantation at all, I am pregnant with  3 and have never had it. Cramps are common durring pregnancy with many different reason, I would ask about them specifically at your next appointment just to ease your mind. I have never heard about sit ups being harmful in early pregnancy, but the more pregnant you get, they do become very difficult and uncomfortable. I have always been told that a minimum of 300 extra cals a day in early pregnancy is a good start, but dont force yourself not to eat if you are hungry. No more than 3 servings of coffee/caffeine per day. NO IBUPROFEN, acetominephen is the approved pain reliever durring pregnancy. B reast discomfort is VERY common, and can last the whole pregnancy untill the milk has come in, and even then, there can be discomfort. I have never sweat more, but pregancy is different for every one. Hope this helps|`|jk6ayFUmaa	this is my first time as well i am not sure about the implantation bleeding but i am sure that is fine.    i dont think your ovulating but i got weird cramping to i think it was gas.      not sure about sit ups       i was told to not drink coffee and to limit to like 1 can of soda a day at max      your only supposed to take tylenol      my boobs itch alot!!!!! and i sweat alot too.|`|AA10280194	1) I'm reading some pregnancy stuff.. and it says you get implantation bleeding in your third week, although I read it can be 14 days. I got mine at 17 days. Is this okay? (It was pink and brown spotting but I had a little bright red bleeding.    ** Yes, it's OK.    2) I know I'm pregnnat, but I'm cramping, may be ovulation? It has occured on both sides today. This is confusing me, because I didn't think you ovulated when you were already pregnant?    ** My "pregnancy pains" started around the time my PMS symptoms would normally start and I thought that's what it was.  They included light cramping, sore breasts and light nausea.  I'm now 9.4 weeks along and I still have the same symptoms.  They are normal and I love them because that is the only thing I have right now that reminds me there is a little one growing inside.    3) Is it harmful to do sit ups while pregnant?    **  I don't know.  You should ask your doctor.    4) How much coffee is too much for a baby?    ** My point of view in ANY coffee, tea or other caffeinated beverage, candy or goodie is too much.    5) How many extra kcals are you meant to eat while pregnant?    ** I think it's 300 - 500.    6) When I get all my cramps, is it okay to just take paracetemol/iburofen?    **  NO!!!!!  ONLY TAKE REGULAR STRENGTH TYLENOL!!    7) Is it usual for your boobs to itch.. but also feel like they're being pinched at occasionally?    **  Yep!!  It's your growing pains.    8) Do you sweat more?    **  You metabolism is increasing so, yes.    HOPE THIS HELPS!!  CONGRATULATIONS :-)|`|9qkCf6Mlaa	1 as long as your not still bleeding your ok.  Any bleeding at all should be reported to your doctor.  The day I found out I was pregnant I started gushing blood for 2 days, but baby is healthy as can be now. I'm 15 weeks today.    2 your uterus is growing and expanding.  Some cramping is normal.    3 if your only a few weeks and not showing i dont think situps can hurt but you may want to find a different form of exercising.    5 you only need an extra 300 cals for your baby.  Being so early on you don't need to change any eating habits except maybe to be healthier.    4  they say 2 cups of reg coffee is ok.  but you don't want to get a tall espresso from starbucks.    6  The only think you can take while pregnant is Tylenol.  No ibuprofen    7  Your breast will hurt for what seams like forever.  NO one was allowed to touch them, not even myself.  They were so sore and tender it hurt to just look at them.  Now at about 14 weeks it let up a little but still the man has to keep his hands off!  They'll itch because you're body gets dry.  You need more water and lotion all the time. Start early because it will be an everyday thing once your full symptoms kick in.    8  I don't sweat more, I'm usually cold all the time.
Wz9tSKTaaa	Hmm.     To be a negative type when you're the child of 2 positive types isn't particularly unusual, though it's not the most common result. It requires both parents to be carrying a hidden negative allele, and for each of those hidden alleles to be passed on to the child.    By the normal rules of inheritance an A type cannot be the child of 2 O types. A alleles aren't usually recessive/hidden, so A type children need at least 1 parent who is A or AB type. In fact, being O type usually entails having nothing but O alleles, so 2 O parents can only have O type children. You were probably aware of this.    Bombay phenotype could explain the situation - but I'm sceptical. It's caused by a pair of recessive alleles, (on a different locus in the genome) so, like being O type, having the phenotype requires 1 of these alleles from each parent. This pair of alleles fails to create the H antigen on blood cells, an antigen which is common to all normal A, B, AB and even O types, and which, crucually, A and B antigens can't develop without. Anti-A and Anti-B antibodies develop as a result. Since ABO blood typing is based on the presence or absence of A and B-based antigens and antibodies, they are typed as O.    So Bombay phenotype masks A and B alleles allowing someone to be genetically A, B or AB, yet without the antigens to match. If either of your parents had the condition they could have an A allele and have passed it on you. So that makes sense.    However, Bombay phenotype is found in 4 people per million. I've answered several questions in which I've mentioned it as a possible explanation, and seen it mentioned in many other answers, but I do wonder whether it's been the correct explanation in any of them. Certainly I've never seen anyone on here say that they've been confirmed as having Bombay phenotype.    I'm not sure from what you say how much in-breeding (for want of a better word) has gone on in your family. It increases the chances of otherwise rare alleles being paired together (many of us carry recessive alleles which are rare in the population, but there's a 50% chance one's sibling has it, so if a man has a child with his sister...). If such a pairing is to be maintained, that requires the in-breeding to be maintained. Depending on what happened in your family the chance of you having Bombay phenotype might increase slightly, but it's still not likely.    Also, Bombay blood types have anti-H antibodies in them, meaning that all other blood types cause a very negative reaction if transfused into them. If, in their poor health, your parents have received any transfusions which include red blood cells, that would rule them out immediately anyway.    The obvious explanation of course is that one or both of your parents aren't your biological parents. You need something more definite than blood types if you want to check that properly - a DNA test.    Whilst you said that you know your parents' blood types, is it possible they've been mistyped? It's unusual, (more unusual than infidelity, unfortunately) but not unheard of for some sub-types of A to be mis-typed as O. That might provide an explanation.|`|hJoB7VR1aa	My answer is that you are either a medical mystery or someone is lying to you. Medically speaking 2 O's will always have O children. The Rh factor is completely normal, most of the time 2 + make a -. My daughter has A- blood, I have O- and her father had A+. My mom has O+ and my dad has O-. The - is a recessive gene that is passed.|`|3xMQW0A6aa	you have your genome, which is the traits you display (ie: your blood type for instance) and then you have your phenome, which is still part of your genes, but are the recessive part which are not shown.  it is possible that one or both of your parents have A negative blood traits recessively, even though they show the O positive.  confusing, i know but you are full of genes that you dont even know because you dont show them (how do you think some red hair babies are born to parents with brown hair, or that some blueeyed children have parents with green eyes.  it happens)|`|e8HCEZDpaa	As far as my studies go, it isn't possible. It's possible for an A and an AB parent to have an O child due to the Bombay phenotype, but not possible for two O parents to have an A child. With O blood their is an absence of A or B alleles, and therefore they don't just magically appear. I hate to say it, but your "father" probably isn't your father if both of your parents are O as you say.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	Uh oh i think someone is lying. For your parents to both be O they would mean they carry only the O trait. Which would mean you would have to be O also. I would talk to mom about it.
WPI0Z47saa	I actually would get sick nightly for awhile between 9-9:30pm for awhile. I could almost count on it no matter what I did. You aren't crazy, this does happen.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Sort of.  I'm more or less over the morning sickness now at 10 weeks, but it was really bad for a few weeks there.  And mine lasted all day long.  Nothing too horrible, just a vague nauseous feeling that was very unpleasant.  But it would start about an hour after I woke up.  Every day.  I found that eating a few crackers before I took my shower and then eating a larger, bland, breakfast (milk and two pieces of toast with peanut butter during the worst of it, then I got to add my regular bowl of oatmeal back into the routine as it got better) and never going more than an hour or two without eating a little bit of something really helped keep it at bay.  Eating candied ginger root very slowly (because if you eat it too fast it kind of burns your tongue) also helped me a LOT, especially if I had missed an opportunity to snack and was feeling queasy.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I never got sick but I always felt queezy at the same time everyday.  Morning was no apetite, afternoon somewhat, and dinner was the sick feeling.  My doctor said an empty stomach only makes it worse...which makes since that it got worse thru the day (I didn't want to eat at all because I anticipated).  I started to force spoonfuls of this and that and it helped.  I'm 16 weeks and finally over the morning sickness but here comes the heartburn :-(  Oh yea...I made a habit of drinking one Ensure a day...I totally despise milk but it seemed to ease my stomach and gave me vitamins so it wa a win win.|`|wFe7L1XJaa	Typically your morning sickness doesnt hit until about 6 weeks so your right on time and yes it is like clock work i wake up at the same time every morning to throw up about 5:30 am and then in the afternoon im constantly nauseated but when im not i try too eat alot... Good Luck and i hope you feel better oh and you can eat saltine crackers and ginger ale is my best friend
DRb4Qlypaa	Im not really sure if I understood your question but if there are 2 lines then you are pregnant, no matter how light the second one may be.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Congratulations!!    TX Mom|`|T1hZG4O3aa	As long as their are two lines its a positive. I had a very faint positive test in December, now I am 11 weeks pregnant. Good luck and Congrats.|`|dGBrlJvgaa	2 lines, light or not, means you are pregnant. Congrats!|`|jk6ayFUmaa	yup. i took 2 first response tests and one line was light and i am now 13 weeks pregnant.  congrats|`|3K7ffKn2aa	yep take another one in the morning when you first wake up, trust it'll be darker.|`|AA10153923	Your Pregnant. If it showed just a little, no matter how light, that states Your pregnant.CONGRATS!|`|Z4IwPsrHaa	Yep girl you are prego congrats! Light just means you dont Have ALOT of pregnancy hormones, just enough for it to detect some. So yes congrats girl. The two I took were REALLY light but I am 20 weeks prego now. And if anyne says go take a digital test to prove it, I wouldnt advise you do that. Because the 4 digital test I took all said negative because I didnt have enough pregnancy hormones for it to say YES. So just go to the docs and they can make 100% sure ok. Congrats mama to be.|`|MGWPAc4Baa	Omg! Exactly the same thing happened to me! those tests are sooo cheap. Except for me, both of mine came out negative with the neg. line being very very light (almost invisible) so i remained unconvinced. Take at least two more to confirm if you indeed are pregnant. I'm still missing my period and soon I'll go for a blood test, so i can't exactly give you an answer but i wanted to share my similar experience with you.
WPI0Z47saa	I will tell you, sometimes I feel like my nipples are on FIRE!!!! This is my second pregnancy and it happened both times. Almost all of the time in the beginning and then a lot of times through out. Sometimes even my shirt touching them kills. It is just your breasts getting ready to produce milk. Nature is so cruel to make it feel this way. Good luck!|`|IFqY2w1Paa	I had that happen today, actually. I'm 35 weeks pregnant, so I attribute the pain to my body getting ready for the baby. No worries!|`|JMDQr0tqaa	Yep I've had that too. My breats are SO sore this time being pregnant. I have sharp pains and tingling, but the midwife says it's all good.
22aE3SCBaa	Okay, you need to test, because you need to find out if you are pregnant or not to do something about it.  If you are, here are your options:  1. Go ahead with the pregnancy. This will mean telling your cousin.. then you can  a) keep the baby  b) put it up for adoption.  2. Abortion / possibly a drug you can take to dispose of the baby but THE SOONER YOU FIND OUT & SORT THINGS OUT THE BETTER!!  Good luck :)|`|g5RS83paaa	tell your cousin, let them help you make the right decision. People make mistakes, if you don't want the baby and you want an abortion you need to do it quickly, they aren't expensive, have your boyfriend pay for it|`|IFqY2w1Paa	You aren't even 100% sure if you're pregnant or not yet, so you need to calm down and take it one step at a time. If you do get a positive pregnant test, make sure you tell anyone close with  you. That way, you will be able to get the support you need and make a decision that is right for you. There's no need to jump ahead of yourself and stress yourself out more than you need to. =)  Good luck.|`|YtFIAmCaaa	heres my advice: break up with 21 yr old dude, find some1 your own age, and stop acting like such a whore|`|Z4IwPsrHaa	I'm 16 y/o and 20 weeks pregers. I'll be having my baby 1 month before I turn 17. And I'm managing to keep the baby because I have a job and alot of money to save up and plus my moms helping out a bit. IF you are prego your boyfriend HAS to pay child support. SO If I were you I'd go get a job now and save up while you can and keep the baby OR have the baby and give it up for adoption. Dont abort the baby.     You can email me or IM me anytime.
WPI0Z47saa	You will have cramps in a normal pregnancy sometimes throughout the whole time. It is caused by your uterus and ligaments growing and stretching. It is scarey sometimes when you don't have a history of miscarriages. I can't even imagine how this makes you feel. But I assure you that some cramps are normal and sometimes they get pretty painful but it is just a part of pregnancy. I will keep you in my prayers. Good luck!|`|67QVKHQ3aa	as hard as this may sound you have to stop thinkin about it...if you keep stressin yourself out you can cause a misscarriage...im sure you dont wana be the reason you miscarry...stay positive and talk to your baby as if they are listening..(when no ones around) lol....and i dont know if your religious(im not really) but try praying...JUST DONT STRESS!!!!!        *good luck*|`|a6103b5448a81b3f2d761f035154c522aa	Many women have some cramping during pregnancy.

Hx6SYzPFaa	With the pill, the ways you are protected fully by the statistics of it are: either starting directly on the first day of your period or taking them CORRECTLY for 7 consecutive days, meaning one at the same time every day, or as directed by your doctor.  If you missed more than one pill and didn't "make up for it" by taking two on the first day you remember and two on the day after that, then there is the possibility that you could become pregnant.  Wait for your next scheduled period and if it's irregular or does not come at all, go to your doctor for a pregnancy test and explain to her what the situation was.|`|a6103b5448a81b3f2d761f035154c522aa	If you have sex, you can get pregnant regardless of if you're taking birth control or not.
LiPoEBenaa	We have spent over $2000 on clothes, crib, bedding, diapers, bottles, decorations etc.     The really expensive part comes in during the medical portion of pregnancy. The average cost of NORMAL pregnancy care and delivery can cost upwards of $14,000 - $20,000     Luckily, I have pretty good insurance and will only have to pay $2000-$4000.|`|faPKwClPaa	Whoo. A LOT.  Of course, it depends on if you have insurance or not, if you buy second-hand or not (or have lots of people to just give you their old baby items), etc.    For example, I ended up having to need a c-section, so there was that along with a 5-day stay in the hospital, which came to roughly $20K.    You have doctor's appointments at least once a month, with blood work and ultrasounds thrown in here and there, with all of that costing maybe $150 (a month).    Then the close and accessories -- the sky's the limit on that.  Friends and family really ended up buying a lot of the things we needed, so we probably only spent $1,500 of our own for the whole (convertible) crib and dresser set.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	with drs and all 10 k|`|T48smu01aa	a lot thats why we have baby showers haha...the best thing to do to keep the expense down if your not having a baby shower.....go on craigslist.com and look for clothes cribs bedding ect there people sometimes just give it away and it in great condition!!|`|WPI0Z47saa	That is what showers are for lol. We added up all of our gifts at the end to see and with the crib, diapers, bouncer etc, etc, etc, it came to over $2500 to get started and we didn't pick the most expensive stuff either. Then you have to count copays for dr's, tests and hospital. We only had a $30 copay for the pregnancy but each ultrasound we have to pay a $50 deductable and a $2000 copay for delivery. It is expensive and it only keeps adding up once the baby is here.|`|zQQd2wPRaa	14,000|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	a lot|`|6yy0jtzDaa	I have gotten   crib and bedset  carseat  stroller  playpen  highchair  swing  dresser  and that has costed me 1700 i haven't gotten any small stuff cuz i am waiting for the baby shower good luck!|`|TCGLe8sdaa	well gettin everything including buggy cot clothes bottles steriler stuff for hospital for u and the baby altogether it cost me nearly 800 euros... so ye it costs alot..... and my babys not even here yet|`|ca9dEvSAaa	It depends. How thrifty are you?     I have gotten alot at yard sales (summer time) and the good will, hope chest, and salvation army. For diapers my baby shower is very promising. I got a high chair in great condition for 7 dollars!    Anyway it depends on you. Ebay and Craigslist is also a great way to save money.    Also, on my baby shower I put, 'Hand-Me-Downs Welcome! =)' Any thing I don't need I donate to the Battered Womens Shelter in my home town.|`|82023d32c67aacffdd25314a33b1ea50aa	Not counting the doctor/hospital visits, I would say you need $2000 - $2500 to get all of your essentials such as crib, mattress, dresser, stroller, carseat, bouncer, bassinet, receiving blankets, onesies, clothes, pampers, wipes, (can never have enough of those two items) toys, breast pump, bottles.  And add a few more hundred for decorating the bedroom.  As far as the medical care part, I only had to pay a $20 co pay on my first visit, and no payments again until I went into labor and that bill was $500.
rqOIqO7Raa	Ok here is a question for you. Do you really think you should even be making out or having him *** on you if you don't even understand your body, your period or what it takes to get pregnant?    If you have not had sex and he did not *** inside of you or directly on the outside of your vagina then the chances of being pregnant are slim to none. Semen getting through underwear and causing pregnancy is EXTREMELY unlikely, though, possible. So if you had your pants and underwear on and he came on you..I am sure you are fine. Stress can delay a period. Take a pregnancy test and you will end any confusion you may have.|`|b64219f408e63daa3f8c2cba4d84a232aa	Yes stress can do that to you...think of it this way.  If you didn't have sex and are still a virgin  you cannot get pregnat.  You are safe. good luck|`|52U22fiAaa	no.|`|Xtqq71KGaa	possible, but highly unlikely.  yes, stress messes with you having your period.|`|OU9xnW86aa	Yes stress can delay your period.    If you are a virgin, really a virgin, then there is no way you are pregnant.    No, semen cannot go through clothes.|`|jNYEi0CTaa	No you cannot be pregnant.   Yes stress can alter your period.  A lot of things can.  You're not pregnant though
e9m6Y4bfaa	You're 19 and going on your 6th kid?!! Why? Don't you have goals? There is a lot more to life than lying on your back popping out babies that probably all the tax payers take care of!    To answer your question, Yes please get on birth control!|`|PBI3tCKaaa	This has got to be a troll.....|`|AA10071149	Ha! It will actually be your 4th, 5th, and 6th children.|`|jNYEi0CTaa	YES  lol  Go on the pill|`|AA11220327	just a sidenote here, 1 set of twins, a single birth and triplets would make 6 kids, not 5|`|x8JRkRNkaa	This isn't a serious question is it? Really, come on! Of course you should be on birth control. Who cares how much you love having sex. Birth control doesn't stop you from doing anything but getting pregnant. Also your story is a little flippy. You say your having triplets, which would bring your count up to 5, then you say you just found out your having baby number 4....I just don't buy the story. Anyway it adds up to 6|`|VTwirbhUaa	I honestly think you should consult your family and your doctor on this one. Think about what kind of life you will be able to give them, financially and with values. are you raising your other children? Do you have religion? No disrespect ment at all,|`|sLERr3aAaa	If you're not planning on anymore children it would be a good idea|`|OU9xnW86aa	faker faker faker|`|NSBL9bDFaa	...is this a joke?........|`|WGzypobeaa	Your math is wrong..Your having your 4th, 5th, and 6th baby.    twins=2  Plus 1  triplets=3    that's 6!?!     You need b/c please|`|MYilJDb5aa	Hey guys...there are people this stupid out there. You have to be careful with your answer.       If you do take b/c take it AFTER you give birth not while you're pregnant.      Just wanted to clarify.
rqOIqO7Raa	If you are really concerned for your friend, you need to go strait to her parents and let them deal with their daughter. Your friend may get mad at you but would it be better to have alive friend vs. a dead one?    From what you are saying it doesn't sound like pregnancy though the spotting could be implantation bleeding another thing that comes to mind is a ectopic pregnancy, which can be deadly to both mother and child if untreated.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	Ally and Chrystal nice try. This is a young girl who is scared her friend may be pregnant.  The last thing that they want to do right now is talk to there parents.  I will try to help you the best that I can.       LILLY--Take your friend to a local drug store or Wal-Mart and purchase an Early Pregnancy Test--also known as the EPT TEST.  Go to a local gas station (restroom) or somewhere private and do the test by following the instructions on the box.  Make sure you follow the instructions!!!!!!!  This test will tell you for sure if she is pregnant or not.  Now if you take the test at home make sure you hide the box so your and/ or her parents do not find it.  If she is not pregnant you have nothing to worry about.  Now if she is you will need to talk to your friend  about talking to her parents about her being pregnant.  Tell her you will go with her when she wants to tell them for support.  This is as far as you yourself can go on this.  This is your friends responsibility to tell her parents and not yours.  If you interfere she will hate you for the rest of your life.  If you want to tell her parents you will lose her as a friend so you will have to decide as to whether you want her for a friend or an enemy.|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	omg that sux, but if she started to bleed are u sure that's not her period? i guess all u can do is just try to encourage her to go to the doctor an see wat's going on or take a test.|`|kcdB6sswaa	Either she is having her period OR it is implantation bleeding.  Implantation bleeding is normally way less then the normal period.  Either way, I would hope she would take a test to check.  Dollar Tree has them for only a buck.
GhetCx0iaa	ah  SCREAMSSSSSSS  you must be feeling so worried.  I am so sorry, i wish u didnt feel so bad ugh.  We all make mistakes, and some mistakes lead to MUCH BIGGER ONES. but u have to stay calm, dont think about it right now.    Ok, so you want to take a pregnancy test like 1 week after you had sex, that way you're less likely to get false negatives.  Don't tell your boyfriend until you're 100% sure.    And you knowwwwwww, you might just be paranoid, and this might just be God's way of giving you a wake up call.  :}    Hope for the best  p.s. im 15 too     NILA  XOXOX0X0KXOS|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	I can't believe how mean some people can be. I mean, loser, keep your legs closed? People make mistakes.     Anyway, if you were supposed to have your period on Sunday, then you can take a test. Your urinating and belly ache might just be a bladder infection or something else. Lots of things can make you late (stress, weight loss, etc.) Just take a test, and if it's negative and you still don't have your period in a week, go see an OBGYN or take another test. Talk to your mom too. I'm sure that if you let her know that you're sexually active, she will help you get on proper birth control.|`|qog0Yd72aa	This sounds like the secret life tv show!  You should watch it, it will make you feel better, and not worry as much. Its not your fault and please tell your parents. they love you and always will. You made a bad choice, but you cant go back now, so just do your best and i really wish you luck. I am very sorry htis happened.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You cannot be experiencing pregnancy symptoms. It's not physically possible. You are most likely feeling sick because you are so worried about being pregnant that the stress is upsetting your stomach. You can't take a test for at least another week so you are just going to have to wait and see hon.|`|akB0gV20aa	Wait until 3-4 weeks after unprotected sex for the most accurate result.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	You can take one now and I suggest you do that asap then get to your Dr (if it's positive) to revise your options and get help. Good luck. x|`|4uB0bbhnaa	why didn't you get the morning after pill    test in around a week or so as doing it before won't  necessarily show up a correct answer|`|PBI3tCKaaa	You might just have a UTI.  If you miss your period, test.  And if your going to have sex-use protection!|`|QCj4QA4yaa	JUST TAKE IT EASY!!!! STAY WHERE YOU ARE, AND CALL 911 OK??????|`|uhmWX5Qkaa	you might be pregnant since all these signs are showing yes....don't hestitate to tell someone you truly trust. someone that isn't going to flip too much or tell you parents. Tell you parents IF they wont be so angry. Have a pregnancy test as soon as you can.|`|AA10309966	ur not being judged :)  im 15 too..and i've had unprotected sex a couple of times. after u had it, you should have gotten a morning-after pill, that you can have up to 48 hours after sex. but don't freak out too much. you're period could just be late naturally. stop panicking over every detail...wait til sunday again...if it hasn't come get a pregnancy test, or if you're really anxious get one now, theres some that you can get for 4 days after.|`|SFvpjdTMaa	Lovey you can buy a test called first response and it tells you six days before your due, I have 5 kids and had my first when i was sixteen, and from what you are saying its sounds like you very well could be, or else if  your stressing about it too much that can also stop your period from coming, i would advise you to go to a chemist and buy a test straight away tomorrow, If you can get back to me and let me know how uget on k sweetie good luck x x x x|`|iOmi2JAtaa	you need to speak to your parents/adult asap. its not the end of the world and you might be panicking for no reason. please talk to someone|`|Coc593Ikaa	I beg to differ with many other opinions. I don't know if you are a loser, but you are certainly trying to act like one. You are not responsible enough to be having sex. How can I tell? First, you had unprotected sex. Second, you didn't seek out emergency contraception afterwards. Third, you haven't done easy research about what has happened. Every home pregnancy test tells you on the box when you can take it. They will also tell you on their websites. This is not hidden information.     You communicate well for a 15 year old. Please do try to keep your head on your shoulders so that you can have the future you want. The future  that you plan for yourself. Having a baby at your age is not ideal. And as much as you love your boyfriend now, most of us look back and sigh about the people that we dated back in school. Don't tie yourself to a boy when you are so young. If you do get pregnant, he will be in your life always.     As for that test, you can take them with very good results after you have missed your period. If it is positive, then you are pregnant. If it is negative, you should retest again several days later. And there is no need to buy expensive tests, the cheapo ones are just fine.|`|IAM1O7Hlaa	take the pregnancy test now, by now must show positive if you are, good luck. if you are talk with your parents do not be afraid.|`|UVbHNbMiaa	that idiot who has just called you a loser is a proper idiot, there are younger people than you that are pregnant or having sex, well that's whats happened to my mate but she came on a few days after she was due on, you can go to the doctors with a friend and try and get it sorted.  hope i helped  and good luck.x|`|3OVn4Ceoaa	Ur not a loser...everyone makes mistakes and this doesn't have to be really. As long as you're mature enough to handle what's going on you'll b good. And wait about two or three weeks then take a test, that way it won't b able to give you a false negative. Good Luck on whatever you want!!!|`|UD6xvMEkaa	Hey, Im Also 15 And Im 18 Weeks Pregnant, Lucky My Family And My Boyfriends Family Are All Supportive,  I Found Out That I Was Pregnant When I Was 2 Months Gone,  Im Not Sure When Is The Best Time To Take A Test,  xx|`|UbvBIDy6aa	If you just missed your period Sunday you probably don't have morning sickness yet.If your stomach feels more like cramps from a period,that was something that happened to me that allowed me to wait 10 days before I took a pregnancy test,which was positive.But I did already feel sick my 6th week.You can take a pregnancy test right now.E.P.T I believe is one you take take 10 days BEFORE your missed period.But you don't need an expensive one,there is more of a chance it being negative and wrong that positive and wrong.It test for the certain pregnancy hormone so even cheap ones will work fine. Good Luck|`|71073e87f86b8ae8fbfc18e6da2770e3aa	you can take a test by now so before you really start to worry do that first, the best thing to do is find two different ones and do both of them.     If you are not pregnant you were lucky and dodged the bullet, and this is a good sign that you were not ready to be having sex.     Now if you are pregnant well you have three options keep it, give it up or have an abortion, but before you decided on what you want to do you need to talk to your boyfriend and your parents, see what kind of support you will have but in the end do not let anyone push you into something you may regret later. Go for counseling through your school or doctor.|`|owCDhOsuaa	Ok, first off, take a deep breathe and try to relax.  There's a good chance that your not pregnant, and could possibly just be late.  I think your really stressing yourself out, and that can make you come really late.  Lots of stress.    A woman doesn't get any signs of pregnancy until months after.  So, even if you were, you wouldn't feel any different than you would normally.    Morning sickness usually happens closer to 3 months into your term.  And not all women gets morning sickness.  My mom never did.  My best friend didn't, and neither did her mom.   As far as Pregnancy Tests:  It's best to wait 6 weeks after you have sex.|`|ZZt66zMjaa	im 15 to n i have only kissed like two guys in my life so what i am gonna tell you might sting for a minute but it is pretty obvious  dont have sex you retard gosh i mean really he will pretend to love you until he realizes youre probably pregnant n he leaves you so he doesnt have to take n e responsibility for the kid that you 2 idiots concieved... go to ur doctor and get a blood test it will tell you if youre pregnant almost the next day|`|cBzyOACFaa	Your not a loser you just made a bad decision to have unprotected sex.( we all do at some point in our lives!)  Try not to worry and wait maybe a week if your period still doesn't appear then i suggest you confide in a friend or relative (Mum, Aunt, Cousin) or go and see your GP.  if your period appears then take a lesson and don't have unprotected sex until your are more mature and in a loving relationship.  NOTE:  Many young teenagers have babies and are wonderful responsible parents despite what stigma is attached to teen mums. And remember there are other options speak to your GP. Try not to worry and relax what will be will be!|`|QS7gq7Fzaa	you can have the test right away.  You might not be pregnant  but nerves . It will be ok but don't do it again WITH out protection.  One sigh is that your breast hurts.   good luck.
kaqPSgTVaa	If you had a normal flow period you are NOT pregnant. Pregnant women don't have periods. They can spot or have a light flow of bleeding but NOT a period. That is the shedding of your uterine lining. You are not pregnant. Chill.|`|MtC3CWZraa	The simple answer to your title question: A pregnancy test|`|jNYEi0CTaa	You're not pregnant.  The pill can have side effects.  Don't worry.|`|WGzypobeaa	What holiday?|`|OJFz0LBZaa	sounds like its side effects from the pill as you have just started it,also  some pills can make you bloated ect if you carry on feeling this way maybe change your pill as not every pill suits every person, enjoy your holiday
OU9xnW86aa	I got my belly overnight in my 15th week.    Congrats! :)|`|Bs8sllD9aa	I got my belly around 12 weeks but it really came out at around 20 weeks. Everyone is different just wait you will wake up one morning and think wowo where did this come from|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	i got my belly by 16 weeks!    i started to show real soon!|`|PBI3tCKaaa	Around 20 weeks|`|duinadV4aa	mine was around 18weeks|`|5WYeHh0paa	I was about 120 lbs and 5'8" when I got pregnant.   I havent gained much weight but I bearly even have a bump and I'm 23 weeks.   So hopefully its all bby and none of it is extra fat!!|`|AA11100500	I was about 7 months before I started showing...    Mommy to a 4 month old little girl~|`|Wpulf29Maa	At 5 Months|`|jNYEi0CTaa	Usually around 5 months  But every woman is different|`|0b3222142a6140d50a18e4b471b4f9a0aa	Everyone is different, and since you work out so much your stomach muscles are less relaxed than other women. I am 14 weeks with my first baby and I do not excersise except for 45minute walks at work. I am just starting to show, but I was also a little underweight when I started out, so it looks more like i had a big lunch!|`|3OVn4Ceoaa	I didn't start to show until I was like six months or so...every woman is different though so you'll have to see.|`|iwtetdBoaa	I DID AROUND 6 MONTHS|`|e7b80e1d39247de6534e1736b54bed52aa	Im 10-11 weeks.  im starting to show.but its not like OMG! she pregnant.  its just you know when your body will start to show.  but excercise is Great and so is eatting right. but idk about seven days a week.|`|jjQOvFyzaa	It depends on the person. I didn't have a "bump" till 6 or 7 months. The time before than I had a little pouch just in my lower belly which can completely be mistaken as chubby. I excercised a lot also until I started getting morning sickness around 8 weeks. Honestly, my advise is to just make sure you eat healthy and walk/ walk steps..nothing ridiculously intense.|`|IcNJFRYIaa	If you're very slim to begin with you might start showing earlier. I'm 5'7" 115 pounds pre-pregnancy and I started to show at 9 weeks even though at that time I had only gained 2 pounds.|`|cNxqtd6gaa	You start to show around 16-18 weeks but where you are noticeable to other people is around 20 weeks or so. I am 25 weeks right now and I get asked all the time when I am due.
rqOIqO7Raa	Yes it will cost that much if you do not go through a doctor to get a rx. Walgreens sells them for $48|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's not done by prescription so yes it will cost that much. I also don't think that Tricare covers Plan B. I'm Tricare Prime as well...|`|BLbZVvejaa	cvs and walgreens does carry PLAN B but idk how much they cost. Call them|`|AA10071149	Since it is sold over the counter and not as a prescription, it doesn't matter that you have insurance. You will pay full cost, just like you do with aspirin or cough syrup.|`|82023d32c67aacffdd25314a33b1ea50aa	Why don't you just go to your local Health Department?  It's available for free.|`|AA11609300	I've taken it in the past and I got it at Planned Parenthood for $28.  Make sure you bring an ID with you.|`|jTkJbTc6aa	i went with my friend so she could get it once...long story...but we went to CVS and it was 50$ all together i think i was plan B you have to go to the pharmacy and show ID that you are 18 and then they will give it to you atleast thats how it is where i live...try going to a planned parenthood though its probally cheaper there|`|o3q5CbXXaa	plan parent hood much cheaper or probably free for first time|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I believe that its going to cost the same regardless. i also think that they should have come out with a generic by now!   Also Planned Parenthood offers free- low cost Plan B if you qualify based on age and income.

Sorry. It takes that long.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	huh take a test when you are late|`|PXfUyd5aaa	I think you have to wait about two weeks after having sex, otherwise hormones will confuse the results.|`|047IPSovaa	you children are so fortunate to have two such loveing and long-range-thinking breeders|`|NPmRmnG6aa	Wait till your misses period and then take a test. Also, not to be mean, you may want to invest in some grammar classes as well.|`|bNA5BuKCaa	wait til u are close to your period|`|AA11220327	sorry hun, the day after (even 2 days after) is much to early, you are going to have to give it a few weeks|`|e7b80e1d39247de6534e1736b54bed52aa	wait till after your to have that missing period.  but you always have to give time for the hormones to kick in to give you a positive on that test.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Buy a test and read the box. Duh.|`|V2AML53Taa	Take the test when ur period is late!|`|x1VLBHOJaa	From sex to conception takes 72 hours. Most pregnancy tests nowadays can be taken very early. I'd take one on the 10th, that would be a good time.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Wow that was hard to read. The soonest you can take a test is 10-14 days after unprotected sex, but even then it may be too early to tell. Wait until you've missed your period.|`|OGCSiRXMaa	Take the test when your period is late..  **Hope this Helps**|`|LZ4QYrPXaa	Hiyaa,    take it 2 weeks from now, I know that you will think that its ages away but wait so you can have an accurate result. I really hope that the result is the one you want!|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I know that the tests are based on hormones and 1 in 300 women can test 3-4 days after ovulation and conception and get a positive due to high Hcg Levels. This is not very common, happened with me though. Other than that it takes a while, usually you just have to wait 2-3 weeks til you would normally have a period.
okp0CMc3aa	Warfarin is teratogenic. Effects on the fetus include frontal bossing, midface hypoplasia, saddle nose, cardiac defects, short stature, blindness and mental retardation. Warfarin should be avoided during the first trimester. It should also be avoided around the time of delivery    Go to your doctor!!!!!|`|iyL6dyMyaa	If I were you, I would go see the school nurse possibly, since you're still on you're parents insurance.  What about your dad?  Try Planned Parenthood, or a clinic.  Or the Lighthouse Shelter that takes in pregnant girls.  I don't know?  Tell your mom that you want to keep the baby, and that you will take care of it, she can't just make you abort it, what does the baby's father think of this and his family?  They might want to take care of the baby?  I don't know just some options.  Call your local hospital and ask to speak to the phone nurse, tell her what you told us and see what she recommentds.  Tell her your whole situation, she may be able to help  you.  Good Luck.|`|627pWyVkaa	You need to discuss this with your doctor ASAP. Were not doctors we cant advise you on what it will or wont do, you need to test yourself to see if you are even pregnant and if you are, you need to see a doctor anyways, You might not be able too be on this medication anymore, Or you may have too switch to another form.|`|e7b80e1d39247de6534e1736b54bed52aa	Well im the person you should tell your mom.BUt if she going to make you get an abortion, and its not good.  im not sure about your blood thinner. but on how to hide it.  just try to keep active. like still work out but not as hard.just take it a lil easier..it shoudl keep you looking thin till about 10-15 weeks. by then im pretty sure you cant get an abortion after 6 weeks?..  best of luck!!!
vue9NOhYaa	What are YOU eating?      An 11 month old who is good with finger foods can eat just about anything an adult eats.  So, make meals for the adults in the family, cut some up, and let him eat.  If there are one or two parts of the meal that he can't eat (hard/very chewy  foods that are choking hazards, or things he's allergic to, or extremly spicy, or containing honey, or really unhealthy in general [i.e. donuts for breakfast]) ), then give him the parts he CAN eat.  If you're having chicken, rice and peas, HE can have chicken, rice and peas. If you're having a tuna sandwich for lunch, give  him some tuna and bread. (He'll probably make a mess of a sandwich, so offer the parts separately.)     For snacks?  Fruit, crackers, simple cookies (like nilla wafers or animal crackers) string cheese, healthy dry cereals (cheerios, chex, kix, etc).    The sooner he starts eating from the regular family table, the lower the risk that he'll end up being a picky toddler who refuses anything but chicken nuggets.|`|8DnIXwnyaa	try the dole frozen wild blueberries (they are smaller)  my son loves them!|`|l9jVMVBBaa	dice up some boiled veggies and let them eat them.|`|W0gMQVoDaa	scrambled egg xx|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	cut up bannanas, apples, mango.

B7FL0rdqaa	I started having the same pains around 21 weeks, I'm 26 weeks now, but they were not too severe, It was definitely a major discomfort. I've also heard a few other of my pregnant friends complain about the same kind of pains. My guess is that it's caused by your uterus pushing upwards against your stomach/organs and causing everything to feel cramped, So it definitely could be gas pains, Especially at 23 weeks, which is around the time when the baby and everything starts moving upwards.   If you're experiencing any other discomforts though, like difficulty breathing, lightheadedness, etc. I'd call your OB/Doctor just to be on the safe side.|`|ODZeyNYMaa	Unfortunately it is normal for pregnancy, but you may want to talk to your OB-Gyn about it. It sounds like heartburn, and it is painful.   I took Tums like mad when I was pregnant, I am sorry you're in pain!  Hope you feel better soon, and if you are really worried, I would call your doctor, they are more than happy to help you or answer any questions!  Good Luck!|`|Koa7k86qaa	I never had that problem when I was pregnant, but when I wasn't, I had those horrible pains. It was my gallbladder acting up. I would tell your Dr. about the pains at your next visit. It could be gallstones, or you could have cholesterol deposits lining your gallbladder. I don't know what they will do since you are pregnant, if they don't remove it while your pregnant, I highly recommend getting it done soon after. I was told by my surgeon that its perfectly normal for women who have been pregnant to have issues with there gallbladder. Also, check with your dr to see what type of gas relief you can take. Im a big fan of gas-x|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Its totally normal you'll have gas the whole time, not always painful but sometimes.|`|W0gMQVoDaa	i had a lot of trapped wind when i was pregnant and it was a so painful used to last for hours at a time but if it goes on for too long you should get checked just incase xx|`|e90a8e2ee095e648a3f92f15f7959eb6aa	I've had that twice, both times were related to my gallbladder.  The first time the pain radiated around to my back.  I went to the hospital and they found out the pregnancy caused me to get gallstones and I was having a gallbladder attack.  They want me to get it out about a month after the baby's born, but I still haven't decided if I'll do it that soon yet.    The second time was after I ate some yogurt that had aspartame in it.  I usually don't eat anything with artificial sweeteners, but I accidentally bought yogurt that did, so I ate half of it anyway.  Big mistake!  I ended up getting the same pains.  However, once I threw up the pains finally went away.  I think this time my gallbladder was just aggravated, but I didn't go on to have a full attack.    It could just be gas, but it could be your gallbladder too, so if you don't feel better within an hour or two, I'd call the doctor.
55ee067021e9f50f6a754f34a76c07d9aa	I had an Audi TT, which is a two seater. We still have it but its no longer really "mine". I drive it when I don't have the baby with me. I now have a 4runner, which I love don't get me wrong, but its just something about a little sports car, that is quick and has that sound.....aahhhhhh.....|`|rAkWoweOaa	I know. I bought a brand new eclipse a month before I found out I was pregnant. I haven't sold it or traded it in because I love it sooo much! It is a standard, very sporty. My husband gave me his new truck which was nice of him, but it is a double cab diesel dually! Yuck. I feel safer driving the little car than that huge tank. To answer your question, there is no talking sense into you. I have ALWAYS driven 2 door sports cars, some with no backseats. The things you give up for mommyhood, lol!|`|IkkYOehSaa	ok so sorta get you there. I am a truck girl. I had a nice suv ( big tires, 4 wheel drive, big engine) about a year ago.

(still wanna cry about it) But every time I drive my sister's truck it roars to life and the power compared to my crappy car is...well....almost orgasmic. there is no other way. I am not into the sports cars but when I am in a truck and the engine roars to life when I turn that key......OH MY GOD!!!!  So I know a little bit of what you are talking about.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	It won't be free but you can call legion halls, other churches, community centers, and there's always McDonald's *lol*  Not sure what they charge.  I know legion halls are cheap because the cheap/poor parts of my family use them for funeral receptions (its just a room)    Also all the "indoor playgrounds" do parties on weekends, I'm not sure what their prices are like.|`|JP2h62qiaa	AWWW!!! No Fair! Don't you hate that?I am really sorry they cramped the parade. Try Chuckee cheese, Pizza Hut, McDonald's! any kids play place like that. Any place with a video arcade.   They may charge a small fee.  My cousin had her sons second B-day in local named pizza place. They charged her 100 bucks for 5 large pizzas and unlimited refills. She got the private room connected to the arcade.  I personally couldn't do that for hunter. We were in a financial crisis on his first Bday. I am SO lucky my mother payed for 75% of the stuff.     IS the guest list big? You can always do it in a house. Even an apartment. Some one on cafe mom just had like 10 people over to her 500 Square foot house for her daughters first b-day..She warned them about floor seating. Lol.    Yeah but try the pizza places.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Chuck E Cheese!  My nephew is actually having his party there this weekend.   There is no  "fee" you can use as many tables for free!  But they do sell party packages, but they run a bit on the high side.  Its something to consider.      EDIT- Chuck e Cheese has that ONE token for any game which is real cool because some other popular/pizza chains charge up to 8 quarters for the larger games! Chuck E also has a few small rides now days!  You can also find coupons for 100 tokens for 14.99. Which is a great deal!|`|oDGpmkMaaa	how about a pizza place? like Abby's or Chuck-e-chesse?|`|GZdvHbT5aa	You could go to a Burger King or McDonald's with a nice play place.    They don't charge, you just pay if you eat.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	If someone belongs to a "club" like the Elks, Moose, etc. you could always have the party there. I had my baby shower held at a veteran's club    Edit: Legion was the word I was thinking of!|`|nCKdkYSyaa	I couldnt find one. My apt clubhouse wanted 300 bucks! I found a Hall for 75.00 and a church for 150.00 but didnt find anything for free... :( i wish you good luck though! I just ended up throwing it at my apartment. It actually wasnt that bad. We have a 2bed 2 bath upstairs apt and we fit  5kids and 14 adults in their :) lol so anything is possible!    i would still search in the yellow pages or look up "halls" sometimes they make you give a deposit but after you leave and clean it up you get your money back...|`|sAhAEC2qaa	yes chuckee cheese is a good idea. thats where i will be having my sons 1st bday as well. if none of them are in town, try to think of any1 that lives in an apartment besides your sil. or any elderly reletives that live in assisted living. assisted living places almost always have a community room and your elderly reletive could attend that way as well|`|vJEatJFPaa	Have you tried calling around and asking Legion Halls of YMCA facilities??    Or hotel banquet halls...like at Holiday Inn or something?|`|b2huJkOjaa	skating party|`|9X09kM4oaa	If you have any friends that live in a apartment complx sometimes the complex has a clubhouse they lend to their renters at night for parties or etc. You may want to try that, I love in a apartment complex and had my baby shower here it was wonderful|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I would try a legion.  they usually have pretty good prices, and usually if you hold an event on a off day like a Friday, it is even less expensive.     I personally wouldn't want to hold a party for a young child at chuckee Cheese or McDonalds, its crabby food, not really fit for a baby, and can be very impersonal.      Good luck.       And I saw you had asked about themes.  I kept it simple.  I sorta did a dinasour theme, with a cute little childs looking dinosaur on the cake, green plates and napkins, and my son had a little dinasour outfit on.  I didn't go all out on purchasing themed things, as all those things seemed really over priced.  Green and white cray paper for streamers, and table cloths with dinasours.    I think I spent about 20 dollars in all on the decorations, plates, and napkins.  Cake was $30.  Food costed about $70.   I spent only a little over $100 on my sons birthday.|`|mjlhZAVxaa	I don't know if you have one near you, but there is Ricobene's here in Chicago and they were the cheapest I could find.  For $75 you get a HUGE party room for 4 hours.  You don't even have to get their food.  They have a catering menu that is decent and then a per-person price unlimited [which is ridiculous, $17.00 a person] food and drinks.  I am going with the room and buying my cake and some decorations and getting a few pizza's from them and a salad totaling with the room $150, they said I can decorate it any way I like and I can have my own music, the party room holds up to 155 people, max, which I am sure I will have an in and out stream of around 50 or so!  But that was the cheapest I could find.  I would suggest a pizza chain place, like Connie's or Giordano's or Chicago's Pizza, but I don't know if any of these are in your 'hood.  Also I had my baby shower at the Garfield Park Conservatory, we rented a room out and their chairs and tables for $50!  Maybe you have a Conservatory near your mom's in Iowa?  Good luck!|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Is there a local Mall maybe? I think about the mall here in my home town and it is really quiet. I am sure no one would notice if we set up shop in the food court and had a birthday party. That would only work though if your mall was as slow as ours...
es4XOyR3aa	sounds normal its human nature to build it up and save it for a more appripriate time so when we wake up we go for a huge pee... she is jsut way ahead and girls usually are. If rthe wee she does at 9 is compenstating not going hen Iwouldnt worry. If she wasnt peeing at all through night and only a small in morning then i would bring it up. she sounds normla and jsut advanced!|`|vI0WnAiOaa	if this happens on a regular basis this is good as when you think now is the time, hold her over the potty for that first wee of the day. it will save you washing clothes and save a nappy. yeah for her and you.

HCvJ0AGnaa	Sounds brilliant to me.    Snacks, yes add some. Try half cooked carrot batons (steamed is best) half cooked as they are easier for the baby to chew on yet soft to swallow.  Peeled apple cubes and plain banana have always been a hit with mine.    You've provided a wide and varied diet.  My boys now older eat everything and are given foods from all over the world, they try and if they don't like fine, but they still try!  You need to provide as much variety and taste as possible early on, this way they become eager to explore foreign foods later on in life.    Good luck with your assignment.|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	By 'weaned' do you mean only just being introduced to solids?    If so, this is far too much, contains too many allergenic foods (egg whites, wheat . . .)  & foods not suitable for under ones and also does not contain anywhere near enough milk feeds.    This would be a great menu for a toddler but not a just weaning baby.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	When my eldest was being weaned, he loved mashed avocado, mashed bananas and stewed apples. But it was only a couple of weeks before he was demanding people-food, and eating ( with enormous delight) things like shepherd's pie and spaghetti bolognese. He much preferred stuff with lots of garlic and onions. At five months old he had the most colossal Christmas dinner, with five helpings of mashed turkey followed by two plates of pudding.  It didn't do him a bit of harm either. He is now 6ft tall and a very keen foodie/cook|`|JisgVZwUaa	You have evidently thought long and hard - well done.  A couple of suggestions - watch out for two lots of pasta in one day.  Maybe add some nice spices such as cinnamon to the cooked pear.  Perhaps also not so much wheat.  Rice crackers and raw vegetable are good as snacks, maybe as optional!  Keep up the good work.  If you need other references I swore by Annabel Karmels cookbooks.  Good luck!|`|5YPSyP91aa	horrible, your kid's gonna be fat.|`|4JgSq2rlaa	dont understand thursday ur weaning him right so how can u feed pizza and salmon to a baby. give him puree food like really smooth potaoes mixed with turnips or mashed bananas just make sure the food aint too lumpy. experiment with food find out what he loves and remember to add all healthy organic veg and when adding milk make sure its formula of bresat milk cos the cannot have cows milk just yet good luck!!! xxx|`|d2fcf78a4441e801854c7b22e08d60b8aa	It certainly looks good and varied. I have a couple of comments:    I would definitely put in a morning and afternoon snack. Depending on the stage of weaning this may be something like a rice-cake, piece of fruit or a muesli bar with milk which (as weaning progresses) can be substituted with water.     You need to identify the foods that may cause a problem younger children. You note egg whites but strawberries, soya (therefore tofu), wheat (and gluten), and oily fish such as salmon and tuna (although tinned tuna is usually OK), tomatoes are also associated with allergies.     I would try and find a spot for some white fish (such as Haddock), which can be served with peas.    Monday: You have pasta dishes for both lunch and dinner  Tues: Given that strawberries are potentially allergenic you could substitute cherries, prunes, apple, raspberries etc.  Wed: I would steer clear of scrambled eggs even yokes for any baby under 1. Low salt baked beans on toast would be fine.  Thurs: You could substitute white fish for the salmon  Sat: as for Tues    Good luck with the assignment. x    Now I have to go and get myself a muffin with cream cheese and avocado (yum).
xXnFx6qLaa	When I started to try and get Johnny to pick up foods, I put the food in his hand and guided his hand to his mouth.  I had to do this over and over again for a few days, helping him feed himself.  Eventually, he got it.  Just keep at it, he'll get it!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Maybe he chews his toys because he's teething and they are hard?    He's only little. Just keep on feeding him, while giving him access to feed himself if he wants to - sooner or later you'll turn round to get something and when you turn back he'll be feeding himself because he got bored of waiting. If he carries on expecting you to do all the work, then make sure you find more and more times when you need to turn round and do something else and he has to wait :)|`|CiRtM8lmaa	What do I need to know about feeding my new baby?  For the first six months of life, your baby needs only breast milk or infant formula to eat.  Breastmilk contains a unique mix of fatty acids, lactose, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and other important factors that combine to make the perfect infant food. It has everything a baby needs for easy digestion, brain development, healthy growth, and protection from illness. Find out more about deciding between breastfeeding and formula feeding and about feeding your newborn.    You should know that the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) states that [1]:        * Breastfeeding is best for all infants, even premature and sick babies, with rare exceptions.      * Newborns should be nursed when they show signs of hunger, like being more alert or active, mouthing, or rooting.  By the time a baby is crying from hunger, they have already been hungry for a while.  In the early weeks, newborns should nurse about 8-12 times every 24 hours, usually for about 10-15 minutes on each breast.      * Breast milk alone is the ideal food for the first 6 months of life.  If you wean your baby before 12 months of age, give an iron-fortified formula.  The formula should be iron-fortified to prevent anemia (low blood count).  Don't start cow's milk until your child is one year old.  Cow's milk does not have the vitamins babies need.  There is generally no need to give your breastfed baby water, juice or other foods in the first 6 months.      * Breastfeeding should ideally continue for at least 12 months, and as long after that as both mother and baby want to keep on nursing.  (The World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding for two years or more.)      * Mother and baby should sleep near each other to make breastfeeding easier at night.      * Breastfeeding has important health benefits for babies, such protecting against diarrhea, ear infections, bacterial meningitis, and possibly also SIDS, diabetes, obesity and asthma.      * Breastfeeding is healthy for mothers. It can reduce their risk of ovarian and breast cancer, and osteoporosis and hip fractures post-menopause.      * Adoptive mothers can breastfeed, and pediatricians should talk to them about the benefits of this option.    Read the full AAP policy statement on breastfeeding and the use of human milk or the press release about the recommendations.    A special note to parents of babies who are dark-skinned and exclusively breastfed (no formula and limited solids): Your baby may benefit from taking vitamin D during the first year of life [2]. Dark-skinned, breastfed babies can get rickets (weak bones) from a lack of sunlight during the winter. Our bodies use sunlight on our skin to make vitamin D. In the winter when the sun is low, babies don't go outside as much, and we bundle them up, so their bodies have less chance to make the vitamin D they need for strong bones. Talk to your baby's doctor about vitamin D supplements.    Is it safe to prepare formula with well water?    Formula and food prepared with well water may cause nitrate poisoning [3] . If you use well water, have it tested regularly for nitrate content, and consider that its safest to breastfeed your baby. Even when mothers take in very high levels of nitrates, a breastfed baby is not at risk. Find out more about the role of dietary nitrate in food and water from the AAP.    How can I get breastfeeding information and support?        * La Leche League International (LLL) can help you solve breastfeeding problems. They offer lots of helpful books and pamphlets and can help you find a LLL group that meets near you. Visit LLL's Breastfeeding Help page for breastfeeding resources, forums, podcasts, or to ask a question.      * The American Academy of Pediatrics has many helpful breastfeeding resources that offer information on many issues that might come up.      * Here is nutrition information for vegetarian breastfeeding mothers.    How do I know if my baby is getting enough to eat?  Keep track of your baby's wet and poopy diapers.  Once mom's milk comes in, the theory of "what-goes-in-one-end-comes-out-the-othe... works.  If your baby has 4-6 wet disposable diapers (or 6-8 cloth) and 3-4 poopy diapers in 24 hours that usually means they are getting enough milk.  Talk to your baby's health care provider at your office visits about your baby's growth chart if you are concerned or curious.  (See below for online growth chart links.)  It is important to remember that as babies get a little older the number of bowel movements per day may decrease.  Some breastfed babies have only one bowel movement per week (after about 2 months of age).    How and when do I start my baby on solid foods?  Don't rush to start solids.  They will only upset your baby's tummy if you give them before your baby is ready to digest them.  Breast milk or formula is far more nutritious than any solid you could give your baby.  Solid foods aren't as convenient, anyway|`|4JgSq2rlaa	i understand totally what ur going throiugh i think u need to experient more on what he loves to eat cos its seems ur not given him much variety they do change all of a sudden from jar food he'll want freshly cooked food and maybe the food u r eating so just see hopefully it'll be fine dont worry try getting him pizza finger or fish fingers give him finger food where he can just sit there and take his time good luck|`|by7H31Djaa	I would start with getting rid of the mesh feeder. My son didn't like the taste of the mesh material...yes it has a taste! Lol Try not feeding him at all and setting the food on his high chair tray, not even on a plate. Give him a few minutes and see what happens. If after about 10-15 minutes he doesn't try to out it into his mouth then guide the food into his hand and then mouth. Also i'd say forget the spoon. My son is 15 months old and still hasn't got the hand of actually getting food on his spoon or fork. My son learned right away at 6 months to feed himself so i never had this problem from the beginning. Just now that he refuses to eat some feeds because of the way it looks. Before he'd put ANY food in his mouth and now i have to just set it in front of him and then he'll try himself without me forcing it into his mouth. Good Luck :o)|`|lGSUToFQaa	try eating in front of him that's what i had to do with our 7 month old, who chews on the handle of his mesh feeder too, i also got some plastic baby spoons and let desmond play with them for a while, he finally started putting them in his mouth the right way, i'd start with some real foods, desmond does okay with foods cut  really small, but he sucks with food on a spoon, he knows where the spoon goes till it get food on it, good luck|`|mlT1ZrZtaa	have a meal with him sit in front of him so he can watch you put the food in yout mouth so he will copy give him a boost say go on jacob you will it does he drink alot if so that might be it he might be full on drink  all the best  x|`|BcjFssaEaa	just keep trying leave finger food around n let him feed himself, give him a bowl n give him a spoon n walk away it might be messy but he might just do it  xxxx|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Well I don't think he needs a mesh feeder, just cook and cut things up.  I never used one of those things.    Do you cut things up into bite sized pieces and put it on the tray in front of him?  Like try cutting up some cooked fruit or steamed sweet potato or squash into bite sized pieces. If he just stares at it, feed him a piece or 2 and hopefully then he will start picking it up and eating it if he likes it.  Just keep doing this over and over and eventually he will start picking up the food and eating it.    Edit: My son is 13 months and still will not use a spoon to feed himself, first get him feeding himself with his hands, worry about spoons later!|`|iAQKD2YBaa	I am not sure if you have these available but I started my baby on "rusks" from 6 months of age, they are a perfect size and he can hold them himself. The first time I passed it to him he put his mouth out as if I was going to feed him, I said "no, you do it" and put it in his hand, he worked out pretty quickly that it was food and now sits in his pram or high chair chewing away on one, because they are designed for babies, they are very safe, they start off hard and then get softer the more they chew/suck on them.  I am the same as you with food, scared stiff that he will choke, but with the rusks they never break into big bits. Possibly, try him on these and then just put the food on his tray (without a plate) and trust me, he will eventually learn that if mum doesn't feed me this food, I will need to get it myself : )  I also gave him little bits of prawn crackers on his hi chair tray, these are good for non choking as well because they melt in their mouth, there was a mess, but he took them off his high chair and ate them on his own.    Good luck : )
j4OBEeAlaa	i do sex education.except here in ireland (well in my school anyway) we call it health.i think that many schools have stopped doing sex education because they feel that either older kids allready know about the facts of life etc or that younger kids will be thought by their parents.i notice that many other boys i have talked to complained that in their sex education class they only learned about the female part of the course and never about the male side.in this way,i dont see the use of having such a class if only one side of the story is being told.but that doesnt meant obligatory sexual ed classes woudnt be usefull.it would be handy for kids who are 2 embarrased to talk to their parents about it|`|xeS8pUfbaa	yes  they dont teach kids about sex anymore.|`|YFPMcHCbaa	OMG I absolutely agree with you!! I'm so sick of that...I've spent most of today posting in those annoying "could I be pregnant" questions, giving people a list of websites.     Telling a bunch of strangers about your cycle and when you had sex will NOT tell you if you are pregnant! Take a test or go to the doctor for crying out loud.
Fh4B88ZGaa	No, because her body does not release the hormones that cause ovulation.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	No. Your body stops sending eggs down when you're pregnant so no, there is no ovulation.|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	No. We ovulate to get pregnant, so our body releases the egg.|`|LiPoEBenaa	No, you don't ovulate while your pregnant. The hormones that are produced during pregnancy stop the ovulation cycle :)  Hope this helps!|`|98WKYtfwaa	No, your body releases eggs in order for you to conceive. When you fall pregnant your body stops releasing eggs.|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	You don't ovulate during pregnancy because your horomones don't trigger the egg to mature or release|`|qhINFhGEaa	No.|`|pjgMW6qaaa	no
9kPPmazoaa	Its so weird that you are having this experience with Dr. Browns bottles. Is this happening with all the bottles you have for him? Or just a few?     Its weird because I always read people complaining that they leak. But I have never had that problem. Did they always leak... or is this something they just started doing. If in the beginning they weren't leaking its possible that through sterilizing them and constant use some parts have become warped, and you may need to replace some pieces.    Also are you following ALL the directions that came with the packet. Dr. Browns bottles have soooo many guidelines to using them. And if you don't follow them very carefully it throws the whole system off. If your warming it "with" the tube in thats probably the problem. You have to take everything out...to warm the bottle.    If your doing EVERYTHING the way its supposed to be done. Its very possible that you just bought a bad batch of Dr. Browns bottles.    I just recently switched my daughter from dropins to dr browns. And I love the bottles. Before switching to them she would have to wear a bib when eating because the milk would go everywhere. So I've had the opposite reaction to the bottles.    Question... After you prepare his bottle, are you checking it to see if its actually leaking.... Or is it just flowing all over the place when hes eating. Because it may not actually be the bottle leaking but him just not having a good latch on to the bottle. With my daughter the milk would go everywhere when she was drinking. I thought she was just a sloppy eater. Because the dropins weren't leaking themselves... But then I decided to try dr browns to see if it changes and she doesn't make a mess anymore!!! Nothing ever comes dribbling out of her mouth like it use to. So it turns out it was just the nipple that was causing the problem. She just couldn't get a good latch on it.|`|wKYdIaZVaa	I don't know how much you're feeding your son, but often times the bottle will leak if its filled bast the capacity. (whether it be the 4 or 8oz bottles). Also, I've found that loosening the cap sometimes makes the problem worse. Have you tried heating up the bottle without the tube in it? You can always put the tube back inside after heating...    Hope this helps... If the problem continues, I'd contact the company! Best of luck!|`|XOtHsTo0aa	I would warm it without the tube in.  Thats what I do and I don't think I've ever had a problem with them leaking at all.
uMIvRRjoaa	Ermm... I wouldn't be marrying anybody who disagrees with something so vital to my child's health. He sounds like he seriously needs counseling- he's sickened by a baby being fed, and he's overly possessive of YOUR body parts. I'm not sure there's anything you can say to change his mind, and more importantly, even if he "allows" it, he won't be giving you the support that is *so* vital those first few weeks.|`|gvLjbVFJaa	Your boyfriend sounds like a total moron. Seriously.    He wants to punch a WOMAN who is naturally feeding a baby? He sounds like a total loser, and not father material. That should send up tons of RED flags right there. Do you really want someone who holds violent views like that to be a father of your children? Geez, if he would do that to a woman (or even speaks of doing that to a woman), what would he to do a small child?    Leave him for a REAL MAN, not a immature and jealous child with violent tendencies, you'll be a lot better off in the long run. And while you are at it, get on some birth control too.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	If you disagree this strongly about something so important don't have kids together! Really, fights about raising your kids will happen with almost anyone but you have to find someone who agrees with you on the important stuff if you want a chance for your relationship to work.|`|IkkYOehSaa	if a man is that selfish even with his own children then he shouldn't be a father. Find a new man honey cause this man is worthless. Don't even try and fix him. And don't wait and see if it changes. Do you really want to risk that it might not change and he is going to be that much of an *** when the baby is born, and by that time it will be too late? Seriously, don't have children with this man. Don't do that to your future kids.|`|bZWbwyn4aa	He sounds like quite a catch!!|`|1hciyvKdaa	For many years in the US bottle feeding was the norm, most women did not want the inconvience, and at that time there was no studies showing the benefits. Some men are squeemish. Its just something you too will have to work on. I wonder if this man would be able to have sex with you after you two have a child, he may be that sqeemish also. Men are dogs at all the wrong times arent they. Sorry to hear about this delima. Since your not pregnant wait some time before bringing it up. Maybe one of your friends husbands can be spoken to, to see if he knows whats going on and might be able to intervene?|`|cqgWkdPtaa	you could leave the situation for now BUT it sounds like its really bothering you so you should probably talk about it now. Tell him that as passionate he is about not breastfeeding that you are just as passionate about breastfeeding and giving your baby the best start in life etc and tell him all your reasons. Make sure he understands the cost etc and that it really upsets you that he doesn't want you to breastfeed (the most natural thing ever, as we ARE mammals!)     Tell him you don't want to argue but when the time comes that you hope he will at least give you a chance to try it out because relationships are all about compromise!     Anyway, once a baby comes along it'll be 2 against one, he doesn't want you to but you do and the baby will and its best for the bubs too. Try not to argue about it but, just let him know that you feel really hurt by all this|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I'm sorry, he sounds like a complete asshole.  Even if you weren't having a baby or breastfeeding, your breasts do not "belong to him."  They belong to *you*.|`|jh9iPYvXaa	This is a controlling, domineering man, and not a good candidate for a long-term relationship. You should seriously consider giving back the ring.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	First of all why would you want to even have a baby with this man. Seems like he needs some growing up to do. He seems pretty selfish to me. You don't need to deal with someone like that. If he's a jealous person getting jealous about sharing your boobs with his child seems alittle crazy to me. Not worth your time honey. Good luck.|`|rAkWoweOaa	If you love him enough to make a baby with him. You need to take his feelings into consideration. The way he is acting should give you some insight as to what kind of person he really is. If he is already giving you ultimatums, what will it be like when you have the baby?|`|nF9DZ0sOaa	Ummmm...I think you need to re-evaluate your "fiance" before you get to the marriage and baby stages.  This guy apparently has serious control issues, especially if he considers that your breasts "belong" to him.    If he can threaten to leave you over something as natural as breastfeeding, he has serious issues that you don't want to have to deal with when the day comes.    Think about this veeerrrrryyyyyy carefully...|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	That seems a bit extreme--has he considered seeing a therapist? He's attached too much of a sexual connotation to your breast, even though when you get right down to it, there's nothing sexual about breasts. They're just a functional way of bringing nutrition to your baby--and definitely the best way. Have you told him about all the GOOD reasons, for both you and the baby, to breastfeed? He really needs to get over himself and stop being so selfish.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	If you want children, leave him.  That boy should never procreate.|`|GDobAMQ8aa	Wow.  I'd be very wary of someone who has actually said that your breasts only "belong to him".  That is just messed up.  Your body is your body first, and your breasts are there are a food source; men just happened to enjoy the pleasing appearance as a secondary, sexual thing.    If he's threatening to leave you because you want to actually take care of your baby in the way nature intended, then I'd consider just leaving him.  He may come around about it, but if he reacted this way about it (even before you being pregnant) now, I wouldn't expect him to change.|`|kG9oI68eaa	when you get pregnant and are having your baby no husband is going to deny a little beautiful baby of his own his breast milk|`|LMkj8D8eaa	once the situation is really here, and you guys have to decide on everything, his attitude should change...      especially when he finds out how much that powdered **** costs!|`|4u82OXgaaa	you have just as much right as he does. its your baby and this isnt totally right of him. you guys should see a marriage or realationship counseller.|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	the best advice i can give you is dont have children with him  he is too controling. dont do it.|`|W0gMQVoDaa	well im sorry but don't have a baby with this man because that is just ridiculous! i didn't breastfeed my 3 children but he should never say he will leave you if you do it xx|`|EeGgovyCaa	There's not something wrong with that, there's everything wrong with that. He sounds like a freaking psyco and I would seriously think twice of having any kids with him.|`|caA35sD5aa	I think you shouldnt have kids with him ever! There is seriously something wrong with him if he sees your breasts as his rather than a babies food supply-his own babies food supply! How anyone could possibly be jealous of a newborn baby feeding is just ludicrous! I wouldnt bother trying to convince him.. think about it seriously if you could have children with someone that feels that way.|`|94106f122aa0859301482207e00eda9caa	Get rid of him now before you ever bring a child into just a juvenile relationship. He shouldn't be in charge of how you decide to feed your child.|`|sAhAEC2qaa	just don't worry about it for now. don't agree but let it go until you actually DO get pregnant. this may be years down the road and your fiance will probley grow up by then and change his mind.|`|57838e5ad5a092a1d8a90da60915da82aa	This doesn't sound like a man I'd choose to have a baby with.
Qydtjz2naa	I don't either! It's 7:22 and my carpool should be here soon.  I have the two teachers I hate most today!  I'm so tired.

It's not because I can't get in - I'm close enough to walk (as is the headmistress) but the problems arise that we're the only to teachers who can get in.    So I had to go in in the morning, to tell parents to go home (despite information on our website and council websites - radio broadcasts etc they still try and get their kids in the building),,, after that, I got to go home, get a nice blaze going in my fire place, and snuggle up with my cat.|`|vI6tzF7baa	i dont have to go today!!!!!!!!!!! :)      they just called it off due to snow and black ice!!|`|i2yM0T9Paa	I have strep.

My teacher sent an email to us all that he might not be coming this morning since he is still feeling "off" and I am anxiously awaiting a response from him on the class cancellations page to see if he will cancel! Class starts at 8 AM...
EHY3FnAmaa	I believe so. I was just wondering this the other day because we plan to have a second kid and I will keep his bottles. They run at 9.00 for ONE.|`|d1csiCLKaa	If it is just the plastic piece of the bottle then yes you can keep them for that long, Just buy new teats for the bottles when you gave the next baby.|`|0VHolTVEaa	I dont think thats a problem as long as they are not stratched or damaged. You cant reuse the teats so its good you threw those away. If you dont want to keep them that long ask family or freinds if they need them then you can purchase new ones in 4 years time|`|sw2R5A9iaa	wash in warm soapy water, dry well, and store just like you do with your other dishes.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	I don't think it a problem make sure they stay clean and fresh. Keep them away from dust also.|`|sAhAEC2qaa	yes its plastic so they will be fine. not the nipples though|`|qayCggxMaa	I'm not sure, but I didn't think saving plastic bottles for the next child was a good idea.  They get worn with use and the plastic degrades over time and I worried about their safety.  Plus, plastic bottles just aren't very expensive, so it was worth the little bit of money to buy new ones when it was time.  Now, if you are using glass bottles I think that would be fine to save them and use them later.
Kxwyy0Eaaa	I couldn't stand the thought of using disposables when we did and we just have one girl who is 16 months. We used disposable for the first three months. I HATED and LOATHED (two words I don't use freely or often) the thought of knowin that they were made with chemicals, petroleum (yep, the same stuff from which gas comes; most plastics are made with it, too), and really, God knows what (and probably stuff God didn't naturally make), were only being used once, and then dropped in a landfill (or worse, a body of water) to leech chemicals into the soil and water for all eternity. I also didn't like the message I was sending-- Being "green" is part of who I am. (I was "green" and raised "green" before it was even a pop culture adjective.) The main reason I became vegan was because of what factory farming does to the environment. Yet, I'm using disposable diapers. For what? Laziness? Unwillingness to show good examples to my daughter? It worked out that my husband would do the laundry at night when he was up studying. Now, we both do it when we have a few minutes. (He's a pastor, and works in his church office in the mornings and goes on calls and visits and meetings in the afternoon.) He still likes to stay up at night to get work done, so he will do it then, too.    I don't know how much money we saved in the past 12 months or so, even with the start up costs. I'm quite sure it's in the hudreds of dollars.     If we have twins the next time around, we will buy more cloth diapers. Also, by the next child, my daughter might be old enough to help some, even if it's "just" folding diapers and putting them away.     Essentially, we stared with G Diapers. They were nice, but still pricey. My husband got the idea to put in the pre-fold diapers in them. We fold them into the rectangle and then under in the front. We started out with several of the pre-folds that we got for free. (Gifts to be used for burp cloths [we used old towels and rags for that], ones that my mother found when people left thigns behind in rental stoage garages, houses and apartments [she manages properties], etc. Some of the new packages were bought with gift cards.) Even with what we actually bought out of pocket and buying new G Diapers start packages, we've still saved money. Even with detergent.     We also have some all-in-ones that we bought through Craigs List that we use overnight because they are heavier and hold leaks better. (If she leaks we just hang the one of five outisdes up to dry and put on a clean one.)     On rare occasions we do use disposables from a package we bought from Whole Foods. That's only when all the outsides need to be washed or we leave our daughter with our MIL. (We've explained the system to her, but she doesn't quite get it. The last time I left our daughter with my MIL, I put together some diapers for her and some all-in-ones to avoid using a disposable.)     The Mothering magazine site has a cloth diapering section on its boards.     That being said, we have decided that we will try to not have two children in diapers at the same time, unless we have twins. Theoretically, by then, our daughter might be old enough to help out, too. And there are plenty of capable, older women in our congregation who would come over and help, just for the pleasure of  helping.|`|AykczQleaa	Easier- disposable  Cost effective - cloth    I don't know of any websites, but I do know that when my sister and I were born, my grandma paid for a diaper service to come weekly and pick up the diapers from my house for my mother because she didn't want my mom using disposable diapers on us.|`|XOtHsTo0aa	I am also a mom of twins.  My boys are almost 10 years old.  When they were little laundry was an immense job.  I considered using clothe with them because it would've been very cost effective but disposables were just plain easier for us.  There was no diaper service in our area.  With twins sometimes you just have to go with what is easier!!!  Good Luck!!|`|jptqo3Ljaa	easyer is disposables but cost effective is cloth and its better for the enviroment 2. u have to take te good with the bad im affraid|`|AA10529334	Honestly if you are having multiples -- use disposable. You are not gonna have a lot of extra time to rinse, wash and dry diapers.    I think cloth is less expensive but much more work.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	for me disposable.  I always look out for specials.  The laundry of their clothes in it self is a big job.  I have twins and the thought of cleaning 24 nappies a day was a big no no.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	There's lots of info at the list below, mostly personal stories.    There's also a yahoo group for attachment parenting multiples (breastfeeding is very common among attachment parents, though not all do)    From the moms I know its easier to nurse twins than to bottle feed them.  You can easily, once you learn how of course, breastfeed two at the same time.  More than two gets a bit more complicated as you only have two breasts -but then again you only have two hands as well.    Links: Breastfeeding Multiples  http://www.kellymom.com/bf/start/basics/...|`|gQpKeJ5laa	We have four boys who all breast fed, we pumped and went on to formula.  The more you pump the more you'll produce. You can even freeze the breast milk. If the baby falls asleep on the breast, either wake 'em up to finish off the hind milk, or pump off the rest.  Breast milk is the absolute best fluid for your child. Way better than formula can ever be.  As far as taking supplements - stick to a healthy diet. I suppose you could take a supplement.  The best consultants were friends.   We used both types of pumps, manual suction, and the motorized one.  It's good to help the flow of the milk by helping it along while the baby is drinking (especially at first) - you can do this by stroking the breast from the top to the nipple gently.   hope it helps.  We never breast fed longer than a yr.|`|5DybnUhBaa	ummmm i'm not a mom(a teen) but my mom goes on this parent website about feeding few years ago.  just telling you...|`|HVcpHT3aaa	I don't know what you've been reading, but formula is not bad. Plenty of kids were fed formula and are doing perfectly fine, mentally and physically. But yes, there are moms who believe breast is the only way a baby should be fed and if you are one of them, good luck with that!|`|H7BJxgCEaa	i am a mom of twins i breast feed excukicly for only a month.  I then started suplimenting with formula because i couldnt keep up but a little is better than none as far as the health factor plus the time you get to bond with them is awsome so i did both.
reO9Dgmsaa	Moby wrap or Babyhawk mei tai!!!!!!!!  They are both fantastic and versatile, and easily carry up to 35-40 lbs!  :)  I love mine, though Sophie won't really let me wear her anymore; she is so darn independent these days LOL!  **The BH is pricey, but I got mine used for 2/3 the price on EBAY!  YEAH!  Works great!      Edit:  Yeah MamaBear, the Moby is VERY nice.  It can be wrapped in many ways (cradle, front facing in/out, back carry, hip, even twin holds!), and the wide fabric spreads all the weight out evenly.  I can wear my nearly 30 lb toddler in it quite easily.  :)  You just have to practice each hold a couple times to get the hang of it.|`|OT1VzqyYaa	i liked the ones made by baby bjorn. Someone gave me one that had a back brace that was awesome.|`|AA10615926	I would either get a wrap or a mei tai.  They both distribute the weight evenly and are both very comfortable.|`|dAQHWvY0aa	HAHA - I think I know who your thumb-er is... Talk to Becks and Noah's mommy - I think they have the same one!   I have an up mama sling, and I can't seem to work it out right, either - I think you should check into the moby wraps - They look REALLY comfy, and maybe the weight will distribute a little more evenly? I hate my shoulders and my back getting thrown out of alignment - Babies are heavy enough without awkward posture!|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Oh, no I don't know what to recommend if you can't order it. I love Sleepy Wrap and my Over the Shoulder Baby Holder. Sorry I couldn't help more. What sort of sling did you have just out of curiosity? I had one that did what you said and pushed his head down but my Over the Shoulder... one worked great for nursing and never did that.|`|vOomJtbsaa	I had the same problem with my sons baby carrier, it always left my back hurting miserably afterward, and putting it on was seriously a two man job.  I needed some one to clip the strap around my back in order to get it on right, it was just stupid.   The Moby wraps are amazing, and they pretty much act as carriers or slings.  I think that you can go to stores like Babies R us (provided there's one in your area) and they have samples you can try on, put the baby in and see if it works for you.  Bjorn is supposed to be one of the best too, however they run pretty pricey.    Edit*  Bring it on thumbs down fairy, I will find you!!|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	I'm not sure which carrier you currently have, but I loved our Baby Bjorn. We would take our son in walks for it all the time.|`|AA11981363	Invest in an Ergo, they even carry an insert for infants now, so it works well for infants and toddlers. I highly recommend it.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	save your money and visit the nearest sporting goods store.  invest in a backpack -take the babe & try them on.  you'll feel much more comfortable, your body won't ache from the awkward position of a front pack, and the babe can stay in it for a longer period of time.
uhj76Fkpaa	baby milk shouldn't be given to the baby after 1 hour.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	breastmilk can stay out of the fridge for up to 8 hours|`|68c6B8dRaa	http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/milks...|`|RcHO6d3Eaa	Yes, you can leave milk out of the fridge to get warm.   As long as it's not over 25 deg C outside the fridge you can keep it at room temperature for 4-8 hours.|`|J6IOqzL0aa	thats fine breast milk is good for 4 hours outside of the fridge. ir alternatively you can run the bottle under some warn water if you need it heated up faster.|`|nzgZR6onaa	I wouldn't let it sit out to long I would sit it in a pot of extremely warm water but do not heat it on a stove with boiling water as this destroys precious much needed nutrients.|`|7M8Pf378aa	Please don't leave your breast milk out to "warm up" that is the easiest way for bacteria to grow in the milk and the longest way to warm it up as well, you need to heat it up quicker by putting it in a jug or something like that with hot water and just test every now and again until its the desired temperature
35d48c68a50cb76f01fce1bc599e0953aa	oooh ! that's a tuff one . I couldn't do it..a six months old she still drinks a bottle,right ? so why take the soother away now ? what is it hurting for her to have it ? I think it's too early for that. maybe at one when you take her off the bottle is a better time.|`|68c6B8dRaa	If you had to start using a dummy, you need to see it through; this was a pretty predictable result; no, you don't just leave her to sob alone.    http://www.truemomconfessions.com/confes...    "Instead of letting infants cry, American parents should keep their babies close, console them when they cry, and bring them to bed with them, where they'll feel safe, according to Michael L. Commons and Patrice M. Miller, researchers at the Medical School's Department of Psychiatry.    The pair examined childrearing practices here and in other cultures and say the widespread American practice of putting babies in separate beds -- even separate rooms -- and not responding quickly to their cries may lead to incidents of post-traumatic stress and panic disorders when these children reach adulthood.    The early stress resulting from separation causes changes in infant brains that makes future adults more susceptible to stress in their lives, say Commons and Miller.    "Parents should recognize that having their babies cry unnecessarily harms the baby permanently," Commons said. "It changes the nervous system so they're overly sensitive to future trauma.""    http://www.hno.harvard.edu/gazette/1998/...|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	You may have too if you don't want her to be so dependent on it anymore. Have you tried soft music? Something else that will help sooth her and take the place of it? Trying a bath before bed?|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	Certainly not!|`|Rlm7VjeEaa	She will cry herself to sleep eventually. Don't worry. This is a common problem. It's something you'll probably encounter plenty of times. Like weening her from the bottle, for example. It's just a part of the routine. Don't worry about it so much ^ ^|`|CY8jAXPDaa	I actually agree with 'Do your own thinking'  You start using a soother, you should definitely see it through.  Taking it from a 6mos old is still a little young to wean her from it.  I definitely would NOT leave her to sob without it, this is your doing so don't make her suffer in the long run, just because you decided to take something from her, that you gave her in the first place.|`|U3prt8tlaa	My doctor said you don't let them cry themselves to sleep until they are at least 10 months old, not younger.|`|BPoZPvGoaa	try letting her sleep on her stomach.  Although some do not recommend that but if she is sleeping with you.  You could put her on your stomach to her stomach and see if your heart beat will sooth her enough to sleep through the night.|`|K2QwEM4raa	She is just a normal baby that will outgrow this. Sometime nothing seems to work, happens to almost everyone.  Just do your best to make sure she is safe, dry and fed. Good luck, it will get easy-er as time goes by.|`|7E37G0SGaa	Give her back the soother. She is only 6 months.|`|BgVh5G36aa	Please don't sleep with your daughter, I'm a paramedic and have seen too often the end result of that.  Taking the easy way out, as I have done with my 11 month old daughter, I put 5-6 soothers in with her at bed time.  That way when she wakes up, they're easier for her to find.  We started doing this around 9 months and slowly she's weaning herself off of the pacifier, and I'm sleeping all night.  We tried to let her cry herself to sleep as well, but after a couple of nights of crying longer than 30 minutes, we just felt too guilty to not give her a pacifier.  I'm not judging your parenting skills, it seems you love your daughter, but personally I think 6 months might be too early to get rid of the pacifier.|`|BcjFssaEaa	its a pesonal choice, pesonally i dont let my daughter cry herself 2 sleep, but then again, i  dont need 2 let herself cry but if she does cry i leave her 4 like upto 5min n that it my daughter 6 month 2.  its up 2 u if u can cope with the crying  xxxx  best of luck xx
AA11220327	my prenatal appointments are a family event lol. When i was pregnant with my 2nd, my older one always came with me, and now that we are having  3 we all go, the only time my oldest misses it is if she is at school, but we use midwives, and it is very "family centered care" and there are lots of toys and books for kids, and kids are very welcome and invited|`|iCvG9kHqaa	Yeah I take my daughter, she's 1 at the moment but we don't have much choice. Who ever I go with with comes in to the doctor's office with me and occasionally that means we have 2 bubs in there. She'll be there for the US too and was there when I had my first scan.|`|xy5UNiELaa	I'm in the same situation.  My son has gone to all of my appts with me.  Dad missed one, but my son still came along.  I would say just make sure you have toys and snacks to keep your 1st occupied.  Luckily for us, my son is very well behaved :)  I think for my son, it has helped him understand the concept of a "new baby" joining our family.  He thought it was neat to hear the heartbeat and he loves seeing his little sister on ultrasound.  I think it will definitely help your little one bond with the baby...if she's old enough to understand.  I say take her and see what happens!  Congrats and good luck!|`|GgrNdDxVaa	I've thought about this too and i think i will take my first along for certain appointments only so that he feels involved (like hearing the heartbeat and ultrasounds) wont take him when they have to do paps or anything like that|`|0do2ixtWaa	Hello :)    I have a 6 year old boy and I bring him to my appointments if it is not on a school day, he is super excited to be coming.. he gets to hear the heat beat of the baby and the doctor lets him put the doppler on my belly.. I think it is a great way to prepare you child that another one is on the way. He came to ultrasounds with me and was very good about it.. I let him take the pic and carry it out so that he feels apart of this process so that he doesn't have any kind of hostility towards his baby sister! I think that you should bring your daughter to the appointment so that she isn't left out in the wonderful experience!|`|PwhrTNZraa	I haven't taken my daughter along yet, she usually stays home with nana.  My hubby doesn't come to my appts either because he has to work.  With my first pregnancy I made it imperative he come to the first ultrasound but that was it.  This time around, I'll probably take my daughter (3 1/2) with me after I've had the ultrasound (in 3 weeks), so she can hear the heartbeat herself, otherwise, I just leave her at home unless I have no other options.  I don't know if she'll understand the heartbeat, but she keeps wanting to "see" her baby brother/sister and lifts my shirt to see my tummy, so maybe she'll get it lol, we'll see!|`|dAQHWvY0aa	Every time! But we had a midwife, not a doctor so there was little to no risk of contracting anything - I don't take my baby, either of them actually, into a doctor office unless they are already sick. I would prefer to not expose them at this very tender age to unnecessary germs -- It's hard enough to keep the oldest ones feet on the ground, let alone his hands and mouth off inanimate objects, like chairs, toys, magazines... lol|`|AA11210211	I always took my son to my prenatal app.'s when I was pregnant with my daughter,I had no one to watch him so I had no other choice.|`|JP2h62qiaa	I WISH I was pregnant. When I was pregnant with hunter and went to the doctor, there was always little kids in there with their mothers. Totally natural.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	with my first my husband came to some of my appointments, my second he rarely did ( except the ultrasound etc) because he was watching the first. I did take him in few times but only when there were no internal exams. He was about 2 1/2 and most of the times screamed thru the entire appointment. ( he was really scared of dr's for some reason)   For my third my husband came with me three times, twice we had a friend watch the others, once he stayd in the waiting room with them. I took both of them with me twice ( they were 4 and 16 mos ) and other times my friend watched them.   I always saw kids there too and I asked my dr if they would mind if I brought mine because I had no one to watch them and they said of course not. They understand you might not have someone to watch them all the time|`|UYfqzCoMaa	When I was pregnant with my second I brought my first with me so she could listen to the heartbeat and know that everything was ok with the baby. If they had to do anything below the waist at my appointments my husband took her out of the room. I did the same when I was pregnant with my third. They loved hearing the heart beat and that helped comfort them as well that their baby sister was ok and growing just fine.|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	Well yes. My husband went to each appointment the first time around, and now that I'm pregnant with  2, him and our son come. It's really no big deal. The baby is even allowed to come in the room when I get ultrasounds. We bring little toys and snacks for him and if he gets cranky, daddy just leaves the room for a minute to calm him down. That's rare though and the doctors don't mind. They love seeing him and making a fuss over him lol. For my next appointment they'll be doing the strep b test so my husband may choose to come in with him or just stay in the waiting room. Either one is fine. Hope my answer helped =) **BABY DUST**|`|MtOSX19Haa	I work two jobs, my husband stays at home and just had back surgery in November.  I am almost 39 weeks with my second baby.  I have had to take my 5 year old step-daughter and my 2 1/2 year old son with me to many of my appointments.  My husband was either not willing to watch them or had to "rest his back" and was unwilling to go with me.  I didn't have much choice but to take them with me.  Most of my appointments only lasted around 15 minutes anyways.  I don't think it is detrimental to either of them and it does help them understand that there really is a baby growing in mommy's belly.  All my doctor has ever really done is measure my belly and listen to the heartbeat anyways.  The one time I had to have an exam I made him go with me.  During the ultrasound they were bouncing off the walls wanting to see the baby, but because they couldn't tell what it was they lost interest very quickly.|`|DNygQdmVaa	when i was pregnant with my 2nd ( i miscarried) i only brough my son when i had to, he was only 11 months old though,    He went once when i had my u/s.    theres nothing wrong with it if you want to bring your little girl
xeS8pUfbaa	hmmm that's a hard one im not really sure how to answer this. im pretty sure your baby didn't shrink.. maybe the second tech just measured differently. i would go with the first ultrasounds results because its easier to under measure then over measure in early pregnancy. they should defiantly not be off by more then 4 days in early pregnancy [before 10 weeks]    i had one at 5 weeks 6 days 10 weeks 1 day and 19 weeks 6 days they all matched up perfect    EDIT:  its not normal to be up to 3 weeks off. TWO weeks is the absolute maximum and that is for in LATE pregnancy [after 24 weeks]|`|LiPoEBenaa	It's fine. My whole pregnancy I measured 2wks bigger than I should. It's normal in a pregnancy to measure up to +/-3wks before the doctors will order another ultrasound or do any testing to get an exact fetal age. Good luck and congrats on your pregnancy!
fbZ2kYoHaa	I think it would be better to wait until s/he will remember...unless you have the money to be able to do a world trip later on too.    I say this because I love traveling and I would be upset if my parents traveled with me when I was too young to remember. :)|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Go for it.  Obviously it will have its tough aspects, but I mean, I have a friend who spent his babyhood on a yacht off the coast of Africa.  And another friend whose parents were missionaries and traveled all over with her and her like, 16 brothers and sisters.  Anything is possible if you're willing to do the work to make it happen.|`|bc5jGZ0uaa	I wish I could do that!!  Good luck!!
TLNQZ63baa	Have you ever seen the movie HAPPY FEET?  Your baby will be all dancing like that.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	If you arent having any pains and the baby is still moving like normal I wouldnt be worried but if you are just call your doctor and make sure. Good luck it wont be much longer.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I wouldn't worry too much. If you feel fine and the baby is moving then they will tell you not to worry. You have enough cushion now to protect your little one.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	sounds like baby is fine but if your concerned see your gp.|`|a9LgRjb3aa	you are probably fine but if it will help u not to worry so much then call the doc and see what he says. good luck|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Sounds like your baby is fine. If there was a problem you would have noticed it buy now. I fell at my baby shower and sprained my ankle and landed in a funny way. After I fell I started to have contractions I was about 32 weeks at the time. We went to the hospital and buy the time that I got there they had stopped. With me it happened only a few minutes after I had fallen. Just keep an eye out for anything that isn't normal any spotting or anything and I would call your doctor right away.|`|RZr1Esi4aa	No id say you were okay,might be a good idea to get checked out just incase,just to put your mind at ease|`|qhINFhGEaa	You should call your doctor after any slip and fall (it may just give you a piece of mind). I had one bad slip on ice during my pregnancy but since i had no cramping, pains, or fluid leakage, my doctor didn't think i should be concerned enough for them to do fetal monitoring or anything like that. Usually they worry about preterm birth, but at 39 weeks, you don't have to worry about the baby coming early! Your baby is safer than you think in your tummy.    Good Luck!|`|hWe8vhKKaa	just get yourself checked out to be on the safe side.but hopefully its all good.good luck.
jrVlzffeaa	If anything you would just be 7weeks shorter than what you're supposed to be, but I heard that premature babies catch up so I wouldn't worry about it, it may just be your dad's genes, you have to be at least as tall as your mum and you're only 16 so you've still got plenty of time to grow. My mum is 5 ft 11", my dad is roughly the same but my mum's dad was 6ft 5". I am 5ft 6", my older brother is about 5ft 11", and our little brother who's only 14 years old is 6ft 4" ands till growing!! So it's different for everyone Xx|`|gx4s68s8aa	I don't think being premature has anything to do with height.  And you are only 16 many guy grow until they are 18 or even older.   I have heard of guys growing 3 inches or so when they are between the ages of 18 and 21.  So until you are at least 20 you will really not know how tall you will be.  Your brother might grow a lot in the next several years or he might just grow a little.  It is really too hard to tell how tall either of you will be at this point.    Girls are different- basically we get our height by the time we are about 16 year old.
dzyJw0cvaa	Well, pregnancy IS a scary thing!!  Its a difficult journey, but for some the first pregnancy is easier simply because everything is new and exciting!  I for one am the kind of person where if i know how badly something is going to suck, it will be much worse.  My first pregnancy was also easier and more exciting, like you explained.    And much to some second time mother's chagrin, every pregnancy is different.  Even emotionally!!  Maybe you have a little boy in you and the hormones are different in your body.  Thats the way it was for me!  my first was a lot easier than my second and i think it was because i was having a boy the second time!!    But just becuase you have already had a baby, doesnt mean its all the same and you should know what to expect.  Having another baby while  having another little one toodling around is different for you AND your daughter and you might just be worried about being a good mom for them both.  Dont worry about giving your daughter everything she needs.  As long as she is fed, nutured and cared for, she will be just fine!!  Things are going to change, you are no longer going to be able to spend as much time with her as you used to and it might be saddening for you.  I know i had a hard time with it, but then i realized its all part of the cycle of having children.  however while time might be compromised, the love in your heart will NEVER be changed after having another one.  it is amazing that a mothers heart is able to hold room for ALL of her children just the same.  As long as you continue to let her know you love her and allow at least a little bit of time just for her each day, she will be ok and so will you!!    GOOD LUCK!  And congratulations!|`|OPTDFRuzaa	yes absolutly! i was stressing over it too when i was pregnant with my second who will be  a year this month. you may not tear this time and it may be a quicker labour although mine was not it was almost an hour longer but i can't complain had him at home with no drugs and he was nearly 8lbs! i was crying alot after he was born as i was scared how i would cope with 2! its hard at first until you get into a routine which i never got into till around 4months so i was cracking up! my hubby works alot too so was on my own alot. you need to give your daughter what she needs first before the new baby because then she will feel more valued. a baby can wait 5 mins till your toddler is satisfied but be warned if your toddler will be between 18 months and 2 years there may be some jelousy. good luck.|`|Y6xLu77aaa	I went through this with each pregnancy. I've been pregnant 6 times two which ended in miscarriage and the feelings you have are normal. I kept thinking how can love this baby as much as my daughter but it always turned out good. With each baby I had the more love I had to give. I know that sounds cheesy but it's true, I even make up excuses so they can stay home from school. They have given my husband and I so much joy|`|HEOyvmYFaa	i had the same feelings when i was pregnant with my second child. i thought how on earth am i going to have love for this child like i love my first child. and how am i going to take care of my son with another baby. but honestly those fears went away when i had my second child. yes things will be a bit more challenging for you, but you some how over come your fear when you get home and settle in with the new baby and rest of your family. good luck.|`|MkpXAHDLaa	Yes, that is all very normal!  I almost felt sad at times because my oldest would no longer have my undivided attention. But at the same time I was much more relaxed during my second pregnancy regarding the physical aspects because I knew what to expect.     The feelings you have are perfectly normal. And to tell you the truth, there is something more "magical" about your first, because it is just that, your firstborn child, so new and exciting.  After that I think we all come a little bit back down to one of the realities of child rearing - that it is a lot of work!!|`|IFDfpbFJaa	HAHA! When my son (3) goes into a melt down I look at my boyfriend and say "YOU SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN ME A PUPPY! I'M NOT READY FOR ANOTHER ONE!"    but I'm kidding with him. I'm scared too. I thought it was fun the first time picking all the bedroom stuff and bath toys and bouncers and all the clothes but now that I have more hands on experience I'm scared of how I'm going to deal with two children. How will I divide my time, can I love anything as much as my son, I know I won't love either more, but I'll always love my first son longer but have special memories with both. I can't wait yet I'm very scared.  My son is a VERY jealous child, We got a puppy just to see how he'd react (and cause I wanted a puppy) and he goes and lays in the dogs bed if I give the dog any attention and he'll push the dog off the couch and try to sit where it was sitting. At least I know what I'm in for though.    Good Luck with the baby! Congrats too!
x647LeB2aa	My first was born in 1997, my second in 2003 and my third 2008 so you can see I have had quite bit gaps :)    I kept and have used the following:    Baby bath  Cot  Bouncy chair  Moses Basket  Toys    I only kept a couple of favourite outfits as clothes date really quickly (and I had boy, girl, boy so there was over 10 years between my sons)    I got a new car seat for each - mainly because regulations changed and the more modern ones are also better quality and safer.    I kept my pushcahir from my first but ended up getting a new one for my daughter as the old one looked so dated and I chose a quinny zapp (small car so it was perfect)  I'm currently using this for number 2 son :)|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	It makes sense to save anything that you will reuse as long as you have the space to store it.  Any clothes that are in good condition with no stains, and any equipment (jumperoo, swing, bouncy seat, walker, high chair, stroller, car seat, etc) should be saved.  Also save your breast pump.  You can save the bottles if you really want to but they're so inexpensive it's easy to just replace them. Also, it's probably more sanitary to just buy and sterilize new bottles.  Definitely do not save the nipples or pacifiers.  They deteriorate over time and with much use.  It's safer and cleaner to buy new ones.  Just pack it all up and store it until baby  2 arrives.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I'd definitely get rid of the pacifiers.    I'm keeping clothes, his cot, some toys (jumperoo, swing, bumbo playgym, and he has other big fisher price "amazing animals" toys), a breastpump and steriliser would be useful to keep.      But bottles, teats, dummies I would throw away and buy new.|`|7bTOY5vHaa	I only saved the clothes that I really loved. Other than that I didnt save anything because I knew that I would want new stuff for my other children. Some people save just about everything. If you had to struggle to buy the things you have then dont sale them. And never save pacifiers or nipples.|`|rjVALevtaa	After my first son outgrew his baby stuff, I just kept the bigger unisex items like his crib, bassinet, baby gates and high chair. I also kept my breast pump. I'm really happy that I did considering we just had another baby about 5 months ago. I didn't save his pacis but if you have that many I would say that you should.     I probably would have saved more things if we hadn't moved across the country. Even if you're not planning on having a baby for another 5 years or so, it's a good idea to save some of the more expensive things. Especially if you have room to store them.|`|Bw18seFqaa	some things can be worth saving if stored properly..    things like nipples and pacifiers should be tossed when your baby is done with them..  rubber dry rots, and its just best to get new.    Some of your better clothing may be worth hanging on to, expecially uni-sex items.   The only downfall to storing baby clothes is that they spit up and spill milk or formula.. even tho you wash the clothes, the protiens are still in the fabric, and do slowly cause staining from being stored..  if you get the clothes out once a year or so to wash and re-pack they should be fine tho.  However its also not hard to get more clothing.. babies only need so much and they outgrow it..  people often also give you clothes.. and its easy to find gently used clothing.    Anything you hard a hard time getting money for, or paid quite a bit for, like the crib, jumpers, pump, car seats, playpen, etc would be worth hanging on to.|`|GqsLNUE8aa	I know it's hard to get rid of all the stuff ya just spent millions on but I had my kids 8 years apart and really no choice but to downsize constantly. I only kept a small bag of favorite things for sentimental value. When I was pregnant with my second it was like starting fresh and just as with my first I have more stuff for her now than I have room for. Stuff just...comes, between family and friends PLUS if you're having your kids that far apart you are totally entitled to another baby shower :) My opinion, don't save anything for your second, just save stuff you can't throw out that will always belong to your first.|`|YpgoGNuXaa	I would say save your breastpump, swing, walker, whatever toys were expensive or meaningful, and more if you have the storage for them. Sell the rest on ebay and spend it on a date with your hubby! =)
JQZDCcyQaa	I would prefer not to think about it. lol-too much I can tell you!  The set up is the most expensive just because I wanted her room to be perfect, but thats the intial cost, there is hardly any on going cost, only nappies really because shes breast fed and doesnt eat a whole lot of food|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Well my daughter is almost 3 weeks old, but with clothing, pushchair, car seat etc. i'd say about 500 odd already =/|`|cypZ0ykXaa	it all depends on the way of living & income of people. it does'nt match with anyone i guess.but, we tried to get almost everything   taht we can afford|`|BcjFssaEaa	well my daughter 6 month now from pregnancy up to now probably about 3k-5k including christmas n her room being done n all her clothes etc n equiptment xx
jsdDgIuRaa	We got both (we have the Rainforest Jumperoo and that same Exersaucer you are looking at)    Personally we have gotten more use out of the exersaucer.  My son outgrew the jumperoo and frankly got kind of bored in it after about 5 minutes.    The exersaucer he enjoyed more and has been able to use longer, he still goes in it sometimes.|`|nmu6coapaa	Well keep in mind that some of the rainforest stuff has been recalled. The other jumparoo looks good though    EDT: Yea the open top swing and the portable play yard! The swing was an entrapment hazard!|`|Ezkn5azdaa	Don't worry about the recall on the rainforest. I check that out friday. The only thing that was recalled was take along rainforest swing. I didn't see about the jumpers swing kind. you can check on line fisher price.com they would have it up there. Both of my boys loved to jump when they were a baby. I never had exercauscer.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	We have the jumperroo and LOVE it. Its actually only $80.99 at target.  the jumparoo has not been recalled. it was the travel swing and the play yard.|`|99ML0m2yaa	My 4 month old son LOVES his jumper!  Cries when I take him out of it!  I say jumper!|`|gGW7K9U5aa	The jumpers can hurt the babies knees from all the jumping, so I personally would get the exersaucer. My 8 month old has one and loves playing in it.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	We have the Rain Forest Jumperoo and Jacob loves it and could spend forever in it if I let him. If you are limited on space I'd get that!    He uses the same exersaucer where we nanny though and he loves that too...     get both if you can!
MtC3CWZraa	Im exactly 38 weeks today and for the last couple of weeks have been feeling all kinds of things including nausea that make me think I could be going into labor soon. Ive Googled signs of labor only to read over and over again that everything Im dealing with is totally normal and that theres really no dependable way to predict when labor will start.    At this point, I just keep reminding myself not to over-think anything just because I want this kid out.  I think most of us start notching every little twinge around this time solely due to wishful thinking that weve reached the end.

9PqAOQu1aa	1. How long did you breastfeed your baby before returning to work?  I went back when she was 6 weeks old.    2. After returning to work, what kind of pump do you use and how often do you pump? Is it effective with keeping up your milk supply?  Medela InStyle Advanced.  It's very expensive, but it works really well.    3. Since returning to work, has your child's caregiver had to supplement with formula for one or more feedings a day because your milk supply was not able to keep up with your baby's demands? How many feedings did he/she have to use formula?  I haven't had to give her formula ever.  She's 6 months old now.  There were a few times where it seem inevitable, but it never came to that.  I hated to think about supplement because it is a slippery slope to your milk drying up.  When your supply is low, you want them to eat and eat to help your supply go up.    4. Have you ever tried using something to increase your milk supply (such as herbs, drinking more liquids, etc.) what did you use and how effective was it?  I've tried oatmeal, fenugreek, Mother's Milk Tea.  I ate so much oatmeal that I started to gag when I ate it.    I eventually stopped the tricks and, once I chilled out and gave in to the fact that I may just have to give her formula, everything worked out.      I pump twice during the day at work, then once at night after she goes to sleep.  This gets me enough to keep up with what she's eating.      One thing I found was that I was making her bottles too big.  At six months old, she gets 3 oz. bottles.      At first, I was giving her 4oz. bottles because she would eat them.  But then my health nurse told me she should be getting 2 oz. at a time.  That seemed rather small, so I took it down to 3 oz. bottles and she did fine, didn't spit up as much and I was able to pump as much as she was eating.    This calculator is very handy to figure out how big of a bottle to make your child:  http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/milkc...|`|pjgMW6qaaa	i breastfed my baby for 3 months.  i started working when she was 7 weeks old and thanks to that i lost milk. I wasn't pumping as much as before so i started to give her formula as well which took me 2 weeks to get her used to because she would not drink it. At 3 months i just started to give her formula.|`|FRwxXGynaa	I breastfed my baby for 6 weeks before returning to work. I breastfeed in the evenings and weekends and pump while I'm at work. I use an Ameda Purely Yours pump (works great!) and I pump 3 times at work. My sitter occaisonally has to give my baby formula, more often now since she's getting older (almost 6 months). She drinks approx. 4 ounces of formula every day at the sitters because my milk supply couldn't keep up. I've tried using oatmeal to build the supply and it works wonders. I eat it every morning for breakfast! I am on my own for dinner most night so I don't get a "real" dinner. I think this is part of the problem for not producing enough.    If you are having problems producing enough, make sure you are drinking a lot of water and eating regular decent sized meals. Try to relax! Even if your baby has to have a little formula during the day, most of her feedings still come from breast milk. Good luck!|`|JYOfGBwqaa	I BF for 12 weeks before going back to work.    I used Medela Pump in style and pumped 2-3 times a day (3 if you can).    I went through a stressful period and my supply went down so we did have to give some formula which I was upset about.    I did take fenugreek and ate real oatmeal everyday for breakfast. It really helped too!
brVdhPYpaa	Hi there    I had the same problem with my two year old when we had a second child.      When our daughter came in the room I explained to her that she would have to go back to her own room now and that she could not sleep in mummy and daddy's bed.  I quietly took her back to her own room and put her back to bed.  If need be I sat with her for a few minutes until she fell asleep.     The first night we took her back to her own room - she threw a tantrum and screamed and shouted.  She came in about 10 times that night but we remained consistent and always took her straight back to her own room and put her back into bed.  The second night she came in about 3-4 times - again we put her back to bed gave her a cuddle and went back to bed.      On the third night she slept through the night and has stayed in her own room ever since (she is now three).     The key to this is that you both have to handle the situation in exactly the same way and be consistent.  If you let him sleep in your bed once he will see that he can get away with it and will try time and time again.  Always try to settle him in his own bed.      Be prepared though there will be a lot of tears for the first night or so.     Good Luck.|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	We had a similar problem, but a small lamp and leaving the door open with a hall light on seemed to help.  We let him "help" decide what he needed.  So he felt in charge of his own room.  He'll sometimes get up for a little while and look at his books.  But as long as he's relatively quiet and stays in his room, it's not a problem.  He usually gets back into his bed on his own in a reasonable amount of time.  So while he feels that he's controlling his bedtime, it's within the paramaters that we gave him.|`|Irdj2KAFaa	What seemed to work for my wife and I was a nite-light.  Of course with continued persistence, he stopped within 1 week.|`|vI0WnAiOaa	have your 'time together' when the baby is asleep and just deal with the fact that YOUR child doesnt want to be alone in the dark of night. this is normal and you need to learn to live with it.|`|heoBp6Taaa	Persistence, keep putting him back in his own bed, I'm having the same problem and I'm told keep putting him back is the key it's best to settle him back to sleep in his bed even if it means you lying in his bed with him (not let him go to sleep in your bed then put him in his bed) and hopefully he will eventually get it and stay in his bed.    Good luck.|`|krQiDGCHaa	You need to be persistent.  Don't listen to people who tell you to allow your son to sleep with you.  Once you start this pattern of behavior, it is EXTREMELY difficult to change.  You already started it, but the earlier you stop it the easier it will be.    Put your son to bed at night.  Tell him to go to sleep.  If he gets up in the middle of the night, put him back in his bed and say goodnight to him -- don't speak to him otherwise.  Go back to bed with your fiance and go to sleep.  If he gets up again, repeat the process.  Do it as many times as necessary until he stays in his bed.  You may be in for a few sleepless nights, but trust me, within a week he WILL be sleeping all night in his bed alone.    Another suggestion would be to get a nightlight for his room.  Maybe he's uncomfortable in the dark alone?  Also, a small fan or noise machine turned on for the duration of the night helps with background noise, which makes you sleep more soundly.  (My husband and I sleep with a fan on it our room for background noise.)|`|rISHTfK3aa	Firstly you need to stop going into the spare room and stay in your own bed. Secondly you and your partner need to stop your son from coming into your bed. if you don't do this things will only get worse.    Setup a new routine and stick with this. It will be very hard at first but if you persevere things will work out and your son will eventually stay in his own bed.

My recommendation is to go to some local mother and baby groups and ask the new mothers about their experiences.

It was nice.  I got to meet a lot of great doctors, all of who specialized more in one area or another.  It was great.  Maybe you should give them a shot.  Your family doctor probably thinks they're wonderful which is why they would refer you there.

5YPSyP91aa	she is a dingbat and whoever implanted the 8 embryos should have their license revoked.|`|Ezkn5azdaa	First of all the doctor shouldn't done that. because of her health. I be feeling bad for those children. All 6 of them are under 8 year old. They do have a bigger house. They staying in that 3 bedroom for privacy. And she not working. I hope the government turn her down getting welfare. Actually she was already getting welfare with her other children. She doesn't have anymore eggs to use after she used the last eight. Heard that from the radio yesterday. Also I heard that she doesn't care about her other kids or they babies at all. I don't know if that true. But I don't know how to they going to afford paying for those children. One of these days children service probably get involved and take the children away. But I really don't know. I know every one deserves to be a mother. But a single mother of 14 children that mental health issue. She should only have one or two with that kinda of mental health issue. They better take her uterus out before she thinks she needs more. She don't need anymore. Radio also thinking why she doing it is to get more money.|`|lxeGKjLbaa	Yes, it will be crowded won't it?

That's why we are having a financial crises today. People have lost the difference between wants and needs. I raised five kids in a four bedroom.And when my kids were little one room was used as a playroom. My four girls were in one room and I had two sets of bunk beds and my son in the other room It wasn't until my girls were older did we turn the playroom into another bedroom.They all turned out fine.And in older days it was even more cramped.Our neighbors raised five kids in a one bedroom.the kids slept on pallets on the floor.I'm not saying it will be easy but if they are raised with lots of love,happy and healthy and with the right morals that's better than a big house.|`|nsVbWXKraa	My grandparents had 18 children... 9boys and 9 girls, My father being the 6th child.... NO TWINS OR ANYTHING OF THE SORT,same parents everyone of them... They had 1 kitchen, 1 living room, 1 bathroom, 1 bedroom, and the boys slept outside under a hay shed.... this family will make do believe me... it isn't impossible and there are people who have had more children.... maybe not at once like 8 popping out but it isn't some miraculous thing...  AND LARGE FAMILIES ARE ACTUALLY CLOSER BECAUSE THAT IS ALL THEY HAVE!!! THERE IS LITTLE EXTRA MONEY TO DO ANYTHING SO UR STUCK WITH FAMILY MOST OF THE TIME AND U BECOME VERY VERY CLOSE!!!!|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	I think its crazy and ridiculous. No woman should be giving birth to litters of children at ne time.  If women were supposed to have litters of children they would have 8 nipples. But we aren't our bodies aren't ade to carry so many children. As for the house situation personally i don't think government or anyone else should step in to help them. They made a choice in how many children to have, now they have to live with it. I feel badly for the children in this situation not the parents.

Im sure people will tell you to drink castor oil but don't do that! believe me I did it with my first child because I was told it causes stomach contractions that cause diarrhea and that kick starts your labor but don't do it. My daughter was stressed, my labor lasted 2 days and she was covered in maconium (her fetal bowel movement) she ever swallowed a bunch of it and was in ICU.     I would just walk and try to have sex like I mentioned and nothing further. You do not want to stress the baby right now because things can go very bad once your in labor.|`|cPQ6lyk2aa	You can get an exercise ball and bounce on it.

Go your full term (40 weeks) and have the doctor induce labor if you have not dilated by then.        Having sex is not a good idea.  Yes, it may help dilate you but the chances of infecting the placenta inside of the uterus is high.  You really don't want anything up there this late in the pregnancy.      Be on the look out for your water breaking or your mucous plug coming out.    If you are a first timer, you need to go to the hospital when the start of you first contraction to the start of the second are 5 minutes apart.  If you are a second time mother go to the hospital when your contractions are 10 minutes apart|`|78043d7623806abc52846ed0777ee6fbaa	let ur body do its job and sex would be the best method.|`|Z5eaybI0aa	walking and sex
jrVlzffeaa	I have just read on a website that if you have high blood pressure that this can lead to an enlarged left ventricle and if they give manage to lower your BP with pills then your left ventricle will shrink, apparently. Good luck and keep us updated please Xx|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	I just googled it and it seemed at a glance that many times it is simply left along...your blood pressure may be monitored a lot...but as you are pregnant they will keep a much closer eye on you. Of course...I am not a doctor but having googled it I did not see anything that made it look particularly serious or life threatning....it seemed very complex as there can be many reasons...but I dont think you need to worry. I am sure you will be fine...|`|buCSvGB4aa	An enlarged left ventricle is usually due to either cardiomyopathy (a weakening of the heart muscle) or valvular heart disease.   In the heart, a ventricle is a heart chamber which collects blood from an atrium (another heart chamber that is smaller than a ventricle) and pumps it out of the heart.An enlarged heart may be caused by a thickening of the heart muscle because of increased workload. (This increased workload can be due to heart valve disease or high blood pressure, for example.) This is called hypertrophy (hi-PER'tro-fe), which refers to enlargement of an organ or tissue due to an increase in cell size.Initial treatment is with medications, such as diuretics, digitalis, vasodilators (ACE inhibitors and/or ARB inhibitors), and beta blockers, such as carvedilol (Coreg) or metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL). In more severe cases special pacemakers or defibrillators are used. Only in the most difficult cases are heart transplants occasionally required.|`|5YPSyP91aa	prob caused an arrythmia, and they want to see what kind of arrythmia, that's why they want to monitor you. a high pulse out of the blue is an arrythmia, possibly SVT, supra ventricular tachycardia... if you have a dangerous arrythmia, they will perhaps want to do an ablation to correct the problem in your heart. google it and read more about it...
CVdcrY3kaa	It's normal. Happens to me all the time. My daughter is 6mos, and I still leak at random times. In the shower, watching TV, just random things will make me squirt milk. Stock up on nursing pads and hang in there!|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	Mine never squirted but it leaked for the first few weeks.  Just wear a nursing pad.|`|hGqQIusSaa	I've never had that happen to me, but maybe you're engorged?  You may have an oversupply, but can always express it and store it!|`|SaRDq9iLaa	Been there!!  I know it's annoying but it will stop.  You are producing a lot of milk but your body will get use to the amount of milk you need to feed your baby and will only make what you need.  Supply and demand, the more you need the more you make, the less you need the less you make!|`|IngripgMaa	It could be because you are not nursing enough.  That happened to me, when I was ready to nurse.  It was a reminder that it was time.  It will also happen when you start weening the baby off.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Cause you're lucky and you have enough milk to feed a small army....!  Congrats!|`|s8SnVmXvaa	It'll stop doing that after a while.  There's a period of adjustment before your breasts start acting normal again... even if you continue to breastfeed for a long time.  In the meantime make sure you have a good supply of nursing pads, and change them often.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	You have lots of milk which is good~ Your baby is blessed by your milk! Mine comes out if I'm making lots of milk & if my baby's not eating enough. Sometimes it comes out when baby cries. My doctor told me that's normal.

If you go two weeks with no period, it's time to see your doctor!  Good luck!|`|bd206b850f2fec243858724c57950888aa	A blood test is most accurate.  When I was pregnant with my second child, although I had no positive pregnancy test, I absolutely knew I was pregnant, although I had NO symptoms (except for a missed period and mood swings).  Sometimes, you don't need a test to "just know."  I took test after test after test totaling 6 negative home pregnancy tests.  Frustrated, I headed to my GYN, who offered me yet ANOTHER urine pregnancy test (where a smaller amount of hormones would more likely be detected), but I asked for a blood test.  Two days later, I called back for my results and found out that I was indeed pregnant.  After 6 negative home pregnancy tests and over a month without seeing aunt flow, I finally got that positive I had been waiting for... I was nine weeks along, in fact!    Head to the doctor's office and demand a blood test for a sure result!  Good luck!|`|2jrffIoWaa	I'm in the same boat as you!  Have you taken another test yet?  I could not be more frustrated becuase I've never missed a period in my life.  This is our first month TTC and honestly, I would be OK not being pregnant - I just want to know what is going on with my body!  I am over 4 days late with lots of negative HPTs.  I have heard that sometimes for a first pregnancy, your body takes a little longer to produce what the tests are looking for (the hcg).  I'm hoping this is the case.    Good luck!

I think it takes personality and love to raise a child, not a ton of money.
miPubuDYaa	Just ask your landlord. Most will allow you to paint. They understand that you need to live there and enjoy living there. If you don't enjoy living there you will move and they lose a "paying customer". But every apt is different.    My last apt allowed us to paint any neutral color. neutral meant not neons or dark dark colors. But pinks and mustards where ok.    Our apt we have now we are allowed to paint any color we want. Darks, lights, any color - on the condition we must paint all the walls back to white when we leave. We are not allowed to put up wall paper or even a wall boarder cause it can damage the wall. My previous apt allowed us to have them.    My theme for my wedding shower was black & white and since we moved in there right before my wedding shower. We painted the bedroom dark charcoal gray (so the bedding set matched) and the kitchen light grey (all the appliance matched). My daughter room was Tinker Belle purple. The people dance stairs from us moved in the same week as we did. And we saw thier apt while it was getting painted. The landlord did the painting for them and it chocolate brown in the LR and blood red in the bedroom and neon pink in the childrens room.    Just ask your landlord what is exceptable or look in your lease. Just don't assume because you don't wanna have scarf you deposit to them when you leave. Also being pregnant you must stay away from the fumes of the paint. Have your hubby and best friend paint and go stay with a friend for a few days.|`|kzyEuRroaa	One thing I did when we lived in an apartment and couldn't paint was use neat pictures.  We were decorating with frogs, and I took a frog calendar and stuck the pictures to brightly colored matte board.  The pics were big, and I had a bunch of them so we tacked them up all around the room and it added color and interest to the room.  I have also hung fabric and quilts up to add something, or shelves and put neat things on there.|`|zwctZ812aa	At my apt we asked and they said sure, any color we want.  The condition was if they didn't like it, we had to paint it back to white when we moved.  We did a sage green and the landlord loves it.|`|T48smu01aa	sure why not!|`|i8Ch743Laa	Talk to your landlord,that's no reason to be depressed. At least you've got somewhere to live. And a room for your baby.  A lot of people don't have that.|`|MtC3CWZraa	Probably best to check with your apartment manager because you won't want to lose your whole security deposit over that.     There are other non permanent ways to change walls. If you Google, you can get directions for how to attached fabric to walls with laundry starch. The fabric can be easily peeled away later without damage.     You could also decorate with removable wall stickers. I've seen these in tons of stores.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	u can talk to your landlord. usually as long as its a light color they dont care,they just want to be able to cover it with white.|`|9FbcLKsfaa	We live in an apartment and we painted my lil girls room pink and the boys room blue the manager just wants us to paint it back when we move, check your rental agreement.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Ask your landlord.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hi em if your renting then no i dont think you will be allowed to unless you ask the landlord or owner. you can always put a nice border up and pics then it will look more homely for your baby.|`|Coc593Ikaa	I've lived in lots of apartments. All any of them ever cared about was that the walls were returned to their original color when you leave. But even if you don't repaint them when you leave, they'll just charge you a repainting fee.    So go ahead and paint the room whatever color you want! The general rule is if you are going to live there for more than 2 years, it is worth the effort!     Also, consider that you can hang up adorable baby blankets and such to take away from the starkness of the walls.|`|VEi3R0craa	yeah just don't tell the land lord you are doing it.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I know the feeling. Every corner of this apartment is white. It drives me crazy! I'm ready to get our house so I can fix his room and paint all my walls! Try the decals if you can't paint. It helps I promise.|`|jXmkVtXgaa	My question to you would be... How long do you plan to live there?  We lived in an apartment when our son was born, but with the intent that we would be in a house in a year.      I didn't want to paint twice!  I got my painting/nesting fix by painting special pictures I could then hung on the wall.  Or you could buy decals if you want something bigger and then take then with you!  i think it helped him get adjusted to to his new room when we moved to.    Now- as someone who used to work in a leasing office... we did allow people to have rooms professionally painted as long as they painted back or paid a fee to have us paint it back.  Rules vary by complex of course.|`|qhINFhGEaa	probably. just don't paint it a color that will be hard to pain back over.      you could also try wall decals instead of painting the walls.|`|P7Bu2I8eaa	who's your landlord here on "YAHOO ANSWER"... Cuz i'm pretty sure no 1 here is your landlord....     So what im trying to say is "ASK YOUR LANDLORD"...|`|MOsStEbqaa	You could try that but depends on the landlord you could get sued. Try asking him or her if you can paint the wall. If you can't try and move into a house that you can do that. Anywhere that your renting will more then likely have a problem with it. Just hang up a lot of things if you can't paint or move.|`|rctDnhO1aa	if you really want to know i'd ask you're landlord/lady but if you're thinking that he/she will say that you can't paint it then i would just do it and repaint when you leave, like anyone will notice plus you'll probably be doing them a favor with the upkeep. - Due in Aug|`|8q6OI9nlaa	Make sure your BF paints, Paint fumes are bad for preg ladies!|`|P37lIBr2aa	Usually your apartment will let you paint it whatever you want as long as you paint it back to the original color when you move out.   Don't worry too much about the white walls though, I've actually found some nursery ideas where white is ideal. Congratulations!
JnLoHaoAaa	It won't let me post the link but look at my questions and click on Matched or Mis-Matched? It was about nurseries and some ppl posted link to pictures of their child's nursery|`|EHY3FnAmaa	http://s102.photobucket.com/albums/m97/a...    http://s102.photobucket.com/albums/m97/a...      http://s102.photobucket.com/albums/m97/a...      We did the rainforest theme. We painted stripes on one wall. We live in an apartment we just have to be sure to paint it back white before we move!|`|hrMhhB4Saa	http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...|`|nYioXmnGaa	My oldest son room it animals he loves animals ! My youngest son is fire men  his daddy is a fire man ! My daughters is going to be  ballerinas i think !|`|OZ474DMYaa	i really dont have a pic but my son's room was yellow when we moved into our house and we just went with the yellow. his room is sports themed. At babies r us we found these things that you can stick on the wall and they dont do anything to the wall or the paint on the wall. i would suggest looking for something like that since you are in an apartment that way you can have your own touch but not having to worry about paint and trying to cover it up when you move. my whole nursery was about $500 with the crib included. I have a crib, changing table (which is also a dresser) and a recliner. Added all up it is that, since i didn't spend anything on paint and such. good luck.    you can also google nursery's in images and maybe get some ideas there.  http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...  here is what i was talking about with the stickers|`|mkdIy12caa	for cheap, DIY projects are great! my whole nursery was around 500 (i already had a crib)     my whole thing was very simple and understated but i did a BIG STATEMENT they were hand-painted wall letters 9 inches high. I got them at    http://web.me.com/brbjmich/rainbowsandlo...    it is an adorable online boutique called rainbows and lollipops and i only paid around 80 dollars for those huge and hand painted letters!!!! they came out sooo cute! good luck
dXVA1wHDaa	My son had good head control from a few weeks old.  But he started holding it up all the time at about 2 months.  Every baby's different though, it's hard to tell when to expect her to be able to do it.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	My son held his head up from day one but some babies don't fully do it until about 3 months. Basically, it just depends on your baby. She will do it in due time.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	My son was about 2 months old. He is now 3 months and his head is still a little wobbly. He tried really hard to hold it up though.|`|4ksa4lhWaa	3 months for my son.  Good any way.  He's now 5 months and can almost sit on his own|`|xszqbAFXaa	My son held his head up on the first day, but only for a moment. It may take a little while for some babies to begin crawling, walking, and talking and everything else.  Just be patiet he will get there.  My baby has progressed quickly in some things and he is probably behind in others.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	8 weeks old... but got the hang of it fully at 12 weeks.|`|nE7KqaSZaa	I think by 3 months they say the neck muscles are usually strong enough.  That being said every baby is different.  My daughter has been holding her head up since day one, unless she's tired, then that's the first thing to go.|`|AA11635130	my son was about 2-3 months and was good by 41/2 months|`|pjgMW6qaaa	my daughter was trying to hold her head up the day she was born.    she actually couldnt do it all that good till about 3 months. shes now 4 and does pretty well.    congrats on your baby :)|`|4ztXoIDKaa	My daughter isi 10wks old and hold her head really well.  She's been able to do it for a long time.
tapFZBowaa	Ummmm, no.  Put the baby in her crib.|`|EosXJmcmaa	Definitely in the crib!|`|MPc0kS1vaa	no. thats what the crib is for.|`|vj2a6LXMaa	No! Your baby should be in the crib! Why would you want the baby crawling everywhere? You need the baby in the crib and baby monitors on so you can hear if the baby needs out!|`|a86IJoFjaa	Is this a real question?    The answer is no.|`|jTkJbTc6aa	you know they dont just make cribs for the %$^  of it! they do alot to keep the baby safe        thx for the 2 pts|`|t9S0dqfLaa	You can't be serious, if you are God help your child|`|vsFJZRkGaa	the crib will keep her safe and stop her from crawling to somewhere dangerous during the night.  e.g. down stairs, into cupboards/drawers, over sharp objects, to place where she can find things to put into her mouth etc etc|`|t44CO7S2aa	In the crib|`|Bs8sllD9aa	crib. You don't want her getting up before you and falling down stairs or getting into some thing bad!|`|fouEsSofaa	Please put her in her crib. You don't want her crawling around without supervision.  In all honesty it only takes a few seconds for a baby to get into some serious trouble.  And you mentioned stairs.  If you mean you want her to sleep downstairs then get a portable play yard.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	put it in her crib. if she can crawl around she will not go back to sleep if she wakes up, she'll go play|`|311bce43c0d6a6dc9442d046a8943886aa	I would put her in the crib, Just in case she gets up and gets into something while you are sleeping, if shes at that stage anyway, also, the thought of a spider having easy access to the mattress..creeps me out..I would just let her sleep in her crib..:)|`|JnLoHaoAaa	The crib. That's what cribs were made for|`|cv0foxlTaa	Seriously?!  The crib!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
cJRFbZUaaa	See your doctor first.  He or she will probably recommend Tylenol (Acetaminophen) to start.  If that doesn't work, you need to see the doctor again.  Take only the medications that the doctor recommends and only in the dose recommended.    Just a note:  some of the people answering have stated that Extra Strength Tylenol is not recommended for pregnant women.  That is not exactly the case.  Extra Strength is merely 500 mg of Tylenol, whereas Regular is 325 mg.  So one Extra Strength tablet actually contains less medication than two Regulars.  It is the daily total   of mg that doctors take into account, not the name on the bottle.  Be sure to read the label so you know exactly how much medication you are taking.|`|P37lIBr2aa	You can only take REGULAR tylenol. Not extra strength, no gel capsules, just regular. Everything else has ibuprofin and can harm the baby.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Tylenol Extra strength two tablets at a time up to three times a day.. This is what my doc told me. Check with your doc|`|AA10478146	They say Tylenol is safe but, I wouldn't use it unless you absolutely have to.  No Aleve or Advil!!!|`|FyBNITUlaa	Make sure you are drinking lots of water and if you are able to go and lay down in a dark quiet room.  Although tylenol is the safest it still isn't good for your liver so I would try alternative ways first.  Good luck|`|4AO2myzKaa	Tylenol|`|LbHuUxkhaa	4head it's what I've been using. Unlike most headache treatments, 4head is specially designed to be applied directly to the forehead for effective headache relief without pills (pills can harm the baby in the long run). It is presented in a convenient retractable stick dispenser. 4head contains a powerful natural painkiller, 100% levomenthol, that can help block pain signals caused by tension headaches and relax the muscles in the head.  It causes local skin sensations (such as cooling or tingling) at the site of application, followed by an painkilling effect. If you carry on getting headaches see your midwife or doctor because it's a sign of high or low blood presure. goodluck and congrats|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Tylenol is the safest. OB's always say NO Ibuprofin. Tylenol is THE safest. Hope you feel better|`|rx0ekB9Paa	drink a bunch of water. dont take pills. u dont know how they will affect your baby in the long run      34 weeks pregnant with a bad cold|`|sOYUCM1vaa	I used paracetamol, just plain regular panadol. It was gentle on my stomach as well. It didn't help completely, but it took most of the headache away, then a quick nap did the rest.|`|AA10976444	My Dr said Tylenol only...nothin else.|`|quieXSekaa	tylenol. do not take ib profin!!!!!|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Only Paracetamol and not too much - tell your Dr your taking it|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Take tylenol. My doctor said thats the only safe thing to take. good luck. feel better.|`|I7myOp8Qaa	Normal strength Tylenol and not more than 4 a day is what my doctor told me.|`|82ORY9UFaa	Dont take medecine unleast you really NEED to, especially during the first trimester. Headaches are 'part' of the first trimester. Drink a LOT of water. Otherwise, when I when in the ER at 12, the doctors gave me acetamenophen ( Tylenol) and said it wasnt dangerous for me or the baby at this point of the pregnancy|`|cncAzZPiaa	Tylenol.. I take the extra strength 500 mg... safe and effective!|`|S5v9I0y2aa	Tylenol (acetaminophen) is fine to take in pregnancy.  But avoid NSAIDs (Aspirin or ASA, ibuprofen, or Advil).
eya1WDS4aa	She is sick hold her in your arms if you dont want her watching alot of tv then turn on some music but i dont think her watching some tv while she is sick is gonna hurt her.   My son just got over the stomach flu. I did toast with him, eggs, crackers, juice, water and chicken broth.|`|aAjpk4ylaa	If she is feeling sick, she is probably not wanting to play a whole lot-no more than you do when you are sick.  It won't hurt her to watch a little more tv than you normally let her watch, as long as it is within reason.  My boys like being lazy like that too.  Have you tried giving her honey to help her throat?  As long as she is not allergic to it (I don't know anyone that is...), it should help her for a little bit.  But the OTC meds don't help at all.  If you can get her to color, try that.  My oldest wouldn't color when he was that age but my youngest loved it and still does.  Also, not a bad snack-popsicles.  They help keep them hydrated since they don't like to eat a lot when sick and the coldness helps to ease the pain of the throat.  Her coughing has probably gotten it a little sore by now if she has been coughing a good bit.  You are mommy, your arms are the best place in the world.  Everyone wants Mommy when they're sick.|`|xszqbAFXaa	Let her rest, and you can maybe give her apple juice or ginger ale. Chicken noodle soup is a good idea. Maybe some ice pops or something like that will help her throat. Just allow her to rest and hold her.  I hope you both feel better soon.|`|PUUXbVK2aa	maybe colour with her?    popsicles and crackers are good when youre sick.  and flat seven up/ sprite and ginger ale.|`|nMzzwrtUaa	Its always hard to know what exactly you child is feeling. There is child Vick's out there that smells like cherry and has a very mild smell that will sooth her coughing , there is also children medication that can give them with a small amount. With the vicks on her chest you can take her out while she is bundled up.|`|IngripgMaa	Try giving her a crayon...or washable marker and a notebook.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	fresh orange juice diluted with water:) any soup, yoghurts and cheese to pick up and of course water to keep her hydrated. you can serve it warm if you like. i think it would be ok to let her chill out with cuddles and t.v til she gets better in my opinion, it wont delay speech etc:))) hope she feels better soon:)
TLNQZ63baa	What is going on inside  you?  Let's take a look...|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	You should see a Dr|`|CG5L6Fm6aa	u pregnant same thing going on with me so test fast and easy|`|AJcwSWf1aa	You should see a doctor. That's not normal.|`|lqSMkDNkaa	Honey I would make an appointment with your doctor because you shouldnt be feeling that much pain unless you have an infection or are having a miscarriage.
oXzHvsBpaa	APril in Cali can be warm. I would stock up on pants, maybe a few sleep n plays, a few hoodies for when its cold, socks, maybe a few pairs of shorts for when its really hot out. I would also get a few hats. We are from Ny where it is much colder and my son will be wearing sleep n plays. They are my fav to put him in.|`|pXSKSS3daa	My son was born April 4th and for the most part he was in a onesie with shorts or a romper during the day. For nighttime we just put him in a light weight sleeper.    Swaddling in a onesie should be plenty, especially if your house temp. is set around the low 70s. You don't want to over heat her.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I'm in Cali too, I'd get some light outfits with pants and some long sleeve shirts just to have but the rest I'd get summer stuff, but get them in the 3-6 month size cause she's going to grow right out of the 0-3.   Good Luck! Happy Delivery!|`|IngripgMaa	April....probably be pretty nice and warm out.  Maybe some booties, and a little hat for the wind.  Good Luck!|`|NroZQN5vaa	Well, my baby was born in Minnesota in the winter and she was just fine with blankets and onesies so I'm sure your baby will be too. I would get a few long sleeved things and some short sleeved things and be sure that you have plenty of blankets to throw over her. You can always wrap her in several blankets if you think it's cold out. Good luck!|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	i was a big believer in layers mine wore alot of onesies with comfy pants and i usually carried a sweater and blanket around just in case the easiest way to think about it is if it's chilly or cold she needs one more layer than you do and always remember during  summer there's always places that run the AC way too much and then she'll need a blanket|`|PuJd9SNlaa	Sleepers are the best for newborns.  You can usually find them made of cotton or terrycloth.  So if it is a little cooler, than I would dress her in the terrycloth, cotton for the warmer days.|`|XeVecc65aa	You probably want some light receiving blankets to wrap her in. Maybe some little pants outfits. Do not over dress her though.|`|sHKrDChwaa	My daughter was born last May, we live in Alabama so we dealt with a lot if humidity. She lived in onesies and shirt/bloomer sets. A hat is a definite must, try to find one that blocks uv rays. And also sunblock, my poor baby got a little sun burn on her cheeks at a weekend birthday party.|`|ZdeJCdCbaa	i would get summer and winter items. light sweaters and lots of socks...their feet get cold easy.|`|pjgMW6qaaa	buy her little pants and some long sleeve shirts    thats what i did for my daughter. California weather is really nice but it gets a little cold. So get some sweaters and a lot of socks.  Just get those newborn size because by the time it gets more warm she will probably not be fitting into those.    congrats on your girl they are so much fun!
RcHO6d3Eaa	Yes, unless he's ill or very tired for some other reason.     Depends on your son but I wake mine gently after an hour if he's sleeping after 2pm, and after about 30 minutes if he's sleeping after 4pm. He doesn't normally sleep in the morning, but if he does I normally let him wake up himself (although I'd wake him if he slept more than an hour and a half, but he never does during the day). He goes to bed around 8/ 8.30.  He's 2 now and most days he doesn't sleep during the day. Took us ages to work this out -- for us, sleep definitely didn't beget sleep.|`|cypZ0ykXaa	its compleately o.k to maintain his sleep schedule.coz' many kids if take a nap in the evening or long time in the afternoon, they'll sleep lately in the night.however they'll cover it up by sleeping the next day. but the office going mom & dad cant|`|jrVlzffeaa	Yeah we have to too if he sleeps for a long time, he doesn't seem to mind Xx|`|heoBp6Taaa	Yes I used to wake my son. I don't see why it would be a problem, Also if my son hadn't gone down for a nap by a certain time I would keep him up and let him have an earlier night for the same reason. Otherwise like you I would have been still chasing him around at midnight. My son is a bit over 2 now and won't sleep through the day however I still put him down for rest.|`|ZtGThw01aa	If it is after 5:00pm, we usually do. She will not sleep during the night if we do not. I think that's OK, unless she is feeling sick.     :)|`|CdodhnP5aa	I do with my 3 yr old, like you said if left to sleep they will be awake all night long.
SBJNJEBBaa	they say to eat something really sugary like a candy bar and lie on your side for like 30 min, watching tv or something and dont move and count the kicks or moves if its like 3 in that time you should be good!|`|lqSMkDNkaa	Every day is different for the baby, some days are more active and some days they just chill, they have moods just like us.  You have days where you just want to rest all day right?  Same for the baby.|`|5gHtVI5Caa	eat some of those fizzy candies...that syhould do it.|`|xeS8pUfbaa	around 30 weeks is when i started to REALLY be able to feel her on a regular basis.|`|M1UiYHi5aa	drink more juice and fruit and even some candy or cookies or jello and pudding that will get the baby moveing|`|lSl2Arlpaa	some babies move more than others, id go and see your doctor if your worried though :)
1kZenfZzaa	My husband did a wonderful job in the delivery room.  Originally there were 2 other family members in the room, but they kept his attention away from me talking about stupid thing like the weather.  After I asked them to leave, he could focus only on me.  Don't worry one person is enough and everything is going to be fine.    Congrats on the baby!|`|Bs8sllD9aa	I almost was alone but got lucky and had some one there. While I was waiting by myself I had a great nursing staff anda great crew of doctors that made sure I was never all alone. I am sure that you will do just fine and so will your hubby. Best wishes|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	I had a doula and my husband and I really wished by about 2 hours into it that we didn't have the doula. Your husband can do it. After all its not him you should b concerned about on the big day its you and the baby-which should also occupy his concerns.|`|jjQOvFyzaa	Well..if it makes you feel any better I have the same anxiety. I am due next thursday actually(1st child) and I'm not even worrying about it now since it's so close I'm more excited about the baby. My husband is in the army so we are in oklahoma while all of our family is in Pittsbugh, pa..unable to come. I have also worried that I will be all alone because my husband is horrible with blood, needles, etc..and unfortunately so am I. It used to be on my mind all the time but like I said now that it is so close I am thinking about other things!! I can let you know how it goes as soon as she decides its time to come out!! DONT STRESS|`|T1hZG4O3aa	Im sure your husband will be fine, If you prepare him for the birth and do brithing classes he cant be a major help. My husband was the only person I had with me and he was great and so were my nurses. He took pictures and still comforted me.  Im happy it was just me and him since it was our baby and we got to share it together. I was only in labor for 4 hours, i waited 1 hour at home as well. Not all first time moms have long labor, do a lot of walking and stretching , it can help your labor along. Im sure your husband can handle it if you give him the chance. But if you are that worried then see if you can find a doula.|`|n4d7rqr4aa	Many people only have the medical personnel and their partner with them.  If you're worried about your husband needing a break, establish a comfortable relationship with the doctor/midwife delivering you, so you don't feel awkward if he steps out for a little while.  If you want someone personal with you at all times, ask a sister, or someone you've known for a long time.  You shouldn't feel embarrassed, you're giving somebody a huge honor!  Chances are, most of the people would be too excited knowing they mean that much to you, that you'd ask them to be there for the birth of your child, to care much about any potential embarrassment.|`|5MBdJK4Baa	I only have 1 person with me.. You could look up a Doula, they can help you with the birthing too.
v3LnJycKaa	umm no it doesnt have any bearing on wether or not u ovulate.|`|vue9NOhYaa	No. Ultram is not a contraceptive.|`|i9BgSAMjaa	i think
LFXTpqfdaa	As long as you didn't use one of those heavy-duty oven cleaners with the terrible fumes, you'll be fine.|`|kknCZkq0aa	I don't think so, all ovens do is heat up an extreme amount when they're self cleaning.|`|j9axB0YMaa	No you fine. Think about it all a self cleaning oven does is heat up really hot for a long time to burn off the burnt food in the oven. Have you ever heard of a person having a miscarriage or birth defect  from smelling burnt food?
S4pNsW3Taa	Why the hell would you drink alcohol while pregnant!? If you knew you were pregnant and drank alcohol thats just cruel and dumb on your part. If you drank and didn't know you were pregnant then you should be fine as long as you stop drinking alcohol ASAP!|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Most likely not.  Many women smoke, drink, or even do some drugs the first month because they are not aware they are pregnant and the baby comes out fine.  Unless you were drinking a fifth of vodka everyday, your baby will be fine; just practice better habits for the rest of your pregnancy (such as not drinking).|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	not likely unless you over over drank and you could lose it kids get fetal alcohol  if there moms dranks throught out there pregnancy|`|xeS8pUfbaa	it is possible but not likely. i didn't know i was pregnant till i was 4 weeks [2 weeks from conception] and i drank almost every day. my baby is fine. just stop drinking|`|IA5zVfk0aa	not unless you do it heavily for the majority of your period. then your baby could come with thing upper lips and widley spaced eyes|`|zSABr7praa	I had gone to two weddings in the first month of my pregnancy before I learned I was pregnant, and enjoyed the open bars.  I was terrified, but my Dr told me I was "most likely" safe.  He said in the first 5 weeks, it's unlikely alcohol will effect the embryo.|`|SBJNJEBBaa	no becuase most people dont know that they are pregnant until then, i did and stopped when i found out i was pregnant and my duaghter is fine|`|78FXygtoaa	i drank for the first 2 months bcuz i didnt know i was pregnant... but it wasnt all hard liqour and wasnt excessive either. but my doctor said everything should be fine. im 34 weeks now and so far so good. nothing bad to worry about and nothing questionable showed up on the ultra sounds when they did the brain and stuff|`|CiFR2xuBaa	I had a few drinks with both of my children before knowing I was pregnant, but as soon as I found out, I didn't drink anymore and both of my children were born healthy and beautiful!
BKr3y30maa	Can't tell you the exact date but can give you an estimate. When's your due date?  And how many days is your cycle usually?|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	In order to find out when you got pregnant I went back two days and forward 20 weeks to get your due date of June 23, 2009.  These are also the dates I came up with:    LMP - September 16, 2008  Conception - September 30, 2008  Due Date - June 23, 2009  As of February 5, 2009 you are 20 weeks and 2 days|`|252719641f8be9be749df917e256dd53aa	When you had sex???
LiPoEBenaa	I'm 36wks and I did have to do some additional testing because of my BMI. My BMI is right at 30. Everything did come back normal though. No diabetes or any signs of pre-eclampsia as of yet. Now I have had perfectly healthy friends wind up with both of those problems. Just follow a good diet and walk/get exercise when you can. That's what I did and it seemed to work pretty well!   Good luck and congrats on your pregnancy!|`|oXIYHsDaaa	Your doctor will just want to monitor your health carefully and get you to try and gain less weight (usually 15 - 25 Lbs instead of 25 - 35Lbs) My BMI is only 26 but I have lots of friends who are a lot heavier and they were fine.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	you really need to get in under conrol bad!! start now eating what you need to and no junk food or overeatting as before . I bet you can even lose some if you eat right and walk daily . yes it could and most likely WILL turn into things you said and more like preterm for example|`|AR683Nz6aa	mine is higher then 30, im 39 weeks pregnant and have a healthy baby boy about to come into this world. had no problems,, a very easy pregnancy compared to my friend who is stick thin. only thing you will notice is that you wont show as much or as quick as other ppl.. which to me was a shame because i loved to say i was expecting but might be a bonus for you! good luck ... ps if the docs are worried they will do extra tests on the safe side.|`|hSJnaysiaa	Pregnancy problems truly vary from one woman to another.    For example, I am a bigger girl and am 32 weeks pregnant with a healthy and thriving baby boy. No complications so far other than extreme morning sickness (which I have to this day). I do not have gestational diabetes, or eclampsia. I don't have back pain or hemorrhoids. I'm pretty much the same as I was before. I've gained only 4 pounds (which considering I was a bigger girl to begin with is good- try to gain as little weight as possible so its easier to come off). The baby himself weighed 3 pounds 10 ounces at my last ultrasound according to the measurements, so with the added dluid and placenta weight, I have lost weight during this pregnancy. I eat healthy things, and exercise (though I really don't exercise much because I work full time and all). But eating healthy is important.     However, a girl in my parenting class is tiny and she has had so many complications- gestational diabetes, sore back/hips, gaining too much weight, etc.    So, a healthy pregnancy is possible, even if you are bigger, but not guaranteed. Not all people are the same so there are no guarantees.|`|053a4548821e29d68d196b76d3989f07aa	Hi there. First off all, congrats on your pregnancy. I can tell you first hand that it can be very scary to think of. I'm obese myself and am almost 20 weeks now. However, I've learned (and still learning along the way) that you just need to try not to worry so much and take each day with a grain of salt. I finally got it through my head that all I was doing was causing my body stress, which was causing stress on my baby. I definitely don't need something else to worry about! Heh.    You've got to remember that these complications are very real, and are possible, but they can happen to ANYONE. You can be of normal size, super skinny, or even morbidly obese and still these complications can happen. However, on the upside, there have been plenty of women your size and larger who have had completely safe and healthy pregnancies.     Yes, as they say, its true, that more weight = bigger risk. But the same could be said about loads of different issues. Smokers are more at risk of cancer, heavy drinkers are more at risk of of liver problems, etc. There are risks with everything! All you need to do is first and foremost, stay calm and relaxed as much as possible. Eat healthy, and if you can, get some light exercise in.     If you'd like to talk and keep in touch, feel free. I can relate 100% on these feelings. I've been there (recently!) and know the worries. :)
9OsjdsrZaa	First I would suggest starting her on some solids, if she hasn't already started.  Not too many if you are not comfortable with it, maybe just some rice cereal.  It is very easy on their little tummies, and helps satisfy them a little more than nursing.  This could help with her nap length.    Next , start by setting up a new routine.  When she wakes up in the morning.  Nurse her, feed her some cereal and have some play time.  When she starts getting tired, around 9 or so, put her down for her nap.  You can nurse her if you like, but you want to be able to encourage her to fall asleep on her own.  So maybe nurse her until she is drowsy, then put her down.      My guess, is that with the added food in her tummy, she will start lengthening her nap time.      My 3 children hit growth spurts at about 6 months.  Breast milk just wasn't enough for them anymore.  When I started introducing more solids into their diets...they began to have longer sleep cycles.    If the added food does not lengthen her nap cycle, when you nurse her, try and keep her awake.  Talk to her.  Tickle her toes.  Keep her engaged so that she will not fall asleep.  Help her through her drowsiness, and she will naturally be more tired for her nap times...slowly gravitating towards fewer and longer naps.    Hope this helps.  Good Luck.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Personally speaking, I think if a 6 month old was sleeping through the night reliably I wouldn't screw with her nap schedule.  She's obviously getting exactly what she needs.  If you mess with the sleep schedule on one side, you are inevitably going to end up "paying for it" on the other.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	She's still breastfeeding?  Does that mean you aren't giving her any solids?  How about if you tried (talk to your dr. first) giving her some rice cereal, mixed with breast milk?  It would keep her tummy full longer, and she might not wake up as quickly.|`|2f7d753df622c9c42a37e136f0451cb6aa	dont let her fall asleep while eating.  keep her awake.  switch sides.  whipe a cool rag on your face to wake her up.  after eating play with her keep her entertained and awake then when you want her to go to sleep put her to sleep.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	I think my son took 3 naps at that age. You could try keeping ehr awake for longer stretches and then making sure she is comfortable and full when you do put her down for a nap. Does swaddling make her sleep longer? Or maybe she would sleep longer in her swing? Try out different things to find what works for her. good luck
eO4y3m1maa	Didnt your doctor explain this to you?     Maybe read the pamphlet it came with?|`|Y6DUXDfdaa	How can you be using a NuvaRing and not know how it works?|`|CPqfNUoRaa	relax if your period is late the take the pregnacy  test or go to the docters|`|h0KhvQlyaa	It depends on the person, the nuva ring doesn't work right away that just means that it begins working but you are not fully protected right away it takes a while for your body to absorb the hormones in the ring.. it can take from 7 days to a month depending on how you react to it.so go to a doctor if u feel u may be pregnant but u should wait until you would normally have a period, because you wouldn't have enough hormone for them to tell if your were pregnant yet. Whoever prescribed the nuvaring to you should have explained all this.|`|cFSpYoDfaa	Is this your first month using the NuvaRing? If so, there is a possibilty because like most birth control you have to use it a whole cycle before it is "safe" to have sex without a condom. If you have been using it for 2 months or more, then there shouldn't be anything to worry about. If you miss a period, it may also be nothing. I used the NuvaRing and some months I didn't get one or they wouldn't last long. If he didn't you know what in you where did it go? Make him use a condom in the future to save a headache, he will be alright.
AA10153923	The symptoms state your pregnant.  But we can't be sure unless you take a test and go to the doctors.  The light bleeding might be spotting which usually happens in the beginning of your pregnancy and comes and goes.  It seems like you are. I hope this is a push for you to get a test.  It might be to early for the test to say Positive yet. So take one every couple weeks.     If you are pregnant CONGRATS its a beautiful thing.|`|AA11220327	the chance of being pregnant is always there, especially if you have missed pills, i would do a test asap to ease your mind|`|78FXygtoaa	its a possibility but its probably like "withdrawal" type effects from the pill|`|hTFQuvnSaa	yes there is a chance that u can be pregnant so u should take a pregnancy test to find out 4 sho
CVdcrY3kaa	I've never heard that before. My daughter was sitting unassisted at 5 months...no damage there!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Absolutely not, I don't know where anyone would get that idea!|`|72SrLDQ3aa	no|`|0qP8gLpyaa	No. Whoever told you that is an idiot. Kids will sit up on their own when they are good and ready. My son did it at 4 1/2 months. My friends little girl did it at the same age and both kids are fine.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Oh look, an all new urban myth.    Who on earth told you that one?|`|3F8bCZ55aa	No.|`|SaRDq9iLaa	I never heard of that.  My daughter is almost 6 months and she has been able to sit for awhile.|`|nYioXmnGaa	never herd it but all i have is boys so i do not know ! Hope i helped!!!!!!!!!!|`|JF2IgFUjaa	no.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I've never heard of that at all...|`|IngripgMaa	I have NEVER heard that.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Never heard of that!
qhINFhGEaa	your son grabbing it probably didn't have much of an effect. they don't want you to move the tests because they can retain too much fluid if held a certain way and you wont get an answer at all, but won't cause a false positive. in order to get a positive result from a pregnancy test, you have to have the pregnancy hormone in your urine.|`|wqeAeSVYaa	What's your confusion Fertile Myrtle?  You need to be talking to your parents or Planned Parenthood to figure out what you're going to do next.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	What's there to be confused about?  It was positive so you're pregnant; it's that simple.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	The test is right. How long did you wait until you read the positive? Because in 3 minutes it will tell you if your pregnant or not.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	I think you should take another one just to be sure that the first one was either right or wrong.  It would not hurt to do it again.|`|rURYaq45aa	it could be right but you should try taking another one when you first wake up so it is accurate. that's when the test is most accurate when you first wake up. so try taking another just to be safe and if you are 16 days late its highly possible you are pregnant but take another just to be sure.|`|m5WRne9Eaa	Hi mom!|`|5A7RmIH6aa	hi mom.your toast.|`|AR683Nz6aa	i believe that your pregnant, whatever your son might of done wdnt stop the result from coming. once you pee on the stick it starts the process... good luck|`|eU5Eth2aaa	False positives are VERY rare.  Sooooo.....CONGRATS!    You can always take another test to ease your mind!|`|W0gMQVoDaa	i think you are pregnant xx|`|hZWup7xXaa	i had the same thing happen to me except my dog took it but it still turned out positive and i was pregnant so i'd say that you probably are too. congrats and good luck hun :)|`|HEOyvmYFaa	i dont think your son grabbing the test will affect it. ive dropped mine. if it came back positive then CONGRATS to you. if your still worried then call your dr and get a test or go to a clinic to make sure. good luck|`|MtOSX19Haa	If you got a control line and a positive line, then you are pregnant.  Congrats.  You can take another if you are unsure, but the test read a pregnancy hormone in your urine, so even though your son messed with it you are more than likely pregnant.  On my last test, it turned positive before I even had a chance to put it down.|`|5KFhok67aa	If the pregnancy test says positive then you are definately pregnant, unless you have recently miscarried, or had an abortion, there is such a thing as a false negative but no such thing as a false positive.... Congrats! :)|`|kH56qw2Taa	yur definatley pregnant  good luck xx
SaRDq9iLaa	I use Pampers Swaddlers now but my daughter is getting too big for them so I believe size 3 jumps to Pampers Cruisers.  I tried Huggies and hated them.  I tried Luvs and they are okay.  I love how Pampers fits her and how soft they feel!|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Pampers work best for us. Everything us was too tight on her chunky thighs and tended to leak.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	For my 4 months old huggies have never had a leak!  we buy them in bulk at costco 258 diapers for 40$ which lasts us over a month.

eU5Eth2aaa	I was doing the same thing as you this time last year!  I would get kind of emotional thinking about when my husband and I would start our own family!  I am now 13 weeks pregnant and I have never been happier!  I read the questions on this forum daily.  Most of these women are such an inspiration and it's nice to know that there are others out their that are going through the same thing!    I wish you and your love the best of luck when it comes time for you to start your family!  Good luck to you!  I hope I can be of help and give you advice when it comes times for you to ask the pregnancy questions!|`|DTYHoinVaa	You know it really does, and i have been in other sections on here where people are just rude and vicious, like the pet section. Everyone here is always glad to help and so nice unless the question is totally ridiculous. But yea, It does feel good.|`|QsMnslQlaa	i do too :)|`|OU9xnW86aa	This is about the only section I go into anymore, well this and Law (due to my occupation).|`|OuaZBkU9aa	I'm totally with you on this one I have 2 kids and I am done but I love coming in this section.  Hopefully I can help someone and its also nice to hear about other peoples joyful pregnancies!|`|3xMQW0A6aa	it makes me so happy!! making babies is what us women were meant to do!!  good luck with everything when you do try! it will happen when its supposed to.  i was off the pill for over a year, and couldve gotten prengnat many times im sure, but it wasnt until the month my husband said he was ready to start trying that i conceived right away!
HEOyvmYFaa	i would go home and just relax. your probably getting your self all worked up. i did the same thing with my second and first pregnancy. sounds like maybe your having braxton hicks contractions. your body is getting ready for the big day. i would also time your contractions. if they seem to be every 3-5 minutes and they start getting more Intense i would call the doctor. but again im not a dr. so if you really have concerns call your dr. that what he/she is there for. good luck|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Lie down on your left side and drink a big glass of water or two. Pay close attention to the tightening / contractions and time them precisely as you can, from the start to the finish of each contraction and the start of one contraction to the start of the next. If your contractions are each lasting more than 45 seconds, and if they are around 10 minutes apart so that you are having more than 6 in one hour, then you should definitely call your doctor.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	id go home, you dont sound well enough to be at work, have you had any discharge the last few days? like a brown or a red or maybe pink?    are these tightenings painful?    id call the doctor, you are not bothering him, this is important|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	I think you should at least call your Dr - even if you think your bothering him - he is there to help.    Sounds like it could be preterm labour, so dont wait on calling him|`|AA10908541	You should call your doctor and ask him what he thinks you should do. Its totally normal for a first time mother to have a lot of questions and its better to be safe than sorry, thats his job anyways, to help you along your pregnancy so you have a healthy baby. :) good luck.    p.s. im 32 weeks and having mine on march 30th.. c-section...|`|9FbcLKsfaa	Im 37 weeks and for the past two weekends i just felt something wasn't right, i have been having back labor and sure enough when i go in ive been admitted both times and they have had to stop my contractions and each time i went in i called my doc before and he sounded annoyed but i know my body (third baby) so don't worry about annoying your doc, its you baby not theirs! If you feel you need to go then go, the worse thing they can do is sent you home! Remember these docs get paid the big bucks to do what they do, make em earn your money!|`|jjQOvFyzaa	I had pretty much the same thing around 34 or 35 weeks..I was embarrassed to go to the doctors but my mom convinced me to just go. I would definitely leave work, and it is quite possible you are having contractions. When I went to the hospital they did an internal exam to see if I was dialated or if my water broke. They also set me up on a monitor and it turned out I was indeed having contractions (so I didn;t feel so stupid) My advice (if you dont want to go straight to the doctor)..go home from work, lay on your left side, and drink tons of water..if your contractions/pains dont get better after 3-4 glasses of water and an hour or two of rest then go!!..thats what they told me when I was released. Hope it helps!!|`|hWe8vhKKaa	best thing you can do is contact your dr.it can be contractions especially if they come after 10 mins or so.or go to hospital and get it checked out.
5RzhT1Ctaa	probably not but you should wait for your test|`|85vDqn6naa	You could be, take a hpt|`|lSl2Arlpaa	sometimes mucking your pill about causes your period to be late but if you still dont have one in about a week id take a pregnancy test :)|`|QsMnslQlaa	well you used some protection so honestly i dont think so, but there is always that like 1% chance you know? take a pregnancy test to check.
75c742d5acd622a0bb5f444e18bb5853aa	You can get pregnant after a miscarriage. I got pregnant 6 weeks after one. I would take a test if you think you might be pregnant. Good luck.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Yes, your body heals after a miscarriage actually rather quickly, you could be pregnant - take a home pregnancy test.|`|DNygQdmVaa	have you tested yet? you probably should.
OuaZBkU9aa	I am sure it would sell I would have bought one lol|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	There already is one - Intelligender|`|C4ibOR7Laa	there is 1, it can be used from 7 weeks, you prick your finger and put a drop of blood onto this machine thing and it tells you if they are XY chromosome's or something silly, its expensive though|`|Wc3Vge9taa	i would get one just for the fun of it!! but of course i wouldn't base the sex on that test that's what the good old fashion  ultrasound is for.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	There already is one... Intelligender.  You can buy it at Target or online.|`|s1utniuvaa	I would so buy that... but it would have to work for twins lol
OU9xnW86aa	They may be able to if the baby cooperates. GOOD LUCK! :)|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	we found out at 17wks with last baby there was no mistaking HIS bits and the same at 18wks with this baby   so as long as baby is laying right yes u have a very good chance x x|`|5yAsj29Vaa	It's always best to try to determine gender at or after 20 weeks, but it's possible to find out that early, though I wouldn't put all my eggs in one basket until a later u/s.  Good luck.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Probably will - if the bub co operates!!|`|DNygQdmVaa	yes they will probably be able to tell what the baby is.  don get ur hopes up though, they cant always tell and they aren always right.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	Hopefully!  As long as the little one doesn't decide to be modest and keep it's legs crossed.  That's what happened to my cousin and they still have no idea what they're having!  :)    Congrats!|`|YCICrIKyaa	More than likely if it is a boy they will be able to tell you. If it is a girl they may suggest that but also tell you that they aren't 100% sure and you shouldn't buy things until your next one. It also depends on the baby's position while they are scanning. Good luck!|`|xeS8pUfbaa	most likely yes!|`|XjcER6zvaa	no 20 weeks is when  they can tell you the sex|`|qhINFhGEaa	probably yes. but don't always count on it. it usually depends on whether or not  your little one cooperates.|`|OuaZBkU9aa	They should be able to as long as the baby doesn't decide to cross his legs like mine did.
DZCFD0p2aa	yes.|`|AJcwSWf1aa	Yes you can get pregnant from that. Do you use tampons? because if you do, your hymen may already been broken. He doesn't have to ejaculate to get you pregnant. Pre-*** emits at the very beginning. Also, you don't have to go all the way in for the semen to get in.
7yd7lNU7aa	This should be of some help.|`|4AO2myzKaa	I agree with answer  1, it's really loud for baby, so excessive use I'm sure would stress the baby out.|`|def5d056753c507adaad1d31c72512beaa	i didnt know that but im glad i read this, i use mine every night for along time.....    im 14 weeks|`|T48smu01aa	they say it can be a lil harsh on the babies ears its like being next to a helicopter for a baby and there ears are mor sensitive so its best not to use them all the time.....Why did you get a doppler anyways?

b7HFB7H6aa	C-R-A-Z-Y!!!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Your friend is confused.  I have no idea what's going on with her baby, but whatever it is,  it would not be called "puberty".  It is possible that your friend's baby has some kind of hormone imbalance that has been explained to her as "like going through puberty."  That is the only explanation I can think of.|`|cjKPEHaFaa	Your friend must have misunderstood.  That's not right.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	there ws a girl in the 40s who started mensturating at 8 mons and had a baby when she was 5   wat they did to the father of that child i do not no but it does seem strange|`|vue9NOhYaa	There is a  condition called precocious puberty. When that happens, babies/young children mature  far earlier than is normal. (Usually in early childhood, but very rarely much earlier.)    It can often be the result of an underlying medical condition, so she needs to speak again to her doctor to be sure she understands exactly what's going on.|`|UMRdHuuVaa	WOW-I have never heard of a 6 month old going through puberty.  But i did once watch a documentry about how kids nowadays are reaching puberty at an earlier age - and in rare cases kids as young as 6 can start going through it, but that was in RARE cases.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	I think she might want to talk to the doctor again.|`|Gem96NQyaa	I have a feeling that your friend misunderstood, but historically there have been cases of the onset of puberty occurring as an infant.  It's a very rare disorder, but it does exist.  Usually the onset of symptoms is between 5 and 8, but it's been known to occur earlier (in one particular case, the girl was about 8 months old at onset and ended up having a child when she was 5).  It's called precocious puberty.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocious_...
Ccq8zEcnaa	18 weeks is when you are in the second trimester, and much of the morning sickness goes away. I noted this time in my pregnancy as a grace period, in between times I felt really bad. Not every day you will feel pregnant or feel like you are showing. Consider this a good thing. If you are really concerned, try to get your ultrasound moved up a bit. But it is very normal for first time moms to all of a sudden get those days where they don't have any symptoms and don't feel preggers.|`|nXrAkx8Iaa	im just now 27 weeks pregnant and i havent had any signs of  being pregnant i really didnt think i was pregnant until i had to go into my ultrasound and still after that it was hard to believe and im just now showing but trust me when your baby becomes really active like kepping you up all night because he is using your bladder as a punching bag then you will really know your pregnant|`|T48smu01aa	no nothing it wrong don't worry and don't think about it you will scare yourself I felt the same way all the way untill I started feeling the baby all the time....good luck and congrats!!!  Don't worry you will be fine!!!|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Nothing to worry about - all your symptoms pass from your first trimester (nausea, sore breasts etc). Most people dont start showing with their first till about 20weeks or so.    Try not to worry|`|vGHaYp6Naa	around then was when my symptoms stopped. i was scared too but its just the symptoms easing up. ITS MARVELOUS!|`|LFXTpqfdaa	If the only issue is that you are not showing at 18 weeks, don't worry. That's common in a first pregnancy. Plus morning sickness and fatigue have passed and you're likely feeling like yourself again. You can call the doctor for reassurance, but I'm pretty sure you're fine and so is the baby. Try to enjoy the 2nd trimester while you still have it!|`|qhINFhGEaa	you are heading into your second trimester.     isn't it wonderful? enjoy the lack of symptoms, because once you get into your third, trust me, you will feel pregnant!    Congratulations!|`|vDhHzxRJaa	Girl you are going to be wishing you would not be pregnant anymore when you are 9 months like I am I feel as a cow.. But I felt like that when I was about 25 week I felt like no baby but O she is in there
xzh8r0jIaa	i have a feeling im going to get nauseous when i gointo labor|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	Yes it's possible. I actually felt sick while I was in labor at the hospital.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	nauseous? yes sometimes you can feel sick alot of women say thats how they knew labour was starting second time round because they felt sick with the first one when labour started.|`|P7Bu2I8eaa	Its very normal....     I was throwing up and puking at the sametime when it was time to push, and before the pushing had began I was vomitting as well.     Good Luck|`|7yd7lNU7aa	I was so, so, so nauseous!|`|eV7rtxmuaa	In late pregnancy allot of women experience nausea. The begining of second stage labour for me is when I started vomiting... its was uncontrollable for me.
MOsStEbqaa	Sounds like you could be but all you can do is see if you miss your period. Sometimes i can take up to 2 weeks for HCG to show up in urine, if at all. You need to take a blood test. See if there are free clinics in or around your town.|`|4AO2myzKaa	Maybe you have the flu or some other virus.  If you had your period on the 14th, you would have just conceived this past weekend so not likely you would have symptoms this early.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Home pregnancy tests aren't really accurate until you have missed a period.      You could be, but only a doctor could tell you for sure.|`|CG5L6Fm6aa	sound prego to me wait another week and test again|`|ir2AKdOsaa	I'm not a doctor.  but i would say either its Pre Pre pms   or maybe.  do you use protection or on the pill?|`|1tkFGhU6aa	well, its still too early to find out, the earlier i've heard is 12 days post ovulation to test positive..  wait 10 days then test  but anyways if the pain on the left is still there or its gotten worse, u should go to the dr as it could be ectopic pregnancy|`|BPsMkdKiaa	probably one of 2 things are causing your symptoms.  1) pregnant  2) stressed out over possible pregnancy  take a folic acid, and lay off the booze until you can be tested. the drug store tests are just as accurate as the ones in the doctor's office, so don't blow the money unless you want your blood tested. you can call a crisis pregnancy center (planned parenthood, religious places, etc) to see if you can get a test cheaper there.|`|QYSsvqXyaa	I think you know the anwser to your question! Do you go to the bathroom more often especialy at night?  Sounds like you are! theres a test for 15 bucks that tests 5 days before your missed period. Try it! It worked for me.|`|c7559d36f33ee64e68287b78b13b6206aa	well your period is not due for another week. if your period does not arrive by 2.21.09, then you should definetely see a doctor.     you can e-mail me and i can help you more if you want.     have you been sick?  have you been stressed?|`|7yd7lNU7aa	Wait a week and then test again. The hcg double every other day so that should give it some time to build enough up for the test to detect it.

0VHolTVEaa	All the rides in disney land are for children ages 1 and over but they do have a fun adventure bit so babies and children can play|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Yeah you can for sure do all the fantasy land rides like the storybook ones. Snow White, PeterPan, etc. etc.    They also have the playhouse disney area in California adventure which looks fun!    Ignore the people that said NO rides for your baby... okay I have season passes and have been millions of times there are plenty of baby rides. The pooh bear and Monsters Inc have the brightest neon colors which will engage your childs attention!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	none -leave the babe with the nanny & enjoy your day.  the child will have more fun at age 5.|`|GDobAMQ8aa	Anything that doesn't jerk you around too much.  Be careful on Pirates; I know there's a slightly sudden drop or two in there.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	I'm not sure check with disney?|`|b2TDw4VIaa	I would think any that you could hold the baby on. Maybe you could look up thier website and check it out.|`|jn34aSgHaa	i think that they dont let babies on the rides untill theu can walk so i dont think that you would be able to take the baby on any rides but contact disney anyways they should let you know.good luck and have fun|`|O2fXBvB2aa	buzz light year, haunted mansion, any ride that is not to fast and jerky
IGwX328eaa	I think anywhere between 3-6ounces is fine all babies are different some eat more, some eat less.    at 8 weeks my son was eating 3 or 4 ounces every 2-3hours he is now 10 months old eats about four 5oz bottles a day|`|sw2R5A9iaa	feed your child on demand -never compare your baby to another.  if you are concerned about weight gain, consult the pediatrician.|`|LMkj8D8eaa	at 8 weeks old, according to doctor charts, they should be eating 4-6 4 oz. baba's a day|`|BdE4GquHaa	My baby girl is 9 weeks today and eats roughly 5oz every 4 hours and she has regular and steady weight gain. Sometimes more like 8oz when she is being greedy and naughty lol, and sometimes less. Just depends. X|`|ZKVIW4Apaa	My Daughter is 8 Weeks tomorrow and she eats 4oz every 4 hours, i have never done demand feed. Her dr said 1oz of food per hour is the way as long as they are eating at least 6-7 bottles in a 24 hour period is plenty and having a healthy weight gain.    mom to 1 :)|`|u9sGH0AXaa	I breastfeed my 9 week old on demand as well.  Its usually about 3-5 ounces every 3-4 hours.  She usually ends up eating 8-10 times a day.
Fc5RbhqOaa	Crib, preferably one with a drawer on the bottom for storage  Extra Sheets for crib  Swaddling blankets  Flannel receiving blankets  cloth diapers, for burping  Changing table if you want one if not a good changing pad  Onesies for layering  nightgowns, they are open on the bottom, they work very well for middle of the nights when you don't want to fumble with buttons and snaps  Socks to keep feet warm  No scratch mittens  a couple hats  breast pump if you are breastfeeding  breast milk storage bags or bottles  bottles, and extra nipples  pacifiers  Swing, if you have a small house a travel swing might work just as well  Boppy Pillows, they are truly priceless  extra covers for the boppy  Stroller  Infant car seat, extra base for 2nd car or grandparents  Pack n Play if you have a 2 story this will work great for naps and quick changes, also works well if you travel a lot or take long trips to grandmas  Big diaper bag for longer trips  smaller diaper bag for short trips  Activity Gyms, try and find one that can be used for different stages, such as tummy time, laying on the back, sitting up and crawling  Bouncer with vibration works like a charm for cranky babies  microwave bottle and nipple sterilizer, avent and dr browns make good ones  extra diapers  extra wipes  butt cream, you don't have to buy fancy baby butt creams, you can just buy a giant tub of vaseline, it does the same thing, if baby does develop a rash use baby powder to keep moisture away and let baby go w/out a diaper for about 30 mins a day but keep them on a plastic tablecloth!! You never know what will happen.   highchair, one that reclines is the best because you can start them in the highchair when they first start eating solids  first aid kit  nail clippers, hairbrush, baby lotion, baby shampoo, thermometer      The Ultimate Must-Have for all new parents:    The name and number of a 24 hour Nurses line that you can call anytime day or night with questions because trust me, you will have a lot and this will take so much off your mind if you have someone to talk to.     Good luck, congrats on pregnancy and welcome to motherhood!|`|XflZjhaXaa	There are so many things! Babies-R-Us has pretty good lists.     You definitely need a baby carrier (beco, infantino, baby bjorn etc, moby wrap, etc). If you plan on breastfeeding get the "My Brest Friend" nursing pillow, you'll like it so much better than the boppy (I promise). A sound machine to drown out other noises. Something that has a heartbeat, rain, waterfalls etc. Also a medela pump if you plan on breastfeeding. Oh and a swaddle me wrap to swaddle baby at night.|`|deIzFnV8aa	Don't buy many clothes, just a few outfits to get you started, and some undershirts.  The baby will grow out of the newborn size quickly, and everyone you know will buy cute clothes for the baby. In fact, people I don't even know bought clothes for our baby.  Sisters of coworkers of my parents, people like that!|`|3NyM1cq5aa	A BOPPY!!!!|`|GDobAMQ8aa	A boppy is definitely a good idea.    Lots of diapers (you won't believe how many of those you're going to go through).    Lots of wipes (and, like someone else said, you don't need a wipe warmer; it's a waste of money).    Something to change the baby on (if you'll be just putting him on a table or dresser top, get something soft to lay the baby on).    Lots of little blankets or wash cloths for spit-ups and/or drooling.  Some small, soft towels and wash cloths for bath time.    Some baby bottles, if you plan on pumping or formula feeding.  Clothes, of course, including hats and lots of socks.    If you plan to use a pacifier, buy a few of those.  I've also found that pacifier leashes (ones that you attach to the paci and the clip onto clothing) are soooooooo useful; babies like to spit those suckers out, and having the leash keeps them from falling onto the floor.    Diaper bag (although, they may give you at least a small diaper bag at the hospital).    Gas drops really helped our son during his first few months.    One more thing: breast pads.  Even if you're not going to breastfeed, you'll be leaking.|`|tapFZBowaa	I know you are looking for "must haves" but I can tell you, you don't need a wipee warmer--just dries them out.    For sure get a boppy, lots of cloth diapers for spit rags, and our bottle warmer was awesome for us since we have a two story.  Congrats!|`|CgGIbExVaa	just the basic stuff im a mother of a 5 year old little boy and im 5 months pregnant with a little boy  . lots of onsies ,burb rags ,bottles ,pacifiers, wipes ,diapers,baby-wash ,baby powder,diaper rash cream, baby oil, bottle warmer, scratch mittens ,socks,bibs, baby hats . bottle drying rack . bottle brushes , gas drops . small diaper bag for on the go , big diaper bag for travel , ice packs to keep the milk chilled .|`|x2THxqDKaa	burp cloths(cloth diapers are great), diapers &wipes, breast pump (if your pumping)& breast paps and  lots of blankets and receiving blankets (they are small and a little more thin than a regular baby blanket, bottles with stage 1 nipples,a baby swing or baby bouncer, baby clothes from size 0-6 months ( you could have a large baby so I wouldn't buy a lot of newborn sizes because they grow quick, a nasal aspirator, baby fingernail clippers, pacifiers, boppy, crib, infant car seat with base, a baby bath tub and baby wash cloths
heoBp6Taaa	Infants thrive on routine but at such a young age and throughout the 1st year they grow so fast and change so quickly their routine needs adjusting quite often. Just go with the flow. You'll know when your little one's changing and you'll work things out and change routine from there.    Good luck.|`|68c6B8dRaa	In about a year, when you have more of a toddler rather than a baby, who will actually care about that sort of thing. Quite useless right now; it will just frustrate baby, and you.|`|AA12041870	Seven weeks ago would have been good.  That child is learning at a very rapid rate.  Because he is already 7 weeks old, he has learned a lifetime of things to use against you, like screaming when he wants to be picked up in the middle of the night, etc.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	LOL. Not gonna happen honey. He's just a baby. He needs things when he needs them.|`|CUYuAGF5aa	Ir's never too early to start establishing a routine as the earlier this happens the better for you and the baby.  If your ready to start working on a routine then go for it before the baby starts making it's own routine.    Good luck!|`|pvH3oHRfaa	Not until baby is around 3/4 months. Newborns should be fed and put down to nap when they want.    Despite not needing a schedule, babies do benefit from having some routine things in a day. If you have a flexible night time process, i.e bath, feed, story/lullaby, bed, then baby will come to know when it is time to go to sleep, and will find it easier when you do have a slightly stricter routine.|`|7E37G0SGaa	Roughly now. By this I mean sure have a rough time where you say "hopefully" he will be fed at roughly x o'clock and at roughly x o'clock he will go to bed ..... at roughly x o'clock he will have a bath, etc.     Nothing works out to the dot. The baby can and will throw the best made plans into complete chaos. I have used the "roughly" method with my kids and it is exactly that "roughly" but it helps. My twins are doing it at the moment and my older children have used this method and it works - "roughly"!
5ieWhvYCaa	yes, i have, from my little brother, it's called being a KID.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Hm, he sounds like me.     When I was 12, I was diagnosed with something called "dyspraxia" which in my view is dyslexia for the body".|`|37PYnKr9aa	Give him a swat on the butt if he keeps picking his nose!|`|661b6942f6dddce43fe2dcb16a5f0068aa	Be a good parent and take the child to a doctor.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Did you google tourettes?  That sounds NOTHING like tourettes.     Tourettes is the disease where you have No control over your central nervous system and you scream out inappropriate things. It sounds like your child has other issues.     Try telling him not to pick his nose. Take him to a pediatrician if he has facial ticks etc.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	Some of it sounds like a normal child (I chewed on my clothes, twirled and chewed my hair, chewed my blanket, etc. but I outgrew it and nothing was ever wrong with me.  It was how I calmed myself down if I was stressed about school or something at home, or I did it sometimes if I was tired or bored).  But the other parts sounds like a food sensitivity.  You have noticed some behaviors linked to foods, as we did with my son.  It is just after 6am and I am regretting our decision yesterday to allow the kids each a happy meal after 4 months without one.  The kids are not even 2 and 3 yet and they have been for almost 2 hours already and are driving me nuts not listening!    The other food sensitivity my kids have is salicylates.  This is an asprin-like compound found in many fruits and a few vegetables and a few other natural items!  We were giving these to the kids thinking nothing of it because they were such healthy items we didn't know that some kids are sensitive to them and have behavioral symptoms.  They are found in all berries, apples, tomatoes, etc.  I would research it and see what you think and try the Feingold Diet and see what happens.  If no improvement, I would then see a doctor.|`|HVWAq4u9aa	Honestly, this sounds like something better discussed with his doctor.  It's sounds pretty scary.  I wonder though, if it might be more like obsessive compulsive disorder than tourettes.  If it's anything at all, that is.  I would just talk to his doctor, even if it's just to settle your mind.|`|kWvkaddFaa	Compulsive Obsessive disorder, it happens - it is like mild cravings for smokes... u can control it, but u ll feel really anxious and tense...  but if u manage to break the habit in a few days - it wont come back...  usually requires strong will, sense of how silly he is thinking etc...|`|df56317200b43fc902cf6236360f3a4daa	Although it's okay to tell him to stop picking his nose, it is VITAL that you do not tell him to stop the other stuff, as the increased attention to it and the self-consciousness it causes will only make the likelihood of it disappearing far less likely. By it, I mean possibly Tourette's, which it really does sound like it could be. However, if you don't make a big deal about it, it can even go away someday. My Tourette's started about age 5 and my parents made a big deal about it and the feelings of self-consciousness, i think, made it far worse.
bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	I promise you it gets easier.  Just keep telling yourself that this baby isn't going to be breastfeeding when he goes to college right.  Obviously it will settle down at some point, the question is when???  Well at 4 weeks a lot of babies don't have a routine yet.  By 3 months they tend to more so.  Just keep persevering as you know it's the best for your baby.    Remember that not every cry means hunger.  Try other things too - change diaper, put on a blanket, turn down noise, is the light too bright, etc.  Also try a pacifier this might help sooth the baby when he's looking for soothing not milk.  The rest of the time, just feed him and realize that in a few months these hard days will only be a faint memory.    Also, it's helpful to remember that babies go through growth spurts where they feed more often.  Typically around 3-4 weeks is a growth spurt, so that may be a factor right now too.    Keep up the good work - it's hard to stick with breastfeeding but it is the best gift you can give your baby!|`|R1zUIh7taa	What about pumping would he take a bottle of breast milk?  He is obviously hungry, maybe at your next doctor's appointment you could ask them if they think he is eating enough!  And really every baby is different, he may need to eat every hour until he gets a bit older!|`|DS9NLiaBaa	is he biting? if he is then give him a dummy to chew on when you are not breast feeding and i think yes, it will be easier!|`|t1fx6kXcaa	For 4 weeks, your son is actually sleeping quite well. When my son was 4 weeks, I was also feeding every hour but he was only sleeping 2 hours at night before waking for more milk. BUT by 8 weeks, he was sleeping 6 hours (in one stretch) at night, then would wake for a feed and go back to sleep for another three hours. He also went longer between feeds. Sometimes up to 4 hours. Unfortunately at 3 months, he was back to waking frequently at night and was feeding every 2 hours. By 4 months, he was feeding evey half hour and continued to do this until he started solids. However every baby is different. They usually go longer between feeds and sleep longer at 2 months but during growth spurts will wake more frequently and will feed a lot more frequently. All I can advise is to hang in there. I found the first 6 weeks very tough. But my son is now 22 months and still breastfed. The exhaustion and feeling like you are nothing more than a milk machine does pass!   Congratulations on your baby and good luck!|`|nhIb1dmeaa	Due to diff reasons i was onlyu able to breastfeed my 4th child, I was not aware that it takes 6 weeks for your milk to come supply and demand! I thought, that after 4 days your milk came in and then by two weeks it would all be sorted! It takes 6 weeks! Keep going, i remember one night when i thought i fed all night!  If you are exhausted, give him the odd bottle, it wont effect your milk supply! What could effect your milk supply is your exhaustion, keep drinking and eat as well as you can, and rest as much as you can! Keep it up and i promise you even if you have to resort to the odd bottle now, you will soon be exclusively breastfeeding!  good luck! Remember, it is healthier, and cheaper and in the long run SO MUCH EASIER!!!|`|oScgvcjaaa	your doing brilliant babe. im still breastfeeding my 18 month old .  it will get easier.its also more common for baby to want to feed more in the evening this is due to your body releasing a hormone which makes you produce more breast milk . dont worry about routine ,just feed your baby on demand.thats best has baby know best.  when i first started breastfeeding i was told to forget the clock ,and feed baby whenever he wanted feeding .     if your baby is round 4 weeks old they do tend to feed more often has your baby may be having a GROWTH SPURT.    at the age your baby is you should be feeding every 90 mins-2hours (from when you finished your last feed .)if your baby is asleep and goes past 2 hours thats fine ,but try not let baby go longer than 3 hours ,has your baby may start to fuss at the breast ,due to being over hungry. hope this helps . if you need any other  advice email me . b_southern@hotmail.co.uk.    from breastfeeding mum to 18 month old and trained breastfeeding peer supporter .xxx|`|19f922ca9c2b47e3ee7116248c9a73f1aa	It gets easier, then harder again, then easier, and on...  My baby is only 10 weeks old and just when I start to see a pattern it changes.  I know what you mean about wanting to know when the next feeding will be, it's hard to plan anything or get anything else done.  I just try to remember that my main priority right now is making sure my son is fed and taken care of and everything else is secondary.  Also I remember feeling very smothered around 4-6 weeks because he was always wanting to nurse - I felt like he was constantly attached to me and when my husband would try to touch me (just a little hug or kiss or pat on the back) I'd withdraw b/c I was sick of being touched - I hope that makes sense.  Anyway it's better now.  I also started pumping and bottle feeding for one feeding per day around 6 weeks.  Then two bottles a day around 8 weeks.  And now we are working towards 3 bottles a day to prepare for daycare which will begin next week.  We've had a setback due to a huge power outage in our area so now I'm trying to reintroduce the bottle and baby is very clingy.  It's a roller coaster, but very worth it!  Good luck!|`|811921e95b3795dad10075b3f9e12029aa	Sounds like you are doing great!  Things will get a lot easier when you can fit a block of 4 hours sleep into the routine for yourself.  Remember- when baby sleeps so must you, just to keep up! no dancing around the kitchen to put another wash on at 1am.  (well, maybe not all the daytime naps...)      Keep your fluid intake up, and relax into the feeding so your let-down reflex does all the work for you.  You could try having bananas with your tea- the extra sugar in them may pass on to baby in the evening feed and give you more of a break.   Breastfeeding will be helping you slim and toning your inner abdomen muscles at the same time, so stick with it.|`|6JimMvcDaa	Yes, it will get easier. It just takes awhile for your milk to come up to his demands. Eat healthy and don't be stressed. Try to relax.   Don't worry about a routine just be in the moment.        What is natural to one is not the norm for another. Your baby will slow down and you will relax. Don't give up. Before you know it he'll be sitting in a high chair eating cereal and drinking out of a sippy cup.         They grow up so fast and before you know it you're weaning him and missing the breast feeding days. Try just to enjoy bonding with your child and be at peace. I miss my babies. They are both woman now and I have no grandchildren. Enjoy each day as if it is the last.
MuALb7lxaa	Try joining school groups. Do you have a student council? Another group that interests you? Being the new kid is not fun. Most new kids are picked on and thought of as "gay, stupid, retarded, emo" nowadays. I know this, because this all happens at my school with any new kids. Whenever you go to school, smile and look like a really nice person. Don't act like shy, sad, or upset. Right away, they will pick up on that and think something is wrong with you. Just go up to kids in your grade and introduce yourself. It'll take time because they don't know you and they think you are different. Show them you are as normal as they are.|`|GuyFz7ybaa	Be yourself and make yourself known, people will start talking to you and hanging out with you. Somebody new to a circle of friends often feels left out, but not forever.    Things will get better, besides, school is fun compared to the real world, make the most of it.|`|0r3ceXnjaa	I always hear that new kids are picked on, buts it's the opposite at my school - everyone is always wanting to be best friends with the new person.

I know how it feels to be the new kid, too.  you just have to start making more friends, and get to know the community.  at first, you won't feel accepted.  it just takes time to warm up to everyone.  (;      invite everyone out to the park, the mall, etc. or get to know other people at the school.  dont seclude yourself with one group of people--they won't all be accepting of you.      make sure you find good friends and don't settle for less.          good luck.|`|1nGQ5ectaa	well im sure when your a new kid people dont really know you that well so they probaly will try and single you out but later in the year you will probaly find out you will make lots more friends when they get to know you a little better.

You'll do fine, it's just the matter of talking and being social. There's nothing to it. I became known by getting suspended hahaahah.|`|twTRiTcdaa	Being "the new kid" at a school always sucks. Especially if you're from a different state or country.  I know the feeling.  Here's what you can do about these not so welcoming people at the school you are now attending.     FIRST STEP:  Try starting conversations with THEM. I know it sounds kind of scary especially since they didn't exactly welcome you with open arms. But that may make a good impression on them! Recently, a new girl came to my school, and she had only been there for a couple days and she started a conversation with me! I was really suprised by that, and it definatley gave me a good impression about her. If this doesn't work out, then just remember atleast you tried.    SECOND STEP:  Whenever you and the friends you have right now hangout, ask them if they can invite some of their other friends from school so you can get to know more people from your new school. If they agree to this, which I think they will, start up conversations with the people they bring. See who you have things in common with. Even see who the people are that you have nothing in common with! Just mingle around and get to know their other friends. Chances are someone is bound to start a friendship with you.    STEP THREE:   Alright, so you've gotten to know your friends friends, now its time to work up the nerve to make some friends of your own.  Start conversations with people outside of the comfort circle you're used to. Talk to kids in your classes. Talk to other kids in lunch. Get to know more people. Now be aware, that there are always that bunch of kids at a school, that think they are too good for anyone, but you should be able to spot them out.     I hope I helped. I pretty much just gave you some of the things I did when I moved and had to start at a new school.   Good luck! [=
wi4XXfCEaa	There are not designated white baby names and black baby names so whatever you like.|`|67QVKHQ3aa	sahara   jazlyn  kierra  keyonnah  tatiana      also havin a mixed baby but mines a boy i thought the same way, i wanted a name that could be bi-racial...i wanted dante' but my BF didnt like it so we agreed on Xavier...good luck!|`|VGij9p0Taa	Firstly congratulations!  Maybe use a traditional white name like Elizabeth and then something which traditionally a black name like Keisha then combine them so it has a good mix of both cultures. Also maybe, use biblical names as religious names provides a good mix of both cultures because both races (you and your boyfriends) both i assume share the same religion.  Suggestion:-  Elizabeth Keisha   Naomi Ruth  Kisha Grace   Rachel Tianna   Maybe name the child after a famous/historical black person like Rosa Parks then as the middle name use a name of a famous/historical white person like Anne Boleyn or Mary I   suggestions:  Rosa Harriet - Rosa Parks of course and Harriet because this women Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote many books about encouraging the end of slavery.

ebR3nOL1aa	Hi. I aint psychologist to give you advices, but I learned one thing about ADHD. Michael Phelps is the greatest Olympian and we know that. He was diagnosed of ADHD when he was 4 or 5. So his mum asked about what could be the best outlet for his son, and a doctor adviced that swimming is the best outlet for kids like your son. So he enrolled Michael in a swimming lesson and when he reached 23, he grabbed 8 Olympic gold medals in swimming competition. Anyway, it's up to you. I just heard it from Phelps's mother. Who knows your son could be the next greatest Olympic swimmer too after 15 years. :)|`|hKJIDdVqaa	Here is my take: my son is high strung and very active.  We refuse to drug him because ritalin is more dangerous than cocaine.  However we needed to make him focus and be alert and responsible.  I do not believe in ADD or ADHD myself, but I do believe- as studies show children have a deficiency or food allergy that causes hyperactivity or being difficult or unable to focus.  What did I do?  I give my child OMEGA 3 (or Omega 6) and a multivitamin, with zinc, calcium etc. Some remove, dairy, wheat, or artificial preservatives.  Studies show children improve 75% in 6 months of taking these particular vitamins.  it worked for my son in a matter of days.  Some brains lack Omega's and Omega is what makes you focus, makes you smart and makes you calm.  Also children lack very important vitamins and minerals that will also cause undesirable traits.  The fish oil gummies will be no effect.  The fish oil needs to be a 300/500 ratio and very potent with potent ingredients.  The children's gimmes are a gimmick at best with virtually not enough of the Omega to be any benefit.  Talking to a hyper or unfocused child will not help them, they do not understand. And this issue is not a behavioral problem on the parents or child's behalf.  MOST children have a food allergy or deficiency. Enroll your child in sports or other physical activities, my son is 8 and plays basketball, football, baseball ,and ju jit su. Check into the benefits or a good fish oil or OMEGA 3 or 6, and do some research on food allergies....It worked for us.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	sounds like his medication needs to be adjusted. Kids hit a growth spurt around the age of 7 and what he has been on may not be enough. Or you might even consider changing his meds all to gether. After a while, they do build up a resistance to some of the ADHD meds that are out there.    Modify his diet even more, make sure he isn't having any foods with red dye, including drinks. The red dye is very well known for aggravating ADHD. You might not have a choice and need to medicate him. I was against it for the longest time until I realized that I was doing a dis-service to my kids and the other kids in his class. Not only was he not learning, he was preventing other kids from learning and that just isn't fair. Our home life improved dramatically when he started his meds. The kids still fight but it's not like it used to be. There is less screaming, punching etc. They help around the house more often and do get all their work completed. Their grades are good and they are not getting the notes sent home nor going to the principal anymore.|`|YjwnT5Oiaa	you are against medicines, but you are drowning?  if you really want help, you should go to your doctor.  not all medicines are bad.  if you really care about him, you will get him medicated... just because you are against it, doesn't mean it's not needed.  if he was diabetic, would you refuse him insulin because it's artificial?|`|G50ucmllaa	First of all do not allow the ADHD to become an excuse.  I had a 5th grader crawling on the floor (literally).  After giving him the "What are you doing?!" look and asking him to get up off the floor he proceed to tell me in a snotty tone flat out 'Well I have ADHD so..."  He was quickly interrupted by me telling him it was no excuse.  And that he was never to use it as one in my class.    I apologize, I just had to get that out as a teacher.  I am sure your son does not do this, but it can become an excuse for poor work rather than simply something needed to be coped with.  I now teach 1st grade where more active planning is needed and as a result I see fewer with problems.    The privileges and rewards may help to some degree, but you must remember he cannot fully help what he is doing.  I think diet plays a large roll in helping with ADHD, but so does behavior management.  I have a little one in my class who probably has ADHD.  Mom and I are on the same page, I email her everyday to tell her how he was at school and she does the same for me at home.  Constant reminders of what he should be doing helps him a lot, but the best thing that has helped him is a timer.  Its a simple $5 kitchen timer.  I set it on the edge of his desk and tell him he has X amount of time to finish his work.    If the teacher has not already tried this I HIGHLY recommend it.|`|dq04utMoaa	Well my son is in KG and is having issues with behaving.. He told me today while taking him to school "Mom why did you have a son, its hard having a son who does not behaving isn't it?" I wanted to cry... And I told him that God wanted me to have him and No matter what I love him with all my heart.. Now beings that said. He has been misbehaving so much at school it has effected him like this... I believe there is something wrong with my son, What I have no freaking clue, However I think he gets it from me and my husband for sure... And I have found some herbs on line that you might want to give a try. I have ordered mine and I cant wait to see if they work.. Please note that the one link is a money back deal... So even if you are not happy you can send it back...    My heart goes out to you because I know damm good and well it hurts.. and now days schools don't care...    GL|`|Ar6wD9Oeaa	I dont beleive in ADHD or ADD or anything to that effect. I think you need to just sit down and really give him attention. Thats all he wants.  I feel that america makes up "disorders' to accomodate our laziness.  We didn't have such disorders  50 years ago, but now all of a sudden we do.    Spend some one on one time with him and give him the attention he deserves. And you know, Dont be afraid to smack your kid. Every parent is so afraid to give their kid a good A$$ whooping .... if they are misbehaving, teach them not to.  You let them go and get away with everything it's only going to get worse and then you get a 'disorder" labled to them.|`|kWvkaddFaa	I highly reccomend fish oil (omega 3) tablets...  1 or 2 a day with water is really good, u will get results within weeks...    Dont worry i used to be just like that kid, i was the worst in grade 2-4, but since i had a really good teacher who believed in me from grade 5-7, i got better and better...     give it time, kids grow up... and now im acing school (skipped 2 grades, uni when i was 14, A's, music band, basketball team)|`|4h3fbtzHaa	perhaps you could take him to see a doctor, i know you say you are against durgs (which i am as well) but maybe the doctor could give you some pointers on what you should do. My step son has ADHD and the doctor told us to try to encourage him and praise him when he does well, the doctor also suggested us to put him in some sort of sport to exercise some for the energy off, we did and believe it or not it really works. He still has him moments but not near as bad as before we signed him up for baseball.I hope all goes well i know its hard and good luck.|`|aSKsDtwLaa	My son was diagnosed ADD in 3rd grade.  We did not want to give him medication either.  We went to see a family therapist who shared her own family story.  She said that medication opens the door for the therapy needed, but the child does not have to take it forever.    A year later my mother gave me my old school records.  For twelve years every teacher made comments like, "does not work up to potential, does not pay attention in class".  I realized I still felt like that most of the time.  I saw a doctor and now both my son and I are taking Adderall.  When someone is resistant to medication I tell them it is like not giving someone myopic, eye glasses, or hearing impaired, a hearing aid.    Your son is being prevented from making friends, enjoying school, and (apparently) privileges at home.  And it's not all his fault.  You are punishing him, but not helping him.    Once you have opened the door, come join us on adhdparentssupportgroup@yahoogroups.com.  We have lots of tips on getting homework (and other stuff) done, (timers and alarms are key!).  Communicating with your son and the school.  Using positive reinforcements along with firm discipline to guide him.|`|6H5zemK4aa	I, like you, have a 7-yr old son with ADHD. During his kg and half way through 1st grade, I was constantly have meetings with his teacher.  Also like you, I was dead set against putting him on any medication.  Then one day (with as little homework as he had in the 1st grade) I actually realized that it would take him from the time he got home until it was time for bed to finish said homework.  (The only break he had was to eat!)  I finally realized that I needed to do what was best for him and put my feelings aside.  I found a great doctor, who understood my feelings, and she works with the medication that he is on. (Adderall).    It has also been explained that he CAN grow out of this, and that by middle or high school he can work this out.  By then he will learn better self control, and won't need the mediciation.    Most people don't realize that there are many different medications out there, and they're not as bad as you would think.  Also I found some multivitimians called Feed My Brain. My son takes 2 of these a day along with his medication.  This year his grades have greatly improved, he's now taking more time with his reading, and has started work word search puzzles.      Trust me I know how you feel. I've been there.  If you'd like you can e-mail me any time and I will try to help.
gb9REJN4aa	She will be completely fine.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	She will be fine, but tell your neighbor if she ever does it again you will call the police.|`|T0pkW783aa	I know this was a frightening experience but the small amount of liquor on the ice will not hurt your infant.  Some people have such bad judgement and it seems as if this neighbor is one of those people.  I would let her know that you were disappointed with her behavior and that nothing is given to your child without your permission.  (Not sure if drinking was the factor or if she always does things like this.)  I would also be very sure not to have her around your child especially when she is drinking, unless you are there to supervise.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	your baby will be fine but i agree about slappin the neighbour|`|WvWFmwQoaa	she will be ok now but in future i would watch your neighbor very carefully she is probably not aware of what she cannot do..|`|JQZDCcyQaa	She will be fine- did you slap the neighbour? I would have|`|BcjFssaEaa	yeah she will be fine.  just slap ur neighbour tho xxx|`|AWm2zhyLaa	wow. thats crazy but i think your baby will be fine. people have put liquor on babys gums when their teething so i dont really think it would hurt ur baby. but maybe the neighbor shouldnt be alone with children.|`|RASHyqM7aa	Hello. I think she will be alright, but just to be on the safe side take her to the doctor. We mothers stress over everything :) I know how you feel trust me.|`|8UfyHwklaa	She'll be fine, don't worry.    Actually, and this is to put you at ease, some people actually rub vodka on their children's gums to null the pain from their teething. I wouldn't do that of course, but it's been done.    So yeah, a little scotch-covered ice won't hurt her. Don't worry!|`|LgYRrucuaa	Your baby will be ok.  It has been well documented that people have given their babies a little bit to help them sleep,  the ice will just feel cold to the baby, the worst that could happen is a little belly ache, but it is unlikely, your baby will be fine.|`|b6LcC0CEaa	She will be absolutely fine.. my mother used to put liquor on my gums as a baby when I was teething (its an old wives tale I think). Just keep that neighbor far away from your baby in the future.|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	What microscopic amount of scotch that got into your baby's system won't hurt her.  As someone else said in these answers, some liquor has medicinal purposes.  When my daughter was learning to walk, she would sometimes fall down against whatever she was holding on to.  One time she busted her lip on our coffee table.  We had some whiskey.  Dabbed a little bit on her lip a few times and it healed good as new.  The drop or two of whiskey my daughter swallowed each time we doctored up her busted lip didn't hurt her at all.  Scratches, sores, etc. on the outside of your body you put whatever medicine,  You can't put that same medicine on the inside (such as baby's mouth or lip).  Whiskey, or other "medicinal" liquor is meant to go on the inside of your body.  So a drop or two of whiskey works wonders!!|`|GclagLJkaa	your neighbour is a nut!!! your baby will be fine, but i would strongly advise against having that neighbour left along with your baby ever again...especially if she is drinking.  so sorry that this happened to you and your baby.|`|4vxPi8Owaa	What is she crazy OMG  The baby will be fine  Just keep watch
8ab40e110856e04b57a0ea78b7f1ea14aa	I would understand your nervousness.. however, I would be more afraid not knowing when my baby was going to be born..  Like if you would wake up in the middle of the night..   With my daughter(7), I went in at 6:30 AM, and they did the meds, broke the water, I ended up getting an epidural, and had her by 2:30.  With my son(10 mths) I was not effaced at all, not dilated, so they took me in at 5:00 Pm on a Wednesday, started the drugs, and by 1 AM on Thursday I was 7 cm dilated, got the epidural shortly after , and by 2:30, he was here!!    My best advice, advice that was given to be by one of my best freinds(at the time) (who had her first baby 2 days before I had my first)  said to me " don't be a martyr, get the drugs, get the epidural" and I did.. .and don't regret a thing!!!!    It certainly didn't slow things down, like others claim it does!!      Good luck, and don't be afraid.. I know, easier said than done.. but as soon as they lay that baby across your chest, nothing else in this world matters... and honestly, I wouldn't lie to you.. there is NO pain, what-so-ever, in your thoughts then!!!        I guess I forgot a few minor details.. both of my babies were a week overdue..  They inserted a capseul in my cervex to start the process.. yes I was constantly monitored, but there was no pain involved,peroid like cramps after the meds started working.. but nothing I couldn't handle.. and the 'real' contractions only started a few hours before I gave birth.. but the good thing is that you know you won't be in labor for endless hours (24 hours, when my Mom had me) becuase you WERE induced!!    Again, best of luck to you!!|`|4JgSq2rlaa	i think ur baby should be soon but i know by be induced it will hurt and will make the labour even more longer so hopefully u will go into labour soon but dont worry labour is not all that bad just dont take the injection in the back(cant spell it) lol try gas and air HELPS ALOT good luck post when uve had the baby xxx|`|deIzFnV8aa	I was induced for our first daughter.  I think I was maybe 4" diliated when they started, but the baby hadn't dropped by 10 days past the due date, so they induced.  The part I didn't like was that I had to be hooked up to an IV and a fetal monitor during all of labor.  It took about an hour to get contractions close enough that were considered "in labor", then about 6 1/2 more hours  before the baby was born. I understand that is actually on the short side. However, the first half of that was very normal feelilng, with few painful contractions. I don't know how typical that is.  My only advice is don't be afraid to ask to walk around despite the IV and such, if that is what you feel like doing.  Most hospitals have portable fetal monitors, so  you don't need to feel confined to your bed, though obviously its a lot more tedious to pace when you are dragging an IV!|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I was induced with both of my boys. With my first it took 27 hours and honestly was a really rough labor... with my 2nd though I was induced at 8:00pm and had him by 4:00pm the next day. (The real labor didn't start until 8:00am the next day. Even then it wasn't that bad... When it comes to giving birth it was a breeze!    You will do awesome. Your doctors know what they are doing and will guide you the entire time.    Best wishes and congrats on your new baby! =)    What are they doing? Cervadil? (sp?)|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	I was induced with 3 of my kids. the 4th came on his own. Somehow I was really lucky. They induced me at 7 am on the first one, and I had him at 11:57 am. The 2nd, they induced at 7 am and had him by 10 am and the 3rd, they induced at 7 am and I had her at 945 am. All of them went really quickly for me. Shortly after they started the inducing, they gave me the epidural and I really didn't feel much of the pain.|`|SlhEgGl2aa	im being induced thurday or friday morning im also nervous myself  ive heard there not that bad maybe u should go 4 the epidural i took it with my first and it was magic i went into labor at 40+1 day im now 41+1 and still nothing lets hope they decide to arrive before then good luck|`|GS9Bz0pAaa	Hey hun .. try not to worry i was induced and to be honest I found it ok.. easier to prepare etc but at the same more scary lol.  at 41 weeks I had a stretch and sweep which wasnt pleasant and that did nothing, Jack was really low down so was booked for induction on the following sunday (2nd november)   They gave me a pessary to ripen cervix and monitored me and baby and contractions etc .. didnt really have much other than really mild period pains, (that was at 9pm)   At 2am they sent me to the ward with some sleeping tablets and pain killers to get some rest and sent fiance and mum home.. They were told to come back in the morning when they would break my waters.    Jack had a different idea though! At 4am I woke up having some "Fabulous" contractions and demanding some pain relief lol Had a bath and fell asleep again in there (oops) due to sleeping tablets!    When i got out the midwife examined me and I had already shot to 8cm :O    So was taken to labour suite where they tried to ring Fiance (who had by this time fallen fast asleep grr!) but I was already at 10cm    No time for any pain relief other than gas and air and the midwife broke my waters, which I never even felt, I asked her if shed done it and she said "Oh yes dear I did that ages ago!" hehe    After 45 min of pushing (which felt like 5!) Jack was born at 5.45am on november 3rd .. 13 days late! Had lots of stitches though and they hurt more than having him IMHO lol    Fiance and Mum finally arrived at 8.50am lol    Was home by 4pm that day    So yes, thats my story :) .. Hope everything goes well for you hun .. wont be long till you have your lo Try not to worry about it too much .. just one piece of advice.. if they tell birthing partners to go home and send you to a ward .. DEMAND that they stay lol    xxxxxx Good Luck! xxxxxx    So yes.. thats my story|`|AA10953561	I've never been induced but I watched my best friend go through it. They tried stripping her membranes, using the cervical pill that's supposed to cause you to thin out and dialate (twice) and nothing happened. So they finally scheduled her to be induced. She went in early in the morning, and the first thing they did was break her water to see if that would encourage contractions. Again, nothing happened. They finally put her on the pitossan (spelling?) drip around 9:30 in the morning. She was in hard labor by eleven in the morning. She still hadn't dialated by 7 that night so she asked for the epidural and about half an hour after they gave her the epidural she dialated all the way. Her daughter was born at 11:02 that night.    She was two weeks over due, by the way. Being induced is pretty painful from what I hear, but once you're dialated it's pretty easy. I would recommend taking snacks for anyone who is going to be there with you if you don't want to be left alone during early labor. Yes, it sucks to see someone eating while you're not supposed to, but it's better than them going out and getting a hamburger and smelling of food when they get back.     Good luck, hon!
4JgSq2rlaa	how old is ur son|`|Uz8BZN6daa	are these online agencies?  Never heard of them.  My kids model in a local agency, very legitimate, they earn when your child is booked for a job and they take a 10% of the pay, so my advice is that a legitimate agency NEVER asks for money up front, so just keep that in mind.
RT3Og4Oiaa	CONGRATULATIONS!!! You are now what we call a MOM!! lol  We all have been there in the beginning. You are not paranoid, you are doing what comes natural...protecting and taking care of your child.    *Yep, sleep deprived, that's sounds right...every lil sound...even if its not your baby, scares you.    *Don't feel bad if you lay him down as he is sleeping, this gives you a few moments for yourself, to sigh, relax, GO TO THE RESTROOM lol. Then if you want after that , pick him up and cuddle.    *Don't worry about having a good ol conversation with him just yet, just nuzzle him, cuddle him and tell him you love him, that's all needs.    * just keep feeding him as you are, and the same with hubby, he will let you know if he is wanting more, just make a 2oz bottle everytime, real soon it will be 3 oz and so on. But they will let you know.     *8-10 wet diapers a day is good and pooping once a day is great..it may slow down soon, but don't worry , that will be normal as well...if he doesn't poop longer then a week, time to talk with the pedi about helping him out.       GOOD LUCK MOMMY!! Your doin fine!|`|3NyM1cq5aa	You're a normal first time mom!  I do hope you find a good ped though, because they will help ease your mind.  I had my baby at the doctor at least once a week, sometimes just to ask questions and get peace of mind.  You might ask about him only pooping once a day though, I think they are supposed to go more often when they are newborns.  Good luck and congrats!|`|OI3bf4yjaa	It's expected for mothers to be paranoid when they just have a baby... especially if they're a first time mother! You're definitely just paranoid.|`|tapFZBowaa	Your not paranoid, your a great mommy.    You will sleep when he is about 8.  And then you will stop sleeping when he turns 13.  And then you will start sleeping again when he is 30.  *sigh* Such is life for a mom!|`|ubf26k2Oaa	I think you re just emotional and normal. You've just been through a major experience and your hormones are all over the place.  Its good that he's sleeping, he needs to sleep..that's when he's growing, but you need to sleep and relax too, so that you can be there for him when he needs you.  You dont have to talk baby talk to him..just talk normally and tell him what you're doing and thinking..he'll just love hearing your voice, it doesn't matter what you re saying.  The light doesn't have to be sunny, just as long as its daylight..that will help his jaundice, also feeding him regularly will help.  Dont worry about thrush, its little white spots in the mouth and as long as you sterilise all the feeding equipment, you'll be fine.  Babies often react and feed differently towards mum and dad..you're not doing anything different or wrong here. And you're not starving him or else he'd be screaming all the time.  You're on a learning curve, you're doing well and its normal to worry..try and relax a little and be kind to yourself.   All the best :)|`|vsFJZRkGaa	your not paranoid - you love your baby and that is perfectly natural and a beautiful thing.    you are not starving your son, he will only eat as much as he needs. babies know when to stop eating -- just think of breastfeeding babies, they stop when they've had enough. Same with formula/bottle feed babies.  sometimes babies eat more at certain times of the day, perhaps thats what is happening when your husband feeds him?  either way its fine, he's weeing and pooing great and sounds just perfect.    you'll see thrush if he gets it, and its nothing to worry yourself over. its just white stuff and or a red bumpy rash in his mouth or in his nappy area. if he gets it you will notice it, just take him to the pharmacy if you are worried about anything at all, they are trained to help you and are so much more available then doctors.    your baby needs that indirect sunlight to help him overcome jaundice. Can you take him to a friends house or something to get that dappled light? if you can't get it, contact your hospital about renting a UV mat for him to lay on. He needs the UV rays.    you aren't neglecting him by letting him sleep in his bassinette. Just think, do you sleep better when in bed with your husband or when you have the bed to yourself? its the same for your little one. but you can never, ever have too many cuddles or too much closeness, so if you want him with you --- do it :)    i dont do baby talk either - but boy oh boy do i talk to my 4mth old baby! i tell him everything i'm doing, i read my books to him (not baby books, but books i'm reading), i talk my way through the laundry, cooking, cleaning etc, I read the tv guide to him, we do puzzles together. whatever you are doing - tell him about it. its an easy way to keep the verbal input going and he will lap it up :)    finding a good doctor is HARD. thank god for the internet to help us stay sane!   :)|`|jYPeis3Saa	no. youre fine.    my son is 15 month old and i STILL check on him a billion times while he sleeps.|`|w3ob12X6aa	ha. i was the same exact way my daughter is 2 months old now. and i never wanted to put her in her crib i just felt bad . and i was in and out of the room checking to see if she was breathing as well. but your doing just fine you never done this before so its ok your just making sure everything is ok with your baby and kaielle my daughter had jaundice too and anytime it was sunny i would just put her swing in front of the window so she could get a little sun every time i had a chance. it will go away soon. and as for the feeding 1 1/2 2 ounces is about right he'll let you know if he is hungry still but good luck your doing great.|`|YpgoGNuXaa	I know exactly what you mean about checking up on your baby to makes sure he's still sleeping. I have a month and half year old and I did it so often when she was born and I go and check on her about every fifteen minutes or so if she is sleeping in her bassinet. I don't think it's being paranoid just conscientious of the risk of SIDS.    BUT if it's interrupting your sleep you should go online and look up risk factors for SIDS if you don't have any of them [[aka you and your husband don't smoke, you lay her on her back, ETC.]] than I would try and sleep as much as you can, getting more sleep will help you relax.|`|ZKm894kfaa	Yes,  you are a typical 1st timer.  Not a big deal, I would be worried if you weren't at least somewhat paranoid.  With my son I don't think I slept more than 2 hours a night (in 5 or 10 minute intervals) probably from passing out because I was so exhausted.  I would stand next to his bassinet and just stare at him making sure he was breathing lol.  As for the doctor, who you children see is your choice.  If you don't like him find another one.|`|AA10145416	yes is typical and no you are not paranoid, its normal to feel like that, i have my second baby and i still have the same fears, hope you find a good doctor for your little one.
Z9RRkD3baa	i am def going natural with this baby too! i did with my first 2 as well... i really havent reserched it much but i feel as though i dont take anything more than tylonal for pain now why would i take some hard core drugs for the birth... it cant be good for the baby. besides it seemed as if my boys were very alert when they were born. also compared to friends and relatives who had epidurals during their nirths it seems as if my labors progressed quicker than theirs... i dont no... i think its the womans choice what they want.... to each their own!|`|Pav5KhmLaa	i had 4 of my 5 children natural, why? well it was easy. the 5 th one was painful and i decided to have the epi. i would tell anyone that is giving birth to try it natural and if it's to much then go for the epi.|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	I had my 2 kids without drugs (only because i'm scared of needles, and yes the needles still freaked me out when i was in labor and in pain) But i remember it not being as bad as i thought it was going to be. By the time it got to the point where i thought i couldn't handle it, it was time to push and for me all the pain went away and it was a relief to push that thing out. I'm still a little nervous this time though lol But i plan on going natural again.    Oh and my son was 8lb 9oz and my daughter was 8lb 5oz|`|AA10624857	My kids are all older now at 29, 27, 24, and 11, but I had natural vaginal birth with each one.  At least with my older 3, going "natural" was much more common than it is today.  There were options for pain control, but it was more common to take a birthing class such as Lamaze.  I think some of it had to do with it was the end of the "hippie" era when going natural was just the thing to do.  When my 2 brothers and I were born, it was during the time when dads paced the waiting rooms smoking like chimneys, moms were pretty much knocked out and when they woke up they had a baby.  I think each generation tends to lean towards doing things differently than their parents.  When my parents were born moms were giving birth at home with no medical interference unless there was a problem.  On a personal level, I am not much on taking medications unless they are really necessary.  Some of the medications used when my older 3 were born could make the baby lethargic which had the potential to make the first breast feeding difficult.  The epidural (back in those days we called it the spinal block) kind of freaked me out to think I wouldn't be able to get up and walk around if I wanted or needed to.  When my last baby came along, it had been enough years since my last that things were considerably changed.  I was offered the option to choose an epidural, but declined it.  I couldn't see the point.  I knew child birth hurt, but you get past it with the help of your husband, your doctor, and the nurses.  I don't have a high pain tolerance, but I wasn't worried about it.  My oldest daughter planned on giving birth without meds mainly because she has a real dislike of doctors, needles, and medications.  She ended up with complications during the labor which lead to accepting an epidural at the advise of her doctor so she could rest.  25 hours after her water broke she couldn't dilate past 8, she was exhausted, developed a fever, and the baby was going into distress so they had to do an unplanned c-section.  I think it's great that there are numerous options so each woman can choose what is best for them since what is right for one isn't necessarily the best for someone else.|`|6Knhikr1aa	My 3 kids were all born at home in water. I chose to have natural birth, because I didn't want to drug my baby. I also didn't feel I needed drugs for myself. I too have a high pain threshold, but more importantly I trust my body and I know it knows how to birth. Your body uses Endorphines to lessen the pain and they are quite effective when you don't interfiere with other things in your system. Also, epidurals can slow labor and cause other problems that lead to c-sections. For me, the water was immeasurably helpful as well. It really lessened the "pain" and helped support my body and it was a very gently birth for my babies. They all came out calm and fully aware. It's important to remember that even if it is painful it is a healthy pain and not only will it be over soon, you'll have a healthy (sober) baby in the end and the pain will be in the past. It really doesn't hurt that bad. Our bodies were made to do this. There were no Obstetrics units or drugs in the garden of eden ;-) Women have birthed since the beginning of humanity without drugs. Medicine is quite helpful when it's needed. IMO it's not needed for childbirth. But every woman should do whats right for her. This is YOUR birth. Whatever is right for you is what you should do.|`|TM3pNz6kaa	I had my daughter naturally no pain relief what so ever, i was sooo proud of myself to have delivered a 10lb 5oz baby in 3 hrs. I would recommend a natural delivery to anyone its more rewarding unless of course you have to have a c-section. I will do it again and again lol if i can|`|kwMA5I1iaa	My mother decided she wanted natural births with her children. She went through with her decision and had my sister and I natural. She knew that it's healthier not to have the epi and wanted to feel the whole experience of child birth.|`|NAzAmFDnaa	I went all natural because I was afraid of being injured.  My sister in law still has partial paralysis in her legs due to a botched epidural.  I also wanted my body free of any drugs that could go into the baby or cause complications.  I know epidurals require alot of IV fluids and can alter your blood pressure.  I changed my mind for a second and begged for one, but I was dialating too fast and couldn't get one anyway.  It all worked out and I had a great natural birth and felt great afterwards.  My baby was so alert and active after being born.  I certainly will plan to go all natural next time.|`|GAMypxIFaa	I was told by every woman i know to have an epi done, not one girl has ever advised me to go natural!

Why would you be concerned about the age difference. That is a great age difference. Are you just bored?|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	I wouldn't worry too much about it.  I have 2 kids that are only 11 months apart and will be having a baby any day now that will be 6 years younger than my daughter and 7 years younger than my son.  I think that having them close together or farther apart both have their down sides and up sides.  Although i LOVED having my 2 kids really close together (and still do) and am really happy that they are in school and i will be having the whole day to spend with the baby.

The best steps you could take are these:  1...stay clam-do not yell or lash back at the child...this does not work and she will not listen.  seat the child In a chair and set the microwave clock or any timer for 3 minutes,stay with the child...this is called time out and can be very discouraging for a child that does not want to sit in the chair...just calmly put her back in the chair......this shows her a consequence and it shows the child that you care.Children in general are a lot of work. they depend on you for everything and even though you are a babysitter you can still be a positive role model for she/he. Its hard work and its not easy but effective....good luck!|`|ej8iwJzqaa	do not,do not,do not give in to her.. no means no !! be stern when needed, and ever more than normal loving when she is an angel    mine is almost 4, and shes a holy terror some days- i would never hit her, but  i have no problem making her "live in time out for about 15 min..no more no less-

a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	We adopted two school age siblings from Liberia almost three years ago.      As far as the process goes, it's a lot of paperwork, a lot of hurry up and wait and the sooner you realize that most if it is simply beyond your control, the better.  Not every government bureaucracy operates like the US (or Canada).      The children have really adapted better than we had any right to expect.  Naturally, there are adjustment issues, some have resolved and some are ongoing, but we have never experienced the "horror stories" that are always in the news when it comes to older international adoptees.  So, they don't like to eat their vegetables or go to bed on time, but nobody's lighting the dog on fire or anything either.      My best advice is make sure you do your research.  There are a lot of pitfalls and a lot of shady practices out there.|`|BTuFtui3aa	I haven't adopted internationally, but there are two resources I think would be helpful for you.    For requirements and procedures, see the US State Department's website. It is up to date and official. http://adoption.state.gov    For information and discussion about ethics, transitions, the emotional aspects, what to expect, etc., I think this site will be helpful. http://informedadoptions.com/    I suggest given both a thorough read, to get a good idea of what international adoption involves.|`|AKJwWqdZaa	I adopted my daughter from China and my son from foster care. I love them both more than I can say. After experiencing both avenues, I firmly believe that it doesn't matter where a child comes from, if they do not have a family who are willing or able to care for them, then adoption is the best option for them. Every child deserves a loving family.    If you decide to go the international route, then you should do as much research as you can on that particular country: everything from the culture and history and traditions to learning the language.    Good luck!!|`|NoUkTQCgaa	http://www.youtube.com/user/adoptedthemo...     http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/opi...     http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2004/...     http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story...    http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/opi...      http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27859660        http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.p...

You can try counseling? I would work on my trust, it'll probably take awhile for you to ever trust a guy again. Maybe all of your trust seems shot. But you're just gunna have to work on yourself and make your self confidence, self worth, and trust back    Goodluck!|`|Nn63rf9Eaa	I'm sorry to hear about that. But anyways, you've taken the first step by getting it out there and not keepoing it locked up inside. And you've taken the second step by getting away from him (You are away from him, right?). So now maybe you could talk to someone about it. Things like that leave sort of an imprint on life that never goes away. But jsut because it doesn't go away, doesn't mean it can't get better. As hard as it is, you might ave to talk to someone and tell them everything, every single little thing. Mak sure it all gets out, then you can start to forget. You have it off of your chest, and no matter what, you're still going to go through life and have to deal with the past. So as hard as it is, you have to sort of a ccept what happened, well accept the past. Be glad that it's over and start fresh. Wash yourself clean of him and start over, a clean slate.

Were you my daughter, I'd be sending you nice letters from jail after what I did to him.     Your question about guys and feelings is irrelevant when using this piece of human trash. Yes, men are from Mars and Women are from Venus. However, your exboyfriend is from a place not even the dirtiest sewer rats would go. I am ashamed to even be the same gender as him.     To move forward, you need support. Not just from your friends and family, but from others like you. There are tons of online support groups for women who have been raped and/or have escaped from abusive relationships. I suggest you start there. There are plenty of women out there who have been through what you have been through, some even worse.     Best of luck.|`|4rA9hhQ2aa	counciling?!|`|VEnVl264aa	Sounds like you need to contact the police and have this guy put away.

PLEASE go to the police though also!
6Knhikr1aa	Absolutely not! You have breasts for breastfeeding ;-)  Bottles simply interfiere with the natural order of things. Nursing is very symbiotic. Your body knows exactly what your baby needs at any given time and adjusts accordingly. And makes more or less milk, depending on how much she is nursing. You don't need bottles unless you are planning to pump or formula feed. But if you are just planning to nurse ( which is best) you don't need bottles. It's ok to be the only one who feeds her. Daddy and other people will bond with her in different ways. Nursing is a very special bond and there is more to it than just food. It will be your baby's comfort and what keeps her from getting illnesses and what helps her drift off to sleep and theres even special hormones in there to relax you! You will LOVE it. If you feel like you will need help, or if you have more questions, e-mail me. I can help you and promise not to undermine your nursing with bottle suggestions ;-)|`|iH2whFkHaa	It's good to have bottles And a breast pump so you can have even just a small stash in the freezer in case something happened. you never know; what if you got sick and had to have medications that caused you to be unable to breastfeed while taking them? Babies do also have nursing strikes which means they refuse to nurse perhaps because of an ear infection or teething; I'm sure women back in the day hand-expressed milk in those situations and gave it in a cup but why risk spilling your precious milk all over the place by having it in a cup. Or , worst case scenario, what if something serious happened to you and you had to be hospitalized?    Better to be prepared just in case . But when they get to the age when they start drinking juice or water they are already able to drink out of sippy cups.     JUst be sure whatever bottle you choose is BPA free :)    ******JUST to clarify I'm not saying you should supplement with formula in those situations--but rather pump milk, store in the freezer and save it for emergencies :)  Nothing against formula but supplementing will cause your supply to drop.|`|68c6B8dRaa	No, no, no, and no. Plenty of mothers never use bottles (or breast pumps) at all. I've never used a bottle; seems much easier, to me, to avoid them entirely.    Baby can start using a regular cup when s/he is up for something besides milk.    Useful:    http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/is-pu...    _Do_ comb through the entirety of that site, too -- very useful, and the knowledge will be much more helpful at 3am than a bottle.|`|7HzfgRmwaa	I think Dr. Brown's are good. I have bottles but not because I plan to use them soon.     I plan to breastfeed exclusively for the first 4-8 weeks and then introduce the bottle so other people can feed him too sometimes and so I don't always need to be there. But I don't plan on doing that until closer to 4-8 weeks.     I think having bottles is a good idea incase things don't go as planned... Ex. maybe the baby won't latch or your milk doesn't come in or whatever else may prevent women from breastfeeding. Good Luck!|`|4TNavgDuaa	I would keep some on hand. If you ever need to go anywhere you will have it. Yes Dr.Brown is good.|`|b71BxLUZaa	It is a good idea. You may need a break, or you may have to leave your baby for a while, so it is a good idea to be prepared :)    They do make bottles for breastfeeding babies too, in case you decide to buy some.|`|dc628c84ed9b9f2f5bfb75b116f5d31caa	yes just to be on the safe side|`|ej8iwJzqaa	you should buy bottles.. what if you want to go out for a night w/out being mom, and someone else has to do the feedings??    try and get a bottle w/ a natural, or more specific to your childs needs- the newer babies need the more pointed nipples.. older chidren can use whatever type of nipple they will take|`|deIzFnV8aa	I do breastfeed, but I also pump enough for one bottle a day for our DD. I want to be able to get away a bit if I want, or have a backup in case I ever need medication that would hurt baby.  Plus, it is super great to have my husband able to give a night feeding sometimes! It was easiest to get her to learn to take a bottle at 1 month, so we started DD then instead of waiting until it was needed. Many women don't pump, however, and get by just fine.  Also, many babies go directly to sippy cups for juice and such.      Just to mention it, our DD has  no problem with breastfeeding at all times except her one bottle. It hasn't harmed her nursing at all, so I don't see it as a big thing to avoid, as some people here seem to.    If you do get bottles, you will need 5 oz size up to 5-6 months and bigger ones after that.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	Pumping breast milk is convenient to let daddy or other people(who will be watching baby while you are gone) to feed your baby if you start training your baby to take bottle. Mine does not take bottle so no one can feed her except me so I always have to be with her(she's almost 8 month old now).    I pump it out anyways and store to mix it with solid food instead of mixing it with water or formula. In the beginning, my milk was producing so much milk so it was hurting so I had to pump it out. I think it's good to own at least a hand pump(it's not expensive).    I own Avent bottle set. I like it because it can turn into a sippy cup for baby to drink water or milk so you can use the bottle as a cup & to freeze or store.     I have many other bottles because I was trying to let my baby to take bottle & trying out different types of nipple. Dr. Brown's nice but if your baby does not like it, then it's not worth it.     Decide on which pump you'll buy first & then buy the bottles to go with it. Don't buy too many because you may need to try other types anyways.|`|AA11903503	I breastfeed, but I pump once a day so that Dad can give a bottle. Since I will be returning to work and will not be available for EVERY feeding I knew my baby would need to be introduced to the bottle.  As much as I love breast feeding I also love seeing my husband get to experience a similar feeding bond with our son...they are able to have a special time just their own once a day.  Dr. brown's are good bottle, however there are just way too many piece for me personally. I am using Avent bottles now.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	just my opinion...yes have a couple...an a manual breast pump,only because you wont be doing it everyday...but for back up if you have to leave  them with someone....and you could keep a couple cans of formula just incase,you dont have to use any of these things but would be handy to have....as far as bottles...my sistern law used dr.browns but eventually switced to something easier like the avent ones i think....i plan on breast feeding also but have purchased all these things for back up...i purchase playtex drop ins...i always had luck with those...and ther convieient|`|bd5ca4564ee33749d2a59d4dca6d0270aa	The problem with buying bottles when breastfeeding is the temptation to use them if breastfeeding turns out to be frustrating. The more you use the bottle and suppliment the harder to get breastfeeding to work. Even though supplimentation seems easier at the time because the baby calms it doesn't fix the problem. I made that mistake with the first two of my kids. With this one I did have bottles but no formula on hand. She's had nothing but breastmilk and only twice have I given her a few oz in a bottle. HOWEVER, I'm not opposed to formula.     So it really the decision you need to make is wether you truly want to only breastfeed or not. How important is it to you? Now I need the bottles myself because I'll go back to work in 2 weeks and am already pumping a supply.    My suggestion would be to wait to buy the bottles. Give breastfeeding a try with none of that temptation there to sabotage your progress. Too many woman assume that because breastfeeding is natural it's also easy. That isn't always the case. Once you have established the breastfeeding and have a good latch, then buy some bottles and start to slowly introduce them with breast milk. I would wait 6 weeks only because those are the hardest when breastfeeding. If you can manage the first 6 weeks usually you are all set. Anyways this is longer than I planned. I hope I helped. As for the brand name, I've never used them and I'm not picky about my bottles. I just have the old fashioned evenflo and gerber ones myself.

85JjEHU1aa	Go to a clinic ...they can help as long as you are over 26 weeks. You should be ok...Now...when there is cramping and bleeding ...then be alarmed...but still go check it out. Don't take chances with your baby.|`|VUIEnZpnaa	No, if your sure its not contractions then theres nothing to be worried about. If it's the babys health your worried about im almost SURE it'll be fine if you haven't done anything like drank alot (of beer).

Its just stretching pains and its very annoying really. I went to the doctor because i thought something was wrong but bub is healthy and its just stretching pains.Try taking some panadol for the pain and it should go away soon. If there is any blood that comes, go get checked out asap. Good luck and congrats|`|gBW2J0Upaa	i have the book what to expect when your expecting and it states that when you get cramps of such, it your uterus and muscles stretching getting ready for labor...|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey,    Speak to your midwife or carer could be most likely Braton hicks contractions.    godbless x
G9ywiLqvaa	i'm hoping 'ig' means iguana because i'll be making a total fool of myself if it's not.  lol!    yes, iguanas are kinda tactile creatures.  they know you by touch and not by how you look.  our python is exactly like that --but we never used gloves on him so he's sorta used to our bare hands.    but the way you touch him with or without gloves should be the same.  to make it more obvious to your 'ig', why not create a pattern when you handle him?  make it the first thing you do when you touch him, like a 'hello' sort of thing.  do this pattern when you're wearing gloves, and then again when you're not.      eventually, he will relate the patterned 'hello' handling to you rather than the feel of the gloves.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	whats ig?|`|13151c38f2d09c234f3ddce9fb26c97baa	Inspector General?  Imperial Guard?|`|Hl7OvXruaa	im going to guess iguana.. yea hes used to the gloves.. just slowly start handling him without the gloves if thats what u want him to get used to|`|ZpmZy03maa	Inspector Gadget? How about you use your extend-o arm and just grab him.
ng3A9Pgqaa	Yes I've seen it...I saw the Silent Scream like a previous answerer said. Most women probably don't know or don't want to know. But there are women who feel as if they need it because they don't have anything to provide for the child/aren't ready for it and they don't feel like going through adoption, so they don't really think about the actual abortion, but rather their life after it. I was forced to have one and had I known ahead of time what would be done, I probably wouldn't have done it. It's so inhumane. But I don't look down on women who have had them because it's their life, not mine.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Did YOU know that the vast majority  of abortions are done in the first trimester,  (usually before 8 weeks) when this is a completely  INaccurate  picture of the procedure? An embryo the size of the tip of your finger doesn't need to be 'ripped apart' or 'crushed'.|`|ROJans2Taa	i've never had an abortion, nor would I, but yes I know how they do it, I watched a video on an actual abortion called the silent scream, never forgot the image.|`|85JjEHU1aa	Its nasty. they're like the size of a quarter but human.|`|mFC2RBL3aa	Yes it is sick. I don't understand why someone can just get an abortion.|`|VwxzEkLnaa	when its late and the baby is almost developed they will drill a hole in the back of their had and suck of the brain the throw the baby away|`|NysFTExhaa	Yes, but that's also done in ligit procedures such as late term miscarriages.  Over 50% of abortions are done in the first trimester which they do not do that procedure but rather will vacuum or scrape the uterus lining because the embryo is so small.   I have never had one and probably never will but do believe in the right for others to make that decision, I understand I don't know what's best for others.|`|QQI4rliYaa	its sick and done up intill 28 weeks ......sicking
7EOLTC20aa	Check out this website below...it allows you to search your states adoption laws and gives you all kinds of useful advice.  If this site doesn't work, go to Yahoo! and type in "adoption of child by step parent" and do a search.  It will be the first search result under the blue box.      Good for you stepping up and wanting to be the father figure in this child's life.  It sounds like you really love this little one and will be a much better father figure than what the biological father is!!!|`|zLoyo24Taa	You could, but it might be easier once you are married. The first thing that has to happen is the father has to sign off on his parental rights.|`|V6vAvs0Yaa	First off, bravo for stepping up and being a father for this little tyke. You make me proud to be a man, and you should be too.     Depending on your state, it may be easier for you to adopt him after the two of you are legally married. However, the soon to be ex father of this child will need to relinquish his parental rights (especially if his name is on the birth certificate).     Just make sure you approach it with the argument that if he signs you won't come after him for child support. The last thing you need ruining your happy blossoming family is some jerk suddenly deciding that "its his god damn kid and not yours."     Depending on your situation, it might be best for your fiance to handle the details.|`|cUfOnldzaa	You should start finding a lawyer to help you.  I'd wait until after the marriage to get it done, but you can get the process started.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Short answer... maybe.  If he truly does sign his rights over to you, you can start the proceedings there.  I know you say he wants to, and I hope this goes smoothly for everyone involved.    Depending on the state you live in, there are requirements for step-parent adoption.  You may have to wait a certain amount of time after being married beforehand.  In some states you have to be married a year before that can happen.  I would consult a family law attorney in your area straightaway.  There are many online resources for matters such as this.  I would start searching and find someone who can help you in your area asap.    Good luck, and congrats on your little ones!|`|hHEMhPZyaa	You can, but the process is much more complicated and takes a lot longer. Most judges won't consider it until you've been married at least a year.
mMZo0Tbbaa	There is a really strong possibility!!!  Relax the more you think about it the more your symptoms will come true.   take a hpt as soon as you possibly can.  BEST OF LUCK!|`|O2exQGxgaa	wow..... if you don't even know if you could be, then you shouldn't be having sex at all|`|hZWup7xXaa	its alsways possible to be pregnant when you have sex, protected or unprotected. get a pregnancy test they cost around $15-$20 and it is not to soon to take one. or you can go to the doctor, i find the doctor is better as they are more positive. hope this helps|`|VESdMODnaa	You probably are...|`|QQI4rliYaa	kNoCkEd Up|`|xjWXWEUeaa	u are expeccially witout protection how old are u
T6nmD3X9aa	please excuse my daughter from gym class 2/5/09 due to severe back pain. Thanks, blah blah|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i would type that you were having back pains and needed to refrain from PE that day...|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Tell your Mom to handwrite it so it doesn't look fake. Just tell her that your back hurts so you really don't want to have to do gym tomorrow. Ask her to write a note for you and in the mean time, do you do a lot of sports? You probably need to see a chiropractor for an adjustment. Call around and see if you can get a good price. Honestly if you tell your gym teacher you hurt your back they are going to excuse you themselves.|`|618d6176d8533769ef7d61342adb7d16aa	goto your doctor..or the school nurse before class......she can excuse you....|`|7SKVCPcSaa	"*your name here* is having personal problems today and I want her to be excused from gym.    thank you,  mom"    thats all it needs to say. if your mom says you don't have to do gym and sends a note, then thats that.. your gym teacher will call your mom to check on the notes legitness... lol. os have her provide a phone number where to reach her.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Why not tell the truth?|`|8KZ7HKgvaa	I always got my mom to say that my asthma was acting up when i didnt want to goto gym|`|WnM9I4xtaa	just have your parents say that your cramps are bothering you really bad and until you can get to a doctor for medical assistance you cant participate in gym|`|EAqs9586aa	My mom used to do it all the time for me.     "To whom it may concern:   Please excuse Mindy from Gym today due to personal reasons"    thank you.|`|xPx6OUmFaa	you got cramps and you're on your period. simple! trust me i've used it before!!!    please excuse my daughter from p.e., she is have severe back pain and her doctor highly recommends that she not exert herself for the next week.|`|pIBOSkfsaa	just have it say , i give permission for my child to be excused from gym class.  .That's it  any other details are none of the teachers business.|`|XfJrheFnaa	sweetie periods start, Get used to it. Take a Tylenol for your back and suck it up. Life happens, and Gym won't kill you.     Although if you really need a note ask your parent/ Guardian to write you one. They'll know what to say. I think your trying to make a fake note to get you outta gym, and I'm not gonna help you with that.|`|hZf8aJkYaa	cramps  back pain  stomach pain
FLpMShKNaa	A friend of mine went thru withdrawal when she had custody of her grandson. IN his case, he had to have morphine and gradually wean off because the withdrawal was so extreme. He is healthy and normal now at 11 mos. You should probably contact a pediatrician, they could advise you.  One thing that might help if he/she is jittery is a miracle blanket-you have to order them online or got o a specialty store but they make a very tight swaddle that's very soothing. Also, as much touch and comfort as you can give really helps, my friend's grandson was in the danger zone in the NICU because she lived hours away and couldn't come see him, when she took a leave of absence so she could hold him much more things improved-sure you are already doing that, but it will make a difference.  What a tough thing for you-I hope the baby improves.|`|871bf9188469fa10404159e74fc6200caa	My god that is horrible, the best thing you can do for the baby is to get to a doctor he/she needs to be weened off the drugs so it does not cause stress and hurt them|`|6hllX7nCaa	did you tell the doctor? if not you should bring the baby to your doctor that the mother took these drugs though out her pregnancy, and they'll will give the baby some medicine to not want the drug any more because the baby is addicted to what the mother took and now baby wants more|`|ej8iwJzqaa	you need to go to a pediatrician and ask advice.. a child will get to know and be comfortable with you EVENTUALLY... you need to look into a support group as well so you can keep your sanity|`|stUzx5VVaa	You need to let the ped know, it is not fair to the child to make them go through withdrawal without help.  Social services will not automatically terminate custody, but they can give resources to help your niece stay clean and help protect the child if she can't.  It is unethical and immoral to know about this child's suffering and not tell anyone.
c490676d02a8b133e7a6143969ba0116aa	It could be early or (hopefully) your dates are off. Also, machines can be wrong. It happened to me.    For peace of mind, I would go to ER. By now there should be a heartbeat. They may not do an ultrasound but possibly use a doppler to hear the heartbeat. Have your blood tested as well. That is the best way to determine if this is a viable pregnancy. If you don't want to go to ER, demand another hCG test to see if it is doubling appropriately.    I had a missed miscarriage last month (Different from a miscarriage). We saw our peanut's heartbeat at 7 weeks. I started brown spotting the following day. Just a little. I did not have any cramping. About 3 days later I had a total loss of symptoms. What scared me the most is (TMI) my breast went back to pre-pregnancy breast. They were no longer dark and my nipples were not as big. I went back for a scan at 9 weeks and there was no longer a heartbeat or growth. I completed the miscarriage two weeks later.     Women spot during pregnancy and women lose symptoms during pregnancy. They are both very common. What is not so common is a combination of the two. Spotting AND loss of symptoms is a symptom of a missed miscarriage. But, some women have no symptoms.    I pray things are okay for you.|`|AGcwdZGmaa	yes you should go back i seen all of my kids heart beats at 5-6 weeks i had a missed m/c i was 12 weeks but my baby passed at 9 weeks and they could tell by the size and that there was no heart beat don't leave until you know for sure your baby is okay i didn't get craps or bleeding until 12 weeks even though my angel passed at 9 weeks i hope everything goes good for you   good luck|`|gieEWY1Qaa	Personally I would go to the ER. Just to ease your mind at least. Altho if you had a miscarriage you would feel a lot of cramps and there would be bleeding. I would go to the ER and get checked out.       Good Luck|`|AA12032374	I find another OBGYN. Sounds like you are seeing a "quack". I would try asap to get into another doctor, if that is not possible, go to the ER and let them know all of your issues.|`|F0nJbK53aa	Oh how horrible!  Go see a doctor who has time for YOU and your little baby!  I'd call an ob/gyn from a different medical place, explain what has happened, and see if they can see you right away.  Second opinions are always for the better.    Good luck sweetie!  I'll be praying for you.|`|LLXozwiTaa	1st go to the ER i was two months when i lost my baby i stop feeling my pregnacy symptoms when i was a month an a half. go to the er and tell them everything thats going on with you ask them for an ultrason they should hear the heart beat by now. 2nd change your ob doct he/she is not doing her/his job right they should be there when you need them and not ignor you..... good luck|`|xH3cIAuxaa	I hope everything works out okay for you.  I have to be honest.  Going back to the ER or your doc over and over again isn't helping.  IF you are in the process of a miscarriage, there is nothing they can do to stop it.  I know it's not what you want to hear but it is the truth.  When I was 14 weeks I was in a car accident and was worried about miscarriage and it's the same thing the ER Doc told me.  For weeks after, I felt no symptoms.  I had been feeling movement which seemed to stop after the accident....it freaked me out, but I had to calm down and wait till my next appointment, at which point I found everything was okay.  Worrying is increasing your risk.  You have been told several times that everything is fine.  And if it wasn't, like I said it can't be stopped.  I know it's easier said than done, but try to stop worrying so much and talk to your OB next appointment.
