20090226181920AAOsRxd	Travel;United States;Other - United States	Nation-wide trip + Canada! Must-see places?	This summer, a friend (maybe more) and I are going to travel across the US and through Canada (his home country). I live in the VERY southern part of California, but I have seen up to San Fransisco, so we will start by heading east/north-east.      This will take most likely many weeks, so out of the way isn't really out of the way. =P      So my question is: Where have you been that you absolutely loved and think that I should visit? Please just don't put the city or attraction, tell me why it is so great. Feel free to tell me about your experiences, too! =D      Thanks everyone! I will be making a blog about this whole trip, and I will be sure to mention all the help I get from everyone who posts!      PS: I'll be 18, so places like Vegas may not be the best choice. =P (But I have been there and it is amazing!)

20090226221009AASvIyh	Travel;Australia;Other - Australia	Some fun stuff to do in a road trip?	Ok, I'm 14 years old (turning 15 soon) and my best friend and I have a lot in common and we have decided that after we graduate, we are going to take a road trip around Australia. We are going to every capital city (apart from Hobart) and anywhere else that we want (too many places to name) We are then going to apply for a job at Sea World, as performers, we do magic and whether we get that job or not... I'm going to university and getting a bachelor of animation. So, we are going to have a fun time, doing anything we want really.      Now my question to you is: What are some fun stuff we can do? And I don't want car games, (unless they're really cool) Here, for example, are 2 things that we are going to do:      Dress up as The Hitcher from The Mighty Boosh, and run around town talking and acting like him (HOW FUN WOULD THAT BE!)      Also, order a McDonald's meal with a megaphone hahaha

20090226224421AAb3hAq	Travel;Travel (General);Other - Destinations	I want to bring an item into the USA, but not sure if I'm allowed...?	I'm in the Philippines and they use a special 'gun' for fishing. It shoots a dart at a fish which is tied to a string. It uses a CO2 cartridge to launch the dart.       I'm flying back to the USA soon and want to know if I will be permitted to return it with me. I have checked the US Customs website and it doesn't say anything about bringing any type of firearms (which I find kinda odd) and the Korean Airlines website doesn't help either.       I'm not asking if it is legal to USE it in the USA, I'm sure in most cases I am not except for on private property.      Somehow, I think as long as it is packaged without any 'explosive' and unloaded of course, I should be able to bring it. Hopefully someone who has experience in these matters can help me here. Thank you very much.

Je suis parti voir ma famille en Fr vendredi matin très t?t. Ils ont placé des panneaux de stationnement interdit ce vendredi, valables à partir de ce lundi matin et pour quelques jours. Je suis rentré dimanche soir tard. Ce matin, ils étaient sur le point d'enlever la voiture.Je dois payer 70e au remorqueur.La police ne m'a pas signifié d'amende.Mais les ouvriers qui avaient demandé le placement de ces panneaux d'interdiction me réclament de payer l'heure et demie pendant laquelle ils n'ont pas pu travailler.Je ne sais pas encore combien ils réclament.J'ai tel à la police, la procédure normale serait qu'ils passent par le tribunal.Les ouvriers me proposent de payer sous la table. Que faire? Quelqu'un à une idée?

20081107200030AAhsLFi	Travel;Asia Pacific;Japan	People who have been high school foreign exchange students in japan.?	I am wanting to take my junior year of high school in japan. I was wanting details from people who have been foreign exchange high school students in japan.  I have a lot of questions to ask. I know some of these questions vary from the school and town, but I just want a basic idea.  So, here is a list.      How much was your enrollment in the school?      How much was the uniform?      Did you enjoy staying with a host family?      Do you make a lot of friends?      Do you need to be very fluent in the language?      Do girls have to wear bloomers during gym or just shorts?      Are the high school physicals bascially like those in america?      They aren't mean to you at school because you're foreign are they?      What things do they consider rude that americans do?      Umm...I think that is all I can think of right now....I would love additional details.  Any information I can get is fine XD. I would love to hear a story about anything that you think i might find interesting about japan. Please dont answer to this question if you have never been to a japanese high school. Thank you.
20081108102109AAFjjqb	Travel;Asia Pacific;Japan	How is it possible to be a High school exchange student in japan if the school years start at different times?	I am wanting to go to japan my junior year for either a semester or the whole year,but i was kinda confused.  Since the school year in japan starts in April and the school years in america generally start in August then how does that work?  We can't just leave our school early to go to a japanese school cause then you would never graduate the grade you were in right?  And if you want to go just a semester do you have to start when a new semester starts in japan or just when your semester starts and stay there for half the year? I am really confused and I woud appreciate the help. Thanks!
