7ObGOaPPaa	ok so you have a 2 channel amp. if you want to bridge it you will get the most power out of it. those first 2 ratings:<br>  100x2@ 4ohms RMS POWER <br>  200x2@ 2ohms RMS POWER <br>  are for each channel of the amp. so if you hook up one subwoofer to one channel then at 4 ohms it will get 100 watts and at 2 ohms it will get 200 watts. the 3rd rating: <br>  400x1@ 4ohms RMS POWER <br>  is what the amp puts out when both channels are bridged together. if you only want to use one subwoofer then you will want a single voice coil (svc) 4 ohm subwoofer. if you use a subwoofer with a lower impedance and bridge the amp you will damage it.<br>  <br>  If you want to use 2 subwoofers then you may want to go with 2 dual Voice coil (dvc) 4 ohm impedance subwoofers,<br>  OR<br>  2 SVC 2 ohm impedance subwoofers. that will let you get the most power from your amp.<br>  <br>  as for the brand kickers are fine. others to look for are pioneer, rockford fosgate, infinity, kenwood. those are probably the easiest to find since they are at circuit cities and best buys everywhere. they are good brands but not the best.|`|abjTamdhaa	well look at your amp specs. right there you should hook up your 10in and that kicker to the amp just two wires one to each speaker off the amp.<br>  ohms are resistence some say it doesnt matter wat the ohms are but they are resistence and personlly i dont want a lot of ohms the average is 4 ohms. if you want anyone to answer  4. we need the rms and max it should have 600 watt max and 150 watts min thats rmp and max

MA78H6bEaa	Blocks are usually used between the axle and the leaf springs on cars. The axle is mounted on top of the springs so putting a block between lowers the stance of the car by the height of the block. Longer U-bolts come with block lowering kits to accomodate the space taken by the blocks.<br>  <br>  That's an old-school mod.|`|2aDxBsfmaa	lowering blocks work the same as blocks for lifting trucks <br>  instead of going on  top of the axle they go on the bottom of the axle to move it closer to the body. think of they as a spacer between the axle and the springs you move the axle from under the springs to over the spring than put the blocks on the springs than axle and bolt them down

W1DoJZE2aa	a free flow is a straight pipe and a chambered has a filter|`|AHygXkmfaa	One is freeflow, and the other has chambers.|`|AA11739114	in a free flow mufler, the muffler is a round tube with a smaller tube inside. between the two is glass.<br>  <br>    a chambered muffler has walls inside to direct the flow into a "maze" through the muffler.<br>  <br>   sound tends to want to travel in a straight line, when you make the flow turn you interupt the sound waves, thus your exaust comes out quiter out the other side.<br>  <br>   both these muffs. are good. "cherry bombs" are freeflows.<br>    flowmasters are chambered.   the cherry's give you a more sharp sound, and flowmasters give you the deeper growl.<br>     i have a 75' pontiac lemans sc  with flowmaster extremes on it. sounds great!!!!|`|RycuIWd8aa	Whatever you buy, don't fall into the trap that louder is better - there is no correlation, and no dyno testing to show that. In fact, a Hot Rod Magazine test in the '80s showed the "turbo" style muffler rated best in decibel reduction and horsepower of all the high performance mufflers. <br>  <br>  In general, the type of internal muffler construction will determine how easily exhaust gas passes through it, how much back pressure it will have, and the sound quality. Perforated core mufflers - glass packs, cherry bombs, etc, usually are loud, don't last long, and can actually lose more horsepower than stock. Mufflers designed with reverse flow, baffles, or chambers may have better horsepower, and can actually not disturb your neighbors.<br>  <br>   What the muffler shop stocks and sells is not necessarily the best, just what the general public wants. Further, a good set of pipes with minimal bends from header to cat will do a lot for many vehicles, and a catalytic converter replacement for a higher flow version sure wouldn't hurt - they are widely available now for less than factory muffler prices ( $60). <br>  <br>  Don't blow your dough on a set of loud pipes that cost you horsepower, your neighbors goodwill, and court fines for noise abatement. Check out Summit, Jegs, and others for what's currently available in efficient mufflers on the market.

CzOFxP5laa	well if buying an amp isnt a problem then obviously the cvx is better. it can handle way more power. for a 12" the cvr handles 400 watts rms and the cvx handles 750 watts rms. but if you can only get your hands on a smaller amp then it'd be smarter to go for the cvr's. but durability and sound quality wise they are all good. all kicker stuff is good. if you go with the cvx's get an amp that is monoblock and around 1500 watts rms|`|KG4qYRb3aa	the cvr are a really good subwoofer for the price, not saying that the cvx is too expensive but more than the cvr because of the quality. the cvx is newer and better, so if you have the money i would go with the cvx. that is i you like kicker.|`|S98VRaiXaa	The cvx is by far better.

Knx06dqJaa	At your age it is definitely not true for any state. This is the reason why the US requires drivers to carry insurance. If you get in an accident and hurt your friend then your insurance (or whomever is at fault) will cover medical and property damages (according to your/their insurance plan and rates).<br>  <br>  But DON'T let anyone else drive your car. That is NOT covered by your insurance (unless you fill out the proper paperwork to add that service which will cost a lot of $$$).<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Drive Safe!|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	It depends on your age and the type of license you have.

Plus warranty, dealer network/parts, fuel injected or carb, mileage,  cost "out the door".|`|zsU4frnDaa	If you will be riding it on major highways, you need to make sure it can keep up with traffic.  I own a 250cc Yamaha.  The top speed is 80mph.  I wouldn't get anything smaller than a 250.  The Japanese scooters (Yamaha, Honda, Suzuki) have better fit and finish than the Chinese clones.<br>  <br>  You also need to sit on the scooter and be able to touch the ground at a stop.  Scooters are much wider than motorcycles, so you need a lower seat height unless you are really tall.|`|uOY3LFavaa	In buying a scooter, you should consider how you intend to use the scooter.  If you are only going to ride in a city, you may find a smaller scoot will do fine.  If you live in a suburban area, you should consider a larger engine (150cc or more, at minimum).  If you intend to go on the freeway, you will need at LEAST a 250cc engine. <br>  <br>  50cc = 35 mph Maximum for most riders and only suitable for in-town riding. 150cc can get most up to about 45-50 mph. a 200-250cc scoot will cruise to the 65-85 range, with some going as much as 100.  The 400cc+ engines will get you well past 100 and are more stable at higher speeds.<br>  <br>  Some other things to consider are small wheel (10-12") versus a larger wheeled scooter (15-16").  The small wheels bikes can be more nimble in an urban area but less stable in a longer, faster commute. The larger wheels generate a gyro effect and can make the ride more stable at speed but they make the scooter longer.<br>  <br>  Honda and Yamaha and Suzuki make very reliable scoots.  Honda's Silver Wing and the Suzuki Burgmann are considered the gold standards and top end of the market. Both are quite large and very fast. None of the above brands have any seriuos offering in the 200-250 range.  H Helix is a sold bike with a relaxed sitting position.<br>  <br>  Piaggio, Kymco and Sym are the best non-japanese manufacturers and many consider them to be equal ( nearly so) in reliability.  Paiggio is the worlds 4th largest bike maker.  They make Vespa (great name, good bikes, higher prices, distinctive style, steel bodied (not a plastic body). P also make Aprilia, Derbi and Piaggio scooters.  Most of the P bikes share engines and other parts and are very well made in Italy. The Aprilia line includes the Scarabeo. Kymco and Sym are Taiwanese and very reliable. They are not "china-scoots" quality.<br>  <br>  China Scoot is a name given to large variety of brands built in China based on engine designs borrowed from japanese and other large companies. The major brands in this category are Lance, Tank, Eagle.  Genuine may or not be in this category. Some of the scooters made by these companies are worth owning, others can be a money pit and very un-reliable.  Typically they require a higher level of technical know-how on the owners part and a lot of patience when it comes to parts and service. Internet dealers basically ship you a box with a scooter inside you need to do the final assembley and tune-up before riding and may require replacing the hoses and other parts BEFORE you can ride them reliabley<br>  <br>  Overall, I would recommend buying a scooter from a local  (brick and mortar) dealer that will stand behind the product and service it when you have an issue.  Personally I would buy any of the Honda, Yamaha, Piaggio, Kymco or Sym bikes. I would steer away from the low cost chinascoots.

9ee6572e98b952a4bf68a1e6e6c2b500aa	There is a pretty big difference between a ported and sealed enclosure for the L7.  It mainly depends on what specs the enclosure is on depending how big the difference is.  <br>  <br>  If you are looking for an SPL setup than a sealed or ported would work.  It depends on if you want something that would be good for competing or something that would be better for everyday use.  <br>  <br>  Basically, the ported enclosure will be louder for the max SPL but only in a very limited frequency near that of it's tuning frequency.  Other then that specific frequency range the two in a sealed enclosure will be louder.  So if you wanted to compete then you would just play a tone around the frequency range of the peak.  Then you would get louder bass then two in a sealed.  In an everyday normal application this would result in your sub being very loud for some songs but not so loud for other songs.  The two subs in a sealed would be better for more songs and would have better SQ.  It would also be louder then the single ported for most of the frequencies except for a few near the ported enclosures tuning frequency.<br>  <br>  Hopefully that helped you decide and made sense.  To summarize, ported is louder for some a small frequency range but two in a sealed is louder for the rest of the frequency range which means overall it is louder.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!<br>  <br>  |`|7ObGOaPPaa	depends. if you have a very good ported box ( custom made to the right specs for that woofer) then it can be as loud as, or louder than 2 woofers in a sealed box. but on the other hand 2 woofers especially if they are the same, tend to be a little bit better than one. It also depends on your amp. If one setup will allow your amp to push more power than the other, then thats what you should look at 2. if your amp will run 2 subwoofers at 2 ohms on 1000 watts and one subwoofer only at 500 watts, then obviously the 2 subwoofer setup will be better.

Xw39Ep5haa	Which aeroplane?, how many passengers?, how much luggage?, how much fuel? Even the pilot has to take a measured guess to calculate fuel. so, In conclusion, no they dont.|`|Y6BzJuTJaa	LOOKS ALL GUESS WORK TO ME !! |`|AA10164889	Checked luggage and fuel, as well as the dry weight of the airplane, are known quantities.  Passengers and carry-on luggage are estimated.  Most airlines use a formula like 170 lbs per passenger and 15 lbs per carry-on bag.|`|ZTMjXz1saa	No, it's always an estimate, although a good one.<br>  <br>  The weight of the plane, without people or baggage is measured by putting the plane on scales and recorded once (or if it changes).  Pilots then use this information, and best guesses of the weight of the people, baggage and fuel to determine the take-off weight.  General aviation pilots usually use their best estimates of what the people actually weigh.  Airlines use averages for passengers and bags unless they see a reason to measure one or the other (really heavy bag or if they are doing a charter flight for a college wrestling team where all the guys are heavy).  For example, an airline may say that every passenger weighs 190 pounds and each bag weighs 30 pounds.  Either way, it's not "precise".  Even if you weigh every passenger and bag, you still won't get a precise take-off weight because pilots can only estimate how much fuel the will use while taxiing to the runway.<br>  <br>  The only way I can think of to get a precise take-off weight, would be to put the airplane on scales right before take-off.  This is never done nor is it even remotely practical to do so.|`|ZRVwxs0baa	What kind of airplane? In many planes they can determine the exact weight. If you are asking about airliners then no they do not. They go by FAA average weight figures, which take into account passenger age, sex and time of year. The degree of error on these figures can very and this information normally isn't available for stand by passengers but they put in a large enough margin of error that there is rarely any problems.<br>  <br>  The real concern is in passenger loading and unloading and shifting the center of gravity around.|`|DvlwN9kdaa	No.  No one knows the weight of the passengers and their carryon luggage; even the weight of the checked luggage is not totaled.  The  crewmembers and their luggage are not weighed.   And the weight of the fuel and oil is not known exactly.|`|FEJAfDctaa	Depends on how accurate you mean when you say "precise." When I fly a small aircraft, I can calculate the takeoff weight within 5-10 pounds. Large transport aircraft use standard weights for passengers, and could be off by several hundred pounds.<br>  <br>  If you want to be able to calculate the takeoff weight down to within a pound, it can be done. However, it would be very time consuming since you would have to find out the exact amount of fuel in the aircraft, the exact weight of each and every person on board, as well as the exact weight of anything they are bringing on board and the exact weight of any baggage or cargo. It can be done, but the amount of time necessary to get an exact weight makes it a pointless exercise.|`|Qyw3RkCKaa	Does it not depend if it is a cargo plane?  I should imagine that a passenger plane is unknown, because whenever I have flown, only my baggage has been weighed and not myself or the other passengers.  Maybe they just use an average weight for all of the passengers?<br>  <br>  I would have thought, that there must be a maximum weight that the aircraft can hold, or otherwise surely it would not get off the ground?|`|26d342c5c97d68129a08f71c5edaae04aa	they do not know the actual weight of the airplane at takeoff... they use averages for the passengers and they weigh the baggage and the fuel... so no, they do not know the precise weight of the aircraft at takeoff|`|fynzkVK4aa	Well, seeing as they don't weigh any of the passengers (at least not in my experience!)  they can't do if you really think about it...|`|09c4b903d38a2b518e6f7b1cf1788fdbaa	I believe it is an estimate...a very accurate one.|`|VhhEz92Oaa	Rob G. gave you the best answer.

AA10384360	First place I would start is a tune up.  If you have a fouled spark plug, it could easily cause a cylinder to misfire, thereby causing shaking.  Another problem area could be the motor mounts, inspect them for missing or worn grommets.  Another place to look is the air filter, if it is clogged the engine will run rough because it is starved for air.  |`|5U9wKtgqaa	it's not the car, it's you when the cop pulls up behind you and you notice your crack pipe still in the ash tray from lunch break!

U24VtSlZaa	What do the pistons & cylinder walls look like?  hard to say without a visual inspection.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	There is no absolutely correct answer.  It depends on the overall condition of the engine and how long you intend to keep the car.  If you are rebuilding the heads because of leaking valves then the head repair may result in high oil consumption because the piston rings will allow the increased cylinder pressures to escape.  In my opinion it is usually a good idea to do a ring job at the same time and once the pistons are removed you may as well replace all the bearings. The head repair is relatively simple compared to a ring job so it may be worth just doing the heads by themselves.|`|8bISKi4maa	depends how much of a beating the engine has taken over the years, but being a 89 if you just replace than your not gonna have much of a significant changge|`|jFwuiRKxaa	 On a old car like that if you just do the heads you will blow the rings out in no time.

Some older cars you could hold the gear-shift forward and turn the key..  If the tumblers are stuck, clean the lock out with Tuner_Cleaner. You can buy at most hardware stores r electronic stores. tuner cleaner wont hurt the lock r the plastics,r wiring.  just spray as much as you like until all the graphite is gone, let dry. If u have an air pressure sorce U can blow light air pressure into the cylinder, after using a squirt of wd-40 (not recommended under normal circumstances)and sometimes this helps also. If u use the Wd-40 and it works good don't apply any graphite unless u clean the cylinder again. U need just a small amount of graphite...Just a thought. Have a good day.|`|qlDV1OZwaa	Call te dealer

Probably NOT the problem.<br>  People like to blame the O2 sensor for the problem because that's where the computer fault appears.<br>  However, nine times out of ten, it's not faulty. It is simply reading a condition in the engine that is causing it to send a signal to the computer that there is a fault in the exhaust emissions mixture.<br>  A fouled spark plug, loose spark plug wire, a vacuum leak, dirty injectors, EGR valve, weak fuel pump, dirty fuel filter, weak ignition coil, plugged air filter, on and on, can all cause the O2 sensor to register a fault code.<br>  Before you yank the O2 sensor and replace it, check the basics first. Otherwise, you could have wasted time and money on the result, not the cause.<br>  <br>  (Check Engine Light)<br>  There are many components that work together in the engine to maintain optimal engine performance and economy.<br>  A "check engine" light indicates that there is a sensor that is reading a condition that is "out of range".<br>  Simply resetting the light does not solve the initial cause of the problem.<br>  Replacing a number of parts trying to troubleshoot the problem in the hopes of getting the light to stay off is a tremendous waste of time and money.<br>  The simplest, and most economical way to alleviate your issue, is to have an engine diagnostic done by a reputable shop to determine what caused the computer to signal you to begin with. Just reading the computer codes may not find the "cause".|`|ZHhi8vSjaa	check and see if you have 2 on the manifolds right off the engine if you vehicle has only two the parts store can tell you bank 1 sensor 2 is the one by the cat converter hope this helps

9ee6572e98b952a4bf68a1e6e6c2b500aa	The only reason you need to charge the cap is to protect yourself and protect the terminals on the cap.  When a cap is discharged it is basically a dead short.  That means there is a 12 volt difference in voltage between the power wire and the cap.  You charge the cap to charge up the voltage to the point where it is at 12 volts, the same as the power wire.  If you don't charge it you will simply have a big spark due to the difference in voltage.  <br>  <br>  Once the cap is hooked up to the power wire it is completely charged.  If you cut it off short you would simply have a little spark.  Right after that it will be completely charged.<br>  <br>  When you say that the cap turns on and off it is not actually the cap that is turning on or off.  A cap does not turn on or off, rather it is just the LED display that is turning on or off.  It does this everytime there is a difference in voltage between the cap and the battery.  Once the voltage stabalizes it will turn off,  Basically, you don't need to worry about the display being on, this is normal.<br>  <br>  Your cap is working fine and there is no need to worry about it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|wkjfh0gaaa	ok, some caps work differently. more than likely when u hook up a cap it will or should turn on a led display and start charging. when its charged i might shut off the display. this happens cuz if ur not pounding loud enough it wont need to come bk on. <br>  <br>  it could turn on n off everytime u start or shut ur car off, idk , ive seen some strange stuff before. <br>  <br>  when its fully charged it should be the same voltage as ur battery ( if its off 12.w/e and if its running the same as the alternator charge).when ur not playing anything keep ur eye on the cap and make sure it turns off or shut the car off and look.<br>  <br>  good luck  and let me know any more info<br>  <br>  oh and by the way caps hold a charge for a long time unless u discharge them, u should have got a little resistor to use for that.|`|rGmwwyuHaa	i don't think so. you have to let it charge up even before you install it. check out the link near the bottom|`|4a0Akgieaa	A capacitor is a temporary reservoir of electricity. It should charge when you turn the car on and it will bleed off when the car is turned off. It is not a battery and does not need to be pre-charged.

Take a wrench, unscrew it and remove it, as soon as you loosten it, oil will begin gushing out with fury from your oil pan, you shoudl ahve somethign underneath the car to catch all of the oil such as an oil drain pan, maybe one with a pour spout so you can transfer the used oil to another container... like this one....<br>  <a href="http://www.jmtools.cn/images/oil_drain_pan1.jpg.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.jmtools.cn/images/oil_drain_p...</a><br>  <br>  in addition to draining the oil, you shoudl also replace the oil filter,<br>  <br>  this is how the oil filter is attatched to your car, from the picture it apears it is on the left side...<br>  <a href="http://z.about.com/d/autorepair/1/0/L/3/98849262.gif" rel="nofollow">http://z.about.com/d/autorepair/1/0/L/3/...</a><br>  to remove the oil filter, you simply unscrew it, you can use a "strap wrench, or an oil filter wrench to remove it if you cant unscrew it by hand.<br>  <br>  this is a strap wrench<br>  <a href="http://www.northerntool.com/images/product/images/1501539_lg.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.northerntool.com/images/produ...</a><br>  these are oil filter wrenches... be sure to get one that fits your oil filter as there are different sizes<br>  <a href="http://upscaleauto.com/Oil%20Filter%20Wrench.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://upscaleauto.com/Oil%20Filter%20Wr...</a><br>  <br>  anywho, when you unscrew the oil filter, oil will again come gushing out, only this time not as much, you will still need to have somehting ready to catch it though.<br>  <br>  With the oil filter removed, screw on your new oil filter, with your hands only as tight as you can get it, so that next time you will still be able to remove it, oil filters do not need to be tightened very hard, but they do need to be tightened, think ~15-30 ft lbs<br>  <br>  in case you forgot to before, MAKE SURE you tightened your oil drain plug before drivign the car, it should be tightened to 25 fl lbs<br>  <br>  Once you have tightened both the new oil filter, and oil drain plug securely, you can now go into the engine bay and add oil to the engine, your car manual should specify how much to use, make sure is specifies how much "with filter" which is how much to use when you replace the oil and the filter.<br>  <br>  After adding the oil, veryiy with the oil dipstick that htere is enough oil in the engine, your manual will show you where both to add the engine oil to, and where the dipstick is.<br>  <br>  Have fun|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	You need to remove the oil plug in the oil pan and let the oil drain out and then remove the oil filter. After the oil stops draining out of the oil filter wipe off the seat for the oil filter. Take the new filter and wipe fresh oil on the O-ring and screw it back onto the engine. Hand tighten it only, but make sure it is good and tight. Replace the oil drain plug and put the fresh oil back in the oil fill hole. I am not sure how much oil that model holds, so when you go to the parts store ask them. I think it holds 4 quarts. After you pour the oil back in, start the engine and make sure the oil light goes out, then walk to the front of the car and look under it to be sure it has no leaks. Done.|`|khrD8Vqwaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV4qzXZR6Xc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV4qzXZR6...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  this helped me all cars are the same pretty much when it comes to oil

It is, however, not an ideal setup.  <br>  <br>  You can easily damage your sub by doing this, especially if you do not know what you are doing.  You will need to make sure to set the gain on both amps very carefully.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|VIWl8tRVaa	yeah but make sure they are the same amps with the same settings and gain and phase or ur sub will break after a while|`|wzBfaWfzaa	No b/c then you will have two diff power sources comming into one sub it wouldnt be good you would blow the speaker up the sual voice coil is to bridge the sub not to run two amps off it

U9bQgfY9aa	I bought an ex-rental 2005 Chevy Cavalier last summer for my daughter for grad school. In perfect shape and it has not been a moment of trouble since. Other than a minor electrical problem I fixed myself and oil changes.<br>  <br>  Very happy with it.<br>  <br>  And I rent cars 2-3 times a year and have never abused one. OK, so I went off road once in a Mercury Sable but very gently on a grassy field. And took a rented FOrd Escape over the Sitgreaves pass on old Route 66 in Arizona once. But hey, it was an SUV.|`|1NWjta2jaa	This is an old debate. Some people say that rental cars are not a good deal because people always abuse them, when they rent them. Other people say that rental companies take really good care of them (service them on time and fix everything right away.)<br>  So, who do you believe? <br>  If it was me, I'd rather buy a used car which had one owner, than a car which had a hundred "owners."|`|1Bmo1JsYaa	It is true that people do not treat rental cars like they would their own. However, the rental companies usually maintain them and give you a good warranty; better than one of those corner used car lots. And just where do you think these lots find their cars? At auctions, where unsold rentals are disposed of. One piece of advice from someone who used to be in the business: stay away from the smaller cars like Hundai or Kia. Stick with the better quality foreign or large domestic cars.|`|dafae2ae3b86a68e315dfbc92b268dc5aa	If  you  are  a  mechanic  or  can  afford  one .<br>  Rentals  see  lots  of  lunatic  drivers  and  others  just  inexperienced  with  that  model .<br>  Be  prepared  in  case  there  are  mechanical  issues  that  arise .<br>  <br>  Things  are  good  deals  IF  you  are prepared  to  do  repairs .<br>  <br>  >|`|JjiX0ghYaa	s<br>  shur check out prices good deal?buy from name brand eg.budget...<br>  the big companies are nation wide and must meet guidlines.most are well maintained.diff. from can to us check ins guidlines.(ins rates)|`|iAM3gctWaa	Don′t forget that these vehicles have been beaten to death by dozens of careless drivers.
bKcgh89raa	Toyota Highlander is an excellent choice, it has a near trouble free reliability record. Honda CRV or Pilot may also be good choices. Look for 2004 to 2006 should be in the price range that you mentioned. I Personally would not put that kind of money back into the Ford. What else will they find when they tear it down?|`|3lSRiTLTaa	Dude anything involving the transmission is a pain in the ***. we had a Grand Prix and the trans went out we had it fixed but we went on a trip a week later and it went out again... you will just keep having problems... get a different vehicle.|`|JjiX0ghYaa	i can buy that van for under 6800 never head of int.controll or irc switch motor.a rebuilt trans is about 1-1800 dollors and ive never seen 3-4000 labour to install one get a second opinion not from dealer.besides you sound sold on toyota
uy4k4OlNaa	Yes, the exhaust makes the car louder.  The smaller the muffler, the part that muffles the exhaust noise, the louder the car will be.  I think that flowmaster shoud do well.  It all depends on the engine it is being used on though.|`|1NWjta2jaa	No, a muffler makes a car LESS loud.

r9H8AXIsaa	I would suggest you take it to a Authorized Ford Service Center for a proper diagnosis.  Keep guessing and you'll be spending more.
24kFbAdsaa	Sure it's possible.  But most of the indications would be fairly steady unless you drive in mountainous terrain at high speeds.  Airplane piston engines are very similar to automobile engines except for the cooling system.  Just drill and install the correct sensors.  A bank indicator would be useless.  Cars don't bank in a turn (unless they roll over).  Cars don't go around turns fast enough for a turn and bank indicator (needle & ball) to work (the ball will always show a skid during a turn).  The pitch indication on the artificial horizon would hardly move.  A steep hill of 5% would only be 4.5 degrees of pitch.  Vertical speed indicator (2000-0-2000) may work somewhat on steep hills at very high speeds.  Depending upon the aircraft and the angle of descent, a 500 fpm rate of change would require about 80-120 mph speed - same for your car.  Altitude indicator would be good.|`|d9d7dbffacb9c5256ef7afd69e6023b6aa	All you need are 12 volt instruments, and a way to install them. <br>  It ain't cheap, which is why so few people do it.<br>  <br>  Any instrument you can put in an aircraft, you can put in a car, but some of them don't have any application, like a radar altimeter, unless you are into driving off cliffs.<br>  You could put in head temp. oil temp & press, fuel flow, fuel press, trans temp, anything you can afford, you can put it in.|`|udPENhCxaa	I used to have a bank indicator in my  truck for four wheeling years ago. Got it out of JC Whitney catalog. Oil gauge is already on the car/trucks and altitude would remain the same due to the vehicle not leaving the ground and altitude gauges use the distance from the vehicle or plane to the ground I believe.<br>    For just looks? go to an aircraft graveyard. They would have the panels and gauges for you. Good luck.|`|zlPAVkUBaa	You're a pilot and you don't call them indicators or gauges?|`|TnIsuYqYaa	Of course you can,if you can get the parts at a reasonable price.
b14ZgQiyaa	You are close but not quite correct. The law will change but not to say that you have your license for 2 more years. For the 2 years that you have your P's you will be considered a "Novice Driver" and there will be restrictions associated... If you go to the link below, it will show you all the restrictions that will be applicable.|`|2EgY77Cqaa	I don't think so, I only thought P platers had the change of only 1 passanger.
M7G3MZb5aa	There are a couple types of axles on cars, some are straight, and simple, and usually dont need replacing unless you have been in an accident, others employ "universal joints" and can fail putting you and your car at risk.<br>  <br>  Before they fail though, they will begin to squeal and make a lot of noise.<br>  <br>  In general, and axle is a rod or shaft that is spun to transfer rotational engergy from one side of the axle to an object at the other side of the axle some distace away from the source.<br>  <br>  In a car there will be an axle between your transmission and your wheel, or there will be one inbetween your transmission and your differental housing, in that case, your differential housing will have one axle coming from it going to each wheel.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  In cars most notibly front wheel drive cars, but also cars with independant suspention, axles will include universal joints, often these joints fail, and since they are part fo the axle assembly on FWD cars, the whole axles needs to be replaced, this link shows a cool animation of a universal joint   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_joint" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_j...</a>|`|LygV4VOOaa	connects your transmission to your tires. without them you will go nowhere.|`|fDDgFrtNaa	an axle(s) is encased inside the rear end and is perpendicular to the driveshaft on a rear wheel drive car. it connects the wheels to the drive gears in the differential to the driveshaft to the transmission to the engine eventually. this is just a basic sequence. on front wheel drive cars, the axle is called a transaxle because its connected directly to the transmission.|`|0b17535ea0a24e5ccc0511e0b29b8602aa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle</a><br>  <br>   <br>  Splines on a front drive axle.An axle that is driven by the engine is called a drive axle.<br>  <br>  Modern front wheel drive cars typically combine the transmission and front axle into a single unit called a transaxle. The drive axle is a split axle with a differential and universal joints between the two half axles. Each half axle connects to the wheel by use of a constant velocity (CV) joint which allows the wheel assembly to move freely vertically as well as to pivot when making turns.|`|adEu2zgraa	The crankshaft makes it spin, so your tires spin as well. Its really just a big pole connecting the two front/rear tires.
qjg0g5WMaa	well you don't set your standards but frankly it all boils down to brand loyality most cars nowadays when properly taken care of will last for hundreds of thousands of miles if you buy ford dodge or chevy your better off in the long run because if something breaks you'll be able to find parts easier<br>  good luck|`|U9bQgfY9aa	All cars now will last between 150,000 and 200,000 miles. Beyond that, they become uneconomical to repair and parts become too hard to get.<br>  <br>  If in doubt get a new Civic or Camry.|`|ZBFE9AqZaa	none that other than two you have given. a 1993 Civic was the best car I ever had. 15 years and it still had alot of the parts that I drove it off the lot new on it. Well over 300,000 miles with three sets of front brakes, two back brakes sets and usually just an oil change and tires.|`|lB7uvA73aa	every new car is designed to last a long time. new chryslers and dodges have lifetime powertrain warranties... gm vehicles have 100k warranties...|`|LosjGlkKaa	Nothing, cars these days are made to not last so u have 2 go out and get a new one in 10 years
AXNkmdbKaa	Apparently you didn't have the good luck I previously told you would be needed.  Now it sounds like you have a fuel problem.  Obviously the guy who replaced the head gaskets could have left something loose but then it seems like it would immediately have given trouble.  I am thinking  you cranked it, it idled and ran well (unusual), and you drove it far enough to get it hot again whereupon it quit and won't crank.  If so, I would have to guess your ignition coils are going out.  It is not unusual for these cars to run real crappy after major work like you have had done and the computer has to reset itself over a couple of hours of running before the car will run well.  Get the guy who installed the gaskets to check out his work.|`|zh0mOxutaa	Hi, if you want to get more information about it, go to <a href="http://car-insurance2009.synthasite.com/?q=Pontiac%20Grand" rel="nofollow">http://car-insurance2009.synthasite.com/...</a>

Un barco flota debido a que todo cuerpo sumergido en un fluido sufre un empuje hacia arriba equivalente al peso del volumen de fluido que desplaza, en esto consiste el principio de Arquímedes. Dicho de otra manera: el peso del agua desplazada por el barco es igual a la fuerza que lo empuja hacia arriba, manteniéndolo a flote, para ello se aprovecha, también, la propia forma de la estructura del barco.|`|fe57cc20cfaed83024bb17cb7886528aaa	Busca un gráfico de la infraestructura de un barco y te darás cuenta porque flota.|`|ce33fd2f560e52480648078fd1ec8bd8aa	La estructura de los barcos comprende bóvedas de aire que ejercen presión y permiten mantenerlos a flote.

Cuando estas bóvedas se llenan de agua el submarino se sumerge y cuando se vacían de agua salen a flote.|`|25a398e879f60d11ef7865f2a69aa172aa	Todo cuerpo sumergido en un fluido experimenta un empuje vertical directamente proporcional al líquido que desaloja.<br>  Arquímedes.<br>  Así pues tenemos que el empuje vertical que ejerce el agua sobre el barco es igual a la cantidad de agua que éste desplaza.|`|B3EVe6Dfaa	Eso depende de la altura del canal, imaginate que un canal es una gran masa de agua por lo tanto el volúmen es mayor que la del barco, obviamente que si el canal tiene baja profundidad el barco va a encallar. Eso está todo estudiado quien manda un barco sabe que puede navegar tranquilo en determinadas zonas, constantemente se hacen relevamientos porque con los cambios climáticos, mareas, y diversos factores naturales hacen variar a cada momento.|`|I6nopGJJaa	De acuerdo al tonelaje del barco y capacidad de carga  se utiliza en depositos especiales en el fondo del barco (Sea mercante o no) lo que se llama lastre (puede ser carga a granel desperdiciable, o lo que se usa mucho "Agua lastre", si el barco esta sobrecargado se deshacen del lastre hasta que se estabilice la flotacion. Si vas a un puerto y ves un barco atracado trata de observar a uno descargado y a otro cargado de la linea de flotacion al casco o parte de abajo del barco casi siempre esta pintado de rojo (En esa area se pone el lastre, sea agua, aire o gravilla (piedra, madera o arena) y si ves en la proa de la linea de flotacion hacia abajo (hasta el agua) ves lineas como si fuera una regla, eso indica la capacidad de carga de los cargueros.

M7G3MZb5aa	to get a hoel in your radiator, you need blund traumatic damge, like a bird hiting your car, or liek somebody smashing it with a hammer.  Your pump in no way could damage your rad, your fan could, if say a fan blade broke off while it was spinning and struck it hard enough, it would be very obvious though as your fan would be broken and also you would see the impact on the rad.<br>  <br>  Another way would be for the metal to oxidise enough to become brittle, then when you hit a bump or something a small crack forms, causing a leak.  Engine coolant has additives to prevent corrosion of your radiator, but if you dont replac it, your bound to get a leak somewhere eventually since the additives get consumed over time.  Your cars manual will specify how often to change engine coolant.<br>  <br>  I seriously doubt a mechanic could make a hole in your radiator without there being signifigant damage that would be really obvious.  (like the impact of a hammer claw)<br>  <br>  A hole in your radiator will only cause coolant to leak, it wont cause your engine to fail, however if too much coolant leaks, your car will overheat, which will do damage to it.|`|ZGgh4yJ1aa	Is the hole on the front or back of the radiator? I doubt a mechanic would put a hole in the radiator to wring money out of you, more likely if it is their fault they hit it with a wrench accidentally and didn't notice the leak or it got worse after driving. If the fan hit the radiator there would be an arc matching the fan blades torn into the fins, but with an electric fan the water pump wouldn't have anything to do with it, there is really no other mechanical failure that could cause a hole.|`|dQrBlk4qaa	I had the belt driving the water pump break on my '90 Miata. The pump immediately stopped, and the resulting surge blew the plastic top piece right off the radiator - pow.<br>  <br>  A fan can easily damage the radiator, if it did hit it -although escorts have electric fans, right? <br>  <br>  Ask to see the radiator - its easy to tell the difference between a deliberate puncture and an incidental or mechanical failure-caused one. <br>  <br>  A hole in a radiator the size of a 1/4" headphone plug can be severe enough to cause a major leak in some cars, especially ones with small coolant capacity like your Escort.|`|QM0Ezfvnaa	You did not state the age of yor car . . . but, radiators can corrode, making holes appear anywhere in the lines that run through it or in the top/bottom cap. They are repaired using solder, inexpensively, in moments.<br>  <br>  WATCH you heat gauge to determine how far you can drive and keep water bottles in the trunk to use in an emergency. Leave the engine running as you CAREFULLY add water, if needed . . . shutting off the engine allows the heat to spike and the time you have to wait for a cool down is long.|`|lemCTR2Waa	Escorts are no longer being produced so your car must be several years old  already. The rad develops corrosion over time especially if you do not change your coolant regularly and that's when the tubes begin to get eaten away and coolant leakage would result.  That is bad for the engine because overheating can result. Have it replaced or repaired ASAP. No need to suspect your mechanic, he may have saved you the trouble by discovering it early.|`|AA10482880	I'm going to TELL you straight up and listen REAL GOOD. Mechanics are the MOST moodyist people. I have 3 mechanic which I keep around when I need work done on my vehicles.  First, I feel how they been doing before I select the mechanic working on my car. I had a mechanic which started great for years, than he would fix the item I came in for repair and then he would break something and blame whatever sounds like a good reason.   Dump mechanics like that, I don't believe in Cloud #9 hanging over my head after a repair. Many mechanic just GET careless.   CHECK their moods !

If you crash it (hopefully you don't) you're screwed and the insurance goes through the roof. Those cars you chose are show off cars, the last thing a young kid like you should want to do is show off, you need to think safety. All the kids in my high school that went out and got awesome cars and put all this money into them, crashed them. They wanted to show off and speed, some of them got in bad accidents, and one kid got killed. Another kid killed another motorist because he ran a red light showing off in front of his friends. Now the kid has counseling sessions all the time and refuses to drive.

If the car is damaged the amount it sells for would be much lower.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	When a car is repossessed it is sold at auction, and you are sued for the difference between the sale price and what you still owe on your loan. Of course, if the car has been wrecked it won't bring much money when sold. Therefore, the amount you will owe will much higher than if the car were not wrecked. So, in that sense, yes, you are responsible for both the loan and the damages. And...your credit is ruined for seven years after the repo, which will prevent you from getting another loan during that time. Not good.|`|24kFbAdsaa	Presuming you have insurance and the vehicle is declared a total loss, the insurance company will cover up to the value of the car (not the loan balance).  You would be responsible for the difference.<br>  <br>  If the car was not a total loss, the insurance company would pay for the repairs only.  You would still be liable for the loan.<br>  <br>  If you didn't have insurance, you would be held liable for the loan AND repairs (if not totaled).  Doesn't sound fair, does it?  But if the car wasn't wrecked, you would still be held liable for the loan difference after repossession and resale.<br>  <br>  When you get a car repossessed, you are at the mercy of the people who hold the note on your car.

AA10419188	Most likely you have a bad tire!  More specifically a damaged casing on tire!    At very low speed - like maybe 2-3 mph, it sort of does the "hula??  This is common when casing has shifted at bottom, and there is sort of a "jig" in tire surface, - where  tread may be displaced sideways as much as an inch at that point!  If this  is the case, - the tire can go any minute, -- increasing pressure on this problem will dramatically increase problem, and decreasing pressure will sort or decrease to some degree, as the strain on casing decreases! When tire gets spinning fast enough  the cetrifugal force causesd the tire to expand - causing a sever lump (causing the tire to become more or less egg shaped)  Tire put on wheel balance machine may balance, but run all out of shape at high speed!<br>  <br>  Jack rear end of car up on one side,- then the other,spin tire, - you will see shift - or wobble on bad one! When you find out which one it is , - take it off and put on spare, - let air pressure way down, and take to tire shop and get another tire!  I have seen pressure release from one blowing up in trunk -- blow out rear window in older cars that had the bigger tires! You definately do not want this "blowing out" on road at high speed! First of all it sounds like a bomb went off,- second the tire usually shreds (sometimes even before going flat)-- it tears out wheel wells and beats up fender flanges and stuff..... It could also cause you to lose control, - if you do not know how to stop a vehicle with blown tire!<br>  <br>  When tire blows get off gas instantly, do not touch brake (let it slow down by itself),hold in streight line,- do not start pulling off road till you are down to about 35 mph,--- then get well off road, so that when you change tire,- you don't get run over!.....  If you turn too sharply, at high speed it is real easy to lose it, and roll over or flip too! <br>  <br>  90% chance struts are not problem, - usually it is a bottoming problem-especially in rear!  Fronts if bad enough can cause a lot more problems!|`|dQrBlk4qaa	If you just got new front tires and the shaking started, its likely they didn't properly balance the front tires, or a balance weight came off one of the new tires. If it was there before, you can have them check the rear tires. <br>  <br>  More air in the rear tires will make the car feel more sensitive, and make the shaking feel worse. <br>  <br>  The struts generally don't cause much problem unless you have a severely damaged strut. <br>  <br>  I had a problem with a Miata I owned. I had the lug nuts where three were normal, but the fourth was a "security" nut. Turned out the security nut weighed a lot more than the other lugs, and the car had vibration problems that were very prominent at 70 mph. If you have lugs like that, I strongly suggest you change them!|`|0RuNbOGlaa	Sound like tire balance if in the rear, and I assume this is a front wheel drive.  If so, then the rear shocks might be bad also, but not struts.<br>    If by chance this is a rear wheel drive, ( I'm not familiar with Mazda) then you  might have bad universal joints.<br>    Do the cheapest and most likely first, wheel balance and go from there.

uMKuOlFNaa	Your last comment is quite amusing. So you think you should pay the same amount as another person, even if this other person has refrained from getting drunk and getting behind the wheel of a 3k pound car. Or would have loved to go 95 mph to get home quicker, but refrained from doing so in fear of crashing and killing another person?<br>  You logic is astonishing. Be glad they are willing to offer you insurance- Driving is a privilege, not a requirement. Oh BTW, my 2008 Ford F450 cost me 54k last year. So your measly 10k wouldn't help if you caused an accident and did major damage to my truck. I would have to file on my ins. I think the minimum legal is 25k in property damage. I don't think you can purchase 10k in liability.|`|kjAWsDwLaa	Countryboy, this is at least the third time you've asked this question; haven't you learned ANYTHING from the previous answers?<br>  <br>  If you want to drive with only an SR bond, OK, but you'd better have at least $50,000 hanging around and nothing better to do with it.  With the record you've established, you're lucky some company doesn't insist on a "cost plus" policy!  Unless you have a real epiphany soon, you're just about guaranteed to be a dead loss for any insurance company you go with.|`|ajK4OLROaa	yes i think so.......haven't u asked this question before and i said i don't know??|`|839c3d2ee5b00b14fa62aee50f8c5d01aa	With that kind of record just imagine how much it would cost if you hit an 18-wheeler.  I know somebody who did and their $50K coverage barely covered it.  Also think about what it would cost if you hit just about any new car on the road today - they all cost more to fix than they cost new and $10K won't even cover the price of a new car.<br>  <br>  Safe drivers pay less because they cost the insurance companies less.|`|b6a091811b28070a1bddd2f561070d4baa	There's no morality issue with charging bad drivers more for their insurance.

cn0ALwwLaa	No. Absolutely not. And this is true for 90% of cars.<br>  <br>  I -promise- you that there are people that will tell you their car runs better on Premium. It probably does - on an old car, and maybe on a new. New cars can detect the octane, and adjust their ignition timing to deal with the normal (87) or premium (93 or 94) gas. <br>  <br>  Tests were done to see if it made a difference. In a certain normally-aspirated Saab (this car was chosen because it is also available in Turbo,) using premium gasoline, costing 30 cents a GALLON more, resulted in an improved acceleration of exactly 0.1 second. Thats one-tenth of a second.<br>  <br>  The extra octant that cost so much more simply was not going to be a benefit to that car. (Note to Physics: 'Octane' is Iso-Octane. Its like Octane to the power of 10.) <br>  <br>  On very very old cars, cars that have been converted FROM using leaded gasoline (remember that? Its -all- Unleaded now,) and -TURBO CARS- and Cars that recommend it, and yes, Ferraris, Porsches, Lamborghinis, and Audis (Volkswagen and some Mercedes recommend 89, i thing 87 is a stretch on Benz) is perfect.<br>  <br>  If the car is not made to run on Premium, adding Premium makes you dumb. No offense.<br>  <br>  The additive packages that make BP BP, Mobil Mobil, Shell Shell, etc. are in all the grades. Its not like its in 93 and not in 87. There is the same amount of it, too.<br>  <br>  So.... Pay the $1.63 a gallon it is for gas out here, and dont worry abou tif you need the premium. Honestly, Chances are you do not.<br>  <br>  89 is a mid-grade and some cars recommend it, if it does use it. If not, treat it like 93.<br>  <br>  86 is in the mountains and apparently is OK at high altitude, but just get the 87. It will be like Premium up there and, again, no gain. 87 is basically the minimum you can reliablu run an engine without knock or ping. Id stay away from 86 Economy grade, high up in the midwestern states.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps, I know all about this.|`|nAK8bm91aa	Premium gas is only for high performance vehicles, it has a lower ignition rate. Regular has a higher ignition rate.|`|28qmqsySaa	if you vehicles manufacture does not say you need to use the higher grade gasoline, then you will be wasting your money<br>  go by what the vehicle calls for<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck<br>  smile|`|GNmzjDHHaa	Little more octane. follow manufacterers specs|`|285b98a01876e1a83f6a503f40258aa6aa	The manufacturer recommended Octane rating is what you should use. It is all based on engine design, mostly combustion chamber design. Using a higher grade is tossing money out the exhaust. I have had a few Corvettes, still have a 98, I use the 87 Octane and make awesome power, no pinging etc. However the Z06 models require the highest octane rating, using the cheap crap would eventually do engine damage from pinging.|`|NbCBk3mqaa	i have found that running the mid grade gives my truck better mpg.|`|3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	For most cars, it isn't worth it.  There are some, however, that run better on gas with a higher octane content OR might benefit from an occasional tankful of the good stuff.  I have one vehicle in each category ...<br>  <br>  1) A '92 Subaru Legacy wagon - the engine knocks like HELL if I fill it up with regular unleaded even one time, so it gets the middle grade on every fill-up.<br>  <br>  2) A '93 Ford Escort - most of the time it's fine with plain old unleaded.  But it runs better if I put in premium every fourth or fifth tankful.  The other option is to put in a bottle of fuel system cleaner at about the same interval.  I've tried doing both and the result is about the same, but spending a little extra on the occasional tank of gas costs less than buying the cleaner.<br>  <br>  In any case, there are very few vehicles that need to run on premium unleaded all the time.  If yours is supposed to and you don't like what you're spending at the pump, you might try a little experimentation by weaning it to a lower grade and/or not using premium with every tankful.  If it makes a difference in what you spend and the car still runs OK, then go ahead and make the experiment a permanent arrangement.|`|mTwn8p79aa	It burns hotter and gives engines higher compression in the cylinder and therefore provides more power.<br>  <br>  If your car isn't made for it, don't use it.  If the engine isn't built with the components to handle the higher temps and higher compression it will eventually cause severe damage.  If you've been doing it for awhile, stop.  If you're thinking about trying it, don't.<br>  <br>  If your car is made for high octane fuel you can probably still get away without using it.  You'll get slightly less horsepower but most newer cars that run on premium also have computers that will allow them to run on regular without a "knock."  If your car says it needs premium you can try to run a tank of regular, if you don't notice any funny noise and don't get a check engine light, your fine.  It might also say in your manual that premium is suggested but it will run on regular, (it'll probably also say what the difference in horsepower is) that'd be a way to be sure it wouldn't hurt anything.
AA11435704	The Toyota dealer has a vested interest in convincing you that only the OEM parts will work. This is no different than McDonald's saying that Burger King should be avoided.

The only difference is Quality and no Dealership offers "Quality". The buy the cheapest SH*T on the earth and call it Quality, why ? The word Quality means different things to different people period. I may feel that a high quality brand like say Bendix brakes is best and it is by reputation, however a Spanish guy may feel that Generic is better quality for "his" dollar and its all he can afford. If you have a distributor that has wires coming from it, you do not need a new one, all you need to do is remove the cap, view the contacts underneath, use a screwdriver and remove the corrosion from the contacts and reinstall, your done. This is what we in the business call a minor tune-up.
fFrdimDBaa	A whole lot of people swear by the Rotella 15W40 oil. You can go to just about any motorcycle forum and do a search on oil and you'll see what I mean. Personally I use Valvoline motorcycle oil in my bike though.<br>  <br>  Here is an eye opening link about the different kinds of oils that are good for motorcycles. Read the whole thing if you have time, it's not that long. The author is a chemist from Houston.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://vfrworld.com/tex_vfr/tech/oil.htm" rel="nofollow">http://vfrworld.com/tex_vfr/tech/oil.htm</a>|`|XBUeYE41aa	15-40 Diesel truck oil is very good choice for many motorcycles- much better than the 10-30 new car oils with low zinc content that lacks cushioning and sliding friction capabilities. I have run the diesel oil in Harley's and BMW's- shops have noted it as acceptable for the air cooled engines under normal use. 20-50 Valvoline motorcycle oil for hottest days or racing preferred for some use- straight 50 in desert racing .  The diesel sped CD oils are high detergent, high stress capable, high heat capable- best choice at most gas station on road now.  straight 40 weight diesel oil was used a lot in old Panheads and sportsters in 1970s when I started riding- dealer recommended as available on road trips. .|`|72ddVB2iaa	I don't understand why people think they can outsmart the engineers that developed the formulation for motorcycle engines. How can an oil designed for a huge, lazy, sooty engine that red-lines under 4,000 RPM be a good choice for a small, high revving, high tolerance motorcycle engine, some of which spin up to 15,000 RPM?<br>  <br>  I just don't get it. <br>  <br>  I buy conventional motorcycle oil in the grade that my manual tells me to buy, and I have never had a problem.<br>  <br>  Edit: Great link "Mr. Natural" Thanks!|`|d9ECb7N8aa	I run Rotella 15-40 in in my truck ('97 gas motor) and my bike ('94 Kawasaki KLX 650.<br>  <br>  I haven't had any problems.

I've never tried it, but if the manufacturer ok's it, then it should be alright. Would I run it full time instead of the recommended luibricant? no way.<br>  ride safe|`|61mBhEAXaa	It has nothing to do with the viscosity of the oil, it has to do with the pressure ratings etc.  Newer 4 stroke engines run with higher compression, have stronger clutches and have severe torque on their gears.  I first read about this on adventure rider and then investigated it further online.  If you only trust what the dealer tells you (and your doctor too) then do what they say.  My first experience was with a brand new '85 quadsport.  First oil change after break in using Genuine Suzy oil, the clutch sounded horrible and I had to adjust the idle up.  One short ride made me think the engine was falling apart.  Drained the oil to look for metal, found none.  Changed oil to Castro GTX.... noise went away and I had to adjust the idle back down.  I have other experiences that have taught me to trust oils made by people who specialize in oil, not making bikes.  I'm not claiming to be an expert, just sharing what I've learned.  With a few searches, you can find the chemical experts who can explain why diesel formulated oils are better in these situations.    BTW  Rotella T 15-40 in my '00 DRZ for last 3 years (approx 4,000 mi) and in my '00 Pegaso for the last 12,000 mi.  My kids still put Castol in the quadsport and the engine has never been apart.|`|AA11537248	There's very little difference between 15w40 and 10w40 oil.  I don't suppose that using one in place of the other would cause any damage.<br>  <br>  In fact, I've known bikers who claim that the thicker oil makes the bike shift easier and quieter.<br>  <br>  You should follow the instructions and specifications that come with a new bike so you don't void any warranties.|`|kgk3Yz9Naa	well i wouldn't be putting that in a bike...let alone a ktm...stick with the makers recommended oil.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	DIesel oil has a different designation than the others. It is a "c" rated oil. Some oils are rated in both "s" (gasoline) and "c" rated (diesel). Check the container for clarity. I personally would not use the Rotella oil in anything!! It breaks down too quickly and leaves deposits. Be certain, ask at the motorcycle dealer. You can't go wrong that way!|`|E0j6mhqhaa	Good going curmedgeon, someone finally hit the nail on the head.  Newer gasoline oils as well as the latest diesel oils are low zinc, something that's important for reducing cam lobe wear.  If your engine of any type has roller tappets, it doesn't matter but most bikes don't.  As mentioned, go for the CD oils and not the latest CF or whatever they are.  In short, look for oils made for older diesel engines whether farm tractors, trucks or whatever.
AA10346371	This is too broad of a question to give a simple answer.  This will mostly depend on the size motorcycle you are talking about.<br>  <br>  When you are saying naked bike I am assuming you mean a standard bike.<br>  <br>  I will use Suzuki motorcycles as an example.  The other major manufacturers will have similar pricing for similar bikes.<br>  <br>  The Suzuki TU250X has a MSRP of $3799.

AA11435704	When you rent a space in a parking garage, where you park yourself, rather than a valet situation where the parking garage parks the car for you, the owner and management of the lot are not responsible for damage or theft. <br>  <br>  Unless you actually have a reason to believe that the car hit you (matching damage on his car) then by leaving a note you have accused them of a crime (hit and run) that they may not have committed.

The space next to you could have been vacant and someone using it to turn around could have hit your car. <br>  <br>  Right now, your best bet is get and estimate of the cost of repair, and see how much would be covered by your insurance after the deductible.|`|gUCjkj9oaa	this is a tough legal situation unless you have a witness or a video,just because a person was parked next to you doesn't6 mean that they hit you.A kid with a baseball bat could have done it or someone passing by could have hit you on purpose. What I recommend is looking at the plkace on the car where you were hit and looking for paint or bumper material from the other car,the police lab can match it up.|`|96DnmD7baa	Hi...sweety I think the person car who actually hit your car are long gone. If not he/she will put a note on your windscreen telling you to contact them. I thinks that happen only 1 in a thousand. Mostly they put up sign " Park at your own risk "  at parking area mall,complex,hotel,etc. but some private own Entertainment outlet they will withhold the driver if any accident happen in their car park, they either announce or project your car regis. no the big screen.<br>  If you can' t proof who hit your car, the only way is repair and pay by yourself if its not badly hit, or claim your own insurance if it is a comprehensive policy but this will make you lost your NCB ( no claim bonus ).|`|2qIg8Tunaa	What Fire4511 said.
e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	They would likely offer you about $26K for it. <br>  Any curb rash is going to put it in 'Good' condition. <br>  Excellent truly means 'flawless' to a dealer. <br>  <br>  Been through CarMax before.  <br>  They will show you you the KBB value and won't include either the Navigation, sports package or the premium package (maybe all 3) in the options and tell you that they are paying you what KBB says. <br>  <br>  It doesn't hurt to get an estimate, though.  If you are not purchasing a new car, maybe sell it for $1,000 more than Carmax appraises it.  Eventually, you will get some bites.|`|mTwn8p79aa	Dealers use Black Book to show you what your trade in is worth.  It's a little lower than NADA or KBB.  You can't find it for free on your own but expect a little less than KBB trade in for fair condition.<br>  <br>  Sorry, according to KBB's ratings definitions, the curb rash damage definitely knocks it out of KBB's "excellent" condition and possibly puts it in their "fair" category.  That being said, the damage won't affect their offer too much, it'll just be an arguing point they'll use to show you why it's worth less.<br>  <br>  If you're planning on purchasing a car, you're absolutely right about the end of the month theory.  Dealers want to sell a certain number of vehicles a month and they're always short of where they'd like to be so they are always willing to make their best deals on the last weekend of the month.  But, if you're just planning on selling this car to them and not purchasing a new one, there'll be no added incentive for them to take it.  While trade ins are desirable to dealers, there are no trade in numbers that dealers try to hit.  You might actually be a little better off right at the beginning of the month so it could be on the lot for a full month and they could try to hit that all important monthly sales goal with your car instead of having it put them one more car negative at the end of the month.|`|66RyCXasaa	Car Max will offer you what they can buy that very car for at Wholesale any day of the week.<br>  <br>  KBB/Edmund's/et.al. are guides, nothing more.<br>  <br>  They are a retailer, so they buy at wholesale and sell at retail.

He said it was listing for 10k on kelly's, and Nada, however... Carmax only offered him 6K!!!  They would not deal, and said what their computer says, goes.  I've seen his car, and it was mint, with decent milage.  Needless to say, he left Carmax upset, and insulted.  He sold it a week later, privately for 11k.  He said if they had offered him 8k, he would've taken it, but Carmax seems to be stubborn, and preys only on gullible people, or those in desperate need.  You'll get more selling it outright ,but in this economy, you may have to take what you can get.  Sorry.

q23Ynbu3aa	Im in the uk and the day i passed the guy took my provisional to send off himself to the dvla asked me to sign a couple of papers to go with it and then handed me a pass certificate which has written my driver license number on it. I then got to drive my car home myself as i passed in my own car and was told if i was stopped or needed to show my license to anyone for any reason i.e police i guess i was to just show the certificate (kinda like my temporary license) and that my license would be with me very soon, it came within 10days. My insurance was still as a provisional driver so i did drive home with my Dad next to me but then when i got home i phoned my insurance company told them i passed so they changed that detail and got to go out by myself in my car that day.Insured as a full license driver. Hope this helped but it was a couple of years ago so if anything has changed i wouldn't know but the dvla are best to call they are very helpful to all callers.|`|AA11908567	If you have sent it, then you can drive it now - providing you are insured.|`|YFTZM86maa	You get your license the day you pass your driving test, but be sure to have $ for it.|`|jBlWT6UQaa	I passed my test about 6weeks ago and what happens is once they say you pass you have to sign a couple of things and what they will do is hand you a Pass Certificate which is valid for 2 years what will happen then is you will have a choice on whether you send off your provisional licence with the document yourself or they send it off my advice to you would be to write down you driving licence number thing and then just incase they ask for it when you insure a car i doubt they will tho and that's really it <br>  <br>  The DVLA will not no you passed your test for about 1week which is fine because when you insure the car and you get stopped all you have to show is the certificate that you got on the day <br>  <br>  So effectively if you pass in the morning or lunch time and get a car insured and pay the full amount or paying monthly when 18 then you can drive off when you say i want the policy to start NOW!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|DV4xyeChaa	on the spot in my state virginia i mean Commonwealth|`|bttrB0Rfaa	You leave with it after passing

PIuEcCRPaa	diesel gets better mpg but it the cost difference that you want to factor in.|`|20LnuCejaa	The diesel will get better mileage, but in the US Diesel costs more per gallon than gas, so the benefits are negated.  Your engine is designed for a certain grade of gas.  Using a more expensive has no benefit and is a waste of money|`|FbtEvsIGaa	please read   be surprised .......diesel,gas ,or hybrid|`|TdrgZwnoaa	I could turn the wording of your question back on you and say that the gas engine would DEFINITELY get better gas mileage because you can't use gas in a diesel motor.<br>  <br>   If you are asking about FUEL mileage that's very debatable. There are too many variables involved to make an accurate assessment.<br>   All I can venture is that some do and some don't.<br>  <br>   In town a diesel will probably get better fuel mileage than a gas engine.|`|lHLDvVALaa	Diesel fuel contains more energy per unit volume than gasoline by a huge factor-I think it can be nearly twice the energy content under some circumstances. <br>  <br>  This means that, on a level playing field, a vehicle powered by a diesel engine will always travel further than an identical vehicle powered by gasoline. <br>  <br>  With that said, however, gasoline engines are a fair bit more efficient at converting the energy stored in the fuel to energy needed to move the vehicle forward. Thus, if one looks at environmental impact, a gasoline engine is substantially better, as it will travel further per unit volume of greenhouse gas emitted. <br>  <br>  For the end consumer, diesel is often more economical, since diesel isn't that much more expensive for the amount of energy gain it offers.

FbtEvsIGaa	look around your exhaust manifold see if oil is leaking on it,if it is get it fixed|`|HFrsH9MRaa	Perhaps your electric cooling fan switch has blown. Firstly, power wash your engine compartment until showroom new. Make sure that BOTH ends of your battery cables are perfectly clean. Also, power wash the space between the radiator and the A/C condenser. This is where dibris and rotten leaves collect,restricting air flow around both units. If you bought this car used, make sure that it has ONLY genuine Nissan brand coolant in it. Anything else will cause chemical reactions to occur in cooling system causing premature wear. Good Luck!!|`|aMELFGh0aa	The engine may be overheating. Is there water/antifreeze in the coolant reservoir? Check that first. The coolant reservoir is plastic with a lid on top. If it's empty or low you want to use a mixture of  50 percent water and 50 percent anti-freeze. If you have no anti-freeze you can use just water for now, but be sure to get anti-freeze in it as soon as possible or the water will freeze when it gets cold and then you won't be able to drive it. If filling the coolant reservoir does not help, don't drive the car any further until you know what the problem is because if the problem is the radiator or water pump, the engine could lock up and you do not want that. The same thing could happen if you put just water and no anti-freeze in it and it get's cold and the water freezes.
PIuEcCRPaa	at low rpms no|`|1UPwDfJgaa	yeah, maybe cuz the crank is spinning faster @ 25mph in say 1st gear and the inertia may give it a greater tendancy to slip.  As long as you're not driving around all day with the rev's at 6,000  RPM or higher you'll be alright.  I think it would damage your engine before your clutch.|`|lXIKeJQ8aa	First off the clutch and the transmission are two different units. No by being in the wrong gear you can not ruin the clutch. The clutch is used to disconnect the engine from the transmission. Being in the wrong gear can effect other parts of the vehicle such as the engine can be over sped by being in to low a gear or possibly the driver or passenger if you were in to high a gear and lugging the engine. Over speeding the engine can lead to catastrophic results, so you want to choose your gear carefully. I believe that your ear is one of your best tools when you are driving your car is trying to talk to you just listen.

My mom had one, and it was in the shop all the time even when relatively new. It was a huge piece of crap.<br>  <br>  They're nice looking and comfortable, and drive really well when they run. The "when they run" part is key, though. That's also not to mention the fact that it leaked like a sieve, to the point where there would be an inch of water standing on the carpet when it rained, and three trips to the dealer(fortunately under warranty) couldn't fix the problem. <br>  <br>  They handle well, but are woefully underpowered. They're a heavy car with not nearly a powerful enough engine. Cadillac really skimped by putting a V6 in-they should have had a V8. <br>  <br>  If you want something in the same vein but that's a whole lot better, look for a Lincoln LS or Cadillac CTS.

Going with a sport bike for your first bike is like getting a Formula 1 race car for your first car, not a good idea.  Also used sport bikes tend to be more abused.<br>  <br>  Consider the fit of the motorcycle.  People come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes.  So do motorcycles.  When selecting a motorcycle consider how well it fits your body.  Ask yourself how well you can put both feet flat on the ground.  Ask yourself how well the seating position feels.  Do you have to reach too far to the handlebars?  Riding hunched over can get uncomfortable very fast.  Is the foot peg location comfortable?  Does the bike feel too big or too small?  An uncomfortable motorcycle won't be much fun to ride for any amount of distance.  However, a bike that fits you well will be lots of fun.<br>  <br>  Avoid buying over the Internet.  I would never buy a motorcycle site unseen.  You could very easily end up paying too much for junk.  Always do a visual inspection and test ride before buying a motorcycle.  When you go to look at the bike, bring a helmet.  If you do not have your motorcycle license yet, bring a friend with a motorcycle license and 2 helmets.<br>  <br>  Watch the classified section of your local news paper.  Some locations have shopper magazines with used motorcycles in your area.  Reasonably priced used bikes are out there.  Be patient.  Don't buy too quickly, but if you find one you like, buy it right away.  Unfortunately, as the price of gas rises so will the price of used motorcycles.  If you find a good starter bike, don't hesitate as they can sell quickly.<br>  <br>  Don't get hung up on any particular brand.  They are all about the same.  Pay more attention to the bike's condition.  If any one brand were really superior to all other brands, this would be the only brand bike on the road.  In addition, if any brand bike was really inferior to the other brands, nobody would buy them and the company would be out of business.<br>  <br>  Learn on this bike.  Make your mistakes on it.  You will make mistakes.  Nearly all new riders will lay their bike on its side at least once.  Would you rather make your mistakes on an older bike or your nice shiny expensive new bike?<br>  <br>  The most important thing you should do when getting your first bike is to take a motorcycle safety course.<br>  <br>  After you have been riding a while and gain some experience, you can sell your starter bike and get the one you want.  If maintained properly and not abused, you won't lose too much money on your starter bike.  Put the money from the sale towards the bike you really want.  By this time, you will have figured out what style bike best suits your riding style and needs.<br>  <br>  If you settle on a sport bike for your next bike, avoid the used ones.  Young riders think they are racers on racing bikes and tend to beat the crap out of them so they are likely to be more abused.  So if considering a sport bike, consider something new. <br>  <br>  I know I used this answer before.  However, I feel this is good advice.<br>  <br>  Use your head while riding.  Remember, Stupid Hurts.<br>  <br>  Have fun - Ride safe|`|w00zZjNkaa	Be cautious in what you wish for. . . 1000 for any beginner is just too much muscle.  If you are a bigger person, 600 - 750 would probable do you.  You want to stay in that range so you don't bog in higher speeds and become more of a hazard.  No offense to any H.D.'ers out there, but I would look for someting Honda 1982-1990 Sabre, Magna, now Shadow style.  Not too much differences in ride, and parts are everywhere/common for them.  They were popular enough parts should be available for a good amount of time to come.|`|5MXn7lkYaa	Do you want an automatic or manual transmission?  If you want an automatic, lookup QLink V3 or V5.<br>  <br>  Jim|`|miyAb7cQaa	Good luck.|`|66330e3e02cf842abd0afbe305025613aa	I dont know any 650 and 1100cc scooters. I think you need to decide firstly what sort of  riding expierence your looking for.<br>  do you just want a vehicle  to travel to n from the local shops and work?- if so something up to 550cc would be fine. Depending on the distances, a Sym scooter, a japanese motorcycle like a Honda 125 street bike, or perhaps a Suzuki GS500.<br>  You looking for something  sporty, that can be used on the road or  track days... CBR600, R6 or similar. If your a novice dont go for the CBR1000- as youll probably end up  seriously injured as its not a machine for begineers.<br>  <br>  You also need to take into concideration your hieght and wieght. Some bikes are suited to tall people and slim people( super sports bikes with race bars)|`|8FgvTY7laa	I was having the same conundrum you were having.  Motorcycles you find under $2000 will generally be a) used, b) old (or older), c) more prone to problems (even if currently running well), d) more likely to have current problems the owner hasn't addressed (EG: master cyclinder needs replacement, or rust in tank), e) parts are harder to fine the older the bike gets.  Finding a 600/1000cc motorcycle under $2000 is very unlikely, and will be even more prone to the issues I just talked about.<br>  <br>  So, I nixed the motorcyle idea, and went with a scooter.  Skip the 50cc's.  While they don't have to get registered, etc, they don't have enough horsepower to haul a 200lb+ individual.  Instead, start with a 150cc scooter.  I got a Chinese-made Roketa Eagle 150-T ... the "T" stands for "turbo", because instead of the usual 8-8.5hp 150cc engine, it has a 9.5hp engine.  This thing hauls butt.  I easily get it up to 40-50mph, which is all I need for round-the-town riding to/from school & work.  It definitely keeps up with traffic, and folks are surprised at how nimble and fast it is.  (They're used to seeing those slow 50cc's running around.)  It's not a highway bike by any means.  But, it's beefy enough to do the job, and it's not a "wimpy" looking scooter.  The 50cc's tend to look wimpy, but a 150cc is not.  You get easily get a new 150cc scooter for under $2000.  I got mine for $800 on special at a local imports motor sport shop.  They can do maintenance work, etc on it if need be.  For the most part, though, all a new scooter needs is to just have the oil & "transmission fluid" (also oil) changed regularly.  If you keep up with that regular maintenance, it'll be reliable for a very long time.<br>  <br>  Regardless of scooter or motorcycle, get motorcycle gloves (good protection for hands), and a FULL motorcycle helmet, not a half-shell or what-not.  When the wind starts hitting your face-shield, a partial helmet will allow the wind to creep under the visor and blow on your face, drying out your eyes.  If you get a full helmet, then it helps prevent that problem.  Plus, you can later move from scooter to motorcycle and keep using the same gear.  The scooter cost me $800, helmet/gear ~$150-200 (good quality gear), registration/title/inspection ~$200 more.  So, for under $2000, a new 150cc scooter that's reliable and can get around town is not bad.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	For a learner bike, you want to go really small. I started on a Honda Rebel 250 and that was definitely enough bike for me! Once I got used to it I moved up to a 600. You really can't get a good bike that's a 600 or 1000 for less than $3000.|`|fbxqLErlaa	Take a look at used dual sports.<br>  I ride a Kawasaki KLR 650.  Can be had for your price range.  Easy to work on.  Lots of aftermarket parts and accessories.<br>  I have added a Staintune pipe and rejetted the carb.  Runs a lot better than stock.  <br>  This is a good beginners machine.  Stay away from sport bikes for your first ride.<br>  Please read article below.<br>  Good Luck

zhk8o514aa	Well one way to find out! Place news paper underneath where you park.  Then check the spot again after a hour.

ThEm8DCkaa	The battery could be dead if there is a problem with your charging system. Try to jump start it. If it starts, you need to troubleshoot your charging system. If it doesn't start, you need a mechanic. A crankshaft position sensor is a big deal.
