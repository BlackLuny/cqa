An atheism-promoting organization has withdrawn its lawsuit demanding Christian baptisms of children be banned in Italy after a U.S.-based legal team took on the defense of a bishop and the Roman Catholic Church there.      "This was a preposterous lawsuit, and we are pleased that it has been dropped," said Joseph Infranco, a senior counsel for the Arizona-based Alliance Defense Fund.      However, he said, "Americans should be aware that such lawsuits may seem far-fetched, but they really are happening … and foreign legal decisions are increasingly cited in American courts."      The ADF stepped into the battle when the Italian Union of Rationalist Atheists and Agnostics filed a lawsuit seeking an end to all baptisms of children in Italy. The organization alleged the practice encroached on its religious freedom and violated Italian Constitutional Court precedents regarding free will and personal privacy in religious decisions         and more :  http://worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PA...

A little kid is more important then an animal, and I won't buy products that aren't tested on animals." That makes me mad! Animals are so misunderstood, and I'd never give my pets life for a person to create more hate in the world. (yes, i know people are animals, but SOME people act barbarically about animal testing) Are they just ignorant? I still love people, just animals come first since people selfishly put other people first. What's your opinion? No rude answers please, just your opinions.

So I've been questioning my sexuality a lot, and I have kind of always, even from a young age, found women to be very very sexy. I know I am definitely attracted to men, but I am not sure if I am attracted to women too. Can anyone help me? How did you know when you were bisexual? I just am so confused right now. And how do you "come out" if you are bisexual??? I know so many people who think that being bisexual is just a "cover up" for someone who is lesbian, or someone who cannot make up their mind between being heterosexual and homosexual. I personally do not believe either. I feel like people are born with their sexuality, but I'm just not sure what mine is. I just want to know how to find out. It's really confusing.      Thanks for all your help.

20090130145426AAWUf7X	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Spiritually speaking, are there spiritual black holes, like when you die you could be absorbed by an entity?	This probably isn't one of my better questions, but give it a shot if you like... What I am referring to is energy, and how energy can be absorbed and used or contained, Wiccans know of this, so if you had somewhere with a huge disaster and many deaths, could all that energy be absorbed by someone or something? Like if you ever played final fantasy 7 and Sephiroth absorbs the planets energy where it is wounded when the spirit energy on the planet leaves it's shell, for example if a meteor hit an area and caused huge destruction, the planet would gather energy to heal the wound, could one with great knowledge of this absorb the energy? And yes, this may be beyond what you call an "insane" question, but I don't go by labels. This is not a personal question, I am only interested in what you think, mmk?

I'm bisexual and i'm not doing it for attention like 50005298345729 other people. i only want my mum to know. i told my mum and she said "if you have a choice between boys and girls, why don't you ******* choose girls and stop messing up everyones lives" im MADLY in love with my best friend and my mum keeps telling me to give it up. even if there is a chance. she said he couldnt spend the night anymore. i have no father, so i go to her and ask her everything (personal questions). out of everyone i thought she would be accepting. she went through all my texts i had gay ones on there. which ******* sucked. shes so hurtful. i wish it was okay to be gay. but apparently not. she said two 'girls' got kicked out of school for experimenting, and was like do u want to be that kid? there is a chance i could go out with my best friend, there is that chance. shes crushing my hopes. i just want someone to finally say go for it, and stop telling me to give up...... i dont know where to turn. i feel like running away and never coming back.

20070115215832AAx0yLu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did you know wine distillation was invented by an Arabian physician named Abul Kasim in the 10th century?	The first recorded mention of distillation was made by Abul Kasim, a 10th-century Arabian physician. At first only wine was distilled, but soon afterward other fermented products were employed. The process of distillation not only concentrates the alcohol, but also removes from the beverage a large portion of the unpleasant-tasting impurities. If rectification (purification by repeated or by fractional distillation) is carried too far, however, all the flavoring elements are removed with the impurities, and pure alcohol is produced. Consequently, in the distillation of potable liquor, the process is only partly completed, and the remaining impurities are removed by filtration of the liquor through charcoal and by aging in charred wooden barrels. During aging, the impurities, which consist mostly of a mixture of higher alcohols, are in part oxidized to acids that react with the remaining alcohols to form pleasantly flavored esters. The flavoring material remaining in the finished bevera

Since God created humans, then we have more spirituality in us than all the religions put together.      religion is spiritual fraud, since most of what religion tries to teach us is untrue/false.      God gave each and every human a Soul.    This is the Spiritual connection we have with God.      God gave each and every human a Heart.   This is the Love connection we have with God.      Remember, God Loves each and every one that Our Creator has created.   especially humans in religions!      Only with the Love and Peace of God's, we will truly be Free and able to return back to our starting place, Heaven.

20090130162606AAUiQ6X	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question to do with free will?	I have been observing the back and forth arguements on Yahoo! Answers and I think I can settle them.      Free will is in everyone, the laws which people say they must obey in society are laws they CHOOSE to obey because of the "consequences" they have. I say, if it is unsafe to go swimming because you may drown, why go swimming? One could delude themselves wih false security to the point where they live in a small box, a comfortable zone where they hide from the "dangers" of the world. If it is a "danger" to travel by airplane, why do we still do it? Will you always do what you are told for a sense of security? Will you give up your freedom for security? I feel the only thing you can be seure in is yourself, because with so many lies and opinions outside of you, how does one discern one from the other? One could perhaps become so confused that they turn to those in power to help them, like governments, presidents, principals, etc. If someone tells you to pick who's going to die, and kept torturing you until you did, and told you to pick between a rapist and a saint, who would you choose? What is the "moral" choice? Do you think you have a choice? You can choose to defy the person who tells you to choose. As long as you have control over what you do, I mean as long as you can choose physically to lead yourself or follow, who really has the control? Even if you are tied up and tortured, can you not spit in the face of your tormenter? If you read the bible, can you not choose to defy "god"? If you are an Atheist, do you not choose what you believe? So then, where is the real truth? Simply put, it is UN-common sense. Look any further than what you know and you lose your ability to see right, if you "know" something, that makes it true only for you, in this way perhaps you shape reality, why accept another persons reality? Truth is love. Knowledge is power. Ignorance won't stop the train from hitting you if you are standing on the train tracks and deny the train is coming at you.   Thanks for reading, please give your opinions. I may have not made myself perfectly clear, but I have faith in what I believe, which is myself. That can never be taken from me.

He was "black"[i don't know if he was African American] but his skin color was not "white".         This was a long time ago and so they said he took a "black" man and a "black" woman and made them have sex. Then there kids came out and he made them have sex. He played with pigment in there skin. He kept making brothers and sisters have sex and then like there skin started getting lighter and lighter and after a long time he created "white" people.         Okay i know what you are thinking but, hey who knows what REALLY happened. I would like to have any links or anything about this mad scientist to know more. I always knew that "black" people were first on earth but, I thought they just migrated further and further and then there skin ,over time, started to lighten.

And also, it's strange that from the moment he became famous he didn't live very long. This is very suspicious.

20090130174727AANFQ94	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians how do you explain on a job interviews about losing your last job?	I use to work at a thrift store in Mitchell Indiana. After working there for three months, my boss quit and they hired a new manager. Well the new manager would come back after talking with a donor and would always complain about them to me. Someone had bad breathe, someone was fat. Someone brought in ugly donation. She always had something negative to say about the donors or the customers. For the first week, I told her numerous of times, not to come back and tell me these things because I really don't care to hear about it. Well after the second week, I went and told the pastor and the director who was in charge of running this thrift store. They suggest that I ignore her and not respond. Well that did not stop. So I asked the pastor could he at least talk to her. When they did not work, I wrote her a letter telling her that if she had a problem with the customer, or donor take it up with them. Just stop coming back and telling me. She gave the letter to my the director and I was fired. He said that since we couldn't get along he was going to have to let someone go and I was let go.       Two weeks later, some of the customers came and asked me why I quit. I told them that I did not quit, That I was fired. Well, they are telling people down at the store you quit. I told them why they were telling people I quit. If people found out I was fired because of the letter, the store would lose business.       Any how. When I go out on interviews, I tell people this story and they look at me like I'm crazy. As if a church thrift store was not capable of doing wrong. lol.. I am tired of telling people this story when they asked me about my working at the thrift store. Do you have any suggestion of what I should say?

20090130165515AA4g9bL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does the Catholic church have sole authority to interpret scripture?	I heard this Catholic priest say that only the Catholic church can interpret the Bible. His sole reason was because the Catholic church chose the canon, and so the Bible is a product of the church, hence, accepting the Bible IS accepting the church's traditions.      Without getting into the question of canon, I am wondering...         ...wouldn't this same logic mean that only the jewish priests and scribes could properly interpret the Old Testament during the first century, since they "determined the canon"? And since those men rejected Jesus' claims, wouldn't that also mean that there should BE no Christian or catholic church?       But, if there is no catholic church, then the argument doesn't exist...it's kind of like that timetraveler killing his grandfather bit...      ...can anyone help me out here?

20090130174545AAQc8Vj	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists, Are Your Beliefs Consistent with Your Worldview?	Before the 20th century, atheists assumed that the universe was eternal. However, beginning with Einstein's theory of general relativity, and early observational evidence, it became apparent that the universe was expanding. Extrapolating back in time revealed that the universe was merely billions of years old. The data eventually led to the "Big Bang" theory, which is virtually universally accepted by modern day cosmologist. Attempts to get around the idea that the universe had a beginning have all met with observational difficulties. The idea that the universe could have gone through an infinite number of births and deaths (the oscillating universe theory) was shown to be false on the basis of the lack of amount of matter within the universe, and the fact that any collapse would have led to a "Big Crunch" instead of another Big Bang. So, we have come to realize that the universe first began to exist 13.7 billion years ago. Atheists are left with a dilemma, since their worldview requires that all things that begin to exist must have a cause. So, logic requires the admission that the universe had a cause. Virtually all atheists say that this cause was some natural phenomenon. It is also possible that the cause of the universe was a supernatural intelligence (i.e., God). However, there is no direct observational evidence for either belief. Those who are "strong atheists" (not working out in the gym, but having a belief that no god exists) have just violated one of the main rules of atheism - that all beliefs are based upon observational evidence. So, any atheist who denies the possible existence of God violates his own worldview.      The problem actually gets worse for the atheist. The physical laws of the universe fall within very narrow ranges in order for life (or even matter) to exist, suggesting some level of design. If true, then the observational evidence actually leans toward the existence of God, contradicting strong atheism. The prospect of finding a naturalistic cause for the origin of the universe is bleak at best, since the laws of physics indicate that we will never be able escape the bounds of our universe to even attempt to look for the cause of the universe.      A skeptic or atheist is governed by two main principles: 1) all beliefs must be supported by observational evidence, and 2) beliefs that contradict observational evidence cannot be tolerated. However, strong atheism states that there is no god, even though observational evidence indicates that the universe has a cause that cannot be detected observationally. So despite the lack of observational evidence for a naturalistic cause for the universe, the strong atheist believes that the universe has a naturalistic cause and that there is no god, contradicting the tenet that all beliefs should be based upon observational evidence.

Okay- so i just answered a question about why Jesus is depicted as Caucasian in most paintings if he was 'brown'. Some of the answers were 'Its relative- in africa Jesus is black' etc.       How can it be relative? Either he's white, black, brown, purple or green. You can't decide and give him whatever colour you want him to be. Why don't you see picture of a black Elvis in Africa, or an Asian Tupac in China?

20090130164922AAT62XE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christian = faith alone in Jesus without works, Jesus is 100% sufficient to save ?	One person has stated this      Christian = faith alone in Jesus without works, Jesus is 100% sufficient to save      Catholicism = faith + works, but works don't save anyone (Galatians 1:6-9).      The difference is obvious. Only the willfully rebellious refuse to acknowledge it.      So does that mean I can believe in Jesus and Jesus is 100% sufficient to save, I can go out and sin and not ask for forgiveness and I still will go to Heaven because I believe in Jesus?      Cool sounds good (not)
20090130163342AAmhd5z	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians believe that Jesus died for us?	Being a Christian means following Jesus Christ.

We also believe that Jesus was God come down from heaven who "became flesh and made his dwelling among us" (John 1:14).      Catholics believe the same thing, so why do people say we are not Christians?

20090130154004AAtNGS9	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I need HELP with this!!! This doesn't make ANY sense!!! Why didn't God destroy him?	Lucifer (the devil) was created perfect but he rebelled against God but God didn't destroy him?    God then created humanity and they rebelled against God.  Now all humanity (except Noah & family) are destroyed in a flood but God still lets the devil and his evil angels live only to continue tempting and twisting humanity again God.  So God sends fire down to destroy Sodom & Gomorrah for their sins and of course God doesn't do anything to the devil since he will be doing the same until the end were God will again destroy all humanity (all who were left behind that are evil) in His second coming when God appears in the clouds.    Im not getting this where is the logic behind all this human destruction if the devil is actually tempting and causing humanity to sin and yet the devil isn't stopped?    And lets not mention that all the people (that means infants too) that died in the flood will also be sent to hell to burn also!    God is destroying humans (note: infants too) for being wicked yet keeping the devil around until the very end???

20090130172627AAMozft	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Serious question to all Christians?	First everyone take a look at this picture and ponder for a little bit       http://www.wissenschaft-online.de/astrow...       Finished pondering?      Now, in case you arent familiar with this photo, it was taken by our most powerful telescope a while ago. This picture contains billions of galaxies but for arguments sake lets say 1 billion. Lets say each contains only 1 solar system, which for arguments sake, lets say each contain 10 planets (Keep in mind this photo is not the entire universe, if the universe were the earth, this photo would represent one atom if even). So now we are at 10 billion to one. Now lets say the odds for one of these planets having life is 1:1billion (meaning they have water, sun etc). This would mean that chances are, 10 planets in this photo have life (10 divided by 1). Now this is just a tiny piece of the universe. With this information, and our knowledge about the approximate size of the universe (156 lightyears wide) chances are there are endless amounts of planets that could contain life. Lets say for arguments sake 1 billion. Now, heres the main question, do you really suppose that each of these 1 BILLION planets read the bible? Do you think they have the same God, if any, that you do? If you do or do not please explain why and of course anybody can answer.      By the way to put 1 billion into perspective, if you were to count to 1 billion from this moment on, it would take you 95 years.      The main question is, with all this information, do you really believe that they follow the same bible, same commandments, same jesus, same moses as you do? If not, is there are there different bible versions across the universe? Which one is correct?

Well that was until 8th grade. When I was in 8th grade I was on the computer and accidentally typed the name of a website wrong. It turned out being some website with lesbians making out in their underwear. Nobody was home and I was curios, so i watched it. I always thought that 2 girls being together would be nasty, but It wasn't. I actually LOVED it. It was sooo hot and it really turned me on. I ended up going to these websites everyday because I liked it so much. And I eventually started masturbating to the thought of lesbians making out and having sex. It convinced me that I was bi, so I tried out a girl relationship. I was happy that I cold except myself but when the relationship actually got started, I was disgusted. It sounds horrible, I know, but it just made me feel sick to my stomach at the actual though of being with a girl. So I ended the relationship. Now I'm in high school and I'm STILL confused. Girl on girl action is extremely hot and I constantly fantasise about it, but being with a girl made me feel sick. Idk if I'm Bi or not....Please help me figure this out!      All answers are appreciated, thanks in advance.

If Jesus said 'love your enemies, by doing this you will heap burning coals into their lap' then shouldn't we try to love even Osama Bin Laden?   This doesn't seem a big deal, since he forgave those who killed him, i.e. those who killed God himself in the flesh - the worse thing imaginable   According to Jesus this would sap all his power and he would in fact be the loser since his hate filled message would be nullified by our love   Doesn't this make the war on terror anti-Christian since it is the opposite of loving your enemy?   and If this is so then was Jesus right or wrong considering the situation today where hating the enemy only seems to make them stronger?

20090130175401AA4cyte	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why did God give my husband this amazing ability?	My husband is able to drive - even in lots of snow and ice, mind you - without even looking at where he's going!! The only thing that's required for this amazing talent to kick in is a cute young girl walking down the street. And he's so humble about it! Even when I think I have to say "Watch the road, ***hole",  he *already knows* that I'm wrong and that he is watching. He proves me wrong every time by *****ing about what other drivers are doing. And damn me if he isn't right! Is he a gem, or what? I'm thinking he might be a prophet.

20090130154754AAQcJ0O	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How come Jesus doesn't ever say anything?	The thing that troubles me is that everybody who claims Jesus told them something, it's always just one person -- seems Jesus never talks to people in twos or threes or more...    And the person who does hear from Jesus never gets a recording of it.      Could someone just once get a recording of it when Jesus talks to them?     And could Jesus just once talk to more than one person at a time?  Would it be too much trouble for him to speak to a group, even a small group?        Until then I must continue to ask:  How come Jesus never says anything?    .

I've had a thing for her since I first met her, but while we've worked together on a lot of school related stuff, we haven't really hung out outside of school.  I asked around and found out that she is a lesbian too so I asked her out.  It was an ok time, but really awkward, and since then I don't know what to think.  The eye contact and the joking are there, but either she is waiting for me to make another move or she just isn't into me.  I can't really tell.  There is a bit of an age gap too: I'm 30 and she's 23.  Should I risk making life here at school really awkward and ask her out again?  We have another 18 months that we have to work together...

20090130173426AAbNDsN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Think about this and tell me what you think?  ?	I've been thinking about this for a long time throughout my life, and I think I'm starting to get my head around it. I'm not sure whether this supports theism or atheism or agnosticism or whatever, but I've found it has in way change my perspective (although that might be over dramatic :D).      Many people argue that the universe must have been created because it must have had a beginning. I've had many people tell me that scientist are trying to find out what was before the big bang. I've heard people say the universe must have been created because something can't come from nothing. There are hundreds of these sorts of arguments and problems out there, that in my opinion, all rely on assumptions that us human beings make and imagine, simply because we base what is beyond (or any other preposition) our universe on what we know and trust with our own perspective and proved science.      The argument that everything must have been created or had a beginning because everything has a beginning, I find, is assumptive, because it relies on the belief that time is universal, and exists in the same form outside our universe, if at all. Perhaps events could be caused not beforehand, but afterward instead, or events may not even need a cause. Perhaps times could floe in a different direction, or perhaps no direction at all, or in a way we can't imagine. Perhaps there is no time there, or here, or anywhere, or everywhere, or no where, and again in places and things I can't form in my mind completely.      The argument that the universe must have been created because something can't come from nothing, is again, assumptive, because we're assuming that rules of our universe still apply. Perhaps outside the universe, something can come from nothing, or something can come from something that is not nothing but not something but not in between or anything (headache anyone?).      Also, I've heard people saying that if there is no time and space outside the universe, then there is nothing. Again, I find this assumptive because it's saying that time and space are the only things that exist, and that nothing is the absences of everything or anything etc. Also (mabye I'm going too far with thus?), because nothing in a sense can be measured, and in itself is an actual thhing, it itself is not nothing(!??).      I still find it all very confusing, however it has helped me feel like I have a much broader imagination.      Can anyone who reads this tell what you think? Am I the next great philosipher or am I just completely cu-cu? :D

20090130184238AA8b1rn	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Need advice from fellow atheists?	Two years ago I was still sort of kinda a Christian. My uncle passed away around that time. I went to go see him at the viewing the day before his funeral. It was the first and only dead human I've ever seen and that image has been stuck in my mind ever since.       Especially lately. Recently I just heard the song they happened to be playing when I went to go see him. The memory of that day has come back to me only this time I don't believe in heaven anymore. I just realized how really difficult it is to think about a dead loved one and think about how there is no heaven. I've already been on anti depressants and upset for a while now, but this has just made things worse.       Most atheists here have most likely been an atheist for a while now and probably have dealt with death as an atheist. How did you do this?   How did you learn to cope with that idea that you will never see them again?

20090130184347AAp2Dvc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, should we call God Jehovah? ?	Seeing how the name Jehovah is in error as far as the translation of the YHVH.  And besides that,  Jesus taught us how to pray, starting His prayer as "Our Father, which is in heaven"  And, since we are adopted and have become the sons of God, shouldn't we also call Him Father?      Gal 4:6 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

20090130185034AAlBrZS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is this just a "coincidence" in the Bible or was God in the centre of it?	Even if you are not religious, you should read this!      What is the shortest chapter in the Bible? Psalms 117      What is the longest chapter in the Bible? Psalms 119      Which is in the middle? Psalms 118      There are 594 chapters before Psalms 118 and there are 594 chapters after Psalms 118.      Add them up and you get 1188      What is the centre verse in the Bible? Psalms 118:8       PSALMS 118:8 "It is better to trust in the Lord, than to put your confidence in man." (NKJV)

20090130191009AAF3ziu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is the bible still fact if the existence of god is not absolute fact?	If so how can this be?  My interpretation of what the bible says about having faith in god and the bible you will learn to know god.  Which to me means that the bible is telling me god and the bible and religion are beliefs not absolute fact.  The Knowing of god could be the knowledge you learn about him, that would satisfy the meaning of to know god.  We need to understand that the more faith we have about something the more it becomes fact to us, even if it isn't true.  Iam not saying the bible and god aren't true as i don't know.  But again if you look of the definitions of (knowing and fact)  you will see that you can know something and it not be a fact.  The only reason for this question is to see if the religous folks who say god and the bible are absolutely fact, can see my point about if they are beliefs or facts. Not trying to offend anyone,  I wonder some times if relilgious folks think by recognizing that their beliefs in god and the bible are only beliefs that somehow there faith would be shaken.         And especially since the bible itself and many heads of religion tell you that you have to have faith. Which is (a belief) not a fact, even though some day they may be proven to be facts

Although the story is intentionally ambiguous, the tale of Sodom & Gomorrah was more about in-hospitality and greediness in regards to strangers than anything else.  Lot was considered "kind" in giving the mob outside his door his 2 virgin daughters to do with as they wished in order to protect his 2 house guests from harm.     Would any sane Christian in this day an age follow Lot's Christian example to be hospitable?  Would any Christian fear Hell if they didn't follow Lot's example in this story?    Personally, I'd chose Hell before following this example of hospitality although I do give to the poor & needy, (within limits of course).

20090130181818AApIBcN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Will you think about this (part 2)?	And then the tears came. I began to weep. Sobs so deep that they hurt..    They started in my stomach and shook through me. I fell on my knees and    cried. I cried out of shame, from the overwhelming shame of it all. The    rows of file shelves swirled in my tear-filled eyes. No one must ever,    ever know of this room. I must lock it up and hide the key. But then as I    pushed away the tears, I saw Him.       No, please not Him. Not here. Oh, anyone but Jesus. I watched helplessly    as He began to open the files and read the cards. I couldn't bear to watch    His response. And in the moments I could bring myself to look at His face,    I saw a sorrow deeper than my own.       He seemed to intuitively go to the worst boxes. Why did He have to read    every one? Finally He turned and looked at me from across the room. He    looked at me with pity in His eyes. But this was a pity that didn't anger    me.. I dropped my head, covered my face with my hands and began to cry    again. He walked over and put His arm around me. He could have said so    many things.. But He didn't say a word. He just cried with me.       Then He got up and walked back to the wall of files. Starting at one end    of the room, He took out a file and, one by one, began to sign His name    over mine on each card. 'No!' I shouted rushing to Him. All I could find    to say was 'No, no,' as I pulled the card from Him. His name shouldn't be    on these cards. But there it was, written in red so rich, so dark, so    alive. The name of Jesus covered mine. It was written with His blood. He    gently took the card back.. He smiled a sad smile and began to sign the    cards. I don't think I'll ever understand how He did it so quickly, but    the next instant it seemed I heard Him close the last file and walk back    to my side.       He placed His hand on my shoulder and said, 'It is finished.' I stood up,    and He led me out of the room. There was no lock on its door. There were    still cards to be written.       'I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. '-Phil. 4:13 'For    God so loved the world that He gave His only son, that whoever believes in    Him shall not perish but have eternal life.' If you feel the same way    forward it so the love of Jesus will touch their lives also.. My 'People I    shared the gospel with' file just got bigger, how about yours?

20090130185345AAvsZze	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why does the USA hold onto ancient ideas?	I mean the rest of the western/developed world is moving away from religion yet in the US it seems strong as ever. I understand countries in South America, Africa etc who still hold onto these beliefs for in a lot of these places they face great difficulties(poverty, war, disease etc)so it's their only hope a lot of the time.      Now you may have seen me use this in several answers on here, but it is all fact(not atheist propaganda like some will say).........      The USA is the most religious western country and most Christian country(80% claim to be Christian)which is amusing because it has the highest crime rates, one of the lowest education rates(for western countries)and has one of the highest poverty rates(for western countries again). Also look at its wars in recent history and its intolerance to certain groups and people(gay, abortion etc).       Then on the other hand you have Sweden the most atheist country(85%)and its the exact opposite. One of the best welfare systems, lowest crime rates, one of the highest educated nations in the world and is extremely tolerant(although Scandanavia does have some of the highest suicide rates which is attributed to climate/lack of light etc not religion before you start harping on). When did you last see the Swedes invading a country controversially?       What does that say about religion, morals and quality of life?      With the above in mind why do we need religion? Sweden, as with a lot of northern Europe, gets on fine without it and a lot of countries are moving this way.       Why is the USA the only country not doing so when all the evidence goes against it?      (I am in no way anti American btw)

He used tell me I was the most beautiful woman in the world, now he hardly talks to me at all, and has started wearing men's aftershave to work.      This has all started since I begged him to marry me, as at 54 I don't think I will catch anyone else,   he did tell me I was over the hill.      Has anyone else found a man at aged 54? or am I too late, I just hate sleeping in my double bed on my own.

As in such and such percent if they are a good server such and such percent if they were awesome.

20090130184342AA8o1gN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	For roman catholic priests, fathers, teachers, bishops etc..?	i am looking for answers from the teachers of the catholic faith, not catholics who believe in the faith..im sorry, but i am searching for more than the usual "take it on faith" or the "you dont know god" answers..   first i would like to say that i am in no way intending to judge, pervert, or slander catholicism. i am looking for informed answers from teachers of the faith. the internet has afforded us access to many people with expertise in any given topic and as such, i would like to ask knowledgeable leaders of the church a couple of questions i have run into..   i was born and raised roman catholic. i never questioned what i learned in church until i was 12. i wanted to know god more, so i read the bible..multiple times. in the beginning i read to know the stories..after i read to understand.  i was shocked at how much information was contained and how much more i understood after every read. i found what i believed to be contradictions in what i was being taught in church and the example christ left for us. i wanted to know the history of the church, so as you might have guessed, i researched that too. what i found troubled me. hopefully you can clarify for me some concerns:   -who claimed the catholic apostalic church to be the one way? was this creed not formulated and agreed upon at the council set by constantine? is it not true that christ left no papacy, when even the church itself recognizes the earliest "popes" to be implied?    -how does the church justify the crusades (declaration of war to take back the "holy city")? was it not pope urban II who promised the remission of sins for anyone who helped rid the land of the muslims? is this not a cry to genocide? was not the battlecry "god wills it"? how can we justify the use of gods name to kill? how has the church reconciled with the world or why has it not reconciled with the world for killing in the name of god? What of the inquisition? I have been in old settlements in mex where the torture devices still lay..   -what of our personal relationship with god? why are we taught in our church's to confess our sins to a priest who then in turn, ask of us to repeat the our father or hail mary prayers many times over so we may be forgiven our sins? does this not create a seperation between the people and god? does this not put the church in between? are we not taught by christ that we have a personal relationship with god and that he knows what our heart desires before we ask, so we should not use vain repititions thinking for our many words our prayers will be answered? did christ not say to go into your room and pray in secret that god who is in the secret place will reward us openly? did christ not say that the walls are not the church, but that we are the church and our bodies the temple?    -what of the fact that the church teaches us other faiths will not make it to heaven, but provides no explanation what will happen to them? you may give the "according to their knowledge" answer, but i am speaking of the ones who have, hearing the churches beliefs, decide their beliefs to be more aligned with say buddhism? why are we taught rejecting christian philosophy brings judgement? are we not taught that we should not judge? is this not pride? are not all gods creatures?   -what of hell? the vatican now says this place of hell as fire and brimstone is an ancient idea. what of those who fall short of grace? what of children who die young? if the law must be perfect and just, how can we escape every wrong doing? must we not pay for those sins as well? what of hell? is that perfect justice for non christians? do good people deserve to be delievered to a hell if they do wrong in their life? if we can forgive our children of wrong doings, even serious offenses, how can we believe a merciful and loving god would not do more?       i think this is a good start..

20090130183253AAxwBZk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How the world would end, said so in the Quran?	I read a bit from the Quran, and it said nothing about the world ending at 2012. It said that the world would only end if everyone causes crimes, everyone has illigel sex, everyone marrying same gender, everyone that are being bad to eachother, and lots of war than usual against EVERYONE, and the most important, every single human living, doesn't believen God. No one praying, no one believing. And when no one believes and everyone does bad stuff like this, every single one, will wake up in the morning, and look up to the sky, and see a crack in the sky. A real, looking crack like it's from the ground. And God will punish his people for doing such and not believing. He will end humanity if we do stuff like that. Again, this is from the Quran. I didn't make up that stuff.      What do you think about this? Do you think this might happen? I just want to hear your thinking on this.

20090130185309AAN3lAs	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Shouldn't people just **** off and mind their own business instead of criticizing others?	I've never understood this, I've seen plenty of questions here regarding "self hate" and the only time I've ever seen a "self hater" here is when this one girl who claimed to be "proud biracial" kept posting about how she hates white people with a passion even though she was white herself.      but my point is this, why should it matter to anybody how a person chooses to dress, act, date, or what culture they like more? I mean isn't it hypocritical to complain about people "stereotyping" "generalizing" or "assuming" things about us simply because of our race yet expect people of our race to act a certain way?      Like if I assume that somebody likes rap and only dates black people and uses ebonics simply because that person is black then Im "generalizing" right? but then if that person DOESNT like rap, speaks perfect english, and dates outside of their race then some black people would call them self haters. (trust me I've seen plenty of questions from black people who are tired of being accused for "acting white" because they speak perfect english and because they dont listen to rap). and trust me this also happens to other races as well.      so my question is, is it really anybody's business who a person chooses to date, how they look or act? I mean nobody wakes up one day saying "today I am going to date someone out of my race, and I will choose another culture over my own". people can't control what they like, people dont choose their sexualities, or their types so why should it matter to anyone?
20090130183533AAohR72	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	I'm tired of being call "emo!" Am I?!?	Ok so I'm not the sort of kid to stick up for myself and I've been getting labeled as emo along with dozens of other taunts including fag and stuff. I've been dumped twice in the past three months, had midterms, gone from annoying kid to faggish kid in about a month for some reason and all together have been going through tons of stress lately. I was seriously an insult away from crying during a movie about bullying today.      I started wearing skinny jeans a month ago and from then on went a little farther and farther along in the emo dress. I've always loved sweatshirts and had my hair over my eye since I was 10 or 11. I have orange hair (talk about a turn on!) which I have made comments about dying black because its better than orange and that has rumored into "I wanting to dye my hair black..."      I have always listened to "emo" music and always hated rap. Why is it that people all of a sudden liked rap as soon as they got to middle school??? I don't know but there is another joke about me. My music sucks.      I used to be able to vent on a lot of people but no one likes me up in the new school that has kids from 2 other small towns (100 people in my class all together...a lot for the school) but yeah no one likes me anymore. I never was assertive enough to get into a social group so that means "no one likes me" which is true.       I've been bullied endlessly for about a month lately and have seriously thought of some things I shouldn't have, and have been close to crying very often at night. I have no one to vent out on (that made it sound bad... lol) so I write in my journal. I'll write poems, little tiny quotes and REALLY long rants. My teacher is supposed to make sure I've been writing but she doesn't read them so I get homework done and vent at the same time. Yay! Sooner or latter she might read it, I don't really know what will happen then... bad stuff... I hope it doesn't...      Am I "emo?"       I hate stereotypes, they are shallow and often rude but do I sound "emo" to you???

20090130183918AA82gQm	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do the Protestants believe in the rapture and Christ reigning on earth for 1,000 years?	I have no idea why Protestants believe in this. When it comes to the End Times, the Catholic Church interprets it very simply and it really makes sense on how the Church interprets it.      1. There will be certain signs that will occur before Christ returns His second time.      2. The dead will rise from their graves.      3. The General Judgment will then occur with both the living and the dead being judged before Christ.      4. The elect will go to heaven and enjoy their reward with Christ for eternity.      5. The damned will be sent to hell to be punished for eternity.      6. Purgatory will no longer have a purpose and will cease to exist.      7. The universe will be destroyed and time will cease to exist.      8. The end.

I've had 4 serious relationships...3 with women and one with a guy.... I don't get it I would love to end up with a girl and marry her and have kids but I always get this " I am too uncomfortable with you being bisexual..." and it breaks my heart every time because  it serves as a consequence of my honesty (telling a girl i am bi from the start).

I am a great guy, really smart, extremely athletic, muscular/slim/toned, very masculine, good looking, 6 foot 4 tall.... caring and very honest.

20090130185315AADcZFe	Society & Culture;Etiquette	I need a high school graduation gift for my older brother?	My brother is a senior in high school and is graduating this year. I'm a sophomore and I really want to get him a good gift. I know it's in May, but I wan to start early in case I come up with something that takes more time.    We are really close. Like I'm going to miss him so much! I get really sad and sometimes start crying just thinking about it! He and I are the only rooms upstairs, besides the guests and maids room and I get so sad thinking about how quiet it'll be without him! I also love the rides to school in his car in the morning. So that kind of gives you an idea about how close we are.   And as far as the gift goes...money isn't an object. My family is fortunate enough to be really well off and he has an iphone, a nice laptop, a nice car, college paid for, everything for his dorm will be bought. My parents cover everything, literally. He will have access to their bank account in college and not have to work so that he can focus on his studies. I saw many people suggested giving a new desk lamp, or a phone card, etc, but none of that will be necessary in our situation. I want something thoughtful but not a scrapbook. I also don't want to just do a picture of us. Homemade is fine though, as is a picture of us with some type of meaningful decoration or something. And don't need the idea of sending him cookies or whatever in college, I'm already doing that. all the time! I love to bake, he loves my baking, and I'll miss him so much! So that's not really a gift, just something I love to do anyways.    I hope you get my gist. I'm being so specific hoping that this will help you give me some ideas. Anything helpful!

I love Judaism and am enjoying my recent Hebrew language classes.  Everyday I wear a Jewish symbol around my neck (chai, magen david).  I do not eat pork or fish at all and I don't eat meat with cheese.  I am feeling "stuck" at this point in my life and I would like to become more Jewish (more observant) and more spiritual because right now, I attend temple every Friday night but when difficult times come, I feel I have no solid foundation or belief system to fall back on.  Friends give me the "let go and let god" words of encouragement but I feel that I have been through so much **** in my life, I have a hard time believing that God was with me and watched me and didn't "save me" from it all.  When I'm in temple, I feel Jewish, i say the prayers, I feel united but when I leave I'm back to feeling empty.  Advice?

I believe Jesus Christ is the savior and he died for us and our sins.  I believe and worship God as well.  However, I do not like religion at all.  They state things and go right ahead and do it themselves.  I'm mainly talking about religious people.  I do not want to be grouped/related with these people at all.      Don't get me wrong I am not perfect.  Nobody is.  I realize this.  However, I know many religioius people who get drunk, smoke everyday, premarital sex, treating people like garbage, etc. basically all the time and they call themselves Christians or whatever.      For some reason I have a problem with this and I keep on asking God to help me get over it but I rather just have my time with God alone as I actually try to be a better person and do the best I can.  I have a hard time believing a lot of these religious people even care.

20090130210535AAYTUdY	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Thanks for all your answers on my last question about morals but can we really blame the parents?	I agree  the parenting has alot to do with how a kid are going to believe about right and wrong,  but even if tight controls on the kids watching tv and many other family values.  If you are atleast in your late thirties you would have noticed that outside influences affect how kids are going to turn out,  Most kids when they see something different than the norm will have a tendency to want to try it out.     I believe the next 2 or 3 generations  of the kids being so disrespectful will trigger off new laws and controls for the parents to use.  But mostly your inviroment dictates how you will turn out,  and tell me do you see any place in th usa where kids respect has gotten better instead of worse??  It wont happen unless it is made to happen.  but that is just my thought

20090130210539AAfJ01g	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Are psychics for real?	This is for real,       I have this friend and he can read my mind. One time, while working on computers in class, we wanted to ask for help to the teacher but the teacher (in a very low voice)is talking to another teacher. My friend said 'they're talking about me...' then I said who?, then he said, the teachers, then I said, how did you know? then he told me he's a psychic but I just ignored him. Later that day, on the next class (I'm sitting next to him) he said... 'you're thinking about your crush..' so I was surprised! and he just said 'I told you I'm a psychic..'. I have NOT told anyone about my crush! and I have NEVER even told anybody that I have a crush in the first place! I just met this guy (the 'psychic') for like 7 days ago, and I have just migrated in this country for 2 months ago. I was so surprised!, then I asked him stuff about myself (like when is my bday, # of family members) and they were surprisingly correct!        Can someone give me opinions? Like how the heck is this happening?    also he told me that someone just tells him, he said his father tells him (note: his father died already, couple years ago). I think that father ,he's saying, reads the minds of people near him and tell his son (my friend) what they're thinking.      I can't tell this to my friends, I don't know what will happen to him, or  what they'll do to him and it might spread to our school, also, I don't know what might happen to me,.       So I'm asking for opinions here.      D:

20090130203416AAyR8dD	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, if god lives outside of time and space...?	Then how did he create time?        You cannot "create time".  This is logically absurd because the action of creation is undefined and absurd beyond the dimension of time.  For god to have created the dimension of time, he must have lived before the dimension of time.  But creation is impossible without time.  The very concepts of creation--and indeed action in general--are defined by the dimension of time; in a universe without the dimension of time, there would not be causes, effects, actions, creations or creators; there would only be one, unchanging state of matter.          But an active entity COULD  have existed alongside time for eternity.  This active entity could not have created time if both time and the active entity came into existence simultaneously, or if both were infinite.   Therefore, if god does exist, it must be constrained by a feature of the universe, time, which either precedes god, or came into existence simultaneously with god.        This, of course, means that god is not omnipotent and couldn't have created the Universe.

20090130195845AA54ifY	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people say I can not force God to change my sinful nature to good?	1. He crucified his son for us, gives us a right if you love him to get mad at him and demand all his ways. He seems pretty determined to desire righteousness as much as I do.  2. I am all out of strength and all I have left is attacking and hitting him for his ways to keep me strong with the desire. I try to be as humble as I can, just I am all out. It has not been one or 2 days seeking for me. It has been a long time. It is a want and a need for his ways in my life. It is not something I can not just go and live life happy. I am alone in my faith as in all are walking in sin.  It is my 1st and only thing I desire. So if it is all that I am, and all that I seek for. I am aggressive with my needs and wants.     what is evil about me? If he can sacrifice his son, I can be aggressive unto him for his ways and righteousness.     It would be like a man that is poor and needs money. And I am a man that is giving you 100000000 dollars and demands you to take it and you do not owe me back, and NO catches. I just want to give you money. What do you think the poor person will say?

What you partook of in the Word of God today that was a spiritual supply to you?   Be it a verse, a thought or something that you received from another that was a source of strength for you to go on in the Lord?      I enjoyed a portion in Revelation 14:4 which says that we are those who follow the Lamb wherever He may go.  That if we desire to grow in the Lord, we need to be those following Him.  IF we are not following Him, then we are not growing and progressing in the christian life.  How we need to tell the Lord Jesus each day, " LOrd I would like to be one following You in this age of Grace. Wherever You are, I want to be, Wherever You are moving, I want to move with you as a part of Your Body on the earth. I consecrate this day and my life to You Lord Jesus.. I love You so much"      This encouraged my heart today.      So what did you partake of in the word of God that you can dispense to me and the other saints here on the forum.

20090130201456AAyxyJ3	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Religious Question - Do All Humans Sin?	okay I got into a debate with someone  about whether our not all humans sin or is it a choose to sin. My real question is, I know that everyone has sinned, but is it our choose to sin or is it inevitable that we will sin sometime in our lifetime.   I mean Eve did condemn all her children to sin after she ate the apple right?      I am not saying that everyone is a murderer or thief, but if someone choose not to commit any sin at all, could they actually do it, or will everyone human being sin.      by the way I my religion is Christianity

20090130194728AABN1jA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If the Bible is open to interpretation, is it really the "word of God" that is being practiced?	People have different opinions about what parts of the Bible are allegory, which are literal, which should be followed and which should not be. I imagine that there are very few people out there who all follow the exact same interpretation of the Bible.      My question is, if you're going to follow your own path, deviate from the one laid out in the Bible, why even follow the Bible at all? Why can't you eliminate the crutch and announce your own moral code, independently?       We can all go on about the irrationality of the idea of a god, but what I really want to know right now is why you all aren't independently religious, if you must be religious at all. If you don't have a problem with the fact that there are so many different versions of what is right, why worry about admitting what you're already doing - creating your own version of morality? I think it might be liberating for you.

So if you mean nothing and were created from nothing, what are you?   nothing???   We are made for a different purpose.. why were we made so superior over all other animal kingdoms?   And for all the evolutionists out there..   How is it that humans are the only superior species, and animals have not had the ability to reach the point at which we have become..?   Surely if evolution was true, there would be other species as advanced as ourselves..

20090130203542AAhiInE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What are some similarities between Lao Tzu and Buddha?	Well I was in my Karate class and one of the posters on the wall read that "A man who conquers powerfully is mighty but a man who conquers himself is mightier still" (Well some thing along those lines). The quote was by Lao Tzu. This same almost exact thing is said by the Buddha in the Dhammapada I believe. Some Taoists also believe that Buddha is the incarnation of Lao Tzu or that Lao Tzu was the Buddha's teacher (I don't know how).       So that got me thinking what are some similarities between the two?    Quotes, Their Lives, Attainments, and their main topics of emphasizing would be appreciated. ( Yes I know I can research it and I have, but I always like hearing from other people)       Thanks

20090130194658AAOpG2t	Society & Culture;Holidays;Christmas	Cruddy gifts this year?	I'm a 41 year old, plus sized woman and my Mom gave me a $100 gift certificate to Victoria's Secret. Underwear has always been a big thing to my Mom, but I'm the kind of person that if I need it, I'll buy it, it's not a "splurge" or a "luxury". Plus, I feared and was put into the situation of being a fat, older woman shopping in a store designed for skinny 20-somethings (most girls get the certificates from their boyfriends). They don't carry my size, so I determined that I'd buy perfumes. I found the least disliked perfumes, but they were all sickeningly sweet and pretty much smelled alike, and when I got them home, I hated them all.

I'm getting there, but it's honestly just a pain and I want to speed up the process. I was planning on thoroughly cleaning everything (vacuuming, etc). But I was wondering if that's even necessary. I paid a cleaning deposit when I moved in; I'm pretty sure I'm not going to get that back anyway.. (I've been here for a year and a half, it's going to look more used than when I first got it). It would be great if I could get it partially back, but at this point I've just gotten used to living without that money. Now I guess I'm just really curious as to what other residents do when they move. Do you make it spotless? Do you leave stuff in the building that you don't want anymore, knowing that management will take care of it? How clean do you generally leave the place?      And any landlords on here, what do you typically see/expect when a resident moves out?      Thanks!

I was in a town a few years ago that speaks a lot more spanish than my hometown and I got confused about what you call the Bathroom . In my hometown ( Alamogordo) the restrooms are labled Bannos . My friend told me that if you go to Jaurez or Mexico City they find it offensive if you use bannos to describe the place you do your business in . What is the correct word in Jaurez?
