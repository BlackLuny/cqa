0592f95932446b6d9b332e719d207639aa	It is often hard to find a good tutor for math and physics, because you want someone who not only is "good" at the subjects, but someone who can communicate clearly and knows how to teach the subject.    The school can be a good source of tutors, as can a nearby university. If neither of those has a candidate for you, then you can consider posting a classified on Craig's List (it will cost $25 for a job ad, it is free to post it to the community section) or on another posting board.    Many tutors are referred word of mouth and do not advertise. I would suggest asking friends and colleagues who have kids if they know of any tutors. Also, if you find a good English tutor, ask if he or she knows any good math/science tutors, often people talk to each other in tutor circles, and you may be able to get a referral that way.    You can also do a search for "math tutor" and "physics tutor" in a search engine which will return tutoring companies in your area. Make sure you ask about references, experience, and that you are able to talk to the tutor to make sure he/she is a good fit before paying for a service.|`|tVkH44yuaa	i don't know any, but have you asked your teacher(s) for help?|`|4gZCqI9haa	there is this place called SCORE! Educational center it helps me with my math reading science and much more. you can get yourself an account by finding your nearest SCORE! Or you can have private lessons where it is just you and the teacher working on problems.   if you have any questions go to escore.com
9Oa1kv7Zaa	No, its actually about 200 words.  And I am very glad you are doing it now because I regret not studying earlier. And I recommend you take the SAT on your freshmen year. So you can be prepared.    But If you give me your email address, I can email you the list of words on monday because my school has the list of words you need.

zCOvQwQhaa	The easiest major is always the one someone else is doing.  The hardest is always the one you're doing.  Reality is that they're all about the same depending upon your abilities.    Imagine trying to get a degree in trumpet performance if you can't play trumpet, or in studio art if you can't draw, or in math/stats/engineering if you do poorly in math.  It's all about what you're good at and interested in.      Most people will agree that the physical sciences, engineering, and math are pretty difficult majors.  Medicine can be pretty demanding too.  We might borrow from the expression "it's not rocket science" to conclude that this area of physics is pretty complicated.  But then, if physics comes naturally to you - it's not so hard.    I like to say that the hardest degree to get is the first one - after that they're all much easier.  ?|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	It really depends on the person.  A PhD is the highest-level degree, but some people might find a MD more challenging.  Personally I'd vote for a PhD in physics being the hardest degree to get, but I might be a bit biased since I spent the last few years working on one.|`|S7HMWOzwaa	Well, what may be hard for you may be easy for someone else. Going by average GPA then Engineering/Mathematics/Physics would be the hardest.|`|g2lQxz75aa	a phd ..because it takes longer and you also have to write and publish a book inorder to get the diploma

pgFD4n1Caa	Sadly, mean teachers probably didn't start out that way. They probably at one point were excited about teaching, excited about working with kids. Through the years though they probably dealt with unsupportive crazy parents, disrespectful kids with terrible behavior problems, lazy co-workers and the rest of the politics that comes with teaching all of which contributes to the burn out and produces mean teachers.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	They're bullies!  Don't let them get away with it!  In my experience junior high and high school teachers have been perverts. Spread a nasty rumor about them.|`|xgWf3SKxaa	1.) schools hire teachers base on their years of college  2.) they are allowed to be mean because they are in a higher postition then they students, some teachers think they need to be mean in order to gain respect  3.) teachers teach to make a living! some people are just mean and they happen to be teachers lol this doesnt mean they are all mean !|`|vwoqIUR6aa	some teachers are honestly out to get some kids. I had a high school teacher give me bad marks because my brother who was a year older and was a trouble maker. so he treated me the same way as my brother. another problem is when you don't tell your parents what is going on, nothing happens to them.|`|3apyZmOBaa	1. Principles who run schools are mean too.  2. They prefer the term "strict".  3. They live with cats and have no love. They just don't care.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	1.  They don't know the teachers are going to be mean.  2.  Depends on what you mean by "mean". You can't hit someone or call them names but some people might considering telling a kid to be quiet mean and sometimes a teacher will have to do that for the good of the other students.  3. All teachers loved students when the started teaching. ALL of them, every last one of them. The thing is though that in each class there is at least one, usually two students who will work your last nerve. They'll push every button you have just because it amuses them. After a few years of that even the nicest person begins to hate students.|`|xHcQSLiVaa	1. Schools do not hire mean teachers, students usually create mean teachers    2. yes, sometimes it is needed    3. Most teachers teach because they are trying to help kids.  what you consider mean, may simply be bitterness because this person goes out of their way to help children who probably do not show much respect or appreciation.  Be honest, how often do you guys get to know this teacher or simply ask them how their day is going.  You usually get what you give.|`|V90Ao2jfaa	3. they need the money.|`|yfwSDroNaa	they do that to give students hell!|`|ZJ03V8gBaa	1. They hire teachers from interviews. They don't know that they are mean when they hire them, I don't think.  2. Yes. That's why they do it all the time. That's their personality, and they are the head of the class and the "elder". Once a teacher is hired, because of the union, it is very hard to fire them.   3. Sometimes it's the only job they can think of doing. A lot of teachers teach for a while, expecting one thing and not getting it, which sours them. Especially older teachers. Sometimes, after kids have brutalized them for so many years, and don't appreciate them, they just get cold and hard and don't love what they do anymore and react to being fustrated about their job.|`|T4tM4NWKaa	idk but i dont think they r mean to the other teacherrs just the students. they shouldnt be mean but they can do what ever they want. i dont know y they would teach if they dont like students. half the time they dont even like kids.|`|nAN7lb6Gaa	1) Schools hire mean teachers, because they are easier to bend by the higher authorities.  2) They are trained to be mean.  3) My teachers never taught me anything.

They want us to suffer and be miserable.  2. Is a teacher even allowed to be mean? Oh yeah sure as long as they don't get violent.  3. Why do teachers even teach if they are going to be mean and not like students? They used to have hopes and dreams in college but then they grew up and the weight of the world crushed their soul and now they are cranky old men and women  who teach hyperactive kids all day and enjoy yelling.    :[ mean teachers suck but I've noticed bus drivers and substitutes are usually worse, and there are actually some generally nice wonderful teachers out there just not that many|`|JIy11vWcaa	1. They probably don't act mean when they are interviewed.    2. Principals probably think that mean teachers will keep the kids in line.     3. because they need the money and they want to make children's lives a living hell (just like all the teachers at my school)    i don't know why the hell teachers are supposed to be as mean as they are. they act all nice when you're interviewed and when you're with your parents, but at school they're monsters!! i hate teachers like that, but most of the teachers at my school are like that!!|`|qMhLcn8Gaa	1) Schools hire TEACHERS, they're there to TEACH, not be friendly  2) Going by the global standard of Meaness set by the ISO organization in the late 90's...   3) Teachers aren't mean unless they're given a reason, if you don't see the reason, you probably ARE the reason.|`|BvA2NmiGaa	1.  schools do not know the teachers are "mean" when they hire them.  2.  define "mean".  harrasment ?  no .  giving you a bad grade ?  well, did you deserve it ?  3.  a lot of people get into teaching because they just like to be bossy; like they're on a power trip or something ...  they aren't there because they want to be around kids, just control them .  :p
ry3yUnoaaa	It sounds like they are about to have a rush pretty soon. I know the AKA's at my school are going to have one this semester as well. Did the conversion go well between you all on the phone? If so, then start getting prepared for the rush!! You are probably one of the people that they are interested in picking.  Good Luck!!|`|14pjwQPLaa	That's a pretty underhanded way to get information, if you ask me.  I can't imagine a sorority that would do that. At most schools, you fill out a rush application/registration that has your GPA, etc. on it, so they don't have to resort to secret phone calls, etc.  Asking you about how you liked the service projects, etc.,are perfectly open, valid questions to ask you if you visit their house during rush.     I hope this wasn't someone's idea of a stupid joke -- if so, it was really cruel.  And if this is the way they do rush -- it's pretty pathetic.|`|XYuywYH9aa	Why can't you get involved in service on your own?

You will have more freedoms, so you have to keep your head. You sort of get to start over and will be meeting new people and exposed to new experiences. It is important to understand the importance of finding people you can trust and being who you really are. Get involved early in some clubs or band, theatre, whatever your interests are, that'll help you meet some kids with similar interests. That really makes a difference!

But, from pressure and not breathing correctly, you may appear to have reddening of the eyes, from lack of oxygen to the brain.

NirBfNfMaa	Here's what you do:    Go to the counseling office at your community college and ask for the CSU-GE Breadth requirement list. It should have the requirements A through G. For example, section A might be English. It will say "Choose one course from each" for each heading under English (I chose Freshman Composition, Intro to Literature, and Communication).  This will be the pattern for the rest of the list.    You don't need to do the American Institutions requirement before you transfer.    NOW what is your major? When you know, go to www.assist.org. You can find the agreement between SDSU and your community college. For example, I found the one for Economics. It said "SDSU course Econ 101" and then "equivalent course at community college Econ 120." These courses are your pre-major, and you MUST do this as well as the GE.    You must have at least 60 transferable units to transfer, no less. If you choose your courses from the lists I told you about, those WILL transfer.    The good thing is, that MANY of your major prep courses will count as GE too. My two economics courses and my statistics course and business calculus all counted towards GE requirements.    SEE A COUNSELOR! My counselor was awesome, but some kids I knew who went to other community colleges got bad advice from their counselors, so always double-check what they tell you.    Your CSU-GE transfer agreement will have, for example Economics listed as your major (or whatever you choose) BUT your community college major will be University Transfer Studies.    OF GREAT IMPORTANCE: Check obsessively for deadlines. Be very on top of this. Usually you apply the fall before the fall semester you want to apply for. For example, I had to apply in October (Oct 1st to Nov. 30th, but those dates may have changed)    THEN, once you have submitted your application onlne via CSU Mentor, you send them a check for the application fee (or use credit card). Again, look for deadlines. In January you will be required to do a supplemental application to update your grades and to list courses you are enrolled in for Spring. Then you will get your acceptance letter (if you meet the requirements). Then you will have a June deadline (look for the deadline) to send in final transcripts.    I know this sounds daunting, but take it one step at a time.    1) follow CSU-GE requirements from the sheet  2) follow the major prep requirements from www.assist.org  3) sign a CSU-GE breadth transfer agreement (if they still do it)  4) Apply about a year before you want to attend (check the deadlines)  5)Do the supplemental application (this will be on your SDSU webportal. You should be given a Red ID after you apply)  6) Send in Final transcripts by some date in June (check the deadline)    7) GO TO TRANSFER ORIENTATION!!! You will be assigned a better registration date for classes    8) Take the WPA (writing proficiency assessment) right after you are accepted or the semester immediately following that (but no later).      Make very good friends with www.assist.org and CSU Mentor (www.csumentor.org). You will apply online at CSU Mentor.    ALSO: Get higher than the minimum GPA to transfer. Because of budget cuts, transfer admissions are getting more selective The higher your GPA, the better.    ALSO: You can transfer without getting the associates degree in University Transfer Studies, however I am glad I did. On my resume, if I wrote 2004 - 2008 SDSU, it would be lying, because 2004 - 2006 would have been at the community college. Because I have an AA, I can list a degree under my university and it will explain the 2 years. If you just transfer, I don't know what you put. "Two years completed towards a Bachelor's degree" or something but I am glad to list that I finished the AA instead. It's just easier, and all you do is apply for graduation at the community college, nothing extra.    Good luck! Feel free to contact me with any questions.|`|BDQNvrHaaa	i think it's better to get answers from the university's counsellor. so he/she can tell you what credits are mandatory to get.|`|yvdbDRfcaa	You are going to need your transcripts from both high school and the college you are currently at.  Getting those should not be difficult.    However you should really get your AA degree first.  Once you have an AA degree, applying to a 4 year university is far easier, and most schools will automatically accept you, depending on your state's program.
5Xh7y0waaa	Last year I was in year 10 and I completed (Units 1 & 2) Year 11 Studio Arts a year early.    To taking on that one VCE subject a year early - yes, there is an advantage. It means that this year I will finish Year 12 Studio Arts a year early making it so that next year, when I am in year 12, I will have one subject already out of the way. This means either a few more points for the extra subject or less subjects to complete in year 12 (because one is already out of the way) meaning that I will have more time and effort to contribute to my other subjects.    So to taking on just one or two VCE subjects a year early in Year 10, lots of people do it, and I would highly recommend it.    But if your question is referring to doing the whole of Year 11 in Year 10, then I don't really see much of an advantage. Getting out of school a year early, I guess. There are a few really really smart kids and some autistic kids who I know of who are taking doing 11 early, but unless you are a genius like them ... and I really wouldn't want to do the entirety of VCE a year early anyway.

AA10176626	Altaira is exactly correct.    All schools in a state university system receive a major portion of their funding from the state budget. In other words, the taxpayers of each state provide a good chunk of the money that is used to operate the state universities.    As a "reward" for  supporting the schools in your state, your state government will heavily subsidize the cost of your education - that means they'll charge you far, far less than it really costs them to give you an education.    If you are not a state resident, you (and your household) have not supported the state university system with your tax dollars, and therefore, you must pay the full cost of your education.     So - in-state students pay far less because their state government is subsidizing the cost of their education. Out-of-state students pay more, because they are required to pay the full cost of their education.    You and your parents have already paid part of the cost of your college education at a state school - I'd highly encourage you not to throw that money away, and take advantage of it.    I hope that helped you better understand the situation! Good luck.|`|SIhxrxD3aa	Because in-state students (or their parents rather) have already put money into that school by paying taxes in that state.|`|kOsJ63KFaa	If you are an illegal immigrant you don't have to pay more.

lQIKWXDuaa	My best advise to you is this. Visit NYU and Julliard school of music in NY or any other top music school in NYC that you think off. Talk to their admission committee. They will probably want you yo audition for them afterward. They can also give you some pointers on how to get admitted. Also look for opportunities in NY for student with interest in music. I hope this help you. When it comes to music its all about talent. Good Luck!!!     ss
IGSVfbGuaa	Your SAT scores seem a bit lacking first of all. Your GPA is solid though, but isn't a weighted GPA out of 5? If so, your weighted GPA is rather lacking.  All those clubs and activities will go against you, the ones you didn't progress to a leadership role in. Why? COlleges will say it looks like you were "stacking you resume", or just joining a bunch of clubs to put on your college application.  YES! Your background will help you, colleges love having a diverse student population from different states, countries, and ethnicities.  You DO have some leadership roles, and some honors, so that is good. You also have intern and work experience which is great.    I cannot say if you will get in or not, but you are an above average applicant (from what I can tell). Apply, and hope for the best, just remember people have applied to colleges, with 5.0 GPAs with all AP classes and have been rejected.|`|VsBmo0MEaa	i say a VERY good chance
AA11059368	For 1, the parallel lines have the same slope, so your answer is a and d - both slopes are -9.    For 2, you have a pair of points, so you can set up an equation easily enough with the slope formula.  You have the slope of a perpendicular line, so the slope of the actual line is the opposite inverse of the given slope:    m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)  -2/3 = (-4 - y) / (2 - (-4))  -2/3 = (-4 - y) / 6  -4 = -4 - y  y = 0    For 3,    x - 3y = 9  3y = x - 9  y = x/3 - 3    For 4, you have a pair of numbers x and y.  Set up according to the given information:    x - y = 49  y = 5x - 3    x - (5x - 3) = 49  -4x + 3 = 49  -4x = 46  x = -11.5    y = 5(-11.5) - 3  y = -60.5    Similarly for 5:    x - 4y = -17  -4x - 3y = 11    x = 4y - 17  -4(4y - 17) - 3y = 11  -16y + 68 - 3y = 11  -19y = -57  y = 3    x = 4(3) - 17  x = 12 - 17  x = -5    6 is similar to 3:    -5x + 8y = -24  5x = 8y + 24  x = 8y/5 + 24/5

cyeLtucvaa	hey I have done my coursework and pretty much got a good high grade...You should include the forseshadowing of Eddies downfall and how Miller craftly uses staging to convey the crisis in the drama.Use...  P - oint  E - vidence  E - xplanation  A - nalysis    something like when Eddie concedes to let Catherine work. The stage directions indicate that he relents with "a sense of her childhood, her babyhood and the years". Miller also uses his stage directions as a means of making clear to the production company his intended symbolism.This could be seen symbolically as a projection of Eddie's self-destructive tendencies, as his sense of self-worth and his honourable character finally reach the bottom of their downward spiral.  Near the end Eddie is killed and he tell's the police about Rodolfo. Try and get a plot summary from wikipedia or something or just read the play!|`|GQpTI2GWaa	Which scene?|`|XJXsFn9paa	1.

XJXsFn9paa	That depends on where you are, and whether the degrees are being offered by different universities or the same one.    "In Britain the equivalent degree is the Bachelor of Arts, while in Australia the Bachelor Fine Arts is awarded to students completing a degree in visual arts, not performing arts. Specific degrees such as the Bachelor of Dance or Bachelor of Drama are used in the performing arts in Australia and much of Europe.    In the US, the degree differs from a Bachelor of Arts degree in that the majority of the program consists of a practical studio component, as contrasted with lecture and discussion classes. A typical US BFA program consists of two-thirds study in the arts, with one-third in more general liberal arts studies; for a BA in Art, the ratio might be reversed."|`|UxooffHZaa	If it's at 2 different colleges, probably nothing. If the same college offers both degrees, likely the BFA is for artists, and BA is for Art Historians.
kbRIeIg4aa	I am a Junior and this class is offered at my High School. I plan to take it next year as a Senior because I could not fit it into my schedule this year, however I do have some Junior friends who are currently taking it. They say it is extremely challenging. I watch them read and re-read through each chapter during lunch and in between classes, they take more notes than I have ever seen in my life and they take them on their own.. usually AP teachers will not give them to you. These friends are honors students and carry high grades, they do well in AP Euro but I know it is extremely hard for them to earn that A. Basically you are looking at 1-2hrs of homeowrk each night including weekends. Expect your tests and quizzesto be modeled after questions and essays pulled from the actual AP college placement test. If you are not an honor student or you cannot commit yourself to puting school first at times... i recommend you never take an AP class. They are more than "challenging"...however they do look great to colleges :). I've been taking advanced classes all through high school but my one AP class ( AP Art History ) gives me more homework and studying than any other class I have taken. I would never recommend this work load for a sophmore. A Junior? yes, but only if you are a self-disciplined and higly self-motivated student.|`|CmNTc1aSaa	It wouldn't be too hard if you're already an honors student.  I would rather take it junior year, though, but colleges also like to see you take rigorous courses throughout high school.  It's basically a lot of memorization and knowing the progression of history and tying it all together.  It's actually really fascinating, if you have an interest in the course material.  I would take it junior year, though.|`|yGYLbifDaa	I am currently taking AP American History, and my teacher told me (who teaches Euro) says that it is considerably easier than AP Amer.

WXExyAlWaa	Unfortunately this is a subject that is very, very difficult to get accurate information on, especially if you are using the internet. It depends though whether you're researching Wicca, which has only been around for a hundred years or so, or the much, much older pagan religions that it's based on. If Wicca, you could try using Gardner or Gardnerian as keywords in your searches, and look for websites that list sources or look as though they're more scholarly, rather than personal websites of Wiccans. You could _try_ wikipedia as a starting point (ignore the article, just go to the sources and external links) as well.|`|aa596673c4a4b7827a51695b15eb9ae8aa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicca|`|yAvTxh47aa	http://wicca.timerift.net is very accurate.

IvWpD3glaa	If you enjoyed helping your friends then I would say yes.  Just know that you will have to take mostly math course when you are in college.  You will also have to take a couple of core education courses.  Before you graduate you will probably be required to complete at least one semester of student teaching.  Some schools also require you to put in certain amount of hours in a classroom observing.  Once you get your Bachelors degree, in most states, you will be required to take and pass the state certification exams.  Most people become teachers because they have a talent similar to yours and they know that they will not be getting paid like other professions.  Being a good teacher is a hard and most times thankless job.  The rewards you will get will not be monetary, they will be the satisfaction of knowing that you actually made a difference and helped someone learn something new.

If it's literature, I think I can help you.<br>  <br>  Victorian poetry is especially generous about death, and I think you can use /anything/ written by Edgar Allan Poe. Just type his name in Google and you have all you need for your project.<br>  <br>  Another advice is "Do not go gentle into that good night" by Dylan Thomas, which is written to his dying father as a motivation to fight against death. You can find it here:<br>  <a href="http://www.bigeye.com/donotgo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigeye.com/donotgo.htm</a><br>  <br>  Or, you can stick with the eternal cliche and use Hamlet, I don't think anyone will object to that as a project subject, schoolteachers seem to have a special interest in William.<br>  <br>  If you want to do something original, I recommend you take it a little further and write about /not/ dying. Afterlife has always been a fascination for me, and quite an interesting subject to work with. Do a little research on this in different cultures and beliefs, and you will be astounded by what you'll find. Greek mythology alone is a world within itself.<br>  <br>  As for Medieval Europe, that is probably the ideal time period you should look if you want to see death at work. And the art is enough to give you the chills.<br>  <br>  Hope I was helpful...|`|oatIv4cpaa	Kubler-Ross, Elisabeth has written may book on death and dying.<br>  Any of her books should be a source for any research paper on the topic.<br>  <br>  Kübler-Ross, Elisabeth: (1926-2004) Swiss-born American psychiatrist whose work with and teching about terminally ill patients helped alter attitudes toward death and the care of the dying. She opposed the taboo against openly discussing and studying death and was a force in the US for the creation of hospices where palliative care and support are provided to the dying. <br>  <br>  Dr. Kübler-Ross exerted influence in person and through her writings, especially her book On Death and Dying that first appeared in 1969. Before that time, the terminally ill were often left to face death alone. Kübler-Ross helped make thanatology (the study of the physical, psychological and social problems associated with dying) into an accepted medical discipline. The study of dying became part of medical and health care education in US, often with Death and Dying as the textbook. <br>  <br>  From interviews with the dying, Dr. Kübler-Ross identified five stages that many people go through -- denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Not all dying patients follow the same progression, but most experience two or more of the five stages: <br>  <br>  Denial -- Often denial is the first stage. "I can't be dying. Not me." <br>  Anger -- As the disease worsens and denial becomes less possible, there may be anger. "Why me?" <br>  Bargaining -- "If I do such and such, can I put off death for a while?" <br>  Depression -- When the bargaining doesn't work, depression may set in. <br>  Acceptance -- "I accept my fate and am ready to die."<br>  The stages may not progress in this order. The person who is dying, and those who love them, may go back and forth among some or all of these and other emotions.

One day back in 1964 he came up with an idea to move his out-of- season merchandise. He would need a light that would draw attention. So he talked to his policeman buddy about getting a police warning light. Together they built the blue light contraption. They mounted the light on a pole which could be wheeled around to any department in the store. Grandpa then added a sense of urgency by announcing over the PA system that a special price or offer would be good in that area for just the next fifteen minutes. The “Blue Light Special” gave a new excitement to shopping and became very popular with the customers. One year later, a store manager at K-Mart “borrowed” the idea. And now you know the rest of the story|`|EcCxgD3kaa	There is a Tall Blue light that they would place next to a temporary markdown in the store.

a6854bd17855581f0e5d0e638403c4b4aa	Controversy between the North and South raged for years over administration and enactment of tariff laws. A new wrinkle was added when the North began to openly defy fugitive slave laws. Northern states refused to honor warrants for capture and return of slaves to the South. The North's attitude was in direct defiance of federal law and of the Constitution which clearly mandates that each state of the Union must recognize Constitutional laws of all other states. Additionally, the federal government refused to intervene on behalf of the South. During the elections of 1860 Abraham Lincoln made it clear that he would not enforce fugitive slave laws and that he supported existing tariff laws and administration.<br>  <br>  A present day analogy would be if those states which do not have the death penalty refused to enforce fugitive warrants for murderers because the states issuing the warrants have the death penalty. If the non-death penalty states refused to honor such warrants in defiance of the U.S. Supreme Court, AND the federal government sided with the defiant states, we would have a Constitutional crisis similar to the one which existed in 1861. Would the question then be over the death penalty, or would the question be over obeying the Constitution and the laws of the land?<br>  <br>  The beginning of the Civil War was inevitable when in December, 1860 and January, 1861 six Southern states, led by South Carolina, seceded from the Union. On March 2, 1861 Texas joined them. The argument was over states rights. Specifically, whether the federal government had powers to interfere with the right to own and trade property including slaves. Great compromises had been reached in the drafting of the Constitution. Article I, Section 2, recognized that slavery existed and provided for a fractional head count of slaves as the basis for determining representation in congress. Article I, Section 9, gave congress the power to enact laws restricting or forbidding importation of slaves after 1808 but the Constitution did not give congress power to interfere with ownership of slaves in those states which allowed ownership when the Constitution was adopted.<br>  <br>  The Constitution did, however, give congress powers to make laws in territories of the United States, notwithstanding the Supreme Court's decision in Dred Scott, and to admit new states to the Union. Congress, especially the Republicans, had become pro-active in abolishing slavery in territories and failing to admit states which were not free states. The South viewed the territories as economic opportunities for the sale of slaves and other "property" and saw the Federal activity as an encroachment into their rights. <br>  <br>  There is absolutely nothing in the Constitution or any other legal document which precludes any state or group of states from seceding from the United States. This was also true in 1861. Today, countries are split and otherwise reconfigured almost daily and the United States has evolved as the world's moral leader in supporting rights of peoples to declare themselves independent. This is a comfortable position for politicians to take... as long as it takes place somewhere else. Suppose New Mexico decided to secede? We know well what the response of national politicians AND the people of the remaining states would be.<br>  <br>  The one constant since 1861 is that secession was not and will not be tolerated. Politicians will reach deep into their grab-bag of excuses (national security, minority rights, etc.,) and go to war if necessary to stop it. But when it happens in Yugoslavia, watch the American politicians change their tune.<br>  <br>  By the way, you have a brilliant teacher/professor. He's making you see the subject in depth and this portion of history is rarely touched beyond the surface rhetoric.|`|7711f7d5555bb124fe71b36b473974b7aa	The previous post is very good... you may also want to add that the Emancipation Proclamation did not free a single slave since it only applied to the states that seceded (which Lincoln had no control over, and that type of change could not be made by the president without the judicial and legislative branch - hence the constitutional ammendment). As an interesting side note, there were still states in the union with slaves during the civil war. It was more about the tarrifs on sugar and cotton than anything else.

obmWf0pJaa	alright, many questions and i will try to take them one at a time...    first, online courses will help your gpa, but the appropriate person to ask about that one is your school's counselor. they are paid to answer such questions. if you do not have one of those, call your chosen university and ask them. i have attached the links to each of the three schools. give them a call after you write out your questions. they would love to hear from you.    second, summer school always helps, but may not be necessary. it really depends on the classes you are able to take and if you need those classes. once again, the school counselor is where to go.     now to your application standing out. remember that when admitting students for incoming freshman classes, colleges only want to judge how successful you will be. the only thing they have to judge your future success on is what you have done up to the point of application. gpa is a big aspect, and it looks like your willingness to maintain a high gpa will keep you in consideration for all three schools. take a look at the courses that you will take next year and make sure that they will prepare you for that first year of college. calculus, chemistry, physics, history, government, etc. the courses that you take now for credit in high school will help you to adjust in college. your extracurriculars are great, and keep up with them. don't just be a part, be a big part.     your chances of getting into seattle u and udub are going to be excellent if you keep the numbers and efforts in your question. nyu will be a bit harder, but put that application together and try, because you have to have a few tough colleges in your application pool. the great thing is that no matter which of the three, you will have a great opportunity to learn and grow with any of them.     also, while building your resume and application is important, don't do things simply because it will look good on your application. this is a major problem with people in every walk of life, and it is a tough habit to break once you start practicing it. do things that you enjoy, and do them well. throw your heart into what you like doing and take every opportunity to learn and grow. but don't become only a resume builder. do the things you love and your resume will build itself.

Use study halls, and if you are in sports, the travel/down time to work in school work and decide which "activities" aren't top priority.  All work and no play will make Jack/Jill a dull boy/girl, but you also need to make sure to keep the balance.  Once you learn how to budget your time, you will see your stress level drop.  If you are having trouble with your studies, don't be afraid to ask for help from peers, teachers and parents!

af2145487047aa2ee8cf7d14b8391f9aaa	I'm 45 minutes away (w/o traffic) and I love it. I'm far enough away that I'm completely independent (well, except financially of course) but close enough that I can go home once a month or so when I'm missing a home cooked meal or just need to get away from school and everything. But really only you can answer this question. I seriously considered going to school about 7 hours (driving) away and I now know that I would have HATED it. My family is very close and I think everyone would have been miserable. Because I'm close-ish I can easily go home for birthdays, holidays, and money. However, I know people who went to school across the country and couldn't be happier. It just depends on YOU.|`|39b49b413d035cf3c2b4c6032e71b53daa	It truely depends on whether you can find a school that offers a program that you are interested in, within that hour of home.  If there are multiple colleges staying within an hour can be helpful.  Other people like to TOTALLY emerse themselves in the experience so they go farther from home and only come back for holidays.  It also depends on your personality, and whether or not you know your roommate or any one else at the school.  This is where the true helps comes from in making the transition.  Program choice should come first, then staying within a 3 hour window in my opnion is a good idea.|`|5c07eea93e2b7eb3dfa4e16ee3a3c43eaa	That really depends on you.  How adventurous are you, do you get homesick?  I went to school about 1.5 hours away from home, and then my parents moved 1000 miles away during my freshman year.  I liked being close to my old home even after they left because it was easy to reconnect with all of my old friends.  Having to travel a long way to see the folks kind of sucks, but it certainly helps you establish your own life.|`|AA10145299	It depends on if you cant live w/o your family close by, if you like to experience things on your own and away from family and if you are responsibile enough to do what you went to school to do in the first place...learn (with all the distractions of a full and complete social life) I went away, but my family followed. I still had the best 4 years of my life. So ask yourself are you ready to become an adult?|`|AA12308863	I think this really depends on how close you are to your home. Personally, I wish I had stayed a little bit closer. I'm 3 1/2 to 4 hours away and I hate the ride home, but I wish I could go home more often. Just realize that the further you go away, the less likely you are going to able to go home often. If you get involved and stay busy, this might not be a problem. It just might affect you more when you see all of your newly made friends going home for the weekend or during the week and are able to not miss class and you have to stay there because the ride is too long. I think that around about 2 hours away isn't that bad. I have friends that go about 1 1/2 hours away and they come home sometimes almost every weekend. But I also have friends that live 4 and 5 hours and go home often. It just depends on what you’re willing to do. If you think you won't get homesick, and then by all means, go anywhere you want to go. Just whatever you decide, decide on what you think will make you the happiest, because if you’re not happy in college, it will be miserable.|`|AA11039109	For some commonsense straight answers, click on this link and scroll down to "Misperception: Staying close to home..."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ctcl.com/why/myths.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ctcl.com/why/myths.htm</a>

If you understand the structure of the language you are speaking, then it will be easier for you to learn other languages you are interested in as well.  As for improving your writing abilities, good writing skills will always be needed in school for more subjects than you think and especially literature.  The question of whether or not you will ever use a subject you think is wasting your time because the job you THINK you want has nothing to do with that subject is irrelevant.

8fe060f66536441f8494e7f73335553baa	An anagram (Greek ana- = "back" or "again", and graphein = "to write") is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce other words, using all the original letters exactly once. Someone who creates anagrams is called an anagrammist.<br>  <br>  Anagrams are often expressed in the form of an equation, with the equals symbol (=) separating the original subject and the resulting anagram. ‘Earth = heart’ is an example of a simple anagram expressed in that way. In a more advanced, sophisticated form of anagramming, the aim is to ‘discover’ a result that has a linguistic meaning that defines or comments on the original subject in a humorous or ironic way; e.g., Roll in the hay = Thrill a honey, Desperation = a rope ends it, Mother-in-law = woman Hitler, or Slotmachines = Cash lost in em. When the subject and the resulting anagram form a complete sentence, a tilde (~) is commonly used instead of an equal sign; e.g., Semolina ~ is no meal. or Somewhere Over the Rainbow ~ Worrisome However Beneath.<br>  <br>  Here are many examples I found by some anagrammy.com winners.<br>  <br>  Female persons =<br>  Pleasers of men. <br>  <br>  Unsolicited commercial emails =<br>  Mad, malicious, electronic slime. <br>  <br>  Unsolicited commercial emails =<br>  Mad, malicious, electronic slime. <br>  <br>  The first lesson on guitar = <br>  It hurts one's fingers a lot! <br>  <br>  Astronomical observations = <br>  To scan a visible star or moon.<br>  <br>  A plate of spaghettini = <br>  Get a pile of thin pasta. <br>  <br>  Computer viruses =<br>  Must revise our PC! <br>  <br>  A cure for bald males =<br>  A dream for cue-balls. <br>  <br>  A marble statue =<br>  Mute alabaster. <br>  <br>  Confederate general =<br>  Grant faced one R. E. Lee<br>  <br>  Sumo tournaments =<br>  Enormous mutants! <br>  <br>  A watched pot never boils =<br>  Observe the cold pan....wait! <br>  <br>  The shoe lover =<br>  Hot over heels? <br>  <br>  The magician =<br>  Am I cheating? <br>  <br>  Significant other ~<br>  is nice for at night. <br>  <br>  A game of Russian Roulette =<br>  A failure's sent to a morgue.|`|ff37da871fa150745717f94a6c932cf0aa	a mix of letters if put in the right order would mean something.<br>  Consider ur Scrabble game choice of letters. they constitute a one word anagram.

Both are very similar in that they are in small rural town. As for quite, I would say they are equal but I would lean toward Kutztown as you are closer to some larger towns (and cities) if you need to get away.|`|3e4f5f3a73284f3d47b4bf818c145e46aa	I was born, rasied, and was educated in Kutztown. First of all, it is not in Amish country. There are no Amish living in this area. You will find Amish about 1 hour drive in lancaster PA. Menonites live in and around the Kutztown area. As for which Uninversity to go to, base your decision on your educational interests, not location. Not knowing anything about Bloomsburg, I can only tell you about Kutztown. The campus is very nice, everything is close to one another, maybe a 5-10 minute walk from one end of campus to the other. From the campus to "center city Kutztown" is again only 5-10 minute walk depending. I believe there is now free shuttle transportation from campus to town and back again if you do not want to walk. You should not need a car. Towns folk are freindly but will not go out of their way to be so. (in the past, a few "bad apples" have given the students a bad rap) Most of the businesses in town cater to the Uiversity student population and there are sufficient eateries and bars for all. If you are planning on finding a parttime job while at Kutztown, better aplly early. With a population of about 10,000 regulars, the population doubles when school is in session. Housing is another matter. the campus in continually added more student housing but off campus housing is getting hard to find. Some seek housing out of town to avoid paying premium prices. Anyway, enough said. Your best bet is to make an appointment at both Universities and then weigh all pros and cons, then make your decision........again based on education..........not based on the amenities each has to offer.

FdqCnU03aa	umm... just stop procrastinating?    try staying away from the TV and computer.    If you don't need internet but just microsoft word or something, pull out the internet card / disconnect the internet connection.    don't listen to music (mp3 player, etc.), generally...    do everything efficiently...    this might sound cheesy, but make goals and be determined to keep them--and work hard! For example, make a goal such as being the top of your classes -- or at least top of certain classes. It's not that hard, really, even in honors/ap classes. And if you actually work hard towards a goal like this, it would kind of follow that you would do the best work possible, and on time.... since goals kind of motivate you.. :P    yeah. so good luck! it's all mental, mostly... so make yourself stop procrastinating!|`|3VLvEeRUaa	Recognize that procrastination stems from habit. New habits will be needed, and these take time and commitment to develop.Understand the cause for procrastination, then develop strategies to fix it. Recognize the difference between an appropriate decision to delay, and an irrational postponement without justification. Fix procrastination by working on a) tasks and b) your environment:     Unpleasant tasks rarely turn out to be as bad as you think. Complete these tasks first. Schedule them for early in the day. Give yourself a reward for doing them.     Are you are tired or lazy? Are you' just not very interested in the task?  Reward yourself for accomplishments. Go out for special lunches when major projects are completed. If you don't earn the reward, don't take it.     Tailor your environment for work. Close your door, clean up the clutter on your desk. Remove distractions such as water coolers, snacks, in-boxes, coffee machines and magazine racks.    Sometimes losing concentration causes delays.Create a to-do list with priorities. Block your time for projects. As you get distracted from a work project, make a rule that you are not allowed to move out of your chair, make a call, surf the net, pick up a book etc. until you return to your task. Complete something. Make a very small task for yourself and finish it. Very small. Then, make another one.     From my personal experience, the way I avoid procrastination is by thinking of how free and relaxed I will feel if I get the task done early.
SIhxrxD3aa	You need 08.  You can estimate using 2007 informaiton, but you'll just have to go back and correct it later so you might as well wait.|`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	Tell your parents to hurry up an get all their info.  Maybe they need to go to a local tax accountant if they need help doing their taxes.    There are no loopholes.  The governement needs to know if you've won the lottery or if your parents got a big bonus this year or the reverse and they lost a lot and thus you need more support.    Wait for your taxes.  Only then may you fill out the FASFA 09.|`|UoWZaQG8aa	If you use your '07 taxes and claim them as '08..and you get verified, you'll risk losing your aid because they require copies of your parents '08 taxes when they verify you and match them to the FAFSA you submitted.  About 20% (and upwards depending on the university) get verified.    Also, if you use your parents '07 taxes and submit your FAFSA with them as your estimated taxes for '08 you'll have to change it once they're finalized.  My financial aid advisor strongly discouraged me from doing this because he said your chances of getting verified (which means submitting lots of extra paperwork and having to wait additional time for the approval anyway) goes up exponentially when you use estimated taxes the first time around.    Your parents will have their forms from their jobs by January 28th (required by law).  After that point, unless they have major financial investments that they're not telling you about, they should have everything they need to do their taxes.  So, your best bet is to bug them to do their taxes early so you can submit your FAFSA early.    One more thing though, even if you file it soon most universities don't pull the data until after the close date for on-time submissions which isn't until late March anyway, so the only reason to really want to do it early is to get it out of the way before your course load gets heavy.

AA10176626	Basket:    Spend a few minutes with the US Department of Education booklet that I've linked below. It's called "Funding Education Beyond High School: The Guide to Federal Student Aid", and it's the best resource that I know of for explaining all of the different types of financial assistance that are available to college students.    One of the things you'll read about is the Stafford loan program. The Stafford is a government-guaranteed lending program that lends only to college students. There is just no better program out there, because you're pretty much already qualified. The lenders aren't interested in your income, or your credit history, and you don't need a cosigner.     The interest rate on a Stafford loan is low and fixed, and you won't begin repaying the loan until you've been out of school for 6 months.    There is an annual borrowing limit - this year it is $5500 for freshman, $6500 for sophomores and $7500 for juniors and seniors. I'm guessing that will go a long way towards covering the cost of your room and board.    Be aware, however, that the so-called "alternative" or "private" loans that college students have sometimes relied on in the past to supplement their Stafford borrowing are pretty much unavailable right now. You've read about the banking and lending crisis - well here's another result of that mess. That's the beauty of the Stafford loan, and why the government's financial aid is so important to students right now. You may not be able to get a "private' loan, but you will have no problem getting a Stafford loan.    I hope that helps - good luck!|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Fill out a FAFSA before March 1st of the year you are going to be starting college. If you don't qualify for federal grants then you will be offered either federal subsidized or unsubsidized loans and possibly alternative loans. You don't need a job first. You sign a promissory note that says once you cease to be a fulltime student you will make monthly payments on your loan. It will all be explained when they're offered.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Honestly it can be tough if your parents are not willing to help, especially if they make too much money.  To find out if you can get a student loan on your own, you go to www.fafsa.ed.gov  and fill out your FAFSA application.  You will need your parents income EVEN IF you live on your own and they don't claim you. This is the rule until you are 24.  Then in a few weeks you get a email telling you if you are eligible for aid.  In my case, my parents made too much money so I was ineligible for a student loan.  I lived by myself and everything but thats the law, so I really could not go to schoo full time and pay for it until I was 24.  Anyways, after you apply for FAFSA and get approved, you would then go to your college of choice and fill out their loan application at the Financial Aid office.  They will then have you sign a promissory note and agreement.  Its not based on your credit and its actually more beneficial to not have a job when it comes to student loans. I made 28000 last year and ended up getting only 1/2 of what I would have gotten had I made nothing.  Yeah right like I can afford 10k out of pocket. Oh well. Good luck.|`|xVJhjIciaa	You don't NEED a job unless you can go to school and work at the same time, and if you want one, of course. The first thing you should do is fill out the FAFSA and this will give you access to grants (free money) and stafford loans which have a really low interest rate. Just make sure to only borrow what you need because it is easy to get into debt fast while in college, and then you have to start paying back the loans 6 months after you graduate. You can also apply for private students loans, but you most likely will need a cosigner, and you can do this at a bank. You should also apply for scholarships, and you can find links to many at www.collegetipsntricks.com|`|AA10961744	visit the financial aid office. they will help you.
fhET9Awpaa	I find that using narratives to open up a story is a good hook for readers. Maybe start off describing a certain event that was hard for you, or describe a moment.          "I listened to my feet hitting the pavement yet..."  "After ____ occurred, I realized that somehow...."  "Listening to her talk made me think about..."  "One more day like this and I thought I'd just quit or give up. I've had enough of it."          Something like that would be good. Just effectively express your frustration, impatience, accomplishments, pride, and be honest with all of your emotions. Describe the struggles in depth. Good luck and I hope you get a great grade.

fYF16ObCaa	a little late are we??? hahaha there is a solution to your problems. I had the same issue actually, I coulfdnt change any of the information after I sent in one of my apps. What you have to do is log into your page where it has all the college names tabbed at the top. To the left of the page you will see various tabs like Instructions, My Colleges.... on that column of choices click on the Common Application tab. After you click that, you will have to make multiple versions of your application by following the instructions on the page. Then go back the screen that comes up after log in and click on your college names, then you will be able to designate which colleges are to which version of your application. I believe that after you make a new version you might have to re enter all the information, but atleast you can still change your essay. Good Luck

"meet my dad, the hoarder"  would be a good first sentence.  describe the items he keeps, and speculate on the reasons he may have for keeping them, ie, the marbles  -  he holds on to them so if he's ever accused of having lost his marbles, he has a spare set to replace them.  the lincoln logs and remote control cars may fetch a big buck on ebay, and so on...  try to think of things that were useful 30 years ago, and imagine what you could do with them now.  try to imagine his perspective and poke fun at that a bit.  imagine what would happen if he took a box of his treasures to the antiques roadshow....
MyUi3Blyaa	I feel a bit guilty now :I     There are many highs in this job but the best for me is the happiness of the children. They tend to be forgiving too in the kindy through to 4th Grade. Then it's a matter of dual respect for each other, not too cool and not too unfair.    The low points are the housekeeping. You have to be uber organized and have eyes in the back of your head. I haven't come close yet. correcting is a big part of your organizing skills, try to do it within class time.    It is a recession proof job and you get all the best holidays.    You can earn $50000 p.a pretty quickly in the US.    I am getting back on the horse after a 7 year break. It's a lot harder this time but I am enjoying it more because I can manage the children a lot better. Understanding where they are at academically and at the same time socially is a hard mix at times.    The best part is the light bulb moment. When you can see the child understands something and will never forget it from that time on. You think you made a difference. Quite often the child will forget this moment so keep it to yourself and let them grow.    The best next step is to look at the local community where you intend to live and forecast what type of community it will be in a few years. The more young families the more jobs.

You might like to begin with:  "Welcome everyone and I would like to share with you my views about 2am lockout.   At the end of my presentation I will invite you to share your comments or opinions about this subject."   (You then continue with your presentation.)    Suggestion: You might arrange for your teacher or a student to note briefly the questions, comments the students make onto a chart or whiteboard. This could then be part of the lesson, students make a note of what is written on the whiteboard when comments and questions are completed.    Hope this helps|`|qk5uuVxcaa	What the hell is a 2am lockout?
qk5uuVxcaa	Never been to Gainsville, but I have a friend who went there, and he loved it.  Absolutely loved it.  College town all the way.  I guess it is in a more rural setting so to speak, so the college is the center attraction.  I can get you more information, or put you in contact with him if you have other questions.      I got my Masters from USF.  It's a decent school.  The atmosphere is pretty nice.  It is city oriented, and there are lots of commuters.  The weekends seem to be fairly drab.  People tend to scoot down to Ybor city to party, which is a strip of bars/clubs about 1/2 hour from campus.      UCF is right in the middle of tourist centered Orlando.  If you like busy, busy cars, busy people, you will love the action.  Personally, I hate even trying to drive in Orlando, but a friend of mine graduate from there.  He loved it so much he lives there.      Sorry I can't be more help.  I am not really sure what you are looking for in an atmosphere.  Email me if you have more questions.|`|IdGe1JWyaa	I'll answer the UF Gainesville one since I'm a student at UF.    Gainesville is a small city with nothing much in it expect for the university.  The beaches are not that close to Gainesville.  It's pretty easy to get around since it is not that big.  But if you want to fly anywhere it will cost you $300 to $700 more to fly out of Gainesville compared to flying out of a major city like Orlando, Tampa or Jacksonville.  Most people that live in Gainesville drive to those cities to fly.  All of them are about two hours drive.    Are the people nice?  For the most part but the student are very competitive.    Is the apartments reasonably affordable?  Not really but that are about the same as Orlando and Tampa.  The landlords at most apartments in Gainesville are scumbags and will scam you out of a lot of money and you will never see your deposit back.    I wont have my car so is there any transportation available?  The bus system to campus from the apartments around campus is good so you really could survive without a car.  You might want to get a moped/scooter or bike.

Both are rather convoluted. What exactly are you trying to say? - that you should be thinking about your future now?|`|cLW7vFUGaa	I wouldn't use either of those wording choices, because it introduces clarity issues. (Are they TELLING you this "in/during the present," or are they referring to your EDUCATION "in/during the present"?)    It would probably be clearest if it was something like:  "They told me to consider my future plans and my present education."  (Or "current education.")    But if your only choices are the first two, I'd probably say "in."|`|aDDZu9bPaa	They both make sense, think the other answerer's can't understand that you can make decisions about your own future now.

AA10176626	Okay, how about some facts, rather than guesses?    A federal or state drug conviction CAN disqualify a student for Federal Student Aid - however:    Convictions ONLY count if they were for an offense that occurred during a period of enrollment for which the student was receiving Federal Student Aid. If you were convicted of an offense that occurred while you were not attending school on financial aid, those offenses do NOT count against you for financial aid purposes.    Even if the offense occurred WHILE you were attending school, the disqualification is only temporary for a first offense. If you were convicted of a felony charge of sale, you are disqualified for 2 years from the date of conviction. Not only that - if you successfully completed a qualified drug rehabilitation program, you can become immediately eligible for aid, once again, without waiting 2 years.    I hope that helps answer your question. Good luck. It would be great to see you turn your life around.|`|4vwF28RRaa	drug felonies usually disqualify you from receiving ANY government-based student aid, but the best thing to do is check with the FA office at your intended school...be VERY up-front with her/him, with details and specifics and be honest...if you are dishonest about the details, you may find yourself facing felony fraud charges, depending on the dollar amount involved.
fhET9Awpaa	Well Salem witch hunts had persecution over females and a few males accused of having powers because they were "different." Differences could be a female being able to float in water, living by theirselves in a secluded area, not attending church regularly for no good reason, etc. Puritans were deeply afraid of sinning and Satan, which is why they weeded out those who they deemed not fittingly living up to God's expectations.         Gitmo-by-the-bay is where America has placed terrorists or suspected terrorists into highly guarded yet grueling confinement. A good book to read that goes into that subject a little is "Little Brother." Within that it states how the DHS, Department of Homeland Security, uses torture to interrogate people who are "thought" to be terrorists, yet there isn't enough proof to actually condemn them. If the DHS chooses to, they could sent prisoners across the ocean to other country secret prisons. I think that America has detained people within Guantanamo bay because they are afraid of another 9/11 happening if they don't catch everyone. Thinking of this reminds me how Japanese were put into internment camps within World War II in America and how the Arabs see Kurds as terrorists yet Kurds see themselves as freedom fighters. However, keeping this all in mind, it's a generalization to say everyone is scared of this or that.        All of it comes down to fear. People hunted other people that were "witches or wizards" because they were fearful of their differences and thought they'd harness evil powers over society. Prisoners are thrown into a camp because they are considered a possible terrorist and therefore might create another terrorist attack upon a country. I hope this helped you a little...  =)

But that doesn't make you a transfer student, as a transfer student is actually someone that attended a College full time and transfers to another College.  You are a High School graduate, and you're like any other High School graduate that will be applying to different Colleges, but having College credit might come in handy and enhance your application, because Colleges would know that you dedicate yourself and you're serious about your education.|`|XFB0KTmYaa	no...whatever highschool program you are using are affiliated with a certain college or college's.....they are working together....so If you have this College credit...it will only be accepted by the college that is working hand in hand in this way with your highscool.

AA10742145	See ... I hate when schools expect people to know things without showing them how it's done. <br>  <br>  First off, writing is an art, and like painting or playing piano, the only way you learn to write well is to write, and write, and write. So if what you're writing sounds bad, no worries. So don't be shy. <br>  <br>  The best way to incorporate quotes into an essay is to have the quotes really mean something. "Give me liberty or give me death" is a great quote, but it has nothing to do with writing. So it's inappropriate here. But as Edwin Schlossberg said, "The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can think." That is a relevant quote. <br>  <br>  It's entirely true, too. Your teacher doesn't care if you write about your puppy being born or when you pushed your brother down a flight of stairs. She does, however, want to see that you can take something outside of yourself (the problem in a book) and apply it       <br>  to your own life. So you create a context for her (your situation) and then compare the problem in the book. <br>  <br>  For instance, you can say that you used to be racist, but when you read Mark Twain you realized Jim (the black guy) was a good guy, and that made you think twice. Or, you hated writing, but Catcher in the Rye inspired you. Whatever your situation, try to make it real for your teacher. <br>  <br>  Let's take Mark Twain (I realize this is a touchy subject but I'm not trying to be offensive: I'm using it because almost everyone has read Huckleberry Finn or Tom Sawyer in school). You can say, "there used to be a guy named Steve in my class. Like Tom Sawyer, I thought that "___insert racist Tom Sawyer quote___." Then blah blah blah and I realized that Steve, like Jim, "___insert better Tom Sawyer quote___." <br>  <br>  That's just an example. In that example I've done both experiences together (mine and Tom's). You could do Tom's first, and then refer back to it, or yours first and the relate Tom's to you. There is no pattern. It's just generally more interesting for your reader (and keeping your teacher interested means a better grade) if you move in some order. I chose, for the example, a chronological order (first this, then this, finally this). <br>  <br>  Finally, some general tips. Don't use a big word when a smaller will do ("use" is better than "utilize"). It makes you sound like you're trying to impress people. A good writer makes everything clear, a great writer makes everything seem so easy that you don't realize it was terribly complicated in the first place.<br>  <br>  Don't write more words than you need to get your subject across. George Orwell said, "It is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning." Teachers unfortunately assign things by word count or page number. Make the count, but try not to write without meaning. <br>  <br>  And lastly, at least attempt to have fun. You probably don't like writing now, but it is a great skill to have, and far too many people now think it's unneccessary. They are wrong. You don't need to be a great writer, just like you don't have to be Pavarotti to enjoy singing in the shower. If you do all your assignments with an open attitude, you may be surprised to find, occasionally, a little enjoyment sneaking in when you're not looking. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11574901	See if your school has access to a database called "Opposing Viewpoints", if so they will give you both sides of the argument. Remember to be objective and not take either side of the issue. Stick to the facts, not your opinion. Unless the assignment calls for you to take a side. You can also look up pro's and con's of the topics.<br>  <br>  Give equal time to both sides.|`|UxwSGdzTaa	Yes, relate how the characters in the problem dealt with the problem compared with how it is similar or different then how you would and also why and give lots of reasons!!|`|b985e1bb4dd7c02708ee4d73e11f0946aa	You can mix it up a bit. First a quote, your story, another quote, more story, etc. In this way you can demonstrate the parallels as they arise rather than expecting the reader to remember everything in one chunk.|`|AA10882020	OK, here is what I have done in similar circumstances. Pick a pronlem in a book that you feel you can relate to your own life experiences. Scan through the book looking for quotes relating to that problem that you feel you can use. Make a list.<br>  <br>  Write about how that problem relates to your life and use the quotes throughout your writing strategically to emphasize how the problems in your book are similar to your own experiences.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps

3VLvEeRUaa	The summary should be expressed - as far as possible - in your own words. It's not enough to merely copy out parts of the original.     Aim for something like one tenth of the original. [A summary which was half the length of the original would not be a summary.]     Read the original quickly, and try to understand its main subject or purpose.     Then you will need to read it again to understand it in more detail.     Underline or make a marginal note of the main issues. Use a highlighter if this helps.     Remember that the purpose [and definition] of a paragraph is that it deals with one issue or topic.     Write a one or two-sentence account of each section you identify. Focus your attention on the main point. Leave out any illustrative examples.     Write a sentence which states the central idea of the original text.     Use this as the starting point for writing a paragraph which combines all the points you have made.

yGOmMQP7aa	Student loans are never "Wiped Out" and the balance NEVER goes away.  Eventually your friend will pay it off, either willingly or unwillingly.      They will garnish her paychecks and seize her income tax refunds.  Even is she is old and getting social security and still hasn't paid it back, they can garnish that too. 30, 40, 50+ years from now.    Be aware that a loan of a mere 4,000 could easily become a debt of 20,000 or 40,000 or more depending on how many years she doesn't pay on it.  Debt collectors are legally allowed to hike the interest, charge all kinds of penalties and  fees and you WILL eventually pay it.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	She has to pay it off completely.

cfd4d18d34974ff71f38935344e324ebaa	Unfortunately, most subs end up being babysitters (and underpaid ones at that!). I've had a high school student try to say I wasn't even a teacher; I was just a sub! Yeah, a sub with a Master's Degree in Education!     Students today are changing into mini-adults socially, thinking they can do whatever they want since there is no ultimate authority over them. Although we cannot bring paddles back into the classroom (as much as it would probably help), I am encouraged by your tenacity in trying to improve this classroom.     Going to a class once is not going to improve any class, but if you are able to continue to sub in the same room and get the children to know you better, your classroom management techniques will begin to work gradually. The more you can do yourself without outside interference, the better! Although a once a day visit from a principal or veteran teacher would help also. (remember that at school may be the only structure they have in their life, so it will take time for them to respond)    I am through with subbing for the most part; it is so taxing. Good luck with your efforts!!!|`|SwyxANphaa	It's a tough situation, since you're not their regular teacher and therefore have not earned their respect yet.  Depending on how long you're subbing, I'd create a real system of consequences, potentially in levels.    For example, a small offense gets x consequence (start small - warning or something similar).  Get progressively tougher, with consequences such as a note home, a trip to the office, detention, etc.      Write your system up, and post it in the classroom, or distribute it to them.  Let them know you're in charge, and follow through on your consequences.

db06833cd32d477373d0a2c38a077b60aa	The ball would decelerate (slow down) at a rate of 9.8 m/s^2 due to the force of gravity.    Since gravity is the only force acting on this ball (assuming that there is no wind, air resistance, or rocket engines attached to it), then we have a simple relationship.  Here, it helps to draw out a force diagram.      So the ball slows down every second it travels.  After the first second, the ball is traveling at 40m/s - (9.8m/s^2 * 1 s) = 40m/s - 9.8m/s = 30.2m/s     After 5 seconds the ball would be traveling at 40m/s - (9.8m/s^2 * 5 s) = -9m/s    This means that the ball has reached its zenith and started to come back to you.

A teacher with a degree can make anything in the range of 30-something thousand dollars to about 70-something thousand dollars depending on where he/she lives, how much experience he/she has, and how much continuing education he/she has.|`|hyHvG1Olaa	The majority of cases in the United States and most of the countries around the world involving teachers is that they need a "formal" degree to teach.  There are exceptions in the case of building trades, heavy equipment, etc. where experience is important.  In this regard the salary is pretty much the same but finding a position without a degree can be limited as to what is available.

RFPtIcx5aa	They are different laws and have different aims.     Bush's $700 billion is called the Troubled Asset Relief Program ("TARP"), and was created to buy the bad assets off banks so they could avoid taking those losses and so forth. Now, that $700B is being used in other ways to stimulate the economy.    Obama's plan (American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan) focuses mostly on adding preventing home foreclosures and new jobs, largely through funding infrastructure programs. Obama is also expected to add a national "Bad Bank," that would have a similar purpose as Bush's TARP bill.     Hope that helps!

Enslaved African Americans created a politics, cuisine, religion, theology, and music.  How do we explain this contradiction to our students: that one of the worst things in human history helped to create some of the best things?  We explain it by putting the ever-changing institution of slavery in historical context.      Slaverys beginnings       1. 12-19th century     2. In the history of the world, most people worked in coerced labor relations.     3. Slavery was approved by most religious texts.         Five Generations Within U.S. Slavery       1. Charter Generation        Entered the mainland North America before the plantation system developed fully. Much experience of an Atlantic world.     2. Plantation Generation        After plantation system was organized, slaves were more likely to come from interior than coastal Africa; to have less knowledge of larger Atlantic world; no experience with Creole language; work harder; die earlier than charter generation     3. Revolutionary Generation        Living through the American Revolution, this generation raised the issue of freedom explicitly and powerfully.     4. Migration Generation        Mass migration between 1800 and 1860 from the seaboard to the interior of the U.S. Millions moved; mostly children     5. Freedom Generation        Experiences emancipation and translates African American culture from the context of slavery to freedom

Then we do the lesson, I break it into little pieces and stop about every 3-5 minutes to check for understanding.  Short notes that are on overhead, powerpoint or a flip chart, so you do not have to stop and spell all of the time.

CzdxFiRLaa	Size can be genetic, but also diet and lack of exercise has a lot to do with it.  A person's size (unless there is an underlying medical condition) is environmental and social.  So if your girlfriend has a good figure now and she take pride in her appearance, then it is likely she will remain that, after marriage and after having kids.      Remember that the physical appearance is only one small part of a relationship, you need to acknowledge this girl's other attributes and why you like her to be her true friend, partner and lover.|`|YoZvAahuaa	No, because her mom is fat it does not mean she is going to be fat too.

Remember that sometimes people say things that they don't even know. It is great that you try to reach an answer instead of believing what you hear.

Or if you're doing that bad, and you think its not worth it, then take a less advanced class? Because then again, there's no point of taking a course you don't understand right? Your decision.

Also get there somewhat early so you can be the one to choose where your sitting vs. your friend saying no not today.    Teacher will end up respecting you if you show you make an effort.  If he doesnt, oh well. Not all teachers are going to like you, im sure you can point out a few people in your school who you just know you dont like- even if for no reason. so just focus on getting the work done.

SIhxrxD3aa	No not at all.  Very few courses transfer from the tech school into the pre-vet curriculum.  You'd actually end up adding at least a year to your total education.  It is a complete waste of time because you're not using your tech degree.    Some people seem to think that if they have a tech degree, then they can work as a vet tech through school to be a vet.  It doesn't usually work out that way because veterinarians prefer to hire their technicians full time and don't want to rearrange schedules every semester.  Also, it's impossible to work during those last 4 years of vet school.  If you can't use that tech degree to gain veterinary experience then it's worthless.  It would be a much better use of your time to get a part time job working as an assistant or kennel help or even a receptionist at a vet clinic.  I have known several people with tech degrees that have applied to vet school and on average it takes them longer to get accepted.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	It's not really going to help.

oLI2SJ08aa	A.I. research is a pretty good field. I think you should go into it, especially if it's something you're interested in. Besides, maybe the AI field will explode in the next 5 years and you'll be making millions.    If you're more interested in using technology, rather than research it, look into something like software design or computer engineering. I know you said you don't want to do engineering, but computer engineering is nothing like civil engineering or bioengineering. Also consider robotics if you like to see computer science manifested in a physical form.    Consider doing an internship to supplement what ever major you do eventually decide on. It'll help narrow your career interests, give you invaluable experience in the field and make your classes that much more interesting.
9olha1dKaa	Here's my take which I based on my own experience as a family physician (FP) and my children, cousins, nephews/nieces, and friends who are both in medicine and law.    1. I say both are equally stressful and have high workloads. Depends on what specialty of law or medicine. There can be different types of stress. Both can experience long working hours, issues dealing with insurance or settlement payments, and so forth.    2. It depends a great deal on where you are. Family physicians do very well in rural areas since they are the Jack of all trades, taking care from Obstetrics, primary care, to surgery. It's not unheard of to be making 300,000/yr or more. In cities where there are many specialists, FP's don't do as well. For NYC, average pay is around $170-250,000/yr. Count in NY State with the highest malpractice premium in the country, that cuts your salary down to 130-200,000/yr, sometimes more depending if you do obstetrics or other procedures that exposes you to liability. There isn't much more than that unless you become more of a business man and own multiple clinics or you become a non-board certified dermatologist or cosmetic plastic surgeon. The biggest limiting factor is that insurance doesn't pay much which forces you to see more patients in a far shorter time.    Law also varies between their specialties. Corporate lawyers shine in big cities, working 80-90hr/wk earning 150-250,000/yr start. Potential is far greater, you can work the ropes and eventually make partner in a big firm. Or you can open your own practice. There is no big limiting factors like insurance, the limiting factor is mostly yourself. What you put into it is what you get.    3. Both are equally difficult to get in, and both require significant amount of studying. It all comes down to length of studying. Law requires 3 years of law school and you're done. Medicine requires 4 years of med school, and also requires residency which is anywhere as short as 3 years, to average of 4 years such as FP's, or surgery which is 5-6 years. Fellowship may add additional 1-3 years on top of your residency.    4. Law is far better job outlook in the future. There is no limiting factor that affects their income in the future, and people will always need lawyers.    Medicine is a ticking time bomb and it's going down the hill fast. Continual lower medical insurance reimbursement and rising malpractice premium makes it very difficult for all medical doctors to survive. I've known several of my friends who had to declare bankruptcy because of high overhead. You can't make a living off $20-30 office visit when you need to spend 10-15 minutes with a patient while business overhead costs $300 per hour. Do the math. How many patients do you need to see to cover your business expense and personal expense? And insurance companies are trying to lower reimbursements even lower. GHI is the worst, pays $6 office visit.    If you want to do medicine, don't become a FP in a major city unless you're in the boonies. Only profitable specialties in the future will be dermatology and plastics. Because insurance doesn't cover it, and patients are willing to pay cash.    Or become a dentist. On average, they have higher starting salaries than medical doctors.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	The grade in your AP class doesn't matter; it's the score on the test that matters.  A crappy teacher might give you an A in the course even if you only get a 1 on the test - you need to have a transferable score on the test.  For most colleges, that means a 3 or better.  However, if you did poorly on the SAT math section even when your school thought you were at the AP calculus level, you might want to take some lower-level math classes to catch up.  And if you didn't take the AP exam, it won't count - you won't have any transferable math courses.|`|uLoHyCXNaa	That doesnt mean anything.  You have to pass the AP test and only then will you be exempted from Calc 1 and Calc 2 in college and be placed in Calc. 3. Verify this with a university.  I was in calculus in high school and took a math proficiency test and placed in college algebra.     No big deal.  I just took math during the summer and all year and did college algebra, calc 1, calc 2 and calc 3 and multivariable calc. and now im done.    Its all about passing the AP test.  I passed AP hist and english and this saved me some time as well.

809fe92a5e8a388fd9915476812d008caa	A few thoughts:    The simple truth is that there are a lot of great colleges out there and someone has to get into them. You might not get into Harvard--frankly getting into Harvard is a crapshoot--but if you can get straight As in challenging courses you will get into a good college. Heck, I didn't get straight As and still got into a good college. Also bear in mind that, in this day and age, most people wind up getting additional schooling after college, so the college you get into won't necessarily be the only school you wind up going to.    While you may not have a lot in the way of extracurriculars now, you have four years to change that... You could join band, or look at this as an opportunity to go out and find some new hobbies or interests.|`|IHowy91naa	Take the time to learn about colleges and what it takes to get in. Harvard is one thing--you can have perfect grades and scores and be rejected, but Berkeley is MUCH easier to get into. If you work hard and do well, you'll get into a great college, maybe not an ivy league school but there are plenty of great schools.|`|AA11604732	Maybe you won't get into Harvard -- but if you have great grades, you will certainly get into some great university.    And yes -- I did believe I could do it -- and I now have graduate degrees from Duke and Berkeley.|`|SIhxrxD3aa	No.  They look at much more than grades.  Someone with few or no extracurriculars isn't going to be accepted.  You also need stellar SAT scores.|`|atTJPGfwaa	Unfortunately its not about getting good grades anymore , you have to be a great all around student but also a great person  , it will probably help if you join clubs and do some community out-reach type of thing.  Do some volunteer work or some community service .|`|NB7fmHgAaa	I always say "have faith" and "look at your positives." You certainly have stellar grades and thus competitive academically wise. Are you sure you have no extracurriculars. People always think extracurriculars are stuff you do in school like clubs and sports. I had a friend that put babysitting as an extracurricular activity and was able to write about that in his essays. He even was able to talk for a good 20 minutes in one of his college interviews about babysitting his 4 younger brothers and sisters.    Just  "look at your positives" and be able to express those things about yourself in your applications, interviews, and essays and you will definitely get into any college that you desire.    If you're in eighth grade, then you have plenty of time to worry about your future. Continue doing well in school and do something that interests you. Remember, the most interesting person is not necessarily the one that has a long list of activities. An interesting person is someone who is passionate about a certain thing and makes people say "how did she/he do that?"    Good Luck.|`|PAUB1Sm3aa	You..need extracurriculars.     Right. I'm taking all high school core classes [Honors Biology, Gifted Trigonometry, Honors Freshman Composition, Gifted Foundations of World History/Gft. Philosophy] and I'm in eighth grade as well. So I've got you beat there...    Yes, I believe I can do this. I'm planning for a LOT of extracurriculars [Choir, Golf, Drill, Robotics, maybe Track, aiming for 500+ hrs community service].    You have to be good at the extracurriculars as well. I'm 100% positive I'll get into varsity golf next year.     So.....you need extracirriculars. Tons of people are in advanced classes and have A's. You need to stand out, to have something special.    But nothing's ever guaranteed. I mean, I'm shooting for the stars, but I know there isn't a really large chance I can make it. You have to try your best anyway, though. Plenty of other good colleges that aren't as hard to get into.

Uy8ntukjaa	She has three options and none of them are pleasant    1) be 24 years old  2) get married  3) have a kid    The only other loophole is if she can prove family estrangement, like if she hasn't had any contact with her parents and she can prove it.

However, teacher salaries are governed by contracts negotiated with teachers' unions, and those unions are fiercely opposed to paying high-demand, low-supply teachers like math and science any differently from sociology teachers.  Sociology teachers would have a hard time getting jobs anywhere else, and getting a degree in sociology is far easier than getting a degree in math, but the unions don't care.

I dated an engineer once and his work looked like Latin to me, but he picked it up so easily. However, his writing skills weren't that great and it took him several extra years to finish his thesis.     So, you think the math teacher should get more money because he had/has the potential to do something else? Couldn't you say the same thing for an English or Science teacher?? He's paid to be a teacher, period. I bet he couldn't do your job! For his perspective, your job might look difficult.  Personally, I think you're all underpaid!|`|6LjuooU8aa	Well that's sort of the big kicker isn't it. You are right, some math teachers are extremely educated when it comes to engineering or economics, or some other math based profession.    But, I know a few math professors and teachers and all of them chose to teach. Something about getting other people to improve themselves. So I don't believe they should get paid more because they have weighed the alternatives and know that the teacher's salary isn't glamorous at all.    Plus, if the salaries were raised that would definitely be unfair to the rest of the teachers. Giving higher pay to math teachers would show the rest of the teachers that their subject is somewhat less significant.

shVgCizBaa	My opinion is that Hoover did not inject enough money in the economy during the first part of the depression. He became the scapegoat; Roosevelt was elected in 1932 and spent more money.---------------------------- Excerps:Hoover became the Republican Presidential nominee in 1928. His election seemed to ensure prosperity. Yet within months the stock market crashed, and the Nation spiraled downward into depression.    After the crash Hoover announced that while he would keep the Federal budget balanced, he would cut taxes and expand public works spending.    In 1931 repercussions from Europe deepened the crisis, even though the President presented to Congress a program asking for creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to aid business, additional help for farmers facing mortgage foreclosures, banking reform, a loan to states for feeding the unemployed, expansion of public works, and drastic governmental economy.    At the same time he reiterated his view that while people must not suffer from hunger and cold, caring for them must be primarily a local and voluntary responsibility.    His opponents in Congress, who he felt were sabotaging his program for their own political gain, unfairly painted him as a callous and cruel President. Hoover became the scapegoat for the depression and was badly defeated in 1932. In the 1930's he became a powerful critic of the New Deal, warning against tendencies toward statism.  http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presiden...|`|zZez0OFeaa	Herbert Hoover was elected in 1928, and sworn in in Jan of 1929.

AA11604732	Sure -- lots of doctors get board certified in more than one area.  It does mean doing two residencies and making less money while you learn both disciplines, though.
AA11604732	Drexel is a very goos school that is a bit overshadowed by its neighbor -- The University of Pennsylvania.  Drexel is located right next to Philadelphia's 30th street station.  Center City Philadelphia (Downtown) is just to the East and Penn is just to the West.  The neighborhood west of Penn is not particularly nice -- or safe.  But if you don't stray in that direction, it isn't too bad.  It is a very urban campus.    It is not easy to get into -- but not incredibly hard, either.  US News ranks it as a tier one university -- which is pretty good.  Drexel accepts about 75% of those who apply.  But the applicant pool is good, with 82% of those accepted having a GPA of 3.0 or better.

For your first sentence, you could write about how other people might imagine India to look like at first (Baliwood, for example), and then contrast it with what you saw.  In your body paragraph, you add all the points you want to make; go into detail on what exactly you saw, how it made you feel/think, and how it changed your life. Normally, I'd tell you to separate your body paragraph into 3 separate ones for each point, but you'll have to keep them together.  Your conclusion should neatly summarize what you've said, and to make it interesting you could add a famous quote and explain it (explaining is a must), or you could include a "wrap-around," a reference to the attention-grabber you used in the first paragraph. For example, "It's harsh, but Baliwood's not as glamorous as you think either."    **For the record, these ideas are nothing but examples to help jog your brain into action. Personal speeches need that personal touch. You could think up better ones anyway.

zCOvQwQhaa	The area of study is community development.     Which degree you need depends on what you mean by "help" - there's all sorts of help provided to these folks.  If you mean medical help then you'll need a medical degree.  If you mean educating them about various things (AIDS, health, literacy) you'll need a degree in education.    If you mean helping them develop sustainable agriculture then it'd be a degree in agriculture whereas helping with building economic capacity would be a degree in business.    One agency that provides a lot of such help is US Aid.  http://www.usaid.gov/    Take a look at their open jobs and you can get an idea about what those sorts of jobs look for in applicants.  http://www.usaid.gov/careers/|`|LuPKIEmdaa	I wouldn't think you'd need a degree for that.

ZsY13J5Uaa	Because it is square root, we can assume the exponent of (x-1) to be 1/2. To find the derivative, you multiply the coefficient, which in this case is 1, by the exponent, which is 1/2. Afterwards, you subtract the exponent by 1. So...    f(x) = (x-1)^1/2   f''(x) = 1/(2(x-1)^1/2)    Now we have that, plug in 5 in the equation.  f'(5) = 1/2(5-1)^1/2  f'(5) = 1/2(4)^1/2  f'(5) = 1/2(2)  f'(5) = 1/4    You should get 0.25  It's at the point (5,2) so...  y - 2 = m (x - 5)    m = f'(x) = 1/2(x-1)^-1/2    y -2 = (1/2(x-1)^1/2) ( x- 5)  y  = (x-5)/(2(x-1)^1/2) + 2    I know it looks complicated, here's what the final equation would look like:                                         x-5                                  --------------             +               2                                    2sqrt(x-1)

Also, you might want to consider looking at engineering programs as part of your pre-med studies.  Medical education is quickly progressing to understand how new electircal and biomedical engineering innovations can be applied in medicine, and an engineering degree coupled with biomedical research is very attractive, assuming you keep up with your coursework.    Beyond Stanford, schools that fit that profile:  MIT  Johns Hopkins,   Duke  UC Berkeley  Cornell  Rice    MIT has more research opportunties than students available to take them, UCB has a lot of opportunities (but a lot of sutdents as well), and the other schools have good cross disclinpinary programs.|`|vNnvpLKBaa	Rutgers    Yale    Northwestern  SouthEastern|`|NB7fmHgAaa	You should know that pre-med isn't a program or major.

Ok. we know that the rectangle's width is 1/3 of the length, so I placed 1/3x. (x=the length of the rectangle)    Next, we are going to find x.    we know that the area =507 and we know that the formula for area is length times width, so we are going to create a problem.    507= x * 1/3x   and now we'll solve.  507 * 3 =x * x  1512= x * x  1512= x^2  now we are going to square root on both sides.  the result will show that x=39      now knowing that x=39, we have found the length and can find the width.    length = 39    width= 1/3 * (39)           = 13      always draw a picture it will help.    hope my explaination was understandable, good luck!

If it really is only 10 questions and 10 points, you should really ask your teacher about it, because 8 out of 10 really is 80%, and you should get a B, not a D.

You don't want to AP your way out of these - med schools recommend you take them at the highest level school you attend, which means the school you get your college degree from.

FmYkUfIDaa	Hi Johnan,                    I don't know one-best way. I would recommend that you read magazines like TIME, The Reader's Digest or even the books that you like to read and note carefully how sentences are structured. Say them out loud paying attention to punctuation.     The latter magazine also has a Word Power Page, one side asks the meaning of WORD questions, provides 4 possible answers and the other side of the page furnishes the answers.    If you have pen and paper handy you could make notes of the sentences that appeal to you or that you believe might be useful to you.    Working with someone who speaks English would be a bonus, because they would help you with pronunciation and sentence structure.    Best wishes.

Now with functions, one way you could find out if it is a function is to use a mapping diagram. Make a list of the domain and range in least to greatest. Next, draw an arrow from the domain to the range that goes with it. If there is ONE arrow coming from each domain, it IS a function. If it is not, then it IS NOT a function. Another way you could do it is by using the vertical line test. Draw a graph, and plot out your points. Then, you use a pencil or even your finger to move left and right and see if it covers two or more points. If it does, it IS NOT a function. If it does not, then it IS a function. Hope that I have helped you!|`|2WZnDpJ9aa	domain: 1,2,3,4  range: 3    the x axis points are the domain and the y axis points are the range|`|pj02ePxAaa	the domain is (1,2,3,4)    the range is (3)    when a number repeats you don't have to write it twice.    you were given for sets of ordered pairs. the domain is another word for x values (like when you graph) and the range is another word for the y values. you just write them seperate. the x is always first.     hope that helps.

Plus many phds take a long time to get, so some people will be there very long in the program. You just need to put a lot of time into it. Even if everyone seems to be younger, they might not be. In order to go for your phd you have to have graduated college (22 years old) and then most people take off for a little while to raise money or a family before they go back for their phd so they can pay of the college loans they may have accumulated.

UwRGE0Ghaa	Here are some things that I think would be great and why :)  -An Apple, because on Stephanie Meyers website she says that: "The apple on the cover of Twilight represents "forbidden fruit." I used the scripture from Genesis because I loved the phrase "the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil." Isn't this exactly what Bella ends up with? A working knowledge of what good is, and what evil is. The nice thing about the apple is it has so many symbolic roots. You've got the apple in Snow White, one bite and you're frozen forever in a state of not-quite-death... Then you have Paris and the golden apple in Greek mythologylook how much trouble that started. Apples are quite the versatile fruit. In the end, I love the beautiful simplicity of the picture. To me it says: choice."  -Stuffed animals of a lion and a lamb, because thats a good comparison of there love and it's a popular quote from the book.  -A baseball, because the baseball scene is the pivotal point in the book, where James begins his hunt.  -Money, because the Cullens have a lot of it  -A little Cactus, because Bella came from Arizona, and thats were the fight scene happens  -Hot wheels that look like the cullens cars.  -Some band aides; to show that Bella is clumsy and always getting hurt and that Carlisle is a doctor.  -A lock, because the Cullens life is top secret and Bella is the only human who knows about them.  -A rock, because vampires are supposed to be incredibly hard and strong.  -The Vampires A-Z article, because thats how Bella decided he truley was a vampire. Heres the link: http://vampiresatoz.webs.com/index-2.htm  -Vegetables, since they're vegetarian vampires :)  -Red, Black, and Yellowish-gold stones, to represent the different colors of vampires eyes.  -A squirt bottle, because it rains all of the time in forks.  -A diamond, because vampires sparkle.  -A flower, or perfume, to represent Bellas scent.    Hope this helps!|`|iZyLbv6aaa	I did that in Seventh grade and I loved it =D    Twilight..  A little collection of vampire myths from the internet.  A toy truck.

z2SODuR9aa	an impromptu speech is a speech that has to be given on the spot. there is no preparing for it. i took speech class in college and had to do an impromptu speech. what i would suggest is TAKING your time to do the speech and make sure you focus on what the subject is. If you dont know what to say make sure you pause before you continue you wouldnt want to say something that has nothing to do with the speech     good luck!!|`|mVWwOQbwaa	First - the best speakers always have something to break the ice with ( not, "with which to break the ice").  It doesn't have to be a JOKE, per se, but at least a light anecdote to link you with the subject matter.  A good example of a bad speaker who tried to get this one right is in the late 1970s, President Carter opened a speech about nuclear weapons by saying something like, "When I asked my daughter, Amy, what she thought the most important issue of our times was, she said, 'Daddy, I think it's nulcear proliferation'" ... I don't think anyone really believed him then, or now (but, since his daughter was about 11 at the time, I think, it does make for good humor.)    Second - don't try to give your speech about what you think the audience wants to hear.  They aren't going to give you a subject that you have NO idea about, so when you get the topic - think about it.  Remove your emotions from the topic for a bit, so that you can think about WHY you do or don't like it.    Remember that your speech needs to have 3 parts - an introduction, the body, and a conclusion.    In the introduction, you present the topic, and why you have the authority to talk about it.    In the body, you will list your arguments for or against the topic - try to have at least three "bullets" but no more than five.  When you are explaining WHY something is right or wrong, this is where you will use your passion, to try to influence the members of the audience with both your logic and your emotions.    Finally, in the conclusion, you will wrap up (or summarize) what you talked about... use less passion, but don't be robotic.  If you are supposed to field questions, this is where you will do that.  Thank the audience for their time and attention, and leave the stage.|`|Q8R9E7lDaa	It's best to not get in the habit of planning out speeches, to the greastest extent possible.     Learn to speak from your heart, when you're up there.

NB7fmHgAaa	Well, to become an anesthesiologist (a type of doctor), you would have to go to medical school after college and if you want to apply to medical school you would have to take a certain amount (5 or 6) of premedical courses. So, really, you can go to any college, major in anything, fufill your premedical requirements and then attend a great medical school.    A website that would help you estimate the expenses for college in or out of texas is www.collegeboard.com . Just search a college, go to cost and financial aid, and it'll give you the annual college costs.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	You'll need a 4-year college degree (major in anything and take the premed classes in bio, chem, physics and math), 4 years of medical school, and 5 years of residency.  You can do premed at any 4-year college or university and then go to med school somewhere else, so you can go wherever you want - UT Austin would be a good choice for premed.|`|AA11604732	You don't learn to be an anesthesiologist in college.  You learn in a hospital during your residency -- after you spend four years getting a BS and then another four years in medical school getting an MD or DO.    If you want to get into a good medical school, then go to the best university you can get into for your BS.  The best schools in Texas are Rice and UT.  Look at US News for rankings of undergraduate schools if you want to go out of state.

74935bb8e45f026d8f222b3b74cffd8faa	Professors like students who seem interested, and that comes through in more ways than just speaking up in class and dropping by for office hours. It sounds like you go to class regularly and write papers that show you've put some real thought and care into them. When you've got a stack of 10, 20, 30 papers to read, it's really refreshing to get to one that not only does a good job of presenting the ideas, but where it's obvious that the student is really caught up in working through an interesting problem, not just filling up space on the page. You don't see the other students' work to compare, but they do. Be glad, and keep up the good work!|`|oLI2SJ08aa	Maybe you're a good student that seems to actually pay attention in class. Teachers will look at you favorably just for looking engaged.|`|uomYVsiLaa	I'm confused what are you again  a mexican or a american?? But any how from the sounds of it it's because you show up everyday and do a great job and get very good grades and act respectable!!|`|H2DP8pVDaa	who really cares? if your in their good books USE IT!!!! take advantage of it! get high grades get high job!

54SLCIfwaa	for your fine arts:  theatre and art  2 electives: child development and cooking/ food ( my all time favorite classes)|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	What are you intrested in for one.     If you like music then I'd pick  Chorus (assuming you can sing), Orachesta/Band (assuming you know how to play an instrement)    If you are artistic then take art.     Do you like acting, then go for theater.      Not sure what you like so going on assumptions.     The same for your electives choose what you like.     And congrats on being a freshman.|`|rfwbZ2AXaa	You need to think about what you like to do the best:  Do you like to sing or play music?? Do you like to act, or do techie work or would you rather draw?    The electives:  Same thing.....do you like working with kids? Do you plan to have kids? Can you already cook? Or do you need to learn to cook?  Do you like to write? Work with images?     Really think about these, it is no fun to be stuck in a class all year that you hate.  If you cannot choose then ask about the teachers that teach the classes, sometimes that can be a big issue as well.  Good luck with whatever you pick  Beth|`|CytT8ZcSaa	theatre and band  cooking/food and creative writing|`|fMZWxzaRaa	For your fine arts:    Do you play an instrument? If you do then orchestra or band is an obvious choice. If not, go with chorus, it's probably easier than art or theater- at my high school, chorus was like, show up to class and concerts and you get an A. With art and theater you will probably be graded on your skills.    For the other elective:    Journalism and creative writing. It is always good to get more practice in writing. You may find that English classes are easier because of the extra writing practice. Plus, it looks much better to colleges to be in a writing-type class than in cooking or child development.|`|9Vjjr0M7aa	Fine Arts:  1. Theater  2. Art    Electives:  1. Creative writing  2.

C6XzxjKvaa	Actually, middle school isn't that bad. My first year of middle school, I was separated from all my friends in my class and they had people that they knew while I transferred away. All in their class. If they forget you, make more friends.     If you lose your way, you suck it up, go to the office and ask for directions explaining you're new (and make a joke of it if someone tells you that you were dorky).     If someone's bullying you physically, use the phones in the office and pretend you don't have a cellphone or just run, really (or you could do what I do and become half-friends with them or create a glare so frightening, no one dares to bully you twice).     If it's verbally or something, just play along (like say they tell you that you're a fag or something, you say, yeah I know right?)     Reject every date and play dumb with relationships until you're ready and if you can't handle parties, reject and say you're going to go to the mall or go with a friend to the party.|`|JJAodx30aa	its ok, no one will forget about you. if you make up a cool story that you did over the summer people will want to be your friend. also get a cell phone and act like its the most interesting thing in the world. everybody will like you then, even guys. trust me! im 15 years old i know all about this kinda stuff oh and dont act TOO slutty. :)|`|Zwg6T2wvaa	Don't worry every thing will work out.

QY10Hmq7aa	alright- as in it's okay.  all right- everything is right|`|eulMjLtPaa	"Alright" is non-standard usage/variant of "all right;" in other words, "all right" is the preferred grammatical term (although many authors do frequently use "alright".)|`|VKlIjfIXaa	alright is like saying okay, right is right.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	If you were meant to turn left - a big difference. Alright?    Right, aside from having to do with direction, means correct.  All right means all correct.

jN8duTx2aa	I suggest you look at your state and local requirements for school counselors.  Do they require a masters degree or is a BA enough?  Normally, it is a masters but there are exceptions.  Some schools also have combined BA/MA programs that take 5 years rather than the 6 it would normally take.  Normally the BA is in psychology, the MA is in school counselling.  Many people also have an unrelated degree and go back for an MA in school counselling (my aunt did).  http://www.schoolcounselor.org/content.a...|`|Nin6IawVaa	there is no major that states what you wnat to be    You can go to college and ask a counselor. He/she will give you the right title and list of courses you need to take to become a counselor.
3lPL6pVBaa	You know exactly the same thing happened to me.      I would always get so nervous in class and whenever the teacher called on me, I would freeze and not be able to come up with a coherent answer.      This was in 7th grade.      Then I wrote a paper and it was -really- good.      The teacher confronted me and said, 'Peter, DID YOU WRITE THIS PAPER?'      I couldn't have been more proud!  I gave him a big smile and said yes.  I had done so well that he couldn't believe it!      That moment makes me smile to this day.      Don't take it personally, Yaya.  It's not you at all.  There are students who cheat, especially now with the Internet and cell phones and text messaging and all that.  Teachers just get frustrated because they worry that students who cheat won't learn anything and will end up homeless and miserable and unloved.      You are not one of those students.  You have worked incredibly hard even though you don't enjoy math at all and you should feel very proud of yourself.      Don't let a teacher's frustration bother you at all.  Really.      Maybe it just means you're getting your answers right now.  Which is good!        One last little point: If you think -doing- math homework is boring, think how boring it must be to -grade- math homework!  LOL  Have sympathy for the old dude.  He's doing the best he can, and he's not getting paid nearly enough.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Erm... I don't know what he was thinking, you'd have to ask him.    Is this your first homework assignment in this class? It's nearly February... I'm surprised that you don't know what kind of work he wants you to turn in. Unless you just started this course, and you're on some kind of schedule that I'm not familiar with.    Anyway, if it's your first assignment, just suck it up and do what he wants next time. If you're not sure what he wants, ask before it's time to turn the thing in. Like, ask when he's giving the assignment.|`|ktbRE826aa	why dont u write him a note and explain to him what happened, just so he knows|`|84bfe623838974188db70f3e01e4ea29aa	Dont be embarassed. go to him and show him the paper and compare it to your answers so he "buys" it. you deserve your credit.|`|vJIZkbRdaa	Talk to him..

If you had been hurt or mistreated before, you would approach a relationship with a "jaded" (skeptical) attitude; however, if you had nothing but good come out of life, you would revere and hold high the experiences and relationships that come your way.  It's all about attitude.  Your approach to life can be jaded (meaning you approach things cautiously and with a certain degree of cynicism) based on your past experiences.|`|bEbkV69naa	It means one is either optimistic or pessimistic, (or comparable opposites) when considering the world.
AA10276327	Not knowing what a Zoner is, this is what I came up with. (My google search for a definition did nt help either...lol)    The streets were empty, save for a few roadrunners and lizards (1) which is as it should be.  The SuperBowl Commercials were about to begin.  Listening to the announcer, we heard, Pepsi has taken an early lead with its 3-D ads....Coke will go into the second half behind.  Its incredible folks, the economy has hit the SuperAds.  Just look at those pitches for Salmon flavored chewing gum and Poptarts.(2).  Those good ole days are gone, when we would see a Clydesdale Team lining up against Mustangs. Now we have to settle for seeing a horse join a circus.  I ask you, Where is the pride?    Chaos broke out in the sports bar when (3) the ads were interrupted for a replay of a touchdown pass.  Fortunately the barkeep had the presence of mind to play a prerecorded godaddy.com ad from 2008. By the time it was over a new godaddy.com commercial was in play.  This one was really, and literally steamy. So much so that everyone wanted to take a shower, when it was done. ( It was only a week later that Procter and Gambel announced it had successfully placed subliminal spots within the godaddy spot.)    As the second half begins, Coke is making a mighty comeback with its variation of the classic,  "Mean Joe Greene" commercial from 1980.  It was a hit once.  Will it be again after 30 years? Only sales will tell.  Coke only has 2 ads this year.  Will it be enough?      In the name of all that is holy, please stop (4) said the pastor, who was concerned about the lack of a TV in the Mens Room.  But the ads ran on, despite his plea. It would seem that the length of the game is not directly related to the endurance of the human bladder (5)

aGRJ6MPdaa	I would say choose ONE main point that you want your audience to glean from your speech, then expound upon that a little to fill in the rest of the time. Give a short intro to pique curiosity, then introduce the main point and a few supporting statements, then a short, solid conclusion.    What are your speeches about?|`|V6XVLbaGaa	outline your speech, intro and main topic first, then several bullet points of information that supports your main topic.  then, round out your bullet points iwth as much information as time allows, then wrap it up with a finish that summarizes.    give your speech several times in front of hte mirror and make sure you use a timer to see the time allotted allows all your information or if you need to flesh it out further.  Plus, give yourself time to breathe and make connection with your audience.      Good luck, it's really fun once you get used to it!

lZ9QgZL4aa	Each scholarship has different rules about it but some friends of mine in college told me that they have valuable information regarding scholarships from this place.   Good luck|`|Uy8ntukjaa	fastweb.com
QLthbgULaa	For the most part, the schools that will offer you the best scholarships are going to be the 3rd and 4th tier schools...because they know they need to offer financial incentives to attract top students.    Tier one schools are going to be more likely to have scholarships with a separate application process.     Top ten schools, like the ones you have mentioned, are incredibly competitive and they know they're hot stuff...they don't need to offer students a lot of money to get them to attend.    If you go to chiashu.com, they have a law school section. From there you can look at different schools to which you are considering applying and it will show you the GPA and LSAT of the people who have been accepted/rejected there and also how much money they received. It's such a useful tool in the law school application process.    Good luck with the rest of your undergrad and law school application process! :]|`|eyiot3mmaa	From what I've heard Fordham University has a great law school its in Licoln Center, Manhattan which is right in the heart of a lot of major corporate firms and internship opportunities.

7igxiGrAaa	You need to isolate the M first. Subtract 8 from the left side of the equation to leave just the M/5. So -14-8= -22. The equation would then look like -22 = M/5. Multiply the left side to get the M on it's own. -22*5 = -110.|`|MuKNUlSraa	add -8 to other side so the equatiuon will look like: -22= m/5  then multiply both sides by 5:  -110= m  so m is equal to -110|`|D9D8Ezybaa	umm seriously? its m= -110    14-8 = -22  -22=m/5  -22*5=-110  -110=m|`|ivbnPxSKaa	-14=8+m/5  -22=m/5  thats all i got|`|cIZ6kfYWaa	subtract 8 from -14. then multiply that by 5.

Start with 8.    Subtract it from both sides because it is a positive number.    This gives you -14-8 on the left and m/5 on the right.    then, because you are dividing m by 5, you need to multiply both sides by 5.    so this gives you (-14-8) x 5 = m    once you do the math on the left, you with have your answer as to what m equals    remember, add/subtract and divide/multiply BOTH sides when you do a problem, and the key is to get all the numbers on one side and all the letters on the other side of the equal sign.|`|62eNg4rMaa	m/5 is the same as saying one fifth m  so, then subtract 8 from one side and then from the other side  so now its: -22=one fifth m  then divide then multiple both sides by the reciprocal so 5/1  so then the answer is m=-110    hope this helps!|`|64491cf5ed73ad038115b2f4040d2213aa	to solve, you need to separate the equation so that the variable (in this case m) is the only thing on one side of the equation.      Think of each equation as a balancing scale - whatever you do to one side you have to do to the other so both sides will always stay equal.  (Just like if you have 1 block on each side of a balance scale, you could add 2 more to each side and it would still balance)      -14 = 8 + m/5  first subtract 8 from each side and simplify  -14 (- 8) = 8 ( - 8) + m/5  -22 = 0 + m/5  -22 = m/5    next multiply each side by 5 so you can get rid of the divisor  -22 (x5)  = m/5 (x5)  -110 = m|`|TkLtMvQWaa	8+m/5=-14  -14-8=-22*5=-110  -110/5=-22+8=-14    m=-22
TAp5yWx6aa	a lawyer is a great profession, however it limits how creative you can be. you seem like a very creative person.

7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	Let the kids bring in magazines and trade them. Let them find an article they think is interesting and write about why they think it is interesting or if they are a more mature group you could have them explain why it is important in society. Another idea is to have them make a collage with things that have to do with a certain subject, like a collage all about school or business. Have them make their own newspaper and decide what to put in it. Younger groups can do a thing like highlights did "Our Own Pages" and the older kids could do comic strips or assign columns like Fashion, Sports, maybe even a history column about things that happened at the school.    EDIT: The person above me gave me an idea. You could have the kids make their own timeline of events for the year they were born or let them pick a year to make a timeline and tell why they chose that year. That could be fun for them. They can use the internet to find older articles and pictures.|`|ORonhAuvaa	Have a newspaper scavenger hunt. Get a piece of poster board for each student. On the poster board, have something they have to find and cut out of the newspaper, leaving room to paste an article on the paper. Use stuff like an obituary, an editorial, table of contents, ad for meat, weather report, classified ad for a car, a recipe, article on a sport, headline, Dow Jones average or what ever you look through and find that you think they need to know. It is great for teaching the parts of a newspaper or where things are in the newspaper.    Kids that finish the scavenger hunt get a prize. You can also use teams of three to four.|`|9bqtCqgDaa	maybe u  can  use mags that relate to the students. or say the person that has the best work get a prize or something..  i dunno.     depends on ages of students    good luck with it|`|pcI9uv0caa	it depends what age group your going towards  the best would probably be hands on   to have students bring in newspapers and magazines  and let them sort them and discuss why.|`|AA11715479	I teach jr. high special ed. and I create a weekly newspaper scavenger hunt for my students. They have to look for specific names in a story, or find a story about a specific subject or maybe a quote. Sometimes it is individual and sometimes it's in teams. We usually have a little prize. They love it.|`|kdSuwt8paa	What about letting them go through a magazine to find the silliest and the most important piece of information, then doing the same with a newspaper and compare the results.   (They would need serious and frivolous magazines.) You could also make them think about how long the information might even be current.   (An article in National Geographic might be just as true in ten years.    An article in a celebrity or fashion magazine might be out of date next week.   And in the paper today's paper is tomorrow's puppy training mat, but what is written on it could be whatever it was on 9/12.)    It would actually be interesting to give some of them rather old papers and magazines.  They could vote on each others findings - especially in the silly and funny categories.  Not only will it be fun but it will make them really study the paper and the magazines.  (I have actually saved one or two papers and magazines which carried particular stories.    It might be worth seeing if the children have anything like that at home.    Even old newspaper lining drawers is fascinating when you find it years later!

Medically school is a huge commitment and it takes a long time to establish yourself in the profession.

KakvKSESaa	Vocaloid is a singing synthesizer application software developed by the Yamaha Corporation that enables users to synthesize singing by just typing in lyrics and melody.      The Character Vocal Series is a computer music program that synthesizes singing in Japanese. Developed by Crypton Future Media, it utilizes Yamaha's Vocaloid2 technology with specially recorded vocals of voice actors. To create a song, the user must input the melody and lyrics. A piano roll type interface is used to input the melody and the lyrics can be entered on each note. The software can change the stress of the pronunciations, add effects such as vibrato, or change the dynamics and tone of the voice.      [it's not an anime as much as an electronic karaoke game set to anime.]
ocZRwW7waa	i have a few suggestions which you could try  ~people say that listening to classical music such as mozart can help  ~give yourself a reward once you complete a certain amount of home work   eg. after 1 hour have 1/2 hour time of whatever you want to do  (but make sure you go back to your work after!!)   ~i have also heard that chewing gum can help you concentrate  ~make sure everything that may distract you is off or out of the room.  eg. computers radios and tvs are off  i hope those tips help|`|SjNpWwSfaa	Sit in my room, Pull the TV plug out, Put books and homework in front of me, and lock the door.|`|btghmpQhaa	well you can put some oldies on so you don't get distracted and then you can get through studying better and stop listening to the weird oldies music
AA11604732	With a GPA around 3.4 and a decent SAT, you can get into lots of good colleges.  The elite schools are unlikely.

Have you ever met someone who you have prejudged based on their appearance and then after meeting them changed your opinions of them?  How did this affect you?

Good luck!|`|TAp5yWx6aa	have you traveled abroad, or had any community involvement?   if so, you can write about the effect it had on you, and how it made you appreciate your life and how you now view others based on what you learned. try to draw from a first hand experience.    good luck.
jYfC8Yyjaa	It's just another way to say lol.  ROFL means rolling on floor, laughing.  You pronounce the word "roffle-copter".  A similar word is "lollerskates" or "lollerskaters".    I am also one of those nerds that say "lol' and "roflcopter" in real life :D|`|y1Mz2mkAaa	ROFL, stands for "Rolling On Floor Laughing", and usually when they say ROFLCOPTER, they just mean that what you just said, was funny.
Jn7bt3JTaa	Drop it and take it as as summer course that way you attend the class every day(stay in practice) and its Over quicker. Absolutely sign up for any tutoring you need. Algebra is a *****. Take as many classes you dread as summer courses as possible.     Think of it as a band aid you are dreading to take off so you do it quickly.      Best advise I ever got it worked for me.|`|E5mFWOqqaa	My question in return is how did you graduate high school if you never took Algebra? Even in the 47th best state out of 50 (Florida), you have to take Algebra to graduate.     Only advice would be to find a tutor. You are struggling so you need some extra help.|`|LZXax4KUaa	get tutoring|`|tVkH44yuaa	get a tutor?|`|8657bab9888895b0dcc325c9f352566daa	get a tutor and spend lots of time practicing|`|xlOpuRNRaa	Many colleges have math lab tutors and teaching assistants with office hours.  They're a great resource, because many of the students who TA have probably had some of the same problems and concerns as you're having now, albeit possibly with other math topics.  I'd also consider going to speak with your professor if you need help.  They should be able to guide you with your algebra, or at least let you know about some valuable resources on campus! :-)
DCQc92Tiaa	I began to play the flute in primary school, but halfway through high school decided that I wanted to play a second instrument, the clarinet. I picked up a beginners book and looked for finger charts on the internet, as well as talking to people who play the clarinet. From there I taught myself. I also found playing in a band was helpful because you are constantly getting practise and more music, as well as advice from other musicians.    It will take you awhile to get the hang of it, but it is definitely possible!|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Yes, but depending on the instrument, it might be a bad idea.  If you can get a sound out of a wind or brass instrument that way, you might as well go for it - piano as well.  But a string instrument?  Much easier to pick up bad habits, not realize your intonation is bad or you're out of tune, holding the bow wrong, etc.  You're better off taking at least a few lessons before teaching yourself from there.
VCIZJQCJaa	you may want to know this info.and attend the college of your dreams. it is located in north carolina(home of nascar) it's called lee college of engineering at university of carolina.-complete motor sports racing program.it teaches engine design, aerodynamics of race cars,suspension(all phases of racing,including great communications skills program) you can earn a p.h.d. there if you want.the nascar teams do affiliate with this college,and many  students who want to work nascar go here.their   is 704-687-8345.this school is the best in the u.s.a.but a well kept secret.|`|haExfFegaa	I say A&M because i am currently an engineering major there and we have a very good program! Also College Station is really badass too!!! I can guarantee you that you will love it!
SX8z9Zg0aa	Honestly, I am biased towards A&M, but they both have very solid engineering programs.  Pretty soon you'll have a longhorn come on here oozing arrogance and preaching how you'll "never fit in at A&M," but I hope you at least go visit.  My time at Texas was a lot less accepting than my time at A&M.
CgOs2ViPaa	yes, you can take the psat junior year for national merit.    well if you want to study for SAT, you're pretty much studying for PSAT too. i would suggest taking a practice SAT test and seeing what your weakest points are, then focus on those. And afterwards, then take another practice test. and so on so forth. i mean, theres no point in studying for math if you're really good at math and bombing the cr section. so yeah, thats what i would do.    and SAT 2? typically you take those in the end of junior year as most of the SAT 2s correspond with classes you can take your junior year (APUSH = US History SAT 2, AP Bio = Bio E/M SAT 2, etc.) Your classes should be sufficient practice for SAT 2's if you are taking AP courses and doing well in them. Otherwise, get one of those study books like barrons and practice.     as for ACT I would suggest taking the PLAN first (its like the ACT version of a PSAT) and see how well you do on that.     Study books for SAT = the hugeass blue collegeboard book for practice tests, which can be found at barnes and noble or most book stores.|`|f8c5c19cb27ce51454af3ecf7d02fe43aa	the SAT sucks!    i hate it.    u should turn mean:  http://www.beingmean.webs.com|`|2FsNdcXEaa	Hey, I'm a sophomore too, and I was wondering the same thing. I talked to some of my junior friends today and I think I'm going to take it in November, so if I don't like my score I have plenty of time to try again. I'm going to start studying before school starts, probably the beginning of August.|`|3SuUQvsYaa	you dont really have to study for the psat its the practice sat.    take the other tests your  junior year and your school might have a class that you can take, if not then you can probably search some on google.|`|zYAPmyCYaa	the SATs were really easy. i didn't take any classes to study, nor did i touch a book. i got a 1250 [out of the 1600 part]. just go to borders or a local book store and ask about SAT books if yo really want to.  and you can take the SATs as many times as you want, and they'll combine your best scores. say you did well on the reading but terrible on the math one time, if you did terrible on the reading the next time and well on the math next time, they'd remember that you did well on each one.
8W2Yx240aa	look over at him and smile... then we would both start laughing at each other ( like a really uber random moment only old friends share )|`|Po4Lljjwaa	I'd ask him, "How did you DO that!?!"|`|hqjJV70Eaa	Say hi and wonder how the he** he did that.|`|5aJ7t4hJaa	Robert Pattin-son?!?  WHO IZ DAT?!?    I *think* that I would *Freek-Out*!!
itlP6rn0aa	they have sample tests, (go to the bookstore),  that are great in preparing you for the real thing.    They have books that explain all about how to take the tests, certain strategies, and etc... buy the "how to take the SAT "  (or similar title )book in print and read it and take the sample tests..|`|JzEn3Kiaaa	To save time don't read the instructions before each section. They are common sense and never change. Review basic english grammar laws. Review geometry equations for math. That's about it. Good Luck. Oh, in english if you are unsure always choose the answer with the least amount of words. It works. Trust me. I got a 31 on the ACT.
X5Qzk78maa	no chance at all, they would see 3.10 and not look at anything else after that. unless u grew up as some starving child in kenya of course. otherwise good luck getting into state schools if u can.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Yes, people do get perfect scores on the SAT every year.  And some of them still get turned down by the top schools.  While a perfect score would tell Berkeley that you're smart, your GPA tells them you're lazy.  And they will have no reason to think you won't be lazy in college as well.  Sorry, it's not too likely unless you have something else really amazing going for you.  But there are tons of good schools out there besides the very top schools.|`|f8c5c19cb27ce51454af3ecf7d02fe43aa	are u kidding?    u need an awesom extra curricular or something special (such as being an A-list actor, being an heir, being a yound entrpreneur, etc.)    u gotta be special    just turn mean:  http://www.beingmean.webs.com|`|CgOs2ViPaa	probably not, unless you have some ridiculously amazing ECs    ECs = extra curriculars
I7qHLCQqaa	Frankly, your chances of going to the NFL are very slim, as you know. Play football for fun and to compete, but dont rely on it for a career.     As for the law degree, Harvard and Yale lawyers are politicians and diplomats. Believe it or not, they are the "NFL" of schools so to speak, and law is their game. Law students their are sharks, and are the sharpest society has to offer. If you think you have what it takes, by all means pursue it.     If you have a shot at getting into any of those schools you need to embrace it. An education for those schools will have people fighting over you, trust me.     Also, your very young, keep an open mind about what you want to do as far as a career, and make sure you explore a diverse set of disciplines.     My answer is Harvard for law. Harvard lawyers are the next "rulers of the world" according to Susan Estrich, a renoun lawyer/broadcaster for a major cable network, and former Harvard law professor.     However if you dont settle on law, which is very likely because you are young, engineering, medicine, business, and journalism are all worthy disciplines to consider, and Yale Texes Tech, and Notre Dame will all do just fine--better than most of other schools in the country.|`|EiIMUdTYaa	I'm a student at TECH, even if you are a very good football player the chances of you entering the NFL are slim.  Remember that there are thousands of NCAA football players out there and only a very small percent of them make it to the NFL.  Even then another very small percentage stay there, many are let go.  If you are as smart as you say you are then I'd try to get into an Ivy league school.  Just remember that it takes more than just good grades to get into a really good school.|`|nB3JH2Wjaa	Harvard|`|FkAaAHOlaa	we need to know a little more: do you have a high gpa (close to 4.0), high SAT scores (like super genius high), volunteer activities, extracurriculars other than football if you do then you have a chance at harvard and yale  otherwise stick to your football dreams|`|IHowy91naa	Most college players don't make it to the NFL. Choose Harvard or Yale, they'll set you up for life and they do send some to the NFL.

RhkdnHPVaa	If you are not too fat don't "sweat" over it (pun intended)  Instead set some long term goals.  ex.  Do you really need that 2nd glass of coke?   slowly cut out junk food and throw in a bit of excercise.  starving yourself is not healthy.    Also high school is not as bad as you think,so chill  I should know I'm in grade 9  just be yourself and don't try change yourself for others|`|oclvWDzPaa	eat normally and juist exercise.... trust me... you will look way skinner just from natural causes in 1 year or less.    SUGGESTION  try track--|`|WRBkRpaOaa	eat salad and fruit and only drink water bike ride of jog everyday   that isn't a diet it is just how people should eat it is healthy  it will taste good too  good luck|`|vECL7f9uaa	well, eating healthy is great so keep that up, but to get in the best shape add excercise of course.  Try to consistenly run at least once or twice each week, 1-3 miles is best.  And for training muscles it is best, if u dont wanna get bulky and gross, Train mostly with ur own body weight. Situps, crunches, pullups, and push-ups.  Also use a wieght that is good for u consistently and dont try to get heavier weights.  And lastly dont focus too much on how u look, its not that big a deal|`|HcvfWYkNaa	Woah woah.    First thing.. STOP.     Don't think about losing weight if you want to get in good shape... because losing weight isn't what getting in good shape is about.     Annd AAANDDD.. just because you're entering high school doesn't mean you should have to transform yourself.     Whatever, anyways..  Don't just eat ONLY fruits. Yes veggies and fruits are are healthy but you need to eat other things such as breads and meats and everything that's on the food pyramid to help nourish your body and to be healthy. Just don't eat SO much of it.     You need to exercise everyday or at least every other day, whether it be running, speed walking or jogging.     There is no such thing as  a HEALTHY quick result. This stuff takes time.|`|Cw51s5uQaa	your too young to be worrying like that. if your doctor says your healthy..then your healthy. 5 pounds is A LOT for just a week.|`|uE8FyJijaa	that is a dangerous diet.  you need a good mix of foods.  refer to mypyramid.gov  just minimize your "junk food" and fatty foods.  Eat more whole grains/wheats instead of white breads.  try eating about 5 smaller meals per day.  You should especially never try starving yourself.  You will just end up eating a whole lot more in one meal which will stack on the pounds.  Most of all, just stay active.  You're young.  You should be able to play a sport of your liking and keep the pounds off.  And avoid sitting in front of the TV/video games.  Find more active hobbies and surround yourself with people who enjoy those hobbies, as well.

9ed48e03128fadf6393931a15386538daa	Ok sweetheart, lets look at a way to make this easier. Get the book out, then get a big piece of paper and a pencil. Starting with the first page make a bullet point list of the most important thing to remember. Do this for all the chapters.     Just writing this stuff down will help you remember the info.

Try having your parents test you, or look up practice questions online.|`|pVpN9Kbuaa	Dont go on reading the books try understand it in practically on road you don't need theory only practical is important. Ask your friends who have passed this exam what type of question will be asked and tell about your situation might be they can give you brief description.|`|QYXij5Wcaa	My best advice for you is to take it easy. Remember, you still have as much time as you need to get your permit. Also, rather than study remember to eat all your meals, especially breakfast. A good night sleep would also be helpful. Don't cram. If you can recite the book then a 10 minute study, the afternoon before would be good enough. Also, realize that this test is written by foreigners, so the language and answers would be off to our standards and values. Also take your time! You have more than plenty enough time to finish the test.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	To apply to any med school, you need a 4-year college degree and to have taken the premed courses in bio, chem, physics and math.  The respiratory care program is a professional training program, not a typical premed path - it's training you for a specific job they then expect you to go do.  Most premed students will major in something that gives them useful background for med school - bio, chem, or some other subject.  It's not like you'd really be able to hold down a job in that field while attending med school, and I'm not sure it would really prepare you for med school.  Talk to your academic adviser about your plan.|`|stWeoWEzaa	I don't go to Harvard, but my brother did and enrolled in the medical program.

First you need to think about what she likes.  Depending on who she is, what she likes, and what is special to her personally that could vary.  If she wears some certain type of clothing you might buy her an accessory like a scarf, braoch or jewelry.  That is something she would enjoy and recall you each time she saw it or put it on.  If she likes to do something like hike or outdoor things you could buy her something like a walking stick, or something to take with her on those outings.  I had a teacher that collected frogs, so I got her a frog pin to wear on her collar or coat, it was lovely.

O87D6zUCaa	You're correct, the answer is D.    Reason:  Saving money has no connection to raising productivity nor does it raise income.  Spending money would raise productivity as it would create a demand for goods and services which would fuel production.  Saving money is not the same as increasing income.

They will be most tuned in to what a good personal statement looks like.  Every school is a little different.  Make sure you clearly state how you expect to benefit from the program and highlight your past experience and where you hope to head- pick a direction even if you're not really sure yet.  They like to see you've thought a lot about it and know you're career minded.|`|8YYwdccpaa	I agree with the first answerer. In addition, go to the Career/Job center for your school. They will assist you with resumes and cover letters and those sorts of materials, and they will have examples and references to help you figure out what you want do say and how to organize it.    You'll need references from at least one of your professors when you apply for grad school. Ask the professor for advice also. He or she will probably want to see your resume at the time a reference letter is being written, so politely asking for help with it is reasonable.    There's no reason you can't do this yourself using the above resources. It is definitely cost effective -- it is free except for putting in some effort. If a professor really goes above and beyond in helping you, a simple written thank you is always appreciated (handwritten is even more meaningful than email.)    Good luck!|`|GbLmBcIoaa	You'd do better to have your friends edit it and make suggestions for how better to "sell" you, unless none of them are adept at language.

8oCwrIR2aa	Ahhh... no. Clearly the context is not some organization of the present but rather this as a definition of our form of national government!    "Representative democracy" is the system of government in which every member of the democracy is held to have a voice, but the actual decisions are made by the literal voices of a few who represent the voices of the whole.    That is simpler than it sounds. The problem is this: after you have so many people, it becomes so absolutely hard to run things when every last single one has to be given a chance to participate directly in every decision.    Just how many is "so many people"? It differs for each situation. For a baseball team, things begin to break down when the pitcher refuses to follow the guidance of his catcher. Toss in the catcher looking to the coach in the dugout now and then for guidance, and it becomes almost too hard to manage. If the pitcher then looked to the pitching coach, and his wife and brother in the crowd, and maybe to a trusted fan in left field seating... well, it would be many participating but the system would no longer be workable. But running a small village of 400 people might work for most things if they require a minimum of 130 people attend meetings at which decisions are made. Even if all 130 people demanded to speak, or even 392 if 392 people showed up, it would still be (very, very barely) doable. But how could 4,000,000 people ever directly participate in all decisions they wished to?    The founding fathers faced that. The government has to, perhaps, consider a decision about a tax. Do all 4,000,000 people have to come together and listen to every speaker on the matter? Just, say, 1,300,000 of them? Can they stay home, but the government send people to find every single one of them and, if each one wants to, have the finders speak all the arguments to date? And keep going back to speak newer arguments people come up with? Or just start accepting some won't get a chance to participate?    Their solution was an old one. Better implemented, we think (we're right by the way!), than before (though maybe no longer?). The idea is to have a group of people chosen by the people to be represented who will then represent their interests in a "level above" them, so to speak. So you don't speak directly to voters about laws for abortion or defense or welfare spending, you speak to your (and anyone else's) representative. That person presumably takes your opinion and arguments into account with his own and others he's heard when considering further action he might take on a subject. That action could be any part of the process: introducing a bill, burying one in committee, voting for or against one, and so on.    But he does it, not you or other voters in the district he represents. You affect him, usually through some fear he might have of not being re-elected (but often through money via lobbyists or bribes  remember, Adams pointed out we aren't angels, eh?), but HE votes on the actual bills, never you. So you have democracy, and a real (sort of) voice in all things, but the actual work of governing is done by an exceedingly small number of people.    There are many variations in the system around the world. In the old Soviet Union they had a 6,000 person body at the first level which chose about 4-500 members of it to be a smaller body that gave it work to do, and picked a much smaller body of 13-20 or so to give it guidance and tasks. In truth, the top dogs picked that group who picked the middle group who saw to it that all 6,000 directly voted for members were the picked group. All.    But it would have been an interesting approach in an actual democracy, not the dictatorship they really had. 6,000 representatives means much smaller voting localities and so much different collections of concerns for each of the 6,000. Who knows? Might've been better than our system. Maybe not.    Good luck!|`|fhET9Awpaa	"Representative Democracy in America: Voices of the People is a national project designed to reinvigorate and educate Americans on the critical relationship between government and the people it serves.

These usually have to do with talent -- like a writing contest or a sports-related one. Some are service-based or based on the best 'write about a time you overcame adversity' story. There's one called 'A GPA Isn't Everything'. And there are some based entirely on need.    Skip Fastwebs.

9erSLvYMaa	Undergrad research takes a lot of forms and it all depends on how advanced you are, how dedicated you are, and there can be a bit of luck involved as well. "Research experience" can include anything from just volunteering to do work in a lab to publishing your own research. To answer your questions in order:    1. Contacting a professor is one of the ways, and perhaps the most common way, to get involved in research. Other ways include participating in an undergrad research program (your college probably offers one or two programs, at least one of which is bound to be a summer internship). Other ways include federal work study positions, commercial lab internships, federal government internships, and other undergrad research programs.    When contacting a professor you need to do several things to ensure your highest chance of success. First is you need to pick out a professor whose research interests match your own (though it's more important that your professor is respected although finding out a professor/lab's reputation can be challenging). Then you should read some of their published articles from the last 2-3 years. When writing them make sure to mention that you've read some of their research (be specific), you find what they do interesting, you'd be interested in learning some techniques that they use in their lab (if this applies to you), tell them your interests, your GPA, any previous relevant experience you have, and that you'd be interested in volunteering in their lab. Be aware that you may need to go through several professors before finding one who will take you in. Not all professors accept undergrads in their labs and those who do usually don't take in too many (undergrads are a burden since they need to be trained and taught everything).    I myself got into my first lab that way. My second lab I got into via work study which was more like applying for a job (since it is technically a job).    2. When starting out you'll usually just help the professor with their experiments. Often you'll get stuck doing grunt work like washing petri dishes and entering data into a computer for the first few months. Eventually the professor may ask you if you'd like to do a project for the lab which you should definitely agree to do. Other times you may come up with an idea of your own and assuming that it relates to what the lab is already doing the professor may agree to help you with it and be your research mentor. A mentor is basically just whoever guided you through your research and taught you throughout your time in the lab. Sometimes your mentor  will be a grad student (a common case in labs run by very busy professors), while other times it will be a post-doc student or the professor themselves.    3. Start doing research as soon as you can. It's never too early. Most students only get in one year of experience (often during their senior year) so that's the minimum amount you should be aiming to get. To get an advantage over your competition though I'd recommend starting in your junior or sophomore year. This also allows you to get in more of your own novel research and have a better chance at scoring a publication.     If you do end up working on your own project, what you have to do at the end will differ depending on what you're doing it for and your own personal goals (as well as how the experiment(s) turned out). It would be a waste of resources and your time if you didn't do anything after finishing your research, so obviously you'll want to do something. The most common end result by far is a poster presentation at an undergrad research conference. If you do the class for credit you may have to write a paper detailing your progress or results, and perhaps other assignments as well. If you're doing the class for an honors program then your research will culminate with an honors thesis though you can expect to have to churn out a lot more work than just that (proposals, schedules, thesis defense, etc). And if you had a really good project and you got good results then you may just be able to get an article published (whether or not you'll get first, second, third, or worse authorship depends on how much work you did compared to other people on your project and your lab's policies. In most cases undergrads do not get first authorship).     You can get credit for doing research. Most universities offer an independent research class. You can also do it for an honors program. And there's a chance you may get paid for it if you did some sort of internship program. Keep in mind, however, that the ultimate goal of research and what you want out of it above everything else is something impressive to put on your resume when applying to grad/professional schools. Even if you won't get jack squat from doing research, the ability to put down research experience on your resume is invaluable, as is the recommendation letter you will (hopefully) be able to get from your research mentor (which tends to be|`|jN8duTx2aa	Things you can do:  -Email professors whose research interests you and ask if s/he needs interns or volunteers.  -Check in with your career counselling center and see if they have any internships or summer programs to suggest (this is where I would start)  -Look and see if your college has an honor thesis program    No one is going to give a college freshman run of their lab to do their own experiments.  You are not at that level.    Some schools give credit for working with a professor, but usually it is for upperclassmen (I did it my senior year).  In those cases, you write a paper.  Some people also write them as part of a senior thesis.    It is rare for an undergrad to get published and usually when they do it as a third or tenth author on a paper.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	You're not expected to come up with your own research question at this point - you don't know the field, you don't know what's been done and what hasn't, and you don't know what you can do.  Research experience at the undergrad level means working with a professor on their research, either in the lab or outside (if lab doesn't apply to the project).  The earlier you get started, the better.  Try asking your academic adviser who you might approach about getting some research experience this summer.  The professor you work with is your mentor, yes.    Most students spend a few months over the summer on a research project, or maybe during the semester.  Unless it's for credit (many are not) you won't be expected to write up a paper - necessarily.  You might end up on a paper your adviser writes as a co-author, but the chances of you authoring a paper are slim at this point in your career.

You must have any 2 units of English, no matter what (compulsory).    It's great that you have an interest in your future career now - I'm in year 11 now, and last year, I was just like you (or at least a bit like you...I don't know :P) ... for the last year I've been thinking a lot about uni and what I want to do when I'm older.

Some/all of the science subjects include:  Physics  Chemistry  Biology  Senior Science (which includes a bit of everything)  and Earth and Environmental Science.    You won't have to do all of them, but ask your teacher to be sure.  The most important thing is, make sure you're good at science and maths. If you're not, and you really struggle, maybe you should try and pursue a different career path. However, you're still young and you could really improve if your maths/science marks are a bit low.

Also, give the right body language (hand gestures, etc) and do not speak in mono-tones.. Speak clearly and loud enough for your audience to hear you as well.. Maintain good eye contact to your audience too, so that you can keep their attention focused on your presentation.. Rehearse a bit of all your important lines the day before, so that you will be fully prepared on what you want to say for the presentation.. Use proper English (I assume your presentation is going to be in English) with the correct wordings and grammar (I'm sure you've got all these taken care of)..     Oh yeah, since you've got killer presentation slides, try your best not to read "everything" from the slides - or it will kinda defeat the purpose of having killer presentation slides anyway..     Towards the end of your presentation, perhaps you could also present a demo (if relevant) to your audience - it helps them see the practical side of what you've been trying to convey to them earlier.. Make the demo interesting and do it creatively.. =) Your audience will like it..     Finally, do dress well for your big day and all the best for your presentation!|`|AA11537485	i'm not sure if you are in silicon valley, but since ebay is, knowing what's going on locally (real estate, traffic problems and other issues of importance to the employees) may win some brownie points...    also, know ebay's current org chart.  i'll make you look like you know the company inside and out...    good luck

It differentiates to gives rise to a number of tissues and structures including bone, muscle, connective tissue, and the middle layer of the skin. Some cells in mesodermal tissues retain the capacity to differentiate in diverse directions.

AA11422318	Some additional points:    1. Literature is one of the ultimate forms of human expression. What is humanity without a form of communication? Nothing. Literature is a way of communicating to large numbers of people with an appreciation for the written word. It is a form of art.    2. Literature can help people to understand life. How often have you read a book and suddenly realized something about your own life? An example is in "The Necklace" by Guy de Maupassant. The author tells a story about a woman who borrows an expensive necklace and loses it. Instead of facing the shame of telling her friend what has happened, she takes out a loan and spends ten years working to pay off her debt. In the end, she discovers the original necklace was nothing but costume jewelry! The story reminds the reader of the importance of honesty in relationships. Most pieces of literature carry an important theme--a lesson about life the reader can learn.    3. Literature inspires people. Think about famous works of art. Many of them are inspired by the Bible or by classic works such as Homer's Odyssey or Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Films are frequently based on ideas from literature--The Taming of the Shrew inspired the operetta Kiss Me, Kate! as well as the film Ten Things I Hate About You. Numerous allusions to classic literature are found throughout society.    4. Literature evokes the power of the human mind and the imagination. It help builds good critical thinking skills that are useful in all areas of life. The first step to being successful is to become a good reader.|`|AA12303308	A)- the most important goal of literature is that it provides "happiness" to  readers of various cultural backgrounds, exactly as critics states it.  Readers finds it joyful to read tragedy,comedy or any work of fiction even it is of a  tragic theme.    B)- literature sometimes work as a historical chronicle. For example, Shakespeare wrote many historical plays depicting the "real" political and social state of Britain at different periods of time. for example, he wrote " HenryIV", "HenryV", "Henry VI", "Richard II" and many more. Hence, literature can easily show you a piece of your land's history and make it easy for you to learn incidents by heart, instead of learning them from some dull and monotonous history book  ;)    C)- literature provides us with moral values as it  deepens good attitudes inside us. It shows you wrong and right, evil and good and so forth.     hope i was helpful enough , dear ..anytime... x

This is an excellent indicator of competition for the program.  Generally this also indicates which program is the best as many other people will be competiting to get in.  That means the school will have harder working students, which means they will probably be more successful in life, which means more alunni donations, which means the school has more money to spend, which means they can afford to pay the best instructors more than other schools, which usually means that the best and brightest instructors will be there.    This plan doesn't gaurantee 100% accuracy, but definitely narrows things down in terms of probability.
AA12303308	Edward Ricardo Braithwaite is STILL alive, pal..here is his biography:     Dr. Edward Ricardo Braithwaite, is the internationally known author of the bestseller "To Sir With Love," based on the author's experiences as a teacher in a tough section of London. The bestseller book was later made into a popular movie starring Sidney Poiter and whose title song was sung by the 1960s pop star, Lulu. Today, the book is still popular with a new reprint edition along with a release of the movie on DVD.     His early work could be characterized as one of the first reflective memoirs on teaching to receive international attention. This early work is still considered one of the best. Although Dr. Braithwaite has published many other novels and books, "To Sir With Love," remains to be currently cited as containing important tenets relevant to today's youth and our educational institutions.     Dr. Braithwaite has the wisdom and insights on teaching and learning based on 5 decades of classroom teaching. He comes from a family of scholars, with his mother and father both being graduates of Oxford University in History and Engineering. Braithwaite graduated from Cambridge University, Cambridge, England with a specialization in Physics. He also received honorary doctoral degrees from Oxford University and La Sorbonne -University of Paris. He has a long international career. He served as Ambassador to the United Nations for Guyana (4 years), and Guyana's Ambassador to Venezuela (3 years). In addition, Braithwaite was an educational consultant and lecturer for UNESCO in Paris for 5 years.     Dr. Braithwaite also has been on the teaching faculty and served as writer in residence at New York University and Florida State University. He is currently Writer in Residence at Howard University and teaching Honors English. In addition to being busy on his own personal and professional writings, he also publishes Faces and Voices: An Anthology of Student Literature from his honors seminars. Dr. Braitwaite also is on the Board of Trustees of the Krasnow Institute at George Mason University.

(  here she is NOT a dancer BUT she acted like a dancer ).    3- He plays the trick well (as if he was) a magician ( here he is NOT a magician but he acts like a magician).    NOTE** "as if" should always be followed by a PAST simple tense, even in a present sentence. why? because it is just a matter of "pretence" 'cos the subject ONLY ACTS like a dancer or a magician but he/she is not any of this.   ______________________________________...

As if means in a way that suggests something (Oxford Dictionary). E.g. He behaved as if nothing had happened    Meaning: In fact, something had happened, but he behaved in a way that suggests nothing had happened.    Wish means really want something to happen or to be true even though it is impossible (Oxford Dictionary). E.g. I wish I could fly.    Meaning: It is imposibble for a human to fly, but I really want to fly. Therefore, I say I "wish" I could fly.    Hope that explains.

You've got full disclosure requirements, there are limitations on advertising, and there's always the credibility issue.      The question, if I were to ask it of a class, would be designed to see if the class can read a text or research to find two or three points where you've got to be careful when getting corporate clients (as opposed to individual investors or private placement investors) for a mutual fund.      You need a broker-dealer license to sell mutual funds (series 7?  series 63? I can't remember), even if you're a financial institution.    I know that the rules are MUCH less stringent for mutual funds, as opposed to single stock and especially private placements.
