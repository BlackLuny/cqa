20090227034145AA4YhSa	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Can tattoo parlors legally check ID numbers?	Recently, little sister confessed to me that she was stupid enough to have paid for a fake ID to get a tattoo. However, the dumb runt is now freaking out about the possibility of her being in big trouble with the law if she is found out. Although I absolutely do not approve of what she did, I thought I'd ask the question-- Are tattoo/piercing parlors allowed to randomly check driver license/ID numbers against a database or with the police? Or do they have to have strong evidence that it is fake and immediately contact the police? What do they do with the records (she told me they photocopied her ID along with her release forms) and photocopies of IDs -- are they just a formality?      I would hope that if they suspected that she was a minor, they would have refused her service from the beginning, but you never know. And for the record, I am encouraging her to get it checked out to make sure it is healing properly and made her cut up the fake ID.

However, the edges of my tattoo are kinda red. It doesn't hurt as much, though, but I'm worried that it's ruined.  Some parts have peeled also, and the red is now pink. Has it been blurred? My artist said that it will fade while healing, but the redness around the edges is making me paranoid.

I have heard that washing your face with olive oil and salt can help with blackheads, but also that mineral oil is a good moisturizer. I was wondering if it is a good idea to use it instead of olive oil. Has anyone used mineral oil in a home-made face wash before?

My prom is in the beginning of May so i have about 2 months to tan. My mom doesn't really want me to go because she says tanning is bad for you, but if i only go up until prom is it as bad? I would probably only go until I got dark and then go once a week after that to maintain the color. How bad is this??
