However, i have had such a hard time making money for it.   I have a part-time job, but since I run track and go to school, ( and my boss is a dumb alcoholic :X) but I work only like 6 hours a week! And i have to spend it all on gas and whatever!      So I tried selling stuff at school. Some people have sold candy bars and had huge success, but SO many people do that it would be pointless for me to do that!      So I sold random stuff at school like soda, crackers, (haha) and random snakcs. But I have only made less than 20 dollars.         My mom has already paid for the trip, but I would like to alleviate some of the financial pressure on her, since she is a single mother and paying two mortgages.      ANY IDEAS?!
