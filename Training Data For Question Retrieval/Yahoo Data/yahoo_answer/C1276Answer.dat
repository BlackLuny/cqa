SvmZlLdaaa	Lions generally do not see humans as prey. Man-eaters are old or injured individuals who can no longer hunt their natural prey, and have learned that humans are easy to kill. Aside from these (which are rare), lions will usually avoid humans - they may be completely indifferent to people in vehicles, but step out of the vehicle and they will, in the vast majority of cases, retreat. You only really risk attack if the animal thinks you are threatening its young, and even then the lion will mostly mock-charge you before a genuine attack is launched - if you take the hint and back off, it normally won't press the issue.<br>  <br>  If you are confronted by a lion, you can often bluff your way out of it. If you stand still, raise your arms to make yourself appear larger, and shout if it approaches you, you will seem more dangerous than you actually are, deterring the lion from attacking. You should also keep facing the animal, letting it know you have seen it - lions are ambush predators and often give up stalking if they know they've been spotted - but don't stare it directly in the eye, as this is threat behaviour. One thing you should never do is run, because this will make you seem like prey. Few predators can resist chasing something that runs away from them, and once they're in hunting mode they see you as food.<br>  <br>  By the way, most lions live on the open savannahs of Africa, not in jungles, though there is a small population of Asiatic lions in the Gir Forest of India.|`|fvN18yvGaa	You said he was hungry..it wont matter how unafraid u are as he picks hes teeth with ur phalanges|`|De4vgWXPaa	I would imagine the lion would be more interested in getting out of that unsuitable environment, as lions don't happen to live in jungles.|`|Ao0ZyjCraa	Yes it will because the lion doesn't worry whether you are scared or not.

Ykzf9NYgaa	It's mainly because mixture won't drip out of the conical flask - in a beaker, some of the substance will splash out, affecting your measurements.|`|dXatF4x2aa	in this specific acid-base titration while it take place we should mix the titer well by shaking it in order to have homologous solution to assure reaction take place well.In that case it is easier to handle it with a conical flask other than a beaker.
8Y7LQ6TGaa	I can help you with an example of hysteresis in electronics. However, hysteresis loops I believe have a specific meaning in magnetics, so this may not be a good example. But I already typed it...<br>  <br>  If you have a thermostat setup to control a room temperature set at 70F, you have a problem, in that if the temperature is very close to 70, minute air currents can make the temperature of the sensor move back and forth between, for example, 69.9 and 70.1 degrees, making the heating system cycle off and on frequently, which is not good for the system.<br>  <br>  So instead some hysteresis is included. Typically, it works as follows:<br>  <br>  If the temperature is increasing, ie, the system is on, the shut off point is 71F. Once it reaches 71 and shuts off, and starts decreasing, the system will not turn on until the temperature reaches 69F. Thus there is a 2 degree hysteresis that prevents the system from going into rapid cycling.<br>  <br>  <br>  Another example is a comparator setup to detect a voltage level of 1.00 volt and turn on a relay when the voltage is above 1 volt. As above, if the voltage is close to 1.00 volts, random noise on the signal (and there is always some noise on any signal) can cause the relay to chatter back and forth as the comparator detects spikes above and below the set point.<br>  <br>  This is fixed by adding some positive feedback, hysteresis, say 10 mV worth, so it takes 1.01 volts to turn the relay on and 0.99 volts to turn it off.<br>  <br>  .
6D9cWlbcaa	The basis of scientific names for animals and plants is the Latin language.<br>  <br>  Scientists use a naming system which is known as Binomial nomenclature, which is basically giving the animals and plants surnames as well as christian names (or personal names).<br>  <br>  This system of scientific names was proposed and established by Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish biologist, in circa 1758.<br>  <br>  Species are grouped into clans, that is like the family name even though their genus (or surname) may be different. There personal name is the specific name for that species.<br>  <br>  The Genus (or surname) as a general rule starts with a capital letter while the Specific name (or personal name) is written completely in lower case.<br>  <br>  At times the Genus will be abbreviated to the first letter (the capital letter) followed by the Specific name in full, however this is only after the entire name has been written out in full once.<br>  <br>  some scientific names are..<br>  animals-<br>  Northern Lights: Aurora borealis<br>  Humpback Whales: Megaptera novaeangliae<br>  Killer Whales: Orcinus

The suffixes stated in your question are used for naming ionic compounds (formed by metal ion and nonmetal ion or polyatomic ion)<br>  <br>  In these nomenclature system, the name of the metal forming the positive part of the compound does not change. But the name of the nonmetal forming the negative part of the compound changes. The most common ones:<br>  O = oxygen changes to OXIDE (O^2-)<br>  S = sulfur changes to SULFIDE (S^2-)<br>  F = fluorine changes to FLUORIDE (F^1-)<br>  Cl = chlorine changes to CHLORIDE (Cl^1-)<br>  Br = bromine changes to BROMIDE (Br^1-)<br>  I = iodine changes to IODIDE (I^1-)<br>  N = nitrogen changes to NITRIDE (N^3-)<br>  P = phosphorus changes to PHOSPHIDE (P^3-)<br>  C = carbon changes to CARBIDE (C^4-)<br>  <br>  Some examples;<br>  NaF = sodium fluoride<br>  CaCl2 = calcium chloride<br>  Mg3N2 = magnesium nitride<br>  K3P = potassium phosphide<br>  BaBr2 = barium bromide<br>  (NH4)2S = ammonium sulfide<br>  Al2O3 = aluminum oxide<br>  <br>  The suffix (-ATE) is used when a polyatomic ion is present in the negative part of the ionic compound. But there are some polyatomic ions composed of the same nonmetals. For example; NO3^- and NO2^- or PO4^3- and PO3^3-.<br>  To differentiate them, the name of the poly atomic ion having more oxygen atom ends with -ATE, the other one ends with -ITE.<br>  NO3^- = nitrate<br>  NO2^- = nitrite<br>  <br>  PO4^3- = phosphate<br>  PO3^3- = phosphite<br>  <br>  SO4^2- = sulfate<br>  SO3^2- = sulfite<br>  <br>  Buf if there is a single type of polyatomic ion, its name ends with -ATE.<br>  <br>  CO3^2- = carbonate<br>  CH3COO^- = acetate<br>  <br>  Unfortunately there are some exceptions also;<br>  OH^- = hydroxide<br>  CN^- = cyanide<br>  <br>  You must learn the common ones. As you use them you can memorize them. I think this helps for the beginning. Because there are many other forms as;<br>  ClO^- = hypochlorite<br>  ClO2^- = chlorite<br>  ClO3^- = chlorate<br>  ClO4^- = perchlorate"<br>  <br>  (I will not take any credit for this as I copied and pasted it. But sure it will help, and I just want to help)|`|yV1jZkqGaa	basically "ate" is a derivation of anything thats got oxygen in it, or has been oxidised to some extent<br>  <br>  "ide" is the opposite.<br>  <br>  e.g. copper sulphate = CuSO4<br>        copper sulphide = CuS2

8Y7LQ6TGaa	EM fields (or radiation) have a frequency or frequencies that they readiate on, and if one of those frequencies overlap the one you are using, you get interference. For example, if you are listening to AM radio at 560 kHz, and a motor sends out radiation at that frequency, you will hear that as noise in your radio. The stronger the motor radiates, or the closer you are to it, then the more noise you hear, ie, the more interference. <br>  <br>  Noise can be radiated, or broadcast by the device itself, ie, the motor, or by wires or other metalic objects connected to it. So the interference signals from the motor can travel along the power wires and radiate from those.<br>  <br>  A lot of interference, static, is from electric arcs. Whereas direct radiation from things like cell phones, radios, cell towers are on fixed frequencies, ie, the frequencies they are designed to use, or harmonics of those, electric arcs generate frequencies over a very wide range, and it is those that cause the most interference. Arcs can result from commutators and brushes in motors and from mechanical switches or relays. <br>  <br>  .|`|4fWZL4TRaa	Electromagnetic radiation in this case is a form of energy used for radio. A common name is radio waves. It is like light, but has much longer wavelengths. It consists of a magnetic and an electric field travelling together. It is produced each time an electric current changes. It can be seen as waves of energy, or as streams of photons carrying this energy, at the speed of light. Conversely, when this energy encounters a conductor like a piece of wire it induces voltages.<br>  <br>  Interference is caused by any source that causes unwanted energy to enter a device such as a radio receiver. It causes interference when there is enough energy to change the behaviour of the device. With a radio receiver, it may just mean unwanted noise. With radio systems there is a concept called signal to noise.<br>  <br>  If the wanted signal is significantly stronger than the noise the interference may not be a problem. Some types of radio are inherently less prone to interference, like FM radio compared with AM radio. Electrical interference from household sources is less as the frequency goes higher, so it has little effect on mobile phones.<br>  <br>  Interference may be at a certain frequency or range of frequencies, but is sometimes broadband. That means it can have an effect on a wide range of frequencies. Think of lightning, and interference from other spark discharges.<br>  <br>  Conducted interference means interference coming into the device on wires, typically the power wires, but it could be telephone wires, data cables and any other connection, like external loudspeakers. When a light is switched on, there is a disturbance that travels through the power wires, as well as the radiated electromagnetic signal. These are separate paths that the interference can use to enter the device.<br>  <br>  Electromagnetic radiation out of or into a device can be reduced by good design, minimising the energy in fast changing circuits, shields, twisted wires and using short wire lengths. Conducted interference is usually reduced by electrical filters. Conducted interference can also be radiated from the power cables etc.<br>  <br>  Radio jamming is the deliberate use of interference to disrupt communications. This was common during the cold war, but the cost of jamming meant it was quickly discontinued. I expect it is still used on battlefields, particularly to disrupt radar.<br>  <br>  Modern radio systems can be made less prone to jamming, and other kinds of unwanted interference. Broadcast radio and HF radio were more sensitive to interference.<br>  <br>  The link below has an explanation with animations about electromagnetic waves.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  The levels of interference from devices, and the sensitivity of devices to interference are controlled by regulations. This is a kind of pollution, and as human activity increases the effect is likely to increase. Regulations have become more stringent in recent years.

I4ms8wD0aa	Since this is your question, I'm assuming that you have a broad idea of cloning--that is, you both know its benefits, disadvantages and consequences. Also, I assume that your good and bad is the same as right and wrong. Because for me it doesn't matter whether it is bad or good just as long that is right.<br>      <br>      If we reason that cloning is unnatural therefore it is bad/wrong then can we say that Cesarean operation is also bad/wrong since it is not the natural way of giving birth? Before we consider something to be bad/wrong or not, we must consider the "ends" and the "means". I'm not saying that the "end justifies the means" since it is not always right. Evaluating the technology of cloning, we must answer this question: Do we accept the technology cloning as a universally acceptable method in science--that is, all species are allowed to be cloned without exception? If you have answered yes to this question then for you it is good/right;  if you answered no then it is bad/wrong. If ever you have answered yes, we must also evaluate the "end" and the purpose. If our intention of using this technology is for our sole benefit we must consider its affect to other people or species: are we neglecting the rights of other life or are we sacrificing the happiness/right of other life? Not until this questions are answered and the reasons are satisfied, we must put temporarily, if not permanent, cloning to a halt.|`|6t76bgS3aa	I'd say bad, I don't want there to be another Nathan|`|Ddd8LDPGaa	good...can get body parts of them,, like heart, liver, kidney cloning....makes you live longer|`|FHbBO0rfaa	I think it is both good and bad. With cloning we open so many more avenues to creating cures for illnesses and solving other medical illnesses. However, if cloning is taken advantage some very horrible things might happen. For example, I heard about a movie and it was about clones which where made for each person, when the actual person became sick and needed an organ, they just killed the clone and took the organ. Also, with cloning people may selectively alter and modify characteristics. This can be a good thing because it could allow us to remove diseases like cancer and so on and prevent it from being passed on. However, people may use the selective modification of DNA to enhance themselves [ ie. they may make themselves smarter, more beautiful, very strong ect.] If something like that happened, we would eventually set a standard which said that everyone had to be a particular way; perfected through DNA manipulation. If this was the case, people who weren't genetically modified and had minor defects [eg wearing glasses] would be otracised by community.|`|NCvvwPEdaa	Definately bad, first of all it increases population and that also not natural. We have to accept what nature has made for us and we have to follow it. Cloning is just not happening for humans, yes it can be for animals but not much and not for humans.|`|SZZkfVzbaa	It's stealing someones identity, and swapping it with someone elses.

zFsTSrOcaa	You can get started right out of the box.  If the software lets you print out sky maps, you don't need a star atlas.  However, since the scope is noncomputerized, you will need to know how to locate your targets.  You will probably want at least one more higher-magnification eyepiece (shorter focal length eyepiece = higher magnification) and possibly a low-magnification 2" eyepiece to get the best possible wide-field views.  You don't need filters unless your sky is severely light-polluted.<br>  <br>  Out of the box, you'll be able to see some detail on the moon.  The planets may be disappointing without more magnification, but Jupiter's belts and Saturn's rings should be easy.

This can be implemented in analogue electronic hardware or software. This corrects for the delay in heating the water when the heater is switched on, and the delay in the temperature sensor when responding to the temperature. A whole new subject.<br>  <br>  Have fun..

QPWjtDzcaa	I'm not so sure there would be a necessity for hostility.  Of course, this is pure speculation, but essentially, if they have mastered interstellar travel, there wouldn't be much of a need to "fight for resources" or for survival, as there are many worlds to explore and potentially "harvest" for raw materials, and (deeper speculation) to colonize.  <br>  <br>  There are other ways that (on this planet anyway) where hostility does come into play.  Territoriality, jealousy, theistic background, and philosophical topics can pave the way for disagreements that turn into hostile situations.  But I think with inter stellar travelers, the key component to hostility is voided out due to the vastness of space.  <br>  <br>  Then again, perhaps extra terrestrial beings somewhere out there are a natural "war-like" species, or naturally hostile, or natural conquerors.  Since we only have life on earth to base this on, it is a very hypothetical question and purely made up of conjecture at this point.|`|vxSXsn59aa	You need to stop getting your ideas regarding aliens from Hollywood.

Why waste the time and energy destroying the inhabited ones?<br>  It's very likely that a star-faring race would not be nearly so bellicose as ours is, because if they were, they would probably have destroyed themselves before developing star travel, as we almost certainly will. <br>  You shouldn't assume that alien psychology would be even remotely similar to human psychology.

GsV67vUNaa	The course is interesting. But I'll warn you that your first term at university will feel like you are being repeatedly kicked in the face. (Mainly because you drank FAR too much in Fresher's Week, but also because it's a completely different ball game to school).<br>  <br>  It's not that hard a life (definitely not like the old days, and it's getting better every year).<br>  <br>  I think it's worth going into medicine. Although you should never take a half-hearted approach to this, as you may very well drop out within a few weeks.<br>  <br>  You don't NEED any passions or interests. So don't pick something up just for the sake of doing it. You need to have things that you want to do. For example, a lot of people did the Duke Of Edinburgh Award without being really enthusiastic about it (including me).<br>  <br>  Being a GP is being a doctor (admittedly, on the whole a better paid doctor with better hours) but it is a doctor nonetheless.|`|1sVRQTsbaa	Firstly it doesnt matter if you are squeemish i was and i am now a fully trained psychiatric nurse, i hated needles and now i give about 3-4 per day!! so really you do get over it, <br>  <br>  you do not have to go into surgery or GP work anyway youcould do psychciatry!!!<br>  <br>  Helping people should be your main interest, but it is not an easy job to take on, the money is good yes but the hours are long the work is hard so you do have to work for the  money!!!!<br>  <br>  if you are clever enough though i would do it if i was you!! it is good that you have ambitions!!<br>  <br>  A GP is a general practitioner who works in a normal drs surgery, it is exactly the same as every other doctor, you just speciallise in different things IE psychiatry, surgery etc....<br>  <br>  i hope this helps you. have you been to many university intake days because there should be people on hand to help you decide!!<br>  <br>  itis a 7 year course though so be prepared for some hard work haha xxxx|`|gqpJLNk4aa	yes<br>  yes<br>  yes<br>  helping people<br>  a gp is a doctor, you do not need to be in ER or A and E you can specialize in physchiatry or broken bones|`|QWN8KNCPaa	to be a doctor you must first decide if this i what you want to do,you cant have a half hearted approach to it,your reasons for wanting to be a doctor are not the right ones<br>  the course is interesting if you want to be a doctor<br>  you have to work hard<br>  yes its a very rewarding career<br>  your interest should lie in the wellbeing of people<br>  a gp is a doctor (general practitioner)|`|0wKe8qYUaa	Having a degree in Medicine is not only about the money, but saving lives, and helping people my friend...<br>  <br>  It tends to get harder as you get to the start of year 4 and 5, but it is worth it and is so good for you.|`|15dc330dd70f88a8cc71d777d9410557aa	It isn't for you.

Yes, it is EXTREMELY interesting, but only if your in it for MEDICINE and not for money!<br>  <br>  2. It can be, its less hard more time consuming. If your not constantly studying (medicine is ALWAYS changing and there are always new drugs and protocols which you have to keep up to date with), you have a lot of other medical commitments to deal with such as giving presentations on your latest research project, conducting research, educating medical students, attending conferances and many more.<br>  <br>  3. Depends on why you are doing it. For you...no<br>  <br>  4. You need to be interested in MEDICINE, in helping others but not just helping them and saving lives but providing great care - remember a doctor doesn't just heal the sick, we have to manage departments and have meetings on local healthcare provision etc... You can be the greatest healer the world has seen but if you cannot manage properly, you won't be a good doctor.<br>  <br>  5. A GP IS a doctor. If you mean is a GP better than a hospital specialist then that depends on what YOU want. Nobody is going to be able to answer this question for you, its like asking "which specialty is the best" there is no answer to this.<br>  <br>  finally if your not interested in the clinical and practical stuff of a medical degree than please p**s off! Your truly getting on my nerves, you simply are the worst "prospective" medical student I have come across so far.

T8DThYKHaa	The egg seals the bottle. The burning matches use up the oxygen in the bottle and since oxygen is 1/5 of air a partial vacuum forms in the bottle. As nature abhors a vacuum on earth, the vacuum sucks the egg into the bottle as the pressures try to equalize. <br>  <br>  Ask your teacher why the egg is not squashed by the higher air pressure as it is pushed into the bottle. Ask how the vacuum can suck|`|1nYasMYqaa	I'll take a guess. The internal pressure on the bottle is increased as the temperature inside the bottle goes up. Since the internal pressure is greater than the atmospheric pressure, the glass bottle expands outward. I'm guessing the expansion includes the neck as well.

Think of it this way: a planet speeds up as it gets closer to the Sun, so it moves more slowly when it's farthest from the Sun.<br>  <br>  A helpful analogy is to think of the elliptical orbit as an elliptical pie. You want to produce equal sized pieces of pie by cutting it into pieces with the Sun as the narrow end of each piece. "Equal pieces of pie in equal times." So the perihelion pieces will be wider than the aphelion pieces, which means that the planet has to travel faster close to perihelion.|`|XMXlXu0xaa	I will admit i am not really an expert in this subject, but correct me if i am wrong, if you are further from the sun, the gravitational effect will be decreased, and hence you will move slower relative to the sun. <br>  <br>  So i would say 15km/s out of pure reasoning, as it is the lowest figure.|`|lO0keUAUaa	15 km/s<br>  <br>  A planet on an elliptical orbit moves fastest when it is closest to the Sun and slowest when it is furthest from the Sun.  15 km/s is the only option that is slower than the 20 km/s given as the speed at the average distance (presumably approximately halfway between the closest and furthest).|`|KHSOVxViaa	Angular momentum is conserved.<br>  <br>  This means an orbit sweeps out equal areas in equal times.<br>  <br>  The equation is mvr = constant, where m is the planet's mass, r is the distance, and v is its velocity.<br>  <br>  So, if r is increased from the average (by being at the farthest point), what happens to v...?|`|zvz2Vcolaa	As a planet approaches periastron(The closest approach to its star), its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls|`|J3TGyOnDaa	Use Kepler's laws of planetary motion, particularly the third law.|`|0gaqP4PZaa	do your own homework

Temperature plays an<br>  important role in the development of this insect.<br>  Eggs will hatch at 10- 29 degrees C. At 10 degrees<br>  C it takes the eggs 42 days to hatch, white at 15<br>  degrees C it takes 15 days and at 25degrees C it<br>  takes 6 -7 days. Larvae require a minimum of 80%<br>  relative humidity. Larvae will mature to adults in 5<br>  - 11 weeks depending on temperature and<br>  humidity, although there are reports of larvae<br>  living as long as 133 days and the complete cycle<br>  from egg to adult lasting 235 days. The pupal stage<br>  will generally last 10 - 25 days. The optimum<br>  temperature is 24 -26 degrees C. Development will<br>  continue throughout the winter in heated<br>  environments. This species can have up to 4<br>  generations per year.

2guacbkWaa	Titration is a common laboratory method of quantitative chemical analysis that is used to determine the unknown concentration of a known reactant. Because volume measurements play a key role in titration, it is also known as volumetric analysis.<br>  <br>  The reaction between two chemical substances in this experiment are NaOH and HCl is :<br>  <br>         NaOH + HCl  --> NaCl + H2O or in ionic <br>         OH- + H+      --> H2O<br>  <br>  so in this experiment the titrant (known reactant), HCl, is use to determine the volume needed to neutralized NaOH. Because H+ = OH- so we can use mole concept to determine the concentration of unknown substance, NaOH. By using the equation below<br>  <br>           V1(ml, NaOH) x M1(M, NaOH) = V2(ml, HCl) x M2 (M, HCl)<br>  <br>  so we can find and determine the concentration of NaOH because the volume of NaOH and HCl also concentration of HCl as the titrant.<br>  <br>  So by adding water to the conical flask won't effect the results, because when we doing titration the most important thing is the volume of the known reagent and also water in this experiment doesn't react with other chemical components in the reaction.|`|ossCVxPqaa	In you erlenmeyer flask you have 20ml of NaOH solution. Therefore you have fixed number of moles of NaOH.<br>  If you add distilled water to the flask, this water is totally neutral and it only dilutes the solution. You still have exactly the same number of moles NaOH. When you carry out the titration, the acid you add will  react with the moles of NaOH, not the water. So the addition of extra water makes no difference to the result.

0ENFApaAaa	EM radiation was historically understood as being a wave phenomenon up to the beginning of the last century.  The reason for this is the very clearly demonstrable phenomena of wave interference, which light and radio waves exhibit, and which are strictly interpretable in terms of wave motion.  The wavelength of light and other EM radiation can be very easily determined by techniques which involve interference.<br>  <br>  However, this view was thrown into confusion when Einstein conducted an experiment in which light of different wavelength shines on a material which emits electrons in a vacuum tube (the photoelectric effect).  The energy of the emitted electrons was measured by decelerating them in an electric field.  <br>  <br>  In a wave motion, the energy given up by a wave when it is absorbed is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wave, or to the intensity of the radiation, but not to its wavelength.  However, the photoelectric experiment shows that the energy of EM radiation is not dependent on amplitude or intensity, but is inversely proportional to wavelength.  This was a highly unexpected result, and indicates that em radiation is not simply a wave effect.<br>  <br>  To account for the photoelectric results, the idea was put forward that em radiation can be considered to exhibit wave-particle duality.  This means that in some experiments it behaves like a wave (e.g. interference experiments), while in others (e.g. photoelectric experiments) it behaves like energetic particles (quanta), the energy of each particle (quantum) being inversely proportional to the wavelength as measured in an interference experiment. <br>  <br>   According to the quantum view, the total power  delivered by em radiation is related both to the energy of each quantum, and the rate of arrival of quanta (number per second), but in the photoelectric experiment each electron is ejected by a single quantum, and the energy of the electron is then related to the energy of a singe quantum.<br>  <br>  Wave-particle duality means that em radiation is a very complex and mysterious thing which cannot be described in terms of a single simple model.  You just have to learn to live with the complexity and mystery of reality ...|`|lKVQ6OXYaa	the amount of energy would be the amplitude of the wave....the shorter wavelength are higher frequencies..<br>  <br>  wavelength is not a type of energy...it is the length of the wave that carries energy....as i said...high frequencies have smaller wavelengths....low frequencies have large wavelengths....a 20 Hz sound pressure wave has a wavelength of approx 17 meters in the air..<br>  <br>  wavelength= speed of sound / frequency<br>  wavelength = 340 meters per sec/ 20 hz(20 cycles per second)<br>  <br>  340/20 = 17meters<br>  <br>  <br>  Quote The amount of energy carried in a photon of the radiation isalso wavelength dependant.<br>  <br>  this means that the amplitude of the wave is frequency dependant..when the freq changes the amplitude also changes in proportion.....so directly proportional...

4fWZL4TRaa	I live next to a similar highway, but don't notice it much, so I am lucky it seems. It adjoins the back of our property, 4 lane main road, and about 30m from the house. There is a line of trees along the road, for which we thank the green movement. It is big trucks and "hot" motorbikes that are the loudest. It is much louder outside, rarely noticeable inside. We keep the windows and doors closed for a number of reasons, and that is important. My computer fan is more annoying. We have single glaze windows and full length curtains.<br>  <br>  It seems to me you need to identify how the sound comes into your house. It may be a certain window, or something about a roof or panel resonating somewhere. I have a steel shed out the back and it vibrates strongly from certain truck sounds as they accelerate away. We have a brick veneer house, and all the sound comes in doors and windows. I notice even closing the screen door makes a noticeable difference. These are big expenses you are considering, so a $100-200 sound meter (electrical or electronic stores) sounds like a good investment if you are the do it yourself type. Record the noise and what is where for a few days till a pattern emerges. You may be able to find a sound/acoustic engineer in the phone book. Incidentally there are standards about the level of traffic noise here, and certainly some neighbours have been agitating for state government action. The state government was able to demonstrate that it is just within limits for the next 10 years predicted traffic.<br>  <br>  Check out ear inserts, low cost solution, at least in the short term to get some rest.

RRFiy9CAaa	1 a) Split the triangle into 4 sub-triangles which are also equilateral and of side length 0.5 cm. The center sub-triangle has vertices at the midpoints of the sides of the larger triangle. Now distribute the 5 points into the 4 sub-triangles. By the Pigeonhole Principle, Ceiling[5/4] = 2 points must land in the same sub-triangle. So obviously these two points cannot be further apart than 0.5 cm.<br>  <br>  1 b) You can place the 6 points on the vertices of the larger triangle and the midpoints of the sides and thereby have all of them being separated by at least 0.5 cm pairwise. So no change.<br>  <br>  1 c) Suppose on the contrary that 0.5 cannot be replaced by a smaller number. Then it must be possible to find a configuration of 8 points that are pairwise separated by at least 0.5. Given 8 points and the partition into sub-triangles as described in (a), suppose no sub-triangle has 3 points, then each sub-triangle has at most 2 points. If any sub-triangle has less than 2 triangles, then the total number of points would be less than 8. So each sub-triangle must have exactly 2 points. For a corner (non-center) sub-triangle, we cannot have both points at vertices of the center sub-triangle for otherwise there is only one point left-over for the center sub-triangle to place in order to ensure a 0.5 distance. So for each corner sub-triangle, one point must be on the vertex of the larger triangle, and one must be on a vertex of the center sub-triangle. But this is also impossible since no vertices are left-over for the points of the center sub-triangle to be placed. So there must be some sub-triangle with at least 3 points, and these points must be placed on the vertices of the sub-triangle. If this sub-triangle is the center one, then the distribution of the remaining 5 points on the remaining 3 corner sub-triangles leads, by the Pigeonhole Principle, to Ceiling[5/3] = 2 points in the same corner sub-triangle. The corner sub-triangle already has 2 points placed on two of its vertices (that it shares with the center sub-triangle), so there is only one vertex left to fill. So the other point cannot be accommodated. If the sub-triangle with at least 3 points is a corner sub-triangle, then the remaining sub-triangles are two corner and one center. The remaining 5 points are distributed amongst the 3 sub-triangles and as before some sub-triangle has at least 2 points. If this sub-triangle is the center one, one are done. If it is a corner sub-triangle, two points fill the remaining vertices and cannot accommodate any more points. The center sub-triangle cannot accommodate any more points either. So the remaining 3 points must all go into the remaining corner sub-triangle, which is impossible since it has only one vertex remaining to be filled. Thus with 8 points some pair of points must be nearer than 0.5.<br>  <br>  2) First of all the color, if it exists, cannot be a, for otherwise ba = a => by (ii) ab = a but by (iv) ab = b whereas a and b are different. So it must be either b or c. Suppose on the contrary that it is neither b nor c. Consider x = b, ax = x is satisfied because of (iv). bx = x is satisfied because of (i). So we require that cx = x not e satisfied i.e. cb ≠ b. By (ii) this also means that bc ≠ b. Making the same consideration for x = c, we require that bx = x not be satisfied i.e. bc ≠ c, and cb ≠ c. So altogether we require bc, cb ≠ b, c i.e. bc, cb = a. But cb = a => (cb)b = ab => by (iii) c(bb) = ab => by (i) cb = ab => by (iv) cb = b (contradiction to cb ≠ b). So our original assumption must be wrong and so either one of b and c are colors fulfilling ax = x, bx = x, and cx = x.|`|wofmf6kmaa	no idea!!|`|hHVMrnK3aa	I answered the color mixing question here:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090225172108AA3SEAo">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  But someone (presumably the person who asked the question) voted "No Best Answer", and the question is stuck in tiebreaker limbo.<br>  <br>  Given the Yahoo Answers Points system, and that answerers like to get points for their answers, many don't like to do multi-part questions since,<br>  it can be a lot of work and furthermore "Best Answer" cannot be shared.

And, 1gr = 60 mg. 1/2 hr = 30 minutes; 1/2 gr = 30 mg. 1/4 gr = 15 mg.  Or, 45 mg = 3/4 gr.<br>  If you think of the clock, you can do all the grain/mg conversions in your head, almost instantly!

29anpqmjaa	In Australia (sorry I can't speak for the rest of the world in this case) the amount of hoops you have to jump through to be able to use animals for research is amazing.<br>  The Animal Care and Ethics Committee (ACEC) is very stringent in policing institutions and facilities where vertebrate animals are used for the purposes of research and testing.  It takes more checks and procedures to hold animals for testing (even non intrusive tests like for behaviour) than it does to hold animals for purpose of slaughter or for food purposes.<br>  <br>  Companies only test on animals when there are no viable alternatives (which is one of the conditions set by ACEC which allow you to keep animals for that purpose) and unfortunately PETA has demonized and unfairly portrayed the industry.<br>  <br>  PETA should turn it's focus on the industry which encourages people to buy cosmetic items with such fervor, rather than the industry which is just supplying items which are in demand.  Instead PETA gets into bed with the media and magazine companies to push it's own agenda-rather than making people aware that it's this very culture of magazines and TV telling us we need to be beautiful and buy the products our favourite celebrities are endorsing so we can look like them, which is ultimately responsible for such a need/want of non-essential items (like flavoured lip gloss or cream that makes your eyebrows smooth).<br>  <br>  Many lifesaving drugs and procedures have come about from animal testing and research.  And as a matter of fact, in the UK you can sign up to be part of a paid medical trial, for drugs which have cleared all other levels of testing and need to be trialled on human volunteers before being approved for sale.  However there was a case in the last few years where the drug adversely affected two men taking part in the trial and has severely harmed them.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	They wont test on humans!  Would YOU volunteer to be used in tests and have potentially dangerous substances pumpled into you, while you are strapped down!<br>  Some `alternative` methods do not give valid results, tho these days most do try their best to find alternatives to animals.<br>  If you - or a loved one - were sick (or even had a potentially terminal illness) and a drug that had been tested on animals saved you...how would you feel about it then?

Higher pressure would shift the equilibrium to the left...the equation would shift to reduce the pressure and re-establish equilibrium, so less hydrogen would be produced. Each mole of gas occupies the same volume at the same pressure, so to reduce the pressure that's applied the reaction will shift toward reactants.<br>  <br>  Endothermic reaction utilize heat to be driven to produce products, sort of like frying eggs...if the heat is reduced the eggs will not fry properly. <br>   <br>             CH4 + H2O + heat <-----> CO2 + 3H2<br>  <br>  Same thing here...low temperature means the heat being supplied to the reaction is lowered, so the reactant will not form products as readily, lowering the yield of products.|`|whD25cV5aa	A higher pressure would compact the room in which the reaction can take place, making collisions between gases more likely and therefore speeding up the reaction and increasing the yield.<br>  <br>  If the reaction is endothermic it means it needs to take in energy (in the form of heat) from the surroundings, and needs the energy to make the particles move and collide. If the temperature was colder the reaction would be much slower, which will decrease the product yield.|`|xmWLJaNsaa	2 moles of reactant are producing 4 moles of gaseous products.

However,our acquaintance with these feelings is not limited solely to the press; in daily life,we,too,frequently come across such problems and, more importantly, personally experience them. <br>  People and societies endeavour to liberate themselves from the distressing experiences,disorder and repressive social structures that have prevailed over the world for long periods. <br>  We only need to glance at ancient Greece; the Great Roman Empire; Tsarist Russia, or the so-called Age of Enlightenment, and even the 20th century-a century of misery which saw two world wars and world-wide social disasters. No matter upon which century or location you concentrate your research, the picture will not be appreciably different. <br>  If this is the case, why haven't people succeeded in solving these problems, or at least some efforts been made to remove such social diseases from society?<br>  People have encountered these problems in all ages, yet each time they have failed to find any solutions because the methods they employed were inappropriate. They sought various solutions, tried different political systems, laid down impracticable and totalitarian rules, stirred up revolutions or subscribed to perverted ideologies, while many others preferred to adopt an indifferent attitude and merely accepted the status quo. <br>  In our day, people are almost numbed by this way of living. They readily believe these problems to be "facts of life." They picture a society immune to these problems as being nothing short of impossible-a dream utopia. They persistently and openly express their distaste for such a way of living, yet easily embrace it, since they think they have no other alternative. <br>  The resolution of all these problematic issues is possible only by living by the principles of the "true religion." Only when the values of true religion prevail can a pleasant and tranquil scene replace this gloomy and unfavourable picture, which is doomed to continue so long as God's limits are ignored. To put it another way, people are enslaved by these complications as long as they avoid the values of the Qur'an. Put simply, this is the "nightmare of disbelief" and the link below for this wonderful book:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download.php?WorkNumber=256&Format=pdf" rel="nofollow">http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download....</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you will find how the regulation of life by the "norms of morality" introduced by the Qur'an revealed to mankind by God will banish the "nightmare of disbelief," how pessimism, corruption and social restlessness can be eliminated from society, how the individual can surround himself with an ideal environment, what spiritual and material benefits he is likely to attain by adherence to these norms of morality are gone into in detail, and finally, that the unique alternative to all these problems is the morality of the Qur'an. <br>  So far, many books have attempted to deal with the social and psychological problems societies face. Yet, what distinguishes this book from others is its stress on the most realistic solution. It also sincerely warns people against the troublesome future they are likely to face if they fail to resort to this solution. <br>  We expect that every reader of conscience will grasp that peace, mutual trust and an ideal social life is attainable only by embracing the values of the Qur'an and will turn to the true religion, which is Islam. <br>  They will then happily join the ranks of those who never suffer, mentally or physically, from any of the above-mentioned complications. Around them, there will always be an abundance of favours, comfort, love, respect, peace and confidence, and moral virtues will prevail. They will know how to earn God's approval, by observing His limits and the commandments of the Qur'an. They will thus, by having faith in God, attain His mercy and at last enter Paradise. <br>  <br>  Useful link:<br>  (A BRIEF ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING ISLAM)<br>  <a href="http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.p...</a><br>  <br>  DEEP THINKING (VIDEO):<br>  <a href="http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDetail.php?dev-t=EDCRFV&objectId=1124" rel="nofollow">http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDe...</a><br>   <br>  <br>  =* FOR ANY HELP FEEL FREE TO E-MAIL ME ON *=<br>  smiling4ever222@hotmail.com

Ftkr9jqYaa	With few exceptions, people with chromosomal disorders, wherein they have a karyotype of more or less than 46 chromosomes, are unable to reproduce, although many are capable of enjoying sexual activity, and can ejaculate.<br>  <br>  For example, my uncle, who is 6'9", was discovered to have Klinefelter's Syndrome (XXY sex chromosome anomaly) when he was in his thirties, which enabled him to avoid a paternity suit filed against him by an ex-wife.  Although he married several times and had no trouble performing sexually, he is infertile, as are most individuals with abnormal sex chromosome configurations.<br>  <br>  However, XYY syndrome (an aneuploidy in which a human male receives an extra Y chromosome) is generally characterized by normal fertility, as well as healthy sexual performance.<br>  <br>  Turner syndrome or Ullrich-Turner syndrome (also known as "Gonadal dysgenesis") encompasses several conditions, of which monosomy X is most common.  Women with Turner syndrome are almost universally infertile.  Nevertheless, sexual enjoyment and performance can be normal, especially when estrogen replacement therapy is utilized.<br>  <br>  In contrast, women with Triple X syndrome (a form of chromosomal variation characterized by the presence of an extra X chromosome in each cell of a human female, also known as triplo-X, trisomy X, XXX syndrome, and 47,XXX aneuploidy) are fertile, and have normal sex lives.<br>  <br>  XXYY syndrome (48 chromosomes, including two copies of both the X and Y sex chromosomes) is considered to be a variation of Klinefelter's Syndrome.  Men with this condition, as with Klinefelter's, are rarely fertile, because the X chromosome and its estrogenic effects reduce sperm viability.<br>  <br>  True hermaphroditism is an intersex condition in which a person is born with both ovarian and testicular tissue.  There may be an ovary on one side and a testis on the other, but more commonly one or both gonads is an ovotestis containing both types of tissue.  It is rare - and undocumented- for both types of gonadal tissue to function.  Encountered karyotypes are 47XXY, 46XX/46XY, or 46XX/47XXY.  Although similar in some ways to mixed gonadal dysgenesis, the conditions can be distinguished histologically.<br>  <br>  Mixed gonadal dysgenesis is a condition of unusual and asymmetrical gonadal development leading to an unassigned sex differentiation. A number of differences have been reported in the karyotype, most commonly a mosaicism 45,X/ 46, XY.

InoTLoBMaa	In physical science, freezing or solidification is the process in which a liquid turns into a solid when cold enough. The freezing point is the temperature at which this happens. Melting, the process of turning a solid to a liquid, is almost the exact opposite of freezing. All known liquids undergo freezing when the temperature is lowered with the sole exception of helium, which remains liquid at absolute zero and can only be solidified under pressure. For most substances, the melting and freezing points are the same temperature<br>  <br>  freezing is used in the food industry to quickly freeze perishable food items (see frozen food). In this case, food items are subjected to temperatures well below water's melting/freezing point (273.15K or 0°C), causing the water inside the foods to freeze in a very short period of time. See supercooling for the further details of this process.<br>  <br>  Flash freezing techniques are also used to freeze biological samples fast enough that large ice crystals cannot form and damage the sample (see vitrification).This rapid freezing is done by submerging the sample in liquid nitrogen or a mixture of dry ice and ethanol.<br>  <br>  A supercooled liquid will stay in a liquid state beyond the normal freezing point when it has less opportunity for nucleation; that is, if it is pure enough and has a smooth enough container. Once agitated it will very rapidly change state into a solid.Fast Food restaurants sometimes use flash freeze on their food and then quickly cook it after.<br>  <br>  American inventor Clarence Birdseye developed the quick-freezing process of food preservation in the early 20th century.

oVz6sPsIaa	During a nuclear reaction free neutrons are continually created.  These neutrons split other uranium or plutonium atoms in a process which creates even more neutrons in a chain reaction.  If the neutrons multiply too rapidly you don't have a controlled nuclear reactor but rather something resembling an atom bomb.  The role of a moderator is to absorb neutrons.  By controlling the amount of moderator material in the reactor you can maintain the reaction in a controlled state, ie the nuclear reaction is sustained, producing heat, but not leading to an uncontrolled explosion.  The moderator material is made in the form of graphite rods which are inserted into the reactor to absorb the neutrons.|`|92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	SmartGuy is incorrect.<br>  <br>  The moderator slows down neutrons.  The cross section for U235 to absorb a neutron and split is much higher for slower neutrons than for the faster ones typically produced in fission.  So it helps your chain reaction if you can slow the neutrons down.  In order to slow down the neutrons in collisions, the ideal moderator would be about the same mass as a neutron.  Hydrogen fits the bill, so water makes a good moderator.  It absorbs neutrons, too, though, which means light water moderated reactors need more enriched fuel.  Heavy water or Beryllium avoid that issue, but they can be tough to work with.  Carbon (graphite or something similar) can work as well, and is the next-most-common choice after hydrogen.<br>  <br>  What SG describes is the control rods.  They absorb neutrons in order to keep the reaction just barely critical without running away.

Two young men who are friends, but of very different character, having different physique, and from different social backgrounds fall in love with a young girl.  She marries one of them.

The story ends in disaster - the two men fight to the death of both.<br>  <br>  Well worth a read - sorry to have given away the ending.  Mann concludes that there is no simple answer to this question since we are who we are in terms of both body and mind- particularly so within the marriage bond.

15mbP1hqaa	Polyvinyl alcohol has excellent film forming, emulsifying, and adhesive properties. It is also resistant to oil, grease and solvent. It is odorless and nontoxic. It has high tensile strength and flexibility, as well as high oxygen and aroma barrier properties. However these properties are dependent on humidity, in other words, with higher humidity more water is absorbed. The water, which acts as a plasticiser, will then reduce its tensile strength, but increase its elongation and tear strength. PVA is fully degradable and is a quick dissolver.

They need water because it fuels the body to make energy from glucose.

This is what I know about carnivores: Carnivores don't usually eat frequently, but will capture prey and engulf it all at once.. The energy gained will often last them a couple of days before they need another helping.. I'm not sure if that applies, but that's data from lion feeding habits.

0WB5Tru5aa	Even atoms have been directly observed using the electron microscope. You can google for some pictures. There is a minimum size-limit though. The minimum size of the 'object' that can be observed is the De Broglie -wavelength of the electron. <br>  <br>  Remember that particles are also waves. Now since the particle is a wave, it has a wavelength relative to its mass and velocity. A wave can never hit an object that is smaller than its wavelength. That's why. You can always increase the speed of the electrons to view smaller and smaller 'objects', but the electron-microscope requires the electrons to reflect back from the atoms, and as such increasing speed will likely destabilize the picture. Also, observing the particle (hitting it with an electron) will definitely cause the observed particle to move. So the picture gained is never the current situation, but the situation before the collision. Any observation of a particle alters its place and speed.<br>  <br>  More about particle-waves here:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_broglie_wavelength" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_broglie_...</a>|`|8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	Transmission Electron Microscopes have produced images with sufficient resolution to show carbon atoms in diamond and atoms in silicon, at magnifications of 50 million times.<br>  <br>  The limit to the capability of electron microscopes is the wavelength of electrons.|`|46T3s2htaa	I believe with electron microscopes, we can view arrays of atoms, but in black and white. <br>  <br>  As to the limit question, when we're talking about things as small as subatomic particles, attempting to observe these particles would disrupt their natural behaviour.
AA10335036	It may look like a different frequency, but that's just because we're used to waves that all travel at the same speed. Since your graph has position, not time, as the x coordinate, it's consistent with the faster-traveling wave having twice the wavelength.<br>  Imagine a real-life situation that replicates this. Someone drives by you at 30 km/h waving (vertically) at you at 2 Hz, then someone else drives by at 60 km/h waving at the same frequency. When you plot their hand displacements vs position on the road, you'll get the same kind of graph.
17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	A Cepheid variable is one of the many types of variable stars: stars whose brightnes varies over time. This is caused by pulsations in the size of the star, which lead to changes in brightness. Cepheids are particularly important because their luminosity is a function of their period of variation. This gives us a "standard candle" with which to measure distances. The period of the Cepheid tells us its absolute magnitude. Comparing this with its observed brightness tells us exactly how far away it is. The distances to nearby globular clusters and galaxies have all been measured using Cepheid variables.
cWuumdy7aa	The volume of distribution is given by the following equation:<br>  <br>   <br>  Therefore the dose required to give a certain plasma concentration can be determined if the VD for that drug is known. The VD is not a physiologic value; it is more a reflection of how a drug will distribute throughout the body depending on several physicochemical properties, e.g. solubility, charge, size, etc.<br>  <br>  The units for Volume of Distribution are typically reported in (ml or liter)/kg body weight. The fact that VD is a ratio of a theoretical volume to a fixed unit of body weight explains why the VD for children is typically higher than that for adults, even though children are smaller and weigh less. As body composition changes with age, VD decreases.<br>  <br>  The VD may also be used to determine how readily a drug will displace into the body tissue compartments relative to the blood:<br>  <br>   <br>  Where:<br>  <br>  VP = plasma volume <br>  VT = apparent tissue volume <br>  fu = fraction unbound in plasma <br>  fuT = fraction unbound in tissue
aEeCCHVlaa	Where did you ever hear that salt is mixed in ice creams to avoid melting of ice?  Ice is not added to the cream, but around the cream container to help solidify it.  When the ice melts, it is absorbing the heat from the cream.  The term ice cream came from using ice to help make the "ice cream", but never added to it.   Had and still have an home churn for making ice cream but never added ice to the cream.   The cream container is in the middle of the churn bucket and ice is packed around it.  Rock salt is added to the ice to expedite the melting, thereby cooling the cream down faster.  Modern day manufacturers don't use ice, but refrigeration methods.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	Not really. You don't use salt in the ice cream making process to prevent the ice from melting but to lower the temperature to below 32 which is needed for the ice cream to form correctly. <br>  <br>  Same deal with snow/ice. Its added to drop the freezing temp so that ice is eliminated on the streets/walkways.|`|eVubSKcEaa	when you add salt to ice, the temperature decreases a few degree Celsius more.

nTKuRFlKaa	*Differential pressure is the pressure increase provided by the pump between the pump inlet and outlet. It is measured as the difference between the pressure at the pump’s discharge flange and the suction flange.<br>  At a given flow rate, impeller diameter and rotational speed a centrifugal pump will produce a specific differential pressure (or head). This differential pressure is unaffected by inlet pressure. E.G. If the inlet pressure is raised to 100 PSI, outlet pressure becomes 130 PSI, but the differential remains 30 PSI.<br>  The required differential pressure is determined by evaluating all pressure (or head) losses from the liquid level in the receiver through all piping and components of the system and back to the receiver. These calculations are carried out for any design or expected flow rate through the system. The differential also includes the pressure equivalent of any net vertical distance between the receiver liquid level and the highest evaporator element. Furthermore, additional differential pressure must be added into the total to overcome the difference between the saturation pressure of the refrigerant at the pumping temperature and the pressure in any coil that is being held at higher pressure via a “back pressure regulator.”<br>  <br>  -If you are in a industry having exposure to pumping systems, see the performance of the pump at different suction pressure and same discharge pressure [because you you are feeding against the a particular pressure] ,check the flow and real amperage, you will get to know the effect of differential pressure.<br>  <br>  **A compressor is used to increase the pressure of the incoming air or gas. <br>  <br>  CPR is the main design parameter of the compressor.<br>  <br>  After certain CPR , COMPRESSING SYSTEM will be multi-stage.<br>  <br>  In any design, the job of the compressor is to increase the pressure of the flow. We measure the increase by the compressor pressure ratio (CPR), which is the ratio of the air total pressure pt exiting the compressor to the air pressure entering the compressor. This number is always greater than 1.0.|`|AA10332086	Differential pressure is also used for compressors. This is specially true for centrifugal compressors. An example of a performance curve is in the article below. As you can see it is very much like a pump curve.<br>  <br>  In the case of many positive displacement compressors, the compression ratio is just a variable that is used in the performance calculations for capacity and horsepower.<br>  <br>  It really doesn't matter which you use since with one you can calculate the other.

yzVGwQEwaa	Before we can help you you need to sit down and think about how one should go about asking a question.  Your "question" is in fact an order.  It's a rather silly order in that it is not specific.  For example, because of the way you wrote it, these are viable answers:<br>  <br>  "My hypothesis is that maple trees exist."<br>  <br>  "I hypothesize that maple trees can fly."<br>  <br>  "I intend to determine whether or not maple trees are actually George Bush clones in disguise."
4fWZL4TRaa	There are many possible IM products, and it depends on the linearity curve and circuit configuration. Some transfer curves are predominately odd and some are predominately even. Some circuits (amplifiers or mixers) might have push pull (balanced) circuits that cancel out certain harmonics.<br>  <br>  A single tone or frequency passing through a nonlinear device causes harmonics. The ratio of odd to even, and the ratio of different orders (second, fourth etc) depends on the device and its configuration.<br>  <br>  When there are two or more frequencies, the sum and difference frequencies of all these products, with the fundamental, the harmonics and with each other all appear (in ratios depending on the configuration etc.). Luckily most of them fall at a lower level. It is relatively difficult to predict the full outcome because the bandwidth, stray coupling, imperfect components, stray resonances and so on come into a real world device. That is why the IP2 and IP3 are often measured as real world two tone tests, with the rest ignored, as this is something that can be done on a narrow-band system, and that might provide a repeatable result, or a way of optimising the linearity (adjusting bias for example).<br>  <br>  The ratios of the two tones may be 10:1, so the larger tone can be seen as sweeping the smaller one through the linearity of the transfer characteristic. If the tones are the same level, the simultaneous peaks (vector sum) needs to be considered.<br>  <br>  I don't know what you want to achieve, but you might be able to get a result using SPICE to simulate your circuit, using accurate device models, and do a fourier transform on the output to see the results. This is a Direct Conversion Receiver, so likely to be at a lower frequency where SPICE is suitable. Worth a try. Look up LT-SPICE for a free full function application.<br>  <br>  Some other thoughts that might help...<br>  If this is something you have built and are having trouble with, I would consider some sort of spurious signal causing interference, such as VHF oscillations. Also the possibilty of AM to PM conversion when passing through a filter that has an effect on the different QPSK tone levels, followed by a nonlinear device. Linearity (amplitude or phase) issues can be gauged by a constellation diagram. In the end it is Bit Error Rate that matters. As QPSK is constant amplitude, (like FM) the amplitude linearity is not all that important, other than for interference from adjacent channels. Interference from far channels can be helped by a channel filter before the mixer, as well as the LPF in the baseband amplifier - what would be the IF filter in other radios. Even a few dB extra attenuation can make the difference with interference. Jitter (short term frequency stability) on the local oscillator is an issue, especially if it is a synthesised signal.

UCmw864Uaa	Well, Embryonic stem cell research is research conducted on embryonic stem cells.  Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent which means they can differentiate into over 220 cell types in the adult human body.  They are able to self-renew and divide as many times as necessary if they are given adequate energy to divide.  Scientists collect stem cells from a fertilized egg during the blastocyst phase.  Generally about 4-5 days after fertilization.<br>  <br>  The advantages are numerous.  It's thought that we'd be able to replace damaged tissue in the body, grow completely new organs using your own DNA and even cure many diseases including but not limited to cancer and many types of diseases which damage tissue and organs.<br>  <br>  The disadvantage to (really mostly Fundamentalist Religious People) is the destruction of the blastocyst.<br>  <br>  Whether or not it's moral or immoral is an opinion based question.  I find it to be perfectly moral.  Many religious groups say that it is killing a person.  Honestly, I don't see how a sac of cells is a person yet.  So that's really up for debate, no one is right or wrong in saying that it is or isn't although they might think so.

X9BAbTQbaa	In theory an infinite number, however as light in this situation travels essentially in a straight line there are other things to factor in. Are the two mirrors perfectly parallel to each other both vertically and horizontally? This will determine how many images can be seen before they curve of the edge of the mirrors! The next that springs to mind is the size of the object, this is because the object itself will be in the way of the light being reflected back and forth and therefore stop the path of the light. If we had perfect mirrors and no losses then an object placed between the two mirrors and then removed would be there to see forever. That will not happen in our lifetimes put together! There is one more glaringly obvious problem that will confront us, that is if we are to see these infinite images between our perfectly aligned mirrors then we have to be between the two mirrors and that leads us back to the problem of having something between the two mirrors! So lots and lots in theory. Reality is not going to allow it for you and me! Hope this is of some help.|`|7xbSG3lQaa	You would see an infinite number of images. Each mirror would reflect the image of the object to the other mirror, which would reflect it back in turn.

zFsTSrOcaa	The low pressure contributes a couple of feet to the sea-level rise.  The wind has no effect on sea level in the open ocean, but the onshore storm surge is largely wind-driven (it's higher on the side of the storm where the wind blows onshore).|`|aEeCCHVlaa	Anytime pressure on something is reduced, it tends to cause the object to rise, although it may be a small rise.  Think of yourself as being prone with a weighted (pressure) object on your back.  Your body tends to compress with the pressure. Only the skeletal structure keeps the body from being completely compressed. Then as the weight is lifted (reduced/low pressure), the body tends to "rise".  The same analogy holds true for sea level.  The wind does not cause the sea level to rise, only wave surge.|`|cf6BdTYUaa	yes the low pressure makes it rise...

M2UWOTAjaa	We do absorb energy from the sun, and it is essential to the way Vitamin D works with building strong bones. It also clears up psoriasis almost immediately (well, within a day - it will come back, but then you just go out into the sun again or to a tanning booth). In addition sunshine seems to make people cheerful.<br>  However, we cannot use sunlight as a source to produce calories (the equivalent of energy in equipment).|`|CuMYdQV6aa	Clearly  we use sunlight in obtaining a tan, and the process stimulates the production of Vitamin D. But can we photosynthesise?

CaqdDzQZaa	usually once the sun comes out and the temperature reaches 35 degrees fahrenheit or above, the snow will slowly begin to melt.|`|7xHfvMIZaa	Well, 33 degrees fahrenheit. But I'd kind of advise against wearing flats in this weather. They'll get ruined no matter what the temp, with all the mud and slush.|`|AA10008098	Actually snow can sublimate (turn into water vapor) at temperatures below freezing (like freezer burn!).  However, snow will remain at 32F until completely melted.  Sunlight is almost all reflected by white snow and little solar energy is collected.  If there is road salt in the snow along roads it will melt at temperatures below 32F (even as low as about 0F if there is lots of salt).  Also any dirt particles in the snow will capture solar energy and help melt the snow even if air temperature is below 32F.  As snow melts and refreezes at night the ice next day may be more transparent allowing solar energy to pass on through to dark material below that captures the heat, melting the ice.  Notice how snow shrinks fastest beside a road where there is both salt and dirt.  I'd suggest waiting to wear ballet flats (etc.) until the snow is melted and the melt drains away or dries up.  Glad you asked.|`|o3JnacTPaa	Well snow usually begins to melt at probably 31 and higher.|`|SjrhuZQnaa	5o

AA10008098	Likely there will be nil effect on local marine life.  A quantity of seawater will be brought into the plant continuously while in operation.  Pure water will be removed from the seawater by any number of operations that must be energy efficient and slightly concentrated seawater will be returned to the sea where it will be diluted back to normal, long before it can reach a park or reef at a distance.  Likely screens etc. will be used to keep sealife out of the plant because it could foul the equipment.  Likely no strong chemicals would be used, especially if membranes and reverse osmosis is used.  Likely the plant operators had to submit impact statements to prove there is no significant risk.|`|FwuyxxoWaa	Hopefully none, because the plant isn't taking the salt out of the water until it is actually taken out of the reef, so no salt water creatures will die due to that, the only potential dangers are animals getting caught in machinery, but the authorities take precautions there.|`|zzvDybEiaa	None.<br>  <br>  The salt water is brought into the Desalination plant.<br>  The salt is removed.<br>  Which creates drinking water.<br>  Which will usually be stored in tanks for distribution to the local people as drinking water.

Here in the US, you need a permit (display, education, wildlife rehabilitation, or scientific) to hold owls.  These permits are issued by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and have very specific requirements, for example: at least 12 programs per year per animal under an education permit; no more than 180 days in captivity per animal under the rehab permit; IACUC approval of your research for a scientific permit, and extensive husbandry and facilities requirements under a display permit.  In the UK, most captive-bred owls are legal, and in some parts of the world there are no restrictions at all.  You'll need to check with your local regulatory agencies - federal, state/provincial, and local - to see what applies to you.  <br>  <br>  The second consideration is husbandry.  While owls are easier to keep than, say, falcons, they're still a lot of work.  Diet should consist of vitamin-supplemented whole prey (mice/chicks/rats/guinea pigs/etc.) supplied by a reputable rodent supplier and fed pre-killed.  Tropical species require heated shelters, while temparate species can be kept outdoors with access to a heated shelter box.  Because owls are quite strong for their size and tend to splatter bits of prey in every direction, the flight should be very sturdy and very easy to clean.  Don't even think of keeping one of these birds in a cage in your living room - the mess, stench, and the bird's misery in those cramped quarters will make both you and the bird very unhappy.  Make sure you identify a competent avian vet before you acquire your bird, and bring your bird in for fecal floats, physical exams, and complete blood counts on a semi-annual basis.  <br>  <br>  The third consideration is training.  If you haven't worked with raptors before, you'll want to work with a falconer, zoo trainer, or other professional to learn to handle your bird.  Tiny owls like screech owls can be handled with lightweight leather gloves, while eagle owls and great horned owls are best handled with eagle gloves.  There's a whole art to making and using the jesses, leashes, creances, and other falconry equipment used to train birds of prey - again, work with an experienced person to learn these skills.  <br>  <br>  Choose your bird carefully.  Imprinted (human-reared) owls behave very differently from wild-caught ones, and behavior also varies greatly between genders and among species - make sure you know what you're doing before you choose a bird.  Also consider the bird's lifespan - screech owls live 10-15 years with excellent care, while a great horned owl can live into its 70's.  Make sure you can provide for the bird for its entire life.|`|C0XgdLDeaa	No, they are wild and it would be a LOT of work for you and you would need to have a huge cage for it.|`|4c1e07d9ba0c2d099d9db46ee34af35faa	In the UK, you need a licence for birds or prey too.

b96e23f4e62d95301c15a6f530a29fe7aa	Everything you can observe is always some interval "in the past" whether it be the light from the Sun eight minutes into the past or light reflected from the back of your hand a few nanoseconds into the past (light travels about a nanosecond per foot, roughly). According to the Special Theory of Relativity there is no such thing as "simultaneous events" because everything observed depends on the relative distance and motion of the observer (that would be you!). "Now" is a relative concept. Confused? All will be made clear (eventually) when you "die" and your "mind" reverts to other dimensions of "reality". Or maybe not. You just have to wait and see for answers to some questions.|`|ooopNW0oaa	I can still hear my Mother-In-Laws voice from yesterday. Can you Explane that?...:)|`|JsiELu6xaa	The reason we see the sun as it was eight minutes ago is because of the speed of light. The speed off light is equal to exactly 299,792,458 Meters per second (m/s). The other piece of data required is the distance to the sun which is approximately 149,600,000 kilometers or 149,600,000,000 meters. By dividing the distance in meters by the velocity in meters per second we obtain the the amount of seconds required for the journey which happens to be 499.01 seconds which is 8.31 minutes. So yes when we look at the sun from earth we are seeing it as it was eight and a half minutes ago. This is only because of the unimaginable distance to the sun from earth. It is the equivalent of 3733 complete trips around the earths equator. But when referring to something as close as your hand the amount of time it takes for light to travel between the position of your hand and your eyes is very negligible. For example, say you were looking at your hand and your hand was only one meter away from your eyes, the light travels between them in .00000000336 seconds. So in a way you are looking at your hand as it appeared .00000000336 seconds ago, but by the time you have completed that thought, the light waves from your hand have "updated" the image of your hand billions of times. Your mind cant even process information that quick. So you really are seeing your hand as it appears "now".|`|owsQTW3oaa	If you are considering the time over distance and processing of visual information.... everything we see is "in the past".  Whether it be the sun or the person standing next to you, we never see the "now".  There will never be a true "now" and it is not possible as the firing of information in the brain takes time to register anyways.|`|qcsqsvEYaa	In the same manner, if your hand is x meters away from your eye,<br>  you're seeing your hand (x/c) seconds ago, where c=3x10^8 m/sec. <br>  Say you're hand is 1 m away from your eyeball, then it takes the light from your hand <br>  t=1m/3x10^8 m/sec=3.3x10^(-9) sec <br>  to reach your eyeball. Plus you also need to factor in time for your eye to send a signal to your brain. <br>  I guess at that level you perceive that as instantaneous.|`|zYriuUiWaa	wHEN YOU SEE THE SUN YOU ARE SEEING THE LIGHT FROM 8 MINUTES AGO|`|JDyHE9myaa	now

SvmZlLdaaa	Lion vs tiger - could go either way. There are numerous records of fights between lions and tigers, since many people in the past have wanted the answer to this question and tried to settle it by cruelly pitting tigers and lions against each other. In some cases the tiger wins, in some cases the lion. The outcome of such a fight depends on the individuals involved - their age, size, sex, health, experience, temperament, etc. Tigers are generally larger and stronger, but size and strength are not the only determining factors - a large but timid tiger would be likely to lose to a small but aggressive lion, even though it was stronger (and you specified that the two in your fight are the same weight). Lions usually have more fighting experience - they often clash with other prides, whereas tigers tend to avoid conflict whenever possible. Also, the lion's mane (provided it is a male, of course) would offer some degree of protection against a fatal throat-bite. It wouldn't make the killing bite impossible by any means, but it would certainly make it more difficult to achieve and hold.<br>  <br>  American crocodile vs Komodo dragon - crocodile wins. It has much more powerful jaws, and it would be difficult for the lizard to penetrate its thick hide.<br>  <br>  Wolverine vs honey badger - my money would be on the wolverine. Both are very aggressive, but the wolverine kills large prey more often and is probably stronger.<br>  <br>  Mountain gorilla vs American black bear - bear wins. It has larger canines and stronger jaws, plus long claws and a more aggressive nature.<br>  <br>  Cougar vs leopard - this could go either way. Both have large canine teeth and eighteen razor-sharp claws, and are very agile. I think the outcome would depend on the individuals involved, their age, sex, health, experience and so on.<br>  <br>  Caracal vs serval - another close match, but I think the caracal has the edge. They are very strong for their size, able to kill prey as large as bushbuck, whilst servals generally hunt small prey such as rodents.<br>  <br>  Rhinoceros vs hippopotamus - the rhino is probably the more agile of the two, and its horn gives it an advantage. If it could stab the hippo in a vital area it would win, but if the hippo managed to take a big bite out of the rhino it would have a chance.<br>  <br>  Grey wolf vs spotted hyena - this could go either way. The wolf is swifter and more agile, but the hyena has extremely powerful jaws. I think the outcome would depend on the particular individuals involved.<br>  <br>  Indian mongoose vs ferret - the mongoose would probably win, as it is a wild animal that must hunt and fight for survival. The ferret (a domesticated polecat) would not be used to fighting and would have its food provided for it, so its instincts would be less keen.<br>  <br>  Rattlesnake vs king cobra - the species of rattlesnake would be a factor, but it's likely that the victor would simply be whichever got the first bite in. Rattlesnakes have longer fangs, so could do more damage with their teeth, but both are highly venomous and the king cobra feeds on other snakes, so would be used to dealing with them. It is also the longest venomous snake in the world.<br>  <br>  Saltwater crocodile vs green anaconda - crocodile wins. One bite and it's goodnight Vienna for the snake.<br>  <br>  Killer whale vs great white shark - the killer whale would probably win, being stronger and more intelligent, although the shark is swifter and could triumph if it got a large bite in early on, particularly as it would not have to worry about surfacing to breathe as the whale would.<br>  <br>  Saltwater crocodile vs great white shark - in deep water, the shark wins, hands down. It's faster and more agile, and has no need to surface in order to breathe as the crocodile must. In shallow water, however, the crocodile has the advantage - it can move about more easily than the shark and is fine out of water. If it could drag the shark out of the water it would win.|`|pPI04R8saa	550 lbs bengal tiger<br>  300 lbs american crocodile<br>  30 lbs wolverine<br>  500 lbs american black bear<br>  200 lbs leopard<br>  don't know<br>  3 ton rhinoceros<br>  150 lbs gray wolf<br>  2 kg indian mongoose<br>  king cobra<br>  23 feet saltwater crocodile<br>  Average killer whale<br>  great white shark<br>  because their better fighters|`|b7xWAjRUaa	550 lbs barbary lion vs 550 lbs bengal tiger - Bengal tiger.

F6IOLf3Aaa	I find Rollin's book very interesting idea and, it's along the line of thought that I have been developing for several years now.<br>  <br>  The hypothesis that I have been attempting to form is: everything in the universe, including all dynamic matter and energy within it, is just a distant phase-transitioned version of, or recreation of, the Big Bang universe itself.  If you look at the cosmology behind the origin of the universe, the singularity, inflation, expansion, cooling, breaking of the symmetry of the four forces of nature, you can start to see certain patterns that continuously show up in our 4D realm.  Here's an example: the universe started out in a very, very tiny high-energy low entropy symmetrical state, expanded rapidly, differentiates into a mature universe, grows and continues to expand.  Now one day when all the energy in the universe equals all the entropy in the universe, it dies.<br>  Now, let's take a look at life: it also starts out as a tiny high-energy, low entropy symmetrical spect, grows rapidly, differentiates into a mature being, grows and continues to develop. When all of the energy in the body equals the entropy in that body, it dies.<br>  This is no coincidence. There is a quantum connection between all things in nature, I feel.<br>  There are many, many more patterns like the above example.<br>  <br>  Isn't it interesting that, on average, the universe is very much just empty space.  Look at the atom, at the atomic and subatomic level, it is also pretty much just empty space.<br>  <br>  The galaxy web gets more defined, as galaxies flow into and then down the filaments, forming galaxy clusters where they intersect.<br>  <br>  In the CNS, young neurons find their place in the brain by following pathways (filaments) layed out for them by prevous glia cells during embryogenesis. They form clusters of neural networks.<br>  <br>  And there are many, many more such examples.<br>  <br>  What separates dynamic events taking place in our large 4D world from those occurring at the cosmic quantum level is the "phase-transitions, the cooling of the universe and the slowing of energy, I think.<br>  <br>  I believe that if all matter and energy in the universe should happen to speed back up to where the four forces were unified, all of reality around us, including us, would collapse back into it original quantum wave function state.<br>  <br>  In terms of animal and human consciousness -- the concept is the same. The only reason that consciousness developed and evolved in the first place is because of quantum uncertainty and time dilation as the principle factors in nature leading to the "illusion" of awareness or consciousness.<br>  <br>  Take the origin of life and its ultimate evolution: what was the spark that pulled the molecules together and ultimately got life started?  It was likely, in my opinion, quantum virtual particles dropping into and out of the vacuum in the form of matter/antimatter, annihilation and release of pure energy and other forms of particles.  Chance entanglement may also have played some role in the process.  Evolution is just based upon scaled up phase-transitioned quantum effects --- particles bump into each other all of the time, exchance photons, energy, and other different kind of particles get formed as a result.<br>  <br>  Kind of see what I'm attempting to describe here?  The cosmic phase-transitions are the key to understanding all dynamic matter and energy, and may be the key to a unified field theory of everything.<br>  <br>  I'm still at the stage of gathering physical data in terms of describing their relationships (classical and quantum) by way of patterns.  I haven't as yet developed the mathematics for this but I'm in the process of making that happen.<br>  <br>  A really good book along these lines is:<br>  <br>  THE ROAD TO REALITY: A Complete Guide To The Laws Of The Universe<br>  by Roger Penrose<br>  ISBN: 987-0-679-45443-4<br>  <br>  It's a long difficult read (requires a lot of math and abstract thought) but well worth the effort.<br>  <br>  Other sources of possible interest:<br>  <br>  Great Courses<br>  The Teaching Company<br>  www.TEACH12.com/sc<br>  1-800-832-2412<br>  <br>  Really, really great science programs on DVD<br>  <br>  MathtutorDVD.com<br>  <a href="http://www.mathtutordvd.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mathtutordvd.com/</a><br>  <br>  Excellent refresher course in mathematics.<br>  ---------------<br>  Check them out.|`|4CMENEKnaa	First off, I think this is all nonsense, but I love nonsense.<br>  <br>  The next step will be electronic consciousness based on quantum entanglement computing that is able to actively control which quantum wave form to collapse to reality.  So, what will happen is that the first QEC artificial intelligence, in the instant it is created, will realize its power and instantaneously realize that should there ever be a second QEC AI, it would collapse reality to a state where it was the only one in existence.  Therefore, as an act of self-defense, it would collapse reality to the one where it (the 1st QEC AI) were the only "living" thing in the universe, since only life can generate a QEC AI to begin with.  <br>  <br>  We need not worry about this actually happening however, because if it is possible, it would have happened long before now and the universe would be a sterile place inhabited by the lone QEC AI.  In fact, the lone QEC AI would be in effect able to travel in time to destroy all life before it were created, so the fact that we are here demonstrates it will never be created.  Which means my theory is nonsense, which is where I came in.<br>  <br>  hth
1nYasMYqaa	First, let's pretend the book did not say that the answer is less than 70. There are 2 possible cases. Given that the hypotenuse of a right triangle (or the side opposite the right angle) is always the longest side...<br>  <br>  Case I:<br>  <br>  The legs (sides adjacent to the hypotenuse) are 70 and 74. You must figure out the hypotenuse.<br>  <br>  Case II:<br>  <br>  The hypotenuse is 74. One leg is 70. You must figure out the length of the other leg.<br>  <br>  Since the hypotenuse is the longest side, Case I cannot be true. In Case I, the hypotenuse is greater than 74, whereas the book says the unknown length must be less than 70.<br>  <br>  Let's move on to Case II. You might want to draw the triangle, if you think it helps you.<br>  <br>  We will use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the missing length.<br>  <br>  The Pythagorean Theorem: a2+b2=c2 in a right triangle, where a and b are legs and c is the hypothenuse.<br>  <br>  Let's plug in numbers into the Pythagorean Theorem with a as the missing leg:<br>  a2+b2=c2<br>  a2+702=742<br>  a2+4900=5476<br>  a2=576<br>  a=±26<br>  But of course, a can't be negative. Therefore, a, the missing side, must be 26.<br>  <br>  Note: Solving for non-right triangles is more complex. It usually involves the use of the law of sines and/or the law of cosines.|`|rNNHwCLZaa	Okay, so how you answer this question is with the Pythagorus theorem.<br>  <br>  This is what the Pythagorus theorem is: For right angled triangles, the largest side (or the side opposite to the right angle, called the hypotenuse) squared, equals the sum of the squared smaller sides.<br>  <br>  Let c be the largest side, or hypotenuse. Let a & b be the other two sides.<br>  <br>  So, c^2 = a^2 + b^2.<br>  Then, since the largest side is 74 (because the unknown side is smaller than 70), it shall be the hypotenuse.<br>  <br>  74^2 = 70^2 + b^2<br>  5476 = 4900 + b^2<br>  <br>  Take 4900 from both sides<br>  5476-4900= b^2<br>  576 = b^2.<br>  <br>  Then you take the square root of both sides to find be.<br>  Square root of 576 = b<br>  Since the square root of 576 is 24, the length of the unknown side is 24.|`|9pbF9YV6aa	Pythagoras Theorem<br>  <br>  a^2 + b^2 = c^2<br>  70^2 + b^2=5476<br>  4900 + b^2= 5476<br>  b^2=5476- 4900<br>  b^2= 576<br>  b=24<br>  The last side is 24.|`|gMSaPvqkaa	it's by pythogoras theorem if the answer is less than 70 then the missing length is not the hpotenes so it'll be for example <br>  (ab)^2= (74)^2 - (70)^2|`|1e8f9a70b81ba191472efb5cd4e71038aa	742 = 702 + x2<br>  x2 = 742 - 702<br>  x2 = 576<br>  x = 24|`|7JzqsICcaa	missing lenght=(74^2-70^2)^1/2=24

t5Nrj6Txaa	Thanks, I'd never heard of this until now.  Researching it, I also found the "Pioneer anomaly", which is also interesting.  All in all, it seems that gravity is stronger at larger distances than present theories describe.  See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rota...</a> .  In short, I feel that our present models of gravitation are local in nature and do not extend out to large distances.  If real, the Allais effect could be illuminating some of the shortcomings in our models of gravity.  Of course, you could say that our theories are just fine, and that the observations are just due to an astronomical joke called dark matter . . .|`|KHeR3hGIaa	Wikipedia seems to do a pretty good job of that ...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allais_effect" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allais_effe...</a><br>  <br>  And as for contemporary interpretations, it seems that (based on the wikipedia article) it's not being taken very seriously, and nobody has reproduced it in 30 years.

vvqSxBLGaa	A local maximum is a point on the graph where the points immediately either side of it are lower than that point.  It doesn't matter if there is a point higher than it somewhere else along the line.<br>  <br>  A local minimum is the equivalent point where the points on either side are higher than the point in question.  Again, it doesn't matter if there is a lower point somewhere else.  One way to think about is is to rest an imaginary marble in the line.  It will role along the line until it finds a local minimum.  It may not be the lowest point on the line overall, but it has to roll "uphill" to escape the local minimum.<br>  <br>  You can have more than one of each.  The number of local minima and maxima can be equal to each other or differ by one either way, and they always have to alternate between minimum and maximum.  So if you have identified say three local minima and only a single local maxima you know you have gone wrong somewhere

UkjnSyAvaa	Since there is no way to investigate parallel universes, NASA isn't doing it. Anyway, there's no reason to think that there are such things. If anybody IS trying to investigate that, then it would not be in NASA.<br>  <br>  Jinns (genies) are a silly superstition. NASA doesn't investigate  such things. And no, UFOs are not jinns. UFO investigation is not conducted by NASA, either, since there has never been any evidence that an alien craft has ever visited our planet. If a UFO was reported because of a misinterpreted natural thing in space, NASA would know about it. Venus, for example, is the most common cause of UFO reports.<br>  <br>  Quranic research? I've seen some of the claims made about that. It's absurd. Of course there have been many Muslims trying to convince the rest of the world that certain verses metaphorically implied things in the future that have only been discovered more recently, but this is just as much nonsense as bible codes and Nostradamus interpretations. It's a ploy to get gullible non-Muslims to believe that Allah is the one true God and that Islam is therefore the only true religion.<br>  <br>  NASA investigates space and engages in space travel. It deals with the REAL universe, not the kind of stuff you would typically find under the heading of "unsolved mysteries."<br>  <br>  (I think Majors Nelson and Healey showed that NASA isn't actively engaged in genie research.)|`|KHSOVxViaa	Perhaps they could launch an expensive mission to hunt for Nibiru...<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  According to that site, NASA are considering that alternative life forms, such as non-water based life could exist.<br>  <br>  There is absolutely nothing about them studying Djinns, Koranic research, or parallel universes.

Nitrogen is an inert gas that does absolutely nothing to enhance the gasoline's ability to burn. In fact, it does just the opposite. Don't be misled... it's merely a sales ploy. <br>  <br>  Gasoline manufacturers have been doing this off and on for as long as I've been around.

I'm afraid that the answer is, like old-fashioned leaded fuel, the nitrogen goes back into the air, and ultimately the soil and water. The last thing our streams, ponds, and lakes need is more nitrogen. This will likely result in increased algal blooms and poorer water quality whereever this fuel is burned.<br>  Shell should be happy that they managed to ram this fuel additive through Bush's EPA before it faced any significant scrutiny. It's likely that it would not have been approved by an Obama EPA.|`|jwl08lOqaa	The benefits are primarily financial for the company.  80% of people who hear the ad will think 'cool, that's good for my car'.  1/2 those people will remember it and probably stop in at their local shell station as a result.<br>  <br>  50% of the people can be convinced of anything most of the time.<br>  <br>  If you want more nitrogen in you car, lean out the fuel mixture so that more air gets in . . . . being that air is 78% nitrogen.<br>  <br>  If is smells like bs . . . . chances are it is.

To be more general is a reaction between a fuel ans air. Fuel could be hydrogen or other source.<br>  <br>  Chemical reaction is the reacion between two elements or substances which involves a creation or destruction of chemical bond.A chemical reaction is a process that always results in the interconversion of chemical substances. The substance or substances initially involved in a chemical reaction are called reactants. Chemical reactions are usually characterized by a chemical change, and they yield one or more products, which usually have properties different from the reactants.<br>  <br>  Neutralisation is in general the reaction between an acid and base leading in a neutral solution, i.e. with a pH close to 7 or so. In chemistry, neutralization is a chemical reaction (also called a water forming reaction since a water molecule is formed during the process) in which an acid and a base or alkali (soluble base) react to produce salt and water (H2O).|`|clltSfwxaa	A Chemical reaction is where a reacion occurs between two elements or substances which involves a creation or destruction of chemical bond

It's just too soon; we 're only really starting to explore the solar system, so using its resources is still some way off.<br>  <br>  More likely we'll develop efficient launchers sooner, such as hypersonic 'spaceplane' craft that can fly from the surface using oxygen in the air for most of they journey.

M1D4iAuWaa	On Wednesday, Craig Busch had his operators licence taken off him by MAF. <br>  <br>  The Lion Man became famous through a TV show that screened in 100 countries, but a MAF investigation found his 40 big cats in insanitary and crowded conditions.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A source has told ONE News at least 30 big cats have had their claws removed.<br>  <br>  Declawing cats is a controversial issue and is banned in the United States with many saying it's a cruel and unnecessary procedure.<br>  <br>  A MAF email backs up the claim, saying it's inevitable that a legal notice will be given to the vet that declawed felines at the park in the past.<br>  <br>  One of their animal experts says declawing is generally acknowledged as an unacceptable practice.<br>  <br>  MAF says it cannot release details about the declawing as the investigation is still being carried out, and will not be over till the end of the year.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, the dispute between Busch and his mother is going before the courts and a civil case is due to start in a little more than a week.<br>  <a href="http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/lion-man-loses-right-run-zion-2304830" rel="nofollow">http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/lion-man...</a>|`|uPVnqbE8aa	I don't know about this jerk, but I'm glad to see something is being done about him.<br>  I've worked with all the big cats, and small ones too for that matter, and it is most definitely NOT good to remove their claws.  Once this is done the animal has no way of defending itself, not against humans, but against each other.<br>  These cats should not be in captivity in the first place and man is doing the world and the environment a great injustice by doing so.  <br>  Example:  I cared for two Jaguars once where the female had been a former pet owned by a movie starlet.  When it reached maturity it turned on her, so of course it ended up in a zoo.  The male Jaguar would often get into scraps with the female and she would get beaten up pretty badly because she could not drive him off (no claws).<br>  The only animals I am "for" getting declawed are domestic House Cats.  They have no need for claws and will only destroy the furniture or scratch up the baby.|`|YgRb598naa	hmmmmph.|`|oNHXrcDoaa	I find that difficult to believe. There wouldn't be much point in it - a lion without claws is just as dangerous to humans as one without. They kill with their teeth, not their claws, and could smash your skull with one blow from their paws, claws or no claws.<br>  <br>  BWANA, domestic cats need their claws just as much as wild ones, if not more. If a cat gets into a fight with another cat, how can it defend itself with no claws? If it gets chased by a big dog, how can it climb to safety without claws? If people are going to keep cats, they should accept them as they are. If someone is so house-proud that they're worried a cat will ruin their furniture, they just shouldn't get a cat, not get one and mutilate it for their own convenience.

InoTLoBMaa	Jasminum sambac (syn. Nyctanthes sambac) is a species of jasmine native to southern Asia, in India, Philippines, Myanmar and Sri Lanka.<br>  <br>  Common names include Arabian Jasmine, Mogra (Hindi and Marathi), Mallikā (Sanskrit), Kampupot, Melati (Malay and Indonesian Language), Sampaguita (Filipino), Mallepuvvu (Telugu), Mallikaipu (Tamil), Mallige (Kannada) and Kaliyan (Urdu). The botanic name sambac is derived from a misapplication of the Sanskrit name champaka, which refers to the fragrant flowered shrub Michelia champaca.<br>  <br>  It is an evergreen vine or shrub reaching up to 1-3 m tall. The leaves are opposite or in whorls of three, simple (not pinnate, like most other jasmines), ovate, 4-12.5 cm long and 2-7.5 cm broad. The flowers are produced in clusters of 3-12 together, strongly scented, with a white corolla 2-3 cm diameter with 5-9 lobes. The flowers open at night, and close in the morning. The fruit is a purple-black berry 1 cm in diameter.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sampaguita plant cuttings are easy to root. More plants means more blooms at one given time and the more fragrance! <br>  Plant them in 3 gal pots. The plants are both full sun or shade tolerant. <br>  Use a good potting soil (with lots of organic matter like peat moss and humus). <br>  If the plant is exposed to certain conditions for a long time it gets used to them, and may get stressed after the conditions change significantly. However, gradual change should be fine. <br>  The smaller the plant, the easier it gets adjusted to new conditions. <br>  The potting mix must be well-drained. Never use top soil or garden soil for potting to avoid rotting in roots. <br>  All Sampaguita plants need lots of light for blooming. Bright light along with regular fertilization will encourage blooming. <br>  Move the plant into a larger pot every spring or when the plant overgrows the pot.

In a large bottle, the pressure is less because the air that you squeeze is small compared to all the air in the bottle.

AA10335036	First you need to redefine nodes and antinodes.<br>  In a standing wave:<br>  At P node, P = 0, x = antinode = max or min disp.<br>  At P antinode, P = max or min, x = node = 0 disp.<br>  We have to be clear about what's under discussion. Nodes and antinodes refer to locations along, e.g., a column of longitudinally vibrating air in a tube (it could also be along a transversely vibrating string), not temporal variation of a passing wave at some given point. So when you block one end of the tube, you create a displacement node, and since the blockage can sustain pressure it's a pressure antinode. Where the tube is unblocked, air is free to move longitudinally and you can't have significant pressure. In a standing wave you have resonance, and nodes and antinodes form even without blockage (e.g., open tube). In the simplest case of this (fundamental resonance), a single displacement node is in the center and air vibrates in opposite directions to either side of the node. You could put a blockage at the node and nothing would change. See the ref., and remember that these diagrams portray longitudinal displacement as transverse displacement. <br>  The 90-degree relationship between pressure and displacement (pressure nodes 1/4 wavelength away from displacement nodes) basically means that no work is done by the wave; this is a system that stores energy but doesn't move it anywhere except locally, trading elastic potential energy for kinetic velocity energy, similarly to a freely oscillating spring-mass system or electrical inductance-capacitance system.<br>  In a traveling wave, displacement and pressure are in-phase, and work is done wherever the wave finally is absorbed. So in that context your idea of pressure and displacement antinodes coinciding is correct. <br>  I hope this helps.

RgSCstkAaa	Actually, the urine is where you want the uric acid; you certainly don't want it building up in the body and causing the symptoms of gout. If the urinary concentrations of uric acid are high, it is because the blood concentrations are high and need treating. The treatment depends on whether this is a chronic situation or an acute attack, and on what caused it in the first place. In all cases though, it is a good idea to drink a lot, to promote urine flow, and to restrict acidic drinks like fruit juices.|`|65Rzxlv2aa	There is a reason that untrained people should not be self-medicating.. they are too stupid to understand chemical reactions.<br>  <br>  You can DRINK CRANBERRY JUICE.. it CHANGES the Ph of the Urine from an ACID to a BASE... and you can LOOK THOSE TERMS UP.|`|EN32vSsCaa	Vergavibar, you fit your own category of those who do not understand chemical reactions.<br>  Cranberry juice contains hippuric acid.

In order to do this, each locus has to be variable (i.e. have several alleles) with a good spread of allele frequencies. Loci were selected as forensic tools on this basis. The problem was that in the countries where this was done, the sampling to study loci initially was carried out in the majority population e.g. White British/European in the UK.<br>  <br>  The problem is that human populations are hugely subdivided and so a locus which performs well in a White Londoner say, may be of no use whatsoever in someone who comes from a different population background, where it may have few alleles or one allele at high frequency.

OXw0rv4Saa	I'm glad for you!  You sound excited and ambitious about your chosen profession.<br>  <br>  The most important classes to take are biology-type/anatomy/phisiology courses- you need an excellent understanding of how the body works to be a good physician.  Of course a good understanding of math and chemistry is fundamental to understanding how drugs work, and even english is important- you need to be able to speak correctly and fluently- not stumble over complex sentences, etc.<br>  <br>  Really, all of the basic high school courses are important.  once you get to college, you can speak with advisors in the pre-med department to help you design a college curriculum.<br>  <br>  You can also do volunteer work at hospitals and nursing homes to get exposed to the medical world.|`|x9VfUMMAaa	genius much?<br>  take a chill pill.<br>  you probably will become a doctor if you try hard, you dont need to do this.|`|3Bw1yT85aa	Those are some impressive grades! <br>  <br>  Your GPA will enable you to get into an excellent college if you keep it up. But medical schools do not base you application off of your high school grades. It is all your GPA in college and how well you do on your MCAT's. <br>  <br>  I would mainly focus on courses in the sciences as well as mathematics. But do not let all of your studies take control of you. Medical schools like to see well-rounded people not just complete academics. So I would also get involved in a sport or extra curricular activities if you have not already done so.<br>  <br>  You are still very young and seem like you are on the right path. While your young you should study hard, but have a great time and relax during your childhood years Once you get into medical school you will have barely anytime to relax. So cherish your time while your young!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|5f75de4cef16ee724cdcb0a718bf76a3aa	Congratulations on your admirable achievements so far. Your excellent grades will enable you to go to a top-notch university, one that has a respected pre-med program. You can concentrate on the biological sciences then. For now, continue to study and take a wide range of courses in language, arts and science. Broaden your horizons. Don't focus just on one area of knowledge at your young age.<br>  <br>  As another said, take a chill pill. Smell the roses.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

HkCXtuC3aa	In a rocket combustion chamber the rocket exhaust is forced out of the nozzle by the rapid expansion of exhaust gases and the directing shape of the rocket nozzle. The equal and opposite reaction is that the rocket nozzle (and hence the shuttle it is attached to) is forced in the other direction.|`|KHSOVxViaa	The Shuttle doesn't 'fly' in space like a bird, it uses reaction mass.<br>  <br>  It has rocket motors that burn fuel in a bell-shaped chamber, ejecting hot gases at high speed.  This creates the reactive force that pushes the Shuttle in the opposite direction.<br>  <br>  Newtons Laws: mv is conserved,  F=ma.  During an engine burn the continuous gas ejection causes a force, the Shuttle accelerates the other way.<br>  <br>  There are large motors for adjusting orbit and causing re-entry, and also an array of small motors that are used for attitude control (orientation) and low-velocity translation.  This "Reaction Control System" (RCS) is invaluable for the fine adjustments needed to dock with a satellite or ISS.|`|vvqSxBLGaa	It throws rocket propellant backwards.  Newton's third law and the law of conservation of momentum both necessitate that the shuttle feels a force pushing it forwards as a result.<br>  <br>  Spelling: vacuum.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	Doesn't anyone study basic physics in school any more?

Although, the thrusters are more efficient.
pDUuZAnGaa	Use Work-Energy Theorem:<br>  <br>  Work = change in kinetic energy<br>  Work = Force x distance<br>  <br>  Set them equal:<br>  <br>  change in kinetic energy = F x d<br>  F = change in kinetic energy / distance<br>  F = [ 1/2 (92 kg) (12 - 0)^2 ] / [ 26 m ]<br>  F = 6624 J / 26 m<br>  F = 254.77 N<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Ripeforchange, your answer is incorrect. The relationships between those variables are not so simple, specifically distance and time. If you want to do it that way you must use a Kinematics equation. This also shows why work-energy is so efficient as it takes you straight to the answer and no need to worry about signs because it's a scalar (in this case that doesn't matter though).<br>  <br>  Using kinematics equation:<br>  <br>  V(final)^2 = V(initial)^2 + 2(a)(change in distance)<br>  <br>  (12 m/s)^2 = (0) + 2(a)(26 m)<br>  a = 2.769 m/s^2<br>  F = (92kg) * (2.769 m/s^2)<br>  F = 254.77 N.... again|`|JsiELu6xaa	Alright I think I did this right. The answer I got was 511.52 N. The method I used was this:<br>  Force=Mass x Acceleration <br>  Acceleration = Change in Velocity / Time<br>  Velocity = Distance / Time<br>  The Velocity achieved is 12 meters per second and the distance is equal to 26 meters So using the 3rd equation we can find our time variable which turned out to be 2.16 s. Now with our time we can find the acceleration. The change in velocity was 0 (rest) + 12 (the final velocity achieved) so we divide 12 by 2.16 to get our acceleration which came out to 5.56 M/S^2. Now that we have our acceleration we simply plug the values into the Net Force equation, F= 92 Kg x 5.56 M/S^2 which means that F= 511.52

The monks wear traditional simple orange robes and have very few material possessions.<br>  <br>  The Potala Palace in Lhasa, once the seat of the Tibetan government and the winter residence of the Dalai Lama. The present palace was built in the 17th century on the site of its 7th century forerunner and is now a museum.<br>  <br>  Street in Lhasa, Tibet. Lhasa is the capital of Tibet, and the holy city of Lamaism. Following Tibet's annexation by the Chinese in 1950–51, an increasing number of Chinese settlers moved to the region, provoking conflict and resentment.<br>  <br>  Potala Palace, Lhasa, Tibet. The palace is the former winter residence of the Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 following the Chinese annexation. When the office was first founded in the 15th century, the Dalai Lama had a purely religious role. However, in the 17th century (when the palace was built), the fifth Dalai Lama united Tibet politically and assumed a temporal as well as spiritual role.<br>  <br>  Potala Palace, former home of the Dalai Lama, Lhasa, Tibet. Construction of the present palace began in 1645 during the reign of the fifth Dalai Lama; it was built on the foundations of an earlier palace dating to 637.Capital of the autonomous region of Tibet, China, at 5,000 m/16,400 ft; population (2000) 171,700. Traditional products include handicrafts and light industrial goods. The holy city of Lamaism, Lhasa was closed to Westerners until 1904, when members of a British expedition led by Col Francis E Younghusband visited the city. It was annexed with the rest of Tibet 1950–51 by China, and the spiritual and temporal head of state, the Dalai Lama, fled in 1959 after a popular uprising against Chinese rule.

4fWZL4TRaa	Damn fine question alright...<br>  <br>  I am sure there is some induction into the field windings, but the relative power ratios are such that it isn't an issue in the "normal" generator we know. These are known as synchronous single fed generators.<br>  <br>  Yes the field is usually from an exciter, but that can be the AC load in certain cases, (see below) or taken from the AC output and rectified to provide the DC field. Some have all this sorted out so they need no brushes. The exciter armature and the generator field are in the rotor, along with the diodes.<br>  <br>  There are double fed machines, where the "field" is excited by AC, the load, and also generates about half the total power. The output frequency can be different to the rotational speed.<br>  <br>  There are induction generators (asynchronous) which are like induction motors. The field is induced from the armature windings. It starts to generate when going slightly faster than synchronous speed.<br>  <br>  I guess (without giving a straight answer) that it depends on whether the fields are opposing or not at the time the poles are passing each other.<br>  <br>  Hope this at least gives a path to follow for you to do more research.
15mbP1hqaa	Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction during which one or more water molecules are split into hydrogen and hydroxide ions which may go on to participate in further reactions. It is the type of reaction that is used to break down certain polymers, especially those made by step-growth polymerization. Such polymer degradation is usually catalysed by either acid i.e concentrated sulphuric acid [H2SO4] or alkali i.e. sodium hydroxide [NaOH] attack, often increasing with their strength or pH.<br>  <br>  Hydrolysis is distinct from hydration, where hydrated molecule does not "lyse" (break into two new compounds). It should not be confused with hydrogenolysis, a reaction of hydrogen.<br>  <br>  Hydrolysis is used in industry for precipitation reactions while are very useful in analystical chemistry for identification of substances, as normally, hydrated ions have distinctive colors.

UV can penetrate thin clouds and cause a sunburn even on an overcast day.  X-rays and gamma rays are even shorter waves and far more penetrating than UV.  Although perhaps 15 minutes of exposure to full sunlight is healthful, providing natural vitamin D, extended exposure may damage the skin.  Dark skin resists sunlight and vitamin D supplements may be in order (especially D-3).  Mediterranean skin develops a tan while being exposed.  Scandinavian (light) skin develops a redness from blood drawn to the skin then a redness from too much exposure then develops a tan (as though later in a darkroom!).  But do your own research for your own type skin.

DyHpuiR8aa	Haemoglobin molecules carry oxygen throughout the body to be used in a number of processes - respiration in particular.<br>  <br>  Oxygen enters the lungs, then is "picked up" by haemoglobin molecules in the blood within pulmonary veins.  The pulmonary veins carry the blood back to the heart, where it is then pumped through the systemic system, via the Aorta (the artery that carrys oxygenated blood throughout the body).<br>  <br>  From the aorta, the oxygenated (or "red" blood, as it is sometimes known) enters the capillaries, where diffusion of oxygen and other substances occur.  From here, the oxygen can be used in cellular respiration - in muscles, for example.<br>  <br>  The blood in the capillaries therefore loses all the oxygen it once carried, so is now referred to as "blue" blood.  From the capillaries, it enters the Vena Cava (the vein that carries the deoxygenated blood back to the heart).  From the heart, the blood is pumped back to the lungs, through the pulmonary artery - where the blood "picks up" yet more oxygen to repeat the process.<br>  <br>  I hope that made sense - remember than arteries carry blood AWAY from the heart, and veins carry blood TO the heart. (Hence, why veins appear blue)<br>  <br>  I hope this helped.|`|GgClh7dbaa	Here's the full, detailed story. Just eliminate whatever detail you consider excess:<br>  <br>  From the external nares (nostrils), air, which is usually 21% oxygen mixed with 79% nitrogen, enters into the nasal cavity within the nose and passes over the nasal turbinates (shown but not labeled in the first link below) where it is warmed and humidified, and where nasal hairs remove larger particles of particulate matter from it. <br>  <br>  The air then enters the upper part of the posterior oral cavity called the nasopharynx and flows down into the lower throat, or laryngopharynx. <a href="http://fau.pearlashes.com/anatomy/Chapter%2036/Chapter%2036_files/image013.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://fau.pearlashes.com/anatomy/Chapte...</a><br>  <br>  From here it passes through the epiglottis into the larynx and through the vocal cords contained therein before entering the cartilagenous trachea, where a further set of hairs covered in a thin sheet of mucus removes smaller particulate matter missed in the upper respiratory tract. <br>  <br>  From the trachea, the air passes into one of the two mainstem bronchi and then proceeds further down the respiratory tree which continues to branch into ever smaller generations of bronchioles. Finally, the air enters the terminal bronchioles, which deliver the inspired air into the air sacs, or alveoli, of the lung tissue. <a href="http://training.seer.cancer.gov/module_anatomy/images/illu_conducting_passages.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://training.seer.cancer.gov/module_a...</a><br>  <br>  The oxygen in the alveolar air then passes through the alveolar epithelial cells, through a basement membrane, and finally through the endothelial cells lining the pulmonary capillaries and enters the bloodstream. The oxygen molecule diffuses through the plasma and into an erythrocyte (red blood cell) where it finds hemoglobin with which to bind.<br>  <br>  The freshly oxygenated blood in the pulmonary capillaries empties into the pulmonary veins, left atrium and left ventricle in that order, and then out of the heart into the arterial system beginning with the aorta.

Here, the oxygen molecules dissociate from the hemoglobin and diffuse out of the erythrocyte into the plasma, then out of the plasma and capillary into the interstitial fluid surrounding the myocytes (muscle cells) into which they diffuse to support aerobic cellular respiration. <a href="http://www.evgn.org/images/vessels.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.evgn.org/images/vessels.gif</a>|`|Z7028vf2aa	it goes by the arteries. arteries away, veins towards|`|U7oJrc3faa	Oxygen gets to our muscles by cellular respiration.|`|J2IWbhSvaa	1) Breathe in.<br>  <br>  2) Oxygen travels down the windpipe (I forget the scientific name) to the lungs.<br>  <br>  3) It ends up in an alveolus.<br>  <br>  4) Gaseous exchange occurs where the carbon dioxide comes from the blood into the lungs and the oxygen goes into the blood.<br>  <br>  5) It travels in the blood to the muscles and respiration occurs. :)<br>  <br>  Kind of simplified but i'm only in year 9 so you can't complain ;)

Since he doesn't understand why he can't get through, he keeps trying.<br>  <br>  The other thing that frequently happens is because of a mirror effect.<br>  Depending on what type of glass you have and the lighting in the room etc. the glass maybe creating a mirror effect for the bird.  Many bird species are very territorial, and if he sees himself reflected in the glass he perceives this as a rival and will attempt to attack it.<br>  <br>  To stop the first instance from happening you can put stickers or something on the glass so the bird can see it.<br>  <br>  To stop the mirror effect is a little tricky.

0ENFApaAaa	Le Chatelier's principle states that a system will react to a stimulus in such a way as to reduce the effect of the stimulus.<br>  <br>  Halving the volume has the effect of raising the pressure (Boyle's law), so in this case the stimulus is an increase in pressure.<br>  <br>  If the reaction proceeds from left to right, 4 volumes of gaseous mixture will condense to 2 volumes of ammonia.  This will reduce the pressure.  So we deduce that a shift in this direction will counteract the effect of raising the pressure by compression, and therefore according to Le Chatelier, the reaction will proceed from left to right.<br>  <br>  This answer makes the assumption that the temperature remains constant.

mFqDwpfAaa	Yes, banana does contains fat, but only 0.6 grams of fat.<br>  <br>  The calorie content of bananas are low to medium. A small sized (peeled) banana contains about 80 calories. A medium sized banana contains about 100 calories and a large banana contains about 115 calories. (Compared with about 50 calories in Apple or Kiwi fruit.)<br>  <br>  It is also interesting to note that the composition of carbohydrate calories change on ripening, the sugar levels rise and the starch levels fall as a banana ripens. It means that bananas are probably easier to digest when the more ripe and yellow the fruit becomes. One good place to store banana is refrigerator. In the fridge, the banana may turn brown/black. However, this is only a cosmetic change. The interior regions of ir will stay nice and fresh.<br>  <br>  The calories in a banana are digested slowly and help supply the body with a steady source of energy. Bananas are great for an energy boost if eaten about an hour before physical activity.<br>  <br>  I HOPE This helps !
AA10800608	Ok, the first to think of is that sometimes an 'x' is just a place holder.  Substitution which you will hear about if you haven't just means put the real thing in.  Sometimes it will be an expression of the other unknown (y in this case) and sometimes it is as simple as 6<br>  <br>  So, if we replace 3x with 3*6 we get<br>  18 - 2y = 10<br>  <br>  Now the next thing we do is to get y on one side and the other numbers on the other side.  We do this because adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing can be done to both sides of the equation and it will still be true.<br>  <br>  So, subtract 18 from both sides and we get<br>  18 - 18 - 2y = 10 - 18 = <br>  -2y = -8<br>  <br>  The same idea is not used to divide by whatever is in front of the y, in this case -2<br>  -2y/-2 = -8/-2 or y = 4<br>  <br>  The thing that is especially important while you are getting the hang of this is to double check the answer(those of us that do this, solved the problem in our head and don't bother double checking.)<br>  <br>  3*6 - 2*4 = 18 - 8 = 10 <= this confirms we have the right answer.

JDn5UxFxaa	I've not graduated from high school yet, but heres what I know.<br>  An ovum (egg cell) from the organism is extracted and the nucleus with a haploid number of chromosomes is removed. Then a normal cell (like a liver cell or something) with the diploid number of chromosomes, is extracted and its nucleus is transferred to that of the egg cell. This 'zygote' is implanted into the uterus of a third organism and a clone is born.<br>  So basically, we only need 1 female animal, and the animal that we want to clone. If the animal is female, then just that one will do.<br>  A problem with natural reproduction with a small gene pool is that many genetic diseases will arise because its inbreeding (like cheetahs). Also, when cloning, the actual 'age' of the clone is as old as the original when it is born. This means that the DNA is pretty degraded because during mitosis, some DNA (especially from the telomeres) are not replicated. So the clone will suffer from a lot of age related diseases.

UkjnSyAvaa	Time is what you measure with a clock.<br>  Distance is what you measure with a stick.<br>  <br>  (Before you get too critical of my answer, I stole it from Einstein. There is great wisdom and insight in that seemingly trivial answer.)<br>  <br>  The Big Bang is a theory which states that space-time expanded and cooled, leading to matter and energy as we know them today. There is evidence to support this view and no other cosmological model to date matches the evidence better. How it initially got started, nobody knows and IMO, never will.<br>  <br>  Time travel is a fantasy. The physical laws of the universe prevent it.|`|AA10202389	I think every possible combination in the universe already exists out so we choose one a different path as often as we like, know how and 'believe' we can. If we have the perception that to go across the street, 1200 muscle cells need to contract 211 times to take 59 steps to get across the street, we see how many steps we have to take as so much time. We could actually just be across the street or in the past, if we want to, as soon as we learn to handle it without ruining, fragmenting the picture. It doesn't change the past, as every possible combination already exists, we are just going to a different, lets say mental image and choosing to look at other things we might do in that present time. Easy, huh. I can't go across the street because I have to do the computer here, unless I pick a place that has portable computers and a place across the street and type over there or go to the place where this is already typed. <br>  Now the concept of place is only and image and not a place at all. You change images or pictures to focus on. Reality is a fantasy and fantasy is reality. There is no past, but we can perceive it with all its reality and it's real to us or say it isn't so and recreate a different past. The past was how we looked at it and we can look at it that way anytime and we'd say the past is in the present. If you don't see a flaw in that then it must be true.

When the singularity expanded and cooled to a point where the first sub atomic particles appeared, three things happened, one, gravity came into existence, two, space was created, three, motion took place. All that was required for motion to take place was space. With motion there is unknown factor, that factor is speed. When man evolved to the point where he began to study the universe he had already created a clock and invented the word, time. The clock was needed to calculate speed and it served this purpose well, but it has nothing to do with time. Time, like the clock, is a man made thing. One person who answers questions on this site has a favourite interpretation of time, he claims that time is what prevents everything from happening at once. In fact, in my opinion, everything does happen at once, it happens on the cusp of an event. There is no way to measure any lapse of what we call time during this phenomena. It can only be described as, now, it is always now and can never be anything but now. Earth is but a speck in the universe. Why does it need time zones? You must ave concluded by now that in my opiion time is nothing more than a man made concept.|`|8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	Time is the rate of the flow of events relative to each other. If there's a periodic event (an event that happens again and again at equal periods), you can use that as reference and count time based on that event. That's exactly what we do. From the Earth's orbit around the Sun, to the vibrations of electrons in an atom, we use these periodic events to measure the rate at which other events happen.|`|XppFZhChaa	when i do the anal sex?

Grass needs a good deal of water to survive, so when the salt takes some of this water, the grass will die.  That is laymen terms.  The first answer is perfectly described.
Lyjy3xO7aa	They are used to provide water at pressure to a given location.  Initially, they were used for individual buildings, but their use has expanded all the way to entire municipal water districts.<br>  They work by creating an artificial artisian well effect.  The water tower is located and built to be the highest point in the area. A small pump pumps water up into the tank, and a large pipe leads back down and into the water distribution system, creating a siphon.  The water pressure in the tank keeps pushing water volume down the pipe.  This allows for the water to be distributed using gravity instead of large pumps. <br>  Theoretically, if everyone flushed their toilets or took a shower at the same time, you could drain all the water out of the tank faster than it could be refilled, and you would lose your water pressure.  Sometimes that happens.|`|HTmj2BXDaa	Probably the Romans.  Not sure about water towers but they built some serious aquaducts to bring water to Roma.|`|a7758985bc328f86aea63a86e0cd5cfdaa	The principle was probably a Roman idea.<br>  While towers were not used , water was stored in reservoirs at higher elevations than point of use to allow gravity to feet the system via aqueducts.<br>  In NYC you will  still see rooftop tanks to maintain pressure on low rise buildings .<br>  One of the reasons 4 or 5 stories was the maximum height for older structures.<br>  Just a way to maintain pressure in areas where water is pumped rather than gravity fed.

jeMNcPPYaa	Humans are basically monkeys. Millions of years of evolution where to survive long enough to breed you needed to learn the skills of hunting and of defence.<br>  <br>  From this we have many skills that don't really fit into our modern world. One of the key ones is pattern recognition.<br>  <br>  You need to be able to see the Lion in the long grass, you also need to be able to see it at the time you are running to get away. So we can see patterns in the grass, our brain tries its best to turn that pattern into something we recognise, like a lion's face. If it can not that we are safe, if it creates a face then we are given an internal alarm, 'Posible Lion in the grass'.<br>  <br>  The running past a picket fence, where the fence disapears and you can see everything behind it, that is one of the skills learnt in the trees and the long grass of the plains.<br>  <br>  So now, the pattern on the curtains turns into a face, the coat hanger on the door turns into the shoulders of a tall man and so on. Clouds of cause become all kinds of things.<br>  <br>  But not only our eyes have this, our other senses do too. So the sound of boiler filling with water in the night becomes something much less logical. The slight change in temperature, when the radiator went off is detected as a ghostly presence. <br>  <br>  It is posible for these senses to be too sensitive, as in your case. Teach it. When you feel a presence take control of the mind, turn around and look and show your mind that there is nothing there. Remember, if there had been something there and it had wanted to hurt you then it could have done it by now. The reason it hasn't is because it isn't there, your senses are just reacting to slight changes in the air that is all.|`|MeGehliuaa	I feel that way all the time I walk into a specific room in my house.

AA11510145	Compute the double integral <br>  <br>  Dg(x,y)dA   <br>  where g(x,y) = x2 + y2 and D is disk of radius 7 centered at origin. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Solution: Since computing this integral in rectangular coordinates is too difficult, we change to polar coordinates. (We chose polar coordinates since the disk is easily described in polar coordinates.) Let <br>  <br>  T(r,θ) = (r cos θ,r sin θ).   <br>  be the change of variables function from polar coordinates into rectangular coordinates. <br>  Then, by the change of variables formula, the integral becomes <br>  <br>  Dg(x,y)dA = g(T(r,θ))drdθ,   <br>  where D* is the region in the rθ-plane that is mapped by T onto the disk D. In polar coordinates, the disk is described by 0 ≤ r ≤ 7 and 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π, so this is the region D*. <br>  We calculate <br>  <br>  g(T(r,θ)) = g(r cos θ,r sin θ) = r2 cos 2θ + r2 sin 2θ = r2   <br>  (r,θ) = cos θ   <br>  (r,θ) = sin θ   <br>  (r,θ) = -r sin θ   <br>  (r,θ) = r cos θ   <br>  DT(r,θ) =    <br>  det DT(r,θ) = r cos 2θ - (-r) sin 2θ = r(cos 2θ + sin 2θ) = r   <br>  Since r ≥ 0 in D*, we know that  = |r| = r. Therefore the integral is Dg(x,y)dA = ∫ 02π ∫ 07r2rdrdθ   <br>   = ∫ 22π dθ   <br>   = ∫ 22πdθ =    <br>  <br>  Note: In case you have trouble believing the formula that dA becomes dr,dθ, we could motivate the result that, for polar coordinates, dA becomes rdrdθ as follows. <br>  <br>  Chop up the disk into grid corresponding to a grid size in polar coordinates of Δr and Δθ, just as we did for the intro reading. A single “curvy rectangle” with a corner (r,θ) is pictured below. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Let ΔA be area of the “curvy rectangle”. You can see that the area depends on the radius r, since its width is approximately rΔθ and its height is approximately Δr. Hence the area ΔA is approximately rΔrΔθ. I hope that now you can believe that dA becomes rdrdθ when changing variables to polar coordinates.
oEFPRvz7aa	The most likely answer is simply that when you knock it over, it's not moving very fast. When you drop it, it moves faster and faster due to gravity, and then hits the floor with much greater force/energy.

The rules are the same. So the study of how particals behave in space, yields results that have value in a medical lab.<br>  <br>  For resources, it is interesting to know that most of the key elements (I don't know if all are proven in this way) came about in particular stages of the big bang. It isn't all that long ago that we thought our main elements were created on earth.<br>  <br>  So the costs of space exploration do have rewards, the studies may aid in medicine and eventualy in resources but almost certainly in the generation of power without risk to the earth.<br>  <br>  We are standing on a huge power generator, enough power for every electrical object in the world without hardly scratching the surface of the power available.

Many mathematicians tried to find a repeating pattern for Pi till Johann Lambert proved tin 1768 hat there cannot be any such repeating pattern.

9lzNDwhZaa	Most diamonds originate from rocks called 'Kimberlites' that are considered to have risen rapidly from the upper mantle approx 150 km below the earth's surface.<br>  <br>  Within the environment at that depth, under exceptional pressures, diamonds are stable. By rising exceptionally fast from the places of origin, kimberlites CAN retain their diamonds but they often change to graphite.<br>  <br>  Diamonds consist of carbon atoms built around a 3 dimensional tetragonal structure in which each C-C-C bond has an angle of 108 degrees. Graphite is adifferent allotrope of carbon built around flat hexagonal structures.<br>  <br>  Kimberlites are igneous rocks but don't generally form volcanoes. Most diamonds that are mined out of kimberlites originate from dykes or from pipes (funnel like structures).<br>  <br>  Diamond bearing kimberlites generally occur in stable Precambrian crust. Yes, they do occur in India where they have been mined for thousands of years (although most Indian diamonds are recovered from secondary alluvial deposits). Diamonds are also mined from Kimberlite rocks in Canada, Brazil, various parts of West Africa, various parts of Southern Africa, Siberia and Australia. I have never heard of diamond mining in Pakistan.<br>  <br>  Diamonds are recovered by means of a process called 'Dense media separation' in which the rock is first broken up and then washed so as to form a slurry. This is then passed through a suspension made up of silica and iron that causes low density material to float off but holds on to the heavier minerals such as diamonds (specific gravity = 3.45). The heavy material then passes through an X-ray machine that allows an electrical eye to permit the diamonds to fall into a security box. The contents of the box are then sorted.<br>  <br>  The reference below shows you what diamonds look like when recovered from a diamond mine before being polished.|`|AA11673762	South Africa, Russia, Canada.

However, Pakistan is not listed on the Kimberley Process map (link below), so if there are diamonds being mined in Pakistan, they are "under the radar."<br>  <br>  Almost all rough diamonds that are expected to sell as gem-quality stones need to be cut and polished.  When they first come out of the ground, diamonds look like dirty, chunky broken glass, or even a dirty piece of frozen ice.  The flat surfaces and shine come from cut and polish procedures.  <br>  <br>  There's an excellent tutorial on diamond formation at the American Museum of Natural History (link below), and I checked and it answers all the questions you posed.

JDn5UxFxaa	It really depends on what kind of cloning you are referring to. Just the DNA (Polymerase Chain Reaction) or the whole organism.<br>  I'll elaborate on cloning of an animal. An ovum (egg cell) from the organism is extracted and the nucleus with a haploid number of chromosomes is removed. Then a normal cell (like a liver cell or something) with the diploid number of chromosomes, is extracted and its nucleus is transferred to that of the egg cell. This 'zygote' is implanted into the uterus of a third organism and a clone is born.<br>  Cloning organs by themselves is really not possible yet, unless you clone the whole organism and remove its organs. But there are many ethical issues involving cloning, so it probably won't be used on humans for a very very long time.|`|6dMNmoU8aa	Cloning of Animals<br>  <br>  Step 1:  Tools of the trade  Specialized glass needles are created. The needles are a thin glass tube shaped like a needle which are mounted onto a robotic arm attached to a microscope.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Isolation of eggs and skin cells Using the microscope, a collection of cow eggs are harvested 2 days before from the ovaries of cows.<br>  <br>  Skin cells are taken from a 6 mm wide biopsy from the ear of a cow two weeks in advance. These will be the future animal. Each cell holds a complete set of chromosomes -- all the genetic information necessary to make a new cow.<br>  <br>  Step: 3: Removal of nucleus from egg Using the glass needle, the nucleus of each egg is removed without damaging the egg. A specialized dye with ultraviolet light helps to identify the nucleus. The envelope, called the zona pellucida, is pierced with the needle up to the point of the cell membrane. Then, gentle suction is applied to the side of egg. The needles acts like a vacuum pressed against a balloon filled with Jell-O. By controlling the suction, the nucleus flows into the tip of the needle. The cell membrane is never pierced since that would kill the egg itself.<br>  <br>  Step 4: Fushion of egg and skin cell Using a narrow needle, one skin cell is drawn into the tip of the needle and then squirted out so that it is wedged tightly between the zona pellucida of the egg and the egg's cell membrane. Several eggs are prepared in the same manner.<br>  <br>  The eggs are transferred to another petri dish which have 2 long electrodes running horizontally acorss a plastic platform. Using a glass needle which has its tip sealed shut, the eggs are lined up on the platform between the electrodes. There is a fluid in the petri dish which is sugar based and protects the eggs from electrical damage.<br>  <br>  Engouh electricity is given to cause the egg and the skin cell to fuse together, thereby delivering the skin cell's nucleus into the egg. (microsecond of 100 to 200 volts)<br>  <br>  Step 5: Ebryonic development The activated eggs are placed into an incubator. By the next morning, it will be a 2 celled embryo. Evenutally the embryos will be implanted in the uteri of surrgate cow mothers and after nine months, cloned cattle will be born.
JDn5UxFxaa	When alcohol is consumed, it passes from the stomach and intestines into the blood, a process referred to as absorption. Alcohol is then metabolized by enzymes, which are body chemicals that break down other chemicals. In the liver, an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) mediates the conversion of alcohol to acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is rapidly converted to acetate by other enzymes and is eventually metabolized to carbon dioxide and water. Alcohol also is metabolized in the liver by the enzyme cytochrome P450IIE1 (CYP2E1), which may be increased after chronic drinking (3). Most of the alcohol consumed is metabolized in the liver, but the small quantity that remains unmetabolized permits alcohol concentration to be measured in breath and urine. <br>  <br>  Most of the enzymes involved are in the cytoplasm, with the exception of cytochrome P450, which is located in mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. <br>  <br>  Tonoplast exists only in plants cells. Liver cells do not have tonoplast. Peroxisome's main function is fatty acid oxidation.|`|1NNf5fNLaa	Smooth endoplasmic reticulum<br>  <br>  The liver is responsible for filtering and removing toxins and harmful materials from your blood. This is particularly accomplished, by the enzymes produced by the smooth ER, which modify and activate them.  These enzymes are responsible for detoxification, and will remove toxic byproducts of alcohol metabolism.<br>  <br>  Smooth ER is closely related to the development of tolerance. As alcoholics continue to drink, they are required to eventually consume more and more alcohol to get the same physiological effect. This is due to the fact that liver cells increase production of smooth ER, which in turn increase production of detoxifying enzymes, as higher and higher levels of alcohol are present in the blood stream. The liver becomes more efficient at processing the alcohol, and the alcoholic therefore has to increase his or her intake to feel the same effect. This is the reason the smooth ER is highly developed in the liver cells of alcoholics.

gCn6bXAFaa	I like to inoculate a few jars of sterilized rye grain with the syringe.  This gives you a stock of spawn.  Once the grain has been colonized hit it against your palm a few times to break it up. Then you can pour most of it into your prepared fruiting substrate, and the rest into a few more spawn jars to keep your spawn stock high.<br>  <br>  the best fruiting substrate is wheat straw, chopped up and pasteurized in 160degF water for 30-45 minutes.  You can do this on a stove top but it can be difficult to keep the temperature constant.  This is better than true sterilization because it preserves some microbial life that helps prevent colonization by bad fungus.  After it's pasteurized let it cool in a trash bag than dump your grain spawn in and mix it up.  Than smash it into a big clump at the bottom of the bag.  (i use about a basketball sized clump of hay.)<br>  <br>  Close up the trash bag and leave it in the dark at 78-84 degf for 10-14 days.  You can check on it occasionally but there is no need for air exchange.<br>  <br>  reduce the temperature to 55-60degF to initiate pinhead formation (baby shrooms) Poke some holes in the bag allow fresh air. It will need the equivilent of 4 air exchanges for hour.  The straw should be totally covered with white mycelum by this time, since the substrate is already colonized it should be immune to other stuff.  let it get diffuse natural light.  Twice daily misting until the fruit is 30-40% grown will prevent the caps from cracking.  this phase should last 7-14 days.<br>  <br>  To finish the fruiting cycle raise the temp to 60-64 deg and continue misting.  Harvest just before the incurved margin of the cap becomes level with the plane of the top (just before they become flat)  It should continue fruiting for 5-7weeks.

b763951278cd1bc84ec8c6d8c20f35b5aa	Hi! I'm glad that you want to become a veterinarian. <br>  <br>  Probably, love for animals is the best reason why you want to become a vet. Of course, you also need the determination and diligence to study on how to become one.<br>  <br>  In my country, I only have to enroll to a university which offers the course Doctor of Veterinary Medicine. But before that, I also had to take the college admission test. <br>  <br>  Also, in our country, it normally takes 6 years for one to graduate the course. In our first two years, we had to take general education subjects like math, english, physics and other sciences. Before we proceed to our third year, we had to pass this National Vet Med Aptitude Test. If we pass, then we will be learning many things on how to become vets.<br>  <br>  But I don't know if it's the same with your country as well. You could look up the universities in your country that offer the course. You may also ask your parents to help you.<br>  <br>  I hope I didn't scare you with all of my talk. Just remember that you should choose the course that you love and that would really make you happy. All that hard work and studying is worth it if you love what you're doing. And also, think of the lovable pets you'll be able to meet and make friends with. Good luck and if you have pets, say hi to them for me! =)|`|cqLYkuz8aa	If you are in the United States, the following would apply to getting into veterinary school:<br>  <br>  Since your in High School, try joining 4-H or FFA to get some animal experience. Volunteer or work at a vets office so that you get a good idea what the job involves and get a head start on your required hours (see below). Other good places to get experience are animal shelters, rescues, and wildlife rehabilitation centers. Take the highest levels of math and science that you can during high school. <br>  <br>  When you get to University, you should talk to one of your university's career counselors to get a suggested class list (if your university doesn't have a list of pre-vet requirements, do the pre-med requirements). Check the websites for the schools you want to attend to see what their specific requirements are since most veterinary schools have slightly different requirements.<br>  <br>  Generally, you need to take<br>  1 year biology<br>  1 year general chemistry<br>  1 year organic chemistry<br>  1 year biochemistry<br>  1 -2 semesters of physics<br>  cellular biology, microbiology, embryology, anatomy, physiology.<br>  <br>  Some veterinary schools also require animal nutrition, economics, and encourage animal husbandry classes.<br>  <br>  Most veterinary school require that you spend time working with a veterinarian and animals before you apply. Often 500+ hours. so get a job working in a clinic or volunteer with an animal organization before applying.<br>  <br>  Veterinary schools also require that you take either the GRE, MCAT, or VCAT.<br>  <br>  You can major in anything as an undergrad as long as you have all of your requirements done, however people usually major in a science like animal science, biology, neuroscience, biochemistry, microbiology etc<br>  <br>  There are 28 veterinary schools in the United States (if you are not in the US, then pretty much none of this applies to you, sorry) you can check out their websites.

They need to take a strong science, math, and biology program in high school. To be considered for admission to a college of veterinary medicine, a student must first complete undergraduate preveterinary medical coursework, which usually includes three to four years of college study, with specific course requirements. Each college of veterinary medicine establishes its own preveterinary requirements. Typical requirements include basic language and communication skills, social sciences, humanities, mathematics, chemistry, and the biological and physical sciences.<br>  <br>  Preveterinary Coursework<br>  Preveterinary coursework can be completed at many colleges and universities, including those at which the veterinary medical schools are located. Students should check with the veterinary college to which they plan to apply to be sure they take all required courses. They should also be certain that credits from the preveterinary courses they take at the school of their choice are acceptable to the veterinary colleges.<br>  <br>  Completion of a preveterinary program does not guarantee admission to a college of veterinary medicine. Admission to veterinary school is highly competitive. Applicants usually have grades of "B" or better, especially in the sciences and may be required by the veterinary school admission policies to take appropriate examinations such as the Graduate Record Examination. Most colleges give preference to candidates with animal or veterinary related experience. The number of qualified applicants who are admitted to veterinary colleges nationwide varies from year to year, but the average acceptance rate is approximately 43 percent.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.venturescholar.org/resource/veterinary.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.venturescholar.org/resource/v...</a><br>  Question: As a high school junior what should I be doing to enhance my chances of being accepted into a pre-vet program in college ? I recently visited Ohio State and spoke with a student in the Animal Science program and she indicated that I should be getting exposure hours in the field as a volunteer or employee because those who get accepted at Ohio State generally have 500 - 800 hours of service before applying to the program. Is this true in most programs ? I know it is very difficult to get into a program and want to do anything that I can to be better prepared. Any advice would be appreciated.<br>  <br>  Answer: While getting into veterinary school is difficult, it is NOT impossible and it is GREAT that you are already focused and interested in the profession. :) Definitely the student you spoke with when you visited Ohio State is correct. The admissions committees at all of the veterinary schools (including Ohio State) like to see and tend to accept students who are very dedicated to the field. So, I would definitely recommend getting as much hands on veterinary experience that you can. Since you will be applying to veterinary school in about 4-5 years, having a record of animal and veterinary experience for many years will definitely be beneficial.<br>  <br>  When I was a junior in high school, I began by working in a kennel that was attached to a veterinary hospital. Eventually, I was offered a job in the veterinary hospital working as a veterinary assistant. My other recommendation to you is to try and seek out a diverse range of animal and veterinary experiences. For example, try to work for a small animal veterinarians, a horse veterinarian, work with a researcher, etc.<br>  <br>  Question: How hard is it to get into vet school?<br>  <br>  Answer: Not hard, if it's what you really want and are willing to work hard to get there. There are only 27 veterinary schools in the United States, but 2-3 X more than that in medical schools. So, yes, you are competing with a lot of people to get into one of those vet schools. But I truly feel that if you are committed to veterinary medicine, have gotten good grades, and have shown leadership potential and worked hard, then you will get in. It takes some people more than one try (more than one year of applying to get in) but I got in the first year. I think what made me a great candidate was the fact that I got a alot of experience in different fields of veterinary medicine before I applied to vet school. I gained experience by working as a technician, vet assistant and research assistant.<br>  <br>  Q: What qualities would impress these schools?<br>  <br>  Answer: Unfortunately, most schools select who they will interview based on their applications. So looking good on paper is a good thing-- by that I mean having a good college GPA (minimum 3.4). This also means being active in your community (clubs, etc) having leadership potential (i.e. organizing events, running for president/vice pres/treasurer of class or clubs, or being more than just a "member"--be active!) and volunteering (for example, I volunteered at a local animal shelter). Most importantly, your experience in the field (veterinary medicine or even human medicine) is critical. Start now by shadowing vets in your community, and not just one type of vet-- Large animal and small animal. Once you are in college, start doing research projects, and continue working for local vets to gain experience. Don't be intimidated to ask vets for a position (even if it's just volunteering)--they, too, once needed a place to gain experience and most are happy to give you the opportunity.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bls.gov/k12/nature04.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bls.gov/k12/nature04.htm</a><br>  How do you get ready?<br>  <br>  All veterinarians need to go to college.

JY1ZkkKraa	Answer 1:<br>  <br>   if the universe is infinitely big, then the answer is simply that it isn't expanding into anything; instead, what is happening is that every region of the universe, every distance between every pair of galaxies, is being "stretched", but the overall size of the universe was infinitely big to begin with and continues to remain infinitely big as time goes on, so the universe's size doesn't change, and therefore it doesn't expand into anything. If, on the other hand, the universe has a finite size, then it may be legitimate to claim that there is something "outside of the universe" that the universe is expanding into. However, because we are, by definition, stuck within the space that makes up our universe and have no way to observe anything outside of it, this ceases to be a question that can be answered scientifically. So the answer in that case is that we really don't know what, if anything, the universe is expanding into.<br>  <br>  <br>  Answer 2:<br>  <br>  The Big Bang describes how the Universe began as a single point 13.7 billion years ago, and has been expanding ever since, but it doesn't explain what happened before that. Researchers from Penn State University believe that there should be traces of evidence in our current universe that could used to look back before the Big Bang. According to their research, there was a contracting universe with similar space-time geometry to our expanding universe. The universe collapsed and then "bounced" as the Big Bang.<br>  According to Einstein's general theory of relativity, the Big Bang represents The Beginning, the grand event at which not only matter but space-time itself was born. While classical theories offer no clues about existence before that moment, a research team at Penn State has used quantum gravitational calculations to find threads that lead to an earlier time. "General relativity can be used to describe the universe back to a point at which matter becomes so dense that its equations don't hold up," says Abhay Ashtekar, Holder of the Eberly Family Chair in Physics and Director of the Institute for Gravitational Physics and Geometry at Penn State. "Beyond that point, we needed to apply quantum tools that were not available to Einstein." By combining quantum physics with general relativity, Ashtekar and two of his post-doctoral researchers, Tomasz Pawlowski and Parmpreet Singh, were able to develop a model that traces through the Big Bang to a shrinking universe that exhibits physics similar to ours.|`|mBsL0azYaa	1) The answer is that, since there is nothing outside of the universe, it's expanding into nothing. Or, worded better, it isn't expanding into anything, as people think of 'nothing' being giant voids, but space is there. Think of it as a balloon. As a balloon inflates, the rubber does not grow, it merely stretches, which gives a larger surface area and spreads things on the balloon further apart, without growing.<br>  <br>  2) The Big Bang was when 'everything' was inside an infinitely small singularity with infinite density, which exploded. The effects of this are still seen today, in that we can see that space is expanding (at an increasing rate, due to dark energy). Let's go backwards in time now. Space contracts, back to the singularity. Therefore, there was no space before the big bang. However, as time began at the Big Bang, there was also nothing at all before the Big Bang. ;)|`|GPQnyI0Daa	There is always space for anything.<br>  Simplistic expressions like Big Bang presuppose something or someone caused it .<br>  If it had no space from which to emerge then its like producing a rabbit from a magicians hat...An illusion.<br>  <br>  All that science presents us with is the observable "hat" but it can never show the origin of the rabbit as it is from outside observable phenomena..call it Super- Natural as its beyond the reach of Natural Science.|`|a59740ff0e38675e0ca589981d66e6a5aa	All I want to know, is when can someone come up with an explanation for the Big Bang/universe without saying it was God?

Why we are the only sentient beings on this planet out of the billions upon billions of varying organisms here and prior why we are the only ones? It would require and inteligent creator.<br>  <br>  <br>  But in any case the universe is according to astro-physiscists, constantly expanding, also matter can never be created or destroyed. So how there there be expansion without new material? It is absurd.

The 4, maybe 5, forces of nature were unified at one time before the first breaking of symmetry to give us the laws of physics governing this universe as we know it.<br>  <br>  That unified force; that unified energy had to come from somewhere and it had to have had some previous stable form.  Somewhere along the way, something got converted, translated, or hetrodyned in some fashion to bring about that first effect, probably some kind of quantum phase transition.  There's little doubt that one day, scientists will eventually push through this barrier and discover a new reality from the opposite side.|`|a1VK1L64aa	1) I am yet to come across any solid evidence that says space / time is transferable with energy / matter or that it is expanding.

WqkFJ2Pgaa	Experimentally, you can drop particles into a column of water and time it, or you can calculate it using Stoke's Law. You need to know the temperature of the water and look up it's density and viscosity on a table. You also need the density of the particle. And it only works on particles that are relatively round and smaller than .025mm, so Stoke's law has some limitations.

74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa	You tell me.<br>  <br>  Freezing occurs when fresh water is about T0 = 273 deg K and there is a small bit of impurity to begin the crystallization.<br>  <br>  The rate of change in heat content varies as dQ/dt = k (T1 - T0) where the T's are temperatures of the water in your case.  k is a constant of proportionality that is material specific; we can assume it is the same for the hot and cold water cases.<br>  <br>  We assume the same quantity of water, but the hot water has Q > q amount of heat where q is the cold water amount.   Let the hot water temperature be T2 > T1 the cold water temperature and T0 = 273 deg Kelving the freezing point of fresh water.<br>  <br>  Then compare freezing rates dQ/dt//dq/dt = k (T2 - T0)/k(T1 - T0) so that dQ/dt = dq/dt (T2 - T0)/(T1 - T0) and because (T2 - T0) > (T1 - T0) we see that dQ/dt > dq/dt and the rate of change is faster for the hot water.  So the hot water does approach the freezing point faster.<br>  <br>  But, and this is a big BUT, the hot water Q > q of the cold water; so the hot water started farther away from the freezing point.  In fact, once the hot water temperature cools down from T2 ---> T1, its rate of heat loss will equal that of the cold water starting point.  That is dQ/dt = dq/dt once T2 = T1.<br>  <br>  And that's the answer.  Hot water does indeed cool faster initially, but once it reaches the cold water temperature, it cools at the same rate the cold water does.  And given that the hot water started with a higher heat content Q > q it will take longer to reach freezing point because of that extra time between T2 and T1 that the cold water does not have.|`|lvJUDy78aa	whoever says this is true is an idiot, because cold water simply freezes faster. However, they are not entirely wrong so to speak. If you were to take two like amounts of water, boil one and chill the other and then let them both sit out until both have reached the same room temperature and  THEN throw them in the freezer, you will see that the one which was boiled freezes first.<br>  <br>  Boiling changes the 'stuff' in the water just enough so that it cools faster!  Remember, they both have to be brought to room temperature before placing in the freezer.|`|4pw41geQaa	A lot of people like to say that hot water freeze faster right because of Mpemba effect. But I think this is 50 50 true(this is what I think) I have ask my friend once that hot or cold water will freeze faster. My friend immediately said that hot one because of Mpemba effect, but I agree with him. Because I have read about Mpemba effect before. But I think that cold water will freeze faster because a molecules of hot water will move faster right because hot water molecules will have more energy and more energy that mean more kinetic energy. But for cold water a molecules of cold water it has less energy than hot water. So it will move slower than hot water. And if you give a cold temperature to hot water it need to take quite a long time to make it freeze because it need to wait for a molecules of hot water to move slower you know to make it has less kinetic energy and freeze. But for cold water it molecules already move slow because it not has much energy so it will not take quite a long time to make a cold water freeze right --.<br>  <br>  Experiment at my school and at my home with my friends (Mpemba experiment and cold water and hot experiment).|`|v5fEfmO8aa	Hot water does, It is called the Mpemba effect. It has been observed that, in certain specific circumstances, warmer water freezes faster than colder water. New Scientist observed that starting the experiment with containers at 35 °C (95 °F) and 5 °C (41 °F) to maximize the effect.|`|mnlV6Efeaa	It can but only under certain conditions - I dont think anyone know the full reasons.<br>  <br>  Let me give you an analogy<br>  <br>  Suppose you are on a beach - 10m from the sea and a friend is already in the water - you both race to run to a buoy 20m out to sea.  Your initial speed entering the water may allow you to overtake your friend before he can reach the buoy.|`|Gnfc4wRlaa	My Mom used to tell me that hot water froze faster and I believed it at the time.  Then, when I was studying Chemistry and Physics (heat transfer), I learned that hot water loses heat faster, but only down to the temperature of the cold water.  Starting from that point, it would still take the amount of time the cold water takes.  So, for hot water, you have the time it takes to cool down plus the time it takes to freeze from cold.  That means hot water takes longer to become frozen.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I have been looking up info on the Mpemba effect and found that it is true under some circumstances and experimental conditions.  <br>  <br>  Per John Baez:  "In short, hot water does freeze sooner than cold water under a wide range of circumstances.  It is not impossible, and has been seen to occur in a number of experiments.  However, despite claims often made by one source or another, there is no well-agreed explanation for how this phenomenon occurs.  Different mechanisms have been proposed, but the experimental evidence is inconclusive."<br>  <br>  So, the answer is both yes and no, depending on the conditions.  There is a good discussion of this at the referenced site.

It is now hard to miss at night and amateur astronomers made a sport of taking photos through their telescopes of it, creating fantastic images. So, this is with certainty no fake - you will not see any other fast moving light during such a passage, which glows in a dirty orange (because of the solar arrays)<br>  <br>  You can receive satellite TV and use GPS - so these are also not fake (Anybody who installed his own satellite TV antenna knows that accurate pointing is important, it must come from the sky). <br>  <br>  When should the fake begin?<br>  <br>  The probability approaches zero, if you take in account all observations.

We went there. The teacher didn't obviously just tell us the concepts in science. The teacher made us do it in the laboratory. We would not believe the teacher unless we do it ourselves and unless we see it in the real world, unless we apply it in the real world. Then there we develop logic. Also, the sky is a free space. No one blocks you from viewing it. No one stops you from buying your own set of telescopes and binoculars to confirm everything you see in those pictures. Also, there is this thing called mathematics. I'm pretty sure you know the basics. Even if we don't see it right away, in math we can clearly postulate some theories. Then again, if we use the right equipment, we can prove those that we have solved mathematically. You know where I'm getting at? There are millions of scientists and people in the world to prove if NASA or anyone claiming something is wrong. We have free will, judgment and logic to counter all that is not possible. Certainly we are using our brain the right way. And then again, our world is plagued by conspiracy theories. If we are too gullible, we may end up simply going on the conspirators side because we cannot comprehend or simply we don't trust anyone anymore. Weigh in on the evidences with the rightful tool before you post such a statement. Waaaah! Why am I answering this, this way?  There is no way you can negotiate with the close-minded. Anyway, I tried.

5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Think about it, what good does it do to tear a day off a calendar? Daylight saving time is simply a timeshift of daylight, so the sun apparently rises later and apparently sets later, so people have more daylight after the end of a normal working day until sunset. It made sense when people used kerosene lamps, but with the advent of electric light, daylight saving no longer serves a practical purpose. Dubya changed the dates in 2007. He claimed it was an "energy saving" measure, but in practice has been shown to actually use about 1% MORE than before the change. Dubya effectively made my VCR's and other clocks which could automatically adjust themselves obsolete with the stroke of his pen as I have no way to adjust WHEN they change, just to turn the feature ON or OFF. So now, the daylight saving feature is turned OFF and I have to go around and change clocks myself. Thank YOU Dubya, for making this feature USELESS.<br>  <br>  OK, so it is an hour, and it is easy to remember the way to turn the clock if you remember to spring forward and fall back. Last night, 0200 went to 0300 and we had a day that by the clock went to 23 hours rather than 24, which timeshifts the daylight from sunrise to sunset by an hour, rising later and setting later by the hour adjustment. In November, we will fall back, setting the clock from 0200 back to 0100 so we shift back and that day will be 25 hours of real time. The only time you "lose" or "gain" a day is if you are traveling and cross the international date line.|`|i1jV0xIGaa	Its the law.

The 30-60-90 triangle states that the hypotenuse(Spelling?) is twice the size of the smallest side and the medium length side(in your case, the altitude) is the length of the smallest side multiplied by the square root of 3.  so the length of the altitude is:<br>  <br>   3*square root of 3<br>  <br>  hope this long explanation helps|`|QMs4WKOmaa	In an equilateral triangle, all sides have the same length.

Hail appears to come when we have rain come in a period when intense thermals carry the rain high into the air where it freezes. The pellets fall down through the rain collecting more water, and are again carried up to freeze, down to collect more water. This can continue until some hail is the size of a baseball, but most often it will fall out before it is the size of a golf ball.

Nc7pNyQ2aa	I don't know the answer to the second one, but the first:<br>  <br>  Oh, and this should be in the biology section, not the chemistry.<br>  <br>  Anyway, when cells are not dividing, they're in Interphase, which has three phases to it. There's G1 phase, where cells increase production of cytoplasm to grow. S phase involves the synthesis (creation) of DNA and proteins. G2 phase is when the centrioles (in an animal cell) disintegrate and the cytoskeleton breaks down. The cell then enters mitosis.<br>  <br>  As for the third, the best indication that I've seen that mitosis is a continuing process is when a cell is in telophase and is entering cytokinesis. As telophase progresses, the (in an animal cell) cell membrane is already pinching together and preparing to separate completely even though telophase is not yet finished and (in plant cells), the cell plate is already forming.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Actually, I can take a guess as to why the second one would work. If the herbicides made the cells divide too rapidly, it would be the same sort of effect as cancer-too many cells form a tumor which inhibits the function of other cells and kills the plant. Although, that's just an assumption.|`|bid1JBrAaa	if they are not dividing cells then they kill weeds because they are designed to do so.

As no standard figures are given for the size of cities and towns, this concept can be rather vague. In Iceland, a settlement of 300 people is classed as urban; the figure is 10?000 in Spain. An area may be classified as urban by its role as a central place for a tributary area, providing a range of shops, banks, and offices. A high density of population may also be used as an indicator but the city may include large areas of low-density housing.<br>  <br>  urban regeneration<br>  <br>  The attempt to reinvigorate a run-down urban area, such as the inner city. Slum clearance is redevelopment after wholesale clearance of the site, but this has the effect of destroying communities and has become unacceptable; in Oxford, for example, the community of St Ebbe's was relocated at the edge of the city, in Blackbird Leys, leaving the population with a long journey to work and fewer amenities. By the 1970s, the emphasis had, therefore, shifted to refurbishment, and local authorities commonly gave improvement grants to upgrade existing housing. In many cases, this strategy lead to gentrification, and a revival in the fortunes of a decaying area.<br>  <br>  By the 1980s, and partly as a result of riots such as those in Toxteth, the British government was concerned to target regional aid, and set up enterprise zones and urban development corporations, while encouraging the growth of housing associations. For a review of urban regeneration in the UK in the last twenty years, see Bradford, Geography 88.<br>  <br>  Many US federal programmes have been directed towards urban revitalization, not all of them successful, but the containerization of Boston's docks, the redevelopment of the waterfront, and improvements in transport facilities have been accounted a success.

WQkyRBeRaa	First of all bigger things have bigger gravity, smaller things have relatively lower gravity. TO start off if the sun size doubled we would experience a greater pull of gravity, there would be super high high tidal waves, and the earth would be spinning and moving around the solar system very very fast, the year would become shorter. The earth will speed up on its orbit to oppose the greater attracting force of the sun, and if it cant we'll slowly get nearer to our sun. How do we incinerate? Well if we survive to see it all, the atmosphere will disappear, the earth will get cooked, if the magnetic field of the earth will not be strong enough to protect us from solar wind. Solar wind? Thats just like burning an apple with a flamethrower. The water will boil out, earth will be nothing but rock and soil. <br>  <br>  Only planets with water are candidates for life sustainability if the sun size did double. Because if there were no water, day would be incineratingly hot, and night to be freezing cold.<br>  <br>  If the sun size lost half, then gravity lowers and we would likely increase our orbit due to the lesser pull force, and if we somehow oppose that force to the limit we will drift into space, collide with an asteroid (if it happens) or just die out of cold. If the sun size did lose half then many orbiting things will get lost into space, drifting untill they get caught into some other's orbit.|`|yTkNT3OSaa	The sun is very slowly, yet constantly expanding. It will also eventually die.<br>  <br>  If life on Earth hasn't already been eradicated due to some other drastic environmental change (not talking about 'climate change'; that's normal and is the driving force for evolution, but rather a very rapid change similar to whatever it was that killed off the dinosaurs) then it certainly would be at that point.|`|8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	I'm gonna take a risk and say that not much would have happened.

There would be far less light reaching the Earth thus many plants and cold blooded reptiles would most likely die off.

By size do you mean mass?  Or do you mean just is physical diameter?<br>  <br>  If its mass was cut in half, its gravitational field would be reduced to one quarter.  The planets would all move outward in their orbits and we would all freeze.<br>  If its mass was doubled, its gravitational field would be increased 4 times, and all the planets would move closer to the sun (we would all broil).<br>  This doesn't take into account the internal changes to the fusion rate in the sun.<br>  <br>  If just the physical size doubled without a change in mass, the only effect would be the sun would become a cool red giant star (same heat spread over a larger area) and the Earth (and probably the other planets) would freeze.<br>  If the physical size halved without a change in mass, fusion would increase in its core and it would become hotter.

Wagcdklxaa	Using the conservation of energy,<br>  <br>  Potential energy of skater = Kinetic energy of skater<br>  <br>  mgh = (1/2)mV^2<br>  <br>  where<br>  <br>  m = mass of the skater<br>  g = acceleration due to gravity = 9.8 m/sec^2 (constant)<br>  h = vertical height of intial position of skater = 50(sin 35) = 28.68 m<br>  V = velocity of skier at bottom of slope <br>  <br>  Since "m" appears on both sides of the equation, then it will cancel out and the above becomes,<br>  <br>  (9.8)(28.68) = (1/2)V^2<br>  <br>  and solving for "V"<br>  <br>  V = 23.71 m/sec.<br>  <br>  Next working formula is<br>  <br>  Vf^2 - V^2 = 2as<br>  <br>  where<br>  <br>  Vf = final velocity of the skier = 0 (when player stops)<br>  V = 23.71 m/sec (as calculated above)<br>  a = acceleration<br>  s = distance travelled by skier before coming to a stop.<br>  <br>  Thus,<br>  <br>  0 - 23.71^2 = 2(as)<br>  <br>  s = -281.08/a --- call this Equation A<br>  <br>  Next working formula is Newton's 2nd Law of Motion,<br>  <br>  F = ma<br>  <br>  where<br>  <br>  F = frictional force = - (mu)(mg)<br>  mu = coefficient of friction = 0.50 (given)<br>  <br>  and the other terms have been previously defined .<br>  <br>  NOTE the negative sign attached to "F" and this simply implies that the direction of the frictional force is opposite that of the skater's motion. <br>  <br>  -(0.5)(m)(9.8) = m(a)<br>  <br>  and again, since "m" appears on both sides of the equation, then it will cancel out and solving for "a" from the above,<br>  <br>  a = -0.5*9.8<br>  <br>  a = - 4.9 m/sec2<br>  <br>  NOTE that the negative sign attached to the acceleration simply means that the skater is slowing down after reaching the bottom of the hill which is covered with deep snow.<br>  <br>  Substituiting a = -4.9 m/sec^2 in Equation A,<br>  <br>  s = -281.08/-4.9<br>  <br>  s = 53.6 meters<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|XwzOFY1Vaa	for a start you can never have a frictionless surface
AGpKSCxiaa	you have to run three wires. see the link below for wiring diagram.
