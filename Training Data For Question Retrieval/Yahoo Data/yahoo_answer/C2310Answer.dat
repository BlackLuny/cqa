The rest of the stuff was confusing to me. I think what will happen is you will either get the amount you need or a loan & then the schools you apply for will make you offers. Then if you can work while in school find a place that pays for your education. That is what he did & he had more money than he needed. The school offered him money that he didn't take cause he didn't need it cause the company he worked for offered him money. Yet, he did borrow some money so he had cash to use. He thought that was better for some economic reason. Anyway, that is what I know from experience. My son got a good job & makes good money & has worked so many hours that he is still in school only taking about 1 class now. He got his finance degree & is working on his MBA. You are ambitious enough to ask this question you are going to do fine. That is all he did. We filled out the FASFA the first year & the secound year I brought him the papers & made him fill it out. He laughs about how none of his friends had to do that. Yet, he has done much better than any of those friends.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	To become a pediatrician, you need a 4-year college degree and a 4-year medical degree.  Medicine and premed aren't majors; you can major in whatever you want and get into med school as long as you take the premed classes in bio, chem, physics, math, and English.  You can take those at pretty much any 4-year college or university, so find one you really like and go there.|`|1c6Jwbevaa	USC|`|5WAjB1gXaa	You should go to Austin College, very renowned premed program, if you can make it through the challenging program, there is a 90 percent acceptance rate to medical school after graduating from Austin College, its a small liberal arts college about an hour north of Dallas in a town called Sherman.  Ask any doctor, they will know of this school, espeacially if it is a Texas Medical School you want to get into, tehy know how challenging teh premed program is and they know how much it prepares you for medical school, this school pops out so many doctors and lawyers its ridiculous! Yah but really look into it.. you may have not heard of it just like most people, but there are only about 15-30 students per calss so  alot of personal attention from your professors.|`|w2v0Cg5Faa	Even if your family has quite a bit of money so you can afford to go to a more expensive private school, you might want to think twice. Medical school is really expensive, and its much more important in medicine to go to a really good medical school than it is to go to a really good college for your undergraduate education. <br>  <br>  It's great that you have such good grades- that should give you a lot of freedom to choose where you want to go to college, but schools also pay a lot of attention to your SAT and ACT scores- even more so, I would say, than to any other thing on your application. So take a practice test, see how you do, and if you don't do as well as you want to, you should take a class thru Princeton Review, Kaplan, etc. to bring your scores up. That will also REALLY help you with scholarships. <br>  <br>  To answer your question, you should think about the things you want in both a school and in a city. Do you want to go to a big public university where there will be all types of different organizations and clubs or would you rather go to a smaller school where you are likely to get more attention from the faculty and administration and there will be a closer knit sense of community? Do you want to go to a school where you will know a lot of people there (so maybe your state university or where all of you friends are going) or do you want to go out on your own and make a whole new set of friends? Do you want to live in a big city where there is a lot to do or do you prefer a small city, maybe one with lots of outdoors things to do in your spare time? Do you want to live where it is cold or warm? These are some questions to consider. <br>  <br>  To be honest with you, as long as you go to any of the top 50 or so universities in the country, make great grades, do well on your MCAT (medical school admission test), and have some good extracurricular experiences (can do research with a professor, volunteer with a local health clinic, etc.), you will get into a stellar medical school.|`|wWzK6eJaaa	Well im from Rhode island and the best school here and throught the country is Brown University, you will have to work really hard to get in but it seems like your doing that already with straight A's.

For instance I took a class that went in depth on fish and another that concerned paleontology.<br>  <br>  Figure out what you want to do when you get out of school.

kPeLbKr1aa	The arguments for protective tariffs are that it protects domestic goods and services from foreign goods and services.  This protects specific jobs identified with the protected goods and services.  Additionally, an argument can be made that a protective tariff can be used for fledgling enterprises that cannot compete with established foreign firms.  A country may also want to use protectionist measures for national security or international prestige reasons.  For example, let's say the US wants to be able to make tanks in the event of a war, therefore, they need the infrastructure to produce steel and automobiles in the event that trade and supply routes are disrupted in the case of international conflict.<br>  <br>  The arguments against tariffs are that prices are artificially high and this hurts consumers.  For example, if people could get their wheat a lot cheaper, say a couple dollars a bushel, from another country then more people could afford to eat bread, and the consumer could use that money on other things.  However, if a government imposes a tariff, then the consumer would have to spend more money on bread and would have less money to buy other things.<br>  <br>  Another problem with tariffs is that the targeted countries may impose similar tariffs on other goods.  These tariff wars significantly hamper trade and although not the cause of the Great Depression, caused the great depression to be great (not my quote...).  <br>  <br>  Another problem with tariffs is that it keeps inefficient production tied up in areas that might not be the best place for those resources.  For example, let's say your country is really good at making computers, but you have a protective tariff that allows your country to make widgets  at the cost of consumers.  If those tariffs would be removed, your country would then produce computers more efficient and consumers would get cheaper widgets and therefore everyone is happy.<br>  <br>  Sorry for rambling, but that should be a start for you!
f977e51d2f4a930956e1926a9b567712aa	There isn't a pre-med major per se.  Many people major in a science related field (biology, chemistry, physics) because the pre-med sequence is primarily science based.  However, you do not have to major in a science related field if you do not want to.  It is good preparation for medical school but not completely necessary if you complete the prerequisites.  It is typical to take the MCAT your junior year of undergrad, and begin applying to medical school the summer/fall before you graduate from college.  If you do not complete a science major, I highly recommend you take biochemistry, anatomy, and physiology in addition to your prerequisites (at some medical schools, these are prereqs, but not all).  These are very difficult courses in medical school and a good prior knowledge will help tremendously.  Other than that, maintain a high GPA and do the best you possibly can on your MCAT.  Also, shadow a physician for as many hours as you can.  Not only is if usually required for admittance, it is very beneficial to do so before you begin medical school.  It is important that you are positive this is the career path for you, before you commit many years of your life, and accrue a substantial amount of debt in medical school.  Good luck!|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Premed is not a major, it's a course sequence.  You can major in anything and take these courses (in bio, chem, physics, math, and English).

c0yUDjI9aa	Depending on where the camera is stationed, yes, the school can actually get into very big legal trouble for that. Mention it to your parents right away. The school is violating your privacy and is taping you in a spot where a common person would expect privacy, and potentially getting you showing yourself naked on camera. If they have, or are, they are taping child pornography, which is a very serious crime. Another issue is wither or not there are signs or someone has told you before that you are being taped in the bathroom. If nothing like that has even been done, the school is in even more legal trouble. Report the camera to your parents and local police department right away.|`|gEDfdbGeaa	Your school is NOT allowed to film students in the bathrooms. It counts as them forcing you to take clothes off in front of camera or unvoluntary child pornography. They can get in SERIOUS trouble. Especially because most students are probably unaware. You should definetly tell your parents, they arent allowed to do this unless they camera are faced in a area where its impossible for them to see you in the bathroom stalls.

wfsh1Irkaa	Hi there.  I would love to help you but unfortunately you live too far and online teacher is way to strenuous and difficulty to teach.  Hence, that's why they made classrooms.

Speaking of language school, I will be coming to Vietnam this summer to teach English in Saigon.  Well good luck.|`|GQpTI2GWaa	Are there courses in Vietnam you could do? At a local college or school?

32cdf0ea2c6e049c92e67ec40dfecfa9aa	Well, it depends on the college. Some colleges do emails while others just mail out letters or packages. Usually if you get a big envelope in the mail, it means you got accepted to the college but not neccessarily into the program. If you got a letter, then it means you got rejected from the school.|`|MHcPbvnAaa	You'll get a letter in the mail.<br>  Usually a small envelope is bad because they're just telling you that they're sorry you weren't selected and that's it.<br>  A large envelope from the school is good because it has all the enrollment forms and things you need to know about the school.<br>  Hope that helps.|`|FPX6AcjFaa	They always send something. At least I've never heard of any univ. that doesn't let you know. They send letters whether you're in or not.|`|MzQD5UDVaa	They will send you a letter or an email if you get accepted or not.|`|5903457cc2132f59ba7bdb501fb47b4eaa	You get a letter|`|AA12021966	They will sent you a letter in the mail (snail mail) to tell you whether or ot you got accepted.|`|DhUMjZxtaa	They will send you a letter in the mail telling you if you were accepted or not.<br>  <br>  Usually, if it's a big package, you got accepted lol|`|hEFthejvaa	they'll send you letter whether or not you make it. i don't mean to disappoint you but if she got it weeks before you then you probably didn't make it. if your friend just got it, wait for another week or 2 you'll surely get a letter.<br>  best of luck...i wasn't talking about luck for making it to the school but for engineering. it's by far the toughest undergrad major out there, but if you really like then you're already halfway from graduating with an engineering degree.|`|kQA7SbY9aa	You should be getting a letter either way.

W3UYWpxiaa	Everyone always jokes that the best part of being a teacher is having the summer off, but it is really so much than that.  You get to see kids learn and get excited about learning.  You can see all of those little "light bulb" moments and know that you had a part in it.  When you get to hear a child read for the first time it's magic.  The best part of being a teacher for me is the personal satisfaction I get knowing I'm helping the little ones learn.|`|TvAXfcWJaa	I hope this helps. The benefits of being a teacher are numerous. Let me mention a few. You begin to realize that kids will be kids, Bottom line. I feel great when I deliver what I'm entrusted to deliver. Of course, it's the opposite when I fall short. Emily Dickenson put it best when she wrote:<br>  <br>  If I can stop one heart from breaking,<br>  I shall not live in vain...<br>   or help one fainting robin<br>   unto his nest again,<br>  I shall not live in vain."<br>  <br>  Yes, the benefits are great, not to mention the medical insurance, just kidding!|`|Z86S88AAaa	You have the joy of touching lives and helping students be positive.   Most teacher don't teach for the money but the priceless feeling of molding a child's' life! Don't forget the great breaks!!

cPMQyxfJaa	lol nice but does that apply to square roots?|`|ij6MJ068aa	if A = 25/5, that means it = 5,  so A = 5 in your example    therefore, in the 1st part, if 5 = root25   B = 5  so 5 = C  A = C 5 = 5    since you use root25 as = to 5 in the 1st part, and b is a constant =s.    if anyone can put a response into words and convince me otherwise then fine lol. i just thought id try      (in otherwords, what the guy above said)|`|TA8jQJywaa	Why stick to maths? Logic is supposed to have some tentative bearing on real stuff, isn't it. So how about this: Ice is water, and water is a liquid, but ice is not a liquid.    Does that count as a kind of disproof?|`|8cDd70dSaa	But here, A does not equal B. 25/5 can only be 5, while the square root of 25 can be either 5 or -5, as you have shown with C. Since A did not equal B from the start, your point about A not equaling C is moot.
VELnLnIKaa	sure i will help say thursday noonish i have cleared my schedule to do your homework lol|`|ZBSlbzYtaa	the city of ember is about a group of people who built a hidden underground place and settled people in there because they were afraid the human race would be wiped out on the surface but the people couldn't tell there children about the above world (the normal one) in fear they would all leave to it and die but the supplies they left down there could only last so long so they left one chest that would open in 120 years and tell them ho to escape but the box was lost and now around 140 years later the supplies are running out and the lights (there was no sunlight there)were braking down so a girl finds ppiecesof the instruction of how to get out and she has to add things to discover the escape rout      its not a perfect summary but what can i do sugar is calling so bye

Simply fill them out to be sent to CA instead of Florida and you can have your initial licensure in CA.      No need to wait for admission to a CA school.|`|AA11942204	You need to follow this procedure http://www.ptbc.ca.gov/applicants/how_to...|`|Moz2d806aa	Assuming your degree has the proper accreditation, which I would assume it does for a DPT, you can work anywhere.

8pDblyCBaa	it's never too late!|`|AA11759162	It is possibly TOO early - these changes take place.     Look at what is not working and if it can be fixed.     Schools always take a child back. You could just be following the wrong curriculum for your child, or need a change in resources.     Every time a child moves school - they fall back on average 6 months in development, so think carefully...     You could find and contact your local home school coordinator for more ideas, and field trips with like minded children.     Home schooling does produce more motivated children and there must have been a reason to start it.|`|LsAArkUyaa	That is a question that only the private school can answer.
434f04a6fde02d2e60610cacc58bd89eaa	I'm doing an LLM in London at the moment, I am studying part time (two years) and it is my final year. Altogether it is three exams (three taught courses) and one 15,000 word dissertation in any area of law.    I'm not sure what you mean by "graded" - you can fail (    Mine is a taught course, but I had a quick look on the internet for you and it seems that to do a research degree you would be doing supervised research for one year at the end of which you would submit a 20,000 word dissertation.     That doesn't seem particularly fair compared to what I have to do, so perhaps there is more to it than that, like a good report from your supervisor showing that you have been useful during the year!    It says that if you get more than 65% on your dissertation you can qualify for a PhD subject to being able to find someone to supervise you in your chosen area.

5YgtaXR1aa	In an empty schoolroom, a dark-eyed, rigid man emphatically expresses to the schoolmaster and another adult his desire for children to be taught facts, saying that nothing else will ever be of any service to them.    In the industrial city of Coketown, a place dominated by grim factories and oppressed by coils of black smoke, the dark-eyed, rigid manThomas Gradgrindhas established a school. He has hired a teacher, Mr. McChoakumchild, whom he hopes will instill in the students nothing but cold, hard facts.     To answer your question, Thomas Gradgrind is speaking, and Mr. McChoakumchild (what kind of name is that?? haha) is the teacher. Hope that helped.

I always like to try to put my listeners/readers in the place of someone who may have to make such a decision. You want to leave them in a place where they would rationally say that euthanasia would be the most humane thing to do for someone - whether it is Aunt Sally suffering intractable pain from a terminal disease or a violent criminal that our society has decided must be eliminated.    For our loved ones who are suffering with no hope of recovery, euthanasia may be the most loving thing that we can do for them. We do it for our pets who are suffering but are not permitted to do it for a loved one in misery.    As far as executions go, regardless of how you feel about capital punishment, if it is going to happen, then why is it necessary to use barbaric methods like electrcution when a simply putting the criminal to sleep accomplishes the same goal painlessly? BTW, capital punishment by lethal injection is not the same as what we do to our pets. The lethal injection has additional components that cause heart failure in addition to simply putting someone permanently to sleep.|`|AA11118525	Just give your opinion on each paragraph you made with one sentence.

ip5EWw7uaa	Non-catholic Christian believer.    It was founded in the 16th century by Martin Luther in reaction to the 'spells and smells' form of worship practised by the catholics, in favour of a simpler style of worship reflected in the style of churches they used, the litany they followed, and most of all an adherence to the scriptures, rather than the Popes/Cardinals' interpretation. Most controversially they used the Bible in the verncular - rather than the Latin still used by catholics today.  Introduced into Britain as the official religion by Henry VIII who founded the Church of England (after he could not obtain a divorce from the Pope). The term covers a wide range of similar religions (Baptists etc) as well as non-conformists.    The word originateds from the letters of protest sent by princely followers of Luther who objected to the bans placed on Luthers doctrines by the Pope - the term stuck and has come to mean basically any non-catholic.|`|6hvw6lkNaa	http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionar...

f6v64lmMaa	It depends on what age group you are looking for there are alot of fun songs that are educational. I work with children on a regular basis and I have a few favorites that children love to sing.<br>  Here they are:<br>  FIVE CURRANT BUNS in a bakers shop round and fat with sugar on the top along comes (name a child) with a penny or dollar one day bought a currant bun and took it right away.  I tend to let the children choose what they want on top themselves. I ask five children to come up and I choose a shop keeper.<br>  Tho other one I suggest is to add a couple of verses to BAA BAA BLACK SHEEP <br>  I was working in a centre with a group or pre school children and we made some other verses to this well loved song.We were talking about what animals give us to eat and what different noises they may and the children came up with these verses of Baa baa black sheep.  <br>  <br>  MOO MOO BROWN COW have you got any milk yes yes sir three cartons full. You can also do with PIGS and HENS.

AA10729675	My point of view is that Clarence Darrow is pleading for the life of his client.  He appeals to the theory that life is precious: all life is worth saving;  he appeals to the pity of the judge: mercy.<br>  He also addresses the ego of the judge: highest attribute of man.<br>  This way, the judge is compelled to adopt a an attitude of compassion to show that he has the highest attribute of mankind.  He coerces the judge into thinking that to prove how humane he is, he must save the life of the two accused people.  <br>  However, by doing that, he is not helping too much his clients who, obviously, do not possess the highest attribute of man.  So why should the judge apply compassion for some who do not place any value in it?|`|Jr6emga0aa	Darrow's point was that his clients, while guilty, should not be executed and asks that the court demonstrate both logic ( all life is worthwhile ) and compassion ( asking for mercy ).|`|g5RS83paaa	he's doing what any good lawyer would do, try to spare his client's life.

AA10067221	Romeo is in love with Juliet from the first time that he sees her. After they meet, they are inseparable, well they would be if there families were not enemies. They try and spend as much time as they could together, but it was very hard without there parents knowing. Romeo then tells Friar Lawrence, he tries to help Romeo and Juliet get married and run away safely. Juliet then tells the nurse about her and Romeo. At first the nurse is on Juliet's side, but then she realizes that Juliet's parents were right and that she needed to marry Paris. Juliet then runs away to Friar Lawrence's cell tells him what has happened. Friar Lawrence devises a scheme that would help Romeo and Juliet run away safely together. Juliet would drink a potion that would put her to sleep for 42 hours, and everyone would think she was dead. Romeo was supposed to get the letter telling him that, so that he would not think that she is dead and kill himself. Even though that is not what happened, because of complications, they still were together just not on earth.|`|PtJnPMh7aa	After the prologue, the scene shifts to the streets of Verona where two of Capulet’s men (Sampson and Gregory) discuss the tension between their lord and lord Montague. During their discussion they notice Abram and Balthasar, two of Montague’s men. After a littler prodding, Sampson gets Gregory to start an argument with the Montagues. A fight breaks out between the men, causing all of the people in the streets to begin fighting. Benvolio tries to stop the fight, but is attacked by Tybalt. The Prince arrives with his men and breaks up the fight. He announces that if anyone from either house disturbs the peace once more, they will be put to death. <br>  <br>  After the fight, Benvolio is sent to find Romeo. Romeo has been brooding all morning because the love of his life does not love him anymore. He can’t imagine how he can ever find joy, happiness, or love without Rosaline. Benvolio tries to cheer-up Romeo. During their conversation, a Capulet servant walks by and asks if they could read the note that he is carrying. The note is actually a list of people that are invited to Capulet’s house for a party. Benvolio, seeing Rosaline’s name on the list, persuades Romeo to go to the party and compare Rosaline’s beauty with the other women at the party. Basically, Benvolio is telling Romeo that there is more than one woman in the world. <br>  <br>  The next scene begins at the House of Capulet. The Nurse has raised Juliet since she was born, as was the custom for most births of royalty or nobles. Lady Capulet tells Juliet that Paris, a young count and cousin of the Prince, wishes to marry Juliet. Juliet is told that she will meet him at the party that night, and she is asked if she can like him. She states that she will try if that is what they want her to do. <br>  <br>  Later that evening, Romeo, Benvolio, Mercutio, and around five or six other men are making their way to the party. Mercutio tends to be a joker, and he makes fun of Romeo because of his attitude about love. Romeo then says he dreamt that it wasn’t a good idea to go to the party. Mercutio then says that dreams lie, and he begins a long speech about dreams. The speech becomes so strange that Romeo stops him and tells Mercutio that he speaks nonsense. In a way, I think the speech is a way for Mercutio to show Romeo that he shouldn’t just sit around thinking about lost love, but instead live life to the fullest. <br>  <br>  The group attends the party, but while they are there, Tybalt recognizes Romeo. He wants to kill Romeo, but Capulet refuses. As long as he is there and causing no trouble, Capulet doesn’t want the Prince’s wrath on his house. It isn’t long before Romeo sees Juliet, and all thoughts of Rosaline vanish. The two exchange words and are instantly attracted to one another. Of course, as the guests leave, both Romeo and Juliet learn that each have fallen in love with their enemy. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  there are many of everything you need in these few paragraphs<br>  <br>  i hoped this helped|`|03sZD5zUaa	Ok, I hope this helps.

In political terms, "conflict" can refer to wars, revolutions or other struggles, which may involve the use of force as in the term armed conflict. Without proper social arrangement or resolution, conflicts in social settings can result in stress or tensions among stakeholders. When an interpersonal conflict does occur, its effect is often broader than two individuals involved, and can affect many associate individuals and relationships, in more or less adverse, and sometimes even humorous way.<br>  <br>  These are the definitions.

Yes. You can move around between engineering, physics, and math for grad school.<br>  b.

Ftkr9jqYaa	I am not sure of the purpose of this essay.  If it is just a simple classroom exercise, then my minor edits should help.  If it is part of a competition, then I probably haven't provided much benefit:<br>  <br>  College can be expensive. Tuition plus room and board can cost anywhere from $2,000 to more than $10,000 per semester, but other expeditures make college life even more pricey. For example, books typically cost between $100 and $500 each term.  Even individual textbooks are sometimes priced at more than $100. Materials are also very expensive. Paper, notebooks, writing utensils, and other supplies often cost more at the college bookstore than at any local discount department store. For instance, a package of notepaper costing $1 at a discount store might bring a charge of $5 at a college bookstore.<br>  <br>  In addition, there are all kinds of special fees, taxes, and surcharges added to the bill at registration time. A college student might have to pay a $50 insurance fee, a $20 activity fee, a $15 fee to the student government association and anywhere from $500 to $100 for parking. There are other fees if a student decides to add or drop classes after registration.<br>  <br>  The fees and expenses never seem to end. Consider the money required even for a minimal amount of entertainment and a decent lifestyle.  For example, going to a movie theater, eating out, or visiting water parks in the summer with friends all add to a student's monetary outlays.  Yet the demands of study are such that there is little or no time for earning money.  Consequently, the existence of a college student can be a meager grind.

MXrpeKxfaa	People say you need like around a 3.8 GPA at least a 1300 on your tests (ACT in 30's) and be very involved; lots of community service helps also. Family legacy used to count alot, but doesn't as much. However it still counts for something. Also, everyone thinks schools want to see a well-rounded student, which to some degree is true, but actually what is is more important is an "angular or pointed" student; meaning someone who shows genuine interest and passion for select activities. It doesn't mean as much if you're 101 activites just to fill up space on your application. The college only cares if you contributed to that club etc. otherwise it doesn't hold as much weight as you might expect. I toured USC and an admissions advisor spoke to my group saying even if you don't think there is a chance of you getting in, apply anyways, there are people who get in that have lower GPA's, grades aren't everything although they do help, obviously. If you don't get in you rfreshman year, it is definately much easier to a junior college for 1 or 2 years get really good grades and then transfer, that way USC doesn't have to worry about the transfer GPA's affecting their average. It is much easier. <br>  <br>  <br>  BTW, any chance you go to Corona Del sol high in tempe arizona?
FnE7BiYJaa	the verb is "are" present to be engaged (synonym), a fact|`|l2E4qEsAaa	It means that your community is one that is dedicated to exploring.  If it were you who was dedicated to exploring, there would be a comma after community.
PHlZ5sYgaa	It's difficult to say how hard or easy the SAT is. It depends on what kind of student you are and how you think. If you are a very logical student, with strong math and reading comprehension skills, a good grasp of grammar, and a strong vocabulary, it won't be difficult for you.<br>  <br>  It's great that you are starting early. The BEST things you can do at this time are to pay attention in math class and make sure you understand all of the concepts. The SAT basically only tests through 10th grade math, so by the end of this year, you should be able to have mastered the content.<br>  <br>  You should also read as much SAT-like material as you can. Read The New York Times, read boring articles about science or humanities. As you read, make sure you understand and can articulate the main ideas and the purpose of what you just read. Reading will also help you to absorb the grammar rules that are tested on the Writing section, and give you examples of good writing to help on the essay.<br>  <br>  Start to build your vocabulary. Buy some flashcards of the top 200 or 500 SAT words and learn 10 per week. Subscribe to the word of the day on Dictionary.com and spend some time playing on freerice,com or Spitcabulary (on facebook).<br>  <br>  Contact your local test preparation provider to take a free practice test. This will give you the experience of sitting for a 4 hour test and it will also help you to identify weak areas. If you plan to start a preparation program, now is the time to start looking into them because many contain a PSAT portion that takes place in the summer before 11th grade.<br>  <br>  The SAT essays are usually abstract questions "Is it necessary to have goals in life?" etc, but they expect concrete examples. you must write about the given topic and there is no way to know the topic ahead of time. You can, however, brainstorm examples that can apply to a variety of situations. For example, the Harry Potter series has so mamny different characters and plotlines, that you can often use it in SAT essay topics. You should also familiarize yourself with current events. The books you're reading in English class can go a long way in essay writing.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped. Good Luck!
L0t6l5m6aa	I would say it ultimately depends on what that 6th class you would drop is.  But to give you a more fulfilling answer, I would go with 5 APs and ASB.  It'll look good on applications to college.<br>  <br>  But really, it depends.  Don't drop something like AP Chemistry if you want to be a chemist!  You know what I mean.

3j9EpmHmaa	hey there! I am actually a member of Delta Gamma. The school should usually do two recruitments a year, one in the fall and one in the spring. If you don't hear anything about Sorority recruitment the first few weeks of school, contact any girl in any sorority really and they should be able to let you know whats going on! My school had all the girls interested in sororities visit all 9 of them on campus then make a decision which we wanted to pledge, and that sorority had to kind of choose us as well. We found out a few days after recruitment at Bid Day, which sorority was offering us a bid. If you don't have recruitment weeks at your school, just meet a girl in Delta Zeta and she will bring you to a couple DZ events, like dinner or movie night. You'll meet other DZs then they will decide if they want to offer you a bid or not. Hope this all helps let me know if you need more info! and Good Luck!!

KGKEOse5aa	What i've usually been told is people looking at classes would rather see you challenge yourself with say, honors level classes, and get something like a b or c than you take the regular level course and get an A+. Based on that, i think you should stick with honors geometry and just work hard and try not to slack off. Also don't be afraid to ask others for help in class or maybe even look into tutoring. good luck|`|ivkGknUsaa	Don't switch. a B in an honors class, as they say, is better than an A in a regular class. Don't worry too much that it's going to keep falling because that will only add up to the stress. If you're struggling, ask someone that can help you.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	A masters degree is a 2-year degree, and a bachelors degree is a 4-year degree.  However, you need to have the bachelors degree to apply to the masters program - the masters degree is more advanced.  Also, MBA programs require work experience.|`|lbgoHgDkaa	you get the bachelors degree before you get the masters degree.  after you get the bachelors you need to apply for graduate school and get into the masters degree.  the requirements for that is a lot more than the requirements of just getting into school.  they review your GPA, recommendations, experiences, entrance exam to the programs and maybe a few other things.  the bachelors (4 years) plus masters degree (2 years) will probably take 6+ years|`|5EGm6ZLhaa	A bachelor's is four years of education and a master's degree is an additional 12-24 months of education depending on the program. <br>  <br>  The latter comes after completion of the former

AA11313798	I think "I disagree" can be more openly used in an opinionated paper. For you're auguementative paper, you'd want to really state why you disagree. back it up with very detailed, supporting evidence or reasoning. <br>  <br>  It's more stronger if you use counter examples too. Such as stating what someone might say to you in return to counter your opinion, and then giving back your reply to that.<br>  <br>  it makes your arugment more stronger as you've sorta heard what they said and is giving back response.<br>  <br>  To be on the same side, you can give your arguements and counter examples, and save the I disagree for your conclusion...based on all your evidence.|`|e8EQviEXaa	I would state your argument and then at the vary last sentence say "I disagree based on the information presented for you."|`|aO5ErghMaa	Sure why not?

IziIntb5aa	it works at emptying your wallet and damaging your heart|`|wfsh1Irkaa	I don't recommend taking hydroxycut.  It is now ephedra-free but is still somewhat dangerous.  It is simply a product that minimzes your appetite.  In other words, it causes you to eat less in a day.  The side effect of eating less causes your metabolism to slow down.  You're not putting food in your body, in effect, your body reads it as , ok I need to slow down and conserve calories.  Thus, it slows your mebolism down.  The key is eating healthy and eating smaller meals throughout the day.  A product like hydroxycut wont make you lose weight or get ripped.  It's how hard you work for it.  If you want to get rip, chicken breast and broccoli with a bit of carbs.
ivkGknUsaa	No. I don't think it's necessary. The Philippines' system (6 years in elementary & 4 years of high school), in my opinion, is good already. 4 years of high school are enough to prepare you for college. <br>  <br>  I finished my 3rd year of high school in the Philippines, but after we moved here in the US I'm back at being sophomore again. I feel like I'm prepared for college already since this year is like my 4th year in high school. Also, the Philippines' regular high school curriculum is even faster and more stressful than the high school curriculum (with the exception of AP classes) here.|`|gjFi9U2iaa	no because most students are 18 by the the time they are a senior and 18 is the legal age (in the u.s). the students have to get out in the real world and start their own lives, anyways some students already go to high school for 5 years because they fail their classes.

DxbaEPbUaa	no you do not need a college degree. go to a technical college instead of a truck driving school. they are a rip off. after they train you they will require you to drive for them for a certain number of years to repay your debt and will send you all over the US with very little home time. go to the Department of Motor Vehicles and get a CDL Learner's Permit book and try to get your learner's permit before you go to school. that way you can study on your own and take your time. once you get in school you will be pressured to take and pass the test within two weeks. it's worse if you go to one of those trucker schools with a big company cause then you will be required to pass the test the first week. and if you don't they will send you home.|`|W3UYWpxiaa	No you don't have to go to college.  You don't have to go to truck driving school either.  If you can find a company that is willing to train you they can teach you rather than a school.

zCOvQwQhaa	How about Public Health.  There are a lot of courses from your present major that are applicable, it requires sold quant skills (as does your major), it can be really challenging study, and the impact of helping is very high.<br>  <br>  Unless you aspire to medical school and an altruistic medical career - Public Health could have the 'save the world' impact you're looking for.|`|2EIH11m8aa	You may want to look into a major like running a not for profit business, something like that can get you into something like running a soup kitchen or homeless shelter.  You may also want to look into something like a major in psychology and then finding a job out there that you can work with people in need. Psychology can open a lot of doors and it doesn't mean you have to become a psychologist.|`|SIhxrxD3aa	Possibly social work.

You will make absolutely no money, but social workers work with the sick and the poor. Also, another way to look at it is that if you take a job that makes you a higher salary, you will be better able to financially help needy people. You could work part time at something else and volunteer at a homeless shelter. It doesn't have to be all or nothing.|`|gsQX6a94aa	with regards to your question about what to major in, i can only think of you  speaking with your adviser, informing him/her of what interests you if you want to take this path.  and on hindsight,have you tried looking into missionary work? something like what Mother Teresa's organization does in India?  It is pure charity and dedication, and if i hear you right, you might be a very big help to them over there.  unfortunately, i don't know how to get in touch with them. maybe googling them will give you a lead... good luck.|`|NNNVRUltaa	I so agree with you on the parts about dehumanizing & money chains.

Also, just a normal lawyer would be somewhat beenficial just watch out u help the right people.<br>  Lastly, a politian, just make sure u dont become corrupt

AA10176626	Nida:<br>  <br>  You need to get on to this one right away - the "correct tax return info" notice indicates that you entered something incorrectly on your application - and that the problem was serious enough that they were not able to process the data.<br>  <br>  No processing = no calculation of your Expected Family Contribution score. <br>  <br>  No EFC score = no college notification.<br>  <br>  No college notification = no financial aid<br>  <br>  Your first tip off that there were problems with your FAFSA submission would have been that you did not receive an SAR report. SAR stands for Student Aid Report - under normal circumstances, a FAFSA applicant will receive an SAR within two or three weeks of submitting the application.<br>  <br>  Your SAR informs you what your Expected Family Contribution was computed to be - and it's the EFC itself that determines what kinds (and how much) financial aid you will be awarded.<br>  <br>  The Department of Education does not actually send your SAR to the school - you get an SAR, while the school gets something called an ISIR, which stands for Institutional Student Information Record. The most critical thing on the ISIR is your EFC, but there's also information for the school about your aid eligibility. The Department can not send an ISIR until your EFC score has been properly determined.<br>  <br>  When your college receives an EFC score for you, they use that score to determine what forms of aid you are eligible to receive. If your score is sufficiently low, you are said to demonstrate "exceptional need", and this classification qualifies you for special forms of financial aid, known as "need-based aid". No matter what your score is, you will be awarded access to the federal government's outstanding Stafford lending program, which will allow you to borrow money to help pay for your school.<br>  <br>  You'll need to go back and review your submitted FAFSA, in order to determine where you went wrong on your tax information. Return to the fafsa.ed.gov website, log in, using your PIN number, and then click under the big "3", where it says "Make corrections to a processed FAFSA".<br>  <br>  Work through the questions, looking specifically for those that refer to tax return information. It will help if you have the instructions in front of you while you're looking.<br>  <br>  You MUST get this resolved before you can receive financial aid, and the delay may cause you to lose out on some forms of aid that you might otherwise have qualified for. If you're stuck and you still can't figure out what went wrong, call the Department of Education's helpline at 1-800-4Fed-Aid, and someone will help you.<br>  <br>  Good luck - I hope this helped.<br>  <br>  Edit, based on your additional information: When you selected "will file" on the FAFSA that you submitted, you were then obligated to come back later, and update the application with the final numbers, as copied from your parents' tax returns. As I suggested, you should return to the FAFSA site, and provide "corrections" (updates, really) to the tax and income information you estimated on your original form.|`|8a65aa558e9ad4329fd6cecf8635eb04aa	SAR=Student Aid Report<br>  <br>  I'm not sure about your tax return info b/c the FAFSA only asks for yours and your parents (if you're not independent) income, wages, etc and income tax.|`|H6Lc79EOaa	From what I remember, I only got the SAR the first time I did FAFSA.  Look it over to make sure everything is correct.  If you qualify, you'll know it, and any college you decide to attend will know it, but also make sure to tell a financial aid counselor.  You will have to do the FAFSA every single year, no matter if you ever qualify or not.

Continuous is also used of anything that isn't broken into parts. for instance, a solid line is continuous, and a dashed line isn't.<br>  <br>  Constant is like both words, but it emphasizes the idea of not changing.

The song was written by the Sherman Brothers, and sung by Julie Andrews and Dick van Dyke.<br>  hear it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b-Z0SSyUcw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b-Z0SSyU...</a><br>  <br>  Origin<br>  According to Richard M. Sherman, co-writer of the song with his brother, Robert, the word was created by them in two weeks, mostly out of double-talk.<br>  <br>  The roots of the word have been defined[3] as follows: super- "above", cali- "beauty", fragilistic- "delicate", expiali- "to atone", and docious- "educable", with the sum of these parts signifying roughly "Atoning for educability through delicate beauty." It should be noted that although the word contains recognizable English morphemes, it does not follow the rules of English morphology as a whole. The morpheme -istic is a suffix in English, whereas the morpheme ex- is typically a prefix; so following normal English morphological rules, it would represent two words: supercalifragilistic and expialidocious. As one word, it also violates the rule that the letter c cannot sound like a k when followed by an e, an i or a y. An acceptable alternative spelling is supercalifragilisticexpealidocious, replacing the "pi" with "pe"<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercalifr...</a>

jGgOVd5Zaa	The thesaurus suggests: applicants, candidates, competition, competitors, contestants, entrants, entries, nominees, participants, possibilities, runners.<br>  <br>  You can say, 'those participating' or 'those who participated' although that can get clunky.  Depending on what they are participating in you can use a more specific term.  People participating in little league can be called players.  People in a medical study could be called patients (and see what I did there, calling them 'people in a medical study'.)  For a medical study you could also call them 'control groups', 'test groups', etc.  A lot of people don't like using 'they' or 'them' a lot in formal research papers, but if it makes it more readable, I'd say go for it.

AXiKJDV9aa	First calm down, you are doing just fine.  Most people that go to college have no idea what they want to do later, and of those that do most change their minds plenty of times.  Also these days every Tom, Dick, and Harry has a Bachelors - its like HS was 20 years ago.  The action these days is in graduate school.  <br>  <br>  Putting this all together suggests you should not worry at all about your undergrad - do whatever you like.  The key is to get into a school that will prepare you for graduate school.  The two schools I know that are are best on that basis are Harvey Mudd and New College Florida (they send 2/3's of their students to graduate school).<br>  <a href="http://www.hmc.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hmc.edu/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ncf.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncf.edu/</a><br>  <br>  When you are finished you will be in a much better position to know what you want to do and do a Masters at graduate school to get you there.<br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  Bill|`|451075cc0b28ffa413b31fd0b3fd84c0aa	I would suggest that you display a profound lack of maturity.  It is most common that juveniles display a lack of focus and a grasshopper-like atterntion span.  That is not to say you don't have ability, talent, etc. but you claim to lack focus.  Perhaps you are ADD, perhaps not.  Either way it is irrelevant.  If you are not "ready" to focus on a speciality, I suggest you go for a liberal arts degree.  I don't understand why your high school has not provided you with aptitude tests.  Career Counselors can provide better ones, for a fee.  But really, if you are not trying out different skills, then they will be of limited value. Volunteer.  Psychology?  Try a senior center.  Fashion? job at a clothes store.  Push the envelope.  As you mature (in several years or decades) you will gain the ability to focus if you are an "average" teenager. Both aptitude and personality tests will be useful to inform your decision on career.  I have told my kids that they should expect to have several careers during their life time so that college is simply a way to get a general education and at the same time get some creds for the first of a series of careers.  Not that much to sweat about, huh?<br>  BTW.  For fashion you'll need some talent.  Psyc only need the degree.  Not sure its that easy to land a job with either.  Need advanced degree for psych.  Its obvious that if you can, you should follow your bliss.  But don't forget that we all have strengths and weaknesses.  Once you know your strengths, you should chose a career where you can make the most of what God has given you.|`|xvxtQwV5aa	i was the same way, didn't know what to do, can't stick to one thing, and i started going to school for something I thought I wanted to do, only to get bored and drop out basically.

Anywhere you work will have a manager, and this is a great thing to start with for people that don't know exactly what they want to do but don't want to waste time trying to figure it out.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Schools will round your GPA off to two decimal places.  To become an astrophysicist, you really need a PhD in the field - there really aren't any jobs if you don't have one.  In high school, take all the math and lab science you can - bio, chem, and especially physics.  In college, major in physics and take courses in math, astronomy, and computer science.  Then go to grad school in physics or astrophysics.  To get into grad school, you'll need a minimum GPA of 3.0 in college, but most schools will expect a 3.5 or higher and research experience.|`|m5CiESVdaa	First, the word is "anyway" trust me.

gUpj51hxaa	I am currently a sophomore, and have the class. I absolutely love it! We engage in class discussions, debates in which we take on the persona of a major historical figure, and have some pretty cool projects! We are doing very helpful things to prepare for the AP exam, and I think it will be all the worth it. In this course, we are responsible to cover almost 50 chapters come time for the AP exam. In my class, we do two or three chapters per week. This was really hard at first, but I learned from it, and became accustomed. We also do practice Document-Based Questions that resemble those that will appear on the AP exam. These are obviously times, and vary widely in topic. Over time, you will become accustomed to these as well. Let me just tell you though, the chapter tests themselves are very broad in detail, so it is important to Study, Study, Study!!!<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|xUTeIaH1aa	I was a History Major at Arizona State. The only thing I can really tell you is that in my experience the further you get into history, the less it becomes about memorizing dates and facts and the more it becomes about what impact did this person/event have. What was the historical significance of this. That and a lot of reading...a lot of reading. Mind an AP class will expect a certain amount of memorization, but i think you'll find it becomes less about that if you go further with it. Good luck to you. Hope that helps.

Psychology is a science that studies the human behavior, the way people elaborate their thoughts and how them influence their acts.<br>  Psychologists and psychiatrists are not the same. Psychyatrists are physicians and they treat mental diseases from an organic point of view. Psychologists do not go to the medical school, and as i see it, they treat people from a "teaching a way to think" point of view.<br>  I′m an MD so I know something about it.|`|PG7WfGpHaa	In the 60's everybody studied Art.  In the 70's everybody studied Sociology.  In the 80's and 90's it was Media Studies. These days it is Sports Studies or Psychology.

Psychoanalysis is the analysis and treatment of people who you interact with in a clinical setting. And there are more specialties than that!

MnXmSGPRaa	Well, if you want some elaboration...I think a lot of them are typically more punks, but their are a lot of just people who don't feel like it too.<br>  <br>  You won't find someone cutting by themselves, so they just do it to be with friends. Or look cool. Some people really cannot stand a class, and I know I've even been tempted to cut, even though I have not. They may feel the teacher is mean, or they just don't like the work. Like so many cut my math and p.e classes, CUXse they involve work. <br>  One more reason, that's a lil easier to understand, is because of how their life is. Sure, a lot of kids are dramatic about their homelife and even so, it's not an excuse, but some really cannot focus on class. They don't care, they want to take school as their only chance to do what they want. <br>  Of course, no one has ever said that, but you can tell by looking at some of them that is the case, with combinations of others.

b1sB4fuGaa	ashville nc|`|B9yfHeRYaa	There's a whole chain of schools called Waldorf. It's for tree-hugging hippie-freaks, and I'm in 8th grade and I LOVE THAT TREE-HUGGING HIPPIE-FREAK SCHOOL! It's a whole chain, and not just in America but I'm pretty sure in other countries too. It was founded by Rudolph Steiner, but sadly I don't think there's any Waldorf Colleges. If you get to know the Waldorf communities, maybe they can tell you. They're all about the eco-friendly sh*t! I love my eco-friendly school!<br>  <br>  (I'm emo, btw, and nobody has a problem with it in any of the Waldorf schools I've met people from...)|`|4f53edbce16f4673f58a9dcccc9dfddfaa	I go to the University of Iowa and although there's a good number of frat boys and sorority girls who annoy me and also a good number of indie kids (who annoy me also, but not to the same extent), we also have a ton of hippies because it's a very liberal campus and city.  Not so many goths, I'm actually one of the few people I've seen on campus that I'd consider goth,and there's a handful of punks I've seen also, but the campus seems overall pretty accepting of different types of people. <br>  As far as parties, I think most are like dumb frat boy parties here, but like my friends aren't necessarily any of the things you mention (goth/emo/hippie, etc) but they're sort of intellectual types and to an extent are kind of weird, but actually have pretty decent parties.  With no rap, lol.  It just depends on what group of people you get in with once you get to college for what types of parties you'll go to.  My freshman year the friends I had didn't drink and I didn't go to parties at all and felt left out and then my sophomore year I had a switch in friends who happened to party, so that was nice.  And oh, there is a goth night in town, although it's not that great to be honest.|`|8CCttFS6aa	Most places in the upper new york state area are very carefree. Schools such as Newpaltz and Cobleskill are notorious for the many barefoot students playing guitar underneath trees and such. Idk about the whole punk, emo thing.

Harvard and Yale kind of skate by on reputation and they are not much more difficult schools than any where else in the country (in fact I go to a Tier 2 school and we use some of the same casebooks as them and read just as much).  <br>  <br>  For law school (I have no idea about MIT) you will have to spend about 40-50 hours reading a week, 15 hours of class a week, and 8 hours a week reviewing what was covered in class.  It averages to around 60-70 hours depending on the week, and obviously much more time as exams approach.|`|AXiKJDV9aa	Law school is supposed to be tough - probably al least 10-12 hours a day.

8YYwdccpaa	Yes, serious mental illness would be considered a legitimate medical problem. If you have been working with a psychiatrist and she supports you, getting a letter or certificate from her is the right path to take.<br>  <br>  You might not need to make an appointment to do this. Start by calling her office and talking to someone on her staff. Explain that you've been her patient since X date. Explain that you've been away from college from X to X period of time, and that the college needs an official notice of your medical concerns to qualify your absence from school. Give the name and address of the college official who needs to have this notice. <br>  <br>  I'm sure your doctor has done these before and probably has a basic form letter she can submit. So it might not require anything more than a phone call to get this done. Good luck.

Jr6emga0aa	There is a nuance of difference in that "it" refers more generally while "that" is more specific. <br>  <br>  For example, if someone is getting a massage, she might say "Oh, I like IT." meaning that she is enjoying the whole experience. If the masseuse happens to do something particularly pleasurable, the subject might say, "Oh, I like THAT." <br>  <br>  In the specific instance cited, the use of "it" might have meant that you enjoyed the idea of hearing jokes while "that" meant that you liked a particular joke and were pointing to it as the most recent one. (If you heard a joke after the one in question, you would not say "I like that." because the reference would be taken to be the most recent one. You could, however, say "I like it" meaning hearing both jokes or jokes in general.)|`|COhYuTj3aa	"it" and "that" are both pronouns and acceptable.  "It" stands alone while "that" usually precedes the subject.|`|yAtGrX1Yaa	in the context of your initial statement, you need to specify what "that" is - "oh, i like that joke", or "oh, i like that burrito" or "oh, i like that there is no capitalization in this answer".  if you wanted to omit the subject, you should have said "it"

ZG6DeAzPaa	It is "dumbing down." <br>  <br>  It is when you take something complicated, and make it simpler so people can understand it. <br>  <br>  Ex: Mike was giving a presentation on math to middle schoolers. Sarah noticed that he was using advanced calculus in his presentation, and told him that his presentation needed serious dumbing down if those kids were going to be able to understand it.|`|bc982766cd7e6de17f0a04a14c081adfaa	It means to make simpler, so that even a "dummy" would understand.
ORonhAuvaa	If you are suffering abuse you will have a hard time regulating your emotions, so you have to understand that you are more easily angered by people. Another student might just laugh it off, but you won't be able to do that. You are going to keep rolling this thing around in your head and getting all fired up about it. That is part of the profile of an abused child. I know because I was one. I still have a hard time not taking everything personally.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, none of what happened to you is OK. But you will learn that the only person you can control is yourself. You will have bosses like this as well, so it may be best to learn how to ignore the heck out of them. <br>  <br>  One thing you can say to your teacher when she says something mean is to ask her to speak as respectfully to you as you are talking to her. It may take her aback.|`|inZ9CWBiaa	Two things - I think that maybe your other issues have made you a bit sensitive to this situation. Fair enough. I don't know what you're going through. Teachers need to be aware that students have lives outside of school that can make them sensitive, and think about how they say things. She might have meant that you hadn't given the student much feedback so that they don't have anything to work on. (Don't know what kind of paper you marked)  So - you need to go part way and accept that there may have been some combination of misunderstanding, over-sensitivity, and people having a bad day.<br>  <br>  Is the guidance counselor you went to the only one in your school? Is there another teacher or staff member that you can trust that you could talk to about this? <br>  <br>  I think that it is great that you are getting counseling to deal with your difficulties. Remember, things often seem bigger than they are, keep things in perspective and don't let it affect your education.

YWsDow7vaa	I don't think it's ever too early.  And I think it would be really telling, in today's financial crisis environment, to examine how the different schools are handling this - how they're looking to make ends meet and what - if anything - they're looking to cut.<br>  <br>  You'll be able to gauge the focus of the school, the dedication of the staff and parental involvement by finding out how they handle a crisis. <br>  <br>  You should be able to find mundane things like test scores/performance online - teacher/student ratio and # of specialists.  However, important things like hands on teaching, field trips, 'classroom parents' and whatnot will only be found by getting to the school, touring and asking questions.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to ask for Family references.  People you can call and chat with to find out how they feel about the school and why they feel the way they do.  <br>  <br>  Good luck in your search!|`|lzEuuseJaa	No, it's not too early, because sometimes what you hear about a school's reputation isn't exactly what you find out when you dig deeper. So by investigating early, you will have time to find out more about the school. You will meet other moms with info, look at the school's website over time, meet kids who go to the schools, etc. This will help you to make an informed decision.<br>  <br>  If you decide on a private school, you may find the right "feeder" preschool to send your child to. You may need time to save up, or make career decisions based on education decisions. If you decide on a public school, maybe it's out of your neighborhood, but there may be a way to get a permit, best to have time to figure it out or to plan a move. Also, in some areas to get into a good magnet school there is a point system that you will need to know about to *play the game*. <br>  <br>  Talk to moms in parks, etc, that's how you'll get the best info. = )<br>  <br>  Public school ratings: <a href="http://www.greatschools.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.greatschools.net/</a><br>  Private school lists: <a href="http://www.privateschoolreview.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.privateschoolreview.com/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2nqmoerIaa	I think its a good idea  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Dom K|`|4Mgruc8Oaa	It is not too early.  In fact, now is the perfect time to begin watching trends of schools you might be interested in.  By that, I mean start gathering information on test scores, class sizes, teacher experience; then spend the next few years watching those trends.  If test scores drop, you might want to think about another school.  Also find out about mobility; how long do students stay at the school before moving on.  If its not long, there's a reason.

TYzNTT7caa	This question is so vague it is hard to know how to respond. I don't know, however, why it would be wrong to add part of a quote to an essay. You should indicate where you have abbreviated or truncated the quotation.<br>  <br>  Even if you use only part of the quotation you write the endnote or reference in the usual way.<br>  <br>  Example. You are quoting from "The Gettysburg Address" found in a book called _Selected Speeches._ The quote you use is "Four score and seven years ago our forefathers brought forth on this continent a new nation...dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal." (Lincoln 89) <br>  <br>  In the bibliography you list<br>  <br>  Lincoln, Abraham. _Selected Speeches._ New York: Scribners, 1998.|`|BeSZ4nXraa	Yes you can omit parts, but just use "..." for the parts you leave out so people know you changed it, and don't switch words around or anything.  To cite the source, there are many different styles, so ask you teacher what s/he prefers.  Basically the principle is that you need to give enough information so someone else could find your source. You'd probably need to write something like "person, quoted in - the book you have - publisher, year page number.  The format depends on what the teacher wants and expects.

Otherwise, if you are planning on going to college for this, just make sure that you are taking whatever you need to take to graduate from high school and get into the college that you want to go to.

So maybe you could get your mum to buy you some if she really wants to help you and just do your best and do your homework to show your mum your really trying and just think school as fun i guess i hate school too but you just have to try and like them because if you dont they seem harder.<br>   Good look<br>   hope i helped<br>   georgia x

m01ijLFUaa	If you want to increase your reading speed, you can only really do that by reading !<br>  Speed Reading can help you to read and understand written information much more quickly. This makes it an essential skill in any environment where you have to master large volumes of information quickly, as is the norm in fast-moving professional environments. What's more, it's a key technique to learn if you suffer from "information overload", because it helps you to become much more discriminating about the information that you consume.<br>  <br>  The Key Insight<br>  The most important trick about speed reading is to know what information you want from a document before you start reading it. If you only want an outline of the issue that the document discusses, then you can skim the document quickly and extract only the essential facts. If you need to understand the real detail of the document, then you need to read it slowly enough to gain the full understanding you need.<br>  <br>  You will get the greatest time savings from speed reading by learning to skim excessively detailed documents, although the techniques you'll learn will help you improve the speed of all the reading you do.<br>  <br>  Technical Issues<br>  Even when you know how to ignore irrelevant detail, there are other technical improvements you can make to your reading style which will increase your reading speed.<br>  <br>  Most people learn to read the way young children read – either letter-by-letter, or word-by-word. As an adult, this is probably not the way you read now: Just think about how your eye muscles are moving as you read this. You will probably find that you are fixing your eyes on one block of words, then moving your eyes to the next block of words, and so on. You are reading blocks of words at a time, not individual words one-by-one. You may also notice that you do not always go from one block to the next: sometimes you may move back to a previous block if you are unsure about something.<br>  <br>  A skilled reader will read many words in each block. He or she will only dwell on each block for an instant, and will then move on. Only rarely will the reader's eyes skip back to a previous block of words. This reduces the amount of work that the reader's eyes have to do. It also increases the volume of information that can be assimilated in a given period of time.<br>  <br>  A poor reader will become bogged down, spending a lot of time reading small blocks of words. He or she will skip back often, losing the flow and structure of the text, and confusing his or her overall understanding of the subject. This irregular eye movement makes reading tiring. Poor readers tend to dislike reading, and they may find it harder to concentrate, and understand written information.<br>  <br>  How to Use Tool:<br>  Speed reading aims to improve reading skills by:<br>  <br>  Increasing the number of words read in each block.<br>  <br>  Reducing the length of time spent reading each block. <br>  <br>  And reducing the number of times your eyes skip back to a previous sentence. <br>  <br>  These are explained below:<br>  <br>  Increasing the number of words in each block:<br>  This needs a conscious effort. Try to expand the number of words that you read at a time: With practice, you'll find you read faster. You may also find that you can increase the number of words in each block by holding the text a little further from your eyes. The more words you can read in each block, the faster you will read! <br>  Reducing fixation time:<br>  The minimum length of time needed to read each block is probably only a quarter of a second. By pushing yourself to reduce the time you take, you will get better at picking up information quickly. Again, this is a matter of practice and confidence. <br>  Reducing skip-back:<br>  To reduce the number of times that your eyes skip back to a previous sentence, run a pointer along the line as you read. This could be a finger, or a pen or pencil. Your eyes will follow the tip of your pointer, smoothing the flow of your reading. The speed at which you read using this method will largely depend on the speed at which you move the pointer. <br>  You will be able to increase your reading speed a certain amount on your own by applying these speed reading techniques.<br>  <br>  What you don't get out of self-study is the use of specialist reading machines and the confidence gained from successful speed-reading – this is where a good one-day course can revolutionize your reading skills.<br>  <br>  Key points:<br>  By speed reading you can read information more quickly. You may also get a better understanding of it, as you will hold more of it in short term memory.<br>  <br>  To improve the speed of your reading, read more words in each block and reduce the length of time spent reading each block. Use a pointer to smooth the way your eyes move and reduce skip-back.<br>  <br>  :D|`|VlBncwFDaa	There may not have good organization teaching speed reading everywhere in the world.

The pun is the double meaning of seeing less of him.  If he went away to the program he would not be around and the obvious intention of the statement seeing less of him.  But because he is going to the Biggest loser he would be losing weight (hopefully) and thus there may also be less of him to see if he loses weight,  Make sense?|`|l195kTc6aa	it when something is said in a way that has an association ....not meant to be funny..but can turn out to be cuz of the way it is said.<br>  <br>  example....lets say u work with a guy named Scott, he tells you yea I got this killer deal I practically got it free...then another person says..."well you got off scott free" and then u realize oh yea his name is scott...so then u would say..."oh no pun intended"<br>  <br>  So scott got a deal and he got is scott free....thats how it works.|`|COhYuTj3aa	pun  (pn)<br>  n.<br>  A play on words, sometimes on different senses of the same word and sometimes on the similar sense or sound of different words.|`|AA11485682	A pun is a type of joke based on words sounding alike.

kNPJaPmLaa	A contract is a written agreement between two parties (they can be natural "persons" or corporate entities) to do something in exchange for something. I can write a contract that my friend has to cut my grass in exchange for a specific amount of money. If he doesn't cut the grass, he doesn't get the money. If he does cut the grass, and I don't pay the money, he gets a judgment against me, because I agreed, in the contract, to pay him.<br>  <br>  A contract is not valid if the parties do not have the capacity to know what they're agreeing to (a child cannot enter a contract, a mental deficient, a dead person, a dog). <br>  <br>  A contract is not valid if it is illegal (you cannot contract someone to commit a crime). <br>  <br>  A contract has to involve an exchange of something of value (one dollar, and/or "other valuable consideration") <br>  <br>  Best to you.

Zg4s4wRzaa	In 2008 NYU did not accept any student with a 3.6 GPA or lower. However, there were students who had 3.75 GPAs and had received 2080 on their SAT who were still rejected. A 1700 on your PSAT with no preparation is extremelly impressive, but a 1900 on your SAT 1 on a college application to NYU is not. To apply to a school like NYU, your goal for the SAT should be 2100 minimum. Work hard this semester to get a 4.0 and raise your GPA. Start planning your schedule as a junior; make sure you take AP classes you know you will be able to handle. Taking AP classes will raise your GPA and will give you college credit if you do well on your AP tests.<br>  <br>  You need to remember that NYU is a dream school for thousands of students, and that a good GPA and SAT score are not enough because there will be many others just like you. If you're on the track team at school, work hard to make it to CCS and farther. Work on making your great portfolio even greater. Remember: there are thousands of other people working just as hard as you and even more who are working harder.<br>  <br>  You have a chance if you start working hard right now. It would be great if you retook the PSAT as a junior and got a score that would qualify you for the scholarship. Study hard for the SAT 1 & 2: borrow books from the library or take a summer class. Your junior year is the most important year in high school - don't screw it up. When you apply for the university, make sure you write a fantastic essay. Work hard, raise those grades and test scores, continue to perfect the qualities that make you stand out, and you'll have a good chance of being accepted by NYU.|`|bamJbojRaa	yes yaar!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  all the best|`|lQIKWXDuaa	Your GPA is extremely low for NYU. you need like a 3.5+.

AA10911602	My family eat "take out" infrequently. My wife ensures we all have a good and balanced diet. Why do I tell you that? Junk food is a treat my kids like but hate having it too often. The price goes up and my family will have it less often - this would influence the wise eaters.<br>  <br>  McDonald's, Australia has said that they are going to raise prices in poorer areas where diet is the last thing people think about.

There are jobs everywhere you just need to find them. You may need to relocate. I would say you need actual work experience, there comes a point where education can only take you so far.

6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	Would depend on the type of courses that are included and whether the institution is accredited in some form.  But in general, a 3 credit hour course meets for approximately 3 hours per week over a 15-16 week schedule.  So about 45 hours a semester. If I am interpeting your 760 hours correctly then it would be 760/ 45 =~ 16-17 three credit courses or 48-51 semester credit hours.  That's about late sophomore standing.  Again, equivalency would depend on the courses itself and the granting institution so a blind calculation is not very accurate.

Jr6emga0aa	Acting is a form of pretending. Sometimes characters in a stage or screen play are played by the real people, who are not acting in the strictest sense of the word although they are saying words written by a writer. So, if a part is played by an actor, it is "acted by"; if a part is played by someone not an actor, it is "played by" . Sometimes in the credits at the end of a movie you'll see characters names together with the names of the actors but occasionally you'll see HIMSELF next to the character's (real) name.
xgcJsAj0aa	What are you trying to do......??|`|MDQrdno8aa	It depends on the application.<br>  Generally, a precision rectifier using an opamp will be better for small-signal circuits where you might need accuracy down to fractions of a volt.  An opamp will not have the current capability to do what a bridge rectifier does.<br>  <br>  A bridge rectifier is used in power supply circuits.  In a traditional unregulated power supply, the power transformer will plug into the wall, then the bridge will change the AC waveform from the transformer into pulsating DC, which is then filtered with large capacitors to form a smooth DC power source for a circuit.<br>  <br>  You can get bridge rectifiers that can handle lots of current for powering circuits that require considerable amounts of power; the type of power that no opamp could ever provide.

Also statistics GCSE will help. Maths and English are compulsory anyway so do well in them too. DO NOT do psychology or sociology GCSE because Unis don't really count it as anything. A language is always useful.<br>  <br>  2) Make up artist/Fashion designer in theatre: Do art, graphics for your options and do well in maths and english. Also worth taking is a language / humanities subject preferably history. Drama might be worth taking but try avoiding it if it's backstage stuff you're interested in.<br>  <br>  For A level:<br>  <br>  1)Psychologist/Psychiatrist: Definitely biology and chemistry and for psychiatry I'd even say maths. DO NOT do psychology for A level as it is useless as degree level at Unis don't ask for it at all. Degree lengths aren't more than 4 years I think (not sure on that one so check at www.ucas.com )<br>  <br>  2) Make up artist/ fashion designer: Definitely art, english and I'd even say maths or history up to a certain extent. Course lengths really vary so again check the site as I'm not sure. <br>  <br>  Advice:<br>  <br>  Psychology and psychiatry will ensure you a stable job and it is hard work at Uni but once you get into it, you will have a good job and earning will be good depending on post graduate skills.<br>  <br>  Make up artist and fashion design is good but hit-and-miss and unless you have a good art portfolio, you may not have a stable job. However, if you get success at one spot, it could be your steps to big money. Do rethink theatre as your option because it really narrows down job opportunities for a make up artist or fashion designer.

Just an interesting contrast when you see all the side effects of hormone based birth control for women. And do you talk about Plan B - or is that the same as the emergency contraception?  Not to stir up controversy - but since your report is on birth control, rather than contraception - are you going to include abortion? Oh, and even the ancient Egyptians had some interesting methods of birth control - I seem to remember something about crocodile dung (I know - yuk) - so your report is OK if you are just discussing modern birth control, but there's some fascinating historic stuff as well. Are IUDs and spermicides in your report?<br>  <br>  Edit: Sorry - Just one more thing - when you discuss advantages and disadvantages - it may be better to discuss it for each type.  In regard to cancer, I recall that the rates of some types of cancer also go up with the pill - but, my info may be out of date.

All the possibilities are quite different--community college (which is  there anytime you have the money and the time); the airforce--with the dislocations, but clear career choices that offers; JSU, to which you have evidently been accepted; and the collection agency.<br>  <br>  You need to ask yourself: why do I want to go to college?  What do I want to study--and how does that fit into my long-term goals? What job am I trying to get after I graduate? If you do the collection agency, you need to ask: is this a job I can do for a while?  What are the possibilities for advancement?  Do I like the work?

a93e72e806f4b80afaedd35f330600edaa	Okay, I will do this the best way I can:<br>  <br>  Paragraph #1<br>  "Although my path leading to law school is far from traditional, I know that my life experiences will give me a competitive edge as I fight for my future clients if I am blessed with the privilege to practice law. As I reflect on my past, it is very apparent that my becoming a prospective law student is indicative of a noteworthy and lasting transformation. Seven years ago I was an immature and aimless underachiever, but I’ve developed into a mature, self-disciplined leader with a proven record of excellence during six years of honorable service in the U.S. Air Force"<br>  <br>  1.)  "if I am blessed with the privilege to practice law." It sounds WAY too forced and you should just rephrase it in a much more professional way. It sounds much too casual for a law school admissions essay.<br>  <br>  Paragraph #2<br>  "My father served over twenty-five years as an Army officer. While I’m truly thankful for the exposure to various cultures I acquired during my nomadic upbringing, the constant upheaval deprived me of strong roots or stability in any one region. When Dad finally retired and stability seemed to be looming on the horizon, my parents divorced. At age sixteen, I was withdrawn from public school in order to home school, work two jobs and help in the raising of my two younger brothers. After re-enrolling into public schools, I never fully got into high gear. Although I scored well on my ACT and received a college scholarship, I had no clear goals or ambitions, and I was a first-round knockout with an abysmal 0.11 GPA that freshman year."<br>  <br>  1.) Honestly... this seems to bring up an "it's everyone else's but mine" fault. I feel like you're not able to assume responsibility for your own actions, so why should I give you the chance at my law school when you couldn't even do well as a freshman in high school? You really need to find some way to sell that yes, it was your fault, in your hands, but you can come back. If you can't handle those situations and still maintain a good GPA in high school, how are you going to far in law school or in the real world of law?<br>  <br>  Paragraph #3<br>  "Subsequently, I enlisted in the U.S. Air Force because I wanted time to develop more maturity and confidence. I got what I wanted and more. Six years in the military, including a rigorous year-long language course and deployment to the Middle East, has helped transform me into a serious, self-disciplined and mature student."<br>  <br>  1.) HOW did it change you? HOW are you going to bring it into your legal career? HOW does this differentiate you from every other candidate? You seem to be simply brushing over your military career when it may very well be your biggest point. Keep this to just one paragraph.<br>  <br>  And it goes on... honestly, it seems like the personal statement is all over the place. You need to have on clear objective and one thesis. WHY should they accept you? You need to show them... I personally don't think that this is up to par with other admissions essays, and other can feel free to agree with me, but I think you need to overhaul this entire personal statement and give it a little more direction.

Hopefully, you have figured it out by now, but if not, here are the answers:  1. lived is the simple predicate and   lived in Alabama is the complete predicate.  2. became and became famous in 1955.  3.rode  and rode on the bus one day in the city of Montgomery.  4. fought  and fought for her rights.  5. claimed  and claimed her seat on the bus.  6. showed and showed a great deal of courage.    Do you get it now? The simple predicate is just the verb and the complete predicate is the rest of sentence from the verb to the end.

Anything else that can push you over the top, is just a bonus. We do accept graduates right out of college with BA/BS, but again...just the elite.

General statements like "he is lazy" will be seen as whining, and if it gets back to him, you are correct that you will be in trouble.  If, on the other hand, you say, "I timed it, and during the hour of class he spent exactly 3 minutes on Monday and 6 minutes on Wednesday dealing with students.  The rest of the time, he had us work in our workbooks while he texted his friends and took a smoke break in the restroom.  When Adam asked him a question about one of the problems, he yelled at him to go back to his seat and leave him alone.  The whole semester has been like this, and although we are trying, most of us don't understand the problems in the workbook well enough to pass the tests, but when we ask him for help, he refuses."<br>  <br>  Do you see the difference?

Use a word processor that includes a spell checker and a grammar checker.  Proofread and revise your work.  Very few writers are able to write a good paragraph without proofreading and revising it several times.<br>  <br>  The paragraph you wrote for your question is very good, it just needs proper punctuation.  If you're basing your opinion of your writing on feedback from other people, please remember that different people have different opinions.  Correct grammar and punctuation are really not negotiable.  Style and syntax are very personal.<br>  <br>  My first semester in college, I had a professor who told me I would never be anything other than a mediocre writer.  The very next semester, I turned in a term paper that the professor (a different professor) described as the best he had ever received from an undergraduate.  I hadn't changed my writing style or taken any writing courses between the two events - I just had different professors.<br>  <br>  One exercise that I've heard about, but never used, is to select a topic at random from some source (dictionary, thesaurus, news reports, etc) and write 500 words on the topic.  Do this every day until you can write "on demand".  I used to play instrumental music, usually classical or baroque, when I needed to write something but couldn't seem to get any words on paper.  I don't have to resort to this very often now.|`|2ef6c8380bef5a28128bee98974a1208aa	Take literature and practice proper english courses. Speaking is only a small talent and good looks as well.

AA10887916	Prior to 1850, the key figure was Edgar Allen Poe.  In the 50 year period you specify the main crime writers were Conan-Doyle, Wilkie Collins: Paul Feval and Emile Gaboreau. Charles Dickens essentially wrote only one book that may be considered crime fiction 'Bleak House'. This is very much a nascent period for crime fiction, and the more prolific and well known figures only started to come to prominence 10-20 years into the 1900s.|`|2HETgiwgaa	Arthur Conan Doyle|`|AA12301916	Surely Arthur Conan Doyle will feature, he wrote the Sherlock Holmes stories. Then, for Russia, Fyodor Dosdoyevski, who wrote Crime and Punishment. Back to the UK, you have Charles Dickens writing Bleak House in 1852.

iFCBEZW7aa	Hey Ami.<br>  When you are drunk your brain is a bit mixed up, slurred speech, slow reactions, basically you aren't sure of what your doing or what anyone is doing.<br>  So when someone you usually wouldn't have sexual activity with, see's you are drunk, they see this as a chance to have sex with you, even though if you were sober you wouldn't give them a second look.<br>  In the morning you may forget it happened, or be very confused to why it happened.<br>  Hope this helps you out!<br>  x|`|8jQ3FBpAaa	it means that guys are are going to take advantage of the situation of you being drunk,  so that they can have sex with you.|`|kV9GlWDFaa	lol well my good friend. when one is intoxicated and the alcohol has done the job. you might loose certain things you were able to access just fine and dandy while sober. an example being good judgement.

9faf164b8bfd02a8adbd83229d74816baa	Its basic math really. You'll hardly ever see algebraic equations on a recipe. You'll see stuff like 1/2 or 1/4 cup of whatever or 1 pound or 2 and 1/2 pounds of whatever ingredient. I myself have never seen anything beyond basic math when cooking so I doubt you'll have that many problems with the math.|`|gNFPy6S0aa	You need a good grasp of basic numeracy to calculate weights and measures, and to prepare costings for a menu, and you need a basic understanding of chemistry in order to come to grips with the underlying principles of cookery.|`|gKciLUBLaa	Basic maths is all thats required, due to the fact that you will need to measure a certain amount of an ingredient and times it by how ever many portions are being served.
