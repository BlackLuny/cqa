20090307112920AAw8VGz	Travel;Canada;Other - Canada	What do I do about a gift subscription to a magazine I now dislike?	My mother's been giving me a subscription to "Canadian Living" for years, if not decades.  (Similar to "Ladies Home Journal", e.g.)      Until the last year or so, I've found it a really good source of all kinds of ideas for better living.  But they seem to have new editor(s) or something. Now, most issues have things I consider offensive, if not dangerous.  I have written the magazine, giving (middle-of-the-road) reasons for objecting, but have seen no response, either direct or indirect. So, I've given up.       I'd like to write, cancelling my subscription, but I don't know how to go about it. Should I ask for a refund? Should I ask them to send her a refund? Should I tell her at all?      I don't want to be rude to her: her gift started with good energy; it's the magazine & my attitudes that have changed.       But I don't want her to waste her money on a magazine I no longer want. (In fact, the environmental waste involved in receiving anything I don't want is strongly offensive to me.)      I'm tempted to ask her to give a donation to "Changing the Present", a site oriented to people who want to make a gift without generating more junk. Instead, a person makes a contribution to a charity of their choice, in the name of the honoured person, who receives a card saying so. (That was an un-authorized advertisement!)       But I think that telling (or even suggesting) what kind of gift I want from someone (unless they ask, directly) is really rude!      Any way out of this bind?

I'm considering transferring to UNO, but my mom is objecting to it on the basis I don't have anyone to live with there and she said the dorms are bad.

Now we all know that it is common these days to take package holidays to Europe of even more expensive/adventurous holidays.

20090307130451AAvahAX	Travel;Europe (Continental);Other - Europe	My boyfriend is Bulgarian, I am American. We want to get married in Bulgaria, any tips?	I will be moving to Bulgaria sometime next year. As far as I can tell, I can just go over there, without a visa, and get married within the 90 days I am allowed to stay there as an American citizen. I am wondering if anyone in the same situation (American/Bulgarian citizens married IN Bulgaria), know if there are any other requirements. I know we will both have to prove we aren't currently married, our citizenship, etc. Anything else? Also, following the wedding, we plan on living in the country for at least a year before moving back the U.S. and starting the long immigration process/hassle. Once I marry my boyfriend, will it be fairly easy for me to get a long-stay visa to stay in Bulgaria for a year? Sadly, I have visited and have seen firsthand how the government can sometimes be corrupt and cause trouble for visitors (although I have to say, I have been to many countries, and going through customs in Sofia was THE EASIEST and most friendly I have ever experienced, even in my OWN country). So, any tips on how I can get everything all in order and give no reason for the BG authorities to give me any grief would be great. Thanks!

20090307123919AAAO9Wz	Travel;Caribbean;Cuba	Can I drive my car to Cuba, and then back to America?  Do I need special permits?	I'm building a lightweight floatation platform, sort of like a pontoon boat, except the pontoons fold up really tight so the thing can be easily towed behind my Toyota Matrix. (trailer/pontoon has fold-up trailer wheels).        I've tested a 1/10 scale model and it works fine, so I'm building the full sized model now.      I want to tow it to boat launches in Florida, and then use it to go to the Bahamas, Cuba, and many other places, and then actually drive around these islands (towing my trailer) instead of just seeing the areas around the harbor.       But, If I do travel to Cuba or Bahamas, do I need any special licence plates or government paperwork to allow me to simply just drive around with the locals?      And in this economy, do you think that visiting this way would be safe?  I just read a story of how tourists in Mexico are being beat up just for the money they are carrying with them.  So with everyone getting laid off, is it still safe to be a tourist, or would I come face to face with a guy with a gun, asking for me to hand him the keys to my car?

20090307125353AAz18u4	Travel;Mexico;Other - Mexico	Mexicans, Mexicans what is all the fuss?	I am sorry I just looked up Mexicans and there are so many hateful comments about Mexicans being lazy and ugly and this or that, I am of Mexican parents and was born in the US and I am proud of both countries, I was brought up speaking mostly Spanish but speak both English and Spanish fluently. I have a job and although I had my two oldest sons when I was pretty young I did not go to welfare but rather worked my a$$ off for them. I have three sons one is an infant and he is Hispanic/Black so is he going to be target for nasty comments such as the ones seen earlier? I think people stereotype too much and to me its sad, there are lazy people in ALL races and hard working people in ALL races, we as humans unfortunately only see the bad.

I looked at all the discount sites ( incl. priceline, kayak, voodoo, tiss, flights etc) and the cheapest flight is $1300, from BOS to FRA, staying six weeks from July to August. I know that the general rule is: the later you book, the more expensive it gets. I was just wondering if it is any different this year due to the global economic crisis. I am looking for very specific input from maybe an airline or booking agent. I don't need general advice, I fly every year. Thank you for looking at my question.

20090307145037AAu53xP	Travel;United States;Phoenix	Can someone please give me some REAL answers about what moving to Arizona will be like?	I am a 23 year old who will be moving with her fiance from Ohio to Queen Creek Arizona. We are moving to Queen Creek because his mother and sister live there and he misses them. I am very used to the heat so the 110 degree temperatures do not worry me. We will be living with his family until we settle in and can find a place of our own in about a year, so I don't need any information about what housing prices are like either. What worries me is a few things:       1. I have checked on yahoo answers and many people say that Arizonians are very unfriendly, is this true? I'm not saying that people in Ohio are friendly but we don't try to run people out of the state who try to movie here.       2. I have heard that Queen Creek is like No Mans Land. How bad is it really? I have heard that commuting to to Phoenix is a pain, but what about just regular shopping? Will I have to travel 30 mins just to get groceries? Are there bookstores, coffee shops near?       3. I heard that Queen Creek isn't really all that developed. Will I have trouble moving my Directv and cable internet? I love my Directv and would want to keep it at all costs. Is this going to be a problem? Same with my cable internet, will this be a problem?       4. Are there many things to do in Arizona? I moved to Ohio from Florida and there is nothing to do in Ohio besides go to the mall. Will we have better luck in Arizona? What is there to do for someone my age besides go to a bar? I am not really into the bar scene.       5. I have read that Arizona is a HUGE republican state. I am not saying that politics are hugely important to me, but people make it seem like people will be coming at me with Young Republican Society signs at every corner.        Any and all other information you could give me  would be helpful. I don't mean to sound like a Debbie Downer but it seems like the more I research about Arizona, the worse things people say about it. I need to know the facts from the fiction. Please someone help me!
