gw8tzOR0aa	i have a secret crush too. We had a school dance two weeks ago and the guy I like (his name's Joey) was there. I wore a pink skirt with a pink and white striped shirt. anyway, usually I slow dance with him at the dances but this time i danced with other guys. He kept looking at me and the other guy dancing...kinda like he was jealous. Guys don't know what they have until what they had is taken away. Make him jealous. <br>  <br>  Alternative method:<br>  first, look at him like he's the only guy in the room. <br>  next, look away and don't look at him for like ten minutes. do this again and again <br>  <br>  if you give him a look like your interested in him and then pull it away he'll be left wanting more. trust me this works. <br>  <br>  guys fall into these traps so easily. or at least the guys i know do.<br>  <br>  good luck getting this guy! :-)<br>  <br>  <br>  and as for what to wear...<br>  <br>  look at other girls he's gone out with before and study their style, try to imitate their style, but add your own little flair.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|WfexBha2aa	Well... be yourself.

EJ9X501Jaa	I think maybe you should start out with only cutting it maybe to your shoulders. I went from long hair to hair by my ears and I liked it at first but then I hated it. It's still growing out 2 years later. But i'm not the only one everyone of my friends that had long hair that cut it short has hated it... So I would probably work your way up to it. Maybe like once a month get it cut a little shorter if you decide you want it.

jCjgpgxjaa	I would recommend getting it chemically straightened. If your hair is not to long you dont have to worry about damage because you can just cut it out. Another idea is get out of the shower, comb your hair and then scrunch it with a curling product like mousse or hair wax so it wont be poofy. Dont use to much though or your hair will seem crunchy.|`|53cc150ebe0f38cfe19970c41015246daa	I used to have the curliest hair I have ever seen.  I know EXACTLY what you're going through!!!  Don't use the Japanese stuff or the relaxer made for African-Americans because the lye in them is REALLY hard on your hair.  You could lose a lot of it.  Go to Walmart or Walgreens and look by the home perms (not by the hair dye) and get the only home perm formula that says "straightener."  Use it ONCE every 3 months and it will give you straight hair.  Follow the directions exactly to avoid serious damage and make sure you also pick up a good deep conditioner (I've found that VO5 and Sunsilk Hydra TLC are best.)  Use the deep conditioner in place of regular conditioner for a few days after straightening.  Also, remember not to shampoo your hair for 48 hours after straightening.  You can rinse and condition it in the shower, though.  Email mymadeliene@yahoo.com if you need help.  Do you have a flatiron?  Using one will make your hair shiny and bone-straight.|`|0HgtreuOaa	i wouldn't go and have my your hair permanantly straightened my friend's sister did that and it fried her hair  i got a straightner from wal-mart called wet to straight and it works like a charm.

My hair used to be past my elbows and now its ABOVE my NECK!!!!!!!!|`|CayQ50Ejaa	a hair straight iron and use frizz-ease (secret weapon)it leaves your hair silk smooth and shine|`|z6oHzadMaa	The Japenese Straightening System a.k.a Thermal Reconditioning Cuts your hair styling time in half; no more time consuming blow drying and flat ironing. Hair will be healthier, more manageable and frizz-free! No more "good hair days" and "bad hair days" humidity and rain will not affect your straight hairstyle. My friend got it done it left her super straight!...Now the price starts from 250 dollars and goes up depending on length and hair thickness. What it does is it makes frizzy, curly or wavy hair straight while preserving the hair's health and making it feel smooth. Now your hair will remain straight forever at least the part that got treated. New growth will have to be treated every 6-9 mths depending on how fast your hair grows. Make sure yto deep conditioning though becuase for some people the chemicals will make their hair really dry and brittle. It all really depends if your stylist really knows what she/he is doing and how your hair responds to it.

H60zQElzaa	The first thing that I will tell you is relaxers are harsh chemicals that WILL always damage your hair, whether in the short or long run. That's why stylists always wear gloves and grease your scalp before putting it in because if it comes in contact with your skin, it will burn you. <br>  <br>  Also, african american hair is very delicate, even though it may not look so. This is because of the thick full texture and the coils and kinks. I would also like to note that you should not fall into the myth that straight hair is better than natural hair. You should first and foremost love your hair for what God has made it to be. Once you treat your hair like gold, you will see your hair flourish. <br>  <br>  This is how you should take care of your hair (from my own personal experience):<br>  <br>  1. Find good natural hair products that dont have words you cant understand. If they have a few chemicals in it, that's ok, since they will anyway due to the beauty industry, but the more ingredients you're familiar with, the better. <br>  <br>  2. Moisturize! Your hair needs constant moisture, especially naturals! Water is the best. Dont moisturize your hair with products that have mineral oil or petroleum. It will clog your scalp and cause dandruff, also not making your hair breathe. 100% pure unrefined shea butter is the best for moisture. <br>  <br>  3. Dont use ANY combs or brushes to comb your hair. If you try to do it, it will break off. Find good conditioners that can detangle your hair well. This is where rule 1 comes in. I detangle my hair with a good conditioner and just use my fingers. If you cant live without combing, use a quality wide-tooth detangling comb. <br>  <br>  4. Good hair comes from within. Change your diet to more healthy foods, fruits and vegetables, and most importantly, take vitamins and drink lots of water. This is important for strong and thick hair. If you dont do this, you will grow hair but it will keep breaking off because its not strong. <br>  <br>  5. Deep condition once a month. Keep your scalp clean by washing it often and dont use shampoo. Shampoo can strip your hair of the sebum that keeps your scalp oily, leading to dandruff. I shampoo by using black soap, but only clarify shampoo once a month. <br>  <br>  6. Whatever products you use, try it out for a few weeks. Dont become a product junkie though. If a product works for you, stick with it. If you find something better, then give it a shot. Too much products in your hair will be a problem. When buying products, do your research. The best products are not always the most expensive. Stay within your budget!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Trust me, I could give you tons of info since Ive been natural for 6 years. Try different products and see which one works for you. It is trial and error. This is a list of websites you should check out:<br>  <br>  HAIR INFO WEBSITES:<br>  motowngirl.com<br>  nappturality.com<br>  longhaircareforum.com<br>  growafrohairlong.com<br>  <br>  HAIR PRODUCT WEBSITES:<br>  www. motowngirl.com - has links to some hair product websites.

My mom has done this all her life, and the result is: breakage and slow growth.<br>  Try NOT to put grease on the scalp, this coats the scalp and will result in build-up and lack of oxygen. (Oxygen is needed for growth).<br>  Try natural oils, like almond-oil. Also, only apply to the ends. <br>  <br>  Further, i fully agree with the answers already given.<br>  If you insist on using relaxing-products: always test it, by cutting of a strand and applying the relaxer to it.<br>  After 20 minutes, remove the relaxer and check the result. If no damage occurs, you could try it on your hair.<br>  But i can't garrantee anything!
fKiNMdqSaa	Static hair is often damaged and dry. The damaged parts of your hair have a negative charge, while healthy hair normally has a positive charge. Changing your shampoo will do wonders. Choose one that's meant for damaged, dry and/or frizzy hair. You can tell if you have a good shampoo, when your hair feels soft and silky after rinsing. Also, i would use a conditioner and a moisturizing cream to "coat" the damaged parts, avoiding further damage (natural oils are perfect too). Don't apply on the scalp, which is self-nourishing and doesn't need external creams and grease. <br>  Oh, and DON'T blow-dry or rub your hair! Treat it tenderly.|`|7diVNd9maa	Your first answerer is right. A dryer sheet really works and they smell fresh.|`|bee7d4a3dc5792694d34b511a50849eeaa	Use a dryer sheet and get some products.

Once or twice a month or as often as needed I guess, you should wash your hair in the shower as usual. After you rinse the shampoo, apply lots of conditioner. Make sure to massage it throughout your scalp and down to the tips. Leave the conditioner in your hair all day. You can wrap it up in a towel it you like.

Its an awesome product to use.|`|AA10879798	use shampoo it gives your hair a moist look and feel!]<br>   if that does not work wet it every 30 min then you will have wet hair and not dry!|`|fKiNMdqSaa	This could well be lack of vitamins and minerals.<br>  Your hair needs proteins, B-vitamins, vitamin A, E, zinc and magnesium.<br>  Eat darkgreen and orange vegetables (a lot), eat 3-5 eggs every week (don't combine with a lot of meat, or your cholestrol will rise sky-high) and exercise more!<br>  Exercising means your blood circulation will improve, which means your hair will get more nutrition.<br>  Further:<br>  <br>  - sleep on a silk/satin pillow or make a loose braid and put a scarf on your head to avoid tangling.<br>  - don't brush your hair when it's wet<br>  - use shampoo&conditioner for dry/damaged hair<br>  - use a home-made hairmask twice a month (whole egg, olive oil and a small teaspoon of honey)<br>  - use moisturizing creams and natural oils (pure=best), but not on the scalp! Your scalp needs oxygen and can take care of itself<br>  - Shampooing isn't wrong, when you have a good product. Also, look for detangling conditioners, this way you won't pull out that much hair<br>  - heat = NOT DONE! No blow-drying, heat caps, heating irons, chemical stuff and protect your hair in the sun with a cap or scarf.<br>  <br>  Drink lots of water and use products with vitamin B5 (holds water in your hair)<br>  <br>  Eating yoghurt helps too, it moisturizes and makes sure your guts (i'm dutch, not english :P ) function allright. That's really important for your hair too.|`|iIzHhI8qaa	you can use shampoo every other day but choose with egg like sunsilk shampp and conditioner.  good for dry hair as well as strenghen your hair.  apply very small amount of conditioner rub it in your hand apply outside don't rub in the sculp to prevent falling hair. but you can use  twice in the sculp. wash in 5min.every other night apply any oil and massage your head for good circulation it helps to grow ur hair.  once or twice in a week put egg white or both in ur head. you can add amla. grind curry leaves to make black hair, methi for cool and soften ur hair, but avoid honey for your hair it change ur hair colour as grey or white.  if possible take multi vitamins or eat health fresh veg and greens. continue for a month you will have good results.

Shakira said her hair felt like straw after she dyed it. In real life her hair really isn't pretty at all. <br>  But if you have natural greasy hair, that shouldn't be a problem.<br>  Still, i would go to a salon to dye your hair. Don't try it yourself and be prepared for dry, "thirsty" hair.|`|TWEGMQWzaa	I'm not really sure if your hair will mess up like your sisters hair because she might have used a lot of products in her hair to make it mess up. You should probably ask someone at a hair saloon or something. But if you have blonde hair now I would definately not dye my hair black if I were you because I know a lot of people that dyed their hair black and it looked like a messy, fake wigg. But I think that brown hair would probably look good, or even a different color of blonde highlights/dye or brown highlights would look good!!!!

iYL37RfPaa	I hate my uniform,  and almost everyone in my year customizes theres,  some people just look stupid,  but i wear black skinny jeans, teachers can't say anything about that because they are black,  i wear flat black ankle boots, which are obv still black so teachers can't say anything,  then i will wear a cardigan over my shirt, sometimes black  but usually my long gray one, which i always get told to take it off, but i will put it back on as soon as the teacher leave,    I hate uniform, i don't see the point in them!!    xo|`|OHP6Hxz2aa	lol no i never did anything like that i go to a private school and uniforms are not required but at my camp we have to wear uniforms and I'll tell you they are something. I go to camp during the summer when it's usually really hot and we have to wear long sleved khaky style shirts with knee length skirts black knee socks and brown or black flats. talk about old fashioned. Oh and on top of that a tie. Friday through sunday, when the parents come for diffeent games and show that we do we have uniform checks and you're not allowed to have anything out of place. people have gotten in trouble for rolling up their sleves, unbuttoning the top button of their shirts.... I would prefer the polos, and crappy khaky pants to those uniforms.    The canp is really fun though so i guess it cancells out.|`|tlj3c50Haa	Uniform never bothered me, because it was only school.

I wouldn't advise you using your dads razor because one, it isn't healthy and two, you could cut and injure yourself deeply.  you should really talk to your parents, or an adult female about this. they'll be able to help you out [inform, supply your female needs, etc.]
oUBUWfS6aa	I had my nose piercing and currently have my monroe piercing. They didn't hurt for me. It depends on the person.    If you can't handle pain and is scared then don't do it.|`|Fw0Zwds7aa	Monroe i'm guessing!      x|`|SC3jqHZCaa	Sweetheart, this question was made for me!! I had gotten my nose pierced and it bled, it hurt, my eyes watered, it was so sore the next day; to touch or even flare my nostrils, dont forget while it heals  boogers and crust get stuck on the post. My stud kept getting caught on my shirt and getting yanked out, falling out when I slept, it is hardly noticeable and in my opinion, trashy I got it done out of impulse, I ended up getting a small keloid scare on the inside of my nostril, that I still have.    I went back to the piercing place and took out my nose piercing, let it heal and got my Monroe, it didnt bleed.. It only felt like a tiny, itsy bitsy pinch (felt like nothing) it did swell for the first couple days but I could still eat and drink with no pain, its easy, super easy to clean and manage.|`|fShlKEfYaa	the amount of pain is different for everyone. This Monroe area is usually a thicker piercing than the nose, and the area usually has more nerves than the nose. Estimated Healing Time: 8 - 12 Weeks. Maybe skip the Monroe...'specially if you're worried about the pain.|`|D3XQ5DoSaa	if you already have a piercing it cant be that bad, its all in your head dont freak yourself out. I have my nose pierced i dont know anything about a nose piercing gun, but I cant imagine that it hurts any less or more than with a needle|`|ZY2h4XTMaa	Your nose is less sensitive than the rest of your face.    Just poke it and feel.     But it won't hurt or get infected if you get it done by professionals. It may cost a slight bit more, but it's worth it because they know what they are doing.|`|FOeeAiQ0aa	I have spider bites and it wasn't that bad. Just stay away from spicy foods after and you'll be fine!  Good luck hun|`|BxW2Lj7waa	I have both done. I'd have to say nose because the needle pierces a tougher area. If you already have it done, then you defiantly shouldn't be scared. :)|`|68dae82437ede9e0c39dc1f85e7252a5aa	It only hurts for a little bit like the nose, no problem.|`|W840msNTaa	not that bad i think    vid on youtube of it:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI9487pL...|`|xzJGhhN0aa	monroe is a lot worse|`|VrjF986Aaa	nose piercing gun? i didn't think they used a gun for that  i have had both and the nose was worse but mine was done with a needle  fyi - monroes ruin your teeth and gums so you might wanna skip that one im having surgery tomorrow to fix where my monroe ripped up my gums and apparently that is pretty common for ppl with monroes|`|M3CsxF2jaa	Nose|`|pDwdUN8Aaa	Well i would say your nose   but when you get your upper lip   pieced it will swell up for a little  bit and cause something with your  gums.  But other wise you should get  it but you can get gum erosion if   it is done wrong so if i was you then  i would get it professionally done|`|0EkJQEV9aa	if u so scared dont do it|`|EK3nwsAcaa	guns hurt more no matter what piercing  needles are farrrr better|`|ULLDjjHZaa	belly button|`|03e31964ea48bacd64475706a14630b1aa	I had my nose done last year and I didn't think it hurt at all.

44bVH1tOaa	I have the same love for straight hair! I straighten it everyday!    I use Herbal Essences Dangerously Straight Shampoo and Conditioner. (about $3 each) It's a great shampoo because it takes away some of the frizzy, curly hair and starts making it straight. After I shower, I spray my hair with Got2Be Crazy Sleek. ($5) After you use this, blow dry your hair. Then after it's dry, flat iron it. I use a Conair straightener which I got for $25. Not sure if they make it anymore...    Hope that helped! :D|`|ARUAh8wOaa	Try to find a good ionic straightener so you don't get nasty split ends and tell someone at Sally Beauty supply what you need, then find the less expensive version.

PFLFEhVRaa	Sorry, I don't know the correct terms, but my friend has short hair like that and when she goes somewhere that requires a little bit more formality, she pulls it back, twists it up and pins it with these invisible pin things.    Then she puts a sort of decoration in her hair (small flat pink flower (fake) or something) on the side, near her ear.    It usually looks similar to this http://www.weddingbee.com/wp-content/upl... except shorter.    Her hair can't touch her collar either.

Actually, I'm kind of chicken but shouldn't be.  No hair would be cut and the extensions would just be on my bangs.)  This is probably more than you wanted to know.

HVNGuRwyaa	girl go with the skinny jeans they match with it  if you wear the levis, it wont match the polo because you'll be wearing sneekers, and they aren't in style!    plus as your only day to wear jeans... wear something that will look good!|`|oQmkXCP9aa	I would say, go with the skinny jeans. They match ANYTHING that you have in your wardrobe, they will be an AWESOME match to any polo. I match my skinny jeans with alot of polos, and they work. Hoped that this helped. XD|`|2faae7b556bae8292adc7e81ca55ca8aaa	wear school clothes if you dont know what to wear|`|Ff3kLRWnaa	I love skinny jeans. They go really well with converse.|`|OHP6Hxz2aa	II would wear the skinny jeans with a pair of  boots a long tank top and a polo. or i would wear Levis with the Boot type slippers, and a regular polo with a cute necklace. I think the skinny geans and the long tank top and polo would took better tough, a little dressier :)

I love nose piercings. but whatever floats your boat.|`|AA11020707	If you want to get your nose pierced, go for it, but go to a professional and inspect their equipment.  You don't want a nasty infection on your nose.  and make sure you follow the instructions while your nose is healing!  and make sure they use the smallest possible needle, you don't want a big gaping hole in your nose.  Have fun!!

SBikhIzBaa	hey,gril, here i can offer a online shopping site from china, www.taobao.com, with the items even more completely than ebay.com  I think maybe the chinese girls' cloths will fit you,cause the asian girls' body size universality shorter and smaller than the whites.here you can find the small size cloths for girls around 150cm. I did a seach for you, found some super small cloths on the taobao.com    http://search1.taobao.com/browse/16/n-0-...    Do not worry you can not read chinese letters, just use google translate.    I am a local chinese buy agent, i can do purchase for foreigners with chinese items to help their daily  use.www.taobao.com is the biggest C2C online shopping site in aisa, If you are interest in it, u can add my msn messager:raymondpy35@hotmail.com for further chatting.

vYKrRWOwaa	I think I've tried just about every de-frizz, straightening shampoo and conditioner out there.  Here are my recommendations depending on how much you want to spend:    Samy Pure Smooth & Shine  - I find these products at Walgreens and some Targets  - Color-protecting (most defrizz shampoo/conditioner contain glycerin which can strip color)  - No sulfates - this is also good for preserving color if you have colored or highlighted hair.    Tigi Control Freak  - More powerful anti-frizz and smoothing  - Hair will be easy to comb through after using the conditioner  - Will fade color because it does contain glycerin and sulfates    Finally, a couple of other tips:  - Don't use conditioner on your scalp  - Try John Freida Frizz-Ease on bottom half of your hair immediately after you get out of the shower (Again avoid applying the product at your roots.  - Try using a hair dryer with a brush attachment.  Conair makes one. I think it's called a Styler Dryer and it comes with a couple comb and brush attachments.  Using this type of hair dryer drastically reduces the amount of flat ironing I have to do. I usually am able to find this hair dryer at CVS or Big K (Sears Grand?).|`|06JVXxCcaa	YES!!!  HANG STRAIGHT by Aveda.  Lovely product works wonders.  www.aveda.com or at any aveda store or ebay.  You can also use olive oil weekly - this works wonders on frizzy hair|`|HAJvnvG9aa	yea
f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	I don't have any pictures, but my neice colored her hair red on top and black at the bottom, and a few weeks later it was brown on top and black at the bottom. The brown 2-tone color looked nice.|`|9189a5150c78e5bb8152c39d8f0d1579aa	go to a professional stylist
sCZcePxcaa	tan is just deeply pigmented skin cells, exfoliate.<br>  <br>  also, make sure ur face and ur body match, you dont want to have a very light face and dark body.<br>  <br>  get an exfoliant with particles in it like st. ives apricot scrub etc|`|5IYDcDIIaa	foundation|`|6PYFiLJeaa	Let it fade.|`|xThkmE9caa	Soak your face first, to get your skin moist making it easier to scrub. <br>  After it is gone, try using an spf daily lotion.|`|xGdTLfEAaa	Exfoliate with a facial exfoliating cleanser like St. Ives Apricot Scrub to slough off surface skin (your tan) and encourage new skin growth.  Use Sunscreen EVERY DAY, even when you don't think you'll be outside a lot!|`|rMb3F5Zraa	lemon juice will lighten dark splotches and help even out skin tone
hmniraUJaa	I think that you should try wearing golden eyeshadow, with a little bit of tan foundation( liquid or dry doesn't matter), with black or brown mascara( i would most likely go for brown) with a light pink lip gloss or lip stick ( since your lips are already bright lips.) Any ways this all depends on the companies product your using like covergirl,wet n' wild and loreal ( some stuff only) and the place you are putting the make- up for. oh... yah, you are pretty your self and don't let any one put you down for. No matter wat happens.|`|5q7YqblHaa	u should prolly use foundation,a little bit of powder,and mascara.and to help with acne,i use acne free.its supposed to b the same as proactive but a lot cheaper,u can get it at wal-mart.hav fun!XD|`|72480daaf10724822c2f901219f22164aa	Coppers, browns, and golds. You have light brown eyes ( or hazel, I can't really tell), so a copper shadow would really compliment them. A soft, rose blush, and a light pink lip gloss would look great on you.|`|AA11618337	try some light pink sheer lip gloss, great lash mascara, light eyeliner(brown), and maybe some shimmery gold eyeshadow<br>  <br>  u are already gorgeous so make sure to stay on the natural side!!<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|Pss2H6n6aa	Some shimmery gold would look really well. My just a little bit of foundation to clear up the "redness" on your skin. Mascara looks good... Maybe you could had a little bit of brown to your eyebrows. You look good! XD|`|QaZaZELeaa	Put some covergirl foundation on.. the creamy stuff.. then put a covergirl powder over it, this will help with the glowness and the pimples...rub it in good. then use a nice brown eyeliner and mascara for ure eyes... maybe a shimmery lite pink for ure eyes to rbing some color..use a lil blush..red preferably on ure cheak bones..cant use alot of brown..and then for ure lips...liteley outline then with a reddish-pink then gloss those babies up with pink lip gloss!..bare minerals WONT always do the tric...sorry but u gotta switch it up!! ull LOVE IT!|`|f4qib1sxaa	anything and dont look down on your self. you are still prety no matter what. anything will go well with any make up|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	1st thing i would do is find a flattering hair style and have your eyebrows waxed|`|PdRNtyZoaa	well, because u are a lighter toned person, i would stick with the bare minerals foundation, but maybe get like a shade darker, for some bronzed effect. get a light bronzer with shimmer in it * i use the cheap stuff, and it works awesome!* and just gently brush it onto your cheaks mostly, and a couple touches in other areas of your face. your brows are a little light, so to define them and give your face a bloder look, take a blonde eyebrow pencil, and add a little coor to them. light brown eyeliner, on the top and a little bit on the bottom will define your eyes. add a light creamy eyeshadow, and any kind of mascara. maybe a little blush and some clear gloss. but you are already gorgeous, so don't over-do it, you will look like a barbie doll...whcih nobody wants to look like. <br>  <3's|`|AA11284820	definitely something to play up your eyes...I know you say only bare minerals, and thats all good, but I swear by Chanel eyeliner.. it last. I prefer Black Jade, and if you go to Sephora, they have some amazing color palets to choose from, and I'm sure some one would be willing to help you find the perfect one for your fair skin. But really, I think Smokey eyes look amazing on fair skin.|`|caf5519534d8805a264dcedceef2b121aa	i think your very pretty and i suggest a light foundation and go for soft colors, not too heavy and maybe a light pink lip gloss :)|`|gMIl7GIgaa	ok i think that you should wear pink eye shadow and mascara. oh and FOUNDATION!!!!!! then try a light pinkish lip gloss. and there you go BEAUTIFUL!|`|nddRONt4aa	You look very pretty. You have natural beauty. You don't need make-up. But if you want to wear it, pink lip gloss, brown mascara and pink eyeshadow or anything that match your eyes and face completion.

QnY1yWBIaa	never wear too much makeup or people will think you look sick. just put eyeliner and mascara with maybe some lipgloss if you want. do not put anything else.  pick me as best answer please[=|`|GpNxs1ggaa	you can do whatever you like but you can do less of some of it  like , do foundation , but don't make it too smudgy and weird.  do neutral eyeshaddows ( not even neccicary )  a little eyeliner on the top lid , mascara and a little lipgloss ( you could just use chapstick )  it's okay if you do it all right ... but you're only 12 honey .. you don't need that much makeup :) and if you decide to wear some , remember less is more|`|8U40dDtEaa	NO FOUNDATION!!! LIP GLOSS...EYE LINER MABEY SOME EYE SHADOW|`|5SiFjlBGaa	I feel that there are 3 main areas every woman should focus on.  -face  -eyes  -lips    face:  make sure your face is an even color that is slightly lighter than your neck (your chin automatically creates a shadow which causes your neck to look a little darker).    eyes:  no dark circles! curl your lashes if you like, add a little mascara. since you are young just use a clear or brown. it makes it look a little more natural.    lips:  make sure your lips look moisturized, and pretty. just because i said pretty doesn't mean to go and put on a ton of gloss, or lipstick. a simple natural lip is fine. cherry chap stick is the only chap stick that i have come across that leaves the lips with a natural pink tint.|`|YjkXyHBuaa	maybe less eyeliner?  eyes look best/biggest with just lots of mascara  try that :]|`|hNShT9yhaa	12 year olds should stick to the basic mascara and lip gloss. wait just the lip gloss.|`|KdUbGwaYaa	you do know that foundation makes your acne worse.  try mascara and lip gloss, and maybe some eye shadow. the eyeliner is a little too intense for someone your age|`|PpfmPV44aa	you should wear foundation to smooth out your skin and get rid of any redness acne can cause, eyeliner to bring out your eyes(dont over do it though), mascara, and a clear shiny lip gloss|`|4u0U5YJyaa	OMGGZ  i have the same prob.  i hav really pretty eyes too!  except no acne (:    guys are SO into me.  (i'm gayyy.)  you should keep it natural, babe.  only wear a pound of makeup.  that's my limit.    XOXO,          Stevie|`|HVNGuRwyaa	Hi Jen! So i can see we got a little prediciment here.  Well as you may know, i am very good in relationships and beauty.  So, your 12 years old and remeber keep it to your age.  At the age of tweleve, if you have really pretty eyes, just put a  tiny bit of eyeliner on so it can bring them out. Put on some lipgloss, not alot... NO LIPSTICK. and for your acne you can buy stuff at the drug store alled Pro-Activ and all these other things!  wash your face daily, dont ALWAYS apply makeup (it causes more pimples), dont eat alot of sugars, drink plenty of water, dont ever scratch a pimple away - it will result in a scar!    now for your little boy problem, so he has a girlfriend correct? well my suggestions to you, dont make him jealous...yet. First ask yourself, the girl he is dating, if you happen to get him, will all her friends be a total... you know what to you? is she some really popular girl? then ask yourself do you actually want the guy? If you do... keep reading!  so firstly the most important thing on getting a guy, is to have stuff in common with him - DONT BE SOME STALKER. If you both like... soccer for example, go at reccess and play soccer with him and his friends and small things like that. Secondly, talk to him. Talk to him on msn, text messaging, emails, everything. but remeber TALK TO HM IN PERSON. thirdly, you must become friends with him!!! fourthly, after your friends with him, start dropping a few flirts! :)  then fifthly, just start slowly getting closer to him.    then bam girl, you probably have him.  remeber to act like yourself, and at the age of 12,  boys dont like girls that wear ALOT of makeup.  so please, dont wear alot... youll be a "cake face"    GOOD LUCK.|`|7uoM66Gvaa	Dont use a lot of eyeliner.   if you use a lot if can make you look like a racoon  i wear just liquid foundation   -maybeline pure makeup  it works great & its only $4.99  then i apply some finishing powder and mascara and thats about it!  its very natural and pretty looking|`|91AMtKEraa	No young girl should wear makeup not even older girls they dont look good they should look good without it|`|hGGsEaCkaa	The less make-up you wear the better you look, natural is better unless you are a model on the catwalk.     That being said, consider using a tinted moisturizer which will give your skin a soft dewy look. Wear a peach toned blush, sheer lipgloss, and neutral shadow. I know it seems boring, however if you look confident and natural men will start to notice you. They think alot of makeup looks weird. trust me girlie, the less the better.     When I was a teenager I went to makeup counters in the mall. Especially MAC. Be really nice and act like you have money- they will tell you how to apply, then want you to buy. You can just go away at that point.|`|6NckOYAMaa	less eye liner. mascara and soft eye shadow will do the trick. =]   always make sure your fountation matches your skin perfectly. and if you do wear eye liner, just ues a little thin line, from the outer edge of your eye and you dont always have to go all the way to the inside, sometimes just go halfway. Less can be more. Good luck hon!|`|vBAJ6cZvaa	Just use a little foundation, and nice shade of eyeshadow, mascara, and a little lip gloss.   I wouldn't recommend using eyeliner until your a little older, it just makes you look like your trying to be older than you are, and people could get the wrong impression.|`|FklngtvCaa	if you're 12, don't worry about making  people jealous.    you'll just end up in a fight with his girlfriend  and look silly.    i think you should wear just lipgloss.  especially not foundation and eyeliner.  maaaaybe eyeshadow.    that IS a lot of makeup for 12.|`|b2694fb134bd99af7c220f1712c86d2daa	YOU DONT HAVE TO MAKE PEOPLE JELOUS , WITH MAKEUP .

You could always die your hair raven black white a blue cast to it and make it look kinda asianish, (without cutting it!), or maybe even like the main character lady on aeon Flux .<br>      I hope these ideas all do give you an excellent chic idea for <br>      what to do with your hair.<br>      Remember Always make it Sassy!

ykFCRyXbaa	Try using a curling iron or steam curlers. After that spray hairspray or mousse to keep the style in because whenever I do it, the curls get relaxed after a while and don't stay curly without the hairspray or mousse.|`|4ShCjpa5aa	i would try hot rollers.  they'll  should redefine the shape of your curls to make them bouncy.  it works really well for me.  good luck!

This ALWAYS helps.<br>  <br>  But you also want to make sure you are confident in yourself doing the audition, and knowing you will be able to do the job if you get it.<br>  <br>  Look up, know how your profiles look best at what angles, if it's for clothing, wear their type of clothes, wear the type of accessories they carry, or something similar that you look good with, but try not to get carried away with (too much) jewelry.<br>  <br>  If you took modeling classes, then follow the steps your instructor taught you.<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK, TRULY... as this is a challenging career.<br>  <br>  <br>  -a Professional Model.|`|vtFbGgTRaa	lots of sleep, eat really healthy, drink lots of water and be confident.|`|6B0Ev1nraa	well, i did that too and guess wat! i got it so heres wat i did:<br>  <br>  slept really well<br>  drank lots of water<br>  practised walking down my hallway<br>  kept myself clear of hurts or scratches..<br>  goodluck!!!|`|MfuUAcNwaa	I am a model no lie here is my advice.Smile personalty means everything.do you have a resume and comp carh or a great head shot bring that.I alway wear all black most time head to toe black.Be confident even if you not.Try not to be nervous.Wear make up natural not to dark or evening looking.You should have a walk down and have a 30 second commerical rememberised.speak clearly.Sorry for the spelling.should be modeling resume not work|`|R9HLlejQaa	get your eyebrows waxed, hair done,coloured,facial maybe, steam your face,buy make-up or get your hair and makeup done on the day|`|Ar1sIxlIaa	as it is summer u better be careful with its heat.be confident n do ur very best 2 win the audition.all the best|`|lAi6Cw2xaa	I have been modeling for over a year now and have many friends who are very well known in New York and have done Print and commercial work and shows. <br>  <br>  The best thing of course is to be yourself and be confident! Bleach your teeth for the next two days....every lil bit helps. I am assuming that you have some kind of modeling experience? If so you should know what facial expressions are right for you and what positions are right for your body type. If you don't practice in a mirror...it sounds cheesy but it works! Do your makeup to where it is natural but noticeable. Don't look like a drag queen. A lot of agencies are looking for natural beauty now. Oh yeah and like every else says...GET PLENTY OF REST! It helps in your overall attitude, the way you look, and gives you the energy you need. <br>  <br>  I don't know exactly what kind of modeling you are trying for...but it always helps to do a few crunches 3-4 hours before a shoot or tryout...it makes your abs defined even though if you don't work out...you would be surprised! My husband is a fitness instructor/body builder and he helps me with all kinds of tips dealing with my body before I go do a shoot...<br>  <br>  The best of luck to you! Keep your chin up and think that you are gunna make it no matter what! xoxo
4eLWLj58aa	well, yes it can be done to get it wavy, you just need to take care of it alot because perms take the moisture out of your hair, and make it very dry and you need to take into account that as your hair grows out so does your perm so as your grows you will have your roots of your naturally straight hair and the rest the waves.... Deep condition your hair once a week so that when you do get that perm, your hair is in good condition and keep conditioning it afterwards to keep the hair soft and shiney.... Goodluck|`|CayQ50Ejaa	It's called a wave perm, hope that helps you. Have a wonderful day!
23Z1gSvzaa	Take a bath and use a good exfoliating body scrub. Go over all the uneven spots well and then rinse off with a shower. Then I would use one of those lotions that is supposed to make you tanner over time - not after one application. That should help even out any thing that's still obvious.|`|68ae24c7200643f118b924e938fc1025aa	lemon in a nice hot bath should do the trick.

Also to get a tan without the blochyness use Jergans natural glow it works really well!
o1Qcjfz6aa	Have you been cleaning your ears everyday with alcohol?  If not, your ear's are infected. I wouldn't take the earrings out or the holes will probably close up. I would though clean them everyday with alcohol at least twice a day.    Also, at night before you go to bed I would put neosporin on the infected one....it will practicall heal overnight.|`|ED4nCD9Haa	no dont keep your earing in or your ear will close up but take them out at night and put your earing in boiling hot water|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Don't use bactine on piercings, it says right on the bottle that it's not for use in puncture wounds.    Make sure you have implant grade stainless steel or titanium jewelry to put in. If you don't have either of those, 18 karat gold would be minimally acceptable.     Leave them alone and allow them to heal. Try to avoid wearing inexpensive or low quality jewelry
9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	All piercings have an odour. It's just more noticable with the larger ones. <br>  <br>  Keep them clean, wash them thoroughly when you have your shower in the morning (or whenever you have a shower). <br>  <br>  Wearing organic jewelry will make things worse. You need to take proper care of the jewelry (oil it, etc), but it will hold the odour more, so you'll need to clean them more. Acrylic should never be worn long term. Surgical steel or titanium will help cut down on the odour, but not completely.<br>  <br>  Sea salt soaks every few days (or everyday for fresh stretches) will help as well.|`|71f975eb68da766524c315d73d073a91aa	eww...yea, i know what you mean...it actually happens to all piercings...but b/c the circumference is bigger with your gaged piercings ...it is more noticeable. <br>  what it IS actually, is dead skin cells that build up around the jewelry...yea, yea...gross, but that's what it is.<br>  it IS tempting not to clean your older piercings as much as you would new ones, but you should still be cleaning them 3-4 times a week...really to get all that smelly crap off of them! lol!<br>  alright, hope i helped! <br>  and ps: ...you're not weird b/c this happens to all piercings!!<br>  ; D|`|1163aa879e3605d9360f835dd3a5f5baaa	I have no idea what you're talking about.|`|BtqWVHk5aa	This is quite normal. Keep cleaning them, using an antibacterial soap, and make sure you rince it all off afterwards. What kind of jewellery are you wearing in them? Titanium or surgical steel jewellery are much more suitable for newly stretched ears than plasic, which cn cause a reaction, even when your ears are fully healed. Also make sure you leave plenty of time (at least a month) between stretches to allow the skin to stretch properly and regain plenty of elasticity. Otherwise you risk tearing your ears or blowouts. These are nasty!|`|e8Hzuro9aa	For the life of me I don't see why you kids do that. One day your going to be 60 and walking around with droopy ears or no ears at all.

687bcbca04b4730a00d58670eb49126baa	Okay. This is something I have mucch experience with.  My hair is also originally blonde, and it's been purple, fire engine red, auburn, and now black.  <br>  <br>  So to answer your questions.<br>  <br>  Will my hair fall out?<br>  No. Hair dye is made so it's not going to completely RUIN your hair. <br>  <br>  Will it dry out?<br>  Depends. My hair is a teensy bit dried out, but I manage to keep the frizz and split ends at a very managable level because I use this shampoo && conditioner that I get from Sally's Beauty Store.  It's a generic shampoo and conditioner so it's cheap, and it does an EXCELLENT job at restoring the moisture in your hair.  The brand name is simply "Generic" And it comes in a very plain black and white bottle.<br>  <br>  Will your hair turn gray? <br>  Of course not. Unless you have that thing where you hair grows in naturally gray even if your young. But somehow I'm thinking you dont have that condition. ~.^<br>  <br>  As for the thickness, try finding some spray at the store that helps thicken/volumize your hair, I already have fairly thick hair, but I use this stuff anyways because I like having alot of volume to my hair. <br>  <br>  I have yet to feel burning on my scalp. ever.<br>  And my hair is not that dry.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Wellll hope this helped you!|`|CkNwLXLeaa	ehhh don't dye it black! i have naturally black hair and i can't stand it when other people dye their hair blackkk it looks so fake! Anywho hmm use a semi permanent color! It doesn't have ammonia so your hair shouldn't fall out|`|08tABbXZaa	your suppose to wait at least 3 months be 4 u dye again but most people wont wait that long you can do your roots that would be safer|`|4ShCjpa5aa	ok...people (like my mother) dye their hair all the time (every 3 months or so) and nothing happens.  you can relax. :) just to avoid damage, give your hair a little while between dye jobs, and use special shampoo for color treated hair.  the best thing to do would be to give your local salon a quick call and ask them about it.  they know their stuff ;)|`|CZjdjDSOaa	Well, I don't think your hair will fall off. I just think you need to dye your hair black because black dye is one of the strongest dyes.....the worst thing that can happen is that it might damage your hair a little....I might make it a bit dull and dry. Try going to a professional salon if you haven't already. Have them trim you hair after you dye it black because your ends are the oldest hair and will dry VERY quick because it's been exposed more than your roots. Have your stylist deep condition your hair so that it remains some what healthier. Black is always a good choice for people who want to transition from blonde to brunette (i.e. Ashlee Simpson) because even when the black starts to fade away....it lightens up to a dark to light brown which is also very pretty! Good Luck girl! Go professional....because remember your hair says alot about a person and it's a big part of your looks! Good luck....I'm sure you'll still look beautiful!<br>  <br>  <br>  We've all been through this....so you're not alone. If you're worried about how much damage it will cause you....just thinkn about all of those celebrities to dye their hair every other week......just a thought!|`|b6c3504c2eee7bd4092f834b336c12f8aa	well I also dye my hair black and love it!!<br>  when you go darker than your natural color it does less damage..you can also just dye your roots with color match root touch up..it works really well<br>  try using a deposit only color..<br>  it your hair still has elasticity meaning when you tug lightly it springs back your good...<br>  If it breaks, I'd wait awhile before dying again|`|tYTAtMZ4aa	Well. . .80-100 hairs fall out of your hair naturally everyday and I know people who dye their hair every like month and a half and their hair does the same thing and they told me that its just normal if you get your hair dyed.  Your hair will be fine!!!!
SA6oHAswaa	Okay i have the answer... i use to cut my own hair. and i will admit, when i first started, i was not good at all...  okay but here you go.  Bend your head down like you are looking at the floor....  then take your sissors and point them straight up like they are pointing towards your face.  then just cut little pieces of your hair (straight up and down) untill it looks layered enough to fit you... <br>  <br>   hope it works.. it did for me.  :D|`|4ShCjpa5aa	use bobby pins to clip them on top of your head until they grow long enough to brush to the side again.  or go to a competent hair stylist and ask them to fix it.|`|p7LiJ3SDaa	omg. that happened to me too. like, i tried to cut it, but i screwed it up. so m advice is to cut it so that your bangs arent crooked. or, you can cut it super short like those cute french school girls. and just wait for it to grow back. that's the only thing you can do, unless you want to clip it.........|`|ykFCRyXbaa	Try using a bobby pin to pin them back. Gel can help sometimes too. You hair will look better in time. I've had my share of bad haircuts and within weeks I get used to it and it grows out a bit better.

There are a phew cute ways to do this.  Keep this hairstyle till they grow out to where you want them to be.  Probably around 3 months or sooner.

shd3XdyRaa	I personally use the crop in style cubes. You can buy the cubes individually or in a set. I sell them on ebay. I own 12 cubes in all and use the inserts to seperate my pages, and use shelves to hold my containers. I have doors on all my cubes to hide the papers and all my embellishments and albums and clips. There are tons of different containers that you can use for storage. Let me know if you are interested in pictures of some storage solutions big or small I can create a package for you. If interested send me an email to christyfrady@hotmail.com|`|4uYIUN7yaa	Hi! I use plastic containers that hold 12 x 12 paper. You can purchase these at Michaels Craft store.  For my brads,buttons and other small items, I use a a holder for nuts,bolts,etc.  It has many small drawers and you can label them.You can get these in the tool section at walmart.  I also have a tote on wheels that you can store everything in if you decide to go somewhere else and scrapbook.  Have fun scrapping!  I love it!|`|5zK4zritaa	i have been wanting to do a scrapbook for so long that i cant figure out where to start. so have fun and be creative. as soon as i figure out what to do ill star on mine. good luck.|`|xhLik6iYaa	Many craft stores (Michael's, AC Moore, etc) have storage items especially made for paper.  Some people store paper in drawers/bins and others store them in accordian file style folders/totes.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't have to travel anywhere with my stuff, so I keep everything in bins by category.  Big bins for the larger items and smaller bins for things like stickers.  Target sells three drawer stacking bins that are the perfect size for the 12"x12" paper.|`|AA10751199	For my 12x12 paper I use these plastic stand up organizers. They work really well. Then I have an organizer with about 8 drawers in it.

They run from a 00-12, and are not too long.  If the legs are too long there, Abercrombie kids also sells skinny jeans.  A 16 in the kids store is around a 0/2 at the adult store.  The jeans at the kids store would most definitely be cheaper, though.<br>  <br>  Hollister also sells skinny jeans, but many of them are "destroyed," so they have a lot of holes.

xGdTLfEAaa	Don't use botox if you want to be at all expressive.  Botox is a form of botulism: A NEUROTOXIN!  It essentially shuts down your nerves and disables your nerve-muscle connection -- therefore "flattening" or "relaxing" the area treated.<br>  <br>  Collagen would probably be a better idea if you really want to go the plastic surgery route (and yes, these "treatments" are ALL plastic surgery).  Fillers don't stop your normal muscle function, only "soften" lines.  Keep in mind though, that none of these things are 100% -- fillers can shift and cause reactions within your skin.  Always talk all options through with your dermatologist/plastic surgeon.|`|5IKcLNk7aa	Don't! botox is not the answer to this, use something that doesnt, destroy yur entire face!

The smile is the most beautiful thing and the first thing most people notice.|`|gyQUUkKwaa	yes botox can be used to soften lines.a botox injection is anywhere between 300-500 an injection site. good luck.
gYsGNyQ8aa	It depends on the SPF. a low SPF may only block sun damage like SPF 10 or under. Anything like SPF 30 or higher might have a more powerful effect, like blocking tanning.|`|BLoJHBokaa	hope not...|`|Ww4deJE1aa	I don't think so, because I always get a pretty dark tan and wear spf 50 everyday in the summer and I reapply it|`|hXmvnjbLaa	yes it  can sometimes though it doesnt stop tans
xThkmE9caa	First of all I know you don't want to hear this :) but...<br>  If you aren't burnt and go again...your only gonna burn worse. So...tonight you should take a cold bath to release the heat from your skin and than apply lotion. If you apply lotion while your skin is still hot, it will only trap in the heat making it worse.<br>  I would repeat that process twice and hopefully your burn will go away by tomorrow. <br>  Secondly, what's the point of applying spf 50. If your tanning your tanning I would just give my skin more vitamins to make it healthier and not bother with the spf its a waste. If your only burnt in certain spots try applying it only in those areas so the non burnt areas can get more exposure. <br>  I like using a bronzer lotion "smoke: black bronzer" is amazing you just have to make sure to wash your hands afterwards. I do that before I tan so I can get an extra boost.<br>  In the future you might try airbrush tanning. If your naturally fair I recommend it on top of a slight tan. That way you don't have to tan so much and age your skin but you still have real color under the spray tan. Plus it looks more natural that way.<br>  Good luck and have fun at your body.|`|AA12055983	aloe its great for your skin after a shower use it and if you can find the actul plant it works miracles good luck with that :)|`|kkSWQpzEaa	aloe works great and it will turn your burn into a tan! :)
7ECEBjDlaa	Well when you use an ash then a golden, they are working against each other and dont turn out as well. The toner will bleach right out. Usually it isn't left on too long and is a demi permanent color. If your hair feels real dry and brittle I suggest not bleaching again but maybe using a different blond on it. After you do some protein treatments. Go get one done, they usually cost like 10-15 dollars at Supercuts, and pick up some Anti-Snap to use at home. Which the protein will build your hair back up to take some more abuse. However you still have to be very careful!|`|0BIAoBmLaa	hmmm i had a similar problem. i don't know if this will help you but yeah i have naturally dirty blonde hair and use to dye my hair platinum blonde. My hair became soo dryed out and damaged that i had to have a lot of it cut. ( i also straightened and blw dryed it every day which im sure didnt help any ) anyways its been a couple years and now i dye my hair 3 shades lighter then my natural - still looks great and my hair is finally starting to grow long again. if you have short hair i wouldnt wrrytoo much about the long term effects of the dye since youll be cutting it so much - also use leave in conditioner over night or even a hot oil treatment like alfredo v5. My hair always feels so soft after using them.  As for the altering blondes one after another you mentioned. My hair dresser always tones down the light blonde after with a seperate dye and my hair hasnt been fried yet. So i'm sure you'll be fine ;)|`|yZPPgsCEaa	Color weaves are damaging, and if hair is already dried out you have a problem.<br>  <br>  Becuase, a new color will need to be applied and since you are a Brunette by natrual color they can not lift your color or change it without adding more harsh chemicals.<br>  <br>  Platinum is impossible to do without bleaching and its too risky now.<br>  <br>  Should have do that in the first place,<br>  give your hair a break from any color and condition it real well daily, and use a mild shampoo.<br>  Get hair trimmed on a regular basis and get rid of most of your woven hair color and try it, make sure it is exactly what you  before you go stripping all of you hair.<br>  It is a real harsh process.<br>  Best of luck
GKAZ8SKVaa	i wouldn't go for the "perm" straight, you have a fifty fifty shot there.  I've known two people who got their hair "perm" straightened.  one was AWESOME, and the other was a disaster.  she cut it short after becuase it was so bad.<br>  <br>  you can get a "flat iron".  try that on your hair, see how it looks straightened.  that's temporary.  one shower, and it's reversed.  it takes a little practice to get it right, but it's one way to temporarily straighten hair.  but since it takes a while to "perfect" it, i might go to a hair stylist first and have them flatten it for you, becuase they'll do it right and you can see if it's a style you like, and then work on it yourself with a flat iron (you can buy those anywhere you buy curling irons/hair dryes).  DON'T chemically straighten it, you do NOT know what the result will be, and if it's disaster, you're kinda out of luck until it grows out.  a flat iron is only until the next shower.|`|47fdc44d27cae8e42a3a9dacbe4f2bb6aa	Perms are expensive and hurt your hair.<br>  <br>  Straightening is a hassle.<br>  <br>  I would get a haircut that makes your curls look cute but not little kid-ish, I like curly hair. :)|`|mCPMs7qsaa	an updo would be great for your curly hair!! maybe something like this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/gallery/prom/updos/12.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/gallery...</a><br>  <br>  or something like this might work as well:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/gallery/prom/downdos/06.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/gallery...</a><br>  <br>  or this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/gallery/prom/downdos/13.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/gallery...</a><br>  <br>  or this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/gallery/prom/downdos/01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/gallery...</a><br>   <br>  <br>  hope on of those works!! and congrats on ur graduation!!

He will start to noticing you more and probably talking to you more too. And maybe after you could just ask him who he likes, but don't ask specifically if he likes you because if he doesn't then that will bring a awkwardness between the two of you and you guys can still stay as friends.  If you are really close and ask him  who he likes then he wont notice that your asking him because you like him but that your asking him as a friend.|`|AA10788647	Don't worry, I've had this happen to me many times, just try to start a conversation with him and sit near him with group of friends and try to be helpful.

Good Luck =)|`|JRX2QJe9aa	don't just talk to him from time to time, talk to him all the time, but don't be a nag. flirt, flaunt, laugh, smile. compliment him! then after a while, talk to one of his best friends and see if the guy likes you.|`|ND3SefaNaa	do you ever catch him looking at you from across the room?<br>  <br>  if you guys used to be good friends then maybe just start a casual conversation and bring up that you guys haven't talked in a while and you miss it. see how he reacts. pay attention to his body language when you're talking to him.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|b70863a45f269c3d7ddfbbafba06054baa	ummmmm...ask him maybe? just a thought!|`|eE1pVqf7aa	Hey i had the same problem and i didn't say anything, so i missed my chance. I found out he liked me t the same time but didn't tell me and now it is too late. My crush also had like MANY diferent girls and he did not mention me :(<br>  BUT non the less you should tell him how you feel. There your feelings and if you bottle them up it will cost you (like in my case) so you have a small chance of being embarassed but a girls gotta know what a girls gotta know ( you will feel great after you've got it off your back) <br>  If he happends to say that he doesnot liek you ATLEAST you know how he truly feels and you can try and move on

36a004cc0d4d20eabf9b3eb0b9115722aa	Hiya, <br>  <br>  Im a hair stylist and the other two people that just awnsered the question are not giving you the awnsers that you want are they.<br>  <br>  Can i ask do you have short or long hair?<br>  <br>  Looking at the details you given it sounds quite short. If you have short hair its best to use a highlighting cap, NOT FOILS! Foils are too messy they will spill to area which you dont want highlighted on short hair. America or UK. I know both America and the UK sell the Loreal Highlighting Kit (perfect Blonde). It comes complete with the bleech and a cap and hook. This way you hook the hair that you want to highlight through the holes, it gives a more neater look. If you want them thicker just pull thicker strands through. <br>  <br>  If you would like to check out a review of that product i have one here. <a href="http://www.ciao.co.uk/L_Oreal_Perfect_Blonde_Creme_Highlight_Kit__Review_5576255" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciao.co.uk/L_Oreal_Perfect_Bl...</a> <br>  <br>  After putting in the brown hair dye, at least wait 2 days before lighting the hair. It might turn a dodgey colour if you do it strait after. The instructions should be included in the highlighting kit. However when lightening any hair you should always leave the bleach in for 30 minutes, never hessitate and take it off beofre that time, they will turn orange. <br>  <br>  Good Luck, if you want any more help jusy post me an e-mail.|`|4b023cd4d16b8c42ce54fc2fadd79380aa	Don't do it!... there is a reason hairdressers go to school for up to 4 years to learn this stuff. You are mixing chemicals to put on your hair and scalp, If you mix the wrong peroxide, or leave it in too long your hair could break off or turn to jelly, If you don't leave it long enough it will go orange (and that is NOT a good look) not to mention the reactions you could get on your skin.<br>  In order to lighten tinted hair you need to use bleach, and I strongly recommend you get a professional to do it for you.<br>  It's alot harder than you think.<br>  Think of it this way, you wouldn't walk into a scientist's lab and start mixing chemicals you know nothing about would you? This is the same thing.|`|AA11868540	I would highly NOT recommend doing highlights yourself. Go to supercuts - they only charge 20-30 dollars for highlights.
9n3rdbuyaa	They dont look real but the Coach purses are the same style that they have on Coach.com<br>  They could pass on being real though.|`|Gdt9xAQqaa	HA HA no i definitely do not think so!
e6XpiHAcaa	The magnetic earrings will hurt as much as the clip-on ones, since the concept is the same: two pieces of metal are squeezing the soft tissue of your ear. <br>  The main difference between the magnetic and the clip-ons are how they look. Clip-ons are okay for dangly, hoops, or large earrings. However if you want small earrings or studs, you should stick with magnetic earrings because the small clip-ons tend to look either childish or grandmotherly. <br>  Most well made magnetic earrings will not fall off, but I would definitely advise you against buying cheap magnetic earrings at places like Claire's or Target, because those are just a waste of money since they usually fall off pretty quickly. Magnetic earrings are something that you need to splurge on, because the more expensive ones have slightly stronger magnets.|`|7c14976adc2cb24cbd0b393be7725b09aa	clip ons dont hurt. the magnetic ones dont sound like anything i would do if i didnt want to loose an earring..  try a clip on at the store and see how it feels....... go from there|`|n2pz6sVcaa	I would suggest clip-ons because magnetic ones are more likely to fall off. Clip-ons don't hurt, you can adjust them to fit your comfort. I have no idea what a screwback is, but I would say to go with the clip-on, they look better (I think) and they're more secure, plus a little cheaper.|`|n3fBR5eaaa	DO NOT GET MAGNETIC EARRINGS!!!!<br>  trust me from experiance! you  wont lose them, they stay on really well, but the  magnets are Sooo strong, that it you wear them for  any longer than 10mins they become very painful!  they are so strong, they even stay on, if you have  them on your tongue!  I have my ears actually pieced, and they hurt alot  less than the magnets! Dont do it! I advise to get the clip on ones. you can get  some really pretty ones! The Clip on ones will hurt no where hear as  much as the magnetic ones.
8BdaqPO0aa	Don't worry about a thing.  The sooner you lose your hair, the better off you'll be.  Wait until you hear the replies you get from women.  They love bald guys.  Are you going bald?  Not sure, too young to tell.  The main thing is, don't sweat it.  One thing I have noticed is as you lose your hair on your head, you don't really lose it for good.  It just grows in other places.

Isso de falr q entope os poros, estragam a pele e blah blah blah n?o é verdade, porque n?o é porque é barato q é de má qualidade, tem mta coisa cara por aí de jogar no lixo assim como tem baratas boas e ruins. Qnd for comprar uma sombra verifique a validade, a textura ( macia) e a fixa??o, passe no bra?o e veja se a cor pega legal e qnt tempo ela dura alí. Pode saber q eu já passei uma marca cara e outra da p&w e a última durou mais enquanto a primeira ( da marcelo beauty n?o durou nada). Minha tia teve uma alergia danada com o delineador do boticário, os olhos co?aram e deminuiram na hora, já com o da bouche ( de 7 reais ) ela n?o teve nenhuma rea??o, isso n?o quer dizer q todos ter?o aergia ao delineador do boticário, eu mesma n?o tive,  quer dizer q cada pele é uma pele e n?o é o pre?o q vai ou n?o evitar a alergia, as vezes 1 componente q tem na cara ou na barata pode causar alergia. Ent?o, as vezes compro sombra por esse pre?o q vc pagou ou até mais, mas é pq n?o achei a cor iguyal de uma marca mais barata e pq tem algo especial como gliter, algo assim; mas antes procuro a mesma cor de uma q eu sei q boa e mais barata. Isso td n?o quer dizer q vc deva usar qualquer porcaria na pele, quer dizer q pre?o n?o diz se é bom ou ruim,<br>  Pode acreditar, experiência própria,<br>  Beijos|`|d7519556797eec500d3b562931372a36aa	claro que pagou. e as maquiagens da avon n?o s?o t?o boas assim.|`|qeDbRVfpaa	N?o, pois além de ser boa, é linda.

32c5a26e00e77bac07f6445e8dafc461aa	What is deal with people thinking it's wrong? Piercings have been around a long time, it's just a piercing. I got my belly button pierced when I was 13 as well, my parents never saw it as anything sexual. I never thought of it as anything sexual either. If you want it that bad, get a friend to do it. Seriously, "Nothing has any mean except the mean we give it".<br>  <br>  And about what that other person said about it not looking good when you get older. That's a lie. I still have mine in, I'm 17 now and it looks better than ever.|`|yZPPgsCEaa	I am a registered nurse and I just had to have my belly button pierced , right after college as my Parents would not allow me.<br>  <br>  Since then I have had allergic reactions to many tummy rings I had bought. They were expensive and hypersensitive also.<br>  <br>  It got infected 4 times and I finally took it out.<br>  You do what you want, just as I, and I hope you have better experience.<br>  I had thought I just  had to do it.|`|11u0R4FUaa	If i was you i would wait. They are all out of fashion now belly piercings. I got mine done when i was 18 and I've spent a fortune. It cost me about 40quid when i got it done. I got the ring put in with the stone. It hurt when i sat down, when i put the quilt on it. It was really uncomfortable for months and plus you have to clean it at least 4 times a day. Then i went back and asked them to take it out and put a bar in cos it was to painful and that belly bar cost me 50quid. I still have it in now but never show it off other than my holidays and to be honest it was a waste of money. If i was you i would wait cos it will be no comfort when your sitting in the classroom all day.|`|AA12005796	well im 14 and i have mine done.<br>  but then again i did mine myself, which i really wouldnt recommend. haah. <br>  i know you didnt want to hear its going to get infected, but it will. when its first done, i heard its alright if it gets a little infected, or some pus comes out. <br>  <br>  idk about the cost, but just go to a licensed peircer or something. make sure your moms there and knows whats going on, thats good. mine doesnt even know i did it, and thats bad.|`|N2toIg3Baa	In most states you have to be at least 16 to get anything pierced and at that age you have to have parental consent too,  so you won't be able to get it done at your age anyways unless you look up your states laws and it says otherwise. <br>  <br>  When you are old enough you will just have to work your parents into letting you do it they might feel differently by then, and maybe if you mention it now it will give them time to really think about it. You will really need to find a safe piercer though. Ask around and check into local shops and make sure its a licensed professional. Each shop is different in cost, but it should be around 30-40$ <br>  <br>  Also I enjoy body piercings greatly and I think that if you really want one you should go for it. You do need to take good care of your piercings though otherwise they most likely will get infected and trust me you don't want to deal with that. A piercing is a commitment that you need to take care of. Good luck to you!|`|hGuOTfr4aa	At 13, girls are not done growing,. If you get it pierced now, chances are, it's going ot reject from your changing body shape. You may thin out or put on some weight in that area, and it WILL NOT sit the same way. Then you'd have to get it repierced, which raises the risk of rejecting further and leaves a scar. Scar tissue in a piercing may make it sit crooked, and theres nothing you can do about it once that happens. I would reccomend waiting till at least 16, or even longer. And I know you don't want to. I didn't. And guess what. It rejected.<br>  <br>  rejection- when your body pushed the piercing out, leaving a flap and scar tissue.|`|k4R1yQpJaa	Please don't.|`|lumc7WXBaa	You shouldnt do it.|`|yqjDEWKtaa	honey, ur mom is kinda rite...it's slutty. really, if u want it that bad, wait till ur 16|`|zPkT8Nbbaa	wow ur my sisters age. why at age 13!?!?! your too young, wait till your 16 atleast

192009ea45008a6756e4a718ddd31bb7aa	Esse é um tema bem complexo, pois devemos sim, conviver com as pessoas deficientes e com síndromes, elas merecem respeito e devem conviver com os outros, mas por outro lado isso n?o atrapalharia o desempenho dos outros alunos? Uma vez que as crian?as com síndrome de dal precisam de mais aten??o e s?o mais lentas? Penso que poderiam entrar nas escolas, mas com turmas separadas por esse motivo, ou ent?o a sala de aula ter mais de uma professora, o que se torna praticamente impossível de conseguir em escolas públicas.|`|6D6YPhXEaa	Sincerament eu n?o vejo condi??es Pra'uma ou qualquer escola pulblica ter essa responssabilidade ou suporte pra'isso já q'o governo n?o vai ganhar nada com isso...|`|31f6fa3ccfe85c7ee511bbdc00933245aa	N?o.<br>  <br>  Porque n?o tem condi??es suficientes para atender a essa demanda, nem professores capacitados para lhe dar a assistência merecida.<br>  <br>  <br>  SIM<br>  Uma vez treinado o professor o paciente com SINDROME DE DOWN deverá e poderá ser aceito em qualquer Escola para sua integra??o e crescimento com o grupo no qual participe.

Inclus?o Escolar é o ato de preparar o ambiente escolar para receber um aluno com alguma necessidade especial, ao paso que Inser??o Escolar é o ato de colocar um aluno portador de alguma necessidade especial em uma escola e a adapta??o caberá única e exclusivamente ao aluno.<br>  Eu acredito que uma escola que vá receber um aluno com Síndrome de Down deve ter um professor com especializa??o em educa??o especial esperando por ele, além da prévia prepara??o da turma que irá receber um colega especial, afinal, a adapta??o deve ser dos dois lados. E muito importante: um aluno com Síndrome de Down n?o atrapalha em nada o ritmo de uma aula, pois o que ele n?o sabe, os seus colegas também n?o sabem!|`|FaJonuEjaa	Sim, pois essa quest?o de descrimina??o deve deixar de existir e parar com esse preconceito, ja que com a inclus?o social de um portador do sindrome de down ira ajudar no desenvolvimento da crian?a em si e das outras crian?as em volta dela, pois ira desmitificar algo que parece ser errado ou proibido.

Em 1o lugar, por tratar-se de crian?as ESPECIAIS (e como s?o ESPECIAIS!). Ainda tem gente que as confunde com deficientes, ao contrário, elas s?o muito EFICIENTES e podemos aprender muito com elas. <br>  Em 2o lugar, para uma escola receber essas crian?as tem que estar preparada e bem orientada. Isso desde de o faxineiro até o diretor. os colégios de crian?as especiais tem toda uma estrutura própria para eles. Eu concordo totalmente que essas crian?as devam estudar em escola regular, junto com todas as crian?as de sua faixa etária. Mas os educadores devem ser preparados para lidar com as diferen?as, pois elas existem e n?o podemos ignorá-las, sen?o, vem os preconceitos, a discrimina??o, etc. <br>  Os alunos tendem a aceitar com mais facilidade essas diferen?as, já os pais de alunos, os professores, etc. tendem a ser mais resistentes. é muito fácil falar que aceitamos a situa??o, mas na prática, com a convivência, verificamos que a realidade é outra...<br>  Se for para o crescimento dessas crian?as, eu concordo em integrá-la às escolas regulares. Mas se n?o for um compromisso sério (treinamento/integra??o dos profissionais da área educacional) de respeito e dignidade, deixe-as nos colégios especiais...|`|grCw9wtVaa	Com certeza! é uma vergonha a desigualdade em que nos encontramos hoje em dia.

8b96e0549932f6f7dc7802568aa00011aa	OK, this is a tough problem.  I am an African-American woman and here is what I would try if I were you:<br>  <br>  1)  First, I would go to my doctor.  Since you have a medical condition that may be exacerbating the problem, a doctor should be the first visit.  If I were you, I might also see preferably an African-American female dermatologist who can help with hair issues specific to African-American hair types.<br>  <br>  2)  For the itching, I would shampoo with Kera Care Dry and Itchy Scalp Shampoo and Conditioner.  Essence magazine readers rated it highest for shampoos for itchy scalp and I have had success with them for my scalp.  Kera Care's products are featured on their website at www.keracare.com/avlon.html.<br>  <br>  3)  After washing and conditioning and while your hair is still wet, I would apply a hair moisturizing product that is plant-oil based rather than mineral-oil based, concentrating on the challenging area.  Cheap products like Luster's Pink Oil and even baby oil for skin rely on mineral oil which is an inexpensive but low-quality oil that does not do as great a job of moisturizing hair as products that are plant oil based.   Quality plant oil-based hair moisturizers are expensive but worth it.  It's important to do this while your hair is still damp because that's what moisturizers are really meant to do - lock in moisture from water.  I had to learn from reading about hair that moisturizers don't moisturize in and of themselves - they lock in what moisture is already there.  (I favor Hair Balm from the company Carol's Daughter because it does a good job and you can get away with using a small amount so the product lasts.  Check out www.carolsdaughter.com for more information about their products.  You might see another product you'd like to try.  If you don't like to order online, their  website offers store locations nearest you.)<br>  <br>  Then style your hair as usual.  If you can swing it, I would do this at least twice a week.<br>  <br>  Now my question for you:  Is there normal hair in front that could possibly hide this more challenging area you are asking about?  If so, after washing, conditioning, and moisturizing, I might try cornrowing the challenging area (if it's long enough) and letting the normal hair hide the cornrow in a style somehow or setting up the cornrow in a style that shows and is comfortable for you.  Cornrowing the challenging area will keep you from combing through it when it's at its most vulnerable and will strengthen the hair. <br>  <br>  Also, let me say that ultimately what works for you will be an exercise in trial and error since what works for others may or may not work for you.  I am 31 years old and have basically found my personal hair care regimen but through much trial and error.  As I'm sure you already know, if you keep trying new things until you find whatever works you'll get there.<br>  <br>  Good luck with this and I wish you the best!|`|86a15665d2f5ff544690968b540a01f9aa	uhmmmm....I think you just need some moisturizer.

On the very bottom of the back of my head I've had some problems. Not nearly as bad as yours but still bad. It was really really dry and mind you...I have a really oily head. The dematologist gave me liquid "steroids" for my head. Its a liquid that I put on every night. You may have folliculitis. Go to a dermatologist asap. <br>  Hope you get better.|`|32747dcd374c857319720ae0aa088b0faa	I have heard of hair problems like this being a symptom of PCOS.<br>  <br>  I'm also not African-American, but I agree that you should see a dermatologist. It could very well be that it's some skin problem that the hair loss is just secondary to. A good dermatologist is the way to go.

2dd43f0f449ef56d3c5f72700ca0bf6caa	i guess theyre...preppy?  boring?  unremarkable?<br>  <br>  i find that if you want to be a true preppy-prep-prep kid, rush to the nearest ralph lauren or lacoste (basic prep geary, dont you know...or brooks brothers! they have nice dress shirts), and pick up a few light colored and a few black colored crisp shirts.  get some nice pants too (khaki, white, pale colors are lovely for summer holidaying, yachting, etc).  then branch out to other similar stores, like vineyard vines or j. crew or something.  then for chillier weather, go and buy some nice wool and cashmere.  lacoste is pretty good about that, as is ralph lauren and lyle & scott.  i dont really pay attention to menswear that much im afraid.  but:<br>  clean<br>  crisp<br>  neat<br>  polished<br>  keep that in mind and youll be an uber-prep boarding schooler (like i was!)<br>  <br>  that is clean and polished.  or you could get the used-looking jeans and crumply shirts and just be...boring|`|WmMZQcg3aa	Yep, they are pretty preppy, especially the polo shirt. Some other preppy stores are Lands' End, L.L. Bean, Eddie Bauer. They all have websites you can shop online from.|`|AA12319871	kinda:{)|`|1Hqwwphoaa	Well don't start all in right away or you'll b a total poser. Go for searsucker pants, ralph lauren polos, madras pants. American eagle and jeans aren't super preppy. If you aren't too afraid of print and want to go SUPER prep try lilly pulitzer mens. That's as prep as it gets.|`|9n3rdbuyaa	the shirt is preppy but the rest is sporty.<br>  all these stores are preppy!<br>  *Abercrombie & Fitch<br>  *Amercian Eagle<br>  *Hollister<br>  *Aeropostale|`|xu2wvJ4Vaa	No, more like jock <br>  but prep is a lot like jock so i guess yeah|`|15e2a05cec83326f06cb47d5077085dbaa	lol go to my myspace...lol <br>  www.myspace.com/supa_fly_peterr<br>  <br>  yea i guess the clothes your gettin are prep, but idk bout the shoes.  i would wear loose fitting shoes. lacoste? k-swiss|`|51db044335e804649ca1cac1c8b053a0aa	dude, reeboks aren't cool! get  hollister and abercrombie stuff.  ae isn't really cool anymore either.|`|AA12372714	Why try to be someone you're not?

I'd try some nikes, american eagle shoes, or shoes from J.

You really should try doing this on your own (picking out preppy clothes) because it would give you more practice.|`|itp6El1Naa	Prep is just a label. IF YOU LIKE THE CLOTHES, WEAR THEM. My gosh, I'm so sick of everyone labeling people by what they wear. It's like no one gets to know who people are, as fas as their personalities. If you don't dress like them, they won't talk to you. The whole world needs to go get a life.|`|9fcf6e139f5128a37109663c814914dbaa	Hollister screams preppy!|`|AA11700922	yes deff preppy especialy the polo shirt but be youreself is what counts|`|D0re6SHiaa	Kinda, why would you want to be a prep anyway lol !?i|`|XfhB01Jxaa	blah, why do you want to go preppy? so you can look the same?<br>  eww, please don't I'd rather you go ghetto, because you'll have SOME sense of style, no, no,no NOT preppy. blah|`|bbae7336c75c55ed2a16269e216b5195aa	haha they're chav clothes.  Just wear what you like, don't try to be something for the sake of it.|`|bipGUmsgaa	the shoes look kinda jock but the shirt definetaly looks preppy|`|uKgDVEWxaa	ugh...yes, if you HAVE to put a label on it! And why are you "trying" to "go preppy"??? Wear whatever you want; I mean if your natural style is to dress "preppy[ish]" then you should obviously dress that way. But you should wear what you want; don't "try" to not be yourself....good grief...when will people like you finally understand?! *sighs*|`|z8bR5YTJaa	jock, kinda nerdy
9n3rdbuyaa	ok you cant wake up one day and say im going to be a model!<br>  you have to model for stores, be a certified model,have a agency, make a portfolio, have modeling experience, be tall, have the look and personality too! if you already have a portfolio that doesnt mean you are a model! and yes you do have to graduation certificate signed by a professional.<br>  i am a model and it takes time not just one moment when you decide you want to be a model. most models know everthing already like how to walk, etc.<br>  when i started modeling i already knew how to walk they didnt have to teach me! and a lot of ppl. who want to be a model cant.
5DeoecIHaa	American eagle has very cute dresses that you could wear. Try adding some jewelry like rings/bracelets/necklaces. Those always add more "something" to any outfit. Besides just thinking about the outfit get your hair done the day of. You'll look great and all eyes will be on you.<br>  <br>  As for a casual outfit bascially anything will go. Be creative for this outfit. Look in the stores and try something on that you NEVER would think about. Who knows you may actually like it. Try layering your tops. I always do that with a cute baby-tee and a lacy cami underneath. It always gets a casual outfit a little more fancy.<br>  <br>  P.S. Don't put on a lot of makeup. I personally don't like to look like I have even that much on. Try going with a more NATURAL beauty that makeup can't give you.<br>  <br>  good luck =]|`|4a66c39720b3c324a4495f062a5288edaa	Dressy:<br>  <a

TRmyktLpaa	Try L'Oreal Ultra Bleach. You may have to still redo several times to get rid of the black.<br>  <br>  It's tricky, would be better if you let your hair grow out. I suggest, for the meantime, just do the front, some streaks or chunks of your hair, rather than all of it, else I fear you'll have a frustrating time dying your hair.<br>  <br>  And yes, you have to bleach first for a bright color to show up properly.|`|AA10597794	after bleaching it use shampoo for blondes, no need for the expensive stuff john freida will do.  And use hair sprays like sun-in or some off brand.|`|hKWZLamLaa	I have really dark hair, so when I wanted to dye my hair bright colours I had to strip the colour until it was really blond. The lighter the hair, the brighter the colour will be. <br>  I used a powdered bleach mixed with peroxide (You have to know what you are doing to use this stuff as it is VERY TOXIC). <br>  You should only bleach the same section of hair 2-3 times at most. Any more, the hair will be so damaged, it will become brittle and break off.|`|yZPPgsCEaa	IF HAIR IS AREADY COLORED BLACK-<br>  TO LIFT THIS PROCCESS AND HAVE IT LIFT TO ITS<br>  MAXIMUM POTENTIAL-OVER THE COUNTER PRODUCTS ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO DO SO.<br>  <br>  IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO PROFESSIONAL BLEACH YOU WILL NEED ASSISTANCE, ONLY BECAUSE YOU CAN NOT SEE THE BACK OF YOUR HAIR AND YOU ONLY NEED TO APPLY IT ON A CERTAIN AREA, LIKE YOU ENDS FOR ISNTANCE.<br>  <br>  YOU CAN OF COURSE APPLY COLOR TO BLEACHED HAIR AFTERWARDS.<br>  <br>  BUT IF IT IS NOT LIFTED TO THE MAXIMUM AND YOU DO NOT HAVE EXTREMELY STRAIGHT PARTINGS YOU MAY RUN INTO PROBLEMS.<br>  <br>  I WISH YOU LUCK, BE EVER SO CAREFUL.

Waxing  is a natural  form of taking away hair it is  from honey wax or plants so it will not harm the skin.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you have money get  laser its permanent hair removal,So do your research and find whats best for you.|`|f4d57d9522768ba8a3332d9edc329b72aa	No, it's not a good idea.  Male facial hair is coarser and has much stronger roots than other male body hair or female hair.  I am an experienced waxee (on all other areas) and even I wouldn't have my face done.  Hair on the head is similar, by the way.<br>  <br>  I suggest a product called Kalo which is a hair re-growth inhibitor like the one mentioned by the other answerer.  The makers claim that it works after waxing (other areas of the body) or shaving but they admit that it doesn't work as well after shaving.  I haven't used it yet myself, so can't give you first hand reports.<br>  <br>  Check out <a href="http://www.nisim.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nisim.com</a> .|`|yZPPgsCEaa	Waxing is harmless, however it does make some people to have a little irritation. Not for everyone. Even professional wax has caused a little discoloration. And some places a little bit of a break-out. But it is harmless.<br>  <br>  The only way it can harm your skin is if-the person removing the wax cloth is pulling the skin tissue down, if it is pulled in an upward motion, no problem.<br>  <br>  Their are other alternatives that are very expensive and electrolysis can cause scabbing on the area.<br>  So waxing to me is a very safe and fairly inexpensive way to go.<br>  But it does require maintenance.|`|0GnuAk2haa	rEaD ThE PaKeT|`|2Tf7AQA7aa	nooooooo, thats gonnna hurt|`|90482d668a05638ab7ffb67e8135b088aa	Are you a male? If yes, then which specific area on the face are you talking aboout, other than ofcourse the beards and the mostache? <br>  I have a solution for you though.<br>  There's a new technology product, available in India, the Aloe-Vera based cream is designed to remove the growth of unwanted hairs of the face, arms, underarms, legs, bikini line etc. The unwanted hairs first need to be removed from a normal intact skin by waxing, threading, plucking, epilating etc.<br>  Effectiveness of the cream depends on how effectively the hairs have been removed at the first place. When the hair is plucked / pulled from the root it exposes the core of the hair-manufacturing factory to the cream. Now the active principle of the cream permanently damages this hair-manufacturing factory itself. Repeated application of the cream after every hair removal sessions effectively deactivates more and more hair FOLLICLES. And as we are all born with a limited number of hair follicles on the body, the number of hair keep declining. The final result is that YOU WILL NOT HAVE HAIRS FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE where the cream has been used !!!<br>  For further details you may write to, technologysystems@yahoo.co.in|`|NozFFHEBaa	no that will thinen ur facial skin then u will get easier skin burns and skin cansers..|`|ODUFlZHcaa	Get it done professionally and you should be fine.|`|Q2GyD9ioaa	Waxing is very common and although it could be possibly dangerous, it's low-risk.<br>  Since it's your first time waxing, I would recommend going to a professional.|`|nIMHSQVmaa	You may get some irritation, why not use a hair removal cream. Check this one <a href="http://www.hairremovalplus.com/?aid=944079" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairremovalplus.com/?aid=9440...</a>|`|zr0qDXWsaa	from experience i can tell you that it will irritate your skin! either by causing a pimply rash or by causing pimples. Although your face will be hair free for a few days, it will grow back more stubblier and darker and thicker! it will look more obvious and you will have to keep on getting it done.

Procure falar pausadamente, isto é calmamente. Leia bastante, leia em voz alta para se habituar às palavras, isto é, acostumar o ouvido. Estude verbos e muito cuidado com as conjuga??es de tempos. Tudo é quest?o de tempo e você se sentirá mais segura. E isto será para a vida toda.|`|D2ZOaT8baa	Ent?o só tem uma solu??o, leia.......|`|Dq2u2NWEaa	Minha filhaa melhor coisa que vc tem a fazer é:<br>  1o n?o querer ser quem n?o é<br>  2o pegue uma gramática e leia em voz alta, simplesmente pratique, estude. E leia, leia muito, leia livros, revistas, literaturas frutíferas. Isso cairá bem até numa entrevista de emprego, e na sua carreira seja lá do que for, te garanto!<br>  3o reveja os seus conseitos de amizades, acho que se você for mesmo amiga dessas pessoas e essas pessoas forem seus amigos, você aceitará as corre??es da parte deles, na boa, pois como amigos est?o te ajudando a melhorar assim eles, te ajudar?o a melhorar, te corrigindo, mas sem rir e nem fazer piadinhas.<br>  <br>  Mas inda te dou outro toque, o fato de ser rico, n?o quer dizer que a pessoa seja educada e inteligente e que você tem que se portar bem na frente dos ricos. Assim como também n?o quer dizer que você tem que se portar mal, ser mundi?a nafrente dos pobres. Vou te dar um exemplo: Dercy Gon?alves. é (ou era,n?o sei ela ainda é viva - n?o moro no Brasil,sinceramente n?o sei e nem faz diferen?a saber ou n?o) uma artista, que desde muito nova que trabalha, logo, deve ser rica, pelo menos na minha consep??o é muito má educada, mundi?a, quesó sabe falar palavr?o, mas devido ao mundo hoje em dia ter muitas pessoas com o pensamento semelhante ao seu,a má educa??o dela simplesmente é vista como expontaneidade. Abra os olhos, simplemente seja educada, fale bem, assim como deseja, é muito bonito da sua parte querer progredir e te dou parabéns<br>  ainda mais por expor o seu problema a todos correndo risco de alguem simplesmente te chamar de burra e te colocar pra baixo. N?o tenha destin??o entre ricos e pobres para usar de sua educa??o,  na verdade, é isso é que é ser fino. é ser verdadeiro, é ser você.<br>  <br>  Sucesso.|`|VcVMHg4Daa	Fique longe das Amigas dos Meninos e principalmente dos Ricos.|`|zxNyDEDBaa	e so n?o falar nada fique calada..|`|04cf10aa99105f5a2e6a4e7647d1b0a4aa	como disse o colega acima, estude, e para falar corretamente, comece a ler o máximo possível de coisas de boa qualidade, nada como revistinhas de conselhos femininos ou adolescentes e horóscopo, gibis, e papagaiadas do tipo, leia livros de autores respeitados e de assuntos sérios.

Numero perfetto non ti saprei dire.. dipende da come è una persona.. ad esempio se sei alta 1.80 e porti un 36/37bè.. non è proprio il massimo.. come se sei alta 1.60 e porti un 39/40.. ci deve essere una via di mezzo.. una proporzione tra l'altezza e la corporazione di una persona con il numero di piedi.. :)|`|4HmzWj0daa	Io porto il 39...

w5IX4bqxaa	A long time ago, my school had Wacky Hair Day and my parents had this completely ingenious idea...what they did was took a wire hanger, cut it in two even halves, and straightened them out. I don't exactly remember how, but we got them to stand straight up while I braided my hair around them. It came out so good and everybody thought that it looked amazing. Of course we were all in second grade so they were like, "are you supposed to be an alien or something?" Anyway... I highly reccomend you do it and if you do it right, the results are amazing. <br>  <br>     By the way... I have thick curly hair that went just past my shoulders so I reccomend you don't straighten your hair, as it will help to cover the wire completely. Also, if you want to add a little extra something to it, put some colored hair spray in it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|N8fVDHyZaa	Last time I did it.. I tied some of it into a bun. Then I took little strands on each side and like bobby pinned them loosely so it looked really messy.|`|r5NTRG17aa	tease it insainly! its combing backwards. its SO cool. just pull a chunk of hair, and comb towards the top of your head. then put it in tons of pigtails, or just leave it like that. dont forget to put a couple spritzes of hairspray so it stays, or just bring a brush for touch ups.|`|wP9C0cxpaa	first things first, you need to straighten your hair if you want to do anything with it! after that, add colorful highlights to your hair with hair coloration spray (you can get it at a costume store, it commes in a spray can) the spray doesnt take forever to come out, all you have to do is take a shower and wash your hair. then just clip your hair up and make it look like you just got out of bed. once you're done with that, i would suggest adding clips, barettes, posibble one of those plastic tiaras if you have one, just anything that you think looks wacky and crazy!<br>  <br>  i hope this helps!

As redes nervosas se estruturam como "galhos" se alterando ou se fortalecendo cada vez que um tipo de estímulo é enviado.  Isso explica a dificuldade que certas pessoas têm de sair de seus estágios depressivos.|`|Let9XrHWaa	A pergunta foi???<br>  PQ EXISTE A TRISTEZA????|`|MuD5iYUJaa	imagina se todos andassem felizes nao teria gra?a....

The proportions are all wrong, and they make your feet look large. They are harder to do up than low-tops, and you can wear socks other than ankle socks because they are so high you don't have to worry about the whole "tennis socks and sneakers thing".<br>  Low-tops ARE great with skirts and shorts, but they don't really work with pants that are a teeny pit too short (high-tops would solve this). If you choose the low-tops, please please please invest in some ankle socks! ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE WEARING PANTS THAT SHOW OFF YOUR ANKLES!!!!<br>  They are both really hard to choose from (I couldn't choose so I have booth!) so good luck! Make sure to weigh the pros and cons!:P|`|66kA9Zwbaa	mmm, i have only had hi-top converse, personally they rocked. and when i didn't like them i would just fold them down, low tops were okay,but they just reminded me of any other normal sneakers or van's sneakers, so i didn't buy them|`|VAVd3FEnaa	I prefer hitops. I like them because they support my ankle and I think they look cooler. You shoe is on you a bit more secure and people can't steal them off you (Like friends) and they won't fall off.

bf70c11aa50d0b36438dbcd3a85ec248aa	I am the master of spiral curls lol and I suggest a 1/2 inch curling iron and as you are doing you hair do small pieces at a time and before you curl a piece spray a littlehair spray on it so the curls will stay in :) Works wonders for me but it can take awhile if you have a lot of hair..... BUT another way which takes less time which I do every day is....<br>  <br>  Use a bigger curling iron about 1 inch... blow dry your hair upside down to add more volume to it... Curling enough hair to fit the curling iron at once.... usually smaller pieces on the top layers so it will look better, but the bottoms layers dont really need to be perfect because you dont really seem them... Once you are down hold your head upside down and spray hair spray on it and shake it around a lil till it dries.... this adds more volume to it :) <br>  Hope this helps|`|f0156ba54a6bc46d2cb9674ded47ab95aa	curlers work a lot better. if your hair is wet use the cheap foam kind and let your hair dry in the curlers, or use the hot ones on already dried hair. btw roll the curlers under not over for the best look|`|c9c76297191ac14d97bee289977e7fa7aa	"Shape curls into spirals with the iron as you work from strand to strand.

Thicker hair may require up to a few minutes.<br>  After you remove each curl from the iron, let it completely cool before touching it.  Do not brush or touch the newly created curls.  When you have finished curling your entire head, spray with a good spray.  If any of the curls are not as tight as you would like, use the curling iron to spot curl."
D7QdvWYDaa	Any color she pleases and something that may blend with her skin tone. I would first visit <a href="http://www.opi.com/opi/opistudio.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.opi.com/opi/opistudio.aspx</a> OPI Try-On This Color virtual hand model studio. Match your skin tone and choose a nail color you like. Every-time you select a nail color the virtual model's nails change to that shade.<br>  <br>  Some woman match their outfits, like when they wear a brown top and shoes they might wear dark colors. Or they may wear wild and bright colors with jeans. Dark nails are cool this season, purple, or chocolate shades. Even blues, Like "OPI Russian Navy" I like that one and wear it on my toenails.<br>  <br>  Don't forget if you wear open toed shoes to paint them as well. Also, a simple French Manicure is always gorgeous looking on any beautiful woman. |`|l5bdmc74aa	purple-black|`|9thbLwBTaa	Pink...or red....it really depends..|`|BgCrYu2faa	Black,Red and dark Blue.<br>  <br>  its edgy.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	How old is the girl?

d3ca03b4a0918e129433e38fd0bf1f6daa	you probubly shouldn't use orajel, plus if you're gonna get a peircing, ya gotta realise it isn't gonna be completely painless, not usually anyway, lol.  Also, at the peircing places they usually have a type of anasthetic that they put on the needle that makes it a bit less painless. They did that when they peirced my nose.  When you go to the place where you're getting it done, ask about if they do something like that.  Also, try to relax as best ya can, it'll hurt more if ur all tense, plus being un relaxed will cause it to hurt more because you'll convince yourself it's gonna hurt and then it will, lol.  So just relax and talk to your peircer, and enjoy your peircing! :D|`|5ca8d18566af8bd516385f59eb621bcdaa	Orajel would only give a quick numbing,I do not think it would work very good.<br>  Personally I would pack lips with ice then quickly pierce lip , like freezing or chilling it to become numb.?|`|5cabfa3fcc07ff1c94983d0988323d59aa	Orajel is not that strong.  It would work, but you would have to keep reapplying it every 3 - 5minutes.<br>  <br>  Stuffing your mouth with/eating mouthfuls of ice chips right before for a whole five minutes will numb your tongue and mouth too, but not that much.  <br>  <br>  Just suck it up and take it like a man!  Rub some dirt on it.|`|db8c6271af0c67a5f4165152a989fed2aa	eww dont get a lip piercing, they are weird and funky and i went to the mall and this dude had like his whole face pierced. gross.|`|e3a49389865302c0eb4d08437f1f4438aa	ask the person that's gonna do it|`|e9cbfdcb55f14c4bf82fe3ab0103b129aa	Dont worry about numbing it.<br>  Its next to painless.

4e26063700b77ba28ea620b832f32431aa	I do have a used cell phone. Why do you want me to e-mail you?|`|1e4ce0503c73bafef50e3de6a5c1e59daa	given details are not clear...|`|d939abe5c2bbe6337c03a4292bbc560caa	Could you explain this a little more?<br>  Like, which company are you with (Cingualr, Alltell, Verizon, etc)?<br>  I'm assuming yours has either broke or was stolen. This is two different problems and has different solutions.<br>  <br>  Lots of assumptions here: Lets say you are with Cingular and your baby chewed on the phone instead of a pacifier. ;-)<br>   You can go up to Wal-Mart, buy one of Cingular's Go phone for around $40 to $50, charge it up, take the chip (SIM Card) out of the dead phone and put it the Go phone, and then your good to go. You don't even need to take it to the Cingular store to get it activated; as long as you have a monthly service plan with Cingular, just you can swap chips yourself. <br>  <br>  You won't need the chip that came with the Go Phone, because it is at $0.10 to $0.20 a minute, so throw it away or give it away.<br>  <br>  As a side note, let's say you look on ebay for cell phones. Unless the phone is made for your cell company, or it is unlocked for your cell company, you can't use it. Example: If you are with Cingular, you can't use Motorolla's Razr made for Verizon with it, unless you have paid around $20 to have it unlocked to Cingular.<br>  <br>  For a stolen phone, you can pretty much do the same, but you alos have to buy a new SIM Card from the cell phone company for about $20.

Wear your hair down, and put on some lipgloss.|`|55db9207e414555ed18263ff1ec277fbaa	Well i would say your cool. The strong contrast between your hair and skin means that dramatic make-up suits you best. Your best eye colours would be cool grey, black, ivory, silver and rich plum. Your best lipsticks would be fushsia pinks, crimson reds, deep plum, or mauves and make sure you keep your blusher pale pink (sugary or rose tones are the most flattering)<br>  <br>  Hope that hepls!|`|AA11572442	First, which kind of jewellery looks best, gold or silver???<br>  Warms wear gold, and cools wear silver.  If you hold it against your skin, does it seem to glow or make you look sick???  Is that how you want to present yourself to the world???<br>  Just from the info you described, it is not enough, you need to see the tones and hues to get an accurate idea of good color choices for you.  What colors (and black is not a color) do you normally lean towards???<br>  I am a winter, but prefer to wear autumn colors and can get away with it because I color my hair.<br>  You need to see a professional.  Even hair dressers can give you an idea (ones that have been in the business a long time and are in high demand).  Don't base your decisions on anyone that does parties in the home, tho...no all are bad, but then again not all of them have gone to school for a year like I have.|`|b0f4ba1fbeb296ca0275eafa58d05e6aaa	Go to www.marykay.com/slbrown06 and click on virtual makeover and it will lead you through your skin color and some other questions then tell you what colors you should wear.

However if it gets slightly longer than the 'emo' length we're talking about, it begins to curl at the ends. The only way I've found to combat this is to put in some Loreal hair straightener, and use a hair straightener, this typically gives me the look I'm going for.
CCYWYk3qaa	Then carry some 'wet wipes' in your purse. Do not douche, that actually removes the 'good' bacteria which helps your Va~j~j stay clean.

(Be careful with the severeness of the smell, it might be from normal to a condition) <br>  Make sure you shower as close to the date as possible and make sure you dry your privates as much as possible, any left moisture in there can cause smells from just rubbing your thighs together. <br>  That should do the trick for you.<br>  <br>  Also, try not to wear clothes that will "Make you sweat down there" go as light as possible. :-)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. And have fun at your date!|`|Bfs8j22Yaa	They say not to use douche because it can make the smell worse. Don't spray perfume either, because that can cause infections. If you smell down there you need to go see your doc because you might already have an infection. You also just might be self conscious so if you don't smell anything your fine.|`|nVLwjX4Haa	Deodorant Sure go with cool breeze|`|AA11113418	I would say don't douche.  OB/GYN has condoned this practice for awhile. It can either cause extreme dryness or may produce more bad odor. The body naturally cleans itself.   You really should have any really bad odor unless, you have some kind of infection  or something.   You can use a gentle anti bacterial soap  or Summer's Eve feminine wash and it does the trick.Clean all crevices thoroughly and rinse.  Then after bathing  dry off the area properly. Alleviating, additional moisture will help increase the smell.  |`|VRMNlmBraa	Girl! I get monthly brazilian waxes and i stay fresh and clean all year round.

I had to do it a few times. |`|KtdlJbrOaa	They do have that type of thing at beauty supply stores, but I would recommend going to a salon for that process.

There are tons of web sites where you can get ideas on how to re-make different items of clothing into things that will fit your style. ummm...maybe not the elastic waist shorts, but you can express your creativity and have something that is unique. <3|`|QpU2E2byaa	My grandmother did that all of the time to me. I learned how to sew and started altering the fabrics so it would work for me. If the print or fabric was hideous I would just act like I loved it and not wear it but other stuff I would alter so it looked good (even if I just made it into a purse).|`|pA0pm0VNaa	act like u like it...BUT NEVER wear it|`|9fdkynRHaa	Ahh..lol I love old people. They're so innocent and old fashioned. You could try being upfront with her about your style. Better yet, tell her you don't need anymore clothes, and that if she wants to get you a gift, to just give you money instead. :o) I know what you mean by not wanting to hurt her feelings.|`|twD13Zzqaa	does your grandmother live with you? if she does, that's hard because she always sees what you wear. unfortunately, if you want to spare her feelings you will just have to wear the clothes. i don't mean wear them to school or out with your friends, but come up with times when she will see you wearing them and you don't have to be super embarrassed wearing them. such as, if it's a saturday or sunday and you aren't planning on going anywhere you could just wear the ugly clothes while you are at your house (if she lives with you). or just wear it when you go to her house, and change when you get home (if she doesn't live with you). if she sees you in a certain item of clothing once you won't have to wear it again for a month or 2 again. if she doesn't live with you and she sees you and asks why you aren't wearing something she gave you, say you just wore it the other day and it's in the wash. if some of the clothes are cotton material you could always wear them as pajamas. also, you could always wear a top she gave you over or under something when she sees you and then either take it off when you leave the house (you will have a normal tank top or shirt underneath) for public eyes or put something on over the item like a sweater so no one sees it. hope i gave u some creative ideas!
TJTB6PJhaa	High brand mascara because they use better things to make it. And because I love labels. Lol. I only use Diorshow mascara by Dior. It's the best.|`|gW8VFRmjaa	i do have some drug store mascaras...i loved my telescopic, as well as my define a lash. i just got this one from rimmel glam lash i think it's called.<br>  however, my favorite ones that i use the most are my Diorshow, another Dior one i can't remember the name now..it's a skinny navy blue tube, and my MAC Plushlash. I also LOVE MAC's Zoomlash. MAC isn't high brand though. Well I guess i would consider it better quality but the price is roughly around what you pay for drugstore mascaras. I bought my glam lash for like 12$cdn and my MAC mascaras are 13$cdn.<br>  <br>  it's really personal preference. you're supposed to throw away your mascaras every three months, so if you do that..i guess i'd go on the cheap side. but the more expensive mascaras lasssssssst. they don't dry out as quickly, and I really think that quality mascara matters because I don't want something gross that smells like permenant marker clogging up my lash cuticles. <br>  <br>  so i guess weighing the pros and cons of each, if I could only have one I'd go for the higher end mascaras. Invest in something I use everyday.<br>  <br>  <br>  btw Diorshow is so beautiful, you get full volumized lashes. they almost look fake! and i think plushlash is a good cheaper alternative to Diorshow. you get that same crazy effects and the brush is sooo great..I NEVER get clumps. |`|bmRkisSMaa	well...from my personal experience...I'm one of those who doesn't like splashing out too much on make up...but when i went to the states I couldn't resist when I came across "Fibrewig" it was the latest thing in the high brand mascara market and after hearing that it topped Japan as the best mascara (and Japan does come out with some pretty hi tech stuff) and gave literally a false lash effect with all the fibre in it...it was either that or Diorshow but I went with the Fibrewig...<br>  4 months later its sitting at the bottom of my drawer with my 'rejects'...totally useless.<br>  So I'm back to my Bourjois Coup de Theatre or Maybelline XXL....From what I can tell...construction mascaras (ones with white ends and black ends)...work the same if not better than the high brand ones....but I haven't got much frame of reference.<br>  So if you havent got the money for a high brand one yet....don't completely reject the construction mascaras.<br>  |`|KtdlJbrOaa	I prefer Maybelline Great Lash.  I have tried all the high end brands, but don't like any as well.  Many Hollywood make-up artists swear by Great Lash.  |`|3Qlhbcctaa	High brand is pretty much a waste of money - thats if you're thinking about buying stuff from dior or chanel. There's a mascara that i got from the USA because in wasnt available over here in england at the time called 'maybelline define- a lash' and now its out in england i use it all the time. its really good and it only costs about ￡6 which i would say is about $10-$12. and the best thing about it it that you can get it in a volumising style, to add volume to your lashes, r if you want xxl lenght theres a lengthening one. but do avoid the cheap brand mascara's because they are clumpy and make your eyelashes look awaful! i hope this helps! xxxxxxxxxx<br>  |`|XB7yja3caa	Dior Show is the best.  I just tried Givenchy's new one, but the brush was too small--it defined and made longer, but didn't thicken.  Dior Show--hands down.  |`|DJq20m3Aaa	I prefer high brand, only cause the bristles are finer, and its better quality. I aint screwing up my eyes!|`|AA11297919	High brand because they are usually better quality and you get what you pay for. :]|`|GKQJRJAMaa	Personally my favorite mascara is Diorshow mascara by Dior. No matter how many coats I put on, I still get no clumps. So I like high brand mascara best. I know some people like define a lash which is drugstore, and ive tried that too but i didn't like it. It's basically a matter of opinion, what kind of mascara your looking for, and your eyelash type. And many times high brand is better quality.

It's not exactly a hard-and-fast rule, but basically, if you're not wearing a blazer, your pants should never be lighter than your shirt, and the only thing not lighter than black is more black.|`|wiYwIvGWaa	black shoes, black pants, black shirt, purple tie. make sure hat the tie isnt to dark of  purple. |`|KtdlJbrOaa	either black pants or very dark denim|`|gaPpPgokaa	Black pants.

RGjjbKsWaa	Okay, it perfectly fine. I know its really embarrassing  because in class or work your smelly. But heres the tip<br>  <br>  1. Make sure your hair shampoo is an healthy like : Head and Shoulders, Dove or Pantene.<br>  <br>  2.For your body use a fruit kind of body shampoo and put it in a scrubber. Fruit body shampoos are fruity which makes smell extra good. With the scrubber scrub your body with it a lot. Make sure your whole body is fill with the shampoo.Than while the water goes gently rinse yourself. Not to much because the scent can go away.<br>  <br>  3.Every after shower use, use a good smelling lotion to put all over your body. That's right LOTION. Make sure you use the lotion before you putting clothes. You should use lotion every after shower, when waking up and after bed.<br>  <br>  4.Put your deodorant on. Make sure its not does that may look good but also on that is good for your body. A deodorant i prefer would be Secret.<br>  <br>  5.The thing for me is that i would usually wear undershirts.Like tank tops. The good with them is that your sweat will go in the tank and there is no need for you to be smelly. Every time i wear a tank i never stink! Try not to wear dozens of outfits.<br>  <br>  6. Put your perfume on your skin(near your armpits) and once on your shirt.<br>  Thats pretty much it. Hope i helped|`|MGjMjWwaaa	wear deoterent|`|KtdlJbrOaa	There are new clinical strength deodorants & antiperspirants on the market.

Good luck to you.  |`|DFh1IRThaa	Food is fuel for the body, consider cleaning up your diet and you won't smell so bad. <br>  There are plenty of deodorants out on the market depending on the degree of odour you produce. <br>  Try a whole body spray; just ensure that you apply only after you've dried off. |`|gxdej2deaa	febreeze yourself<br>  <br>  you can't just stop sweat...it's a bodily response...all you can do is carry some axe or some other body spray with you|`|zjf1volaaa	i donno i heard there is some kinda surgery or somethin for that....or botox injections to help with that or somethin...

vi2bzq0Caa	well, first off, you need to specify what type of conditioner you are using. <br>  secondly, if it is oil-based, don't use it. if you are complaining about "greasy" results, you probably have an oily scalp, which could only mean one thing, you are not getting enough fruits in your diets. <br>  <br>  you are probably eating a lot of green veggies, which is correct, but if you do not put an even balance of fruits and vegetables in your diet, your glands could go into overload. <br>  <br>  try drinking 8-10 glasses of water per day. this will decrease the amount of sweat that your glands produce. <br>  <br>  also, I would try to use a conditioner that is water-based. try Cantu Shea Butter Deep Conditioner. it is for all hair types and it leaves the hair smooth and silky, not to mention, grease-free.<br>  <br>  only leave the conditioner in your hair for five minutes with a plastic cap. rinse it out with almost hot water.<br>  <br>  apply extra virgin olive oil to your ends, only, and blow dry straight. <br>  <br>  this should do the trick!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  |`|UwEEHuRcaa	Try not using it from time to time. |`|5cLZlX30aa	It might be the wrong type of conditioner, it might be too heavy.  I'm sure you're doing this, but make really sure that you're washing it out all the way.  But, maybe you just have an oily scalp and can't use conditioner at all?  I don't know how long your hair is, but try just using conditioner on the ends of your hair, and not putting it on your scalp at all. Or, maybe just try using a spray conditioner on your ends after you get out of the shower.<br>  <br>  Are you using hair products on your hair?  I have a root booster by Big Sexy Hair, and when I use it, by the end of the day my scalp is a little greasy.  The next morning, it's really gross.  That might have something to do with it if you are using things like hair spray, etc.|`|XnEDlScCaa	when u use conditioner it is really meant for your ends of your hair. I would recommend to not put it on the root of your hair because your hair naturally has its own oil so when u add conditioner it tends to make your hair look greasy so. It doesnt matter what conditioner u use just apply every where except for the roots of your hair.|`|SOYpHTAxaa	you may need to switch conditioners. Sounds like the one that you have is too heavy/potent for your hair you could try using less like 2 dime sizes. This has happened to me before but because I loved that particular brand I stuck with it and just used less.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA10993747	You should consider a light weight conditioner that you wash out like dove's
AA10993747	You should use olive oil products... What type of relaxer do you use? May-be your using a product that's too harsh... if you use Olive oil hair polisher before you flat iron your hair it will have a smooth and silky look. I believe in their product, they smell great and helps your hair grow faster... and may-be you should invest in a pair of chi flat irons... the best...|`|PvJQ4SzTaa	why dont you use   TONI&GUY anti frizz shampoo with conditioner i think it will help if you use it frequently |`|BtKJQHQMaa	your hair is over-processed. that is why it is like that<br>  <br>  you need to either start using a "natural relaxer" like curlaway---which you can use with a relaxer in ur head<br>  <br>  or u need to stop using so much heat. <br>  <br>  the same thing happened to me after i got my hair dyed junior year in high school. i had been flat ironing regularly, relaxing regularly and that hair dye was the LAST STRAW for my hair. <br>  <br>  now, i don't use chemicals, virtually no heat (about once a month) and my hair is WONDERFUL. i didn't know i was hiding such a wonderful texture. i've got these wonderful natural loose spirals. it all had to do with the products i was using. before i'd use what my mom bought, which was stuff like vo5 shampoo. once i started using quality products my hair improved<br>  <br>  try profectiv!! the products are a little pricey  $5 per container (medium to small containers) but there is a large container of profectiv for the sam price and it is the best. it lasted me like 3 months. the shampoo and conditioner is great also<br>  <br>  if  u want ur hair to stop breaking off i started taking biotin vitamins. u can get them almost anywhere. mine cost $5. started 3 months ago and my hair is liek 1-2 inches longer.<br>  |`|vi2bzq0Caa	your regimen seems just fine. I just would purchase the FHI flat iron (great), skip the blow dryer and purchase a table top hard bonnet hair dryer and set your hair on snap-on magnetic rollers.<br>  <br>  and purchase this book The Black Woman's Guide to Beautiful Hair. Even if you are not African American, the tips in this book are amazing. Also, check out the follow-up Every Woman's Guide to Beautiful Hair. Someone you know who is elderly could use the tips in this book.<br>  <br>  I stopped relaxing my hair over three years ago, and I have seen significant growth. it is hard to go natural but my results were amazing. I have eleven inches of natural hair as opposed to my seven inches of relaxed hair oh, so many years ago :).<br>  <br>  Wrap your hair at night with a silk or satin scarf. this will maintain the frizz.<br>  <br>  but your problem is....STOP BLOW DRYING! You hair is relaxed. Stop disturbing it.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|qmcZPFiXaa	What I do is wash my hair then I pat it with a towel till it's a little damp. Then I put some oil and leave-in conditioner then I wrap it for the rest of the night (you can ask your stylist how to wrap your hair if you don't know how) The next day use your favorite brand of oil to flat iron your hair and Voila! It's straight and not frizzy.
G9ZTTqxTaa	No. I can guarantee you will just waste your time on that one. <br>  Hair colors CLEARLY have in the instructions: "Do not use this products if you have been proved allergic to any of the ingredients." and the way to prove if you are allergic is BY DOING THE PATCH TEST THAT THEY ALL MENTION...<br>  <br>  People skip this part so many times and it is CRUCIAL to health to find out if you will have a reaction to a hair color before adding it to your whole head...<br>  <br>  Next time sweety...

Para lograr ello es necesario hacer tres comidas y tres colaciones con buenos nutrientes, como proteínas, fibras y calcio. <br>  <br>  Levantarse temprano y tomar un rico desayuno es importante para el éxito de una buena dieta. Pero no todo es sufrimiento, disfrutar de la vida es fundamental. Una salida a la semana hace que tu humor cambie y se mantenga bien. <br>  <br>  Hacer ejercicio es muy importante. Todas las partes del cuerpo deben ejercitarse, así que es necesario que armes un circuito aeróbico para trabajar todos los músculos con un peque?o descanso entre un ejercicio y otro. <br>  No usar tanto la computadora y levantar la cola de la silla del escritorio donde trabajas más seguido también ayudará para que logres una buena figura. Es necesario encontrar las maneras de moverse más y eso quemará las calorías demás. <br>  <br>  Estirar tus piernas también ayudará. Hacer pilates o streching es una buena manera de lograrlo. En caso de que no tengas tiempo de ir a un gimnasio, no olvides hacerlo en tu casa, al salir de la ducha o antes de ir a dormir. <br>  <br>  Salir a correr o nadar es importante para tu salud cardiovascular. Y es recomendable que hacerlo una o dos veces por semana, aunque sea en peque?as sesiones. Los abdominales solos no sirven porque sólo tonifican los músculos, pero no quitan las grasas.<br>  <br>  Los masajes también son recomendables. Hacer sesiones de masoterapia para complementar los ejercicios es una buena idea, principalmente para quitar la adiposidad instalada entre la piel y el músculo. <br>  <br>  Y nunca olvides incorporar a tu dieta abundantes frutas y verduras (preferentemente sin cáscara). Evitar el exceso de hidratos de carbono (cereales, papas, choclo, batatas, pastas, arroz, pan, galletitas), que pueden distender el abdomen. <br>  <br>  |`|cCrTnX36aa	caminar caminar caminar y caminar o trotar da lo mismo

I would go ahead and buy it and give it a try. |`|WHxqO6NEaa	Kimmy, go back to Sally's and tell them you want a gold TONER.  They have one that is just like pure gold, I can't remember the actual color name, but if you look at the toners, you'll see one of the sample color swatches is like PURE gold!  It looks really pretty on highlights.
46K4FtE0aa	My daughter swears by taking sea kelp tablets every day, available from any health shop. It strengthens the hair and helps it grow much faster. Also when you wash it, use a good conditioner and don't use a fine comb to go through it, use a wide tooth comb and be gentle. Avoid hair dryers if you can, but if you must use one, use a heat defence spray on your hair before you dry it, at the first sign of split ends, go to a salon and ask them just to take the split ends off, if you ignore the beginning of split ends, you will need much more cut off to get rid of them. Hope that helped.|`|AA10993747	Taking multivitamins are good for the hair, nails, and skin... and a good shampoo and conditioner like dove.|`|TRhcubpNaa	hey<br>  <br>  you need lots of natural remedies example milk.

tePZAxV7aa	If your reaction was very minimal, why don't you try re-testing applying the mix exactly as you did the last time, but, this time, add a little sweet and low to the mixture.  I use this at work on some of my clients that are sensitive with great success.  I don't know why this works, but it does.  If you still have a reaction, try another brand.  If your skin feels fine, mix a full serving of the sweetener in with your color.|`|7HACHSWZaa	It's pretty normal for it to turn red, my skin always turns a little red when i do the allergy test but when i use it in my hair, no problem! if you're really concerned try a brand you have already used?|`|AA10993747	If it's not burning or an uncontrollable itch I wouldn't worry about it.

2c556debd7c1c18834aeac39fbfe496caa	My mother was a hair dresser..She was taught you only need conditioners if you blow dry your hair , have damaged hair, permed or dyed hair or wash your hair everyday..Washing your hair everyday takes the natural oils from it leaving it too dry.If you don't blow dry it, wash it every other day and have no split ends then you don't need conditioner.If you have permed or dyed your hair then you need only apply after doing so and then only if you wash or blow dry every day.|`|IzHkb1neaa	No|`|gHha8OPeaa	There are many different types of hair from dry, oily, fine, thick, and normal.  It is hard to find the best products to use on one persons hair as hair can change through out their lives.  Most of us will find that the conditioner, the water, or our hair changes and therefore we are always trying to find the best product.  For those who do not believe they need hair conditioners they are very wrong.<br>  <br>  First of all hair conditioners replace the moisture and protein we have in our hair that the shampoo will strip away.  Weather is also another common element that can damage hair.  The sunshine can dry out even the oiliest of hair to make it brittle.  Those with longer hair tend to have dry ends that will split often if not taken proper care of.  This is why hair conditioners are important and why we need them.<br>  <br>  There are once a week or once a month conditioners that you can apply to your hair.  These are usually leave in conditioners that require a little heat to open up the hairs pores.  They often allow for proteins and other nutrients to enter the hair and make it look healthier and lush. Everyday conditioners should be for the type of hair you have.  If you have oily hair and find that your hair needs to be washed at least once a day or more than chances are you are using the wrong conditioner or that you don’t need to condition your hair near the scalp.  Most of us with oily hair tend to conditioner the longer strands, but avoid the hair closer to the scalp as it has enough moisture.|`|VemHKmkmaa	yes. Conditioner doesn't just hydrate your hair. it hydrates your scalp. It prevents dandruff and also provides few proteins,vitamin etc. that shampoos are unable to. it also helps your hair smell nice.|`|MOzgS8dOaa	Well if your shampoo is that good, you really don't need it.<br>  But it does make it softer and easier to comb through.<br>  So it's really your decision.<br>  :)|`|KtdlJbrOaa	I'm not a hairdresser, but if I DON'T use conditioner, I can tell a difference.  |`|6e7b5167fcb0c8c9154ed95863d10e0baa	of course you need it!

Dark circles under eyes usually are temporary and not a medical concern.<br>  <br>  You may be surprised to learn that fatigue usually isn't the cause of dark circles. Instead, the most common cause is nasal congestion. When your nose is congested, veins that usually drain from your eyes into your nose become widened (dilated) and darker.<br>  <br>  Another cause of undereye circles is eyelid swelling during sleep. When you lie down, gravity can cause fluid to collect in your lower eyelids. This swelling may create the appearance of shadows below your eyes. In addition, dark circles can result from chronic skin conditions, such as atopic eczema. Dark circles can also run in families.<br>  <br>  Over-the-counter products may help diminish dark circles under eyes. Look for skin creams that contain vitamin C or K, alpha hydroxy acid and kinetin. Treatment for chronic and severe under eye circles is directed at the underlying cause, if known, and may include bleaching agents and laser therapy.|`|9a1901b64759c6de3c15bd8884927a46aa	Get atleast 8 hrs sleep a day<br>  Drink atleast 4L water/day<br>  <br>  Use Vit E supplements aka beauty vitamin|`|BcJN6YQOaa	get more sleep.

qnlaIf83aa	Considering your hair is already blonde the consequences wont be as harsh as if it were darker but will still affect you. your hair will become more brittle, you'll get more split ends and need to use toner in order to prevent it from going yellow. you can obv help minimise the damage by changing your conditioner to a higher strength one, maybe even starting to use leave ins. |`|8Y583Fluaa	u want the truth...u would look fake...bleaching sucks...anyways i told u what u didnt want tohear but i told the truth...ill take the 10 points since i am desperate for points since i just got the boot for telling people the truth|`|bgiGu0Y9aa	Well, it might some out bad...like if they actidentally use chorine or something it might turn green.....<br>  <br>  ......but it'll most likely come out good. :D|`|fmZiFipmaa	Bleach is really bad for your hair, and it will take a long time to getting it back to looking healthy.

a0gURrRXaa	since you're using those, which I believe are semi permanent, then you will need to bleach first. <br>  <br>  Pravana's brights can be used as permanent colors, which will lighten as they deposit, so no need to bleach. You can only get these at professional wholesalers though so you would need to call around to find a salon that carries this line.<br>  <br>  Since you're wanting to do it at home, though.... I suggest getting a bleach kit at sallys, and then also getting Manic Panic colors, they last longer and are much more vivid then the ones at hot topic (if I'm remembering correctly. I don't know if they changed what they carry at hot topic...)<br>  <br>  I've done the same to my hair, bleach first, then color with these (they have BEAUTIFUL colors and they can last a month) I did a bright fuchsia and i really turned heads in high school for it. <br>  <br>  Don't leave the bleach on for more than 30 minutes, and it doesn't have to be white, or even blonde, to work. <br>  <br>  The colors will not show up at all if you don't bleach first.|`|g2VCzUKoaa	if you bleach your hair the colors will show more.<br>  since your hair is black that Hot Topic stuff isnt gonna work that well<br>  trust me. but i never tried it bleached before, and remember you can always bleach your hair back to your natural. <br>  <br>  If you hair is Dry dont do anything but condition your hair for awhile.<br>  and when i mean by dry like hair is all flakey at the top and you have split ends and it looks like you have done alot to your hair. <br>  <br>  But if your hair is in Good Health Go Ahead and Bleach it. it wont harm your hair and the colors will turn out nicely(:|`|CTSSCCrqaa	You have to bleach your hair, I dyed my hair purple from Hot Topic and it doesn't show up on black hair, you must bleach it first. and if you don't bleach it, it won't show up.|`|mMGQCGMsaa	If you don't bleach it first, the blue or purple dye might show up a bit as a tint over your dark hair; but it will look much bluer/purpler if you bleach it first.|`|1Zw1KoNqaa	yes, you should bleach it, if you dont it probably wont turn out very well, like hard to tell that it is blue or purple|`|BoEur609aa	yes you do if you want it a bright solid purple =)<br>  my friend does it all the time and she has to bleach it|`|1268444ad4be2f392994468b89a81d40aa	It all depends on the color shade. If you want Lily purple ( very light) then definatley bleach it first. If you want a darker shade though you should be fine. Hope this helps and your hair turns out well!! :-) !

AA12107610	my ex and one of my husband's friends had grafts done.  they do take a section of your hair from the back of your head and transplant it to the thinning areas.  my suggestion is NOT to do it.  the scar on the back of your head will be visible, and if you continue to have thinning hair, you will have to have the procedure done again.  my ex said he wished he didn't do it because now if he wants to shave his head (which i think looks good), he can't because of the unsightly scar.|`|AA10923152	I'm 25 and losing my hair too.

If you didn't know, you wouldn't know. I know there are levels that you can get from less hair to thicker. He got less hair put on top because it was cheaper and if you look close enough you can see but he said with the more expensive more dense one you can't tell even up close.

That would determine the base (how you braid your own hair) underneath the weave, after you decide that and get your braids in, the rest is a piece of cake. I've done my own weaves since 1987.  If you can braid and sew, you can weave! Just don't use glue, it tears your hair up, and also is not good for your scalp.|`|AA11712072	it is probably on the africanamerican.com check there

Colores como el azul marino, café oscuro, o negro en el pantalón pueden tener un efecto adelgazador, los colores claros en la blusa pueden contribuir a que luzcas una mejor figura.<br>  Saludos!|`|cbb3a74c9e07826c951da32c8fe21ccfaa	pues el negro te hace ver un poco mas delgado los colores como rojo azul rey y amarillo te hacer ver mas llenita|`|ed7c115b532691532e6aeddf06e8a20caa	El color negro, ahroa cmo dice la amiga anterior, el negro engorda pero ese es otro negro.<br>  jajajaa|`|24iG67Wwaa	el negro favorese a todas y lomnejor seria ponerte una cintita  por ejemplo roja por abajo del busto<br>  <br>  y lo que no debes ponerte son estampados muy grandes   colores muy chillones en ambas partes ( remera y pantalon)|`|3WHfmqKKaa	el negro es lo k te hace delgada cosa k el blanco no,y procura llevar ropa ajustada y colores oscuros.|`|A4PCXuGYaa	todo color oscuro adelgaza<br>  marron oscuro<br>  azul oscuro<br>  negro<br>  <br>  ayuda mucho a estilizar ponerte por ejemplo,<br>  una remera blanca y arriba una marron oscura<br>  (que se vea un poco de la remera blanca)<br>  esto lo q hace es alargar tu forma de cintura<br>  <br>  NO USES NADA CON LINEAS HORIZONTALES <br>  NI CON ESTAMPADOS<br>  ya q engordan un monton<br>  <br>  evita los colores claritos<br>  ya q crean volumen y ensancha mas tu cuerpo<br>  <br>  q tengas mucha suerte amiga|`|TKEMvRQxaa	Hola!!<br>  Querida amiga, si eres llenita, evita usar ropa a cuadros o que tengan lineas, usa colores planos, evita los estampados, el negro es un color perfecto, disimular los gorditos, el cabello, recogido da ilumina el rostro hace q tu cara se vea más delgada, y lo más importante, cuando te mires al espejo, ve q eres linda, gordita, flakita, tu eres especial y sobre todo liunda, creételo|`|ZFQNu1FPaa	no sé que ropa, pienso que el negro.<br>  pero sé que puedes colocarte ropa con lineas verticales.<br>  nunca para el otro lado, eso te hace ver mas llenita<br>  un beso|`|hLOZWUSuaa	obviamente, los colores mas oscuros te hacen ver mas delgada, al igual que las rayas en vertical<br>  el negro con otro color es la mejor opcion<br>  otro cosa, pantalones no de tan tiro corto, asi retienen la panza|`|il4pOqFCaa	Debes usar colores oscuros... por que estos esconden...<br>  los colores claros son los que resaltan...<br>  Asi que deberias ponerte osuro en las areas que no te interesa resaltar y claros en tus atributos!!!!<br>  Ahh!!! se me olvidaba los estampados  son de lo peor para la gente rellenita!!!|`|zYAoeNOxaa	cuanto mas oscuro mas disimula y cuanto mas claro mas aumenta.<br>  <br>  es simple.<br>  <br>  aunq no podes aparentar algo muy distinto a lo que sos mejor baja de peso correctamente y no vas a tener problemas(eso hice yo)|`|It6EvNBSaa	te hacen ver mas delgada los colores oscuros, por ejemplo el negro, el marrón, el verde oscuro, el azul oscuro, si eres rellenita, no te pongas ropa con rayas, ni de cuadritos|`|M5HXJoSSaa	negro! hace q todos se vean mas delgados....no uses colores claros (blanco)|`|MOENh5aMaa	obvio que el color negro te hace ver mas delgada y estilizada...|`|S9KpdrB9aa	negro y lineas|`|WwWe0XdLaa	el negro amiga.|`|b1XiM2TKaa	los colores que te hacen verte mas delgada son los tonos oscuros, prueba con ellos, usa cuellos en v, evita los cuellos redodos por que estos te aran lucir un poco mas redondita,tmb evita usar ropa rayada horizontalmente eso nos hace lucir mas anchitas, por el contrario si usas ropa rayada verticalmente ( osea rayas para abajo) te ara licur mas esbelta y alta.. usa ropa que cubra tus brazos y de preferencia blusas largas <br>  <br>  <br>  ;)|`|e1cf56ac83f83e303ccb21e313531853aa	el negro hace mas delgada y las rayas mas gordita.|`|gFS0NX8uaa	mira.. soy hombre pero lo se por k una ves me lo dijeron... y lo volvi a leer en una revista de mens health, decia k los colores oscuros te hacen  ver mas delgdo y los claros mas "amplio" asi k si eres de caderas amplias usa pantalon negro y blusa blanca, tampoko vistas toda de negro si eres llenita,  pero lo importante no es como te vistas, si no como te sientes contigo misma...|`|p0aCGXxXaa	evita los lunares y las lineas horizontales...|`|pij0kumZaa	usa el negro..<br>  <br>  evita colores claros..tipo beige!<br>  <br>  <br>  besos
1BPQBl3saa	Ptosis refers to the drooping of an eyelid, and it affects only the upper eyelid of one or both eyes. The droop may be barely noticeable, or the lid can descend over the entire pupil. Ptosis can occur in both children and adults, but happens most often due to aging.<br>  <br>  Ptosis can look similar to dermatochalasis, a group of connective tissue diseases that cause skin to hang in folds. These diseases are associated with less-than-normal elastic tissue formation. Your eye doctor should be able to tell whether or not this is the cause of your drooping eyelids.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sooo, I think you should see an eye care professional about this just in case.|`|mJpyyZZeaa	yea, go to the doctor!|`|6jQ7MbWHaa	wow that is really strange.

Losing weight quickly is a bad idea health-wise and you're less likely to keep it off. If you try for 3 lbs or so per week, you can still reach your goal, but don't go crazy. Try exercising because muscle will burn calories while you're asleep. Eat healthy and try to cut out empty calories such as many softdrinks.|`|QoZ6aOTFaa	this is how i went from a size 8 to 0 (i'm short in case the readers think i have a eating disorder)<br>  only drink water and tea <br>  be aware of calories<br>  don't eat junk food<br>  stop eating meat (contains alot of fat+have you seen how the animals are killed)<br>  exercise,remember muscle weighs more then fat so take your measurements to keep track of progress, learn the heights and measurements of celebrities you admire so you get a realistic view of yourself<br>  eat but healthy and don't snack it helps to remember gluttony is a sin<br>  make sure that you get the body YOU and no one else are truely happy with(as long as it's pysically possible) you should not feel uncomfortable in your skin besides beauty is in the eye of the beholder.|`|Z0dXXQKhaa	LOSING WEIGHT IS EASY. But you HAVE to do it the right way. Don't starve yourself, instead learn how to eat only when you're hungry. A lot of people eat without realizing that they aren't really hungry, when your stomach growls, you're hungry, if you just have a craving from something...you're not. When you are hungry, eat as much as you want! Just eat healthy foods that won't be stored as fat, such as salads, fruits, wheats, granola, etc. Nothing too fattening like 8 cookies or something. To lose weight, do SOME sort of exercise for 40 minutes a day, to maintain, you only need 30. Hope this helped!<br>  <br>  OH YEAH - and drinking lots of water is good for you, 8 glasses a day will help you lose weight...if that seems like too much, just drink as much as you possibly can!|`|0SMmj1uLaa	The best advice I can give is not to set weight goals, they are deceptive.  Instead choose visual goals or physical goals.  If you want to wear a size 4, let that be your goal, if you want to stop that little bit of jiggle on the bottom of your arm, let that be your goal.<br>  <br>  Setting a weight goal doesn't emphasize how much body fat is lost as opposed to muscle tone.  Women naturally have a higher percentage of body fat than men, it's to protect your bodies when you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  That being said a good diet not too high in fat is good.  Always allow yourself a little room to wiggle now and then.  The majority of people that fail at diets fail because they don't allow themselves to have the dessert or dinner they really want.  You can eat a lot of stuff, just remember moderation.<br>  <br>  As for exercise, light cardio for extended periods.  A brisk walk for 30-45 minutes, the elliptical trainer, and things that are low impact will work well.  There are so many things to try and do, just do some research, find what works best for you in a HEALTHY way and go for it.  <br>  <br>  Note: Crash dieting is UNSAFE, it's highly unrecommended and many people that do it end up putting on even more weight once they fall off the diet.|`|7335bd4188560963b07e85252e7161cdaa	Do not crash diet. Start exercising as much as you can. Set a goal for yourself, and think up of what you will eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the week. Try to eat less fatty food such as french fries, and burgers. Also, try not to snack too much. Organize snacks in little zip lock bags, in small portions. Allow yourself to have 1 or 2 snacks a day. Good Luck!|`|AA10100909	Fact from fiction, truth from diction. When I found myself much fatter than I wanted to be(looked doen and could not see my toes)I wanted to shed the mass. I did not know crap about dieting other than I know what food I like, and I was not going to give them up. So, a diet would not work. BUT, what I could do is change the way I ate. Instead of wolfing down three scoops of mashed potatoes, I had only one. Instead of the usual 2 rolls, 3/4 of one, etc. I also swapped out healthier choices when I could, sobe or frozen yogurt for ice cream. Multi-grain breads for regular, And eat slowly and CHEW. The more you chew each bit the earlier you will feel full. <br>  <br>  There is more but space is short. So, we have to move on the what you can do physically. GET OF YOUR A**. If you have erands to run around town, the ones that are in a general of each other. Park the car in a central location and WALK to them. I started with 1/2 mile. then 1 mile, then two. Also throw in some strength training with weights. If you can do in the evening after dinner weights speed up the metabolism and continue to do so up to TWO HOURS AFTER you have stopped. And it burns calories. You may not seem to lose much standing on the scale. But the weight you will have will be lean curvy muscle(no, you will not have bulging mucles like a man. You don't have the right hormones or be working out 6 hours or more everyday) Have "TV rope night". Get a jump rope. The 1st commercial break, jump rope through it. The second break, jump every other commercial. Then the 3rd break jump through all of it again. Then do some road work on a bike. In about 10 to twelve week you will be less and turning heads(if you also do smarter eating choices) I went from "Potato pouch Pete" to being told I had the best physique of all the males of any age in the apartment complex I lived in at the time. It is not WHAT you eat, as much as WHAT you KEEP. Treat your calories like a bank account. You spend more than you are putting in, you go broke. Keep spending, you owe. You want to spend ALL your available calories and go in to the "piggy bank" your fat cells.|`|01f4f3e96199ce8104382a464861443caa	i lost about 5 pounds per week by eating special k in the morning,<br>  eating a saled with light dressing for lunch<br>  and eating a saled with specal k snack bar for Dinner, o ya with some fruit<br>  <br>  theres also exercise you need to do, like running, do that for 5 minutes everyday for a week then work up 10 minutes the next week, do the same with crunches and puchups, and i garontee you will loose wieght!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck and god bless!!|`|1qnfWPW2aa	I bought the "South Beach Diet" book after I had my baby because I could not lose weight and I was desperate.  (Just to let you know I am NOT the type of person to do any kind of dieting-- never really had to until this point in my life)  I lost 14 pounds in the first 2 weeks  ( you can not eat any sugar, fruit, or really any kind of carb) The next two weeks you add in fruit and when you finally get to the weight you want to be at you can start eating more normal and if you gain a pound or two-- just don't eat carbs for a day.  I am probably not explaing this very well so get the book.  It worked great for me.  The first two weeks about killed me because I am a junk food junkie, but it has been sooooo worth it  This was 3 years ago and I have not gained any of the weight back AND I eat what I want.  Hope this helps!|`|Krc6UdLKaa	you exercise and run or do track|`|X9wvXxBeaa	I like the weight watchers diet. I lost 10 pounds within 2 months but i did cheat a lot.when i first started i lost 8 pounds in 2 weeks but then i started to eat like i did and i noticed i started to gain it back but it was easy to get back on track. If you are really committed you can loose weight on this diet. What i did was eat all weight watchers dinners found in local grocery stores, I ate them for lunch and dinner. If you go onto the Weight watchers web site you can get free recipes. The higher the fiber the better for you. Drink lots of water. Don't eat white bread eat whole grain whole wheat. If you like chips you can eat the Light Lays, don't eat the baked they aren't that good for you, the light is better and they don't taste bad either. They do sell Weight Watchers ice cream, breads, muffins and cakes in the grocery store. If you can find a meeting near you then i suggest you join to get all the materials, once you have the materials its easy to maintain it yourself.

Lo mejor es utilizar agua, mucha agua.|`|jUvDoFKSaa	me a pasado varias veces en la cocina y te digo que son horrorosas si no la sabes cuidar , primero que todo ponte esas crema y que no sea en el día y cuando salgas al sol que no te de por que el sol las oscurece y se quedan horribles a mi me quedaron pero blancas y no se nota nada .

Dq1Gj6Cjaa	It sounds like part of you might have a mental attachment to showering and washing your hair at the same time.  I would try and pay attention to how your hair feels after you work out and have cooled down to room temperature.  If it still feels overly oily, then I'd wash it.  But if you think it isn't oily, then try going a day and see how you feel.  I'm not sure wetting the hair without washing it would really do much to help (though it certainly wouldn't hurt).<br>  <br>  When I did sports and was concerned about my hair, I found it helpful to part my hair in the center and wear pigtails instead of just one ponytail when working out.  I felt like my scalp could breathe better, causing me to sweat less and allowing what sweat I did produce to evaporate more quickly.<br>  <br>  Also - If your hair smells stale (like if some of your friends smoke around you) or sweaty but you don't want to wash your hair right then, there is a product that you can try called Dry Clean Only - <a href="http://www.stuff4beauty.com/page/sebastian_dry_clean_only.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stuff4beauty.com/page/sebasti...</a><br>  Note that it won't do much for oiliness, but will help with scent.|`|YAdvURSVaa	It's not very good to wash your hair everyday because it gets dry, try using a very use conditioner to make up for washing it everyday, if you wet it you might as well just wash it so go for it.

SDHvDNGJaa	No lo sabía, pero suena interesante, vean la información que encontré, segun ella la yerba mate es como el te verde, tiene antioxidantes, vitaminas como la B1, B2, riboflavina, tiene un componente la mateina que es estimulante como la cafeina.<br>  La yerba mate produce  cambios  de la  conducta, y a la vez incrementan la energìa , la vitalidad, y  la capacidad de concentración, reducen el nerviosismo e incrementan la resistencia a la fatiga mental y física. Es recomendable para combatir la depresión. Provee además de minerales al cuerpo, tal como potasio, sodio y magnesio, la yerba mate retarda la acumulación de ácido láctico en los músculos.

SxcRIVcMaa	what i do to make my hair a little loser is first of all, when you're in the shower let your conditioner set for awhile to make your hair loosen up. second, when you get out towel dry your hair but make sure it is still pretty wet. Then apply gel and style as you would like. If you are going for loose waves blow dry on low if you want them to be kind of more curly then let it air dry. As you blow dry scrunch and adjust as you want so as to attain the perfect style. Hope this helped =]|`|526cc5ae1dd04bfae6a171798520ea09aa	use gel<br>  i suggest garnier fruitise wet shine gel<br>  instructions are on the back of the bottle|`|F1lrUp7Taa	I would use gel and scrunch my hair with my hands.

vpx2mdV5aa	Have you considered the possibility of chiggers?  Have you been outdoors recently?  Those tiny buggers can get in the most intimate spaces!  It could even be mosquitoes - it's amazing what they can sting through!<br>  <br>  Other things to consider are fleas (have any pets--or any rodents in your home?), and the awful bed bug.  Usually when you have spider bites, you just have one or two bites.<br>  <br>  Until you identify the bug, you can't know how to get rid of them.  It might even be the detergent you use on your clothes!<br>  <br>  I would suggest thoroughly washing everything in hot water.  Use some caladryl lotion or campho-phenique to ease the itching.  Take the hottest shower you can stand before going to bed - that will cause the bites to release the histamines which cause the itching, thus allowing you to sleep better.<br>  <br>  If the "bites" aren't itching, they very well could be staph infections, and can get really painful and pustulant.  I would definitely see a doctor for that - no matter how broke you are!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10949601	it sounds like the spiders like to eat you (hehe) just kidding, go to your local pharacist and ask them for a special ointmen,t, if it gets really serious you should go to the doctors.|`|p8w8Ycrjaa	it sounds like insect bites, go to the store and get a cream for insect bites and see how that works out - get something to get rid of the bugs through your house too|`|1BPQBl3saa	this could be just an allergic reaction, most popularly "hives" if they look like large mosquito bites and itch or burn, that is most likely what they are. you could try just a topical itch cream or benadryl.|`|3CjQOtLFaa	ADS|`|mDIFI56saa	I thought I had spider bites.

8GLtJvDdaa	really condition your hair, get a high moisture creme rinse. only use it on the ends|`|0b13e413e5bbbd887f19873f0cb65be7aa	dont use so much products and starightning it can damage so much so yeah|`|4c3f23b76602ed30e281b6cbb0b13d96aa	Fast growing hair? You're lucky!<br>  I've had the same problem with splits.<br>  <br>  Have you tried deep conditioning your hair? You can get it done at a salon for best results.  Or, just buy some deep conditioning conditioner (I suggest Pantene, Sunsilk, got2b, or John Freda) and leave it in your hair after shampooing overnight (you can leave your hair in a shower cap too).  Or, leave it on for a couple of hours under a shower cap.  Your hair will feel so silky after, and if you get restorative and preventative conditioner treatments, you can get some good results. <br>  <br>  Also, do you blow dry your hair?  Try not to: let it air dry overnight.  But, if you're going to blow dry, when you comb as you dry, do NOT touch the nozzle of the blow dryer to your tresses.  That is one of the number one causes of split ends.  Also, do you straighten your hair? Be sure to use a protective flat iron spray first (Herbal Essences makes a cheap one, but I'm not sure how good their product is; currently, I use Charles Worthington).  Spray each strand before you straighten.<br>  <br>  If your hair is colour treated, I would definitely use a shampoo that is strictly meant for colour-treated hair, and not for "volume" or some other feature.  That will the stop the cycle of your splits for coloured hair very much.  Good luck!|`|MMbs0L2Zaa	i use some great repair stuff, try for some thing like that|`|aoX09vgnaa	Try Tresseme anti-breakage shampoo and conditioner.

CgElH9g9aa	en lo personal me gusta mas el estilo de shaquira, su  movimiento de caderas y timbre de voz es lo que hace su estilo original<br>  =0)a.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Shakira, es original, bella y muy sensual.|`|KLkjAcPPaa	Beyonce.|`|785a093d885cf5ac2f1b476c7e2a3cddaa	A mi me parece que cada quien tiene su estilo y lugar dentro de la musica. Saludos!|`|9klTExWeaa	Shakira, canta, baila, compone sus canciones, y es excelente!!<br>  Beyonce baila, shakira la ense?ó a bailar para el video de Beautiful Liar,<br>  Fergie, canta pero no compone, así que diría que:<br>  SHAKIRA, es todo en una!!!|`|cGbcdgabaa	Beyonce, su forma de vestir, la forma de actuar en un ecenario, la forma en la que habla, la mirada,la forma en que camina, su bronceado perfecto, y la sencilles  me enknta|`|Qice0d2Waa	hayyy shakira a fullllllll....<br>  es lo mas ...y si ke me encanta su estilo..<br>  besos<br>  oooshirleyooo|`|RUEFiexsaa	shakira..<br>  <a href="http://misfamosos.es.tl" rel="nofollow">http://misfamosos.es.tl</a>|`|i1D5Rdd5aa	Pues las tres son muy buenas cantantes pero para que Shakira pues porquebuno es una cantante con gran fama mundial pero tambien no se te olvide que "Shakira" ya tiene (que Yo se) un disco con algunos de sus muchos exitos enespa?ol, pero "Fergie" o "Beyonce" tiene algun disco en cualquier otro idioma (segun Yo se) no verdad. Ay tambien "Shakira" tiene un concierto completamente en Ingles.<br>  !!!lo que preguntaste segun Yo es una pregunta muy personal???|`|iIRruc0Iaa	shakira|`|kM0mBrpxaa	me gusta como viste fergie|`|kVrAoU3maa	Son diferentes me gusta mas beyonce es como mas de ciudad e independiente fergie es la glamorosa rica y shakira es como exotica y de pueblo|`|nv5uIlaSaa	es claro que shakira si no no hablarian de ella en los espectaculo a cada rato|`|ox5BSdQ3aa	Hemm... hoy tengo ganas de responder este tipo de preguntas jaja!<br>  <br>  Hem... kreo ke Shakira esta muy en la onda hippie! sencilla, cómoda, pero a veces se ve un poco desarreglada, por lo mismo que no usa maquillaje la mayoria del tiempo y el cabello lo trae suelto y medio quebrado, ademas de ese rubio forzado... eso no le quita en nada que tiene mucho talento, buenisima voz y que me gustan mucho sus canciones.<br>  <br>  Beyonce... mmm la chika es muy guapa, los hombres la adoran, y canta lindo, ademas de que saca canciones con muy buen ritmo y bastante pegajosas, sin embargo rihanna ya la desbanco jejee. Creo que desde que salio de destinys child dejó de sacarle jugo a su voz, ahora canta cosas muy por debajo de lo que podria cantar, canta pss.. bieen, pero se enfoca más en verse sensual  y no es de mis favoritas la verdad.<br>  <br>  Fergie.... esta se?ora si es una de mis favoritas, tiene una voz preciosa, yo la primera vez que la escuché pensé que era afroamericana la verdad, excelente ritmo, saca canciones bien pegajosas, y hasta su estilo para vestir me gusta, se ve cómoda sin verse descuidada o fodonga como derrepente luce shakira, baila super bien y me refiero a baile en general, no solo a mover las caderas ... además con el grupo black eyed peas hace una combinacion bieen buena, y encima adora México... que más puedo decir .|`|pk0boQ62aa	yo diria que shaquira|`|slvC36i8aa	esta entre fergie y beyonce pero claro gana fergie por que tiene mucho glamour para vestirse y para cantar|`|tR2VTL0Paa	shakira definitivamente, las demas son puro plástico|`|vXfSd5qnaa	NO ME AGRADA NINGUNA DE LAS 3!
