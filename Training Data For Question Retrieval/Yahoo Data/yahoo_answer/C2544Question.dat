20090220134203AAQJ5lC	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Should I purchase my new car in CA (Los Angeles) or FL (Miami)?	im graduating college this june and plan on moving to miami to be near family/the beautiful weather/beaches/etc. one of my goals right after graduation is to make my first vehicle purchase. i'm looking to buy either an '07-'09 nissan sentra (sl trim), '06-'09 honda accord (ex, ex-l trm), '07-'09 toyota camry or corolla, or an '07-09 nissan maxima. i dont mind driving a somewhat used car (preferably less than 50,000 miles) because i'm hoping to keep my payments low (under $200 -not including insurance).      i have a family friend visiting from florida and he tells me that i should hold off on purchasing the car in CA (los angeles) and get it over there because the price of the car will be cheaper and so will the taxes and registration fees. However, i kind of would like to move already having some mode of transportation (i would drive the car there) and knowing what my payments are going to be. I looked around the fl dmv site and I'm still not sure how much it would be to transfer the title and registration stuff from ca to fl. any suggestions or information about  this would be much appreciated! thanks!

When ever you accelerate to pass a car or merge into traffic, the car does not respond and it always jerks.  It seems like you were pressing the brakes instead of the accelerator. It works fine as long as you drive it like you were 160 years old and never press the gas. You have to go real slow and pick up speed real slow all the time. Like you cant pass cars anymore because it will jerk every time you press the gas hard. It also does this more when ever its cold.

20090220151133AAecjhe	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Car wont start?????!!!!!?	-I have a 1995 Chevy Suburban 4WD K1500   -It has a 350ci   -Engine was rebuilt a while ago. (Maybe 3 to 4 yrs ago.)   -Starter was replaced around then too.   -Battery is a Titanium (Motorcraft)              I just had it on our motorcycle charger all night last night and it said it was fuly charged.   -I tried it about 10 minutes ago. Everything comes on such as the lights....radio...anything. Bt when I turn the key to crank over the engine it doesnt even try to crank. There is absolutely no attempt to. This isnt the first time this has happened. A couple weeks ago it did the same thing on me. We had come to the conclusion that when I get u on a cold morning and start the car, play the radio, and use the heat and my headlights, the battery doesnthave time to charge any due to my short trip to school after almost every power source was used. We waited over night when it had stopped (the outside temp. had warmed up a little bit) and in the morning we went over to start it and it worked. remember that was a couple weeks ago. The night when it shut off a couple weeks ago we trid to jump it with my friends 2000 Pontiac Grand Prix, but it was a failure.       Anyways, the connections are now tight on the battery trminals. They weren't too tight before, but yet it still started. So yeah, they are tight now, but it still will not start.       When it did start the starter did perfectly fine. So it cant be it. I check the connection on the starter and it seemed pretty tight also. I hit the starter with a hammer too. It did no help.      I am so confused as of now.      I am hoping it's just a new battery that is needed. If not and it is easier to fix please tell me. if you have anymore questions just ask. I believe I have told everything, but I may be forgetting something. Thanks for your time. I appreciate it.

20090220144033AAcKVTP	Cars & Transportation;Commuting	Charging drivers for every mile they drive?  Isn't this a little extreme?	There is a story on Yahoo! that there is talk of states charging motorist one quarter of a penny for every mile they drive.  Supposedly gas stations aren't making enough on fuel taxes and this is a way to supplement that income.        So, you work 16 miles from your house.  That means it will cost you 4 cents to go to work.  It will then cost you 4 cents to get home from work.  Let's say you work 5 days a week and only drive to and from work every work day for a year.  That means you will have to pay $20.80 to go to work.      I understand that $20.00 isn't a lot of money, however with more people losing their jobs, and prices as a whole are increasing, as well as the cost of living increasing without seeing a pay increase.      Doesn't this seem crazy?

The terminals on the starter have been wire brushed and cleaned the best I could. If I remove the the starter leads the red is always hot but the only way to get the ground is to jump the relay. Also there is no real way to try to jump the terminals on the starter due to the location (I had to remove the battery and shelf just to see starter)

Last night while I was driving home, someone pointed out to me that the tail lights were not working. This morning I replaced most of the fuses, and got the stereo to work, the annoying door ding, and the interior lights to work, but the tail lights remained off. We had an issue with the dash lights when I bought it, but I replaced that fuse and they work just fine still. The headlights are also functioning.    Also, this vehicle was involved in an accident that took out most of the windshield and some things in the engine compartment. Everything was replaced, and fixed, but I thought I would put that out there.

Well, everything seemed quiet and running smooth until yesterday when I noticed the lights on the dash were dim and then, sure enough, the car stops in the middle of nowhere. We jumped it, went and had the alternator tested, and it is bad AGAIN!       I don't think I can take this any more. I don't feel safe driving and don't trust this issue. Our van has never had any other problems...      Does anyone know what could be causing this? Or could it just be bad alternator luck?
