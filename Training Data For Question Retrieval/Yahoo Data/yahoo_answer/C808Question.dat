20080707102104AAPVwHg	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	What could I use as a sugar substitute for baking?	I am an extreme low carb. dieter, and a health nut.  I don't want to use any type of artificial sweetener, or anything sweet.  I'm trying to come up with a low carb. peanut butter snack that has the texture of a peanut butter cookie, but unsweetened.  The flourless peanut butter cookie recipes I've found is what gave me the idea.  But, they all use sugar, or a sugar substitute that's no good for your health.  I just want something to use in place of the sugar, for the right texture......  I tried making the flourless peanut butter cookies, without any sugar at all (just organic valencia peanut butter, one cage free organic egg, some walnuts some vanilla, and cinnamon).  The dough wasn't bad.  The egg made it hold together really well.  It was a little dry/crumbly though, so I added a little oil.  Anyway, the biggest problem I was having, was getting the dough to spread while baking.  The doughballs never spread out!  So, I added a little more oil, and they still didn't spread.  help!
