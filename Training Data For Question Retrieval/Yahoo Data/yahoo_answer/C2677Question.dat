20090220072927AAbHDBI	Pets;Cats	Do you think that I should get a kitten? (Honest answers only)?	i am an 18 years old girl who goes to college, I stay at home with my mum and my brother, my mum works full time, im not a clubbing or partying sort of girl, I would much rather sit at home with my kitten/cat, read a book and just spend time with him/her.   I used to have a cat back in norway where i use to live but moved to the uk. Im not sure if i should get a kitten or not because       1) Im out at college from 9 til 1, 5 times a week   2) Live with my mum and she wants nothing to do with it lol (she was like this with my last cat, she usually learns to love him/her)   3) Have a little brother at home but he knows how to treat the kitty   4) Do not work but get ￡20 a week from my father in norway (uk)   5) Cannot get 2 kittens because i promised the landlord only 1   6) I dont want an adult cat bcause I want to raise it      But      1) I have my own room   2) Im super loving and love to give my kitten attention and love to play with him/her   3) Im caring      I really want a kitten but only if I know that I can give it what it needs. What do you think? Please give advice and stuff! :D      By the way, which breed do you think wouls suit me the most?      Thank you all for your time and answers!

20090220073200AAmFrqX	Pets;Dogs	General dogfood question?	I know they say that Walmart is not the best place to get your dogfood but that is what is convienent to where I live.  I just got a puppy and have been feeding him puppy chow but have heard that it is one of the worse foods I could pick because it is full of fillers and stuff that he cant even digest.  He is a german shepherd so I need something for large breed pups.  I want to stay with dry food.  I have heard pedigree is better for them than puppy chow.  Any advice and suggestions will be appreciated.  Also I am on a budget (4 teenagers and a 10 yr old) and cannot afford the super high dollar foods.  But I want to give him the best of what I can afford. Thanks in advance.

20090220074649AAMkRaL	Pets;Cats	Looking for a specific kind of scratcher?	So, I have had a breakthrough with my one cat Dexter.  I found the worlds most perfect scratcher for him to leave my couch alone, and good lord does he love it!!  I may have to replace it soon because he uses it so often, but I am lucky to have that little problem taken care of.      The problem now is his sister Deb.  The only place she likes to scratch (and its covered with tape but she peels it off) is the bottom 3 inches of my couch, all around the rim at the bottom.  She doesn't touch anything else. And all the tape, spray, orange/lemon, catnip, anti-scratch spray, doesn't work.  Would anyone know of a scratcher that would be this type that she would like?  She likes to lay on her side and scratch with all four paws at the same time.  Looking for something that would fit her "style" ;)  Thanks!!!

I was looking at videos of animal cruelty on youtube, just curious. and its really awful. animal testing, slaughter, training circus animal even. i wa truly shocked.    i am going to tell you right now that i eat meat. and i think that's ok, other animals hunt food. its natural. but there's a way to do it. kill them quick. don't torture them and scare them. i just wish there was something we could do that really would make a big difference and help stop this nonsense.

20090220074624AAlm1g9	Pets;Rodents	I am unsure about a few things (Gerbil question)?	OK so I am a NEW Gerbil owner I just got my Albino Gerbil, Ice on January 18, 2009. So I have a few questions regarding to bedding and health for my Gerbil. OK so here are some of my questions, so here we go!    1) My little sister is 9 years old (I am 16) and she has a cold and I walk in my room and she is petting my Gerbil WHILE she is sick! Is my Gerbil gonna be OK? Is it going to get sick? Don't worry I already locked my door and I have isolated myself in my room lol.      2) Do we have enough bedding in the cage? It is about 2-3 inches but she just KEEPS burrowing! Even when she reaches the bottom she tries and tries and tries to keep going thinking that she did not make it all the way to the bottom yet. Is this normal? Do we need more bedding?      3) OK she has a plastic Igloo (She does not chew on it I would remove it if she did I am not an idiot)and she scraps the sides of it! Like its the side of a burrow she has. Its like shes blind! (Shes not I am speaking metaphorically)       4) I don't want to chase her around the cage to hold her so I want to learn how to properly hold her. I have tried the treat in your hand thing but it didn't work.   :( I looked on youtube for videos but only found a childish 10 year old toeturing a poor gerbil trying to make it hold still for a picture.   o.O Any ideas on how to hold her?      5) When I go to pet her she sniffs my fingers then she comes over and bites my fingers! Is this normal or is she being agressive? Any suggestions on how to get her to not bite???         THX for all your help and if you are answering I would hope you have or have previously had a Gerbil!!!!!!  =D

20090220075000AAfrHjQ	Pets;Fish	Solitary (non-shoaling) impressive fish to add to a small tank.?	I've got a 35L (8 UKgallon / 9.5 USgallon) tank with filter and heater.      I did have a betta and 3 peppered cory cats in there.... but sadly the betta contracted an illness and despite my best efforts, he passed away.   Rather than replace him with another, I chose to replace him with a small group of 4 Neon tetra.    The 4 neon tetra and 3 cory cats seem to be doing fine.      Lovely though my tank looks, I would ideally like to add one or two more "centrepiece" fish to the tank.      I'm aware that I dont have much more space in my tank before it becomes borderline-crowded. So if I was to get a fish, it would have to be something content to live without others of its own species as getting more than 1 or 2 would make the tank crowded.      Ideally I'm looking for a gentle community fish that likes to be solitary/paired. It should look impressive or be a bit less normal than another tetra! It should be OK with my tank size, not be too territorial and ideally eat the same food as the tetras.      I'm aware that a betta would meet these requirements perfectly (though it might find the tank a bit crowded)..... but as I said, I dont want to get another one as I dont want to feel like I'm replacing my last one.      Any suggestions for alternatives would be appreciated.      Thanks!

I am just getting back into riding. I rode for 10 years, stopped for 7, and have been riding for about 2 now. The horses I used to ride all already knew this command...but I am training my own gelding this time.

He knows how to bend and give his head to pressure, but not when im on his back. Ive tried to bump (squeeze) his reins and "see saw" them (although people think its mean), and he doesnt respond AT ALL, even when im persistent. His head is low at a walk, but as soon as he trots or canters he raises it. Do you think side reins and a surcingle would work? Hes VERY EXTREMELY laid back and very smart...I think its more me then him. I just need some tips. I am looking for a more western pleasure prospect out of him.

My dog demands other dogs to respect his body language (he's a border collie mix)      Some dogs can't do that because they are too young to understand, too hyper to control themselves, or whatever the reason is, I cant expect all dogs to be as perfect as my dog wants them to be.      My dog has a habit of correcting/policing other dogs.      Anyway, I go to an off leash woods trail, which is great because my dogs can run, and my border collie mix is incredibly high energy so he needs this.      I was wondering if bach's rescue remedy could help him lighten up though, so he wouldn't get so nervous when dogs aren't as "respectful" as he'd like?   thank you!      (He doesn't attack dogs or i wouldn't take him around other dogs like this)
20090220082834AAFDdoX	Pets;Dogs	I have a Norwegian Elkhound?	I have a few questions... I do walk him around an hour daily, but I don't think he's being challenged enough while walking. I have a seven month old daughter, so he walks along side of us (her in her stroller). We have a fenced in back yard, where he enjoys to play, and we play inside our house (although he's terrible at fetch!) Anyway. We've had him for around two years, he's a great dog, we got him from a rescue but I just don't think he's being challenged enough. Any advice or suggestions? He obeys well, has doggy play-dates, and ect.

20090220092623AAY2NtZ	Pets;Dogs	Small children and treatment of animals - is it gender?	Have you noticed that we get a lot of questions like this:      "My 2-4 year old SON pulled my dog's tail/twisted the dog's leg/yanked the dog's ears and the dog bit him! What do I do?"      I don't think I've ever seen someone say that about their daughter. Are young girls naturally, or because of socialization (girls being taught from an early age that calm play is best, when boys aren't always taught that), better with animals? Do they have more natural empathy or are they better about not being so active with their little bodies?      Any opinions?
20090220084446AA34EOP	Pets;Fish	Is it ok to keep cories in groups of less than 6?	I've read about some people keeping them in pairs in smaller aquariums. I was thinking about getting 2 or 3 because I really like bottom feeders. I'm also cycling a second tank for ADFs! Anyways, the tank for the cories is established and is a peaceful community.      Would it be ok for me to get only 2 or 3? I understand that are best in shoals but just needed some suggestions. Other small, non-schooling fish ideas would also be helpful.
20090220091945AA5KDvv	Pets;Horses	What sort of solutions do you suggest for...?	our over population of horses problem.  I am not overly educated on other places having an over population of equines but I know that here in Alberta, Canada we have a VERY large problem with back door breeders, QH and QH cross sales, way too many perfectly good horses going to slaughter and the list goes on.  Either or, its an issue. A BIG ONE.  This concerns me as a competitive equestrian and equine enthusiast....how is this going to slow down? What CAN we do to regulate this population issue and homeless horse issue?  Should we just leave it and let it be? There has got to be something.        Personally - and agree with me or not, but I beleive that everyone who is going to breed should need a liscense.  I also think some sort of generalized and non breed specific registry should come to play for ALL horses (as much as possible).  I think there needs to be a huge effort on the "horse community" to try and help this awful situation.  Do I beleive slaughter should end? No. I dont. I think its a realistic way of regulating situations and horses who need to be put down.  I do think through that we need a new and more humane way of the process. But its ultimatley due to our back door breeding and free for all world of foals in anyones hands that we have this over population at the slaughter plants problem to begin with.        What do you think about the idea of everyone needing a liscense to breed? (regardless there is always going to be someone who does anyway, I know this) but atleast its something? A step in the right direction at controlling this?  With hefty fines for those who arent and a mediocre fee yearly to have a liscense?  What about the general, non breed specific registry? Create a control on the horses, more knowledge for buyers, security for owners etc? Do you think we need a way for more TABS on horses?      Big detailed question I know. Looking for a good discussion here. Please - no rudeness....Everyone get along and share your opinions!      Thanks All : 0)

20090220093210AAT9qXE	Pets;Cats	My kitten has an attachment issue?	Our family got a kitten in October and the little guy is driving me nuts. He will not leave my side except when he is asleep, If I go to the restroom he sits at the door crying, when I'm in the tub he is either sitting on the toilet or has even jumped in the water to try to get on me. He sleeps on me at night and when I leave he just goes nuts, even with others in the house. I can go NOWHERE without him at my feet or climbing me like a tree to be held. What can I do to make him more secure, this behavior is really odd.
20090220090245AAL8eJy	Pets;Dogs	What should I do (young dog)?	I have this neighbor that seems to have a very bad temper she will throw things at the young dog and yell at it to come here. Its hardly on a leash but sometimes it will come in to our yard so we will put it on a leash and have the lady or the guy come and get the dog. But it seems more times then not they don't pay any attention to it so my husband or I will have to take the dog over. I some times get nervous that she might be beating the dog in side the house because of how mad she gets at it for not coming when told. I have seen her kick the dog sometimes when it goes inside. Its really hard not to see whats going on when I am doing dishes and the window is right across from the house. This has been going on for a while and I don't know who to call for this or if I even should? What do you think?    What would you do if you see someone abusing a dog?

20090220083902AAbIjUK	Pets;Dogs	New chihuahua in the house?	I have  a new chi, that is 5 years old.  she was my sister's that was used by a BYB before my sister got her.  The dog fell in love with my daughter and I, and my sister said I could have her.  I have other dogs, a 12 week chi-weenie (Biscuit) and a 7 week chi (Bitty) that are also in the house full time.  My labs are outside in the kennels during the day. Anyways, Babies (the 5 year old) jumped on Bitty yesterday.  Babies has been socialized very well for having been a breeder.  I think she thought Bitty was trying to nurse her or something.  She has never done this before.  They are usually curled up on the couch together.  Any ideas?  Bitty was just trying to play with her.

I would let her out if we had a safe place for her to play. She is SO tiny for her age (we have had her for over six months and she is still about 5 lbs) and I am scared she will get eaten!! Plus she is really really pretty and I am sure someone would take her even WITH a collar. We tried a kitty harness to let her out a little, but she just hunkers down and won't move! What can I do to make her happy???      I don't know if it matters but we had her altered the middle of December         She climbs the curtains and sits on top of the rod for three or four hours a day, so she climbs all the time!! The curtains are sturdy, so I don't tell her no.      I posted this yesterday and only got one answer and it wasn't really what i was looking for

20090220084342AAnUBAW	Pets;Fish	Can I have a few fish while cycling my tank?	I was reading about cycling a tank online and found this:      "A new fish tank lacks the bacteria to form a steady biological cycle. That cycle proceeds as follows: Fish create the waste product ammonia, which is poisonous to them. Bacteria in the tank change that ammonia to nitrite, which is also toxic. Other bacteria break down the nitrite into nitrate, which is not toxic to fish. These steps will help you to cycle your aquarium on your own."      If I get a 40 gallon tank and only put a few small fish in it while I'm cycling the tank, would they be able to survive because they won't produce a lot of ammonia?      Thanks ^^

20090220090440AA0zgsY	Pets;Horses	Question/need opinions, horse leasing?	Okay this may be a very general question or in depth. But I do have a questions about leasing a horse.      Over the past 7 months I have free leased a horse. I did not pay a penny out of pocket other than for his care. The lease contract was very general, and she lied through her teeth about what the horse can do. She said the horse could jump and jump well. And that the horse would be suited to trail rides, and barrels as well.      When we first took this horse, we found that he did not load on the trailer, because of nerves we did not put shipping boots on him, as she told us not to. When we got him home, we found that his feet were in atrocious condition, cracks all over flared, and in just general bad shape. He had rain rot on his butt, and a cut on the back leg, which was older than the trailer ride.      What was worse is how she said he was superb for the farrier. This horse would not go into the barn, nor stand for the farrier at all. It took our farrier over an hour to trim his feet, and it was just a general trim, no shoes or anything else.      After having him for a month he what our farrier called a blow out, for a particle worked his way up the hoof months earlier. I was unable to ride or work with him for over a month as this foot bothered him. So we had a month that I could not ride him at all.      When I was able to ride him we worked up to it, but since she said he could jump, I did not think a lot of trying him over cavelettis to 2' small jumps. He acted scared of them, and veered off course many times, even with a more experienced horse in front of him. He did not like to jump, knocked rails when he did, and either plowed through or refused the rest of the time.      She also had said he was suited to barrels, and when I tried to take this horse around a pole, or barrel he shied away as if he has never seen one in his entire life. And that was at a walk.      She said he was an easy keeper, but this horse was a Thoroughbred, and I have had Thoroughbreds in the past, and we find them to be the hardest keepers. But I tried to take her word on that, as I have seen some that are fat in pictures.       We got this horse in July, I took him back before the lease was up. She was impossible to get ahold of. My husband ended up having to talk to her. My barn owner had to also contact her to say the horse needed to get out. My husband lost his job, and I could no longer afford board for this horse.       Now she is threatening to sue me, because the horse is 100 lbs lighter, and she is mad because his feet were done a month ago, so she has to do it sooner, if she actually does. It is mid-february, and we do not live in a place with little winters, ours are very long.      We have plenty of pictures of his condition through his entire stay.       It is not that I did not want a project so much as I did not want something that was so green that it couldn't be used to do anything other than paddock work, and that he could not jump well, and did not like it, so he was not a worthwhile project.      I also believe I have a video or two of how this horse hated jumping, and was scared of poles/barrels.      The winter does cause horses to lose some wieght, but he always had a blanket, and was fed well. I checked on him daily and worked him regularly.      Well we had to take him back A) because he was not what I was looking for and the lady lied about it all, and B) my husband was laid off at work, and if he would not have gone back he would not have been able to get the care he deserved.      The free lease said nothing about what she wanted him to get fed, nothing about what he was on, and also nothing about what times he was wormed, or vetted. He had not had a coggins in over a year. It is winter, he was blanketed and ate over a bale of hay a day plus beet pulp. I wormed him every two months, and had his feet trimmed every 6 weeks. The "contract" said nothing of care, or anything about the horse. All she had was ads online about what the horse did, and he didn't do any of it.

20090220093927AAp2P7n	Pets;Fish	Fantail Goldfish suddenly developed sores/ulcers?	ok so i have had a fantail goldfish for about a year now she was always very energetic etc. i used to keep her in a small tank then moved up to a 200 litre one along with some of the fish from the pond. they have all been in there for about 6 months or so.   over the past week i have noticed she became very slow, pretty much just staying around the top of the tank and only moving for food or if another fish came near. she developed a little lump in between her pectoral fins and now on one side she has a scale missing in two places and on the other side a cut type thing appeared and now the cut is all white and fluffy. the lump in between her pectoral fins is now more of a little hole with a little black bit protruding from the center.   other places look like they are developing more sores and i don't know whether i should just put her to sleep or if there is some treatment of some sort. i have done water tests and all is normal except the ph is a little low i am going to rectify that asap (any hints on the easiest way to do that) as far as i have seen none of the other fish are nipping or attacking her. what should i do?

Hi there, i adopted a cat from a local shelter a month ago, at home i noticed she had some health issues so called the vet they were affiliated with the shelter, and the vet saw  her and told me it could be a few things. she offered to call the shelter and see if they would take the cat back and call the state vet to ask about this issue. i in my stupidity said ok, they took her back and now it has been over a month and they refuse to let me see the cat, i asked if they put it down, they say no but no one will return my calls or let me see her. i have contacted the state vet and awaiting to see if their story is right-they claim she may have been infected with rabies=this is pure bs. she had her rabies shot the day i adopted her, she was walking funny and head tilted. she was very skinny and i didnt have an issue-i could have fed her kitten food to fatten her up, so the following day i went to the shelter to speak to the manager-she got strange with me when i told her i wanted her back-i reminded her that the vet told me they were just keeping her for safety reasons. so she told me the cat was in foster care, i asked to speak to the foster mother, she said why? hahaha...then i should have realized then and there, they probably put the cat down but wont tell me the truth so she got the lady, the lady refused to tell me where the foster home is and refused to let me see the cat. i have contacted the manager 5 or 6 times and each time she gives me excuses-i am not going to do anything stupid but i just want the truth. i sent an email to the state vet to see if i get any response...anyone else been lied to by vets/shelters??

I feel terrible, I am horrified to learn that she needed 6 of her 42 teeth removed.  I feel like it's my fault.  I used to brush them once every two weeks, and the vet said I need to brush them every night from here on out, after 2 weeks of healing.  She said they had to take out one of her big ones in the back.  I used to have a different vet who told me every 2 weeks.  What is going on? Is it normal to have a chihuahua lose 6 teeth after 3.5 years? It doesn't seem normal, and I am really worried that I've been the cause of her poor hygiene. Can it be genetics too?

I was just wanting you all to take a look at these photos of this little filly I am going to be aquiring for free. The lady who has her cant keep her because she has nine other horses, and wanted me to just take her off her hands.    Here is a little about her:   She is just turning two. Halter broke, easy to handle, knows how to lunge, load and pick up all four. She however hasnt had her shots or anything, but comes with a neg. coggins. I will get her shots no prob as I am not paying for her.      I will be using her for a potential trail horse, and I am hoping I learn to train her myself (my first time.....LOL) I do have a trainer friend to give me some pointers so dont worry. I be safe and kind to her..(This is for all you who could possibly give me neg. comments on this. LOL)   What breed does she look like to you? I was told she was ArabianX...Possibly QH?   How does her conformation look?   Any other comments about her would be awesome!

20090220093156AAFhNtG	Pets;Horses	Horse was treated for colic but still hasnt defecated for 2 days.?	My horse had some bad colic the day before yesterday and so I called the vet and they came out and we tried to pump in some oil in a tube through my horse's nose but she wouldnt really let us so the vet gave her a shot of banamine and left some oral banamine for me to give my horse every 9-12 hours as needed. The horse is feeling better and not showing signs of colic anymore and she is eating her hay as normal but still hasnt gone poop in at least 2 days. The vet has left me some oil and a 1 oz syringe for me to try to orally give her oil and I managed to get 2 syringe fulls of it in her mouth. The vet said that my horse's vitals were fine and that food was moving through her guts and their were noises.. Also she has been passing gas like normal. Should I stop worrying? Will she be fine?

I don't know why, or whether or not it is fat, but my cat's gotten pretty big.   I don't think we're feeding her too much cause she gets the same amount of food as her brother, and he's the perfect weight.   So my question is, is there anything we can do to help her lose that weight?   Would reducing her diet help at all?

This year I'm possiably showing 4 different horses, two in hand, and two under saddle (possiably both the inhand horses under saddle eventually but one is super green that needs more miles before I start showing him under saddle and the other is my personal horse who I haven't ridden with other horses in over a year so I'm a bit hesitant entering her under saddle right away.)      Not sure if all four horses would be at the same show (it depends on who we can rent a trailer from at this point).      Anyways my question's are First will I need separate numbers? I've shown before but never more than one horse so I'm curious on how that would work. and if I do need separate numbers how do I change my number quickly if I'm on two different horses with classes back to back? I already have someone who can hold the other horse ready at the gate so actually getting the horse won't be the problem it would just be changing my number quickly.       :

20061112095034AAY3tbd	Pets;Dogs	Will my dog survive? Very sick.?	I took my 7 year old dog to the vet yesterday. In the past two weeks, it has been very ill. It has been healthy its whole life. It was covered in fleas, extremely thin. Very lethargic. Can hardly walk. When you try and pet its head, its head suddenly drops to the ground. It always is resting its head on things, like benches. The most dramatic difference is the way its head drops suddenly. We found worms in its water. It is not vomiting and does not have diarrhea.      We took it yesterday to the vet and they did stool and blood tests. It does not have parvo. The test results come in in a few days. Vet gave us Heartguard for fleas and ticks that we used yesterday.      We believe it is either tick fever, valley fever or intestinal parasites. Are the chances of survival and recovery from these good? It had only been sick for two weeks prior to today.      It is about 6 or 7 years old. Could be a mix between a rottweiler, found as a stray. Had all its shots. 35 pounds, normally 45.

They are both about 13 years old and males.  I have never had this problem before, so why would he start peeing on the floor now.  Oh yes, and this morning, I found it on my kitchen table as well.  This is a major problem and I dont know what to do.  Should I just take them both to the vet?

20061118091401AAHxRUE	Pets;Cats	What can I look forward to as my kitten gets older?	I've never had a cat before this one and I guess what I kind of want to know is 1.will he ever grow out of his agressive playing, i.e. nibbling on my fingers, hands, etc. (it kinda hurts and no amount of "NO!" and  water bottle training seems to help so far). and 2. about how long does it take for a kitten to become full sized, or appear full sized?

20061230175329AAgKxok	Pets;Dogs	My dog is acting strange?	My dog is very tired lately, she 10 years old [60 in dog years] and shes not active at all. A new puppy is not an option. Shes barely eating and she losing alot of weight. And yes. We have been to the vet numerous times. She is being medicated for a urinary track infection [which she also had when we first adopted her] but she seems to be very depressed. Shes not craving attention from me, if anything shes avoiding it. Is it possible she feels that i love her too much and she wants me to back off or something.      Answers from people with experience in this situation please.

20070216055525AA6EZuF	Pets;Dogs	How does a female dog that's in "heat" react to another female dog?	I have two female dogs. One is a German Shepherd that is in "Heat" and the other a Rottweiler. The Rottweiler recently joined the family but is being irritated by the German Shepherd. Maybe she's trying to establish dominance which I take care of by diciplining her but I'm wondering if this is a typical female dog's behavior towards other female once she's in heat. Is this the case?

20070421123932AANzZiR	Pets;Birds	Who should I call to have 2 ducks removed SAFELY from an apartment complex in Gilbert AZ.?	There are 2 ducks (one male and one female) in our apartment complex they come up to our balcony everyday around 12pm and then go back to the grass field close by. There is a large group of kids that play in this field in the afternoon and they are very destructive and mean. I'm afraid that these ducks might build a nest and if these kids find it they will destroy it. I don't know who to call to have these ducks humanely removed from the apartments and put somewhere safer.
