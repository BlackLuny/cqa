FoIxsunVaa	I object to the use of the word "sins" here, but I believe that 9/10th of whom we are is our family reworked. So their story becomes our story.<br>  <br>  Change and reformation are possible, but:<br>  A. They are very hard to achieve.<br>  B. The are discrete changes whereas our reflection of our families is broad and deep.<br>  C. Most of our paralleling the past goes on far under our level of awareness.<br>  <br>  Fortunately the vast majority of what we receive from growing up is good or at least useful stuff and dysfunction is only a piece of it.|`|AA11635601	Should they?  No.  Do they?  ya quite a bit.  Cause parents teach their children what they know, both true and false, good and bad.  Also, more subtly but with much greater impact, the limit of parents' ability to love imparts such limits on their kids.  They can grow past that but it's a big deal to do so.|`|Z4YSnC3gaa	Children often taken on the issues of their parents and even try and model themselves after one parent or another. This typically includes the "good" with the "bad". This is not being doomed, but idealizing someone, envying them, or having jealousy is complete with problems.<br>  <br>  For example, a teenager might envy the freedom of an adult, however, the teenager may forget the responsibilities that are included. The adult may envy the care-free teenager, but then forget the restricted rights that teenagers have.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, we do have some choices in life and we are only doomed to the cycle of history if we choose it.<br>  <br>  Although, suffer the sins of the parent is usually used in a different way to mean should a child be punished if their parents are guilt of a sin or a crime.|`|UtzALxfjaa	No. Because they don't.<br>  <br>  Edit: They don't because they had nothing to do with the parents' sins. It's just a coinsidence if you happen to come across a child that suffers from their parents' sins. However, when the parent/or parents are commiting that sin TO THE child, that's a different story. No one could be responsible for that, except for the parents. And clearly, that is THEIR SIN. When punished for the sin, the child is no longer involved.|`|YOt6uTSzaa	If it is a sin that the child themselves has become aware of that has affected them or they now also commit which more often happens in their young adult years then it is up to them to deal with it, rid themselves of it, seek forgiveness, find help to overcome,NOT continually blame their parent for their action or their childhood or how it has shaped them, FOR now they posses the ability to know, to change, to find the right answer, to shape their own being and their life ...it is at this point their responsibility, Not anyone else and CAN NOT be blamed on anyone but themselves....it is a scapegoat to say I sin and I am doing wrong because I was taught no differently growing up or I had a difficult life I will never change, I will never be the person I want to be....I think that is wrong and not helping the person concerned in anyway, but hurting them even more.|`|UY6c7DG8aa	There're always ways to get out of it!<br>  children are not doomed just cuz their parents are fked up!|`|Ewosh9pTaa	What are sins?<br>  If you accept that "god" is a moral warlock then chances are he would probably punish bad deeds down through the family line until they were atoned for.<br>  But hey - I can't live in a medieval world like that! <br>  Do children suffer their parent's sins in the eyes of the media and neighbours? Probably - depending on how severe their parents "sins" were.<br>  SHOULD a child suffer the sins of their parents? <br>  NO OF COURSE NOT. <br>  The child is no more to blame for things that their parents did than they are for a **** that T-Rex took on a Veloceraptors head 5,000,000,000 years ago.|`|FyszvGyWaa	I have realized that what I want most for my child is to be nothing like me!  I look at this issue as Karma gone bad.  Now, sure, my parents were assholes, but now, I have to take care of them and it is ruining my life!  So, how does Karma reward me for being born- I get stuck with them and will now pull my child from private school to continue supporting my parents.|`|SDiYtubGaa	Invariably, they shouldn't suffer for their parents' sins. But not invariably, they ARE doomed to take responsibility for their parents issues. It would have been better, had you been more specific about 'issues' because now, I am 'doomed' to give an incomplete and unsatisfying answer.|`|JL0Pqw9Xaa	No that is a narrow stifling viewpoint.<br>  Your you and you grow on your own.<br>  Creative people use drawbacks in their<br>  experience for future possibilities.<br>  From frustration comes opportunity<br>  and for that matter..If you father was a killer<br>  ..are you going to adopt that philosophy and become a killer too?|`|8ekoa6szaa	When we become adults (at least over the age of 18) we are each responsible for our own sins.  Why should a child pay for them?  They may learn what they know from us as their parents, but they are not responsible for what we do, only for what they themselves do.|`|dbe2eb2f4bce5ba413cf891959ba7115aa	Here in Egypt, yes they do. If a child for example is born out of wedlock he's promised a life of constant humiliation, when in fact if anyone should be punished it'd definitely be not him.|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	Biological knowledge today shows how children do inherit the "sins of their parents".  So phsically we can fight them.  And even intellectually we can fight those too as well.|`|AA10953999	If their father robbed a bank, other than possible ridicule, they will most likely not suffer their entire lives.  However, children from an abusive home usually grow up to be abusers or in an abusive relationship.|`|IQjLtnP1aa	St. Agustine says that Ignorance and Concupisence(pls. correct my spelling) is the fruit of sin. Thus, sin is universal.  We all sin. We know there is good and evil.  Choose evil you will perish, choose to do good and  you will prosper. A child is not born a sinner, becomes a sinner, and yes somehow we do inherit the evils of humankind including those of our parents. It is not like you get a certifcate when you are born encrypted all the sins you have inherited.  Is a little different.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Q1: no, theyshouldn't, it's not fair.<br>  <br>  But unfortunately for Q2: they tend to be.  I think when a parent has a problemt he child initially automatically copies it: and then perhaps becomes conscious of this and swings 180 the other way and has the equally bad,opposite problem for a while<br>  <br>  and if evolved, then eventually notices this too, and hopefully recentralises, evolves past teh issue and comes to rest in the centre like a pendulum which has run out of steam.  For some people, depending on their maturity etc this could take longer than their allotted 70 years, which is to say, they might not get there before they die.  Some people, however, wake up to the whole thing and charge on through it all, evolving at a cracking pace and get there in their thirties.<br>  <br>  It sort of depends on the training of their mind: which is where phil comes in, because it teaches you that yo udon't know all the answers, and shows you how to find them: under rocks, etc.  Where you least expect.  <br>  <br>  :o)|`|GOKlnTfbaa	no.

PwfS4T74aa	try Got2B's Glued Styling Spiking Glue. It is the best styling product I've ever used.<br>  <br>  It won't sweat out (it's water resistant), and it will hold for more then 24 hours (I use it before going to school after I take a shower and it is still holding the next morning before I take a shower)<br>  <br>  Another idea would be to use it in conjunction with Got2B's Glued Rubber Cement. The Rubber Cement should be applied before the Spiking Glue and makes styling a lot easier and the hold even stronger, but it's really hard to find the Rubber Cement in stores ( I found 2 bottles at Walgreens once, and I never found any others in any store, so now I order it online)<br>  <br>  The Styling Spiking Glue is really easy to find-Target always has it in stock, and it's about $5-$7 for a 6 OZ tube (it's pretty big). The tube is mustard yellow and may or may not have cardboard packaging

WZNaNvplaa	Most likely religion. Religion has traditionally answered these questions by saying "God/The Gods did it". This methodology has two things in its favor. First, it provides a definitive answer. This god or that goddess makes the moon or the stars move around the earth as noticed. Second, it provides the how, again in the form of the gods. Where the Greeks began to stand out was that they didn't settle for this. Even when believing, they wanted the details of how things worked. Were the stars embedded in spheres that spun in space, or what? Science tends to advance when religion doesn't dominate the daily life of people. Babylonian and Egyptian religions tended to deify their rulers, who had an interest in maintaining some form of theocracy. The Greeks, with their many city states, were less inclined to focus on religion to the degree the other nations did.

kfWi9ZkEaa	Ouch.  this is happening to my mother: or she feels it is, which undermines her, frets her.  It is dreadful: when we consider the arguments we hit later in life, they're based upon a million prior arguments.  If one cannot back up one's premisses for the new argument, where can one go? One is stuck in the mud.<br>  <br>  I think in the end, if one worries about one's memory, one has to have faith that one has internalised a great deal, and therefore moved it: win-zipped it, I guess, the raw data one no longer really has access to, but the conclusions, tested and worked and honed, have been solid for years, one has lived with one's weight upon it.  <br>  <br>  Which is to say, one can deduce that one knows certain things by the fact that one is still functioning and sane.  I wonder if this is why older philosophers ask more questions, tell fewer answers? this is very zen, very socratic, and I think of the most value to the younger seeker of knowledge anyway.<br>  <br>  :o)|`|dlGP3iZ6aa	As a philosopher, there is some merit to your question, even if it could be stated more clearly.<br>  <br>  For a person who loves reading, writing, and remembering what I read and write, the possibility of losing one's memory can have a direct impact on one's confidence in philosophizing.  Forgetting certain words, or not quite remembering where you read something can be frustrating.  I don't think philosophy is possible without at least decent short-term and long-term memory.|`|SDiYtubGaa	My thoughts invariably depend upon my memory.

wfDzUSItaa	Wow that would have been an interesting twist, the Normandy assault never would have happened. First the US would have had to subdue Canada, they entered the war a few years prior to the US.Then England would be alone in the Atlantic and starved into surrender. Depending on which side Japan would take, China would be under Japans control since China was with the allies. That being said the US would have crossed the Axis controlled Pacific to open a second front against Russia through China. Once the US got a foothold of the Russian coast Japan could move south and take on England in Indonesia, and  then move on to Australia where the Japanese navy would have choked them into submission, Leaving a divided India (they fought on both sides during the Africa campaigns) as the last threat from the east of Europe. I know this is a lot of hypothetical ideas here, but the war would not have been as long as it sounds. There were to many innovations from America that helped win the war. 1) We are located out of range of bombers for one so our 2) factories  assembly lines could mass produce the weapons of war needed. The reason the invasion of Normandy couldn't happen is the US (Louisiana) developed the Higgins landing crafts that stormed the beaches.|`|xJoMSkI5aa	It would have been bleak for the Allies.

0be57b6ffd629f5e78d92344323cbbaeaa	Honestly, opinions about pedal sound quality vary greatly from player to player.  It's best to demo at a music store and determine what you like.<br>  <br>  Most of this really depends on your budget.  As mentioned earlier, very few multieffects beat the PodXt, but it's a few hundred dollars. If you don't need to put it in front of your amp, you can get all the tones of the Pod series from your computer via a Line6 Guitarport hardware/software, for under $100.<br>  <br>  If you need to go cheaper than that, I have always been a fan of DOD and Boss pedals.  <br>  <br>  If you go with individual pedals, make sure you spend your money on your overdrive/distortion.  Most anybody can do a decent sounding chorus/delay/modulation effects.  But getting a decent sound and feel from an overdrive type pedal is a lot harder. A lot of brands do it wrong, only a few do it right.<br>  <br>  When I started out, I was a big fan of the DOD Turbo Overdrive. The classic pedals are the Rat and the Tube Screamer.  But if you like a bit more gain, the Boss Metal Masters are pretty nice and warm.|`|96960bff72fac77e22d67f6dc24390d9aa	Overdrive gives a crunchy distorted sound. Used by Metal players<br>  Delay introduces Echo.<br>  Wah Wah makes the notes sound like someone is saying "Wah Wah" (listen to lead guitar of surfing with the alien by Joe Satriani to hear wha Wah Wah sounds like).<br>  <br>  What else would you like to know?<br>  <br>  For brands, Marshall makes good pedals as does BOSS.|`|7a761aec681bd06716889f927e122ff0aa	For just a tiny bit more than you'd spend on a couple of pedals, you could buy a line 6 Guitar pod, and have literally hundreds of great, highly customizable sounds.<br>  <br>  Why waste you money on a couple of effects you'll get bored with. Get a guitar pod, or a similar pedal board...<br>  <br>  I use the Pod. It works great for both studio and live performance.

Plus the fact that women have a lot of emotion outlets than guys.|`|37618d6c276a9d392dd348e67c0f4520aa	No, I think mans 2020 is right. It's not that you can't feel that they want to, so stop boasting about your perceptivity here. But they don't show it directly, they only hint it. They always leave a way out of it - a possiblity to say "no, I didn't want it, whatever gave you that idea?" I've recently talked to my girlfriend about it - you know, it's actually a lot better to talk to people in front of you, instead of asking "dumb" questions on the net, where there's so much output that you get, where most people wouldn't be there, if they could really talk to real people :) and where not everybody's a psychologist, to say the least. And I've been talking about that to other women, as well - and men. For women, opening up to making love is a greater leap of faith, initially - because of the physical act, per se, because of the power hyerarchy in the act of it and because of education. Accepting it makes a lot of them ask themsevles if they're not sluts, even though they want it. Taking that further step, asking for it, requires crossing a divide that many women can't cross. Some of my friends (women friends) said they would want to that - that they wanted to "feel cheap" they said it, but there's something in the back of the head fastening them down. And these women are NOT easy and what they meant by cheap is another thing that you may have in mind. Yet, I know some women who do that - just come to you and start kissing you - which is great - not in a hedonistic - male shovinistic pig - kinda way - there's a lot of women just waiting to say that about anything - but in that communication, not being afraid, directness, honest and open kind of way. Of course, there are gonna be morons thinking "I'm just the gorgeusest, the coolest dude in town, she couldn't keep her hands off me" Or "she's a ****, man. Oh, I ain't gonna marry this particulaer woman". That's just the reverse of that way of thinking, cause, like many women, some people think a NORMAL woman WOULDN'T do that.|`|97d745f64210357e470a1cc998c46bc5aa	Dude, you need to brush up your antennas a bit, as ladies give enough signs, you just need to know, how to read them, that's all!|`|AA11199006	Who gave u that idea? ladies do too, but ladies don't show it to the world!

Some famous absinthe drinkers: Oscar Wilde, Toulouse-Lautrec, Rimbaud, Hemingway, and Picasso.  But none of them died from 'the green muse!'|`|00363b82d8a3408aeb964fe9253d354baa	It was Toulouse Lautrec|`|AA11495076	Oscar wilde....ina hotel room in paris.|`|AA11578052	Tim Smith... prove there wasn't an artist named Tim Smith that died from an over consumption of Absinthe!|`|d59a577451a2dcab74d7e971dd6f42c3aa	Absinthe is originally made from the poppy, it is actually a form of opium, or a type of heroin.  Overdose is possible, but I can't think of any that did!  It sure didn't help to build a steady mind for logical thought, but it did perpetuate a number of great works.  Their cursed addiction was the gift of vision, and the result was many depressed, short lived lives but, their creations still inspire us all.|`|AA11100037	Hemingway drank absinthe a lot, and that may be the answer you're looking for, but you don't OD on it because it is not a drug.  You die of acute alcohol poisoning, just like if you drank half a gallon of vodka, but it takes less with the absinthe than it would with another spirit because absinthe has added "poisons" in it.<br>  <br>  And, in case you're wondering, absinthe tastes horrible!  The sugar cube you traditionally pour it over does not make it taste any better.|`|a015eae5426e950435341ae581263fa1aa	You can't OD on absinthe. It is just liquor, so it would be alcohol poisoning.|`|a9000febfaa687a1c8b6a75a963d0967aa	Good question. I imagine that continual alcohol abuse will most probably lead to serocis of the liver, and I suppose if not treated should lead to death. In regards to an alcohol overdose, not an expert, but 4 maybe 5 bottles at one sitting might kill a person. I believe it would lead to blood poisoning and then death...

I covered ours by laying down a few large garbage bags and then put newspaper on top of that.<br>  <br>  Prepare your dye as directed by the manufacturer. You should carefully follow all instructions. While preparing the dye and dying your item, you should wear rubber gloves to protect your hands from staining and the hot water.<br>  <br>  Pre-treat your item if necessary. <br>  <br>  With some dyes you will have to soak it in soda ash and with others, like RIT, you simply need to dip it in hot water.<br>  <br>  Start dying! It is usually best to start with the lightest color if you are using more than one color. Rinse or wait between colors as directed by the manufacturer. Make sure to follow all directions carefully when it comes to dying and rinsing your items. Some dyes require you to rinse immediately and others require you to let the item sit for at least 24 hours.<br>  <br>  When your dyeing is complete, make sure to clean all containers immediately with hot water and soap or cleanser if needed.<br>  <br>  Be careful washing your tie-dyed items! Most should always be washed in cold water. The first few times they are washed, they might bleed, so wash them with like colors or alone.<br>  <br>  Again, the exact directions you follow will vary depending on what brand of dye you use. Read all instructions and precautions carefully.<br>  There is one thing you should remember while you tie-dye no matter what brand of dye you use: There is not a wrong or right way to do this! Every tie-dyed item will turn out different no matter what technique and colors you use. Check out the pictures of Our Projects and have fun creating your own!|`|1a65052831026597cb739773566f339faa	You use a soda ash solution.  Mix it 1 cup of soda ash to 1 gallon hot water.  The hot water just helps it to dissolve.  You will need to soak the shirts for at least 15 minutes before beginning.  I always get the soda ash solution made up before I start tying up the shirts, so it is ready to go...<br>  <br>  Soda ash, aka sodium carbonate, is available at swimming pool supply sections of stores, as well as at Dharma trading listed in my sources.  My hubby can get it at work, and brings me home big pails of it, but I've bought it in a pinch at a local discount store during pool season up here under the name pH up.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest that you use a fiber reactive dye (like Procion or Dharma dyes) for brightest results.  Also using 100% cotton is best for minimizing any fabric issues that may make your colors less bright.|`|575bd44e0361280d2f4e701d93da09b9aa	Oh, don't do that.  People might mistake you for a hippie.|`|AA10359756	tying a t-shirt so that when you dye it you will get a certain pattern|`|a0523bb1ad180ca441b57e09bc957260aa	Make sure the t-shirt is a natural fiber - 100% cotton - and wash it first to remove sizing. It will then take the dye better. Using a commercial dye like Procion will be brighter. You can add a teaspoon worth of baking soda to change the ph of the dye so it attaches to the fibers better. Older t-shirts do not take the dye well (from body oils and detergent residue) or if they have any polyester in the blend. ALSO - after you dye it - don't wash it for 48 hours and wash it in cold water and by itself the first time you wash it. Throwing it in the dryer after 48 hours may also set the dye so it doesn't fade.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

AA10082073	One theme of the book is courage. Both the lady that was addicted to morphine and Atticus had courage. She could have just remained the way she was for the rest of her life or she could get rid of her addiction. Very few poeple would every know if she did or not so the only thing that was driving her was herself. And that can take a lot of courage when it would be easy to just give up and die.<br>  Atticus had the courage to take the case of the black man. He not only took the case but also did his best at defending him. A man of lesser charachter wouldn't have tried hard to win because it would have an unpopular thing to do in the south at that time. But he had the courage to stand up to the town and show them what it really meant to follow what you believed to be right. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

lTNcvqyHaa	If one looks at nature and the lessons of animals and native man. Then the answer is yes. Most tribes that live in a substance traditional culture, only survive because of the tribes offspring. Whilst the tribe needs and adheres to the teachings and wisdom of the elders, the tribe needs the strength and courage of the young men to hunt, the young girls to procreate and the cycle of life continues.<br>  However, once too old, no teeth, slow or infirm the elderly knew that they could no longer keep up with the tribe, and feared the risk of the whole tribe's survival, so they would either be left behind or would walk away from the tribe.<br>  <br>  However, I hope that I was never in a situation to have to decide, but yes I would make the decision, to restrict food, if it meant the survival of the young and healthy - but the caution is, how old is too old and how young is too young. What can the old offer the tribe, what benefits  can the child bring or consume. All the facts would have to be taken into consideration.

I would 'hope' that the older people would make the decision for themselves to go without, rather than have it made for them, but this is not always the case. Would it (to put it in simpler terms) be acceptable to kill, in an order to advance the society?<br>  <br>  I will say that it depends on your moral philosophy. As a Christian I would say that it is not acceptable, but rather that your society should bond together and pray that your needs would be met. Evenly distribute rations, and come to God to provide. There are other philosophies though, such as utilitarianism, which tell us that the ends justify the means. In which case it would be acceptable.

Can't remember the title but the story was about at a certain age the old was taken away on a sled and left in thee woods to die. This was done because off food shortages. One child challenged his father with why leave the sled when one day I'll have to take you into woods to die."The father thought it over and decide to go against village tradition. The old man told his son to plant his wheat on top of the house to keep the critters from eating his crops. In the long run it was shown that the old could offer a lot of wisdom and the tradition ended.|`|AA10729675	In your theoretical scenario, nothing is "natural".  It is not natural to deprive anyone.  It is not natural to tell an elderly:  "you have lived, now die, so that the young can live."  There is noting natural here.  Just like your question about saving one out of two people who were theoretically drowning.  There is no natural way to do this.|`|3buQDaRDaa	Yes. In hard times, those that have a benefit to society or the group can survive. It is the same way in nature. The old and the sick fade away. Those that can hunt or provide some skill survive.|`|htSZsds7aa	No, what if that senior Citizen was a doctor or scientist and could help save the rest of everyone else..how do u choose between one or another...u cant do it morally...I would do it by lottery .|`|Z4YSnC3gaa	Survival of the fittest. If you cannot get to the food and eat of your own accord (whether you are young or old) nature will determine your survival.

KADDz1EPaa	At 3:00 P.M. on April 15,1920, a paymaster and his guard were carrying a factory payroll of $15,776 through the main street of South Braintree, Massachusetts, a small industrial town south of Boston. Two men standing by a fence suddenly pulled out guns and fired on them. The gunmen snatched up the cash boxes dropped by the mortally wounded pair and jumped into a waiting automobile. The bandit gang, numbering four or five in all, sped away, eluding their pursuers. At first this brutal murder and robbery, not uncommon in post-World War I America, aroused only local interest. <br>  <br>  Three weeks later, on the evening of May 5, 1920, two Italians, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, fell into a police trap that had been set for a suspect in the Braintree crime. Although originally not under  <br>  Sacco & Vanzetti  <br>   <br>  suspicion, both men were carrying guns at the time of their arrest and when questioned by the authorities they lied. As a result they were held and eventually indicted for the South Braintree crimes. Vanzetti was also charged with an earlier holdup attempt that had taken place on December 24, 1919, in the nearby town of Bridgewater. These events were to mark the beginning of twentieth-century America's most notorious political trial. <br>  <br>  Contrary to the usual practice of Massachusetts courts, Vanzetti was tried first in the summer of 1920 on the lesser of the two charges, the failed Bridgewater robbery. Despite a strong alibi supported by many wit nesses, Vanzetti was found guilty. Most of Vanzetti's witnesses were Italians who spoke English poorly, and their trial testimony, given largely in translation, failed to convince the American jury. Vanzetti's case had also been seriously damaged when he, for fear of revealing his radical activities, did not take the stand in his own defense. <br>  <br>  For a first criminal offense in which no one was hurt, Vanzetti received a sentence that was much harsher than usual, ten to fifteen years. This signaled to the two men and their supporters a hostile bias on the part of the authorities that was political in nature and pointed to the need for a new defense strategy in the Braintree trial. <br>  By the italian historian|`|AA12321514	The state's case was based primarily upon two facts: Sacco possessed a pistol of the type used in the murders, and the accused when arrested were at a garage attempting to claim an automobile that had been seen in connection with the South Braintree crimes. <br>  Microsoft ? Encarta ? 2007. ? 1993-2006 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.<br>  <br>  The trial was based upon two fact. 1. was that Sacco possessed a weapon of the type that was used in the murder and the accused were are the garage attempting to claim a car that was involve in the crime. <br>  Jurors were accused of bias. When they returned a verdict, outcry started from radical parties throught out the world. They claimed that only fault of Sacco and Vanzetti was that they were immigrants.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/SaccoV/SaccoV.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects...</a>|`|TU5y1wzvaa	Basically, they were tried & convicted without any real "hard" evidence or procedures to protect themselves like the justice system has today.

There are also Medieval alchemical elements such as Sulfur, Mercury, Salt, Air, Fire, Earth, Aether/Space, etc...|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	Well I am just guessing and basing it on the book below that is on the internet.  <br>  <br>  It is found in a book called "From Alchemy to Chemistry in Picture and Story by Arthur Greenberg.

He husband looked at her skeptically, "But I can wait..." She said lowly, "OH GOD, I CAN'T!" <br>  "Not till December," her husband said, deep and slightly on edge for her impatience and constant change of mind.|`|0xekiwHQaa	Lol, what?|`|w7USF5wDaa	Huh?

The purpose of Flickr and sites like it is to share your photography.  What many people do is only upload pictures that are 800x600 or thereabouts so that they aren't useful for too much.<br>  <br>  You are in control of what people can see, and there are many preferences to help you with your audience control.  You can set up your account so that pictures you upload only get shared with your family, or only with your friends, etc.  In those cases the person can't see your picture unless they have a Flickr account and you give the thumbs up by marking them as a friend or family.|`|FeUmyxqqaa	yes they can and yes they do, if you dont want others to take your images use watermarks, both visable and embeded<br>  <br>  there is a setting, there are ways around it, dont upload images bigger than say 300x450|`|zqGnMFAzaa	Yeah, people can take anything off the net, best you can do is watermark it in a place where somebody couldn't crop it easily.|`|2TLXfQKDaa	Yes and not really.  The best thing you can do to avoid art theft is a bit limited.  Upload files as .png when able.  Place a watermark over parts of the image that are difficult to get out.  Tell people they are in violation of copyright infringement blah blah blah.  Embed your information into the file, and last but not least don't upload large images.  Smaller ones are less desirable to the art thieves out there.

3whhpHHvaa	Please ignore the idea that you should change that last line. I'm not much for these types of poems, but this is genuinely impressive.<br>  <br>  The only thing I will say with any certainty, is that you should not use the term "obsessive compulsive disorder." From the way the rest of the poem was written, I knew you were intending to talk about OCD long before you said it. I would find another way to say it.<br>  <br>  And think to yourself. When you sit/sat in HS English class, how many times does the teacher have to tell the class what the poem is really about because everyone has a different take on it? Allowing your reader the privelage of applying the poem to themself by not naming the disorder or issue makes the poem, well, better.<br>  <br>  Relatability is key. If you find a way to make that correction, this is genuinely good enough to be in a coffee table book (which is a huge honor for artists if you are too young yet lulz.)|`|tJqG2q9uaa	i think the only thing that needs changing is the last line - you've said youre a watermelon not an apple in your opening lines. Youve spent the poem describing why and you painted a great picture of OCD. So to say 'that is why my brain says im' etc. you're kinda saying to the reader that they are too stupid to work that out for themselves. A better way to end it would be just to repeat the first lines at the end which implies the same thing without spelling it out so obviously.|`|T4CZbRsSaa	really like this... its... its... well its not how we think... we'll try to re-arrange it for you to help the flow but think we'll butcher it in the process... thanks for sharing...<br>  <br>  "obsessive compulsive disorder"<br>  <br>  obsessive<br>  my brain says I'm a watermelon falling from a tree<br>  because it knows I'm far from a falling apple<br>  it tells me to be this way and the force takes over<br>  I have to listen or "it" will happen<br>  <br>  compulsive<br>  the force that controls me<br>  check something, walk away, come back, repeat<br>  check something, walk away, come back, repeat<br>  count one, two, three, one, two, three<br>  touch, walk away, come back, touch again<br>  <br>  my brain says I'm a watermelon falling from a tree|`|roe07rI8aa	I love it how it is! It's a real insight and surely that's what a poet would want others to think as they read their work? You've got a gift for this, keep at it.

I can feel how you feel in reading this.|`|2kg2cOHOaa	This Is The End is better.<br>  <br>  p.s. excellent writing on both of them!|`|3whhpHHvaa	I couldn't tell the difference. No variety. No change. Same scheme, pentameter, vocabulary.<br>  <br>  I want you to take this to heart, but not offensively at all. This is said with the utmost sincerity - they seem fairly childish and not well thought-out. Really need revisions.|`|YqEDJnJ7aa	I like the 2nd one better cause it talks about how a relationship were one of the persons keeps breaking the others heart and begs for forgiveness and the person takes the other person back but the other person still breaks the others heart again and at the end of the poem it talks about how the relationship just dies.

Both claim to be buffeted by strong emotions, but both ultimately seem to be self-indulgent individuals who enjoy melodrama and self-involvement more than anything. When we first meet them, Orsino is pining away for love of Olivia, while Olivia pines away for her dead brother. They show no interest in relating to the outside world, preferring to lock themselves up with their sorrows and mope around their homes.

He was continously sending courtiers and lackeys to go and woo her for him, and that is what Cesario's job was. He asked to hear music continously, becuase "If music be the fruit of love play on." He is sick for the want of love returned to him.<br>  hope this helps!<br>  God bless you<br>  K.K.

Any author's personal life impacts their writing in some way...but it's not like an autobiography or anything. And except for his histories, his plays were fiction.

There's no legitimate pentameter, it's a trite scheme that has been done to death, there doesn't seem to be much depth or imagery beyond what you laid down. Again, respectfully, it is kind of cliche as a metaphor. <br>  <br>  Try to branch out with newer vocabulary, and try to instill a greater flow. Remember that you will not be able to read it to your audience every time, so it has to be written in a way that I will automatically read it with the same syllable stresses and such.<br>  <br>  Also, the way you wrote it on the forum is not very attractive. Part of poetry is laying down the words the way you like. Including punctation, indentations, etc. Remember this if you re-post.<br>  <br>  (And, as a side note, some of this is just comprised of sentences. Sentences are not always free-form poetry. Really put thought into it if you rewrite. Without offense intended, I could have written this in moments. Take time, plan, put it away, look at it hours and days later. Revise a lot.)

38048113bed5156d5452a22bebeb0514aa	No creo que sea cuestión de "necesitar" a alguien; sino cuestión de si disfrutas de la compa?ía y del intercambio con alguien. Eso puede ser muy hermoso y enriquecedor, cosas que la dependencia no las da.<br>  <br>  No tienes ninguna obligación de hacerte sentir nada en concreto para relacionarte con quien te apetezca; puedes hacerlo porque sí, sin más motivos ni razones.<br>  <br>  Quizás estás confundiendo algo ambas facetas de una relación interpersonal con los hombres. Disfrutar con alguien, no  tiene porqué suponer dependencia de él o de ella. Las diferencias, siempre que te agraden, son muy estimulantes y placenteras. Pero debes y puedes pasar de aquellos hombres con los que no te sientas bien, porque no te gustan, no te respetan o no te entienden (o simplemente no te apetece estar con ellos en un momento determinado).<br>  <br>  No creo tampoco que sea cuestión de "amor", que es algo muy subjetivo y difícil de definir; aunque yo creo que es real; pero es independiente del tema que planteas, que es más bien de relaciones interpersonales libres de obligaciones sentimentales asumidas tradicionalmente como las "sanas" o las "adecuadas"; eso sí que pienso que son memeces.<br>  <br>  ?Un saludo; salud y mucha suerte!|`|0d9f875f99896081abd50e2c619df1b2aa	Si sabes la causa de eso porque no lo resuelves??? dificil es no saber la razon.

Existen mil etiquetas con las que podemos seleccionar las perzonas. Pero de acuerdo a la metafisica dice:     Mente humana está dividida básicamente en dos partes: la Consciente y la Inconsciente. La última es la depositaria de todas nuestras programaciones y recuerdos; mientras que en la primera radica todo nuestro Poder de Decisión. <br>  La Mente Consciente es la que se encuentra conectada con el Espíritu. Solamente al ser consciente de lo que vives lo puedes cambiar. La Mente Subconsciente es la equivalente al Alma; es el gran archivo de las experiencias de esta vida y de las anteriores. Finalmente, tenemos nuestro Cuerpo Físico, que es el vehículo principal para vivir las experiencias en este plano.Este es el principio de la analogía que nos da la posibilidad de entender la relación presente entre los distintos planos de existencia.<br>  Cuando llevamos este principio al nivel humano, podemos modificar las palabras y decir: "Como adentro es afuera; como afuera es adentro". Todo lo que sucede alrededor de una persona refleja lo que le está ocurriendo por dentro. Esto significa que cuando una persona es desordenada con sus cosas, está demostrando su desorden interno. Por el contrario, quienes están en el otro extremo y son muy rígidos con el orden están reflejando una rigidez mental en sus ideas. Lo de adentro es como lo de afuera y viceversa.<br>  Si se analizan las condiciones de vida que rodean a una persona determinada, se puede saber qué es lo que tiene en su mente. Las personas estructuradas lo son también mentalmente, del mismo modo, aquellos que se comportan de una manera caótica o contradictoria, tienen ideas de ese tipo. Puedes opinar lo que quieras aunque no tengo a nadie en el mundo a un creo en el amor no en la compania por favor atrevete a contestar|`|SP54Dw1oaa	Yo necesito mucho de la gente, pero la gente no necesita de mi para mi desgracia<br>  Si conoces algun hombre mayor como yo, no dudes en presentarmelo|`|VmWKzyLUaa	Yo estoy contigo en lo de la gran mentira, no necesitamos de nadie, la verdad teveo muy independiente y pienso que hoy tus intereses son otros diferentes a la socializacion, estaras sacando adelante una carrera y forjandote en algun area especifica que elegiste, conosco algunas chicas como tu grandes profesionales y atractivas.

Saludos. chica y de verdad mucha suerte.|`|d68538730c72d2d83ead4bfe94f29aa4aa	para responder en un principio de forma clara tu pregunta, te tengo q decir q no tiene nada q ver lo q vos atraigas que la atraccion q vos sentis. Asi como vos decis q te pasa eso, a alguna persona le puede pasar exactamente lo contrario, le gustan todas las personas y nadie gusta de ella. Si esta persona preguntase PORQUE a el q le gustan todas le viene a pasar eso, entonces la gente le responderia que se deje de molestar.<br>  <br>  Aun asi, se que lo que preguntabas no iba por ese lado. <br>  La cuestion acerca de porque no te atraen otras personas esta muy relacionado con lo que vos pensas de las parejas.<br>  Concuerdo contigo cuando decis que el ser humano es educado para necesitar. Y tambien cuando decis que tiene mucho q ver con la religion y la cultura. <br>  Ahora, si vos decis que TODOS los hombres son educados para necesitar, TODAS las culturas y TODAS las religiones sirven para eso, entonces ahi no estaria de acuerdo con vos. <br>  Obviamente todo esto se aplica al caso del amor en particular, pero es una cosa muy general. <br>  (quise resaltar esa parte de NO TODOS porque realmente el hombre puede ser educado de una forma diferente a la actual, y porque hay religiones que justamente van en contra de afianzar las necesidades del hombre)<br>  <br>  Ahora la verdadera cuestion aca es q no crees en el amor.<br>  Si estas hablando de esa concepcion de amor que dice "elemento que aparece en la relacion entre dos personas y q hace q se sientan muy bien estando juntos y q deseen estarlo y q es eterno y hermoso", bueno, yo tampoco creo en esa mierda. <br>  Pero, por otro lado, el amor (desde el unico punto q se lo conoce realmente) es una condicion de nuestra mentalidad, una condicion que no se conecta magimanete con la condicion de la otra persona ni ninguna boludes asi. El amor es algo que aparece y da fundamento y bienestar, pero aparece en una persona, no en dos. O sea, aparece un amor en una y otro amor en otra persona, el mismo amor, sentido por dos personas distintas. El amor no es necesidad, el amor es opcion. El amor no es una propiedad privada de las parejitas, el amor existe desde mucho antes de q un hombre se haya enamorado de una mujer. Amor se puede sentir debido a muchisimas cosas. <br>  Ahora, como el amor no es necesidad, lo q ella satisface nada tiene q ver con necesidades. <br>  Eso nos dice que todas aquellas personas que satisfacen necesidades por medio de las cosas que les brinda su pareja, no estan haciendo algo bueno ni para ellas, ni para sus parejas, no es amor eso q sienten, es solo la felicidad con "efe" minuscula q significa satisfaccion de necesidad, esta bien lejos de tener algo q ver con amor.<br>  como el amor es algo q sale o se manifiesta en uno y solo en uno, no tiene reglas estupidas como "solo se apunta a una persona" o "se vale dejar de lado la razon para seguir al corazon" y cosas asi, cuando una persona quiere dejar el sendero de la razon, es porque la atraccion que siente por la necesidad por cumplir es demasiado fuerte, o el demasiado debil.<br>  <br>  Ahora, para responder por fin tu pregunta<br>  porque no te sentis atraida por ningun hombre? porque lograste madurar lo suficiente como para poder elevarte por encima de tus necesidaddes pero todabia no lo suficiente como para comprender que hay muchas cosas mas para hacer y lograr que trascienden el terrenal y trivial mundo de las necesidades.|`|2DvAmP8eaa	Hola amiga!! Sabes?? te comprendo porque ahce unos meses yo pensaba igual... Y la verdad es que a veces uno se mete ideas en la cabeza que termina uno mismo por convencerse de ellas, pero finalmente me puse a ver que el mundo de por sí es demasiado complejo para hacerlo más complejo d elo que es con una actitud presimista frente a las cosas que de verdad me hacen sentir bien... En el caso tuyo, dices que no te sientes atraída por nadie, pero yo pienso que es un problema más de actitud tuya que lo que de verdad piensan tus chicos a tu alrededor, es decir, quizás los chicos que te miran piensan que eres linda y que tendrían una linda relación contigo, pero tu quizás no te has dado la posibilidad de averiguarlo al invitarlos a salir a bailar o a algún otro plan... Yo pienso que en la vida ya tenemos mucho desgaste con la cantidad de raciocinio que le debemos poner cada día a los negocios, nuestro trabajo, etc.... Pienso que a veces vale la pena asumir ciertos riesgos si estamos tras la búsqueda de nuestra felicidad... Por eso, no te preocupes, disfruta la vida y si eres atractiva, seguro que tienes quien esté enamorado de ti.. Un abrazo!!!|`|7Idiyrecaa	Totalmente de acuerdo.  Hay demasiada metafísica en eso del amor, romanticismo ?o?o y mal entendido. Algunas personas nacemos completas, es decir, no necesitamos complementos ni complementariedad para ser felices;. Hay poca gente que comprenda que haya gente que prefiera no  tener pareja a estar con alguien porque sí, porque ya toca o porque es lo que hace todo el mundo. Hay demasiado determinismo socio-biológico de anuncio de exterminador de cucarachas: naces, creces, registras tu hipoteca, te reproduces, te aburres y te mueres. Yo personalmente no lo acepto. Tengo tu edad y me pasa lo que a ti, en cuanto me intereso por una persona (más allá del sexo, algo realmente raro), enseguida descubro que lo que quiere es que la hagan feliz, no ser feliz junto a alguien (eso de "no te necesito para ser  feliz, simplemente me gusta estar contigo, sin más...")  Las personas se han desentendido de sí mismas como generadoras de su propia felicidad,-ya no es cosa de uno mismo-, siempre esperan que la felicidad llegue de fuera... por eso necesitan tanto...  Y a mi, tanta pasividad, aceptación y dependencia me aburren...|`|972fc1f9a2fd5e7034804cfc9af0de14aa	eso lo dices ahora que tienes 29, pero ya verás cuando tengas 40 y estes sola y sin haber disfrutado la dicha de tener un hijo. Yo creo que tu problema es que no me haz conocido a mi :-). Animo.|`|Ro2Q93Cqaa	De seguro has tenido malas experiencias en la vida. <br>  Y sobre todo del tipo amorosas. <br>  <br>  Pero creo que cuando dices "tengo 29 a?os y no creo en el amor" deberías agregar que es amor en pareja, a menos que seas un robot sin sentimientos y puedas tener una vida sin amor. <br>  <br>  Pues si has descubierto lo que es hacer el amor, y no te ha gustado, entonces no tienes necesidad de estar con alguien que te acompa?e. <br>  Simplemente saber que vas a llegar a tu casa y ahí alguien que piensan en ti. O que piensas en esa persona es suficiente para sentir un sentimiento hermoso por otra persona. <br>  <br>  Y creo que la que no acepta que esta influenciada por la iglesia y los medios de comunicación eres tu, es muy raro hoy en día alguien que no se sienta influenciado de ningún modo. <br>  Quien dijo que para que te sientas atraída por alguien tienes que ser atractiva o viceversa, esa persona tiene que ser atractiva? Si sabes lo que es estar enamorado de una persona, sabes que eso no respeta fisico de ningun tipo. <br>  <br>  En mi opinión pues claro que si se puede!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Yo no le recomiendo la practica de esto a nadie, <br>  PERO COMO ESTE ES UN SITIO DE RESPUESTAS!!!<br>  <br>  Nota: Releyendo lo que acabo de escribir parece un rega?o, no es esa mi intención por si las dudas|`|TTpUIdNpaa	Me pregundo amiga en que te queda creer si no es en el amor. No veo que tiene que ver el amor con la iglesia, ni con la necesidad, el amor no es una necesidad, es un estado de plenitud del alma, que puedas experimentar no solo con las personas. Tu eres el amor, y a veces quiza encuentres en quien verte como en un espejo, o en algo a menudo. De si necesitas alguien que te acompa?e, te has preguntado de si realmente nadie te acompa?a, seguramente tienes a tus amigos y a tu familia. El amor no trata de acompa?ar a uno sentado, sino a un caminante. Luego si crees que todo esto es una mentira, ?donde esta la verdad? A veces negamos para encerrar a la verdad, dónde esta tu verdad? Quiza te guies por las letras de la palabra, y no su significado. En el otro caso, aceptando de que no creas en el amor, de ser que estes en paz con esa idea tuya, no sentirias la necesidad de interrogarte acerca de ello, no habra la menor duda de que es asi, y tampoco comentarlo o sobresaltarlo a los demas. Luego no veo que tiene que ver el ser atractivo con el encontrar tu alma gemela. Cuando uno razona sus sentimetos, emborrona a estos.|`|afFMnvNiaa	Nadie niega que este mundo sea una porquería, ?no crees que sería menos malo si alguien estuviera a tu lado?|`|e06d99817f634a4f59939b90eb6c8f84aa	Hola..<br>  <br>  -Si eres atractiva, ..con exactitud no es ese el problema, lo mas probable es que sea tu actitud o forma de ser,  la  que este fallando....-porque tal vez, seas una persona con un buen nivel de personalidad y te sientas muy segura de ti misma.....y nose....tal vez eso haga que te veas kmo ......<br>  <br>  -No necesito a nadie ..algo asi....-Y eso hace que espantes a los hombres.....<br>  <br>  -Solo espera, que ya llegara el hombre valiente que se te necesite...y ahy creeras en el amor...<br>  <br>  Bye|`|rYC5CtJLaa	El hecho de querer estar con alguien es una necesidad de los humanos, date cuenta los bebes no tienen consiensia de politica, religion pero se acercan a otros bebes, sobre el mundo, da asco

Esta obra proporciona al lector una fuente imprescindible para el conocimiento de los orígenes de la civilización clásica. <br>  <br>  Los principales personajes de la obra -Aquiles, Paris, Menelao, Agamenón, Héctor, Odiseo<br>  <br>  Argumento:<br>  <br>  Aquiles se pelea con Agamenón, el rey aqueo, porque este le quita a una esclava. Por esta razón Aquiles deja de luchar. Aquiles le pide a Zeus que haga que los aqueos pierdan. Después de esto los troyanos les empiezan a dar una paliza a los aqueos. El mejor amigo de Aquiles, Patroclo, pelea en nombre de Aquiles y muere a manos de Héctor por lo que Aquiles se pone triste. Entonces Aquiles va y mata a Héctor por venganza y arrastra su cuerpo alrededor de Troya. Priamo reclama el cuerpo de Héctor y lo entierra.<br>  <br>  Aquiles: él es hijo de Peleo y de Tetis la diosa del mar. Es el mejor guerrero aqueo. Le habían dicho que tenía la opción de luchar contra los troyanos y morir joven o no luchar y vivir una larga vida. él decidió luchar.<br>  <br>  Agamenón: él es el aqueo principal. Es el jefe pero no el mejor guerrero. Su hermano Menelao está casado con Helena.<br>  <br>  Menelao: Hermano de Agamenón y rey de Esparta. Está casado con Helena y su honor es la razón por la cual pelean los aqueos.<br>  <br>  Helena: Ella es la chava por la que empezó la guerra de Troya. La diosa Afrodita se la regalo a Paris porque el votó por Afrodita como la diosa más bella del Olimpo, con esto empezó la guerra. A ella como que no le gusta mucho Paris.<br>  <br>  Alejandro (Paris): él es el príncipe de Troya, hijo de Priamo y hermano de Héctor. Por su culpa empezó la guerra. Es un ni?o bonito que prefiere estar en la cama que peleando.<br>  <br>  Héctor: él es hijo de Priamo y Hécuba, esta casado con Andrómaca, es hermano de Paris, y el mejor guerrero troyano. él es el troyano bueno. Su hermano Paris es el causante de la guerra y Héctor lucha por él. Es buen padre y esposo y además es muy agradable.<br>  <br>  Priamo: Rey de Troya.<br>  <br>  Hécuba: Mamá de Héctor<br>  <br>  Andrómaca: Esposa de Héctor.<br>  <br>  Odiseo: Guerrero aqueo que se supone es muy astuto. él es el personaje personal de la Odisea, también escrita por Homero.<br>  <br>  Ayax: Hay dos de estos tipos. Son aqueos. Cuando se refieren a los dos les llaman Ayaces. él más importante se llama Telemonio Ayax, hijo de Telemón, Ayax el Grande, o Gran Ayax. Es realmente un guerrero supremo, a pesar de no recibir ayuda de los dioses les gana a todos.<br>  <br>  Diomedes: él es otro guerrero aqueo. A él lo ayuda mucho la diosa Atenea.<br>  <br>  Néstor: él es un guerrero aqueo, no es tan joven y dirige a las tropas sabiamente.<br>  <br>  Patroclo: El mejor amigo de Aquiles. Cuando lo matan, Aquiles se involucra de nuevo en la lucha.<br>  <br>  Afrodita: La diosa del amor. Ella apoya a los troyanos porque fue quien le dijo a Paris que se llevara a Helena.<br>  <br>  Apolo: Dios del sol. él empieza la pelea entre Agamenón y Aquiles. Está de parte de los troyanos.<br>  <br>  Ares: Dios de la guerra. Representa al espíritu de la guerra y usualmente ayuda a los troyanos.<br>  <br>  Atenea: Diosa de la sabiduría. Ella apoya a los aqueos porque Paris dijo que Afrodita era la diosa más hermosa.<br>  <br>  Hefesto: él es el Dios del fuego y herrero de los dioses. Construyó la armadura de Aquiles y lo ayuda a salvarse cuando lucha con el dios de un río.<br>  <br>  Hera: Esposa de Zeus. Hera apoya a los aqueos porque Paris dijo que Afrodita era la más bella de las diosas.<br>  <br>  Poseidón: Dios del mar. él está de lado de los aqueos. Es hermano de Zeus.<br>  <br>  Tetis: Mamá de Aquiles.

G0wo8ueLaa	My favorite Hemingway book is probably Old Man and The Sea.  The entire book is so wrought with symbolism and open to any number of interpretations, which is precisely the reason I love great literature.  Peel back the layers...<br>  <br>  But I also love Hemingway's short stories, especially the safari stories set in Africa.  He was a prolific writer of short stories, and I have found that his writing in these small doses tends to be even more beautiful than in his longer works.  I had a collection of his entire works when I was in college and would often choose a short story to read before bed.  I highly recommend the practice...<br>  .|`|AA10119197	Old Man and the Sea|`|5zzaYputaa	"A Clean Well-LIghted Place" I liked the setting and the plot.

It was initiated in 1960 by a Lower Manhattan Association created and chaired by David Rockefeller, who had the original idea of building the Center, with strong backing from the then-New York governor, his brother, Nelson Rockefeller.[2] The World Trade Center, New York, like most all World Trade Centers located around the globe, belonged to the family of World Trade Centers Association. Larry Silverstein held the most recent lease to the complex, the Port Authority having leased it to him in July 2001.[3] The complex, located in the heart of New York City's downtown financial district, contained 13.4 million square feet (1.24 million m2) of office space, almost four percent of Manhattan's entire office inventory.[4]<br>  <br>  Best known for its iconic 110-story twin towers, the World Trade Center was beset by a fire on February 13, 1975 and a bombing on February 26, 1993. Despite the first two disasters, the World Trade Center was a part of New York City's identity and was recognized all over the world as an icon for the United States of America.<br>  <br>  All of the original buildings in the complex were destroyed in the September 11, 2001 attacks. One World Trade Center (1 WTC) and Two World Trade Center (2 WTC)—the North Tower and South Tower, respectively, collapsed, as did 7 World Trade Center (7 WTC).<br>  <br>  The Marriott World Trade Center (3 WTC) was crushed by the collapses of 1 WTC and 2 WTC. 4 World Trade Center (4 WTC), 5 World Trade Center (5 WTC), and 6 World Trade Center (6 WTC) were damaged beyond repair and later demolished. In addition, St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church (not part of the complex) was destroyed by the collapse of 2 WTC; the Deutsche Bank Building was damaged beyond repair and is set for deconstruction.

l1VZkkOSaa	The dates are usally given as c. 3150 BC to c. 30 BC. Interest is generally focused on the three main periods below (each period had its own reasons for going into decline).<br>  -----------------------------<br>  Old Kingdom: c. 2650 BC - c. 2134 BC<br>  <br>  "Along with the rising importance of a central administration arose a new class of educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples to ensure that these institutions would have the necessary resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. By the end of the Old Kingdom, five centuries of these feudal practices had slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, who could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150 BC, ultimately caused the country to enter a 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period."<br>  -----------------------------<br>  Middle Kingdom: 2040 BC - 1640 BC<br>  <br>  "The last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom, Amenemhat III, allowed Asiatic settlers into the delta region to provide a sufficient labor force for his especially active mining and building campaigns. These ambitious building and mining activities, however, combined with inadequate Nile floods later in his reign, strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later 13th and 14th dynasties. During this decline, the foreign Asiatic settlers began to seize control of the delta region, eventually coming to power in Egypt as the Hyksos."<br>  --------------------------<br>  New Kingdom: c. 1550 BC - 1070 BC<br>  <br>  "The 18th Dynasty ended when its last three kings—Tutankhamun, Aye, and Horemheb—all died without an heir. Ramesses II, also known as Ramesses the Great, ascended the throne around 1279 BC at the age of 18 and built more temples, erected more statues and obelisks, and sired more children than any other pharaoh in history. A bold military leader, Ramesses II led his army against the Hittites in the Battle of Kadesh and, after fighting to a stalemate, finally agreed to the first recorded peace treaty around 1258 BC. Egypt's wealth, however, made it a tempting target for invasion, particularly by the Libyans and the Sea Peoples. Initially, the military was able to repel these invasions, but Egypt eventually lost control of Syria and Palestine. The impact of external threats was exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb robbery and civil unrest. The high priests at the temple of Amun in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth, and their growing power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period."<br>   ----------------------<br>  The dates given for the three periods don't match up with the general dates I gave at the top because historians include the time before the Old Kingdom when stirrings of civilation have been found; and they include the time after the New Kingdom until Egypt became a Roman province in 30 BC.<br>  ---------------------<br>  Excuse the long answer - but hope it helps! :)
bvOh6OYYaa	Pues mas o menos, el desarrollo del libro fue bueno, sobre todo la fricción de los personajes principales pero me imaginé que la lucha entre harry y voldemort sería mas impresionante, nose me pareció muy simple y el epilogo fue pésimo nos arrastraron bruptamente 19 a?os despúes así de la nada!!!! y los fans se quedaron con muchas dudas que la propia Rowling no puede responder. que pena tanto tiempo de espera desperdiciado|`|0V36PSvvaa	no, a mi me gusto mucho<br>  principalmente porque ya no van a la escuela y es como todo diferente, mas aventuras<br>  de todas formas el final no fue lo que esperaba|`|9c34bc0fcce036bf0b7a05a1df7b85cfaa	a mi me encanto! excepeto x el épílogo, no se si lo hizo al ahí se va, si no quería hacerlo o q pasó pero no me gustó y tampoco la muerte de mi novio Fred, ah como llore cuando me lo mataron y de la manera mas idio.ta posible.|`|w48KFwi4aa	a mi me gusto, exepto el final, la verdad le pudieron haber puesto algo mejor, aun asi aprendi que para quejarme de otros primero tengo que tratar de entederlos|`|KR6xQwqraa	Cuestión de opiniones. Obviamente iban a resultar muchos decepcionados, la mitad de los fans querían un final sakeasperiano, en el cual Harry se muriera (y se quedara muerto), la otra mitad esperábamos que viviera y tuviera lo que más deseaba en el mundo: Una familia.<br>  <br>  Aunque sí te acepto que me decepcionó la trama, muchas "vida y mentiras de Albus Dumbledore" y pocos mortífaogs torturados.<br>  <br>  También esperaba una especie de mini-libro por cada horcrux destruído|`|MqefkDP9aa	Pues, el libro me lo leí en dos días porque me encanta Harry Potter... Hay partes muy interesantes, pero lo que no me gusta es que hay varias cosas como muy tiradas de los pelos. Por ejemplo, el que Hermione grite "Accio Libros sobre Horrocruxes" y consiga el que necesita de la oficina de Dumbledore... Me parece que Rowling abusa (en cierta forma) de la magia para salir rápido del paso en situaciones que terminan siendo un poco tontas. No sé, es mi opinión.<br>  <br>  Ah, y no me gustó que Harry viva. El final perfecto habría sido Harry descubriendo que tenía que morir y pidiéndole a Ginny que lo mate. Eso habría sido súper! jajaja Drama, y lágrimas para todos =oD|`|bbf0b2eb588d991076ef4d9a4569ea57aa	Pues a mí me encató. Narrativamente está muy bien armado y la Rowling manejó muy bien la historia de manera que pudiera darle gusto comercial a los lectores. Esto último puede ser ciriticable, pero no hay que olvidar que, después de todo, J.K. Rowling no es virginia Woolf, ni Harry Potter Mrs. Dalloway, así que, inteligente movimiento de la mujer.<br>  Ycomo fan a mi me encató el epílogo.Lloré a mares al saber el nombre del hijito de Harry.|`|iFHDqF2Haa	a mi si me gusto, es mas creo q jkrowling termino la historia como todos creerian que iba a acabar no como ella queria hacerlo inicialmente.|`|jmOHvRyOaa	Hola! a mí si me gustó. Pero he leído muchas opiniones como la tuya. Pienso que la historia generó muchas expectativas entre jóvenes casi adultos y que terminó como una historia para ni?os, por eso puede ser que les decepcionó. Saludos!!!|`|U1Bb1wRFaa	A mi encanto el libro, a exepcion del epilogo, que un poco corto, sin embargo el libro lo cncidero el mejor de los 7 ya que esta cargado de mucha accion y aventura....|`|49c0265a26e162c28f6c5af9afd96c9aaa	A mi en lo personal me enkanto era el final feliz k Harry se merecia, si un tanto infantil pero por algo fue catalogado desde el inicio como "libro para ni?os" <br>  <br>  Y el epilogo me agrado era todo como debia ser!
YZ34p33Uaa	"Wait Until Dark" is a great thriller; it scared the pants off me when I saw it. And of course there's the stage versions of "Dracula" and "Frankenstein," and "Macbeth" could be considered horror.<br>  <br>  Also, the comedies "Arsenic and Old Lace" and "Bell, Book, and Candle" have some horror-like themes.|`|C5NSFNs7aa	What about the legendary ''Phantom of the Opera''.<br>  This is a must when it comes to horror plays.<br>  Another is ''The Curse of the Golden Flowers'',it is a  thriller. It has a movie out also. Alot of action and misconception in this 1|`|AA11594069	There is a stage adaptation of Night of the Living Dead, based on the classic zombie flick.|`|Mig6O93Naa	The scariest play I ever read is The Innocents, a ghost story par excellence.

0GZnUyRLaa	For illustration and graphic work the ideal surface illustration board hot pressed (it has a significantly smoother than cold press) or even a heavy weight hot press watercolour paper ( 140 lbs or 300lbs), a heavy weight surface will prevent warping/ rippling. As for paint, gouache all the way. It is very similar to watercolour, except that it is opaque (not transparent). Some brands of gouache are Windsor Newton and Turners.|`|0bbv97tVaa	Rich Art is about the best that I've found.  As for a support, it depends on what you are doing.

Es "sospechosamente" asombroso ver como corremos detras de  tan "rudimentarios bichitos"..........<br>  Hoy el mundo demanda soluciones rápidas, una suerte de pronto delivery. A nadie le importa el origen del conocimiento ni de las ciencias, se requieren  respuestas inmediatas a deseos no ya a necesidades y esas respuestas son accesibles solo a los que las pueden pagar: "las leyes del mercado son inflexibles"<br>  Mi respuesta sin duda, no es muy alentadora, pero te aseguro que no implica un "asi son las cosas", por el contrario es una suerte de llamado para intentar modificarlas.<br>  Pido disculpas por lo extenso de la respuesta y por repetirme, o copiarme insistente, ya que a otras preguntas relacionadas con lo tecnològico he contestado de la misma forma.

Son válidos cuando son verdaderos. Por verdadero puede entenderse el conocimiento que concuerda con la realidad a la cual se refiere.<br>  <br>  Ahora bien, esta validez no ha de ser parcial, relativa a un lugar y tiempo determinados, sino que por el contrario, la spiración del saber cient′?ifico es que sus datos sean ciertos universalmente, o sea en todo tiempo y en todo lugar.<br>  <br>  c) Conocimiento generalizados.- Conocimiento general es el que se refiere a un conjunto indeterminado de objetos o fenómenos que tienen caracteres similares. General es lo contrario de particular. El conocimiento particular sí se dirige a una o varias cosas concretas, determinadas. En cambio el general sin aludoir a ningún objeto concreto abarca todo el grupo indefinido de cosas que reúnan cualidades análogas. Para llegar al conocimiento general se requiere que la mente efectúe un proceso de ABSTRACCIóN.<br>  <br>  La abstracción es un fenómeno que consiste en separar mentalmente las cualidades percibidas en uno o varios objetos semejantes y pensar dichas cualidades independientemente de cualquier objeto concreto.<br>  <br>  d) Referentes a una rama particular del saber.- De no ser así, estaríamos frente a la Filosofía que tiene como objeto material de estudio "todas las cosas".<br>  <br>  e)Ordenados sistemáticamente.- Los conocimientos que componen una ciencia han de estar ordenados, articulados entre sí, guardando relaciones mutuas: de coordinación (mismo rango de importancia), de supraordinación (rango superior) y de subordinación (rango inferior).|`|JY4HpH8naa	Pienso que es una porqueria que nos a salvado la vida a millones de humanos,plantas,animales o cualquier forma de vida.<br>  <br>  o tambien que es lo que mas te puede servir en la vida... <br>   <br>  pd: no me gusta estudiar ciencia pero si me salvo de algo o me salvara mejor la estudio|`|KVJXMk38aa	La ciencia es la manera de demostrar algo para que sea aceptado por todos y no se cuestione su particularidad.|`|qe6mXqrcaa	La ciencia nació cuando el hombre hizo lo  mismo, la ciencia se puede comprobar, al utilizar el cerebro nos llevó a crear criticas y disciplina hacia cualquier cosa, desde como utilizar una herramienta hasta ejercer un deporte.|`|suvSGqcWaa	Es el saber metódico, supuestamente comprobable.-|`|vkHETpVoaa	La ciencia es lo mejor que pudo lograr el hombre es la capacidad principal que tiene nuestra especiee!

The only visitor who could have seen them, Herodotus, does not mention them.<br>  But something like them did exist up north at Nineveh, constructed by King Sennacherib.  We see them depicted in relief carvings.  Sennacherib reigned 705-681 BC so that's your maximum figure for construction time.

lXnXe2Roaa	Porque es el lema de los estados unidos.<br>  <br>  "In God We Trust" es el actual lema nacional de los Estados Unidos de NorteAmérica, y es también el lema del estado de Florida. Fue declarado así en el acto de Congreso en 1956. A pesar de la creencia de algunos de que este Acto, reemplazó un ya existente lema "E Pluribus Unum" que significa "Entre muchos, (está) Uno", la versión oficial de registros del Congreso dice: "En el tiempo presente los Estados Unidos no tienen lema nacional. El comité designa como el más apropiado "In God we Trust" para ser designado como lema nacional de los EUA"<br>  <br>  Ahora que no es lema nacional exclusivo de EUA, también lo es de Nicaragua. (En Dios Confiamos)<br>  <br>  E Pluribus Unum fue, de hecho, un lema de los tres que se votaron y aprobaron para el sello nacional en 1782, pero nunca se votó ni nada por ningún acto legislativo como lema nacional.<br>  <br>  Un posible origen es la versión final de "The Star-Spangled Banner" escrito en 1814 por Francis Scott Key. Tiempo después adoptado como el himno nacional de los Estados Unidos de América.  La canción contiene una de las primeras referencias conocidas a una variación de la misma frase "In God is our trust"<br>  <br>  También se enscuentra en la bandera de Georgia.

wN1oY7IRaa	Yes, I just read it recently.  I think it was very good, very engrossing.  It delves a lot deeper into what happened to Rambo in Vietnam, so you learn just what makes him tick and you can empathize with him even more.  Of course, it ends differently than the film but I don't think that's a secret.  If you like the movies you will enjoy the book.<br>  <br>  Happy reading!|`|472a0d9446fa81fc54a6f964a0297522aa	It is a decent novel, and you will be happy to know that even if you have seen the movie you will not know what is going on in the book|`|q3Ni3kKeaa	rambo dies in part 4
AA11489236	I read the Stephanie Plum books.  Some other funny mystery series are the Maggody (rhymes with raggedy) and the Claire Malloy series by Joan Hess.  Tamar Meyer's Den of Antiquity series is also pretty good.  You might enjoy Jill Churchill's Jane Jeffrey series also.  A good website for info on mystery series is stopyourekillingme.com
o5L8bfZRaa	No te pierdas la oportunidad de leerla porq la gracia está en cómo está escrita.<br>  Es una novela policial, en la q con las declaraciones de los testigos, podés ir reconstruyendo lo q ocurrió en realidad con "Rosaura" y su extra?o marido, el pintor Camilo Canegato. Cada testimonio te pinta de cuerpo entero a los personajes. El argumento es algo complejo (porq nada es como parece al principio) pero muy fácil y amena de leer.|`|13a0844c2cbbd8b3311d7eef75f2722aaa	Uy es una novelita buenísima. Hace a?os, pero muuuuuuuuuuuchos a?os que la leí. Es muy fácil de leer porque la trama es muy llevadera, mezcla de policial y de misterio. Muy buena, te la recomiendo, podés tardar como mucho 5 días en terminarla. Suerte!!!!!!!|`|nrKPMIrHaa	Es una novela buenísima. Obviamente, como toda literatura, depende mucho de la edad, y más que de la edad, de las lecturas previas, del ejercicio de la lectura que tengas. Tenés que saber escuchar los tonos.<br>  Se trata de un un grupo de personas (con una buena cantidad de manías) que viven en una pensión, en Bs. As., siglo XX. Uno de los personajes (Rosaura) ha muerto a manos de su marido. Supuestamente eso ha pasado. Y vos, lector, te vas enterando al escuchar la voz de los diferentes personajes, la VERSIóN de los diferentes personajes. Y ahí está la cosa de esta novela: en ver qué dicen, y con qué tono lo dicen. Hay una maestra jubilada, que vive allí, que es la más chusma de todos (de esas personas que mueren por saberlo todo de los demás). <br>  En fin: el lector debe armar la resolución con los datos que ofrecen los distintos testimonios. <br>  Que la disfrutes.|`|FAIIqdkiaa	<a href="http://apuntes.rincondelvago.com/rosaura-a-las-diez_marco-denevi.html" rel="nofollow">http://apuntes.rincondelvago.com/rosaura...</a>|`|MqefkDP9aa	Es una novela EXCELENTE!!! Básicamente trata de el misterio por un crimen que tiene que ser resuelto. Lo interesante es que toda la novela son las declaraciones de distintos personajes sobre este asesinato. Y es magistral cómo con la declaración de cada personaje vas descubriendo cosas nuevas, cosas distintas, y cómo la misma realidad, el mismo suceso, cambia por completo según la persona que lo cuenta. <br>  <br>  Y era esto justamente lo que quería dar a conocer el autor, que la realidad es demasiado compleja para comprenderla, y cada persona la "ve" o "comprende" de una manera personal. Un planteamiento bastante borgiano, sea dicho de paso. Léela!! ES SUPER!! Y el suspenso y el misterio son buenísimos!
MqefkDP9aa	Pues, la sinopsis suena interesante. He empezado a leer el capítulo 1 y me parece bueno. <br>  <br>  Algo que podría resaltarse es que el lenguaje suena bastante recargado, como muy formal. ?Es un efecto que voluntariamente estás buscando? Expresiones como "la tormenta que estaba haciendo acto de presencia",  me parecen bastante rebuscadas. Claro, que todo dependerá de lo que persigas como escritor y qué quieras comunicar.<br>  <br>  Mucha suerte! Seguiré leyendo y espero publiques toda la trilogía! :)|`|ih97xlqIaa	suena bien... parece ser novedoso, diferente...|`|vW5UvMgaaa	se oye excelente<br>  <br>  a checar el blog|`|52582ea8e4b322efde919817e3bb8730aa	Se oye muy interesante, estaré al pendiente.|`|cuStkcDAaa	con buena onda ?  o crudo nomas?

g92UnU5eaa	This is not enough storyline to come up with a title. <br>  Vampires, love triangle, revenge.  <br>  None of these are especially unique, so if you want a unique title you need to look deeper into the intricacies of your characters, your themes and imagery - what makes your story unique. Suggestions you get here will be generic for any vampire/romance story - and that's not unique, is it?<br>  I suggest finishing the book first if you haven't already, then taking a good long look at its deeper meanings.<br>  When I'm stuck for a title I usually try to find something one of my characters says which will be suitable.<br>  <br>  However, if you're writing this just for fun I suppose it doesn't matter too much, so I'll suggest Blood Ties, because of the ways the characters are tied together.<br>  <br>  Good luck finding the right title!|`|AA10541052	Here's a few that came to me:<br>  <br>  Blood Vindication<br>  Blood Hunter<br>  Edward's Retribution<br>  <br>  I hope these help.|`|124b8214eb664ed4dbd7ada2f92c942daa	I don't think you should use the name Edward, that is really confusing and personally I don't think Stephenie Meyer would appreciate it.

Bloodlust is a word that means desire for blood, so I thought that made sense...hope you like it...good luck writing your story!<br>  <br>  You can add a space between Blood and Lust or keep it as Bloodlust or make the L capital like I did. I kind of like the BloodLust one best, though.

If so you need something that's kind but strong. I would recommend either “As Long As He Needs Me” from Oliver! (It might be a little low but manageable) or “I'm Not Afraid of Anything” from Songs for a New World. Both reflect the character very well. A word of advice, ignore ANYONE who tells you to sing something from; Phantom of the Opera, Les Mis, Wicked, and High School Musical or a song from the show. I have be in musical theater for many years and taken classes from multiple professional Broadway actors and instructors and the all say the same thing, do not sing a song from any of those shows because they are all widely over done and directors are so sick of hearing them that they wont listen to your audition as closely and also if you sing something from the show you're auditioning for and your not exactly what the director envisioned then you've just shot yourself in the foot casting wise.

JsmfjBD0aa	Desde luego que leer los libros,hay una gran diferencia en leer y ver las películas,los libros te dan detalles que las películas en veces omiten,además en los libros todo es mucho mas explicito,en las películas en veces se inventan escenas que ni siquiera son parte del libro o cambian a los personajes de dichas escenas y muchas cosas mas que ni se ven en las películas,por eso si te gusta leer y tienes tiempo es mejor leerlos,después de eso,vas a quedar encantado con los libros y lo que aparece en las películas te va a parecer insuficiente,por no decir mas.|`|2e244051689436d193e99e54ada228d6aa	Los Libros.|`|Evc83uJZaa	Siempre un libro será mejor q una película basada en él, no importa el género.

kDohAlu8aa	Okay, you've got the communism thing down pretty well. We got involved with the Korean War, and the Vietnam War (don't forget that one, it started in 1959) to prevent communism. <br>  <br>  McCarthyism and the Red Scare were some of the main effects of this. A lot of US citizens were blacklisted and accused of being communist in the '50s. The "political climate" just means "what politics were like then". The answer to that is Nationalistic. America was very biased in the 50s. You were either a Capitalist, Born-in-America-Apple-Pie kind of person, or you were un-American<br>  <br>  The counter-culture, anti-war, hippie movement also started in the 1950s, in response to the wars that were being started.<br>  |`|fq4Mi0jPaa	Yeah, the US did become involved in Southeast Asia to try to limit the spread of communism. The Korean War was fought due to the fact that South Korea wanted to be Democratic and that North Korea wanted to unify Korea under a Communist government. <br>  <br>  Changed the political climate by McCarthyism, scare of commusnism in the U.S., increade in money (WWII ended), fear of russia, and so on.<br>  <br>  I would love to help more but i got my own hw to do.

They are realistic and I think and know he will achieve them.<br>  <br>  Jane reminds me of someone I know. They are both caring, naive and try to help others. <br>  <br>  Jane Eyre reminds me of Jane Bennet in Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. They are both caring, try to think the best of others and have strong morals.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :-)|`|2e244051689436d193e99e54ada228d6aa	The character who interests me much is Mr.Rochester. He dreams of a suitable wife as a good companion.He achieved his dream finally when he married Jane; though I do not think that getting a good wife was his only dream.<br>  <br>   Many characters in the book remind me of ordinary people around us; like Blanche Ingram, Rosamund Oliver and so on..But my answer would be Diana and Mary Rivers. They are like many of the normal, independent, wise girls I meet everyday!<br>  <br>   The character of St.John Eyre Rivers reminds me of Sydney Carton in "A tale of two cities". Both are involved in nonreciprocating love ; though I think Carton's love for Lucie Manette is more deep. <br>  <br>  <br>  
8078b060eeeeedad269ae982e11dfc38aa	Charles John Huffam Dickens,  7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870), pen-name "Boz", was one of the most popular English novelists of the Victorian era, as well as a vigorous social campaigner.<br>  <br>  Critics George Gissing and G. K. Chesterton championed Dickens's mastery of prose, his endless invention of unique, clever personalities, and his powerful social sensibilities, but fellow writers such as George Henry Lewes, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf faulted his work for sentimentality, implausible occurrences, and grotesque characterizations.<br>  <br>  The popularity of Dickens's novels and short stories has meant that they have never gone out of print. Many of Dickens's novels first appeared in periodicals and magazines in serialized form—a popular format for fiction at the time—and, unlike many other authors who completed entire novels before serial production commenced, Dickens often composed his works in parts, in the order in which they were meant to appear. Such a practice lent his stories a particular rhythm, punctuated by one minor "cliffhanger" after another, to keep the (original) public looking forward to the next instalment.<br>  |`|2e244051689436d193e99e54ada228d6aa	Charles Dickens is one of the most popular English novelists.His memorable works include 'Great Expectations' ,' Oliver Twist' ,' David Copperfield' etc..I don't think he writes anymore.

It is too much like it and definitely won't do as good. I'm not trying to put you down for your ideas.. but half of your ideas seem to be Stephenie Meyer. Try to make it a little more original. You don't want to end up re-writing her books.|`|5eoO6qosaa	I vote for Bitten Love, because both have been bitten. Or how about Dark Full Moon Love, because the  werewolf turns during the full moon, and the vampire would be out in the darkness.  Or can the vampire bite the werewolf, making her a vampire also?

One time I was in the bus on my way to school and we almost ran a red light and somehow this just zapped a song idea into my head.  My dad gave me a good concept once, and another time I was playing and I snapped a string and this gave me another cool idea.  it's all really random.<br>  <br>  For guitar lines, I usually play a song I already know and 'veer off course'.  Basically just mess around.
5GiAYBmjaa	Impossible by Nancy Werlin- Lucy Scarborough has spent her life with her adoptive parents because her mother, Miranda, is insane. Lucy manages to lead an eminently normal life interspersed with occasional random visits from Miranda, who is never really lucid beyond mumbling strange lyrics to "Scarborough Fair." But when prom night turns disastrous for Lucy it sets into motion an unbelievable chain of events and they all lead back to Miranda and an awful curse the Scarborough women have suffered under for centuries. Soon Lucy is rushing to beat the devil and save herself from insanity and her unborn daughter from sharing her unbearable fate. She is accompanied on this endeavor by her childhood friend Zack and her adoptive parents Leo and Soledad. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins (this one has a little romance and a lot of action, but it's still an amazing book)- In a country obsessed with television, Katniss Everdeen is chosen to participate in the Hunger Games, a televised game show where only one can win, while the others lose their lives. Katniss and her partner from her district, Peeta Mellark, must try to survive against all the other contestants to make it back home.<br>  <br>  The Sookie Stackhouse (or Southern Vampire) Series by Charlaine Harris (this one is a little more mature... I'd say about 16+)- Sookie Stackhouse lives in a small rural Louisiana town working as a bar waitress. Her life gets much more complicated when she meets Bill Compton, a vampire, and gets sucked into an unknown world of shifters, werewolves, vampires, and fairies. This was also made into an amazing television show called "True Blood."<br>  <br>  Anahita's Woven Riddle by Meghan Nuttall Sayres- Teenager Anahita, a nomad living in early-20th-century Persia, has been promised to the khan, or chief, of her tribe. This man, whose three previous wives have mysteriously died, is considerably older than she is, and she wants nothing to do with him. She convinces her father to let her choose her own husband by having potential mates solve a riddle that she has woven into her wedding carpet. Doing so goes against Muslim principles and causes controversy within the tribe, and trouble for them, as the khan exacts his revenge by taking away their migratory and water rights. Despite these circumstances, Anahita's father agrees to continue with the competition. The main contenders-the khan, a schoolteacher, a shepherd, and a prince-all play an important role in Anahita's life. She finds it difficult to go through with the contest, only knowing whom she does not want to marry, but an unexpected twist forces her to choose. This is an engrossing story that weaves in Persian culture, history, and surroundings, and portrays the life of a unique young woman and her quest for love.<br>  <br>  The Mediator Series by Meg Cabot- Suze Simon isn't a normal teenage girl. She can see and feel ghosts. When her mom gets remarried and she moves to California, the last thing she expects is to find a smoking hot 19th century man living in her bedroom.<br>  <br>  East by Edith Pattou- In the rural villages of Norway, there is an ancient belief that children inherit the qualities of the direction in which they are born. Nymah Rose, the last daughter of eight siblings born to a poor mapmaker and his superstitious wife, was a North-born baby. It is said that North-born babies are wild, unpredictable, intelligent, and destined to break their mothers' hearts because they all leave hearth and home to travel to the far ends of the earth. To keep her close, Rose’s mother lied and told her she had been born of the obedient and pliable East. But destiny cannot be denied. One day, a great white bear comes to the mapmaker’s door to claim Rose’s birthright.<br>  <br>  Woops! Almost forgot this one!- The Time Traveler's Wife by Audrey Niffenegger (this ones a little more mature also, but it's going to being made into a movie)- On the surface, Henry and Clare Detamble are a normal couple living in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood. Henry works at the Newberry Library and Clare creates abstract paper art, but the cruel reality is that Henry is a prisoner of time. It sweeps him back and forth at its leisure, from the present to the past, with no regard for where he is or what he is doing. It drops him naked and vulnerable into another decade, wearing an age-appropriate face. In fact, it's not unusual for Henry to run into the other Henry and help him out of a jam. Sound unusual? Imagine Clare Detamble's astonishment at seeing Henry dropped stark naked into her parents' meadow when she was only six. Though, of course, until she came of age, Henry was always the perfect gentleman and gave young Clare nothing but his friendship as he dropped in and out of her life.<br>  <br>  I highly suggest all of these books. :)|`|PtfaM7jEaa	twilight saga|`|pEDavW3caa	twilight saga by stephenie meyer<br>  <br>  gemma doyle trilogy by libba bray including:<br>  a great and terrible beauty<br>  rebel angels<br>  the sweet far thing<br>  <br>  the giver by lois lowry<br>  to kill a mockingbird by harper lee<br>  my sister's keeper by jodi picoult<br>  those are just good books to read

vmmMqhxXaa	The Dark Tower series blew me away.  I read the whole thing while I was on active duty for a year, and honestly, I think it saved me from brain rot.  <br>  <br>  One of my favorite King books is The Eyes of the Dragon, which takes place in the kingdom of Delain from The Dark Tower series.  This book is different from anything else King has ever written.  If you haven't read it, you should.<br>  <br>  The first King book I ever read, almost 30 years ago, was Salem's Lot.  I had to reread it when Father Callahan reappeared in Wolves of the Calla.  It was as good as I remembered.  (I didn't sleep well for a week.)|`|psn7Prigaa	I just finished Dark Tower yesterday, loved it. I will re-read it one day, not right now. A lot of people didn't like the ending, I did, I just wish there was an epilogue or something so we can find out if anything was different.<br>  <br>  Insomnia is my other favorite, I think it's essential to the Dark Tower series, it definitely gives more insight on the Crimson King, and the different "levels" of the Tower. I totally wouldn't have understood that if I didn't read Insomnia.|`|YBQHAbOIaa	I've read all 42 novels & cant say "the Towers " are the best , sorry.<br>  <br>  My fave is - The Talisman with Peter Straub

kZzasq1laa	In Greek mythology, Eumaeus, or Eumaios (Ε?μαιο?), was Odysseus's swineherd and friend before he left for the Trojan War. He was brought up with Odysseus and his sister Ctimene as a family slave, although he was treated by Anticleia, their mother, almost as Ctimene's equal. In Homer's Odyssey, Eumaeus is the first mortal that Odysseus meets after his return to Ithaca. Although he does not recognise his old master—Odysseus is in disguise—and has his misgivings, Eumaeus treats him well, offering food and shelter to what he thinks is a mere indigent. On being pushed to explain himself, Odysseus spins a distorted tale, misleading Eumaeus into believing that he is the son not of Laertes but of Castor.|`|9rekPBIdaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eumaeus" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eumaeus</a>

HzkRpjhEaa	Go to college and get your degree in English.  You'll need college anyway to get hired, and you will be amazed at the things you learn from decent English classes at the college level.  By the way, I specified a degree in English and not Journalism for a reason.  Odd as it may sound, most newspapers and such actually prefer that you major in English, not Journalism, because Journalism teaches one very specific way of writing that is not necessarily what you need to know once you're actually working.  What you really want to do is be an English major and take a few journalism classes and try to work for the college newspaper.  That's the best combination, as far as getting a job after school.<br>  <br>  The other thing I recommend is not only reading a lot, but reading some things that are different from whatever you normally read.  As far as vocabulary goes, I wouldn't be concerned.  While a decent vocabulary helps in all aspects of life, you're not going to be writing with lots of big words anyway because journalists need to write things that the average reader will understand.  As long as you have at least an average vocabulary, you should be fine.|`|1iXvphNYaa	Write down words you find interesting, look up their true meaning and use any number of them a few times a day whether it be talking to your friends, your pets or yourself. Peace.|`|dLo4kV5oaa	Reading will always be the best way to acquire vocabulary, but you can also try a step forward by writing that word and actually try using it in sentences a whole day; pick another word the next day. Make the dicctionary your best friend...sometimes when I'm bored I start looking for words, and find some very interesting!! Keep going, you'll be a great reporter!|`|9sSWlgeeaa	when you write it  down you're most likely to remember it. reading is not enough. try to underline difficult words and write them down in a copybook, find out its meaning and try to do at least 5 sentences using a particular word... keep a record of all the difficult words and use them in your works/blogs or just write an article even if you won't publish it.

xJoMSkI5aa	1. The concept that historians now call republicanism derived from a number of inspirations, notably the societies of ancient Greece and Rome.<br>  <br>  2.  Citizens (with the notable exception of slaves, who were not considered citizens) voluntarily subordinated their private interests to the common good.<br>  <br>  3. For eighteenth-century republicans, a person with "virtue" owned property, possessed an intrinsic sense of morality, and was willing to subordinate his own interests for the interests of the community; the public good.<br>  <br>  4. This country started as a republic; the question of how democratic it has since become is an open-ended debate that will carry on for some time.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Intellectual Roots of the American Revolution|`|Yy6P1JAwaa	actually the symbol for the republican party is an elephant.|`|CPsbc5yYaa	What is a republican government?<br>  The government of Rome was called a republican government. The Founders read that<br>  republican government was one in which:<br>  ? The power of government is held by the people.<br>  ? The people give power to leaders they elect to represent them and serve their interests.<br>  <br>  ? The representatives are responsible for helping all the people in the country, not just a few people.<br>  <br>  <br>  -The Republican Party's symbol is an elephant.

pdbc4souaa	I looked at all of them. You have an unusually  good sense of composition, your focus is good, I appreciate the fact that you are close enough to get a tight shot of your subject. Keep up the good work, don't be afraid to take a lot of pictures of a particular subject and always remember that it is impossible to take pictures and do anything else at the same time.<br>  <br>  Save money for a better camera. The detail will be more intense and people will respect you more if your equipment looks professional. Make your habit support itself.<br>  <br>  You might try your hand at shooting pictures of people as well.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that you need to spend about half of your time being an artist and the other half being a businessman if you want to make a living at it.|`|0Dj8pOgoaa	Out of focus, over/under exposure... lots of technically issues... sorry 1/10 - simple snap shots.... keep trying|`|xQ934l0Taa	Some shots are out of focus.

zrTBz8M6aa	Yep, they never live up to the books. I read a really good book called flowers in the attic, by Virginia Andrews then found they'd made it into a film and its shockin! This book is the 1st in the series but the way the film ends is totally wrong an cannot b carried on. Its a really bad film.<br>  I do think the same of the Harry Potter books, iv read em all an think there great, while i like the films its just not the same, they miss far too much of the story out.|`|2z1h5mfOaa	It really depends on what you want out of a book or out of a film.  They are very different media.  Books allow you to have your own view/perspective/imagination because it is not "dictated" to you by a visual medium like film.  So you can let your imagination run free and make your own thing about it.  <br>  A film is more restrictive in some ways because you are looking at what the actors do/say etc. which is an interpretation of the words, so you may find it either O.K. or not.  <br>  At the same time I have found some films bringing their own aspect to the story and made it veryt credible.  <br>  I think it depends on the director/producer of the film and how much their story differs from the original, and then it depends on you liking their interpretation of it.|`|vmmMqhxXaa	Not always.  In fact, I like to see the film version of a book, partly to scope out the differences.  It's interesting.  Occasionally, the film is even better (I felt that way about the Lord of the Rings trilogy.).|`|7v1wqeWDaa	Not exactly always, but generally they do... they leave out too much or they change it around too much...I agree with you|`|8QKgkOZfaa	i think the best example I can think of is the book Eragon being absolutely butchered by the people who directed the films. i wanted to kill myself it was so horrible, and not a single person I've met likes the movie over the book. Its just terrible.<br>  <br>  It all depends if you keep an open mind. sometimes its not so bad if you think that, perhaps, its just a different way to interpret whats going on, and how to add to your own opinions.<br>  <br>  Inkheart didn't ruin it when it became a movie, but it certainly could have been better.<br>  <br>  Twilight was fairly good. I enjoyed the movie, reguardless of what they changed and kept. The only real complaint is how they did the "meadow scene" when in the movie it was really on the side of a mountain. That was horrible.<br>  <br>  Harry Potter I thought stayed true to the books. I think they have done a good job, though no movie could beat the book. <br>  <br>  Yes, indeed, I think that movies ruin the reputations of the books on numerous if not most occasions. but not always. For instance: I liked the movie Chocolat better than the book. Though, I'm not sure which was 'better'.<br>  <br>  haha, sorry. I'm so tired, compiled with bored, which = long, rambling answers.|`|XAAF7R23aa	i prefer to read the books, but some films i find even though they do not follow the books exactly are excellent,  a case in point was the lord of the rings trilogy. I prefer to read the book first, but it must be difficult for the producer to portray the feelings etc of the characters in the same way in a film. You  should judge each one on its own merits, you might miss something you could have really enjoyed by closing your mind.lol|`|AA12181502	Yep, My first real killer was "The eagle has landed" by jack Higgins an fantastic novel with great characters. The movie was disappointing despite having a great cast(in its day)  Michael Caine didn't really portray my minds imagination of Oberst Kurt Stenier and Donald Sutherland's cheesy Irish accent did nothing for my perception of IRA hitman Liam Devlin.  I try and treat them (film and book) as two separate entities!|`|JCK4sKfPaa	Not always, but most of the time they do. The movies are NEVER as good as the books. I don't know why, but I still go see all the movies once I have read the books. I guess it's just fun to criticize the movie, or something.|`|z03coR1Oaa	not always some times the films seem rubbish when you've read the books but i must say i disagree about the harry potter films i think they were very well done and i can not wait for the next one.|`|52pZj3WFaa	No, read The Shining by Stephen King and watch the film and see which you prefer. (Personally, I thought the film was brilliant and the book was overblown with a disappointing ending).|`|INlDPJMVaa	occasionally. definitely don't watch twilight. Because, I thought the Harry Potter films did an okay job, but Twilight was awful, so I can't even imagine how awful you will find Twilight|`|u1t12bsAaa	I have often thought the same thing. especially when they take a fantastic story and totally change it.|`|K9laDjmGaa	Most of the time I read a book and find the movie really ruins what I thought of the book. When you read a book you picture the characters and the setting and then when u see the movie your characters get all mixed up because now when you think of them all you see is the person that was playing in the movie. I find that sometimes the movies of books does ruin it. But some movies are really good after reading the book. Also Twilight the book is soo much better then Twilight the movie.|`|387493774383e79967205158ff9bb074aa	I agree about the HP movies.<br>  I am a big HP fan but I boycotted the movies because they were ridiculous.<br>  I'm quite cautious when I see movies about books I love. I'm ready to turn off the movie at a moments notice if it's that bad.<br>  About the HP movies, as well being inaccurate I didn't find the cast members to fit the characters, like Sirius for example didn't even have black hair as described the book. I hate that.<br>  Sirius and Remus were not as hot as I imagined so I keep my own imagined characters in my head.<br>  In some of the HP movies I think it would have not even made sense in some parts unless you had read the book, especially when they showed Dumbledore's army was training, that was just... not good.<br>  There are some movies though like Pride and Prejudice where I don't have a problem with whom they cast for Mr.Darcy for example, he was quite hot. I have no problem imagining his dreamy face while re-reading that book.|`|q7JumPqjaa	depends how good the film is. i prefer it when they arent trying to be an excact dramatised copy actually, like fight club, triainspotting, gormenghast, american psycho, clockwork orange are a few which arent tmuch like the books but are both good books and films. the directors own interpretation and tribute to them, instead of just putting it all on screen.<br>  <br>  not so good films for good books a few examples: hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, jonny mnemonic, frankenstein, <br>  <br>  it does annoy me though to have not read the book first, because i then tend to look for comparisons in the film instead of concentrating on the story as much, and it doesnt stick as much as just an isolated story. but then as things like gormenghast after seeing the bbc production the book is so good still because it completely leaves it behind in its grotesque romanticism, while the series is still quite fun i.|`|uCS0AUquaa	It's for that very reason, Anne McCaffrey pulled the plug on a group that was going to produce her 'Dragonriders of Pern' series.<br>  <br>  She goes to great lengths to tell you that riders will not do anything that will endanger their dragons, who are bound to the rider - rider dies, so does the dragon.<br>  <br>  And yet, these people had them getting to senseless brawls and other things because it would heighten the action, or it should have been that way in the first place.<br>  <br>  Or,<br>  <br>  take 'Patriot's game'  The changes they made to the movie left very little resemblance to the book.<br>  <br>  1. attack takes place on British goverment official, in book - Charles and Diane.<br>  <br>  2. One of the settings was CIA building - should have been Annapolis<br>  <br>  3. boat blows up in Chesapeake bay by hitting a reef - are there even reefs in the bay?<br>  <br>  And I liked the movie as well as the book.|`|OCqs7yymaa	it depends.  if you are hoping the movie will always be just as you imagined everything in the book, you'll leave disappointed.  however, if you go into the film mindful of the fact that you're going to be watching something that is only loosely based on the book, you'll find that this is not the case.|`|vNDV3BMEaa	Yes! All the time!<br>  Harry Potter wasn't so bad, but I thought Twilight was completely wreaked. At the moment, I'm refusing to go and see Inkheart, but being me, I'll probably give up in a few weeks, watch in then spend ages moaning about how awful it was.<br>  Ahh well. <br>  I guess that some films just can't be portrayed through motion picture. But in most cases, the director has no idea what he/she is doing!<br>  God, it gets on my nerves!<br>  <br>  sdj x|`|fkTb2TiYaa	no but i can be kinda weird sometimes. I always watch the films. I've never found that the movie makes the book worse or anything. The only film that i've seen that was based off a book that totally bombed was eragon. And i like to criticize the movie writer ppl saying how they can't read and stuff when they mess something up in a book|`|fo5AsHYZaa	wise choice not seeing twilight it was a piece of s.h.i.t. just sayin.<br>  i was horrified at the fact that they sell "edward cullen body glitter" at hot topic now and i told my friend they probably used that on himin the movie. but yes. the only movie i found that followed the book was holes and that was amazing.<br>  :)|`|9b355e061fa6c3b030996f1809e2369aaa	Well....Books are always better. There's just not enough time in a movie to show all the details. When you read, your mind creates an elaborate picture with all the details provided. That's the pleasure of reading.|`|FocBqCqlaa	well, the films arnt as good as the books, but i still watch them, to see if its the same as i pictured. They dont ruin them, they just arnt as good, well some of them. ;)|`|Q1MmQHHmaa	it might ruin it. i thnk the book twilight was a hundred times better than the movie|`|c8lBbWtQaa	They dont ruin the book but they make me cross when they change things like locations  or names etc. they are supposed to be making a film of the book not re writing it to suit their own ends.|`|uq1GXvSdaa	movies dont ruin books after the movies the books  are still the same.<br>  <br>  what happens is that many book can be translated in to good movies<br>  and the most comon reason is time you can do justice to many books with a movie taht las one hour and a half to two hours.<br>  <br>  in movies yo have the screen writers doind the version they think is the best. and the the director change thing ant then the actors diced that his chacarter woulnd't do that, and the you have the studio executives.|`|15017428de404442efe6fff34a4dd6edaa	Sometimes. Bonfire of the Vanities is a classic example, hopelessly miscast and mucked about with!<br>  <br>  Even Lord of the Rings, visually stunning though it was, had completely unnecessary changes and additions.
7SbHfNKTaa	You're AMAZING...I am serious...THANK GOODNESS you picked up a camera otherwise the world would be missing out on some great shots.  I have done a couple of these yahoo answers, and I have NEVER seen anyone as great at photography as you.  Seriously...that picture of that little girl is magical...you caught her at a wonderful moment...it almost looks like she was running away...it looks like she has so much to tell, and yet she is so small...I don't know how you captured that.  I LOVE your lighting as well...is that a camera effect or how did you achieve that???  And the pictures of the faucet running make the water look so radiant and crystallized.  All I know is that I wish that I could take pictures like you.  Don't let anyone tell you you aren't good, because chances are if they are saying that...THEY ARE JEALOUS OF YOUR SKILLS!!! OVERALL---A+ stuff...NO LIE.|`|Z1i5a5bZaa	love your photos, i am just starting photograhy, but dont think i have the tallent you do, keep it up|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	You are doing exactly what a person should be doing when they get a new camera in their hands. You are pushing it to extremes and trying a bit of everything. Next you need to learn a bit about composition, but you have a great start here. BTW, I have a G10 in my purse at all times and it is a wonderful camera!|`|CkIeCNS4aa	I think you have a good eye and that the more you practice the better you will get.  Just follow your instincts and take a lot of different shots of the same subject matter.  Also, grab a bunch of books from the library on photography and read up on techniques, et cetera.|`|lb6jBcDiaa	wow those are really amazing<br>  the little girl is cute :)<br>  i love the beads one, the angle was amazing, how it started off blury then became clear<br>  really really amazing|`|bFWhuJbuaa	i like the water faucet one, but the rest are kinda boring, even though their good. i would add more elements to the photos and then i think theyd be great!|`|nr3sm3u5aa	amazing|`|86VgnUmQaa	No, they are very cool! I like them a lot!<br>  <br>  Neat perspective in my opinion.|`|Qnop8tkjaa	First Photo<br>      Dang! That's pretty good for a point and shoot camera. The only thing that I don't care for is the colors. I think it is too blueish green.<br>  <br>  Second photo:<br>      I love the angle. But it is a boring subject to me.<br>  <br>  Third Photo:<br>     I don't care for it at all. The background is terrible. The subject is the beads but some of them are blurred due to the depth of field. Since the heart is the subject, all of the beads need to be in focus.<br>  <br>  Fourth Photo:<br>    I can't believe that some people were making fun of a defenseless little 4 year old girl. She is very cute! The photo has a vintage feel to it. But the background sucks. I know how it is to have to chase kids around to get their photo! I do it for a living. <br>  <br>  Fifth Photo:<br>    Same answer as the first photo. But I do like the composition of this photo better. It does not show the rust colored part of the faucet.<br>  <br>  <br>  All in all, they are pretty good for your age. If you really love photography, take a few classes and get outside! Find some really interesting stuff to take photos of. I would love to see any outdoor shots if you have any.|`|eaf82079d386f1be514388360f3d4ae2aa	they're pretty nice<br>  water one is my fave<br>  <br>  check out my friend's photography<br>  he's 17 now, ithink<br>  and i think he's been at it for like a few years<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/akanekal/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/akanekal/</a><br>  <br>  idk what he does<br>  but his look awesome<br>  i think he uses different lens and stuff too|`|N5MjOIXsaa	They are ok, the one of the child was the best, but it would be better if she was doing something, and not just looking at the camera.<br>  <br>  I think you should try shooting more people and less inanimate objects.|`|fkgYL6TSaa	They're all mainly from the same shot .. try different angles. I love the first one ! Are they edited ?|`|LXJNeUmaaa	pretty goodd|`|eFkdCBjkaa	The faucet is cool, ...and I like your avatar.|`|lDO4O2FXaa	wow that's good. aww that's a cute pic of the g'rl =]|`|99NNTv6vaa	the faucet one is my favorite.<br>  <br>  all of them are really good.<br>  <br>  keep it up! :)|`|SxUKHL6gaa	you have really amazing pictures!! i love the cool angles. <br>  but if you're going to show your pictures as a collection, they will make more sense if you have a common theme, not that all the pictures are of the same thing make them have a common theme.. that makes them boring... but you need lots of pictures that all have to do with love or school or an issue you feel strongly about, because those pictures are of kind of random things. <br>  <br>  again, if you made a collection of pictures with a common theme your pictures would be even better!|`|xQ934l0Taa	The keyboard was pretty artistic. I think it would have looked better if it was on more of an angle. The portrait has some harsh lighting, but that's usually expected with a point & shoot camera. The faucet colors seem off. Again these were artistic. Colors seemed too blue/green and the background was kind of distracting. Overall not bad on the photos. And by the way, I owned the G4 and loved it. The G series is a great camera. I now have a D300 SLR and will always own a quality point & shoot for when I need it. Good work & keep shooting.|`|b24a63ab0fefcb0091951039cb962b43aa	You could compare with my photos at <br>  www.flickr.com/photos/victor98_2001|`|rCZ3NIFhaa	Trust me, I know photography.<br>  You ehh.., suck..<br>  HAHAHAHA!You rock!

oweQc1OBaa	first act guitars are usually for kids, but you could use them. but i am going to warn you that first act isn't the best quality. there isn't a rule that you can't use first act guitars, so your fine. also, that is normal for people to start off. it might take a while to get used to everything. but it could be the guitar, just make sure its your size. here is an ebay guide that should help you figure out if you have the right size guitar <a href="http://reviews.ebay.com/How-to-Choose-correct-size-amp-type-of-Guitar-for-Child_W0QQugidZ10000000000907264" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.ebay.com/How-to-Choose-co...</a> good luck!
f6qmRicQaa	Dumb and blond, it sounds so cliche, but that's just what ________ is, a real life walking talking hip swaying cliche.  Some, most if your honest, would call her dumb just because she isn't the brightest crayon in the box.  Yet at her beck and call stands any guy in the school ready and willing to do her bidding.  You need to know, go to her, cause she is in the know.  Is she smart, no way, but street smarts count for a lot in life, and _______ has street smarts in spades.<br>  <br>  <br>  Like the other answerer said you have to paint a picture with words, but you can't use to many of them or it ends up jumbled and confused.  You want to give the reader just enough to get the picture, because we can let our imagination do the rest.  Don't get me wrong, you can go wrong when you don't put enough in, then the reader will be left feeling that they have no grasp on the character.  The wonderful thing is, we (the readers) all know or have known a person just like the character you described.|`|AUD1wZ5Kaa	I'd say...<br>  <br>  ------------<br>  <br>  _____ (<--- insert name) is a dumb blonde who gets guys to do her homework for her because she's incredibly stupid at school. But, she has street smarts because she knows who's who, what's hot, and what's not. <br>  <br>  ------------<br>  <br>  Then, if you want, you could put somewhere in the paragraph that's she's slick, clever, cunning. Somewhere near the part where she's street smart to emphasize it more and add more details.<br>  <br>  ~Don't forget to indent~ ;)|`|WTXvmcxcaa	Um..... that is an interesting question. How about, "She didn't really know much when it came to _______. The only thing she had the smarts to do was _____." <br>  <br>  I don't know. That is a hard thing to do. Why is she so dumb?|`|J8jJeypDaa	i can say it in a phrase not paragraph ................<br>  <br>  academically poor but street smart blonde|`|wKSvnna2aa	Read books and you'll learn how to write better.

If you just put the words together and they have no reference to anything in the book, then it's silly.

0AUPrCMZaa	i don't know if they "design" opera for kids....<br>  <br>  but.  carmen is a great opera<br>  <br>  and the aria habanera is just awesome.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a7yb3dWhJs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a7yb3dWh...</a>|`|55RiXgXwaa	It seems that if you daughter already know that she likes opera and wants to sing opera then she must have had some exposure to it.  So maybe she has some opinions of her own as to which opera she would like to see.  If your concern is that the opera she chooses might not be suitable for a minor, don't take her to see Salome because the current trend is for the soprano to finish the dance of the seven veils completely nude.  But most operas handle intimate scenes quite delicately.  Even Salome was probably not intended to be so explicit by the composer (Richard Strauss).  Most operas do have love scenes, but like I said they will usually be handled delicately.<br>  <br>  By the same token, there's no way to predict what some hair-brained, I-Wanna-be-a-director idiot is likely to come up with.|`|cyt7oh97aa	Hey, while I was looking for operas to take your daughter to I discovered a kids opera camp in the chicago area!  I think it would be perfect for your daughter!  If you are no where near Chicago I'm sure that there must be something like that closer to you if you look!<br>  I couldn't find any specific operas for you guys but I would call your nearest opera house or theatre and see what they would recommend, they would definitely know more than we do.|`|wND7qPTWaa	Phantom of the Opera|`|3j7WE8jGaa	I suppose I am only now beginning to become enthusiastic about most opera....and I am more than 20 years older than your daughter. I would say, however, that my parents took me to see productions of the Gilbert & Sullivan operettas once a year in my childhood....and I have enjoyed them for as long as I can remember....certainly from well before the age of 9. I suppose this was the closest I came to exposure to opera at an early age....and it was not until a little later that I began to enjoy some of Mozart's operas. I suppose I still have not really got into many of the "heavier" longer operas by the composers of the Romantic period....although I am beginning to like them now.
AA11898755	medium is not FOR opacity. It is by definition a vehicle by which fluidity is increased, opacity is decreased and transparency  and translucency, highly useful and desirable qualities in realism, are increased. To increase opacity use direct paint, mix white or umbers to increase the opacity of thinned colors (this, however makes colors chalky and dull) or paint with only a small amount of solvent to increase liquidity. <br>  My recipe is similar, but a 3,2,1 recipe using refined linseed since I find stand oil tends to yellow and is too syrupy for my effects.<br>  3 parts Eng turp<br>  2 parts linseed oil<br>  1 part damar varnish<br>  (the varnish is necessary to increase and balance the elasticity and flexibility of the paint film)<br>  <br>  (Turpenoid is not recommended for medium as its interaction with the varnish and linseed oil is unstable compared to English turpentine.)|`|OU7RfpJJaa	ok my favorite recipe for the perfect oil painting medium is........<br>  <br>  5 parts english distilled turpentine<br>  1 part stand oil<br>  1 part damar varnish<br>   <br>  you only need a few drops per pile of paint that you mix.  if you add too much you will thin the paint to much, which is bad unless you want it that thin. This medium has a nice sheen without being tooo glossy, dries fairly quickly and really holds paint to the surface so that if your painting gets bumped during transport, you wont scrape off the picture so easily.<br>  I would just get a little squeeze bottle that you can close and mark it off in 7 equal sections with numbers and fill up the first 2 sections with the damar varnish and stand oil then fill up the rest with the english distilled turpentine, that way you always have it ready to go when you need it. Dont use turpenoid as a medium, its great for cleaning brushes, but its crap as a medium. The kind of turpentine is important, make sure it is specifically english distilled. It comes in a little glass bottle and it is a little expensive, but well worth it.

AA11442722	You are talking about alternate tunings rather than detuning. Your guitar remains in tune, your just using something other than the standard 440. <br>  <br>  One of the first and most common is tune your E string down to D. With that to play a 5th on the top two strings you just barre the top two strings. Very commonly used in Rock and Metal. <br>  <br>  Another common Metal tuning is to drop the whole guitar a full step. Steps are a full incriment, so for example from E to D is a full step. G to A is a full step.  So you'd tune E down to D, A down G ect. <br>  <br>  Some groups will actually tune down to C but that leaves the strings so rubbery and requires modifications to the guitar to actually play in that tuning. <br>  <br>  Other alternate tunings would be something like the D tuning where you tune your strings D A D G B D  <br>  <br>  With a tuning like that your using quite a few drone strings typically. It dramatically changes your scales and chords when you use an alt tuning like that. <br>  <br>  Usually what I do to go to a drop tuning is I'll get it close by ear. For example if I'm just dropping my E string I'll fret the D note on the A string and just loosen the E string until the two ring. Then I'll fine tune with a tuner.  You can do this with pretty much any alt tuning.|`|OJ1G7RW9aa	Que?

8kDAgDAzaa	It wasn't a big deal for me.  My mom was a single parent and we moved around so much, I could never get settled with a solid base of friends.  I attended three different schools in the second grade alone.  By the time high school rolled around, I was pretty much a recluse.  I was happy when graduation finally came and went.  <br>  <br>  I was so tired of the whole school scene with cliques and peer pressures so I decided to go into the Air Force instead of into college.  I figured it was a quicker way to get out of the house and "grow up."  Independence was the goal.  Earn a paycheck and buy a car.<br>  <br>  Twenty years later, I'm retired from the Air Force and have a 16 year old in his Junior year of high school.  I homesteaded as much as possible while in the military to give my son the solid base of friends that I never had.  I've sacrificed a lot for him.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your future.  High school is just one chapter of your life.  The future is an adventure.

MllOMmnUaa	The confrontation had been a slaughter on both sides. Corpses littered areas of the battlefield to the extent that, as General Grant described, "it would have been possible to walk across the clearing in any direction stepping on dead bodies without a foot touching the ground." Nearly 100,000 troops had faced each other and almost 24,000 ended as casualties. This horrendous outcome was a wake-up call to the nation announcing that the continuing war would be costly for both sides. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/shiloh.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/shilo...</a><br>  <br>  In the immediate aftermath of the battle, Northern newspapers vilified Grant for his performance during the battle on April 6. Reporters, many far from the battle, spread the story that Grant had been drunk, falsely alleging that this had resulted in many of his men being bayoneted in their tents because of a lack of defensive preparedness. Despite the Union victory, Grant's reputation suffered in Northern public opinion. Many credited Buell with taking control of the broken Union forces and leading them to victory on April 7. Calls for Grant's removal overwhelmed the White House. President Abraham Lincoln replied with one of his most famous quotations about Grant: "I can't spare this man; he fights." Sherman emerged as an immediate hero, his steadfastness under fire and chaos atoning for his previous melancholy and his defensive lapses preceding the battle. Today, however, Grant is recognized positively for the clear judgment he was able to retain under the strenuous circumstances, and his ability to perceive the larger tactical picture that ultimately resulted in victory on the second day.<br>  Nevertheless, Grant's career suffered temporarily in the aftermath of Shiloh. Henry W. Halleck combined and reorganized his armies, relegating Grant to the powerless position of second-in-command. In late April and May the Union armies, under Halleck's personal command, advanced slowly toward Corinth and captured it, while an amphibious force on the Mississippi River destroyed the Confederate River Defense Fleet and captured Memphis. Halleck was promoted to be general in chief of all the Union armies, and with his departure for the East, Grant was restored to command. Grant pushed on down the Mississippi to besiege Vicksburg. After the surrender of Vicksburg and the fall of Port Hudson in the summer of 1863, the Mississippi River was under Union control and the Confederacy was cut in half. Command of the Army of Mississippi fell to Braxton Bragg, who was promoted to full general on April 6. In the fall of 1862, he led it on an unsuccessful invasion of Kentucky, culminating in his retreat from the Battle of Perryville.[<br>  Both sides were shocked at the carnage. None suspected that three more years of such bloodshed remained in the war and that eight larger and bloodier battles were yet to come. Grant came to realize that his prediction of one great battle bringing the war to a close was probably not destined to happen. The war would continue, at great cost in casualties and resources, until the Confederacy succumbed or the Union was divided. Grant also learned a valuable personal lesson on preparedness that (mostly) served him well for the rest of the war.<br>  <br>  Wikipedia: Battle of Shiloh|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Combined with the 10,000 casualties on the Confederate side, more men were lost at Shiloh than in all previous American wars combined. Grant retreated up the Tennessee River, and Lincoln was pressured to fire him. But Grant had showed a trait hard to find in the northern armies: he was a fighting soldier.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Battle of Shiloh

16nAXOg8aa	I do not agree with the saying,  but I understand why it came up.  This is known as a rule of thumb,  something generally ,  but not always,  true.<br>  <br>  In general,  for things valuable to learn,  some things are easy to teach,  to learn.  This is where academics do well.  Then,  there are things that are leaned only with practice,  long and tedious,  things difficult to explain to rookies,  to justify to others.  Most knowledge exist between those two extremes.<br>  <br>  For most trades,  you learn in an academic environment,  or in the field.  In reality,  no vocation can be learned in only one environment,  you need a proper mix of the two.  In practice,  the usual course of action is to choose one extremes as the only setting,  as it makes other things easier. Of course,  there are significant exceptions to this rule.<br>  <br>  In getting teachers for professions,  institutions require candidates that go to school and study further,  as opposed to merely professionals in the field.  Some people go into teaching because they discovered they did not like the specialization,  and the easiest course of action is to become teachers.  To those people,  the saying may apply.  Others become so loaded with theorical knowledge they may not do well in practice.  The saying may apply to this group as well,  to a lesser degree than the first.  Finally,  there are those who like the field,  can do well in the real world,  but prefer teaching.  To those,  the saying does not apply at all.|`|XfSJZCEyaa	To an extent this statement can be true.<br>  <br>  Imagine a dancer who is over her prime. She can no longer dance because of her age and health, but she teaches. Whereas her student, is young and capable, and therefore is a professional dancer.<br>  <br>  But on the other hand, we have people like Warren Buffet who teach others how to make money. Certainly, he 'can' make money since he is currently the richest man in the world. Now, the statement doesn't hold up anymore, since in this case, someone who could, chooses to teach. <br>  <br>  This is a proverb not thought out too well, i guess.|`|5YdJwZTDaa	This statement has always bugged me!!! As far as I'm concerned 'He who teaches also does'.  My greatest professors and colleagues have been those who have taught, and practiced what they teach in the real world.

That could help them maintain optimism and be realistic in the same time.<br>  Yet schools administrations demand so much from a teacher that they look like they cannot do anything but teach the little they have learned.  Which is not true.  They can be doers.  They can do what they teach, and more.  They need more opportunity and more time.<br>  No offense to any teacher: I was one, and considered like not being able to do anything else than teaching my Latin, my French.  Now I write articles and I do other things totally different.  I could still teach!<br>  So all in all I disagree with a statement that is so drastically in the opposites.|`|MGEYaehVaa	No.  This statement is definitely misleading.

I plan to be a music teacher.  I can "do", I just choose to teach.<br>  <br>  However, I've had many teachers who couldn't do anything (For an example, go on face book and search "Joseph Monahan".

HkXYGAOdaa	Your poem is very expressive.  <br>  <br>  If I may, I made some revisions, line breaks makes 9 triplets of eight syllables per line, with an ending couplet, and punctuation makes your poem even more well defined as it flows better and holds your readers' attention and focus.:<br>  <br>  <br>  There’s this girl that I really like,<br>  But even when I try to get<br>  at her, I end up getting spiked.<br>  <br>  The more I try the more I lose.<br>  The more I fight, the more i'm bruised.<br>  But I know this is how life goes.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, I just feel like I want<br>  to be spirit free, shine and glow<br>  to be worthy of her warm soul.<br>  <br>  If she indeed is the one for me, <br>  then it will so be meant to be.<br>  You know i'd do anything!<br>  <br>  But then I have horrid nightmares <br>  about you and me; I just can’t <br>  seem to flee the dreary dreams.<br>  <br>  Can’t seem until you be ma boo.<br>  I know when they say life goes on.<br>  But I will stay with you till dawn.<br>  <br>  When you ignore me, it hurts you; <br>  I know you want to solve our issues.<br>  Give me chances; I will succeed<br>  <br>  But please forgive me because<br>  you are all to me, what I need.<br>  And I don't think it's over yet.<br>  <br>  But I know you think it’s over.<br>  Not yet; it hasn’t passed the border. <br>  I know someday you will be mine.<br>  <br>  We’ll be together, <br>  until the sunshine.|`|IhF2zT5maa	I like it.

I can't suggest them, you have to feel your way through to them.<br>  <br>  All in all, a very sweet poem.  Nothing new in it, but nothing new in love after only 20 million years anyway.  it's honest, bravely honest.  It's a good poem and full of heart.

The only one I know of the ones you listed was the Everlast song. Songs with a social concious are plentiful in Rock. Golden Country by REO is akin to the Everlast song but angrier. Aqualung by Jethro Tull and Behind Blue eyes by the Who  take on the viewpoints of a villian at points.   <br>  <br>  For me it's more exotic things that tend to move me usually, that or meloncholy stuff.  I find sadness in Astronomy (BOC then the Metalica cover of it) the lyrics to that song can take you places the author likely never considered. <br>  <br>  Sober by Tool brings up the fairness of the concept of heaven and hell. <br>  <br>  Pink Floyd deals heavily with alienation and sanity. Aging as well. You hear the first hints of it in Time but with High hopes it really takes the whole issue of faded dreams, aging and the disapointment of life by the horns. <br>  <br>  Some songs have special meaning to me. Veteren of the psychic wars by BOC. everybody who listens to it hears something different from the lyrics. <br>  <br>  Dust in the wind by Kansas is another good philisophical tune.<br>  <br>  In terms of sadness Beyond the realms of Death by Judas Priest, Fade to Black Metalica,  <br>  <br>  Drive by REM, is a song that invokes great meloncholy in me, though not sure others feel that way.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Okay, you have to go back in time, and get some of the greats.<br>  <br>  The wall: pink floyd - in fact, Animals is as powerful and stunning in its sophisticated understanding of human nature, if alittle cynical.<br>  <br>  Jethro Tull:  probably Thick as a Brick first off, it's an acquired taste, and if you listen to Aqualung you may need your mouth washed out so just stick with thick as a brick.<br>  <br>  Hmm  Tom Petty's "Free Falling" saved me from an abusive relationship back in the dark ages....<br>  <br>  sigh.

WZNaNvplaa	On the good side. He was the longest reigning king in history. Under his rule France became the premiere power in Europe. He absolutely subdued the nobility, turning them from a group who counterbalanced his own power, into a group of sycophants. This helped avoid civil wars by those who might otherwise believed they had a better claim to the throne.<br>     On the bad. There was never a war Louis didn't like. His aggression and ambition resulted in France being at war with one or more of her neighbors through most of his reign. To pay for those wars, as well as things like Versailles, he laid a crushing tax burden on his citizens. He had a vain streak and was capable of vindictiveness towards those who got on his wrong side.<br>     So, take your pick on what you consider more important. The beauty of Versailles and the strength of his armies, or the cost of Versailles and the death toll of his constant wars.|`|AA11131428	Very effective leader, not a particularly moral person.
QAvuORejaa	My favourite colour is purple. It reminds me of all the peaceful dreams I have. I'm a person who get's stressed easily and the colour just calms me down allot. Also, you don't really see much purple in nature.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, I hate the colour green. It reminds me of the kids who bullied my allot, and bright green reminds me of poison. In cartoons and such, not real life poisons|`|bzyg6i3caa	My favourite colour is green and I love it because its so natural, comforting and relaxing, and I love all the different shades of it.  I guess it symbolises the outdoors so is very lush and vibrant.  I also think it represents good health and energy.<br>  <br>  I just love anything green!! :D|`|oHO0XOQVaa	I like shiny/metallic gold.

hiuMrxGkaa	I've been drawing portraits since I was 11.<br>  I've gotten fairly good at it =p<br>  <br>  So.. To draw hair you need  ALOT of shading and depth.<br>  <br>  If you want curly hair: You have to look at the lighting and what angle it's coming from. Each individual curl needs attention. You want to lighten, or erase pencil from to round part of the curl. And darken it where the curl goes in. A good book to buy for hair is called Making Realistic Portraits from  A Photograph. <br>  <br>  If you want straight hair: It's a little easier but still takes alot of care to do it right.. Decide where the light will be shining and obviously that will be the lightest part. make sure you have a fair amount of hair and keep adding. draw each individual strand of hair.. The effort will show. And DARKEN DARKEN DARKEN!! Always darken it more then you have to.. It provides a more professional looking piece. :)<br>  <br>  Hope I helped. :)|`|srLW1htsaa	go to google on search and type "hair tutorial", they'll have many tutorials to draw hairs|`|C8LZp5ZUaa	A great web site is ,   idrawandpaint.com    you will find all you need to know there ,,i did and  it is  worth trying ,,,,good luck in your art,,,,|`|bU6jX38Vaa	if you want to know on how to draw hair you can check videos on www.youtube.com or in www.yahoo.com and search how to draw hair

gyTcpbpiaa	I think it is very descriptive.  It sounds like it would be a Fantasy Novel. It really kept my interest.  I want to read on.  Sounds like you really have potential with the story.  Good luck!  Keep putting paragraphs on questions. You have my interest, now don't keep me in the dark too long, Smiles!|`|BtKJQHQMaa	it is great, as a reader i'd recommend:<br>  <br>  tell how the character is feeling at least once (like butterflies in stomach or something)<br>  <br>  and just be a little more descriptive of the setting. <br>  <br>  it sounds awesome, i'd love to read what follows when you publish it!|`|fo5AsHYZaa	ehh|`|j9tvu3rFaa	There's a couple spelling and punctuation errors (example: "leader ship" leadership) but it sounds really good. I would make it a little longer to show more about the person whos perspective it's from. Ariana. Like describe the setting and maybe the season. Have her thinking how, like, if itsfall, it's her favorite season because its so beautiful, yada, yada, yada,....lol. And use similes and metaphors too. They make all writing sound better.<br>  You don't reallyneed to change anythink though. It sounds good. I would read it.<br>  I'll edit the mistakes with grammar, spelling, etc..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I feel the crunch of leaves as my feet hit the ground above them. I quickly glance behind me. I can feel the presence of unknown strangers. I glance up to find someone sitting on a dark tree   (How do you sit on a dark tree? And someone sitting among other someones, or a tree among other trees?)   among others, all who stare down at me with warming faces, like they knew I was coming. As if they were waiting just for me and knew that i would accidentally travel off the trail in the woods. One stands out among the rest. He has on a dark coat with an unfamiliar crest sewn into it. He is different then the others, showing confidence and leadership in his posture and facial expressions. The man in the dark coat leaps down from the highest branch of a tall tree. My heart skips a beat. He is so graceful and beautiful all at once, and has the most glimmering    ("most glimmering" doesn't really make sense)    brown eyes I have ever seen. I stare at him, studying the planes of his face. He shows concern in his eyes as well as curiosity. Finally he speaks," Hello Ariana, I am Zachara leader of the Embelem. We have been waiting."<br>  <br>  In the middle, you change from present to past tense, so I made it all present. You used the word "others" three times, now only two. You used "unknown" twice, now only once. There were,like, five spelling errors. Describing the tree he jumps down from you say "Th highest branch of the tallest tree" I ust said a tall tree because that sounds like a little much. And there were a couple other things I changed.<br>  <br>  I wouls make it something more like this:<br>  <br>  I hear the crunch of browning leaves underneath my new Puma tennis shoes as I stumble through the forest. I'm anxious to be in my warm, safe little home. Suddenly, I feel a strange sensation of eyes on my back, like an unknown presence, watching me. Turning, I glance up to see several men sitting high in the foliage, staring at me with warm expressions. It’s like they were expecting me. As if they had known I would get lost in the woods and end up at this location. But for some reason, I can’t bring myself to be panicked, although they’re strangers. One stands out among the rest. He has on a midnight sky-colored trench coat that ends right above his knees. There’s an unfamiliar crest sewn into the right breast pocket of the coat. The man shows confidence and leadership unlike the others. He leaps off of the a high branch of an old oak tree, landing on his feet with a very soft thud, and takes two slow steps in my direction. My heart skips a beat at the beauty and grace of these simple steps. I look into his shimmering russet eyes. They show concern as well as curiosity. A moment of silence passes, and then he speaks. “Hello, Ariana. I am Zachara, leader of the Embelem. We have been waiting.”<br>  <br>  That shows a bit more personality, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Either way, it sounds like a very promising story. Hopefully one day it'll be published and I can read it. =)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fkTb2TiYaa	very good! if i read that i would defiantly want to read the rest of the book. i would proof read though, you're missing lots of coma's|`|ybSs3BiKaa	I like it i would definately keep reading after this..|`|xI8gcYdsaa	it's okay, proofread though.|`|T1flY77Vaa	Proofread it... your tense changes between present and past.  Either have it read like "I feel the crunch... As if they are waiting... One stands out..." or like "I felt the crunch... As if they were waiting... One stood out."  Your first few sentences can probably be combined into one or something.<br>  <br>  Also, while not a rule, descriptive paragraphs read much better when you don't start two sentences in a row with the same letter, let alone word.<br>  <br>  Beyond that... this sort of reads like the excerpts from later in the story that authors occasionally put in before the beginning of the book, which it would work as.  It's uncomfortable for the reader to be dropped in during the action, so if this is the actual first paragraph of the first chapter... I'd at least lengthen it a bit so we get an idea as to why the MC is out there and what exactly is going on.|`|zCHnMeXbaa	I feel the dry, dead leaves crunching as I tread warily through the murky woods.  I nervously glance all around; I can feel the presence of unknown strangers watching my every step.  Glancing up, I see someone, something barely hidden in a old, gnarled tree.  As I edge closer I see that there are many someones amongst the branches. They silently stare at me with knowing expression on their faces.  I know that they have been waiting for me.  How did they know I would drift off the faint trail and come this way?  <br>  One,on the highest branch, stood out among the others.  I could see that he wore a dark coat with an unknown crest barely visible on one side.  He stared at me in an knowing, confident manner that quickly made me realize he was the leader.  Gracefully,like a falling leaf, he dropped to the ground.  My heart skipped a beat.  He was so graceful, so beautiful.  He had the most beautiful, glimmering brown eyes I had ever seen.  I could not but help to stare back into those captivating eyes. I slowly realized those beautiful eyes were filled with concern and curiosity about me.  Finally, he spoke, "Hello, Ariana.  I am Zachara, lead of the Embelem; we have been waiting."|`|RZQHB0g8aa	I liked it. I would definitely read on after that because you get very curious who these Embelem people are and why they knew Ariana was coming and so on. And I also liked your descriptions. I would write the whole thing in the past tense, though. It feels kind of weird in the present. And you switched into the past, too after the first few sentences. It's just more natural (in my opinion). And the first three sentences start with I. I'd try to change the words around a bit to avoid that. Hope this helps and keep going!

hJP9y6kjaa	So are you wanting to use the Digitech for recording vocals? I'm confused....<br>  <br>  To use a condenser microphone, you need something that supplies phantom power. The Digitech does *not* supply phantom power, so if you're using some other device to go into the computer, then you need to check the documentation to see if it supports phantom power or not.<br>  <br>  If not, then you are limited to dynamic mics.<br>  <br>  Behringer makes some inexpensive mixers which provide phantom power. I've actually used them a lot - the key with them is that as long as you don't boost or cut too much with the EQ or boost too much with any of the level controls you'll get a good sound with no noise. As soon as you start cutting/boosting EQ, jacking up levels, that kind of thing, they tend to add noise pretty quickly.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|AA11442722	Technically you can use the input jack, just get a balenced to 1/4 inch chord. Don't use an adaptor as it'll introduce noise. You should get enough pre-amp to actually record. Far from ideal however.  I'd have to dig up the manual for that particlar model but on most multi-effects boxes designed for guitar the TRS jacks are not pre-amped. They are for running effects loops and daisy chaining effects. Typically you'll use one as an out and one will be for in.  <br>  <br>  Behringer makes a pretty solid mixer that you can use for recording vocals. If your going directly from effects to a sound card your not getting a good signal. You want a break out box, whether fire wire, PCI or USB. You'll hear a major difference in the sound. You can get a 2 channel for under $150. Most of those will have pre-amps so you can go strait to the break out box from the mic and or use your RP for effects.

Kr2TIUsAaa	I have read the whole trilogy and they were good pieces of literature. <br>  <br>  As purgatory, it is a mountain structure with three main categories. <br>  <br>  But since you are suppose to create something original, my advise is to keep it inlign with the concept that purgatory is the way to heaven of those who repented. So that means the structure needs to rise as the sins are cleansed - during Dante's time, everyone believed that Heaven, Hell and Purgatory were real places of existence here on earth.|`|Aa9udlYvaa	Most of the character's in The Inferno were real historical characters that Dante didn't like.

KHSOVxViaa	The evidence is pretty overwhelming; I'm convinced.<br>  <br>  The problem today is the latent nationalism that still exists in the region.  The tensions that resulted in the genocide are still partly there, between the Armenian people and their Turkic neighbours.<br>  <br>  The origins of this go a long way back, when the Armenian people lived in a large swathe of an area in southern and eastern Anatolia (Asia Minor) while the Turkic people were still far away in central Asia.  Over time, Turkic tribes migrated westwards, often conquering the local people as they went.<br>  <br>  The now Christian Armenians were subject to this, and lost much of their territory to these invaders.  At the time of the Byzantine Empire, both Armenian and Greek areas were invaded and Turkified, reducing ethnic Armenia to a smaller area, and Greek Constantinople was finally captured by the Ottoman Turks.<br>  <br>  The Armenians became a subject people in an Islamic Turkic sea, often suffering what we would now call ethnic cleansing. Persia was also a player in this area; at one point, they captured much of Armenia from the Ottomans, and uprooted whole towns which could not be defended.  While the Persians were less oppressive than Ottomans, the Armenians still suffered as a subject people.<br>  <br>  These tensions continued, and eventually Imperial Russia and later the USSR became a player.  During WW I, many Turks regarded the Armenians as a threat, as they tended to favour their enemies.  The Armenians did indeed favour them, as they had been suffering for a long time under Ottoman rule.<br>  <br>  Turkey decided to implement a 'final solution'.  The Armenians were uprooted from their towns and forced to march long distances through the desert to present-day Syria and Lebanon.  Officially this was to move them to where they were not a 'threat', but in practice there were countless massacres, many highly organised, and others more spontaneous by mobs. There was a huge death rate on the forced marches themselves, as sufficient water and food were not provided.  Women were raped and sometimes forced to convert and marry Muslims, children were sometimes placed into Turkish families. There were more than a few examples of ordinary Turkish people helping to save some Armenians in acts of great bravery and compassion.  There is extensive photographic evidence and testimony by witnesses and survivors about the massacres and denial of sustenance.<br>  <br>  This tension did not go away, and in the latter days of the USSR, the Soviet Republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan went to war over the territory of Ngorno Karabakh.  This territory, an ancient Armenian area, was part of Azerbaijan since Stalin redrew the boundaries.  It had a sizeable minority of Azeris, and the conflict was bitter.  The Armenians gained the upper hand, and took most of the territory, though the Azeris also took some ethnic Armenian villages.  Ethnic cleansing happened on both sides, and mosques and churches were destroyed.<br>  <br>  Over the last century, many remnants of Armenian culture have been damaged or destroyed.  Churches have been demolished, graveyards bulldozed throughout historic Armenia.  As recently as 2005 the ancient and extensive Armenian cathedral and graveyard complex at Djulfa in Azerbaijan was completely flattened, all traces removed, buried or destroyed.  International investigators were denied access, but satellite images and views from nearby Iran show the result.  This was a major archaeological and cultural site, and the event displays the problems that continue.<br>  <br>  In present day Turkey, it is virtually a crime to say that the Genocide happened; those who do so are often prosecuted for 'insulting the state'.   However, increasing numbers of prominent academics and writers are daring to speak out.  Turkey's best-selling international novelist, Orhan Pamuk, had the charges against him dropped, largely because of the international outcry.<br>  <br>  Many ethnic Armenians in Turkey have been cooperating with prominent Turkish figures to try to move towards greater reconciliation, though there have been setbacks such as the assassination of the journalist Hrant Dink.  Recently, the Turkish AK government have been engaged in 'quiet' talks with the government of Armenia to improve relations.<br>  <br>  Times have been very bad between these two peoples, but there are definite signs of improvement.  Official Turkish recognition of the Genocide will be the big breakthrough, but that is likely some way away and will not happen overnight.<br>  <br>  However, to deny it is just nonsense.|`|9233401496ab10d52d1644174696a803aa	It happened. To deny it the same as denying the Holocaust in WW II. <br>  The book by a Turk, Taner Akcam,  "A Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility" is an excellent book. He now lives in Minnesota. He used Turkish archives. All the research was done in Turkey except for interviews of survivors or relatives of survivors. Another book that was pretty good is <br>  "Survivors: An Oral History Of The Armenian Genocide" by Donald E. Miller and Lorna Touryan Miller.<br>  <br>  It is true Turkey will not admit it ever happened and it could land a Turk citizen in jail for sometime. A non-Turk becomes a persona non grata. No books or reading materials are allowed that refer to it. An American diplomat referred to it is a speech and he was immediately recalled. The Turks simply cannot own up to the guilt like the Japanese with the Rape of Nanking. It does seem a bit silly to me but some countries will not allow such horrendous deeds to mar their people and its history. There is also the question of economic compensation to consider.|`|UEKq9sxWaa	No, I do not.<br>  <br>  But i believe in the armenians are liar and murderer.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khojaly_Massacre" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khojaly_Mas...</a><br>  <br>  Fresh evidence emerged today of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.<br>  <br>  The Azerbaijani press agency Azerinform reported renewed Armenian missile fire on the Azerbaijani-populated town of Shusha on Sunday night. It said several people had been wounded in another attack, on the settlement of Venjali, early today.<br>  <br>  The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed 1,000 people in the Azerbaijani-populated town of Khojaly last week and had massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered mountain passes.<br>  <br>  But dozens of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani reports of a massacre. Scalping Reported<br>  <br>  Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region by helicopter brought back three dead children with the backs of their heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians had prevented them from retrieving more bodies.<br>  <br>  "Women and children had been scalped," said Assad Faradzhev, an aide to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. "When we began to pick up bodies, they began firing at us."<br>  <br>  The Azerbaijani militia chief in Agdam, Rashid Mamedov, said: "The bodies are lying there like flocks of sheep. Even the fascists did nothing like this."<br>  <br>  Near Agdam on the outskirts of Nagorno-Karabakh, a Reuters photographer, Frederique Lengaigne, said she had seen two trucks filled with Azerbaijani bodies.<br>  <br>  "In the first one I counted 35, and it looked as though there were almost as many in the second," she said. "Some had their heads cut off, and many had been burned. They were all men, and a few had been wearing khaki uniforms."<br>  <br>  Ethnic violence and economic crisis threaten to tear apart the Commonwealth of Independent States, created by 11 former Soviet republics in December.

It was characterised by the use of massacres, and the use of deportations involving forced marches under conditions designed to lead to the death of the deportees, with the total number of Armenian deaths generally held to have been between one and one-and-a-half million.[2] Other ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the Empire during this period, including Assyrians and Greeks, and some scholars consider the events to be part of the same policy of extermination.[3]<br>  <br>  It is widely acknowledged to have been one of the first modern, systematic genocides,[4][5][6] as many Western sources point to the sheer scale of the death toll as evidence for a systematic, organized plan to eliminate the Armenians.[7]<br>  <br>  The date of the onset of the genocide is conventionally held to be April 24, 1915, the day that Ottoman authorities arrested some 250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders in Constantinople. Thereafter, the Ottoman military uprooted Armenians from their homes and forced them to march for hundreds of miles, depriving them of food and water, to the desert of what is now Syria. Massacres were indiscriminate of age or gender, with rape and other sexual abuse commonplace. The Armenian Genocide is the second most-studied case of genocide.[8]<br>  <br>  The Republic of Turkey, the successor state of the Ottoman Empire, does not accept the word genocide as an accurate description of the events.[9] In recent years, it has faced repeated calls to accept the events as genocide. To date, twenty-one countries have officially recognized the events of the period as genocide, and most genocide scholars[10] and historians[11] accept this view. The majority of Armenian diaspora communities were founded as a result of the Armenian genocide.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Ge...</a> ------------------------------ The Republic of Turkey and the Armenian Genocide<br>  Main article: Denial of the Armenian Genocide<br>  The Republic of Turkey's formal stance is that the deaths of Armenians during the "relocation" or "deportation" cannot aptly be deemed "genocide," a position that has been supported with a plethora of diverging justifications: that the killings were not deliberate or were not governmentally orchestrated, that the killings were justified because Armenians posed a Russian-sympathizing threat as a cultural group, that Armenians merely starved, or any of various characterizations recalling marauding "Armenian gangs."[141][142][143] Some suggestions seek to invalidate the genocide on semantic or anachronistic grounds (the word "genocide" was not coined until 1943).<br>  <br>  Turkish World War I casualty figures are often cited to mitigate the effect of the number of Armenian dead.[144] The website of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey currently features a section entitled Archive Documents about the Atrocities and Genocide Inflicted upon Turks by Armenians,[145] suggesting that the Turks of Anatolia experienced a genocide at the hands of the Armenians. This report notes that there were many Russian Armenians serving in the Russian Army against the Ottoman Army, suggesting that "Armenian soldiers in the Ottoman army deserted with their arms and having joined the Russian forces they formed voluntary units or armed bands."[146] It further suggests that the Russian Empire intended "to annex Anatolia by using Armenians",[147] and characterizes several infamous massacres of Armenians in the pre-World War I era as "uprisings", "rebellions" or "incidents".[148] The text suggests that accounts of the Armenian Genocide are anti-Turkish, and argues that the Turkish and Ottoman Archives are of overriding importance and the only source of "true historical information".[149]<br>  <br>  Turkish governmental sources have asserted that the historically-demonstrated "tolerance of Turkish people"[150] itself renders the Armenian Genocide an impossibility. One military document leverages 11th century history to disprove the Armenian Genocide: "It was the Seljuk Turks who saved the Armenians that came under the Turkish domination in 1071 from the Byzantine persecution and granted them the right to live as a man should."http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm...

shVgCizBaa	Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (IPA: [xo?li?a?a man?de?la]; born 18 July 1918) was the first President of South Africa to be elected in a fully representative democratic election, serving in the office from 1994–99. Before his presidency, Mandela was an anti-apartheid activist, and the leader of the African National Congress's armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe. The South African courts convicted him on charges of sabotage, as well as other crimes committed while he led the movement against apartheid. In accordance with his conviction, Mandela served 27 years in prison, spending many of these years on Robben Island.<br>  <br>  Following his release from prison on 11 February 1990, Mandela has supported reconciliation and negotiation, and has helped lead the transition towards multi-racial democracy in South Africa. Since the end of apartheid, many have frequently praised Mandela, including former opponents. Mandela has received more than one hundred awards over four decades, most notably the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. He is currently a celebrated elder statesman who continues to voice his opinion on topical issues. In South Africa he is often known as Madiba, an honorary title adopted by elders of Mandela's clan. The title has come to be synonymous with Nelson Mandela.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mand...</a>     ------------------------------------Biog... Nelson Mandela, Political Leader    Nelson Mandela spent 27 years as a political prisoner in South Africa before becoming the country's first black president. Mandela was a leading member of the African National Congress (ANC), which opposed South Africa's white minority government and its policy of racial separation, known as apartheid. The government outlawed the ANC in 1960. Mandela was captured and jailed in 1962, and in 1964 he was convicted of treason and sentenced to life in prison. Instead of disappearing from view, Mandela became a prison-bound martyr and worldwide symbol of resistance to racism. South African President F.W. de Klerk finally lifted the ban on the ANC and released Mandela in 1990. Mandela used his stature to help dismantle apartheid and form a new multi-racial democracy, and he and de Klerk shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. Mandela was elected the country's president in 1994. He served until 1999, when he was succeeded by his deputy Thabo Mbeki. Mandela's autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom, was published in 1994.<br>  <br>  <br>  He is also called 'Madiba,' a nickname taken from his clan... Mandela says in Long Walk to Freedom that he was given the English name "Nelson" by his teacher on his first day at school... Mandela has been married three times: to the former Evelyn Mase from 1944 to 1957, to Winnie Madikizela from 1958 to 1996, and to Graca Machel since 1998... Mandela's wife Winnie became a powerful figure in her own right while Mandela was imprisoned; however, her entanglement in a series of scandals led to the couple's estrangement in 1992, her dismissal from his cabinet in 1995, and their official divorce in 1996.<br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/nelson-mandela" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/nelson-mand...</a>|`|DSVUvfGuaa	Hello there friend .

FaX8awk1aa	for the most part historians have (and should not either) have any impact on a territory....it is there task to just report what has happened and why
zC8xLn8caa	Maybe this is circular, but why are YOU asking this question?  :-><br>  <br>  I suspect it's a little of both. We're naturally curious, and it's a protective and adaptive quality to gather as many answers, as much knowledge and as much experience as possible. Our brains work by drawing upon past experiences and knowledge to come to a conclusion.<br>  <br>  For example, if you wonder what is down that dark cave, and go explore it -- the next time you come across a dark cave, you'll have some sort of 'template' to bring to a new situation, and make a decision with. A bad experience will cause you to avoid caves (there was a bear in there), a good one will likely make you seek other caves (you found a pot of gold.)  Obviously, knowing what you're likely to find in a cave CAN help you to protect yourself in the future!<br>  <br>  (And keep in mind, it was probably the knowledgeable, experienced and/or creative people who were the leaders when we were evolving, and a natural curiosity may have helped develop those traits.)<br>  <br>  Now, using the earlier example, take 'caves', and apply it to other things....social situations (what DO women want? If I know, I can find one more easily...), and physical ones (what happens if I touch this hot stove? OW! Okay, now I know.) If you aren't curious, you're less apt to seek out new experiences and answers, and thus, are less likely to have information to apply to every new situation you find yourself in.|`|SDiYtubGaa	nobody searches for gaps in his/her knowledge. If somebody did ask questions to satisfy curiosity or to fill gaps in knowledge that he imagines, the so derived information would be eventually futile. Questions stem  from inability to solve something. All 'healthy' questions arise from subsequent reasoning to solve it.What is a tricky brain? something that could frame questions that you cannot answer? that's not possible. An answer is only as intelligible as its question. Its not possible for someone to be intellectual as to frame a question and remain dumb as to not answer it.  There is no such thing as 'tricky brain'.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	The brain is like a mouse wheel.  If you let it, it will run down and eventually rest at some point.  If you suspect your brain of being frenetic, go lie down and let it whirl away till it comes to rest: but don't believe everything it tells you while it's whizzing around!<br>  <br>  We think strategically under threat to protect ourselves and require information to think strategically in any meaningful way;<br>  <br>  We ask questions from curiosity when we are not under threat.  It takes a feeling of safety to lie back on the grass, looking at clouds, and dream 'what if' or 'how come'.  <br>  <br>  There you go, them's it.
PwfS4T74aa	Tryouts for a dance team tend to be more vigorous then tryouts for cheerleading because dance teams require precision and near-perfection with their routines in order to win competitions (one flaw in a dance can screw up the whole thing)<br>  <br>  I'm on my school's cheerleading squad, but our dance team went to Florida yesterday for Nationals<br>  <br>  The best advice I can give you is to work hard on the types of dancing you know your school's dance team does (jazz, tap, ballet, or whatever they do). Make up several routines on your own and perfect them. Incorporate different moves and elements so you'll be prepared if they ask you to preform a certain move during tryouts, and you'll already have it down.<br>  <br>  Start running/jogging a few times a week (if you don't already). This isn't to lose weight or gain muscle, but to strengthen your legs and better prepare you for the dance routines you'll have to preform (it will help you become more flexible, too)<br>  <br>  STRETCH!!! I know you mentioned this, so the best thing to do would be to buy a yoga DVD that focuses on stretching/relaxation techniques and follow along with the video to improve your  flexibility<br>  <br>  Cartwheels would be another good thing to practice. You'll more then likely won't need them for dance, but they help build balance, as well as coordination and leg strength.

It doesn't matter if the grammar is less than stellar, or the author uses to many adjectives, as long as the content is engaging. <br>    I like to be kept guessing, and I like an actual ending, not a 'make your own ending' type of thing--unless it's a series, in which case a cliff-hanger is alright =)<br>   I'm attracted to anything out of the ordinary.

enFCCMhbaa	I don't usually answer these such questions, but I actually found your excerpt and writing intriguing. I think your description is pretty good, and your grammar is pretty good, too. The only suggestion I have is that perhaps you could add a little suspense after the person has fallen down the chute. What I mean is that perhaps instead of immediately stating that it is a Minotaur, you could say something that makes the reader wonder what the character sees. For example, something such as, "When I opened my eyes, I saw something move ahead of me. It was hidden by the shadows, but I could see its monstrous shape, and I could hear it breathing. It moved forward and I gasped. It was a Minotaur." Understand that that is just an example of what I mean - all I'm getting at is that you could, if you wanted, make your readers have to wonder a little before they find out it's a Minotaur.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|BtKJQHQMaa	it is surely interesting. you need a little more description of the setting, because i got lost a little after "i stepped forward" <br>  <br>  it was very interesting to me. i'd give it 4/5|`|l9Xg8Dv4aa	i Iiked the line: "with a minotaur keeping me company"!<br>  <br>  I see a perception of both humor and sarcasm in your ability.

AA10148336	it is christian ethics.<br>  Christian ethics developed while early Christians were subjects of the Roman Empire. Christians eventually took over the Empire itself. Saint Augustine adapted Plato, and later, after the Islamic transmission of his works, Aquinas worked Aristotelian philosophy into a Christian framework.<br>  <br>  Christian ethics in general has tended to stress grace, mercy, and forgiveness; it stresses doubt in human (as opposed to divine) judgement. It also codified the Seven Deadly Sins. For more see Christian philosophy and the Seven virtues.<br>  <br>  Paul teaches (Rom., ii, 24 ff) that God has written his moral law in the hearts of all men, even of those outside the influence of Christian revelation; this law manifests itself in the conscience of every man and is the norm according to which the whole human race will be judged on the day of reckoning. In consequence of their perverse inclinations, this law had become, to a great extent, obscured and distorted among the pagans; Christian understand their mission as, to restore it to its pristine integrity. The New Testament generally says that all moral rules follow from the duty to love God with all one's self and one's neighbor as oneself. The sense that "follow" has in this claim is, however, controversial. Ecclesiastical writers, as Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Ambrose, Jerome, and Augustine of Hippo all wrote on ethics from a distinctly Christian point of view. Interestingly, they made use of philosophical and ethical principles laid down by their Greek (pagan) philosopher forbears.<br>  <br>  The Church fathers had little occasion to treat moral questions from a purely philosophical standpoint and independently of Christian Revelation; but in the explanation of Catholic doctrine their discussions naturally led to philosophical investigations.<br>  <br>  This is particularly true of Augustine, who proceeded to thoroughly develop along philosophical lines and to establish firmly most of the truths of Christian morality. The eternal law (lex aeterna), the original type and source of all temporal laws, the natural law, conscience, the ultimate end of man, the cardinal virtues, sin, marriage, etc. were treated by him in the clearest and most penetrating manner. Hardly a single portion of ethics does he present to us but is enriched with his keen philosophical commentaries. Late ecclesiastical writers followed in his footsteps.<br>  <br>  A sharper line of separation between philosophy and theology, and in particular between ethics and moral theology, is first met with in the works of the great Schoolmen of the Middle Ages, especially of Albertus Magnus (1193–1280), Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), Bonaventure(1221-1274), and Duns Scotus (1274–1308). Philosophy and, by means of it, theology reaped abundant fruit from the works of Aristotle, which had until then been a sealed treasure to Western civilization, and had first been elucidated by the detailed and profound commentaries of Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas and pressed into the service of Christian philosophy.<br>  <br>  The same is particularly true as regards ethics. Thomas, in his commentaries on the political and ethical writings of Aristotle, in his Summa contra Gentiles and his Quaestiones disputatae, treated with his wonted clearness and penetration nearly the whole range of ethics in a purely philosophical manner, so that even to the present day his words are an inexhaustible source from which ethics draws its supply. On the foundations laid by him the Catholic philosophers and theologians of succeeding ages have continued to build.<br>  <br>  In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, thanks especially to the influence of the so-called Nominalists, a period of stagnation and decline set in, but the sixteenth century is marked by a revival. Ethical questions, also, though largely treated in connection with theology, are again made the subject of careful investigation. We mention as examples the great theologians Vitoria, Dominicus Soto, L. Molina, Suarez, Lessius, and De Lugo. Among topics they discussed was the ethics of action in case of doubt, leading to the doctrine of probabilism. Since the sixteenth century special chairs of ethics (moral philosophy) have been erected in many Catholic universities. The larger, purely philosophical works on ethics, however do not appear until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, as an example of which we may instance the production of Ign. Schwarz, "Instituitiones juris universalis naturae et gentium" (1743).<br>  <br>  Far different from Catholic ethical methods were those adopted for the most part by Protestants. With the rejection of the Church's teaching authority, each individual became on principle his own supreme teacher and arbiter in matters appertaining to faith and morals. The Reformers held fast to the Bible as the infallible source of revelation, but as to what belongs or does not belong to it, whether, and how far, it is inspired, and what is its meaning — all this was left to the final decision of the individual.<br>  <br>  Philipp Melanchthon, in his "Elementa philosophiae moralis", still clung to the Aristotelean philosophy; so, too, did Hugo Grotius, in his work, "De jure belli et pacis". But Cumberland and his follower, Samuel Pufendorf, moreover, assumed, with Descartes, that the ultimate ground for every distinction between good and evil lay in the free determination of God's will, a view which renders the philosophical treatment of ethics fundamentally impossible.<br>  <br>  In the 20th century, some Christian philosophers, notably Dietrich Bonhoeffer questioned the value of ethical reasoning in moral philosophy. In this school of thought, ethics, with its focus on distinguishing right from wrong, tends to produce behavior that is simply not wrong, whereas the Christian life should instead be marked by the highest form of right. Rather than ethical reasoning, they stress the importance of meditation on and relationship with God.|`|AA11402196	Theology -- study of God<br>  moral -- how one should live<br>  Christian -- follower of Christ.<br>  <br>  As a follower of Christ, we look to God (via revelation) on how we should live.<br>  <br>  The are other meanings, but this should be the basis (centered).<br>  <br>  In other words, it starts with God, fulfilled by Christ, and it guides us with our daily actions.|`|AA10306529	moral theology is more of a general term because other religions each have their own moral theologies.... christian moral theology..well.. it simply is the moral theology in christian standards...|`|AA11046024	An oxymoron.|`|AA11790150	Probably very similar to Muslim. The one big difference is that Muslims can fight and even kill if there's a strong enough moral case for it; that is in their belief system like. Christians aren't alowed to kill period. Apart from that most things are the same, stealing etc, adultery, all outlawed. Or it used to be, but now that women don't need men anymore, and now that women initiate 93% of divorces, then adultary is fine. - but as we're a dying breed it matters little to the world. [you can't abuse men and expect the world to flourish.]
