gC8xO53Oaa	I agree! I had been wondering the same thing. I guess it's ok to go to a vote, but if it does, there should be a comment just like the asker does.|`|AA10579309	I let questions go to a vote for two reasons:    1) I honestly have a hard time deciding among several good answers    2) I only got one answer, and it was "I don't know."  If the voters vote for no best answer I'll get a refund of my points.|`|AA10025824	Mostly its because the asker doesn't choose a best answer.  Sometimes they may not want to choose a best answer and they let it go to a vote.|`|de61674560750ca671798a74d4f68053aa	I feel that way, too. Like after you've try very hard to answer a question, giving any possible information as detailed as possible, and then all of a sudden, it just went to voting, and then I feel like "wtf? I'd worked my *** off but now all i get is my answer in voting?" It just always annoys me. And to tell the truth, I guess those people just don't take their questions and the answers they got seriously enough, and don't even want to bother themselves choosing the Best Answers, which is so irritating and sad to me.|`|yOLeRiTZaa	.    ~_~.    I agree a lot w/ the 2nd answer. I take every question I answer very serious and try to give the best advice I can. Many of my regular contacts vote for there self, but I can scroll through my A's and every other one says "in voting".    Sometimes I think they aren't happy w/ any replies, or perhaps they have their answer and go on to ask another question. I'm in no way complaining, but I sometimes think people forget this is Yahoo "Answers".    Because I KNOW I gave the best that I had, I get satisfaction from that alone, but it would be nice if anyone in particular was able to help out this guy/gal. RIGHT?    With that said...Is it more flattering getting a B/A from the single person asking -or-By a number of people voting? I'm torn about that one....Still yet, you are helping out THAT PERSON so did it help!    Thanks for asking this question, I've often wondered my self, but was too busy answering to ask!!! I gotta give ya a star!!!    Take Care !!!  Great Question !!!  :)    ------------------------------------ ~_~.    .

RhkKGsipaa	First  reinstall your web cam,  carefully following the prompts.  Then try this: Click messenger top left, scroll down and click  preferences then scroll down  and click webcam where you can make adjustments, click o.k.  To make sure it is o.k.  click messenger top left, scroll down and click my webcam. and your webcam should come on. You should also run your call setup. Click actions top row of the messenger window scroll down click call setup and follow the prompts. When you are chatting with someone click on webcam in the chat window. I hope that is of some help. My own opinion is that if you are going to  webcam regularly download windows live messenger to me it is far better than Yahoo messenger.  http://get.live.com/messenger/features

Your daily limits increase with each new level between levels 1-4, at level 5 all daily limitations on questions and answers are removed.     If Yahoo!

cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	In order to refer to a photo on Yahoo Answers you must upload it to a photo site. Three examples are Photobucket, Flickr, and TinyPic. You then post the complete address, including http://, in your question or answer.    For Photobucket copy the "direct link" under the photo and paste into your question or answer.  For Flickr click on "all sizes" above the picture then copy "Grab the photo's URL" at the bottom.  For TinyPic use the "Direct Link for Layouts". of the guidelines.    ? ??l???q ?

Then go to edit your answers profile under PICTURES, you will see the option to use the 360 pic you have (showing that pic too).|`|7d995b346d4545f9008eac93e0259809aa	I am having the same problem! i have done it before, but with this new account, it will not let me!

Your 360 profile can also be used as your main Yahoo profile.    Once you've signed up for your page, you can't delete it since it's tied to your Yahoo email account. The only way to delete a 360 is to delete the account associated with it. Keep in mind that it's in beta form, so it has been problematic for some users.

Have you checked in your security settings to see what level of security is set? Go to start, settings, control panel, internet options, security, then check level, and see if there is something that might be stopping you from accessing the page. If you just get a grey screen, it could be a site trying to install garbage into your computer, and having a tough time worming it's way through your firewall. Sometimes these sites will not let your browser go.

Go to the "junk" folder---open those emails and then click the "not spam (or not junk) tab and they will be sent back to your inbox.    You really need their address in your address book, to stop any future confusion.  answers-alert@cc.yahoo-inc.com|`|I6dcRgD6aa	did you ask a question that has a word that is being picked up as spam. If you are getting answers to that question in there the word is triggering it to do that.|`|taEGA9PNaa	It's only appropriate since Yahoo sucks on everything related to spam. They clutter your inbox with spam, then miss your important messages (especially if they come from overseas) and put them in your spam folder. Yahoo email is horrible. Make the switch now, bite the bullet and go to gmail. You'll be happier.
MvDu7hZmaa	Well, you will only know what God is saying if you're truly listening.    God does every one of the above...order, request, tell and message.    I believe that God is sending an order when only one option exists.  For example, if your home is being flooded, God is ordering you to leave.    I believe that God is requesting when you have more than a single option.  For example, you can give charitably to someone in need, or not.    I believe that God is telling us something when we are in deep thought.  For example, when thinking about what you should tell a child, or friend who needs your loving advice.    And finally,I believe that God is sending a message when the feeling of revelation hits your spirit.  For example, when you finally realize something that you couldn't figure out before.    I believe that God communicates with us in the same way we communicate with one another.  There are many ways, and many reasons for communication.      A singular mode of communication would mean that God does not consider our individual needs.  God reaches us in different ways for different reasons.|`|OqlXBUsaaa	yes to all, (except for the last two words)|`|c701e5c81d7445bdaf7c9f86b930b3a1aa	This is for Yahoo! Messenger, not religion.

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Any question, at any time, can be removed for violations. These violations can be due to the question or the Best Answer being reported as a violation. Being resolved does not grant the question (or answers) immunity.

If it is not showing, you may need to update your Java code, or you may need to enable scripting. Another possibility is that you may need to clear all cache files, reboot and try it again.

aee448de98ace1d5f73cd00e3967350caa	They are testing a new layout of the homepage by putting a cookie on your system that automatically redirects you.     If you want to keep the old layout, you need to block cookies from yahoo.com. In Internet Explorer 7, click Tools, Internet Options, Privacy tab, Sites. In the address of website box, type yahoo.com then click Block. You can unblock it later by clicking the remove button. The only problem with this is that you cannot log into any yahoo services(like yahoo answers) when the cookies are blocked. Also, look for the Feedback link at the bottom of the page and tell yahoo that you don't like the new layout and you don't want to have to use this workaround.|`|1s3nddaYaa	it changes to like all weird, different color. it does that to me some times and then back to regular yahoo.i dunno what it is lol|`|AA11307940	Yahoo has been testing a new homepage on just a few at a time, usually returning to the original in a few days or sooner.

Some men just believe that a woman's place is in the home, it was once, now it is just a Victorian attitude. I just ignore men like that, treat them with the contempt that they deserve.  I stayed at home to look after my son and like you went back to work for 20 odd years till I retired.  Every woman would probably like to stay at home all the time with their children but they cannot afford to stay at home.  The prices keep rising and its difficult to clothe and shoe children when you have no money, even a part time job helps ease the bills along.

You need to wait for 4 hours after you submit the question and then go back to the question, you will have a blue tab under each answer, "select as best answer", click the tab on the answer you consider to be the best. Rate the answer 1-5 stars, add a comment if you wish, click submit, you're done. 3 points back.    For undecided questions.  Click "VOTE" on any Category.

The fact is that it wasn't a question according to the Community Guidelines, it was "chatting" which is one of the most common violations reported here.

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Wow, did this post twice? Here is my answer from the 'other' question: You have to post the photo to a public access site, like flickr, photobucket, etc. Then you copy & paste the link from there to here. Often this will cause an error999, so you may have to post the question without the link first, then go back and edit the question to add the link.

AA10558731	Your answer was "not an answer", which is a violation of the Community Guidelines. I've received that particular violation notice quite a few times. Some people can take a teasing non-answer in the spirit in which it was intended, but some are sticklers for following the rules. ALL the rules.    I've also discovered that some people have little tolerance for a reply of "do your own homework" to stupid questions such as "who fought in the American Civil War?" or "where is the Panama Canal?" and other questions that can be answered by reading a text book or a quick trip to Wikipedia.    I bet if I got back all the points I've lost due to such violations I'd own Yahoo, lol!|`|AA11408911	This is a classic case of failing to answer the question and as such your content would have broken the community guidelines for chatting. Remember some users come here looking for serious answers, assumptions are not always going to be correct and could also offend users, however in this case you did not post content that helped to resolve the user's question.     All the best  Chrs|`|naySyzfQaa	Someone could have hit report for abuse...I guess. I had the same problem whe I spoke positively about the president.

If you don't have a DIRECT answer to a question, don't post one, no matter how polite, motherly or teasing it is. Posting a 'non-answer' is considered 'pointgaming' (answering only for the points) and is a violation. Your answer is no different than somebody that answers: IDK to a question, sorry.    As for the rude and disrespectful things on here, they too get reported and removed, although maybe not before you are exposed to them. Unfortunately, many times people will avoid reporting such things, assuming that 'somebody else' surely will -- and will focus more on the borderline issues, like your posting, instead.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	answers do not actually have to be any kind of violation. perhaps the person that asked didn't like your reply and was being a B so she reported you.|`|taEGA9PNaa	Don't be too upset. There's waaaay too many waaaay sensitive people on here. You can petition yahoo but you'll never hear anything - only that they'll get back to you in 24 hours, which they never do. Better to do what everyone else does - don't use your real yahoo account for answers but have another one you use for it. If you are in violation too many times, Yahoo will eliminate your whole account, emails and addresses and all, no questions asked and they won't let you back on. It happened to me. OK, I was a little drunk and sarcastic one night and they deleted my account of 10 years because I called this guy a name. Unless you care about your points, just do that, then you can say and do anything you want.

The bubbles read, "Choose as Best Answer," and they appear under each answer. You click the bubble beneath the answer you like best, and then it will take you to a page, where you need to rate the response, and then leave a message to the asker. Then, you scroll down a little and click SUBMIT. The answerer will receive ten points, and you will receive three.    To put your question to vote, you can either wait for the time to expire and then vote for the best answer, or you can go to the pencil beneath your question. If you click on the pencil, three or four tabs (depending on whether you extended the expiration date or not) will pop down, and one of them will read "PUT THIS QUESTION TO VOTE." Then the question will be put to vote, and you and the Yahoo! Answers community will vote for the best answer. You will still receive three points when the question is resolved.
yOLeRiTZaa	.    ~_~.    In my opinion..28% is good. You can't measure yourself against those who have been doing this for a couple years w/ TC status level 7. They have all found their niche and are really the ones (other then the askers) that keep this sight going. If you pay attention to the answers they provide you could learn alot from them.    Quite often it's not what you answer but when you answer. If you are  33 of 37 answers, you are probably over looked. Get lost in the crowd so to speak.    Keep in mind, to answer what you know. That's what makes a TC a TC. Don't help pick out baby names if you're a computer expert.    Hope I comforted your wonder, like I said, I think 28% ain't half bad!!    Take Care !!    ______________________ ~_~.    .|`|G5vGTTqhaa	Give better answers to people thats how they'll pick you|`|s30Duwdraa	I know what you mean... at the beginning i was getting a lot of best answer!

So, find a section you excel in (rather than scattering your answers here and there and everywhere). Keep the answers concise, to the point, but provide enough detail to get the job done right. Make sure you use good spelling and grammar. And stay away from questions that are going to get an excessive amount of answers.    Keep at it, and you will start getting those BAs again.
2Hl4AAP7aa	it is irritating but trolls will be trolls and they do not have the intelligence required to give an educated answer so resort to stupidity which is all they know. trolls are the curse of yahoo answers but it's free so not much can be done unfortunately. you can report them but that is an exercise in futility because it doesn't stop them.strangling them would be good but first we would have to catch them, they are slippery things.|`|qLvhoRpsaa	I see your point. I have been guilty of answering a few of those questions with "what are you doing on YA, you need to see a doctor and we are not qualified" or words to that effect. I did that not for the points, I did it because others are answering with medical type advice and that scares me so I try to point them in the right direction. I explain why I am saying what I am saying. It is usually a long response from me. If I was out for points, I would go to polls & surveys where a lot of people just answer "yes" or "no" to a series of really stupid questions.   There, that is MY two cents.  Peace:)|`|oOwoyV1Zaa	they just want dam points  like i didnt know how to answer this  but i want the points haha|`|Ev473XbHaa	I get that a lot to. It seems to me that your right.

Or, am I pregnant?). Now, I don't think you ask those questions, but yours are probably because you ask really good, sophisticated questions. You sound like a smarty pants you..    Also, I hate the homework help q's. It's more like homework "do it for me!" questions..so yeah, I'd be like, "Research it!" (well, I dont REALLY say that but I should)

Just like in your Sent bin, it is not Bold any more, it's faded even when you just sent something. Many think someone has been reading their mail in the sent bin. It's just the new way that's all.

AA11307940	Open the inbox, click View All Messages, then unread messages. If you have any late arrivals or in folders they will show. If not then it's because Yahoo says this is a glitch. They have been contacted about this and say they have their engineer working on the problem. We all went through this for awhile and it did clear up on it's own. We don't have to fix anything. Switching back and forth from the classic mail to the new mail doesn't fix it. This has been happening in the classic since yahoo has been doing upgrades to the mail.

You will have to start over again. <br>  <br>  One possible option is to contact the YA team directly at y_answrs_team@yahoo.com (missing 'e' is deliberate).

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	If a person posts an email address, you use your normal email account to email them at that address, just as you would any other person. However, it is not recommended that you do that here, because you don't know (1) if the email they are posting is really theirs and (2) if you email them, they have YOUR email address and they may be spammers.    What IS recommended is that you click on their profile and see if they allow email contact there. If they do, there will be a blue link that says: "Email ". Click that. Your email will go to their account, but it will be sent BY Yahoo Answers, so they won't get your email address. Their response (if they make one) will come to YOUR email address, but will be from Yahoo Answers, so you won't see their email address.
R5IAmQAVaa	A lot of the times, the "trolls" are pretty funny.  Some of the stuff I get a good laugh at.  I've "trolled" a few times myself... sometimes the question is just so stupid, it deserves a stupid answer.  You ask, "My boyfriend and I had sex with out protection, he came inside of me.  I havn't had my periord in six months, and I have a huge belly.  Can I be pregnant?"  ... I'm going to answer, "No, you are definatly not pregnant.  Go back out and have sex with as many guys as you can as often as you can and without protection."    The ones I really hate are the questions where people already know the answer, they are just looking to stir up a poop strom and get people worked up.  I'll "troll" those questions.  You ask, "Why are Republicans gun waving rednecks"... you are going to get trolled.    Other times, the "trolls" are telling you stuff and being blatently honest.  It may not be what you are looking for, it may be on the harsh side, but it may often be the truth.  You ask "I let me daughter go to an underage party.  It got busted by the cops, and she got arrested.  What should I do?"  I'm going to answer, "Punch yourself in the face"... Honestly, what more can you do?    When posting questions, you just need to understand that not everyone is going to respond the way you want them too.  Sometimes you may get offended, but you need to lear to turn a cheek and move on.|`|DXV5l417aa	personally i dont think theyre real at all especially not the one in billy goats gruff or whatever the name is|`|ARAYm7BLaa	Immigration is pretty bad...can't see why people have to be so judgemental all the time - I guess they must be pretty unhappy underneath it all.|`|gIszhbQNaa	Maybe this category, or maybe the Polls & Surveys category.|`|DHzwr1braa	Society and Cultures      There so annoying, but I'm at work and it makes the day go quick|`|Jj8JlApvaa	R/S is far the worst,   no sense of humour.|`|5p7gpj36aa	What are trolls?|`|081NXWAeaa	they're always out on P&S    annoying people!|`|rpqHLJGGaa	They`re like dog crap they get all over the place|`|onwVYZ9Aaa	A nice cup of tea would go down well|`|capCtdkeaa	theres only one place for trolls in this world, and thats hiding under a bridge giving the billy goats gruff some grief
nKwcGLQraa	1- that table or whatever it is around the left corner is very distracting. so is the painting on the right beside the door (although not as distractign as table). you could fix it by either croppping it or putting the main object off center to the left so we can see more of the painting. it gives a nice effect when things are orr-center. I really like the lighting though :).    2- well, looks your trying to convey not to commit suicide. i think. it kinda looks like he/she hung herself like in a crucifix. which is kinda creepy (in a good way)    3-well, i sure dont wanna commit suicide like that :p. it makes me a little sad too. and mysterious. I think its mainly because the things are black and white (or is it sepia?), it gives a sad/lonely feeling. The simplicity of it also emplifies it all. and the fact that he/she is hanging like jesus did when he died...    hope it was a good survey :).|`|cTvP6j7Haa	I don't usually swear, but WTF sounds appropriate!

Los Mexicanos, Guatemaltecos, Hondure?os Peruanos y todo el que hable el idioma Espa?ol, al poco tiempo de residir en los E.U.A. adoptan lo que llamamos Spanglish, una nefasta mezcla de Espa?ol e Ingls que desvirta por igual ambos Idiomas.

AA12367392	Mate have done the same thing, have a y7mail account and a yahoo classic account, the y7 account wouldn't let me do anything, it was like starting over, you cant even transfer your qna points, so I gave up and went back to the classic account, I left the other one open though because some friends and family still use it, I dont know if anything can be done, maybe try contacting yahoo, they maybe able to help, goodluck! :)|`|2lY6yn5Xaa	Wish i could help but i dont even know what Y7 mail is.|`|3mJiPveSaa	I think Y7 is just the name for the Australian "brand" of yahoo. I usually see it when getting/sending mail to my Aussie friends or clicking on yahoo links from their mail or pages. If you've set up an account on yahoo as well as yahoo7, I think it means you have 2 different yahoo accounts. If you mean transfer contacts from your yahoo to y7 account, i don't know of an easier way than forwarding mail from contacts from old to new account, then adding them to your contact list there.    Now, aside from that, if your problem is that you've somehow set your yahoo7 mail account to "beta" mode - most people I know find this pretty irritating - inside the yahoo mail account itself, there is an option to change it back to the "classic" instead of beta version of mail. For this, look up toward the top of the page by your sign-name for "Classic" and click on that.    Good luck and feel free to email me if you have other questions!|`|NxGqxsBvaa	I'm not familiar with Y7 mail either.  But it sounds as if it is something you would find in the middle east.

Pero si queres tener calidad fotografica te recomiendo lo que se llama Papel FOTOGRAFICO, que es la que te va a ayudar a conservar la calidad y ni se te va a echar a perder la foto para nada. Lee el manual de tu impresora por si no necestas alguna cosa adicional para imprimir fotos.

niivsTVxaa	Cheating on Yahoo! Answers is a very childish, immature and sad thing to do, you do not really gain anything from getting many points & lots of best answers if its illegitimately done.    All they are doing is: Wasting their time / having a statistic in their profile that doesn't stand for anything / their Y!A statistics are all made up with cheating.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	No wonder his account is private! He doesn't anybody knowing that he cheats! Really, though. 189% best answer in ten days or so? I highly doubt that.    Anyway, like Jake said, it is very, very childish to cheat. It doesn't get you anything. Yes, you get points, but what are they if you aren't receiving those points honestly.

Messenger>Click on Messenger>Select My Contact Details>At the top is Name: followed by   ?First (Name)  ?Last (Name)  ?Nickname    To stop Yahoo! Messenger accessing the default details stored in your Yahoo! Account information (where it gets your first and last name) ALL 3 fields should be complete, if You leave your first name blank it will extract that from your account details, if you dont want your last name showing, enter text in your Last field, once you have completed the form, click Apply, click OK.     if you want to make sure your default details are never sent out then you need to edit your account information (the form you filled out when you signed up for your yahoo id)   https://login.yahoo.com/config/login_ver...    Once there...  1.Ignore the first instance of your Names, scroll down the page until you see Address / Contact Information, click Edit...  2. Now at the top of the page should be Your Name, edit both fields  3. Hit Finished, if prompted, then confirm your password, you will be redirected back to your Yahoo! Account Information page where you can see the changes, if you're happy with the results, click Finish again, then exit out of your browser and log back into Yahoo! Messenger.    To change the details people have if you are already on their friends list they will need to delete you from their friends list AND address book and then re-add you, or you can sent them your Contact Details    Here are the articles covering the options at http://www.wackyb.co.nz/Yahoo!_Messenger...  and http://www.wackyb.co.nz/Yahoo!_Messenger...    If you need more help :)    Please be aware the above will not impact on ppl who already have you on their friends list / address book, they will need to delete you from both then re-add you to remove your name etc, or you could try sending them your contact details via Yahoo Messenger

People are proud of who and what they are and that's why they want to  celebrate and honor their ancestors, nothing more than that in my opinion. <br>   I also agree with the ''get over it'' that you have posted.  That stuff is just foolish also in my opinion.  I don't care who calls me what.  What does it <br>  matter ?  None at all.  And it shouldn't to anybody else either.

YnCUyvK7aa	Depending on what was emailed, you probably won't be able to, as most providers have Privacy Policies.  The simplest thing you can do is to block that email address so no more emails can be sent to you from it.<br>  <br>  But these same providers [Yahoo!, Google, MSN] have a Customer Care department as well.  You can go to their homepage and find it.  Then forward them the email stating that this account was not created by you, but someone impersonating you.  This will at least give them a heads up, and you can save a copy of your email to verify that they were notified of the impersonation.  This becomes important if the other *you* decides to email your boss, other relatives, the police, or anyone else in such a way that it makes you look bad or is unlawful.  And depending on the content of the current email [harassing, threatening] you might want to get the police involved.<br>  <br>  They will be able to find out the identity of the person behind this, but unless it goes to court, you probably won't be told the person's identity.

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Questions are prescreened for certain words and/or phrases, to help spot violations. Flagged questions are held for staff review. So some questions may not post for hours – or may get violated by staff. Delayed questions will be off the front page, so get very few answers.<br>  <br>  If you are posting questions with links in them, this can delay the question posting or even cause it to not post. To get around this, post the question without the link first, then return to the question and use the PENCIL under it to put the link in the ‘additional details’ section.<br>  <br>  <EDIT: Sorry, yes, that is the case. Their viewpoint on here is 'better safe than sorry'. Your 'suicide' question is probably one of those -- any question with that word in it runs the risk of being flagged. But I answered it for you anyway. That is where fans come in handy. They still can see your question and/or get notice of it, even if it does not hit the main site.>
