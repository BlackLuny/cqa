DzGKfdKnaa	because the calf who that milk belongs to got turned into veal. The cow was only impregnated for milk and not to feed it baby.    In this way vegans do not wish to finacially support the veal industry.|`|HuJmTs8xaa	Because the cows are kept in small cages all their lifes and injected with hormones that make them produce more milk. Their babies are used as veal and the cows never get any ounce of happiness, never see outside, never do anything. A lonely, useless life all so humans can consume their milk, which by the way, tastes horrible. The last time I had milk was in cereal and I thought, Why am I doing this? This milk isn't for me and the cows suffered. I became a vegan the next week.|`|Am7J9MVBaa	It's true that it relieves the cow, we realize this!    But, the treatment of these cows is not always good. They are trapped in small housing, fed bad food to make there milk better, separted from there babies when they're young... etc|`|MbSSIOpSaa	Because drinking cow's milk is weird and disgusting. It has no nutritional value and is full of puss, hormones, and bacteria. We are the only animals on earth that drink the milk of another animal or drink milk as adults.     Since I stopped eating dairy I went from using my inhaler 7-8 times a day (and taking several other asthma medications) to using it a few times a year. It's amazing! I feel healthier and happier and am a lot less congested.|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	actually, milk is for baby calves not humans.    everyone keeps blabbering on about how cows produce more milk then needed for their young. SOO not true. When fed natural feed free of hormones, mothers cows produce only the amount needed for the calf in a day(just a few quarts of milk!!!)|`|LnjyQDpBaa	Because that cow was most likely bred and kept in a small area for that milk, they didn't roam the fields then walked over to an outhouse and went.|`|0ujpiBTCaa	It requires the exploitation of an animal. Or, billions of animals. Dairy cows are often subject to disease, infection, confinement, mistreatment....I like cows, I think they are lovely creatures.  Why cause them any unnecessary suffering?    It also supports the murder of animals. The average dairy cow is only allowed to live 3-4 years. Most male calves born to them are used for veal.    Edit-  To address the "pressure" concern: Dairy cows produce way, way too much milk because we have bred them to do so. They are also impregnated unnaturally often to keep them producing milk for the babies that are taken from them so we can have that milk.|`|nxSsbQkYaa	I became vegan initially because of the awful things I read about what happened to cows in these farms.  But then of course poeple say that milking cows relieves them of pressure etc..  but after the thought of what they did (impregnating a cow to get milk from it) I thought it was quite disgusting to be drinking the milk intended for baby cows, I just can't bring myself to eat or drink anything that has milk from another animals breast..|`|7cjqT33Baa	I stay away from it because I think it leads to heart attacks and that we aren't meant to consume it in the first place.  When I eat dairy, it messes up my whole digestion.  I get backed up.  I think that it does that our arteries too.  Have you ever microwaved cheese and saw how caked on it is to the plate and almost impossible to clean off?  You have to soak it.  Well, that isn't something I want in my body.    I avoid all dairy as much as possible.|`|j4a5kiu5aa	The dairy industry keeps the cows pregnant artificially in order to continue pumping them of their milk.  Its not natural and it means there are synthetic hormones in your milk.    It is not necessarily a moral thing.  Dairy and animal products are extremely acidic and wreak havoc on the PH of the body, and not to mention digestion.    There are many reasons, you could just research it yourself.      Edit:  acidic=mucus.  So the girl who uses her inhaler less has cleared her body of mucus by avoiding mucus forming acidic foods, ie dairy and meat.
msNXomjTaa	Dairy Queen has a cookie dough Blizzard, which my daughter really likes.    As for brands: there are some national brands, but a lot of regional ones.  E.g., in Ottawa, Lois and Primas is the best (IMHO), and amongst the best ice cream anywhere.  But, it is only available here, and only from their own stores.  You will need to check out your local area.    If it were me, I'd try them all, and go back for the one I liked best!  Of course, I am rather fond of ice cream...|`|Ov83HJEFaa	I personally like Vanilla Dibs :)    They come in packs of 26, and you can buy them in any convenience store. :)     Yayyy.

Other than that, loading it up with seasonings is about the only other way to alter the smell.  Not sure what else to tell you.   Garlic pepper or just garlic powder will help out A LOT - it'll probably make your roommates complain that now they're hungry though... wait a sec - is THAT why they're complaining about the smell -because it makes them hungry & their broke azzes can't afford food??  lol!  (j/k)|`|nOVSf06Raa	you could add a bit of seasoning  on them if you like , have a fan on, open the window a bit , light a candle while you are cooking , Just don't forget to turn it off  ,or change brand , or you could tell them to do the cooking  for once .|`|gFzmBjqPaa	Turn on a vent and get some scented candles.

Always check the recipe and be sure you have all of the ingredients before you start.|`|lTkYWiy5aa	I totally recommend the cookbook How to Cook Everything by Mark Bittman. It has simple, every day recipes and easy to follow instructions for someone who is learning to cook.    Here's a recipe from my collection to start you off:    BARBEQUE MEAT LOAF    1 ? pounds fresh ground beef  1 c. fresh bread crumbs  1 onion, diced  1 egg, lightly beaten  1 ? tsp. salt  ? tsp. pepper  2 (8-oz) cans tomato sauce  3 tbsp vinegar  3 tbsp. brown sugar  2 tbsp. Dijon mustard  2 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce  ? c. water, to thin sauce if necessary    Preheat oven to 350oF    Mix together beef, bread crumbs, onion, egg, salt, pepper and ? c. of the tomato sauce. Form this mixture into a loaf and place it into a shallow pan. Stir together the remaining tomato sauce, vinegar, sugar, mustard, Worcestershire and the water (if too thick). Pour this sauce over the meatloaf. Bake for 1 hour, basting every 15 minutes with the pan juices.|`|mSHxDFcJaa	You can find a recipe online for anything your craving.

I'd start with some easy stuff and then you can get more advanced as you go on.  I have a theory that if you can:  1. Cook Pasta  2. Bake chicken  3. Make Hamburgers  4. Make eggs (which you clearly can)  5. Make a salad    You will never be without a good dinner.  I would find some simple recipes online that have only a handful of ingredients and are quick and easy.  As long as you can follow directions, you can cook a great meal.  Here are some of my favorite recipe sites:  www.myrecipes.com  www.epicurious.com  www.foodtv.com  www.allrecipes.com    They have really good search engines on them.  You can look it up by ingredient, diet, ethnicity, and how hard or easy it is to make.  Good luck!|`|2hAuIg5baa	make french toast! just soak bread in raw eggs on both sides then fry till it on both sides until it looks done! it should be like a godie brown colour jus try not to burn it! ull no its burnt if its black and theres smoke :)|`|UCO7blmKaa	start with breakfast stuff they are easy!  try making french toast one morning its good and easy!   things you need: 1eggs (maybe two) depending on how much u wanna make, sugar (depending on how sweet u want it), milk just a little to make it creamy maybe like 2 tablespoon  per egg, and a little bit of cinnamon.  mix it all together and then bring your bread out, deep it in the egg mix then cook it in butter until brown! yummm!!! put some syrup and your golden!      oh yea u should book mark this link!! this is how i learned how to cook stuff!|`|gFzmBjqPaa	To make rice you really should measure.  For every cup of rice I use 1 and 1/2 cup of water.  It says use 2 to 1 but I find this never fails.    You can find some chili recipes on line.  That would be good to start and can last a while.  Plus you can put things you like in it.      The best tip I can give you is FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS to the minute until you get the hang of things.  Get a measuring cup and some measuring spoons.  These are essential.    Taste what you cook and add what you like to improve it if necessay.|`|MOCFxEblaa	Breakfast: French toast- mix egg and milk and cinnamon then dip bread in the mixture then cook it on the stove for few mins until it s golden brown.    Lunch: Grilled Chicken Sandwich- get a boneless chicken breast and smash it until it s thin then put it on the stove. let it cook on each side for like 5 - 10 mins. when it s like white and brown. then put the bread in the toaster. when it s done put lettuce, tomato, mayo and the chicken on it then enjoy!!    Dinner: Pasta- get any noodles you want. cook them in the boil water for 10 mins then drain the water from the noodles. then get the sauce from can and put it in the noodles and cook again on the stove. add garlic, parsley and parmnsa cheese then enjoy!!! but, if u want garlic bread then buy french bread then add mix butter, garlic and parsley then add it on the bread and cook it in the oven 10 mins.|`|hVICguqGaa	try going to google and just type in easy recipes they will give you an array of websites with a variety of recipes. Most will say 'easy, medium, difficult' or have a star rating for difficulty.     Since you cook rice you should buy some and look at the back of the box and see what they suggest... remember you can always dress it up!  example:   Spanish rice (i normally use zatarans) that box says add 15 oz of diced tomatoes   i normally add sauteed onions (1/2 a yellow or white) and green and red bell peppers (half of each) and a can of corn 15 oz as well as precooked Italian sausage.  dice the onions and cook those with the sausage with a splash of olive oil when the sausage is done add the diced bell peppers, drain the corn and add that too! Keep on very low heat, and keep covered the steam that forms will start to cook the peppers and rice. NOTE you still have to stir it! when rice is done mix it all together and eat!  I normally pepper to taste - doesnt really need salt. and if you like spicy stuff add some creole seasoning! i normally cook the sausage with that and sprinkle some into the rice as its cooking. If you have never tried it add sparingly!|`|bgmUa2ghaa	I am a vegan and here are two really healthy "natural" easily-prepared recipes (all this food is easily and cheaply found @ Food Lion):  1) Black-Bean Burritos       Ingredients: 1 can of black beans (drained of any liquid in can)                         1 cup brown rice (cooked, add 2 cups boiling water to    make, stir every five minutes on low heat for about 15 mins)                         tortillas (any size you want)                         1/4--1/2 cup salsa (whatever is your preference)  Directions: Put the black beans, brown rice (already cooked), and salsa in a sauce pan on medium-low heat for about 5-10 minutes. Heat each tortilla for about 30 secs as you complete the burritos. Add cut up vegetables or more salsa to your preference.    2) Vegetable soup      Ingredients: 1 can diced potatoes                       1 can vegetable soup (I prefer Swanson brand)                        1 cup of barley (kind of like rice; 1 cup barley and 2 cups boiling water, stir occasionally for about 15 minutes on low heat)                        1 carrot, sliced (slices about 1/4 inch or smaller)                        1 green onion (optional, sliced 1/4 inch)  Directions: Microwave diced potatoes (and the liquid in the can) for about 5 minutes. Put vegetable soup in medium/large pan on stove, turn to medium-high heat. Slice vegetable(s). Put the vegetables and prepared barley in soup, keep stirring. Put diced potatoes, when done in microwave, into soup. Turn to medium-low heat for about ten minutes while stirring, then serve.

zawmsUO1aa	Oh, you'd know.     FunFact: The speed with which nuts turn rancid is in direct proportion to the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acid they contain.    Fastest to slowest to turn rancid, in order:     1) English walnuts    2) Pecans     3) Brazil nuts    4) Peanuts     5) Almonds and pistachios    6) Cashews and hazelnuts    Unshelled nuts, protected by nature's armor, will keep for a year or even two, especially if refrigerated. Squirrels are able to successfully store acorns over the winter because the cold slows the two chemical reactions responsible for rancidity: oxidation and hydrolysis, which are caused by air and moisture, respectively. So if your nuts were fresh to begin with  that is, bought from a reputable, high-volume supplier  their shells might keep them fresh until next Christmas if the nuts are stored in a cool place. (Cashews, by the way, are never sold in their shells, which contain corrosive and poisonous resins.) Shelled nuts, especially those that have been chopped or roasted, are more prone to rancidity. Secured in an airtight container, they can be stored for four or five months in the refrigerator and for up to a year in the freezer.    How can you tell if a nut is rancid? In the store, sneak a sample if possible. Smell is not reliable; taste is the best test. If it tastes sour or rank, shop somewhere else. When buying from a catalogue, you just have to trust your supplier.    Rancid nuts have a very pronounced smell and taste - you'd spit it out immediately.|`|Eb3SnljMaa	sometimes a few may be a bit off in a package and well if it tasted funky then well there you have your own answer....that particular one wasnt good. if you try another an it still bad, take the bag and the reciept and return it to trader joes..
73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	Keep the broccoli out of the mix - it's too overwhelming.  Add some onions (if you have them), garlic, parsley, salt & pepper.  Not sure about the cherry tomatoes either - might want to peel & seed them as their skin can be pretty tough...then again, you could always strain that out later.|`|gFzmBjqPaa	You can, just add some herbs if you have them.  An onion would help greatly as would garlic.  Add the tomato last.  If you put the broc, celery and carrots on to cook let it come to a boil and then cook for about 1/2 hour or more than I would put it in a blender and puree it.  Cook with a small amount of water to concentrate the flavors then you can add more water to taste at the end.

AA12031316	Sure they are fooling their customers, and the customers are blindly trusting them to provide health food.  The calorie and nutrition count is also for a 1/2 cup serving-who the heck eats only 1/2 a cup of cereal?  So, if you eat a whole bowl, you are taking in 4 or 5 times what is listed as a "serving".   In a nutshell, if you are eating ANYTHING out of a box or can, its not healthy.  Commercial foods use the cheapest ingredients they can, and have to add loads of preservatives to give them shelf life.  They add buzzwords that trick consumers into thinking they are eating health, such as "whole grain" (means nothing more than a whole grain, such as wheat was used, but does not say that the grain had been genetically modified or processed to the point that its nutritional value was depleted), or "natural", which simply means it is something not lab grown (dog poo and cyanide are natural too),  or "high in fiber" (so is my kitchen sponge, and the "fiber" in those foods is often cellulose, which is the same stuff that is IN my kitchen sponge).  Consumers have been duped for so long that the companies just toss some comforting words on the outside of box that contains nothing but artificial "nutrition" in the form of synthetic vitamins.  (the "iron" in fortified foods is actually metal iron shavings-crush some cereal up in a zip lock bag, add a little water and put a magnet to it-you will see the iron shavings, which is NOT  a type of iron the human body can assimilate)  Most cereals contain enough sugar and preservatives to completely override any slight nutritional value they may have.  I prefer to make my own homemade cereals using organic, truly whole grains, such a quinoa, buckwheat and oat groats.  That way, I can control the ingredients and flavors.  Sadly, its not just the cereals-its ANY commercial food.|`|AA10900111	No, they're heavily processed, full of sugar, and not at all good for you. Eat a bowl of oatmeal or some fruit instead.|`|1TvtX9D3aa	well in 1996 the government required all cereals to be fortified with folic acid which helps a lot of pregnant women out. check out the vitamin/mineral content.|`|MX6aJfzFaa	Yes, they are good for you in moderation.    It's more about the Fiber in those cereals|`|AA11437688	i agree. im sure it's not the worst of foods but all that sugar cannot be good for you.  I think it's just to fill a person up but it still tastes great.|`|AwEspXiiaa	No that's bad,  it gives you diarrhea  no that's bad you don't want that.|`|34FJSmr7aa	your right!it's not good for you they are just saing all that junk just so people can buy that cereal but it's not true|`|qpOrgpV5aa	I've been eating the stuff for years and i'm 2nd on my high-school cross country team (i'm a sophmore)|`|xasAaGFaaa	any of those cereals that are full of sugar like that are not good for you. wheaties are good, cheerios are good, total is good, a lot of oat bran crunch types are tasty and pretty good too. but stay away from cereals especially like frosted flakes|`|F3psnNyLaa	personally, i like all of these though regular rice crispies are preety boring so i eat choconilla! is uber awshumm|`|Aej3lgQZaa	Not really.    The idea is that if you ate a single serving of cereal instead of a McD's breakfast you will lose more weight. duh!     It isn't that the breakfast is healthy, it is just that a single serving of cereal is rather low-cal. And the milk you add to it is a great low-fat protein.     It isn't bad food, but it is generally in itself low in protein, so it isn't ideal either. Fruits, veggies, egg whites or white meat chicken would be healthier.|`|hVjxNhJWaa	they are better than hotcakes, omeletes, potatoes, sausage, ham, bacon etc.  If not cereal, eat a piece of fruit and toast for breakfast with oj.|`|3d5b2006369d379cd04e938a9cd52652aa	No, frosted cereals have to much sugar which could add weight to your body and could cause a medical problem. So, try to get plain cereals and add the sweetener to it yourself. Things like shredded wheat and Grape-nut flakes are a better for you.|`|hneetSf2aa	LOL i know OMG....they think everything has to do with calories and calories alone|`|GXrHjEgvaa	No, but straight oatmeal is great|`|WjSJBWl7aa	Of course not! It's all crap. They say it's good to SELL.    Oats however are good for breakfast :) and they taste goood.|`|luZso4I9aa	special k, just right, Cheerios and neutral grain are really good for you|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Many of them are enriched with vitamins and minerals and the milk does supply some vitamins as well as protein, so while they are not terrible, ultimately they are not great either.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	they do fool their customers so dont' eat them.|`|gpON465Iaa	special k and rice krispies are ok, I like oatmeal, cheerios, Kashi - big trick is to use Soy milk, I like Silk Very Vanilla, tastes good|`|cBhlsMOoaa	No, its not a great part of this breakfast...|`|ROWNVIUVaa	Special K and Rice Krispies are actually pretty good things to have for breakfast. Anything frosted is probably not a good idea. Of course the commercials will be misleading and show athletes. In the early days of baseball some players endorsed cigarette brands.|`|fQgbBx7caa	No, they just tell you that so you will buy them.|`|AVYUwkftaa	Yes. I think so. :) special K is great if you want to loose weight.   Frosted flakes, good just to eat for breakfast.   Rice crispies... that's FULL of sugar. No I don't think that this is good for the body. I hate rice crispies|`|ruBJ1KbIaa	Well it really depends on your perspective of it. If you are an athlete and lift weights or workout Alot than having a little bit of sugar once in a awhile is good for you. If you are just a couch potato then no they are not. The reason is that athletes are usually Alot lighter than obese people and they have Alot more muscle in them. The more muscle you have the more carbs your body burns and that is how you get skinnier. Obese people on the other hand do not have as much muscle and their thyroid does not have as much power to burn fat because they do not have alot of muscle. In some ways, yes they are healthy for you but in some ways no they are not healthy for you. On them commercials you do not see an obese person sitting at a table eating cereal. You always see skinny people eating it to make you think that.   I hope i helped you!!!
AA12185092	Dealcoholized beverages, where they exist, only give a generic representation of the beverage they replace. I don't know about gin but I suppose you could order a tonic water and add a dose of juniper extract from your purse. If you've got  a taste for a particular wine or gin, you need the real thing. You can enjoy without getting drunk by slowing down your drinking, and spending more time just savoring the flavor and aroma. The main danger in this approach is developing a taste for expensive stuff, but hey, you're only buying one. Drink a glass of water afterward.|`|ErSbeRlzaa	To me the whole concept of having a dozen of nice cold beers is to get pissed outta my head, never drink wine so i wouldn't know not elegant you see =D|`|kzkrll3Xaa	drink nonalcoholic wine and beer etc then. gin? just get juniper flavoured stuff. i feel great boozing.|`|vtixxvU0aa	you could always try grog, water + booze  = all the taste and half the.....snooze|`|AA10438532	i don't know if they make non alcohol gin but i do know there are some pretty good n/a beers. i'm the same way, don't like to get drunk.|`|9b46fa1bcd4de3f2eed9af5a9e409c3eaa	i only drink beer and then only in the pub with my mates.i like the taste of the beer and the sociability of the pub but i don't like being drunk.when the effects start to kick in,that's when i head for home.so i'm with you.|`|HimBbU6caa	No. If wasn't for the intoxication I would never drink alcohol.|`|qPbrv7qHaa	It may make me sound dependent, but i do enjoy being intoxicated...    People will throw all kinds of crap at me, but i love being able to drop my inhibitions automatically the way alcohol allows me, its a good way to relax.    Its over drinking that causes trouble, inhibitions not only drop, they disappear completely...and thats just dangerous.|`|gfksposqaa	You need to stop being a square and force yourself to aquire the liking of getting drunk, everybody's doing it!|`|eYTuivypaa	Why dont you drink non alcoholic drinks. You can buy beer and wine with no alcohol in it.    Just an idea, honestly though, i love to get a bit tipsy, brings out the inner child in me! Its all down to personal preference.|`|AA12350537	Well there is such a thing as alcohol free beer? Or Schloer? (alcohol free wine). Or maybe you like the burning effect at the back of your throat? I doubt many people do though.... Drinking without getting drunk kind of defeats the purpose IMO but that's fair enough if you don't enjoy that feeling at all|`|6a71385d55f4347ddf8136454d3986b0aa	You've got this the wrong way round. Drinking booze is nothing to do with thirst. That's why they invented alcopops, so all the wannabe boozers can get mashed without having to endure the taste of booze. Lol. I don't drink booze for the effects or the flavour, especially not the flavour, and I want too much out of life, to rot my brain away on foul tasting stuff that probably should only be used to remove paint.    So no, I don't wish I could drink booze without getting drunk, because I don't drink booze. Life is too much fun to pish it away getting pished.|`|Kaudz4Msaa	Yes, because I have a child.    My advice is, you probably do like the effects a little bit, but you're kind of a "lightweight," in that you get drink quickly.  Most wine drinkers tend to drink almost daily, so they usually have a certain tolerance built up.  Just drink less and make sure to drink food with it.    Not all foods are equally effective in preventing drunkenness.  Carbs and sugars will accelerate drunkenness....so no pretzels or bread or dessert with the wine.  Proteins, fats, and fibers (vegetables) will take longer to break down, so they also will prevent the alcohol from passing too quickly through your system.  (Think buffalo wings, guacamole...to quote Bruce Springsteen).     Make sure you do not drink sweet wine, because this contains sugar which accelerates the drunkenness.  Red has a little more alcohol than white.  A nice chardonnay or chablis, maybe a sauvignon blanc, that is not sweet, will be a weaker wine but still enjoyable.|`|gbj9Uoaaaa	A lot of alcoholics started out like that and then got a taste for it. How about just having tonic with ice and lemon, just think of what else you could spend your money on!|`|9bYEMrb9aa	Yes!|`|oyQRGC0Caa	If you don't like it don't do it.|`|kFlMHSKIaa	You can certainly get alcohol free wine - red, white or rose.

Worst comes to worst, you get a mild stomach ache for a day or too while your body fights off the infection you may get. Hope all works out!|`|Eb3SnljMaa	wel they were not raw, just not fully cooked. and no you wont die or anything of that nature. bacon is a smoked meat and for the most part ready to eat, it just tastes better crisp. so dont worry nothing serious will happen...worse case is it may upset your stomach but no harm will come to you.|`|892ac06a89f7bb97d28fcdf4b7818388aa	Yes, you could.

Stir in the ricotta, egg and chicken, 1/2 cup parmesan, and     Melt the butter and remaining oil in a pan and sprinkle in the flour, let the butter and flour bubble for 2-3 min. Slowly add the cream and broth. Adding alternatly, and letting it thicken slightly between each addition.    In a small bowl mix remaining parm with the mozzerella.    Pour approx 3/4 cup of the white sauce in the bottoom of a 9x13 casserole dish. Lay down one ;ayer or fnnodles and then add 1/3 of the chicken mix, white sauce, and about 1/4 of the cheeses.    Repeat ending up with about 1/2 the cheese mix on top so it is extra cheese on top.    Bake at 350 uncovered for 35-40 min. Or until hot and bubbly.

19XMgD2Xaa	Ale can tend to be a little heavier on the stomach.  The difference is the yeast used its eather lager yeast or ale yeast.  Lager yeast is used to make most of the American pilsners famous today, which tend to be a little lighter on the stomach.  Ales are darker (they are also older, the first recorded lagers came about in the 1700s b/c lagers have to ferment in cooler temperatures than ales,) than Lagers.  It depends on the brew, there's really no set taste for ale and lager, there's too many variable to pinpoint (malts, hops, water, acid, alcohol, brew method, vat shape, etc...)|`|AA10438532	it is  a personal choice. there are literally thousands of choices for either.   it's fun to get some friends together for a beer tasting|`|CGnL2nS0aa	That question is not answerable by anyone except YOU.    I love Ales and want nothing to do with a Lager. You may feel the same way, or you may prefer a Lager. Only you can answer that.|`|2zd9OjeMaa	Depends upon which ale and which lager.|`|W1MgefrWaa	It all depends on your taste.  Ales tend to be hoppy and therefore bitter.  Lagers are not as bitter, but not as much flavor.  As far as heavy, I would say that to me an ale is actually lighter.  Personally I prefer dark beers like a porter, and they do tend to be heavier, but not bitter at all.|`|vtixxvU0aa	i like ales, lagers taste a bit too carbonated|`|S6P9gSX8aa	tryyy it..

Preparation of ingredients    4 tablespoons oil for frying    Egg mixture (beat together until slightly foamy)*  4 eggs  1/4 tsp. salt      1/3 cup chopped scallions, in pea-sized pieces, including green part *  6 Chinese dried mushrooms: soak in hot water until spongy, discard stems, cut caps into 1/4" squares. *  6 ounces Smithfield ham or Cantonese barbecued por,k cut into 1/4" cubes *    Shrimp Mixture (mix in a bowl. Refrigerate before use) *    4 ounces fresh shrimp: shell, devein, rinse in running cold water, pat dry, cut into peanut-sized pieces.  1/2 tsp cornstarch  1/2 teaspoon pale dry sherry    1/3 cup fresh or frozen green peas *        Sauce mixture (Mix in a bowl) *    2 tablespoons thin soy sauce  2 tbs. black soy sauce, (substitute 1 tbsp thin soy sauce & 1 tbsp. molasses)  1/4 tsp. salt  1/2 tsp. sugar  1/8 tsp white pepper    4 cups cold cooked long-grain rice; cook a day in advance, and keep chilled in refrigerator (left over steamed rice)  1 teaspoon sesame seed oil    Directions for cooking    1) Heat wok over high heat. Swirl in 2 tablespoons oil for frying. When oil is hot, pour half the egg mixture into wok and swirl it around, spreading it into a thin pancake. Turn pancake when it is set. Remove from pan before it is golden brown. Cook remaining egg mixture in the same manner. Cut pancakes into 1/2" squares. Set aside.    2) Heat wok over high heat. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil for frying. When oil is hot, add scallions, mushrooms, and ham or pork. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds. Add shrimp mixture. Stir-fry until shrimp turns whitish (less than 20 seconds). Add peas. Stir in sauce mixture. mix well. Break up lumps in cooked rice, and add it along with egg squares. Stir-fry for 3 to 5 minutes or until cooked rice is thoroughly hot. Swirl in sesame seed oil, mix well. Put on a serving platter, and serve hot.        Plain rice (makes about 6 cups of rice)    Preparation of ingredients  2 cups long grain rice; wash and rinse in cold water until water is not cloudy, drain  3 cups cold water    Directions for cooking  1) Use a 3 quart pot with a tight lid. Put in the washed rice and add the water. Cook over medium heat without a cover. When it is boiling, you will see that the water is very foamy, almost obscuring the rice. Do not go away! Stand by and watch it closely. You will see the water evaporating to the point where many small holes (like craters) appear in the rice. The Chinese call them rice eyes.    2) Put lid on, turn heat to very low, and cook for 10 minutes. Then turn off heat, but do not remove the pot or uncover it. Let it stay covered for 15 minutes or more. (Do not peek during this 25 minutes! Otherwise the magic steam will escape; you will have half-cooked rice for not having faith!)    3) Remove the cover. Loosen with a fork or chopsticks. Serve hot. (or in this case, reserve 3 cups for the above recipe. Remember the rice must be cold to use in stir-fried rice recipe.)|`|5e3091fe7146c0eacb3a0e270b6844c5aa	Check out these sites for Korean, Japanese, and Indian rice dishes.    http://www.koreanrestaurantguide.com/rec...    http://japanesefood.about.com/library/re...    http://www.bellaonline.com/misc/search.a...|`|6Bf3dkViaa	India- curry and rice YUM|`|BWxSSADaaa	I'll give you one here, it is Indian, called Mattar Palao (rice cooked with peas).  I have this one and several others on my blog, I'll provide you the  list: Sour Cherry Rice (Persian), Tuna Salad with Rice and Corn (Russian/Ukrainian), Stuffed Trout (French Inspired), Golubtsy (stuffed cabbage rolls, this variant is Russian/Ukrainian, but the idea is common in all Eastern Europe)     Mattar Palao:    This is a very basic Indian recipe that you can serve on it's own or with curry or dhal.    Mattar Palao    Ingredients:    1.5 cup basmati rice  3 cups water  1/4 t salt  1/2 t cumin seeds  2 whole peppercorns  1 bay leaf  2 whole cloves  optional: 1 cardamom pod  1/2 c frozen peas  1 T oil    Method:    Wash the rice very thoroughly, until the water runs clear when you rinse it. Set it aside. Warm the oil on medium/high heat in a saucepan that you'll use to cook the rice. When it shimmers, fry the cumin seeds, but keep aside the clove, peppercorns, and if you're using it, the cardamom. Fry the cumin for about 30 seconds, you'll be able to smell them cooking, and they may pop. Put the rice, water, salt and bay leaf, and other spices into the pot. Set the heat to high, and let the water come to a boil. Once it boils, set the heat down a little so it's still boiling, but very gently. When almost all of the water has evaporated/absorbed, and small "holes" may appear in the pot of rice, stir in the peas, turn off the stove, and cover the pot for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes has passed, you should open the pot up and stir/fluff the rice with a fork. If the rice is still too wet, turn the heat back on to a low setting, stirring everything till it's not too wet anymore. Probably it'll be just right, though.    Serving Suggestion and Notes: This recipe can easily be expanded/scaled down. For basmati rice, the important ratio is 1 part rice to 2 parts water. You can add more spices to your taste or as needed. For a complete (and inexpensive) meal, I like to scramble some eggs and combine them with the cooked rice, especially the next day. You could also add cashews or some other nut. It's also good garnished with chopped cilantro and/or a squeeze of lemon. Serving this with plain dhal (recipe posted earlier, just leave out eggplant) makes it a bit more complete.    All the other recipes I mentioned (and that one too) can be found here: http://rozminsrecipes.blogspot.com/searc...    That is a link to all the rice recipes on my blog.

Drain water and mix it with 1 clove of minced garlic, sesame oil and a pinch of salt. Put it on the platter.     Put your spinach in a pot of boiling water and stir it for a minute. Then rinse it in cold water a few times and squeeze it lightly. Mix it with a pinch of salt, 1 ts of soy sauce, 1 clove of minced garlic and sesame oil. Put it on the platter     Cut 2 small size zucchinis into thin strips, sprinkle them with a pinch of salt, and then mix them together. A few minutes later, saut them in a pan over high heat. When its cooked, it will look a little translucent. Put it on the platter.     You can buy soaked and cooked kosari at a Korean grocery store. Prepare about 2 or 3 cups of kosari for this 4 servings of bibimbap. Cut it into pieces 5-7 cm long and saut in a heated pan with 1 ts of vegetable oil. Stir and add 1 tbs of soy sauce, 1/2 tbs of sugar, and cook them for 1-2 minutes. Add sesame oil. Put it on the platter.     Slice shitake mushrooms thinly and saut with 1 ts of vegetable oil. Add 2 ts of soy sauce and 1 or 2 ts of sugar and stir it for 2 minutes. Add some sesame oil, and put it on the platter.     On a heated pan, put some oil and 200 grams of ground beef and stir it. Add 4 cloves of minced garlic, 1 tbs of soy sauce, 1/2  tbs of sugar, a little grounded black pepper, and sesame oil. Put it on the platter.     Cut a carrot into strips, saut it for 30 seconds and put it on the platter.     Prepare eggs with sunny side up.     Put your rice In a big bowl, and attractively display all your vegetables and meat t. Place the sunny side up egg on the center.     Serve it with sesame oil and hot pepper paste.

JSryPP8faa	Like the previous answer I too smoke Fuente but the answer to your question is http://www.altadisusa.com/cigar/havatamp...

Many bars have a designated driver incentive program where they can get free fountain soda. It would allow them to have some fun but also help keep everybody safe.    After you are done going to the bars, bring the party back to your house, have a cookout with some brats, burgers, beer, birthday cake, and soda for the young people. Open gifts if there are any.

In school it would be too distracting.|`|Nd8kf0h8aa	it is in my school because on some tests it can help people concentrate and if it gets annoying our teacher makes us spit it out|`|cX6POKeHaa	it helps people to concentrate and it keeps me from getting too hungry.|`|7NJ8lKNEaa	no...it may distract the teacher|`|nOVSf06Raa	It was never allowed and if we chewed gum we were to spit it out ,going back in time when I went to school it was impolite to chew gum due to bubble blowing and popping  noises that it made, it distracted students and teacher and made us look like cows  , the only way that gum should be allowed in schools would be during recess and at no other time during class.|`|Kri70Sy1aa	it is proven infact, that if a student chews the same gum while studying as taking the test, they would possibly remember better and score better on the test|`|qdDVOCbWaa	It helps some people think and concentrate.|`|909476bee458f21159530ec489fd5173aa	Good question,well done,top marks.  Students should be trained for life's problems outside school.  Outside school,gum is allowed.  So allowing gum's problems inside school will prepare students for the real world problems outside school.  Get real, school!  So,using the same argument,alcohol and cigarette smoking should be allowed in some parts of the school grounds,including immediately outside all entry doors,just like it is in all shops outside school.

If you don't know what to make for dinner you need to pick up a vegetarian cookbook like: Becoming Vegetarian: The Complete Guide to Adopting a Healthy Vegetarian Diet - Vesanto Melina & Brenda Davis    Unless  your going to be a vegan you can wear leather.

If you really want to stand up for animal rights and were a true vegetarian you wouldnt wear the leather|`|NNiN0tK0aa	for dinner have a meal made from lentils and vegetables - stew or shepherds pie or bolognaise or chillie or curry ot pie and mash, or make burgers/sausages out of beans.|`|A5gfxSyzaa	My sister did the same thing in high school - she ended up getting sick because she was eating too many carbs and junk food, not enough protein and veggies.  She's much better this time around (We both went veg 3 years ago)    Eating healthy - You should aim for 5 to 8 servings of veggies and fruits every day, in a variety of colors (dark green veggies have calcium and iron, orange has vitamin C and A, etc)  Eat whole grains instead of bleached flour (darker breads instead of white, oatmeal, etc)  Protein is in nuts, bean, soy, seeds, whole grains, eggs, dairy, etc.)  Don't rely on dairy for protein, though - not if you're worried about weight.    Non-obvious foods to be aware of - McDonald's fried (beef fat) Hostess products (beef again) gelatin (marshmallows, jello, skittles, starbursts, some gums, most yogurt, Jr Mints, etc)  Lard (often in real mexican foods) enzymes (in cheese.  Some are fine, some are from baby cow's stomachs and they are killed to get them)    Jello name brand has gelatin and anything that says "kosher" is probably still animal.  There are some "gels" that are made with pectin or agar agar that are safe.    Dinner -Spaghetti without meat, lasagna, stir fry veggies over rice, bean soup, grilled cheese sandwich, Indian food, vegetarian sushi (I love veggie tempura and edamame)    Vegetarian doesn't have to mean no leather, though I don't buy any.  I think it's fine to wear leather you bought before (in fact i feel it's wasteful not to.)|`|Am7J9MVBaa	Calm down !   Lol.     A lot of jello has meat products in it. Be careful!

yRyYgMIGaa	Throw it, it'll be fun. Get more alcohol and good idea on having a max amount of people. But let me tell you this. I've thrown many parties and gone to many (I'm in high school) and every time it happens, more people will show up than you want. It doesn't matter if you tell the people don't tell anyone else because they will, that's just how people are. And second of all, you'll probably get caught. I don't know what it is, but parents have some kind of sixth sense where they can tell when people have been over at their house. But, you're not young forever and you won't see your high school friends forever, so it's best to have as much fun with them as possible while you can.

Place glasses on a tray and place the tray in the fridge for 3 - 4 hours.     It's best to separate the gummi bears/winegums in colours - but not necessary.

oAQib10naa	White meat is healthier, but dark meat is more flavorful.  I would steer clear of boxed nuggets and patties as they are usually processed chicken that is shaped into their shapes, and the breading is usually awful, not to mention full of unneccessary calories.      I'm curious as to where you live/shop that the stores do not have a meat department.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	White meat is leaner and there for healthier. Anything skinless is also healthier. However dark meat tastes better, so if you are more likely to eat dark than white then go with the dark.    If you can compare a box of generic to a box of name brand look for a couple of different things:    Calories  Calories from fat  Trans fat  Sodium    Compare and make your desicion there.|`|XHnpraaxaa	Nuggets are garbage food.

Idk how, but the people in the lab coats say so, so...|`|pXhoYvzkaa	white|`|6QJe4Mlyaa	The dark meat has a bit more fat to it.  The dark meat is a bit moister than white meat.  The "chicken nugget" type chicken has been chopped and formed.  It may be higher in fat because it may have the skin also added to it this would be done for flavor as well as adding bulk.  If you are looking for a frozen chicken nugget type chicken look for pieces that are all white meat.   And preferably solid meat pieces rather than the chopped and formed. That way you know the skin and less expensive dark meat has not been ground up in it as well.    Best way to tell if it is high quality is to look at the ingredient list.  If it is short and does not look like the ingredient list from a science experiment then go for it.|`|tkvXCT56aa	I only eat White meat.. I wont eat dark meat at all... But thats my opinion...|`|xpAhNPrZaa	no nuggets aren't good 4 u i would go white meat|`|APNB4OfIaa	White is lower in fat content & thus drier.  Dark meat is more flavorful.  If its healthy you're looking for, stay away from the nuggets.  They are made from scraps and have a very high fat content.  Not to mention all the chemicals that are added in the processing.|`|Eb3SnljMaa	breaded nuggets for the most part are good for nothing, especially the ones at fast food joints or premade ones with all the crap they put in them.    you are better off just having white meat. grilled chiken breast and if you feel the need for the chicken nugget at least make your own then you do know whats in it.    cut your chicken up into your bite size pieces    dip in flour--milk --  seasoned breading mixture let them set in freezer just for a few so the breading sets then toss in a deep fryer or for even healthier bake them....|`|hJyBSjuXaa	dark meat is actually healthier

AA12031316	Yes, it IS true.  You can go right on the FDA's own website and find the ruling.  They also allow a certain amount of rodent hairs, and insect parts, as well as "human skin cells and hair".  Their take is that it is impossible to produce food in factories without some of these contaminants, so they allow X part per million.  Thats too much for me, and is why I make everything homemade, including growing and grinding my own flour, and milking my own cows!  You would be shocked at what the FDA considers acceptable!  You will likely get many answers saying its NOT true, but I have done the research, and it is.  Most people just simply do not want to believe it.  Keep in mind that the FDA wholeheartedly endorses cigarettes and drugs that cause side effects worse than the illness they are meant to prevent or treat.  They also endorse food colors made from crushed insects (google "carmine", which is the red food color found in most commercial foods, drinks, and medications)

GARLIC & OIL PASTA (AGLIO E OLIO)     Per Person     INGREDIENTS    1 clove of garlic  1 tablespoon of olive oil  125ml of water  ? of a teaspoon of salt  100g of spaghetti  Ground pepper to taste    METHOD    Peel the garlic and chop it into tiny pieces.     Put the oil into a frying pan on a moderate heat. Add the garlic. Fry the garlic for about 5 minutes until it is brown, stirring to stop it sticking.     Put the water and salt into a saucepan and bring to the boil. Put the pasta into the water. Stir it to stop it sticking to the bottom of the pan. Bring back to the boil and continue to cook, stirring to stop it sticking.     Begin testing the pasta about 2 minutes before the packet instructions say it should be done. The best way to judge if pasta is cooked is to bite it. This is tricky, because if you fish out a bit and stick in your mouth you may burn your mouth on the boiling water. Wait a bit and blow on it, then bite it. If it is hard it needs longer. If it is chewy (or al dente, Italian for to the teeth) it is ready. If it is soft it is overcooked.      Drain the pasta in a sieve or colander. Season with the pepper.     Always take the pasta to the sauce. Put the pasta in the pan with the sauce and stir until thoroughly coated.     ADDITIONS & ALTERNATIVES    Use any other long thin plain pasta, like linguine (thin and flat), tagliolini (very thin and flat) or spaghettini (very thin and round), instead of spaghetti.    For Garlic & Parsley Pasta, add 25g per person of fresh parsley. Wash, shake dry and finely chop the parsley. Add the parsley just before serving.     For Garlic & Anchovy Pasta, add 13g (? of a 50g tin) per person of anchovy fillets in olive oil. If you are using the whole tin, use the oil from this to fry the garlic. Add the anchovies to the garlic after the 5 minutes and mash up until smooth.     For Garlic, Anchovy & Olive Pasta, add 2 or 3 pitted black olives and 2 or 3 pitted green olives per person to the Garlic & Anchovy Pasta just before serving.     TIPS    If you use enough water, add the pasta when the water is boiling, stir the pasta and dont wander off (Gli spaghetti amano la compagnia or spaghetti loves company) and dont overcook it, adding olive oil to the water to stop it sticking is totally unnecessary.     PS. I have seen this dish on a restaurant menu for 8.50!|`|Yt8mQK5Iaa	I agree with beans on toast.    ? CupCake ?

The liquid in the blueberries may start a fire. If you weren't planning to re-heat in a toaster I would say add chocolate chips too but that's another thing that may melt in the toaster. You could try macadamia nuts, I had macadamia nuts pancakes in Hawaii and they were great. They had nuts in 'em, on 'em and eating 'em (my spouse and I)! LOL    Nuts should hold up to the toaster ok. Pecans would be good too. You just have to chop the nuts real small so they don't fall out when the pancakes are vertical in the toaster.|`|DEcunDd5aa	If you wanna jazz up your pancakes you could add some fresh fruit into the batter (blueberries work best) or you could mash up some bananas and mix them into the batter.  ** Frozen fruit works JUST as good as fresh ones, so no worries !    My favourite would have to be adding milk chocolate chips (or whatever type you like) to the pancake batter. They're so delicious and after I scope the batter into the pan, I sprinkle some more chocolate chips on top of the cooking pancake :)|`|iNzRRI70aa	I love making pancakes i use basicly the same recipe as you. you should try cutting up fruit like strawberries and mixing them with a little water and adding a little sugar to make a compote its like sweet but not too sweet :) and for the blueberries if you can get fresh then go for it if not frozen is almost as good. also if you just get like some pecans or some nuts you can throw those in there for a crunch and it tastes good too. umm lets see what else....oh rasberries! they are sooooo good on pancakes i wasnt a huge fan then i tried it and they are AMAZZING! and you could even add the classic chocolate cihp! haah so there you go. hope this helps enjoy your breakfast!    LuCKy|`|C8b3KsrGaa	You can put pretty much anything into the pancakes. Fruit, chocolate pieces, nuts, or food coloring. You could also put some flavoring into it such as cinnamon, vanilla, butter rum, pretty much anything. Now if ya wanna make it even more fancy, throw some fresh friut, whipping cream, peanut butter, or flavored syrups on it when ya eat it. The one thing I wouldn't do, is put everything into it at once. Like anything else you cook it has to be meshed together well.|`|gr6e1WZEaa	I like to add some vanilla. I don't think it matters if the strawberrys and the blueberrys are frozen or fresh. I like waffles that are frozen better. They come out of the toaster crispier and can be the right size for the toaster.|`|rwbUF975aa	If you're using fresh blue berries, they tend to soften with heat from pancakes. I'd recommend using frozen although fresh is always good.    You could try using maple syrup or honey which is a good alternative to sugar if you want to keep it sweet.    If you don't mind chocolate, you could try spreading Natella or some other chocolate spread to make things fun.    You could try making some candied coconut:    Heat a small pan. Add 3 tablespoons of mascavado sugar or brown sugar or palm sugar. Allow to melt. Add 1 cup of dessicated coconut to the pan and stir to combine. Remove immediately from heat and serve on top of your pancakes. To store, cool the coconut filling before putting into a tight lidded container. You can store this for upto 3 weeks.|`|a9dc7ce2738e8a19493d26b16c31d973aa	if u dethaw the blue berries in a strainer with water flowing overit they should be fine. i think the recipe is too simpe too. i personaly love chocolate chip pancakes with cinnomon cream sauce the reccipe is easy http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula... but the best blueberry recipe i know is blueberry orange pancakes there very decitant http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/blueb... i hope this helps|`|7jFVTPSlaa	fresh is always better than frozen. the recipe is good, but you can go and buy different flavor surups that will definetly jazz it up(blueberry and rasberry are my favs)|`|Aby5RVTRaa	You can add: chocolate chips, fresh blueberries (unless you want really mushy and dry blueberries, then do frozen, but fresh are by far better), cinnamon, maple syrup (makes them sweet), some peanut butter(creamy p.b. and add into the mix), banana slices, or any fruit... or... pumpkin pie spice!  (really good, even though it's not Thanksgiving)    You can also add some fruit juice (orange, peach, apple, blend, etc.) and just add less milk!  This makes it have a thorough taste of fruit!|`|lONGhDm1aa	WiLL BLeed For Kicks ,          A real good Sour dough pancake with home maid butter , and        maple syrup ..., served with finger sausages , and eggs ...,         Along with coffee , orange juice , or milk ..

Use Bisquick. They don't usually sell it in the pancake isle. You find it in the flour and sugar isle. Put some bisquick mix in a bowl. Add as much milk as you want. (For thickness) Then cook exactly as you normally would.  Eggs taste great but ruin the flavor for some reason. I don't recommend. Then try adding a little bit of cinnamon or rum flavor or coconut flavor. Experimenting is the best part.    Then you can make a home-made syrup. Cut up any fruit you want and/or just throw it into a pan. Put some spring water in it. (I can taste nasty tap water in my food.) Throw in some brown sugar, cinammon, vanilla, butter, and anything else you want. Cook down the fruit until soft and wa la! You just made a delicious, warm  syrup. (You can refrigerate and heat up later.)|`|xxSGhywoaa	1 teaspoon vanilla  1 teaspoon ginger cinnamon nutmeg    In batter: fresh  as a sauce frozen    I like to put jam/preserves on my pancakes instead of syrup as well.|`|AA10130483	After you put the batter on the griddle, add some M&M's...

Fresh are better than frozen if they're in season, otherwise they can be a little bitter, because they're not quite ripe when they ship from far away.   The frozen ones will be yummy, because they're frozen when ripe.|`|nOVSf06Raa	if you have vanilla you could add some of that in the batter, blueberries are good either way, get some Maple Syrup, frozen berries that you will gently cook with a little sugar and use them as a sauce, an apple cut into small pieces is good .|`|dYoWEJ3Raa	try bananas and walnuts  or  Chocolate chips  thoese are my fav ;)|`|1YcKHGLqaa	Try making chocolate chip pancakes or spreading a little melted chocolate one them when the hit the plate. Yum!    Cherry pie filling is really good on top, too.    Add vanilla to the batter; it really makes them pop. You can also add cinnamon and nutmeg.    My personal favorite for pancakes is getting some walnuts and bananas and putting them in the batter with cinnamon and vanilla and serving them with syrup. Also, try doing plain or fruit pancakes but using honey instead of syrup. Yum! :)|`|TZCVc9vyaa	mmm squish up some bananas in there yummmy...banana chocolate chip ones are so yummy tooooo!!|`|AA11263103	frozen that were fresh blueberries   or   bananas with chopped nuts or strawberries|`|4WPJrK9Jaa	add some blueberries|`|aiBzKyjlaa	put skor pieces in it and chocolate chips, skor pancakes, soooo good. :)|`|LPilzLnZaa	chocolate chips!!!!|`|MjUentmjaa	strawberrys|`|KIzrFkYAaa	Do the same recipe, but add blueberries and strawberries to the batter while it cooks.

MbSSIOpSaa	Before I stopped eating meat and dairy, I thought everyone was exaggerating the benefits.     It may be because I went "cold turkey" to a vegan diet from an omnivorous one but I felt amazing changes in my body within 2 weeks. I lost weight, had more energy, felt lighter and happier, had glowing skin and my blackheads disappeared. Best of all my asthma (previously on 4 medications and used inhaler 8 times a day) completely went away. I think that's because I stopped eating dairy. It is amazing!|`|cpoEP9Mcaa	It's called the Placebo effect.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	Cooking or heating meat produces very harmful substances which do a lot of damage to your body.  When you stop eating meat you stop your intake of these substances.  Heating meat also turns the saturated fat and cholesterol into forms that clog up your arteries and lead to heart disease.  The protein is denatured so its harder for your body to digest so chunks of meat get stuck in your colon and rot and ferment, feeding bad bacteria and worms and other parasites.  Carnivores have short colons so that meat travels through the body quickly for this reason.  Humans have long colons....  Raw meat doesnt cause these problems.  However concentrated protein is taxing on your kidneys and liver.    By not eating meat you have given your kidneys and liver a break, given your colon a chance to clean itself out, given the whole body a break from harmful toxins....  You have also dramatically increased your intake of antioxidants from fruit, veg, wholegrains and legumes.  You have also been eating more fibre which helps flush the rotting meat out of your colon.  Finally the hygiene standards of meat production today are not the best.  Health inspectors have found cigerette ends, faeces, fingernails, and other nasties in meat on sale in butchers shops - seriously.  Most meat when tested is found to contain bacteria that can only have come from faeces.  So consuming this meat puts a toll on your immune system.  By not eating meat you have give your immune system a break and probably increased your intake of vitamin C (citrus fruit, greens, tomatoes, most fruit and veg) which boosts your immunity.  When I ate meat I succumbed to chest or throat infections at least 4 times a year.  The moment I stopped eating meat, the infections stopped completely, even though I was eating quite a junky vegetarian diet full of processed food.    So a lot of benefits!|`|b9uOax0aaa	Yes it is your imagination that you feel better.|`|Am7J9MVBaa	I noticed incredible differences when I went vegetarian!!  I had a bunch more energy, and my skin was more shiny... no idea why :P|`|jR0GYS0waa	I think stop eating meat is a good idea.But try to replace it  with some other diet that contains essentials which are in meat.|`|LVDd4Q1Jaa	i think if you're eating healthier than before than you truly feel better  and i think giving up meat is amazing for you|`|ab2f66e8a13e1ac5cc285faefb061f12aa	As long as you are getting all the right nutrition from non-meat sources of course you feel better. Veggies, fruits and legumes are easier to digest and will actually boost your energy overtime. While meat may be tasty the western diet tends to not eat it in moderation so by eating a better vegetarian diet you feel better and more energetic.

vMXk9ohSaa	Ignore that other poster.  She obviously has no clue.  My daughter is Pres of her Japanese Culture and Anime club at school.  The very first party she threw on Halloween about 3 years ago had 40 people show up in costume.  They had a blast.  I suggested they make sushi out of candy.  We went all over finding the perfect candy - from fruit roll-ups to gummy worms, etc.  No one made sushi but they all ate the candy ingredients.  Don't waste your time trying crafts.  This year at the party they played "Whose Line is it, Anime?"  If you know the Drew Carey show Who's line is it anyway?  then you'll know how to play.

Add 1/2 t. vinegar and 1/2 t. salt to the juice. The salt acts like a preservative, and the vinegar helps keep the color. If it is too thick, you can add a little water. Store it in a small glass jar with a tight lid. (Blackberry ink is a drag if it spills!) Make small amounts at a time and keep tightly covered in the refrigerator when not using.

And the only way i could get it tender the way that i like to eat it was to bake it first. Season it, then place it in a pan then cover it.  Set the oven for 350 degree and bake it for about an hour or two.  Depending on how thick it is.  Once you stick it with a fork and it's tender then take it out from  the oven and cook it on top of the stove.  That gives it a nice browning to it and it's tender too.  I think if you try that you'll find that you may like prepared that way.

Unless you want to eat the skin to it, which would be very painful cause they can sometimes be very pointy. All you have to do to one cut a pineapple up is. Cut off the top and bottom. slice the tough skin off the sides, then cut from top to bottom in four, through the middle. Then take the inner hard part and slice that off from top to bottom. and cut into the size chucks you prefer|`|UjG8FqLUaa	Y0U BITE IT?|`|Eb3SnljMaa	hmm well not sure what you cand cut yourself in the process is supposed to mean...    but you can just use knife CAREFULLY so not to cut yourself, and just peel part of the pineapple and take bites if for whatever reason you don't want to cut it up. its hard to it through the skin and i don't really recommend it.
rUMlDAINaa	Personally, I love the taste of red velvet cake - but you should definitely have a tasting at the bakery when you make your choice.  Chose what you like - not what's fashionable.  I've had both and I've seen both at weddings, and personally, I think the red velvet comes through like a champ.  But, you know, you may have guests that are picky and don't like the color.      Of course, if you get an armadillo cake with red velvet on the inside, be prepared for some interesting comments. And watch Steel Magnolias, if you haven't seen it already - see sources.|`|o68zqSZkaa	Red velvet is an amazing cake. Personally I would go with the red velvet for many reasons.    1. looks beautiful when cut  2. tastes great  3. different    Marble cake is kinda hokey for a wedding personally.

These both seem like something you would get at a corporate banquet, not a wedding.|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	All that Red Velvet cake is a chocolate cake with red dye and a cream cheese frosting( not really what I call "wedding material".  Here's a typical recipe  ( note the cocoa powder and red dye( yuck).  http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeri...    A classic wedding cake would be something like canoli cream and chocolate mousse with yellow cake inside and white butter cream outside.  Or, chocolate mousse and raspberry filling inside with the white cream outside.  A lot of variations, but I wouldn't do Red Velvet.|`|b0iUaUJXaa	There's nothing wrong with either one.What do YOU want? Where are you getting the wedding cake from?Many bakeries or bakers will have tastings of wedding cakes.If you have a question about red velvet cake,is there a bakery close to you that makes red velvet cake or cupcakes? Get a cupcake so you won't have a whole cake just in case.You could have one tier in red velvet,and one tier in marble.Most bakers are very accommodating,especially for wedding cakes.I think both are a good choice.Good Luck and Congratulations!!!|`|AA11091315	Red Velvet cake is so freakin' delicious.

FicyC2TXaa	Vegans avoid those wines and beers which have been produced using fining or filtering agents which are not vegan. Those commonly used are:    Gelatine - from bones and connective tissues of cows or pigs  Isinglass - from fish swim bladders   Chitin - from shells of crabs or lobsters  Casein - from milk  Albumin - from egg whites  Ox Blood     There are vegan alternatives; this site lists thousands of beers, wines, spirits, liqueurs and mixers and tells you if they are vegetarian, vegan or neither:    http://www.veggiewines.co.uk/index.htm|`|ffJcrsmLaa	Pretty much all hard liquor is vegan, and most beer is. Wines are usually fined with animal products like gelatin or albumin (the animal products do not remain in the wine), so some vegans only drink wine that isn't fined that way. Although if you're going to not drink wine because of the fining process, you should also research how bone char is used to refine some sugar.|`|AA12334360	There are vegan versions of most alchoholic drinks. a quick internet search will reveal many mail order shops that can help you.    You have to go with versions that specifically state they are vegan because alchohol above 2% is excempt from food ingredients labelling legislation.|`|A5gfxSyzaa	Here's a handy list:  http://www.barnivore.com/liquor|`|bPZlpe0taa	Any i guess providing you look at the ingredients to make sure theres no dairy,gelatin or anything like that|`|0ujpiBTCaa	The vegan kind :)  If it doesn't say vegan on it, you should contact the company or check out websites hat have done that for you.    Dairy is obvious, but many many alcoholic beverages are processed with egg or fish products. You will not find this on the label! That is why you need to do some research.|`|AA12031316	Many liquors, and especially wine, are "fined" by clarifiying the ingredients through egg shells, so they would not be vegan. Many are also distilled with white sugar, which is filtered through "char" (ground animal bones), so they would not be vegan either.  Research is the only way to know which would be vegan.  I know vegan wines are available at most whole foods stores.  Potato based vodka is also vegan, as a rule.

rsTB7D1zaa	The whiskey drunk and tequila drunk are the same.  And both are the same as the beer drunk, and the wine drunk.      All alcoholic beverages contain ethanol, the compound which causes you to be drunk.  So, because of this common culprit, they all produce the same effect.    The only difference between them is how strong it is.  You simply need to drink less of a stronger drink to get drunk.  60 ounces of beer may be replaced by, say, 12 ounces of whiskey or 5 ounces of grain alcohol.  If you drank all of these in the same time interval, it would take you just as long to get drunk.    BTW, tequila and whiskey are usually both 40% so they are equally strong.  Some whiskey is stronger, up to 62.5% or so, but these will be much more expensive.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Their all about the same depending on their alchohol content.|`|ff773b4421ffa9e7eafcc4dac827ff9daa	All I know is drinking straight up is better than mixing. A lot less hangover!|`|vJP6yTy3aa	there are different percentages of alcohol in them.  a wine cooler will affect you less than a shot of vodka.|`|L2bQifUXaa	I think they are different, I definitely get a different feeling from tequila than I do from beer.. even if in the end I end up drinking the same amount of alcohol.|`|JcjGlCBWaa	Not really and yes because some have more alcohol and some have less. The ones with more alcohol gives more of a headache the next day and the ones with the less alcohol will barely give.|`|bwx3epFdaa	It depends on the alcohol content. Read the percentage of alcohol, or the proof (which is twice the alcohol percentage). After that it depends on the volume of alcohol and the rate of consumption. Meaning you will get drunk faster if you drink a lot of alcohol very fast.|`|vpjyhqgCaa	No, it all depends on the amount of alcohol each drink has. Tequila and whiskey wouldn't be tequila and whiskey without the alcohol. It all depends on the amount of alcohol|`|VXcp8hvHaa	depends on the proof
TPVvddHWaa	tapas is the Spanish speciality    Little portions of anything can be called tapas.    Get a long thin baguette and slice into half inch slices bake the slices until they are dry,     put some cream cheese and an olive on some.  Egg mayonnaise on some with a tiny sliver of tomato  Mashed sardines or caviar on others  You can also put cerano ham or cheese slices on a few.    Gazpacho, is chopped fresh salad vegetables served in chilled seasoned tomato juice. Served as a cold soup.    Paella is a risotto made with a whole chicken cut into eight pieces and shell fish. The shell fish are kept whole and are eaten with the fingers they use clams shrimp and mussels, winkles and whelks. Any mix will do though.    Tortilla an omelet with cooked potatoes in it, you beat the eggs and add the chunks of potato then pour into the pan when it starts to cook put it under a grill to finish the top then cut into wedges to serve.    Meatballs with fried potato.    Peppers stuffed with vegetable rice    Potato salad mix salad onions salt pepper and mayonnaise with hot potatoes and allow to cool then chill.    Calamari, rings of squid battered and deep fried with a wedge of lemon    Sauces are not unlike the Italian ones made with tomatoes and chopped peppers,     Tarte, is exactly like a creme caramel but the custard is heavier.    Chorros are long thin fried do'nut type cakes served with a hot chocolate sauce they are dipped in and eaten.    Cerano ham is the same as Parma or Black Forest ham, if you can not find it locally but they do eat york ham too.
Rk6LFf1Kaa	Ingredients:  1 box of chocolate cake mix & necessary ingredients instructed on box   6 Habaneros (3 for cooking 3 for show)  Enough frosting for your cake (This will depend on how many layers and how much frosting you like on your cakes)    mix a box of chocolate cake mix just as the instructions show BUT... do this first:  Measure out how much milk is needed in the batter, pour that into your food processor (or blender) and add 3 Habaneros (I would recommend you remove the seeds unless you want to be sweating bullets from these miniature hot and spicy grenades!)    Blend the milk/pepper mace...um...I-mean flavoring until the pepper bits are about the size of sand from 60 grit sand paper. (this is not an exact science after all you just want to mesh all of the flavor into the milk)    For those of you chemists (or molecular gastronomists) out there you may recognize that the milk will counteract the heat from the peppers.     So, you have this milk/pepper mixture, use all of that (since it was measured before it was blended) in the chocolate cake mix. If you feel so daring you can incorporate this into your own cake recipe but an "Out of the Box" cake mix is a little easier and that is how I had originally made the cake. .       HABANERO "SAUCED" CHOCOLATE BROWNIE COFFEE CAKE WITH CRUSHED CHILE PEPPERS    (Delivers a powerful punch without the nasty bite)  2 eggs  1/2 cup sugar  1/2 cup packed brown sugar  1/2 cup flour  2 T cocoa powder  6 hot red chile pods pureed (see recipe below)  1 tsp. (or more if you dare) HOT HABENERO SAUCE  1/2 cup margarine spread  1/2 cup chopped walnuts or Mesilla Valley pecans  1/4 cup melted chocolate chips (I put chips in a microwaveable cup with a T  of water and microwave just until the chips begin to melt. Stir.)  1/4 cup chocolate chips  1 T vanilla  Cool Whip, aerosol whipped cream, or real whip cream    Chile puree: remove stem, seeds and veins from 6 New Mexican hot dried red chiles. Cut in pieces (I use kitchen scissors). Soak in boiling water 20 minutes. Blend in blender with a small amount of the "soaking" water, enough to create a paste-like texture. Note: It's okay if small chile bits remain.  Cream eggs and sugars. Add flour, cocoa powder, and chile paste. Stir well. Add margarine, melted chocolate chips and then whip. Add nuts, chocolate chips and vanilla. Stir. Pour into a greased 9" x 9" glass pan and bake in a SLOW oven at 325 degrees for 35 minutes or until center top springs back when touched lightly with finger.

Chop some garlic in the meantime.  Once the pan has been in the broiler x 10 minutes, throw the meat/fish on and it will automatically seal on the bottom and cook REALLLY QUICK on both sides... within a few minutes.  Keep an eye on it cuz it will cook FAST!   Once cooked through, top with olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, pepper.  quick, easy, tasty and simple!    For vegitarian:   Black bean and salsa tacos- REAL quick; no cooking and virtually no clean up... toss black beans, salsa, cumin, garlic in a bowl and stir, voila!  Top with avocado if you have some :)|`|c159efe1b44ee4b1b369d779c1d19521aa	Chicken Alfredo!|`|EItWuP4Xaa	Make scrambled eggs!
TJOHxhEUaa	In a cooked dish, most people can't tell the difference between a yellow and a white onion, so use whichever you prefer.  But when red onions are called for, the recipe will specify them.    Keep cooking!|`|vvoz2jeyaa	i a recipe when it says onion yellow is what is meant but you can also use white or red if that's all you have. just slightly different flavors.|`|0HfhltzZaa	Onions called for in recipes generally mean white or yellow. They can be used interchangeably unless a recipe specifies the type. The only difference is that yellow onion cooks a bit darker due to a slightly higher sugar content. One large onion will have the capacity to fill a one cup measure if chopped. =]|`|MBTtIsF0aa	it can be either, it is up to your tastes. I am allergic to onions, my husband loves them lol  I use mostly white onions, they seem to cause the less heartburn in my family for some odd reason.|`|AA10654703	I buy the 3 pound bag of spanish onions.

Kaudz4Msaa	Eeew, asti spumante is tooo sweet and too grapey, it would cover up the taste of chocolate.  If you are going for that, why not just go for champagne????  Moet Star is a reasonably priced one.    I am not a big fan of beer with dessert, either.    If you are going for something heavier, why not the classic....brandy or cognac???  Remy Martin Red I think is the more reasonably priced one but I am not sure about that.  All are fine, cognacs are well controlled.  If it has the title "cognac," you can rest assured that it comes from the Cognac region of France, and its quality controlled.    Oakiness is the charm of cognac.  However, if you find cognac a bit too oakey (I usually do...) ....then go for brandy or a fine bourbon, instead.    A delicious and reasonably priced brandy is a German one called Asbach Uralt.  If you go to Switzerland, you will find Lindt chocolates filled with cognac.  If you go to Germany, you will find chocolates filled with Asbach brandy.    My favorite bourbon is called Blanton's, but there are many good ones, like Maker's Mark.    Try some of these taste combinations yourself!!|`|bQpIctgPaa	A port which I like is called Hardy's Whiskers Blake.  It's very highly rated and is about $15 a bottle.|`|KozcqT9Paa	A good Cabernet is an excellent compliment to chocolate. It will also fit in well in a basket of richer items.

Asti Spumante goes well with anything sweet. I don't know where you live so I can't recommend a brand that I know you'd be able to get. Asti is the region the wine is made and Spumante is the style of wine (sweet Italian sparkling wine).    Contrary to (apparently) popular belief, port is NOT a dessert wine, it is fortified and usually used as an apeitif or served as a nightcap.|`|o68zqSZkaa	Asti spumante all the way    you may also want to consider Vin Santo.|`|19XMgD2Xaa	Actually theirs beers that go better with chocolate believe it or not.  Dessert wine coat the pallet making the taste of chocolate dampen.  May dark ales are a fine fine choice for chocolate.  I suggest English stouts.

I40vnqNyaa	You are vomiting like that because you are drinking far in excess of what your body can handle.  Your body is trying to expel all the alcohol and your liver is trying to tell you to stop!.   Seriously, if your vomiting this much after drinking you had better stop before you end up with a fatty liver that fails you.  To vomit this much isn't normal, even after a boozy binge night.  Lay off the alcohol for a while and eat plenty of liver cleansing foods.   Kiwi fruit is good for cleansing your liver.  You can find a list of foods that will help your body recover at http://www.whf.com  The one thing you can be grateful for is the fact that the liver is the only organ in the body that is capable of regenerating itself, so if this binge drinking hasn't been going on too long, you should be fine.   You only get one body, you should try to be kinder to it.  In the long run your body will thank you will continuing good health.  Good luck :)|`|hLohtlPEaa	Excessive vomiting is harmful. I would drink ginger ale instead.|`|dxmEGvDiaa	It sounds as if your liver may be failing you. Refrain from drinking..|`|CGnL2nS0aa	Cool. Must be fun getting drunk!

Keep it up, and maybe you'll figure it out someday.|`|AA11865682	It's called dehydration. When they tell you to drink a litre of water for every hour you're drinking it's not because people like the sound of their own voice. If you're drinking that much that you vomit, maybe you should slow down. Try having a glass of water between each alcoholic drink you have. The vomiting shouldn't occur if you follow that rule.|`|8pw8qDjPaa	umm... you drink too much or something too hard? i'd say STOP DRIKNING!! you're liver is pissed at you!|`|k6p4Oc7Uaa	could be a lot of things.. i never throw up the morning after drinking. i do often feel like my guts are rotting from the inside out lol. it might be some thing you drank that doesn't agree with you, beer be for liquor, you've never been sicker, the lining of you stomach may be giving out, liver failure. you should prob go see a doctor.|`|W1MgefrWaa	Because u r 14 and way too young to drink.|`|OY3ayV6eaa	cause thats what happenss !! =]|`|ZeV8jZyiaa	DONT@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|w1VVWLLHaa	The Acid in your stomach doesnt like it...|`|BCl9AbWXaa	sign of DO NOT DRINK anymore.    sounds like you did your liver a good amount of damage...perhaps...    depends too on how much you are drinking and if you ate...|`|44707e7b798fd01392ccb15cec3384afaa	eat before you pass out
DFXS4SB4aa	All about the quality grades on meat. And actually, only poultry is letter graded. Beef has grades of prime, choice, select, etc. And pork isn't graded at all.     http://ag.ansc.purdue.edu/meat_quality/e...|`|cpoEP9Mcaa	If you don't watch a tomato, you can ingest harmful **** too.     When you cook meat, it kills any harmful bacteria.|`|nDOWKhwCaa	The only thing they know is the propaganda that they have been fed. So, they know nothing.|`|vz2F8X5Vaa	Grading systems are based on the quality of the meat.  It wont harm you to eat meat of a lesser grade. To use beef as an example,  It simply means it may have come from an older animal, or may just not have an ideal amount of fat marbling throughout.  An older leaner animal will be graded substantially lower than a young animal with more fat.    Hope this helps you!|`|VdbhuUYBaa	Grades revolve around quality, not health.|`|p9rIPd4Maa	In my eyes, all meat is unhealthy, regardless of the quality. (1)- "Animal protein is correlated with higher incidences of cancer and cardiovascular disease in humans. Why is it that animal protein raises cholesterol levels and produces diseases like arteriosclerosis? The latest research suggests that foreign proteins absorbed into the blood, such as undigested animal proteins, cause inflammation in the endothelium of the blood vessels, which eventually leads to hardening and narrowing of the arteries."     Looking at it form your point of view, no, the lower quality meats don't damage your health more than higher quality meats. It's like, does a home brand 500mg Paracetamol tablet work like an expensive brand 500mg Paracetamol tablet? - Of course it does, paracetamol is paracetamol, regardless of which package it's in!

Elxuvon8aa	some chicken is done and still has that pink red look  they are not bled out right when processed  one hour at 350 should have done it if it was not frozen|`|c5b91af8f2f5d06ad48ebd329c25945faa	If  you  don't  have  an  "instant  read"  thermometer,  then  you  need  to  get  one  and  learn   how  to  use  it.  Insert  it  into  the  thickest  part  of  the  meat,  away  from  the  bone,  push  in  about  3-inches  and  wait  for  the  temperature  to  register.  Then  remove  the  probe/thermometer.  The  breast  area  should  read  170 F  and  the  dark  meat  should  read  about  180 F  or  less.  A  thermometer  will  cost  between  $6.00  to  $30.00  depending  on  where   you  purchase  it.    "As a general rule, calculate a cooking time of 20 minutes per pound of meat plus an additional 10 - 20 minutes at a temperature of 350oF. Therefore, a 5 lb chicken will need to  roast in the oven for at least  50 mins.  to  an  hour.

Depending on the size of the chicken the cooking time might be more than an hour. Closer to an hour and a half if it's over 5 lbs.  You might want to check your oven temp to see if it's accurate. If it's too cool - like 300 or 325 the chicken will take longer and you think it's cooking fine but it is really too cool.|`|VhrUtQc2aa	i think it takes 1/2 or 45 minutes from both sides and check if its still uncooked then just leave it another 20/25 min hope i could help|`|ClK9W8THaa	If you have it covered, you may want to take the covering off, use a spoon to scoop the juices over the chicken. make sure you do this all over and let it cook uncovered for about another  hour and a half .  It should be cooked then and browned nicely.

pfm0wcEIaa	How many calories you burn depends much on you size, gender, muscle mass and your individual metabolism.  You should look up the dietary information of what you are eating to get a better idea.  Also, remember that with the exercise you are doing you may gain muscle and even go up in weight and down in size.    It is a good idea to write down how much you are eating and exercising.  That way, if you don't lose weight you will have a better idea of how to adjust your diet when you try again.    On a side note, since your are eating sushi every day, you should take note that large fish such as tuna and even salmon often carry high concentrations of heavy metals and other contaminants.  I would suggest possibly changing to smaller fish in your sushi as they tend to have lower amounts of contaminants.|`|3WItFAwlaa	I really wish that was a good diet because I could eat raw salmon every day.  Unfortunately, it is high in fat.  It is the good fat (omega 3) but too much is not good.      You should try to cut down to once a week.  Also, ask the waitress if they can stir fry some veggies for you without oil as a side dish.|`|Y7DxySgYaa	Actually eating Sushi is good for you. Eating 6 orders of it might make you gain some weight, and brown rice is not to good for you. Try eating cucumber rolls and White rice.|`|R8bXuLbTaa	Sushi is very healthy but Salmon is a fatty fish.    Try ordering 2 salmon rolls instead of the sashimi. Atleast youll get the benefits from the seaweed this way.    Then, order a veggie roll or get some edamame if you are still hungry
lbR1IoiSaa	Your body is trying to tell you that it's missing something.     It's extremely difficult for your body to adjust to a drastic change in dietary and nutritional intake overnight, so you probably need some form of meat or other perhaps protein that you've not eaten enough of since turning vegetarian.     Any drastic change in dietary habits should be done over a period of time, to let your body adjust, otherwise you risk serious health issues!     You need to splurge on a good protein meal for tonight, then maybe do your veggie thing tomorrow, then the next day another real meal, then start spacing it out a bit more.      Our bodies are not just machines we can switch from meat-eater cycle to vegetarian cycle.  Our bodies learn to function based upon what we're eating over the long-term, and right now your machine (your body), has an 'unbalanced load' on board, so it's freaking out trying to figure out how to compensate.     Hope this helps, and I hope you feel better soon!|`|9ilXVowLaa	your body just needs to adjust,i think.  you have to detox,cleanse your system.|`|eFXD3Qzcaa	You need some protein!!!

Broil just until the cheese melts.     19. Trim fat from a beef roast; cut beef into 1-1/4" pieces. Brown, stir in salsa, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, a tablespoon soy sauce, a clove of crushed garlic, - Bring to a boil, cover tightly and simmer for an hour. Remove cover and cook until beef is tender. Remove from heat, stir in chopped cilantro and a splash of lime juice. Spoon over rice.    21. Serve with pork chops and rice, with salsa drizzled over all.     22. Serve over tuna fish patties or salmon patties.     23. Add to cooked pasta - without anything else.     24. Add to soups to spice up a "just soup" meal.     25.Mexican pasta (use dry pasta of your choice)- Salsa cooked down and "re-sparked" with fresh cilantro and green onion. Add some protein like shrimp, chorizo, or ground beef or pork. This will use up alot of salsa. Once you cook it, the sauce can be frozen or kept in the fridge for a bit. Just to be clear, if using meat, the process would be saute the meat, add the salsa, cook down to desired consistency and taste, then toss with cooked pasta. Garnish with fresh cilantro and green onion.    Enjoy! :)|`|LLk11Ljqaa	baked potato  omelet  quesadilla|`|IFd94XDkaa	We can go thru a bottle in pretty short order by pouring it over a block of cream cheese and diping into it with chips.  We like to scoop a lot of salsa onto our chips tho.  I do have two recipes that I use salsa as an ingredient.      Cheesy Rice Quesadillas   1 pkg corn tortillas   1 pkg Rice a Roni Spanish Rice   1 can corn, drained   1 can black beans, rinsed and drained  1 cp chunky salsa   Cheddar cheese  Sour Cream   Salsa     Prepare the Rice a Roni per instructions on the box in a skillet.  Make sure the beans are well rinsed with water and drained well.  Add them to the rice along with the corn and salsa, cover and simmer just till it's all heated thru.     Heat a lrg skillet over med/high-heat. Lower heat to med. Spray with cooking spray, lay a tortilla in the pan and cover with the rice mixture to about 1/2" thickness. Sprinkle with cheese, lay another tortilla over top and cook till the top tortilla begins to curl at the edges. Flip it carefully with a pancake turner. Cook that side 1-2 min. Flip onto a plate and cut into quarters with a pizza cutter. Top with sour cream and salsa, serve.       Salsa Beef Skillet  1 pkg Kraft Deluxe Macaroni n Cheese or Velveeta Shells n Cheese  1 lb hamburger  1/2 cp salsa    1 can corn, drained  1 can black beans, rinsed and drained  1 pkg Taco seasoning  ? cp water  ? cp shredded cheddar cheese    Brown meat in skillet, drain.  Return to skillet.  Add salsa, corn, beans, water, and taco seasoning,  simmer until heated through.      Prepare Mac n cheese per pkg directions.  Add it to the skillet, stir.      Top with cheese.  Good served with corn bread.  The corn bread batter could even be put on top and bake the whole thing as a casserole.|`|EJCuRa19aa	My favourite is too season chicken breasts, put in dish and put about 1/2 cup salsa on them.

When I was a youngen I drank like 3 shots one right after the other and I got so sick.    So learn from my mistakes.    Remember it takes a while for you to feel the affects to really start with one drink and dont drink on an empty stomach.    Also if you pass out at a party, guys will mess with you.    Depending on what type of guys you are around will determain what they do to you, so be careful about that.      Never drink alone.  Thats all I got for now.|`|4nhkC9qYaa	trying to control yourself sucks.....

Death, arrested, badly pranked (While I have not gotten drunk as of yet, plan to soon though, I've been around enough drunken people to know that the ones who fall asleep can have some really mean stuff done to them.)

You don't really ask for advice on how to control yourself because this is different with every person. Your body will tell you when its time to stop, for some people 2 beers or so will do it and other people have a higher tolerance for alcohol. You just have to learn to not ignore when your body is telling you had enough!

But sadly they won't. Parents need to realize how unhealthy our children are and take more steps to teach them better eating habits. My kids do eat junk food, but they also eat vegetables and fruit. Not every snack has to be bad for you, you can do apples and caramel, nuts ect. there are a lot of healthy snacks to be found, they just need to take the time to teach the kids the differences.|`|NMwW1qUkaa	Yes junk food should be banned from schools.

It is a basic human right to put whatever we want into our own bodies. Some people need to stop thinking that they know what's best for everyone else.|`|RMppfinbaa	my school banned junk food all together. A cool lunch consists of multi-grain pizza and a Cesar salad. Half the students through out the salad or they skip lunch entirely. This causes them to be unfocused and disruptive in the classroom. Many have walked to a local pizza joint, Tim Horton's, McDonald's or corner store. They, for the most part, return with worse candy then offered on school grounds. They also arrive late for class. So, I say there should be a cut back on junk food, but taking it away completely isn't good either. Kids will find a way to get their sugar one way or the other. Keeping it in a confined area will reduce all the negative aspects I've listed before.     Hope you make the right choice.|`|zAhwN8ueaa	i think junk food should be banned.  i think one day a month or every two weeks there should be "poutine day" or "fries days" etc.  its not that hard to sell good tasting healthy foods.  ex. wraps, sandwiches.|`|R8bXuLbTaa	Next time you are faced with the decision to nourish your body or neglect your health remember to think of what lies ahead. A healthier day today paves the path for a healthier tomorrow.     i think thats a good call to action.    the food you eat is always your own individual choice and those temptations to indulge into junk will always be there. I think taking them out of the school is a good idea because its less distraction for those who ARE trying to live a healtheir life.    I always have kept my weight low only because I have GREAT will power. I hated going to school ONLY because all the off-limit foods were there begging me to eat them. Luckily I was able to resist but not all escape the trap!
829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	Some parts of Canada require two ID's.  You can get a City/State pic ID( same as a license but you can't drive with it).  Those 2 will get you in.|`|BCl9AbWXaa	if you can just get a state id card will work...something with a picture so the bouncer at the door can tell its really you. since anyone can show a birth certificate or piece of paper with a name and age on it.  health card would have to have name, age, picture and birthdate on it. it may work...|`|TRawoUCcaa	Where I live in Ontario, Ottawa (I'm not sure if it's the same law there), you're not legally allowed to use a health card as ID. But a lot of places will warn you about that the first time you try, let you use it that time but tell you to bring legal ID in the future.    So the alternative to a drivers licence is a pasport.
I40vnqNyaa	Oatmeal is very good for you as it offers plenty of nutrition and is also low GI which is good for slow release energy.  Cant say anything bad about oatmeal.    White bread isn't very good for you at all.  It has been made with white flour which has basically had all its original nutrients stripped from it during processing and had fake vitamins added back in at the end.  The best choice is to go for something wholegrain as this has far better nutritional value and contains much more fibre and good fats (in the seeds) that are necessary for a healthy brain.  If you dont like the seeds and grains in the bread at least go for wholemeal.    Peanut butter has a high fat content and often high in salt as well, the more commercial brands are the ones most guilty of this.  However, it does offer some nutritional value as nuts are very good for you.  Try a handful of almonds as they are a quick snack and very good for you.     Orange juice is ok.  It really just depends on the brand.  Dont go for the ones that sit on the shelf as they are full of preservatives and have a very low juice content.  They really are just like cordial.  If you dont have time to squeeze your own, go for one that has the highest juice percentage and one that is kept in the refrigerated section of your supermarket.    Dont overlook eggs as a quick healthy breakfast.  They are a powerhouse of vitamins and nutrients and there are so many ways to prepare them.  Eggs can be boiled or fried, but can also be scrambled in the microwave, just toss some tomato, cheese, mushrooms, parsley, finely sliced onion etc (whatever you like really) in with your eggs, stir and microwave for 1 min, stir, micro for 30 seconds, stir and depending on how you like your eggs and how much you put in the bowl another 30 seconds (quick, easy, healthy and one bowl to wash up).  What about french toast?  Whisk some eggs in a bowl and soak your bread for a min or two before lightly pan frying.    One of my favourite websites is http://www.whf.com  Here you will find a list of the worlds healthiest foods, the nutrient value of each food and how to use them.  I like the list that tells you what each individual food does for your body.  Has videos and recipes for inspiration as well.  Check it out, its very interesting.    You are doing the right thing by starting your day off with a healthy breakfast.  Its the most important meal of the day.  Well done :)|`|WZCEvWKIaa	It's not a terrible breakfast by any means, but I wouldn't call it ideally well balanced. If you're eating white toast, you're taking in some simple carbohydrates for which your body doesn't have much use; you either burn that energy quickly and inefficiently, or it gets stored basically as fat. Oatmeal is a good complex carbohydrate, so you don't need another one in the same meal. I'd replace the white toast with whole wheat (100% whole wheat, not multigrain), and instead of oatmeal, add another serving of fruits or vegetables (a banana, some strawberries, apple slices).     Variety is good for your health and your tastebuds, too, so going the wheat toast and peanut butter route some days, and oatmeal with fruit and perhaps a boiled egg on other days would give you an even better balance. Eggs are good a few days a week because they provide B vitamins and are a great source of protein, but don't overdo it; they are high in cholesterol. Peanut butter is a high-fat source of protein, so again- good in moderation, perhaps not something to eat every day.    Of course, your caloric and other dietary needs will vary based on your level of activity (do you play sports? do you walk to school? are you on your feet a lot), your size, and other factors.    I hope this helps...|`|MBTtIsF0aa	yes it is a good breakfast. Also, eggs are good for breakfast and  are very filling, helps you not be hungry too early.|`|a0u5xIzKaa	WELL I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE CHANGE AS IN LIKE CEREAL ONCE IN A WHILE AND THEN JUST KEEP ON YOUR OLD ROUTINE AND JUST KEEP ON GOING!!!

I.E. Leftovers from the night before. But aside from that it sounds like a balanced breakfast you have your grains, proteins/meats and fruit. If you can get a vegetable in there it would be perfect.     by the way it sounds like it would taste excellent.

This will be your bouquet garni.      * For the veal shanks, pat dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. Veal shanks will brown better when they are dry. Secure the meat to the bone with the kitchen twine. Season each shank with salt and freshly ground pepper. Dredge the shanks in flour, shaking off excess.      * In a large Dutch oven pot, heat vegetable oil until smoking. Add tied veal shanks to the hot pan and brown all sides, about 3 minutes per side. Remove browned shanks and reserve.      * In the same pot, add the onion, carrot and celery. Season with salt at this point to help draw out the moisture from the vegetables. Saute until soft and translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the tomato paste and mix well. Return browned shanks to the pan and add the white wine and reduce liquid by half, about 5 minutes. Add the bouquet garni and 2 cups of the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover pan and simmer for about 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is falling off the bone. Check every 15 minutes, turning shanks and adding more chicken stock as necessary. The level of cooking liquid should always be about 3/4 the way up the shank.      * Carefully remove the cooked shanks from the pot and place in decorative serving platter. Cut off the kitchen twine and discard.      * Remove and discard bouquet garni from the pot.      * Pour all the juices and sauce from the pot over the shanks. Garnish with chopped parsley and lemon zest.|`|4nhkC9qYaa	I'd go with braising them as well but, cut up some carrots, onions, celery (mirepoix) maybe some thyme and rosemary, fresh if you can find it and use a red wine for braising, make sure to sear the meat to keep in the juices and cook for 2-3 hours on a low heat such as 300-340.

Add the garlic, marjoram, thyme and bay leaf and stir until blended.  Add the tomatoes and bring to a boil.  Return the veal to the pan and cook for 1 minute.  Raise the heat to high, pour in the wine and deglaze the pan by stirring to dislodge any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.    When the mixture boils add about 2 cups of the meat stock; the liquid should reach three-fourths the way up the sides of the veal shanks.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover partially and simmer, turning the shanks over occasionally.  Continue cooking, adding more stock as needed to keep the mixture moist, until the veal is tender when pierced with a fork and there are about 2 cups of liquid and vegetables remaining about 2 1/2 hours.  If there is too much liquid, uncover and boil gently to concentrate the broth.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.    Gremolata  Toss together all the ingredients until evenly distributed.    To Serve  Discard the bay leaf.  Place 1 veal shank on each plate and spoon the broth and vegetables on top.  Sprinkle with the gremolata and serve immediately.
PhPOLgHGaa	sarah seems to have a pretty good idea. with the way thigns are now a days i think giving little useful tidbits is a great idea. rather then to much cookies or candies (which some ppl cant even eat or some dont like so then sadly it would go to waste)    get something that would be very nutral for men or women...depending on who you are giving the boxes to of course or if for children....    you can go to the dollar store and get a few packs of the lip gloses that have 2 in a pack and break them apart so you have 2 per and split that up....get those little trial size lotions, some of those little votive candles or tea candles...the little prayer card and pic of baby/person being batized...maybe see if there is some sorta rosary beads avail ....if you want candy just buy a few bags of those peppermints that are individually wraped and toss a few in each box...this will be a lttle filler and most everyone regardless likes a mint now an then...lol...    hope this helps a little bit.    oh if its for kids you can buy like mini tablets/pens/pencils/stickers an such from the dollar store and split them  up between boxs...|`|WiIviMv5aa	chapstick, lipgloss, lotions, prayer cards, pic of person being baptized, recipe, thank you card, travel items, keepsake stone or coin... ive never been to a baptism where they gave out gifts

Any food (or drink) can be bad for you if eat or drink to excess.  If you are eating primarily raw fish in your sushi, you may need to cut back because of possible mercury and have more of a variety, e.g., cooked seafood as in shrimp crunch rolls or calimari rolls, or California rolls or you may want to vary it with veggie rolls or sushi with egg.  Can't imagine sushi itself not being good to eat, I can eat it every day.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	You'll want to limit your consumption of some of the fish used, due to worries about mercury levels.

tAsDynGEaa	in everyone's     a s s|`|XJJlvvzYaa	It shouldn't really matter if you are drinking Bud Light.  The beer will lose very little flavor (of the little flavor it has) over that month.  Beers with much stronger hop flavors and aromas are much more prone to flavor degradation.  Also, other adjuncts (special ingredients, not the main beer ingredients) in beer can affect its shelf life.    I'm not trying to insult Bud Light for having little flavor, I'm a fan of encouraging people to drink what ever they enjoy and not listen to beer/wine/booze snobs.  However, the fact of the matter is this beer has had unbelievable amounts of research and development to ensure it gets to you in an acceptable state.  I'd be shocked if the average beer drinker could tell the difference between Bud Light that is one week and one month old.    All that being said, find the busiest liquor store you can.  The higher volume they deal with the more turn over their inventory will have.  That's your best bet for finding fresh beer.

Beat milk and egg together to make the egg wash.  Lightly moisten each spring roll wrapper with the egg wash.  Place a piece of cheescake in the middle of the wrapper. Fold top of wrapper down over the cheesecake, and both sides towards the middle. Roll each piece towards you until it is completely rolled up. give it a gentle squeeze to make sure the dough is sealed completely.  Place 'eggroll' in heated oil pan and fry until lightly browned (about 15 seconds each side).  Using tongs remove from oil and place in bowl of cinnamon sugar to coat.  Serve with ice cream and drizzled caramel or chocolate    ===  NEIMAN-MARCUS COOKIES     2 cups butter  24 oz. chocolate chips  4 cups flour  2 cups brown sugar  2 tsp. soda  1 tsp. salt  2 cups sugar  1 8 oz. Hershey Bar (grated)  5 cups blended oatmeal  4 eggs  2 tsp. baking powder  2 tsp. vanilla  3 cups chopped nuts  (your choice)    Measure oatmeal, and blend in a blender to a fine powder. Cream the  butter and both sugars. Add eggs and vanilla, mix together with flour,  oatmeal, salt, baking powder, and soda. Add chocolate chips, Hershey  Bar, and nuts. Roll into balls, and place two inches apart on a cookie  sheet    Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees. Makes 112 cookies.  Cost me $250.00 for that I thought I would share.  ===  CHOCOLATE BROWNIE COOKIES  These are one of my signature cookies. They taste like miniature brownies  but oh, the texture! They're reminiscent of a meringue, with a soft, chewy, fudgy center and a crisp exterior that crackles appealingly. Since these cookies are smaller and less dense, they have an elegance that brownies lack. And they don't require the same commitment as a big, gooey bar. I can never eat just one of these. They are also a particular favorite of Gramercy Tavern owner Danny Meyer, who can't eat just one, either!   1/4 cup all-purpose flour  1/4 teaspoon baking powder  1/8 teaspoon salt  2 large eggs  2/3 cup sugar  1/2 tablespoon brewed espresso  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped  2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped   1/2 cup toasted nuts or dried cherries - optional    1. Preheat oven to 375F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  2. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.     3. In the bowl of an electric mixer, briefly whip the eggs to break them up. Add the sugar, espresso, and vanilla and beat on high speed for 15 minutes, until thick.     4. While the eggs are whipping, place the butter in the top of a double boiler, or in a small metal bowl suspended over a pot of simmering (not boiling) water, and scatter the extra-bittersweet and unsweetened chocolate on top. Heat until the butter and chocolate melt. Remove the boiler top from over the water and stir the chocolate and butter until smooth.     5. Gently fold the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture until partially combined (there should still be some streaks). Add the flour mixture to the batter and carefully fold it in. If the batter is very runny, let it rest until it thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.     6. Drop the batter by heaping teaspoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets and bake until puffed and cracked, 8 to 9 minutes. Cool on a wire rack before removing from the baking sheets.     Makes 5 dozen cookies.    MINT CHOCOLATE COOKIES  Sifting powdered sugar over the cooled cookies adds a festive touch.

"Zinfandel":  White:  Considered a middle aged empty nester mom's drink at home from a box    "Zinfandel":  Red:  Reputation somewhat tainted by white's.  Although red zinfandel is a bold wine, the most alcoholic red wine, in fact, and not sweet....most people reject it due to white's reputation as a sissy wine.    "Chianti":  probably mafia choice, as on Sopranos    Classic red burgundy:  awesome

Hg3E5IIOaa	The easiest way to get started in wine is to go to a wine store.  Tell the clerk you know very little and ask for suggestions.  They're usually more than happy to help.  They'll ask some questions about your tastes and come up with solutions that fit your budget.|`|1OgvENZHaa	The easiest wines to start with are light & sweet whites. Riesling would be an easy start: look for anything Schmitt Sohne, it's a very common, very basic Riesling.     http://www.littlegerman.com/index.cgi?id...    It's honestly not great stuff in terms of complexity or flavor, but it's certainly drinkable, inexpensive and probably the most widely available white wine line on the market. Their blue bottle line (blue bottles, little yellow sun or the RELAX bottles) should be available just about anywhere.|`|f24a4de342b1375dc37e91955d32d1a1aa	Beringer is a good everyday brand. I like all their varieties. If you're new to wine, start with the sweet ones, like white zinfindel and white merlot, and the sweet whites like muscato.    Next are the not sweet but still mild varieties, like sauvignon blanc for white (Fetzer does a very nice one and it's inexpensive) and pinot noir for reds. Get used to these before you try harsher ones like Chardonnays and Cabernets. By then you should have some confidence in what to try.    I like to nibble on things when sipping wine, like cheese and crackers and fruit.|`|muXOBVjqaa	You know I just started to get into the whole wine tasting. I did start by attending wineries with friends who have done it. You did mention that there are no wine tasting around the area for you, so what I would suggest is trying out places like "Trader Joe's" and start off wit something soft and sweet like Zinfandel. It gets easier believe me! Try a road trip to a winery one of these days too!|`|t0vuwuGXaa	You are in a small hick town, so I assume you don't have access to a place like trader joes.  Unfortunately grocery store clerks don't know squat about wine.  If you have anything close to a liquor store or wine shop go there.  Here is what I suggest:    Start out with merlot for a red and pinot grigio for white (they are both easy drinking and very non-intimidating)  For the winery, I wouldn't worry too much about that, as everyone has different tastes and will steer you in a million directions.  I'd start looking in the $10 a bottle range from california and go from there.  You can only decide for yourself what you like!  Remember to keep a tasting log of everything you drink so you can go back and compare.    Oh, and don't start with Zinfandel, it's deep red with big bold jammy flavors.  Not for beginners.  I think the other people are referring to White Zinfandel, which is a pink fruity wine (it's actually made from what's left over from making Zinfandel).|`|yrhpnOUPaa	2 Buck Chuck is ok, at Trader Joes|`|eJxbR6DYaa	normally, good affordable wine is about 14.99    also, it depends on what kind of tastes you would prefer, such as: red, white, or blush wines and wether you would like a dry wine or a sweet, fruity tasting wine.  so, i would suggest going to a local spirits store and go to a wine tasting -- this will let you sample several types of wine and from there choose which suits you the best!|`|kXIRz2jwaa	I call this the "Cheap thrill". Get 2 bottles of wine. Get some cheap kosher blackberry or grape wine and get some cheap pinot grigio. Get a bottle of club soda. Get a tall glass of ice and add equal parts pinot grigio and kosher wine, leaving room top off with club soda for a fizzy wine cooler effect!. (add a shot of Gin for adventure) Enjoy!!! :D|`|9cTAi7waaa	dont get one at the groccery store. they usually sell like sangrias and stuff and theyre cheap and gross. Just go to a liqour store and ask for something inexpensive. Ive boughten decent wine for like 6-8 bucks a bottle. and its not gross groccery store wine
AA12336927	Ive never had one overflow. Go ahead and cook on low if you want. I do mine usually at high for about 1 hour then the rest n low till I'm ready|`|IFd94XDkaa	I would change it to low but for longer, maybe 10-12 hrs.      Don't worry about cooking it to long.  I cook my roast in the crock pot on low for about 16-18 hrs and it comes out tender and juicy like no other.|`|NMwW1qUkaa	No you would need more time on low. And don;t worry about the juice overflowing. Not if the pot is only half full.|`|VhrUtQc2aa	slow cookers should have instruction booklet inside but i don't see what can go wrong just keep an eye on it|`|BCl9AbWXaa	if anything set it to meduim  heat...on low you may need up to 10 hours....

Tie the shanks with kitchen twine so they hold together during the cooking process.      veal shanks tied and floured    In a large frying pan or pot over medium-high heat, melt the butter with the olive oil.  When hot, add the veal shanks and lightly brown on both sides, about 4 minutes per side.  Remove the veal shanks from the pan and set aside.    Reduce the hat to medium-low and add the onion, carrot, celery and fennel.  Saut until the edges of the onion are translucent, 3-4 minutes, do not allow to brown.  Add the garlic, marjoram, thyme and bay leaf and stir until blended.  Add the tomatoes and bring to a boil.  Return the veal to the pan and cook for 1 minute.  Raise the heat to high, pour in the wine and deglaze the pan by stirring to dislodge any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.    When the mixture boils add about 2 cups of the meat stock; the liquid should reach three-fourths the way up the sides of the veal shanks.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover partially and simmer, turning the shanks over occasionally.  Continue cooking, adding more stock as needed to keep the mixture moist, until the veal is tender when pierced with a fork and there are about 2 cups of liquid and vegetables remaining about 2 1/2 hours.  If there is too much liquid, uncover and boil gently to concentrate the broth.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.    Gremolata  Toss together all the ingredients until evenly distributed.    To Serve  Discard the bay leaf.  Place 1 veal shank on each plate and spoon the broth and vegetables on top.  Sprinkle with the gremolata and serve immediately.
Aej3lgQZaa	Well, we used to say the green M&M's make you horny. But also maybe because they had already used red and yellow for males?|`|AA11564934	green m&m's are an aphrodisiac ;-)|`|eEg5wp8Taa	All the other colors were taken, and there was this one commercial with the Female M&M in every color.|`|WjSJBWl7aa	She has a super special disease    Anyway, since when did chocolate have gender or am I missing something...|`|F3psnNyLaa	cause green is a HORNY color!!    n plus      green is uber awshumm|`|MelQSbHTaa	She's probably sick D':  Don't eat her!|`|FPT6pstraa	Because she is eco-friendly|`|MmH9dLlZaa	cause she is sick|`|JUlzjSBraa	no clue    maybe she is GOING GREEEEEEEEEEEEN    or maybe she is sick    DO NOT EAT THE GREEN M&MS

AA11295695	I agree with the mojito idea!  I use mostly dark rum, a splash of light rum, mint, ice and voila!    Also try the fruit-flavored rums with lemonade.  Cruzan rum has a raspberry rum that is amazing with lemonade or limeade!  Cruzan has a bunch of different flavors (banana, orange, pineapple, coconut etc) that go great with lemonade.    Enjoy!|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	You've gotten some interesting recipes for rum liquor but not for rum liqueur. I believe that it should be sipped straight and in small quantities.     I had some friends who were going to be posted in Jamaica for a project. I told them how much I liked Rumona, made by Wray and Nephews. They got sick on it. I'd forgotten that their drinking habits called for drinking things by the tumblerful. A little Rumona goes a long way.|`|2QXSCHUkaa	it may sound gros but try this, my special resipe.  Put how ever much Rum, then double that with V8 fruit juice (not the vegetable kind), then squeeze a little bit of lime or lemon whatever you feel.    try this its really good  (if you dont have V8 fruit juice, then mix a whole bunch of juices like strawberry,kiwi, apple etc...|`|wM251NNlaa	Rum and coke, rum and ginger-ale(only spiced rum) and i've heard that spiced rum and orange soda is really good as well|`|Kaudz4Msaa	I like something like a mojito.    If you don't have it, dissolve sugar in water.  Add 2 shots light rum, 1 shot dark rum, half juice of lemon, juice of whole lime, about 1 shot sugar syrup, mash fresh mint in the bottom of the glass, top off with club soda or sprite....or both.    Some variation on these ingredients, or experimenting with brown sugar or honey, can sometimes be enjoyable.|`|IvPhch7Faa	bacardi 151 rum and coke
BCl9AbWXaa	here is one i found without the bourbon    http://www.angelfire.com/realm3/unicornt...      this one is good i made it,  just omited the 2TBS of bourbon  http://chinesefood.about.com/od/chickenr...|`|1c19c917a8f43caf8f4545efc8aa39fbaa	Bourbon Chicken      1 1/2 pounds chicken thigh meat   5 tablespoons olive oil   1/4 cup light soy sauce   2 tablespoons red rice vinegar or red wine vinegar   2 tablespoons good bourbon whiskey --sub with syup  6 tablespoons brown sugar  1 green onion, washed and cut into thirds   2 slices ginger   2 cloves garlic, crushed  PREPARATION:  Place the chicken thighs in a shallow 9 X 13-inch baking dish. Combine the remaining ingredients and pour over the chicken. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.  Turn the thighs occasionally to make sure they are entirely coated in the marinade.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius, gas mark 4). Bake the chicken for 45 minutes to 1 hour, basting occasionally, until the juices run clear when the chicken is pierced in the thickest part of the thigh, or a meat thermometer reads at least 170 degrees Fahrenheit (77 degrees Celsuis) in the same part of the thigh. Serve hot.|`|MohdUxdOaa	Oh, you probably can't get enough of it like I did.  But there's more to it than brown sugar.  I can give you the exact recipe  please visit my list of articles on ehow and you will find it there.  click on the link I listed on my resource:
Aej3lgQZaa	Yes, you can still eat it, but I wouldn't wait too much longer on it.    I know turkey's take up to 5 days to defrost in the frig.     Of course I don't know how long your meat was on the counter either. Just make sure it smells okay, and that you cook it thoroughly, and it will be just fine.|`|74209f509512526a7c775597bcd23f8eaa	Just so you know, the process of taking " Frozen" meat and unfreezing it is called " Thawing"   The "De" prefix is equal to "Un" as a prefix. If one were to use the word " De-thawing" that is to mean " Freezing," which is to " Un-Thaw" the meat, in this case.|`|BCl9AbWXaa	i must be old...i never really heard the term of de-thawing..lol..i just take the meat out and let it thaw out.     anyway....i would get ready to cook that meat up soon, as it was once thaw, then frozen now thawed again......sooo now that it has bee fully thawed in your fridge for 2 days plus, cook it up and then by doing so, once its cooked it has a new lifespan...
gMgh2ypsaa	i have been to thailand and i have had tomatoes cut up in my special fried rice|`|432d817139a5e0be18e400a33e0e1908aa	Define authentic. Tomatoes originated from the Americas, and were brought back to Europe. From there, they have spread all around the world.|`|GhZG2LYDaa	I have never made a recipe that calls for tomatoes but that doesn't mean anything. Many Thai recipes are refreshing as salads and could benefit from tomatoes but I don't think they are authentic.|`|OmRKRbrNaa	ABSOLUTELY|`|GqnqqJLPaa	For several years I  lived in the northern part of Thailand, in Udorn, Thani, and Nakhon,  Phanom I don't remember ever seeing tomatoes used in a dish nor do I remember seeing them in Vientian, Laos. Generally if it was red it was from the hot peppers LOL. However, this I can say; both the Thai and Lao are very resourceful and would certainly find a use for them if they were available.
HuJmTs8xaa	You don't have to convince her, just stop eating meat. Your life is just that; your life. Her beliefs don't have to be yours.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Tell your doctor to talk to her about it.|`|N6cuuDAmaa	Tell her that you don't like eating animals and you feel wrong. I don't know. Give her the facts. But don't be mean about it!!|`|8uNLDeLQaa	well i don't know but i tried to be one b4 and it didn't last very long because my moms eggs kept taunting me during breakfast|`|p9rIPd4Maa	Against her beliefs? So she believes in eating meat? It kinda sounds as though the Bible says to "Go out, and eat meat". Anyway, bit off topic, sorry! :)  I don't understand we're you're coming from unfortunately, when I turned vegetarian, it was my mother who suggested I should ! She's not very supportive though, maybe she thought I wouldn't turn veg and was just joking about it... Who knows.... =]    Something that made my transformation a bit easier was buying my own food. My mum couldn't complain because she wouldn't have to spend as much money on me, or even cook for me anymore. In fact, I was cooking her vegetarian meals! (Occasionally she'd want me to chuck in some beef here and there, I wasn't against it - after all it's my choice not hers..)    She might come around. Give her some facts backed my scientific evidence. etc. If you're in the position of buying your own food (monetary wise) then do so. Also, tell her it's what you want, and it's upsetting you to eat meat.    To the person that answered earlier something about her mum's eggs: Most vegetarians actually do eat eggs! =]|`|4zQEvzCsaa	Wait until you move out of home, but until then grin and bear it! Just make non-meat/non-dairy food choices where you can, buy your own foods/drinks (soy milk, vegies, fruits, etc) and cook for yourself for dinner so your mum won't complain as much. My mum was weird about it too.|`|ZyV2InIPaa	explain to her why eating meat is disgusting.  do some research on goveg.com  present it to her in a mature manner.|`|m85emlXyaa	It was very difficult to get my mother to understand when I became a vegetarian. Sometimes, it's still hard for her. I would suggest going on your own and researching why you don't want to eat meat. (Pull research off line why meat is bad for you [your heart], why it's not natural to eat, and why other people don't eat it.) Then in a very calm and adult manner present this information to her. Make sure you calmly explain why you feel the way you do.    Also, you're going to have to show her that you're becoming and adult and you have a right to choose what you put into your body. Don't go screaming or crying about it. Pick out some vegetarian dishes and start trying to cook for yourself and your family. The best way to do this is to show her you're going to handle this responsibly.|`|76835e9a544163134ce35716229cd8f0aa	buy your own food && dont eat the meat she makes..tell her that its okay for her to have her own beliefs so why can't you have your own? tell her how would she feel if someone enforced her to believe in what they believeed|`|zHwSyDNfaa	keep trying to persuade|`|IGbNlvRnaa	Vegetarians tend to live longer! No kidding, it's true. =D  Well, i think you should be the one to decide what to eat, not your mother. I mean you should hold onto your own beliefs. Just follow your heart and good luck.|`|ksjtZ0J5aa	C'mon "superdude." Real men eat meat.|`|Jg2npackaa	Vegetarianism is something that some people just don't understand and you may be unable to convince your mother.  Don't be mean to her about it.  Even though I'm 21 and have been vegetarian for 3 years my mother still seems to take it as a personal attack that I don't want to eat the meat dishes she prepares.  Your best bet is to sit her down and talk to her about why you want to change your diet.  Next, offer to prepare your own meals.  Sure it'll be difficult if you're not used to it, but you're going to have to learn some day!  She can't really protest to her child wanting to eat more fruits and vegetables, so groceries shouldn't be too much of a problem.  Good luck!
