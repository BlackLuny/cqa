Sony Walkman vs. SanDISK Sansa Fuze (both 8GB)      I need a new mp3 player, and I'm having a lot of trouble deciding between the two.

I would use it the most when I travel, and sometimes when I work out or something... and I'm the kind of person that would rather bring my laptop than watch a movie on a tiny screen, but 8GB is more than enough for all my music, so I might upload a video to watch every now and then. but I'd mainly use it for music.

So I've been using DDR for exercise lately and i tried the workout mode so i can see how many calories i've burned. But sometimes it will say i've burned 500 calories in like 30 mins! That just doesn't sound right at all.      Does anybody know about how many calories you can burn per song? I usually use heavy mode.

20090306170518AACM34P	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Xbox 360 controller won't stop vibrating!?	I bought an energizer 360 charger and was ready to use it when, of course they make you buy your own rechargeable batteries. So I run to Wal-Mart and buy rechargeable Energizer batteries. I put them in and put the controller on the dock, and it seemed to be working, but after a few minutes the light went green and the controller started vibrating. I figured okay i guess that means it's done, but I was skeptical about the vibrating. I took it off, and it didn't stop. I switched batteries, it didn't stop. I played on it, turned off vibrate on the xbox and game, and it hasn't stopped. What is going on? Is it safe to put my other controller on the dock? If there is no other way, I guess i'll just have to open it up and take out the vibrating motors, but what kind of screwdriver would I need to open it? By the way, I was thinking about putting a rapid-fire button on it, so if I do have to take the motors out, I will use this oppurtunity to put one on it.

20090227095209AA72R7p	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Is this a real site, or a scam?	I just randomly found this site when I was looking at buying wiis.       http://www.shooooes.com/list/5541.html       This sounds way too good to be true. I know it can't totally be a scam because they accept credit cards, and paypal, and its as simple as calling the credit card company and telling them the transaction is fraudulent to get your money back.      But seriously HOW CAN THIS BE REAL??? You get every accessory imaginable and like 50 games??

I am trying to figure out, why Philips new flatscreens doesnt support formats as Xvid and Avi via Usb anymore. My brother do have the newest Aurea, and before that he had Philips 42PFL9831D, which had support of reasonable many formats via USB.      Thank you.
