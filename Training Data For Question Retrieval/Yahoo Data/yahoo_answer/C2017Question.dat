20090226161957AAxEvY0	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Why the Wii can not get viruses?	I already am aware that it is next to impossible to a virus on the Wii, because it has no hardrive, can not run software that has not been secured by nintendo, can not store internet cookies , it can not run any .exe's, has its own porccessor architexture, and its OS does not run like a standard computer OS as long as you have a completely un modded Wii. (which i have). Plus i even have our wireless router set up to use WPA2,  pretty much the second most secure wireless encrption.      I have explained this to my Dad, but he still thinks you can EASILY get viruses easily on the Wii. SO could someone please give me a easy to understand explaination on why the Wii can not get viruses that i could tell him. Please try to make it very simple and not using very much computer jargan.

Hey, my Xbox 360 does perfectly fine with all my other games, but for some whenever I play Oblivion it freezes for about 15-30 secons every time I open a door, travel, search a dead body, pick a lock, use a repair hammer, etc.      As you can imagine it gets quite annoying and really detracts from the gaming experience.       This game disc is in pristine condition. I beat the game about 2 years ago and have decided replaying it.........falling in love with it again. Game ran great last time I beat it and it's been in the case since the last time I played it.      The Xbox is really starting to frustrate me. My original XBOX got the RROF about a year ago, and my current one is a HALO3 edition and is just over a year old.       Any suggestions..............is there something I can blow in LMAO!?!      BTW: I tried cleaning the disc already. I tried restarting, I tried deleting old content to make room on the HDD, I tried playing the game with different gamertags, I tried playing on Live and on a local network..............same results.

20090226175542AAnPpbf	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	To decide on a cell phone?	The ones I'm currently considering are:   Samsung glyde   Blackberry curve 8330 smartphone   Blackberry 8830 world edition smartphone in red   Verizon Wireless SMT5800   BlackBerry? 8703e      I currently have an iPod Touch and a two year old *original* chocolate that decided to officially break yesterday. What I am considering doing is selling the iPod Touch on eBay, getting a phone with the internet/email/IM/etc., and then getting a video iPod. That way I will still have my good internet and such, but won't be confined to 16 GB, and I'll also have a [very nice] working phone. I do go to Europe for approx. 2 weeks every year (so the world edition blackberry would be helpful in that case), but I'm just not sure.   I am currently using Verizon Wireless and, at this point, i think I plan on staying with them. Also, I dislike touch screen phones (with on-screen keyboards, I can get over it if the touch-screen is not a keyboard).    Currently verizon is having a sale on the Verizon Wireless SMT5800:  http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store...       I do not know the pros and cons of each phone (I used to keep up with it, but found it useless after awhile). What are the pros and cons to each blackberry? Should I get a blackberry, the Samsung, or the Verizon Wireless SMT5800?         Thank you very much.

The cable company uses R6 3.0 GHz cable, which is better than what we currently have installed. Will the picture or sound be affected negatively by the 2.3 GHz cable. Would it be wise to upgrade to the 3.0 GHz cable? I don't want to spend money that I don't need to, so if the 2.3 GHz cable is fine and we won't notice any difference, then we'll stick to what we already have - R6 2.3 GHz cable.

20090226145530AAnU9sK	Consumer Electronics;Land Phones	My house phones aren't working!!!!!!!?	i called the vonage people and i was with them for an hour and they still did not help me. i can not get any calls or make calls right now. it has been going on for days and i'm afraid that theres going to be an emergency or something and i won't be able to call help.       i also have 2 computers. the 1st one is working (thats why i'm on here) and the 2nd does not work. probably because when i was on with the vonage folks they told me to move some cables around so eventually i somehow disconnected my 2nd computer's internet.       i have a LINKSYS wireless router, a vonage modem, an internet modem, and my computer. those are the four things they made me fiddle around with.       the last thing they made me do is connect the yellow slot in the vonage modem to the hardrive of my 1st computer. then have the blue slot in my vonage modem connect to the internet modem. and now the cable that WAS connected to my router and vonage modem is not plugged anywhere      if it is hard for you to explain, should i call vonage people again? i really dont want to....
20090226174035AAsZXeQ	Consumer Electronics;Other - Electronics	I have a TV with an Optical Output that I'm trying to hook to a stereo that has RCA Cable Inputs~ Help?!?	Okay- so I can get sound through my stereo only IF I use my PS2, but I want to be able to hear sound via PS2 and Cable. I don't have a cable box so that's out of the question. My TV is a 26" Vizio and the output on the TV is only for an Optical Cable, the back of my stereo still has the old RCA (red and white) inserts. Is there some sort of converter splitter that I can hook these into that will make them work? I looked at the "Digital-to-Analog" Converters that are for cable/antenna broadcasting and I don't see how they could aid me in my situation. Most people hear about this problem of mine and think I should be able to hook it up direct since both the stereo and the TV are updated, the Playstation of course, isn't. Help~! (Please dumb down your answer so I can understand Electronics language, lol)

Sprint turned off the feature for MMS on their Blackberry however to fix this       you go to the blackberry site and download the newest desktop manager. 4.7>      You plug in your phone and then let the phone get updated to 4.5.       Make sure you select the programs that sprint originally loaded to stay and not be deleted. Otherwise Sprint Nav and Sprint Tv will get deleted.      Let it do the update it takes about half an hour...then your phone will reset and restart....once the phone restarts....pick any contact...and it will say MMS (name)       Now you can ONLY send MMS. But you cannot receive them. if anyone sends you an MMS text it will be sent to sprint pcs pictures and you will only get a link not...a text with picture.       hope this helps.

Whenever I insert a game, my xbox 360 makes this annoying "scratching sound" when reading the disc. I thought the only sound that should be coming out of the 360 was the CD spinning at high speeds.

20090226174442AAMbyg9	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Speed Camera Business Idea?	Okay; so im in a business class and need to come up with an business idea to present to the class. It has to be supported by a news article as well.      Right now (in AZ) there are a lot of people complaining about all the speed cameras going up on our highways. I was wondering if those cameras put out any type of wireless signal or frequency to send information.      My business idea would be to create a product that would be installed in your car and when it sensed a traffic cam from up to a quarter mile away it would deccelerate the car to 55-65 mph.       Good Idea? Anyone got anything better?
20090226175107AAZ1kRL	Consumer Electronics;Home Theater	How should I connect my PS3 and cable box to get proper surround sound?	I'm kind of confused as to how I can connect my HD cable box and PS3 to receive surround sound without having to switch cables everytime.      I have a...   - LG HDTV w/ 2x HDMI connections   - LG DVD player (receiver for 5.1 system) w/ 1x HDMI & 1x Optical connection    - PS3 w/ 1 HDMI & 1x Optical connection    - Motorola HD cable box w/ 1x DVI, 1x Component & 1x Optical connection      Since my cable box has a DVI connection, if I get a DVI-HDMI cable, will that be able to deliver sound? If so I would probably buy a HDMI switch of some sort.

As far as I can tell Designers of cordless phones hate their customers and want us all to suffer - please show me I am wrong.      Features I'm looking for:      Dect 6 - so it won't fight my wifi      3 handsets      1 phone book for all phones - not separate phone book on each phone   Good battery life - Phillips have to live on charger and usually die if you use the speaker phone.      Caller ID that shows both name and number at once - preferably name from my phone book if it's there.      Caller ID that shows quickly (I've heard some Panasonic take 3-4 rings to show caller ID)      Easy caller ID to review calls I've missed, or call back people - Phillips especially nasty for that.      No need for Answering machine - I've got Vonage for that. (I love Vonage)  If it has an answering machine I want it easy to turn off      Clock on handsets
20090226190046AAVSMmY	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Why an Apple iPod? (A question for iPod owners)?	I have long been curious about the consumer trends related to the Apple iPod craze of the last 4 years...as such, my question is as follows:      Why, despite the existence of arguably superior personal players of compressed audio and video files on the market on the basis of value, do consumers default to the more expensive iPod so consistently?       What exactly is it about the iPod that attracts you to this particular device? Is it the design, the functionality, the integrated services (iTunes), or perhaps another reason, that drove your decision to purchase this particular device above all others despite the higher cost?      Thank you in advance for your input.
