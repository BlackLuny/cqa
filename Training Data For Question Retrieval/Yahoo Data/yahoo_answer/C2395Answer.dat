It is developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation.    The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and Windows NT. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP standards.    Apache has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April 1996. The November 2005 Netcraft Web Server Survey found that more than 70% of the web sites on the Internet are using Apache, thus making it more widely used than all other web servers combined.    you can download it from http://httpd.apache.org/|`|0f46bdb0794255f3f57816788f5de552aa	its a open source. just google it you ll get a lot

Swamp coolers are different than your normal air conditioners.  They use water and add humidity to the air.  If you used a traditional air conditioner, the air would be even more dry, and wouldn't really feel all that different.  When you add humidity to the air, with the cooler temperature, it makes it feel much cooler.

AA11848523	I have just answered this very question. But I suppose I could post it here too.    It's for the reasons I've listed below:      (1) The war in Iraq is a continuation of the Gulf War. It's a statement by the US that says "Those that defy us pay the price" (It was also widely believed that they were in no position to defend themselves)    (2) It's also a giant power struggle for control over the oil. It's not about getting the oil, the US can do that without going to war, it's about controlling it. Oil is power. And ultimate control of it is ultimate power.    (3) It's about establishing a foothold in the Middle East. The largest US Embassy in the world is now in Iraq and a continued prescence in the area will greatly enhance US power. It's also handy by creating a stepping stone into neighbouring Iran.    (4) It's about creating a dummy state - a fake democracy - one where the Iraqi people believe they are electing the government when the actual government is ruled over by US 'overseers'.    (5) It's about money - namely the 'rebuilding' of Iraq. Contracts have already been handed out to US companies worth billions.     (6) It's an attempt at safeguarding America's economic future|`|83d6dab16d81c6e1ac79f6018241552aaa	1. US wants to control the global Oil scene.  2. And to Prevent others from getting it first.  2.

It would have meant the collapse of the US economy and the end of the economic stranglehold the US holds over the rest of the world.  Everything was heading toward that happening... and more OPEC nations would have followed suit.  Many members of George W Bush's cabinet, in fact, signed off on plans to counter that -- by invasion and control of Iraq, before the 2000 elections.  So, technically, when members of the administration kept insisting that it wasn't about oil... they were right.  It was about money.    2) To divert attention from the inability of Bush's administration to handle domestic issues.  It wasn't his strong suit to begin with, and the way the administration has dealt with domestic isues has borne that out.  The people who worked for him directed attention outward, even directed the intelligence community to come up with evidence that fit what they wanted to have happen -- which just wasn't there.  It's a less at work in Shakespeare's Henry V: if the country is splitting apart, direct their attention toward another country.|`|AA11909112	The main purpose of the conflict was Sadam was known to have weapons of mass destruction America checked it out.  None were found but he did have plenty of time to get rid of them.  if America had sat back and done nothing and he had put them into use everyone would be crying why didn't you check it out?  You are damned if you do and damned if you don't.  Also the picture of the faces on the day that Sadams statue came down I have not forgotten.  The Iraqui people had been set free from living under a cruel dictator.  A lot of people sit back and point the finger but there are always two sides to a story and this is the side I see.  I have heard comments coming from the mouths of Iraqui people and they have been glad of the American intervention.   God Bless America.

You know if each nation that was involved in the 1st conflict had a sharp shooter and taken him out than no one nation could have been to blame.    This would have save countless lifes both of the Iraqi people and our brave soldiers now.    The main purpose was to save the Iraqi people from a very cruel man.  I deleivered food to our people after the war that were stationed in iraqi and I could hear the bombing he did of his own people.  There is nothing like a childs cry or a mothers tears to touch your heart yet we soliders were powerless to do anything.    Now, we secured the nation and they are learning the changes that need to be made to secure their own futures.  But a beaten down people who have suffered for centries will take time to shed their fears.  To become total self sufficent they must do so and they are a strong people, many with good hearts and they will do so for themselves and for their country.    They thank us now, but thanks doesn't sell papers, hate does.    We fight the terrism that threatens the roots of the new Iraqi as the people fight their own fears.  We will prevail, the people will prevail because we are a team.  They just need to learn to beleive.    Beleiving is hard when you have been told you are nothing.  Beleiving takes nuturing and not starvation, it takes courage and not fright.  It takes the will to be better not to just be.    I beleive in these people and wish them to beleive in themselves for a better tomorrow.

Part of learning to write well is learning to read well.  If you don't want to write like a scholar, and just want to improve your writing to the average standard of most English speakers, a great place to go is the newspapers.  Read articles from the New York Times or the Washington Post.  It will improve your English and in addition you will get a better perspective on American culture.  Obviously, you could take classes as well, but I assume you are already doing so.  Reading complex grammar books helps with the syntax.  Another part of writing well is practice.  Getting an English speaking e-mail pal to correct your writing is a good start if you don't have the money for a private tutor (and who does?)|`|e5516d02d646e174b1bd2c73669a2db7aa	Read Strunk and White's "Elements Of Style"  then practice|`|AA10363647	Read a newspaper every day.

To do it easier do a list of your main ideas and develop them into paragraphs, that way youll have the development part done in no time.

W8pEdLruaa	Dramatic poetry is any poetry that uses the discourse of the characters involved to tell a story or portray a situation.<br>  Narrative poetry is poetry that tells a story. In its broadest sense, it includes epic poetry; some would reserve the name narrative poetry for works on a smaller scale and generally with more direct appeal to human interest than the epic.<br>  Lyric poetry is a form of poetry that does not attempt to tell a story, as do epic poetry and dramatic poetry, but is of a more personal nature instead. Rather than portraying characters and actions, the lyric poet addresses the reader directly, portraying his or her own feelings, states of mind, and perceptions. \ Most lyric poetry are made in a singable and rhymable way, although some lyric poems can be excepted.

tzIxwprYaa	Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly comes from Shakespeare's As You Like It Act 2 scene 7 -The complete verse is: <br>  "Blow, Blow thou  winter wind <br>  Thou are not so unkind<br>  As  Man's ingratitude<br>  Thy tooth is not so keen<br>  Because thou art not seen<br>  Although thy breath be rude<br>  Heigh-ho sing heigh ho unto the green holly<br>  Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly<br>  The heigh-ho the holly! The holly!<br>  This life is most jolly."<br>  <br>  The other quote comes from the verse: <br>  'Happy the man and happy he alone <br>  He, who can call his day his own:<br>  He who, secure within, can say,<br>  To-morrow do thy worst, for I have lived today. ' It is a verse in an ode by Roman poet Horace - Quintus Horatius Flaccus, 65 to 8 BC.(Odes bk.3. verse 29)<br>  it was translated by English poet and playwright John Dryden, in the 17th century.|`|VBi54WAMaa	In the first case, the Bard says that Man is much worse then the winter wind, and do some comparison. In that specific case, he says that although the wind can use its rude voice to "sing" through the trees, most of Man's friendship is simply fake, and most of his loving is simply foolish, instead of real love - and that's *really* deceiving.<br>  <br>  In the second period, the other poet states that happyness is achieved by Man alone, as a victory against time itself - as if sooner or later time could win. Happy is the Man who can say "time, try again, because I have lived so far". I guess by "lived", you can say "being happy", as well. Not really an optimistic point of view! :p|`|sk0wOzUHaa	what do u mean by 'know'?

Mark Twain's sarcasm reveals that he is a realist... or reveals he is a pessimist... or reveals his opinion on such and such a topic etc.  Good luck :) hope this helps
IqF9XrlFaa	Salut,<br>  Je ne suis pas une spécialiste de toutes ces catégories mais je peux vous en dire soit ce que je sais pour l'avoir fait soit ce qu'on en dit habituellement.<br>  Un BTS est un dipl?me bac+2 qui se fait généralement dans un lycée ou une école privée et qui donne un niveau de formation recherché dans beaucoup de domaines. Le cursus comporte des stages.<br>  Le BTS valait mieux que l'ancien DEUG de la fac, bac+2 également mais qui n'ouvrait sur rien.<br>  D'où la réforme universitaire pour avoir au moins une licence qui normalement permet les réorientations plus facilement.<br>  Je passe le DUT.<br>  La différence entre une grande école et l'université c'est que les diplomes des grandes écoles sont plus c?tés sur le marché de l'emploi normalement (HEC,...).<br>  Une classe préparatoire prépare justement à entrer dans des cursus supérieurs de type "grande école" mais il y en a aussi pour la fac de médecine.<br>  Moi j'ai fait l'université. Une université se compose de plusieurs facultés (sciences humaines, lettres, sciences, économie, médecine...) qui regroupent un certain nombre de départements d'enseignement et de recherche. Parfois elles peuvent être groupées.<br>  La fac du système LMD, c'est niveau Licence (en 3 ans), niveau Master (en 2 ans) et niveau Doctorat (en 3 ans).<br>  Dans chaque filière on peut aller de la licence au doctorat. Sachant que soutenir une thèse de doctorat, c'est l'excellence. Mais ?a n'offre pas forcément de meilleurs emplois à la sortie !<br>  On peut se réorienter, de préférence après la licence 3, avant c'est risqué car on n'a pas le diplome de la licence.<br>  Le mieux est au moins d'aller jusqu'au master. Sauf si on fait une licence professionnelle.<br>  En master, il y a master pro qui ouvre sur la vie active à sa sortie et master recherche pour ceux qui le souhaitent et qui veulent éventuellement se diriger vers une thèse plus tard mais on peut s'y inscrire quand même avec un master pro.<br>  Voilà, votre question est trop vague pour répondre plus.<br>  Le mieux est d'aller au CIO de votre lycée ou d'une fac car ils expliquent toutes ces choses bien mieux que moi. Surtout si vous prenez rdv avec le conseiller d'orientation.<br>  Ne faites pas les choses au hasard, c'est important pour la suite.<br>  Bonne continuation,<br>  Alma.|`|4461ed21df7e31de54fdd0308bb4b270aa	Si tu as les moyens financiers et intellectuels fait une école de commerce|`|84a2cb28d288dc338a26d570a32177c0aa	va sur le site de l'onisep ou rapproche toi d'un conseiller d'orientation c'est gratuit.

eec61b9791496ca2bff48e78593ac3beaa	Both of the above are good answers.  Keep the GPA up.  Do extremely well on the standardized tests - do not underestimate their importance.  <br>  <br>  Finally, give the appropriate consideration to the essays.  Do not assume they simply want a routine essay on your leadership, swim team, blah blah blah that a thousand other candidates will write.  You need to sell yourself, present your leadership, present you passions, present your interests, but in a unique way, something that makes you absolutely stand out.  Best way to do that is write from the heart, and really own every word of your essay.  I personally think for someone like you, who has the academic credentials and the (assumed) test scores, how you stand out in the essay will make all the difference in the world.<br>  <br>  And have a couple of people with excellent grammar skills proofread those essays.  Don't forget that!|`|3iytda0Yaa	Go Bruins! I think what they are looking for most is candidates that are well-rounded. For example, they should have good grades, be involved in extracurricular activities, and maybe do volunteer work as well. They want people who know a bit about everything, who are willling to try new things, and who are not afraid of doing some work to get what they want. Good luck!|`|RLtO1kwNaa	The most important 2 things I think that they will look for are:<br>  1. A demonstrable passion for education. Even if you can't take a lot of AP courses you should inform them of this limitation and find a way to show them that you are overcoming it.<br>  2. Leadership. Enough said, do something in the community that looks good on your record.<br>  Lets see if that advice works for me tomorrow...

AA10863814	It's a matter of semantics, really. In what type of context is it being used? What comes before and after the statement? Are these two questions trying to convey the same message? If so, of and with mean relatively the same thing. They are both prepositions. <br>  <br>  Prepositions are words which begin prepositional phrases.<br>  A prepositional phrase is a group of words containing a preposition, a noun or pronoun object of the preposition, and any modifiers of the object.<br>  <br>  A preposition sits in front of (is “pre-positioned” before) its object.<br>  <br>  The prepositions in this case are (of) and (with). The objects it is "prepositioned" before are (bilingual) and (bi cultural)<br>  Either one would be satisfactory depending on what type of context they will be used in. My personal opinion is that the first one sounds better on the ears for some reason. Maybe because (with) indicates a type of ownership and (of) sounds more participatory.<br>  <br>  In the second sentence, you are simply calling them "masters" which isn't necessarily related to their capabilities. The first sentence directly links their mastery to their bilingual and bi cultural capacities with the preposition (of). Of reads more participatory|`|qFR4keIJaa	the first one- it's more grammatically correct
AA11571486	Many people talk about climbing without oxygen, yet few actually do it. Even the sherpas will usually use oz. This spring, we climbed with Babu Sherpa. He stayed on the summit for 22 hours with no supple- mentary oxygen. That year, no other sherpa even climbed the south side without.<br>  <br>  Babu has an extraordinary genetic ability even for a sherpa (together with a strong mind), to climb without oxygen. To attempt something like that would probably mean suicide for a non-sherpa. In addition, a safety net had to be built around Babu.<br>  <br>  First of all, Babu had a history of seven Everest summits without oxygen. The attempt was planned for a full year with additional sherpas, ropes and oxygen for rescue. Finally, we monitored Babu from C4 and C2 during the entire night, continuously asking him his name, age, number of children and so on, to check for signs of AMS and HACE.<br>  <br>  Considering even all of these precautions though, Babu's attempt was still highly dangerous (and looked pretty bad for a while, too).<br>  <br>  Do not attempt Everest without oxygen, unless you are an experienced +8000-meter/26000 ft climber, with at least one previous experience of being at 8500-meters/28000 ft without. Your sherpa should carry a spare oxygen bottle for emergency. And remember to drink plenty of fluids.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mounteverest.net/pages/nspages/getoz.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.mounteverest.net/pages/nspage...</a>|`|AA11157530	Sandeep Krishnaswami once climbed stairs while holding his breath.

AA11930854	A computer is a machine for manipulating data according to a list of instructions known as a program.    Computers are extremely versatile. In fact, they are universal information-processing machines. According to the ChurchTuring thesis, a computer with a certain minimum threshold capability is in principle capable of performing the tasks of any other computer. Therefore, computers with capabilities ranging from those of a personal digital assistant to a supercomputer may all perform the same tasks, as long as time and memory capacity are not considerations. Therefore, the same computer designs may be adapted for tasks ranging from processing company payrolls to controlling unmanned spaceflights. Due to technological advancement, modern electronic computers are exponentially more capable than those of preceding generations (a phenomenon partially described by Moore's Law).    Computers take numerous physical forms. Early electronic computers were the size of a large room, while entire modern embedded computers may be smaller than a deck of playing cards. Even today, enormous computing facilities still exist for specialized scientific computation and for the transaction processing requirements of large organizations. Smaller computers designed for individual use are called personal computers. Along with their portable equivalent, the laptop computer, personal computers are ubiquitous information processing and communication tools and are usually what most people think of as "a computer". However, the most common form of computer in use today is the embedded computer. Embedded computers are usually relatively simple and physically small computers used to control another device. They may control machines from fighter aircraft to industrial robots to digital cameras.      Main article: History of computing     ENIAC was a milestone in computing history.Originally, the term "computer" referred to a person who performed numerical calculations, often with the aid of a mechanical calculating device or analog computer. Examples of these early devices, the ancestors of the computer, included the abacus and the Antikythera mechanism, an ancient Greek device for calculating the movements of planets which dates from about 87 BC.[1] The end of the Middle Ages saw a reinvigoration of European mathematics and engineering, and Wilhelm Schickard's 1623 device was the first of a number of mechanical calculators constructed by European engineers.[2]    In 1801, Joseph Marie Jacquard made an improvement to existing loom designs that used a series of punched paper cards as a program to weave intricate patterns. The resulting Jacquard loom is not considered a true computer but it was an important step in the development of modern digital computers.    Charles Babbage was the first to conceptualize and design a fully programmable computer as early as 1820, but due to a combination of the limits of the technology of the time, limited finance, and an inability to resist tinkering with his design, the device was never actually constructed in his lifetime. By the end of the 19th century a number of technologies that would later prove useful in computing had appeared, such as the punch card and the vacuum tube, and large-scale automated data processing using punch cards was performed by tabulating machines designed by Hermann Hollerith.    During the first half of the 20th century, many scientific computing needs were met by increasingly sophisticated special-purpose analog computers, which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for computation. These became increasingly rare after the development of the programmable digital computer.       An exploded view of a modern personal computer:   Display   Motherboard   CPU (Microprocessor)   Primary storage (RAM)   Expansion cards   Power supply   Optical disc drive   Secondary storage (HD)   Keyboard   Mouse   A succession of steadily more powerful and flexible computing devices were constructed in the 1930s and 1940s, gradually adding the key features of modern computers, such as the use of digital electronics (largely invented by Claude Shannon in 1937)[3] and more flexible programmability. Defining one point along this road as "the first digital electronic computer" is exceedingly difficult. Notable achievements include the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (1937), a special-purpose machine that used valve-driven (vacuum tube) computation, binary numbers, and regenerative memory; the secret British Colossus computer (1944), which had limited programmability but demonstrated that a device using thousands of valves could be both made reliable and reprogrammed electronically; the Harvard Mark I, a large-scale electromechanical computer with limited programmability (1944); the decimal-based American ENIAC (1946)  which was the first general purpose electronic computer, but originally had an inflexible architecture that meant reprogramming it essentially required it to be rewired; and Konrad Zuse's Z machines, with the electromechanical Z3 (1941) being the first working machine featuring automatic binary arithmetic and feasible programmability.    The team who developed ENIAC, recognizing its flaws, came up with a far more flexible and elegant design, which has become known as the Von Neumann architecture (or "stored program architecture"). This stored program architecture became the basis for virtually all modern computers. A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored program architecture commenced in the mid to late-1940s; the first of these were completed in Britain. The first to be up and running was the Small-Scale Experimental Machine, but the EDSAC was perhaps the first practical version that was developed.    Valve (tube) driven computer designs were in use throughout the 1950s, but were eve|`|e92e869e98edcf7e6af91bc36e193cc3aa	Does it have to be about computers specifically or what you can do with them?

004c07512df1a24fdf70ed74dfe58967aa	A bachelor's degree in psychology isn't as marketable as a master's degree.  With a master's degree you can become a therapist or counselor, or you could teach as an adjunct (part-time) instructor at the college or community college level.  Most universities don't list specialty areas in psychology until the master's program, and then it's usually branched into cognitive, counseling, and educational psychology.  Cognitive deals with testing and research; counseling is therapy-based; and educational psych requires work in a school system in which you would be testing kids for developmental difficulties and learning disabilities.    If you stop at a bachelor's degree, you'd probably have to look for a job in a field that isn't related to psychology at all and one that doesn't pay very well.      Go the extra two years so that your options will be wider.  If you're only a freshman or sophomore, you'll be surprised to see how fast it goes once you've graduated and two more years won't seem like much time at all.|`|b004db63c6a020bbe8c0e5da9b05ddfcaa	I suggest you get therapy.

Also a bachelors in psychology lets you get a masters many different fields besides psychology.|`|71dfc61b9ca0655e631f6949b2d8f598aa	Do not major in psych if you only want a bachelors.....a bachelors in psych is equivalent to a high school degree.  You atleast need a masters to practice.  Look into school psychology....you can do therapy in schools or testing.  It gives variety.  And you only need a masters to succeed.  Child psych and Ed psych usually are better with doctorates.|`|AA10075184	If you are thinking of doing anything regarding therapy and or counseling, then you have to get your Masters degree.   If you are thinking of only pursuing a BA in psychology then you will be able to do some nonprofit work, teaching, marketing, human resource work but NO therapy work.

(x^2 - 81)  -------------  (sqrt(x)-3)    = 2x - 0     ---------     (1/(2*sqrt(x))) - 0    input x = 9    = 2 (9)     ------     (1/(2*sqrt(9)))    = 18    ------    (1/6)  = 108    Hope it helps  Note: Sometimes you need to rearragne or simplify the equation before actually derive it, However, avoid eliminating any variables through crossing common factors.

lhOd2hvXaa	This statement is, quite frankly, completely incorrect:  "The major problem most people have with animal testing is that in many cases it is not carried out humanely. Many of the animals used are kept in terrible conditions with little care, and when they are not needed anymore they are killed. The critics of animal testing base their argument on the grounds of morality, the necessity these procedures, and whether it is being carried out by people with proper authority to perform such tests."    Look into the laws that regulate the use of animals in teaching and research (google animal welfare act).   The laws that control the humane use of animals in research are very stringent (even more so than the laws that govern how I treat and house my own animals).  Institutions or corporations that use animals in teaching and research are federally mandated to oversee and evaluate all aspects of animal care and use (this includes both the necessity of the testing and the competence of individuals to perform procedures).    Good luck with your speech.  I do hope you fix some of your erroneous ideas, however.|`|cDKz55SEaa	its really good but half about giving a speech is about how you talk to people and putting emotion into it.

Si es as, pods mencionar ese hecho, la nostalgia de pensar que este era el ltimo a?o con compa?eros que conocas desde tu infancia..... que con este 12 grado cerrs una etapa de tu vida.... por ejemplo    - cmo se vea la sala de clase en ese primer da.... que estacin del a?o eS, si hace frio o calor,     - que sentiste al ver a los alumnos de otros grados, los ms peque?os, y tal vez compararlos con vos, que ya alcanzaste el 12 grado.... cuantas cosas tienen ellos por aprender, profesores por disfrutar ( y otros por "aguantar")...    - si te gustaria tomar una fotografia ( o si tal vez la tomaste) en ese primer dia de clase, para recordarlo en el futuro....    - qu pensabas la noche anterior a ese primer dia de clases del 12 grado.... si las cosas despus fueron como las imaginabas... las primeras palabras con que recibio la profesora o el profesor a LOs alumnos....

En clase rodeado de gente extra?a me preguntaba ?qu estar pasando en mi casa? ?alguin jugar con mi nintendo? cuando una voz chillona y estridente proveniente de las cuerdas vocales de una se?ora flcida y vieja me pedan que les prestase un momento de atencin. S como no solamente un momento ?2 horas escuchando las supuestas labores que tengo que seguir!... porqu estoy aqu, quiz mis padres no me quieren, quiz quieren un momento de soledad e intimidad, me hubiesen mandado a los videojuegos si asi fuere. La escuela no es segura ?que no en una escuela un par de muchachos acribillaron a unos pobres jvenes que igual que yo apenas comenzaban una vida estudiantil?

7waA9vGeaa	Probably not. From personal experience, my tuition was close to $7,000 & about $2,000 of it was paid for by scholarships & grants (the rest was stafford loans). That $2,000 was subtracted from the total education credit I could receive. In your case, I doubt you would get any money because all of your tuition was paid for using grants/scholarships, so the total education credit would be eaten up by that money. However, if you do get a 1089T in the mail, still report it on your taxes--it couldn't hurt.

3crV33rPaa	My friend last year went to public school and was swamped by the people aspect of it, he'd been home schooled most of his life.  Anyway, he's coming home next year because he really didn't feel like the work assigned was enough or something. What courses you take - its mostly what you would be taking in public school. Home schooling is great because you can choose what you take! I mean there are certain things that are required, but there is freedom. I'm in 8th grade and right now am taking an Honors English class (with other home schooled students, only 4 though, not a full class. Which is great, more 1-1 time!), at a 9/10 grade level because I'm interested in writing. Algebra 1 is 8th grade for me in 9th I'll be taking Algebra 2 10th Geometry because my mom thinks it would be easier for me to do it 1 then 2 instead of 1 Geo 2, but whatever. The only tests Required for a home schooler to take in something very similar to a EOG - i think thats it an End of Grade? It's okay for you mom to teach you, my moms an art major and shes taught my brother all the way from PreSchool to College.   E-mail me at addmaile@yahoo.com, id love to help you more.|`|pT3td0BXaa	google Vision in Education|`|O22eHc4jaa	I am homeschooled, and its an online public school. The program is k12. It has all grade levels. And I believe its free for whatever state your in. They will send you all your books, materials, and even a computer. Your parents (depending on the year) dont have to 'teach' you. Thats for high school. All they have to do is be a mentor, and log attendence. If you are considering this option I would go to www.k12.com. Look around.|`|pLCLtbtFaa	I don't like the pressure from friends and other people at school either. I hate it! I think school changed me into being a low-self-esteem person.. :[  If you have a lot of money, you can get homeschooled. But It's pricy. I can't afford it.|`|r18PoGJiaa	Person above me is a ding dong. Home schooling is NOT expensive as long as you are choosing it that way. She has no idea what she is talking about.  My children's online school cost me nothing. They both got laptops, printers, mics, computer paper, books, the whole thing at a price of $0. If parents decide that actually want their own curriculum then yes it can get costly. But it is actually a choice.   Here comes the hard part. Convincing them that this is what you want.  Home schooling is not for everyone. You HAVE to be motivated to do it. If you are not motivated now, then home school is not for you.   Another hinderance is do your parents have time to stay home and home school you? Most of today's parents work jobs so it may be a burden to them to work an 8 hour day then come home and home school you which will create a more stressfull environment for both you are your parents.   No, she does not have to be a licensed teacher. I am not licensed teacher and it is working out just fine.  State mandated tests are done.  It does vary state to state so where I live might not be the same laws and regulations as where you are at.  My daughter completely begged me for weeks to homeschool due to the serious problems we were having at her school. I kept insisting that she should deal with it. WRONG. I finally sat down and talked to her and realized that what was going on in school was reflecting her grades.  Now, she is very happy and that is good.|`|bokx8Ac6aa	Well i am homeschooled now lol i was being preasured and teased and bullied confront ur mom and tell her u wanna be homechooled and talk about it to her gently my mother isnot a teacher either u get ur books and u test on them and everything im in 9th also i started homeschooling when i was in 7th grade and i love love homeschooling, im a christian homeschooler and if ur a christian i recomend life pac alpha omega on BJU (bob jones university) or becca but anyways , dont be scared to tell your mom it accually brough me and her together.wat u do is just research homeschool systems and u can go to meeting to get books HOPE I HELPED!!|`|R25FXd6Taa	i have been home schooled my whole life. i'm in 9th grade. one of the upsides to home school is that there is no pressure at all. your not being teased all the time. and you can still be with your friends just not all day every day.  hope i helped a little bit.|`|bkgBLjuvaa	go to this website.

There is a large variety of curricula available but what you can use depends on the laws where you live.  Start by checking your local laws. Then research the types of curriculum available in/for your area and find a local support group.

BLFduvnpaa	Positive attitude and make sure you socialize and make friends.  The way I made it through high school was finding a group of people I enjoyed hanging out with and just knowing that I'd be able to see them in school didn't make me dread going to school.     If you get to choose electives, make sure you take those you are positively interested in and not because your friends are taking it. As long you enjoy what you're doing, you'll be surprised to find yourself enjoying school.    And I don't think it's possible not to get mad (unless you're real good at controlling your emotions) because there are bound to be things that may upset you.

This was a landmark for representation by the people and would be later used to be a model for congress.    3 The mayflower compact was the first written goverment plan for the new world. Many of the passengers on the mayflower  knew that earlier settlements in the New World had failed due to a lack of government, and the Mayflower Compact was in essence a social contract in which the settlers consented to follow the rules and regulations of the government for the sake of survival. The government, in return, would derive its power from the consent of the governed.    4 The glorious revolution can be argued that James' overthrow began modern English parliamentary democracy; never again would the monarch hold absolute power. The deposition of the Catholic James II finally and firmly established Protestantism in England. Magna Carta was the most significant early influence on the long historical process that led to the rule of constitutional law today. Magna Carta was originally created because of disagreements between Pope Innocent III, King John and his English barons about the rights of the King. Magna Carta required the king to renounce certain rights, respect certain legal procedures and accept that the will of the king could be bound by law.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia    "The Revolution of 1688, commonly known as the Glorious Revolution was the overthrow of James II of England in 1688 by a union of Parliamentarians and the Dutch stadhouder William III of Orange-Nassau (William of Orange). It is sometimes called the Bloodless Revolution, although there was fighting and loss of life in Ireland and Scotland. Many modern historians prefer the term "Revolution of 1688", as "Glorious" or "Bloodless" reflect the biases of Whig historians. The Revolution is closely tied in with the events of the War of the Grand Alliance on the continent of Europe, and may be seen as the last successful invasion of England.[1] It can be argued that James' overthrow began modern English parliamentary democracy; never again would the monarch hold absolute power. The deposition of the Catholic James II finally and firmly established Protestantism in England."|`|57e2f4489b0f3ab7cf9ecd40140e8a77aa	The Virginia House of Burgesses was the first legislature in the colonies.

Dh0JX2Onaa	You certainly can increase your PSAT and ACT scores./    Information about PSAT help sites is below.|`|vxUoVi6saa	study|`|9202729d2797b335c2ba85914d0aba07aa	Actually, 150 is an average score, but it sounds like average is bad for you (I'm not demeaning you, I would be incredibly displeased with a 150, but I know a lot of people who've scored around there), especially since it appears that you must be strong in math.    I would definitely recommend you try to find a PSAT practice book. If you can't find one, then SAT books are just as beneficial, except the practice tests will be longer (The PSAT is like 2 hours, while the SAT is nearly 4) and the SAT includes a written essay. I recommend the Princeton Review's SAT book because they combine good material with humor, which is always good. Between now and next school year, read through the review sections and do the practice problems. When you sign up for the PSAT in your junior year, they give you a practice booklet--read through that and do the practice test!    As for increasing the 50 points, I can't say for sure that you will because it depends on a whole bunch of factors. It's definitely possible if you work at it. I did well on the PSAT my sophomore year (199..but I'm a seasoned test taker and I'm native) and brought my score up nearly 20 points my junior year (215), without serious practice. Both times, I just skimmed the booklet and did the practice test. If you take the initiative to study, you could definitely improve a lot more :).|`|JzkqLhq8aa	so i'm guessing you got a 56 on your math...  Just take a lot of practice tests  As many as you can get your hands on, go to the library, or just take those sample ones the school gives you  When you do your math, you can use little strategies such as plugging in the answers  For reading, just make sure you don't just read for the summary, but analyze as you read  Memorize one or two vocab words a day   IF you maintain your practicing and don't slack off, you should get up at least 30 points  Good luck
5KAreKDjaa	On the website (google them). Failing that ask your teacher. You're doing the right thing =) lots of exam papers are the best way to revise bar nothing!! Lol seriously it's the only way for me, reading through stuff I did in lesson is pointless because... I did it already! Mind you I don't have problems remembering things if you do then I suppose SOME looking back might help but exam papers all the way!! Look at the mark schemes, really study WHY you got something wrong that way, you'll NEVER get a similar thing wrong again. And questions you got right the first time you won't make mistakes in so essentially you can walk into the exam hall knowing that they could ask you any of the hundreds of questions that you've already done and you'd nail em all!  Best of luck =D

The TV and film program at UCLA admits only those students who have already completed at least 90 credit hours at UCLA with at least a 3.0 GPA. There are additional application requirements (essays and writing samples), but you're at least 3 or 4 years away from having to worry about being accepted to the TV and film program - first, you'll need to finish high school and gain acceptance to UCLA as a freshman.    UCLA looks most carefully at your 10th and 11th grade high school performance, and they report (on their website) what kinds of grades their admitted students have. The bad news for you is this - UCLA accepted less than 3% of applicants whose 10th and 11th grade GPA was between 3.00 and 3.29.    The vast majority of the students who were accepted by UCLA had a high school GPA between 3.70 and 4.00 - in fact, 84% of the students admitted in 2008 had a GPA of at least 3.70. In case you are wondering, this is the unweighted GPA - the GPA that is computed without adding any "extra" points for AP or honors courses. If you look at the weighted GPA, almost 92% of UCLA admittees have a GPA of 4.0 or higher.    You will also need some pretty high standardized test scores to have a good chance of admission. The SAT averages for admitted students were 651 reading, 682 math and 663 writing, and 1996 overall (combined total of the 3 sections). The ACT scores are also high. 82% of the admitted students have an SAT composite score of 1800 or better.    The good news is that you still have time to get your GPA up - but only the rest of this year, and all of your junior year (next year). UCLA is, indeed, one of the two or three most highly regarded TV and film programs in the US, but the entire institution is highly regarded - that means that the admissions process is extraordinarily competitive.    When the time comes, you'll be looking at some pretty hefty expenses, too. California residents can expect an annual cost of about $23-25,000 as undergrads, and the cost for non-California residents is almost double that. UCLA says that non-residents should anticipate paying $20,610 more per year than California residents.    I'm afraid this information was disappointing, but it gives you something to aim for. Good luck!|`|FaMAaWYtaa	1) They don't let you in on basis of money.  You can always take out student loans to pay for college.  2) Go to the ULCA website and look at their 'prospective students' section; it should have info about minimum GPA requirements.  3) start focusing on extracurricular activities that would appeal to this program.  For instance, start or join a film club at school, take a screenwriting class and make or write some short films, anything to make you stand out.
psmTrwT3aa	im doing it at A2 economics aqa. gcse  economics is pips compared to this. you can study hard and get good at economics that how i did it.  i was bad at the start because i didnt know how to use economic terminology because i didnt know what the words meant.  learn definitions  take your time reading it and make notes on what you don't get then ask your teacher to explain .don't rely on your teacher to teach you economics all the time alot of it you have to learn yourself....if you care about what you do.. the gcse economics isn't much harder than AS economics .|`|nyJhBJOXaa	that would be cheating, theyre not allowed to tell you anything    ask your techer for help or read the revision guide,,,just like everyone else has to do!!!

874ujY0laa	Hi, first thing you should know about cost is that one year university in France costs 300 to 500 euros max. For the whole year.   Quite different from the US on that level.     Living costs will depend on where you'd like to be: Paris ? South of France (Aix-Marseille)?  There are other cities with great universities, but I'm a Law student so i don't really know how good they are in French.     Paris universities are divided in faculties by number; for your subjects, Paris 3 is a top university and you will find the foreign students page there :  http://www.univ-paris3.fr/59012904/0/fic...    but you need to speak French to understand that !    living in Paris is quite expensive, a studio rent is about 400 to 600 euros a month depending on where you live.   If you are in an exchange program, you may obtain a room in your country's building at the Cit Universitaire, a very nice park where all the countries have a building to host their students in Paris.   But I know the place is hard to get.     If you need information, just ask by email the universities, but they usually have a "Guide de l'tudiant tranger" (foreign student guide)

7uedTD6Iaa	Many different companies have their own ways of leveling books.  Each company has a different system.  Some use letters and some use numbers.  Even all the ones that use numbers, the numbers all mean something different.  Here are some links to reading level comparison charts.  So those levels you listed could all mean something different depending on what level system they are coming from.  My best guess the level 16 is from the Rigby system, the 30 is from the DRA system, and the O is from the Guided Reading system.  Those are all about at the early 3rd grade reading level.    http://www.oema.net/lexiles/ReadingLevel...  http://library.springbranchisd.com/sbisd...  http://www.readinga-z.com/guided/correla...  http://www.dillon2.k12.sc.us/teachers/re...

FVFxE6owaa	That is usually the cost for one year.  However, it's only tuition.  You need to add in the cost of room and board, books, and any miscellaneous fees.      The cost of college increases each year so your sophomore year will cost more than your freshman year, your junior year will cost more than your sophomore year, and your senior year will cost more than your junior year.  However, there is financial aid.  Most people do not actually pay the "sticker cost" when they go to college.|`|wgFZGMEtaa	Tutition is generally done by year, sometimes by semester (which there is only 2, not 8).  Call the school to be sure, but I would bet it only costs 9,398 a year.      Ask yourself this... is it a state school (probably 9398 a year).  is it a small school (probably 9398 a year).|`|suu9JuhBaa	Ask the college itself. Find their site and e-mail them under contacts. This sounds really confusing (what you have written I mean).

cPVNGDefaa	Unless you want to take English in college I suggest either clep or take the English class because you have to have the AP exam to get full credit.  It will give you more time to focus on business, business is not English however they do not want an idiot that can not spell or punctuate property, business is so much math it is unreal.  Anyway like I said unless you want to be taking it in college those are your two options. If you do not pass the AP exam you might want to consider clep right after so everything is still fresh in your head.  All AP classes are is a larger amount of work in a the time period everyone else gets.  But you mentioned microeconomics and I'm taking that myself so work on those, they will be most challenging, after that English will be a walk in the park and you could always clep out.  http://www.collegeboard.com/student/test...|`|LRu1Zb5Saa	i was like you pilling up on AP classes... but don't kill yourself. you'll simply not get a college credit for it and take the class in college instead of high school. you already have alot of APs and its much better to take less and do better than to take a lot and fail them. ur health is much more important than an extra AP on your transcript trust me.|`|oLI2SJ08aa	AP Lit usually gets more college credit than AP Lang. At the Ivy Leagues, they may only accept AP Lit and not AP Lang. Look up the AP exam scores needed to get out of college classes at the schools you're interested in.    But not taking AP Lit won't hinder your ability to get into college. I took AP Lang, but not AP Lit and I got into a lot of places. Don't take more AP classes than you can handle. 5 is plenty.|`|hyHvG1Olaa	All the schools you have mentioned are excellent and it is my opinion that the question is not "will not taking the AP Literature hurt me" but rather "will not having the AP Literature experience hurt my college level work".  There is a lot of work in AP Literature but in the long run it can be worth it since it will expand your knowledge base and that can only help you in the university of your choice in the long run.  If you believe you do not have sufficient time to do the class justice then for your piece of mind you might not want to take the course.|`|oF4HDT5Zaa	never understood why taking APs were important. i'm in college, and took them in high school so that i didn't have to take some classes when i got here....but they didn't help one bit.  you might have a different experience, but that was just mine...|`|pOYauDr6aa	yes. your teacher will beat you|`|mCdaoFafaa	I don't think it will hurt you, but if you managed to get a 4 or 5, you might get credit for it in college.  You might want to see what AP classes are similar to the ones that need to be taken at the schools you are applying to, it might help you prioritize.  All of the AP's I got credit for only count as electives for me, which stinks because I have a minor and it just crowds things.  My friends who were in pre-med could have gotten credit for AP Bio but took it over in college since it is their major and they didn't want to forget the material or something...But 5 AP's sounds like quite a load already.  Whatever you think is best for you.
lQIKWXDuaa	The military will. I would say there are grants, scholarship, and loans. Go speak to someone an IT school like DeVry. You have the option of doing it on campus or online. If you ever move you dont have to worry about transfering. My bro just got his BA from them in IT and he has a job offer for 60K+.  So call them up. Speak to a financial advisor there. Also ask about on campus jobs for students. You can get your degree in about 2.8 years. DAMM this bad economy. Dont feel bad you are not alone in this mess.    ss
oKCJoF2Maa	You fill out your FASFA, you can do this online in about an hour or less.  This will tell you how much federal aid you will get (grants and loans).  Whatever you do... do not take out Sallie Mae loans, no matter what your school says.|`|e6cd7adee445aea5f559762dc3723ff4aa	If you want to get government aid, you could apply online for the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid).    As for loans from your college, you should contact their financial aid office directly (preferably by phone, or in person) and see what you might expect to receive once you apply.    Many colleges require that you fill out the FAFSA and that it be released to them so that they can evaluate any aid that they might give to you.

AA12021966	Some things that will make a college right for you:  1. Distance - how far from home are you comfortable going?  2. Size - do you prefer a large, small, or medium-sized college?  3. Religious affiliation - is a particular religious affiliation you want your college to be?  4. Major - Find out what major you want and find colleges with that major.  5. Cost - How much can your family afford? Don't worry about sticker price, but be aware of it.  6. Social life - Knowing this will probably require a campus visit or an overnight visit, but schedule it through the admissions office of the college.|`|mR50HEWDaa	Collegeboard.com is a great web site with extensive information.

jER0X5OPaa	A 25 is a good score. The national average is 21.1, and the highest state average is 23.6 (Massachusetts).    When you say "good enough", I'm assuming you're referring to getting into a [good] college. It ultimately comes down to what schools you want to get into. Check the websites of the schools you are interested in, they should tell you the percentiles of the previous years freshman class and their ACT scores.    Keep in mind that your ACT score is not the only thing colleges look at when considering your application. The other big factor is your grades. Some schools work on a sliding scale, which allow the your grades and ACT score to balance each other out if one is significantly higher/lower than the other.
wgFZGMEtaa	You need to be doing more extra curriculars that deal with math/science/engineering.  Try to get an internship somewhere (paid or not, it doesn't matter) in an engineering/math/science field.  Also, take the SAT II's for Math II and Physics, along with some others.  Take AP Calculus, AP Physics, AP Chemistry, AP Stats - basically, as many math and science AP's your schools have.  Other than that, just study for the SAT - over 2200 for MIT and CALTECH and pray!|`|6644da85d010d98c8e75bdddc3c55c49aa	You didn't say what you want to do.

(A wild guess would be probably $10,000, plus whatever loans you are eligible for).

mR50HEWDaa	Hmm, probably you would study Animal Behavior. Does this sound right?     "When you study animal behavior, youll consider what causes animals to act in certain ways. Was the animal born knowing the behavior, the way a spider knows how to spin a web, or did it learn the behavior from its parents, the way a canary learns to sing? The answers will allow you to examine the animals development over time and consider how it relates to other animals and its environment."    I think you should be a zoologist. They are scientists but instead of sitting in a lab studying genes and cells they are out in the world studying animals. A masters or higher in Zoology would be necessary.     Another similiar career is a  Wildlife Biologist.
cL0aHkYEaa	While Zen is not my personal practice, I happened to read--many, many years ago--a book by Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh.  In this book, he spoke about what you are talking about, and his solution was so simple--too simplistic, in mind--that I essentially discarded it.      But it must have found a niche somewhere in my consciousness, because over the years I have discovered that it is as simple as he described--so simple that it is literally like the flip of a switch--off, on; off; on.    It has to do with how to set one's attitude, and establish a practice of mindfulness.  Rather than paraphrase his work, I'll just include a couple of excerpts for your perusal:    "Resistance and resentment take root in us when we feel we are not being treated fairly.  When we are asked to do something we would rather not do, we hold our energy back from our work."    "So often when we are faced with difficult work, our minds put boundaries on what we can do, on what seems possible; anxiety and apprehension obstruct our efforts.  But when we care for our work, our involvement leads to freedom from limitations."    "Just by changing our attitude--going directly into our work--we find the joy of performing our tasks with excellence, of working without internal obstructions."    Hanh's consistent theme is that attitude is something very much under our control.  We in the West have trouble with that--we don't think our emotions are like a water faucet, where we can turn them on and off at will.  But we actually can...attitude is a function of mental process, not circumstances.    As you finish out the last three years of high school, do it for no one but yourself.  Don't do it for your parents, for the school's academic ego; do it just for yourself.  Regard your work as something magnificent to accomplish at the high level you have chosen.  Make each essay a thing of beauty, a toolage of word and turn of phrase that causes peoples' jaws to drop.  Master slope and line not because you have to, but because you can.  If you fill your time with wanting to do your work as well as you can, boredom will disappear.
Cc2Yb9DKaa	If you are talking about pecuniary inheritance (the disposal of income after death), the process works two ways:  1. The deceased provides instructions (carried out by an executor) that details how property is dispersed.    2. A governing body (usually the state in which the deceased resided) disposes of the income to sole heirs or closest heirs.    In both cases, litigants can contest (argue against the conditions of a will or disposal decision) under certain circumstances.    If you are talking about the biological function of inheritance (the passing of anatomical traits from parent to offspring), the process begins with sexual reproduction.  The process involves combining half the genetic material of one parent with half the genetic material of another parent.  Traits exhibited by both parents express a calculable chance for the offspring to exhibit similar or differing traits than the parents.  Scientists refer to this process of passing on traits to offspring as inheritance or heredity.
5Q8vMxuqaa	Chemistry number one, Physics would help. Biology, not that important but it wouldn't hurt to take it. Pre-calculus is excellent, Data Management would be pretty useful too. And yes, if our absolutely certain that you want to go into pharmacy then drop U.S History, it will not be of any use in that field what so ever. Analysis would help, yes, but it's not as important as Chemistry or Physics. Good luck, hope that helped :)|`|AA10198825	Physics is more necessary than A.P U.S History.

3mRKWJXpaa	Wow, that's a tough decision.    I personally love to hang out with guys  [less drama!] as well, so I would pick the co-ed school.  If everything but the actual campus is good, I think that would be a good choice.      And since it's small, it should be easier to know and interact with the people.  There's about 1,000 people per grade in my school, so it's hard to know everybody.      But good luck in deciding and going to your new school!!  =]|`|aJVTMHDPaa	ill go wherever the girls are. haha    cant live without them |`|CtwEFHcqaa	I would choose the co-ed school but that's just me.|`|rfwbZ2AXaa	I would go to the all girls school.

You could always meet up with boys outside of school|`|FGm3lluOaa	I would personally go to the co-ed school. It is much better to socialize with both girls and guys. Just my opinion though. If you are still having a tough time choosing, just listen to your heart!

There are no bad schools of pharm. They all teach basically the same thing, because all of their grads have to take the same national licensing exam. Any pharm school you can get into is a good pharm school.

PRzmwFfgaa	Why don't you put your question under lyrics?
H2V0Czq0aa	Yes, you can get in. If you had gotten excellent grades, colleges would be rolling out the red carpet for you, but that does not mean you cannot get in. There are so many "holes in the net". I hope this text box does not run out of room as I try to cover them!    The most likely way for you to get into the schools that you have listed is to get in on some type of scholarship. Many athletes get into schools this way with low GPAs. Even if you are not terribly athletic, there may be a sports team eager to recruit you. So ask!    You said that you are creative. Maybe they have arts scholarships or fellowships. Dancers and musicians often get in under special admission, the same way that athletes do.    Plus, you may get in with regular admission anyway, especially if you at least PASSED some of the basic classes like math and English.    Additionally, the university may calculate your GPA differently anyway. For instance, some schools only look at the classes that they require and may disregard classes like PE or the facts of life class, (which could be in your favor if you failed it!).    I know you do not want to go to community college. But, many schools will not even look at your high school GPA once you have so many college units. Thus you could just attend a community college, take some easy classes until you have enough credits to be considered a transfer student, then reapply with your higher GPA. WARNING: don't be tempted to overload to get out of there quicker.    To find out about the types of special admission that a school may offer, you should contact three people: 1) The recruitment officer, 2) the athletic director, and 3) the director of development for the college of the major you want.  Those three people will have all the inside scoops on any types of special programs.    Are you near the coast of Georgia or panhandle Florida? If your area has been declared a federal disaster zone due to a hurricane, there may be special admission. Many schools around the country, including mine in California, openly accepted students from areas stricken by any of the various big hurricanes from a few years ago.    Finally, the closest thing to getting your GPA up is to get your test scores up. Most universities place a great deal of weight on both GPA and test scores. Some like mine, have created a third type of score based on a formula that inputs your GPA as well as you score on the SAT or ACT. My point is that you have time to buckle down and study, study, study for this test. This will take some diligence and careful time planning on your part. There are books that can help you.    So remember, go to the university's website and find the staff directory. Call and write the people I mentioned and tell them what you have asked in your question. Then, study for the SAT and ACT (you only need one, but you never know which one you might score higher on). For a few hundred bucks you can even take a private class. Look into it, and I hope you get in!|`|e4755faeab1ce327b95c1129793886a7aa	It'd be tough to get into any of those schools.  I know you don't want to go to community college, but if you did and got good grades for a year or two, the colleges you did want to attend would be more willing to take you as a transfer than straight out of high school.|`|Oi8Oh6zHaa	I'm sorry to say, but getting into those schools with your GPA might be quite hard. Unless you were some super athlete, did tons of community service, and did really well on SATs. I suggest you go to community college, at least for a year. Your GPA will be completely fresh, and you can easily get a 3.0 or higher as long as you try. Have you concidered looking at other colleges too? Talk to your councler and see which schools you would be able to get in. Sometimes the schools you least expect you will like, you will love!

4545cc681203d442768cb8efc651ac38aa	If you've already learned something, then you won't take that class. In high school you get credits, and if you've already taken a class then you get credit for it. I.E. if you've already had Algebra 1 then you'll take Algebra 2 so don't worry about what you've learned...they will help you choose a schedule that fits you best.    I've done all 3---private, public, and homeschool. Public school was definitely the greatest time of my life. Private school was...well...hell on earth. They are very strict (at least at my school) and I had way too much work. I went to a rural public school and it was awesome. The teachers were nice and so were the people.    I'm not gonna lie, the kids do kind of think you're weird when you tell them you were homeschooled but once they get to know you they forget all about it. You can't be shy though. You have to be friendly and outgoing or they will think you're just some little sheltered homeschooled kid.|`|NiCI01g6aa	I would recommend going to a private school if you don't mind how much money it costs. Usually schools will give you the curriculum ahead of time if you ask and if your home schooled your probably ahead of your classes anyway. I go to a private school right now and I know tons of people who used to be home schooled in my school and they really like the experience of going to a real school and stuff. They also don't really find a problem with fitting in.     Hope I helped you at all.

So, since "the" is part of the name, it should always be capitalized.

4qCqj6q0aa	It's fine! Don't worry about it. I don't normally go to concerts and stuff, even if I really like the band. Lots of people don't like going to concerts and shows anyway - while it's exciting seeing the band live, it's a fact that bands don't sound as good in concert as they do on the album. Also, rock concerts are Really Loud!!! I went to one once and I wore earplugs and it still felt like the noise was shattering my eardrums.

Having "more ivy league roots" doesn't really mean anything. A "better alumni network" won't help you either, unless you have outstanding credentials. Penn is not "up and coming" because it's already one of the top schools in the world.     The bottom line is that both schools are academically quite challenging. If you do well, you will have great options from either school.    I think you're looking at the wrong factors.  Penn and CU are indeed different.  You should compare campus life, the surrounding neighborhood, the student culture, the quality of the dorms, etc.      Spend time at both schools and choose the one that has the best "vibe".

lHpR2Kcvaa	Last year, my best friend's brother was killed by a drunk man driving the wrong way on a one way regional route. The drunkard was driving at a 140 kilometres per hour.     Her brother tried to swerve to avoid his car. But it couldn't be done. The drunk guy kept going, and seeing him trying to turn his car, his stupid brain thought he should swerve too. So he did, and hit my friend's brother's car right on the back at a ferocius angle and speed.     The already banged up car crumpled. The brother was killed instantly. The friggin, retardedd drunk piece of sh1t survived.     My best friend, her family, and my family have never been same. Her brother did not deserve this. Her family did not deserve this.    Drunk driving needs to be stopped. It hurts the people who drink and the people they affect by drinking.|`|quYp2Ajtaa	There was a drunk driving in my area and it snowballed eventually causing three or four houses to burn down, and killed one man, injuring many others.

And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also."    Some people extrapolate that to mean that you should never "spill your seed on the ground" (ie, ejaculate outside of sex).|`|AA11202852	No, it isn't.|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	That depends entirely on the teaching of your particular religion.

mR50HEWDaa	No experince in those fields, I'm a science geek. But i can describe them.    Journalism: As a journalism major, you'll learn and practice the reporting, writing, and editing skills you'll need to cover the world. Reporting skills include researching background information and asking good questions in an interview. When it comes time to write your articles, you'll need to open with a lead that grabs the reader's attention and continue with sentences that are easy to understand. As an editor, you'll practice writing article headlines and photo captions.     Sportswriting: In keeping with these changes, sportswriting courses have branched out. You'll learn to write many kinds of articles, such as athlete profiles and investigative reports. You'll probably also write a number of columns that discuss current trends or the week's events. Writing columns, you'll have the chance to experiment with style and develop an individual voice. And since many classes work with the campus newspaper, you might even see your articles on school sports in print.    Broadcasting: How does broadcasting differ from print? For one thing, you'll have to learn about the technology that makes it possible. In radio, that means using equipment to record and edit sound.     In radio courses, you'll learn to think creatively about the world of sound.  If you study TV, you might be required to try your hand at every production job before specializing in one area. You'll do everything from operating a camera to producing a broadcast.    Public relations: Whether intended to win votes, sell products, or side-step criticism, public relations is all about persuasion. If you study PR, you'll learn how to use indirect methods to win public opinion. These include everything from press releases to special events, all meant to generate free publicity.

Iwk92vqyaa	There are offices set up in the U.S. to 'recruit' people to join a branch of the military; air force, navy, army.The military personnel in such offices tell those who are interested all they offer by joining: various training in various fields (flying, diving, shooting, cooking; quite a lot). 'Recruiters' do this.    'Recruiters' also help people find new jobs by interviewing them, identifying their strengths in the work-world, and giving them leads (addresses, phone numbers) to follow and apply for work.    The word 'recruit' means: "1. a fresh, new supply; 2. a newcomer to a field of activity; 3. a newly enlisted or drafted member of the armed forces; 4. a former enlisted man of the lowest rank in the army."     'Recruiter' is the noun form of the verb above (and below), followed by four definitions, from a Merriam-Webster Dictionary, 11th edition.    More there, under 'recruit' also as a verb:  "1. to fill up the number of (as in REINFORCE); 2. to enlst as a member of an armed service, or, to increase or maintain the number of 3. to secure the services of (jobs), or, to seek to enroll (schools) 4. to restore or increase the health, vigor"|`|k4W9bqLLaa	A recruiter is someone engaging in recruitment, which is the solicitation of individuals to fill jobs or positions within any group, such as a corporation or sports team. Recruiters can be divided into two groups; those working internally for one organization, and those working for multiple clients in a third-party broker relationship, sometimes called headhunters or agency recruiters.      Internal recruiters may be multi-functional, serving in an HR generalist role (negotiating, hiring, firing, exit interviews, employee disputes, contracts, benefits, recruiting, etc.) or in a specific role focusing all their time on the activity of recruiting. They can be permanent employees or hired as contractors for this purpose    A third party recruiter acts as an independent contact between their client companies and the candidates they recruit for a position

BUXhsFZHaa	The first piece of advice is to NOT listen to your boyfriend and to make up your own mind.  The second piece of advice is for you to make your own informed decision by meeting women from each sorority and not going on other people's opinions.  If you join a sorority, you will be sisters for life.  No one else knows you as well as you know yourself!  Your school only has 15 sororities; look at their individual web sites and get a feel for each one.   It looks like the two sororities with the longest history at your school are Alpha Phi and Alpha Delta Pi; I'm assuming this based on their chapter names (Zeta chapter and Eta chapter).  Pi Beta Phi names their chapters by state but most others go in alphabetical order so a chapter with two names like chapter Alpha Gamma, mean it's a younger chapter at Bama than the single named ones.  That doesn't mean they're the best sororities, just that they have been around the longest.    Register for recruitment, either formal or informal, and make your own informed decision!

	Im a med student at imperial college, no-one in my year did philosophy A-level. Philosophy is seen as a soft option, if you're doing it as an extra side A-level i.e. you have 3 or 4 other solid A-levels then theres no problem.     Hmmm.. yes you definitely need the bio and chem at A2, but if you would take maths at A2, not just to AS, you would be more free to pick an extra subject you enjoy, anything really apart from sport science, media, IT, psychology or R.E. (soft options).    I took 4 A2s maths, bio, chem, phys and an Advanced Extensino award in phys and bio. Take into account I'm giving info based on you applying for top med schools in the UK. Other unis are less strict, (but still avoid soft options).

If the cause of your low GPA was due to extraordinary circumstances (parents drowned fleeing revolutionaries, you assumed responsibility for your 12 siblings by starting a bakery and working 15 hours a day 7 days a week, which is why you only have a 2.5- - - that sort of thing).  It sounds, however, that the reason you have a low GPA is that you didn't try that hard, and now you've woken up and are starting to work.  If that's the case, don't even bother with Standford.  It'll be a waste of money.    USC MAY give you a chance.

The National Curriculum in schools hasn't worked so the answer is more of the same, try to force 3 year olds to do literacy and don't let the older ones leave school until they're 18.

I'm pretty sure it is standard for most schools to check grades after your senior year, so my guess is that Cal Poly is either the same or the exception, depending on the standards for entrance. A school with higher standards will expect you to maintain your grades through your senior year, a school with lower standards might not care as much (depending on the drop and the standards).

Plus, as a freshman, you wouldn't be able to apply now, unless you've already taken and passed things such as the SAT/ACT, etc.  Colleges simply won't accept you.  Trust me, unless she is going to guarantee you an A for applying, it is not worth the 50-100$ per application (even then, it isn't worth it).|`|C4WlEbIOaa	You can't apply for college until you are a senior.  They won't let you! I think your teacher is on crack or something.    Maybe she means apply to get their viewbooks??  ask her to clarify.

	I can't tell you what I do, but:  If you think about the world and the absolute worst case scenerios, there are some jobs that will always be needed and pay decent.     Get into the Medical field. Most states will pay your tuition and even GIVE you money for taking nursing because the demand is so high. Your local employment office can give you some ideas and even offer free training for the fileds your state is in need of. Here in TN and GA, nursing, truck drivers and linesmen are highly needed so they will pay for courses.    Medical is always going to be needed no matter what happens to the world or the economy.

xuEQWcJmaa	Well, first of all, after you've submitted your FAFSA, the Student Aid office at UCLA will send you a letter containing information about your eligibility and award status. Your loan eligibility is set according to your enrollment status-- it's more for grad students than undergrads. Here's the part I think is important for you, though: if you find that you aren't making it, you can borrow more during the course of the year, up to the amount defined in your award letter.    If I were you, I'd wait until I see the award letter before I try to plan how much I'm going to borrow. There are so many variables, like how much your rent will be, how much you will be earning, whether you will have a car, etc, that it will be hard to determine how much you need to borrow. Student Aid advisors at UCLA will be happy to help you sort some of this out, once you have been accepted there.|`|lVkaALbOaa	oh that's seems hard little bit how can you're parents don't want to pay for you?|`|wgFZGMEtaa	I would first start with grants and scholarships... apply for the Cal Grant (assuming you are a CA resident) and the FAFSA.

LOve helps to|`|iuhs7Zjcaa	How to say this....  Depends on the reason for the low income.  Many people who are low income are that way for a reason.  Either low education, low intelligence level, health problems, or too many family obligations.  Actually, almost all low income people have health problems of some sort.  Being low income means low nutrition, less sleep, less rest in general.  The reason for that is having to do extra work to try to make up for the low income and even that generally does not make enough.  Two parents working 2 minimum wage jobs still can not climb out of low income level.  Child care is very expensive.  The more the low income person works the less assistance they get,  Pretty much, you can't win for losing.    I was middle class then crisis hit.  I have been/seen both sides of this problem.  I am disabled, I was a single mom from the time (my husband died) my son was ten.   I was fortunate that my only son was  17 when I became disabled.  If I had to try to help him with homework in my present condition, it would be impossible.  If I had been a divorcee, I would not have had the resources I had, with widows benefits, as I had been a part time worker so I could pay more attention to my son and not put him in childcare.  I did not have work background to make enough to support him, and pay for the house etc, even though I had the education.  <br>  This is a problem that will always occur until understanding is improved.  Understanding of the low income position and the roadblocks.  The anger, apathy, and cynical attitude you probably have come up against, is due to promises to help that  don't come through, or that end up taking away something else.  The offense taken at one more person  adding one more insult.  When you are low income, you are not just low on money, but low in society, low in self esteem.  If you notice in the media, online forums etc, the only time low income people are mentioned, it is with disdain of how they are raping the system.  I have seen the system from both sides and the "system" is very spotty and inadequate.  Also low income people have to be constantly on guard, in this society to keep their children from being taken away.  They have no funds for attorneys.  No funds for taxis, car repairs, buses often do not go to their areas, or close enough.  From Pres. Clinton administration on to current, benefits have been reduced or changed where they "appear" on the surface to be there to help but trying to qualify is very difficult.  This includes medical.  One dollar over and all of a sudden you don't qualify for the medical benefits necessary to keep going, or for a preexisting condition of yourself or a child.  Like section 8 housing...if you have health conditions you can qualify but not continue to qualify as they do inspections, and if it is not clean enough or some other problem, then you get removed from the system.  Poof!  Instantly homeless, with more debt.  If you are health challenged you are not going to be able to keep it clean enough, especially if you have kids.  In essence, these people do  not have the time, energy, health or education of their own to do this.  Maybe free daycare at the school with free tutoring at school would help but I am sure the price of the "free" would probably not really be "free".  Nothing ever is.<br>  Sorry to be so long winded.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Having books in the house has been shown to be a contributing factor to the students success in school, much more of a factor than the parent actually reading to the kid.  There were programs set up in states a few years ago to send kids at least one book a year.  That's not much, but it would be interesting to see how much of a difference it made - my parents always had hundreds of books around, but I know some people from low-income families that don't have any books in the house.  Even if we can't get the parents themselves interested, we can get around it by reaching out to the kids.|`|JOncNt6qaa	Alot of the upper classes don't really  aswell, you know.

AA10176626	Tyrha:<br>  <br>  These are excellent questions, and now is definitely the right time to be asking them. Let's see what I can do to help.<br>  <br>  First of all, there's good news if you are an outstanding student.<br>  <br>  Washington State has an "assured admission program" for all state residents who either rank in the top 10% of their graduating class or who have a cumulative, unweighted Grade Point Average of 3.5.  If you're not sure what an "unweighted" GPA refers to, this is the GPA that is calculated without awarding any "extra" points for AP or honors courses. An "A" is worth 4 points, and a "B" is worth three, regardless of whether those grades were earned in Basic Math Skills or Calculus AB.<br>  <br>  If you qualify for that Assured Admission Program, you must still take either the SAT or the ACT test (state rules), but there is no minimum score that you must achieve. If you meet the Top 10% or the GPA requirement, you're "in", regardless of your standardized test score.<br>  <br>  If you will not qualify for admission as part of that Assured Program, you are in for a little bit of competition, as WSU is considered a "more selective" university. <br>  <br>  WSU uses an admissions system known as "rolling admissions", which simply means that applications are considered as they are received. The "priority" date for applications is January 31st each year, so if you want to maximize your chance for admission, you'll need to make sure that you have submitted the application and all required supporting documents before that date.<br>  <br>  WSU requires that all applicants have completed a fairly rigorous high school curriculum that will prepare students for college work. These requirements include:<br>  <br>  4 years of English, including at least 3 of composition and literature<br>  1 year each of algebra, advanced algebra and geometry<br>  2 years of science (at least two years of physics, chemistry or biology)<br>  2 years of the same foreign language (or sign language)<br>  3 years of social sciences (psychology, sociology, etc)<br>  1 year of fine, visual or performing arts (or another year of 1 of the above)<br>  <br>  The more AP or honors courses you have had, the better, and your courses are reviewed to see if those grades came from "tough" classes like anatomy and physiology, rather than "office aide".<br>  <br>  You must also provide a personal statement essay - the school says those are carefully evaluated as part of the admissions process.<br>  <br>  A profile of the 2007-08 freshman class showed that the average high school GPA of accepted students was 3.42. There is no minimum required SAT or ACT score, but if you look at the SAT scores and ACT scores of the students who were accepted, you can get some idea of what it might take to qualify.<br>  <br>  It can be a little hard to get a feeling for if you haven't had a lot of statistics, but this kind of data is usually presented in terms of "the middle 50%". The middle 50% tells you a great deal of what the "average" person looks like, because it ignores the top 25% who were extraordinary, and the bottom 25%, who were extraordinary in their own way. The middle 50% of ACT scores were between 20 and 26, and the middle 50% of SAT scores were between 510 and 610 math and 490 and 600 critical reading.<br>  <br>  WSU has a fine undergraduate psychology program, and a good graduate program, too.<br>  <br>  You can't apply until your senior year, because the school only considers applications one year at a time. The class you want admission to will open for applications in January 2010.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!

	Although the word is used in the same sense and with the same meaning as regardless -- it is a word -- it you are correct. It is uneducated and grammatically incorrect. I believe that is it a portmanteau of "regardless" and "irrespective", maybe coined to make one sound a little more intelligent; however, it has the opposite effect.  Many sources list it as a word in its own right, labelling it as colloquial or nonstandard; the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) regards it as incorrect.|`|	you're right!|`|	Well is gardless a word?

1RXOjaryaa	If I were THIS student? I'd probably be outraged that you would dare question me. He seems to be a real JERK! He deserves no consideration from you, but if you have further contact with him, it may help to clearly advise him to contact you privately with specific requests without disturbing everyone else if he needs assistance.    You are well within your rights as a professional. Others are paying good money and don't care to be interrupted by such foolishness. This punk hasn't realized that he's not in high school anymore.    If I were you, I'd secretly contact the dean and tell him that a student is on the brink of getting removed from your class and why. This guy problem has probably already started telling the dean his side of the story.|`|aqto0hJTaa	I corrected some errors.  I hope that doesn't offend you.    Your behavior in the class have been disruptive to the positive learning environment I strive to create.  You have made judgmental and personal (not factual) comments repeatedly in the class. Comments such as "not professional" (regarding the syllabus), and "you are not making sense" in the middle of my speaking and teaching before I could even finish illustrating fully do not serve constructive learning purpose.  These types of comments only show that you are disrespectful with the possible intention of sabotaging the class. Therefore, I need to stop these behaviors quickly.    I am protective of my students and wish them the best for their academic endeavors; for this reason, I will keep this initial warning between you and me. However, I will send the dean Dr. soandso a copy of my syllabus, in case there is a future need for us to talk about the professionalism of my syllabus with a third party involved.  Until then, I reserve the right to remove a student with highly disruptive behaviors.    I hope we can continue in class together.

You state that the student is texting in comments because the format is online. Well, just as email tone is hard to read, so is text message. Perhaps your student does not understand that s/he is coming across as obnoxious and know-it-all. But your email comes across as very condescending, and it will not do anything to improve the rapport between you and this student. It should be approached more as an interaction between two adults, which you are, regardless of how much you view this student as a disrespectful nuisance.  -You stated you would rather do a face-to-face conversation, & that's not possible, so why not a call? Or how about sending an email, requesting the student call your office between the hours of x and y?   -Typing anything in caps gives the connotation that the writer is screaming. ("NOW' looks like you are screaming.)  -"Sabotage the class"? I doubt your student is purposefully trying to do that. As someone else stated, over the top.  -Sending a copy to the dean? How would you feel if your student communicated with the dean about your actions in class and your poor teaching technique? I don't think you would appreciate that - it would make it look like the student is trying to get you in trouble or starting some petty drama, wouldn't it? It does the same for you - it makes you look petty, as if you can't handle things on your own. Don't forward your email to the Dean! You'll look silly if you threaten that.|`|AA11826766	in you're attempt at being direct, you're coming off as being defensive. i personally got that you're tired of him being an asshole and that he needs to stop! however, i think you meant to tell him as much as you appreciate his input, the way he let's his concerns be know is in a disruptive way that you feel disrespectful to yourself and the rest of the class.
8qyofB7Zaa	They're both similar degrees, and yes you could major in computer science and still get a "software engineering" job. The difference in my opinion is largely a marketing phenomenon. Computer science degrees are more "traditional" and all universities have them, but some universities also market software engineering degrees as a more "prestigious" version CS (at least that's what my university does).     But there are concrete differences. First, CS degrees are broader and offer more flexibility, but usually have less required technical courses. SE is more specific and most of your courses are chosen for you. I looked at the link you provided which had checklists:    https://www.cs.drexel.edu/static/undergr...  https://www.cs.drexel.edu/static/undergr...     - the CS Bachelor of Science program is organized as a "liberal arts" type program where you have requirements like "Freshman English", "Writing and Communication Electives", etc. I didn't look at the BA program but it probably has more arts requirements. The SE program has less of those requirements, and has a specific order in which you take courses.     Second, SE programs are focused specifically on the "software engineering" aspects which is a subfield of computer science. This deals with the various stages of the software design process like testing, requirements specification, etc. which is why you see courses like "Software Specifications and Design I, II" and "Software Verification and Validation", etc. CS is usually more focused on algorithms, theory, mathematical aspects. In your program CS majors have to choose 2 out of 9 "tracks" like "Algorithms and Data Structures", "Computer Graphics", etc. I don't really like this as it prevents you from taking a breadth of courses, but it still seems more flexible than SE. It doesn't list any "SE" labeled courses however so it may be that CS majors can't take those "SE" courses, I don't know.    Third, at least in Canada SE majors are considered "professional engineers" unlike CS, but graduates have to do 2 years of "engineering" work and from what I heard most SE grads don't pursue the professional engineering designation. That might be similar in the US, I'm not sure.    In summary, look at both course lists and see which one you like - the SE might be better if you're pretty confident in an IT career or hate arts distribution requirements. CS might be better if you're thinking of double majoring or possibly ending up in another major or applying computer skills to another field (CS/SE majors don't have to make software itself, they can work in other industries which use software to solve problems). From my experience, most employers don't care if you have an SE or CS degree.|`|lQIKWXDuaa	Why not major in both?     ss|`|vNnvpLKBaa	Engineering is always best. If you still think not, then I suggest information systems.    and yes you can still get a job as a S.E, but you'd have to have experience, that's going to depend on the employer    Buenas Suerte

TCxsjZN9aa	there are tons of them; most dont know where to look or how to get them. there are government loans & grants, and there are private loans & scholarships.    i dont know your details, so i'll just list them all for you. i know its a lot, but take your time and pick through ALL of them. the more you find, the more you get.    try to aim for grants/scholarships more... they are not to be paid back. its confusing sometimes, but just keep applying. Scholarships usually have a 1 or 2 page application, and require an essay. Take your time with the essay, so yours stands out.    every big (and small) company you see (manufacturer, orgs, corps and groups also) all have grants and scholarships they hand out like candy. Walmart, Kmart, Target, Coke, computer companies etc etc etc    heres a link with a HUGE amount of some available. some you will need to copy and paste into a new window. also, fastweb (take the time to fill it in) will search databases and get back to you with a list of scholarships you qualify for.    Also contact all mens, womens associations in your state, they almost always have grants & scholarships. What ever field you are going into, contact the orgs, associations etc for them; Also check with professional organizations related to your career interests, such as the American Bar Association or the American Medical Association. they also always have scholarships. Research and dig, call then write. Its all worth it.    OVER apply; it doesnt hurt to have too many, and the extra funds can help with housing.

I find it hard to remember things when I'm listening to music though, but its easier for me if I focus entirely on studying and just zoom out the music. Or somewhat.    Try asking somebody to quiz you, and if you do well, than that means listening to music is good for you. But if you don't want to take a risk, you can turn the music off.    Good luck on your exams!

Carrying on with history would probably be more productive.  Try and get as many A-A*'s as you can because Law is really competitive...   Make sure you do really well in all your subjects and maybe try and organize yourself some work experience in a law-realated environment when you're a bit older.  Good luck!!|`|1b3b5278059cfd8ccb786f9def0bc096aa	GCSE subjects shouldn't matter, just make sure you obtain a good grade in Maths english and a language.

Most employers that state this are generally worried because of your level above the job they are hiring for, you will become easily bored and end up leaving. The idea for any employer is to hire someone capable but not overqualified so they become a good, steady employee. It costs them more to go through the hiring process again than to hire who they are looking for and have them stay a long period of time at the company.   (For instance, if you have a few years experience in sales or catering than hiring you at McDonald's would be hiring someone over qualified for the basic starting position. You should be looking to move up.)|`|5JFG5W4uaa	Lindo W...it literally means you are to knowledgeable for the position you are applying for and probably too expense to keep.

I took the SAT once junior year, and got about 2100 - basically anything over 2000 is what you want to really aim for.|`|pmN86odLaa	Yesss, I would say that a 1750 is very good for a freshman in high school =) .  You'll probably show an upward trend as the years progress.

IK8VW4FZaa	I am 35 and wish the internet existed back then in the way it does now.  Even 10 years ago the internet wasn't useful for much other than e-mail, browsing and instant messaging.  Then along came high speed internet.  It took a few years to get the infrastructure in place.  Now we can have free access to practically any song ever recorded, every book ever written and every TV show or movie ever made.  You don't even need a TV or radio any more as this is all available on the internet and with much more variety.  Trips to the library and my father's purchase of expensive encyclopedias is no  longer needed as we have things like Google, Wikipedia and Yahoo! Answers.  You need to research a project or in search of information about something you may be having trouble with, just point and click.  You have a spell checker, you can convert from imperial to metric, you have an unlimited source of book reports to refer to.  I even hear that students are e-mailing their teachers when they have a question.  It sure beats standing in line for 20 minutes to ask the question as I did when I was in high school.  Students of this generation are very lucky to have such an amazing learning tool at their finger tips.  With the internet there is really no good excuse for bad grades.

You have to learn from your  mistakes because nobody's perfect. You have to  laugh, love, and live every day like it's your last.  - Mary-Kate Olsen     The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.

There is an inner beauty about a woman who believes in herself, who knows she is capable of anything that she puts her mind to. There is a beauty in the strength and determination of a woman who follows her own path, who isn't thrown off by obstacles along the way.

1G98ilX2aa	Don't take this offensively, but, if you are at a large school- she probably has hundreds of students, and has no idea who you are.  The only way you can make an impression with most of you advisers is to schedule appointments every few months and discuss your future, etc.  Bring problems to their attention, ask questions, etc.  Don't schedule appointments weekly or randomly drop by unannounced without any questions, these both are very annoying for advisers (believe me, I know)- it shows that you do not respect their time enough to make an appointment, and by doing that you are taking time away from their busy schedule.    The best way to build a relationship with an adviser is to ask for help when registering for courses and seeking advise when you are looking into majors or areas of concentration.
uf9pZFlzaa	It makes sense to take it twice in a row, but only if you think you'll improve on the second one. You'll get your May scores back by the middle of May, so you could sign up for both and decide whether you want to take the June SAT after you see how well you do in May. Hope this helps!

rOlQK4c2aa	it's pretty cool. I attend school in Singapore, but one of my friends goes to school in USA (Purdue University, if you have heard of it) and he seems to like it. He likes his roommate as well, which is something I feel is very important in a college education. The best part is the diversity. Especially in the United States, there are people of every ethnicity in every school. My friend's roommate is Indian, as are some of his friends. All in all, as long as you keep up with your work, college is great!
OCgZACJqaa	To be honest, I don't think any of them are anything to write home about.  They are all out for themselves, once they are voted in they do exactly what they want to do.    The amount of money they give themselves is absolutely disgusting.    What our country needs is someone who will stand up and say 'enough is enough'.  Build a prison on Dartmoor exactly like the 'prisoner of war camps in the 2nd world war', and send all 'yobbos' there, that means anyone carrying knives, robbing people, beating people up, in fact doing anything that breaks the law., then forget about them, no television, no sports etc, just wooden bunks and a little fire stove in the corner and give them a bag of rations once a week to cook themselves.     Give the child abusers and  child murderers to the neighbours where the child lived and when they are finished with them, hang them.     Make sure the N.H.S is properly supported and have more nurses than administrators, get rid of the hangers on.     And finally, remember the old saying 'Charity begins at home' get our own country sorted out first before starting on another.    Some people will think I am harsh but like I say 'enough is enough'.

lHK5q2xlaa	For a job interview I assume you mean?  Be clean, neat, dressed appropriately and sober(Avoid over indulging the night before.)  Be friendly but not crude, flirty or inappropriate.  Try to relax, the interviewer is a person, honestly.    THE MOST IMPORTANT PART: RESEARCH THE JOB ON OFFER AND THE COMPANY OFFERING IT.  Have all the right information, make sure you sell yourself to them. Be honest about your experience and current capabilities if you need training in some areas. There is nothing wrong with train-ability.     But make sure the employer is left with the strong impression that you are eager, adaptable and willing. As well as unafraid of hard graft.    Don't be arrogant. You are not the only candidate, listen when critiscism or advice are offered and be willing to be tutored.    Good luck.
AA10648678	In 9th grade, you start the transition to become a responsible teen. You will be held to higher standards, but not without a little help first.

It's even worse in a reccession. I guess you could try to get some sort of training. Or maybe you could be a Life Coach.     From Collegeboard: The study of philosophy provides students with a broad range of skills in writing and critical thinking, which are valuable in a variety of careers, such as writing, journalism, and publishing. Furthermore, since philosophy emphasizes criticism and analysis, it provides skills that are sought after in careers requiring analytical abilities. Even those students who have only a bachelor's degree in philosophy find that their undergraduate work can make them attractive candidates for management consulting and finance-related work, although having a graduate degree is often desirable. Another common path for people with a degree in philosophy is law school.|`|As1pBao0aa	You can think deep thoughts about being unemployed.
02hcNMxKaa	It's just a joke, sort of saying that you have the very beginning of a great plan and the very end of a great plan without having any idea of what the plan itself really is!    Like: "Okay, I've got it!  I'm going to start a business and become a billionaire!!"  "Really?  What kind of business will it be?  How will it make money?"  "Um... um... well, I don't have all of the details yet... but it begins with me starting a business and ends with me becoming a billionaire!!"    In essence, it's just a lot of hot air.  What good is a plan if you don't have the important details?  Okay, you'll start by buying a dog and somehow end with making a profit... but what's the connection?  It's just funny.  Maybe it comes from blowhard business types that have huge plans and always talk big without ever being able to follow through.    (P.S. Do you ever watch South Park?  There's an episode where gnomes sneak into the kids' bedrooms and steal their underwear.  When the kids ask why they're doing it, the gnomes answer that Step 1 is to steal underwear and Step 3 is to make money.  The kids ask what Step 2 is, and the gnomes are kind of taken aback and realize that they really have no idea how stealing underwear is going to make them money.)

I am pretty sure that if you dont do a sport that you can still get into college because thats not only what they are looking at. They are also looking at your classes you took and at what level (for example did you challenge yourself) and then there is the community service, the leaderships skill, you personalitity, your grades, ect., ect. Also, the chance of someone getting a sport scholorship in under 10%. Anyways, the anwser to your questionis no just make sure that you do have extra-cirricular activies. Start attending clubs at your school, or even sign up for a sport

Versuch es doch mal mit Online - Kriminalit?t, da gibt der Markt noch jede Menge her, aber auch hier gilt: Illegal! Nicht tun, Pfui BaBa! Und überhaupt Verbrechen zahlt sich nicht aus, Du k?nntest nie wieder den freundlichen Schutzmann an der n?chsten Strassenecke grüssen, ohne ein schlechtes Gewissen zu haben. Auch k?nntest Du nicht mehr bewundern wie Derrick und Co. die Verbrecher überführen, Du stehst dann ja auf der Gegenseite. Bedenke dies alles gründlich und solltest Du dann immer noch an Deinen Plan festhalten, dann wende dich ganz konspirativ an Deinen lokalen Mafiapaten, der kann Dir weitaus professioneller helfen als die YC - Community.|`|mCncWn2maa	Psst, ich hab hier noch ne 9mm Knall...<br>  Ich fahre den Fluchtwagen und "steh" Schmiere xD<br>  Für die Geiseln genügt ein Eimer, ist ja schlie?lich kein Hotelaufenthalt.|`|r1Ozg6FEaa	Also ehrlich, ich finde diese Frage "unter der Gürtellinie".

dx3jXzuxaa	The word Patriarch means father. A patriarchal society is one in which the mantle of leadership-- of family or country -- passes from the fathers to sons. In the Elizabethan age, noble houses were patriarchal, so the fathers arranged or prohibited marriages, and doled out inheritances and dowries. In Macbeth, the crown passes from the father/king to the son/prince.<br>  <br>  Patriarchal issues figure prominently in many of Shakespeare's plays and creates the conflict in several of them. Consider Midsummer Night's Dream, Taming of the Shrew, and Much Ado About Nothing. (We recently did a production of Much Ado with the role of Leonato played by a woman. It was quite interesting to switch this around.) <br>  <br>  The only way for Macbeth to become king is to kill his father, thus the motivation for regicide of Duncan. The only way for Banquo to beget kings is for one of his sons to overthrow or usurp from Macbeth. Thus Malcom becomes the first of this line, which eventually produces James I of England.
DaokQBKhaa	When you draw a line of best fit through points on a scattergram, and the line goes from top of y axis down to the x asis, this is a negative correlation. For it to be significant, the points will be very closely based on or just off the line of best fit.<br>  <br>  Sorry mate, wrote this before you added the additional details. I have no clue then!
mYEqj3YGaa	The hyenas, Tymon and Pumbaa depicted the worst and best of uncivilised groups.  The hyenas displayed the worst because though they worked in a group, there was no real "leader", they had no set of rules to follow.  Their lack of organization caused the near starvation of the entire pride near the end of the movie; and they ultimately turned on scar. <br>  <br>  Tymon and Pumba, while being uncivilised, brought Simba into their tiny little fold, in which he grew up learning to survive, based on what they taught him.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mufaasa and the pride were definitely good depictions of being civilised because they had a heirarchy in place and everyone had a function within the pride.  Scar, however, showed how a society can break down due to power struggle and a departure from the code of law that society sets.

uFJy7qakaa	Facts:<br>  <br>  The Alps comprise about 180 mountains, from 1200m to 4800m high. <br>  The division of Western Alps and Eastern Alps is along the line from Lake Constance along the Rhine to Lake Como. <br>  Mont Blanc (4810 m) is the highest peak in the Western Alps, while Piz Bernina (4052 m) is the highest peak in the Eastern Alps. Mont Blanc is also the highest peak in Europe. <br>  Matterhorn is a popular mountain in the Alps. It is shaped like a pyramid and considered tougher to ascent than Mount Blanc because of its steepness and regular avalanches. <br>  Mont Blanc was first ascended by two natives, Jacques Belmat and Dr. Packard, on August 8, 1786. They stayed there for half an hour, with the thermometer several degrees below the freezing point. <br>  On the Alps vine grows to the elevation of 1,600 feet. Below 1000 feet, figs, oranges and olives grow. <br>  Oak grows to 3,800 feet, limit of the chestnut is 2,800 feet, of pine 6,500 feet, and of furze 9,700 feet. Beyond 8,200 feet snow exists perpetually. <br>  Lauterbrunnen region in the Alps abounds with falls, the most remarkable of which is the Staubbach. It falls over the Balm precipice in from the stunning height of 925 feet. Rainbows dance up and down it. <br>  The biggest city in the Alps is Grenoble. The city has about 500,000 inhabitants. The city has the nickname 'The Capital City of Alps'. <br>  Innsbruck in Austria is the second biggest city of the alpine arch. <br>  The Alps are not an impassable barrier and have been traversed for several purposes. <br>  Switzerland is famous the world over for its Alpine scenery. It offers lots of opportunities for tourists like trekking, mountaineering, skiing as well as other adventure sports and winter sports. <br>  Austrian Alps have the world's largest accessible caves in the world. These enormous caves, adorned with frozen stalagmites, are located in the proximity of Werfen. <br>  <br>  For the equipments, I found these sites<br>  <a href="http://www.bizrate.com/mountainclimbinggear/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bizrate.com/mountainclimbingg...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.indoorclimbing.com/Equipment.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.indoorclimbing.com/Equipment....</a><br>  <br>  Hope I Helped & Good luck :]
