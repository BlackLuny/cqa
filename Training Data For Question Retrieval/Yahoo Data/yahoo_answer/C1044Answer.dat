iWcTmuhAaa	I agree, and now I give you a lot other reasons,<br>  <br>  In 2000-2004 WWF had a great Tag Team division, we had Team 3D, Brothers Of Destruction, Hardy Boys, Edge and Christan, APA, Billy and Road Dogg e.t.c ----------- no there is not even a single good Tag Team left. ****** At that time we had great technical wrestlers like Chris Benoit, Lance Storm, William Regal, Eddie Guerrero e.t.c --------- now we just have Chris Jericho. ****** In those days we had real fighting divas action but now women division is just a joke.|`|d9tCS7BPaa	I agree that there will never be another Rock or Stone Cold. But I wouldn't go so far to say that the WWE is dying. They still have amazing ratings and product sales.<br>  <br>  True, the WWE would do much better if they had a star whose popularity was as high as the Rock or SCSA. But wrestlers like those are very rare. As far as charisma goes, the closest ones are John Cena and Randy Orton.|`|ODogL6A5aa	YES EXACTLY!|`|4THkC6Pgaa	yep, can't argue with you there|`|7ImGw976aa	A lot of things in different ways are kind of making it 'die'. 'Dying' is a bit of a harsh word for it, it's just slipping downhill from what it was.<br>  The PG era is making it go down that slippery slide even more because storylines have gotten boring and not much is aloud anymore in storylines and matches. Even certain moves have been banned now because they don't think their safe enough, yet they were fine for years before.<br>  They also lost so many of the wrestlers and the replacements haven't been living up to standards. Plus it's sometimes like they really are trying to replace certain wrestlers and, of course, you can't really replace the old one's because they were one of a kind characters that can't really get mimicked. Plus the one's they have had for a long time that were good have been watered down and not been able to do half the things they used too, making them very boring.<br>  Plus also watching John Cena winning belts and getting everything all the time, over and over again, is beyond boring and predictable.|`|KVTW6mCzaa	I totally agree. Except, Orton is the future and so is Edge. Edge won his first world title on January 8th 2006 so he has a lot of reigns left. THESE ARE THE TWO BIGGEST HEELS OF THE LAST 2 DECADES!|`|Ts7dXcpTaa	wwe is dying because its all drama and no action now|`|GJ9z6K1Baa	WWE is actually gettin good again..if u still bitching about how its bad..tough titty cuz u wont get the attitude era back..<br>  <br>  and i loved attitude era but its too overhyped and gettin a bit overrated|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	I don't see how they made Batista the next Stone Cold or John Cena the next Rock. they are the current biggest stars but they aren't based on other former stars, i can't think of any examples to support your claim other than being the big faces of there time which is a link you have made not the company. Stone Cold wasn't the next Bret Hart or Hulk Hogan they where just themself. The WWE makes stars out of the talent they have, if John Cena is loved by kids and women make him superman and if Jericho barely gets a reaction being a cheeky face turn him heel and let him show of his masterful skills with a mic that way. The WWE play the cards they are delt to make them self money, the comparisons to the past are made by us. We all see the WWE is on an upturn but they always step up on the road to wrestlemania, we will see if the company is dying over the summer. Last summer was carried by Jericho/HBK and Edge/Undertaker, if you watch just for wrestling it's not dying it's improving but as an entertainment product it is slipping.|`|3G2kI3Vqaa	do your research WWE is not dying, people have been saying that since promotion first started in the 1960's that is would not last.  They has been around a lot longer than most of you have been alive.  They are not going anywhere.

I tolerate wrestling cuz my boys (6 and 8) like it, and there are actually a FEW impressive athletes here and there in wrestling (Angle, Haas, Benjamin, Punk, RVD, etc.) If someone's a big wrestling fan, they'd prob. choose WrestleMania. I agree that sometimes UFC main events tend to be disappointingly short; but that's cuz mma is REAL and wwe is SCRIPTED. Plus, the undercard fights in mma events are usually much more worth the money than anything comparable on a wwe ppv. Also remember that, at least half the time w/ the main storylines on a wretling ppv- there's NOTHING resolved- cuz it's just a chapter in an ongoing storyline. So if anything, you're left with more questions than answers; not to mention you're now about $50 poorer. When a UFC event (for example) is over- there's no "fallout" the next night on UFC Unleashed. The fight happened, it's over; onto the next card. Doesn't it get annoying paying $50 a month to watch the same few steroid-pumped, otherwise athletically talentless bodybuilders (Cena, Batista, etc.) pretend to fight each other over and over again? Admittedly- i'll prob. end up ordering Mania- cuz my kids wanna watch it, and WrestleMania is only once a year, and it's the only wwe ppv actually worth paying for (just my opinion). But if it was the same weekend as say, the upcoming UFC 100: w/ Lesnar v. Mir to unify the HvyWt. Title, St. Pierre v. Alves for the Welterweight title, and Penn v. Florian for the LtWt. title (and that's just so far- the whole card hasn't even been released yet!)... then I'd be like- "sorry kids- Dad's watching something more important tonight... love you, goodnight." Don't see how this is a tough choice; but to each his own...|`|ETkqlgqwaa	Wrestlemania. It's just bigger and better.

rv6zl5t3aa	As of right now? No way. I see them out vs the Pens in the first round. This is not the same team that played before the All-star break. They used to play with heart, toughness and everyone played on both ends of the ice. This team now seems listless, uninspired and lacking on the basic ffundamentalsthat got them to where they are.<br>  <br>  They need to get back to "Bruins" hockey. They need to Hit, play on both ends of the ice, HIT, play a FULL 60 minutes, not 15min in each period, HIT, get back to making chances happen instead of waiting for them to happen......oh and did i mention they need to start to HIT AND TAKE THE BODY MORE!!!! They need to play a little more physical, because, YES, they will flame out in the first round if they continue to play like this.|`|FZletnaxaa	I actually happen to be a bruins fan and they are a really good tean, Plus so what they are slipping a little they have been #1 since the beginning. The Bruins are a really good that has always been under estimated. And, on the other hand the teams that are tied for eighth, or are close at the eighth place. They suck and have been doing bad for a long time. Their overall record is really good. Last year, they were in last place barely made it. They were the cinderella story of the Montreal series in the first round they lost in seven games to The Canadiens, but they made it really far, compared to what alot of those dumb experts were saying.And, to answer your question they will make it far into the playoffs. In fact, they will carry the cup over their shoulders.

dqxW1W0eaa	I do just in case it gets weak from the sun and pullin in all them big bream from the lake weakens it a bit too !|`|KJWxqQHiaa	I do every year. I don't do it more than a year and i think that a good line can hold up more than a year. But, you can't be too sure. I just get a couple spools of line at the local Wal-Mart, bring them home, and change them. I have a hell of a lot of reels to fill with new line, too.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out.|`|q8dX0MsNaa	yes. it get damaged by rocks, sticks, sun. replace it each year and drop off the used line at a shop that will recycle it.|`|icgvxHb6aa	Yes before every season change your line.<br>  <br>  it will make you feel better when you change your line<br>  <br>  and it will help you pull in your fish|`|BK1GjPT6aa	Yes you should but it really depends on how you store your rod and reel, the amount of use you put it through and believe it or not, the amount of sun the line gets per fishing trip.  For example, I put 12 # test line on my son's reel 2 months back. Just this past Sunday he lost 2 really good fish because the line just popped out of no where.  I take very good care of my gear but the line is under a lot of stress ( especially when I fish.) The line get's 8 hours + of sun 2-4 times a week and so all the elements just take it's toll.I also have another system sitting in my closet and it rarely see's the light of day and that line is just as new as the day I bought it. That was 8 months ago and the system has been used only 4 times in that time. <br>  So the reality of it all is not changing the line per season but the amount of use it goes through. Take a Bass pro for instance, they change their line after each tourney...I would too if 50 grand + were on the line. A simple way to test your line is to attach the tag end to a scale ( have some one hold the scale and gauge it) as you step back a few yards and pull with the rod. Tighten down the drag and pull. If the line pops before it reaches it's pound test, change the line or risk losing that fish of a lifetime. You should do this every 2-3 months( weekly if you fish a lot) and you should be fine. ~good luck catchin'.|`|SEpHGcnKaa	Its a good idea to. <br>  <br>  The sun, sticks, rocks, etc can damage line pretty bad and cause it to break in an instant when you're fighting that fish of a lifetime.<br>  <br>  I change mine every six months on the dot. I'm not a redfish tournament angler, so I don't change line every six weeks (I don't break off that often either)|`|eUbldFuOaa	wow, I go through line faster than all of you it sounds like.<br>  I'm always changing lures up (different types throughout a day) and that seems to eat up my line, but I dont mind because I think it should be switched out often, due to what was mentioned above : sun, abrasions, stress, etc. You dont want to lose any fish, it's a bummer.<br>  N.K.O.T.D.<br>  <br>  price of line: $15<br>  not losing your biggest catch : priceless|`|wxEqpMrEaa	I generally change my line 2 times a year. I don't get too many line breaks. When I do, I change the line, and like I said, that's about twice a year.|`|79366fe7ba342f158b20c761ff8b4203aa	YES. atleast. I change mine about every 6 weeks or so. but I fish alot and can't afford to have break offs.|`|TBAfpnmgaa	I would recommend it. The price of a little line is pretty cheap insurance against losing a fish.|`|0NSax0u9aa	Yes. Also depending on the type of fishing your doing you may need to do it more often.|`|OBh7uEd1aa	i am now broke,, off 2 good stripers yesturday on  top waters ,,first hits in 3 weekends,,out two rattle trapson tree tops|`|ZP65s9BXaa	that depends on how you store your rods and reels,<br>  if you kept them in a storage compartment free from dust and light, I would say no, otherwise, yes, change your line, and oil your reels|`|7royFhIgaa	I change mine at least once a year if not twice.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	I do. . .

6ecdc0fb70eb839a2a22e77ecfde44e4aa	I answered this question to a fed fan a couple of days ago and I am going to give the same answer to you. Roger is not only having a problem playing Rafa, he is also having a problem playing in the earlier rounds of a grand slam like he almost lost to Berdych in the second round at AO not to mention Andy Murray earlier in the year at Dubai.<br>  <br>  I think this is one of the best decisions taken by him lately at this stage of his career. Darren Cahill is a good coach because he is not a yes man. It is time for somebody to tell Roger about the hard truths of his game, no matter how good he is, and I am glad that one person is Cahill. He can clearly help Rogi with some strategies in dealing with Rafa and Andy Murray. Roger' s game cannot grow if there is nobody to contradict him. Sometimes, people like Roger need a devil's advocate around them to flip the coin and see what's on the other side of the coin. Some of the facts coming out of Cahill's mouth may hurt Roger but it is going to benefit him in the long run. Also, Roger has done well under Australian coaches like Peter Carter and Tony Roche and may be this time an Australian coach can help him turn things around again. <br>  <br>  As far as the #1 ranking goes, Roger will have to do good at the smaller events besides doing good at grandslams. He seems to have lost an interest in the smaller events. Secondly, he participates in fewer events as compared to Rafa and Djoko so he needs a good winning percentage in the events he is participating. It is hard, but not impossible. Also, expecting overnight results would be ridiculous so we have to wait and see how this thing works out. All the best to Rogi!|`|pYieTvDqaa	I agree with the poster "yup_cool." Cahill is not the sort of coach to get his fantastic salary and cater to Roger's every will. He is very hands on and can get into Roger's head and make him see what he's doing wrong. I've felt for the longest time that Federer made a mistake becoming coachless, it worked for a while, but the game of tennis is constantly evolving and their are these young, hot players coming up and are ready to challenge the great Federer. If he wants to get back to the top he has to take a new approach. Cahill commented allot during Roger's matches at the Aussie Open and every sort of suggestion or comment he made was absolutely spot on and that's why I think he will be good for Federer. Cahill can make Roger listen and show him allot of fantastic tactics and new things to add to his already brilliant game. Cahill can guide Roger over the Nadal hump and back to number 1 and get him the Sampras grandslam record.|`|CnNAOoWgaa	There have only been a few points separating Roger and Rafa in their last 2 grand slam meetings.  In Australia, if Roger had converted one of six break points in the 3rd, he would probably have won the match.  At Wimbledon, it was down to just a few points in the 5th set.  In others words, there's very little to choose between them, just a few points here and there.  A good coach like Cahill can make a difference when it comes to those few points.  What Cahill needs to teach Roger is PATIENCE and DISCIPLINE.  Roger has been rushing too much, running around his backhand at the wrong times, and going for low percentage winners when he should be waiting for a better opportunity.  If Cahill can teach Roger more patience and discipline, I think Roger could still turn the tables on Rafa on all surfaces except for clay.  Roger has to stop beating himself by being too impatient which plays right into Rafa's hands.|`|3q8LkLLDaa	i think roger need just simply accept the fact that rafa is the best man and his empire is gone for good!|`|uWYlumvsaa	Anything new that can help Roger's game would be greatly appreciated, I'm sure, but as for regaining the No. 1 ranking, it will be difficult, considering the fact Nadal has no intentions of giving it back to Roger to keep. Nadal has played tremendously well, and he deserves to enjoy his run at No. 1.<br>  <br>  For Roger to make a run at No. 1 again, a few things would have to happen. Nadal would have to probably sustain a bad injury, keeping him out for weeks, or even months. Or, he would have to convert back to the Federer of old, and dominate men's tennis, which would mean, finding a solution to consistently beat Nadal, Djokovic, and definitely Andy Murray. <br>  <br>  Roger can have success again, but his days of dominating are all but gone, with all the new young guns moving their way up the rankings. To be honest, I don't think Federer will ever figure out a way, mentally and physically, to take down Nadal. Rafael has proven himself to be the stronger player now, and I see no letdowns in sight. <br>  <br>  If I were Roger, I would just focus on going out there and having fun, and not worrying about his ranking anymore. Whatever happens, happens. He'll win his share of events. He has nothing to prove anymore, as he's already proven his status as probably the best to have ever played this game.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|AA11218682	Yes because i think his only problems against rafa are strategic and having limited tactical creativity

Here's what I mean:<br>  <br>  -Name. "Las Vegas Chippendale" dancers. Or, even worse, "Mark Cuban's Las Vegas Show Dogs, Presented by The Vegas Palms Casino"<br>  <br>  -Logo. Again, something just as stupid to go along with a terrible name.<br>  <br>  -Colors. I'm just envisioning pink flamingos and palm trees, something similar to the Jamaican team from Mighty Ducks 2.<br>  <br>  Basically, I envision a marketing nightmare that mars the sport. And if Bettman gets the right price, it could happen. . .|`|8t5vPDnqaa	The NHL (as with the other three major professional sports leagues) has strong anti-gambling policies, prohibiting their personnel from having any involvement in gambling. The NFL (arguably the best-run professional sports league) has taken the toughest stance, even refusing to accept Las Vegas tourism advertising for Super Bowl telecasts and threatening to file suit against any local hotels holding Super Bowl parties (okay that's a little extreme).  A problem?  Maybe, maybe not.<br>  <br>  Sure, LV has over 2 million people.  But LV has a large percentage of residents working in 24-hour occupations, many of whom work nights and weekends when most games would be played.  Of course not everyone works in those industries but a large portion does.  So not neceessarily a problem.<br>  <br>  LV has waaaay more "other" entertainment options than most other NHL cities.  And a lot of those options can be quite cheap too.  A problem?  Possibly, but not necessarily.<br>  <br>  Put them all together, along with the notion of bringing yet another team in southern US, it just doesn't make that much sense, especially considering there are other viable options that DON'T have the above to deal with.|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	I asked this question last night.. Bob Loblaw can give you the best answer.<br>  <br>  Oh sorry, I was completely against the NHL going to Vegas just because I don't like seeing the NHL expanding into the Southwest, watching the Phoenix Coyotes on TV is dreadful to see such a depressing arena full of fans that are rooting for the other team. But once I found out that there was a team relocating I'm all for it.|`|yHvh7tFlaa	What I find even MORE appalling is people who DON'T live here thinking they know everything that is going on here!<br>  <br>  First-Most people who have moved here in the last 20 years are NOT from northern cities. According to DMV records, most transplants are from So. Cal., followed by Texas, Arizona, and Utah. Those hockey fans form So Cal already have loyalties to the Kings or Ducks. That is why the "Frozen Fury" exhibition game featuring the Kings and AVs sells out. Plus, it is only ONCE per year.<br>  <br>  I agree that many think that everyone works in gaming industry. I co-own a UPS store and my wife is a teacher, both FAR,FAR, AWAY form The Strip. ANd we rarely gamble. I do bet on college footbal at a "locals" casino.<br>  As far as only tourists will go, it has merit. Most of the people who live here and don't work on The Strip rarely go there, unless friends from out-of-town come in. Why? Because WE don't want to deal with the  tourists. Let them gawk at everything and get excited about winning 10 bucks on a slot machine. We have our own places to go, far away from any tourists.  <br>  Plus, ever been to The Strip on a Fri. or Sat night? Or when a big fight is in town? Super Bowl? Takes over an hour to go from one end to another. Now add an additional 5-10K cars. <br>  <br>  No arena in the near future- Everything that you have heard about an arena being built has been put on hold. All that has been done so far is a ground-breaking ceremony for the Aeg-backed arena, which is supposed to be built behind The Strip, which is actually located in Clark County, not Las Vegas. Las Vegas wants to build it's own arena on some old Union Pacific property they purchased years ago closer to downtown. This would actually be a better location, with better access to highways, but money is, as always, the problem. Plus, they want a commitment before it's built. Politics,politics<br>  <br>  Gambling- Not an issue. Casinos don't derive much income form hockey betting anyway. Plus Canada has Pro-line. As far as players doing it, teams probably won't have long enough lay-overs to actually have time to gamble, as they would have a road trip involving Phoenix, LA, and Anaheim.  If a player does gamble, then it si on him to be responsible.<br>  <br>  Population- With unemployment approaching 10%, due to downturn in housing and tourism( double-digit decrease in tourists visiting for 6 straight months), people are leaving Las Vegas area to look for work. I had to lay off 2 people in my store, and the county is expected to layoff 1,000 teachers next year due to budget cuts.<br>  <br>  I could keep going, but it is already too long. Do I want a team here? Yes, but not an expansion team, despite what Bruckheimer wants. He will also have to pay a territorial fee to LA. Not sure about Anaheim and Phoenix. I know Las Vegas is in their TV territories as well as LA.  A relocated team might stand a chance.<br>  Do I think it is a good idea? Not right now. Should wait at least 5 years with the economy the way it is. Many aren't going to be able to afford NHL ticket prices for a while.<br>  <br>  ** That's all you could find to pick on, semantics?** I must have done OK then.  Did you even bother to read it, or just stop at the first thing you could find you didn't like?  I actually agreed with you on some points, if you had taken  the time.  You asked for reasons NOT to have, didn't you?|`|SfTWwm97aa	Well I would have to base my opinion off cities like Atlanta, Nashville, and Phoenix. Hockey just hasn't caught on that big in those cities... and I think the western town of Las Vegas getting a hockey team would have the same result. You would think that if they were going to get a major sports team, it would be Baseball, Football, or Basketball WAY before it would be hockey.|`|4lyAGOkbaa	Vegas works... <br>  if you cant see it then you should get your head checked out.<br>  <br>  but NO EXPANSION!<br>  <br>  either CONTRACTION and moving teams or just moving a team|`|2iuZdBXraa	40 degrees celsius/104 degrees farhenheit and hockey do not mix.|`|UoUaO52taa	Vegas could but with all do respect it's not worth another expansion continuing to dillude the talent.

2C8Kjj78aa	I've been in all three places in this triangle -- player, parent and coach.  Fortunately for me as far as life lessons go, my parents were minimally involved with my athletic endeavors, all the way through college.  (Life in the very early days of Title IX... things are very different now.)  <br>  <br>  I started coaching when my kids were very young and were ending up on teams with coaches who had no idea what they were doing.  I am an education junkie and went to tons of seminars to make myself a better coach, and to make sure I was teaching the games properly.  What I have learned over the years is that my personal interest in being educated is very rare.<br>  <br>  I have also been the parent of an athlete who was not getting the playing time I felt she deserved.  When my daughter would complain to me -- and this started in junior high -- I would tell her that it was between her and her coach.  I would not get involved until the situation had gone unresolved for a while.  <br>  <br>  I've also been the coach of a player who just was not getting the job done.  I run a lot of drills in practice that generate scores, and when I was coaching juniors club and high school, I would post most of those scores so that the kids had a quick picture of who was performing to the expected level, and who was not.  <br>  <br>  There were objections to my posting the scores -- mostly by the players on the bottom of the ranking, and their parents.  There would be accusations of bias, but I made sure that the things that were scored were transparent.  Such as -- Serve 30 times, 10 to zone 1, 10 to zone 5 and 10 to zone 3.  You get 2 points for hitting the zone, 1 point for being within 5 feet of the zone (including serves that were long or wide), 0 for just getting it over, and -1 for serving into the net.  The max score for that particular drill is 60.  So a player who complained that she never got to serve would get pointed to the scoresheet that showed she consistently got less than 10 points in that drill.  I would do one or two scoring drills every practice.<br>  <br>  I took the team I'm coaching now to an intense 2-day tournament over this last weekend.  There was one guy who got very little playing time, but I did manage to stick him in the game every so often.  I feel that players learn in practice, but they really develop in match play, so I try to get everyone in.  When I was coaching juniors club teams, I kept track for myself of everyone's playing time; I know parents put out big bucks to have their kids play for me, and I wanted to make sure they got on the court at some point.  But some players made it very hard for me to play them due to their attitude in practice.  <br>  <br>  I recommend that your daughter make an appointment to talk with the coach before or after practice some time soon.  I believe that before is best because your daughter can put the coaches tips into play immediately, and start showing she can make a contribution to the team.  She needs to ask, "What can I do to get more playing time?"  And I think she should say, "It's very difficult for me to sit on the sidelines for an entire tournament when I want to help the team win."  <br>  <br>  As a parent, I know how frustrating it is to watch your kid sit on the sidelines, but as a coach I know how frustrating it is to work with some kids on the same stuff over and over and have them not get it.  If your daughter feels, after she has a private conversation with the coach, that she needs you to talk as well, then make another appointment.<br>  <br>  It is within your rights as a parent of a player for that club to have a conversation with the club director, though.  You are forking over money, after all.  It's too bad your daughter's coach hasn't talked with her directly already.  I used to make a point of talking to the non-regulars a lot just to keep them motivated and developing as the season went on.  It's a looooonnnng season, and it's hard on everyone when bad feelings go deep so early.  <br>  <br>  I hope you are able to work this out.|`|34ikhhtMaa	I hate to say it but Welcome to highschool sports! I am on JV Basketball and Varsity track, and the coach only plays who is good. In varsity track it can  be very hard to get an envent if there are girls who are faster. It is better for your daughter to learn now how hard the sports world is than later! I am a beliver in that only the best should play.|`|faOBk7qtaa	I am sorry to hear that about your daughter, I am a coach and I am constantly faced with the problem of trying to get everyone a good amount of play time, it is very difficult. Parents always think their children are better than they actually are, and I understand that as I would think the same about my child.<br>  <br>  Players in my opinion do not get better in games, they get better in practice, perhaps your daughter isnt performing good enough at practice? A game is just a place to practice what you have learned in practice.<br>  <br>  Have your daughter talk to the coach and ask him/her specifically, "what do I need to do in order to get more play time". Do not talk to the coach yourself. A player should be able to handle their own playtime on their own. And as a coach I do not like discussing playtime with parents.<br>  <br>  I have to give the coach the benefit of the doubt here as I am also a coach, but there are a lot of bad coaches out there, i know, but there are even worse parents....|`|k1oL5aS7aa	Confront the coach definately. Your daughter is probably wondering why she is sitting out so much. As a coach, they should not be concerned (completely) about winning. I would understand if your daughter had played in the first 2 matches and had made the same amount of repeated mistakes during those matches and sat out in the second. However, sitting out all three matches is redicious if you ask me. <br>  <br>  In my league, it is required that if a girl sits out for the first match, they must start the second match and play around at least once sometime throughout the game. I'm not sure what league you're in but you could probably look up a rule book online or you may have gotten one when you registered and see if there is some type of rule violation involved that the refs haven't caught. <br>  <br>  I have played volleyball for 4 years and I am currently 5'1" so I know what its like to be stuck in back row, but really I think it is better for shorter players like myself. I was not too excited at first but I really learned to play my position (middle back as a defensive specalist) and I love it now. <br>  <br>  What you should do is confront the coach. It sounds like he/she is being a bit too concerned about winning for the team's own good. And you're right, you paid too much money to have your daughter NOT play. Club is expensive, especially with travel tourneys, so I can totally see why you are frustrated. Read your last paragraph. This is what I would say to the coach. They need to know your concerns and you have another point too. If everyone could improve, the only way is to actually get out there and play! I'd suggest talking face to face with the coach and your daughter. Have her tell her point of view as well as yours. <br>  <br>  If there is still no improvement, contact the league's director. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|orWQYU70aa	well i bet my mom would understand ur point of you...well from the clubs that i have been playing for they have told me that i have to take responsiblility for myself and i would recommend that you tell your daughter to go up to the coach and ask him/her what she needs to do to improve so that she can get more playing time....ummm and if that doesn't work then u need to arrange a meeting with the coach but be respectful...ummm what happened to me when i asked was that the coach told me what to improve on and told me how to do it then when i did what i she asked of me i now start and play all around<br>  <br>  ** umm a bit of advice dont get so frustrated about the people on the court making all the mistakes and stuff like that just try to put on a happy face...and dont worry about....i know its hard and everything... but ya gotta deal... :) good luck with that one..|`|EXArkmVWaa	prolly cuz she's su cks|`|naGvti9Laa	I have been in your shoes, kind of? I have played volleyball since i was 13 and all the way up through college. And now I am also a coach. I used to be that player... Talk to your daughter and see how she feels about her playing time, and why she thinks the coach isnt playng her. Sometimes this is a result of practicing poorly. I used to have a player on one of my teams that was soooo good, she had so much potential, but had the worst attitude, and because of it we had to make n example of her to the rest of the team by actually benching her a couple games to get our point across. Of course her parents were furious with me for this decision, but at the same time they had no clue that their daughter was behaving poorly in practice towards the other players and the coaches as well. Im not saying that this is the case with your daughter, but just check with her to see how she is doing in practice. Also, if i were you i wouldn't say anything to the coach, maybe talk to the club director, if it becomes too much of an issue. Good Luck! and tell her not to give up just to keep giving 100% and the coaches will eventually notice!|`|085ceb5bb7c326a63e32a1f2eb169f02aa	I agree with eqaddix.  I coach and I hear it all the time.  I am not trying to say that the coach is right in this situation and you are wrong.  <br>  Unfortunately, you did not pay for playing time in matches.  The money you pay goes for practice time.  And practice is where your daughter will improve.  I can only try to tweak errors in matches.  I can work on correcting the errors.  You can not correct things in the matches.  No one is guaranteed playing time in the matches.  Since I have a local team, I try to get everyone playing all the time any way.  The top team in the club is trying to win at all costs.  The players on my team that only play half the way around think they should be playing all the way around.  The ones that do not serve think they should serve.  I have several people with suggestions on how to do my lineups.  Since I was coaching before many of their parents were born, I have not incorporated many ideas from my team.  <br>  Obviously, the coach sees something that you do not see.  I can not say what it is.  It could be attitude.  It could be that the coach thinks your daughter makes more mistakes than the others.  <br>  Have your daughter talk with the coach away from practice.  Have her ask what she needs to do to get more playing time.  And then write down everything the coach says.  And make sure she is not rolling her eyes or any other body language that shows that she does not plan to do anything the coach suggests.  Asking the coach during the matches will only hurt things.  When I am coaching, I am trying to pay attention to the other team and how I could make changes to what we are doing to change that trend.  I do not need players asking if they can go in.  I know who is on the bench and why.  <br>  Obviously, you will not like this.  You said that the team winning was not as important as your daughter playing.  That attitude is dangerous.  And if your daughter gets that attitude from you, she will never get off the bench.  The team is the MOST important thing.  Not the playing time of your daughter.  It really sounds like you have already had your daughter unofficially quit the team.  Since you do not want to travel 4 hours and spend hotel money, she should just go ahead and have her quit now.  <br>  You will either need to change your attitude and suggest your daughter work harder in practice or you should have her quit now.  You will not help the team if you keep on the team with that attitude.

rEhCPxcMaa	You are losing badly as usual. Until nz cricket hardens the f*** up they will always be pretty ordinary.

jBXutMblaa	It sucks to say it, but the Caps.

Another team which may have some trouble is the Carolina Hurricanes but Ward has proven himself in the play-offs before.
fC64C0diaa	I really like czs. I have a RAMI and it is reliable and accurate. I have shot both the 75 and SP-01. Of the two I (personal opinion) like the curved grip of the SP-01 better. Its on my 'wish list'.|`|JXMVNEQoaa	I own a cz 452 lux .22 lr and i have no complaints, great arms manufacturer.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	The CZ-75 has long been regarded as the best development of the classic Browning Hi-Power design, according to the gun magazines I've read over the years.  I don't know about the SP-01, but if it's a CZ, it can't be too bad.  It probably costs more than I'd like to pay, but I'm a cheap SOB.|`|v6vSrcgvaa	I don't own one, but I've done quite a bit of research on these pistols since I'm considering purchasing one as well.  The CZ's are pretty much universally praised as extremely accurate, durable, and reliable weapons.  They also feature a relatively slim grip compared to other high-capacity handguns.  The 75-series are relatively heavy, which makes recoil control easier, and the SP-01 is slightly heavier still due to it's integral accessory rail.  They are also very inexpensive for such a high-quality firearm.  This design has spawned numerous clones, such as the Tanfoglio EAA Witness, Armalite AR24, and the Magnum Research "Baby Eagle" (also known in Israel as the Jericho 941 and used by their military).  This is without a doubt one of the best handgun designs ever, and underrated in the western world due to it's unavailability during the Cold War (made in Czechoslovakia, now the Czech Republic).|`|YrxLbfiIaa	About CZ USA specifically or a particular model of CZ gun?.....<br>  <br>  I own 1 CZ rifle and can say there products are excellent and exceeded my expectations......... Generally I prefer firearms made in USA and only bought a CZ because they were the only ones that had a model I wanted....<br>  <br>  I have no opinion on the SP-01 but if its of the same quality as there other products I am sure you will be happy......<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWk4i3OfPfg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWk4i3OfP...</a>|`|XnZvlYXWaa	I personally own 2 CZ 75Bs. (liked the first one so much that I went back and bought a second) and a CZ 527 Varmint rifle in .223.  I really am impressed with both models.  The rifle is far more accurate than I am.  (which may not be saying much!!) I have shot over 8,000 rounds through my pistol without a single hiccup (other than the break-in period).  It is a smooth shooting pistol.  I would recommend them to anyone considering the purchase of one.  Just my two cents....
EgLdNAusaa	He's awsome baby, he's a PTPer.<br>  Dick Vitale is a good commentator, knows the game, and is a motivational superstar for young people.

0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	It's really a waste and this is a big scam to anyone who does it. We know LeBron has a chance with the Knicks but still this much money is just horrible to donate for a "pro athlete". I know these guys do a lot but they do not deserve 30 million or whatever they are getting. Really, I think this isn't going to a cause and that the Knicks fans are wasting there money and time.|`|38f16af5e5fc1e44e0b50a5058b0ad41aa	With the economy where it is, should these people really be using their money to try to get an athlete to play for their favorite team.
XuGFt3boaa	It'll be Cosby and Guerin.  Those two are really starting to play some good hockey now.|`|e3hVn0LZaa	I think Nash and Richards will get more points. Nash is doing well and Richards is doing pretty well and they both are at home for most of the games and both teams have been doing well at home. Crosby and Guerin have been doing well but i don't think it will continue. and Staal isn't getting more points than the other two people IMO.|`|EkiwqHsfaa	Nash <br>  Ovechkin
hDpGeYtBaa	nooo. it's because the boy has more muscle than the girl. muscle sinks in water.|`|eq2mljChaa	No, this has nothing to do with being "smart" or not. The reason is probably because of the difference between muscle mass and body mass etc. Don't worry about it. Also, try taking a really huge deep breath before you float (fill your lungs with air) and then float. keeping air in your lungs helps people float better.|`|UHPnMlgPaa	I don't think it is a matter of intelligence. At all.
Pp3WHtSFaa	I would take your $650 and buy a Quality AR15 lower reciever and start building from there. You should have enough to build a high quality mil spec lower and have about half what you need to buy a complete upper. Once you're done you will have a phenominal rifle that will seriously out perform the AK.Not too mention there is talk about banning military spec ammunition which means no more ammo for the AK while the .223 will never be banned. There are so many bolt action 223's out there it's not funny. The 5.56mm will surely disappear though. So get all the M855 and M193 Steel Penatrators you can while it's still legal to buy<br>  <br>  The ruger Mini-14 is a cheap alternative to the AK and it is fairly accurate. They make lots of add-ons/upgrades for it too.|`|hPFltfxoaa	I would look on gunbroker for a WASR if you want an economical AK.  They are going for a little less than the Saiga you mentioned and they are able to accept different stock and forearms.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	In the current market, that may be as good a deal as you're likely to get.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	That rifle isn't worth that but that's the price they are getting these days.....<br>  <br>  Consider a Ruger Mini 14 and / or the Ruger Mini 30 rifle.... These are American made, easy to use, are decently accurate, polite looking and fun to shoot......<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ruger-firearms.com/Firearms/FAProdView?model=5843&return=Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.ruger-firearms.com/Firearms/F...</a>|`|wbhqShh6aa	Yes its over priced, but its as cheap as you are probably going to find these days...I own a lot of 7.62 AKs and they are all great.  I have never owned any AK in .223 but I have heard that some of those have problems.  Of  course some AKs also come in 5.45x39 and they are great guns, but no American companies are making that caliber at this time that I know of, so it could be risky buying a gun that you have to rely on imported ammo, especially in today's climate.  Saigas are not the best AKs, but these days you got to get what is available before they are all gone.|`|fUDlbOP0aa	650 dollars!!? omg, I nearly ordered that back in November for half that. And I'm in California!<br>  that's unbelievably expensive. well my wasr10 (ak47) finally came back in stock and shipped in 2 weeks, I paid $600 for it (ca residents have to pay extra). They're selling wasr10s now for $520. might take a while though, since the store just got what I ordered 5 months ago in stock. if you order now, probably a good long wait. <br>  They have saiga rifles for $351, $359, and $516 for the .223, 7.62x39 and .308 versions. <br>  <a href="http://www.lanworldinc.com/AK47.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lanworldinc.com/AK47.html</a><br>  <br>  or you can get a kel tec su16 carbine, its like the AR15 but not the same thing. more reliable, simple, but accepts same magazines and have integrated bipod and piticanny rail for optics. <br>  manuf. site: <a href="http://www.kel-tec-cnc.com/su16ca.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kel-tec-cnc.com/su16ca.htm</a><br>  I bought mine locally right before Xmas for $515. the price hasn't changed much.|`|UUB398aqaa	i just bought one last week for 400 and thought it a little overpriced.  look around the local pawn shops and gun stores, you should be able to find a better deal.  prices on the internet have inflated much more than in store prices.<br>  <br>  <br>  it is a much better rifle than the crappy Century Arms wasr10's and tantals.  i'd just stay away from anything assembled by century arms|`|Gwndy2q0aa	You could get that and it would be a good deal or you could get a new AR.

ajnGHNr8aa	You have a couple of correct answers but none answered the last part of your question. <br>  So, if the 25th car does cross the start/finish line before anyone else on the lead lap does, whether in the pits or not, he gets to lead that lap and gets 5 bonus points. If he does not cross the start/finish line first he must make a complete lap and then cross the start/finish line, on the track or in the pits, before any other lead lap car does. If his pit is before the start/finish line and he did not pass all the lead lap cars before the start/finish line on the lap before he will not get to lead a lap and gets no bonus points.<br>    This usually does not create a problem as stated earlier because the pace car speed is more than pit road speed and the 25th place car can usually pass the race leaders before they get to the start/finish line.|`|njz5XFG2aa	Yes he leads the lap if everyone in front of him pits and he stays out,Yes he will lead the lap if pits the next lap but only under green flag conditions.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	Its not complicated.  The S/F line extends across pit road.  Whoever crossed the line first leads the lap whether its on the track or on pit road.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	He leads the lap if he crosses the start/finish line beofre anyone else.....it's not that complicated.|`|3NYno2TZaa	If all the cars ahead of the guy who is 25th come in and pit, then if that driver stays out, and completes a full lap (crosses the finish line) before the lead car comes out, then he is considered the leader and receives the 5 bonus points for leading that lap. Even if the real leader of the race pits in front of the start finish line, pit road speed is usually slower than the pace car, so usually the car staying out will cross that line ahead of the leader who pits ahead of that line. once the 25th place car crosses the line and collects the 5 pts, he usually comes in and pits the next time by.  hope that helps|`|mfvtpCpCaa	If that guy stays out to lead, he'd have to pass the finish line before the lead car does. If he doesn't, he'd have to say out another lap to get his 5 points. If he pits the next lap after everyone else pitted, unless he passes the line before everyone else, he won't get the 5 points.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	It changes depending on if his pit, before, or after the start/finish line..<br>  The start/finish line runs through the pits, so whoever crosses it first (in, or out of the pits), is in the lead..

9b5QUw2eaa	I would recommend strength training.  I think Hero for Hire hit the nail on the head with what the problem is.  The stronger you are, the less of an impact the body smothering will have on you.<br>  <br>  Start with calisthenics like push ups, chin ups, dips, sit ups, crunches bridges, handstands, and body weight squats.  After you've built up a base, start eating more protein, carbs, and start lifting weights.<br>  <br>  A drill you can do is to take your belt, tighten it around your middle ribs until you can fill yourself having to take deeper breaths, tighten it some more,  and do some bear crawls and crab walks.|`|F0uLexezaa	eat foods high in B vitamins as they help build stamina.|`|YN93QRdyaa	I would suggest before anything else try and consider how you act while held down. Stay calm, is the absolute first rule. You burn much more energy if you get frenetic and spazzy. Don't try to bench press the opponent, or launch him into the air with a big bridge, those big explosive movements tire you very quickly so save them for when you're sure they'll work. When moving your hips - either up or across the mat - use fast but controlled motion, don't be more explosive than you need to be. 'Maximum efficiency through minimum effort'.<br>  <br>  Check your posture and hand positioning - defending submissions and generally trying to constantly react to the opponent is tiring. Give him as few options as possible. If his weight is affecting your breathing, make a frame with your arms and push him off a little to give you some breathing room. Deep breathes, of course. Also, don't tense up. Try and relax, especially if you don't have to actively defend at a given moment. And whenever you do something, have a purpose for it - don't just start moving because you feel you should do something. Choose a course of action, then execute it.<br>  <br>  Obviously you can also work on your general conditioning - sprints, calisthenics, etc. I find Ross Enamait's material a good resource for this. And of course just doing more Judo will develop your stamina too. But if you are finding yourself gassing in the same situation - i.e. on your back - all the time, I would consider evaluating what you do in that situation and see if that is contributing to your conditioning problem. I cannot stress enough, stay calm, composed and relaxed, you will last longer and fight better.|`|ve4LsVszaa	If you are referring to being on the bottom with someone else being on top of you (in newaza), then the issue isn't so much wind or stamina as it is getting your diaphragm stronger so that you can breath under a "load."  Don't worry, the more people lay on you, the better you will be able to tolerate it.  Jogging, skipping rope, racket ball, boxing, Muay thai, or the cardiovascular activity of your choice help, but just giving your diaphragm time to develop will solve a lot of it, if additional exercise isn't in he cards for you right now.|`|7XSvp533aa	Most of the times that happens to me. If you want to build stamina then keep practicing. Remember perfect practice makes Perfect. Also try to breath when you are doing any activity. This will help you get blood into your brain and helps you to focus and to control your breathing. Good luck I hope i HELPED YOU.

0da6ab3c6b462dc6d34ee0177bdc0459aa	Im Aries guy but punching a wall as in house walls are softer and probably make hole afterwards. If you punch a brick wall or wooden its going to hurt and bleed on your knuckles.  The worst is actually sprain or hurt your wrist.  If so it takes weeks before the cartilage can heal.<br>  I punch the brick wall only when i have boxing gloves on and with wraps.  It still bruise but i been boxing for awhile so I am okay at it.<br>  Best is beat up a heavy bag for a agressive chick like you.

8UPRnMo1aa	I am going to Indian Wells this weekend and i expect Federer to go for winners more and be more agressive on the backhand side.|`|6ecdc0fb70eb839a2a22e77ecfde44e4aa	First of all , it is too early to predict things but Roger made the right decision by hiring Cahill. Roger does not need a baby sitter in the form of  a coach instead he needs someone who can help him with strategies in dealing with Rafa and Andy Murray. I think that is where Cahill could teach Roger something though it would be hard to coach somebody as Roger. However, Roger needs him more and I am sure he realizes that something is wrong with his game so he needs to pay attention to what Cahill has to say. I know one thing for sure Cahill will not say things to please Roger so it may hurt Roger for a while but will benefit him in the long run. I hope and wish Darren Cahill helps Roger in achieving his goal. All the best to Rogi!|`|uWYlumvsaa	Quite honestly, it's up to Roger to effectively use what he learns from Cahill. As to whether or not this works out is anyone's guess. He should be fine against a few of the lower ranked players, but once he gets around to the likes of players like Simon, Tsonga, Djokovic, Murray, and Nadal, it's all up to him mentally, to pull off the victory. As we've all seen, Roger's mentality gets the best of him sometimes, which costs him some pretty close and important matches. I think he'll do fine, as long he stays positive about things.|`|VspF1Vklaa	it depends on the way roger will learn & the way in which cahill will teach . so , lets see  how roger will learn& how cahill will teach .
QtjnmEzoaa	I disagree with the guy before me on SO many levels. <br>  We may have lost a couple of offensive linemen, but they were low-key guys who rarely started. We retained our only consistently good man, Jeff Saturday. I WISH we had lost some more of them since they're so incapable of punching holes for Addai.<br>  Also, Peyton Manning not good under pressure? Have you ever watched him play? It's true that he's not mobile. But running isn't the only way to avoid pressure. His receivers are so well trained, his eyes are so good, and his arm is so accurate, that he can complete a pass even when playing a dominant defensive line well out of control of his linemen. He gets the ball away so quickly that pressure often becomes a non-issue. He was sacked one of the fewest times in the league last year, and that's no credit to his offensive line. It's a credit to the fact that he can make the play.<br>  <br>  Anyway, as for next year, I'm very excited about the new defensive coordinator. Maybe he can teach our guys how to tackle. Tiny little Marlin Jackson isn't capable of stopping LenDale White without wrapping him. The strategy of our undersized defense has been to try to hit a guy so hard that he falls down. That works if you're Bob Sanders. But we have one Bob Sanders, not 11. So I hope they work on that this offseason. I'm so excited to see Freeney and Mathis back to work again, they're becoming a very dominant Duo. <br>  As far as offense is concerned, Mike Hart will be back from his knee injury and I am just bursting to find out what the kid can do. As a Notre Dame fan, I remember him tearing up the field against the Irish in college (I believe he had more than 300 all purpose yards his senior year) so I'm hoping to see a little bit of that translate into the pros. He hasn't had many carries, due to an early exit this season from a knee injury, but his yards per carry average has been fantastic. I'm also excited to see Anthony Gonzalez flourish in Marvin Harrison's absence. The offense is obviously going to miss Harrison to an extent, but Manning is so good at making the best of situations like that (Gijon Robinson came up huge for us a couple times last year.)<br>  <br>  I think Jim Caldwell's spirit will really help us in the post season this year. I don't expect him to get a Superbowl win his first year, but I think the Colts may have seen the last of their one-and-done pattern.|`|uWRPbJQ1aa	Tony Dungy is one of the best coaches in the NFL. <br>  <br>  Colts 2008 Season - 12 - 4<br>  Colts 2007 Season - 13 - 3<br>  Colts 2006 Season - 12 - 4 * Super Bowl Winners*<br>  Colts 2005 Season - 14 - 2|`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	12-4<br>  <br>  Same as it ever was.

They have pretty much the same as this past year, just with a new coach. Most think that they would have not hired Jim Caldwell as coach if Peyton Manning didn't like him.

Or a 4" finesse worm in oxblood/red flake on a dropshot rig. That worked good for me all day yesterday!|`|PGlZn1wEaa	An hour and a half isn't fishing.  I sit for 10 hours some days waiting for a Shark to take my bait.|`|GAgmuiD4aa	ahh is there fish in the pond? hehehe, i've sat for days waiting for tuna to bite, hehe try longer :)|`|YgPf2UVMaa	Not sure where you live, guessing somewhere north, but you could have been moving the bait to fast as fish are cold blooded and are the same temp as the water they are in.  The cold water slows their metabolism and movement.  All of this is if you were using artificial bait.  You may have been fishing to high.  Try a deeper depth or a deeper spot in the pond.|`|90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	Gotta agree with steven, it's fishing, not catching... if we were guaranteed fish every time we went out, we'd change the name of it.|`|QC2NozBkaa	That's why they call it fishing and not catching.
b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	The best training advice I could give is to make every session on the bike count and don't stop and start. If you races are 20 minute motos then do 25 minutes on the bike without stopping. But if you train as you would in a race and try to keep everything neat and tight, then this is how you will be on a race day. People who do 2 laps and then stop for a rest just train their bodies to do this on a race day and by the time they are on their 3rd lap their body wants to stop.<br>  <br>  Weights,swimming and a bit of running is about all you will need after that. You could do a bit of push bike riding but you have to be careful as that does tend to build muscle in the wrong places.  Don't put too much weight on when weight training as you are better off with a lighter weigh and more reps.  Using too much weight will increase your chance of arm pump happening when you are racing.  <br>  <br>  Watch your diet and drink plenty of water.|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Running, cycling and just seat time on the track are the best things you can do.|`|yJd1H8C9aa	if you have a mountain bike RIDE IT!

v5MP0KJ8aa	I agree with The King and Khal but I think you should be team manager. I had a friend in high school that was cut from our basketball team and he became team manager. One of our players began failing classes so he was cut. My friend then became a member of the team and later earned a lot of playing time. Use it to motivate you.|`|HtYGxZcCaa	all you can do is keep practicing and hope to be a walk-on in college and maybe try to be a minor league lacrosse player<br>  <br>  using being cut as motivation to get better and make it somewhere|`|5zqsMSLpaa	Talk to your coach this happened to me to except for basketball<br>  I went up to him and asked him the reason he cut me was because he didnt like my friends and said choose better onces<br>  he thought i was becoming a gangster LOL|`|delicXRHaa	DEFINITELY be a team manager! It is a GREAT opportunity. Don't worry about being cut...lots of times there is honestly no good reason why you were cut. Just ask the coach why you got cut and how you can improve.

nxymxSUFaa	Mickey Mantle, Al Lopez field in Tampa, Florida at a Spring Training game against the Pirates.  I was just a kid.  My father was best friends with Johnny (double no-hitter) Vander Meer.  Johnny had a lot of connections with baseball even though he was out of the game by then.  <br>  <br>  My father, Johnny and I were able to visit the Yankees locker room and I got the chance to meet many of the ball players including Yogi Berra, Roger Maris, Whitey Ford, Clete Boyer, as well as my hero, The Mick!  I got a ton of autographs that day but Mickey's was the most important to me.<br>  <br>  I loved to play the game but knew at an early age that I did not have the talent it took to play at the major league level.  I did however learn one very important aspect of my life that day and that was to somehow stay close to the game and sports in general.  Hence, my life as a sports journalist.|`|obPSaYf3aa	Joe DiMaggio's autograph on a baseball when I visited his restaurant in San Francisco when he still lived there before the 1989 earthquake.<br>  <br>  Willie Mays' autograph on a baseball when I was invited to a SF Giant community event in the early 90's and he gladly signed it.

I still remember the 1998 World Cup like yesterday. I never seen anything like Ronaldo. He was so quick, so agile, and had a hunger for goals. Brazil made the finals in Ronaldo's first year actually playing in the World Cup. Many do not know that he actually played sick and with an injury. 2002 he came back and showed the world who is the real deal. I remember seeing him in Inter doing everybody up. He made the Italian league really popular. He and Roberto Baggio playing together was the most memorable. To the dude saying it's a new generation, bull, put Pele, Bekenbauer, and Hugo in there prime on the field with These nobodies, and you'll see which players were the real players, not celebrities. Ronaldo deserves way more respect than he gets, because no one can do what he did. Cristiano Ronaldo had one good season, Ronaldo has had a decade of good playing and just cause of his injuries he is talked sh*t upon. At least he stepped foot back on the field after those injuries. Never will the real number 9 die in my eyes. And at least Ronaldo was never hated by no fans, he was always respected.|`|g4ukAIecaa	you are so right the only real ronaldo in my opinion is el fenomeno i remember seeing luiz beat everybody in his way pass through everbody like nothing all christiano does is stepovers thats it while el fenomeno would do all sorts of tricks that no one could ever think of what i haven't seen christiano do a rainbow or a bycicle kick people who support christiano ronaldo are dumbfuc|<s and who only followed futbol for a while|`|jUeiFZfmaa	Its a big lack of respect to Brazilian Ronaldo who is way better than Cristiano Ronaldo.

BIG PLAYERS MAKE BIG PLAYS IN BIG GAMES. and games dont get as big as worldcup games. RONALDO WON 2 WORLD TITLES AND HAS PUT THE BALL IN THE BACK OF THE NET MORE TIMES THAN ANYONE ONE THE GREATEST STAGE OF TEHM ALL. and you cant say ronaldo doesnt have heart..comin back from THREE serious career ending injuries is nothing. especially when people call you FAT and talk ish about you. this dude has proved ot me that he loves the game.|`|82MzhqHRaa	Ronaldo was one of the best players to ever play soccer.

im8xN545aa	Yeah and Hugh Morris is his mother lol (ewww that's a nightmare procreation I don't really want to be privy to).<br>  <br>  Actually I think there is a high probability that Giles Clarke is indeed Ian Bells long lost father. How else would you explain the favouritism over Bell and his continual selection when he was severely out of form and averaging around the mid to low 30s. <br>  <br>  Through the scientific method of clutching at straws I’ve also discovered some physical characteristics too:<br>  <br>  The same high forehead (and similarity in the mouth) must mean they share at least a few genes:<br>  <a href="http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn43/mypictures198321/Forehead.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn43/...</a><br>  <br>  The wide curving smiles indicate a secret tryst somewhere in the past between Mrs Bell and Mr Clarke: <br>  <a href="http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn43/mypictures198321/Smile.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn43/...</a><br>  <br>  Both have been hurt by the game which shows a predisposition towards injury:<br>  <a href="http://www.cricinfo.com/db/PICTURES/CMS/88000/88030.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.cricinfo.com/db/PICTURES/CMS/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cricinfo.com/db/PICTURES/CMS/90800/90842.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.cricinfo.com/db/PICTURES/CMS/...</a><br>  <br>  And lastly, how else do you explain this loving (and ever so slightly disturbing) family snap?

Leoc8rlGaa	Well, the obvious choice would be Viv Richards, but Nixon has a lot in his favour. Firstly, his Wikipedia/Liarpedia entry is much longer than that of Richards:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Nixon" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Nixon</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viv_Richards" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viv_Richard...</a><br>  <br>  Which demonstrates that either there is a lot more to be said about Nixon, or his fan base is stronger.<br>  <br>  Secondly, Nixon plays in a far more commercial and media orientated age, where everything a player does is under the spotlight, and personal faults are under close scrutiny. Richards got away with far more indiscretions than Nixon would be allowed to these days. Mistakes or indiscretions in the past would be talked about and forgotten after a while. Today, they could conceivably spell the end of a player's career.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, Nixon is a far more innovative player than Richards. He gave a master class in how to play the reverse sweep to a legendary England batsman, David Gower:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kk0Fu7guEg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kk0Fu7gu...</a><br>  <br>  A lesson Gower duly noted!<br>  <br>  See how Nicco masters the shot here against the Maestro Murali:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi0B5xXbX8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi0B5xXb...</a><br>  <br>   He also among a rare group of wicketkeepers with the confidence to leave the stumps and dive in front of the ball when batsmen attempt the reverse sweep. <br>  <br>  His boundless enthusiasm, supreme fitness, and ability to keep reinventing how cricket is played must surely rank "Badger" as one of the finest pioneers of the game of cricket. Surely in a hundred years time, it will be Paul Nixon, the famous sledger and reverse sweeper, who will be the name on everyones lips, rather than a player who frequently angered the authorities through his tempestuous tantrumy behaviour, and petulance when decisions did not go in his favour. Unlike Richards, Nixon has never caused a game to be held up due to the crowd rioting because of his behaviour, as Richards managed in 1989 at Sabina Park against India.<br>  <br>  So Nixon's the man!|`|f9hiPMDxaa	Sir Viv, hands down.

QBcs78Ntaa	think they should take the new ECW and change the name <br>  Make a show that resembles TNA but is more extreme|`|NRs72Afxaa	I agree this question should also be related to TNA. Because I hear people say "TNA sucks"  "Tna is full of washed wrestlers" "WCW 2.0". Do they even watch Tna. <br>  <br>  I'll admit right here and now that I havn't watched an Ecw show since October. Because they just don't have feel. Good wrestling, but it aint what it use to be. It doesn't get the brand treatment it deserves. They only get one or two match cards on a ppv, 15 rosters, and please don't hate me...the Pg rating, but I have a good reason. It use to be a crazy wrestling promotion that fans enjoyed. It was rated M and seeing it Pg is scary after the clusters they did. <br>  <br>  I'm sure the Jack Swagger vs Chrstian match was good, and I'll have to find a video but I just don't have intrest in ECW.  I respect Jack Swagger, Tommy Dreamer, Finlay, Evan Bourne, Miz, Morrison, and Christian but I just don't have any intrest in it. I do think Ecw is has better wrestling then Raw in my opinion.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Thank you, this is just an example of the ignorance that people have.<br>  <br>  No wrestling question though..really just a statement..=)|`|OHBvEYKHaa	yes i have watched episodes and i have a good reason hate it for good ligament reasons and ecw does not bring some of the best wrestling to wwe!|`|1JywgkyMaa	ecw went straight to hell when paul heyman,a guy that actually gave a crap about his wrestlers,left|`|caczNImxaa	i have watched it and there is nothing interesting about ecw.not at all|`|p6GGoFDsaa	Well apart from the guy who hates ECW for "good ligament reasons" (whatever that means) I think a lot of WWE fans have finally come to realize that ECW will never be as extreme as it used to be. However all the violence and stuff has been replaced by extremely talented wrestlers... and it's fast becoming my favourite WWE brand.<br>  Anyone else think it should be longer?|`|6JUC2OMQaa	I think they should take the new ECW and change the name <br>  Make a show that resembles TNA but is more extreme and is a square ring and name it ECW and gather people from Smackdown and Raw and free agents and make it awesome|`|sBQU4TEyaa	I Agree with you 100 percent.......|`|20SiT55Gaa	THANK GOD!

yeb7fyHsaa	Nathan McCullum seems to be more of an all-rounder. He can do well with the bat as well.

Pc0QjrQ4aa	I'm old.  I saw the Pogues live in 1989 when I was in high school.  I still have their first record on Vinyl (bought it from Sam The Record Man).  I don't know what the bigger shock is- that Shane McGowan is still alive, or that in my 35+years of being alive the Leafs haven't made it to a Stanley Cup Final.  <br>  <br>  The Leafs...the Rolling Stones or Frank Sinatra.  Still making tons of money, mostly on reputation.  Haven't won any awards/honours for a while, yet still fill the stadium/arena every concert.  People still love them, buy the swag, and know all the songs.  I know, Sinatra is dead, but when a Sinatra (or a Stones) song comes on, you know it, you hear it, and it has that distinctive voice that is Sinatra.  And people have been trying to be the next Sinatra...and there won't be a next one.  There was one, and that's it.  I look at the Ballard years much like I look at some of Sinatra's later work...the less said, the better.  Enjoy the champagne years.<br>  <br>  As to what song describes them...I don't know if one song could sum up 80 years.  Maybe something by Stereolab.  Multilingual, hard to understand, and at times, quite nice.<br>  <br>  I've heard some Flogging Molly and Dropkick Murphys...good stuff.|`|UoUaO52taa	My Sabres- Foo Fighters<br>  <br>  They've had 2 stetches where they looked like they could actually be real good (Early in the season and the stretch before Miller went down).

We're diggin deeper w/Lalime but it'll go for naught and we'll end up throwing it away|`|G33E41IBaa	The Devils would be the Beatles, because even after all this time they're still good :)<br>  <br>  Songs that would describe other teams:<br>  <br>  The Sharks would be "Life's Been Good" by Joe Walsh (the Eagles) because they just keep win, win, winning.<br>  <br>  "It's Been Such a Long Time" by Boston would totally describe the Leafs.  42 Years...<br>  <br>  The Islanders would be "Help!" by the Beatles because they really need some help.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Flogging Molly.....sounds kinda rude!  Must be that modern rock garbage.  Give me Perry Como anyday.<br>  <br>  I guess Chicago would be....well Chicago.  Unfortunately the only song I can think of is Saturday in the Park...and that has nothing to do with hockey!|`|2iuZdBXraa	Leafs - Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow - Fleetwood Mac.<br>  Least Favourite - Ottawa - Loser by 3 Doors Down.|`|naZQqrNeaa	Have fun at the Flogging Molly show.

3916f5798ac025038c4fefc3c8b7ea7caa	MJ was better than Kobe primarily because MJ was so much SMARTER than Kobe will ever be.  MJ pushed his teammates, and expected them to work as hard as HE did, on both ends of the court.  MJ also made his teammates better.   <br>  Any time one of Kobe's teammates gets a little publicity, Kobe resents it.  (Look at how Kobe always resented Shaq.)<br>  Athletically, they're both tremendously skilled and talented.  When it comes to being a teammate (and a MAN), MJ had it.  Kobe is and will probably always be nothing more than just a talented punk.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	MJ made his teammates better?  Really?  If you look at overall stats, MJs teammates actually performed better when he retired than they did with him on the team.  Not trying to knock MJ, just stating the facts.|`|G4wGCghdaa	Kobe is Kobe. A very talented athlete who can win if he has the players around him to make him better (I.E. Shaq). Kobe hasn't won since Shaq left L.A. Kind of Ironic since it was Kobe's whining that forced Shaq out of the Laker equation. Jordan was more of a leader than Kobe. He was much more aggressive in practice often getting into fights with team mates because he had a burning desire to win. I just never have seen that in Kobe. Skill wise they are pretty equal, but when it comes down to desire to win the scale tips to Jordan by a lot.<br>  How come Shaq can win without Kobe but Kobe can't win without Shaq?

hbGET8moaa	Your country's national sports organization will definitely conduct try-outs for members of its national team. Once you become a member of your country's national team, your team will participate in a Olympic qualifying tournament(s). <br>  <br>  there are two ways for a team to participate in the Olympic Games.<br>  1.) Your team must be more or less a  finalist in a World Tournament<br>  2.) if your team didn't qualify in a world tournament, your country must at least win in a Continental tournament.<br>  <br>  if your country becomes the host of a Olympic Games, surviving a tryout will be enough for you to be part of the Olympics.
YSa3Mdz3aa	I'm sure anything is possible but it is unlikely to get recruited if you aren't playing at all. It means you are probably out of shape and its hard to get back into competition shape quickly. There aren't really that many schools that will give out polo scholarships but you still might be able to walk on. Depending on your level of play and the position (i.e. there are fewer goalies and lefties out there) ... you might get a scholarship to a division 2 school but it'll still be hard if you aren't currently playing. I would recommend finding a club team or master's team to pratice with to keep your skills up. If you're still in high school check out polo camps if you can afford it.|`|z21GCJxPaa	i dont know about scholarships but the best Water Polo college teams are in CA.  USC,UCLA,Stanford,LMU,CAL
LIKkt8djaa	If anything your nose should be longer then your tail, If you have a shorter nose your gonna end up nose bombing powder runs and possibly even the larger kickers if you're not perfectly centered on your balance. I would move the bindings back so you have a longer nose.<br>  <br>  Or just center them, But that could depend on if you have a true twin or a directional twin snowboard.|`|MFI0V2GBaa	You're stance is all about you're preferance. If you like it keep it. If you're not riding switch you're not going to notice it's not centered. It's not typical to have it closer to the nose, but if you're just free riding you probably wont notice. If you think something else might be better, right down all the specs of how its set up now, and change it up a bit, if you don't like it changed, just go back to the way it was. Trying differnt stances never hurts.

Not just throwing wwe to the side like its a piece of trash.|`|a5hNA3Kxaa	He didn't sell out, its not like he left the WWE just for the money, he always wanted to be an actor, and didn't want to wrestle anymore, so hes doing what he wants to do, he is no sell out.|`|tWzIsIH0aa	Oh gee, how can ever I cope?

AA12294326	Leigh Matthews. Was too tough to win a Brownlow but won 8 B & F's at Hawthorn when they were at their top. When he lost pace as a rover he became one of the toughest key forwards ever seen & won the goal kicking on several occassions. All this and remained ateam player to the very end. Didn't do too badly as a coach either.|`|DiqzSfuYaa	Gary Ablett Snr is the best I've seen but I can't judge the older blokes that were before my time.|`|QGY8BYS7aa	Bloody hell!

But if I had to pick one, I would certainly pick a player like Tony Locket. He was a goal kicking machine and took amazing marks, his technique was like no other and he added something fantastic to our game. His legacy and mark on the aussie rules league will live forever.|`|HxluJK2Vaa	I agree with some of the answers...<br>  <br>  For me a great player is someone who could turn a game around and win it almost by themselves, ala Plugger and Carey. They mostly played up forward.<br>  <br>  I think KB and Michael Tuck should get a mention... 400+ games.<br>  <br>  Lethal was good, but Gary Ablett Snr could play anywhere and turn a game around, as Half back flanker, on the wing, forward flank or at full forward. He was special, the greatest that I have seen.|`|vcaFkuphaa	Hey mate, if i'm not mistaken i'd say you have two accounts and always give your other account best answer, nice try mate!!<br>  <br>  Your other account is AFL4LYFE right?|`|qUBWjHq0aa	Plugger Lockett<br>  <br>  Best AFL player eva that ive seen play|`|nfZzdWGLaa	Gary Ablett snr for sure
mXFOru11aa	yes there certainly are still AFL players doing drugs|`|XOlnc8iBaa	Yes they are. I have friends who have been in clubs and seen players snorting lines off the table tops. They usually only do it in the off season, but in truth some do drugs all year round. AFL is about money now, so the clubs know about the drug use, but they're not going to risk losing as game and reprimanding their best players for drug use. Money is the name of the game so no one cares.|`|2s244jGgaa	Yes, and they are probably doing all they can to hide it.<br>  <br>  Their reputations may not be as large as a player like Ben Cousins is which would allow them to be more under the limelight and be able to take the opportunity to use the drugs.|`|VLCUDZlcaa	rhetorical question really.....|`|W8SgRKo7aa	the names buddy..., infact just throw the whole team in there...|`|DiqzSfuYaa	A group of 500 or so males aged between 18 and 30, all cashed up, allowed to get caught twice before any action is taken?

fAMpwF3Aaa	I can stay awake watching football,<br>  Physical contact is legal,<br>  Most games are close and determined in the last few minutes,<br>  There's a time limit,<br>  Cheerleaders,<br>  Most people who score touchdowns do dances which are fun to watch,<br>  There's more then one big rivalry,<br>  16 games,<br>  The coaches actually do stuff,<br>  And about a million other reasons.|`|7RziqsDcaa	Well, most of the game (not just like two minutes) you actually see action.<br>  <br>  You don't play something gaaay (like trying to hit a bal with a stick).<br>  <br>  It is very anticipated (people show up for pre-season, draft, nfl combine, practice, not to mention the actual games).<br>  <br>  I heard just a few months ago, like 400 people showed up for a Marlins game. I think that more people show up at Tom Brady's hotel when he''s in town.<br>  <br>  Also, you're actually playing defense in football, not like playing defense when players watch the steroid injected hitter hit another home run.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is, even soccer is better than baseball. Baseball seems like a video game type of a game (hit the ball with the stick when it comes to you, then run around the circle and get back to where you started without getting hit with your ball/bullet)<br>  <br>  And I believe the superbowl gets more viewers than all 4-7 world series games.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	Action. Something is always happening. In watching baseball, a lot of your time is spent staring at a closeup of a pitcher spitting or chomping on the world's biggest wad of gum. Football is intense throughout the entire game, while baseball is only intense in the later innings of close games. <br>  <br>  Time. Football has a set time. Some baseball games go on to 2 in the morning or later.<br>  <br>  Steroids. I know steroids are used in football, but baseball is all about the individual numbers. So steroids are a much bigger deal.<br>  <br>  Team effort. Football is much more of a team game than baseball. In baseball, it's possible for one guy to get the win singlehandedly. In football, one guy isn't nearly enough. You need at least 22 guys.|`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	I've seen baseball "fans" read the paper during the game.<br>  <br>  On talk radio when someone complains about the hitting of the third baseman in one game, that person is often reminded it is a marathon not a sprint.  Marathons are boring.|`|QGevDlIkaa	a football game is interesting and the evnets are important from the kickoff while in baseball almost noone cares until the last three innings, i know ive been to a cubs/cards game in st louis and everyone walked around and didnt watch until the 7th inning|`|0093382286e191b54fe019326d1aa456aa	Football is just awesome.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	One can stay awake through a football game.|`|acaAycEXaa	It's not. Baseball is the greatest game ever invented, but football is more fun to watch.<br>  <br>  More brains and strategy is involved with baseball. Sports fans in general are dumber now and don't understand the subtleties of baseball. There is actually a lot going on when the casual fan doesn't see it.<br>  <br>  bRyce-<br>  Back when they had the Superstars competition, the baseball players always creamed the football players. baseball has the best athletes.|`|ZrnSwqrIaa	I love both football and baseball but i must say that football is better.  i dont know if your talking about the sport in general or watching it on tv.  In general, if your playing football, your active all the time just running around.  With baseball half the time your either standing still on the field or on your *** on the bench waiting to bat.  <br>  <br>  On TV, baseball is on pretty much every day for like 7 months.  NFL is on tv twice a week (one game on monday) which allows fans to talk about the game coming up and people wont get bored with only 16 games in a season.|`|CL7OTeiCaa	Football is nonstop action. Baseball is great, but when all you have is out after out for a few innings it can be boring. Football people are always hitting each other and getting interceptions. It is always awesome. Except of course when your team is losing.|`|GxGsJixoaa	i like both, football is more physical which i like (hockey is more physical) but baseball is the ultimate skills game.|`|bJn83u7Oaa	More action, more scoring, more hitting, better athletes.|`|xCIwfYpFaa	Because its diff rent every play and there is hitting in the game and there are a lot more emotions.|`|MxHRjPFHaa	Got to love the hits...<br>   faster pace..|`|ex5HgM1aaa	its a contact sport and plays are always happening unlike baseball where they stand there for a while but a lot of plays dont happen<br>  <br>  Also its a team sport and everyone on the team on the field has to do something on that certain play in football where in baseball the ball only goes through 2-3 people a hit|`|Si5TWNt9aa	Football is more fun to play and more fun to watch.<br>  <br>  I can never watch baseball its so boring, and even when I try and play it for fun, I get so bored just standin around waitin for someone to hit the ball near me.<br>  <br>  Football is exciting, and fast paced.<br>  <br>  It also requires more athletecism.

EGe0k8P6aa	For squirrels and birds you usually need 3 ft-lbs of impact energy. For rabbits, it goes up to 5 ft-lbs of impact energy. For possum, I'm not sure exactly. Maybe 8 ft-lbs? Dr. Beeman's chart doesn't mention possum by name.<br>  <br>  So for the under $100 air-rifle for squirrel, rabbit, and birds the list looks like this:<br>  Crosman 2100 (.177)<br>  Crosman 2260 (.22) (not ideal since its a co2 gun)<br>  Crosman Phantom (.177)<br>  Daisy 22SG (..22)<br>  Daisy 880 (.177) (marginal for rabbits at more than 20 yards)<br>  Daisy 901 (.177) (marginal for rabbits at more than 20 yards)<br>  Crosman Quest (.177)<br>  Crosman Storm (.177)<br>  Winchester 1000B (.177)<br>  <br>  Most of the spring piston guns on this list are going to be budget guns. They have sufficient power for hunting, but they're usually not high-quality. The pumps range from marginal guns (Daisy 880) to adequate at reasonable ranges (20-30 yards) with the Crosman 2100 and Daisy 22SG. They aren't going to be as good of a quality as the Benjamin 392/397, but they'll work provided you put your pellets where they need to go and keep the range close. The Crosman 2260 is a .22 caliber co2 gun. CO2 guns are affected by temperature. As the temperature goes down, their power goes down and the point of impact shifts. However in warm weather it generates enough power to kill small game animals.<br>  <br>  If you're serious about hunting possum (or other larger small game animals), I'd suggest limiting yourself to the more powerful springers on the list or paying a bit more to get a quality .22 airgun (either a springer like the RWS 34 Panther, a pump like the Benjamin 392, or a precharged gun like the Benjamin Discovery) since the larger and heavier .22 caliber pellets will deliver more down-range energy and penetrate better.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Look at your local sporting goods store.  The staff should be able to help you make your selection, as well as tell you if hunting with an airgun is even legal where you live.|`|39d77d396b6018aac260eb632b7665f9aa	You can get reasonable powerful and reasonable accurate for $100, you don't get well made or durable.<br>  <br>  Crosman Phantom<br>  Crosman Storm XT<br>  Crosman Quest <br>  Ruger AIr Hawk<br>  All of them are accurate enough and powerful enough to take small game(rabbit) out to 40-45 yards, if you can make the shot(head).<br>  <br>  Airgun Sales<br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.airgundepot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.airgundepot.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pyramydair.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pyramydair.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.airgunsbbguns.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.airgunsbbguns.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.airgunwarehouseinc.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.airgunwarehouseinc.com</a><br>  Check around for the best price<br>  <br>  The Benjamin 392(.22) or 397(.177) are the least expensive air rifles that I would call "good". These are well made air rifles, that will last you a lifetime if you take reasonable care of them.

oYXjV8kHaa	Do interval workouts. For example you could go to a track and do a 100m sprint then get a jump rope; jump 75-100 jumps(depending on how much intensity you want) then sprint again and then jump rope again. Do 5 reps of this. When sprinting remember to gradually get faster as you do the reps. After that do ab workouts - sit ups, planks etc. and squats for your legs you must maintain a strong core and strong legs it'll really help you keep going through those long runs. Then whenever possible go on the trails and run sometimes just go easy but go for a really long time and other times do a certain like 2 or 3 miles and push yourself and time it. I would also suggest do all this with a friend who also wants to be the team that way it'll be more fun and you can keep each other motivated.|`|NJUhQn60aa	ah... cross country - a necessary evil for successful track running.<br>  <br>  The hardest part about running is just getting on your shoes and getting out the door.  Once out - you're already out - so just do the run.<br>  <br>  Ideas, there are two basic routes - a round-about and an out-and-back.  Both have pros and cons.  When alone, I always try to do an out and back.  Pick a place or a point you want to run to, once you get there, you have no choice but to run back.<br>  <br>  A round-about is basically running in a circle around your house or starting point.  While it's nice to be close to home, it's also too easy to get tired and quit and just head back home.  <br>  <br>  Mix it up - keep it interesting.  Get a long route and have a few different shorter routes.  As you do more, extend the routes to get in more work.<br>  <br>  While running, take advantage of the run.  DON'T TAKE SHORT CUTS!!!!  Don't cut across a field, stick to the road/sidewalk.  How many times have runners lost a very close race and thought "If I could only have done a little bit more".<br>  <br>  Feeling good on a particular day, through in some faster pick-ups.  In college we'd use telephone poles as a pick-up, maybe run fast between 2 or 3 telephone poles every now and then.<br>  <br>  Running can be boring if you make it that way.  If you mix it up, it'll be fun.  Don't worry about the "workouts" - just get a nice distance base in - let the coach worry about the workouts, just give him a nice athlete to work with.

L1ij02Xlaa	It's definitely another questionable decision made by Coach Stew. I can live with him cutting a few players here and there, but this is becoming ridiculous. IMO he just isn't fit to be the HC at WVU. But if he were utilized as an assistant coach then I would fully support him. I am not saying that he can't coach, but truly great coaches have the ability to balance out discipline with success, having just one or the other is not enough.|`|RCpkdx4haa	It's people like you that make it hard for fans like me. I, like most sports fans, are tired of premadonna athletes getting anything and everything that they want because they can play a game. They already get a free education, free access to trainers and workout facilities and everything else. It's about time someone stood up to these losers and put them in their place! God forbid you lose a game next year because these dummies can't keep their noses clean. Maybe if more coaches were like this there would be better role models in the NFL and MLB and NBA.|`|8qH5q7TGaa	I see where you are coming from, but Andrews was never that good in my opinion and we still have Sidney Glover and Boogie Allen on the D and on the offense we have Logan Heasty comin' in, and the more touches Noel gets the better!!|`|5gG2OfHIaa	You are playing football in the Big East.

JRBYrVd1aa	Bills + T.O.= Wide open Lee Evans ! Even if T.O does not produce, he is a huge threat to opposing defences so you know that he will be double covered the whole game meaning Lee Evans will have a chance to make a ton of plays. Either way one of them will have a great year, teams wont be able to contain both of them|`|HtYGxZcCaa	To the surprise of many I think it is. The Buffalo Bills will be a playoff team if they can make defensive stops(and I think they played pretty well on D last year). With a solid running back combo of Marshawn Lynch and Fred Jackson combined with a WR combo of Owens and Evans I think more will open up for their offense and take the pressure off of QB Trent Edwards.Bills will be a surprise in 2009.|`|ZrnSwqrIaa	not at all.  this team is way too down.  as a jets fan at first it seemed like the bills would actually compete this year but then i remembered this team has pretty much nobody.  marshawn lynch is a good runningback, but not great.  he is now consistently getting in trouble with the law.  people have been saying trent edwards will develop into a great qb.  i've been waiting for this development to come for 2 years now...its not happening.  the defense is a mess with about 2 decent players (including superstars).  as for owens and evan, the first few games will be good for the two until TO starts complaining hes not getting the ball enough.  The bills overall need a lot more then just a wid reciever to get them into the playoffs.<br>  <br>  7-9 is my prediction for them.|`|ZFe8Uqypaa	Jim Kelly said "Loser town -Loser team - Loser Owner"- The formula  that defenses will employ is double the recievers and SACK the quarterback.|`|49vSwNJHaa	Owens wil fix that play-offs on hold attention drawer will disrupt the team as he has done every place he has been, count on it.|`|WlFIXJSeaa	Nope, it depends on that bum *** QB they have! TO, Evans and lynch could be monsters!! But if that sorry quarter back cant get anything done then the whole team will suffer yo!|`|XCwjsfz2aa	Trent Edwards+completing passes to his team - completing passes to the other team=playoffs. They lost alot of close games LY. The D is there, they need the O to catch up.|`|0093382286e191b54fe019326d1aa456aa	What?|`|VOwLhisBaa	Now that the Buffalo Bills have added Terrell Owens to their arsenal of wide receivers, J.P. Losman has more opportunities to expand his game to go inside or deep. West-coast offense opens up for the Bills and this helps their offense overall with such a deep-threat receiver. Also, the Bills play in the AFC East where it is tough. They have a chance to make the wild-card now.|`|pTjEof56aa	Buffalo Bills = Terrell Owens - Triple-Teaming Lee Evans+more opening for mershaun lynch = End of there playoff drought?<br>  <br>  This is more accurate i believe|`|7RziqsDcaa	Hmm, I guess it wouldbe more like:<br>  <br>  Terrell Owens + triple teaming = crybaby.<br>  <br>  crybaby + Lee Evans = not going anywhere.|`|ubGNtkHQaa	They still need a defense. Without one a last place lock for sure.|`|oYsSL991aa	No.  They'll be one of the more talented teams in the league for sure, but they are in the wrong conference and division if they want to go to the playoffs.  Also, TO will have one of his typical meltdown, and the Bills don't have a good QB to throw it to him.  (Edwards is alright but nothing special)|`|QZicQ0kuaa	They will need a lot more than T.O. Offensive line, Defensive end, and Tight End are weak. They should have fire Jaron. The man has one winning season and a career 7-9 record with every team. How did he even get the job? Blunders weekly.|`|iK4pMtmzaa	Yes as a wild card. New England will win the division(blah..) Miami will tie with Buffalo for 2nd and get wild card. The jets will go 3-13.|`|7Q1dJoFzaa	the bills will have a different name and city before they are in the playoffs again

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Once the playoffs start any team can be a threat under the right circumstances. They have a goalie capable of carrying them if he gets hot and decent depth, though I think you may be overstating the 3 solid lines a little. Who would have imagined the Oiler run of a couple years ago, or the Canes run that led to a Stanley Cup? That is part of the allure of hockey at playoff time...any thing can and often does happen. I wouldnt bet on them making a serious run but I also wouldnt be surprised.|`|e785c93db9de6e231df0a1150f23b042aa	Well Vancouver as a team isnt as good as the Wings or Sharks.  That being said, goaltending can take you a long way in the playoffs and Vancouver has that.  If all these teams were playing their best I wouldnt bet on Vancouver being able to get past the better teams, but we all know that isnt always the case.  Underdogs win all the time, especially in hockey.  I dont know, I wouldnt consider Vancouver a major contender but anything can happen.  All the teams above Vancouver in the standing in the west are scarier than the Nucks IMO. <br>  <br>  CAPTAIN:  Im not trying to be a prick here, but all your info is inaccurate.|`|Bqhku10qaa	I do not see Vancouver a threat. The only team I see a threat are the Calgary Flames. They came out of the deadline thinking they can get the wetsern conference title. I expect wings and sharks in vonference finals and I say wings in 6. It still could be flames and wings and see wings in 6. Western conference also has a rising team in Columbus, who embarassed red wings last saturday, and Chicago. Young talent like kane and toews show chicago is a contender. Khabibulin has finally played a good year, but chicago misses him now.|`|sqeWNMbuaa	As a blindly cheering Canuck fan, heck may be they can. <br>  <br>  But speaking as a reasonable Canuck fan, you shouldn't put your hopes up too high. Some teams are really pushing it for the last few playoff spots. I hope the Canucks keep doing what they have been doing for the last few games for the rest of the season.|`|URHdnHCpaa	I dont think vancouver will come in 1st or 2nd maybe 3rd-8 they will definatly make a layoff spot. Yes there a serious contender i think|`|JEenJYrkaa	They aren't.|`|QsQLXuBzaa	yea and a major threat too.|`|Jb5itwHtaa	Not at all.|`|PNseJW7Qaa	well it depends the cunucks have less losses than the wings. They got a good chance to get past the Wings. The Sharks are already done the Canucks are already better than the sharks. The sharks have 8 more losses than the canucks and the same amount of wins if the canucks and sharks were in the same division the canucks would deffinitly be before them|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	ABSOLUTELY. A goaltender who can STEAL games. A very good defensive corps. A very good checking line. A decent 1st line, especially with Sundin getting his game legs. <br>  <br>   Sure they are.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	NO they are not anyone in that is a Threat to them is either New Jersey or Washington, The Canucks are another western Conference Team that can't Bring down San Jose or Detroit seriously they lost to Calgary who leads them 8 Points even Edmonton has beaten Vancouver they are only 4 Points behind so really they have to Seriously not screw up from here on out.|`|AA11674745	They very well could be. I thought they were poised to be Stanley Cup champs for the 2006-07 season.<br>  <br>  Besides that, I have observed over the years that a team doesn't have to be great at the beginning of the year, hold the league, conference, or division lead all season, and go on to be champs.<br>  <br>  Although that does occur, what the Canucks are doing now could bring them a Cup this year. A hot team is a hot team no matter where they finish the reqular season.|`|8t5vPDnqaa	Absolutely.  Anything can happen in the playoffs, but Luongo is playing great and as you mention, they have three solid lines.  They are absolutely a threat to go to the final, especially the way they've been playing over the last 10 games or so.|`|UkW9FPEZaa	If they can hold up this run and not fall apart near the very end of the season then they will be a big contender out of the West.|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	I don't think so.. But I'm a Wings fan, and have enormous respect for the way the Sharks have played this year..
ZbNXVQu7aa	The Devils can beat the Bruins in a 7-game series, but I wouldn't call that an upset.  In fact, if the Bruins were to win a 7-game series against the Devils, I would call that a mild upset.  If anyone else were to beat the Devils in a 7-game series, that would be a major upset.  Brodeur's injury was a blessing in disguise because it forced the Devils to learn how to score if they wanted to win games.  Now that the Devils know they can score goals, I don't see anyone (East or West) beating them in this year's playoffs.<br>  <br>  As for the rest of the conference, the biggest threat to pull off an upset against the Bruins are the Canadiens.  The Bruins are likely to finish as the #1 seed in the Eastern Conference, and whoever finishes at #8 won't get past them.  The Canadiens are currently the #5 seed, and I can't shake the feeling that they'll come together, climb up to #4 (for home-ice against the #5 seed) and win their first round matchup to set up a Bruins-Canadiens Eastern Conference Semifinal meeting that will be decided by how well Montreal plays.  Anything less than Montreal's best will result in Boston advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals, but if Montreal plays as well as they can, they'll pull off the upset (but if that happens, Montreal won't get past New Jersey).|`|T0pkW783aa	The fabulous, fantastic, amazing, NEW JERSEY DEVILS!!!

yEsw7UkWaa	My dad downloaded the transcript of the doco as I didn't have the internet at the time.<br>  It was an awesome read! Showed a lot of what truly happens in WWE. I still have the transcript, it made that much of an impact on me.<br>  I couldn't understand why it was so hard to allow the guy to leave gracefully. Especially since Vince advised Bret to take WCWs offer...just a shame that Bret never got to say goodbye!<br>  <br>  BQ: Yes HHH knew. What annoys me is that he looked Bret's wife in the eye and told her he was sorry, he didn't know this was going to happen. Then he appears on the HBK DVD laughing about how he helped screw Bret!<br>  GRRRR !!!|`|cd2kXJIvaa	I think it was good to see Bret so expressive like he should have been in his promos.  He is better at himself than his character.  However, I think Bret was in on the screwjob and the film crew was worked.  <br>  <br>  And I'm not sure that Hunter was in on it.  But I think he showed how scummy he was in his conversation with Bret's wife.|`|ULSUqmeZaa	I haven't seen it but I'll be sure to check it out.<br>  Yes Triple H knew about it. He was the one that practically came up with the idea. He actually said "If he won't do business, the we'll do it for him."|`|CaqdDzQZaa	hhh knew all about it and suggest it<br>  it was a good documentary|`|IVEdWA2uaa	Nope, i'll be sure to check it.<br>  <br>  Most likely..he did end up being Vince's son in law.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Yes, I did see it. It was quite interesting and showed a lot about the wrestling world in general and gave some more info regarding the  Monrtreal Screwjob. <br>  <br>  BQ: I do think Triple H had some involvement in the situation. He was very close to Shawn Michaels and he was supposed to have been part of the run-in that was in the original (non screwjob) ending of the match. We didn't see him enter the ring but he did rush Shawn Michaels away so I do think he has some part in it. Still, Vince pulled the trigger on it.
yEsw7UkWaa	I would say no he's not.<br>  The fact that HHH was a legit 7 figure earning wrestler before he got involved with Steph has long been overshadowed by the fact that he obviously gets preferred treatment, especially when it comes to main events.<br>  It's no secret that guys in WWE don't really like him and have often accussed him of abuse of power.<br>  I have read a couple of interesting articles in PowerSlam magazine about HHH lately. One that featured this tid bit that I put on this section last night:<br>  RE: SD vs RAW 2009 game.<br>  WWE is so protective of HHH that it requested no magazines publish pictures of the "animated version" of him appearing vulnerable!<br>  Since this was a WWE directive, many insiders saw this as a meaningful piece of evidence corroborating the "conspiracy" to shove HHH down the throats of the fans, ahead of his co-workers, despite the fact that HHH has his main event push guaranteed until retirement.<br>  (The article went on to explain why HHH may feel the need to protect his spot by holding others down...very interesting)<br>  <br>  The other one was an interview with Randy Orton...and boy did my respect for him just take a leap! I thought Orton would have been tied to HHH's waist, but apparently Orton doesn't even like the man...because of his politics! Orton even respects Cena more than HHH and calls Cena (rather tellingly) a "natural genitic freak..."<br>  Orton told a story about the draft last year and how Umaga was so glad to be on SD,as it meant he got away from HHH. He was joking that Orton would have to put up with HHH. Then when HHH went to SD Orton couldn't help but throw the joke back at his "buddy" Umaga, "You still have to deal with him!" HHH going to SD was the fave draft pick of Orton!<br>  <br>  If you have access to the PowerSlam mags check the articles out...Issues 170 and 172.<br>  <br>  BQ: Taker has a lot of stroke with the guys in the locker room, and it's out of an honest respect for the man. With HHH the respect is more a fear that if they go against him, they'll get fired...it's happened before (Steiner, Angle)|`|L3MkAG6Qaa	Not really. I don't respect him, and I know that a lot of other superstars don't. <br>  <br>  BQ: 'Taker, by far. He is like the dad of the locker room. He knows what do to when it happens, he doesn't demand a title reign, and he's the one to go to when you don't want to lose a title or something.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Probably Not.<br>  From What We Know as Fans , No One Likes Paul.<br>  They May Respect Him , but They Don't Like Him.<br>  And for all the Politicking , Backstabbing , Holding Young Talent Down , Etc.... They Seem to have a Pretty Good Reason for Not Liking Him.<br>  <br>  <br>  BQ - Unquestionably Mark Calaway.<br>  Not Only does Everyone Respect Mark , INCLUDING Paul (although They have Legit Heat) , but Everyone Also Likes Him.

We can only hear what other people tell us, with their biases included.<br>  <br>  BQ: Even though I'm a big fan of Triple H, if I had to take a guess I'd say Undertaker.|`|1JywgkyMaa	there are a lot of wrestlers that  hate hhh,scott steiner even did a shoot on him|`|53986a54fb7e28986e6d815651923852aa	I'm going to be honest with you and put this out there. I don't know HHH. And it's a safe bet that nobody on this site knows him personally either. I can only go by what "credible" wrestling sites such as Wrestlezone report, and shoot interviews by other wrestlers. That's all I'll ever know about the guy. Things at times, seems to add up as far as believing that his backstage influence has a negative impact, but I'll never know for sure. I've read things though. I've gone back to wrestling articles in 2000 and 2001 and traced back rumors about him, and all of them are the same as today's news. There have been internet reports of him having more backstage power than Austin and The Rock combined and that he campaigned to keep the title off of Kurt Angle for a while. I've read stuff though about him having to send Shawn Michaels home around 2001 because of attitude problems. So perhaps there is an upside and downside to HHH playing into politics. Based on what I've read it definitely seems like the negatives outweigh the positives but again I could be wrong.<br>  <br>  BQ: HHH has more power because he works behind the scenes with the McMahons in booking, creative, production and all this other stuff. He's also been said to voice his opinions about younger talent, which gets the attention of management. However, the opinions of most veterans including HHH, Undertaker, and even Randy Orton, are taken into consideration by management because it's up to the wrestlers to judge their peers. But overall, I'd go with HHH.|`|KIOR56r6aa	No, cause he buried talents<br>  <br>  BQ : Taker all the way|`|I1w0HfQbaa	He is a political operator like his mentor Ric Flair. He copied a lot from his idol Ric Flair. Including how to get in the knowhow with the powers-that-be. In this case it is Vince McMahon's daughter Stephanie McMahon. It is a power relationship.Triple-H knows if he is married to Stephanie he will always be in the loop and never lose his top spot in the company. But would I say he is a positive force. Yes he is. But only a positive force for himself. <br>  <br>  There were so many other big names in the WWE who deserved championship status but Triple-H hogged all the spotlight. Remember "Big Poppa Pump" Scott Steiner? He should have been a main eventer. Heck, there was whole storyline about signing the free agent. Will it be Eric Bischoff? Or Stephanie? There was a lot of hype surrounding his debut. And, of course, months into his stay he is Test's manservant and struggling in a feud with a career mid-carder. Goldberg was another casualty of the Triple-H backstage politicking. As to your second question. It is obvious the Undertaker is a legend and an icon but Hunter is married to power. Hunter has more power in the locker room.|`|NZKramllaa	Well alot of us Seem to forget Triple H plays a character on T.V., and alot (Including Myself) take it way too seriously. We let all these Rumors cloud our Judgment of him, without even meeting the man personally. Yea He is married to the Bosses daughter and He uses Politics, So What!. He isn't the first Wrestler to do it and sure won't be the last, Just because he uses them doesn't take the fact away that He puts his body on the Line to Entertain. Like it or Not Triple was a big Contribution to building WWF/WWE. At this Point in his Career, he isn't the Most liked but the most Respected. I can picture him helping and Mentoring Younger talent.<br>  <br>  BQ: Taker, He has a Slightly bigger Career than Triple H, He has been up and down the Same road So many times and Knows what it takes. and that's why I assume alot of Young talent look to him more, for Youthful advice.|`|8TW00N9Daa	The fact is that Triple H is married to the bosses daughter and is very close to the boss, so that means that Triple H has advances that other wrestlers don't.|`|U6tE9LhJaa	No<br>  <br>  BQ: HHH, because he's married to Steph
2a07ddc45364ba987648449ea08c4953aa	You probably won't get as much from Ebay unless you assign it a Buy It Now Price, or make an auction with a reserve.  Even then a lot of players second guess it because of the number of cheap guns listed there.  <br>  <br>  Amazon you can you give it a flat price that you'd be willing to sell it for, but not too many people will see it.<br>  <br>  AirsoftRetreat.com/Classifieds will charge you $1 to post it there, and the listing lasts for 30 days whether it sells or not.<br>  <br>  AirsoftClassifieds.com is one of my favorites because it's just as it says, and airsoft classified website, and anyone who wants to purchase it doesn't have to register to ask you questions or potentially buy it.

MAYBE 1 or 2 people would see it and that's just because Craig's List is localized and noone really searches outside of their personal area.  <br>  <br>  <br>  My advice is this. <br>  Post if on Airsoft Classifieds.  <br>  Give it a few days, if nothing happen try Airsoft Retreat.  <br>  If nothing still happens then post it on eBay with a Buy it now price (don't auction it).  <br>  If you still get nothing after a couple of weeks either list it on eBay as an auction OR sell it in parts (if possible) and cut your losses.|`|6f36240af8847ca83ec28b5f2b425b32aa	<a href="http://www.airsoftclassifieds.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.airsoftclassifieds.com/</a>  Is a big one, Airsoftretreat.com is big too.|`|UuknG7bJaa	The best thing to do is to go on forums and sell it. Arnies-airsoft is probably one of the biggest, but you need 100 posts before you can access the sale thread.  Ebay won't fetch you much because it gets spammed by the ebay stores' crappy guns, and many people on ebay don't know that its good (assuming it is good) craigslist is a good choice as its free, but once again, many people won't buy it because they're clueless and think "thats too expensive, i'll just have myself one of dem 40dollar leet guns).

oJsrGmmPaa	Patrick Roy got fired as a Hab? Interesting piece of alternate dimension history there seeing as how Roy was never a coach, let alone fired, in this one.<br>  <br>  TexHabsFan: Why must you automatically assume that just because your comments doesn't make sense and has little to no relevance about anything, it's "anti-Quebec?" Remember, those who play the "race card" are racist themselves.<br>  <br>  Oh, and the Carbonneau firing surprised me, especially after the 3-1 win against the Stars. Didn't watch the game, but listened to it online and they seemed to play pretty well.|`|FY17j1Ajaa	Seems to be the thing to do. The Pens unloaded Therrien and replaced him with Dan Bylsma. The Rangers fired Tom Renney (finally) and brought in John Tortorella. Both teams have played better. Maybe the Habs are trying to salvage the season with a desparation move.<br>  That is stressful job. An experienced bench boss is needed for the Habs. Larry Robinson maybe?|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Rumours abound that in the last few days that Gainey has talked to Tom Renney, Peter Laviolette and Denis Savard about the job.  <br>  <br>  I find it hard to believe that Therrien would be considered as the Montreal franchise has always had a stance against re-hiring people they've fired.  One of the reasons behind Therrien's firing in the first place was that he and Gainey (who became GM while Therrien was coach) did not have the same same philosophy.....and it was that exact same philosphy that got Therrien fired in Pittsburgh|`|ROWSzTknaa	You have to win or your going to get fired and they can't replace the entire coaching staff. <br>  Patrick Roy was "fired"? Or did he not want to play for the Habs anymore? Still foggy to me . . .<br>  <br>  (Didn't think you actually meant fired. More like he was sulking like a child because he wasn't pulled.)|`|LEQowzHCaa	Yea, it's pretty dumb how they kept all the assistant coaches but fired the head coach.<br>  <br>  I think Pat Quinn or Tom Renney will take over for the Canadians|`|lYnkvRASaa	Interesting, it seemed has if he had lost the room for a while now.  Lity may have something in Denis Savard.  Remember you almost need a French speaker here.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bring back Demers?<br>  <br>  As too keeping the assistants, I assume gainey is taking over for the balance of the season anyway. They may go in the off season.<br>  <br>  LITY: Andre Savard fired Therrien bringing in Claude Julien before Gainey became GM.  Gainey fired Julien a couple of seasons later bringing his guy, Carbonneau.|`|YJi66M5Gaa	This reminds me of when Jersey did it a few games before the end of the season in 2000. I'm sure Montreal is hoping for a similar result.<br>  <br>  In 2000, Lamoriello fired coach Robbie Ftorek with just nine games left in the season. Assistant coach Larry Robinson took over, and the Devils defeated Dallas to win the Stanley Cup.................but the Devils had a duo of Stevens, Niedermayer on the blue line and a guy by the name of Marty Brodeur in goal.|`|r5V3ZNGfaa	Wow, I'd be pretty shocked if the Habs hired Therrien when they fired him. The same GM did, even. EDIT: Oh, LITY beat me to it. That's not the first time, probably won't be the last. :b<br>  <br>  Well, due to the amount of coaches fired already, there are certainly options. Until then, it'll be interesting to see what Gainey will do to get the team some wins in the mean time.
jwm0kQvNaa	That's a tough one.  Unfortunately in today's game, most lineman are based on popularity, not production.  Lineman is such a hard position to quantify... they really don't have stats- other than how many sacks they've given up or penalties are called on them.  Most times, their accolades are based on the rest of the teams stats.<br>  <br>  That said, I think Tra Thomas is one of the best out there.  Statistically, the Eagles run in the middle- upper middle for all positions (on average- they have had some good years).  Their RB's aren't wowers like LT, Larry Johnson, etc. but they have good YPC averages.  He hasn't won a Super Bowl, though... that's an almost sure-fire way to get in.<br>  <br>  I think he'll be a second or third ballot entry.  He definitely could be a first ballot guy, but that depends on who is eligible when he is.  I don't think he'd be able to stand up to any "skill player"- the media types are more wowed by numbers- but he'll definitely get in.  That is, after he's ready to retire.|`|AOA8TJraaa	No theres no such thing as a fall of famer|`|AA10816466	i would say no, he doesn't stand out enough, i don't think he has been part of championship team and lineman is too hard to get in
69v12qj5aa	with all those add ons, i would tally the cost up and be honest with yourself what you could sell it used. don't go to a local shop, they'll just give you half of what it could be sold for. <br>  <br>  i'd personally look on eBay of what people are selling them for, modded as much as yours is. you'll be able to get a lot more for it online than in a shop. that or try networking, there has to be someone looking into getting started in paintball who would love to take it off your hands. <br>  <br>  also, player to player, i'd keep the remote line :) but thats just me....|`|QcmNHRzyaa	im sure you could if you can find somebody that will trade for it.

ZAh8CEoGaa	The thing is we don't know if Gibson plays best in the playoffs he might be or may not. It will be a gamble. But my opinion is play him for 20 or a little bit more minutes. Wally and West are doing great at the SG and Kinsey is not bad but I think he should get some minutes to get his rhythm back.|`|qaz33UnNaa	if they sit him completely for too long, he may lose his touch and not be as effective as he is right now. but if it does work and he still has his shot, it is another weapon for Cleveland|`|jj4ZbtrCaa	Ya i think so. Bench him to get rest and so he stops hurting our team. He hasn't shot the ball well at all and his offensive game is limited. He hurts us the most on D. He can't play D against guards in the nba. So unless he is hitting 3's get him out bc TK can play D even though he isn't scorer. he can provide more than Gibson.|`|GBGcI509aa	Agreed.|`|NaYoqWBOaa	Probably not a bad idea.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	No! Play him. He's feeling great. He even said his toe feels great! We should play him. He's a shooter, he's just lost his touch. He'll get it back.<br>  <br>  I defended LeBron James last year. Why? Because I don't think MVP should be about your teams record. It's all about which player is the most valuable player to his team. Miami can't win without Wade. End of story. His stats are better, he's having a breakthrough season. If I can defend LeBron over Kobe last year, how can I reverse everything I said, and become a hypocrite? <br>  <br>  When Kobe should have won, Steve Nash did. <br>  When LeBron should have won, Kobe did. <br>  When Wade should win it, LeBron or Kobe will.|`|FkFCjYrlaa	I think you're right saying his production has gone down.

EGe0k8P6aa	While the Crosman 1077 is a decent airgun for target shooting and plinking its not really a good option for hunting since like all co2 guns its affected by the ambient temperature. (When the temperature falls below about 60 degrees Fahrenheit the guns point of aim will shift a bit and it will lose some of its power.)  Still if all you want is to teach your younger brother to shoot, this might be a good choice.<br>  <br>  Personally I agree with C_F_45's nomination of the Crsoman 2100b as a better choice for about the same amount of money. The Crosman 2100 is going to deliver more muzzle energy than the 1077 with pellets (9.3 ft-lbs vs. 6.9 ft-lbs) due to its higher muzzle velocity and should be as accurate. Additionally pump air-rifles are generally less expensive than co2 guns in the long run since you don't have to keep buying co2 catridges. The only downside I can see is that the 2100 has to be pumped after each shot. That might get old to a young shooter. Still the advantages of the 2100 out way the disadvantage of having to pump the gun up for each shot, especially if you think your brother might ever be interested in hunting.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  As I thought about it some more, you could add the Daisy 880 to the list of possible guns. While I'm not a huge fan of the 880, it does work and its substantially cheaper than the 2100. I've also heard its a bit easier to pump up. Not sure that I believe that, but... As far as which is better, I think the 2100 is the better gun hands down. Still the Daisy 880 is probably good enough for a beginner to learn on.|`|io83ZknBaa	Remember, you get what you pay for. I bought a Hammerli 177 pellet rifle from pro bass for just under 100. I't a very accurate rifle and it only requires one pump and has a safety. I mounted a $30 dollar gammo scope from ***** which turned this gun into a sniper rifle. I put over 2200 pellets through the barrel and it's still as accurate as new. What ever you get, remember, it's very important to teach your young brother how to shoot safely. They sell pellet traps for under $25; just remember and try to clean it out every time you use it. If you're shooting down the basement you must have at least 30 feet between you and the pellet trap. Also, it is very important to wash your thumb and fingers   and hands, as well as your face. Remember, lead can be "dangerous"  without enough ventilation. You should also get a # 95 respirator and put it over your mouth when sweeping up the floor with pellets and or dust. Don't put your fingers anywhere near your mouth with lead on them. Other than that, have fun. PS don't fire gun empty it could destroy the spring in the cylinder. Read the manual that comes with the rifle and lubricate as necessary.|`|XdmcIuOTaa	get the kid a pump action .22 air rifle..10 pumps and it has the calibre of a .22 and on 1 pump they can run around the yard shooting each other without harm...christ m8..why not get the kid a shotgun?..9 is a bit young m8.|`|39d77d396b6018aac260eb632b7665f9aa	>>Looking for an air rifle for my 9YO brother<<<br>  <br>  I would prefer the Crosman 2100, which is a multi-pump pneumatic, dual-ammo air rifle.<br>  <br>  The variable power, and ability to shoot both BBs and pellets is a big advantage IMO<br>  <br>  Crosman 2100 - specs - reviews<br>  <a href="http://www.pyramydair.com/p/crosman-2100b-air-rifle.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.pyramydair.com/p/crosman-2100...</a><br>  This rifle is also known as the Remington AirMaster 77

Sorry.|`|L3MkAG6Qaa	But you said it yourself...<br>  <br>  "Except for his wrestling skills..."<br>  <br>  You could have everything asked for, but still without wrestling skill, you're not going anywhere. <br>  <br>  And personally, I found Masters to be an overrated superstar with a boring gimmick.|`|rknbEJkzaa	Chris was awesome--definitely my favorite back then.

KwqZmlZRaa	a LOT of people are asking this question so I will post my same answer.<br>  <br>  Well I'll give it a shot. So I'm a sophomore at my high school and started playing tennis about my 7th grade year. Freshman year I posted a question similar to this because i wanted tips on how to make varsity. Well I did and played at #6 for a good school in SoCal (best division in the U.S) and my team this year won our whole division. So take this next bit of advice to heart.<br>  If you haven't played tennis, you can't play tennis. I know that sounds harsh but hear me out, tennis takes time and lots of practice, it's one of the hardest sports there is. Practice, practice, practice. You said you were going to hit a with a friend, i recommend doing it a lot. Be the first one on the courts and the last one to leave. make the coaches think your a coachable kid and show them how much you can improve and listen to what they have to say. ask other players if they want to hit with you over the weekend and maybe see if there are any tennis clinics you can try around your town. Chances are by the end of the season you will be playing much, much better and will still have a LOT of fun. also something I have learned.... sports like football or basketball you stop playing seriously during high school unless your going to play in college and few make it big. Tennis you can play your ENTIRE life!! If you ever goto a tennis club there probably old men playing doubles together and still having a blast! You have your whole life to play tennis and you will grow to be more and more experienced.<br>  hope that helps<br>  <br>  ALSO: since your question is unique...<br>  bring some snacks and hydrate yourself, remain confident, and make sure you warm-up well. chances are you will only play one person maybe two within one practice depending on how long your sets are. know your limits! stay true to yourself, if you know can't make an amazing play or winner against a better player take the safer way out and you will turn out to be a harder opponent.|`|xs9RGfAZaa	ok all you need to do is stay hyrdated and ohnestly warm up  ( having a hit with someone before your try outs you play your best warm and those kids will just be comming non warm or anything but youll have an advantage|`|PZYOTy2Haa	Breathe. Especially before serving, take a moment to steady yourself, and don't be afraid to not hit the ball if you have thrown it off.<br>  <br>  Drink frequently. Lucosade, water, what have you. This will keep your nerves down as well as hydrating you.<br>  <br>  Don't beat yourself up about any of it. If you do a dud shot, realise why you did it and focus a little harder.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|h82RODkraa	Just be confident in yourself that you are good enough to make it and if you don't, don't worry, you'll get more chances. Make sure you don't keep worrying as this will waste anxiety and try to have good carbohydrate meals such as chicken or pasta. When you play relax and be confident in your abilities.|`|CS6hjZxqaa	<a href="http://www.fuzzyyellowballs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fuzzyyellowballs.com/</a><br>  <br>  Need to sign up but it's FREE.

But I look for the Magic to come in and get a W. <br>  <br>  Bulls @ Heat- I gotta go with the Heat, they are a great home team and they are going up against a team that has a road record of 10-23. <br>  <br>  Wizards @ T-Wolves- These games are always hard to predict, since these two teams are both having down years you really don't know who is gonna come out on top, but I'm gonna take a wild guess and say T-Wolves since they are at home. <br>  <br>  Rockets @ Nuggets- Nuggets have been struggling as of late, and I look for this to continue, I look for the Rockets to come in and keep on playing well. <br>  <br>  Lakers @ Blazers- First of all, this Blazers team is really good. It will be really exciting seeing Roy vs Kobe match-up. The Lakers also haven't won in Portland in such a long time.

WZvny7mMaa	The Lakers have a good chance of winning at least 65 games this season. With the way that they have been playing this season, I believe that they can do it.|`|onvpwieHaa	In order to win 65 games. They will have to go 15 - 5 in the next 20 games. <br>  <br>  I can see the Lakers doing that. So I will say yes.|`|YQLNqgnWaa	they will win 67|`|bmL7Ryw2aa	Yes they will.  probably more than 65 wins.|`|ZCHmhuFQaa	Change 65 wins to 70. The Lakers will win more than that.

BLWxEdrMaa	The Chinese Kung Fu systems including the word "Iron" all do what you are asking.  Iron head, Iron vest, Iron palm, Iron shirt - all these are ways to train to toughen the body so that it is a defense and weapon at once.  However, when it comes to being resilient and striking with any part of the body, I must also recommend any of the traditional drunken systems.  Their masters do strike with great power with any part of their body, but the technique is largely internal striking, versus hardening of the body like in the 'Iron' systems.<br>  <br>  Happy hunting,<br>  <br>  Grandmaster David A.

So being strong by itself is the original MA that all the rest MA was set to fight against.<br>  <br>  Now if you are asking what style makes your body resistant to damage try original okinawan karate, kyokushin karate, boxing, or Muay Thai.|`|AA11101806	there aren't any that only rely on strength.<br>  <br>  .|`|GSCD9vq3aa	no one that I know of|`|VXdW4Lpwaa	if you do anything with pure strength and no technique you risk great bodily injury to yourself.

XCwjsfz2aa	Desperation, on the part of Wilson. "Im not getting any younger, and I want a championship" was his words. In the locker room....hmmm....on the field? Well, we shall see. The only real question are the drops he has, other than that, he will help the offense, especially Lee Evans.|`|CL7OTeiCaa	Both good and bad. He is a cancer. It is known by all. He could very well be a bad influence to a team that has a lot of young players on it. But, he is a talented wide receiver who is better than all of the Bills receivers combined. Him and Lee Evans will. be good compliments to each other and help each other out. I first thought this move was bad, but now listening to the facts I have to say it is overall a good move.|`|5d79dc29abe4955a299c6732d5425041aa	B.I.L.L.S.<br>  <br>  Boy<br>  I<br>  Love<br>  Losing<br>  Superbowls!|`|PA7kYyAxaa	it bad, very bad|`|VU6ODC5Baa	Good,I think he will help the team.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	i think it will turn out to be a manic move. there will be very high highs when edwards and owens are connecting and then very low lows when they are not and owens is screaming like a banshee.|`|6S8KjBLQaa	It was, because how could it hurt? Bills haven't made the playoffs since the 90's, and it isn't like we are most likely to succeed in the AFC East..we pick up TO for one year..what could go wrong..he acts "drama queen esque" and we leave him next year. No harm done! But TO won't do any more damage than Marshawn! TO has something that nobody else on the bills have..talent! He'll be good for them, and I'm so stoked the Bills have em!|`|HtYGxZcCaa	To me good move. Its only a 1 year deal so hell be playing for a contract again and maybe his career offseason.<br>  <br>  The Bills dont really have anything to lose they've played poorly down the stretch last year and this may be their best chance to improve their team. Now Lee Evans doesnt have to get double teamed and with already a strong run game they can open more things up in the passing game.<br>  <br>  I think this move definately improves the Bills|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	It would be desperate if it were a long-term deal. <br>  <br>  With a 1-year contract, who cares?

kzYdVfifaa	Let's make sure we agree here. They are both huge distractions. Having one would do bad, but if I had to choose, and that's a big HAD then i'd have to go with Ocho Cinco.<br>  <br>  From personal opinion, I believe Ocho Cinco (his legal name) has the same talent as T.O. Less of a distraction and doesn't completely disturb and fight with your quarterback. You havent' heard of Ocho fightng with Carson Palmer. T.O consistently fights with QB's starting back with Jeff Garcia, Donovan McNabb and Tony Romo. NFL teams haven't come out with a list with 27 NFL teams saying we don't want you.|`|e9065dfa2249178c642f3f273c9dbb1caa	i would rather have ocho cinco because he is younger and because he doenst have many isssues|`|CL7OTeiCaa	Johnson, because he has more gas in the tank. He still has maybe 3-5 years left. Owens only has 1 or 2. Both are good receivers though.|`|vSTihS5uaa	I would take TO over ocho cinco any day! Put a muzzle on his big mouth and through to him 20 times a game! Chad who?  What has he done lately! Interesting question though!|`|AOA8TJraaa	Ocho Sinco is WAY better at least he dosent drop like every ball|`|PaWcj0AIaa	I would rather have T.O. because at least he performs on the field.|`|nMZqHaqCaa	That's a hard question but I will take Chad|`|0093382286e191b54fe019326d1aa456aa	TO|`|fYglHsVKaa	I would WANT Ocho Cinco.<br>  <br>  He brought attention to the bengals...he's a player people love.<br>  <br>  i LOVE the guys who do things for attentions, do great end zone celebrations, and enjoy the game.|`|6ZbAM4Jaaa	Johnson might not always play as well but he's not gonna tear the team down like TO has everywhere he's been. So Johnson|`|bJXrQexmaa	not T.O he stinks like poop!|`|6pTsVznPaa	Honestly, I don't want either of them. Guys like that are a distraction to the entire team. Not to mention extremely annoying.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	i would take chad at this point , i do think with a new team he would be a positive effect on the game , i think owens will have good games tooo but has a bigger downside.|`|7RziqsDcaa	Well, my favorite team has gotten rid of anything close to a receiver, so I'll be glad to have either one as my team's first, second, and third receiver.<br>  <br>  Why didn't the Bears take TJ Housh!!!|`|HtYGxZcCaa	Chad Johnson, I think Chad has actually grown up, he even said he was wrong and made a stupid mistake and even admitted to being immature last summer. TO is reaching the end of his career, Chad Johnson still has some time.<br>  <br>  And "ocho cinco" is not 85 in spanish lol, its only "8 and 5", 85 is "ochentacinque".<br>  <br>  Chad Johnson would be the better bet because hes less of a problem and I may be proven wrong but I think hes matured alot|`|ubGNtkHQaa	Chad Johnson<br>  <br>  He's not as much of a distraction and can actually catch the ball.|`|bmL7Ryw2aa	I would rather have T.O. because at least he performs on the field.|`|OeFNGqbzaa	did anyone say my name?
uM2IZBobaa	Do NOT wear your boxers under your swim suit.  Men's suits have an internal modesty panel if you are going for the jammers or briefs, and have an internal mesh brief for board shorts.  That is all you need.|`|e6194ade1f407494b6f0be00450abb7caa	Its a stupid fashion thing. Makes them look cool, idk. Yes i have never worn boxers while swimming and have no plans on ever doing so. It is stupid, it just goes straight into your money maker, and you are uncomfortable. Plus it is just another thing to carry that is wet with you around. I took swimming class in PE last year, and recall only a few kids doing that. Im a swimmer, and see no reason on why a person would do that other than looks.|`|yk6Kg0aOaa	Go head wear them anyway I do and I love the wetness after I get out and the wetness the rest of the day it is the best feeling ever it is good to wear something on your feet while you shower though so you don't get any fungus on your feet.|`|7933BVwtaa	Well girls don't wear their underwear under their swimsuits.

If the extra kick doesn't bother you, go for the 300.<br>  <br>  Good Hunting...|`|datmqg7Aaa	It is a great deer round if you are shooting 250yds+,but it is overkill for shots under 250yds .So if you are shooting under 250yds a 270,270wsm,30-06,7mm-08 or a 308 would be a better choice.Cause 9 times out of 10 the bullet from a 300wsm will just leave a very small entry and exit wound if you shoot a deer from less than 200 yards and the small wound made by the bullet will make tracking the deer even more difficult.|`|VP48PjM9aa	I completely agree, get a .243 Win.  Will absolutely put the smack down on ANY deer, at ranges beyond the abilities of most hunters.  Most shots will be less than 100 yards anyway, especially if you do your homework.  Cool thing though, a .243 Win. will cleanly harvest a Whitetail out to 400 yards.  I do not know about you but I do not shoot past 300.  The more you go out past 200 the smaller the margin of error becomes, with any caliber.  You can also find ammo anywhere.|`|rWYp4ekeaa	Yeah i would say its a lil bit of an overkill,<br>  i would suggest getting something like a 243. win for whitetail or what i personally love and use is the 270. win.<br>  I use the 270. win on moose and caribou mainly and whitetail and coyote every once in a while|`|hoZnJVXXaa	It is more than what you need.  But if it is a good shot, you will not destroy too much of the front legs.  Just don't"Texas Heart" shoot the deer, and try to avoid a quartering shot where you will destroy the front quarter.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and happy hunting|`|roN1C0xJaa	No i dont think its an overkill it just depends what grain you use. It is great for elk and moose|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	Yes, it's overkill, but don't let that dissuade you. Once Elmer Kieth was chastised for using too much gun, and he responded, "You mean you can kill 'em TOO dead?" The problems are there, but they can be overcome by careful planning. It will be a little challenging if you're relying on factory loads, but not too much trouble at all if you handload. In either case, you can manage, and you'll have a fine elk and moose rifle for later.<br>  Pardon me if I'm wrong, but I have it in mind that your experience is a little limited. Keep asking questions. I pointed out in my answer to your earlier question some of the problems you'll need to be careful about, and if you keep asking, you'll be fine.|`|xOReEw6Waa	I have a 300 WSM, and I like it because I hand load. Buying factory ammo at $40+ a box is pretty pricey. I have a 30-06 also, both Browning, and I would rather shoot the 30-06 over the 300. It isn't that much more recoil, it just jumps back faster. I would actually choose the 30-06 for almost every situation because it does everything the 300 does and it is a joy to shoot. My 11 year old has actually shot the 30-06 before.<br>  <br>  As for cartridge performance on game, any of the 30 calibers will work for deer,elk,moose and bear. The short action cartridges like the 308 and 300 WSM limit your bullet selection to 180 grains, but that is good up to even grizzly size animals,though not my choice for it. The long action 30-06,300 Win and the 300 H&H or Weatherby cartridges give you more flexibility on the upper end of bullet selection to 220 grains. Since I use 165 grain for both my 30 calibers and would never worry about taking shots on elk at 400 yards (if needed) it comes down to bullet selection and your recoil tolerance. <br>  <br>  I love the 30-06s I've used over the years, from Dad's 725 BDL to the old Springfield I bought when I was 14 to my Browning A-Bolt. I'm comfortable shooting it all afternoon without being too sore in the mornings after too.The 300 isn't as forgiving on the recoil and pad/shoulder placement. I can shoot the 300 well enough, but I'm not as proficient with it as the 06 because I don't enjoy it as much. <br>  Both rifles are well within Minute of Arc accuracy, and again, I trust both out to realistic hunting ranges, but the 30-06 does everything the 300 does with less recoil and only minor losses in ballistics.<br>  The 300 WSM is the rifle to use if you are constantly making 200+ yard shots, but the 30-06 will not be that far behind it in speed and performance in a real hunting situation. <br>  You hit an elk or other animal with a bullet from either rifle and the beast won't know the difference. <br>  As for other cartridges to look at, the 270 Win is capable of elk and moose but I'd hesitate to use it on large bear. 6.5x55 Swede works equally well on game out to 200 yards, but will drop off after that more than the full powered 30 calibers. <br>  Everything being equal, I would opt for the 30-06 over the 300 WSM; I got my 300 WSM as a gift and I like it, but I love the 30-06.<br>  Bullet choice is important here, not the cartridge, so if you use a good quality BONDED or controlled expansion bullet such as the Barnes, Nosler Partitions or Accu-Bonds, Bonded Bear Claws, Sierra Game Kings and similar bullets you will be fine. You want bullet performance that keeps the most mass intact but expands to use up all the energy from the bullet inside the animal--if the bullet exits or fragments then you end up with a bad hunting experience. <br>  <br>  I reload, so I look at bullet performance tables and articles all the time, more so than the ballistics of a cartridge with a know performance envelope.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	It is more then is needed but not overkill, I don't look down on folks who use a .338 mag on our typically 150lb blacktail, in fact the damage isn't much worse then my .30-06 when both of us used partitions.<br>  <br>  Any cartridge at similar velocity with lightly constructed bullets can destroy a large amount of meat. I've seen the results from 130gr sp loads in a .270 at 40yds, whole shoulder was blood shot and inedible. I'd suggest using 165-180 grain bullets like the Partition, Accubond, Trophy Tip and TSX for deer with any .30 cal magnum. They work very well for anything from pronghorns to elk even at .308 Win./.30-06 speeds.|`|TBAfpnmgaa	It won't "rip a deer to shreds", just punch a really big hole in one. If you  are planning to hunt bigger game like moose or elk later, the wsm may be OK, but for deer, a well placed shot from a .243, .30-30, or .270 will all do the trick, and you'll have a lot smaller mess, and more venison for the freezer.|`|TPZwmQK9aa	I would say it's overkill for whitetails.  I also think the 30-06 is overkill.  No details to give, as it's only my opinion that it's too hot a round a too big a bullet.  I have found the .243 to be a one shot deer stopper over the last 25 years of deer hunting with one.|`|Ok3XlTV3aa	Yes it's too big for whitetails.  For other big game it could be perfect.  It's really just an opinion.  I'd say .270, .243, or .30-06 are better for whitetail.
o7gV56ngaa	Because they can't play it. Americans only like sports that they are the best at. They know that they can't compete with the rest of the world so why bother. It's much easier to just ignore the game than admit that you are no good at it. Even though it's the world game. America is a very shallow country.|`|N9XEvwQLaa	You could always state the obvious that there is little or no scoring.  Translate to “boring” for Joe Six Pack. But, I’m going to go with there is absolutely no contact or physical violence.  Americans like hard hitting action like blocking, hard tackling, and colossal big hits.  As a result, we like the NFL and college football not professional soccer. <br>   <br>  In addition, we like our heroes to be tough.  If you look at any game in the English Premier League or Germany’s Bundesliga, you see players roll around in pain and cry like little girls at the slightest foul.  How can you look up to that?!? If players in the NFL pulled that crap, their manhood and toughness would be highly questioned by coaches, fans, and the media.  In fact, conservative radio talk-show pundits would say that the country would be in serious moral decline. <br>  <br>  Pauly|`|iHjD7Nj7aa	yeah i do hate this question, kids at my school make fun of the soccer players, they have far from enough knowledge to know that it is a beautiful game.

ModuhBDIaa	I agree with you that Spectrum sucks.  But the card companies justified the high price of products like Spectrum with serial cards, gimmick cards, memorabilia cards, and autographs.  Thus in theory the more the box cost the greater the chance of getting a bigger hit.  But more often than the collector is screwed with some boring jersey cards and an autograph of a no- named player.  Spectrum is especially bad since one of the guarantee hits is of a D-list celebrity. If you wait the price of products like spectrum with fall after the first month or so.<br>  <br>  BTW I like the base set of Upper Deck and the inserts.  The cards have a good design and the insert makes things interesting. <br>  <br>  All in all the new world of cards is that commons don't mean much and it is all about the hits (1/1s, autographs, stupid gimmicks).|`|3mZyMnjfaa	hell your buying the wrong cards go with topps only things that are worth anything

I don't go looking for trouble. In fact, I go out of my way to avoid trouble. Pulling out a gun and firing at people who you are unsure are cartels, plain-clothes police officers, or an innocent person in the wrong place at the wrong time is just asking for trouble.|`|EDc2Ipe6aa	If you really want to fight the drug cartels , don't buy any drugs & do your best to discourage others. In a capitalist society if there is a demand someone will always supply. Although this has nothing to do with hunting.|`|fUDlbOP0aa	sounds like red dawn. sort of. without the nukes and military (drug cartels are just really rich and heavily armed gangsters).<br>  <br>  if they're threatening my home, my stuff or my loved ones, I will fight against them. sorta prepared for it actually, just much more red dawn type situation than gangsters invading. Or zombies.<br>  <br>  If the Mexicans go around killing Americans at American border towns which I live 125 miles away from, I'm willing to drive over there with my guns and ammo to go help defend American lives. Better stop it there than before it spill over further inland. Like California, where I live. only 3% owns guns, all 97% are totally defenseless. if the Mexicans take San Diego, it'll be a week tops before they own all of California (again, 160 years later).|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	I will but it won't. Because unlike the mexican military and politicians you cannot bribe the citizens of this country.<br>  <br>  There is a fear instilled into the though process of other countries about he we would react. We are armed, more heavily than the military. Sure they have nicce gadgets that we can't own, like full auto's and explosives. But we have ourt own things that the military does not use, plus sheer numbers, and a mindset of one who would die for freedom. And then adding to that who makes their ****? Similar to a soldier but will fight even then if it comes down to it. And we will fight if need be. Enemies foreign and domestic. If there was a credible military threat to America's lands you wouldn't need a draft. Maybe that's why other countries are so hellbent on disarming us.

Whatever it takes to make the decision more accurate.<br>  <br>  People say how the predictive element of hawkeye is not always accurate. Well, it's more accurate than what we already have and so that is a step forward. Also, when it is obviously wrong, the umpire should be able to overrule it.<br>  <br>  A lot of flak has been placed on the TV umpires for getting decisions wrong. Let me state the job description and advice given to them:<br>  <br>  The TV umpire is there to HELP and ADVISE the on field umpire by looking at the replays and then reporting back to the on field umpire. The on field umpire then makes the decision - the TV umpire does NOT make the final decision.<br>  <br>  Also, when determining what advice to give to the on field umpire, the TV umpire must be in the mind set that the on field umpire got the decision correct in the first place. Therefore, when seeing the replays, for the TV umpire to advise the on field umpire to change his decision, he must be able to say with a high degree of confidence and with good evidence that the on field umpire is wrong.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  That system will take some a while to get used to and the more technology used, the better the system will work.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bottom line: Give it time.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	I'm not really in favour of it but it does look like it is going to be with us. My only real complaint is with LBWs. With LBWs referral should only be used for checking if the ball hit the bat first and was the ball pitched in line or not. Because of the physical aspects of height and bounce, this should be left with the field umpire.<br>  <br>  Curious, in the Aus v SA series, the teams are only allowed two referrals each, not three.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	I agree its not working.<br>  The idea was good, but we need <br>  <br>  the rest of the technology: hot spot and snicko.<br>  <br>  We need competent umpires.<br>  <br>  And we need players who respect the system and don't try to manipulate it.|`|403a76a591bc07b10b1a689c061b508daa	crap.|`|uuHrf7cGaa	The way the current referral system is put in place - it is prone for blunders. It makes a mockery of the current state of affairs in the game. Why in the hell do we need Referral System if we are not going to use the current available technology? Irrespective of how good or bad it is, the idea or notion is to make correct calls or close to it. Having partial technology without its full usage is useless and boring and bound for comedians act easy. Whatever current technology we have - just use it as we go on we can correct them and let the boards, players, umpires all agree to it and go by what the Umpires say or use the technology for the fullest extent and implement them. For the 3rd/TV umpire he needs to be provided with all the tools to help and giving half empty glass is not the answer. <br>  Also - if and when the complete technology is implemented - each team or innings need to have a minimum of 3-5 incorrect calls given that there are 11 batsmen. Umpires are human beings and they make mistakes too. So if ICC technical committee is listen - either implement the full technology even if it is not 100% accurate or just with the on field umpires. Looks to me ICC wants it reinvent the wheel and they are prone to killing the game and the entire series.<br>  <br>  So many decisions made specifically in this WI-Eng series - makes me laugh - specially when they are referred to the TV ump. Pathetic and disgust.....When the entire fan base calls for it - why is ICC sleeping - oh they are promoting their own cause.|`|Qr9UFnIuaa	As u said, if it is used you need to use it 100%. Similarly all the technologies like Hawk-eye (full dimension), snicko, lens (zoom) and hotspot .... must be used in getting correct decisions. But, I think 2 is enough which makes players also to be exact in going for that.<br>  <br>  Having said that, I will support the statement that "hawk-eye suggests many times the ball will hit the stumps". To overcome this they need to make a decisions wisely like, if it suggests that the ball hits on top of the stumps like very near to bails or on the outer edges of stumps on either sides, that should be ruled batsman favor, else they can give that out.|`|SzBlX4Vpaa	Ian Bishop summed it up the best - nobody has an issue with cricket using technology to improve the sport but you should only bring it into a test match when it is tested, finalised and ready to work. Changing as the game develops (late on day 4 the 3rd umpire was given sound and pictures for the first time, so have more information than on both first innings) is nothing short of a farce.<br>  <br>  Also, England lost 3 overs of batting at the the end of day 4 due to the clock reaching the close of the day and time lost to referals, at the 5 an over that we were going at thats 15 runs more and may well have seen us put WI in beofre lunch - these overs don't get made up at the end (even though there was enough light to have bowled them), stop slowing the game down and kets help teams get reults.|`|WCX6kYITaa	In SA vs Australia teams are allowed 3 refferals. I understand why they can't have too many but it's still BS. The refferal system officially acknowledeges that the umpire is susceptible to error. But by allowing teams only three refferals, the implication is that every other time all decisions are at very least questionable.|`|Vv465eJMaa	l love it.It went wrong because WI TV didn't have hot spot or snickometer.<br>  <br>  Umpires make too many awful decisions.Each team should be allowed 3 incorrect referrals and unlimited correct ones as in tennis.<br>  <br>  It makes for exiting watching and the uncertainty is great,but it needs polishing up.|`|ftYPJSEdaa	rubbish, no machine can replace humans.

m8TEeMpAaa	Dang kid you have no clue. Rashad is nice right now, but Anderson is on another planet. Anderson destroys people, Rashad only has 5 ko's and 7 fights where he just laid on top of the guys. He should of lost TUF finale, and he should of lost the Tito fight but he lost a point for grabbing the fence. You might be a hardcore fan but its clear you don't know "whats up" when it comes to MMA. Take it from someone who actually knows MMA and doesn't just watch it on TV kiddo. Poser|`|oeQVK0cmaa	Silva would finish Rashad in the 1st round as well as his career!|`|AA11517536	I like Rashad.  I think people hate him because he seems to be cocky at times.  He's no where near as cocky as BJ Penn IMO.<br>  <br>  update: Matt Hughes is a washed-out jackass.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Because he's an ***.<br>  <br>  Great fighters don't showboat. They let they're fighting do the talking.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	I think there is hate for him from different people for different reasons.<br>  <br>  1. he has the belt. There are always haters for the guy on top of the food chain.<br>  <br>  2. he wasn't known as a finisher. He took guys down a lot but just controlled his fights to victories. As many people can see now this is not true.<br>  <br>  3. he is not great at any one aspect. He is very very well rounded and I think this leads people to believe that he is not good at all.<br>  <br>  4. some people absolutely hate trash talking even though every fighter does it so the person that is seen doing it right now always gets bashed for it.|`|MCB1ovEtaa	Because he's kind of socially awkward in my opinion and he show cases him self in this kind of attitude where he's like "i'm the ****, and i'm always right, and no one can beat me"...<br>  <br>  **** that guy probably thinks he can beat Fedor|`|R0J1W3BCaa	Rashad has been one of my favorite fighters since TUF But Rampage has been one of my Favorites years before I know of Rashard.<br>  <br>  I like when they had the Stair down saturday and Rampage Say's "its going to be some Black on Black crime".(LMAO)|`|MM8rqTMtaa	The reason I didn't like the guy was his performance on the Ultimate Fighter.  He did kinda suck.  The more I see him lately, the more I like him.<br>  No way he'd beat Silva though.|`|5TIX6PH3aa	There are several reason.  First, he came off of The Ultimate Fighter.  All of the guys coming off that show faced a lot of backlash from the hardcore fans because they felt those fighters were heavily promoted, given easy match-ups, and did deserve the coverage and press they got for being on a tv show.<br>  <br>  Secondly, Rashad has a habit of showboating and talking trash.  Some people felt he hadn't accomplished enough to act that way.  Matt Hughes got on him during TUF for acting that way, he talked constantly after his fight with Tito Ortiz even though he would have lost the fight if a point wasn't deducted for Tito grabbing the fence, he did his whole crotch grab during the Forrest fight, etc.<br>  <br>  Finaly, earlier in his career he didn't finish fights and would simply hold his opponents down to get the decision.  He is getting better in this area but he has to erase those memories.<br>  <br>  And just as a FYI...Rashad fights at 205 lbs and walks around much heavier than that.  While Anderson Silva is MW champ (185lbs) and walks around close to 200lbs.  There are in different weight classes and won't compete.|`|FPuFDrZDaa	Personally- I like Evans. I came to martial arts from a wrestling background as well; so I tend to relate to the wrestling based fighters. But Rashad has become so well-rounded; that I really don't see why people hate on him. He does tend to be a bit of a showboat... but who isn't? Everybody has a little celebration win they win a fight- St. Pierre's backflip/spinarooni thing, Silva plays air guitar, B.J. Penn licks his opponents' blood off his gloves for God's sakes! Not to stereotype- but I honestly think alot of it is racial. The UFC's target demographic is 18-25 yr. old white men; and this group tends to be of lower class income, and thus (usually) all around lower class in general (I believe the slang term is white trash); and it prob. didn't help that he KO'd their hero Liddell. Of course that's not everybody's reason; but I'd be willing to bet u that half the people that dislike Rashad Evans, also use the "N" word at least once a week... <br>  BTW- Many people used to refer to Ali the same way; but they still paid to see him fight... so who's winning that battle, Billy Bob?<br>  : p|`|SM6qHDKeaa	i don't hate him, far from it actually. he's a very skilled fighter and talented athlete. he seems like a very personable individual outside the cage and respectful of his opponents. however, during fights his attitude hints of disrespect and his mannerisms are very annoying.  i still believe he is in the top 5 lhw bracket and i would like to see him do well though|`|ETurhACOaa	I think its because he doesn't represent MMA, he has not once attempted a submission in his UFC career, or maybe it could be because he defeated Forrest Griffin who has always been a fan favorite|`|S0N3BRecaa	Lol no he hasn't beat Silva.

8e35cfeded3c3b900607388410347b4caa	Since you're not racing,  all you really need is the basics, without worrying too much about grams of weight.   <br>  <br>  Pedals:  I'd suggest the "campus" shown below.  Regular pedal on one side, SPD clip on the other.   So you can use cycling shoes for your longer rides, regular shoes for the quick trip to the Post Office or a friend's house.  <br>  <br>  Shoes: Again, basics should be fine, but as a long time endurance athlete, I'm reluctant to recomend buying ANY shoe without first trying it on to make sure the fit is right.   If you watch the specials, you may be able to do even better on price than shown below.|`|Y3KMLdjWaa	For day to day casual riding don't bother with clipless pedals. When you get to the point where you decide to do serious off-road or road riding you might want to consider them them. But for 10~ 15 miles on paved streets, no.|`|xxq5JAM6aa	Clipless pedals are nice to have but certainly not essential. They do let you improve your pedaling efficiency a little, especially if you're spinning at 70-90 rpm or riding on rough trails. But toe clips will do the same and no special shoes required. Just not as cool.<br>  <br>  Clipless do let you pull the pedal as well as push. Can be useful when climbing after you train your muscles and remember to.<br>  <br>  Clipless do have a bit of what I call fiddle factor. Special shoes and getting clipped in and remembering to unclip. The shoes are not very good for walking much.<br>  <br>  Generally, I prefer to pedal in my SPDs in spite of their inconvience.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	I would get a set of pedals with clips first and see if you like them.  It would be the cheapest way to find out.  You can do a search on line or get a pair at the local bike shop, they run about $12-$22.<br>  <br>  You can go with SPD shoes for around $40 and pedals for $40  that is about the cheapest you can get away with.  Clips come with the pedals.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nashbar.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?partNumber=YS-MT31&catalogId=10052&storeId=10053&cm_mmc=Email-_-Nashbar-_-090309Mo-_-Daylight&cm_em=sailerbob2000@yahoo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nashbar.com/webapp/wcs/stores...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.treefortbikes.com/88_333222333909__PD-M520-Clipless-Pedals.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.treefortbikes.com/88_33322233...</a>
jsn4gBpPaa	yea for sure your never to old or young to start racing one suggestion from me is that you must buy good protective gear i men knee braces kneck braces armour good helmet one that fitts you properly good boots gloves because racing is quite different to just riding around you are pushing at 100 per cent and it is really hard to ride at 100 per cent when you are really tired and you start to make silly mistakes for example one time after about 3 laps i over jumped this big tabletop and almost had a massive crash <br>  getting trained professionally will probably be expensive but i know of places where you can go to courses where they teach you how to race dont worry there advanced courses the one that i went to was called y aim thats in australia and the trainers were lyndon heffernan who was national champ and many pro motorcross riders|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	You'll never know unless you give it a try. Actually now is a good time to start since you have 2 more years you can race the 85 class. It is a bit harder when you have to start out on a big bike. You can race the 12-15 class the next couple years to see how you do and if you have a passion for it. If so then you can move to the Lites class. Good luck man, it's the best sport in the world!!|`|b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	There are classes and sections for every ability in mx racing.  So you could easily start to race now and enjoy the sport.  <br>  <br>  Just don't aim too high as those who turn professional usually have been racing since they were around 4 years old and are by 14 well on their way to becoming professionals.<br>  <br>  That doesn't mean there is not a place for you in the sport and it is a lot of fun.<br>  <br>  Most tracks have their own coaches and would be able to steer you in the right direction to getting training.<br>  <br>  Just look up tracks in your area<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wheretomx.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wheretomx.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://ama-cycle.org/" rel="nofollow">http://ama-cycle.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dirtwerkz.com/Pages/tracks/tracks.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dirtwerkz.com/Pages/tracks/tr...</a>

Z5xgSATSaa	Spd cleats are pretty tough, and they designed for off road use. They are not likely to wear out on a spin bike. That said, fixed gears put unusual stresses on pedals, which is why elite track riders often still use toe clips and straps to avoid pulling out. If the pedals are adjusted to the lowest tension, it is no surprise that you pulled out, it was bound to happen eventually. If you are riding that hard, the release tension on your spin bike should be higher. Unless your cleats are very old and worn, it is doubtful that they are the problem, most issues with release have something to do with the pedals, not the cleats|`|DOVbF4Piaa	The tension is adjusted on the pedals, where you riding the same bike ?  Check for wear on the cleats and that they are tight and straight.  If the cleat is skewed a little they may come out quicker then expected.  I would stay away from the bike you were riding until you figure out what happened.|`|mJFgCvYlaa	The answer was the pedals were all set to the lowest release tension in the spinning class, since the class wants to set the pedals to release with the least effort so people new to them can get out easily. If you had the instructor to set them to higher tension, then it won't get snapped out by accident when you're pedaling. To adjust, use a torque wrench and turn the dial toward the + sign to raise the tension. <br>  <br>  A good suggestion to check your cleats too, as one time my cleats did came loose so I could not release my foot while at a stop light at a steep downhill!
d11198287fd025ed5755e805b28b06adaa	Cooking oil is the best. Put alot of the oil all over the glove. More on the palm side. Since u want it for softball get a softball place it in the pocket,get a large rubber band(s) one for the the finger tips, one for the knuckles and the other is for the heal. let it sit that way for 48 hrs. Then have someone play hard catch with u using your new oiled glove. After catch is done with, lightly oil the palm side of the glove and rewrap for 24 hrs. Your glove will be broken in. after using it u should oil it once a week to keep the leather soft and to advoid the folding crease. Do not use a toel and any other kind of wrap on the glove after oiley it up as the matrial will be absorb in the fabric. That is why rubber bands are the best. Hope this helps|`|Y9yRGPpLaa	Put a ball (doesn't matter if it is a softball or regular, but preferably a regular ball) anyway, Put a ball in your glove, take an elastic and put the elastic around your glove with the ball inside, leave it for a week or two and Ta-Daa!!

LiBZKwlEaa	I am a die-hard Steelers fan and I agree 100%.  If the Steelers 1970's team played today.  The stats would be unbelievable and more importantly they would be virtually unstoppable.  Terry Bradshaw would put up unbelievable numbers with Lynn Swann and John Stallworth and Franco Harris would destroy other teams run defense.  Plus, the Steel Curtain defense would destroy the other teams offense and they would win against any team.  The 2008 Steelers had a very good defense but it doesn't even come close to as good as the 1970s Steelers defense.  Plus the offense for the 2008 Steelers wasn't as good as the 1970s offense.  So the 1978 Steelers would win without question.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Swann in my opinion is the most overrated player in NFL history.  I mean the guy is in the HOF with numbers like this?  Come on.  Ill list his stats below. I know nobody will agree, thats nothing new, but the stats dont lie.  The 70s team would destroy the 08 team though  in my personal opinion. I think it would be 28-10<br>  <br>  1974 12 games 11 receptions 208 yards receiving   2 tds <br>  1975         14 games  49 receptions 781 yards receiving  11 tds<br>  1976         12 games  28 receptions 516 yards receiving   3 tds<br>  1977         14 games  50 receptions 789 yards receiving   7 tds<br>  1978         16 games  61 receptions 880 yards receiving   11 tds<br>  1979         13 games  41 receptions 808 yards receiving    5 tds<br>  1980         13 games  44 receptions 710 yards receiving   7 tds<br>  1981         13 games  34 receptions 505 yards receiving   5 tds<br>  1982         9 games    18 receptions 265 yards receiving   0 tds|`|OeFNGqbzaa	haha are you kidding me? theres no way the 2008 steelers will have a chance against the 1978 team. they barely won against the cards|`|Gva0qq3Yaa	Having watched both teams as I have been a Bengals fan since birth -- no contest.<br>  <br>  78 Steelers win 35-13.<br>  <br>  Remember it was tougher to pass against the 70s defenses (5-yard rule was not in effect until 1979) but TB throws 1 to Stallworth and 1 to Randy Grossman because Swann gets KO'd (again) in the second quarter with a concussion.  Harris runs for 125 behind Webster, Kolb, Brown and the rest.<br>  <br>  Defense -- Lambert owns the middle and injures Ward on a crossing route in the fourth quarter.  Greene gets 2 sacks and 7 solos with Blount and Wagner each with a pick against the human library (easy to read) Roethlisberger.|`|0093382286e191b54fe019326d1aa456aa	08 Steelers|`|nMZqHaqCaa	70 no doubt|`|NcA7RSCkaa	idk idc|`|rBcIXU0Waa	The defenses would be virtually identical, but I would have to give the nod to the 2008 defense.  Polamalu is the best safety the steelers have ever had.  Harrison broke the team sacks record and Woodley is a beast on the other side.<br>  <br>  However, the 1978 offense is vastly superior to the 2008 offense.  I know the old adage is that defense wins championships, but in this case, the offense would be bringing it home.  No matter how good the 2008 defense is, their counterpart offense would be their undoing.|`|AA10380060	ahh the good ole dream match up question. haven't seen one of these in awhile. nothing against the teams of yesteryear but you are talking about taking a team from a whole other era and putting them up against a team of today. not only are the players much larger stronger and faster than they were 30 years ago the playbooks have evolved vastly! what do you think an offensive line that averages we'll say 320 lbs a piece would do to a defensive line that probably averaged maybe 250? do you think a qb from 30 years ago could read a complex defense of our current era? though the 78 steelers were the best team of their time era they just simply would not match up physically or mentally with a team of today. 30 years is to far of a gap to compare anymore the game has evolved alot. for dream matchups 2 teams should probably not be compared that have more than 10 years in between them unless you go waaaaayyyyyy back to the beginning of the game where it didn't evolve as rapidly. I would never try to take anything away from the packers of the 60's steelers of the 70's niners of the 80's or the cowboys of the 90's but those were different eras and for the last 30-40 years every decade is almost a different era given how the game changes.|`|XCwjsfz2aa	Im another Steelers fan from a Steelers family (Midland, PA) I agree 200%! You almost cant name anyone who wwasn'ta Hall of Famer on any of those teams! Bradshaw, Harris, Bleier, Swann, Stallworth, Greene, Lambert....its sick! Love my boys from this year, but you have to go w/ the 78' team.|`|KzlyHEgraa	1978 Steelers no doubt<br>  Terry Bradshaw<br>  Franco Harris<br>  Rockey Blier<br>  John Stallworth & Lynn Swann<br>  Mean Joe Greene<br>  LC Greenwood<br>  Jack Ham<br>  Jack Lambert<br>  Mel Blount<br>  Tony Dungy (had to throw it in)<br>  Those guys would still have a chance and half of em can hardly walk.That team would distroy the 08 team.

KwqZmlZRaa	a LOT of people are asking this question so I will post my same answer.<br>  <br>  Well I'll give it a shot. So I'm a sophomore at my high school and started playing tennis about my 7th grade year. Freshman year I posted a question similar to this because i wanted tips on how to make varsity. Well I did and played at #6 for a good school in SoCal (best division in the U.S) and my team this year won our whole division. So take this next bit of advice to heart.<br>  If you haven't played tennis, you can't play tennis. I know that sounds harsh but hear me out, tennis takes time and lots of practice, it's one of the hardest sports there is. Practice, practice, practice. You said you were going to hit a with a friend, i recommend doing it a lot. Be the first one on the courts and the last one to leave. make the coaches think your a coachable kid and show them how much you can improve and listen to what they have to say. ask other players if they want to hit with you over the weekend and maybe see if there are any tennis clinics you can try around your town. Chances are by the end of the season you will be playing much, much better and will still have a LOT of fun. also something I have learned.... sports like football or basketball you stop playing seriously during high school unless your going to play in college and few make it big. Tennis you can play your ENTIRE life!! If you ever goto a tennis club there probably old men playing doubles together and still having a blast! You have your whole life to play tennis and you will grow to be more and more experienced.<br>  hope that helps<br>  <br>  <br>  ALSO: Don't get discouraged you will eventually become a good player and an asset to your team!|`|gnRiLwSxaa	Buy or borrow a racquet and get some tennis balls.    Find someone to practice with who knows basic rules and can teach you a few things.    Learn how to keep score.    Learn how to grip the racquet for forehands, backhands and serves.   Then, go out an practice hitting as many days as you can before tryouts.   During tryouts, run for everything and try to keep the ball in play without trying to kill the ball.    Take some lessons, if that is an option.|`|PZYOTy2Haa	^The answer above was pretty good.<br>  <br>  Go practice with someone you know, just to get the feel of things.<br>  <br>  Then, make sure your coach knows that you are a beginner and that you are ready to put the time in to train & all.<br>  <br>  Keep fairly physically fit.. & keep your eye on the ball. Good luck!|`|f1oGHxBmaa	Well make sure you know the ruling of the game.<br>  Like Love is 0 then it goes 15,30,and 40. And make sure you know when to switch sides and what side to be on. <br>  Make sure when you are playing there are no ball on the court. My coach at least looked at that. <br>  And just be confident. Don't be too upset if you don't make it. It's important to not get upset if you are losing a match because that just makes you do worse. <br>  Good luck.|`|oxsJwyN1aa	Dont stress yourself out. Even if  your not the best you will most likely make it. make sure you can get your serve IN. even if its not fast or low. and make sure you can at least return a ball over the net. Practice makes perfect.

D1beU6MPaa	Jockeys are paid on a per mount (race) basis. The fees are between $30 per mount and $100 per mount depending on the purse structure at each particular track. Those are the fees jockeys receive if they do not finish first, second or third. The jockey of the winning horse receives an amount equal to 10% of the winning owner' s share of the total purse. (The winning owner in most states receives 60% of the total purse.) The second place jockey receives 5% of the owner' s share of the second place purse money. (The second place owner receives 20% of the total purse in most states.) The third place jockey receives 5% of the owner' s share of the third place purse money. (The third place owner receives 15% of the total purse in most states.) The most successful jockeys can earn over a million dollars a year. The least successful will make less the $20,000 per year. The record for purse earnings in one year by a jockey is $23,354,960.00* set by Jerry Bailey in 2003. *These are the earnings of the horses, not the jockey. As a rule of thumb, a jockey' s real earnings are approximately 7% of the horses' earnings.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  Horse owner and breeder<br>  Avid horse racing enthusiast|`|4eLzY2hfaa	depends on how many times he's in the money, and number of mounts.|`|7mdbyjVEaa	It all depends, depends on the track that the jockey is at and how much he wins.

DfPyyDssaa	Former WWE performers Scott “Raven” Levy, Christopher “Kanyon” Kluscartis and “Above Average” Michael Sanders claimed they should have been treated as employees because the Stamford-based WWE controls their salaries, performance locations, costumes, training regimen and the storylines they follow. Further, the lawsuit alleged, the WWE improperly withheld Social Security and Medicare taxes from the federal government because of the wrestlers’ independent contractor status. <br>  <br>  The wrestlers’ attorney, David Golub of Silver, Golub & Teitell in Stamford, also claimed that the wrestlers’ were denied employee benefits such as health care, paid sick time and vacation. <br>  <br>  Golub was seeking class action status, but late last week Senior U.S. District Judge Peter Dorsey granted WWE’s motion to dismiss in federal court in New Haven. He said the wrestlers signed a contract that acknowledged their status as independent contractors. <br>  <br>  The issue of workers’ classification has been a hot topic since the late 1990s when Microsoft was found to have misclassified some workers as independent contractors and temporary employees. Employers sometimes take such steps to cut benefit and liability insurance costs.<br>  <br>  WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt, of K&L Gates, in Pittsburgh, said the most recent lawsuit was the first against WWE alleging worker misclassification. The decision “vindicates our position that these are big guys who signed big guy contracts,” McDevitt told The American Lawyer. “And that the WWE paid them every dime they promised to pay them.”<br>  <br>  Golub told the Law Tribune he was “surprised” that his claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) were not addressed in Dorsey’s ruling, especially after the case was removed from state court to federal court last summer. <br>  <br>  Golub said he plans to file a motion for reconsideration by March 10.?|`|mJvZhdAuaa	<a href="http://www.wwe.com/inside/industrynews/9522288" rel="nofollow">http://www.wwe.com/inside/industrynews/9...</a>|`|qt7QcmtPaa	When isnt it?|`|0mg4OBcMaa	WWE was getting sued because they treat the wrestlers like independent contractors, but then control when and where they work.

I like Trex because it isn't as smooth so it feels more like grinding like you would on a skate/snow board, however this puts more wear and tear on the board so a board with a grind base is better. <br>  <br>  PVC pipes will be the cheapest, and Trex will be the most expensive.
AA10370968	I think he'll be OK.  He's been productive and a decent teammate in the first season with the new team.  Also he's only got a 1-year contract, so Buffalo can cut him loose even during the season without a cap hit.<br>  <br>  I don't think he'll have a lot of yards after catches: he's 35 or 36 and is losing some of his explosive speed.  Assuming good behavior (don't laugh), I see him making 100 catches, especially fade routes for TDs in the red zone.<br>  <br>  Signing and having TO on the Bills is a risk.  But with a 1-year contact, it's at least a controlled risk.|`|AOPuoo16aa	I don't think it he will make any difference and I agree that they will be 8-8|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	hes an over paid baby..............|`|hzAidxdkaa	TO is here for one reason and one reason only. He is going to behave and be a model player for this one year. That way he won't be shunned by all of the other teams out there. Then next year (if he has a good year here) he will garner top dollar once again.<br>  <br>  Expect him to open up the offense for Lee Evans to have a great year. Trent Edwards will also look good because of this. <br>  <br>  It will help Buffalo to have a big name on the feild (hasn't happened since the 90's) and probably get them some nationally televised games. 9 and 7 is what I'm thinking|`|J9GWbyAvaa	Worth it.

AA10916288	Wear a one piece suit. It is very easy for a bikini to accidentally come off when training. I know a few instructors who would send you home to get a 1 piece if you showed up in a bikini. Also be prepared to be in a classroom, so bring a change of dry clothes, and anything else you would bring with you to the pool. Goggles really aren't necessary, and if I were teaching the course, I wouldn't allow them anyway. There's no time to put on goggles when someone needs rescuing.<br>  <br>  Expect to spend a lot of time both in the pool and in the classroom. you will spend a lot of time on your knees when learning CPR and first aid. Water or a sports drink too.|`|YjfBHttWaa	I would advise wearing a two piece. Bring shorts and a t shirt but chances are you wont be wearing it much. There will be drills, but mostly training excersises|`|7MgKT6hvaa	I'm a lifeguard instructor.  And a bikini would not be acceptable in my class.

EGe0k8P6aa	The Crosman 1000x claims to have a muzzle velocity of 1000 fps. I don't know if you'll actually get that with hunting weight pellets (7-9 grain pellets). Still, even if it only gets 850 fps with 8 grain pellets it will still provide Dr. Beeman's requisite 3 ft-lbs of impact energy for killing squirrels (with headshots) out to 30-40 yards (depending on pellet type). The thing is, you need to make sure you get headshots when you're hunting squirrels or rabbits, especially if you're using a .177 caliber rifle.

4mb6xaxBaa	get an airgun cleaning kit or crown saver and clean the bore! goo be gone works good.then follow with dry patches till clean. get a q-tip and check the crown for sharp edges by seeing if it snags the q-tip. if any sharp edges, polish the crown gently with fine sand paper or dremel bit with hand. make sure all bolts are snug, then mount and sight in scope. it will take a tin or 2 to break in then check that all bolt are still snug. beeman.com and crossman.com have tutorials on how to!

xKXu0Qb2aa	WQ - Either Way , I'd have Still Been Pissed.<br>  It Doesn't Matter WHO Got Screwed , it was Still Wrong.<br>  Had Shawn been Leaving for WCW (Where I Doubt He would've Fit) I'm Sure Vince Would've Done the Same Thing.<br>  Although , I'm Not Sure Bret Would've Been as High on the Idea as Shawn was.<br>  You Gotta Remember , back then Shawn wasn't a Good Guy , & Devote Christian. He Could've Cared Less About Screwing Bret. Bret was & is a Stand Up Guy. I Doubt He Would've Gone Along with it.<br>  <br>  I'd Still Watch , because I Still do Even though the Real Screwjob did Happen. Like I Said , it Wouldn't have Mattered WHO Got Screwed. Only Thing Different Would've Been "Shawn Screwed Shawn."<br>  <br>  <br>  BQ - Obviously Bret because of Being a Multi Time Champ.<br>  Shawn was Only a One Time Champ.<br>  <br>  BQ2 - Now: Shawn.<br>  Why? - Because He's Still Around as an Active Performer.<br>  And A Lot of the Kiddies Know Him , Yet Have No Idea Who Bret Hart is , or Even what the "Montreal Screwjob" is , Which is a Damn Shame...|`|QpRUNk0laa	It wouldnt be called the montreal skewjob<br>  Brett would still be in WWE<br>  Shawn Michaels might not had stayed<br>  I would have still watched it<br>  <br>  BQ:Brett, I think<br>  BQ2:Shawn Michaels|`|AA10576425	Bret would have become a wrestling legend (he is still one).. Would have attained greater heights..|`|WyPOnZdSaa	If Shawn Got Screwed Than, Bret Would Probably Still Be Wrestling Today.|`|rH3ylNuYaa	true bret had more fans period over michaels , now the little cena fans might like michaels to but shawn michaels is a wuss , he cried to get out of a match with bret hart, and he cried when don harris grabbed him by the throat , so he is a little pussy.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Meaning if it was Shawn leaving for WCW? I truly think there would have been no screwjob at all. It probably would have ended with a run-in   or with Shawn winning and then him dropping the title to someone or vacating it the following night. Shawn would have gone to WCW but he might have eventually returned to the WWE/F since WCW was still going to end eventually. Then we would once again have Bret and Shawn once again...we'd be starting over again.<br>  <br>  Also, Bret and Shawn would still be in the business since Shawn probably wouldn't have received the career ending kick that Bret got because that match would have happened differently.<br>  BQ: At the time, heels were more believable throughout so Bret had a lot of anger coming at him for anti-ameircan views in his character.<br>  BQ2: Shawn, Bret is no longer wrestling.|`|e3m3rdNYaa	Wrestling would defiantly be different, but Bret and Vince still wouldn't be on speaking terms because Bret still would have jumped ship to WCW. However, Shawn Michaels' true colors would have been revealed. Would he have accepted it and moved on on or would he have thrown a huge bitchfit about it like Bret did? I would probably still be watching wrestling simply because I am addicted. I honestly don't think I would be watching the WWE though, I would probably be watching WCW because I don't think the WWF could have won the Monday Night War without Michaels. <br>  <br>  If it had happend, Michaels may have left the wrestling business all together, He wouldn't want to go to WCW with Bret, nor could he stay in the WWF McMahon. Wrestling in general would be different if he had left the business.<br>  <br>  BQ: Everyone has an oppinion on the 2 of them, I would say Bret had the biggest of anyone at the time<br>  <br>  BQ2: Like I said before, Everyone has an oppinion on the 2 of them, Bret's fanbase has shrank since that time. I think they have evened out over time and are pretty much even. It is hard to say since Bret has been out of the business for quite a while and Shawn is preparing to headline Wrestlemania.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	I would have cheered for Bret. I'm a Bret fan. Yes, I would still be watching wrestling today.<br>  <br>  Bret'f Fanbase in the United States was bigger than Shawn's before Bret turned Heel, then Shawn had a bigger fan base in the United States, but bret had a bigger fan base world wide.<br>   <br>  Shawn has a bigger Fanbase now, because Bret hasn't wrestled in over 8 years.|`|hL3eS2zKaa	That'd be horrible. I mean, we wouldnt be seing HBK anymore. Either way, its sad. I wouldnt be watching wrestling AS MUCH.<br>  <br>  BQ: I think that Bret did.<br>  BQ2: I think that HBK does.|`|bRGdkOwqaa	what if the montreal screw job happend in toronto would it be called the toronto screw job the world may never know

FodhQooPaa	Oh Yeah, Mr. Perfect Curt Hennig has go to be up there.  He wrestled in a couple Rumbles and he was a great wrestler. Chris Jericho has gotta be up their too. I also agree that Owen is nowhere near the top because he wasn't that good of a wrestler, his death overshadowed his career. If I am not mistaken Mick Foley never won one, that is my final answer...|`|kZPFCPHVaa	Edge. Edge has done everything in WWE but win the Royal Rumble.

3k2NjOWsaa	That is really wrong!  You really should have made the team.  My suggestion would be to talk to the Athletic Coordinator at your school and ask what the requirements were for the team.  Then, go talk to the coach.  That is really bad that she chose her own daughter over someone who actually knows what they're doing.  If she does not comply, then you should really go and talk to your principal.  good luck and i hope i helped!! <3

Xar3YgiRaa	No. John Cena did not create the PG era. Did John Cena influence Vince to change WWE to PG? He doesn`t have that type of power. It was Vince`s decision to go PG and he just used John Cena to attract kids to the WWE, but he is definantly not the reason for the PG era.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	I'd say that it means that Cena is a big draw for kids, as well as being a good role model.  However, I don't agree with this idea.  I think the "PG Era" (even though were actually in the "Sports Entertainment Era"), was created as a reaction to America moving to a more conservative atmosphere; WWE is only trying to keep up with a changing market.|`|BglekVnQaa	It means that the only reason the WWE is pussyfied is because of him. Because of him there's less blood and gore. Rarely in a Hell in A Cell do you see blood and never do you see a Hardcore match or a Three Stages of Hell. You don't see even see an Extreme Rules Match because so many little kids watch wrestling now.<br>  <br>  You forever stay on John Cena's nuts and I see that in just about every question you ask or answer. If you were a real wrestling fan you would hate him and agree with all of the people against Cena.|`|GExKoh1Gaa	PG era refers to watered down storylines so WWE can be viewed by a younger audience.<br>  john cena attracted kiddie fans into WWEs target audience,kids buy allot of toys and other merchandise and since vince mcmahon is such a pathetic businessman lead by his insecurity he pushed the cena kiddie era.|`|zbjF53nraa	HE DID NOT PEOPLE ARE JUST IDIOTS, HE IS JUST THE ONE WHO IS MOST AFFECTED BY IT BECAUSE BEFORE HE HAD THE MOST 14A GIMMICK EVER<br>  <br>  PS its funny because i answered the question "why do you hate John Cena" just before you did and saw how surprised you were and now you ask|`|WyPOnZdSaa	No Mr McMahon Did,  I Agree With The Evan Bourne Guy.|`|1JywgkyMaa	because so many stupid kids think he can actually wrestle,so one day vince said,"since i'm such a selfish bastard,i'm going to take the attitude out of wrestling and make sure it's kid friendly" i just dont get why you like cena,if you do thats your opinion,but i dont see whats to like about him|`|rt8E2JhKaa	I think that this means that Cena is just for the Kids, that he is not as great as he was when he first started, that he is one main the main wrestlers that likes kids.|`|lz7oTQNXaa	how can cena himself create the pg era lol? it is not his company and if u want to blame anyone for the pg era blame vince mcmahon who runs the wwe.|`|OfutBhxYaa	yeep
kGXU1Dotaa	Yes he really belongs there not as a starter.|`|36zm5zK8aa	no.|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	I know you mean Joba, but it would be much more fun to me if I could treat the question as if you actually meant Jaba (note that my fun answer will be treating "Jaba" as "Jabba the Hut").<br>  <br>  Serious Answer: That's a bad idea, both short-term and long-term.  Sort-term, the Yankees need Joba in the rotation so the back end doesn't completely suck while Chien-Ming Wang is injured.  Long-term, Joba is the kind of player who needs to know his role and settle into it without wondering if he'll have the same role from one season to the next.<br>  <br>  Fun Answer: That would be interesting for several reasons.<br>  1. While he's warming up, imagine how cramped the catcher in the bullpen must feel.<br>  2. Imagine the "Star Wars" theme playing for half an hour every time he was called upon.<br>  3. Imagine how restless the crowd will get while waiting said half hour.<br>  4. Imagine a line drive getting stuck in him, especially if the bases are loaded and there are less than 2 outs.  The opposing team would then get 3 free runs while he tried to find the ball.|`|kyEPS7xCaa	Well, looks like they are already priming Mark Melanchon to be the set up man/future closer, so they should keep Joba in the Rotation.  If he struggles this year, they can consider moving him and adjusting the rotation to add Hughes, Kennedy, and Aceves.  With Petitte more than likely retiring after this year, we should see one of those guys in the rotation next year, barring any trades or injuries.|`|3mZyMnjfaa	yeah he is a dominate closer when rivera retires i can guarantee u that|`|b4mDpU4faa	NO! my bad i thought he said should we should not put him in so YES!|`|I683b5E8aa	he needs to be the next mariano rivera he needs to go to the bullpen|`|e9065dfa2249178c642f3f273c9dbb1caa	no joba chamberlain is born to be a starter her will help the yankees to there 27th champhionship|`|tARluLEZaa	Yes, they have enough good starters with C.C. and Burnett.

Taker can too.|`|OHBvEYKHaa	EVAN BOURNE they really need to put him in and Kingston is injured Undertaker can not compete in MiTB because it would eliminate the undertaker WM match|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Seriously , It's NOT Gonna be Kennedy.<br>  He Isn't Scheduled to Return Until AFTER WM25 in April.<br>  <br>  <br>  Evan Bourne gets the 8th Spot in a Battle Royal.<br>  And Kofi Kingston OBVIOUSLY Wins Tonight for #7.<br>  <br>  <br>  *EDIT* - My Bad:<br>  Let 'Taker Compete , They Already got Mark Henry's Fat @ss in There.<br>  Although I Think MiTB would be Beneath 'Taker.<br>  Plus , We'd Already Know He was Gonna Win...|`|bRGdkOwqaa	MMMMMMMMRRRRRRRRRRRR.<br>  KKKKKKKKEEEEEEEEENNNNNNEEEEEDDDDDYYYY|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	Evan Borne|`|Xar3YgiRaa	The Best High Flyer to Ever Enter WWE.....................<br>  <br>  EVAN "AIR" BOURNE.|`|EuMQfWJGaa	this is hard. <br>  but it'd have to come down to either Mr. Kennedy<br>  or<br>  Rey Mysterio<br>  or<br>  Evan Bourne. Kingston would make perfect in the mitb match, and it looks pretty good this year. But i prefer t to be Bourne because rey has had alot of chances at something but he never makes it and if kennedy was in it it would be like a replay of last years. And it would be perfect for bourne's return.<br>  <br>  and taker has been in like 2 ladder matches, so shawn would probably be better in next years because he has alot of experience in ladder matches.|`|NaJEkHo2aa	Evan Bourne or Rey Mysterio (if not i hope they have big plans for in involving Wrestlemania)<br>  <br>  I would not like Undertaker competing in MiTB b/c that'd mean if he lost, 7 people ended the streak, and i honestly wouldn't want to see him win. B/c, he doesn't need a "contract" to get him a World Championship Match any time.  But, it would be awesome seeing him dominate in another Ladder Match like that.|`|PniPsDmGaa	The last would be R-Truth<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and Undertaker in the MITB match would look kind of funny!!! I mean Undertaker jumping off of a ladder!!! wow!! I dont think Undertaker will ever compete in a MITB match, it just doesnt go right with him.|`|OfutBhxYaa	kingston|`|qypwWxuVaa	the last spot goes to Rey Mysterio in a battle royal|`|lGIL36faaa	kofi or r-truth<br>  <br>  it  has 2 be 1 of these two becoz they really deserve it|`|7wVsKuQraa	evan bourne or r-truth
juWJ47hXaa	The workouts for each are tedious and long. However, the benefit to running a long distance event in a meet as opposed to sprinting is that you don't have heat after heat, after heat. You run your event, and that is that.|`|Jr9j5f6naa	I honestly think long distance runners are more in shape. for example, every long distance runner I know including myself is an above-average sprinter. But I know sprinters who aren't that great when it comes to running the mile, or any long distance. <br>  <br>  Long distance makes your muscles leaner, longer, and makes your legs look great. sprinters tend to have a lot bigger muscles. I'm not saying that's bad, but a lot of girls are worried about looking to "manly", although that's no reason to switch from one to the other.<br>  <br>  Long distance running, if you are good at it, and go at a good pace, can be relaxing and fun. you can run with another person, which is always better. I know running can give you what's called a "runners high", and I'm not sure sprinting will give you that. I'm always really happy and bubbly after my meets haha (:<br>  <br>  one more thing; in a sprinting race, usually the places are taken by about 50 meters..like the person who is going to be first is usually first most of the race, same with 2nd, etc. in long distance you can have strategies, which can make a big difference.<br>  <br>  I know I only gave long distance pluses, but I don't know that much about sprinting, so I couldn't say.|`|VLikQ8NAaa	LONG DISTANCE RUNNERS ARE COOLER lol
mqgS6Dfxaa	To answer the question "Is this within the rules?", I can not find anything that says it's not legal.  The first answers says "According to baseball rules the only player on the field allowed to wear catcher's gear is the catcher." but he doesn't back it up with a source so unless he can provide the rule I'll assume he doesn't really know.  I looked at the first rule "Objectives of the game" and could not find anything that says the fielders can not wear catcher's equipment, they just can't wear a catcher's mit.  <a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rule1.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rule1.sh...</a><br>  <br>  Also, rule 4.03(c) says "Except the pitcher and the catcher, any fielder may station himself anywhere in fair territory"<br>  <br>  As far as it working, I highly doubt it.  How many times have you seen a catcher get shaken up on a foul ball when they don't catch it?  I certainly wouldn't want to be one of the other 7 fielders.|`|b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	I am going to make the assumption that this is a joke and just leave it at that.|`|RCpkdx4haa	That's the most retarded idea I've heard on here yet. Tell him to stand there and let someone hit the ball into his chest at five feet. If a ball is thrown 80mph(average), and the batter's swing is 120mph(average), the ball will be accellerated to 200mph off the bat(physics 101, everything will have an equal and opposite reaction. Tell him to use his ******* brain, and you should use your ******* brain too.|`|91052aeeaae7f679e0597b8689a2057aaa	According to baseball rules the only player on the field allowed to wear catcher's gear is the catcher. Therefore that cannot be possible.|`|3mZyMnjfaa	what if they hit the ball in the outfield and i don't think everyone can wear catchers gear|`|B46t8gkLaa	lol|`|XmsIgobraa	Im sure it would work but i think it is illegal. You have to give the batter some chance to get a hit, thats why there is a set distance players are. Also, i think injuries to the fielders would be crazy because there are many gaps in catchers gear and the ball off of the bat comes at at least 90 mph. its a great idea, if only it would work!
mqgS6Dfxaa	Lost Dog  you don't know what you're talking about.  They didn't lose too much pitching.  Just look at what happened last year.<br>  <br>  Westbrook played 5 games and none after May 28th.<br>  Sabathia was traded on July 7th. <br>  Byrd was traded on Aug 12th after going 7-10 with a 4.53 ERA.<br>  <br>  So basically they played last season without those three guys.  Their record after the Sabathia trade was 44-30 (.595 pct), after the Byrd trade they were 28-17 (.622 pct).  The White Sox won the division with a .546 percentage.<br>  <br>  True, Cliff Lee probably won't win 22 games but Fausto Carmona, who won 19 in 2007, should win more than 8.  Those two together winning 30 games like they did in 2008 is very reasonable.  It doesn't matter who the other team's pitcher is, Lee led the league in ERA at 2.54.<br>  <br>  On top of the starting pitching which will be fine, they've addressed two of their weaknesses from '08.  Kerry Wood (5-4, 3.26, 34 saves) replaces Joe Borowski (1-3, 7.56, 6 saves) and Mark DeRosa (21, 87, .285) replaces Andy Marte (3, 17, .221) at third.<br>  <br>  Plus Travis Haffner and Victor Martinez, two of their better hitters, played a combined 130 games.|`|V430UrvFaa	Very unlikely, the Indians might not have the hitting other teams had last year. They hit for a lousy batting average overall, and the Twins have better pitching then they do. At least they may finish at .500, because that is as far as they are getting, I know, reality kinda stinks.|`|Tmr7f3Xgaa	Better than the Tigers' chances if you are referring to the MLB team from Cleveland.|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	In your dreams|`|GxSxTc2haa	Zero. They lost too much starting pitching.<br>  Sabathia gone, Byrd gone, Westbrook out for 1st half of the season.<br>  <br>  Editor's note: Cliff Lee is not going to win 22 games again this year.<br>                      Those were all starts against other teams' # 3-4 guys.<br>  <br>  Assuming everybody stays healthy, the offense should be good enough to play .500 ball.<br>  That bullpen leaves a lot to be desired. Kerry Wood was a good choice.|`|AA11605074	I guess anything can happen. wood and derosa were good pick ups, but i jst dont think they have it in them. it could happen though i guess, with a big trade or free agent signing near the deadline, i just dont think they can make it out of the american leagues. i say maybe a 5% chance although i think thats too big|`|HP75NEbNaa	They have a very good chance at winning their division.  They improved their bullpen with Kerry Wood and Joe Smith and added another bat with Mark DeRosa.<br>  <br>  Once they get into the playoffs anything can happen, just look at what Tampa did last year.|`|e9b634a4379f848ee79101f12102a2bbaa	hi i love cleveland and i am from her i think that they will win the division like mos people think, but i also think they will win the ALDS , but lose in  the ALCS|`|UAdBIO8Gaa	haaaa. i hate to break it to you buddy but i think the chances are veeery slim.|`|i9eAnKsBaa	what happen to the yankees winning? :(|`|vYLjLDAXaa	there is nooooooooooooooooooo way there going to win!|`|ofC4JQIhaa	none at all ! the Red Sox are gonna win it|`|u1T5TQP7aa	as every other team until about mid season 1/30
Vjan4Vq2aa	Agreed. The Red Devils are on fire.|`|lfmdXengaa	They might... but no one has successfully defended the title since being renamed from European Cup to Champion's League... so i think they have a good chance,but only a chance... and remember players and teams play at their best when faced against the defending champion's...my money is on Barca, they only need to rediscover their attacking capability then only themselves can stop them... That's what good about teams like Barca and Manu, they don't depend on the other team to mess up to win, even if the other are playing their best, they can outplay them with ease|`|AA11107697	Lets be honest, now that Man U has put themselves out there. Everyone is gunning for them and they won't be able to handle them. They had an easy schedule to the final as they didn't have to face an English team till the final. It won't happen this year.|`|3lgcKpAcaa	if you say so.....|`|oFeNwMheaa	naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...<br>  spot the letter s!|`|jXNFAVGZaa	Hell no ***** Inter Milan is going to blow the **** out of them. **** God and Manchester United.|`|HhuObSqtaa	YES Agreed|`|2JfZ9ptGaa	yessss, agreed.|`|7KZepeq3aa	I think Man United to win retain the ECL.<br>  <br>  and I also think we will meet the scousers along the way and knock then out.|`|WS8MvKQAaa	I just threw an explosive pie at your face. Have a nice day:D|`|c6H2GC9kaa	no, i disagree...barca will make it to the final against either liverpool or bayern munich with barca winning in the end :D|`|DEcunDd5aa	Disagreed.|`|3ZrTiVFCaa	AGREEEEED|`|9XxQJLqUaa	chelsea will win. thank you and have a good day
26fb51ead612e7006829de7144c65343aa	No Mercy for the N64 in my opinion is the best WWE game ever made, no other WWE game has been as good as it was in the career mode where you can choose what title you go for and literally choose your own path. it had so many superstars in the game. it really was just a great game.|`|8bm2AW7Kaa	I agree with Ryan N, i liked No Mercy for N64 and also Wrestlemania 2000 also for N64 was another of my favorites.|`|h5lOMoqBaa	The Fire Pro series from Japan. As far as WWE games, then No Mercy, and Here Comes The Pain|`|OuFhcdX9aa	here comes the pain it had lesner and Goldberg in it.|`|rt8E2JhKaa	Wrestlemania 21 for the Xbox.|`|j2xGuTaaaa	No Mercy on the N64. It was my first ever WWE game and I still think it rocks.|`|QYGGn7lBaa	Here comes the pain|`|VlvektSJaa	WWF In Your House|`|BglekVnQaa	Wrestlemania X8.|`|8TW00N9Daa	No Mercy for the N64.
aXdGCbEDaa	Definitely HHH vs. RKO.This rivalry has been carried on since The Old Evolution days when Evolution turned on Orton.Now it's WM25,nearly 5 years later,and everything is culminating into one last battle between HHH and RKO.Although I wouldn't be surprised if their paths crossed even after Mania.But so far this storyline between them has been the most unpredictable as of late.However,I have a feeling that The Undertaker/HBK feud will pick up sooner or later.I have a feeling that everything between HHH and RKO will lead to a Hell In A Cell Match.Although Undertaker and HBK will outshine HHH and RKO at the end of the night.<br>  <br>  BQ:I think that it looks good.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Purely feud is Triple H vs Randy Orton. They have been the ones with a solid storyline behind it. They made the storyline seem personal and pushed it as the most important of the three.<br>  Undertaker and Shawn Michaels only had the challenge and some insight with Undertaker's recent promo. Maybe tonight a storyline may develop more.<br>  Cena, Edge, and Big Show's storyline seems to be Vickie and Big Show having an affair which I don't think makes for a very good feud.<br>  <br>  BQ: Yea, looks good but that might be because I'm just a huge Taker fan.|`|8TW00N9Daa	What in the World is +BQ?  Does it mean Better quality?  <br>  <br>  Triple H vs. Randy Orton has the best build, but this year's Wrestle Mania is looking very weak!|`|NG5mOGsUaa	HHH/ Orton but Undertaker/ Michaels has a whole lot of potential|`|8t1Osybyaa	orton/hhh|`|rt8E2JhKaa	I think that the better Feud Heading into WMXXV so far, that i think is Undertaker vs. HBK because that is where Two Great Wrestler will fight, HBK to make history for being the first Wresler to beat the Undertaker at WrestleMania, and Undertaker to keep his winning streak.<br>  <br>  <br>  BQ: Yea i think that the picture and avatar is awesome. Great Question.|`|zjeNJVy2aa	I think the HBK and Undertaker feud is the best because it is awesome to see to Future hall of famers go at it and plus the promos are great..<br>  <br>  BQ: I love your new name and Avatar great combo!|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	Triple H vs. Randy Orton.<br>  <br>  We haven't even scratched the surface on the HBK vs. Undertaker feud.<br>  <br>  BQ: It looks cool, that's a good avi of the Undertaker|`|qypwWxuVaa	honestly HHH vs RKo but they havent had enough time for all the others i personally think that all of em will be amazing especialy cena big show and edge the way its goin right now is interesting but so far HHH vs RKO|`|VlvektSJaa	Triple H & Randy Orton.<br>  <br>  HBK and Taker haven't really started anything.|`|hVCiSk4Raa	Undertaker VS. HBK|`|QbhcmDCfaa	HHH/Orton|`|f2d3d8edde822210301b7dc5946235ecaa	Right now HHH vs Orton, but I can tell you this. Undertaker and HBK will have the best match out of all these feuds.|`|aCyqB2bAaa	Triple H and Randy Orton, because its a really good story line, I mean Triple H says its "personal" at WM and even though its entertainment, he was looking serious as part of the script and if you saw RAW last week, then you saw Randy going into Detail about how he RKO Stephanie.|`|lz7oTQNXaa	the only match im looking forward to is undertaker v HBK, the rest of the matches im not interested in one bit im afraid so i will just watch the taker/hbk match.<br>  <br>  BA: The Straight Edge Messiah|`|zDNHZ2QEaa	TRIPLE H VS RANDY ORTON BECAUSE IT IS PERSONAL CAUSE IT INVOLVES HHH'S FAMILY|`|JRjHMI1Uaa	HHH and RandyO|`|KIOR56r6aa	HBK n Taker. They don't even need to promote it that much to get the people pumped up.<br>  <br>  BQ : Yes

mK06dus9aa	One sticks in my mind - I don't know why - 1994 FA Cup Final, Man Utd got 2 against Chelsea|`|WS8MvKQAaa	probably|`|MjPd9vyYaa	Okay MR S I'm with you!<br>  <br>  And I think so :D<br>  And Bella well Antonio isn't like that!|`|VpiYSQVnaa	shouldn't u be talking about hot chicks mister???<br>  <br>  Men!|`|IJvwYe1yaa	Kaka vs. Reggina last season.  He scored both of them and it was part of his hat trick.  It's not a rare thing.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	It has happened MANY times. I remember even the semi final of the 2000 Euro bw Italy and Holland. Holland got two PKs during the game and didn't score any of them.<br>  <br>  But I recall them happening since. Even this year in Serie A and EPL I recall some. I might be wrong but didn't Barca even get two PKs in a game this year?|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	Guys Lets all head towards Xbox and make fun of those people.<br>  <br>  Ronaldo- Penalty Hattrcik vs Argentina.
82MzhqHRaa	Pato is 532532 times better and he is still young. Despite being top scorer in Milan i dont think he has taken the responsobility that maybe Kaka has in that Ac Milan team. So he is still learning. Unlike Aguero who got to Atletico Madrid in a bang and it seems like we have seen the best of him in Atletico. He only plays when he wants to play.|`|4NOLMLnNaa	alexandre pato.. more flexible and energetic and has a good personality.. aguero is great dont get me wrong but for me pato is more useful because he's consistent..|`|wrhqkEiMaa	lmao of course all the Milan fans will say Pato or Patooooooo or whatever his name is, but everyone else knows Aguero is much better than him and has a brighter future ahead of him.|`|8UOkX4Jnaa	Pato is already in my team so i can say Aguero and have both;)<br>  <br>  but if Pato was not at Milan then I would want him to come to Milan!|`|3yqCKPzVaa	Pato...|`|IJvwYe1yaa	Pato and he's already on AC Milan.  So it works out.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Pato. By FAR: <br>  <br>  Younger and imo better. He hasn't even played a full season at top level football and has only just turned 19 and is scoring lots of goals and showing improvements as the weeks go on.<br>  <br>  Aguero is overtalked. Sorry but if Stefy wasn't on here and there wasn't any other Atleti fan to talk about him hardly many people here would even mention him...|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	pato|`|MjPd9vyYaa	I really like Pato.

JBFNRyoNaa	Wear Tye Die Shirt and like purple shorts and do something really funky with your hair :)|`|gA7HuOODaa	you should wear some crazy spandex like zebra print or any kind of print you want really and a bright, randomly colored neon shirt.  then do your hair super high up and spray colors in. you could put crazy make up on too if you really wanted too. Hope you have fun!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|v2BC30KAaa	I'm thinking you should wear a bright tshirt in like lime green or pink. then some zebra or cheetah spandex. Wear solid neon socks. Then put your hair into high pigtails and spray paint them with hairspray. Maybe wear an animal print sweatband. That would be cute!

7X6HxaSmaa	The main problem with a bike from a department store is that they are not necessarily put together by people that know what they're doing. Following instructions is different then knowing how to properly tighten various bolts, proper chain lengths, tire inflations, etc.<br>  On the otherhand people buy department store bikes all the time, and they operate at least in some capacity.<br>  If you're looking for a notch above the department store fare, the price is usually also above the department stores. $350 seems about the starting point for the entry level trek/specialized/gary fischer/rayleighs.<br>  I'll echo that if you want to spend in that ballpark, you're better off going to a bikeshop as they will help you pick out a bike frame that fits you best.|`|7ISUKu38aa	You shoulld look around to see if there are any small bilke shops near your house/apartment. They can help you find what you need in a flash. Also, a good bike is a trex bike, they are basically all good (pricier ones are usually better because they are more expensive cause all the special stuff on the costs more to install and get in the first place).|`|kQYqDbc5aa	It depends if you want a racing bike or a mountain bike.
kZO68ex4aa	Trek makes some nice entry mountain bikes, the 300 series. Also take a look at the Giant Boulder line, these are nice solid entry mountain bikes as well. <br>  <br>  Also take a look at the Forge Devon CM. One of the bikes I ride is the Forge Sawback 5xx, an amazing value. What Forge offers would normally sell for twice the price.<br>  <br>  Here's the link:<br>  <a href="http://www.forgebikes.com/devonmount.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.forgebikes.com/devonmount.asp</a> <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|d20evTAwaa	i highly recommend a norco bike, they are the best brand and you will not be disappointed. and there a whole range of different prices and types heres a link.. norco.com|`|DOVbF4Piaa	A shop quality bike will run $300 to $500 for the lower level bikes.  You can save some money buy finding a used one on the local ebay or craig's list.  You want to make sure the bike is the correct size for you. Ask your boyfriend to help you out.
aCyqB2bAaa	I mean I love HBK, I am a huge fan, but it might hurt Undertakers Character if he lost his streak. So I support 17-0!|`|ZDyiSTwoaa	i really do hope he is 17-0 hbk is a future hall of famour yes but ending the undertakers streak is impossible for him yes he may have ended ric flairs career well even that's not true if jericho is fighting flair next week. but he did end vladimir kozloves undefeated streak. im wishing taker wins anyway and hhh and john cena and if jbl is in a match i want him to win it and i want kane to win money in the bank and i want lita or Trish to win the 25 diva battle royal.|`|zbjF53nraa	HBK is my fav superstar, so I think since they are both legends it would be awesome if there was some cool controversy thing that were to happen like taker pins shawn but Shawn covers Taker with his arm or something at the same time and the ref dont see shawns arm so it is like a controversial thing that is one of wwe's historic moments, I think eventually Orton should beat Taker to make him a solid legend and really keep up his legend killer gimmick|`|oY4Asqdpaa	well i like both too! but it's gonna be stupid if taker loses, why would he lose? and why ask this question if taker supporters only can answer? then you know wht they are gonna say! some people are silly! come on ask decent questions instead of answering ur own question!|`|lz7oTQNXaa	i think everyone does and to be honest i dotn see im losing it this wrestlemania.|`|QbY18bjkaa	R.I.P hbk|`|j478qBbHaa	HBK all the way|`|WcDWsKxuaa	me...... i'm a big fan of the undertaker.|`|ULFdGnZBaa	undertaker will never lose at wrestlemania.

If their policy includes firing, then so be it.|`|VU6ODC5Baa	No,its not like he called members of team and staff out. He was just upset and let his emotions fly.If he was a coach I would definitely fire him.I think the team should have just sat down with the guy and tell him not to do it again.|`|RQAXysWVaa	no that was mean but he's an idiot and i like the eagles btw|`|XLXncQu9aa	Absolutely.  Even though I was shocked by Brian Dawkins leaving the fact is, you have a job to do.  If you work for an organization, there is an allegiance that you are expected to follow.  You are an employee, and bad mouthing your employer is always sure to get you fired if you are caught.  Think about it.  If you say something negative about your employer, and you work for them that can cause more of a disturbance and it may lead to more employees feeling the same way.  Now whether they do or not, it does create a negative atmosphere.  It not only causes a distraction, but it doesn't look good to future employees.  If someone who wanted to work for the organization heard an employee bad mouthing, they would have a negative outlook on the organization as a whole and they would likely want to work elsewhere.  You cause a rift amongst employees which is hard to ignore.  So I agree, he should have been fired.  You sign a contract and you are expected to show some type of respect to your employer whether you like it or not.  And if you don't like it you can leave.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	In my opinion, no. He was just a stadium worker; not a player, coach, or team official.<br>  <br>  But what he did was wrong- he called out his bosses in public. Not only that, he called them names.<br>  <br>  It's like going to your local newspaper and calling your boss an idiot. My guess is most of us would be fired for that.

561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	Cricket is a bat-and-ball team sport that originated in southern England. The earliest definite reference is dated 1598, and it is now played in more than 100 countries.[1] There are several forms of cricket; at its highest level is Test cricket, in which the current leading national team is Australia.[2] Test cricket is followed in rank by One Day International cricket, whose last World Cup was also won by Australia; the tournament was televised in over 200 countries to a viewing audience estimated at more than two billion viewers.[3][4] The current leading One Day International team is South Africa.[5]<br>  <br>  A cricket match is contested by two teams, usually of eleven players each[6] and is played on a grass field in the centre of which is a flat strip of ground 22 yards (20 m) long called a pitch. A wicket, usually made of wood, is placed at each end of the pitch and used as a target.<br>  <br>  The bowler, a player from the fielding team, bowls a hard leather, fist-sized, 5.5-ounce (160 g) cricket ball from the vicinity of one wicket towards the other, which is guarded by the batsman, a player from the opposing team. The ball usually bounces once before reaching the batsman. In defence of his wicket, the batsman plays the ball with a wooden cricket bat. Meanwhile, the other members of the bowler's team stand in various positions around the field as fielders, players who retrieve the ball in an effort to stop the batsman scoring runs, and if possible to get him or her out. The batsman—if he or she does not get out—may run between the wickets, exchanging ends with a second batsman (the "non-striker"), who has been stationed at the other end of the pitch. Each completed exchange of ends scores one run. Runs are also scored if the batsman hits the ball to the boundary of the playing area. The number of runs scored and the number of players out are the main factors that determine the eventual match result.<br>  <br>  There are several variations as to how long a game of cricket can last. In professional cricket this can be anything from a match limited to 20 overs per side to a game played over 5 days. Depending on the length of the game being played, there are different rules that govern how a game is won, lost, drawn or tied.<br>  <br>  Cricket is essentially an outdoor sport, certainly at major level, and some games are played under floodlights. For example, it is played during the summer in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, while in the West Indies, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh it is played mostly during the winter after the monsoon season.<br>  <br>  Governance rests primarily with the International Cricket Council (ICC), based in Dubai, which organises the sport worldwide via the domestic controlling bodies of the member countries. The ICC administers both men's and women's cricket, both versions being played at international level. Although men cannot play women's cricket, the rules do not disqualify women from playing in a men's team.<br>  <br>  The rules are in the form of a code known as The Laws of Cricket [7] and these are maintained by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), based in London, in consultation with the ICC and the domestic boards of control.<br>  <br>  cheers~|`|swL7bQfAaa	This will make it simple!<br>  It is a  comedic little verse I read many years ago<br>  <br>  The Rules of Cricket<br>  <br>  You have two sides, one out in the field and one in.<br>  Each man that’s in the side that’s in goes out, and when he’s out he comes in and the next man goes in until he’s out.<br>  When they are all out, the side that’s out comes in and the side that's been in goes out and tries to get those coming in, out.<br>  Sometimes you get men still in and not out.<br>  When a man goes out to go in, the men who are out try to get him out, and when he is out he goes in and the next man in goes out and goes in.<br>  There are two men called umpires who stay out all the time and they decide when the men who are in are out.<br>  When both sides have been in and all the men have out, and both sides have been out twice after all the men have been in, including those who are not out, that is the end of the game!|`|ygDC4JFYaa	each team have 11 players <br>  when one team bats other team bowls <br>  batting teams have to score runs and bowling team has to limit runs and take wickets ( in either certian number of ball(odi version) or unlimetd balls (test version)<br>  once a team batting finishes the other team bats and scores runs to overhauls the other teams runs scored<br>  <br>  wickets (e.g)<br>  ======<br>  if ball hits stump<br>  if balls when abt to hit stumps is blocked by leg<br>  if batsman hits to ball into air and its is caugh by fielders before it touches ground<br>  <br>  runs<br>  ==== <br>  if bats man hits the ball to the boundary rope on the groung through ground => 4 runs<br>  if batsman hits ball over the boundary rope , then its => 6 runs<br>  other than this , the batsman can run to get 1,2, or 3 runs etc<br>  if ball is not bowled correctly by bowler then 1 run is given to opposiotn <br>  <br>  winning<br>  ======<br>  which team has the highest score of runs <br>  <br>  <br>  note<br>  =====<br>  all thses i have given are in simple form . but its much complex and beautifull than u think.|`|MUERDKyzaa	No point in you doing a paper on it honestly. You have to watch a match sorry, or play it.<br>  I dont think your gonna get much luck asking someone on here, because i cant be asked, and i dont think alot of others can be either lol.<br>  Just do something like ping pong and talk about history of it and importance to china or something lol.|`|UR31EQ50aa	Team game played by 11 individuals. 1 team bats, the other takes to the field and bowls the ball, over arm. The bowler is not allowed to throw the ball at the batsman. BAtsman must hit the ball into a vicinity on the field not occupied by the opponents. He then runs the length of the pitch (22 yards) to score 1 run. The batsman's chief role is to protect the stumps,(3 long sticks with two little ones balanced on top called bails)from every ball the bowler bowls. If the bowler is successful at smashing the stumps, the batsman is out. He can also be called out if he hits the ball on the full to an opponent who catches the ball (on the full,) if he uses his legs to sheild the ball from hittin g the stumps, (LBW) or if he hits the stumps or is caught outside of the crease and the stumps are upset by the ball. <br>  Obviously there are alot more rules but this is the basics. <br>  The easiest way to think about cricket and its popularity in India is to think of the batsman as the god, nothing happens till he is ready, tyhe bowler is the priest serving up to the batsman, and the fielders are the untouchables, running around getting the ball and servicing the priest who in turn services the gods. And like all egalitarian religions - every one gets a go at every position.|`|niCNxg0Vaa	G'day, concept is not simple, 2 teams of 11 players each, 1 team bowls (each over is 6 balls unless an illegal delivery e.g. overstepping the crease which is 1 yard in front of the wicket, bowling too wide of wicket at the other end), the batting team bats as 2 people 1 at either end of the pitch which is 22 yard long with a wicket and a crease the batsmen must stay in their crease a line drawn 1 yard in front of the opposite end wicket, batsmen can run after they hit the ball as long as they get to the opposite end crease before the fielding team hits the wicket with the ball, there is a designated boundary usually a circle about 60 yards encircleing the pitch which if the ball passes along the ground are counted as 4 runs, a ball that clears the boundary on the full is credited with 6 runs. you can get out a multiple amount of ways e.g. caught on the full if the ball is hit in the air and is caught before hitting the ground, bowled whereby the ball beats the batsman and hits the wicket which comprises 3 stumps approx 3 feet high with bails attatching the wicket). When out a batsman cannot continue and the batting side keeps going until losing 10 wickets thereby leaving 1 batsman not out but unable to continue as he has no partner, or a designated amount of overs has been bowled and the batting team will not be all out but will have set the opposing team a total for them to try to attain in the alloted overs as long as they do not lose 10 wickets. are plenty of books online and is a difficult job to try and simplify but have given it a go.|`|xk7nL3bpaa	Its a game where you have two sides.<br>  <br>  One side is out on the field and one is in.<br>  <br>  Each man that is on the side that is in goes out, and when he gets out, he comes back in.<br>  <br>  Then the next man goes in, until he gets out.<br>  <br>  When they are all out, the side that has been in goes out, and tries to get those coming in out.<br>  <br>  When both sides have been in and out, thats including the not-outs, thats the end of the game.<br>  <br>  Quite simple really!

But we don't have someone that we can drop back and throw to every down.  I feel that Hank Basket could be our guy, but for some reason, Andy Reid doesn't like to put him on the field.

I mean, as long as you have the knowledge and parts then there is nothing that can legally prevent you.  As for as anyone is concerned you already have the gun/guns because the receivers are the item which is considered "the gun" (the part with the serial number on it).  All the other stuff (barrels, stock, internals, etc...) are just considered accessories.|`|KDOIKIq2aa	As long as you are not building a select fire (Full auto) AK-47, but simply assembling a rifle from a kit with on a receiver you legally own.

AA11605074	it will some what affect your chances, but when it comes down to it high school coaches look more for power hitters and big arm pitchers than anything anyways, i bet they'll pick you on the team and put you at first base or something|`|tFK2gI8Saa	well it depends are you just a slow runner or are you just not good at long runs, because baseball is more about short bust then the long run stamina will come with playing, if your not good at long runs never play soccer|`|p4szdxrCaa	this will affect your chances but if you run everyday you'll be fine. since you're a power hitter, you should try out for DH wich is the guy who doesn't field but just hits.|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	Baseball isn't a long distance running sport...you will be okay.|`|UAdBIO8Gaa	Well there are always exceptions so if you have a really strong bat you might be a DH or something.|`|5yZICXImaa	Being fast is good and makes it kind of even but you don't really have any long runs. Think of this 90 feet inbetween the bases. If you hit an inside the parker which is uncommon than you will need to run a total 360 feet which isn't that far. Basically just running maybe 1-2 miles a day and keep gradually adding to it until you reach 5 would be good enough. If you can go more great.|`|Wx6yx6YMaa	Just anytime you can go outside and run for a little bit. By the season you will be able to run around the bases just fine.

Hansborough is being projecteed late first round or early second round, I think, so he would probably be available if the Bobcatts want to draft him.|`|6yoQhXsOaa	Yea he will probably go there because that's where all the scrubs go, especially the ones from unc like sean may and raymond felton.|`|mfeBND6Saa	There is a chance because he's probably a top 20 pick and the Bobcats are almost in the playoffs<br>  One game out as of now|`|94973fa39f63e1edca181dd2ec4f438aaa	Depends on what pick they have in the draft. if they are in the first five picks they got a good chance to get him.

It is not part of any karate styles that I am aware of. There is a demo of a girl showing how to perform the kick. Doing this will cause you to get hurt in a fight. You would be too easily off balanced. You can't deliver any power with that so-called kick. You would not be able to defend yourself with your leg that high. In my personal opinion it is useless in martial arts.<br>  <br>  The scorpion kick is actually a kick done in soccer. It is not done like the lady did in this video clip.<br>  <br>  In martial arts the closest thing to that kick is a spinning heel hook kick.|`|5Aw8zfruaa	The girls name is Chloe Bruce, she does Tae Kwon Do.

The 3point line is i believe 30 ft away.

BK1GjPT6aa	Alex, <br>  If I had a nickel for ever Banjo Minnow question....<br>  <br>  You've been on this board long enough to know where the "discover" link is at. Use it and you'll find 1 million and one best answers for the banjo minnow. I'm not trying to be asinine or anything close to that but I swear to Atlantis, if I read another "Banjo Minnow " question I'm gonna stick a hook in a fish's lips and use it for bait. ~good luck catchin'.|`|Ok3XlTV3aa	I tried them last year.  I tried every combination of weight, color, size, etc I could think of.  I fished it exactly like the DVD told me to also but no luck.  Save your money and buy something more proven like other soft plastics.  Good luck|`|amlmhoUuaa	I would rather use a plastic lizard or worm over that thing any day and they are a whole lot more less expensive|`|SEpHGcnKaa	They do work. At times. I've gotten several crappie and redear on them but I have yet to catch a decent bass on one. The biggest bass I've gotten on a Banjo Minnow is about 15" long and about a pound.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I regret spending the money on my own, and the other two that I bought for my dad and older brother. They haven't caught anything on them.<br>  <br>  <br>  Like everyone else said, stick to plastics. I'll stick to my plastic worms.|`|KbxPl1oYaa	Better to go with Berkley Gulp plastics... more scent... more fish.  I've tried the Banjo minnows... they didn't work better than any other plastic.  <br>  <br>  The Gulp brand though... better in both fresh and saltwater.  I'll try them first before any other artificial.|`|ec2Lhkbwaa	no i would say they are not worth the money and plus you'll prberly have more luck with plastic worms|`|rV4uJVWmaa	My grandfather and i went through the banjo minnow craze years ago. I would rather have a plastic worm anyday.
MuuTGyGSaa	Let me break it down.<br>  You have an amazing catcher who hits for average. He is definitely going to be a top 2 catcher- and there are very few good catchers<br>  first base- Morneau- cannot go wrong there, he has a lot of power, which translates to HRS and RBIS<br>  2B- Last year I was too hesitant to pick up Pedroia, but now I believe he is a keeper. He is like Kinsler, does a little bit of everything.<br>  SS- Jeter is declining, but he is still a top 5 SS. He had a slump last season, so if he can perform, you may have gotten a really good pickup<br>  2b/ss- hes okay...<br>  same for 1b/3b<br>  OF- those are ridiculously strong. Braun is amazing. He puts up an okay average, but man, does he know how to swing a bat; Markakis is great, and Kemp had a good season last year, so he may repeat<br>  Your utility and bench are not that great, but with a lineup like that, i do not know if it matters<br>  P- let me get this straight...CC, Haren, Joba, Wang, and Saunders!!! I won my league last year with no one close (but my offense was deadly)<br>  <br>  Honestly, if MOST of your players can stay healthy, you will win this league.<br>  10/10|`|Gm1xk05Baa	you have a kick *** team 9/10. alot of power and great pitching. utilities are kinda bad though (i dont know why every team ive seen so far has ryan theriot) but i think a few good trades can improve that. also great starting pitching and a deep bull pen with street, devine, and lindstrom|`|i9eAnKsBaa	9/10<br>  get rid of chris ray and matt lindstorm but otherwise amazing team<br>  Q-how u get so good players?|`|AA11720887	Devine and Ray are not closers. Look in the free agent list and find a Gil Menche or someone like him and dump them. Other than pitching, you look good.|`|3mZyMnjfaa	not to bad your pitching is strong and u have a well balanced u should do well in your league
w173betxaa	No, the next 3 hour show will be the week after wrestlemania...The  2009 Draft.|`|8h5dqzf6aa	no|`|95uXmC94aa	haha no. they probably didnt do the daylight savings thing. trust me i would know. i'm obsessed!|`|OuFhcdX9aa	no and raw is on 9pm to 11pm. not 1 to 3.|`|85aWKsptaa	no|`|R4dXxh6paa	uhhhhhh....no|`|qtwYHyH5aa	N0O|`|ZLGr6pX3aa	I noticed that to was just thinking the same thing|`|zbjF53nraa	no its just because they didnt do the daylight savings thing|`|OfutBhxYaa	no|`|lz7oTQNXaa	no idea mate, i guess it will start normal time tho.|`|qqLcvDDKaa	That would be cool if it was, but no.
Cl6KbcAGaa	Look kid you should know your dad better than we possibly could (I dont know him at all) Any advise that I would have would be pure speculation as to what he is thinking and I would likely be wrong too! You are his son and you dont know him well enough to figure this one out on your own?|`|S2w8hOj1aa	if its your money why cant you buy it? What if you offer to buy the bike for HIM?  That will get his attention!! (and after that you can just ride it all the time)  It might just work!|`|5nbFcdElaa	Go to him and tell him about the saddest thing in you life (one which he knows about) then ask him about the first time you had a bike. then BAm hit him with your question. and if he says no, then compromise (Like, tell him you will pay a certain amount of it, or you can tell him to not give you allowance till your bike is paid in full) <br>  <br>  :) Hope you get it|`|TU22dLgDaa	Is an email out of the question?<br>  <br>  I once had to write a letter to my Dad for him to see my point of view. Maybe an email would work.
3k2NjOWsaa	I think that's really great!!  I t would sound even better if u repeated it twice or maybe 3 times|`|cWyjO8vBaa	not really...|`|NcA7RSCkaa	heck no|`|qcnHFwSaaa	Maybe. If you change it around a bit so its not so repetitive.
014d662e9ccdcc2dfcbd68b27f469d57aa	At our school we do calf exercises to strengthen your calf muscles. <br>  Here are some excercises:<br>  Squats (sitting against the wall without a chair)<br>  Leg press<br>  Jump Ross<br>  Skips<br>  Running (sprints)<br>  Jumping<br>  Rebounding drills<br>  <br>  Believe it or not your jump will improve|`|ec2b1a1c9534c53c26c3b18b2f00d42aaa	I tried this and I THINK my vertical jump increase a little bit. <br>  <br>  Put a weight jacket in your BODY, not ankle, not leg, but BODY then try run few steps then JUMP, repeat it over and over. You might see an increase of your jump. <br>  <br>  Do some weight training on your leg / thigh also, because it's the source of jumping power. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|C4mzZwiWaa	practice...|`|HE6S36fQaa	wear ankle weights and keep jumping until you get use to the weight then upgrade the weight <br>  I think you should start with 5 pounds on each side then keep adding 2 more pounds after getting u getting use to the oe your currently using|`|TbPyTIXpaa	plyometrics get in shape and workout your legs and have low body fat probably lower than 10 % or 10% would be good|`|IlsXc1KDaa	Let Yao Ming carry you.|`|MKyM9MuFaa	Running and jumping a lot. Literally. Ankle lifts and strong legs. Jump a lot and you'll get higher.

7ImGw976aa	Most likely have Shawn and HHH cross paths and join up again at some point but most likely no to the rest considering none of the others are around in WWE anymore. I personally liked the original lot more though, used to always be at least a 3 person group at all times.|`|f2d3d8edde822210301b7dc5946235ecaa	Maybe for one match or something like that.|`|9ttLI7S5aa	i think everyone has been wandering that for awhile, but i can honestly say, wait to the draft|`|u8GHTJEEaa	They're being advertised for RAW next week here in San Antonio.

This could be a post show dark match or it might actually be on the show.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	Triple H and Shawn Michaels tag team at House Shows all the time. It's no big deal, unless you never go to House Shows. Triple H and Shawn have tag teamed in just about every country the WWE has ever gone to.|`|zbjF53nraa	like everybody else is sayin for like one match, but no way forever because triple h is set to always be the top dogg type of guy winin world titles and shawn is set to just set a lot of historic moments in the wwe before he retires(which hopefully wont be too soon) and bein in DX for too long would just be a waste of time now|`|VlvektSJaa	I hope not.<br>  <br>  DX is played out. They should forget that stuff.<br>  Sure I enjoy The Attitude flash back as much as everybody else.<br>  But they got to realize they killed it already and move on.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	Triple H and Shawn Michaels? They're bound for another get-together sooner or later. As for the old members (X Pac, Chyna, Road Dogg, Billy Gunn), I doubt it|`|mJvZhdAuaa	It is undeniable, there will be at least one time when Triple H and Shawn Michaels reunite as DX.

OCc9cC1Haa	fullback hands down you perfect size and height. have you ever thought about dt?|`|6iuZEUhzaa	slow. get faster.<br>  your so self centered.<br>  yeah i got big calves and a muscular chest.<br>  dude. im 6'1" and play MLB for moore in staten island, NY.<br>  the best one on the team is Tom, whose 5'7" 140lbs. he hits low and hes tough. so who cares?|`|a7bfee8f94afdfd3ac16e448849ea19faa	tall enough to be a good shield as full back, heavy enough for a blocking full back in high school, and tall enough to be good on the short pass, but that depends on your hands and whether you can catch; im assuming you can as you are thinking of tight end.|`|MuuTGyGSaa	I would go with Defensive end. You draw comparisons to Brian Orakpo, the top DE in the draft, if you know who that is. He does about the same weights, so I can pretty much understand why you are bulky and muscular.<br>  <br>  The main reason I would not become a fullback is because you need to have under a 4.8 to be a good one. There are obviously exceptions, but this is in general.<br>  <br>  As a DE, you need to figure out how to get under a 5, which I can see you are trying to do with track.<br>  <br>  Build wise, you are perfect for both, but I would go with DE if I were you- you can be more effective on the field without having to be very fast for your height/weight|`|AA10816466	yeah, that sound like a good fit, or maybe even linebacker, if you got quicker you could be a power halfback|`|54OvilHuaa	ive seen guys smaller than u play dt<br>  i ply mlb for div.3 high school<br>  u cld play linebacker<br>  but d end is problay a better fit|`|9s9mUUubaa	You're good. You have a good build and ignore the other guy, you're not self-centered but I think you do need get a little faster.|`|acff4bbcffd769f78d77467433841c67aa	yea u seem like u can play DE with those numbers, not to sure abt FB tho....
ZKikquiOaa	Get yourself to a range, if you're in the US there are some ranges that offer free equipment and advice.  Go to www.usarchery.org, and search for a range.  If there are none near you, then see if you can find a store.  <br>  <br>  When starting with a recurve, you do have to put in more time practicing than if you start with a compound.  If you start now, you won't start hunting until about next year if not longer with a recurve.  You need to build your form and your strength.<br>  <br>  So I suggest, find a range, start shooting the correct way then somewhere down the road buy the equipment that is right for you.  It's very hard to try to digest all of it all at once.  Take it slow and you'll enjoy it more.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Go here for all the information.*<> www.3riversarchery.com........There are lots of Bows and Accessories on Ebay if you want to save a lot of $$$$.*.....You can E-mail me if you have any other questions about archery hunting.*|`|KCjVdgvSaa	don't worry about all of the tech  stuff  as a beginner get your  the write size bow then get the wright arrow length im tall and have a 31 in reach <br>   then get a good set of sights  after that shoot as often as you can talk to as manny people as you can people have a lot of good ideas but after you get that buy a Very good stand and keep it maintained  that is Very important i almost died 3 yrs ago because i was bum and shoot out of you re stand 25 yards is different out of a stand than out of you re yard <br>  a local archery shop can help with most of that|`|hVJovD6Haa	Targetbutt is right find a club near you that offers JOAD classes (Junior Olympic Archery Development) <a href="http://www.usarchery.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.usarchery.org.</a> This will teach you the proper stance, form, release etc and the clubs usually have equipment available for use during the classes. There are children and adult classes available.<br>  <br>  Your questions about arrows are best answered at a pro shop and yes you do have to pay for most tips (even if they are already on the shaft the cost is built into the price.) Each arrow has different characteristics and will react with a bow in a different manner based on draw weight etc so before you buy anything get to a pro shop. Shooting the wrong arrow could ruin the bow.|`|TBAfpnmgaa	Before you spend a lot of money and buy something you don't need, find a local bow shop that offers rentals and training. There's no replacement for experience.|`|bgxYKsGiaa	whats the head of a arrow and you cant just get into archery/hunting and the only season now is turkey season|`|TGCpExqYaa	I definately wouldn't begin archery hunting with a recurve bow.  You will start out wounding a lot of animals.  Get a decent compound bow and practice with it.  Arrows do not come with "heads"  You have to buy them.  You will need to buy field tips to practice with, and then broadheads to hunt with.  100 grain grim reaper broadheads are by far the best broadhead on the market.  I've killed many many deer with them and have never had a problem.

W5AN9LYhaa	Beach Rule differences<br>  Can't open hand tip<br>  Can't directional block<br>  Block counts as a contact<br>  Usually played with 2 players<br>  Games are usually played to 21 points, 3rd game to 15<br>  You switch sides of the court during the game. For example, in a 21 point game, you switch sides every 7 points. So for example, if the score is 4-3, switch sides. 10-4 switch sides. 15-6 switch sides, etc.<br>  <br>  In doubles, you can't double contact the ball with your fingers on the first team contact.<br>  <br>  Doubles is usually played on a smaller court. Each side is 1 meter thinner in width and 1 meter shorter in length.<br>  <br>  Doubles is sometimes played without antennas. If no antenna, then play to the pole.<br>  <br>  When playing on the beach, the wind is a factor. Also, playing surface is tougher to deal with. You also have the sun and maybe rain to deal with. <br>  <br>  The beach is great for learning to anticipate because you must cover so much court, you must anticipate your opponent. Strategy is much more obvious. For example, when a player starts to play doubles, they soon realize it's best to hit the ball to the area of the court where their opponent isn't. This is less obvious with indoor because there are so many players on the court, there isn't as much open court. <br>  <br>  The beach has the advantage of learning all the skills. For example, it's either you or your partner that's going to pass. You can't go hide in the corner like indoor. One of you must step up and make the play. And if your partner passes, you must go set. So everyone must learn to set. If your partner sets, you must hit. <br>  <br>  Beach volleyball is a sport that's played outdoors in a fun and relaxed environment. This can be a great break from a stressful indoor season. Many player's having trouble improving at volleyball when they play indoor because they are constantly afraid to make mistakes and let down their team. On the beach, it's only you and your teammate. There's no coach giving instruction or yelling at you. You learn to motivate yourself and play to your own pre established standards.|`|hUbNKOTsaa	beach: outside, 2 players, cant slide on your knees<br>  indoor:inside, 6 players, can slide on your knees<br>  <br>  thats really all thats different|`|70KKuEtMaa	Havent played either for quite a awhile now, but one unique difference used to be that in indoor vball, any contact with ball below the waist was illegal. <br>  In outdoor, below the waist was legal as long as it was a clean hit.<br>  (...not that any one I ever played with made much use of that rule).|`|uPmTt3XRaa	2 people vs. 6 on the court.

BB6HGbnPaa	You are going to have to work really hard to get that scholarship. Most people that get scholarship are born to run or just been running for a very long time. Since you just started, I doubt a scholarship will be in your future. But if you can hit under 50 in the 400m, possibly a scholarship is in your grasp. But just know that there are other people in this country that can run faster than 50 in the 400m.|`|uI6xVxvqaa	I think Division I schools need you to run a sub 49. I'm not sure about Division II schools probably around a 51 and Division III you can pretty much just walk on. So I think you could have a chance for Division II just talk with your coach and he/she will give you some pointers.

hPFltfxoaa	This would be matter of opinion.  If it is a handgun this would be a high velocity round.  If it were a rife it would be in the medium area.  Google ballistics tables.|`|fUDlbOP0aa	that will vary depending on caliber. <br>  in a .22 S/L/LR that would be record-breaking. the current fastest is 1640 fps<br>  in a .17 HMR that would be low, its normally 2500 fps<br>  in a .22 WMR that would be low, normally 2200-2500 fps<br>  for all handguns that would be extremely high, all that is chambered in pistol calibers. <br>  for all shotguns that would be very high<br>  for most muzzle loaders that would be high velocity. most black powder guns shoot subsonic or just supersonic. <br>  <br>  for nearly all modern centerfire rifle cartridges that would be low to extremely low.|`|AA10517492	High for a pistol but I would say on the low side for for a rifle. Here is a good ballistic site.|`|GHD8JicSaa	Old black powder guns had a muzzle velocity around 700 feet per second.  That is why they went with big bullets.   (60 Caliber Hawkins for example.)   They could not stop you with speed so the heavy bullet made up for it.  <br>  <br>  With modern nitrate based powders,  a muzzle velocity around 3000 feet per second is not unusual.  Which is why rounds have gotten smaller.   The M16 for example shoots a bullet not much bigger than a 22 long rifle.  <br>  <br>  2000 feet per second is very fast for a pistol bullet and mid range for a rifle bullet.|`|YgPf2UVMaa	High.<br>  A 22 is around 1255 @ 40 grains. (not subsonic)<br>  A 9mm is around 1050 @ 135 grains.

xOReEw6Waa	Before choosing a rifle, I would look at the type cartridge you were wanting to shoot. Most centerfire/hunting cartridges will be adequate to 300 plus yards; that means anything from .17 Remington to .458 Lott or larger if you wanted to. Lets concentrate on the readily available and easy to load or buy for. <br>  <br>  223 is the most popular range-target weapon currently. It is relatively cheap to shoot, has many platforms to choose from and everyone builds one. You can select a good range of bullet weights from 40 grain up to 90 grain with the proper barrel twist. Since it is a military and varmint caliber there are a lot of components available, but demand is high for ammo right now. <br>  204 Ruger is a very nice, flat shooting cartridge in various platforms, and has minimal recoil. Not as ballistically potent as the .223, it is still a tack driver and good coyote/varmint round within it's shooting envelope.<br>  22-250 is a wonderfully accurate cartridge in the right guns, and many people's choice for all target and varmint applications. The 22-250 took over the spot the .222 had held for a few years, and is hugely popular.<br>  The .243 Winchester is a very good cartridge based on the 308 case. You can go from target, to varmint to deer with proper bullet selection with the 243 and similar 6mm Remington cartridge. <br>  Any of the above is capable of single hole groups at 100 or more yards in a near standard bolt rifle with good ammo or handloads.<br>  <br>  Handloading is well worth the efforts for better accuracy, not simply for being economical. You can fine tune the loads to the gun and bullet combination and control the Cartridge Overall Length (COL) much better. If you don't want to handload for yourself right away you can usually find a friend or someone willing to load for you if you make the right deal. <br>  There are a lot of mid caliber cartridges like the 6.5x55 Swede that offer amazing ballistic potential and are also great hunting rounds, when loaded with the right bullets. The 25-06, 270, 7mm-08, 7mm Mauser and other cartridges like the 264 Win Mag and 284 fall into this area. Most of these cartridges will use a longer bodied bullet with the higher grain weights and thus are inherently very accurate. <br>  moving up to the 30 caliber bring in the 308,30-06, various Mag offerings and things like the Weatherby 30-378, a real beast.<br>  <br>  Personally I would opt for a multi-purpose capability for varmint-target or target-hunting. That make it for me the .223, 243, 6.5 Swede, and the 308. I prefer my 30-06 for hunting, but the 308 is more readily adapted for target use. <br>  As for optics, a good quality Leupold or Nikon at 6x16 40mm to 50mm scope without anything fancy like mil-dots or BDC would be my choice because I would know my weapon and reloads well enough to compensate without the added fuss of trying to line up and guess on someplace other than the dead center crosshair. <br>  <br>  As for actual rifle, I would stay with bolt actions, though the AR platforms CAN be just as accurate. The bolt actions usually are better out of the box, and you can tweak them more readily. Most bolt actions that will shoot well also cost less than a comparable AR. <br>  Each manufacturer now has "Varmint" or "Tactical" rifles available. I would get a rifle with a heavy barrel and wide fore end for stability.<br>  Tikka, Savage.Remington, and others offer these as packages. If I were simply looking at target-varmint type shooting I would opt for the CZ Varmint specific model in 223. I would get a Tikka,Savage or Remington in 308 for target-hunting applications.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	First of all, "Long range rifle' starts at 300 Yd.s and goes out from there.<br>  If you plan to learn competition target rifle shooting, don't go spending <br>  a lot until you're good enough to appreciate it.<br>  By then you'll have a good idea of what you want.<br>  Start out with a medium-heavy barrel bolt action. Just about anything <br>  you buy these days will shoot 1 1/4 MOA or so 'right out of the box'<br>  and it will be quite a while before you're that good.<br>  Savage looks interesting.<br>  Top it with a 6-24x variable. (You won't be comfortable with more than <br>  about 12X until you learn to steady down.)<br>  Except for zeroing in bench time is wasted time, (& ammo).<br>  Start learning your position shooting early.<br>  Most of your time in prone at first, but 'get the feel' of <br>  sitting kneeling, and offhand early.<br>  As to reloading, you will do well to keep your cost to about 60 cents per round.<br>  Premium ammunition costs more, but will be a waste of money for <br>  quite a while.<br>  Buy low cost  'Federal' ammo, and save your brass for when you do <br>  start to reload. (It's a large part of the cost. Cases only last about <br>  4 or 5 high intensity loads.)<br>  You will have to learn a lot to reload ammo even as good as that Federal standard<br>  <br>  Patience is a big part of the game. - Enjoy.|`|BckKMf0zaa	Rem 700 .308 with a bushnell 6-24 scope and don't re-lode until you have a bit of experience.|`|QNX9NET3aa	A lot depends on how much you are willing to spend.

HE6S36fQaa	what you should do is start out with the basics such as get a good running start,but not to fast you will hit the backboard to hard  you should bring up the same knee that you are using ur hand ( in this case left, bring up your left knee) push with your right foot.|`|GY3QTszgaa	start using your left hand to do every thing so that your left is used to working. its natural for it to not be as effective at 1st(same with me). start eating with a spoon,fork with your left. start writing with it and shoot jumpshots with your left to it helps. practice left hand layups. probably make 50-100 left layups a day. try to use your left hand for everything and lift a mini dumbell with it too. try using backboard with your left and when its good enough you can start to shoot without. i used to make mad jumpers with my left. even hook-shots too.|`|sytw0BFBaa	I broke my right hand once and played around with nothing but my left, eventually i got good at it. pretend like ur right arm isn't there. once you perfect that you will move on to shooting with both hands, you will benefit greatly.|`|SHqTITSSaa	All I can do is tell you to first improve you lefty dribble and then lay up in is just a easy as making a foul shot|`|INY7MEj9aa	Alright so you want to improve your left handed lay up?  This is what you need to do.  <br>  <br>  The proper way to shoot a left handed lay up is pushing off with you right foot and with your left knee bent up in the air.  <br>  <br>  To get used to the position all you need to do is first stand close to the basket but not so close that you are right under it.  Then just do a one step lay up.  Stepping with your right foot and then bringing up ur left knee and shooting with your left hand.  (as i explained up above).  Do this a bunch of times so you get comfortable with the propper form.  Then just gradually move farther out until you can run full court at full speed and make a left handed layup. Woot!! I hope this helped and good luck!|`|iW3HJBe3aa	You have to practice but don't practice 50 percent layups by yourself.

In most states either the crossed out handgun or the sign claiming no weapons have no backing under the law.  <br>  <br>  Remember once asked/told to leave and you do not you could be arrested for trespassing.|`|YxpHWFpJaa	Many of these answers are correct. In my state if they post a "No guns" sign on the door it means very little. A company policy here does not over rule your god given right to bear arms. Now if they ask you to leave, just as another said, you must leave or you can be charged with trespassing. And it must be a manager. The police cannot ask you to leave. That would be like me visiting your house and asking your cousin to leave. Only the one in charge can ask you to exit the premises.|`|lT8MEI6Raa	Yes, they can restrict the carrying of handguns on their property, which includes their parking lots, although I don't know how they could enforce that one. It's the same as if I wanted to restrict someone from bringing a handgun into my house, I have the right to. So do businesses|`|koHKdj10aa	They can in Minnesota, but they have to ut up a sign that says that guns are banned on their property.

If you a wimp and getting hit by a ball makes you cry definitely not lacrosse.

Lax- strong, "bigmusclear wise) and tough, Dance- petite, thin, and graceful.<br>  <br>  Softball is also fun if you can hit the ball and if you are good at sprints then you would be good at it too. <br>  <br>  As for scholarships, I have no idea. Dance and lax probably wouldn't be the best for that, but they are fun. I would try to find something else for sholarships cuz sports scholarships people ALL they do is their sport and that is it and if they do bad for a season then the scholarship is gone.

XxQVSzGiaa	its because you are out of shape. if you continue everyday with it, the cramps will come up after longer periods of time. i just started track and had the same problem:]|`|Jr9j5f6naa	drink lots of water every day, but not an hour or less before you run. make sure to take deep breaths, not just quick gasping ones. when I say deep, I don't mean get as much air as you can, because obviously thats going to get tiring.|`|9Pyzw2Zxaa	Well it usually means that you're a bit out of shape, or you just didn't drink enough water. Try to drinking lots of water before running ( but don't quench youself to the point of throwup!) If its because you're out of shape, then just keep jogging and it should go away temporarily, I run everyday for 2 hours,but when i started jogging, my stomach cramped like crazy! It was also because i didn't drink enough water, that might be ur case. hope i helped :)|`|jLHkM5ijaa	You should walk for 3 days then go little faster for 3 more days and keep pushing your self and you can even go for 2- 5 days between pushing yourself keep trying

kRBFMWdBaa	From ESPN.com:<br>  <br>  As the Pacific Life Open plays out in California, Venus and Serena Williams are, as usual, nowhere to be found. But I'm hoping this will be the last year of their Indian Wells boycott.<br>  <br>  Here's a little background for those of you who don't know why the sisters haven't played in Indian Wells since 2001. At the time, the 20-year-old Venus and the 19-year-old Serena were still relatively new to tennis fans (they had three major titles between them). At Indian Wells, they were scheduled to play each other in the semifinals until, minutes before the match began, Venus withdrew with tendonitis in her knee. The sold-out stadium was, to put it mildly, disappointed and skeptical of the injury. During Serena's final against Kim Clijsters, fans booed Serena; they also booed Richard Williams and Venus when they walked to their seats to watch. Richard Williams said the crowd's reaction was racist. He also claimed that several fans had insulted him and his daughters with racial slurs. The Williams family hasn't shown up at this tournament since.<br>  <br>  When the WTA Tour announced last year that Indian Wells would become one of its four mandatory events in 2009, Serena said the odds that she would end her boycott were "slim to none," no matter what penalties the tour imposed on her (the tour hasn't made a final decision, but the punishment for skipping a mandatory tournament will likely include a fine and could -- and in my opinion, should -- include a suspension that would bar a player for competing in the next tournament on her schedule). Since then, though, the tour and Team Williams have been talking. Here are five reasons Larry Scott, the tour's CEO, should be able to convince the sisters to put 2001 behind them (disclosure: the owners of Tennis Magazine hold a significant stake in the Pacific Life Open):<br>  <br>  Local fans: Do you think the Williams sisters, upon returning to Indian Wells, would be greeted with another round of boos? Um, no. My guess is this would become one of those welcome-back lovefests that inspires thousands of complimentary words in newspapers, magazines and on television. The sisters are perhaps more likeable than ever these days: Lots of personality (as always), still fantastic players, but also vulnerable and not expected to pummel every opponent. Matches involving another player and a Williams sister used to seem like unfair fights. Not anymore, and that's good for drama. Fans would go bonkers over their return.<br>  <br>  American tennis: Have you heard that American tennis is dying? That could be true, though I'm not convinced that it's going to die -- as in, never to return -- rather than just hibernate for a while. Either way, the sisters could help the cause of the United States Tennis Association -- right now -- if they didn't skip one of the two largest tournaments in the U.S. outside the U.S. Open. The U.S. has seen a lot of tournaments migrate to Europe and elsewhere in the last 20 years; it can't afford to host big events that are boycotted by its two most recognizable and talented players. (Yes, the sisters are both more talented and more recognizable than any of the U.S. men.)<br>  <br>  Equal prize money: The four majors and several other tournaments have agreed to pay men and women equally in no small part because of Venus Williams. She has been a great advocate. (The definition of "great advocate," according to Merriam-Webster, is, "Anyone who convinces the folks at Wimbledon to change their views.") Because of her efforts, Indian Wells agreed to offer equal prize money next year (it had to if it wanted to become a mandatory event). Venus, why not celebrate the good you have done and play?|`|EzSMKnG9aa	at the 2001 tournament, there was a semi-final scheduled between Serena and Venus Williams and the stadium was packed and the crowds were excited to watch the match. However, Venus withdrew before the start of the match and the fans started booing the Williams sisters for what happened.<br>  the next day, the crowds also were giving racist comment to Richard (Serena's father) and he said in an interview later that it was horrible and racist.<br>  I think that the Williams sisters should forget the incident as i am sure that the crowds won't do anything like that anymore. but this incident seems to have had an effect on them and i don't blame them, because things like that stay in you memory and it's hard to forget.|`|e26a6d1bc492d2de7a8edcc3478c5300aa	Let us cut through the chase.  This boycott is symbolic in that we African-Americans have zero tolerance for the behaviors displayed by the crowd at Indian Wells and for the organizers flimsy response to the event. Unfortunately this issue is bigger than the WTA and is pandemic in American society.  You are not going to call us out of our names and taunt us with your ignorance and then expect us to grin and bare it or continue to show up to your events when the underlying sentiment toward us has not changed.  8 years is nothing in comparison to the hundreds of years we have been battling against these conditions.|`|MIAbLr4Vaa	@ Tom k:all this things happened when serena Williams was only 19 years old,her sister Venus 20 and they did not even apologized to them,wether the WTA ceo,the Indian Wells owner (chris Evert,Billie Jean king,Pete sampras) and the Williams  should go and play there?

It doesn't matter the wins/losses, it is who wins the final game in the bracket.<br>  <br>  So Japan beat China and Korea, so Japan goes to the finals.<br>  Taipei lost to China and Korea, so they are out (double elimination).<br>  China lost to Korea and Japan, so China is out (double elimination).<br>  <br>  That leaves 2 teams for the final in Pool A: Korea and Japan to fight for the championship.

ec2Lhkbwaa	it is indeed it is also illegal in florida and a few other states ...this is because certain species of fish cant digest corn very well and its poisonous to some species .<br>  <br>  Commission fisheries biologist Tom Bender at our Benner Spring Fish Research Station conducted a study in 1992 that examined the impact of corn on trout. For the study, two groups of hatchery rainbow trout were held in separate tanks and tested for 54 days. In one tank, 20 rainbow trout (average size 8.3 inches) were fed a diet of whole kernel corn. In the second tank, 20 rainbow trout of the same size were fed a standard trout pellet diet.<br>  <br>  During the 54 day study period, no mortalities occurred from trout of either study group. However, study results did show that the trout fed with a corn diet did not digest the corn particularly well. The growth observed by the corn-fed trout during the study period was only about half of that observed from the trout that were fed the standard trout pellet diet.<br>  <br>  The conclusion from this study was that there appears to be little reason for concern about the short term health hazards for rainbow trout when whole kernel corn is used for bait. Although there are better diets for trout than whole kernel corn, this study confirms that mortality does not occur when trout ingest whole kernel corn.|`|O4wYyo7laa	Me and my buddy were fishing for carp using corn as bait and got a warning from a game warden. He didn't give us a ticket. We had three good size carp on a stringer in the water he overlooked. Corn turned out to be good bait. I can't even begin to understand why corn is illegal. Don't make any sense at all.|`|bRXuAgCqaa	it is illegal to chum with corn where I fish.Check your state and county DNR website to be sure.|`|amlmhoUuaa	I have never heard of that before we always used it and it works great,but now I'm not sure if I will use it any more unless I am going to eat the fish I catch with it.

6mMasEsNaa	I suggest starting slowly and incrementing slowly. You need the time to slowly build your legs and lungs.This way you will avoid injuries. And once you are at the 6mile point then you will stay there without any problems. The source website www.run0to60.com has a very good program for your situation. Check it out.|`|Jr9j5f6naa	first of all, that is a LOT of running, and I wouldn't do that unless you're used to it. if you don't normally run long distance, starting out with 6 miles a day is not healthy! if your goal is 6, I would say start out with 1 1/2 miles a day. then add on 1/2 miles every week. if one distance gets too challenging, continue with that for an extra week. this way you know you are not pushing yourself too far. <br>  <br>  Stopping and going isn't the best thing, either. stopping makes your muscles tighten, and your heat rate slow, which can make it harder to run again. but to answer your question, yes, practicing will make you better. <br>  <br>  I would also suggest repition workouts; so do 2 400's, 2 200's, and 2 100's or something. It will get you in better shape.|`|AA10241450	Yes, what you doing can be called intervals - your breaking down 6 miles and walking, jogging and running.  The more you run the more you body will adjust for aerobic exercise.  Good luck!|`|8to6MsWuaa	Yeah, keep going. Each day, count how many minutes you have to stop. Each day try to ruduce your time spent walking. Pretty soon you will be able to run the whole six miles.

NaJEkHo2aa	In my view, yes.  Undertaker never b*tched and moaned about a title match until he got one (hopefully not?), and got where he is today without loads of backstage politics.  Also, another major accomplishment is the amount of respect the Undertaker has from his peers and wrestlers alike.  Not saying Triple H doesn't have respect, just not from the same amount of people.  Another, is that Undertaker is seen like a Father-figure to some of the younger wrestlers in the locker-room.  I would think Undertaker would be like a Chris Benoit (RIP) type; if he saw a younger wrestler disrespect a veteran, he'd somehow punish them.  So, to answer your questions: Yes, the Undertaker is more successful than Triple H.<br>  <br>  WQ: The WS would probably be flooded with questions about him forever.  Spectulating whether or not he'll make a side Wrestlemania appearance or come back for one final match.|`|6ueL0gkAaa	IMO Taker is. He didnt marry into the family to get ahead and has consistently changed his gimmick to adapt with the times, which has been the key to his longevity with the company. HHH on the other hand wouldnt have as many title reigns as he has under his belt without the marriage. <br>  <br>  When Taker retires, the WS wont shut up about it. I'll just ignore those questions though.|`|b7JS16dyaa	Yes, because he captured the imaginations of people right around the time he made his debut. Triple H needed D-X and the rub from Shawn Michaels before people cared about him. <br>  <br>  Both are great, but I'd give Taker the edge. People still respect and cheer more for the Phenom than the Game. Scripted title wins don't mean much, in my opinion. I think that's proven when despite Triple H's 13 WHCs, people cheer more for Taker, who's only had 6 reigns.<br>  <br>  WQ2: Yes, right when it's announced... Do you really need to ask why?|`|AA10576425	Yes.. Taker is more successful than HHH.. I don't think HHH would have attained this status if he had not married Stephanie!<br>  Not for long.. People would get busy with the then current happenings..|`|qtwYHyH5aa	Ofcourse, I mean The Undertaker is so succesful, he's the Phenom..SD WOULDNT GET AS GOOD RATINGS WITHOUT THE UNDERTAKER.|`|swcY0xuOaa	YEAH!!! he won like 17 wrestlemanias in a row and undeafeted|`|NRs72Afxaa	That's a hard one. These two are famous, but in my opinion Undertaker earned his spot the hard way. It took him since 1984 to earn his spot and by 1990 which was his Wwf debut he quickly became popular. Undertaker is a hard worker in this buisness.<br>  <br>  Triple H is more successful with the controversy he has. From the Clique to marring Stephenie Mcmahon and becoming a 13 World Champion in Wwf/e. <br>  <br>  Triple H is more successful in this business, but Undertaker is the best hard worker.<br>  <br>  WQ2: I dare not to think about it, but atleast he doesn't have plans to retire soon.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Yes, if you measure success by respect then Taker is light years ahead. <br>  WQ2: Probably a month, maybe two...deserves more though.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Ah, Clown!<br>  Your going to get my blood boiling if I have to compare Taker to ... HHH<br>  I will try not to get censored!<br>  <br>  Taker is definitely more successful than HHH and from all that I've read this has been one of the sources of heat between the two. <br>  To me success is not necessarily measured by your win/loss record or the number of titles you have. Let's face it, any "celebrity" can hold a title, and if you only hold it for one day the point is you've still held it.<br>  It's not even measured by the amount of money you make.<br>  HHH has all the above. Taker has something more. He has the name power. The fans automatically think of him when you mention things like "undefeated," "legend," "workhorse," "respect," "loyalty," "classic matches" (etc)<br>  And Taker also has the respect of the guys in the back, as well as those behind the scenes. He has earned their respect the old fashioned way..he worked for it. <br>  <br>  WQ2/ Knowing folks on this section and how much they LOVE Taker, it will go on for a good few months! Look how long we have been talking about his WM match!|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	That would depend on how you judge success. If it is on titles then no. But I don't fly that way, just look at Edge, 8 time champion and he is so bad. Personally I think that Taker is more successful because he has had to work for all of his fame, where as HHH got a free ride there for awhile because of Steph.<br>  <br>  WQ2: Probably not long. Mainly because people are fickle and someone new will come alone soon enough.|`|SJJEF5Vyaa	Yeah.<br>  Because when i think WWE/F I think Undertaker.<br>  WQ- For maybe a month because the people that claim that they are '' Wrestling Fans'' will have something to talk about.|`|6KZA7D97aa	taker is WWE.

Mr. Kennedy: I want to see the WWE title on Him, and I don't care what brand either. Kennedy has great mic skills and is awesome in the ring.<br>  <br>  #2.) Christian: I think He is great on ECW. He and Swagger are bring talent and making the show watchable again.<br>  <br>  #3.) Batista: Move back to SmackDown! and feud with The Undertaker because I think they put on a good show together.<br>  <br>  #4.) Cena: I don;t know what to do with Him, I guess go to SmackDown! and chase the WHC.<br>  <br>  #5.) Jaime Noble: Go to ECW and feud with the new guys like Tyson Kidd and DJ Gabriel.<br>  <br>  #6.) Shawn and Taker: Hopefully have a good title reign in both of them and maybe retire in 2-5 years.<br>  <br>  BQ: For the WHC, I want to see Kennedy or SHelton Benjamin as Champ. For WWE, I want to see Randy Orton as Champ.|`|b7JS16dyaa	1. He can be moved to ECW to replace Christian as the top face and become/compete to be ECW champion, until he gets enough momentum back.

Returns and feuds with Randy, the latter should be WWE champion.<br>  <br>  4. Continues feud with Big Show and Vickie; can be drafted to Smackdown since he shows up there so much these last few weeks anyways.<br>  <br>  5. Work in ECW and help newer talent.

Return to smackdown, if they wont change him heel change his setting.<br>  5.) release most likely i can't see Noble putting up with being under valued much longer, I'd love to see Noble Vs Angle in TNA but that might just be me.<br>  6.) a move in the draft for one of them then continuing the feud through summer then onto other feuds with younger stars. Taker/ Dibiase and HBK/Evan Bourne<br>  <br>  BQ: Jamie Noble because i'd rather see someone young with great wrestling ability hold the title over showmen or the old guard. I'd like to see it on Taker or HBK but i'd rather see it on Noble first.|`|NZKramllaa	1.) Kennedy.... A Huge Push on the horizon for him (Again), Maybe he will be Involved in this Matt/Jeff Angle or Get Drafted to ECW.<br>  <br>  2.) Christian.... Drafted to RAW or SD and Competing for the Worldtitle.<br>  <br>  3.) Batista..... Drafted back to SD or Be involved in this Triple H/Orton Feud.<br>  <br>  4.) Cena... He will be Promoting his Movie and Be World Champ I suppose<br>  <br>  5.) Jamie....He will either go to ECW or be stuck Jobbing on RAW.<br>  <br>  6.) Undertaker drafted to RAW and HBK drafted to SD.<br>  <br>  BQ: Christian He has been with WWE for a while, Even though he went to TNA, He showed his loyalty to WWE and came back.

sDufaYGtaa	Well, Dwight is better than Yao and would dominate that matchup. Dwight is a better shot blocker and he is a more powerful player. Pau Gasol is better than Alridge at this point in his career and Pau has that great soft touch on his shot. Carmelo and Granger is a good matchup. Based on the 2009 Season, I would have to pick Granger because he has just dominated for the Pacers this season. Joe Johnson and Brandon Roy are a couple of very talented athletes who have a lot to look forward to in their careers. That one is a wash. Being a Lakers fan, I don't like either Rondo or Williams, but I would have to give the nod to Rondo because he has had a great season being the number 4 guy on his team while Williams is the 2nd option on his team.<br>  <br>  Team 1 > Team 2|`|khbLZQHIaa	Surface:<br>  Dwight > Yao<br>  Pau > Lamarcus<br>  Danny = Carmelo<br>  Brandon > Joe<br>  Mo = Rajon<br>  <br>  The first team would win just from looking at the surface.<br>  <br>  In Depth:<br>  The first team has much better rebounding and an inside precense but the second team has great overall shooting and can pass better too.<br>  Yao and Dwight would go at it.  Rebound.  Rebound.  Rebound.  It'd be intense.  Pau and Lamarcus would be lopsided.  Both can shoot but Pau is overall better inside and a better rebounder and player as a whole.<br>  Carmelo and Danny... wow... .it'd be fun to watch.  I see lots of scoring.  Lots of tricks and lots of skill here... wow....<br>  Joe and Brandon would be fun too.  Joe would probably stick to the outside a little more, wiating for passes from Rajon and such but Brandon would be all over the floor.<br>  Finally, Rajon and Mo... it'd be fun.  A lot of plays being run.  Mo creating a shot while Rajon finding the open man.<br>  Now, with all of that in mind, it still seems the first team is better.  <br>  <br>  This would be a good game and both would be good teams.  But 1st team would win and is better.|`|2507b3fe8a64131aa4da8a03105a59acaa	The one with dwight, pau, roy, granger and williams. with Dominant meaning powerful and bigger they are the more dominant team|`|746077409f66f6e802ce3a7b0b317492aa	I don't know.  It could go either way.  Team 1 has a better post/paint presence. Howard is way better than Yao and same for Gasol/Aldrige.  The other three spots have to go to Team 2.  Rondo is better than Mo defensively and almost offensively. Joe is more experienced and clutch than Roy and Carmelo is just a scoring machine.|`|p4szdxrCaa	dwight>yao<br>  pau>lamarcus<br>  carmelo>danny<br>  brandon>joe<br>  mo>rondo

amlmhoUuaa	Kistler has some good rods I would get something in a heavy action with a Quantum or Shimano reel. Diawa also makes some really good reels.|`|BK1GjPT6aa	Any budget huh? Sounds like you hit the lotto, Red. Can I be your best friend? LOL. <br>  Alright, getting serious here...I always liked the Hopper Rod system. It has the power of a deep sea fishing rod  but half the weight so it's fairly light. It was intended for deep jigging many larger species but is perfect for many styles of fishing including large catfish.They come in spinning and conventional and run from 99 bucks and up. You can find one at <a href="http://www.captharry.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.captharry.com</a> As far as reels go, I'm old school and would just say Penn...again.

VAHqrjtYaa	Bring you bike to your local bike shop. They are usually willing to answer questions. The guys at my bike shop have taught me a lot, nowadays I could completely rebuild my bike.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	spend your money on a bike that is already equipped  with the parts you want on a bike and do not put any  money into a bike that little to no info can be found on the internet about....There isnt alot of options out there for you with current components with this particular build anymore as the industry has taken leaps and bounds since 91'. Save your $ for a better bike, seriously!|`|fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	Edward is correct on this one. <br>  <br>  However, if you want to plunge forward you'll need to get the following from your bike. You should also figure which parts you want to replace since you'll have to replace some things in groups:<br>  <br>  1) Number of cogs on the back wheel and number of teeth on largest and smallest cog and whether it is a frewwheel (probable) or cassette. You should not try to change this;<br>  <br>  2) Number of chainrings on the crank. Again, something you should not try to change;<br>  <br>  3) Diameter of the handlebar in the center and steerer tube diameter... you'll need this for brake levers, stem, and new handlebars;<br>  <br>  4) The method of attachment of the derailleurs. Most front derailleurs are clamp-on but some are braze-on. Most rear derailleurs from that era have hangers on the derailleur rather than on the frame;<br>  <br>  5) Specing between the inside of the rear dropouts (where the wheel goes) and also between the front dropouts;<br>  <br>  6) Diameter of the seat post- this is usually stamped on the post somewhere, probably 27.0 or 27.2 would be my guess.<br>  <br>  ***Yeah, No. I just did a bit of research and your bike has a Suntour drivetrain. Nothing modern is compatible, so if you choose to upgrade parts it WILL cost you big money. I suggest that you have the bike professionally overhauled (around $200) or simply maintain it until you can afford a new bike.
GERlmBIUaa	I would compare the Baltimore Ravens and the SanAntonio Spurs together because they are both great defensive teams with good offense...best answer plz|`|dXblgZEzaa	Celtics- Steelers<br>  Lakers- Patriots(with Brady)<br>  Spurs- Ravens<br>  Thats all I can think of that have real similarities.|`|OWIiJMLqaa	I'd compare the old Detroit Pistons teams from the late 80's early 90's. They were about as rough and tough a team as I can remember.|`|iCzRC6LUaa	I compare the Cardinals with the Suns. They both have high powered offense, but not the best defense.|`|adM9rI7Faa	ive always thought that the the suns are the colts of the NBA cuz of their high scoring and offense type

b7JS16dyaa	My personal order:<br>  <br>  1. CM Punk, because he's been a heel many times before, and uses his Straight-Edge gimmick to proclaim that he's better than everyone. It worked, too.<br>  <br>  2. Kizarny, because I think he could be a twisted type of character that can make little kids cry with his creepy carnival stunts.<br>  <br>  3. Undertaker's character makes a good monster heel, but now really right now. He used to be a scary "Lord of Darkness" type guy like you see in movies. It worked good, but he's neutral right now, which is fine too.<br>  <br>  Everyone else just seems to lack certain qualities, like mic skills, size, charisma, etc.|`|1JywgkyMaa	i'd like to see evan bourne return from injury as a heel,have him say somethin like,"dont worry fans,the savior of ecw has returned" "i am here to save you from the hasbeens of yesteryear,like tommy dreamer",and that could start maybe an actually good feud with them|`|R4dXxh6paa	CM Punk- OOOOOH, maybe!<br>  Rey Mysterio- eh, too tiny<br>  Kofi Kingston- no, he's too happy and smiley<br>  Festus- ummmmm, maybe!<br>  Jeff Hardy- Already done it<br>  Kizarny- WTF! We've barely seen him<br>  R-Truth- OOOOOOOh, maybe<br>  Undertaker- Already dun it<br>  Evan- Maybe?|`|VkFDAQ46aa	I would like to see CM Punk as a heel. cant really picture him as a heel though. i think it would be interesting. hes supposed to be a hard working guy. i would like to see how the WWE would turn him heel if he actually did it.|`|a45ffb40e1ff08eda37fb35f65c6eecaaa	kizarny or undertaker. maybe punk. hardy wouldn't i dont even believe matt hardy as a heel.|`|PniPsDmGaa	CM Punk seems like the nly person to be a heel!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Jeff Hardy could be a heel, but it doesnt seem like they would do a heel turn for Jeff.|`|WyPOnZdSaa	Undertaker, Hes ALways Been The Best Heel.|`|AA10576425	If it has to be from the list, then there is no doubt.. It will be Undertaker.. I think Cena would do a good heel..|`|JiCfYfLraa	undertaker because he is just better off as a heel. undertaker to me is a better heel then a face because he is just so dominate and his mic skills is just so heel like.|`|OHBvEYKHaa	Undertaker|`|t1uKdzmLaa	I have to say Taker because he was awesome as a heel during his Big Evil/ABA gimmick. That man was a butt kicking machine and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. :D<br>  <br>  Also, I would like to see Kofi as a heel as well. He should adopt some sort of Jamaican badman gimmick. That would be funny to see. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good question you asked.|`|bRGdkOwqaa	i dont know but i would love to see mysterio has a heel i would like to see what he would have to do for people to hate him|`|qt7QcmtPaa	CM Punk-Heel (He has been face since he came into wwe)<br>  Mysterio-Face<br>  Kingston-Face<br>  Festis-Face<br>  Hardy-Face<br>  Kizarny-Face<br>  Taker-Face<br>  Evan-Face|`|95uXmC94aa	Undertaker, I mean come on.

Face paint makes them look all dirty.<br>  My favorite masked wrestler was  Kane.|`|rytSFBbgaa	Face Paint Sting|`|cRqwANvlaa	When done right and they look cool, I like both of them equally. Like for example, Jeff Hardy's face paint is AWESOME, and there are tons of Lucha Libre stars from the past and present with cool masks, as well as puroresu stars.<br>  <br>  Favorite face paint wrestler- Jeff Hardy<br>  <br>  Favorite masked wrestler- Rey Mysterio. His masks are awesome, especially the one that is half white and half red with a little black.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	I'd prefer them with neither, but my favorite out of the two are masks.

b7JS16dyaa	He's probably had some traumatic incident due to wrestling, otherwise, he wouldn't hate it so much.

0Ub8hoN6aa	if you mean you want to go through him than lower your center of gravity(bend your knees, NOT YOUR BACK OR YOU'LL GET HURT) AND put a shoulder into him, get lower than he is and put your shoulder right through his chest and you'll bulldoze right over him, make sure you keep your head up though so you don't get a concussion.  <br>  <br>  if you are trying to get around him without much contact than use your feet/hips to create space, against not very good people just do a studder step left or right then cut the other direction, but if you do this other people can catch you besides him, so assuming he's good since your asking for help i would say catch the ball turn around and when going around him cut left or right and stiff arm|`|KfFb9vowaa	you can run through a big guy by lowering your shoulder pads and nail him right in the gut and keep your feet moving forward. it would also help if you started to do leg workouts like squats and dead-lifts this will give you more power when you run|`|PJFeRy0Zaa	Spin Move, fake him out while you're still running you're route, then you're home free.|`|RQAXysWVaa	if ur fast juke him out since he has the size advantage u can't run over him so juke him out or just run by him if all else fails slap him in the face|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	ok if yr faster run away from him? <br>  like catch it and run <br>  or put yr shoulder down and run through him

3MTsp25faa	In my opinion do not trade away Johan or Manny.<br>  Why?<br>  Because Manny is probably going to have another great year in LA even though it took him forever to sign with them again. He seems to like it there and he plays better in the warm weather there. Plus the fans love him wearing that #99 Dodger uniform.<br>  You keep Johan because he is averaging over 200 K's a year when A.J. just had his first 200 K season last year.

I doubt Randy Orton really has it though, I think it's just an angle to fit with the Orton-Mcmahon storyline.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	Intermittent explosive disorder is a real behavioral disorder. Randy Orton doesn't really have it though (as far as I know)|`|l0GWmWl4aa	yeah its real but Orton's character doesn't use it in the right way.

Even though, IED is a real disease Orton doesn't have it. It's just part of a storyline even though it is really a disease.|`|oY4Asqdpaa	IED is a real disease from steroid abuse (probably what benoit had) only randy doesnt have this in real life, it's just storylines! he wouldnt be alowed to wreslte if he had it for real!!!|`|6f33c4c6889b02b9ecebf8d32d30193eaa	OF course it is real why would the WWE make up a story line.

He is so good that opposing fans hate him. Also, lots of people think he's a bad teammate.|`|GERlmBIUaa	Prob more kobe fans since the most fans in the league are lakers fans and cuz the allstar with more haters than fans is paul pierce...lol...best answer plz|`|yrBa2BNvaa	fans. how could you hate kobe? just cuz hes the best|`|5MlBOuCuaa	K.B. Haters|`|I41TuITRaa	kobe just the best and thats y people hate cuz when they were bad he had to do everything by himself and people call him a ball hog for doing wat he can with those really bad laker teams

Vw0ry8Ylaa	I've never cared for those deals where you get a bunch of stuff that you're not sure you'll use, even if you do save a few bucks. Those kits are aimed at inexperienced anglers, and they hook WAY more people than fish. If you know you'll use everything in that kit, then sure, it's a good deal. But I think the most useful thing there is the box and maybe the hooks, and I'll bet you could go to the local sporting goods store and get something similar for $10.<br>  <br>  Will that stuff catch trout? Maybe. It's all jigging tackle, which is not ideal for trout fishing, but I don't know how much of that stuff I'd use even for fishing crappie. Why's everything so bright and yellow!? You might catch some trout with that kit, but I would not buy it specifically to catch trout.<br>  <br>  Also, you're getting dozens of pieces that will all act basically the same. There are a few different colors, but they're all the same size. Do you fish so much that you're going to go through that many rubber lures? Do you know enough about the fish you're after to know when the bright yellow skirts will work and the bright pink one won't? Is that kit really suited to your fish or waters?<br>  <br>  Here's the point: a very small kit with a few lures you use often and catch fish on is better than a "455-Piece Crappie Kit" filled with stuff you may never use.<br>  <br>  A note about the salmon eggs -- yeah, that's about the going rate for those, but I wouldn't buy any right now. It's the wrong time of year for trout to be eating eggs. Brown trout, lakers, and brookies spawn in the late fall and early winter. Rainbow and cutthroat spawn in the late winter. You might hook a trout using eggs right now, but you'd be better off imitating the small fry that are hatching from the eggs spawned earlier in the winter. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you're just starting out in fishing, or you're new to your area, or you're new to trout fishing. That's so great -- you've got all this discovery and research ahead of you, and every fish you catch is going to be a huge thrill. I envy you. Here's what you do: get some info from local people about what they fish with, where they fish, and when they fish. Ask the guy at the sporting good store, or even the customers. Consult your state Fish and Game wildlife website and your state fishing proclamation. Come back here and ask some specific questions about the area you're going to fish. Info is as valuable or more so that jigs and lures and bait. <br>  <br>  Take the twenty bucks you were going to spend on that crappie kit and buy a few of the lures that locals recommend to you. If you're a little short on cash, you can get worms right out of the ground for free -- just run your sprinkler a few hours before sundown. All you need then is a flashlight and quick reflexes. Grab a dozen or so and go fish. Trout will always take worms, and fishing with worms in a tin can is so old school! Beg more info off the people you see fishing. Most of them will be happy to share what they know, especially the older folks. Some will even tell you a lot more than they know! Heh heh. Ask not just about lures and bait, but find out about rigging and tackle (sinkers, floats, etc.). Use the info you gather to get a little more tackle, and every time you go out you'll learn more and catch more fish. Soon you'll really get to know the local waters and fish, and you'll have a tackle box filled with only tackle you know and use -- no silly bright yellow frogs or hot pink squids.<br>  <br>  I don't bait fish any more and again I don't know where you are, so I can't recommend any other baits. I mostly fly fish now and I think it's the most challenging and the most rewarding way of fishing, especially for trout. I don't know what your situation is, but if you can manage it, I would give fly fishing and catch-and-release a try.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you. Catch one for me!|`|KJWxqQHiaa	The first one is labeled as a crappie kit, but i believe that you will catch trout will those. <br>  <br>  The second one, those salmon eggs, will work definitely. <br>  <br>  The cost totals up to be (lemme do my math ... ) about $27. I know a lot better lures for trout, that will cost the same.<br>  <br>  But, if i must say, get some Panther Martin's, and Mepps Aglia. No, i have not used either of them, as i am not the most serious trout angler but, ask anyone on here about what in-line spinner they like. I posted a Q about it too. If you would like to see the responses go ahead and check them out.<br>  <br>  Berkley power-bait trout dough, is another bait that is commonly mentioned on YA! by fisherman.<br>  <br>  For me, i like the ole' rooster tail for trout fishing.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out.|`|CBTAgeu4aa	This is what i like for trout.<br>  <a href="http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_10151_-1_10001_46230_100006002_100000000_100006000_100-6-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores...</a>

WUc9TbHCaa	No, not really.<br>  Wear technical fabrics with wicking that will keep you cool. They will pull moisture away from you.|`|6mMasEsNaa	Your weight seems to be good for your height.

ZKikquiOaa	I don't blame you, when I can't shoot for a while, I get cranky too.  But sometimes a break can be good for you.  Now as for tournaments, the only way to get good at shooting tournaments is to shoot tournaments.  No way around it.  When there's no tournaments around, gather a few of your fellow archers and shoot for score.  Get used to shooting under pressure.<br>  <br>  Concentrate on the form and execution while you shoot, don't think about hitting the target.  Don't worry about placement, I know its hard, but think about the now and the journey, not the goal.  Take your time between shots to gather yourself and clean your mind, take a deep breath.  Then once you're in your shot cycle, stick to your rythm, make confident shots.|`|ShysuF4kaa	Best thing I can say is just get shooting again. Don't get frustrated if you can't shoot as many arrows the first couple of times, you just have to get your body used to it again. If your tournament is at the end of the month, I'd suggest only shooting 30 meters since you need all the repetition you can get. <br>  Good luck at your tournament :)
x9GODf8eaa	Flexibility (or stiffness) does not depend on brand, but on price. Higher end skates are stiffer, and lower end skates are softer (more flexible).

bf3bc2c3811507a54ef69dd9118ca5a3aa	I started practicing Wing Chun when I was 15, I'm 48 now.<br>  <br>  Wing Chun has never failed me over those years (not that I've had that many serious altercations). But, I do highly recommend it as a self defense.|`|apr9gsgjaa	wing chun is like a gun if you really need to use it all it takes is one blast and their outta there. Its good for self defense because it ends fights before they really become fights. Its not like ju jit su or boxing where you really have to put in alotta effort into fighting once you know how to use it right. However Id say to be able to use it in fights takes longer and training will be much longer than say boxing or ju jitsu but in the long run you cant loose with Wing Chun kuen|`|hQWucH5uaa	Wing Chun is a good 'in-fighting' style for close quarters combat and in-your-face situations, such crowded bars, crowded rooms, or in any crowded situation.<br>  <br>  Wing Chun is weak on kicks, I believe it has only two low kicks.  But it is very upper body and hands oriented.<br>  <br>  I personally like Wing Chun because most of the fights I have gotten into have been up close and personal.|`|BLWxEdrMaa	Wing Chun stresses all the most important aspects of self defense in my opinion.  First of all, it teaches a very strong structure, modeling all of its stances and positioning after the most efficient shape known to mankind: the triangle.  <br>  <br>  It trains with effective techniques:<br>  <br>  * Forms - the forms are very compact, including all hands, blocks, strikes, and movements necessary to remind onesself of - and that is the only practical use for forms anyway - to remind us of what we train.<br>  <br>  * Drills - the 2-man drills create fluid motion and accurate timing, along with allowing students to practice the 'eye of eagle and heart of stone' skill, in which focus for all movement is toward the center of the opponent's body, the application for the 'centerline principle'.<br>  <br>  * Wing Chun Dummy - the arms and leg are purposefully a bit loose in their holes, to promote vibration when they are struck.  If the correct types of wood are used (certain hardwoods, with a type of cherry being one of the favorites), the vibrations are at a frequency which stimulates the electromagnetic fields around the bones, causing them to grow thicker and stronger.  It also serves to desensitize and toughen the skin in the areas striking, which creates a stronger fighter.<br>  <br>  Arms are used primarily, which is good, because they are faster and less telegraphic than leg movements.  However, arms and legs are trained for simoultaneous use, so if an opponent begins a leg battle, the Wing Chun practitioner is equally capable of meeting the leg challenge.  High kicks are both dangerous and slow, and should be avoided unless you're just trying to look impressive in a forms competition, and Wing Chun is down-to-earth enough to train in a practical way in the first place, using hands for upper area strikes and blocks, and feet for lower area movement, strikes, and blocks.<br>  <br>  There are many other excellent reasons to train Wing Chun, including the fact that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, and that is the secret to the incredible hand speed we build when we learn this awesome and well-developed system of in-fighting.<br>  <br>  Most self-defense situations require in-fighting, as they occur up-close and personal when they do happen.  If you don't train Wing Chun then please at least find a good in-fighting system you find best for you.<br>  <br>  GrandMaster David Moore<br>  Co-Founder of Ming Wei Dao<br>  Instructor of Wing Chun Basics|`|uBrTu7OBaa	David informed you pretty well, but I'll also put in my two cents. Wing Chun is a very good fighting system but if you're looking for a school, be sure to find an instructor you can trust, train, and bond with from beginning to end. The teacher teaching wing chun to you is extremely important.|`|6nGII584aa	yes its a great self defence martial art.|`|rEhCPxcMaa	Absolutely. Wing Chun is not a martial sport and is based purely on self defence techniques. For pure self defense wing chun would be hard to beat.
BPDvvryraa	Go to your local golf pro or golf store.  They are usually great at customizing shafts and lie angles.  There is a huge difference between custom fitted and out of the box irons.  I am partial to irons that are forged blades and pro-step clubs.  I think I've hit all the major brand irons so I would rank mine like this:<br>  <br>  1.  Hogan 99 Apex (pre-callaway days)<br>  2.  Hogan FTX (pre-callaway)<br>  3.  Nike Pro Combo<br>  4.  Mizuno MP-37<br>  5.  Nike CCI (forged)|`|zYFMhrkKaa	How about callaway x-22 tour iron set and TM tour preferred iron set? You can have a try.|`|q2sjM7Iaaa	Look at Taylormade. Good clubs. Decent prices. I would look into the R7 model.

NmXKPDoIaa	Yes, it will be in the rafters next to Alonzo Mourning #33..Pat Riley should get his Sports coat retired, aswell...<br>  <br>  -Heat have a short history, Wade has done alot for them.

He has HOF numbers, and already won a ring, but he still has some playing to do.|`|a112fa2d0ccf1099eec1119d4da5e902aa	Yes, for sure! He gave them a championship and was Finals MVP at that.|`|F05yVezraa	It depends how long he stays with the Heat|`|dfTMaV58aa	Dude... yes|`|qtwYHyH5aa	No they won't retire Shaqs jersey, I thin the Lakers are the ones that are going to retire Shaqs jersey.<br>  <br>  Yes, the Heat will retire Wade's jersey, and he'll be in the hall of fame for sure. he's amazing.|`|QtPdrKfuaa	As long as Wade stays with the Heat they'll definitely retire his number.  He deserves it|`|wTVZYQwlaa	they will retire d-wade jersey for sure.<br>  but not shaq L.A. will retire his number #32.|`|6yoQhXsOaa	Yea!|`|2YhigCnXaa	yea he won them there first title cant think of anyone who did more for the team|`|p4szdxrCaa	well duhhhhh. yes|`|VHphDgrhaa	yea he has been a good player with them and if he stays with them for like 5 more years that is a definate.|`|SaeUxO6Gaa	Of course.  Look at whose numbers the heat have retired so far:<br>  1) Dan Marino (not a basketball player)<br>  2) Michael Jordan (didn't play in Miami)<br>  3) Alonzo Mouring (not that great)<br>  <br>  Doesn't exactly compare with what's hanging in the Boston Garden and the Staples Center.  Wade's done more for the heat than anyone - unfortunately that doesn't say much either.
jXCHQOU3aa	i got Achilles tendinitis last year in track and had to sit out the whole season and it sucked  bc my foot would hurt while walking and i couldn't play basketball or do pretty muchly anything. then i tried coming back in the middle of the season when it got better but on my first day back i re injured it. then next school year i went to cross country and got it in my other leg. i was so pressured into running and not sitting out by everyone and my self that i just kept running. i thought oh it might just stay this way and not get worse. and i had to walk back from school everyday through tremendous pain in my foot. then it got to a point where i couldn't run anymore bc the pain was too much and i quit. and felt like i was letting everyone down. then it went away and i thought everything was fine. probably because i didn't do anything to aggravate it that much. but when i tried out for the basketball team it happened again during the first day of tryouts when we had to run for 45 minutes around the gym in basketball shoes, which are not running shoes by the way, carrying a 15 pound ball. it hurt a little after this but i decided not to come back the next to tryouts since i know what happens when i push something like that too far. now its track season and i cant be on the team because i still have the problem slightly and i am afraid of a repeat. my Achilles tendon is so flexible to the point where i cant stretch it anymore and feel a stretch so stretching wont solve the problem, and ive been doing calf raises for half a year now so it cant be a strength issue and i don't even know what to do now bc the Doctor wasn't much help. the worst part about it isn't the physical pain but the pain in knowing i cant play basketball and i cant do track, and i cant do what i want to do. it been really holding me back|`|oZIWhhoNaa	Well, i once injured by little pinky, and it hurt a lot! I got some cake and a kiss. =)|`|amg1MG9Vaa	i know something like that. i knew a girl this year who only went to my school for sports but that summer she broke her back and cant play sports for the rest of her life. she wasnt bitter about it and i cant say anything good came out of it because i didnt like her too much but it wasnt that bad.|`|bjh9qajRaa	Mine didn't really hurt that much it was just funny. I play goalie in lax and the ball was pelted at me and I have a bunch of bruses where you can clearly read the emblem on them
nmLt7jR4aa	Don't let your height or when you start discourage you.  If you plan on cheering in high school, start right away.  Just make sure that you stay in it and you're committed.|`|j0CGEnMHaa	height doesnt  matter
kecdkv6jaa	You think Australian males in their 20's and 30's will give up drinking alcohol all together.<br>  Good luck with that!|`|f9hiPMDxaa	No you can't do that. How much is it going to cost clubs and the NRL to check every player at their home that they are not drinking. <br>  <br>  One sugestion mooted and it is a good one is that players not drink when attending official club or NRL functions. It is only a silly few who do cause all the problems.|`|x38gqcQ7aa	I think this is just taking things too far......  Yes some individuals may benefit from such a clause, but as a blanket ban, its taking things too far.<br>  <br>  Most footy players of all grades love to have a drink after the game, its all part of the male bonding thing.  And yes it usually goes way too far.  But as these first grade players are such high profile and role models for so many kids<br>  <br>  If a player seems to have a problem with drinking and gets in trouble all this time, take action and sack him.  But to take away his right to having a drink is just wrong.  I think that the sport has gone a bit soft over the years, and to Ban players from drinking would be yet another nail in the NRL coffin.<br>  <br>  The NRL is right on Manly's back about players drinking excessively and I think you will see the NRL stepping in and taking action against clubs.  In this case, the clubs may start to take more action against players.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Take action YES, Ban NO<br>  <br>  P.S Some of my best child hood memories are having a few drinks with the boys in the team after a win.|`|uKoAMJQvaa	If you want to ban players from drinking than games/teams/events should not be sponsored by alcohol companies/brands. Let it be like cigarettes full ban. You don't see players lighting up now in public. Maybe if sponsorship by alcohol was banned than players maybe wouldn't drink in public.<br>  I think alcohol has feature so heavily in our culture it would take a lot to change it around.|`|Uyz6iZwKaa	Because it would be too much of a restriction on players. Why punish players that can have a social drink and be responsible. It would be too resticting on players and too hard to control. That is why only certain players (like Todd Carney of Canberra) have bans on alcohol consumption because they abuse it - and when they do they are sacked! They are men not babies.|`|aN4SUKkRaa	The club that did so would be seen as hypocrits if they take any monies from the NRL because alcohol companies are sponsors.<br>  <br>  They would be hypocrits if they allow alcohol to be served to spectators. <br>  <br>  If they won the premiership, what would they drink to celebrate? Lime cordial?

Once two of Kallis, de Villiers or Duminy are gone, the rest will follow quickly.<br>  <br>  My hunch is that these 3 will be able to take it into the after lunch session, and the game will end either just before or just after tea. If I'm wrong, it's most likely that the wickets fall faster than that.|`|i8QoeiNyaa	That's not gonna happen bro|`|qtwYHyH5aa	idk|`|UK6A4Pzpaa	I think it will be after tea.<br>  <br>  Does anybody know the weather conditions for Durban Day 5?<br>  <br>  Because if it is sunny like yesterday, then SA might get a draw.|`|iDmjwU26aa	After lunch....

He fails on quite a number of occasions but without Gibbs SA cannot perform mind-boggling cricket feats - which is what a victory in this match would constitute and require. Gibbs may be a South African but he has the flair and X-factor of a South Asian or West Indian. So no Gibbs, no victory! Therefore SA have to play for a draw in the 2nd Test. If they get it, the series will be still 1-0 in Australia's favour. Therefore SA will HAVE to play for a victory in the 3rd Test else they will lose the series.|`|qaCWirYdaa	The second test is not over yet!

ETurhACOaa	Rampage won by a unanimous decesion at the end of the 3rd round after an uneventful fight.

b7JS16dyaa	I think the only thing affecting his heel character are his mic skills, but that happens whether he's face or not. It's the way he talks; Matt has a slight lisp sometimes. I personally think that the way he talks about being jealous of Jeff is pretty good, because he's probably thought about it at least once in his career, whether he wanted to or not.<br>  <br>  I'm still a huge Black Cloud fan whether he's face or heel.|`|hL3eS2zKaa	Neither do I because theres a possibility that this could be a real life feud as well, like Matt hating Jeff in real life.<br>  But I think that this is also a good thing, Matt's been getting the time in the spotlight that he deserves.|`|WyPOnZdSaa	He Was A Pretty Cool Heel When He Was "Matt Hardy Verison 1"<br>  But A Bit Werid At The Same Time.|`|kZPFCPHVaa	I don't like it either. Matt Hardy is not a good heel. He should be face instead.
yererDcnaa	id say look on the website for a phone number and give them a call<br>  <br>  i know its possible to do because ive seen the custom hats around. but personally i dont know the actual process of how to make it happen|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Not totally sure, but I would check out New Era's website and see if there's anything there about it, since the company that makes the 59/50 hats.
hCLmczgMaa	The probably wont sign a free agent, but they will be likely to draft. Parcells is great at finding talents and there are always talents at the WR positions out of college. it is always WRs and RBs... it only comes down to picking the right guy.|`|UgnMjtYDaa	They won't use a first or a second and probably not a third but they'll draft a receiver like they did davone bess. I actually think they are comfortable with the present receivers. I like Ginn, Camarillo, and Bess. They just are all so small but with our tight ends and running game and an improved O-Line they should do well this year. We need a cornerback, a DT, and a LB/DE.|`|mkueXAKoaa	Tedd Ginn was showing that he was worth the first round pick a little bit last year, and Marvin Harrison is still out there but i think they should use a 2nd or 3rd round pick on a WR.|`|XSnj1sxAaa	Really need a wide receiver*<br>  <br>  Look for hope in the draft. I'd say around rounds 1-2, maybe as late as the 3rd.|`|PJFeRy0Zaa	Will pull one out of the draft because they also need money for some other positions|`|94Ti4bHtaa	Marvin Harrison is still out there, but he wants too much money. They should pick someone up in the draft.|`|AA11336968	I don't think that they should waste a high pick on a receiver.  There are few wrs that come in the NFL and do good their first year. Chad P.  is a great qb  but realistic he has no arm to get the ball down Field. I think they address the needs on defense in the first two rounds and get a receiver in the third round.  Omit everything I said if hakeem nicks is available|`|ta02u844aa	They have Tedd Ginn Jr, but he's more of a speed reciever and a kick/punt returner. Maybe they will pick up somebody like Michael Crabtree, Derrius Heyward-Bey, or Jeremy Maclin in the draft. They all have potential to be good in the NFL.|`|8as63GSKaa	I dont think anyone in free agency is a good fit for them, so they may look in the second or thrid round of the draft and try to pick up someone|`|YKhulh5Haa	The Dolphins are WIDE RECIEVERS<br>  GO BILLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Squish the fish|`|RQAXysWVaa	idk ted gin is good
USC2my54aa	If there is no price limit, get the Triton.|`|OlwAjqWsaa	Absolutely the stealth.|`|AHQX3EYHaa	you should get a exo. <br>  baseball-mechanics.devhub.com<br>  it has great deals|`|I683b5E8aa	the new stealth...
b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	Depending upon how big a 12 year old we are talking about as that can make a difference, but an average 12 year old would be good on a crf150r or any of the known brand 2 stroke 85cc bikes if racing.  <br>  <br>  If not racing then you could look at something like a ttr125cc, klx125cc or crf150f, but again that would depend upon how large a 12 year old we are talking about.|`|6E6VxOoeaa	suzuki 85cc any year<br>   honda 100cc any year<br>  super pimped out 65cc<br>  suzuki was my first 85 and i loved it...good for beginners...but easy to ride fast later.|`|rqVwksGzaa	i would stick with a Honda- i am very happy with mine<br>  the parts are in stock in more places around the US so that helps <br>  depemds on how tall he/she is but... i would recommend this little number. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sloansmotorcycle.com/new_vehicle_detail.asp?sid=09069178X3K9K2009J7I23I28JPMQ785R0&veh=87072&CatDesc=Motorcycles&ModelYear=2009" rel="nofollow">http://www.sloansmotorcycle.com/new_vehi...</a><br>  <br>  i'm 5' but my nephew is 6'1 and he rides it perfectly fine so it'll suit most any height|`|u3Fy54ewaa	it depends on the size but i would say and 85cc 2stroke or a honda crf150r

AA11357056	I wouldn't mind if college football had a playoff system... but I think there'd be the same arguments over who got into the playoff as there are now about who gets into the BCS games.|`|7RziqsDcaa	I love the BCS. I'm not even kidding. If there was a playoff system, 117 teams would get screwed over (just like college basketball).<br>  <br>  Do you even know how excited fans get when their team makes it to a bowl game (probably not Texas or USC lol).|`|bIbyAkHPaa	People who want a playoff haven't thought things out. It would cause more problems than it cures.|`|4tV29gIpaa	hell yeah we need a playoff only thing that makes sense
f8YyItbjaa	Take a few pratice swings and when you get up to the tee concentrate. Wiggle a few times and take a slow and easy swing like when you pratice and acclerate threw the ball but not too much. Hope it helps!|`|GtLPp5dgaa	just go back to what you did best what ever works its all right doesnt matter how it looks i have an ugly swing but it does the job|`|uOAFLBpXaa	slower backswing and cock wrists at top of backswing. loosen hands and watch it fly|`|z58NVkOnaa	What are you thinking of at the time you pull the trigger?...if you are forming words at this point, then you are not allowing your swing to do its thing.<br>  <br>  You have too much mind...too many things going on in your head perhaps.<br>  <br>  Or you just getting older.|`|EgiCy9mdaa	Don't use your driver, and if your able to hit every other club well then you should still be able to score well.
21SgKITCaa	Heck yes they will.  Even if they do not win in Vegas they will. <br>  Out of the Mountain West these teams will make it<br>  BYU<br>  Utah<br>  Las Vegas will win the tounament Home court<br>  And possibly New Mexico<br>  Go Cougars<br>  BYU|`|GpqzuhpCaa	I am U of U all the way so i think that BYU totally SUCKS!!!!!!!!|`|rXGiN15Vaa	No they are not on the bubble. ESPN and Yahoo, among others, have BYU as a lock. They'll make the big dance. How far will they go? That's a question for another post!|`|0EHoaujuaa	Their no longer a bubble team they are guaranteedan At-Large bid along with Utah in the MWC.|`|166c6f22dd3296f7b76f56d6a0c35c12aa	Yeah I don't really know but I am a fan of the Cougars! I don't have time to follow like I would like.
8jViRw5qaa	I would agree, but its really hard to make predictions for that not only because it is after WM. It's also after the WWE Draft. <br>  <br>  <br>  BTW huge spoiler is that Mysterio is going back to SD for the draft and HHH is going to Raw. He went to Raw just to help SD with their transition to MyNetwork TV, that's why he was champion for so long.|`|f3AdydqAaa	Your Matches suck. It will be Orton vs. Triple H and Cena vs. Edge and Rey won't go to ECW he's going to Smackdown. Jericho is staying on Raw and Christian is going to Smackdown|`|qtwYHyH5aa	Why do yall wrestling fans stick so much with the WWE, knowing that everything for the next year is written down!!!|`|OHBvEYKHaa	ok pretty good but why would Beth tag with melina and Undertaker would beat Y2J|`|oaz1hc2Daa	Well if the matches will happen i would you say your right but I can't see Jericho on smackdown|`|aQtP1t3Naa	wrestling is not cool|`|IfzmWSevaa	UUUGGHHHH i think this is awesome !!!! this would rock and if this really happened i know wwe would get more viewers !!!!!<br>  GREAT !!!
Gm1xk05Baa	you have an amazing team for a 15 man league.8/10. i think you could use a few moree better bats in your lineup but your pitching is outstanding. no, dont do the trade. your bullpen will be set with jenks and nathan. trade one of your pitchers for a bigger at bat in your lineup. you look set in the outfield and your middle infield is good but if you just get some one to replace lowrie or loney youll be set. in a 15 man league there are goin to be some teams that are desperate for pitching so maybe you could trade Cook or Danks for somone. Good Luck (Ah hell. you may not need luck with your team)|`|S7aUoHAkaa	good team especially for a deep league, and i like that you have Byrnes, he could come out of nowhere like 2 years ago and steal 50 bases, also im not sure about the volquez/ marmol deal, it might be useful to ask for a better closer, considering the season volquez had last year, overall your team looks pretty solid, and good luck along the way
4xN3ZIhYaa	whatever, i know your young, but all those kids are posers.<br>  i know you think it means the world now but trust me in 10 years you wont remember what their names are.<br>  dress how u want not how they are<br>  do what u love not what other kids are doing<br>  if kids hassle you for what your doing, fu@k them.<br>  don't ever stop being u because of what other people say|`|90CPrvV3aa	no dude...tell everyone to F off|`|rsAqrbsgaa	It doesn't matter what brand your clothes aer or whatever, it's how you act around them and how you carry yourself.<br>  <br>  It's probably your personality that changed that makes them call you a poser. <br>  <br>  From what I read, you do seem like a poser.|`|4JqwBJTSaa	No , as long as you actually skate you are a "skater".<br>  And , just keep practicing and then they won't have anything to make fun of you for.|`|RFOHlBFSaa	who cares what they say..just keep skating and have fun|`|zze8XmjLaa	get something patriotic, too.|`|su37vnIXaa	yeah. you are.|`|lUaJqJZhaa	No, just because you just recently started now doesn't mean anything.  Obviously you won't be really good if you've just started.  It doesn't seem like your that bad for somebody who just started.  The shoes and shirt don't really matter because I have some of that stuff and don't skate at all, you actually do skate and have them so it's fine.  Don't listen to people who just say your a poser.|`|HrdGdiE0aa	Uhh, people shouldn't be judging you <br>  by what you were on the outside.<br>  Personally i think as long as your<br>  not bragging about it, or not just<br>  doing it because your friend<br>  then you're not a poser in my book.<br>  They need to stop labeling people though.<br>  Drama Drama.|`|kuFAx4ymaa	if you care if you're a poser or not, you are a poser...<br>  <br>  Real cool kids dont care if they're cool or not.  Nor do they care if people think they are a poser or not...<br>  <br>  Do what you like, and you'll be fine.|`|pMnMgt4Vaa	Poser's don't exist. <br>  People are just retarded. <br>  You are you, and you will get better at it.|`|LiV3cu2eaa	No. Your just being yourself.

Did you start skateboarding just to be part of the skater crowd or show off just to be excepted buy them? If not then you can't be a poser because that would be the definition of a poser. If you're doing what you think is just fun because the whole purpose of it being fun or wear what you think looks good then you're fine. Just don't do it for others.<br>  <br>  If they call you that it's because they are stereotyping. They're probably reflecting there problems on to you to attract less attention to themselves and need some time to grow up and stop worrying about what other think of them.<br>  <br>  (sorry if that didn't make sense or I have a lot of typos. I'm tired and sick and isn't thinking straight.)|`|UizP52ULaa	**** that dude. theyre calling you a poser because you happen to start skating around this time of the century, where its popular. if you like doing it then just do it.<br>  <br>  but what that other dude said, if you worry about being a poser, your probly a poser. if your doing it to have fun, then thats sweet. if you go out and buy shirts with brands youve never heard of or dont know anything about because its what skateboarders wear, your fuckin gay. hahah. if you wanna skateboard, then your not a poser for trying to skateboard, dude. <br>  <br>  so basicly, if you dont wanna skate be be little **** up and follow the popular thing and just wanna skate, your fine dude. dont worry about people calling you a poser. as long as your favorite skater isnt rob dyrdek. he USED to be good. im talking '96. now everyone who's heard of him is a skater. just dont be that guy and your solid, bro|`|wg4XdI5taa	Well if you're doing it because you like skateboarding then who cares what others think. I first started skating when i was 14 and people said i sucked too. but once i was 16 every one looked up to me when they first started skate boarding and a lot of people my age as well thought i skateboard really good now. even tho i picked on kids and always made sure i was better than them at games like S.K.A.T.E. i still liked to skate with them cause now they see me as a big influence even when i feel like i'm not that big and still learning.<br>  <br>  All i have to say is if you stick with it and don't quite because of others i promise you that you will become good and people will see you as a true skater. You just need to keep practicing. Keep it up dude.
iCzRC6LUaa	I don't think they use professional athletes|`|RQAXysWVaa	idk

4wH3Hvcxaa	Guys mainly think athletic girls are not into men  !i|`|KJWd7q1Saa	NO...|`|0L5wlQlJaa	Nah not rly|`|PCM5fhnuaa	i'm not a guy...but, i saw a survey about that and a large percentage of teen guys asked said that they do feel, not intimidated, but definitely challenged. they feel like they should be better than girls at athletics and sports...bigger, faster, stronger..etc. they feel challenged and they hate losing to girls..lol. <br>  <br>  but if that's why a guy doesn't date you, then i think you're way better off without him! he is too ashamed to "lose" to you, have you be faster than him or better than him at the sport he's known for or something. that's pretty much sexist against girls (even i hate it when guys go "i just lost to a girl...how embarassing." --it's so rude...lol). you'd need a guy who is proud to be your bf, even if you did beat him at almost every race or whatever. :) just don't brag about you beating him or being better than him. that would be a turn off for anyone... :) i'm athletic too, and my guy friends are ok with it. we run and practice together, and play frisbee, lol. we always cheer each other on. it's lots of fun! :) <br>  <br>  now...if you're a super bodybuilder who is 100% muscle and whose biceps are twice as big as his head...i'd think he'd feel a little intimidated! haha, good luck though! and keep up that athleticism, don't let a bunch of sexist guys bring ya down!  :D|`|1e6KVeBDaa	It doesnt intimidate me, but a lot of guys arent into girls that are extremely atheltic and crazy in sports, Im not at least.

He's got what it takes though to "easily" make the Hall of Fame someday.|`|NmXKPDoIaa	I don't think he is even close at this point.<br>  <br>  People say that JJ is underrated, but I don't agree with that statement.<br>  <br>  Playing for the Hawks even lowers his chances.<br>  <br>  -Dominique didn't even make the 50 greatest players All-Time, which is a Joke. The guy is 13th All-Time is PPG, and 10th All-time in Total Points. to this day.<br>  <br>  -Ive watched both players thoughout their career. And trust me Joe Johnson isn't near as good as Dominique was.|`|bxnMQQMJaa	short answer....no<br>  <br>  long answer..........maybe<br>  <br>  The only way Joe goes into the Hall of Fame is if the Hawks win championships. Several championships. Not enough people even know who he is. I would love to see Joe in the HOF, but unless he leads the Hawks to the title, is not going to happen|`|PA0gmwd5aa	The Hawks are gonna have to win some significant games before that happens.I think he's got a shot,but they need to play with urgency and more heart.|`|SaeUxO6Gaa	It's rather optimistic to think that the Atlanta Hawks can win a ring or two lead by Joe Johnson.  I think he needs to lead his team out of the first round of the playoffs before that question can be taken seriously.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, he's a good player and by all accounts a really good guy.  Very good.  But not great.|`|i0Igqvroaa	maybe.
FY17j1Ajaa	Such as? They did make some aquisitions, but there were no big marquis name out there ( such as Hossa last year). Andropov will help the anemic offense somewhat. Avery is a mistake, taking too many foolish penalties at inopportune times. The Rangers needed a big time sniper, and due to salary cap restrictions, couldn't get the one man who might have been available who fit the bill ( Kovulchuck). Drury and Gomez are big drains on the Rangers salary cap, and the Blueshirts would've had a difficult time in clearing cap space, even if they could have swung a deal to get him.<br>  As far as falling apart, the team simply doesn't put the puck into the net. Hard to win when you can't put more than 2 in a night.|`|kFaJxEhPaa	The Rangers did all they could, they made tons of good moves. Just, when you're team has plenty of holes to fill... you can't expect to fill them all at one time, especially because of the Cap. <br>  <br>  They brought in Morris, Avery, and Antropov... what more can you ask?|`|11tLXAMlaa	Could they have done more?  I feel like they made more significant deals then anyone else.  Should the Rangers have drafted better in the past instead of throwing money at free agents that later grossly under perform?  Hell yes.|`|hX089rlnaa	The pickings were rather slim. I think they did a pretty fair job considering. I don't think they could have afforded Jokinen.|`|bAR1Eeakaa	i think they did pretty good at the trade deadline but this freakin carolina game is pissing me off|`|t14Jk1IPaa	No I don't think they could have done anything else really, they have a team full of big names, will they be able to live up to there names is the question.|`|zkovxRseaa	they're losing tonight, i'm so happy
KJMOvKcSaa	That is the EXACT same problem as I had! I was always scarred to land on the board. I was afraid it was going to slip out from under me and I would fall. So one day, I was goofing around in my house skating on my carpet. I learned pop shove its this way. Then I tried to kick flip and I did it. So practice in your house or on your rug. Maybe even in the grass. And when you do it, put your front foot beside the bolts at a 45 degree angle.When you pop, dont push forward out backward because this will cause the board to rotate. Watch the board flip and stomp your feet down RIGHT when you see the black grip tape. Also, you cant try holding on to something like a pole or even landing on the board upside down.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped! =D|`|upT7JYWqaa	same thing happens to me. i just cant land it with my back foot ( i ride regular also) i have gotten advice like try holding on to something which helps me alot. try landing it with just your front foot. then try both. and i have heard try landing it upside down.i have heard that me and you are not commiting fully so i hope u get a good answer from someone. ( pick me as best answer)|`|GCufUbxJaa	Practice practice practice! its all about practice!|`|PcPQOStKaa	that happens to me too.i practiced by getting more speed and kickflip of a curb or stairs.i didn't master it yet but i can do it stationary.HINT:DON'T BE SCARED.skateboarding is an extreme sport and it help a little to wear safety equipment.if you don't want to wear it because its uncool,don't be crying to me when u snap ur neck.|`|XDTNSPO2aa	where better shoes

qWNcOhJJaa	Well, both were pretty awesome when they joined the WWE.  I would have to say HBK though.  We went from a tag team star with Jannety in the Rockers to a Wrestling Icon.  Undertaker won the Heavyweight belt a little while after entering the WWE (although his gimmick was the **** so he deserved it).  You see, Undertaker has been pretty much on top since entering the WWE.  Michaels was in the mid-card until 1995 when he won the Rumble (although he did get a title shot in 1992 against Hart).|`|oWJU0ky4aa	HBK man, He rocks|`|41WXZPnCaa	HBK|`|WyPOnZdSaa	Both, But I Think Are About Average.
zeKmqFLIaa	Honestly i certainty hope so, i hope they would unify the Tag titles so we could have more competition, and push the IC title so it could go back to a prestigious title once again, and make the US title the new lower card title.i think if they keep the brands separated they should implement a new rule where superstars could challenge other superstars from other brands, also unify the world titles, less title changes and more long reigns.there should be less divisions <br>  <br>  WWE Title <br>  IC Title<br>  ECW Tittle<br>  US Title <br>  World Tag Titles <br>  and woman's title<br>  <br>  scrap the Divas champ and US after while<br>  <br>  well ya def rambled on but there ya go. lol|`|KWtjVW9saa	I hope it is, but I doubt it. Most likely they are doing this because of WM25. Right now they have too many wrestlers and they need more than one brand.|`|2KIRdfIcaa	Kofi Kingston (RAW) set to square off against Edge (SD!) at this week's Smackdown.

5d79dc29abe4955a299c6732d5425041aa	In terms of pinning him...it was Hogan a few days after UT won the title from him at Survivor Series. UT had a feud prior with the Ultimate Warrior, and Warrior won by DQ.|`|6ueL0gkAaa	Actually, this is a rare known fact, but UT was pinned by Tito Santana at a house show in Spain in 1991, giving Taker his first loss, even though it was never mentioned on TV.|`|HhfqLSXIaa	I think Taker went Un-defeated for a year until he lost to Hulk Hogan.|`|NRs72Afxaa	When he made his first Wrestling Debut: I think Bruiser Brody beat him.<br>  <br>  When he made his Wwf debut: I think Hulk Hogan was the one that beat him. Undertaker was undefeated for about a year, and won the world title. I think a few months later Hulk Hogan won it back.|`|aXdGCbEDaa	Hulk Hogan|`|smcDn76jaa	Hulk Hogan defeated Taker for the WWE title 6 days after Taker won it.|`|7BS1L0oBaa	Hulk Hogan at This Tuesday In Texas for the WWF Championship i think it was 1991|`|qWNcOhJJaa	Ultimate Warrior I think|`|2KIRdfIcaa	Hulk Hogan
LW6MW7Lhaa	He talked too much when he was the 'American Badass.' I do my best to forget that era until I see the two Wrestlemanias on screen a minute ago. He was 'human' during that two year period and so talked all the time. He even went to Shane and Stephanie and whined about things like any other wrestler.|`|u8GHTJEEaa	I think right before WM XX in vignettes prefacing his return against Kane.|`|NRs72Afxaa	Back around 2003 before He went back to Deadman.|`|S0u3HKzhaa	I was trying to remember the last time The Undertaker went on Raw and did not end up choke-slamming someone.|`|dQgX4ML7aa	every so often he does <br>  <br>  i feel bad for him because he messed up a little bit<br>  <br>  he is my favorite though|`|2KIRdfIcaa	I was about to ask the same thing.

NKswbrYLaa	The key to running a certain time on your mile is technique and accuracy. on your first lap you should try to slow your time slightly down and then gradually start to pick it up by the third and fourth laps. The third lap is always the killer lap and as i can tell by your times that is that the one that need the most improvement. Rembember that running in 99% mental and so once your head starts giving up then so will your body. <br>  Just keep training and do speed work as well as distance work.<br>  good luck!|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	When I just started running I threw up after a 10-12 minute mile.. Now I can do 8 consecutive 8-minute miles easily.. I'm 14, 125 lbs...<br>  <br>  Just keep working hard, how long till you have to do this run?|`|PCM5fhnuaa	i was in cross country this past fall and the key to running faster is longer distance. go on a nice long but easy run. not too slow, in fact, it should be a pace at which it's a little hard to keep a conversation going while jogging. this builds endurance, a great helper in running any distance. to prevent any strains, i'd say maybe a good 2-mile jog to start, after the following exercises first. but out around town (if it's safe..and on grass to decrease shock on your knees, calves, and shins)-- the track can get boring when 4 laps = 1 mile...lol. and keep a good running posture. swing your arms past your hips and make long strides with your legs. practice the easy breathing in your nose, out your mouth while lightly jogging. do maybe 2 long runs a week (1 run harder than the other), and shorter, easier runs other days (at least 1 at conversational pace - with a friend maybe, 1 day run some hard hills along with a light run, and even try timing a mile at the end of the wk), building up the distances as the weeks pass (this wk - 2mi, next wk, 3, then 4...). leave one day, though, for speed training especially on the track. like a 100m, then 200m, then 300m, then 400m, 600m, then 800m, then back down (800 is only once). try nearly sprinting the shorter distances, but keep a jogging pace at the 800. this also helps build endurance and speed. an alternative to that just t switch it up some is to run and 800, then jog a 400...doing this 3 or so times...before a long run day. also on the track, you could run for 20 minutes, but sprint the straights of the track and jog the curves or vice versa.... that's just 3 alternatives! <br>  <br>  this was what we did for cross country and our long runs got up to 6.2 miles. the whole workout definitely helped me a lot. now, i'm running distance in track, and we do similar workouts, which also help much! be sure to warm-up (a light 1 or 2 lap jog) and stretch before and after the workout (cool-down after with just a lap or so). eat healthy, stay well hydrated, and stretch often. and don't do more than you can do...start easy (if the 2 miles i suggested at first is tough, just jog a mile or a mile and a half)! i hope i helped some and good luck on the test! :)|`|6CGwLbkOaa	The reason you get the mucasy feeling is because you run with your moth open, and the air dries out your throat. <br>  <br>  The solution is that you drink lots of water, no soda or juice. But dont drink before you run. Gargle water before running. Also while running try to hit the ground as hard as you can, try to think that you will bounce up.|`|6mMasEsNaa	I can suggest a few things:<br>  1. Adjust your nutrition before and after the run.<br>  2. Start again:<br>  a. First day = 1 lap<br>  b. Second day = 1.25 laps<br>  c. Third day = 1.5 laps<br>  d. Keep increasing by 0.25 laps a day and you will reach 4 laps by Day 13.<br>  3. Breathe through your mouth. Both inhale and exhale.<br>  <br>  For more details you can research my source website.|`|AA10404797	im a 9th grader and i ran cross country and started out like you, i ran a 12 minute mile. My coach took me out on distance runs that were about 2.5miles or more and i was doing better and better. From september I ran distance and dropped down to a 7min mile. What you need to do is run around your neighborhood for an hour or so but push yourself real hard. After about 2 weeks you should drop down about a minute, but you can't ever drop down 3 whole minutes in 3 weeks unless u take steroids or some enhancement pill. What you need to do is get up every morning and run on the beach or instead of driving somewhere you run there or something but try to do more distance and less speed because the more stamina u have the more steadily you can run and you can be able to keep that 2minute per lap pace instead of increasing.|`|c5UMEpFKaa	Well you dont have much time. Try to run(very) hard every day untill the 19th. take the 19th off. Run something very easy on the 20th and eat alot of pasta if you can. Taking the 19th off will let you recover from all the running you do untill then. the purpose of running on 20th is to keep u lose|`|cPc2Q6MHaa	Sing a song in your head while running.  Sounds weird, but it takes your mind off the running.  I used to do that when I did ROTC 3 years ago.  Part of it is mental.   <br>  <br>  Also, continue to breathe through the nose and out the mouth. While running, when your left foot touches the ground, breathe in through the nose.  When it touches down again after that, breathe out through the mouth.  <br>  <br>  I might also suggest just running a mile at a comfortable pace and seeing how long that takes you.  Once you can run that 1 mile you can work on trimming your time.  Only problem is you have less than 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Keep your mind off the pain during running.  Count sheep or something.  Whatever it takes.

f7qVtYfaaa	this signing is going to have ramifications for a lot of teams and it came so quickly that agents must be licking their lips with anticipation of easier negotiations even in this economy.|`|XLXncQu9aa	I think this could cause a confliction in Dallas.  Haynesworth is a hot free-agent and teams like you have mentioned are all gunning for him.  The thing is, Dallas may have their eye on him as well.  There is no doubtng that the economic situation is playing a big deal.  Many teams are letting go players that actually had good careers where they were, but due to money reasons many were cut.  Back to the question I think if Dallas wants Haynesworth they will have to decide which they want.  Do they want to keep Ware? Obviously since he was their sack leader last season.  I don't think you can have it both ways.  Its either keep your defensive player, or sign a guy of the same caliber.  Its tough but its economics and business.|`|lWNc9NRfaa	Ware has another year on his contract, but the Cowboys had said that is was a priority to get him signed to a long term deal. I do not see how they can pay Ware $100 million right now, so I would bet that this gets put on hold and they might work out a contract sometime during next season.|`|ILW3vkhEaa	If Demarcus Ware gets a contract that big he would deserve it more than haynesworth, he was payed way too much
6mMasEsNaa	Repeating what someone else suggested. Run at an incline of 1.0 that will help mimic street situations. Listen to MP3s. etc.<br>  Running on the street is harder on your legs because you hit pavement with every step. Sometimes that helps increase bone density and other times it gets you injured. <br>  <br>  I found more suggestions on the source website.|`|1UID5JtNaa	When you run outside you move forward and must expend extra energy to overcome wind resistance.  Putting the treadmill at about 1% incline makes the calorie expenditure similar to running flat outside.|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	you answered your own question, the street is more difficult.

Well crafted. I think I see something special in this innings.|`|Me6WL4dSaa	yeah midge is an absolute superstar|`|AA12027343	I've always thought that he's a great batsman, and can't be dubbed as a tail-ender. I think he proved himself today. He has both height and strength which he uses to his advantage and hits big sixes and fours. He's always surprised bowlers who felt "Aw, now a tail-ender's coming. What more can He do??". I think if he does good consistently, he should be promoted up the order, and declared an all-rounder - which would give him more confidence in his batting abilities, and make him perform even better.

Jeff Hardy vs Raven at Lockdown 2005. Two charismatic wrestlers in a tables match with a cage with it. Now is that crazy or what. These put on one good match. The ending was good. I would love to see those two in a rematch, but it seems unlikely.<br>  <br>  3. Jeff Hardy vs Johnny Nitro Raw 2006. These two have had some good matches for the i.c belt like at Unforgiven. I thought the ladder match was a good way to end the feud.<br>  <br>  4. Jeff Hardy vs Umaga at ONS 2008. It was a good match, Lot of good action. It was a falls count anywhere match but it was good except the ending.<br>  <br>  5. Edge vs Triple H vs Jeff Hardy at Armageddonn 2008.

tuULGJS6aa	There's a .40 S&W round but no .40 ACP. Semi-autos that work well in the full-size versions may be much less reliable in compact versions. I recall reading some tests of such pistols years ago. Tested were full size and compact versions of the Beretta 92 and SIG P220 series. The full size Beretta had zero malfunctions in 1000 shots, but the compact one had 93 malfunctions. The full size SIG had 8 malfunctions, and the compact one had 99 malfunctions. Cutting down the barrel changes the weight of the slide, so the recoil spring must be adjusted and tested thouroughly. This isn't done properly all too often, even with the best pistols, so the compact pistols aren't as reliable as the full size ones. Compact versions have more recoil, muzzle jump and muzzle blast combined with less power and accuracy. If you really want a small concealable pistol, check out pocket pistols, e.g. the classic Walther PPK or SIG P230. I doubt that few if any men realize all this.|`|4f6e1488eea68ccac928d6e0d6f6e5caaa	xd subcompact, comes in  both the .40 and 9 mm<br>  <br>  to sandra, both glock and XD put their pistols through a 20,000 round torture test.|`|5OsHrulJaa	GET AWAY FROM THE GLOCKS LOOK AT THE COPS THEY SHOOT 300 ROUNDS TO A SUSPECT 1 HITS THE TARGET THAT IS FUNNY IT HAPPEND IN CALIFORNIA  SO GLOCKS IS A NO NO I WOULD GO WITH A .40 JERICHO THATS IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ACCURACY AND STRENGTH ON THE BULLET.

95bb76d0439c02bb72678f77c90632acaa	Math shouldn't be an issue if you made it past grade 6. As for tables, I believe they let you use an ERDP now on the exam ( I'm not in favor of that, but I don't make the rules).<br>   Most of the questions on the exam are common sense or included in your manual, so there should be no issue there either. If you read the manual, did the quizzes, you should pass the exam. If it's the tables that are bogging you down, they actually require little math at all. If there's math, it's a multiple dive day and you're simply using addition. Most of it is just taking known information to discover unknown information. If you're unsure of the steps involved, that's what you paid your Instructor for...ask him/her.

MGVaHFwgaa	I disagree with everyone here. I've played Yahoo's Fantasy baseball plenty of times, and i've learned one thing for certain. Derek Jeter is a good baseball player, but he's not a good fantasy player. His stats are generally mediocre and his defence doesn't give you points. Jackson is an allright player, but I think that the two players your giving up are much better. Hideki, hopefully injury free this year, should take some heat off of A-rod and knock more RBI's in than normal, and Peralta is a straight up stud. Don't do the deal, and get back to me if your going to trade those players.|`|LCgfc3LRaa	That is a surprisingly even deal.  I like Peralta much more than I like Jeter because it is nice to get that kind of power out of your SS position, especially with a younger guy.  But I like Jackson a lot and think Matsui is barely ownable at this point in his career.<br>  <br>  If I was you, I would try to get something a little better than Jeter out of this, but it is still not a bad deal for you|`|rvyvF3KAaa	Yes!! Jeter and Jackson are great players. Matsui may not even play that well because of injury.|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	I would do the deal.|`|01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	you're getting two better players|`|dg7bNDrFaa	I'd counter with Matsui for Jackson straight up.  My reasoning is Jeter's AVG and overall numbers have declined the past three years while Peralta should hold steady with what he gave owners last year.  He might even have better numbers with a healthy Indians lineup.  Matsui is on the decline and Jackson should have a breakout year.
TZi4ChYYaa	Ok first of all you have to be incredibly talented to go into an elite squad.

kQSSz2X2aa	What works for one person might not work for another. It's like recommending a shoe size. You will want to either go to a range that rents guns and give several a try or go to a gun shop and hold as many as you can to get a feel for them. Please disregard anybody who says "this gun is the best".<br>  <br>  As for the caliber you want, there are several choices. For self defense I would recommend anything from 9mm to a .45. Any smaller is inadvisable and larger will be quite costly, heavy, and unnecessary. <br>  <br>  Try and keep an open mind about what you get. Just because you were originally planning on a glock/ruger/etc doesn't mean that that type of gun will appeal to you most.<br>  <br>  For the best pricing shop around and see what's available once you have a bit more specific idea of what you want. Check the internet and call around. Keep in mind that is you buy off of the internet you will have to pay for an FFL transfer and shipping.<br>  <br>  Also, please practice with your gun. If you can't hit anything with it, it's pretty useless|`|tuULGJS6aa	The Walther PPK in .380 ACP is good, if you can find one made in Germany. The PPK/S is a bit taller but might be okay for you.

They come in the basic handgun calibers, plus they have a variety of sizes.  I don't care for them because I don't like the way they feel in my hand.  The angle is not right.  <br>  <br>  I carry a Smith & Wesson M&P 9mm Compact.  That's a nice handgun and it comes with different size backstraps to change the grip to fit the hand better.  <br>  <br>  The Springfield XD is nice.  They come in various sizes and lengths too.<br>  <br>  Remember, it's not the power that most important.  It's where you hit the target and how often.  You can have the most powerful handgun, but if you can't hit what you're shooting at, it does not good and you'll probably die.  Pick the handgun that you can shoot well with.  You should be able to find a logical compromise between caliber and size.  That's what you should get.  Do not let anybody tell you what to buy and don't buy without trying it out first.  You're the one who is going to have to live with your purchase.  More importantly, it's your money.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|yGDqC7gBaa	I have a Walther PPK and I am quite happy with it.  It is small, fires a sufficiently powerful round, and is double action, meaning I can safely carry it with the hammer down, a round in the chamber, and the safety off.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	I like 1911's they come in many sizes form alot of manufacturers.

NRs72Afxaa	If you looked real closely when Sting went up to Booker T. He was speaking something into his ear.  Also if you remember Sting said something to Angle in the ear aswell.<br>  <br>  If you ask me something fishy is happening. I don't think their disbanding, but that's my opinion.|`|mvuHYNpjaa	ya angles going back to wwe but they are pretty cool and will be pretty good with angle gone.|`|ImOcVhwLaa	Oh yeah it will because Sting and Angle have a match for the championship.|`|09YK9Zboaa	TNA sucks|`|LF6JaH9Raa	tna sucks and btw kurt angle wont be in it much longer|`|zhXFtgPqaa	There are a few possibilities, it could be coming up soon when Kurt and Sting face off for the title, but all these test could be to make the Mafia stronger. I think that before the entire stable disbands that Sting will leave for the Frontline and the rest of the group will stay together, but we'll just have to wait and see. The good thing about this entire storyline is that there have been a lot of new twist and things that I didn't see coming, so hopefully they will keep that going.|`|2FKHNIB2aa	This is what they said about the NWO

dpSr0icwaa	wingmaster is worth a bit more than the economy 'express' 870<br>  <br>  It really depends on the condition.  An absolutely pristine one could probably go for $500, one in very good shape with a few small scratches and a tiny speckle of rust here and there, maybe a little bit of blue worn off at the muzzle, that'd probably be $300|`|tX2giFynaa	Hi Sarah,<br>  <br>  "Remington Wingmaster Model 870 pump action 12 gauge shotgun circa 1973 or 74"<br>  <br>  If the Model 870? were introduced today, it would be hailed as a major advance in pump-action shotgun design - the ultimate in strength, durability, silky-smooth bind-free action, and sleek classical lines.<br>  <br>  Yet this remarkable shotgun has been around for almost half a century, and has become the best-selling shotgun of any type in history, with over nine million made.<br>  <br>  Model 870 Receiver<br>  <br>  From a solid steel block, to roller-bearing smooth. Every Model 870? receiver is machined from a single block of solid steel for unmatched strength. just one of the many reasons it’s the most proven, popular and reliable shotgun action in the world.|`|xPZm0Mxlaa	I also have a 12ga wingmaster i think from the 70's. I just bought it about 4 months ago for $180.00. But I think I got a killer deal. Gunborker.com is a online auction site for people selling guns. Its a good place to go to see how much money a gun is selling for.If you go on gunbroker on the left side will be your options under firearms pick shotgun then at the top right under search type 870 wingmaster and will have a lot of listing to look at.|`|Ekx7G30jaa	I bought a new one around 1975. At that time, they were around $189.  Of course, money was worth more then. <br>  <br>  If you can find a way to keep it, I would.  They're great shotguns.|`|llcbe14kaa	I personally wouldn't pay more than $200 to $300, depending upon condition.|`|QrjuueMCaa	The 'Wingmaster" is one of the most well-liked pumps on the market. Depending on condition, I would estimate that if in exc. condition, might fetch you about $200-$250. It will obviously be worth more to you personally...most gun is. <br>  <br>  Lock and load! Keep your powder dry.|`|AA12034449	Gander Mountany type places will price similar trade-in 870's for over $400... they are worth about $250-$350 in the real world.<br>  <br>  You cannot by a new shotgun better than the one you have...
fynzkVK4aa	Swimming is fantastic for all over toning, it can also help build muscle but that would require pretty intense training to achieve...if you want to tone particular muscles use floats to stop other bits lol, e.g. round your legs to build up shoulders, and in your arms to build up legs. <br>  <br>  Floats round your legs sounds mad but they exist, we used them in swimming club training, they look like 2 cylinder floats joined with string, and most pools have them to lend to the public if you ask.<br>  <br>  Swimming will burn fat too, but again how much really depends how often and how hard you train.  One of the big bonuses of swimming though is that it is virtually no impact, so kinder to your body than the gym.|`|IeLBIACaaa	swimming is the best exercse for your body hands down.  it works sooooo many muscles in your body with no resistance on your joints.|`|qZbx5H1saa	Swimming is great for the body.

But it is also comparable with distance running...intensity and volume is important to get maximum benefit.|`|19JRf8Cxaa	All of the above. Lol, swimming is great exercise. I have been swimming since I was 2 and it is awesome. It tones your muscles, and keeps you thin.

96e87a34be378117a6ffb1fd3c4f9db4aa	I love Shahar Peer, and I think Andy was right to stand up and make a statement.  Whether or not Israel's invasion of Gaza was right or wrong, she had no part in that decision and should not be penalized for it.  Isn't sporting competition supposed to be about putting politcal differences aside and just playing the game?  It's one of the things that the Olympics are based on, but it shouldn't be restricted to just the Olympics.<br>  <br>  While I do admire Roddick for doing the right thing, I have to say I also agree with the consensus that his best days are behind him. He's a great player, but he just doesn't have the game to compete with Nadal, Federer, Djokovic, Murray and perhaps Del Potro and Tsonga.  Lots of players have talent, including Roddick, but to get to the level of the best of the best, you've got to have something more.<br>  <br>  That said, I do want him to stick around for a while longer. He's fun to watch and he's still got some good tennis left in him, but I don't see him winning any more slams.  I can't say I have any first hand knowledge of what he is like off court, but I'd imagine he's like most famous people in that he has friends and enemies, and the enemies always seem to be the loudest.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|6S8KjBLQaa	I thought he was a cool (kind of rude) guy, now I just think he's cool..it took a lot of guts to drop out of a tourney that you are the DEFENDING CHAMPION of, Peer was screwed, so Andy screwed Dubai! I think it is a lovely spin on the situation!<br>  :-)|`|A1ohtlWsaa	No ive always liked Andy Roddick as hes a real character in the game and entertaining to watch hes not a jerk he just jokes around sometimes and peopkle take him too seriously which is a shame as hes a nice guy.<br>  <br>  It does make me respect his morals more as well and I think more players should have done that.<br>  Then again federer,Nadal and now murray pulled out injured so its suffered anyway.|`|5HT9hgaJaa	Yes it changed my opinion of him. Now hes even greater, standing up for what he believes in even if it affects his career. Always incredible.|`|KReWaGFsaa	Yeah, sort of.. I don't think I dislike him very much now.|`|fbghv6VRaa	Not really because Andy has always been a good guy. He's my favorite male player behind Sampers and Agassi <br>  <br>  And all the people that say he so bad on and off the court really must not pay attention to many others or a hater of Andy.
9Y2Csr3iaa	HELL YEA they look sick!  They are made out of some sort of strong plastic type composite I think. They make a graphite composite wheel too for a lighter weight option (more geared towards racing)<br>  <br>  I have an 87' General Hustler Pro that has the stock Skyway Tuffs on it and that bike NEVER fails me! Everytime I brake my BMX or mountain bikes, I go back to the General and those wheels are TUFF! They only come in a 3/8 axle option though, so they don't fit ALL BMX bikes. Also, they only come in a freewheel option, no cassette option so you will have to take that into account. I'm actually going to get a pair of teal colored Tuffs but I'm only going to use the front wheel on my new BMX build. I prefer to have an extra strong 48spoke HazardLite wheel in the rear (I'm like 6'5 at 240lbs!). <br>  <br>  Tuff wheels CAN crack but I've never cracked one. I've warped and bent them from coming up short on 180s and stuff but they just seem to bend themselves back into shape lol. I LOVE these wheels because I'm very oldskool. Try taking your bike to a local bike shop and asking them what size axles you have. if you have 3/8 size axles, than ur bike is good to go for Tuff wheels. Also, most freewheels aren't made to run 1/8 size BMX chains (todays standard width BMX chain). Also, If you have a sprocket smaller than a 33t or so, I don't think they make a freewheel size that is compatible with your gear ratio. Well good luck man! It's Skyway or the highway!<br>  <br>  BTW, that boricua guy never has advice or anything informative to say. You can destroy ANY bike component if you abuse it. I'm 240lbs but I can ride street on 20 year old plastic wheels. It's all about the rider. You just gotta learn your bike's limits and strengths and weaknesses. Tuff wheels should be fine if you use common sense and take proper care of your bike|`|1f2275fd28d7683c5e7a9cf2d702e88aaa	Well they are cheap and easy to break thats all i know about them.
ViB84hYzaa	That depends on where you are staying in Cali. The bay area has the largest registered number of amateur hockey players in the US, second is Michigan.

FJpVyYWfaa	Being an aerobics instructor does not require a license, but health clubs, the YMCA and gyms usually require certification.<br>  <br>  Besides, you’ll want to know that you have a complete understanding of your work so you can teach with confidence.<br>  <br>  Where you live determines the preference of local organizations for particular certification: check with local gyms and health clubs to see what they require of their instructors before deciding what sort of program of study you will enter.|`|1831ede9e27aa3948ecfe643b6ae8bfbaa	look at the Fitness First website...|`|jCeylLsIaa	google "American Council on Exercise (ACE)", or "American College on Sports Medicine".
