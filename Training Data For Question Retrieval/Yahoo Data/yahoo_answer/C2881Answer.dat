5TKEtXERaa	One word REDUCE.     It is the first of the 3 R's and the most important.   If as the 1st person to answer said we car pool you will reduce emissions, if we reduce unnecessary waste (over packaging, using single use items instead of durable goods i.e. plastic bags instead of cloth, and leaving power consuming items on when not in use) we will reduce air pollution created by manufacturing unneeded plastics and unneeded power consumption. Use cfl's or led's in place of incandescents because even though the cfl's contain around 4 mg of mercury far more than that is released into the environment because of the increased power consumption of the wasteful and short lived (by comparison to led or cfl) incandescent bulb.     As for indoor air quality go with NO VOC paint and look to NASA and the experiments with houseplants as air purifiers.|`|T7zdRWHgaa	Well, the simplest thing I can think of is to spread the word. Tell everybody about air pollution. Make them care (somehow). One significant reason as to why there is so much air pollution is because of the American mindset of living it up to the fullest. "Why bicycle to places when I can just drive?" Now I'm not saying to rally or anything; just let people know what's really going on.    The carpool idea is genuine. Public transportation. But another good way is to plant plants. Photosynthesis is a huge benefit in our world of pollution. and like that other person said, "trees are green."|`|C6GN6SqKaa	I think that one way to clean our air is to car pool. why take two cars when you only have to take one?

An organization like Green Corp is right in step with this call, and to the direction our country is heading in regards to regaining the competitive edge and fighting issues such as global climate change.    Not sure what your daughters field of study is, but I looked at the list of partner organizations and it is impressive.  So not only does your daughter have a chance to gain experience, she may accomplish this in D.C., and she should have chances to forge connections with staff & volunteers at other organizations.  This will be valuable to her in the future, I'm sure.    A lot of competition out there for non profits, but the association list tells you the mom that this company is legit.  Good luck to you and your daughter.|`|DUOoMBqoaa	I have heard good things about green corps in my Environmental Studies department.

fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	I was hoping that you had to discuss endangered species in general rather than just one animal.    To that I would have said you should take a different stance and consider that species become extinct to make room for new rather than try to explain how to save one on it's way out. This is the fundamental disagreement I have with those that support endangered species.     There are more species discovered every year than die off (that we know of) and pretty soon those at the top of the food chain- us- will be crowded out by those we had hoped to help.    Live and let die.
n6xqkPhXaa	Monsoons are intense rainy seasons that happen each year in Asia.  They're great for growing rice and fruit that requires lots of water.  Not so good for growing things like wheat or crops that need more sunlight.

0eFSeap5aa	I had this horribly wretched co-worker.  She and I had to go on this business trip, which was always a miserable experience.  One summer evening we are flying in one of those Buddy Holly killing puddle jumpers and get into a pretty bad thunderstorm.  Imagine a roller coaster inside a paint-shaker during an earthquake, only not that stable.  There is so much lightning that the cabin is continuously lit.  I appreciated this as it allowed me to read.      She is sitting a couple seats over hyperventilating, crossing herself repeatedly and turning paler than bleached linen.  At some point during this lovely journey she turns and looks at me and shrieks, how can you be so calm?  I look up from my book and ask why, what's the problem?  She gets even more hysterical and says, this storm, we could die.    To which I calmly replied.  We are going to die.  Then I went back to reading my book.  She got so hysterical she just made funny sounds for the rest of the trip.  I didn't mean that night, I meant eventually.

This could cause a "pole shift" where the outer mantle of the earth rotates, changing the position of the North and South poles, which could result in major catastrophes such as earthquakes, and tsunamis. Also at the same time this is happening, the earth is going through precession, which means that the earth completes a wobble around its axis. This combination is happening on December 12, 2012.

Before recycling start rethinking the things that you are even needing to recycle and remember that before recyling comes reducing (making less waste in the first place) and reusing (finding ways to use the items you do obtain) - THEN Recycle what's left. It takes energy to recycle, therefore it should always be a last step.     There are many sites you can search to find different ideas - I have listed my favorites below. Check them out and good luck! I applaud your effort!!|`|pnCOR1UVaa	Going green is easy, there are so many great resources about the subject. My personal favorite is "The Green Book" which has parts of its book online as well at www.readthegreenbook.com.    As I have been striving to "Go Green" I realize it is like stepping back in time without getting rid of my modern conveniences. I'm doing many things I learned as a child, like line drying my clothes, sweeping instead of vacuuming, opening the windows in the morning to catch the cool breeze, only buying what I need instead of everything that looks cool, growing some of my own food, and canning what I can't eat now.     To me "going Green" is a frame of mind. Do what fits your lifestyle and do the easy things first, it is a process and like dieting if you go to radical to soon, you are more likely to go back to bad habits. I also believe there are good, better, best choices in most things. If you aren't ready to start a home garden, then try finding a farmers market, until you locate one look for produce grown as close to home as possible and go organic when available.     Many people think "going green" is expensive, I disagree. Some changes may take an initial investment, but they usually have a short payoff time. Things like weatherstiping and insulation cost, but the energy savings will add up quickly. You may need to purchase reusable bags, but most stores give you a 5 or 10 cent credit, so you are paid back within a few months.     My top tips are make your home more energy efficient, that also means using natural light, cooling and heating.     Reduce your packaging, if you eat more fresh food you will generally reduce packaging, it's the same thing they tell dieters, shop the perimiter, that is where all the meat, dairy and produce are located. Only buy what you will use, many Americans throw away a lot of unused food. Buy in bulk, that doesn't just mean large packages, but that area with the bins that you buy only what you plan on using.     Replace disposable items with durable items, if you eat outside often and use disposable paper or plastic plates, it is a wise investment to purchase a set of reusable plastic plates. Replace disposable razors, diapers and cleaning products like swiffer. Avoid bottled water, get a home filter like Pur or Brita.    Recycle, www.earth911.org will help you locate the nearest recycle center. I try to only purchase plastics that are  1 or  2, they are more easily recycled. I also buy recycled products when available, that includes paper towels, napkings, toilet paper, tissue, school/office supplies and clothing.    Detox your cleaning, vinegar and baking soda clean almost anything, they can even losen a hair clog. Seventh Generation and Method are a couple mainstream brands that are very earth friendly.     Just start small and build from there, don't get overwhelmed.|`|lOagICRkaa	Stay nice and beautiful girl!|`|1ehUQH9Oaa	there are alot of ways to stay GREEN    *try to avoid driving or set up carpools  *water bottles are a big problem in lanfills so just use tap  *don't use your heat when u don't need to  *turn off your lights after you leave a room.  * don't liter    hope this helps|`|DL91u0Tyaa	- Go to www.instructables.com and search for "recycle".  - Organize an environmental campaign on your school/office/business|`|Cj5t4vfDaa	use the new floro light globes
pnCOR1UVaa	I made several changes around the house to cut energy consumption by about 30%. Reduced standby energy use, adjusted thermostat, used natural light, opened windows in the morning during the summer to reduce a/c use and several other small things. I am changing my landscape so I can conserve water, shorten showers, and just all around more aware so I waste less water. I do recycle, but I focus much more on reduce. I don't eat many processed or pre packaged foods, so I've cut down on packaging waste and recyclables. I've cut back on meat consumption and eat most of my food from local organic farms. I have driven a Prius for 6 years and traded in our other car for a hybrid a few years ago. I try to buy sustainable products when it comes to things for the home or clothing. I have replaced most disposable or single use items with durable items. I've also switched to non toxic cleaning and beauty products.

YZdTBWoCaa	Too bad you didn't provide a link for that.  It would be easier to give a real answer, instead of being fodder for the deniers to start flinging around.  Yes, there will be some dramatic changes coming for Florida in the next 100 years.  I have seen the ecosystems steadily collapsing there, over my lifetime of 56 years.  Check out the geology of the state. It's nothing but an ancient coral reef, and it's very prone to merely DISSOLVING away !  That, along with even a 1 foot rise in sea level, would make most areas uninhabitable,without groundwater for drinking.  If you live there, start thinking about moving !|`|aWTo9K22aa	Though I do think we have reason to be concerned over global warming, predictions like that are quite exaggerated.     Maybe in 50 years there will be severe problems with coastal erosion, but as far as it all being "under water," not a chance. The highest point of Florida is like 300+ feet above sea level, and most of the state is at least 100 over. Plus, the richest cities like Miami will have no problem spending millions keeping their coastlines where they are. Cities in less wealthy nations will be less able to do so.     And when you look at it from a global perspective--wealthy nations spending billions of dollars to keep their coastlines for 100+ years until the rise finally stops, the economic total would be in the trillions,  much more than it would cost to reduce emissions in the first place--and this economic analysis doesn't even factor in the contamination of groundwater with salt water, the social and economic hardships associated with mass migrations (poor countries), the small islands which WILL be completely under water, and other effects.

Just because it is cold outside doesn't mean it is not slowly warming.|`|53VgQm9Caa	Have you told a psychiatrist about these "green" people you're in communication with?|`|ZH5ZS9zXaa	We are probably just in a warming trend. The earth naturally does this.|`|jS57s3Oeaa	I'm gonna be original and boring by telling you the unwitty truth of the matter. :)    We are not going through an ice age. If the glaciers up by Greenland melt, the cold water will flow into the Gulf Stream and could hinder/stop it, breaking the cycle of heat flow in the ocean and resulting in an ice age.     If you think that everything you do, as an individual, will not effect the enviornment...think again! You certainly have a TREMENDOUS ability to change things. So what's it gonna be...money? Or the planet that allows you to breath and live?|`|n6xqkPhXaa	"Green" people are martians, or at least they think like they're from another planet.    We're going through neither global warming or an ice age, though the planet has been cooling since 1998 (don't pay attention to those dumb NASA graphs saying it isn't, actual data proves it is).  It's impossible to accurately predict what will occur in the future.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	I don't know what "green" people you've been talking to, but they're obviously neither scientists nor familiar with the scientific data.    Short and simple, the planet is warming.  You can see it for yourself in the data here:  http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs...|`|KavbGNaWaa	I believe we are half way through an elliptical orbit around the sun. Which causes the ice to melt, or an easier way to think of it as, we are about in the same time frame when the dinosaurs became extinct 250 million years ago.Now  with the increase of fossil fuel being burnt from our emission it is probably causes a quicker thaw of the remaining ice glacier. The next ice age is about 250 millions years from now. As for global warming it is all a natural cycle of the earth.Nothing we could do to stop it, or prolong it from happening.|`|TkxWfKjsaa	global warming.  ice age will be the result in like 9304680932 years :{|`|hKbvlyBoaa	Global warming will eventually lead to another ice age.
xbgCwmbdaa	http://www.ecomall.com/biz/clothing.htm    I LOVE Earth Shoes for tennis shoes - they are the best shoes in the world...good luck on the heels and flats, I'm not sure how much you'll find.|`|HS44HUrgaa	probably on ebay lol|`|UsEkR3pAaa	free trade means imported into the US without a tarif tax, so no where.
75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	i don't know, but i've heard that,    A)  they're in areas where rain water flows across the road, sometimes at a pretty good clip, and    B)  the poles are to keep cars from being washed into the lake.  you'll note that they are only where, if a car were to jump the curb, it's pretty much straight downhill into the water.
75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	when was the last time you looked up the cost of running one?  i mean, the price of the electricity it uses?    besides, calif already has lots of them that work for free.  they're mountains.  as the air goes up, the water comes out.  millions of gallons.  pretty cool, really.|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	If there's not enough moisture in the air to rain, you won't get much water out of the air.   Best way would be to cut down on water use.|`|aWTo9K22aa	It's pretty expensive to turn salt water into fresh water, and requires a great deal of energy--something California is not too keen on wasting.
