77f2167ae25e273ae41b186616d7ac94aa	Back in the day when the Inbox for Yahoo! mail was only 4-6 MB, you could save to your "Briefcase" which had a whopping 30 MB! But then Yahoo!  made the inbox bigger to 250 MB and eventually up to a gig, then unlimited (within "Reasonable Use") that 30 extra MB was nothing.<br>  <br>  I hardly use mine and now going back it's like a time capsule of files from when I was in Jr. High (Like grade 8, maybe 9, I am in collge now, last year I was in grade 12).<br>  <br>  But ya back then the 30 MB was bigger than the inbox so you could put bigger attachments there, but now you can just keep all your emails. Also, for Photo's Yahoo! had Yahoo! photos which was like Breifcase but only for jpg files. That closed down a while back when Yahoo! integrated with FlickR, but what sucks about that is for FlickR you have to pay for features that Yahoo! photos offered for free|`|FlNmPK83aa	I think there used to be an option to save an email attachment to your briefcase. That's what I used to do sometimes. I'm not sure why (seeing as either way they would still be stored on Yahoo.)<br>  <br>  It's really sad to see Yahoo! Briefcase go. Some of the files that I had saved from years ago really brought back some memories.

e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	Spammers get smarter every day, some of them misspell keywords on purpose to fool mail filters, others are able to make it look as if you yourself are the sender of the spam arriving in your mail box. But knowing all that doesn't help much, right? <br>  <br>  Okay, here's how to fight spam and scams:<br>  <br>  #1: Yahoo has a spamguard filter, but only if multiple users report an address as spam will it be treated as such by the filter.<br>  <br>  You have a personal list for blocking addresses in spam options. Anything you mark as spam in Mail classic will be added to that list, in New Yahoo mail adding addresses to the list has to be done manually. If you ever receive anything from those addresses in the future, it will be deleted automatically, you won't even notice when you got some more crap from them. One problem though: the list of blocked addresses is limited to 500 and spammers often change their address. So you must sometimes delete some of the older blocked addresses to make room for new ones.<br>  <br>  Go to this link where everything is explained in detail:<br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/us/tutorials/mail/mail/spamguard1.html">http://help.yahoo.com/us/tutorials/mail/...</a><br>  <br>  #2: The Federal Trade Commission (www.ftc.gov) is supposed to help you eliminate spam mails. Forward spam to: spam@uce.gov, in the subject line enter something like "unsubscribe link results in more spam", "unwanted spam message", "no unsubscribe link" or something similar.<br>  <br>  Here's how to do the forwarding bit: click the crtl key and at the same time click the "forward" button to forward a message as an attachment, mac users should click the "apple" key and click "forward" simultaneously. <br>  <br>  When the FTC gets your mail, they will look into the matter and when they find out who the spamming source is, they will take legal actions. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/spam/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/sp...</a><br>  <br>  #3: Check Mailwasher, it helps to eliminate spam from your inbox...<br>  <br>  Set up your email account(s) in MailWasher and hit the "Check Mail" button. It then downloads all new message headers and displays message details alongside each one (priority, subject, from, to, etc.). Any email that MailWasher considers to be spam is highlighted for easy sorting.<br>  <br>  Two checkboxes are located next to each message header: "Delete" and "Bounce". If you click "Delete" the email will be marked for deletion, click "Bounce" and the mail will be marked for bouncing - a fake "address not found" email will be sent to the sender. Once you have decided what to bounce and delete, click "Process Mail" to get it done and your mail client launched for downloading all accepted emails.<br>  <br>  MailWasher has a "blacklist" and a "friends list" to enter good and bad email addresses. Addresses in the blacklist are marked for deletion, and addresses in the friends list will be marked as okay. Filters can be set to increase MailWasher's effectiveness. You can have email addressed to "undisclosed recipients" automatically deleted and bounced for example.<br>  <br>  Note: the program is free but limited to one email account. MW Pro supports multiple mail accounts.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mailwasher.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mailwasher.net/</a>

7u77AiBjaa	Closing your entire Yahoo account gives you the best chance to completely remove your 360 space from the web. Closing a Yahoo account does cancel access (and for some removes associated content) to Yahoo services under that account. Otherwise, if you do not want to lose your Yahoo ID, your second-best option is content removal and permissions adjustment.<br>  <br>  So, here are your two choices:<br>  <br>  1) Go to <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/changing_users/edit-23.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/ch...</a> and click the Account Deletion link. If you read through the text, you will find this will also delete all associated services for that account like Yahoo! Mail. I still recommend removing any content that you've added to your 360 before deleting your entire account.<br>  <br>  NOTE: If a COMPLETELY deleted account doesn't result in a deleted 360 space, you can contact Yahoo Customer Care through this Account Deletion Help Form at <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/registration/deletion.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/re...</a> and/or use the 360 ABUSE FORM at <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/abuse.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/abu...</a> . You can also call 1-866-562-7219, 1-408-349-1572, 1-408-349-3300 Hours: 8a-5p M-F (Pacific).It's possible that you won't be deleted COMPLETELY from the user registration database until after 90 days.<br>  <br>  2) If you don't want to completely lose your Yahoo ID, then I suggest removing all content and information that you added to Yahoo! 360. Make all your settings (basic info, blog, communication, and every module on your "My Page") set to "Friends" or "Just Me (Private)". The "Just Me (Private)" setting is preferred, but if you don't have that option choose "Friends." Delete all your friends (see <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/friends/friends-05.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/fri...</a> ). Remove content from automatically public areas like the Personal Profile Picture module and Top Page comments. Change the background back to the default version - either called the "custom" or "classic" theme. Then, that's it.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  With that said, usually closing your account should only be a last resort. There are other features and strategies that can be used to deal with "rude people":<br>  <br>  1) Literally, ignore "rude people". Do not engage abusers of the service. It's not necessary to communicate with them at all.<br>  <br>  2) Use the "ignore" features so that you don't receive more messages, IMs, or invitations from that account. See <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/friends/friends-04.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/fri...</a> for instruction.<br>  <br>  3) Ignoring someone doesn't stop them from commenting on the page. However, this is why you have permissions to stop such action.<br>  <br>  You will have to change your Top Page and Blog comments from "Public" permissions to "Friends" permissions to block out people who are NOT your connected 360 friend.<br>  <br>  TOP PAGE:<br>  - In your "My Page," click on the "Settings" link for the comment module (in lower left corner of the page).<br>  - In the "Allow comments by:" drop down, set it to "Just Me (Private)."<br>  - Uncheck the "enable quick comments box" as well. <br>  - Click the "Save" button.<br>  <br>  BLOG:<br>  Click "Edit Blog Settings" link on your "My Blog" page. Change the permission for "Who can post comments to your blog" to Friends. Click the "Save" button.<br>  <br>  If the ignored person IS a connected friend, you can either remove them as a friend (as stated here <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/friends/friends-05.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/fri...</a> ) and then set your permissions as stated above. You can also put friends in different categories and then limit the permissions for certain areas to certain groups of friends. See <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/permissions/">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/per...</a> .<br>  <br>  4) Report the person, as you've done. But it's important that you point out specific violations of Yahoo! 360 guidelines or Yahoo Terms of Service. Also, it's best to use the U.S. version of the Abuse form at <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/abuse.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/abu...</a> . Yahoo will not notify you about what actions that they take, which probably won't be immediate. You'd have to check back to that person's 360 space to see if there's been any change.<br>  <br>  5) Close the old 360 space and start a new 360 space (on a new Yahoo account).<br>  <br>  Make sure that you have completely cleared the old 360 page. And do let "TRUSTED" contacts know about the impending move. Record in a text file all their 360 web page addresses, so that it will be easy to find them and invite again.<br>  <br>  On this new 360, make sure that personal information is kept off the top page that the harasser can use to find you. Don't post a 360 image of yourself in the personal profile pic area. The safest option is to confine anything personal to the blog area and make the blog only visible to connected friends via permissions. Use a new nickname, of course. Also, be aware of safe computing practices:<br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/safetytips.html.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a><br>  <br>  Lastly, feel free to contact the police about any potential Internet crimes.
AA11307940	The Yahoo game server was down for maintenance and updates, they had a message on the front page of the game site saying how long it will take. They have been doing 1 area at a time. It already happened in my area.
bQisGgSsaa	Some people just want to ask question for the fun of it, and see what kind of Answers they receive.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Many people ask just to pass time in office<br>  -Som e may not know how to ask and how to select best <br>  --You know that ,you can write e mail messages to the  people who have answered here and get more information by clicking their profile  in this section.|`|WseLyvSpaa	People do this in real live conversation too, so I don't think you can blame the internet or YA.|`|tmyiEtWhaa	some people just say they agree with the asker even though they're real beliefs are of the contrary. yes some people do just answer mindlessly to get 10 points. SOME people care more about a few points on here rather than actually helping people, which shows the greed in people today. and when people can't be bothered answering someone they sometimes say "FREE 2 POINTS" <br>  <br>  but the weird thing is, the points actually have no point. they don't really serve any purpose :S<br>  <br>  but for some reason we enjoy receiving them.|`|YujjEUjEaa	because they want to see if what they are thinking actually correct or its wrong. and if they get confirmation from someone else they tend to believe that that person is telling them they are right, so that is why they get the best answer|`|DmD1ypYGaa	they ask questions because they want to receive answers in order to settle their curious minds|`|XEcoJnt4aa	To  kill time, I guess. I ask dumb questions in hope of being humored mostly. Have a nice day!|`|DCFpYvxEaa	well, i really was going to say i agree because i do, but also if the ask er just wants to hear if someone agrees with them, then there's no point of really being on here. think about it: if you are doing this just to see how many people agree with you, and not to actually get the right answer, then you really shouldn't be on here. now, as for polls, that's a different story, at least I think so. so if you are going to ask a question, make sure it's one you REALLY want help on, and not one that you just need a second opinion on.|`|r8qbCKgfaa	well, honestly I do agree, and I think I know why people do it. They want to be assured that their belief is not the "radical" or "unpopular" one. It would be much like believing that football is harder than soccer and going up to a group of football players and asking them which sport was harder; football or soccer. The majority would respond that football is harder, though in reality it is not comparing apples to apples so there is no definitive answer.<br>  <br>  Basically people are doing it so they can feel better about their own beliefs. I hope that answer was real enough for you.|`|rRO3x9hZaa	They probably just want to feel justified in the way they feel and think. They want to believe that there are people out there that agree with them...and who picks the "best" answer? The person who asked the question. That person is only going to pick the answer they want to hear, aren't they?|`|GDdTEEDZaa	i really think yahoo is a dumb i just do it for the fun of it when im bored but all you see everyday is the same questions over and over again ,and yeh i get your point some people are just wired i guess|`|Rd1FLoCbaa	well some people need to get their head<br>   out of their asses
44vgFcKcaa	Unfortunately ads are a way of life. The only way to avoid them is to pay for your E-mail service, and even then I do believe they also contain some advertising there.<br>  So bite your check and just ignore them as best you can.|`|suPD7c3gaa	Agreed, they are pretty bad.  But someone paid Yahoo to have those ads placed.  We may not like them, but they are there to stay.  If it weren't for people paying for ad space, we wouldn't have this site, and many other interactive sites for free.  Yahoo wouldn't allow any ads that are inappropriate.  That one just happens to be quite unattractive and unrealistic.  I've seen a lot worse on TV.  I'd rather see the wrinkle add that the diarrhea ads, or p_ _ _s enhancement ads we're seeing on TV.

7u77AiBjaa	Patience is necessary if you use the 360 image feature. Switch your Y/A profile setting back to the 360 image option and wait.<br>  <br>  OFTEN it takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up to changes made through Yahoo! 360. In the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon), words/red "x" in box will show, or an old 360 image will appear. Just choose the 360 image option in your Yahoo! Answers profile (whether the new image is showing or not) and let your picture stay that way until the Y/A system makes the adjustment to the correct image. <br>  <br>  After a few days of waiting, you can certainly contact Y/A staff by posting a BUG report on the Y/A forum at <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . I recommend putting BUG: to start the title of your message. Also, you can do a search on the forum and add a comment to messages other people have posted about the problem. Although, you are not guaranteed a written response from staff. This problem can only be resolved system-wide (temporarily or permanently) by Yahoo staff.|`|gGSf6ED5aa	Yeah, it takes even up to a day.<br>  <br>  :)
7u77AiBjaa	UPDATED: You're welcome. Again, that link leads to the Yahoo! Profile, not Yahoo! 360. Please follow the instructions below. If you feel like you've already created a 360 space, then ignore that part of the instructions that talks about activating it:<br>  <br>  Create a 360 space at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes take hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. In the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon), show a red "x" in box or words, or display an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though. <br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.

If people were winning 100 million every day it would be on the news with pictures of the lucky people.<br>  <br>  Unless you enter a lottery or contest, such as with one of the magazine companies, any notification is a scam. If you get 100 million you will not be notified by email.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?|`|95d2865a9c20c7a7dd35578183bbfd82aa	I get about 2 lottery emails by week (I would be a millionaire if they were real)<br>  <br>  I have answered some of them just for fun to see what's the scam, and basically they will ask you for your personal info; name, S.S. number, phone, address, date of birth, credit card number (all they need to steal your identity). Then they will tell you that you need to pay some "legal fees" and "paperwork" to get your 1 Million lotto (invisible) money. Incredibly some morons send the money and then they end up looking like idiots.<br>  <br>  Just use logic: did you bought any lottery ticket from them??? They are all fake, don't let them fool you.|`|44vgFcKcaa	It is a scam to get your personal information and/or money.<br>  If you did not play a certain lottery, then how could you possibly win it?<br>  And, please, never, ever give your personal information out to anyone, be it E-mail, snail mail, phone call, or at the front door.

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	No, Yahoo Briefcase is/was a separate service provided by Yahoo, that is being shut down. Your email and 'private' folders on it are safe.|`|suPD7c3gaa	Nope... no connection.  If you weren't using the Yahoo!  Briefcase service, there's nothing you need to do.
Q8drq7PEaa	I'm having the same problem. Searches produce either no results whatsoever or just a fraction of the results they should be producing. This has been going on for at least a week or so. I have no idea how to fix it -- hope someone else does....
suPD7c3gaa	As you can see by the many questions about it asked here, and by the notices you probably received from Yahoo...  yes, the Yahoo! Briefcase is closing down as of March 30th.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Yes, but this will only affect you if you USED the Briefcase service/option. This does not affect the 'normal' Yahoo email service.
AA11004428	why is this in the yahoo! section?
9BL6LFJ9aa	It's  an anti spam measure that Yahoo are trying out to make sure it is a person sending the mail not a bot.. I am very curious as to why they are going to these lengths though. It would suggest that they are aware of some serious bot spammers infiltrating Yahoo Answers. We will have to wait and see how long it continues.
7u77AiBjaa	If you mean that the old pic still shows on Yahoo! Answers, patience is necessary if you use the 360 image feature. Switch your Y/A profile setting back to the 360 image option and wait.<br>  <br>  OFTEN it takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up to changes made through Yahoo! 360. In the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon), words/red "x" in box will show, or an old 360 image will appear. Just choose the 360 image option in your Yahoo! Answers profile (whether the new image is showing or not) and let your picture stay that way until the Y/A system makes the adjustment to the correct image. <br>  <br>  After a few days of waiting, you can certainly contact Y/A staff by posting a BUG report on the Y/A forum at <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . I recommend putting BUG: to start the title of your message. Also, you can do a search on the forum and add a comment to messages other people have posted about the problem. Although, you are not guaranteed a written response from staff. This problem can only be resolved system-wide (temporarily or permanently) by Yahoo staff.<br>  <br>  <br>  UPDATE: If you are solely talking about the 360 image not updating in Yahoo! 360, then the personal/profile photos module is buggy. You may want to try loading the image in different spots or wait to see if the image will appear. However, too much adjustment to that module is a risk - you can lose spots and/or elongate your Top Page.<br>  <br>  Make sure the image that you use is JPEG-formatted and under 5MB in file size. You should try re-saving the image in Microsoft Paint and then load it. Sometimes that helps.

They are really not important. <br>  <br>  You could have 200 thumbs down for an answer and still be selected as best answer, you still get 10 points for best answer despite what the other 200 users thought of your answer.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	No it just means someone looking at the question after you gave the thumbs down because they could.

g1scTbOzaa	Let me answer the third question first:<br>  <br>  Do not, and I repeat, DO NOT, get drunk for your first time.  Is that really how you want to remember it?<br>  <br>  1.) How bad does it hurt on a scale from 1-10?? 1 being ehh, not at all. 10 being UNBEARABLE, terrible pain.<br>  <br>  Pain is different depending on the woman.  Do you still have your hymen?  If so, it will hurt more than a woman who lost it years prior.<br>  <br>  2.) What EXACTLY does it feel like during the entering or first thrust?<br>  <br>  It's uncomfortable.  There's nothing romantic about the first time.  If your boyfriend takes his time and considers your feelings, it will really be better for both of you.  <br>  <br>  4.) I asked my boyfriend if he could maybe drug me or something, so I wouldn't feel it, he said he doesn't really want to, but would I feel pain then?<br>  <br>  You know this is absolutely ridiculous.  Don't even think of this as an option.<br>  <br>  If you're truly ready for sex, and I mean ready physically, emotionally, maturally, psychologically etc., the pain shouldn't be what's on your mind.  Since that seems to be the crux of your worries, I would say you aren't ready.  There's no rush; you have plenty of time.  <br>  <br>  As far as pain with a tampon, you really need to get checked by your physician.  You should NOT be experiencing any pain with a tampon (unless you're inserting it incorrectly).  Actually, you shouldn't feel a thing.  It might be psychosomatic as well (psyching yourself into believing it's going to hurt so it does).<br>  <br>  You should get checked for endometriosis or PID (pelvic inflammatory disease).  If you get an all-clear, it's time to start thinking on the psychological level.  :)|`|tdQTZPI7aa	go see your gynecologist first and she/he can cut the hyman and then there will be zero pain|`|DxbaEPbUaa	foreplay and a good vaginal lubricant can greatly help to reduce the pain associated with the first sexual encounter. don't worry, it won't be as painful as you might think!|`|1DNSRjVjaa	first of all i'm not judging you whatsoever<br>  <br>  <br>  okay if you really love him and "ready" to give away something so precious (your virginity) then you wouldn't worry so much about the pain.<br>  and you will definitely not get drunk. As for drugging yourself i think that is senseless<br>  When you are truly ready, you will not care what pain it will be because you love your boyfriend<br>  <br>  I think you should wait until you are married and truly ready to live the rest of your life with him|`|vooQPKTdaa	if you use alot of lube it shouldnt hurt alot

ECwvhDbnaa	I've done every possible thing from making sure my java is enabled to cleaning out my temporary internet files..and cookies. This is getting to be a little too much! If anyone finds out the reason behind this.. email me.. just like it says here. It makes no sense some can get in but others canna. Ciao|`|Zr1neefJaa	It wasn't working for me either the other day.  Tried it a few hours later and it worked.  Never knew what the problem was.
suPD7c3gaa	Sorry.... once the trash folder is emptied, there's no way to retrieve any of the emails.  Yahoo! empties that folder and the Spam folder for  us every 3 days or so, so there's no need to delete.
