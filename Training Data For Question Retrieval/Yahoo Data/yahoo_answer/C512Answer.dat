SsfnitjXaa	AT 38 I went through the same thing.  I also had 2 children and did not want any more (husband had a vasectomy).  I do not take hormones (an option that will be given at your age.  I did not have any problems or side effects after my uterus was removed (I still have my ovaries).     Make sure:  The doctor cuts you horizontally and ask if he could do a super nice job because you don't want a messy scar (my doctor could have done better).    Make sure you lift NOTHING for 8 weeks (I lifted a skillet at 4 weeks and ripped myself open)    Some people have trouble with fallen bladders down the line (I have not , and that can be repaired, just luck if it happens or not).    Why not try the other options first, you can always do the surgery later if they don't work.|`|ylJoUuMDaa	There are no side effects from a hysterectomy.  I assume they are leaving your ovaries intact.  This is a common operation, you will be out of the hospital in a few days, take it easy for a couple of weeks and you'll feel right as rain in no time.|`|nUdbTUtHaa	You should have asked your dr. these questions....how is that not an obvious solution?!

Vaginal dryness    Thats the side effects =P  That dont mean you will have them all,its like a pill you get some,and some you dont =)  By the way,this is called a Hysterectomy|`|pe415yQAaa	uterus?...death|`|AA12266052	Do you mean "surgical removal of uterus"?  Other risks that are possible from a hysterectomy include:      * Injury to nearby organs, including the bladder or blood vessels      * Injury to bowel      * Pain with intercourse  Most patients recover completely from hysterectomy. Removal of the ovaries along with the uterus in premenopausal women causes immediate menopause, and estrogen replacement therapy may be recommended.  Some women worry that their sexual function will be decreased after removal of the uterus. Researchers have found that sexual function after a hysterectomy depends most on sexual function before the surgery. If a woman had good sexual function before the surgery, she will continue to have good sexual function afterward. If you experience a new decrease in your sexual function after hysterectomy, talk to your health care provider about possible causes.  When only the uterus is removed there is a three times greater risk of cardiovascular disease. If the ovaries are removed the risk is seven times greater. Several studies have found that osteoporosis (decrease in bone density) and increased risk of bone fractures are associated with hysterectomies. This has been attributed to the modulatory effect of estrogen on calcium metabolism and the drop in serum estrogen levels after menopause can cause excessive loss of calcium leading to bone wasting.|`|7s60QnAGaa	death|`|hrFGKAeraa	I don't think there are any bad side effects, i've known at least 4 women who have had theirs removed. If you need to get this done then you should do it. This question is important, you should  ask your doctor, they'll know the answers.|`|AA10572259	I'm sorry to hear you are having problems.  If you are sure you don't want any kids then taking our your uterus, a hysterectomy, is a very common procedure.  You should go look at a few medical websites to see what the pros and cons of the surgery are.  I'm sure your doctor can and should go over your different options and tell you what they think will work best for you.  The websites I found below I didn't read but look like they have a lot of information.  If you call your doctors office they can give you paperwork explaining it too.|`|4Ugrxl2vaa	My heart goes out to you dear, and I don't wish to be crude. As a man I would say that there's no bottom...|`|8PDzaAJcaa	After recovering form the surgery itself there aren't really any side effects except no period! If your ovaries are removed then you will go into menopause, for me that was really only an issue for a few months. If you are having problems like this you should really consider the hysterectomy, if I would have done it sooner I may not have developed uterine cancer.
h5xSfcT6aa	i think its unlikely to be honest. it will be in fact the opposite at first, because they will need money for tests, new equipment etc etc and not many people will be doing it. its only when its starts to become popular that the price might go down, or they may keep it the same to make money, or to buy equipment needed, hire doctors etc, if its that popular they will need supplies.    i mean, if you think about it the cost for implants has never really gone down, so i doubt this will either. if it does, im thinking 10 years ahead or more.    dont forget it will take time to perfect the operation anyway, and for women to trust it and go for it. at least a few years.    sorry!  xxx|`|O37GMeOyaa	Fat grafting is not comparable to implants in all cases. It will only give you a cup size increase at most and might not last as long. I've read that sometimes they have to be redone after only a year. More case studies need to be done before you can make a smart decision about the safety or result of this enhancement.
CuVnpxh3aa	You do not move, they give you a paralyzing drug so yo won't move. I have watched many surgeries during my paramedic clinicals and the people do not snore or make any noise, they just sleep. A Dr gives you a medication so that you will not remember what happened while you were under having surgery. The Dr's don't want you to move or remember so they make sure you don't. It is nothing to worry about but think about it, have you ever remembered what happened when you had surgery. Usually you would wake up if someone started to cut on you but you don't because of the medication.

The other is many cultures take baths instead of showers your just soaking in the dirt in the bath and end up with on odd smell. Taking a shower washes the old skin and dirt off with a loofah and some shower jell and scrub hard to get the old skin off and a new scent on. An antiperspirant deodorant rather then just deodorant after as the deodorant will only mask the smell the antiperspirant will help with perspiration wash your hands after the bathroom.

yE2vM76naa	The problem is not exactly the peel, its the skin - Asian skin is more likely to heal with spots of hyper-pigmentation (i.e. dark blotches) more than caucasian skin. This doesnt mean that they can't be done. but care should be taken that a prescription medication (such as hydroquinone 4%) should be used before AND after for several weeks to prevent this from happening.    Try to find a plastic surgeon who is familiar with working with your type of skin.  True, a dermatologist could do such a thing, but really, I would want someone who specializes in making people look better.
Zwpagpubaa	They hook you up to a heart machine.  It does the work of your heart while the procedure is performed.|`|AA11622701	Define 'dying'.  If you say that the death is when the heart ceases to function, then every patient in a heart transplants dies.      If you defy death as the point at which body functions and brain activity can no longer be sustained, then no.  Artificial means are used to continue these function until the new heart resumes them.    Today, i am not aware of a single legal or medical precedence for considering a person who has had a heart transplant to have died. They do not issue a death certificate, probate their will, pay off their life insurance, or desolve their marriages.  So a person receiving a heart transplant is not considered to have died.|`|AA12266052	A healthy heart is obtained from a donor who is brain dead but on life support. The healthy heart is put into a special solution that preserves the organ.  The patient is put into a deep sleep with general anesthesia, and a cut is made through the breast bone. The patient's blood is circulated through a heart-lung bypass machine to keep the blood oxygen-rich. The patient's diseased heart is removed and the donor heart is stitched in place. The heart-lung machine is disconnected. Blood flows through the transplanted heart.|`|MpcZb1Jhaa	the docs use a heart- lung machine attached to the person as an artificial heart to pump blood to the lungs to get air and then around the body.    also they decrease the body's core temperature so the kinetic energy will go down, reducing the need for oxygen, giving the doc more time to play with the body.|`|d60972a141a0ece3ed840882b5123229aa	in simple terms...    A machine is used to take over for the patients heart. this will continue the flow of blood through his body while his heard is removed and replaced with the donor heart. once everything is in place (again, simplified version) the heart gets restarted and the flow of blood is again controlled by the heart and the machine is disconnected.|`|1c4256f905a272aacbd200f6119e4124aa	The patient is put on a by-pass machine that keeps the blood  circulating through the organs and brain while bypassing the heart itself. It also oxygenates the blood, so breathing can be stopped temporarily as well. When the new heart is put in place, the machine is stopped, the new heart is "shocked" into life (the same way they use the paddles in the ER, only these are much smaller,) to start it up, and the patient is gradually given back his/her blood; the drugs that suppress the breathing and heartbeat are withdrawn.

I'm probably going to be boo'd by the dairy association or something, but honestly you would need to drink like 10 large glasses of milk per day to make that much difference.

There are also lots of cereals and other products that are fortified with D.     I am not a doctor, but I am chronic Vitamin D and B12 deficient- You should always consult a physician before beginning a new health regimen.     Hope this helps.
uD7lobc0aa	I appreciate your curiosity and I respect your question.    However, what you are asking is not something you should direct to novices (casual people on a q & a site).  Very few people who see your question are qualified to give an educated answer.    Above all, DO NOT change anything with your medication without discussing it with professionals.  If you must, find a new doctor.  Don't just make changes based on something you hear from from friends, on the web, or other unqualified sources.

They will admit you and keep you overnight if you tell them you are having suicidal thoughts, they have to keep you for 24 hours in most states.  Definitely talk to a doctor, you probably need counseling and maybe medicine to help balance your mind and take the edge off.    Confide in a good friend, or a family member.  No one will be angry, they will want to help you.  They might not notice you have a problem, but trust me, they will want to help you if they know about a problem.    I had a close friend commit suicide and really, I never knew he was sad or depressed.  He hid it from all of us and I wish more than anything he would have said something because I know all of his friends would have done everything they could to help him.

xfpJGBfwaa	Millions of people have scoliosis. Check with your doctor because you might need to visit a pain center and have nerve blocks in one or another area.  That would be after you've gone through physical therapy, etc so be patient and go through the system - maybe it will help you before you get to the pain center level.  But usually scoliosis doesn't get better with much of anything.      On the ergonomics front there is a lot that can be done.  One of the best things is those keyboards that are in pieces so your hands can be farther apart while typing (assuming you touch type).      http://www.ergonomicresource.com/keyboar...    Make sure you call and ask about backorders on that website.  They were plagued by that problem last time I tried to get something from them.  But they do have the best selection I've ever seen.
ZNbauLJzaa	Any doctor can do the blood test for diabetes.  I would not advise trying to diagnose this yourself by using someone's glucometer.  Diagnosing diabetes is not a do-it-yourself project.  Those symptoms could be anything, not just diabetes.  Someone with undiagnosed diabetes is usually quite sick and vomiting not just tired and thirsty.  Numbness in the hands can be a nerve problem or a neck problem, it takes years for unchecked diabetes to cause nerve damage.  Contact your local state representative's office.  I have found these folks to be a wealth of helpful information.  Ask if there is state or federal help for someone who needs health care.     Diabetics follow low carbohydrate diets, but this may not be enough depending on the type of diabetes and how high a person's blood sugar is.|`|CQww1c2daa	He should go to see an Endroconologist who specializes in diabetes but a regular doctor would be alright.|`|W7LGoC3yaa	Ask friends or co-workers where a free clinic is or call the health department.  Please do not use anyone's glucometer to test yourself.  It is not meant to be used as a diagnostic tool and will not be accurate for that.  A family doctor can diagnose diabetes.  If you husband is diabetic the cost of a glucometer, the lancets and test strips and medication or insulin can be expensive so you may want to get on Medicaid.  All of the symptoms you mention are symptoms of diabetes.  Other symptoms are frequent urination, moody, blurred vision, unexplained weight loss, sores that are slow to heal, impotency.  If he has diabetes the doctor will give him a food plan to follow to help keep it under control, and advise him to lose weight if he is overweight.  Health care shouldn't be a luxury, so I hope he gets the help he needs.|`|4663873fae288f697d0782005be07c6caa	Find yourself Minute Clinics in your area.

I had the same thing and was given tests. I wasn't even close to being a diabetic.

Now.|`|vk1TcfTeaa	Seek emergency medical help if you have symptoms of heart or circulation problems, such as chest pain, weakness, shortness of breath, slurred speech, or problems with vision or balance.    This medicine can also increase your risk of serious effects on the stomach or intestines, including bleeding or perforation (forming of a hole). These conditions can be fatal and gastrointestinal effects can occur without warning at any time while you are taking ibuprofen.      Call your doctor at once if you have symptoms of bleeding in your stomach or intestines. This includes black, bloody, or tarry stools, or coughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds.    Do not take more of this medication than is recommended. An overdose of ibuprofen can cause damage to your stomach or intestines. The maximum amount of ibuprofen for adults is 800 milligrams per dose or 3200 mg per day (4 maximum doses). Use only the smallest amount of this medication needed to get relief from your pain, swelling, or fever.      Overdose symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, drowsiness, black or bloody stools, coughing up blood, shallow breathing, fainting, or coma.     There is a reason there is dosage recommendations. go to the ER if you have signs of overdose.|`|AA11397003	you need medical help ASAP|`|KSKtr3DKaa	dude, thats pretty cool

At that rate, if you ate exactly the same amount as you did at a steady weight, you would use up less than 1 oz. of fat by riding 4 miles.    Fat is a pretty efficient means of storing excess fuel.    ----  Edit: Sorry Zach, to burn 1100 calories in an hour of riding, you'd have to be an elite rider going at time trial pace, i.e., well into your red zone.  In the process, you'd cover close to 30 miles.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	You burn roughly 1100 calories, in that hour of riding. One pound of fat equals 3500 calories. However, if your calories consumed does not change....the exercise becomes a complete wash, or no loss of weight. You need to eat 500 calories LESS each day, just to lose one pound a week.    Increase your mileage to six miles, in one hour....and you will burn 1455 calories. Raising intensity, multiplies fat burn astronomically.|`|hat60KYXaa	You lose it in calories, but it depends on how many calories you take in each day.

If you use a hair dryer, make sure it is on cool.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Really simple. Twirl it around and let centrifugal force get the water out. Do not blow into it as this will contaminate the inside of the tubing which is what you're trying to avoid.  Or just hook it up to the machine woithout hooking it up to the nebulizer. That'll blow it out too.|`|aMQD2UnWaa	just let the nebulizer run while tube is attached and it should help dry it out.  Also, make sure to disconnect the tubing when done so condensation doesn't accumulate in the tubing.

aLji0DOSaa	You probaly can' t sleep becasue your nervous/ excited (?)(who would be tests- urrrgh!!)  or just got a lot on your Mind. I often can't sleep, but what i do is:    Have a small stroll around your house/ home, make-sure it is uite cool, not to hot, not to cold, then get into bed and make sure the room is a sutible temperature. have a glass of water, or maybe warm milk, and lay down, make sure it isn't too hot or cold, if it's hot, take of your duvet, now this may sound childish, but to help you sleep think about something relaxing( swinging in a hammock) and keep thinking about it, don't think about anything else, you will eventually drop off.  Make sure your pillow is perfect (plump enough?) and another way 2 get 2 sleep is 2 read a sweet book before bed, or have a long, relaxing hot bath, but avoid adventure movies and computer games!    But the best of all is 2 just lay there and try!!!!

XSu3dedGaa	R stands for Rest  common sense, really, but a runner in the middle of a race or training session may not heed the symptoms of a less severe injury and just carry on. There may be some excuse, as exercise-induced endorphins can reduce the brains ability to interpret symptoms of injury, though the more experienced you are as a runner, the more intuitive you should be in interpreting these. Continuing to run will force more blood to the site of the injury and maintain bleeding  more severe damage is the inevitable result. If you have no option but to carry on, try to cool the area with water and slow right down  walking is ideal.    I stands for Ice  the application of which should be carefully controlled. Simply putting ice on the site of an injury is going to produce blistering and ice burn, so it should be wrapped in polythene, crushed and further wrapped in a damp tea towel. Time is an important factor. Fifteen minutes should be the upper limit for a single application, but this can be repeated hourly.    You can use ice in other ways during rehabilitation. Firstly, you should reapply it if you feel twinges as you gently stretch out the injury on the subsequent days, and it can also be used as a massage medium which can ease apart scarred, healing tissues while the cooling effect continues to provide capilliary contraction and prevent further bleeding. Ice is the most valuable, yet least used and understood, method of healing sports injuries.    C is for Compression. The greater the pressure applied, the lower the amount of blood that can pass to the rest of the limb. We all apply tissues to an external cut  a bandage or Tubi-grip will have the same effect internally. However, this pressure should be less than your blood pressure  there is little point in stopping the bleeding but cutting off the blood supply to the extremity of a limb. Gangrene can still occur, so you should alternate compression with ice. If the limb goes numb, the bandaging should be released.    E reminds us to Elevate the limb. Blood pressure reduces with height  it is lower in our brain than our toes  so the higher the limb is above the heart, the less force there is within the damaged blood vessel to cause bleeding and worsen the injury. While it may not always be practical to elevate the limb, any time doing so is well spent and will aid recovery.    The RICE method (combined with anti-inflammatory drugs if desired) is the best immediate response to most injuries.|`|z5M8xfhXaa	Try the R.I.C.E method which stands for rest, ice, compression and elevation.|`|DtG4zpM2aa	Yeah, it sounds like you've probably strained the quadriceps muscle which is just above the knee.   What I'd recommend is trying to rest it as much as possible for a couple of days then slowly starting to try to get back to what you'd normally be doing, wearing a tubigrip/some other form of support bandage may also help it to feel more comfortable (though there isn't any evidence for this speeding recovery), and take some painkillers such as ibuprofen or another anti-inflammatory.   If there's swelling, applying an icepack or something from the freezer (bag of frozen veg or whatever) for a few minutes at a time will help to relieve this.       Injuries like this will normally settle down in anywhere between a few days and a couple of weeks...if it's not settling it would be worth getting your doctor to have a look at it.|`|dd15228a42b4652d8768334912349b61aa	OK if it's the muscle above the knee [which means that you haven't damaged anything in the knee itself]  it probably means that you have bruised it, if it was anything else, you wouldn't be able to walk,    So ~ a hot bath, and put Sea salt in the bath, and soak it, it will help the bruise, and "bring it out" this means that because you can't see any dark patch like you would with a normal bruise, it's one that has happened in the muscle deeper in the leg.    Also give it some rest [no disco dancing etc] until you feel comfortable, get take it easy, and after a couple of days or so, it should ease.

If not, maybe you should start reading exrx.net and bodybuilding.com to learn some stuff about nutrition.|`|YQZoGNOYaa	ummm i'm 5'3" and 118 and i am NOT fat. that is a great weight for that height. you should be anywhere from 110-120 so you are fine. if you are exercising and gain weight it is from muscle. chill out.|`|i8EMuPJiaa	It won't work   Trust me   You need a diet that works for you!   You need to eat healthy food and burn lots of calories.   If you eat 1000, burn about 500   This will help you lose weight.   You need to stop snacking, you said you eat when ever you want. Try not to, try to only eat at meal times.   For breakfast have porridge, that makes you less hungry, which means no snacking.   For lunch have a healthy sandwich, maybe with tuna or something that you like.. not to much butter!!!!   For tea (evening meal) have a pasta meal  This is what i do  Trust me this works   I am 5 foot 3 as well and i don't no how much i weigh but it's about 98 or 100 pounds ish  I'm 15   xxxxxxxx|`|ec2ee9613c6bdc3dcad61f9d849d618eaa	First off, 118-130 pounds is normal for your height. It's dangerous to go any lower. The reason you gain weight is because by not eating, you're stopping your metabolism. Therefore, your body will hold onto everything you eat because it believes it is in starvation. This is unhealthy and dangerous. If you do not eat, your body will break down your muscles for nutrients, which in turn will increase the size of your fat cells. You're doing great damage to your metabolism by treating your body this way and trust me, you won't be looking good in the future if you keep treating it this way. Also, starving yourself causes numerous other issues including ammonorea, hair loss, depression, inability to focus, etc, etc... Your body is like a car; it needs "gas" to operate (food). Try eating 5 small meals a day at around 300-400 calories each. Also, try lifting weights for 20-30 minutes 2-3 days per week and do some high intensity cardio 2-3 times per week along with moderate cardio for 50 minutes or so the other days. Be sure to take one or two days to rest.    And I can say with confidence that I am sure you look beautiful as you are and that your current weight is completely perfect for your height!
CuVnpxh3aa	You have a bad cold. Take medication for the fever and cold medication for the cold. Drink lots of cold fluids, it will help bring your temp down. Ice chips will help your sore throat as will Tylenol. You need  a cough medication and get lots of sleep. You will feel better in a few days but the cold may hang on for a week to 10 days.|`|Q8yTJWTXaa	It could be strep throat.  that's how I felt when I had it.  Or it could just be a cold. Maybe you should go to the doctor and find out.|`|1bubNOQmaa	With mono, your glands would be noticeably swollen.  You could have anything from a cold to the flu.  If the fever is just at the start of the other symptoms, it's likely a cold.  If the fever starts several days after the other symptoms or if it persists for several days, it could be the flu or strep throat.
xfpJGBfwaa	Relax and let them diagnose you.  They can't give you meds for something they haven't confirmed is there, that would be illegal and immoral.  Chances are, it will happen in the next 5 days.      Make sure you have an appointment to see the doc in 5 days or whenever this thing needs servicing.  So you can discuss the results ASAP.  Tell them you need the appointment because of the way you feel.      If you get  really suicidal and afraid you might hurt yourself, then check yourself into a hospital.  they'll have you on an EEG full time there.  Probably.  You may have to ask for it.  Make sure you call your doctor and let them know if you check yourself in, so they can order treatments and diagnostic tests.
BNAzjSO1aa	It means that is the amount of oxygen in his blood at the time of the test. Is your friend ill and in hospital?I think   that result  seems to be quite low but it may have been measured buy a different standard than the one I am used to. The doctor who told him the results should have given him some advice about what to do to get the levels up to the normal level. If he has not been given this information I suggest he goes back and ask what the normal range is and what to do to improve his. Can I point out to a previous person who answered a ventilator is normally only used if a person was unable to breathe without help not just for low blood oxygen levels giving him oxygen would be more useful|`|a4kTbjfeaa	Everyone here has been discussing oxygen saturation which should normally be more than 90%. However your friend may be referring to PaO2 or the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood which is a direct measure of oxygen in the blood taken from a sample of arterial blood. The normal level of PaO2 is 60-80 so 67 is right there. I don't think this 67% is referring to oxygen saturation because this would  be a dangerously low level which would require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Your friend should speak to the doctor and find out exactly what this result means in the context of his case.|`|046668252b7d273d3a4a3a6908a8607daa	As others have said, the usual range for oxygen saturation in the blood is 95-100% although 92-94% is acceptable in the aftermath of a respiratory illness. In hospital, most people whose saturation is  consistently below 92% would be on oxygen.    However, such a low level of oxygen in the blood can also be accounted for if your friend has a heart condition. We have kids admitted who have a heart problem and have downright shocking oxygen saturation but this is their norm and throwing oxygen at them doesn't do anything to raise it.|`|ZQfGvUgMaa	Thats really low, is he in the hospital?  It should be 100%. Anything below 80% is pretty much incompatible with life. Are you sure its blood oxygen you are talking about and not something else?|`|V8uvefQDaa	Oxygen Saturation is the amount of oxygen travelling round your body in the blood. Normal is 95% and above. Ideal is 100%    x|`|1c4256f905a272aacbd200f6119e4124aa	It means that there is something wrong with him that it does not allow his red blood cells to carry enough oxygen to his organs. There can be a lot of reasons for this. It may mean his lungs aren't working well.|`|hiBDwkFtaa	its the amount of oxygen in your blood|`|1YaCGJfyaa	It means he/she not doing 2 good....! mine last time they were taken 99%|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I don't know what the percentage means but I hope he is having an investigation and some treatment.  You don't say who told him this so I assume he must have been to the doctor's.  I have a lung disease and I don't have enough oxygen in my blood but I haven't been given a percentage.  Get him to have a look at his finger nails and if they are becoming convex this is a sure sign that he isn't getting enough oxygen to his extremities.|`|5391432c598af97eb451cfd80531a5e3aa	It's the percent of O2 in his blood that's being distributed to his organ systems.  Normal levels would be 92% or greater.  I hope your friend is seeing a physician and will be ok.|`|CNlfn5Wraa	Ideally you want your level at 100%. Most people are okay until they get to 90% and below and then they exhibit symptoms of respiratory distress and need oxygen. If the oxygen is ineffective in bringing up the levels then there is a serious problem and a ventilator is needed to breathe. As someone else said I hope he is in the hospital.|`|b44ceed71244692699d1ef1c43cb6193aa	Wow! the oxygen levels or O2 sats is the amount of oxygen in your blood.  that is really low. Is he on oxygen? is he in the hospital? Normal levels or O2 sats are from 91% to 100%. but people with respiratory problems can have O2 sats that are lower and because their bodies adapt to it they can function pretty well, but 67 is very low and this person really should be on oxygen, if they aren't already.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	That means he is very sick and needs to be in a hospital, if he's not already there.Was he the one that told you? Because at 67% he wouldn't be talking. They'd have done a blood gas by now to confirm the reading and at the very least put him on 100% O2 to get his level up. I have seen, let's just say, hospital emplyees that should know better report that low a reading and it was in error. There are things that can effect the pulse oximetry readings that some pepople don't know about. It should be confirmed by a Respiratory Therapist. be fore any one panics.  Btw, 100% is not the ideal. 97% is normal and for reasons that need not be gone into here, 100% is not normal .
PvQnydw2aa	Write a list of the reasons why you want to stop, and keep them with you. Refer to them when tempted to light up. You may wish to read a separate leaflet in this series called 'Smoking - The Facts'. This gives the reasons why smoking is so harmful and lists the benefits of stopping.    Set a date for stopping, and stop completely. (Some people prefer the idea of cutting down gradually. However, research has shown that if you smoke less cigarettes than usual, you are likely to smoke more of each cigarette, and nicotine levels remain nearly the same. Therefore, it is usually best to stop once and for all from a set date.)    Tell everyone that you are giving up smoking. Friends and family often give support and may help you. Smoking by others in the household makes giving up harder. If appropriate, try to get other household members who smoke, or friends who smoke, to stop smoking at the same time. A 'team' effort may be easier than going it alone.    Get rid of ashtrays, lighters, and all cigarettes.    Be prepared for some withdrawal symptoms. When you stop smoking, you are likely to get symptoms which may include: nausea (feeling sick), headaches, anxiety, irritability, craving, and just feeling awful. These symptoms are caused by the lack of nicotine that your body has been used to. They tend to peak after 12-24 hours, and then gradually ease over 2-4 weeks.    Anticipate a cough. It is normal for a 'smokers cough' to get worse when you stop smoking (as the airways 'come back to life'). Many people say that this makes them feel worse for a while after stopping smoking and makes them tempted to restart smoking. Resist this temptation! The cough usually gradually eases.    Be aware of situations in which you are most likely to want to smoke. In particular, drinking alcohol is often associated with failing in an attempt to stop smoking. You should consider not drinking much alcohol in the first few weeks after stopping smoking. Try changing your routine for the first few weeks. For example, don't go to the pub for a while if that is a tempting place to smoke and drink alcohol. Also, if drinking tea and coffee are difficult times, try drinking mainly fruit juice and plenty of water instead.    Take one day at a time. Mark off each successful day on a calendar. Look at it when you feel tempted to smoke, and tell yourself that you don't want to start all over again.    Be positive. You can tell people that you don't smoke. You will smell better. After a few weeks you should feel better, taste your food more, and cough less. You will have more money. Perhaps put away the money you would have spent on cigarettes for treats.    Food. Some people worry about gaining weight when they give up smoking as the appetite may improve. Anticipate an increase in appetite, and try not to increase fatty or sugary foods as snacks. Try sugar-free gum and fruit instead.    Don't despair if you fail. Examine the reasons why you felt it was more difficult at that particular time. It will make you stronger next time. On average, people who eventually stop smoking have made 3 or 4 previous attempts.    Stop Smoking Clinics are available on the NHS. They have a good success in helping people to stop smoking. Your doctor may refer you to one if you are keen to stop smoking but are finding it difficult to do so.    Various medicines can increase your chance of quitting. These include Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) which comes as gums, sprays, patches, tablets, lozenges, and inhalers. You can buy NRT without a prescription. Also, medicines called bupropion (trade name 'Zyban') and varenicline (trade name 'Champix) can help. These are available on prescription.|`|fen79tTnaa	I quit smoking because i WANTED too. I was tired of smoking, smelling bad, and having my asthma flare up. You really have to want too. But if you want some "practical reasons" then think about the cost. Idk where you live, but I live in NJ and is about 6.50 a pack here. That's ridiculous! Say I smoke 3 packs a week, that's 19.50.. and a month..78 dollars. That's money I could spend on going out.. or paying bills.     But like I said, you need to WANT to quit.     I removed myself from ALL smoking environments. that helped a lot. not being around it.|`|MHHDvBvFaa	I'd agree with all that the big long answer said except the bit about telling everyone.    Only tell your closest people. Don't tell everyone.     What you are trying to achieve is being a normal person who doesn't smoke, who isn't irritated all the time they're in public buildings because they're trying to figure out when and where they can go for a cig.     You're trying to be someone who doesn't find it difficult to walk anywhere because their limbs hurt and they can't breathe properly.     You're trying to increase your own happiness by being able to taste food and smell nice smells.     You're wanting to be pleased because your home doesn't smell dreadful and be glad when you look in the mirror because your skin is bright and its ageing has slowed considerably.    If you want all this, that everyone else who doesn't smoke has, then just be that person. Don't be 'someone who is giving up smoking' by telling everyone that's who you are. Because then that's just who you'll be.    Just do it, for you.|`|eulMjLtPaa	As others have said, as with any addiction, she needs to want to stop.  Everything else is just technique.      Some people (myself included) have success with cold turkey.  The withdrawal is intense but more short-lived.  Some have success with drug therapy, or talk therapy, or group support.      It really depends on your gran.|`|NUCCIFRtaa	http://www.cancer.org/docroot/PED/ped_10...  check there.. i hoped that's useful, because it's a really great decision to stop smoking.. =D

KGf1hUzhaa	A hypodensity image in a CT simply means that the image is not as dense(white-gray) as would be expected.  Everything on a CT is on a continuum from white to black with many shades of gray in between.  Normally on CTs things that are the most dense will appear white (things like bones and teeth).  The less dense an object becomes the farther away it moves from white and the closer to black (air is the quintessential black in a CT).  Essentially what they were saying is that there was an area on your liver that was not as dense as the rest of the liver.
JAKbLgpFaa	OH MY GOD. <br>  <br>  i hide my scale for the entire week before my period. i can't stand it! i've gained as much as 5 pounds before my period....it's the water weight--all bloat. i avoid salty foods and drink as much water as possible (it flushes out the system) but i haven't been able to keep that pms weight off! alwell, it always goes away again.|`|RE6GBw0Baa	yea hunn, i gain around 4lb and i hate it lol.<br>  <br>  i always get depressed when i weigh myself, even though i know its not due to actully putting on weight lol xxxx|`|k6x2lVLYaa	Yeah, I gain like five pounds two weeks before my period, then after it, for only a week, I'm normal.|`|fKH7fVHPaa	yes this is normal it is due to water weight and maybe if your feeling depressed you eat more etc..|`|QQss9ol6aa	Yes, this happens to most females when PMSing! it is mainly just water weight, it's called feeling "bloated" but not to worry it will go aways shortly after you are done!

9WlhD9kxaa	This sounds weird, but I promise it will help your sinus congestion: Boil  some water on the stove until it steams, then put a towel over your head and make a sort of "tent" over the pot of boiling water (but not too close; you don't want to burn yourself!). Just inhale the steam for a few minutes  and your sinuses should clear out a little. I have terrible sinus issues and I do this all the time. Hope you feel better!|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	Are you in the US?  That sounds like Guiafenesin and Sudafed together.   It's prescription or over the counter here, but probably both together in one pill and for longer release and larger dosage would be prescription.  Oh - the Sudafed has to be gotten from the pharmacist because some drug dealers figured out how to make "meth" from sudafed (I think, anyway).  So, when you have a cold - our pharmacist, who I trust very much, says to get sudafed and tylenol (and/or ibuprofen).   There's also "Mucinex" that will help thin your mucus - I think it has that "g" thing in t.  Don't get the DM kind b/c it has dextromorphan in it (the cough stuff) that makes you hyper and cracked out.  Don't take any combination medication that they sell for "colds, coughs, etc" without checking the labels for that DM stuff... not good.  Good luck - drink lots of fluids (non-alcoholic).
5d94V16uaa	Don't sweat it at all.  Not too scary at all, you lie on the table and the machine does everything.  If they ordered contrast for you, you'll have to drink it, it doesn't taste that bad, the worst thing about it is that you have to drink a lot of it and it fills you up fast.  They might also start an iv to inject a second contrast agent into you.  If you never had an iv before, don't worry about that either, it doesn't hurt, it's just a little pinch.<br>  <br>  I have only had them on my abdomen and they took about 15 minutes including the set up time in the ct room.  Yours should take about the same amount of time give or take a few minutes.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you, I hope you are ok.|`|xmlEl9Ksaa	well i had one done for my appendicitis and you have to drink a big vat of gross tasting stuff called contrast. then they injected me with it too and it felt like i was peeing (I wasnt) also like a metallic taste in ur mouth..its not really a big deal dont be scared. i actually found it really relaxing. they put you in this bed then you go under this sphere shaped dome not so ur enclosed it just a thin circle and then fans start going and u move back and forth a few times...then its over..good luck. i know that a Ct scan is a lot of radiation and its not good if ur still developing like me but besides that, i think you'll be fine...hope this helped!!|`|zwvDITr5aa	You drink 5 cups (40oz) of iodine mixture which tastes gross, then an injection of tracer dye (Huge90cc) through an iv and you feel like you're on fire. The scan is painless though.|`|DXJ6Ws8oaa	dont worry, they just make you lay on a table and its over in about 25 mins. just stay still to get the bst results|`|450539d29675dc973b0ec09791ed6c66aa	You have no reason to be scared at all and normally it doesn't take long at all.It is round and has a table that you lie down on and they slide you in just a little ways and do scans,it is very open,a lot better than MRI'S.When my mom had hers to see if she had Alzheimers they just slide the table in till her head was in the rest of her body was out of the CT scan.Just try to stay calm and believe me when I say it is not painful at all it will be just a scan,they may tell you to hold your breath or not to move like when they take xrays and that should be it.Good luck.

4qFvUYfVaa	I am a recovering addict. Same drug same snorting addiction. The spoon you found is for INJECTING with a needle. Unless the white coating was on the underside of the spoon, in which, she used the spoon to crush the pills. If the white coating was on the up side of the spoon, she used this to mix, melt and draw up the dope into the needle to inject it. VERY VERY BAD way to do the dope. Once thats your mode of ingestion, you're kind of stuck with it.|`|HugdaZvBaa	The spoon is used by addicts for heating or cooking heroin, or crack cocaine which is then injected into the body.You will probably find needle puncture marks on her body.Some addicts are very good at concealing the needle marks so they inject themselves under their toe nails or other difficult places.

mhK8opC7aa	My daughter had shin splints and I took her to a sports medicine specialist.  He sent her to a physical therapist who measured her for orthotics.  They are inserts you wear inside your shoes that keep your legs in the proper allignment.  It cleared up the problem.  The only problem she has was finding shoes deep enough to put the inserts in.  They have probably improved them since then.  The best kind are the ones that are specifically made for your feet.
1N73V2Ygaa	Hey!<br>  I'm in middle school too, so I understand how busy things get.<br>  You don't sound overweight, BUT you don't sound skinny either. <br>  Swimming is a good excersize, but it will make the upper half of you look wider. What I do is go for a quick run every day, and then walk home from school (1 mile walk) Start by running 1/2 mile and work up your indurance. It helps in other sports, and b/c you are running, well it doesn't take up much time. <br>  Good luck! :-)|`|XZTmOh1Caa	No, you aren't overweight, but swimming will NOT help you lose fat, because it burns much more glucose.

But that's how I will do it.<br>  Good luck!<br>  :)|`|B06MKPbfaa	just write a note to her saying you got your period and you need pads or tampons|`|BL4OBp0eaa	dont tihnk of it as "breaking" it to your mom, she is probably expecting it. although at first i never told my mom im comfortable enough now to ask her to buy me tampons .. but im still really uncomfortable talking about it!|`|HzUM8hVSaa	i would just say i got my period ill need pads or tampons can u get them for me whren i need them?|`|UriE3wN6aa	moms are almost always understanding about that, dont worry just take her into your room and tell her|`|GTAbs48Eaa	just tell her, rofl my mom was actually excited she was like my little girl is growing up..i couldn't stop laughing|`|7e4580c39089e9616fbf69fee3559743aa	I never officially told my mother I'd started even though I'm not shy and I knew she'd be fine about it. It just wasn't something I wanted to share with her. She only found out I could reproduce years later when I got pregnant, so there you go!<br>  <br>  There's no rule saying you have to tell her if you don't want to, but if you need her help or need money to buy supplies, then obviously you're going to have to. Thinking about it now, I don't know why I was so reluctant to share the details of my new-found womanhood with my mother; I guess I just wanted to go it alone and save myself the embarrassment of having to talk about my changing body, because it IS embarrassing when you're young, no matter who you are. <br>  <br>  If I could go back now and tell her, I think I'd approach it in a totally casual way. I'd pretend I wasn't dying of humiliation inside and make out that I thought it a perfectly normal thing to be talking about:<br>  <br>  'Oh by the way, I started.' *Widen eyes significantly and let her work it out* <br>  <br>  There's no way I'd have been able to say the word 'period' to her. So that's how I would do it if I were you. Chances are she'll be even more embarrassed than you are, become incredibly efficient in an attempt to cover it up and race to the store to buy you some pads.|`|kGcJmNWKaa	Well, you have to remember it is natural, when you tell your mom she's not gonna go off on a tangent about your period, she may talk with you about it but that's probably it, she's not going to get mad or anything. But you will need pads, or tampons which ever you prefer to begin with so she'll have to buy them. Good luck, it hopefully won't be too bad.|`|sbeoF50gaa	Just be thankful it's not ur dad! My mom was raised by my grandpa and he was really abusive and VERY uncomfortable talking about sex and puberty and all that stuff. My grams said she never saw him naked! So that MUST have been hard for my mom and my aunt. I couldn't imagine asking my dad to go buy me tampons. I'm really shy too, and I hate asking my hubby to go to the store to buy me some (I'm 24 and still can't do it on my own :x) But it's a girl thing, all girls get them and your mom should be understanding, if she's not u have a weird mom, and I"ll loan you my hubby lol|`|bx8qWPuGaa	aww.<br>  i feel bad.<br>  but so will your mom.<br>  just tell her.<br>  trust me, be like:<br>  <br>  Mom I need help.<br>  I got my period.<br>  <br>  She'll know what to do.<br>  After all, she has one, or you would be heree to be asking her would you?|`|jqzbenG7aa	i remember when i got mine,i went to the bathroom to pee and when i went to wipe i had blood on the tp so i went to my moms room and simply said "mom im bleeding" and she didnt yell or anything.she|`|tv7a1ixiaa	Just tell her, she should understand as she has one herself.|`|D7RVdQjFaa	just tell her.
WX7pUlepaa	hemopysis-is the expectoration (coughing up) of blood or of blood-stained sputum from the bronchi, larynx, trachea, or lungs (e.g. in tuberculosis or other respiratory infections).<br>  <br>  It is not the same as hematemesis, which refers to vomiting up blood.<br>  <br>  Coughing up blood is not the same as bleeding from the mouth, throat, or gastrointestinal tract.<br>  <br>  Blood that comes up with a cough often looks bubbly because it is mixed with air and mucus. It is usually bright red, although it may be rust-colored. Sometimes the mucus may only contain streaks of blood.<br>  <br>  <br>  A number of conditions, diseases, and medical tests may make you cough up blood.<br>  <br>  Diseases and conditions may include:<br>  <br>  Blood clot in the lung<br>  Bronchiectasis<br>  Bronchitis<br>  Cancer<br>  Cystic fibrosis<br>  Goodpasture's syndrome<br>  Inflammation of the blood vessels in the lung (vasculitis)<br>  Inhaling blood into the lungs (pulmonary aspiration)<br>  Irritation of the throat from violent coughing<br>  Nosebleed that drips blood down into the lungs<br>  Laryngitis<br>  Pneumonia<br>  Pulmonary edema<br>  Systemic lupus erythematosus<br>  Tuberculosis<br>  Diagnostic tests that can make you cough up blood include:<br>  <br>  Bronchoscopy<br>  Laryngoscopy<br>  Lung biopsy<br>  Mediastinoscopy<br>  Spirometry<br>  Tonsillectomy<br>  Upper airway biopsy<br>  <br>  <br>  If you have any unexplained coughing up of blood, call an ambulance or go to the nearest emergency department.

Ozu3yDMFaa	No. Celexa will not intensify the xanax, I'm on both, and it's not a dangerous combo. I take xanax on an as needed basis. But you shouldn't start taking the Celexa again without consulting your doctor. Celexa is usually started at a small dose and graduated up to your appropriate maintenance dosage. You should consult your doctor about the xanax also. I am afraid of becoming addicted to xanax myself and probably am to some degree. As with myself, I think an addiction would only make your condition(whatever reason you take xanax for) more pronounced and harder to bare.|`|450539d29675dc973b0ec09791ed6c66aa	It is a very dangerous combination,the only way you should ever mix the two is if your doctor tells you too and how much.Ask your doctor about raising the xanax a little.Celexa is a stimulant and xanax is to calm you,they would be fighting against each other..I used to take xanex xr(extended relief) 1 pill every morning and it would work great till about 3-4 in the afternoon and then it started wearing off it was a 3mg pill.I told the doctor about this after being on it for about 3 yrs and he took me off the extended relief pill and put me on 1mg 3 times a day and that works great and most times I only have to take 2 a day.If yours is extended relief talk to you doctor about changing it to regular xanax and see if that doesn't work better.Good luck.|`|Lj0xwPmraa	I don't think you'll get a "Xanax boost", if that's what you're asking. :P <br>  <br>  Antidepressants and benzos react differently. <br>  <br>  since you have been on SSRI's before, I'd bet you know it takes weeks for an SSRI to reach it's full effect. <br>  <br>  And with Xanax, it's an immediate "relief".

UOZP4Ma5aa	No it wont hurt, its done fast, the braces dont hurt either
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	I actually think you are very normal and probably still in high school.  When you are still in school, the least little bad or embarrassing thing can make you the unwanted center of attention.  No one wants to be noticed for the wrong reasons.  If you only knew the truth, most of your classmates probably feel the same way and as you get older, you will build your self-confidence and not worry so much about these little things.  If you think you are really becoming obsessed with any of this, you could talk to your parents about getting some counseling, but I think you will outgrow it.<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|CBfGXLvKaa	Hugs! Sounds like you may be in middle or high school. My friends and I ised to do the same things. Your hormones are changing that could have some play. If it becomes very distracting I would see a Dr or school counselor.|`|mMGQCGMsaa	I think you are just self-conscious which is normal for a teenager.  I use to feel like this in highschool.  You will gain more self-confidence as you get older, and will not worry so much about what other people think.  If you feel really overly anxious, your doctor can give you a medication to help with anxiety; but, I think you are normal.  I don't think there is anything wrong with you at all.|`|BIyiOgPYaa	Not really, you may have an anxiety disorder. Tell your parents to take you to a psychiatric unit to get tested.|`|LCMCrmQTaa	no it sounds pretty OCD

UWxXJS18aa	You need to have the infection treated.<br>  <br>  More importantly, if there is any foreign matter (gravel, wood, metal, etc) in the wound, it will never heal, will become very serious.<br>  <br>  You need to seek professional medical help.  You might want to start with the school nurse if one is available.|`|CtgBMZewaa	That is an infection, and neosporin MUST be applied at LEAST twice a day in order for it to work.  If you have pus and a brown ring, scur the neosporin.  You have an infection, and, no joke, i am NOT lying, if it worsens, you could have to get your leg amputated (cut off).  It would spread and infect your whole leg.  The only way to heal it-tell your parents, and GO TO THE DOC ASAP IF YOU WANT YOUR LEG.<br>  <br>  Edit:  No offense, but the person above me is an idio...  PUS IS NOTTTTT FINE ON AN INFECTION.  YOU CAN GOOGLE IT!|`|WMbUEesxaa	its never gonna heal it scare forever jk lol|`|x0ShcnTbaa	scrapes tend to take a while to heal your going to have a lot of skin growing back depending on how deep the cut is. if it itches then its healing. DO NOT pick the scab that will make much longer to heal and will leave a scar. just keep putting neosporin on it and keep it clean. put a band aid on it every once in a while too. you'll be okay. hope this helps<br>  everything that's happening is normal so dont worry|`|lsO9Dr09aa	Well you have an infection, that's for sure.<br>  Go to the doctor to get antibiotics. Go soon, if the infection spreads you may need your leg cut off. But that's if it gets really bad. Go soon and you should be fine.|`|6S7sWuLfaa	its fine, pus is healthy. put a band aid and have you're mom kiss it.
Awywcn2Caa	could be pink eye. It is really easy to catch! A tell tell sign of it for me is a gritty feeling, like I have a piece of sand or something in my eye that I can't get out. Wash your hands a lot! everything you touch you are leaving it on that surface. You could have gotten it from something as simple as touching a cart at the grocery store that someone with pinkeye touched. The dr.can prescribe some drops that will make it go away. Good Luck!|`|iB22RWkGaa	I don't think it's pink eye... I had it before, and my eye was extremely watery, red, and there was a ton of that white gunk that builds up in the corner of your eye. There was so much that when I woke up in the morning I couldn't open my eye. And it didn't hurt, it was itchy.|`|NvOro0igaa	ok, you can have pink eye, but you can also have Iritis. I waited too long to go to the dr for Iritis and my vision has detoriated in that eye every year since.<br>  CALL YOUR DR NOW. Please!
wJbaTS0Aaa	You get anemia when you lack healthy red blood cells, either due to pregnancy or low iron level in the blood. There are hundreds of types of anemia, so it's difficult to classify all of them. But some of the symptoms are fatigue, dizziness, fainting, shortness of breath, irregular heart beat, and others.|`|dHcP602caa	It pretty much means you aren't getting enough iron.<br>  <br>  Or:<br>  <br>  "Anemia is a condition that develops when your blood lacks enough healthy red blood cells. These cells are the main transporters of oxygen to organs. If red blood cells are also deficient in hemoglobin, then your body isn't getting enough iron. Symptoms of anemia -- like fatigue -- occur because organs aren't getting enough oxygen."|`|nOezzy5caa	it just means that the person has a lack of iron in their blood so they get dizzy easily|`|LaCj6C8Raa	Anemia is a deficiency of hemoglobin, which is a molecule inside RBCs (red blood cells).  There are gestational kinds (pregnancy-related), iron deficient kinds, "pernicious" anemia (which is actually a deficiency of Vitamin B12, but it gets thrown in with the anemias anyways), and lots of other types.
TU4aBIhxaa	First of all, as much as I can tell you love your friends, you can not carry their burdens for them. You can try to comfort them and encourage them to do what's right, but taking it upon yourself to feel like that is not the answer. A boy that I saw as my "unbiological" brother shot himself back in 2005. I cried for what felt like forever, but I accepted it and eventually healed. You have to allow yourself to heal and remind yourself that your friend wasn't thinking clearly at the time, and it was no one's fault but her's for making that choice.<br>  <br>  Life is extremely hard, and you have to know that you aren't alone. I've known some people in my time who have had it absolutely horrible (deaths left and right, living with another relative because both their parents are messed up), but they hang on for the chance that things CAN be made better. You have to try. If there is a loved one (parent, grandparent) that you trust, PLEASE alert them. If you ever feel like you're just about to take that leap for suicide and have no one else, call an emergency hotline (you can find plenty of numbers on the internet or sometimes in a phone book). There are people on the other side who, even if they don't know who you are, care about your life and want to see that you make it through.<br>  <br>  In regards to your grades, I have two answers. One, you need to study more- OR two- you're like me and have clinical depression in which case it makes it practically impossible to focus for more than a few seconds because you feel motivated to do nothing. You need to see help for this.<br>  <br>  Since you can't afford a therapist, see a school counselor for help. They'll direct you on what to do.<br>  <br>  I can promise you this- cutting is not the answer. It NEVER is. Although the temporary pain distracts from the emotional pain, once the pain is gone, you're left with the same problems you started with. Finding help is always the best solution and can offer a more PERMANENT solution. Whether or not you realize it, there are people who love you and will be hurt just as badly by your actions as you were by your friend.<br>  <br>  God bless you, and please don't hurt yourself!|`|AeGsY5O4aa	I know this might be a cheesy answer but maybe you should start going to church....<br>  things that they say there is really hopeful and might help you out|`|NduWhJItaa	Aww I feel for you...There is always hope, when things get real bad take hour by hour and min by min if you need to.  There are chat rooms that you can go to, to talk to people in the same situation as yourself,<br>  www.prohealth chat rooms   its a great sight I got alot out of it very supportive people going through the same issues.<br>  <br>  There is light at the end of the tunnel, if you cant afford to see a therapist try and get some vitamans muti b's would be a great start.<br>  <br>  Take care will be thinking of you and remember you are not alone in this|`|RPd66ldYaa	I know i may get a thumbs down for this answer but it's ok. It's the TRUTH and it is what saved my life. If you are desperate and on the verge of giving up - or if you just want true peace and relief from everything that is going on. You only need to know one word: JESUS. Pray just ONE time and ask for help and you will receive it. If you're not willing to talk to anyone in real life about it - that's ok because they probably don't have the answers or solutions anyway. Please trust me and just do this one thing. It literally saved my life. Take care ok and don't give up. You seem like a smart person and it's good you've posted on here for help.|`|xLO5VRYTaa	You can talk to me about stuff- I got some bad shi* going on too- I know how you feel- I got so much pressure from school to get papers done but Im worried as hell cuz my dad might be going to jail- that means we'll lose our house and everything :( I feel the same way about talking to people in real life about my problems. seriously feel free to talk 2 me|`|tKFO3u60aa	heyy,<br>  you sound like you have way too much to deal with, especially since you're so young and impressionable. some people will tell you to find God, and for some people it works. However, you need to work on positive ways of letting out your unhappiness. try journaling, writing poetry, or drawing. i know it is extremely hard to talk to anyone, but if a psychiatrist/psychologist really isn't available--i believe there are some community ones who work for free? then talk to a school counselor, or general doctor. he/she might be able to prescribe you some anti-depressants to help get your brain chemicals back to normal. it probably doesn't feel like you are being you, but remember, you are there, hidden inside, waiting for the opportune moment. you need help. the more professional, the better. forget internet docs and cheap feel good tactics. it's good that you remember how happy you used to be; don't lose hold of that. You will probably need some kind of antidepressant, and soon. first, put yourself first. do not sacrifice your happiness for the well being of others, especially now. you are all you have and you need to protect yourself but stay open to the world. sorry this is long. good luck:) i hope things turn around soon!
iUPBio66aa	Sometimes people dont understand what you are going thru. Me i have had these problems. Me mine comes from my past I was raped as a child by a family member, homeless when my mom got on drugs, beat by my mate. But I had to give my troubles to God. I dont kno how religious you are. I'm not a saint but I do Honor my Lord. Parents are not the best people to talk to sometimes, Talk to a close friend. Sometimes it is easier to talk to strangers because they dont know you personally so they cant judge you or alter their opinions to fit what they think you should hear. I think the best thing you have done so far was write your feelings on here. I'm not a counselor but take time and do some fun things, do some new things. Get out and socialize. My little boy is irritated very easily he like people to leave him alone. Sometimes you would think he have the weight od the world on his shoulders and its at those times I realize he needs my attention. I try and let him do stuff to get his mind off things, Sometimes we wrestle or just get out the house and play and after that he is back to normal. Also tell your parents how you feel tell them you dont feel like are listening. Tell them to hear your cry. Hope this helps :-)|`|qGh1HhPwaa	I'll bet your diet is your problem<br>  Too much sugar at the wrong times|`|urxsjDMKaa	my best friend just was diagnosed and i think that you should talk to someone like a guidance councilor because its not something to joke around with. and see if she can maybe talk to your parents into getting you to see a psychiatrist. But talking to someone other then your parents might be a big start. But exercises creates endorphins that make you happy, so it might not hurt to try running too! that would help especially if you do have depression.|`|8QIGBzaOaa	I completely understand where you are coming from. Whenever I try to tell my parents that I think I am depressed, they tell me how much harder their childhoods were, and then tell me to stop being and attention-seeking drama queen. Direct quote. My best advice is to set aside a time every day to worry about everything. Say, 4 pm is worry time. If at any time throughout your day you feel stressed or overwhelmed, stop yourself, step back, and say to yourself 'no, I will think about this at 4/I already worried about that.' If you really can't get the ideas out of your head, think 'Is there anything I can do about this situation right now?' If the answer is yes, do it! If not, then just accept that it is unchangeable, and obsessing over it is just torturing yourself. Also, though it may sound cheesy, appreciate the little things. The different textures or colors of everyday objects, the feeling of taking a deep breath. There are a thousand little ways to calm yourself down. As for telling your parents, just tell them about your view of your life, and tell them exactly what you want to have change. If they don't listen, then try on your own. In two years, you'll be on your own, may as well be ready.
JS2QJfdMaa	it sounds like you have a good chance of having strep. if you get a fever it is probably definite.  but eiher way you should go see a doctor so they can take a throat culture becasue if you don't get it taken care of while you first get it, then it is just going to get worse and worse.  it can end up becoming something more dangerous, so it is best to just go to your doctor. better safe than sorry. hope you feel better =)|`|adqaiwBmaa	Strep throat is a bacterial infection in the throat and the tonsils. The throat gets irritated and inflamed, causing a sudden, severe sore throat.<br>  <br>  The most common symptoms of strep throat are: <br>  <br>  A sudden, severe sore throat. <br>  Pain when you swallow. <br>  Fever over 101F. <br>  Swollen tonsils and lymph nodes. <br>  White or yellow spots on the back of a bright red throat. <br>  You may also have a headache and belly pain. Less common symptoms are a red skin rash, vomiting, not feeling hungry, and body aches.<br>  <br>  Strep throat will go away in 3 to 7 days with or without treatment. Doctors usually treat strep throat with antibiotics even though they may not make you well faster. Antibiotics shorten the time you are able to spread the disease to others (are contagious) and lower the risk of spreading the infection to other parts of your body.|`|2djVdpnKaa	Possibly, if you get a fever, it's probably strep.|`|Awywcn2Caa	Probably, go to the dr. the can do a fast simple test and see.

That is why the world has gone on for hundreds of years. It is not however ok to have one just because you want one. Can you support yourself and a child?

Do you plan to get married to this boyfriend so that your child has two parents to provide for it, love it and take care of it ?

sbeoF50gaa	you answered your own question...
H6rPxpHWaa	?Drink plenty of water. Staying well hydrated can help your condition improve, because the "waste management" control system in your body requires a lot of water to do its job. Without enough water, the body has difficulty removing some waste products efficiently. <br>  ?Look for face washes which contain the active ingredient benzoyl peroxide. This is the key ingredient in some of the best face washes. use a 5-10% benzoyl peroxide of mild to moderate acne and 10% for severe. <br>  ?Try smashing one tablet of aspirin in a small bowl, then adding lemon juice to the mixture. Aspirin is acetesalicylic acid, chemically related to salicylic acid. Apply to the affected areas overnight. It boosts the healing process while reducing redness. <br>  ?Try putting toothpaste (paste, NOT gel) on your face, cover it with a bandage, and keep it on all night. When you wash it off in the morning your acne will look better. The astringent and surfactant nature of the toothpaste will help diminish the appearance of pimples. But the toothpaste has been known to burn sensitive skin of the face, so be careful. If your face does burn, stop acne treatments and work on healing your burn. <br>  ?Another way to zap pimples is shaving cream. Apply it to your pimple and it will dry it up. It disappears by morning, but wash your face after waking up. <br>  ?If nothing is working for you, drink four tablespoons of apple cider vinegar diluted with water daily. It works very well for some people and is worth a try. Another good solution is aloe Vera gel fresh from the plant, taken orally.|`|0ixo6bkdaa	Try using Differin, drink a lot of water, and wash your face 2 times a day {dont wash it too much ot too little, 2 times is perfect}|`|WzusAmjYaa	wash your face gently everynight with a face cleaner|`|0502f99266db2b733545ca1f8f7b6571aa	Drink a LOT of water, and I know it's embarrassing but I recently got proactiv.

6SN2LnmYaa	Hi. Im 20 years old and started when I was 14. I used pads at first and I felt like I was wearing a diaper all day and sometimes you could hear it when you walk around which can be kind of embarrassing. So I honestly would stay away from pads.<br>  <br>  I started using tampons and fell in love with them. You have to change them more times a day than you would a pad but they are so much more comfortable and you can't even tell they are there. The only thing you would have to worry about with tampons is TSS (Toxic Shock Syndrome) It's very unlikely that you will get it. The main cause of getting TSS is from not changing your tampon regularly. But if you want to know more about it then you could google it and get all the information you need. If you do start with tampons, I would suggest wearing a panty liner (a very small pad) with it until you get used to your cycle and know how often you need to change. That way you dont bleed through. Hope this was helpful and good luck!!|`|iQaKNSI6aa	Well, it might take a while before you get it, or it might come right away. Periods come between the ages of 12 and 16. I recommend pads because tampons are uncomfortable until you get used to your period, or if you have sex. The only problem with pads is that it feels like your sitting around in your blood and it feel gross. Tampons feel weird too and don't stick it in too much and don't leave it for too long because you are going to get a disease. Its called TSS, Toxis Shock Syndrom.  I recommend to not leave it in for more then 5 or 6 hours and wear a pantie liner under just to make sure that you don't leak. You can keep the pads in as long as you want. Hope I helped and good luck. XOXO. I had my period for a while now so trust me, and don't worry its not as bad as everyone sais it is. lol|`|AGlpdpAKaa	It really depends on your body and how heavy your period is.  i've always had very light periods, so when i use a tampon it soaks up the moisture in my vaj and gets stuck!! the first time i used one i found it very difficult to get out.  (and painful) i've used them since and had no problems, but i just don't bleed heavy enough to need one.  i prefer pads.  but they can give you diaper rash, believe it or not! *L*  i could barely sit when i first started getting my period, my skin would get SO irritated by the pad!  personally i've never had a problem not being able to swim for a few days each month *L*  if you're a swimmer, then tampons would be fine every now and then, just make sure to tuck the string INTO your bathing suit *L*|`|9irbd8esaa	well i started mine a few months ago and i don't like to use tampons because they aren't very comfortable<br>  people say tampons aren't as noticeable as pads and that is true <br>  but it is always best to wear a pad even while you wear a tampon because there is a chance of leakage|`|TC6Fmugcaa	i just started in november and i turned 15 this month. don't stress about it. you should start with pads. they give you good coverage you need especially if you start at school. its a lot easier to put a pad in than a tampon if your new.. but its your choice|`|GTAbs48Eaa	tampons have chemicals and could cause you body unable to have children so try to use those as least as possible. pads are a better way to go unless of course water in involved|`|GSsIqaGCaa	Tampons for sure! Definitely a lot more comfortable. Good luck|`|AS8VyrVgaa	pads. <br>  i'm always afraid tampons will get stuck up in my vag lol.|`|xCifmFfkaa	I personally prefer tampons because once inserted properly, the worry is pretty much gone of having a 'leak' or an 'accident' (you'll better understand once you first start getting it). With pads, I found that I was constantly conscious of myself, worrying if I needed a change or if the pad hadn't 'leaked,' causing a stain on my pants, etc.<br>  <br>  Having used both I'd definitely say that a tampon gives you more protection than a pad. Another reason I didn't like a pad was, well... the way it kind of felt like wearing a diaper stuck to my underpants.<br>  <br>  However you'll be able to use a pad right away even with no experience, using a tampon takes getting to know your body and getting used to it.<br>  <br>  Just relax, and when the time comes, I'm sure your mom will have the best advice for you!|`|bXFHOvn9aa	i'm 12 i haven't started mine but my friends have so here is what they recommended to me  it's not fun but usually u will ge discharge a few moths before your period. would start wearing pads to school when u think your about to start just to be on the safe side. i would wait till u get a little older to wear tampons because u put your self at risk of TSS it happens to girls usually that are younger only use them when u have heavy flow and or when swimming<br>  GOOD LUCK|`|Wxzb4o4Zaa	tampons cos there more comfortable once u get the hang of them. with pads you feel like your wearing a diaper. and tampons make it feel like ur not even on it at all! just remember to not wear a tampon for over 8 hours and where pads to bed! very important!|`|aCLqYRtEaa	i agree... although tampons are good fo sports also, but use pads when you can but they are pretty uncomfortable and feel like a diaper and tampons you can't feel at all after the first couple times:) have fun hahaha it sucks!|`|CBfGXLvKaa	I would say in thestart use a pad. Tampons can be difficult.|`|B06MKPbfaa	well pads don't exialy fee like a diaper to me there is some that are more comfortable than others depends on the brand you use but if you wear the pad  to long it gets uncomfortable <br>  tampons you can swim with them i htick your sopsed to change it after you swim you can't leave it in to long cause you can get toxic shock and  if you sleep pads are beattr.ive  tampons can be  diffcult to put in <br>  thats why i don't use them i m afrid it will hurt|`|BL4OBp0eaa	i prefer tampons. but pads when you go to sleep, or you have a heavy flow. trust me, you are lucky that you dont have it yet. its not fun. lol|`|yONMnNKAaa	start with a pad and then ltr on if you feel your ready then go on to tampons....|`|66KUgS24aa	use a diva cup they are awesome :]<br>   go here~    menstrualcups.org

nnBAnBOlaa	The RID kills the lice.  The application 7 days later kills the ones that have hatched from the eggs that were already laid.<br>  <br>  "Nymph Stage: Once the louse hatches, it is called a nymph and is barely visible to the naked eye. The nymph cannot reproduce because it is not fully developed. After about 12 days, it becomes an adult."<br>  <br>  Using the shampoo sooner has no significant effect on the infestation.  It just exposes the person to more chemicals.|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	the problem with lice is the eggs, as more lice hatch, they lay more eggs and the eggs are harder to kill than the live ones crawling around. they key is to kill the live ones to get the production of eggs to stop, and then smother or poison the existing eggs to keep them from hatching and starting the cycle all over....|`|3TdT5mG2aa	Lice shampoo will NOT get rid of everything. Go to your doctor, as embarrassing as it is, and they will prescribe something for you.  You must then do the treatments and remove all bugs and eggs out of your hair. Wash EVERYTHING, socks, clothes, sheets, blankets, and turn the dryer on high heat.  Vacuum the couches and beds. They do not "die" they can produce 7+ eggs for one woman bug. If you do not do as I tell you, you will suffer greatly and the bugs will stay.|`|l5jJk5DIaa	you should just follow the directions on the lice shampoo you bought.<br>  and i am not sure how long they live, but you should try to be on the safe side and wash everything, bedding, ect. Also throw out your hair brush and buy a new one. the lice do not get a resistance to the lice shampoo, but you should still wash all the things your hair comes in contact with. hope this helps<br>  <br>  :)
7Ux2aNQOaa	i think only a few hours, maybe hes doing it just to be safe|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	24 hours.|`|mfJ7LDgxaa	It depends on how much you drank. It is just like the breathalizer idea. One drink takes one hour to metabolize. When it is metabolized it is clear from your system. <br>  <br>  A standard drink is equal to 13.7 grams (0.6 ounces) of pure alcohol or<br>  <br>  12-ounces of beer.<br>  8-ounces of malt liquor.<br>  5-ounces of wine.<br>  1.5-ounces or a “shot” of 80-proof distilled spirits or liquor (e.g., gin, rum, vodka, or whiskey).|`|dxYgLvEBaa	Are you kidding me?

DMQgIWa0aa	I'm sure if you keep talking about it he will tell you whats it about..<br>  <br>  Im suprised he has said anything to you, most guys having any problems down below dont like to tell anyone so he must really trust you.<br>  <br>  If you want to know more just keep talking about it, he wont mind as he was the one that told you!<br>  <br>  But whatever the problem is im sure its not so bad, circumsision is always the last resort its very doutful he would have it, as theres many smaller ops which can correct whatever the problem is.<br>  <br>  No big deal :)|`|QBUypAmAaa	Circumcision should be his last option. More than likely he has phimosis, which is where the foreskin doesn't retract past the head easily, but it can be cured easily without a circumcision. All he has to do is some stretching exercises in order to overcome it, using steroidal creams topically applied to the foreskin with stretching can help a lot. Sometimes stretching isn't enough though, but still a circumcision can be avoided and should be, because that's the loss of a lot. 20000 highly specialized nerve endings and it's the most sensual part of a man's penis, besides it keeps the head of the penis moist and sensitive and clean except the smegma so washing is a must. But if he has to have surgery, then he should opt for a preputioplasty which is where they make a slit in the foreskin to loosen it, then sew it back together and he loses none of his foreskin in the process. <br>  Now if his problem is a frenulum breve then all they have to do is a frenuloplasty which is where they just make an incision in the frenulum extending it, and he still loses none of his foreskin. So all it comes down to is that circumcision really shouldn't be an option for him. He'll be better off keeping his foreskin.<br>  The only way a circumcision should even be applicable is if the foreskin is so tight he can't urinate at all, other than that there's no need for one.<br>  <br>  -KH|`|CNW6eAjoaa	It might be because he has a tight foreskin.  Tell him to avoid surgery at all costs.  There are many things he can do before he should ever consider that option.<br>  If it is a tight foreskin, have him follow the directions for stretching, in the links below.  This should have been suggested by his doctor first.<br>  If he does these stretches routinely, he will see results in about two weeks with full and easy retraction in 3-4 months.  Then, he is set for life.<br>  He can also ask his doctor for steroid cream that is made just for this purpose.  If the doctor is still insisting on circumcision, or some other knife surgery, then he should find a new doctor.<br>  Anything that involves cutting any part of his foreskin should be avoided. It is the last thing he needs.  He is probably not being told all the facts of what he will loose.  You can also send him to  www.norm.org to read about the reason and function of the foreskin.<br>  There is also a "lost list" on that site that will spell out what is lost if he allows a doctor to cut him.<br>  good luck with this|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Don't know, but hope it's not a tight foreskin. There are many other options available before circumcision which should be a last chance. You should ask him, and advise him of the alternative treatments before he has to go through with it: <a href="http://circresearch.googlepages.com/tightforeskin" rel="nofollow">http://circresearch.googlepages.com/tigh...</a><br>  <br>  Could be something else though, but I'm not sure what.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|02UeNiisaa	if he isn't circumcised that is  probably the most likely. other cases could be things dealing with his urethra.

SEXCHANGE. the dirty little tranny|`|Nq4FWEIcaa	If he himself said the word "circumcision" then I think that is what it might be.  There is a chance he may also have cancer of the penis or he may have a birth defect in regards to his penis.  I myself was born with 2 urethral openings at the tip of my penis and I'm finally getting an operation done to make the two holes in to one.  You should have asked him what the procedure was.  You would be showing concern for his situation and who knows, maybe he needs someone to lean on and share his concerns.  I would ask him and if he tells you, then you know he trusts you and he would probably appreciate your concern.|`|TsjqzanQaa	It could be a problem resulting from circumcision.<br>  <br>  Male genital mutilation, called circumcision has many adverse effects and complications.<br>  <br>  It can cause skin bridges, adhesions, tight and painful erections, sexual dysfunction, catastrophic infection, gangrene and even death.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of problems that can happen with the penis, women also have a lot of problems with their genitals and reproductive system, also.<br>  <br>  Circumcsion, incidentally, is NEVER necessary or desirable, as it always damages the penis and sexual sensitivity.<br>  <br>  It is an artificial mutilation of the penis, and there are always other treatments for a problem with the foreskin.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|FI916ISFaa	He probably has phimosis.  There are a number of treatments short of surgery and a number of surgical options less than circumcision available to him as well.
dBPCT41kaa	I hope so..I feel the same every time too. I actually have to hold my breath for a second cuz it hurts so bad. So to me its normal. But im not sure if its actuallyyyy normal. U could be putting them in at the wrong angle.|`|xCifmFfkaa	Given what you said, I would guess that the reason you're feeling pressure is because the tampon wasn't inside of your body for long enough (didn't absorb enough blood) ...esentially, parts of the tampon could have still been dry/causing friction and that's what caused the discomfort.<br>  <br>  If you're going to be replacing them every two hours, I would switch to a Junior/Light or a Regular tampon, and this should solve the problem. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AGlpdpAKaa	It's not normal.  it's hurting because they are sticking to the walls of your vagina.  the same thing happened to me the first time i used one.  you need to leave it in longer so it gets soaked iwth blood, or use a smaller one (only use super on days where you're bleeding profusely!!) pick up some regular or even light ones and see if it helps.  but dont' keep doing it if it hurts!  you could cause serious damage to your vagina.|`|8Jaxpop4aa	Maybe you should use regular ones....I use super and I feel a little pressure when pulling it out sometimes but thats normal.|`|xhz1kWroaa	You might need to go a little smaller, like regular fit.

8jKvUJISaa	Hey!  Cellulite  is more than likely genetic  and you are right, exercise does very little to help, but there are a few things you can do.

TD5Wqe4maa	Acne is caused by the hair follicles becoming clogged with dead skin and sebum and the red bump comes from the infection that those clogged up cells caused. Those are the plain old red bumps. The black heads, on the other hand, aren't caused by an infection and aren't even considered an infection. They are just pores clogged up with dried up sebum. Sebum is the oil that your skin naturally produces to protect itself. <br>  <br>  There are a few studies that link acne to food, but the vast majority of scientists disagree with acne having anything to do with food. <br>  <br>  While having enough sleep everyday is most definitely beneficial for your body, there is no evidence showing it has anything to do with acne. <br>  <br>  Drinking lots of water is without a doubt great for the skin. It gives your skin that extra moisture to make it look great. It is always recommended to treat your body like a luxurious palace at all times. Always strive for good health habits. <br>  <br>  You are most likely a teenager, so your body is producing a lot of Sebum which in conjunction with dead skin cells make acne more common in people like you. Your best bet is to get a Cleanser and moisturizer and wash your face twice a day- morning and night. Other than that you have to play the wait game until better treatments become available to us ordinary folk.<br>  <br>  Best of luck I have suffered acne and still do, so I know how much it sucks.|`|GlFtb2MLaa	Several of things cause acne - stress, bacteria, hormones...<br>  Getting a good amount of sleep (about 8 hours) and drinking as much water as you can is beneficial to your health.  Your diet should include plenty of water, fruits, and veggies.  Not only does this make your skin look better, but it can also improve your hair and nails.|`|7aVPODR8aa	There's a big difference between acne and the occasional pimple or zit. Acne is a skin disease that can really only be helped with a visit to the dermatologist where he/she will put you on an antibiotic to kill the disease. Some reseachers believe acne is genetic, but truth be told no one really knows why we get it. Occasional pimples can come from sweat, too much face washing (only twice a day max!), dry skin, and stress.|`|HdXy9Ppvaa	what you drink can determine that in most cases. it depends on the ingredients that are in the drink and whether or not you are allergic. no, it does not have anything to do with the amount of sleep you get, but stress is a main factor in acne. also, it has to do with the bacteria and dirt that are trapped in your pores. also, it's because of hormones. as you get into you teens, your hormones go crazy and your body produces more oil than is needed. the oil mostly goes to your face because dirt, bacteria, and oil fats collect there. wash your face twice a day and get the clean and clear kit. it helps to control and make disappear all those things.            GOOD LUCK!!!!
NaFqCjfoaa	I've had horrible issues with acne over the last 4 to 5 years of my life.. and the care for it has to do with every-day life.<br>  <br>  Use a good treatment.. I recently started using Skin-ID and it's been honestly a god-send. Neutrogena has a plethora of products that are very effective.<br>  <br>  You need a nice healthy dose of salicylic acid treatment (To peel away at the top layer of the skin and deteriorate the zit) and a benzoyl peroxide cream (To hydrate the skin and destroy the environment where acne blooms).<br>  <br>  Use make-up that doesn't irritate the pores, don't touch the face with hands at all to prevent transmission of oils and bacteria.<br>  Maintain a routine, and follow it strictly.<br>  <br>  Also use some On-the-spot treatment for those nasty zits that stand out. And again, NEVER pick your face.. because the irritation can magnify the problem.<br>  <br>  Be sure to not over-wash. 2 times a day is fine.. and anything more than that will throw off the natural balance of oils on the skin and will cause a counter-attack with a massive increase of oil production to balance the mess out.. and it's not something you want to happen.<br>  <br>  Be sure to have your daughter stay healthy by exercise. It'll revamp her body, making it stronger and infection-resistant.<br>  <br>  REGARDLESS what other people said here, Food does not have ANY proven link to acne, but a healthy diet is always a plus. It maintains the metabolism and the vitamins and minerals that are extracted from a rounded diet fuel the immune system as well as everything else to keep the body running smoothly. Also, if your daughter has over-active sebaceous (Oil) glands, there are medications to slow them down.<br>  <br>  And as always, there is always the last resort of Accutane. It's very serious stuff and has MANY side-effects, but it very effective in treating serious acne.<br>  <br>  Also.. you should research in natural treatments.. such made of foods and other things that create effective topical medications.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|uvX31eDJaa	Personally I suffered from acne myself. I have found that Probiotics (the good bacteria) and a healthy, organic diet helps tremendously. <br>  <br>  I am currently taking AccuFlora Probiotics purchased at Walgreens. It helps to strengthen the immune system and clean the digestive system.<br>  Usually someone , like myself, who has taken antibiotics will only cause damage to their digestive system because antibiotics not only eliminate the "bad" bacteria, but the "good" as well.<br>   <br>  Read about it. It's all true.<br>  <br>  As for a healthy diet, I am proof that sugar, caffeine and high fat foods will show on your face. I blame it on my sluggish digestion, but we've already gone over that.<br>  <br>  Another thing I recommend is washing the face with gentle cleansers. Nothing abrasive. The problem most likely lies within. Start there and make sure she doesn't over wash. It's almost best to treat her face as though it were already acne free. Don't cause more damage.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. :)|`|6S7sWuLfaa	dermatologists know nothing about acne.

Just wear it for 15 minutes a day. Then double the wearing time every three days. Then, when you are up to wearing it for 3 hours for 3 days in a row, then start wearing it overnight. You need to wear benzoyl everyday in order for it to work and not just "on the spot" but all over. It prevents the acne from forming in the first place.<br>  <br>  That will help her acne alot, but it usually takes more than that to get clear. <br>  <br>  I would love to help her with her skin problems.

They just unclog all your pores and it hardly hurts. Also, you should know that too many very strong products can just make your face worse. I used proactive everyday and my face got worse. From personal experience I would use strong products every day or so. Try a vanishing creme-overnight stuff. In the past I have used.

Theres this one cream i got from my docotor, erythromygen (sorry not sure how its spelled) you have to get a prescription from your doctor to get it. It really helps, you have to keep in in the fridge and then twice a day, once in the morning and once at night aply it and it really helps.<br>  <br>  Another thing that might help you is stridex. There pads that you can rub your face with, i used that and it also helped clear me.<br>  <br>  One more thing im going to recomend is the Black head eraser...yes it really really really helps remove your blackheads!!!! And it also gives yours skin a smoothe feeling.<br>  <br>  My friend also said that SkinID helped her....so maybe try that...www.skinid.com<br>  <br>  Yes this sounds like a commercial, lol, but all of these things really helped me.<br>  Hope I helped you !!!
7iZzm3owaa	The general rule is that, once you have become sexually active, you should get a pelvic exam once a year every year after that, even if you haven't been active in a while. This is because any sexual activity can potentially introduce the HPV virus to your body, and once that virus enters the body, it's important to check on a yearly basis to be sure that you are free of cervical cancer. <br>  <br>  So yes, you should go get a checkup. It's highly unlikely that it will hurt, unless you are particularly sensitive.

You are here for a reason and purpose.If you believe in God and what Christ did 4 you and for everyone,you have a purpose!!!So you are not worthless.You are sensitive to others,and the sadness in the world.Keep praying,and ask for direction.Maybe you are supposed to open a homeless shelter or something?

No Dr. knows everything, even in their specialty.<br>  <br>  Especially as you are still in pain, there is someone out there who might be able to help you.

7iZzm3owaa	Well, love isn't necessary to our survival, but I think it's what gives meaning to our lives and allows us to not just survive, but to thrive. <br>  <br>  C. S. Lewis made the following statement: "Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art...It has no survival value; rather, it is one of those things that give value to survival." I think this quote really sums up the human experience with love. Can we live without it? Sure. Is life gonna be very good without it? Not a chance.|`|NReVTAPSaa	Love yourself first and what will be will be. <br>  Relationships are overrated, and they are hard work, I should know I am married.<br>  Sometimes it is easier to be alone but it is also nice to share things with someone.|`|2YdpqmQ7aa	Yeah your missing out, be social and keep your head high.|`|kCUT14ggaa	Sucks to be you man ...<br>  love is something amazing !|`|yuAtJ7Weaa	Yes, love is needed in life.<br>  that love is the love for YOURSELF. if you have that, you are fine.|`|Bxj8ty2xaa	Well, if you have tried it and did not get any appeal from love then i guess your just not a sexual-interactions loving person. My advise, get a little more social, get a girlfriend, and then decide for yourself if you are missing out on what life's all about.<br>  <br>  We cant make decisions for you! I can only hope that you take heed in what the people who answered your questions (and not the ones trying to dictate your life!) say and try it out :D

I'd experiment to see how many sets you can do<br>  <br>  one other good exercise is to skip rope. brilliant invention<br>  just skip till your tired<br>  <br>  sit ups I would do only if you are doing cardio<br>  you could do a million sit ups a day but if you are fat, they will not show <br>  <br>  remember eat well and exercise<br>  <br>  good luck|`|kbGOMwi7aa	You're 14 and posting here?|`|NpTPZ175aa	As for the exercise issue, fitness DVDs are great.

Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~

That should stop the thoughts from working well enough to form in your head anything coherent.. and then you'll be out in no-time!  Don't drink caffeine past NOON.  Go exercise daily.

heziH5K4aa	I used to do something similar to this. It started because I was putting on more weight than I wanted and so I decided to run 5 miles a day but only eat about 500 calories a day (like some spinach an apple and a couple pieces of bread with tuna or beans), so I would starve most of the time and then lose control and start eating a whole bunch (example a giant king sized candy bar). I lost about 25 pounds of muscle and fat in 2 months (and I wasn't even overweight to start). I am healthy now, but it took a lot of time to get back to normal eating patterns. It is natural for your body to signal you to overeat when you starve yourself-its a defense mechanism. It actually took a few months for me to really get all the hunger/full signals back to normal. The best thing for you to do is to try to stop starving yourself and eat normal, but it will take a few months for the binge urge to go away, sorry to say.|`|urxsjDMKaa	it is bulimia and anerxia. and you should get help 105 is not fat at all!!!! <br>  you will be so much happyer when you get help.|`|J3UmD1zCaa	I don't think its bulimia since your not making yourself throw up but you definitely have a eating disorder and you need to get yourself help.

I know their seems like no hope as of the moment, but you gotta look ahead. Your almost 15, in 3 years you can get away from it all.  I don't know if you have a religion, but this is what gives me hope.  People are sinful, and people's love can never truly satisfy anyone. God has genuine love, and wants to make your life better. God provided a way, through Jesus, to set us free. I'm not trying to preach a sermon to you, but honestly- this is what could help you.  He died as a sacrifice for sin, by accepting it, there is no longer a wall between you and God. You are free to go to heaven, and live life wayy better.  He is waiting on you to make the move, to accept his forgiveness, and confess your sins. In the pits of sin, and life for that matter, God is the one who picks you up. Listen to some flyleaf songs, it portrays how God has totally took the lead singer out of misery.  Even if you don't believe, and God is a joke, it wouldn't hurt to try. I know where your at man, and it took a long time for me to fully accept God. But now that I have, life is better. Your life isn't worthless, God has a plan for it. Just try to look past whats going on now, and focus on your future. If you have a trusted family member you could stay with for now, maybe you should try that. I pray that God will make this all better for you.|`|7w3Lry7saa	Don't kill yourself. Things get better for those who wait.

5d94V16uaa	Hi there, everyone's favorite wise-*** party gal here.  I've had to take meds too, I am still on one and it helped me live normally/helps me live normally.  Don't worry too much if you have to take these meds for a long time, especially if they have really helped you out.  Lots of people take them, probably way more than anyone thinks.<br>  <br>  They are generally pretty safe, although the long term effects aren't 100% known, all indications to this point is that prolonged use is not detrimental.  And with how fast this field is advancing and all the research I'm betting there will be better and safer drugs available in the future.<br>  <br>  You know how bad depression can make you feel and interfere with your daily life, so stay with the medication if it takes care of that.  It sure beats the hell out of the alternative.  AnyWho....  best of luck to you dude, I hope you are well.|`|NduWhJItaa	They say that when they take you off your anti depressents for the first time if you need to go back on them again quite quickly that it is possible you might need them for life.

I sincerely hope you feel better soon.|`|ouzrDPaSaa	Prozac shouldnt take 3/4 months to work fully.  It may be that there were other factors in your life that improved your depression.<br>  <br>  Lots of people do have to be on anti-depressants long term if they have severe and/or recurring depression.  Its unlikely you'd be on Prozac for the rest of your life though.  People's bodies can become tolerant to anti-depresants if they take it for a long time so they will have to switch to another drug.<br>  <br>  Ideally you should recieve therapy to help you develop ways of coping so that one day you can manage with the help of drugs.<br>  <br>  If you want to educate yourself on anti-depressants, including Prozac this is a good link <a href="http://www.mind.org.uk/Information/Booklets/Making+sense/Making+sense+of+antidepressants.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mind.org.uk/Information/Bookl...</a><br>  <br>  Take care.|`|KKCMIE04aa	Did the medication help you ?

OXB8EpDQaa	you shouldent be working your abs every day. You need to give them a break. And if you have any fat covering them, you have to get rid of that also. But you cant do this doing crunches and other ab excersises, this will only work the muscle under the fat. To get rid of the fat you need to do cardio. Cardio can be any thing from running to swimming.<br>  <br>  Your week should look something like this:<br>  Monday: Abs + Cardio<br>  Tuesday: Cardio<br>  Wednesday: Abs + Cardio<br>  Thursday: Cardio<br>  Friday: Abs + Cardio<br>  Saturday: Cardio<br>  Sunday: Break from both<br>  <br>  Make sure to eat healthy and around 4 to 6 times a day.

aJp3BbWcaa	Prevention is always the goal with kidney failure. Chronic disease such as hypertension and diabetes are devastating because of the damage that they can do to kidneys and other organs. Lifelong diligence is important in keeping blood sugar and blood pressure within normal limits. Specific treatments are dependent upon the underlying diseases.<br>  <br>  Once kidney failure is present, the goal is to prevent further deterioration of renal function. If ignored, the kidneys will progress to complete failure, but if underlying illnesses are addressed and treated aggressively, kidney function can be preserved, though not always improved.|`|PogMq7Pcaa	OMG SHES GONNA DIE! lol|`|RhPNV1ohaa	food poisoning or a UTI Uninary Tract Infection that traveled up from her bladder to her kedneys are the likely causes.  <br>  <br>  Since she is aware and working will the doctors she should not die.  She may have to take dialisis to purify her blood on a regular basis and she may be able to have a kedney transplant if she completely looses her kedneys.<br>  <br>  I'll pray God just heals her kedneys.

c9Cz7cayaa	I had Bunion surgery in 2003 and had screws put in.  Doc told me they probably sould stay in but if they started to bother me then we would remove them.  After the initial 18 months of healing and discomfort, I now have very LITTLE trouble with my foot and the surgery area.  The screws have not bothered me at all!<br>  <br>  Time will tell.  I was VERY worried about the screws and all, staying in for the rest of my life.  I worried about the airport metal detectors too!  But that was all silly worrying because I have had no problems with the screws.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you sweetie!<br>  <br>  also - try Arnica homeopathic for pain swelling and bruising and quicker healing.  Available at the health food store.|`|9u4MQWHNaa	No; the reason to remove them is all in your mind.  You know this.|`|JAR0e43uaa	Doctor didn't tell u that keeping them may making a new fructure!!!<br>  Doctor didn't tell u that at very cold weather they will hurt u becuse them metal will go soooooo cold in ur ankles and whatever u do to worm it u will still have pain??<br>  Doctor didn't tell u that they have DISADVANTIGES by keeping them??<br>  Doctor don't know anything called BIOMECHANICAL pasis.<br>  Its not u should ask about peoples opinion...no u Should take them away.<br>  About scar don't worry iys ur ankle and its not visiable for many people...and about infections tell the OTHER doctor who will make the surgery to move them away and he will know what to do...<br>  I wish health for u and tell me what happened with u later if u want to tell me  : gloriousgarden2002@yahoo.com|`|mhK8opC7aa	This is weird that I saw this.  I have a broken ankle right now.  and I also had a plate and 9 screws put in!   I am on antibiotics right now for the stitches possibly being infected.  It has been 7 weeks since my surgery and 8 wks since I broke my ankle.  I was in a temporary cast for a week before the surgery.  I wasn't sure if the stitches were infected or if it's just all red around them from the boot pressing against them.  Isn't it just awful  ???   I never knew breaking your ankle was so bad.  <br>  As far as the broken screws, I hadn't heard about that.  I would say leave them in. Do you think that is what is causing the infection around the incision?   If the dr. says it can do damage to take them out then I would go with that and leave them in.  Did you ask him if there was any way they could hurt you once they break off?  <br>  I would like to hear how it's going for you.  <br>  I am supposed to start walking on the boot with one crutch tomorrow.  I think it's going to be hard to do.  I haven't been able to put any pressure on it until now.  My foot and ankle are still very swollen and the stitches aren't healed yet.  The dr. just said well, sometimes it takes a little longer.  He doesn't seem to care, so I don't know if it is normal for it to take this long to get better. <br>  Good luck to you.  Maybe you could get a second opinion from another dr.  How long did it take for you to recover and start walking again?|`|i1LSk5wqaa	Leave em'|`|DdLtmwwLaa	It would be my recommendation that if the screws are not causing the lack of mobility in the ankle then it would be best to leave them in for all the reasons that the surgeon laid out for you. The only reasons I think its best to get the screws out would be if the screws were rubbing on structures in your ankle and causing a lot of pain or if the screws were causing immobility in the ankle which would be a long term problem. I hope that helps.|`|CtgBMZewaa	I dont know-thats your desicion.  If I were you, I wouldnt have got "screwed" in the first place.  ;)|`|TLNQZ63baa	I'd seek a second opinion on the pros and cons removing the hardware.

0gONjiSzaa	Depression is a serious condition that can be exacerbated by things like family stress. Often, the onset of depression comes when the patient reaches puberty, so your boyfriend is well within the age range for depression. Instead of trying to force him off of medication that can potentially greatly help him, you should consider trying to be there for him  when he needs to talk, or try helping him through particularly hard times.<br>  <br>  Also, no, I don't believe there are any negative long-term effects of citalopram.|`|6Apou72oaa	Actually, you seem to be pretty uninformed about depression.  He probably is depressed because of issues with his family, and depression can also be genetic.  I am on citalopram, and it has very few side effects and contraindications compared with many other anti-depressants.  It may be helpful for your boyfriend to seek counselling to work through some of the family issues he is dealing with.  Andy you should be glad that your boyfriend is aware that he is depressed and has sought help.  A lot of men try to tough it out on their own because to admit to being depressed would feel like admitting to personal weakness and failure.  Try to be more supportive and understand what your boyfriend is going through.
pa7hVLAHaa	This could mean there is some obstruction (polyps, mucus, inflammation, etc) of the maxillary, frontal and ethmoid sinus cavities.  <br>  <br>  Do you have chronic rhinitis?|`|msNXomjTaa	I'm no expert, but it sounds like a fancy way of saying a stuffed up nose, basically, stuff in the sinuses enough to show up in the image.|`|WX7pUlepaa	The frontal sinus is a sinus cavity located above the eyebrow, in the forehead.  The ethmoid sinus is a system of small air cells located between the nose and the eye.  Both cavities are generally air filled, and drain mucus into the nose.<br>  <br>  The Maxillary Sinuses are located beneath the cheeks, above the teeth and on either sides of the nose. The Maxillary Sinuses drain into the nose through a hole located about half way up the side of the sinus wall. If the Maxillary Sinuses become blocked they fill up with liquid that often gets infected (Sinusitis). This could cause toothache or a dull aching pain under your cheeks.<br>  <br>  and an opacification pretty much means cloudy or to be opaque.<br>  <br>  and you can actually get maxillary sinus cancer, its true<br>  <br>  hope this helped

That may cause you not to sleep efficiently; as a result, you get so tired, you don't even know if you sleep or stay awake...<br>  <br>  Another reason, you may not be getting enough oxygen into your brain. Seriously! Make sure you sleep in a well ventilated room, ALWAYS sleep with a humidifier on, and get plenty of walks outside.<br>  <br>  I hope you feel better!|`|CtgBMZewaa	You just probably didn't get to EOG, or rolling eye stage (deep sleep, when you dream).

VtqdeSQ8aa	People naturally have different metabolisms and genetic factors. Also, who knows what anyone does in private: binging, purging, compulsive exercise.|`|4zQEvzCsaa	(I hate them too, and I also hated the guys at school who did better than I did even when they NEVER STUDIED A DAMN THING!!!) It's got a lot to do with metabolic rate which speeds up the digestion process so there isn't enough time for it to be taken and stored as fat. Skinny ***** has a much faster metabolic rate than the other, 'bigger' girl, although 140lbs is OK if she's not 5'0. Either that or skinny ***** is throwing up behind your back! If bigger girl wants a faster metabolism, get her to drink a cup of green tea as soon as she wakes each day!|`|xJBJn6dOaa	Have any guy friends who eat constantly, and eat the junkiest foods.. but are skinny as can be? Some girls are the same way... they can eat all they want and not gain a pound. It's a high metabolism, and some have slower metabolisms, which make it very easy to gain weight. As people grow older, metabolism slows down (for everyone), and eventually these girls will put on weight, if they continue eating junk and not exercising. Trust me|`|4onT0qUxaa	It's all about metabolism, honey. Some people just use up calories more efficiently than others, due to heredity, body style, muscle to fat ratio, alot of different factors contribute. Don't preoccupy yourself with things you can't change and advantages others might have over you in the weight-control department. That's the fastest way to misery. Just be happy with who you are and if you have to exercise a little more to keep your weight down, just be grateful for the health benefits and move on.|`|CT8pwhM5aa	One word: metabolism.|`|wy5SiCS2aa	it's all genetics. My brother in law eats and eats and eats and never gains a pound. This is what he ate when we went out to a buffet the other day:<br>  3 heaping plates of food, PLUS<br>  a chocolate chip cookie<br>  a piece of chocolate cake<br>  a piece of fudge<br>  a piece of blueberry pie<br>  ice cream<br>  and some pudding<br>  <br>  <br>  He's 120 pounds soaking wet. I ate a plate of fruit a plate of salad and a baked fish. I gained two pounds this week<br>  <br>  IT'S NOT FAIR. but that's how it goes. Some people are just born with good genes I guess.<br>  <br>  What's even more annoying is these skinny bitches moan "OH I'm SO fat" makes me wanna slap them silly|`|FNeCDm3raa	Unless you are with someone 24/7, you do not know what they are eating or how much. The skinner girl might eat smaller portions than the other one. She might take more steps in her day than the other one, thus burns more calories.<br>  <br>  And for the record, most thin people do exercise. That's WHY they are thin.<br>  <br>  Anyone can be at a good weight, so stop hating others and takr some notes.|`|ZY6svhldaa	Some people just naturally have a higher metabolism than others. Most people that I know, though, are thin because they work out on a daily basis. Even doing 50 situps a day can keep somebody in shape|`|YL5ziuTRaa	some have high metaoblisms|`|7C6pTKwraa	It depends what u eat|`|TFdkMFfWaa	well it all depends on the person's metabolism. There body can take in certain things and burn them off easily, while others take a lot of exercising to burn off. So although I also hate skinny bitches, they didn't make themselves like that.

0oRSnsrwaa	Your risk is relatively low.  If you know your cholesterol levels (total & hdl), I could do a quick calculation of your ten year risk of coronary heart disease for you...<br>  <br>  A couple clarifications, though...sudden cardiac arrest is often due to factors other than heart disease...electrolyte imbalance, electrical disturbance, etc., so I think what you're asking is what your risk is for a cardiac event...like a heart attack.<br>  <br>  Secondly, it's not really correct to say that "most doctors can't even recognize heart attack risks in women."  Women's symptoms may present differently, but they may not.  This isn't really a reflection of doctor's abilities, it's just a fact of nature--heart attacks in women can present differently.|`|c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	You are correct that the premonitory symptoms preceding a cardiovascular event are quite different in women and in men.  This is rather 'old news' so I would hope that all physicians would be aware of this.  A cardiovascular risk assessment is based upon data from Framingham, Massachusetts.  More than 60 years ago the residents of Framingham agreed to be evaluated and followed.  The Framingham data is not only the best it is the only accurate information regarding cardiovascular risk assessment available in the US.  Such data banks of information are commonly available in other countries but Americans regard this as an intrusion of privacy.  I feel quite the opposite that if we could establish a national data bank of information of various diseases we would able to better diagnosis and evaluate treatment options.  You should be able to find the Framingham point system on the internet although I am able to answer your question.  With matters of the heart a family history refers to '1st degree' relatives only meaning father / mother / sister / brother and the cardiovascular event must have been 'premature' meaning younger than 55 for a male or younger than 65 for a female.  The only risk factor that you may have is family history.  This would place you at a very low risk of cardiovascular events.  I wish you the very best of health.|`|I3L88RDXaa	After reading that let me say this........RELAX! I wouldn't say your at disk of sudden cardiac arrest but you have increased chances as you get older of developing a cardiac history and you may be at risk of having strokes, again later in life. To try and reduce the risk I would say start eating healthy, try and exercise a little (try playing with your kids in a park or something and make it fun.) If the chest pain is sharp in nature in is in a particular spot in the chest then try not to worry about that one too much as it could be pluretic chest pain. As for your blood pressure everyone isgoingg to say it is low but ignore them as that might be your normal as you are small
oenwiCepaa	I doubt it very much I think you may be swollen.  I had a hard stomach after two years of sit ups.
I3L88RDXaa	Basically Your one healthy person. Take the fact tthat all the tests have come back clear theres little chance that at 22 your gonna have a heart attack. What you are doing is working your self in to a panic attack you need to stop worrying. Ask your self why you are so worried? Everytime you have a panic attack your putting your self in a world of hurt. The numbness in the arm is due to you low carbon dioixed level in your blood which controls your breathing.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is when you feel like this is sit down and relax and control your breathing until you feel better.|`|AA11693263	All of what you are describing are all signs of a panic attack. You have to calm yourself down so you can get your breathing back to normal. A lot of the physical feelings you are having is because you are probably hyperventilating. Take some slow, calming deep breaths and regulate your breathing. If you have someone you can call to come over or just talk to until you are through this then it will help. If not, concentrate on something else besides freaking yourself out. I have this too and I do all of this and it really works. You have to tell yourself that your doctor's have already tested you for heart problems and that you are fine. I hope this helps you and if you continue to have these symptoms then you should talk to you doctor again and see if you can get a prescription for an anti anxiety medication.|`|NvwVmiaZaa	you might still be growing, the heart does weird stuff when the body is still growing, or if you've been working out or hard lately.

Your brain cells will hit a totally different object, and everything will be messed up, thus also felling very uncomfortable and spicy.<br>  Always chew gum after braces gets removed, recommended by dentists.<br>  Make sure you brush them every night, proper brushing is essential for cleaning teeth and gums effectively. Brushing removes plaque from the surfaces of your teeth, and if you do not brush plaque develops into unhealthy calculus. my guess is that your friend was useing rugalur brushing habits, in which cace causes problems when you have braces.|`|TrvFnYnmaa	I've tried many products in the past and they pretty much all sucked! <br>  <br>  But I actually found one a few months ago and i'm actually getting amazing results.

rpnFxnCQaa	Gina,<br>  <br>  I know how you feel. I had anxiety attacks too. Thinking of thinking. Thinking too much.<br>  For me, that was when I had to speak in public. Or when there would be more than a few people around me in the same room. It was something that started when I was a teenager and that lasted over years and subsequently affected my career until not so long ago. <br>  <br>  At some point, I was prescribed medicine but I wanted to avoid that because of side effects. That's when I discovered a program that literally pulled me out of that "hole". It is a 100% natural method. The main key here is that you should no longer fear the thought of anxiety. You have to get out of/break that loop. Not only did that cure me - you become your true self again - but I was also extremely surprised to even discover newly built self-confidence.<br>  <br>  There is always a solution! Get out of the anxiety loop!<br>  <br>  All the best|`|NduWhJItaa	Yes there are meds for this I took risperdal and it was great it took all my bad thoughts away, I keep thinking I was dying, I was on them for 3 months and I know longer need them now.<br>  <br>  Still on anti-depressents but no longer have anxiety there is help out there for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Im on effexor as well been on them just over a year  3rd time lucky<br>  <br>  All the best|`|AA11348638	I know you don't want to hear this but........you need to start resisting these urges, nothing bad will happen if you don't react to the impulses...if you find it too difficult, seek help until you can put this behind you.|`|ONXFrA15aa	anti-depressants or a counselor might help with that. that stuff isn't only for depression. or talk to your doctor and see if there's something else that could help|`|7eNT1wl0aa	if you go see a mental health specialist they will probly put you on ridlein which is another name for rat poison.

Then don't eat past 7 pm... but drink water or some juices or milk is ok.  Lots of people get sick in the winter time and end up being tired all the time because of the constant illnesses.  Maybe you need to improve your diet and see the doctor about what you might be sick with - and they can test your blood for deficiencies.

jlQHB9dvaa	You can dress however you like because the doctor will have you undress and get into a gown anyway.  He will check your vital signs, listen to your heart and abdomen, check your circulation, and probably get some blood and a urine sample.  (Unless your labwork was done already.)<br>  Also, he will probably ask if you have any last minute questions for him.  If you do, write them down tonight so that you don't forget.<br>  Good luck to you and get well soon.|`|4LeHbW2raa	The protocols followed by physicians differs from place to place so i can't tell you exactly what will happen but i hope this gives you a general idea.<br>  <br>  A pre operative physical exam is like a routine check up which is done to check your fitness for surgery. First the doctor asks the patient about the current problem and takes a short and relevant history. Then they look for any other complaints or diseases you might be suffering from eg diabetes, heart disease etc because this might lead to complications during surgery. <br>  <br>  After the history taking comes the examination . Here the major systems of your body - abdominal, respiratory,cardiovascular and nervous - are examined by the doctor. If you have no other complaints or diseases this will be a cursory examination . Based on your medical history the doctor may decide to examine a particular system eg if you have heart disease he will spend more time on cardiovascular examination.<br>  <br>  Then some investigations and tests are then done to decide your fitness for surgery. These vary but generally they ask for a CBC (complete blood count) , RBS (random blood sugar), Serum creatinine , Blood urea , haemoglobin, ECG and chest x ray. They may ask you to undergo specific tests for your condition<br>  <br>  All this is standard procedure.Nothing to be particularly worried about. Do be perfectly honest with your doctor . If you are suffering from any other disease/allergies be sure to mention it. And consult your doctor if you have any questions. <br>  <br>  After all this is over the doctor can finally come to a conclusion as to whether you are fit for surgery.|`|ziVtTtObaa	They will ask you questions concerning your past health history. What medicines you are taking. Allergies. Depending on your age they will draw a CBC, Chemistry, do a chest xray and an EKG.  Good luck!
inH6jIrhaa	Wow! you have lots on your plate but there is one thing I see that is really good here. You know whats going on and can identify your feelings. I know many people that cry all day and can't admit something is wrong. You know something is out of place or not right and now you can easily fix it. You get an appointment with a psychiatrist and they can fix you up no problem. Just be patient, it may take a few different meds and a few tries to get it right but you have the hardest part done. And don't be ashamed or feel bad because so many people have depression. It is an illness just like epilepsy or diabetes.

The neosporin will kill any infections, and it is natural for new scabs to give off a little bit of white fluid. It'll be all good.|`|jlQHB9dvaa	You're scared of what?  Its a scraped knee, not a broken leg.  The neosporin will leave a coating of "goo" on it, besides it will ooze a bit while its scabbing over.<br>  You'll live.  Chill.|`|4HIKZsH2aa	you'll be fine. everyone scrapes their knee. if yellow pus starts coming out of it then you might have a little infection. no big deal though. seriously, dont stress out about it.|`|aSdUzlIiaa	Ur scared please???????????????|`|frUYhmuYaa	all just part of a large scab, the brown is probably dirt from the crash inside the pus filled scab. paranoid about super germs so i only use peroxide on large cuts. almost the exact thing happened to me while i was in Charleston riding my Cannandale. the front wheel had gotten stuck in a track by the dockyards, and was the most painful crash i was in, including getting hit by a car. anyway, the scrape was about 2 inch and oozing blood. i just put soap and water on it at a nearby tourist center bathroom, rode 9 miles back to my hotel, and just poured some peroxide on it. the scab was ****ing nasty. JUST KEEP POURING PEROXIDE ON IT UNTIL THE SCAB STARTS TO CLOSE. oh wait don't keep actually pouring bottles of peroxide on it, just a little every couple of hours also a good idea to keep a large band aid on the affected area.|`|MXOIG9ijaa	hey, don't worry that's happened to me many times. What I did to help me heal quickly was keeping it clean and then sometimes putting on some medicine like you are doing and a nice clean bandaid. Just be sure to not let any bacteria or dirt get into it and I'm sure you'll be as good as new in a few days.|`|Td0Hfx5Waa	Ok. I think you'll be all right. Infections hurt, but they're usually not fatal. You should only be worried if you get a fever, then you should go see a doctor. <br>  I'm no expert, but I'd say you have an anxiety problem, worried too much. So am I, I freak out over little things too. ^^ Feel better soon, k?|`|PFBqE0lfaa	Just keep a band-aid on and occasionaly take it off to give the cut air maybe even put peroxide on the cut and don't let gunk get into it and just a reference don't ride your bike that fast anymore j.k.|`|NnFuz3yXaa	That is ok, relax!  You may take a tablet of Vitamin C to make your wound heal faster.|`|Qxpza56paa	might be an infection but you'll live.
mQwyWWHtaa	My dad is 6'8'' and he's 39. He told me that he stopped growing around when he turned 20, so you might still be going through puberty and you may stop now. It really depends on what your body does, no one can really predict how tall you will get.|`|7n523JW1aa	I'm 6'10" I hate it but being your parents are average height I have a feeling you've almost reached your max. height.|`|ejAidBp9aa	How tall are your parents?<br>  6' 9" is giant already dude|`|v5YBydCGaa	Your tall enough!!!
KMDbQXgfaa	You'll probably feel some soreness. It might hurt a little...but it should start to get better. Just takes a little time to get used to it. And after doing it for a little while, you'll probably just start to feel it getting tighter, without as much soreness. <br>  <br>  <br>  Best Wishes...and it'll be well worth it! :)|`|GYnFmrLbaa	It probabley will.<br>  It just takes some time to get use to.<br>  Exspecially if you just got them today.|`|Aj7P7dZ2aa	Well for a few days it will hurt- you know that traditional "getting used to it" feeling. However, after a little while (a few days, a week, etc.) your jaw will get used to the feeling and you won't feel it anymore. Unfortunalty, they will always be annoying-- there's nothing you can do about it. In my opinion, they're worse than braces, because so much food gets stuck in it, plus you mouth feels cramped with such large pieces of metal. But trust me, you have it easy-- I had to have my palate expander in (top and bottom) at the same time as having braces. Oh yes, I got teased. <br>  <br>  Anyways it will feel so so so annoying in your mouth, you'll want to rip it out, or take revenge on you doctor, but soon it will be painless, and at least it's not as obvious as braces!

961e1fe88a95f0b9b8011e95c339a287aa	The radiation from one CT scan isn't likely to be causing the problem, now if you have had several scans in a small amount of time, then maybe. Since you are only 15, you are still young enough to have irregular menstrual cycles. When young women start puberty, it can take a few years to develop a regular cycle. If your period doesn't come in another month or so or you develop pain, call the doctor. There could be some underlying factors there, but seeing as you are so young it isn't uncommon to experience irregular periods.|`|BYQ9tWypaa	Hi!  The radiation levels that you would obtain from a CT scan is not enough to harm you.  If you had several in a short amount of time, maybe, but not likely.  You should still go see your doc.  Periods are not something to mess with, as I have found out the hard way!! We are meant to have periods as women, there is no need to disrupt the nature of our bodies.  That is why I'm not a fan of the Depo Provera birth control shot.  The main side effect of it is no periods.<br>  Hope it helps!!<br>  T-|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Your question says your had a period on Feb. 8, which was just 11 days ago, so you aren't due to have another one until sometime in March.  <br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|jLo14Xj2aa	mine did that too. ur period is trying to get on track. i had mine the first one on dec 9 the second feb 1 and the third one march 20. very confusing but now i get it like normal. so just give it a few months. your body has to regulate it self
CtgBMZewaa	Lol...  you did not injure your spine... you can't that way.  It's a muscle jam or pull, just ice 15 min every hr, and take some ibuprofen to relieve swelling and pain.|`|aiwYCKmfaa	totally normal! i get dat every once n a while cause im a bad sleeper lol|`|9ANvPC33aa	put your pillow out in the sun for 4-5 hours. and then sleep with it. your neck will be much much better. its normal, you just had a bad positioning of your neck while sleeping.|`|rgQ3UCUnaa	its probably a neck slash..<br>  its like you probably moved your neck too fast..<br>  give it a week and see what happens..it happened to my friend..
RXI8ImdIaa	We can't test your blood. You need to be working with a doctor on this. <br>  <br>  In general, if you are anemic the beds of your nails will be pale rather than pink, the inside of your mouth  may appear pale, and the conjuctiva (the pouch inside your lower eyelid) will be pale. Normally all those areas should be a nice pink color, but if they look white that's a possible sign of anemia.<br>  <br>  That is not a substitute for blood testing.|`|7GrncwiYaa	There is a catch 22 on iron and B12 -You need iron to absorb B12 and viceversa. Both, when in short supply, can cause your symptoms. When you take on iron supplement, it is good to take a ferrous sulfate one, take it 30 min.before a meal with orange juice or a drink that is high in Vit. C as this helps with absorption.  I have been told to use B12 dots that dissolve under the tongue as they are absorbed but the B12 that is swallowed is not. Both anemia and B12 deficiency are quite serious if not under control and should be treated with the advice of a doctor so they can be monitored for improvement. Best wishes and good luck.|`|6S7sWuLfaa	just take iron supplements. its very common for vegetarians especially since with our depleted soil, iron rich greens aren't so iron rich anymore.|`|CIJIacN3aa	l agree with scorpior... <br>  It could be a number of thing. It could be Anemic, it also could be a deficiency of vitamin B12. <br>  You really should go and see you doc.|`|tLrJhDfKaa	You should try Tomato Soup.  This will raise your white blood cell count.
CtgBMZewaa	Yes-morphemes in the brain are addicted to it-just like drugs.  Actually, chocolate IS a drug (not harmful, just fattening and addicting).  It is proven and tested that the medicine used on heroine addicts also treats chocolate addiction.  It blocks the receptors in the brain, and makes people crave chocolate - less.|`|T8CR3u02aa	Yeah, chocolate has caffine. Alot of people can get very addicted to it. I never realized how hooked I was until I got pregnant and had to cut out of my diet. I was going to starbucks mon thru fri at least once a day.|`|mCEKMWTYaa	Definitely yes!  When you think about all the people you know, picture something that each of them does all the time. Of course we all know about the smoking, drinking, drugs, caffeine and other common ones but there are so many others too!  There are addictions to cell phones, computers, eating sweets or salty foods, shopping, cleaning and many more!  I am so glad I don't have an addictive personality like my daughter does!  Try some sugar-free chocolate sometime, it's not bad at all!!|`|MGp3asPTaa	I HAVE that addiction x] haha.<br>  joking, but really, you can...scary right?

CtgBMZewaa	That's why.  Stop the brace.  Braces are clinically proven to WEAKEN your ankle, and make it more reliant on the brace.  That's why you keep getting twists and sprains.

If you do it's not the end of the world.  There's many treatments available.  Don't be embarrassed since it's not your fault.  Just remember that if you do have something, you have to tell you ex even if you hate him.  Good luck.|`|mpibHUiUaa	Well, it is very clear that there is some problem with your genitals, whether or not it is related to your boyfriend cheating and sleeping around. here is my advice. Go to the doctor for sure, but dont be surprised if you do end up with an STD. The sooner you go the better. and think about leaving that bf, he doesnt seem great.|`|895XRbnJaa	yeah its totally possible for you to have an std|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Yes, you could have an STD. <br>  <br>  You need blood testing to find out.

Eat as much as you can especially at night, when everyone who's trying to lose weight isn't supposed to eat.|`|cNS1g21caa	What To Eat To Gain Weight<br>  <br>  Increasing your intake of junk foods and greasy foods is not a good way to gain weight. Junk foods usually contain unhealthy trans fats or saturated fats. Even though you need to increase your calorie consumption to gain weight, those calories should come from foods that are good for you.<br>  Healthy fats include omega-3 essential fatty acids sources like tuna, salmon, flax, and walnuts. Good sources of protein include lean meats, fish, poultry, nuts, seeds and legumes. Healthy carbohydrate sources include fruits, vegetables and whole grains.<br>  <br>  It may be easier to eat five or six smaller balanced meals per day rather than eating three large meals, especially if you are not used to eating much at one sitting.<br>  <br>  Protein powders and nutritional supplement drinks such as Ensure (buy direct) can be added as in-between meal snacks if you still need more calories. Some protein powders are flavored and only need added water and some others can be blended with your choice of juice or milk to improve the taste.<br>  <br>  It would also be a healthy idea to add a small amount of flax seed oil and some psyllium powder to add some omega-3 essential fatty acids and extra fiber.|`|HxRbrf1Saa	Awh, that's so scary! :( <br>  <br>  I have a close friend who has the same thing, and sometimes she would have to go on what we called the "cheese cake diet".<br>  What she found worked for her was eating a unhealthy carb/calorie loaded portion of anything at the end of every meal.  It could even be a drink, you don't have to eat unhealthy, you still want to maintain health, just try to have about 3 treats a day with each meal.  It will help balance out your weight, because it can get dangerous losing weight.. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps sunshine, good luck. And have a good day/night.|`|2PfY0Neiaa	First of all is there a reason you are so tiny? Have you seen a doctor because it can be very dangerous. If you eat like a cow the most simple advice I can give you is get proscription from a doctor or try of the counter medicines.. Make sure you keep the eating up though. Best of Luck!|`|frD21lYpaa	Have a ton of protein, eat late at night.<br>  <br>   the main thing is to have a lot of protein. But I think your body will just have to grow. Try not to have too much sugar and stuff. Its like poisen, you wont really grow with it.

WntO0HSlaa	Assuming you're asking about adding muscle mass, not fat, studies found that protein/carb shakes, for example, build muscle best when taken within 1 hour of working out. Otherwise, you risk losing muscle:<br>  "There is no doubt that the best time to drink protein shakes is immediately following a workout.<br>  During a workout, particularly a strenuous strength training workout, your muscle experience trauma. Many tiny tears occur in the muscle tissue while you are exercising. This is why you feel sore the day following a good workout. These tiny tears are huge opportunities for muscle growth. As a matter of fact, it is through these tears that are muscles are given the opportunity to re-fortify themselves. This is precisely why the best time to drink protein shakes is immediately following exercise.<br>  Protein repairs muscle tissue. When you have tiny tears in your muscles, protein comes to the rescue, patching these tears. Through this patching and repairing, your muscles become stronger and larger than before. This is the science behind muscle gain and help explains why this is the best time to drink protein shakes. A good source of protein within one hour of the muscle trauma can drastically improve and speed the muscle repair and growth process."|`|heziH5K4aa	Eat one gram of protein per pound of body weight consistently. Also, do squats with the proper form (numerous videos about this on youtube), chocolate milk is actually recommended as a good post workout recovery drink.
dJuEtGxraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~|`|kbGOMwi7aa	get bigger pants or do nothing|`|psLk5fDGaa	The first thing to do is to look at what you are eating. Even if you don't eat very much you can still be eating high in calorie and fatty foods. Make sure you are getting enough fruits and vegetables, along with whole grains that keep you feeling full for longer. Eating healthfully does not mean you have to eat gross tasting things, you just have to eat conciously. The next step would be to make sure that you are drinking enough water. A common factor in weight gain is that people normal drink a lot of empty calories in sodas and juices. Drinking water is an important factor in weight loss. Replace all of your caffeine intake with teas, especially green tees. Coffee isn't bad, but it isn't as good as tea. Young people drink to much soda and it is awful for you. You could also take a look at the kind of exercise you are getting. Even simple things like instead of watching an extra 30 minutes of TV, get up blast some music and clean your room. You'll notice the results.|`|a89fc7a7a74ee78fea9b92e9a6a9492daa	How tall are you and how much do you weigh?  Just eat healthy and don't worry too much.  If you cut out junk food, and eat veggies, fruits and lean protein, You'll be fine.|`|k6g5wRoQaa	I say don't worry because you are probably just going through a body change.|`|HO9RGUx9aa	buy new clothes|`|73yY84e5aa	What sorts of foods are you eating? It doesn't matter how little you eat if you're eating fatty foods. And skipping meals doesn't make you lose weight.. it can actually do the opposite. To lose weight stick to healthy foods. Don't eat chocolate, cake, etc. <br>  <br>   If you're eating lots of carbs (bread, potatoes, pasta) , this could be the reason for weight gain as these are fatty starchy foods. Cutting down on these would be an effective way to lose weight. Just don't cut them out completely because they're an essential part of your diet.  <br>  <br>  I'm not too happy with my weight atm.. Have been eating less carbs and I am noticing a difference.<br>  <br>  Also depends what exercise you're doing. If you're running this will gain  muscle in your calves so they will get bigger. If you want to reduce the size of you calves do lots of walking as walking is a general weight loss. (you'll lose weight everywhere).<br>  <br>  Pilates is also a good exercise to reduce size of calves. This stretches your muscles. Therefore the muscles get longer which reduces the size. If calves arnt the problem as I said walking is the best thing to do as it is a general weight loss, and you'll see of will be really effective.<br>  <br>  Would be easier to know what  foods you'reeating and what exercise you do. Hope this helps though. It's working for me. I weigh about the same as you but I'm 5'5. And have lost 5 pounds in one and a half weeks. Good luck x|`|aq60VOU6aa	Eat healthier. <br>  <br>  Weight gain doesn't necessarily mean fat gain.

RXI8ImdIaa	Was this the first time you took your earring out? Sometimes it can be tricky to put it back in at exactly the right angle, if you are not used to it. If the earring is a hoop, it's even harder because you can't go in a straight line.<br>  <br>  Try GENTLY pulling down on your earlobe while you try to put the earring in. Don't pull hard. Use your finger to feel where the hole is on the backside. Leave your finger there so you can feel the hole while you try to push the earring through gently. You'll also be able to feel where that earring is, so it will probably be easier to get it right.<br>  <br>  If the hole really is blocked, then you are probably done. You'll have to wait for it to heal up, and get it re-pierced next year or so.
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	An ASCUS pap smear result is considered to be mildly abnormal. This is the most common type of abnormal Pap smear. ASCUS stands for Atypical Cells of Undetermined Significance,and basically means there were mild cellular changes and the the cause in unknown.<br>  <br>  The first step in managing an ASCUS Pap smear is to repeat the Pap test. Many times a slight infection or cervical inflammation may causes a Pap to come back as ASCUS. The Pap may be repeated immediately or within 4-6 months. The doctor may prescribe an antibiotic to clear up any possible infection prior to the repeat Pap. <br>  <br>  Remember to not have sex, douche, or use tampons 24-48 hours prior to the Pap smear test. These can often give false results. <br>  <br>  The bottom line is that there is no immediate cervical cancer risk in an ASCUS Pap smear. It is very important to follow up with a repeat Pap smear or colposcopy if your doctor orders. <br>  <br>  You need to go back to the doctor for another test in case it is a false report and then do as he says if it is abnormal again.<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	What your doctor probably said was that you have atypical squamous cells.  The cervix is made up of squamous cells, which refers to their shape- sort of a rectangle, like those on your surface skin.  Squamous cells have a certain look under the microscope, but they do change appearance slightly if they are inflammed for some reason.  With the cervical cells you also have the influence of the monthly hormones, use of tampons, sex, and a whole host of things that can affect how they look from time to time during the month.  Pathologists that check pap smears generally can tell if the change is due to hormones, but some can't or don't take the time.  It's easier to simply report that they don't look quite "right", and let your gynecologist sort it out.  That's what yours is doing.  The usual first step is just to repeat the pap smear, preferably when you are mid-cycle.  You get less hormone influence that way, and also won't be as likely to have bugged the little cells with a tampon.  At this point, your cells just looked a little weird, and that's nothing to worry about at the moment.  I've seen a lot of them come back that way, and most times the repeat smear is normal.  Your doctor may also take swabs to check for chlamydia and HPV when they do the second pap, to eliminate those as possible explanations.  What happens after that depends on the second smear.  Some docs will just have you repeat the pap smear again in a couple months, and some will want to go ahead and do a special exam to identify the specific trouble area and remove a sample there. They can also remove the entire spot as well.  Since your doctor didn't request you repeat the pap smear, I think what this means is your looked odd, but not odd enough to worry him.   Sometimes cells just don't look picture perfect, as they do in the textbooks.  That's where the experience of your doctor comes in to play.  So at the moment, no- you don't have anything to be particularly worried about.  Just follow your doctor's recommendations, and ask questions of him/her if you need more information, or want information in a more easily understood language than medical jumbo.|`|gULNGNkFaa	I'm a nurse, and I had to look this up this acronym myself!

c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	According to the World Health Organization - a very highly respected group - medical care in the US is the absolute worst among all of the industrialized nations on the planet.  Thus it is quite possible that you were misdiagnosed and mistreated.  It would be helpful to have more information however.  If you provide me with specific details I should be able to offer you a much better opinion.  It is unfortunate that the US is the only country in the world where medicine is for profit.  Physicians profit off the misery of their patients.  This to me is unethical.  Nonetheless physicians are all to human and greed in matters medical is the rule not the exception.  I have personally known more than a few physicians who 'gave' the patient a diagnosis to generate recurrent visits and substantial revenue.  In addition in the US we now train technicians rather than clinicians.  I am of the old school.  If I do not know the diagnosis after a history and physical examination I am not likely to improve the situation by testing.  Technicians simply order tests believing that the test will provide the diagnosis.  Unfortunately each test has false positives and false negatives.  Medical statistics is no longer a routine part of any medical school curriculum in the US.  Medical studies in recent years have consistently concluded that only about 20% of physicians are able to properly read and interpret a medical study.  This has been shown to lead to unnecessary testing which usually offers equivocal results leading to more testing.  To those who understand Bayes Theorem and medical statistics it is clear that each successive test that yields an uncertain result decreases the likelihood that there is a problem.  Unfortunately virtually all physicians think quite the opposite.  I am sorry if you have had the misfortune of 'poor' medical care.  I see patients every day who were misdiagnosed and / or improperly treated.  It is tragic and my heart grieves for what was once an honored profession.  Medicine is my calling.  It is my mission field.  Such a statement was once common but it is rare today.  You cannot serve two masters - and physicians must choose whether to serve the patient or have the patient serve as a means to income.  I hope that you do not have an abnormal heart rhythm or ischemia.  I wish you the very best of health.  If I may be of further assistance please let me know.|`|I3L88RDXaa	Question to answer your question.... Why were you under investigation to be diagnosed with an arrhythmia's and/or ischemia? And
GAHFiIqSaa	There is nothing wrong with you. Your symptoms indicate a spiritual presence - a ghost - which is trying to get your attention. <br>  <br>  Upon recognition that a spirit is the cause, it will calm down quite a bit, with a subsequent reduction in your negative symptoms. First, I'd recommend that you converse with it. How you speak to yourself, in your mind, is how one converses with a spirit. You will hear its responses in your mind as if you thought them. Begin by thinking to this unseen spirit, "hello, can you hear me." This phenomena is called telepathy, and is how spirits communicate and how God hears our prayers. Once you are conversing with it, try holding out an open and relaxed hand in front of you, then ask the spirit to touch it. This eye opening event will be evidence for what is written above.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend that you be kind to this spirit as it is there to help you, whether you realize it or not. If it is bothering you, you should politely ask it to stop what ever it is doing. I would not recommend asking it to leave as its presence is a blessing.<br>  <br>  Think of the artwork you have seen of the saints and their halos. The halo in art depicts the so-called Holy Spirit. It is about the head for a reason (the resurrection - which is outside the scope of this answer). This explains why so many of your symptoms are about your head; it is because the spirit is located there.

I`m going through the same thing, and actually just caught something. The keys that I know (which were almost out of my reach since I was working in a day care for awhile), is to wash your hands, carry hand sanitizer, avoid those who may be sick, or at least turn your face when someone coughs and sneezes (my mistake). The number one thing to do is washing you hands though. If people did this, then the virus would not be found on countertops and walls and everything else we might touch. Have you had your flu shot yet? It may help protect against some of the strains of the virus (but not all). Drink lots of water and make sure to get adequate exercise. This assures that your body will be in top fighting capacity if you were to encounter a germ.|`|lgTHnW7Baa	The very best way to avoid catching the flu is to get a flu shot before flu season.  Usually the pharmacies and clinics will start advertising for flu shots when it is time.  They aren't very expensive and they dont take long.  They do hurt just a little though.  I would also say that proper handwashing is the single most effective way to stop the spread of germs.  You should run water that is as hot as you can stand it.  Wet your hands, put liquid anti-bacterial soap in your palms and rub your hands between your fingers and the on the backs of the hands. Wash your hands for 30 seconds. You should then dry rinse the soap and dry your hands on a clean towel.  Hand sanitizer is not a substitiute for handwashing but it helps too. Also just avoiding people that you know have the flu should help alot.|`|47a351e058b1e2e9d4f9a2bfc0f35883aa	dont touch your face, or eyes. wash your hands 24-7 use purel before lunch, and caugh/sneeze in your arm. try not touching desks.

Choose water, juice and warm soups to prevent dehydration. Drink enough so that your urine is clear or pale yellow.# Rest. Get more sleep to help your immune system fight infection.<br>  # Try chicken soup. It's not just good for your soul — it really can help relieve flu symptoms by breaking up congestion.<br>  # Consider pain relievers. Use an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) cautiously, as needed. Remember, pain relievers may make you more comfortable, but they won't make your symptoms go away any faster and may have side effects. Ibuprofen may cause stomach pain, bleeding and ulcers. If taken for a long period or in higher than recommended doses, acetaminophen can be toxic to your liver. Talk to your doctor before giving acetaminophen to children. And don't give aspirin to children or teens because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease.|`|0kWkX8yiaa	i wouldnt recommend it|`|BlHGarlHaa	dont try it man u have to wait at least 3 1/2 days

Km8hU4lgaa	First off, I want you to know that feeling homesick is totally a normal thing to feel!  I've heard stories from guys and girls about homesickness when moving away for the first time (myself included!)<br>  <br>  Often times, it is the difficult things, the scary things, which end up making us better people in the end.  I know that it is hard, but I truly believe that it would be better for you to keep pushing forward with your goal.<br>  <br>  You moved with the intention of pursing your dream to work with music.  Some people are too scared to take that first step and actually move away, so in doing that, I want you to know that you're a lot stronger than you give yourself credit for!<br>  <br>  I think you kind of need to focus on two distinct lives.. and they're both very important!  On the one hand, you should keep in contact with your family on a regular basis.  Just because you moved away doesn't mean that you're not still an important part of the family!  You still need them, and they still need you.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, you do need to focus on your life there as well.  The best thing to do is get plugged in to some social things in the area.  If you're a religious person at all, a church can be a great way to get started.  My wife and I struggled with this at first, but eventually we found an excellent group our age that matches our personalities.  Are there people from work you can hang out with?  Try to make sure that you're not spending too much time sulking around the apartment - that's only going to make you feel homesick, like you're missing something back home.<br>  <br>  I know it's kind of silly, but often times spending a little time on extra decorations in your apartment can make a big help.  The more your place feels like a home and not a "temporary place you'll be leaving in a few months" the more you might actually enjoy spending those moments alone in your own home!<br>  <br>  I hope something here works for you!  God bless.

961e1fe88a95f0b9b8011e95c339a287aa	Firstly, you need to see what kind of discharge it is. There are many different types of vaginal discharge. Is it clear? It is cloudy? It is green, yellow, or brown? Does it smell bad or have no smell at all? It is hard to narrow it down with so little info on your part. For the most part, a lot of healthy women have a little discharge and that is normal.<br>  Yes, you can have a discharge when you get pregnant. You also have an increase of discharge when you ovulate. STD's also come with discharge. Chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, PID, and other vaginal infections and STD's can cause discharge. A man can also get a yeast infection and give to a woman.<br>  If it continues, I would go to the pharmacy and talk to the pharmacist. If he can't help you, go to the doctor. Just be safe.|`|apJ3t9k8aa	honey, please don't worry. a girl can start having discharge as soon as puberty hits.  discharge can mean several things. if you are recently sexually active then it could be a sign of infection, or sexual excitement. yes more discharge can be a sign of pregnancy, but like i said its not always the case.  your best bet would be to get checked out by your doc to rule out any STDs or yeast infections, just in case.<br>  <br>  good luck and PLEASE be safe.|`|k6x2lVLYaa	You need to take a pregnancy test soon ;<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  More DisCharge then usual is because your vagina needs to keep clean to protect infections from harming the baby. <br>  Also, after sex you'll get "wet" and your body is prepared for the next time you have intercourse. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  x|`|RBKHiCy5aa	Is the discharge a strange colour or smell (even though I doubt it would be this early to tell if it's an STD/STI)? <br>  <br>  Discharge can just be that little fluid that helps make pleasing yourself better.

The best help in the world for me.|`|dP08cZl5aa	discharge is a way of liek letting his thing go into urs easierr. so i think it hurts less. it means liek u must be thinking about it alot and ur body is getting ready for sex again|`|YTYrg3qlaa	its normal, but if you still are unsure take a pregnancy test :)

It's pretty new and it works so good without drying out your skin. With any acne product regimen you have to be consistant and don't expect too much so fast. Dont use wash cloths to clean your face and make sure your pillow cases are changed frequently because these items hold bacteria. also stay away from exfoilating scubs they spread bacteria. The clinique stuff goes for about 50 bucks try it!!|`|gTslbP6Baa	Different products work on different people the best would be proactive or herbal life its all Natural and worked for my mate... and his skin was really oily now he has that best skin. also.....ok This mite sound weird but if you use a electric tooth brush to massage the product in it dose the job like 100% better allot of people do it look on you tube lol. oh! and get the stuff with the grains in it they clear the dirt out better. :)|`|8x4lh5pXaa	now you're gonna think this is crazy but it worked for me.in my younger days i had pimples too and at night i tried to pop them (some popped some didn't) then i washed my face and put close-up tooth paste straight from the tube. yes i said close-up tooth paste in three days they were gone. but don't forget to wash your face in the morning.|`|wJbaTS0Aaa	I use Stridex face cleaning pads in the night and morning, and they really help prevent acne before it happens. As far as acne cream goes, Clean and Clear makes a good one. It usually clears up problems in 1-2 days. Get the Maximum Strength (Persa Gel 10).|`|2pEKV27Laa	honestly it depends on your skin, some products such as Pro Active work great for me but then again i've used just as expensive products and they actually made it worse. So your best chance is to just try out different products till the party bubbles disappear. GOOD LUCK :)|`|HOP7EIuVaa	Yeah boire its in a green bottle <br>  <br>  you can also use tooth paste it sounds funny but it really works just put some on ur finger an rub it on the acene for about 3 to 4 hours!!|`|uNLftrEnaa	Murad Refining mask is awesome!!! I just leave a touch of it overnight on pimples.  It helps dry them out, but be careful!!! It can overdry the skin around the pimple if you use too much.  Good luck!|`|AA12340227	i used alot of different creams.. none rlly worked<br>  i went to my doctor and he subscribed some kind of antibiodics<br>  they work rlly good, almost all totally cleared up<br>  so dont waste ur time with creams! talk to yr doc!|`|qOg1KJRRaa	renova works amazingly well.  it is prescription and is virtually the same as the acne medicine, accutane|`|WtElgJDtaa	Proactive FTW! =D ahaha<br>  or Murad.|`|XNuwTxAUaa	don,t waste your money buy a generic brand of stridex it works just fine in about a week acne will be completely gone trust me|`|5EHnbBX4aa	well if you wanna stop the redness ice works <br>  like ice form the freezer seriosly it worked for me|`|dd5HrYiraa	origins makes a really good spot treatment|`|xGXIl2aNaa	proactiv|`|EeJNbijiaa	proactiv really worked for me, so i'd say try that.. :)|`|h79y3DMRaa	Me And My Cousin Use Clearasil And It Helped Me A Lot, I Bought The Daily Oil-Free.|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	Between those two medications I would say proactive is the best. But did you know clean and clear is better than them both? Yeah, clean and clear does work faster and better and take from a guy whose tried it and lost all my pimples in one day!|`|huHOpRLLaa	clearasil is deff the best|`|0ixo6bkdaa	Differin- <a href="http://www.differin.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.differin.com/</a>|`|ixOE0onnaa	both|`|j1xB9LmDaa	clean n clear work really good|`|nIG0j9wUaa	toothpaste or *** lol|`|e7qTRzfkaa	Well the bes out of the 2 is proactive by far. But when I use it it works but your face gets a little dry so you really need to make sure that you use the moisturizer every time. Also a good thing to use if you dont have serious acne probloms then it would be safe to use clean and clear or oxy pads. They usually fix mild cases. Nutrogena to me is not a very good product but worth a try if nothing else works good for you.|`|8b34fb3b8669100814203bd289b81fc1aa	Proactive nor nutrogena really help your acne. Theres this one cream i got from my docotor, erythromygen (sorry not sure how its spelled) you have to get a prescription from your doctor to get it. It really helps, you have to keep in in the fridge and then twice a day, once in the morning and once at night aply it and it really helps.<br>  <br>  Another thing that might help you is stridex. There pads that you can rub your face with, i used that and it also helped clear me.<br>  <br>  One more thing im going to recomend is the Black head eraser...yes it really really really helps remove your blackheads!!!! And it also gives yours skin a smoothe feeling.<br>  <br>  My friend also said that SkinID helped her....so maybe try that...www.skinid.com<br>  <br>  Yes this sounds like a commercial, lol, but all of these things really helped me.<br>  Hope I helped you !!!|`|HdXy9Ppvaa	try the clean and clear acne system kit. it works waaay better than proactive and neutrogena. it helps keep your skin from getting all oily and nasty. it also helps to kill the bacteria trapped in your pores. need more help? e-mail me. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|3rxzsxHTaa	Go to the doctor. They'll give you topical cream that works. Sometimes if it doesn't work, they'll also give you pills that worked for me.|`|cBpDbtafaa	well....my brother has problems with acne. he always uses this over the counter stuff called "zapit".<br>  <br>  good luck on getting things cleared up :)|`|TZWkf59Daa	i used Dickenson wipes!<br>  they work really well!<br>  you can get them at any pharmacy or grocery store..|`|z1Ury9XNaa	A light coating of horse semen will clear your skin right up.|`|09XvlTE4aa	I use proactiv, it's my fav
7aVPODR8aa	It's probably a sebaceous sweat gland that's swollen or an in grown hair. Those, however, should disappear in a few days. Can you move it around or does it stay in one spot?

a9BYPzKxaa	You definitely have weight issues... you're 13.  At your age, you shouldn't be worrying about your weight.  You're still growing, and your body is still shaping out the way it's supposed to be.  If not yet, you'll be going through puberty, which is a huge, huge change in your body and may also account for some weight gain.  Your hormones will be all over the place which can cause the weight to increase.  There is no way you can worry about your weight at this point in your life.  You're still a child, whether you believe it or not.  You're only 13 yrs old, and you should be worrying about slumber parties with girlfriends, going to the movies, crushes on boys at school...not your weight.  I wish you luck, cause I see this as an eating disorder right around the corner waiting to happen.  And that would not be good.  Take care.|`|dJuEtGxraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~|`|JWavXCnsaa	jump rope!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 all the models do it...if u dont believe me look it up...it helps u get in shape and tones u!!!!!!1|`|kbGOMwi7aa	You're 13 and posting here?|`|4OJ7p620aa	The key for losing weight is not difficult - consume less and workout more often - the problems arise when we really try to put that into operation!

Eating less than 1200 calories per day can throw your body into a kind of starvation mode where you start storing fat and quit losing weight. Believe me, eating a bit more will help your metabolism, especially if you eat smaller meals every 3 hours instead of eating 3 big meals. The exercise is ok, but you might also benefit from some exercises to tone your lower tummy and some training like lunges and squats for your bum. If you keep to a good routine, you should lose around 3-4lbs every 2 weeks, making it possible to reach your goal by June.|`|e7qTRzfkaa	First off... you sound like you are well on your way to losing the weight.

f5adrF11aa	i had the same thing on mine too.<br>  mines gone now so what i did must have worked.<br>  do some asprin pastes.<br>  just take a few asprins and a few drops of water and make it into a paste. (buy the asprin without the color stuff on it) make it into a paste but crushing the pills in a small bowl and slowly mixing the water in. once its a paste spread it all over the bump thing. it will feel kinda gross. but just leave it there. for maybe 15-20 minutes then wash it off. do this only one or two times in a week.<br>  also heating it can help. get a small face towel wet it and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds. lay it on your ear and leave it till its not warm anymore. it may be alittle uncomfortable but it works. the bumb should shrivel up and soften. do this twice a day.<br>  with in time it will go away.<br>  i hope i helped and i hope it gets better.

It's the healthy way to lose weight.|`|2ZoP0lZeaa	Hey, I recommend that you try Hypnotherapy!<br>  No, I'm not kidding you on this.  I used to weigh 198 lbs and my height is only 5'8" - for my height and with that kind of weight I'm really obese!  I tried the "Master clense" and other diet recipes, and I even watched Richard Simmons videos but they didn't helped me at all!<br>  <br>  I tried going to a gym with a strict diet once and within a week later, I stopped going to gym and started eating more than before.  It brought me back to where I started again.  I am sure you happen to experience it like me.<br>  <br>  One day, I was watching CNN news and they interviewed this hypotherapist guy, his name is Steve.  I myself do not believe in hypnotherapy but the hypnotherapist was rather convincing so I visited his site (<a href="http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)</a> and he has a "Weight Loss Powerpack".  I bought the part 2 "Weight Loss Powerpack 2" which consist of Weight Loss, Stop Binge Eating and I Love To Exercise.  It is more affordable than a month of subscription to the gym and having those strict diets.<br>  <br>  The first few days I realized my eating dropped significantly and my weight dropped a little.  A week later, I begin to feel motivated to exercise and such!  His hypnotherapy works!  It has been a month already since I bought his program and I already lost 18.3 lbs!

YLYAo2zmaa	I think you probably have a blackhead. So take a bath to soften it up and give it a gentle pinch, it should come out. put some antiseptic on it .|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	Maybe an ingrown hair or irritation bump from, for example, tight jeans, which could cause the ingrown hair.<br>  <br>  I would go the doctor though, there are other things it could be as well, such as herpes,  but since you say that you two are only with each other and have never had a disease, that is why I suggest the ingrown hair.   <br>  <br>  If it doesn't go away in a few days - go see your doctor to be safe.|`|7pYLhhCSaa	Do you shave?<br>  If you day you may have gotten an in-grown hair or you may have cut it and it scabbed.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about it to much =]<br>  <br>  GoOd LuCk!!<br>  <33KaTiE gRRRlll!|`|DYlsqrMcaa	ugh!

If you're unsure it's best to go to a doctor and have it checked before trying to take care of it at home.|`|UfOP3xtcaa	It could be HVP, or herpes i would go to the doctor.|`|03rggPF2aa	most likely an ingrown hair|`|OoftsMLhaa	Most commonly bumps are consistent with overactive sebaceous glands, which can manifest as pimples, blackheads, bumps, boils, cysts,  and several other dermal conditions.  There are well over 100 possibilities as to what it could be.  It is next to impossible to determine which without actually seeing the bump/s.  Best bet is to clean the affected area and apply some sort of topical corticosteriod ointment anything labeled cortisone or hydrocortisone.  If that area continues to worsen see a doctor.

EsvJ9ji3aa	The other answers you got are WRONG.......You can only get genital herpes from sex or sexual contact (basically naked to naked as well as oral sex with someone who has oral herpes.) Research says not to use the same towel as a person who has and outbreak but there is no proof it is transmitted that way. You cannot just catch herpes, you have to get it from someone who has it and you can get it even if the person does not have an active outbreak. So ALWAYS USE A CONDOM even if you don't see anything some people don't show signs of it but still have it. Take care.|`|FTs2py0kaa	toilet seat...long odds|`|47a351e058b1e2e9d4f9a2bfc0f35883aa	you can get it when you share drinks, chapstick, spoons, icecream, toilet seats, showers, etc, with people who have herpes.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	No.

Thats the reason why you think you cant hear properly.<br>  Only one way out of this and that'll be a broad spectrum antibiotic, go see your Doc and get prescribed with some.|`|UDgPho6Baa	It sound like you don't have a head cold. You could have an ear infection, which is causing all those other symptoms. If you go to the doctor, or ask a pharmacist, they would tell you to get ear drops. And probably put you on a strong antibiotic..|`|4mSpN3Rxaa	you need to leave it alone or itll get infected. it is probably just fluid behind your ear. it will probably go away over time. if you start getting dizzy you got yourself and ear infection.|`|sMVKFBk9aa	you need something with a decongestant to dry up your sinuses.

6mZJSqBgaa	Start by avoiding the places/situations/people that encourage or drive you to partake in said drugs and alchohol. When we're in the same circumstances, things become habitual.  Identify patterns in your behavior or whatever that lead to that stuff.<br>  <br>  As for the women, heartbreak is inevitable.  We can't protect ourselves forever by avoiding intimacy.  On the other hand, it is good to be alone and have time for yourself for a little bit. Actually being celibate, isn't neccessary unless you feel strongly about it.  <br>  <br>  Spiritually... who isn't conflicted?? I mean, we all have our beliefs, but no one really knows anything.  Believe in what makes sense to you and dont be in a rush to put a lable on anything.<br>  <br>  And don't beat yourself up for supposedly never living up to your potential! Especially if your standards for success really are "quite high".  You're only human, be patient and realistic.  As long as you're moving forward, don't worry about how fast youre going, ya know?<br>  <br>  Hope i helped ;D|`|JXsViDciaa	First of all, you haven't identified your dependencies!

U1TAHDlcaa	I have never been in a relationship but i'm definetly not asexual. but the reason people want to be in relationships is because they want someone to lean on and cry to and hug to and express there feelings. not everyone finds love. i know alot of people who didnt get married there whole life and lived a happy life and felt like they didnt miss out on anything.|`|Sn3vLXY5aa	yes it is. its proven. people live longer if you have a love in your life but you don't have to have one if you don't want one.|`|Pgx4IEGTaa	no its not ...many people desire it for sex,reproduction,and to knowing someone loves them,....honestly I'm sorry but yes you are missing out on alot,women your age now are getting married,haveing kids and already settleing down,soon you'll want it,you don't want to be alone your whole life do you?|`|McfrauFnaa	the fact that you even asked this question might be a clue. but don't go and try and force it, relationships just kinda happen. don't worry about it, your time will come. and when that happens most late bloomers try to make up for all kinds of lost time. don't freak out, just go with it. you might also wanna look into a hobby or two, maybe learn to play an instrument....|`|a098e04dab579014d54e37f6c5d16362aa	Everybody is different.

I've never been in a relationship and somewhat I've felt the same way as you do at some point in my life. i feel sometimes pushed to be around with some chick or something because my brother, friends, family sometimes bring up that subject. At one point, i didn't care what they say and all, but later, i started paying attention at their comments about being in a relationship, saying that's pretty normal to be in a relationship, making me feel weird and kind of pushed to get into one relationship. I wouldn't mind being in one, but also i've never been in one because i'm guess i'm very picky, but still i don't get why i am still single. I wonder if i will always be single. interesting question that of yours! take care!:)|`|8lVq5acBaa	In my opinion, love is needed. Not even in a relationship way, just someone you can confide in. Don't you ever have times where something of significance happens and you want to share it with someone? If you feel that you can't make friends, possibly get a pet. Cats and dogs love their masters or mistresses no matter what. All you have to do is care for them, and by caring, love comes along. I'm sure you've felt love for something at one point whether it be parents, a favorite toy, or anything else. It made you feel happy, right? Love in any type is a great feeling. Try having a bit more confidence in yourself and remember that everyone has something liveable about them. In the 14 years I've lived, I've felt a great amount of love for family, friends, pets, and boyfriends. Trust me, it's an incredible feeling.
lYQDCJgeaa	Usually, by the time you show cold symptoms, you are past the contagion period. Having sex will nt increase the chances of spreading a cold or flu.<br>  Just do what you would ordinarily do: wash your hands before contact (more germs are spread from hands than coughing or sneezng) and cover your mouth when you do cough or sneeze.<br>  <br>  Franlly, when I have the flu, I don't usually want sex. <br>  I just want to die quickly, in my sleep.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	sea is last last thing on my mind when i got the flu,,,,|`|toqqTx8Caa	first off, i cant imagine why anyone would rather do anything than sleep while they have the flu. <br>  <br>  sex when sick just may not be a good idea in general. flu's give you fevers, sex makes you hot. flu's make you cough and all and sex makes your lungs really work. your body is tired. just let it rest...<br>  <br>  <br>  however...i did hear that sex clears up allergies and sinuses!|`|EDXh0tk9aa	Greater? Only if you are kissing.

6SN2LnmYaa	I think its really great that you want to help women with their births. I too want to be a neonatal nurse. I find it amazing how babies come into this world. I want to experience every miracle I can. I think you should watch the video. That way you know what to expect. You should definitely witness the birth and help your mom out. It would probably mean a lot to her. Maybe even let her know you found the video and ask if its ok if you watch it. She probably wont mind especially if she knows that's what you want to do later in life. Good luck and congrats on the new baby coming!!|`|gAV2c1rDaa	I think you should let your mom know you found it and let her know you would like to watch it and let her make that decision with you. I think you and your mom should speak before the birth as to what is expected of you and what she would want you to help with and what she is not comfortable with you doing. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|BIyiOgPYaa	Think about it, this is your MOM's vag. Every time you have sex with a girl, you are likely to think of your MOM'S vag. Not exactly sexy.<br>  <br>  However, if and only if it's ok with your mom, you could watch it. It's whatever is ok with you and your mother.|`|iQaKNSI6aa	I think you should watch it and don't tell your mom about the video but talk to her about it when your in the delivery room.|`|q7L70fPgaa	You lost me a little, isn’t witnessing the birth the same as watching the child being born. But any way I don’t think its weird you watching your birth video, why else would they have taped it. If your awkward about it just ask I’m sure it wont be a problem. As for the leg thing that depends on your relationship with your mom. I personally would find it weird. I want to be a midwife and I’ve already decided I wont help deliver my friends children, its to personal.|`|1L5Uq3voaa	That's a bit weird...you're only 15, and you've already decided you want to stare at women's vaginas for a living? No comment...<br>  <br>  Most doctors won't let you help, though, at such a young age.<br>  <br>  And your name seriously isn't Kelsey, is it? You poor boy.|`|Tn0EBBCZaa	I think that thats a great idea! You being part of the birth will really have a insta bond with the baby and the whole new family. watch the video its not like its weird... and no you wont think of your moms vag everytime you have sex. you may even thank her for going thru that for you!
TsjqzanQaa	Birth is a natural process, and I don't see anything wrong with it if your mother would want you present, and you feel comfortable with it.<br>  <br>  It's an indication of how ridiculous our society is when natural body processes are considered something to be hidden.|`|9X80v9Wsaa	sick dude see your moms vagina SICK MAN SICK..<br>  <br>  I'd rather get shot than watch that ****..of any baby being born BLAARGH|`|V61lRUvdaa	ask her if your that curious...maybe you'll get a new-found respect for her...or be grossed the f*ck out! either way its a new experience so just ask if you can see the video and if you are going to see the birth of a new baby live then you probably should watch the video good luck and congrats on the new little brother or sister|`|EP92Eps5aa	lol my mums preg but i wont be watching her give birth lol " but if its what your into" watch the video 1st actually watch other birth giving videos youtube etc then your own itl get you ready for it but the whole "leg holding thing i dont know how shed react " if anything let her squeeze your hand that would be better "hope this helped"|`|ZXhgndqEaa	Yeah how bout we don't look at Mom's goods. A lot of women would probably feel uneasy with a male nurse hanging around them while giving birth.|`|G9TocOkAaa	how considerate of  you....wanting to hold your mother's leg when she's pushing out your sibling...|`|BcWs38MWaa	it is nasty but as a female i think u that want to be a nurse are mentaly mature to handle it and i think that for ex u help ur mom give birth right i think it is a profession i honestly do not think its bad if u watch it because that is the reason why they filmed u well ur mom givin birth so just talk to her and tell her ur toughts|`|h03kIyxwaa	ewwy ewwy you were born?|`|hhmymTwLaa	i think u should watch the video. and feel comfortable watching ur mothers give birth

You'll be about 5'3" if not shorter.|`|ICOmnGIUaa	i would say you are done growin|`|v5Ta04Mtaa	probally around 5'3
SKhL0PPTaa	Yes, the weights will help. They will tone your muscle. If this is your first time with weights though, you really want to start with the one pound weights. It doesn't seem like a lot, but after a short period of time they can become really heavy. Alternate using them on your legs and arms as you walk or run. This will give your muscles a chance to recover. <br>  <br>  I work out with 1 pound and 1.5 pound weights, but I do intervals of sprinting and running at pace for three miles. The weights become tiring very quickly, but they help develop explosive power and speed and have definitely helped me get in shape.
2wMMAKpOaa	There are birth controls that make you only get your period 4 times a year. Talk to your doctor about it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)<br>  -MVP|`|35u9RVVFaa	probably not. ur period is something essential for your body. unless you remove all your unfertilized eggs. but, then you'd never be able to have a baby. I'm guessing you're around 12 years old. at this age, everyone says they don't want a baby. trust me, when u grow up, you will. if u do remove your eggs, you'll regret it. Even if u do remove them, u probably will still have your period through.|`|zIma8YWYaa	All girls need their period.

Aside from the slight mess (easily managed) and the cramps (which ended after I'd had a baby) I always found it kind of reassuring, every month, to know all the "plumbing" was still in working order.<br>  <br>  I used to "celebrate" by taking that evening for myself, eat my favorite dinner, and curl up in bed with a heating pad and a good book or a movie.

giBfNMX6aa	Take an anti-inflammatory medication like Advil every 8 hours for a few days.  Hopefully, it will give your teeth a chance to settle a bit, but if the problem continues, you do need to go back.  Maybe all they need to do is adjust the bite on the fillings.  If they are a little too high, it could create the type of pain you're experiencing.|`|psvvCFPYaa	drink REALLY warm water and let it sooth the area it will loosen up any pressure.

I always take pills with a creamy drink like chocolate milk, so I can't taste it. Also, make sure it is safe to break the pills apart. It should say on the bottle... I think you should learn to take them. I use to be the same way as u, but eventually i figured it out. But, in the mean time, try chocolate milk. It does wonders.|`|gaVhPGWhaa	take some water and swallow the tablet with the water. that always works for me. if you cant swallow the vitamins, try buying some chewable ones. it still has the same effect if you break it or not.

AA11437439	i think that is a misnomer that mentally ill people dont know they are sick<br>  <br>  it is true for some but not all<br>  <br>  some do know they are in need of help but the predujuce against mentally ill people can insure that early signs are glossed over.<br>  <br>  knowing that one is under stress - then asking for help being a sign that you dont need help?  it sounds like it is the system that is even more messed up than those trying to sort themselves out!<br>  <br>  the thing is when problems loom large as they do for most mentally ill people - some try and push the pain under the carpet because they dont have the emotional capacity/energy to face up to their problems - and ironically that can often make it worse<br>  <br>  after a time those problems resurface and when it gets to the point of not being able to hide them somewhere then the person can get overwhelmed - if they are fortunate then this is where they get professional help but there are always those who dont get the help they need at this point<br>  <br>  if it goes on for quite some time then the person gets worn down by it and eventually gives up hope for a solution and possible considers suicide,<br>  <br>  i am so sorry for your loss - i lost my soul mate to suicide too - no one told me until we wrote to him asking if he would be our best man at our wedding. his parents had the unenviable task of writing back thanking us for the friendly letter bu explaining the situation - it was the worst day of my life!<br>  <br>  over time i have begun to realise that<br>  <br>  1 - no one can do enough for someone who is determined to commit suicide<br>  <br>  so even if you did see the signs (and suppose that he let you see the signs) you cant watch him 24/7 and prevent him if he is 100% determined that is what he wanted to do<br>  <br>  2 - eventually working thru other emotions to realise that i would need to forgive him for hurting us like that<br>  <br>  people in that situation actually believe their loved ones would be better off without them - in reality it is a decsion driven by their inner pain - but in an odd way they were thinking of you - but made the wrong decision because they were so dominated by their inner pain.  often people in that situation get so used to the pain that they are not in a positin to be able to realise it is getting to the point that they need(and will receive) appropriate help.<br>  <br>  i think that your love for him made his life easier and gave you some good moments to share - try and remember those times too<br>  <br>  i do feel for you very much at your time of loss|`|cw42LOLBaa	Sometimes even if the person knows the thoughts are wrong, they thinks the thoughts will pass so no help is sought.  Or the person doesn't seek help because they are afraid that someone will think that whoever they tell will think that they are crazy.  Sometimes fear of rejection or being cast out by society out-weighs the feeling that maybe the person is sick.  Of course, there always are those cases where the person doesn't even realize that feeling suicidal is irrational.  Being mentally ill in some cases means haven't thoughts that aren't rational.|`|TdqeC0vmaa	You didnt notice he was sick.

While others don't fare so well. When I was having suicidal thoughts I knew that something was up. I did go see a psych and was put into the nut hut for a while. The only thing I didn't notice; however, was that I had psychosis as well. So it varies from person to person. Your boyfriend was just sick. You shouldn't blame yourself. Sometimes the signs aren't so obvious.

I found this it helped put a smile on my face hopefully it will you too. <br>  <br>  There are inspirational stories I stumble upon that make me say, “I wish I had written that.” This is one of those stories. The author is unknown, but, no doubt, she was a wise woman.<br>  <br>  “The Pencil Maker took the pencil aside, just before putting him into the box. ‘There are five things you need to know,’ he told the pencil, ‘before I send you out into the world. Always remember them and never forget, and you will become the best pencil you can be.’<br>  <br>  ‘One: You will be able to do many great things, but only if you allow yourself to be held in Someone’s hand.<br>  <br>  ‘Two: You will experience a painful sharpening from time to time, but you’ll need it to become a better pencil.<br>  <br>  ‘Three: You will be able to correct any mistakes you might make.<br>  <br>  ‘Four: The most important part of you will always be what’s inside.<br>  <br>  ‘And, five: On every surface you are used on, you will leave your mark. No matter what the condition, you must continue to write.’<br>  <br>  “The pencil understood and promised to remember and went into the box with purpose in its heart.”<br>  <br>  I think we sometimes forget our purpose. We stumble through the day, doing what has to be done without thought to what needs to be done. Henry Kissinger is credited with saying “the urgent takes all the time from the important.” We need to get back to the important. Like a pencil, we leave our mark on each life we touch.|`|c1Dpi0eyaa	You are breathing<br>  You are aware that you are breathing<br>  You can choose differently<br>  <br>  There are many who cannot claim or do the same.<br>  I suggest you volunteer at a hospice where people are dying and have no other choice but to bide time until they pass.|`|pueeMH6gaa	Watch a movie called "The Walrus and the Orphan."

I don't know how old you are, or your life's experiences, but I do know that everybody goes through hard times in their life. I have been through some hard times myself. The thing I always have to tell myself is, "It could be worse." There are many other people out there with far worse problems than mine. I believe God tests people to make them stronger. I don't believe he gives people more than they can deal with. I would advise you to think about that and to talk to your family about what is going on, and then talk to a dr., even if it is just your family doctor. He/She can get you the help you need, whether it be counseling or medication, or both.

Take the time.   If you feel like this, it <br>  pays to at least face it.<br>  When you are at the bottom of the pit, or in the darkest cave, it only takes a little match to light up the whole place.     You were born.   A fact you cannot deny.   You are no accident.   You were not a mistake.   You are not doomed to despair forever, unless you choose to do so.    Howl as you will over your lack of dreams, lack of get up and go, lack of friends, and lack of happiness, what are you going to do about it?   If you keep on acting as though you have nothing to do to change your future, nothing will.   You will keep on being miserable. <br>  It says in Proverbs 18.24 <br>  A man that would have friends must show himself friendly, and there is a friend that sticks closer than a brother.<br>  The would have in this verse is given as "that hath" ...and so this shows that it is you and me who has first to be a friend, before we can have friends.     Then it gives a promise that there is one who will stick to us closer than a brother.....<br>  I choose to believe that I must first be ME and like me, and like me, and live with me, so I will be a friend to myself first of all, and then be a friend to others as they come my way.    God will be my friend, even as Abraham was a friend to God.    Galatians 3.26 For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.   Y'shua Meschiach Adonai - Jesus Messiah my Lord<br>  is the One who declared and showed us what and who God is, and He is the Light, the Menorah in my heart.     <br>  If no one has ever loved you, you still cannot say I never had a chance.  God let you be born, and God planned for you, and God will show you how to dream, how to be you your very own self, and to like yourself, and to love Him and to love others.    <br>  Just ask Him.  Tell him you are at the bottom of the pit, and in the darkest hole, and in the deepest tunnel, and that you cannot get out of this despair by yourself.    Then count on it.    He is a Gentleman and will let you know.<br>  He will show you.    Depend on it.    Just like the bed that holds you up during the night while you sleep.   It is there.    He is there.    He will show you. <br>  Hope I have helped.

But two hours is definitely an extreme, it won't kill you but if you keep it up for an extended period of time it could mess with you mentally.

333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	If your in the U.S., there is actually a product called Toothache.  if not look for something that they use for babies when they are teething, there used to be a very popular product that tasted like liquorice but I don't remember the name.|`|nkMbQFv7aa	(1) Massage with Ice - Perhaps the most unusual toothache remedy is to rub an ice cube into the V-shaped area where the bones of the thumb and forefinger meet. Gently push the ice over the tooth ache area for 5 to 7 minutes. In a study, Ronald Melzack, Ph.D., a Canadian researcher and past president of the International Association for the Study of Pain, found ice massage eased toothache pain in 60% to 90% of the people who tried it. His research shows this procedure works by sending rubbing impulses along the nerve pathways that the toothache pain would normally travel on. Since the pathways can carry only one signal at a time, rubbing outweighs the pain. <br>  (2) Rinse Your Toothache - Take a mouthful of water (at body temperature) and rinse vigorously, says Dr. Taintor. If your toothache is caused by trapped food, a thorough rinse may dislodge the problem. <br>  <br>  (3) Floss Gently - If swishing doesn't work, you can try to pry the popcorn hulls or tiny bits of meat out from between your teeth by flossing, says Dr. Taintor. Be gentle! Your gums are likely to be sore. <br>  <br>  (4) Rinse with Salty Water - After each meal and at bedtime, stir 1 teaspoon of salt into an 8-ounce glass of water (again, at body temperature), says Dr. Corn. Hold each mouthful, roll it around your mouth. Spit. <br>  <br>  (5) Stay Cool - Keep heat away from your affected area even if it makes the toothache feel better, warns Dr. Corn. "If it is an infection, the heat will draw the infection to the outside of the jaw and make the infection worse." <br>  <br>  (6) Use Oil of Cloves - People have been using this over-the-counter remedy for many years, says Richard Shepard, D.D.S., a retired dentist in Durango, Colorado. Most drugstores carry tiny bottles of the oil. Drop a little directly onto the tooth, or dab a little on a cotton ball and pack the elixir next to the tooth ache. If you have a whole clove, place a whole clove between the aching tooth and your cheek. It can be held in place by holding your finger on the outside of the cheek. Chew the cloves a little to release their juice, then leave them in place for half an hour or so or until the pain subsides. <br>  <br>  (8) Use Lime Juice - Add some lime juice to asafetida (hing) powder. Soak a piece of cotton and hold it on the tooth and gum. <br>  <br>  (9) Keep Your Mouth Shut - If cold air moving past the affected tooth is a problem, just shut off the flow, says Roger P. Levin, D.D.S., president of the Baltimore Academy of General Dentistry and a guest lecturer for the University of Maryland. <br>  <br>  (10) Use Turmeric Sticks - Burn some turmeric (haldi) sticks; make a fine powder and use as toothpowder. <br>  <br>  (11) Use Ginger - Chew a ginger piece slowly with the aching tooth/teeth to release its juice and leave there for half an hour. Repeat 2-3 times. <br>  <br>  (12) Use Star Fruit - Drink the juice of 2-3 star fruits twice a day to get toothache pain relief. <br>  <br>  (13) Use Peppermint and Salt - Boil 5 gram of peppermint and a pinch of salt in 1 cup of water. Drink it to relieve toothache. <br>  <br>  (14) Use Vanilla Extra - Pour a few drops of Vanilla extract on the dental toothache in question. <br>  <br>  (15) Use Oil Of Oregano - Pour a few drops oil of oregano on the toothache and/or adjoining gum. <br>  <br>  (16) Avoid Biting Down - If the toothache is caused by a blow to the tooth, try not to use that area when you eat, says Dr. Corn.

(if so, it is probably reactive [situational] depression: counselling, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may be indicated, but most of life's adverse situations are resolved within 16 weeks, yet the medical criteria for depression, and the prescription of antidepressants is only 2 weeks!). Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause? (a nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, environmental toxicity, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause). Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment). <br>  <br>  It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor. <br>  <br>  (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, don’t follow the typical “normal” reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that you’re looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements. <br>  <br>  (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes minutes of exercise, daily, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*.(5.) Initially, at least, some form of psychotherapy or counselling; later, perhaps either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy for, say, 6 months. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.  (7.) As options, if desired, either a known, effective herbal remedy, such as St. John's wort, (get a German variety, if possible; local ones may vary in effectiveness. Perika, and Kira brands have been recommended as being effective. Take with a meal) or supplements, such as SAMe, or Inositol (from vitamin and health food stores, some supermarkets, or mail order: view section 55).|`|AA11647216	Number one talk to your mom or someone and never just stop your meds suddenly.

Oh no, did a member of your family die? Boo Hoo, life happens... And with life, comes death. Crying won't make daddy/granny/whatever come back. Look at life with the positive outlook. Each second that passes your cells are rotting. Each breath you take brings you one step closer to spending eternity in a wooden box (if your Jewish, or an Egyptian King, wrapped in a white cloth).

You need to talk with someone.  Professional counseling is needed.  You do not need to jump back to taking an anti depressant as it is not effective without counseling the two must go together.  If you have access to a pastor or spiritual leader share your concerns with them.  Try to get plenty of sunlight and proper rest.  Make sure you are eating a well balanced diet and getting regular exercise.  Try starting a daily journal to give you a place to express your thoughts.  Try doing yoga it is very therapeutic.  Also try a hobby; something like art or inspirational music will help you.  Never underestimate the power of prayer and having a relationship with Jesus Christ, he died for such a time as this.
d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	Yes. It's called a sarcoma. There are over 60 subtypes of bone and/or soft tissue sarcoma. A sarcoma is a cancer of the bone, muscles, joints, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, and/or other soft tissue found within the body ( including the foot).<br>  <br>  From your description it is hard to tell what is going on . . but in general any type of unexplained, painless lump or bump that appears anywhere on the body should be examined by a doctor, especially if it appears to be growing.<br>  <br>  One reason this may need to be examined is because it is difficult to tell the difference between a benign or a malignant condition and may need a biopsy. Hopefully this will all turn out to be a scare for you and be nothing. One word of caution . . if the doctor suspects this is a sarcoma or just can't figure out what it is . . . go immediately to a sarcoma specialist or a sarcoma center. Sarcoma are rare enough that few regular doctors have seen them. They need to be treated by a specialists because they can be aggressive, stubborn, and reoccur.

Also, (if you can) take 4 tablets of Advil (800mg) every 8 hours, by the clock.  This helps to reduce inflammation internally.  When you can, get a hold of your dentist.  You need a short course of muscle relaxers, like Soma, Flexeril or Valium.  You would take a dose at bedtime to help relax everything.

tMtBe1lKaa	Strep Throat doesn't always appear with white dots or a flaming red throat. The only true way to tell is by having a doctor do a throat swab. <br>  <br>  Not taking care of strep throat can lead to having heart problems. It is best to know. Google "strep throat symptoms" and see which ones you have, and when the onset was. There is usually a particular order concerning strep. <br>  <br>  Also, make sure to drink plenty of water or gatorade. Fruit smoothies help soar throats also. rest and take tylenol to reduce fever and pain. best of luck!|`|AA10358331	Have someone look in the back of your throat with a flash light. If they see white pockets on your tonsils, its quite possible. They only way to know is to go to the doctor and have them look at it.|`|3QIWdvG1aa	The most common symptoms of strep throat are:<br>  <br>      * A sudden, severe sore throat.<br>      * Pain when you swallow.<br>      * Fever over 101°F (38.3°C).<br>      * Swollen tonsils and lymph nodes.<br>      * White or yellow spots on the back of a bright red throat.<br>  <br>  You may also have a headache and belly pain. Less common symptoms are a red skin rash, vomiting, not feeling hungry, and body aches.<br>  <br>  Strep throat can be passed from person to person. When a person who has strep throat breathes, coughs, or sneezes, tiny droplets with the strep bacteria go into the air. These droplets can be breathed in by other people. If you come into contact with strep, it will take 2 to 5 days before you start to have symptoms. Antibiotics such as penicillin, cephalexin, or amoxicillin are used to treat strep throat. Antibiotics are effective only against bacterial infections such as strep throat and will not speed the healing of sore throats caused by viral infections such as colds or allergies.<br>  <br>  Strep throat will go away in 3 to 7 days with or without treatment. Antibiotics are effective in relieving the symptoms of strep throat only if they are given within 48 to 72 hours after symptoms begin. However, antibiotics are commonly used to treat strep throat because they:<br>  <br>      * Kill the bacteria and shorten the time you are contagious. You are usually no longer contagious 24 to 48 hours after starting antibiotics.<br>      * Prevent rare complications. Although uncommon, strep bacteria can spread to other parts of your body causing ear or sinus infections or an abscess behind or around the tonsils (peritonsillar abscess). Antibiotics may also prevent the infection from triggering your immune system to attack itself and cause serious conditions such as rheumatic fever.<br>      * Relieve discomfort and speed healing to some degree.<br>  <br>  Antibiotic treatment can begin immediately if a strep infection is confirmed by a rapid strep test. However, there is no harm in waiting for the results of a throat culture to confirm strep throat before starting antibiotic treatment. In fact, it is better to wait until strep throat has been confirmed so that antibiotics are not used unnecessarily: overuse of antibiotics can make them ineffective.<br>  <br>      * Although waiting to treat strep throat prolongs the time you can have the illness, delaying treatment does not increase the risk of rheumatic fever or other complications.<br>      * The benefit of delaying the start of antibiotic treatment for a day or two is that your body is able to build up its own immunity to the infection, possibly reducing future occurrences of strep infection. It also reduces the chance of building a resistance to antibiotics.4<br>  <br>  Your health professional also may recommend nonprescription medicines such as acetaminophen or anesthetic throat sprays to help relieve the pain and discomfort and reduce fever caused by strep throat.|`|5anAeR17aa	you didn't mention if you have a temp.

AOCqOTfBaa	Hi Babe,<br>  Minor or serious elbow pain can include symptoms such as pain, swelling, numbness, tingling, weakness or a decrease in range of motion. Sudden or acute elbow injuries may be caused by a direct blow, a fall, or a penetrating injury. Other elbow injuries can occur by twisting, jerking, jamming or bending the elbow abnormally.<br>  <br>  Elbow treatment depends on several factors; the location, type and severity of the injury, how long ago the injury occurred and a persons age, health condition and activities. Elbow treatment measures include the application of a brace, splint, or cast, physical therapy, medication and in some cases surgery. Hope it's not serious my lady!|`|c614aa36f47781f6160bcceaebb97251aa	You might have bursitis or tennis elbow. Go to the doctor and get it checked out.
HbSKFnDxaa	I've never had that particular problem....|`|AS8VyrVgaa	mine are the same way. my mom checked mine last night and said its normal. its probably hormonal. i wouldnt worry as long as you dont feel any bumps in the lower area of your armpit. <br>  good luck!
mAp90hEeaa	There can be some problems when they cut the bile duct before removing your gallbladder.  It would be a good idea to call your surgeon (someone is always on call) and talk with them about your symptoms.  If the pain isn't too uncomfortable - take some pain medication (tylenol) and call them in the morning.  Without a doctor examining you, it would be very difficult to tell if this is a complication of your surgery or you have developed a new problem.|`|apJ3t9k8aa	well if you ask my dad he would say, yes, although he had his removed 3 times...<br>  looks like both you and him need a new doc. lol|`|xfJuyHoeaa	Yea your best bet would be to see a doctor but you could do a symptom checker at this helpful site <a href="http://www.webmd.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/</a>|`|Rf9vw4fjaa	I'm really sorry about your pain, but SEE A FRICKIN' DOCTOR!!|`|bod1itbiaa	I had the same surgery a month ago and occasional feel a spasm where my gall bladder was located.

It would be good for you to take your temperature because if it is 100 or higher then you are sick and need a doctor.|`|0lCnu1g2aa	I would call your dr in the morning or consider going to the ER tonight if needed. The symptoms you describe are a bit bizaar to say the least. Occassional nausea is one thing, but the pains you describe are something else. Not sure what they are. Go get checked out. You might have mild pancreatitis or something like it.

You should intake many healthy calories at the beginning of the day. Don't worry to much about 'calories' as much as the quality of the calories. I don't know your daily schedule and workout routine but you definitely shouldn't be taking a smaller breakfast than that.|`|JThgHiaoaa	If your sitting behind a desk all day then yes that's a pretty good breakfast...

I think you need to do more exercise, (i.e. jogging, play football for atleast an hour) atleast 2 times a week. This will make you very tired and you will fall asleep much quicker.<br>  <br>  You have alot of unused energy at night, you just need to transfer it to the morning. Also its good to eat some fruit before you go to sleep, wake up and have some cereal, and put away all distractions (like your laptop) when you are lying in bed.<br>  <br>  But then again its easier said than done, I did this for a few weeks, and ive gone back to the exact same routine of sleeping during the day and being awake all night, with little exercise.

1zgWUTXZaa	You may want to try some chamomile or other herbal (make sure it's de-caf) tea, it does sometimes help. If that's not an option, soft instrumental music usually helps me. A little bit of light meditation just focusing on breathing in and out deeply may help you relax enough to get some rest. One big thing that you can do to help is turn the computer screen (and tv if it's on) off and read a book or do something else relaxing for a while. Apparently, the computer/tv screen is very stimulating for your brain and it makes it difficult for it to shut down and sleep. As for the feeling sick, with the exception of the blocked nose, those are all symptoms of not getting enough sleep and if you get some rest it should get better. If it keeps up for a long time-I mean a month or more here-see your doctor, you may have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. As for getting to bed early, my best suggestion is to set a time for yourself to turn off the tv/computer, and stick to it! After that, take a little time to relax-read, do a little yoga, whatever works for you-for 15-30 minutes to prepare yourself for sleep, and attempt to go to bed as soon as you're done with that.<br>  <br>  If this has been going on for a while or continues, you may want to check out www.sleepydust.net for more information on CFS.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|Up6wkVLvaa	You need to set your alarm for something like 6am each morning and stick to it between now and Monday and don't sleep in the day and just go to bed early at about 11pm each night so that you get back into the rhythm.  Also if you can't sleep don't worry that you can't sleep or you won't be able to sleep.  Its like a vicious circle, going round and round.  Read a book and chill.  You'll be tired in the day but you'll just have to put up with that.|`|xCqNTjGLaa	warm hot chocolate (made with milk) because milk contains melatonin and the amino acid tryptophan, although in small amounts they help you feel full at night and nice and cosy. also try taking some midnight snacks to bed with you aswell as a drink so if you do wake up you wont have to get out of bed and can go back to sleep as quickly as possible|`|DNLvJ7cEaa	I have tips I hope you will do this direction<br>  <br>  1. read books or bad books so you fell tired.<br>  2. consume vitamin especially C vitamin because it can make fit your body.<br>  3. sport is important for you.. what your sport hobby?..

It's 6am here too, and I have school on monday.<br>  If I were you, unless you are seriously tired, don't sleep. Or if you do, don't stay asleep until after noon. Then establish what time you want to go to bed, and go to bed every day at that time. Your body will then get used to it.|`|cUWQPWjLaa	Having a warm cup of milk before going to bed will help u fall asleep and also why not listen to some slow songs , u will fall asleep in no time.

With his love and peace in your heart your worries will subside. He will guide you and give you answers.   He will provide a path.    Why not give him a try.   He works when the world fails you.  He is there when the world abandons you.  He is your friend when no friend can be found.   He listens and cares and wants to help you.   Jesus grant him this.   Amen.    <br>  <br>  <br>  ?

You may want to look this up, it is responsible for a wide range of health issues that modern western medicine is just now discovering.<br>  <br>  Blood sludge is basically undigested food particles and oxidized materials floating around inside your blood.  This interferes with your immune system...picture it like this...you have a flowing river which is your blood, small boats trying to maneuver around down stream which represent your white blood cells...and then a lot of tree branches and other pollutants within the water, making the water a thick gooey mess.  All this "blood tar" prevents your immune system from searching out and destroying invading germs and such.<br>  <br>  What I would suggest is purchasing yourself a lot of grade "A" grape juice which contains a lot of natural anti-oxidants and even some other powder form anti-oxidants and begin taking them as often as you can.  Anti-oxidants reverse oxidation in your cells and blood particles and clean up your blood so that your immune system can once again function properly.  You will also feel your energy return because blood sludge saps your body of that energy, once it is cleansed again your energy will no longer be held back.|`|AA11091145	Wow, that was a lot to read.  If your symptoms weren't so close to mine, I would have stopped for sure.  Don't waste your time thinking its Lupus.  95% of the people with Lupus have a positive ANA.  And even if you happen to be one of those unlucky 5%, you would still have other symptoms like frequent low-grade fevers.  No fevers, no lupus.  No high sed rate (ESR test), no lupus.<br>  <br>  I do believe that you have drop dead fatigue and your body aches.  Some people will try to tell you have fibromylagia.  Don't accept that answer.  When you had low iron, it would have been good if you had a full iron panel done (your total body stores of iron).  This would have been useful in telling if your iron was low because of poor diet, heavy periods, low iron because of disease or low iron because your body is not absorbing what you are eating.  <br>  <br>  I would strongly suggest making a food diary.  A food intolerance such as wheat or brewers yeast can make you very tired and have painful joints.  You don't have to have Celiac Disease to have a gluten intolerance.  I also suggest increasing your vitamin C.  Low vitamin C can cause fatigue and depression.  I would get your iron retested.  Your stomach problems could be chronic gastritis(inflamation of the lining of the stomach).<br>  <br>  Your stomach is the first clue and its the one I'd keep focus on.  Don't get sidetracked on other symptoms.  If you took a lot of advil for the pain, it just makes your stomach worse.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't try to self-diagnose yourself.  Your doctor will then label you as a hypochondriac.  New symptoms may come six months or a year from now which will may make the picture clearer.  Try and work one day a week if you can.  It will make you feel better about yourself and give you something to talk about when you are with your friends.<br>  <br>  I think Shaolinw is on to something with the undigested food.  This brings you back to your stomach.|`|AA11935435	I'm truly sorry that you are having it tough right now, it certainly isn't easy for you I can see that, through reading your comments, I wish I could give you some advice on your health problems but I am not well versed on Lupus so all I can do is pray for you and share with you a comforting Scripture(Revelation21:3,4)And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.<br>  4He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."<br>  Hang in there friend, the best is yet to come!<br>  Love Always IST|`|VR3xtDGoaa	Luke 8:43-49     A woman was there who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years. Although she had spent all she had on doctors, no one could heal her.She came up behind Jesus and touched the tassel of his garment, and her bleeding stopped at once.Jesus asked, "Who touched me?" While everyone was denying it, Peter and those who were with him said, "Master, the crowds are surrounding you and pressing in on you."Still Jesus said, "Somebody touched me, because I know that power has gone out of me."When the woman saw that she couldn't hide, she came forward trembling. Bowing down in front of him, she explained in the presence of all the people why she had touched Jesus and how she had been instantly healed.Then he said to her, "Daughter, "YOUR FAITH HAS MADE YOU WELL" (not shouting). Go in peace."<br>  Have faith on Jesus always... and remember that God shows in many ways: doctors,people,friends,etc. but the most important way.. inside you!<br>  You will be in my prayers<br>  <br>  I agree with Shaolinw|`|992f4ed91495448a70fe8e6c36df9007aa	The emergency room won't do you much good.

uQFZBcw3aa	I'm suffering from Major depression disorder and I feel totally alone.  I also am tried of people walking on egg-shells around me.  My advice based on my experience is to plan activities with him that he likes, let him feel that you are there, without being overly pushy.  Also, its really nice to know people care, so perhaps doing small things for him like putting a special treat together to give him or sending a package to him?  I know its kinda sad, but even junk mail is something for me... it makes me feel less isolated and out of touch.  Hope this helps.|`|AA11348638	Don't judge, let him do the talking and just let him know he can call you anytime and that panic disorder is terrible but it won't kill him and he needs to do what the Doctor says in order to get better.
8MuW1pfCaa	Hey there -- I think that would be just fine. I currently take cranberry supplements every day (for me it's to prevent urinary tract infections, which I'm prone to) along with acai berry supplements. My favorite acai brand is <a href="http://www.acai-balance.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.acai-balance.com</a><br>  <br>  If you have any real concerns you should ask your doctor, but I'm confident that this combination is okay.

MYhQqeV7aa	You must be seeing a doctor regularly if you chest pains and ectopic beats are regular, and you have panic disorder. Are you on medication for these symptoms? If your parents know that you are drinking alcohol at 17 then they should be arrested, and you should be under psyciatric care.|`|nqDqTZKUaa	Are u kidding me.

I think it's been drowned away by everyone's other problems right now - especially when it comes to money - money problems always take the forefront.<br>  <br>  You know what - make sure you pass on what worked for you to others, and for people you see who don't know what to use, tell them.<br>  <br>  It will make a difference - however small it feels at first, it will grow.  They will pass on their new knowledge to others and you will end up helping a lot of others too.|`|vudF5lPiaa	Yes! I do agree and think it should get more attention!

Acne medicine should be marketed for specific conditions like dry and oily|`|sFFWLN5paa	Yes and no, what people need is education. learning what the acne is is what people need. Acnes are genetic abnormality on a person that can be passed on from one generation to the other. it also happens because of poor sanitation and lack of proper hygiene. if people were educated on this genetic status and its proper handling, no one would be ashamed. also if their families, teachers and friends really boosts them up instead of insulting and leaving them behind as people make fun of them then they won't have any other self-esteem problems. big companies that handle acne problems nowadays tend prey on these people who have acnes and their the ones getting rich while the people using their products(that really doesn't help especially when you're born with it) became hooked up on them...<br>  <br>  acnes are part of the normal phase in preadolescence that everyone experience/d, including the "perfect ones", and beauty products, although they help, cannot undo nature's way so the only left to do is know it and deal with it.<br>  <br>  <br>  fyi:(for some people who have their acne problem) your hands release an oil base thingy that irritates the pores on your face... so don't put your hands in your face or else a briade of zits will go marching on it on the next day.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	Then start a fund for it.<br>  <br>  Acne hardly really destroys the quality of life.<br>  I know people who have terrible skin, but they still enjoy life fully.<br>  <br>  there's honestly a lot of acne "cures" though.|`|CNSGz12zaa	Absolutely, acne is a life altering condition that effects self esteem which in turn effects everything about a person. It is a shame that many people cannot get treatment. We need universal health care so things like this do not ruin a persons life.|`|nCBdJkbEaa	well I actually believe plenty of attention was given to it.<br>  Everywhere we look there seems to be some new product concerning acne.<br>  <br>  I think the reason more people want more attention towards the matter is because those products and suggestions towards acne cures do not always work.<br>  <br>  But I think a lot has been done in that section.<br>  Many fail to realize that all could be avoided with keeping good health and drinking plenty of water.|`|Sn3vLXY5aa	well they do have proactive but people don't really pay that much attention to it because well, its not life threatening if it was a cure for it would of been all over the news.and hmm...yeah i think they should pay a little more attention.|`|SZZkfVzbaa	There is no cure for Acne, but i'm sure they can find one someday!<br>  <br>  Not to be rude, but I think finding a cure for Cancer and AIDS is much more important than Acne, because these are life-threatening; Acne is just on the outside.<br>  <br>  Xx.|`|zSpFXIrfaa	yeah.. i ******* hate acne

Watch for symptoms of a heart attack, which include:<br>  <br>  Pain or discomfort in the center of the chest <br>  Pain in the arms, back, neck, jaw or stomach <br>  Shortness of breath <br>  Breaking out in a cold sweat <br>  Nausea <br>  Feeling faint or woozy <br>  Symptoms for women are normally less specific, and include fatigue, trouble sleeping, feelings of anxiety, problems breathing and indigestion. Any symptom of heart disease is a reason to call your doctor. Don’t put it off if you suspect you’re having a heart attack. If you’re having a heart attack, chew one aspirin and call 911. Do not attempt to move or drive yourself to the hospital. <br>  <br>  Treatment<br>  Your doctor will order an EKG or an MRI to determine the state of your heart. He or she will then tell you what your treatment plan will be. Sometimes, a strict adherence to a healthy diet plan and physical fitness program will reduce your cholesterol and help keep your heart healthy. Some people will need to take cholesterol-reducing drugs or aspirin. Aspirin is a blood thinner – it helps blood pass better through narrowed arteries. You may also be given nitroglycerin if you are having a heart attack. <br>  <br>  Bypass surgery is used to unblock arteries that may be obstructing blood flow to the heart muscle. This surgery will be performed by a cardiothoracic surgeon. There are several types of bypass surgery, including standard coronary bypass grafting, which is open-heart surgery that allows the surgeon to create detours around the blockage. Off-pump bypass surgery means that the heart is still beating while the surgery is being performed. A minimally invasive coronary bypass isn’t as hard on the body; a keyhole incision is made and the mammary artery is used.<br>  <br>  Heart disease can be a frightening illness, but it is preventable by living a healthy lifestyle and eating a low-fat diet. There are many resources for heart disease online and through your hospital. You can always call your doctor if you have more questions.<br>  Weakness in an arm, hand, or leg <br>  Numbness on one side of the body <br>  Sudden dimness or loss of vision, particularly in one eye <br>  Sudden difficulty speaking <br>  Inability to understand what someone is saying <br>  Dizziness or loss of balance <br>  Sudden, excruciating headache <br>  In a Gallup survey, 97% of people over age 50 did not recognize the warning signs of a stroke. Everyone, especially those who are at increased risk for strokes, should learn these warning signs and know what to do if they occur. <br>  <br>  Seek help early. Since the 1980s, researchers have developed rapid, safe, and effective diagnostic techniques that accurately identify the extent and location of a stroke and the nature of the blood vessel (vascular) problem causing it. The goal of treatment is to restore blood circulation before brain tissue dies. The time frame for reaching this goal is frighteningly slim. Treatment usually has to begin within 60 minutes of a stroke to prevent brain cell death that is significant enough to cause disability..........by the way if you want to know more there is a ton of info online
K26ec4kLaa	Well, I was married to a heavy smoker for years.  Nobody can make a person quit.  They need encouragement, and  the desire to stop.  Money is a big factor these days if one doesn't care about their health.. You could suggest that Dad try joining a group who are trying to quit.. Nagging only makes it worse.. Now and then encouragement and expressing your worries about his health could help.. My now ex stopped when a neighbor whose wife got pregnant and he had promised to quit when she did, asked my then spouse if he wanted to make it a competition.. They both won the contest.. Both stopped!   So, that's another type of way to give it a good try... Maybe even have a little money pool among his friends if they are smokers and want to quit.  Not alot of money just a few as prize to the winner to devided if more than one winner.. Maybe you could handle it.. Smoking is one of the strongest addictions from what I've been told.. Good Luck to you, and your dad..|`|qe3NQIwgaa	when i was little my dad gave me and my brother and sister a talk about how bad somking was. so we banned together and started throwing them away, when he picked up the packs we put them individually in the toilet and didnt flush it so he found them. then he hid them on top of the fridge so we climbed up and continued.. <br>  <br>  lol well anyways, if i were you i would tell him exactally how you feel, and make sure you tell him how disapointed you are in him.. make him feel guilty for letting his son down.|`|hb1JkTOUaa	this may be a stupid answer to you<br>  <br>  you can put gun powder in his cigarettes just a little not a lot you don't want to kill him but it should explode in his face and scare him  real bad<br>  and he might stop|`|vossAma5aa	CHANTIX.com<br>  MyTimeToQuit.com|`|yB8ALg6Laa	Actually, my dad smokes a lot, too.

F7R4cgYGaa	Were you cold? If indeed it were your oxygen saturation levels, you would have other symptoms before your lips would turn cyanotic, blue or purplish in color. Are you restless, short of breath, or listless in nature? Typically discolored nail beds and lips are a very late sign of poor oxygen levels. If it persists, see a doctor. Have you seen the doctor for your really bad cold? Be careful. What may seem to be a "bad cold" may indeed be strep or pneumonia. <br>  Good Luck! Hope you are on the mend!|`|HKHCuRI8aa	put some of my root-sav(sp?) on it . LOL|`|Dv6KSxmlaa	Purple lips means you have poor oxygen reception in the less important areas of your body (such as lips). Only time I've seen a person's lips go purple was when they got carbon monoxide poisoning, which isn't cool either. If there are people living with you who aren't feeling under the weather, however, this isn't a problem. <br>  <br>  On the downside to this, it can also be related to heart problems and being too cold. Since you had a fever and the flu recently, however, I'm thinking it's just because of your sickness. Take a few deep breaths, make sure you get good oxygen, get well soon. <br>  <br>  Shouldn't need to go to the doctor, but keep a close eye on it.|`|FLeEdSTxaa	You are probably really dehydrated, drink some fluids and stuff.My lips turned purple and then white when I fainted and got a heat stroke. I drank a lot of water and took motrin, and I returned to normal in a few hours. Btw, 101 degrees isn't that great. If it reaches 103 or something like that, then you should go to the hospital or visit a doctor. My mom had a 104 before and she started seeing hallucinations.

eaCHJAneaa	Feeling down from time to time is a normal part of life. But when sadness takes hold and won't go away, it may be depression. More than just the temporary "blues," the lows of depression make it tough to function and enjoy life like you once did. A person with severe depression has little or no interest in work or hobbies, and may even have trouble getting out of bed. With treatment and help, you can feel better. Learning how to understand depression - including its signs, symptoms, and causes - is the first step to overcoming the problem. <br>  <br>  If you identify with several of the following signs and symptoms, and they just won't go away, you may be suffering from clinical depression. <br>  <br>  <br>  you can't sleep enough or you sleep too much. <br>  you can't concentrate or find that previously easy tasks are now difficult. <br>  you feel worthless and hopeless. <br>  you can't control your negative thoughts, no matter how much you try. <br>  you have lost your appetite or you can't stop eating. <br>  you are constantly irritated or become enraged even at small things - and this is new for you. <br>  you have thoughts that life is not worth living, or have a plan for how you would end it (Seek help immediately if this is the case). <br>  There's a vast difference between "feeling depressed" and suffering from clinical depression. The despondency of clinical depression is unrelenting and overwhelming. Some people describe it as "living in a black hole" or having a feeling of impending doom. They can't escape their unhappiness and despair. However, some people with depression don't feel sad at all. Instead, they feel lifeless and empty. In this apathetic state, they are unable to experience pleasure. Even when participating in activities they used to enjoy, they feel as if they're just going through the motions. The signs and symptoms vary from person to person, and they may wax and wane in severity over time. <br>   <br>  Hope that helps!!|`|URpJodMLaa	That's a hard question to answer.<br>  Because it varies from person to person.<br>  Some people may seem happy all the time when around others but when alone they may feel sad and worthless.

WX7pUlepaa	Vicodin is a pain killer which is also an opiate, and could cause damage to the liver if used in high doses over a long period of time. It can also prove to become very addictive if used extensively, and those taking vicodin on a regular basis may experience withdrawal symptoms like lack of sleep, uneasiness etc.<br>  <br>  The dosage of vicodin totally depends on individual factors like weight, age and also what other medication is currently being consumed by the patient. <br>  <br>  Vicodin, if taken on a regular basis, can be detected in the urine for a considerably long period of time. Generally a drug screen is used for employment purposes and vicodin showing up in the drug screen depends on factors like what kind of drug screen is used etc. Usually the drug stays in the system for around 24 to 36 hours, although one should stop taking in five days in advance to be completely sure.

There are higher levels of drinking than yours which involves tremor/shaking as a result of alcohol withdrawal. You case seems not as extreme. Although it SEEMS like the anxiousness is permanent, it goes away in a few days. the hardest part is breaking though those 1-3 days. Thats why lowerring the amount you drink each nite can be easier to do, but some argue it prolongs the withdrawal and would rather have just 36 hours of heavier discomfort.

2sycPf8Daa	Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are extra, abnormal heartbeats that begin in one of your heart's two lower pumping chambers (ventricles). These extra beats disrupt your regular heart rhythm, which normally starts in the upper right chamber (atrium). As a result, you may feel a flip-flop or skipped beat in your chest. Premature ventricular contractions are very common,they occur in most people at some point.<br>  <br>  Most people who have premature ventricular contractions don't need treatment. If you have occasional extra beats but you are an otherwise healthy person, there's generally no reason for concern and no treatment needed.If you have frequent symptoms or you have underlying heart disease, you may need treatment to help you feel better and treat underlying heart problems.<br>  <br>  Eliminate caffeine, alcohol, tobacco and other drugs are known triggers of premature ventricular contractions. Reducing or avoiding these substances can reduce your symptoms.<br>   Anxiety can also trigger abnormal heartbeats. If you think anxiety may be contributing to your condition, try stress-reduction techniques, such as biofeedback, meditation or exercise, or talk to your doctor about anti-anxiety medications. <br>  <br>  Take care as always!|`|pa7hVLAHaa	Usually when someone says that their heart skipped a beat they have a Premature Atrial Contraction.  These are usually benign and often caused  by an irritable foci in the atrium that occasionally fires off (in addition to the SA node).  In other words, one area of the heart contracts twice while another area contracts once and it feels like it skipped a beat.
e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	You are experiencing trismus.  It is very common when top back teeth are worked on (I'm assuming that area, since blood vessel nicks are most common in that area)  If it was the blood vessel, you would have bruising. In any case, for trismus, for top or bottom work, moist heat to the face.  Slide your lower jaw straight forward and hold as long as possible, several times a day.  This moves your jaw into a neutral position that relaxes the muscle.  After that, let your jaw drop back and begin some passive stretching by applying light pressure to the chin... lightly pressing down.  do a little more each day until the jaw can stretch wider.  This is a known possible reaction (I always get it when I have work done!!)  I'm not sure where your dentist was on the day of that lecture!
8IiygRi8aa	Had that problem in high school., use acne soap, works rely well, prevents breakouts and usually removes a lot of the problem within a couple days.  Oh and its cheap ^_^|`|Zt6eh6VRaa	For a start, you can get some Neutrogena On the Spot benzoyl peroxide and start of veeery slowly with it. Just wear it for 15 minutes a day. Then double the wearing time every three days. Then, when you are up to wearing it for 3 hours for 3 days in a row, then start wearing it overnight. You need to wear benzoyl everyday in order for it to work and not just "on the spot" but all over. It prevents the acne from forming in the first place.<br>  <br>  That will help your acne alot, but it usually takes more than that to get clear. <br>  <br>  I would love to help you with your skin problems.

w4xaujANaa	First off doing muscle training on top of that mnuch cardio is bad. Your going to stress your heart out. Cardio should be done during one half of the day and weight lifting in the other half. Like cardio in the am and weight lifting in the pm. As for the protein shake, it can be beneficial because..depending on how hard you train your muscles. They are aborbed very quickly into the bloodstream and go directly to the muscles. If you dont drink the protein shake and go and eat, the body has to break down and digest what you eat before any can go to the muscles. Protein shakes need not be complicated. A scoop or two of protein powder mixed with some coconut water or juice|`|pFGopYLFaa	they do work, but you can eat a can of tuna instead.<br>  also, if what you want is better results take some creatine, it will work.<br>  good luck|`|HrXqbQsUaa	You can eat fish instead of a protein shake.|`|wxzeKh4Iaa	It helps your muscles recover.|`|B12E4rYiaa	It's for the protein and extra calories so builders can gain muscle weight.

e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	I take it you are young and eventually, it will be painful and wear down tissue.  You could probably benefit from prolotherapy in the joint, the trouble is finding someone that can do it.  Traditional dentists typically don't seek out lectures about TMJ dysfunction.  Check with your local dental society to see if someone in your area is a REAL TMJ specialist (some just like to charge lots of money).  It will take several months of therapy, but you can get quite a bit of improvement in the joint

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	It is rare but occasionally a girl baby is born without a hole in her hymen and usually the attending doctor makes a hole while she is still in the hospital. It is called an imperforate hymen.  You need to take her to the pediatrician and have him take a look, as maybe the hole is so small you just can't see it.  When she gets to be a teen, she will need that hole for normal discharge and periods to come out of.

YOU DO NOT URINATE FROM YOUR VAGINA, might be an idea for some of you to google some images of the female reproductive system!<br>  <br>  Now to answer  -<br>  <br>  Female infants are normally born with a thin membrane (hymen) that surrounds the vaginal opening. In rare instances, a congenital vaginal blockage occurs that results in the absence of an external vaginal opening. The most common reason for this medical abnormality is an imperforate hymen — a layer of connective tissue that forms the hymen has no opening and thus the vaginal opening remains covered. Less commonly, obstruction is due to a high transverse septum. A high transverse septum is usually due to incomplete canalization of the vagina during development.<br>  <br>  Either of these can result in hydrocolpos, an abnormal swelling of the vagina, or hydrometrocolpos, abnormal swelling of both the vagina and uterus. <br>  <br>  Congenital vaginal obstructions are typically diagnosed in a newborn. Usually the physician finds an abdominal lump, which is the vagina swollen by substances from the cervical glands in response to the mother's hormones. Typically, an ultrasound will confirm the lump. Additionally, a needle may be inserted into the lump to inject dye for an X-ray examination or to withdraw fluids for analysis. <br>  <br>  If no abdominal lump or urinary symptoms are present, this condition may not be identified until puberty. At that time, the girl will fail to pass blood during her period, despite regular ovulation. She may also experience cyclical abdominal pain as well as a lump created by a buildup of menstrual blood behind the blockage. <br>  <br>  Treatment depends on the cause of the vaginal blockage. If the patient has an imperforate hymen, her urologist will make a simple incision that does not require anesthesia. Once drainage occurs, the anatomy should be examined for other abnormalities. <br>  <br>  If the patient has a high transverse septum, treatment will depend on its thickness and location. If this partition is in the lower third of the vagina, the surgeon can cut upwards to remove it, reconnecting the upper and lower vagina. If it is located more to the interior, the patient may require an approach in which either skin or part of the intestine is used to bridge the gap between the upper and lower vagina.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped?<br>  <br>  All the best xo

The key ingredient is not medication, lifestyle changes, or relaxation exercises. It is when the individual no longer fears the thought of having a panic attack. <br>  <br>  This may seem like a simplified and obvious observation but give it careful consideration. The one thing that has you searching for a solution to anxiety and panic attacks this very moment is the fear of having another one.<br>  <br>  The first time a person experiences a panic attack it can feel like their world is falling down around them. Nowhere feels safe as the anxiety becomes like a stalker lurking in the background. <br>  <br>  When this happens people begin to either avoid situations that make them anxious or they medicate themselves to the point where they are numb to the fear.

0e3034d2280fb2b424be0eff3932f8e1aa	Don't worry about getting decay that quick. The dentist office should have gotten you in ASAP. When a temp crown comes off the tooth could drift without it there to keep the space open resulting in the permanent crown possibly not fitting.  If you can't get in soon, there is temporary cement that you can purchase at the store. You will find it in the aisle with the toothpaste.  Place a very thin layer of the cement on the inside of the crown and place over the tooth. Bite down gently and hold for a minute or so. This should keep it on until you get to the office.  Avoid chewing anything at all on that side and if you floss around the crown, go down through the contact and pull out the side, not up.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	Try to get in on Friday.  Always a little hard with students.   They have a hard time handling regular patients and emergencies.  If needed, try contacting one of their AEGD residents.  The residents can plop the temp back on quickly.<br>  Your tooth won't decay in a short time.  Are you already waiting for a crown?  If so, then get the temp back in to stabilize the teeth.  You can try an over-the-counter glue, but my favorite dental school trick is to chew some sugarless gum, break off a little bit and roll it into a snake.  Fit it just inside the edge of the temp and then gently squeeze the temp back on. (avoid getting it directly under the area beneath the chewing surface... that will make the temp too tall and you won't be able to bite your teeth all the way together).<br>  If your student hasn't made the mold for the crown, then the temporary is for comfort.  If it's not hurting, leave it off.  If it is cold sensitive, try the gum trick.<br>  Good Luck and thanks for letting a student learn!|`|687852ecae21fabd1dfd4f89a2eefd48aa	It will not decay that fast.  Be very careful that is does not fall off when continuing to eat.  You could swallow it or damage it when biting down with another tooth.<br>  <br>  It will have to come off anyway so-o-o if you can remove it - it would be best.  You may experience sensitivity from the original tooth.  You may be able to place a small piece of a clean, warm,  moist, paper towel over it and keep it there until you can see your dentist?

No relationship is worth your mind body and soul completely breaking down.

AA11865529	You can have salads, but make sure you are getting enough calories. Otherwise your metabolism slows and it won't help you. So make sure your salads have other things, meats, cheese, nuts, proteins, etc. And forgo the dressings.<br>  <br>  If you aren't overweight, then you should concentrate more on stomach tightening rather than weight loss.|`|Gg7wc3Wpaa	Yes, but you have to take precautions about what you put on the leaves (salad) Some dressings have too many calories and grams of fat to make a big difference between eating a salad versus eating a burger. It's also important to be cautious about what kinds of other toppings you put on and the serving sizes. <br>  <br>  Also, darker leaves, like spinach, are better choices for you. Overall, salads are a much better food choice as long as you are concious of the dressing and toppings. <br>  <br>  Suggestion. Spinach with Kraft Free Zesty Italian with one hard boiled egg, red onion, low fat croutons. Pure yum! <br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless :)|`|9y5kT7hbaa	Yes really good!!|`|0jzF5SfPaa	yes its good! put a lot of veggies on the salad! and also use little dressing!!

nAp688tZaa	I am on Neurontin but it is because of seizures.  I was also tried on this medication last year, before the seizure diagnosis, to assist with the nerve pain that I was having in my shoulder.  Once I had the surgery, the nerve related pain disappeared.  I know that Neurontin can be used as a seizure med (which is what it was initially formulated to treat, a migraine preventative med (works for some people but never on me), and also a med to treat pain related to neurological disfunction (did work for me).  But I have never heard of this med being used to treat a cyst, of any kind.  Maybe your doctor thinks that the pain is neurological and that is what he is trying to use it for.  At 100 mg a day, this is an extremely low dose and I do not see how a dose that small could help any of the above conditions.  The smallest dose I have ever been prescribed is 100 mg three times per day, and I now take 400 mg three times per day as a secondary medication to treat my seizures.  If this medication is not working, and your doctor is not willing to either increase the dose or give you something else to try, then it is time to start looking for a new doc.  This medication is not indicated for the treatment of cysts, especially at such a low dose.  You need to find some relief and if this doctor is not willing to help you in finding that relief, find another doc.  Make sure you have copies of the records that show you have this cyst and make an appointment with someone else. I am so sorry that you have to feel this pain and the treatment is not working.  But, honestly, it is not indicated for this type of use.  My best advice is to see someone else, maybe a specialist that deals with throat issues, and get some treatment and advice from this new doc.  Good luck.

The therapist would teach you how to do the bodywork yourself.<br>  <br>  I've had lymphedema for 13 years. My foot/leg stays normal most all the time without the stocking because I do the bodywork 4 times a day, you can possibly get to that point.<br>  <br>  Lymphedema is broken down into 2 words. Lymph which is the colorless to milky colored fluid in your body. Edema, which means swelling. Lymphedema occurs when fluids build up in the soft tissues of the body. Lymphedema is pronounced: Lim-fee-dee-ma. It can be spelled a variety of ways such as lymphoedema, lymphadema, etc. All the various spellings mean the same condition.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lymphland.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lymphland.com/</a> is my website and you can read about anything and everything you ever wanted to know about lymphedema there.

Parents are usually that easy target.  <br>  <br>  If your mom really had only self-interest, she wouldn't drive you to school.  She wouldn't call you.  <br>  <br>  Do you know what kind of teenagers I've dealt with?

There is no gold medal...there is no million dollar prize.  All there is - is that natural care she has for you.<br>  <br>  As you grow up, you will realize more and more how much she actually did for you...and you will regret all the grief you gave her.  So I suggest that if you can just tell her that you'll talk when you're ready, and explain that you're still processing everything, then maybe she can understand.  <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, I suggest that you try and make the best out of this experience.  A new place is hard, but a lot of good can come out of it.  Think about it, you are new, you have a clean slate.

My dad never knew how I felt about them, cause I still loved him. I didn't hate my mom's new husband, should have cause he was a drug addict, but she handled it great. The first time he messed up, she went to the lawyer and filed divorce papers. I didn't know at the time, but I could just tell she was in control. It took his third mess up before the papers were ready, so she served him and kicked him out. My parents are back together, and they love each other. I know that they had a lot of healing to do, as did I. I said all that to let you know that I understand personally what it's like to have divorced parents, and it's possible for them to get back together. But that's their decision, and sometimes divorced couples can't forgive or reconcile. Sometimes they are happy with their new lives and have no interest in going back. I know that you feel that the move to the new place, maybe their seperation is a selfish thing for them to do to you. Also, you said you felt like your parent's trying to comfort you seems like they're selfishly doing it for themselves. Well, it's not so much selfish, they are trying to incorporate your happiness into theirs. To be more clear, they want you to be happy with them about their new lives and the move, to be happy as a family. In a way it is selfish because divorce is negative for the children, and you can't love the new person the same as your parent. But you don't have to, just love them a different way. I wish I could get all parents back together for all broken families, I feel parents have a responsibility for their children, the family is a whole. You live for your family, not for your own selfish needs. But the thing is, life isn't that simple, things can't always be perfect, crap happens, doesn't matter if you're a good person or a bad person. Maybe some type of counseling would help you, I don't know, I never had counseling, but I can tell you want a good relationship with your family and you want things better. Sounds like you don't enjoy fighting with your mom so maybe counseling would help that. Apparently your mom sees your unhappiness and wants to somehow fix it, but she just doesn't know how, and you two end up fighting instead of resolving issues. A counselor may help you guys resolve things, without the fighting.|`|sFFWLN5paa	there's so little that one understands in that state of age of a normal person.(though some has a wide range on understanding) you will understand all of the things you and your parents were feeling when you got older. i really think it's logical for you to feel that they suck because clearly i would think they are if i were on your shoes. no one should get married and have babies with just lust and without love. with them being separated in all makes them irresponsible and you're not to blame but that really happens sometimes and you just have to deal with it. after all, they're still your parents and you're still their child. you should respect them and ease up on the argument thingy. it's hard for them for you to be sad and all too, y'know. maybe you'll understand in the future if you're a mom then.<br>  <br>  anyway what you should do is try to find time to internalize and have a "systems approach" on solving the mystery on why i'm angry... it helps to find the root of your problem and how to deal with it. it also helps to widen the breadth of your understanding and help you gain your own wisdom at an early age. thinking of this as a positive thing rather than making it a negative makes you a happier individual and more productive than being mad, pessimistic and obnoxious in the future. take in mind that in your age you are developing your attitude and behavior and if you turn out all crazy and all you can't blame your parents and anyone but yourself...<br>  <br>  live your life and have fun! (^_^)v.. hope it helps...<br>  <br>  <br>  btw. i feel what you feel because i got my share of arguments with parents but you'll just laugh it off in the future.(that is if you didn't go overboard. that would totally end up you not talking to them for another 20 years then that's another problem... hope it never reaches to that... got a friend who's in that status...>_<)|`|pogH701Naa	First of all, this is not a lame question!!!  These are your feelings and it is normal to ask questions to feel better.<br>  <br>  I will start by saying that I remember while being a teenager, I fought with my mother constantly.  Everything she said or did annoyed me! This goes away with time!<br>  <br>  Although I completely agree that it is horrific that you heard what you did, you heard it and you need to move on from it.  Your mother bringing it up is probably not helping so if she brings it up again, I would just say, "hey...its in the past, please stop talking about it".<br>  <br>  Moving to a new town, into a smaller place (especially with no furniture) is very stressful whether you are aware of it or not.  Most likely for both of you.  If the move is really what is bothering you, I would just re-assure your mother that there is nothing wrong and that you are just adjusting to your new environment and you need some space.<br>  <br>  If there is something else bothering you, you need to open up about it.<br>  BUT REMEMBER.....arguing with your mother when you are 17 is NORMAL, as long as there is no mental or physical abuse, I would try to talk out your feelings as adult like as you could and remember this move is also straining on your mother.  Being a mother myself, I could honestly say that I think she wants you to be happy and probably feels like she may have made the wrong choice since you seem so irritated.  Hang in there!
AA10197127	I actually have that problem, small world huh?<br>  <br>  perhaps Obsessive Compulsive Disorder but not necessarily, unless you are "ridden with anxiety" it's not considered OCD.<br>  If you believe that what you do is COMPLETELY rational and there's nothing strange or wrong with you, then it may be Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder. That's about the only difference between the two.|`|YwYxff87aa	Sounds like a less severe form of OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder).|`|prqrQcd1aa	It could be just a weird obsession, it could be many things. I'm not a doctor, but yes, you could be diagnosed with a mild form of OCD by saying just this.|`|cp7fjeJhaa	yes it's called obsessive compulsive disorder, depending on how much it interfers with your life or drains your energy will determine if you should take medication or not.......you can google it to learn more about it......|`|ub6641d2aa	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, without a doubt.

0ehkP9qMaa	Yeah, but be reasonable! Don't try to lift 200 lb the first try, obviously! <br>  If you don't try TOO hard and you push your self to slowly increase what you can lift you'll be fine!|`|B12E4rYiaa	I see them doing it all the time at the gym with their dads but they only lift lighter weights, 13 is too young to build. You also need to be taught correctly so you don't get injuries.|`|mwm8iSBsaa	light weight<br>  and you need the help of a trained professional|`|ZwmQdZLZaa	It's really fine at any age, actually better if you start out earlier. The only things you need to keep in mind are that you should start out with weights that feel comfortable - nothing that feels too heavy, and some basic training to ensure no accidents.|`|5wchDj50aa	sure, just make sure you do it safely,<br>  and as everyone else has said use light weights.<br>  don't expect to get massively tank though,<br>  your body is a lot better at putting on muscle after puberty.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	only light weights.<br>  you can start really pushing yourself physically around 16.
FLeEdSTxaa	I think it really should. I do 60 sit ups twice a day, and I noticed that I did awesome on my PE final physical exam, so it should greatly increase your strength if you do push ups.|`|i1qpnUoJaa	no it doesnt work like that im sorry|`|Mn9zBuZwaa	No you'll be weak.|`|ZwmQdZLZaa	No, push ups aren't incredibly effective at making you stronger, you really need some serious strength training like weight lifting. But that aside, you won't be that much stronger if your only doing thirty push ups a day for a month, as you need to slowly increase the amount each week or so; and do the exercises for a longer period of time. It takes a half year of weight lifting to produce really noticeable effects (assuming you worked hard), so I'm afraid that push ups don't really cut it. As a side note, you don't want to only work on the biceps; if you do that, you'll eventually have a muscle imbalance (bicep muscles much stronger than the other muscles in your body), and you'll have plenty of muscle pains daily as a result.|`|zNn9VfRyaa	Yes u will be stronger at push ups but along the way u need to switch up the style of push ups. Also try pull ups. 30 days is good to try n test out diff styles. Like change up every new week the. Repeat. Wish u well

NJEzbr1baa	I've recently done a question on contact lenses:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219203952AAsWycL">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  As for how many go blind? If you consider how many people wear lenses, out of all of them, an extremely small proportion (< 1%). However, do you really want to be one of those?<br>  <br>  Always wear your contacts for the least time you have to, and be completely anal about hygeine when handling lenses, cases, and solutions.<br>  <br>  And no matter what anyone tells you, wearing your contacts overnight, or for an "extended" period (ie: more than 1 day straight) is a stupid thing to do, and makes it more likely you're going to be seeing me soon with a good going eye infection. The majority of people who have the really nasty infections and either lose the eye or require a corneal graft are normally the ones who wear (some of these are extended wear) monthly disposables.|`|aiBOMU9kaa	I don't know of any written statistics, but many people have lost their vision , in one eye at least because of the misuse of contacts.<br>  <br>  Neovascularization , keratakonus , and corneal ulcers have often been caused by over wearing, and/or soaking the lenses in tap water. All 3 of those conditions can lead to severe vision loss , including blindness.<br>  <br>  Corneal transplants have saved the vision of many...but not all.<br>  <br>  The vast majority of serious problems like that could have been avoided just by common sense.<br>  <br>  So many think they are smart by bragging that they don't take their contacts out for weeks, or keep the same pair for months. Those are the ones who eventually pay for it.|`|0505728aabf6d1f12318dd2e4d00717aaa	I don't think any have.

Everyone has it, even anorexics.|`|Z7dShLRLaa	Aslong as your okay with yourself.<br>  <br>  Thats all that matter.|`|5I3qy9H9aa	Why excess abdominal fat is more DEADLY than you think<br>  <br>  Below is an article contributed by Mike Geary, the founder of TruthAboutAbs.  I thought this was an important topic to share with you because the reality is that most people simply don't realize how dangerous their excess abdominal fat really is to their health.<br>  <br>  The Hidden Dangers of Your Excess Abdominal Fat - It's More Serious Than a Vanity Issue!<br>  <br>  by Mike Geary, Certified Nutrition Specialist, Certified Personal Trainer<br>  <br>  Did you know that the vast majority of people in this day and age have excess abdominal fat? The first thing that most people think of is that their extra abdominal fat is simply ugly, is covering up their abs from being visible, and makes them self conscious about showing off their body.<br>  <br>  However, what most people don't realize is that excess abdominal fat in particular, is not only ugly, but is also a dangerous risk factor to your health. Scientific research has clearly demonstrated that although it is unhealthy in general to have excess body fat throughout your body, it is also particularly dangerous to have excess abdominal fat.<br>  <br>  There are two types of fat that you have in your abdominal area. The first type that covers up your abs from being visible is called subcutaneous fat and lies directly beneath the skin and on top of the abdominal muscles.<br>  <br>  The second type of fat that you have in your abdominal area is called visceral fat, and that lies deeper in the abdomen beneath your muscle and surrounding your organs. Visceral fat also plays a role in giving certain men that "beer belly" appearance where their abdomen protrudes excessively but at the same time, also feels sort of hard if you push on it.<br>  <br>  Both subcutaneous fat and visceral fat in the abdominal area are serious health risk factors, but science has shown that having excessive visceral fat is even more dangerous than subcutaneous fat. Both of them greatly increase the risk your risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, sleep apnea, various forms of cancer, and other degenerative diseases.<br>  <br>  Part of the reason visceral fat is particularly dangerous is that it apparently releases more inflammatory molecules into your body on a consistent basis.<br>  <br>  If you care about the quality of your life and your loved ones, reducing your abdominal fat should be one of your TOP priorities! There's just no way around it. Besides, a side-effect of finally getting rid of all of that excessive ugly abdominal fat is that your stomach will flatten out, and if you lose enough stomach fat, you will be able to visibly see those sexy six pack abs that everyone wants.<br>  <br>  So what gets rid of extra abdominal fat? Is there actually a REAL solution beyond all of the gimmicks and hype that you see in ads and on commercials for "miracle" fat loss products?<br>  <br>  The first thing you must understand is that there is absolutely NO quick fix solution. There are no pills or supplements of any sort that will help you lose your abdominal fat faster. Also, none of the gimmicky ab rockers, rollers, or ab belts will help get rid of abdominal fat either. You can't spot reduce your stomach fat by using any of these worthless contraptions. It simply doesn't work that way.<br>  <br>  The ONLY solution to consistently lose your abdominal fat and keep it off for good is to combine a sound nutritious diet full of unprocessed natural foods with a properly designed strategic exercise program that stimulates the necessary hormonal and metabolic response within your body. Both your food intake as well as your training program are important if you are to get this right.<br>  <br>  I've actually even seen a particular study that divided thousands of participants into a diet-only group and an exercise/diet group. While both groups in this study made good progress, the diet-only group lost significantly LESS abdominal fat than the diet & exercise combined group.<br>  <br>  Now the important thing to realize is that just any old exercise program will not necessarily do the trick. The majority of people that attempt getting into a good exercise routine are NOT working out effectively enough to really stimulate the loss of stubborn abdominal fat. I see this everyday at the gym.<br>  <br>  Most people will do your typical boring ineffective cardio routines, throw in a little outdated body-part style weight training, and pump away with some crunches and side bends, and think that they are doing something useful for reducing their abdominal fat. Then they become frustrated after weeks or months of no results and wonder where they went wrong.
DdfZamKaaa	it's not going to kill you, but yes, it can cause some problems. I'd finish taking the pills + compresses if I were you...<br>  <br>  I know for a fact that osteopathic doctors, who specialize in OMT, can help. Do yourself a big favor and look up a D.O, who practices osteopathic manipulative treatment in your area. Call them up first and ask if they can help (chances are -- yes).  With their help, you may not even need the surgery. <br>  <br>  Goodluck

However, optometrists are able to do the calculations based on glasses without rechecking your eyes (assuming those numbers are recent and correct).|`|NpRT2PRxaa	yeah you should go to the optic place and show them ur presciption for glasses and dey figure out which contacts to give you .. i did that when i first started to use them 3 yrs ago|`|sbXdcurtaa	You'd be best with getting your eyes checked.

yhX02yuNaa	My mother was like that after she had a stroke.  She always calmed down if we agreed with her, no matter how "off the wall" her remarks were.

I know it's irritating as he!!, but trying to talk sense to her won't work.|`|15jfF0tKaa	I've been in nursing a long while and I will always remember an angel aid I saw work with a very nasty elderly woman recovering from a stroke. This lady cursed and hit. The aide just listened to her used soothing words and after the lady struck her, she hugged her and said I know your feeling ill and angry and I love you. It seemed that calm loving caress was just what this gal needed and she apologized.  I learned alot from this aide who explained to me the pain and frustration this invalid lady was experiecing.  Does your mother have a hospital bed and maybe she would be more comfortable in another room. If her husband snores or such. Be sure to mention this behavior to the doctor who may prescribe an antidepressent. And try to get some help for your care giving if you are overstressed.

Brush it off, it doesn't mean anything.|`|AA11806718	I feel your pain.  I am a nurse in a nearby hospital.  In spite of what people say usually elderly people on their way into confusion and early alzheimers begin to stay up at nite.  It turns into a fiasco.  Sleepless nights for an elderly person is an indication they may be developing dementia. Meds to help and elderly person sleep usually backfire and you must be careful about the medications prescribed.  Psychiatry usually gets involved to help us out on the problems with sleepless nites in the hospital, and they never use Lorazepam, Ambien, Valium etc....  A lot of drugs backfires in the elderly and create the opposite effect.  They do prescribe Haldol,  Restoril and one other drug I think is Zyprexa.<br>  You really  need to have your elderly person taken to a specialist for geriatrics who know how to control her mood and take care of her sleeplessness.  It may be as simple as keeping her awake in the daylite hours and a pain pill at bedtime with some Risperidal in a very small dose. Her symptoms may be the beginning of a journey into dementia, so be good to her, and understand she is not able to help herself.  She is anxious and cannot help it. <br>  Take care of your dad and maybe put her into daycare or get some help at home for them.<br>  Peace and good luck.
m9f9xWCEaa	Although I've never had periods as painful as the ones you are describing, I have had to go to a gynecologist because of irregular periods. There are different kinds of medications that a doctor can prescribe that control menstruation in different ways. <br>  If you are in considerable pain every month, you should definitely get checked out.<br>  If you are sexually active, the doctor should know, even if you don't want to tell a parent. <br>  It is good that you have been talking to your mom about this. Ask her to book you for a gynecological exam to figure out whats going on.<br>  I hope that you get your period under control. Good luck to you.|`|402001bd835df137698f75c2569b8406aa	Definitely go see a gynecologist first... and they'll probably run a few tests, like an ultrasound to rule out ovarian cysts and other such problems.  But more than likely they'll start you on birth control- to help regulate your body, and many types of birth control pills also help with cramps, heavy bleeding, and other unruly symptoms of menstruating.|`|mhK8opC7aa	Definately go to a doctor.  They usually prescribe a low dose of birth control pills to help severe cramps like yours.  On the bright side, I used to have severe cramps like that for about a year when I was around 16.  When I had my first baby (at age 30) labor was easy for me because it felt just like those severe cramps.  I was like, oh, I can do this, I've had this kind of pain before!|`|7HSGZhOAaa	You could have endometriosis.

B12E4rYiaa	The deal is that muscle burns fat that's why weight training when done properly for weight loss works better than cardio for weight loss, but shhh don't tell anybody they might learn the secret and lose weight.<br>  <br>  Listen to the friend if you want to really lose and keep it off.|`|8SRjELNBaa	It's more effective to build muscle as well, like your upper body and lower body for that matter.  Muscle is always burning calories, even while your sitting, and not doing anything.  The more muscle, the more calories you'll burn... not doing a thing! So building muscle is more like an investment in calorie burning.  <br>  <br>  It's probably harder to lose weight by just doing cardio. That is why it is important to do some weight lifting exercises at the end of a cardio session at the gym.|`|7HSGZhOAaa	You are right and your friend is right as well.  You can definitely lose weight by doing cardio exercises alone but that is a ton of work and you might get discouraged and give up after a few weeks. I suggest doing some cardio and some strength training since more muscle mass will increase the number of calories you burn doing your normal daily activities and the best way to increase muscle mass is doing strength training.  All in all, it's way more efficient to do both strength training and cardio and you shouldn't have a problem with getting bulky muscles if you are doing cardio as well because that works the muscle fibers that are specialized in using oxygen and these specific fibers create muscle that appears lean.|`|13a4553edcd55e39e57a5e00dc71c8edaa	I think running (cardio) is a great way to lose weight.  Losing weight is all about burning more calories than you take in, so yes, some light weight training will help you burn more calories.  But weight training(assuming that is what you are referring to)  a majority of the time?  No.  Very little weight training (one or two times a week using light weights with lots of reps) is plenty when combined with 3-4 days a week of running.  You will feel great!

Know that your weight loss is not going to make you a different person on the inside. Try to remember to go for healthy and not just skinny, a lot of people i know go for skinny and that can lead to serious problems.<br>  <br>  To loose weight you need to change two main things about your life:<br>  How much/How often you exercise<br>  Your diet<br>  <br>  It's healthy to work out at least 20 minutes everyday, and that means getting your heart pumping without slowing down for 20 minutes. This means you want to focus on cardio workouts such as running, jumping jacks, swimming, (etc.). <br>  I've found that swimming works the best because you're using the most amount of muscles at the same time and because the water's cold, you're burning fat just to stay warm!<br>  For different types of exercises you can go to <a href="http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/</a> sign up for free and you'll find a bunch of tips how to stay fit, including video demonstrations of specific workouts.<br>  <br>  Secondly, your diet. Eating healthy alone will help you shed those pounds because your body will be forced to burn fat instead of store it. <br>  Start by eating balanced meals that include protein, carbs, fiber, and as little fat as possible. Try not to over-do it on the carbs because carbs are energy and they get stored as fat pretty easy if you dont work it off. If you finish a balanced meal but you're STILL HUNGRY relax, this is natural we're just used to eating way too much. Go for some salad, fruit, or vegetables, because these things fill you up without weighing you down.<br>  When you feel you need a snack, eat fruit. Apples are good, peaches are very sweet if you have a candy craving and the BEST is to make a smoothie. I usually put in some cherries, banana, strawberries, blueberries, and grapes along with non-fat yogurt and ice (towards the end so it doesn't just end up as water).<br>  This may seem hard at first but if you can do it for a week, it gets easier from there--trust me!<br>  For more information on eating a balanced diet, you can visit <a href="http://www.mypyramid.gov/pyramid/index.h..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mypyramid.gov/pyramid/index.h...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|SR04mlQQaa	Stop eating everything except salad with no dressing. Drink only water. Take Once Daily Vitamins with a heart healthy granola bar in the morning. Sit in dry sauna for at least 45 minutes a day. Drink lots of water and sleep 8 hrs a night. It worked for me. I lost 47 pounds in 3 weeks like this.|`|oUFDH0Ztaa	stop eating mc donalds and eat healthy food|`|BSU9pNUWaa	There are so many things important to creating a workout. One you need to have the right attitude and motivation. Two you need to be eating lots of small meals throughout the day. Even like six or seven SMALL meals and make sure their healthy. A nutrition could help with this but there are also infinite sites that can help you build a positive meal plan. You also need to have a solid work-out plan. You need to be doing light weight training and heavy cardio. It's important not to start to fast because you'll lose motivation. Don't expect instant results, but if you work hard you will see results. Finally and possibly most importantly you need you have a positive life outside of the gym. If you are in a positive mood and have a happy work/social life it will allow you to exercise more effectively and it will allow you keep the needed motivation. If you want more information I would be pleased to help you, I've done plenty of work as a gym motivator and trainer.|`|EZ1cPPvkaa	One option that people don't always consider is fasting.  <br>  It can actually be a really healthy and detoxifying experience if done correctly, and of course it is almost a certain way to lose weight quickly.  <br>  You could do a juice fast, which most people choose for their first fast, or a water fast, which is a bit more difficult but very rewarding.  <br>  Fasting has gotten a bad rep but is actually very safe if you limit the amount of time it lasts for and make sure not to eat, even a little bit, during the fast because as long as you're not eating your body will essentially enter Starvation Mode and consume fat and other reserves that are meant to be consumed for energy.<br>  <br>  Do some research, it might be a good option for you!|`|K7n0DY8Faa	Diet pills and that kind of stuff. Being sexy has its price. if you wanna go the natural way, just dont take more than 2000 calories per day and burn more calories by jogging, (walking around also helps), instead of sitting, just stand up (especially after eating, helps you digest more properly) and exercise.|`|jQFk7KT4aa	depends on how much you want to lose.  if you really want a fast but uncomfortable way to do it buy something like evercleanse.  it'll drop 8-10 lbs off you in a week but you'll be crapping non-stop.  it cleans all the extra gunk out of your colon.

You have to keep your metabolism up,thus by eating a proper amount of food.BUT you should always understand that,exercise is key if you're trying to lose weight,tone up,or just trying to stay healthy.|`|J6UCHkeSaa	You can't judge the amount of food based off of the amount of calories. It doesn't work that way. There are meals that are high in calories.<br>  <br>  Diets don't work the same for everyone.

Don't eat until your full, just until you don't feel hungry.|`|caQB0VPvaa	No ha ha you are supposed to eat HEALTHY meals all day long. Its called the 3 hr meal diet. What they mean is that when you eat only one meal a day your body goes into starvation mode and instead of burning off what you ate it stored it away and slows your metabolism way down. If you eat small, healthy meals every three hours your body speeds up your metabolism and you burn what you eat a lot easier. This is the diet that the famous people use. Exercise helps a lot too. Hope I explained this well|`|E80A9WSXaa	Well the thing you have to remember is not eating a certain NUMBER of calories, but eating the right number of calories. For example, you can eat 2,000 calories of fruit a day and you would theoretically gain nothing (but fruit juice and fiber). But 2,000 calories of fat and carbs will probably mostly be stored as fat.<br>  <br>  600 calories is bad for a number of reasons, including that it puts you into starvation mode. But it mainly puts a major strain on your body to scavenge for energy and its really hard on your heart.<br>  <br>  Depending on your height and bone structure and level of activity, i would recommend--to anyone--a minimum of 1500 calories a day. Remember it's not how many calories you eat, its what KINDS of calories you eat. Eat lots  of fruit for snack and desert and try to exclude unnecessary fatty foods. <br>  <br>  Just change your eating habits, its really dangerous to try to restrict your intake of calories. I promise, you can loose weight the RIGHT WAY by eating just as much, but of different foods.<br>  <br>  <br>  Email or message me if you would like to talk about this some more. I'm happy to help.|`|RzilBdJdaa	It totally depends on your weight/height, as well as your age/gender...check out this website <a href="http://www.runningdeersoftware.com/products/dietgenie-calorie-req.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.runningdeersoftware.com/produ...</a><br>  <br>  It's true that typically if you each under 1000 or so calories your body'll go into starvation mode...your best bet, depending on your weightloss goals, is to eat no less than 1200 calories/day (it doesn't necissarily mean it's a lot of food - you don't need to stuff yourself, just eat healthy food!), and remember to WORK OUT. Your body needs nutrients, but if you're adament about loosin weight, just burn off the excess calories :)

If you stop getting the shot your hormone levels should return to normal and you will start getting your period again and will be able to conceive.

uxVIlXlvaa	i found myself in the very same place as you do now. im more than sure you have went through things that a normal 13 year old shouldnt. things you didnt deserve. either way, i felt the same so i know exactly where your coming from. you have aimless anger and feel like there isnt much to live for. anger is simply a side effect of depression. once upon a time i used to cry, then i stopped. its not as if i wanted to, it just happened. it just stopped. every time i did feel sad or feel like crying, instead of tears, i felt rage, and anger took over the depression.<br>  <br>  that being said, it will heal over time. i honestly dont suggest seeing anyone professional, as hearing "your depressed, you need to do that, you need to do this, you need to remain calm, you need to jot things down, find something else to do" it will tend to make you more frustrated as they try to honestly pretend to understand whats going through your mind. medications also make things worse, at least from my experiences, as it makes you feel even more helpless and dependent. all i can say for now is think about things. analyze them. know whats going on, and dont ever shut your self away from it, no matter what. and always keep yourself together, because if you fail to do so, it only leads to further mental deterioration.<br>  <br>  edit: yeah,  i know that feeling.  anger was the only emotion i also felt too, cause its all people ever allowed me to feel. at the time, i had no idea there were other things i could feel cause i was so numb with hatred. so i kinda just went with what i knew. i have done things i regret as a result, and now despite what people may or may not say, i know there is no making up for mistakes. the only thing i can do now is try my very best to make sure those mistakes dont get any worse. but listen. i dont want anyone to make those same errors. i had so many reasons to justify the bs that i used to do. death. backstabbing. i couldnt find love let alone comfort from the ones closest to me. it was like all other emotions were taken away from me, ya know? im telling you this cause i want you to know what your feeling isnt wrong. its not some teenage mood swing that people will dismiss on you. its pain that you bury deep into yourself and hide it with anger. im telling you this cause i want you to know you arent alone, k? if you need to talk, just contact me. im 19 now, and as a result of my life for the most part, i cant enjoy life like a 19 year old should. i should be worrieing about girlfriends, when the next party is, try to get the latest xbox game first. but i cant trust as i should. i cant love. the hate i felt years ago still carry on to me from years ago. i find most people to be down right disgusting. i have alot of friends, yeah, but i wear a mask to cover up my scars. i cant find reasons to go living as i know life is gonna be no different from yesterday. its like tomorrow is a memory. but it isnt too late for you though. i didnt have anyone to talk to, so if you ever need to talk, im here.<br>  <br>  sorry if i seeme to be rambling on about nothing. im tired, lol.|`|pVwyu6Fuaa	Hi,<br>  Sorry to hear you are feeling so low.

03rggPF2aa	something similar happened to me when i switched to a low dose pill a few months ago. the previous one i had been on let me purposely skip my periods, but when i switched to the low dose pill i found out that it only delayed the period, so i ended up getting it with a week of pills left and then after that i got another period, so it ended up being an 11 day period. thats probably what is happening to you.<br>  get off the low dose formula if it keeps doing that to your body after 3 months and get on a regular one. some women need the higher dose formula for it to be effective. i suggest ortho novum 777, but talk with your doctor about it to be sure it isn't anything too serious.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	there are only two reasons why you will bleed when you are on birth control<br>  <br>  1) you have stopped taking the pills (like at the end of the pack) or have missed pills which allows your hormone levels to drop and you experience "withdrawal bleeding" (you never actually get your period on birth control because you didn't ovulate, you get what seems like a period but is really withdrawal bleeding)<br>  <br>  2) You missed pills or took an antibiotic or your hormones did something really weird causing your birth control to fail and you actually ovulated. If you have ovulated approximately 14 days later you will get your period. <br>  <br>  It is best to continue taking your pills, but talk to your doctor and see if he/she wants to try you on a different type, dosage, or brand of pills. In the mean time you are most likely not protected against becoming pregnant and should be using a back up form of contraceptive.|`|1O9jE4P2aa	your fine. take your pills as directed. this is your body trying to get back on track|`|ZIyZRGftaa	When you miss a pill your body automatically begins producing eggs.  If you do not take them regularly your hormones do get messed up and it can cause an early period usually it takes a few weeks to get it back if you have repeatedly missed pills. I would not stop taking your pills but I would schedule an appointment with your doctor, you may need a higher dosage, it depends on what they recommend but DO NOT STOP TAKING YOUR PILLS, unless you are not sexually active or unless you will use another use of protection. It can take a month to regulate your body and have the pills working fully.  Go to the doctor!|`|Gq7p05fzaa	youve messed with your hormones a bit, ive done it and anyone who uses the pill does it at somepoint. you might be really bitchy or self concious or anxious also because of this. (pms intensly. its how i got.)<br>  it shouldnt be much to worry about, and if you continue taking them regularly it should end normally. <br>  <br>  but if anything happens that isnt normal period behavior, or you get truly worried, its better to check with your doctor than rely on answers.com. you know your body best, and if something feels way wrong you shouldnt ignore it.|`|5q8bUCN3aa	Well I do know that the last seven pills are what they call sugar pills or dummy pills that keep you in the mind set of taking a pill everyday but they don't have any med. in them to allow your period to come on with in those seven days .... so you should be good look at it like this the last seven pills are your period pills I hope this helped

Then that means you are going to have trouble doing so. You must do things that require you doing things that occupy your brain. Like read a story online like www.fanfiction.net or something like that. Or watch TV and drink warm milk (sometimes I add a little sugar) or I drink tea with milk and it is better. You have to tire yourself out. Does something need cleaning. Do laundry. Do something that is boring or that requires you using energy.|`|AA10797066	Pulling an all-nighter sucks. And anyways, that's kinda the opposite of sleep, right? lol <br>  <br>  Drugs aren't good, like NyQuil... just a quick fix until the next night you can't sleep, and developing a dependency on that stuff (or anything) is just weak. <br>  <br>  Sleeping pills are all addictive, and only work for a few weeks... when they lose power and you have to up the dosage, you're hooked. <br>  <br>  Warm milk sometimes does the trick, but this is also a drug (albeit a somewhat natural one) - the heating up of milk releases tryptophan. <br>  <br>  What works best? Seriously? <br>  <br>  Okay, I'll explain this as "in a nutshell" as I possibly can, but forgive me if it gets wordy. We'll get you sleeping in no time here. <br>  <br>  Now, there are some really good audiotherapy type things to try, and there's those that just suck, quite plainly. If it's just relaxing music, then it ain't happenin' - especially if you're awake from stress, too pepped up, anxious, or whatever. <br>  <br>  Subliminal stuff - works for some things, but not for sleep... you're dealing with a whole 'nother part of the brain there, peeps. <br>  <br>  The two best types of audiotherapy known thus far have had the most stellar results. What are they? <br>  <br>  The first type, is called "binaural beat" therapy. This uses soft music with an underlying, barely audible (but the brain hears it, believe me) pulses... two different ones, in fact. Or rather, the pulses are in two very slightly different frequencies, one for each ear. The brain then processes these two as one signal, which induces the proper brainwave activity, in turn, inducing sleep. <br>  <br>  The only prob' with that bit, is that it's too dang awkward trying to sleep with stereo headphones on, or rolling over earplug wire in your sleep, poppin' the thingies right out of your ears. That whole experience will just wake you up again. <br>  <br>  Ppffthth  <br>  <br>  The second and best type to work, is called "isochronic pulse"... this runs along the same lines, but you don't need stereo equipment - just a regular CD player in your room is just perfect. No muss, no fuss. <br>  <br>  Isochronic pulses are played in the background of soothing music, the pulses starting and stopping at certain frequencies that directly cause the perfect brainwave activity which is most conducive to deep, relaxing sleep. <br>  <br>  This last type even makes you sleep if you've had five double espressos with like, eleventy-two sugars in 'em! (Don't ask me how I know that :P lol) <br>  <br>  If you want a CD with this, or if you want to learn more precisely how this works, maybe try a sample soundbite or so, check out this website here; <a href="http://twurl.nl/4npkp6" rel="nofollow">http://twurl.nl/4npkp6</a> <br>  <br>  BTW, if and when you try it out, message me and tell me how you like it! ^_^  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps - heck, just reading this *novel* I've typed here might knock ya into a coma! haha|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	You might as well stay up and go to school.

AA10606659	Mushies are a great thing. However; in the event you dont have  really bad reaction and you do survive (not saying that you're probly gonna die, jusst playing devils advocate) , there are still some consequences. If your tounge feels raspy and youre  tripping this can be a very different kind of experience. Keep in mind you're hallucinating, raspy could turn into burning, crawling, or any other weird, scary, or creepy feeling. You may very well be fine, yet convince yourself that you're dying, because you're tripping. Not to mention, if you enter a trip worried that you might have a bad reaction, it will be on your mind the whole time, and you could create one. <br>  <br>  You're gonna do what you're gonna do, weigh out the pros and cons and see of you think its worth it. Keyword being YOU. Just keep a cell phone nearby just in case of emergency if you decide to try. At the same time you better be sure its an emergency, youll look really dumb tripping in a hospital bed with nothing wrong with you.|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	try portobello|`|9yP43Peiaa	Well im not gonna tell you not to do it but Shrooms can have a bad effect on anyone.

PyQhb7gCaa	You need the 3 products. The core products is Formula 1 which is the nutritional shake. Formula 3 is the protein and Teamix is to burn your fats.<br>  <br>  Okay I’m sharing with you my own experience .. Actually I consume Herbalife every morning and night, means I replace both my meals and follow it strictly. I take 4 scoops of F1 and 2 scoops of F3 per shake with 400ml of water, which means, 8 F1 and 4 F3 per day. I lost 1kg for the first week. It's just that you must take your shakes well and no cheatings like snacking or eating in between your 3 main meal, breakfast, lunch, dinner. You will feel hungry as your eating style for your shake is not right, that's all. <br>  <br>  I didn't feel hungry at all or have the intentions to cheat and eat when I am hungry. If at all I feel hungry, I eat fruits, that's all. It's just as simple as that. I lost weight with the normal products which you all consume too, the F1, F3 and teamix. I drink 1 litre of tea per day, means 3 to 4 servings per day (250ml per time). You also must remember that when you make your shake, if you add soya or anything to it, you are actually going to add in more calories and sugar into your meal. So try to avoid this kind of things in your diet :) Anyway, it's just as simple as A-B-C.|`|JWDXo2Juaa	if u are serious.<br>  i can help u. i won't give u pills, but i'll give u a food nutrition.<br>  email me: managinghealth@gmail.com<br>  Free consultation!!!

And say you do eat 300 calories a day and lose the weight, after spring break when you double your calorie intake, you body will store fat because it will think you are going to starve it again. Do you really think you can sustain that low of a calorie intake for the rest of your life? I'm only telling you this because I used to eat 300 calories a day and eventually, if you want to stay alive, you have to eat more and when that time comes your body will store fat like crazy. So, I would recommend you do something that you can sustain so that you don't gain tons of weight later.

When you go to college you will be so far ahead of everyone else it will amaze you.  3rd:  Life is ups and downs. I've been there, I sat in my bed wishing for the guts to end it all and guess what.  3 months later I felt totally different.  That's life.  See a shrink.  I did; it helped.

Now you are probably not going to believe me, but guess what.  It's all about positive thought.  When you think negative thoughts, distract yourself with positive ones even if you don't believe them.  Eventually you will believe them.  "Fake it till you make it".  Social anxiety;  Study people.

I knew someone who was going through an extremely bad heartbreak and suicide was on, "his to do list." He wasn't a friend nor someone I knew, but I talked to him because he seemed like one of those people that "you should avoid." I mean I saw everyone around him just seem to ignore him or avoid him completely. At first he was reluctant to say anything to me but I kept on and he finally told me everything. I gave him advice on what I though was best for him to do. He's my friend now and he's okay. The jist of what I'm saying is that there are people out there just willing and wanting to help. People that will make life seem worthwhile. Believe me there are people on this Earth that just want to help other people, believe me because I'm one of them.

cUWQPWjLaa	You are exhausted and are doing nothing to revive ur body. I suggest before going to bed every night take with u a warm cup of milk ( u can add hot chocolate powder in it if u don't like milk on its own). Put on some soft music in the background and just relax. Close ur eyes, drink up ur milk and just concentrate on ur breathing. See how soon u will fall asleep.

Intake of milk will give u strength too, so have a cup every night before sleeping.|`|opBGZzHvaa	I've had these weird sleep patterns before where i had to stay up all night because i felt like i was and wasnt tired at the same time.  The bad thing about that is that your body wants to nap at like 4 o'clock in the afternoon which only makes it harder to sleep later on.  So i just stayed up one whole day, and then didnt go to sleep that night and then stayed up the next day again and even though i was super tired, not hungry, and even faint. i made sure to eat lots and drink loads of water. and by 8 or 9pm i was ready for sleep and then i woke up feeling way better!|`|c6zymHmTaa	go tak a nap im guna go n tak a nap bye|`|yeKGxyXCaa	hmmm... try medication
D100ixUgaa	Don't think about building (or losing!) anything "quickly" at your age. Your body's still developing, and you can really mess yourself up and set yourself up for injuries that last the rest of your life. If you're not getting much bigger, you might not be producing the hormones yet that make guys bulk up. When you start producing them, you'll know, and you'll start seeing bigger gains from your workout. <br>  <br>  In the meantime, start getting your strength up, and, most importantly, learn PERFECT FORM for every lift you do. Seriously. Watch videos, read descriptions of the movement, and read bodybuilding blogs and forums. You'll get more gains from lifting 50 pounds with perfect form than you will lifting 100 pounds with crappy form.<br>  <br>  Secondly, make sure you're eating enough. You won't build muscle if you're not getting enough calories. If you have a fast metabolism, you might have to eat a LOT in order to gain muscle weight. Try scarfing down a bunch of pasta with meat sauce soon after you lift weights. And always eat as soon as possible after your workout (within half an hour is best, but within an hour and a half is mandatory).<br>  <br>  And finally, don't overwork your muscles. Two hours every day might be too much. Find some weightlifting blogs and forums and read the recommended workouts. Don't try to lift as much or as often as the pros, because face it, you're not a pro. Those guy have had years to condition their bodies to take all that abuse; you, meanwhile, are fairly new to this, so you need to give your muscles time to rest and grow.|`|y66VjrfLaa	i was thinking about it too...i found out it was a bad idea (im 14 also) id wait until your  done growing

94NYYq5Haa	transient depersonalization is pretty common, but the kind that rises to the level of clinical disorder is much more rare.  It's generally associated with psychotic illnesses or dissociative disorders, probably about 1-2% of the population.|`|mBAxzfV9aa	Depersonalization Disorder<br>  <br>      Depersonalization Disorder is a disorder affecting emotions and behavior. It is characterized by an change in how an affected individual perceives or experiences his or her sense of self. The usual sense of one's own reality is temporarily lost or changed. A feeling of detachment from, or being an outside observer of, one's mental processes or body occurs such as the sensation of being in a dream. This phenomena involves:<br>  <br>      A lasting or recurring feeling of being detached from the patient's own body.<br>  <br>      Throughout the experience, the patient knows this is not really the case. Reality experience is intact.<br>  <br>      The phenomenon causes distress or impairs work, social or personal functioning.<br>  <br>      The experience doesn't occur solely in the course of another mental disorder such as Acute Stress Disorder, Panic Disorder, Schizophrenia or a different Dissociative Disorder. (Fugue Identity).<br>  <br>      The disorder is not directly caused by a general medical condition or by substance use, including medications and drugs of abuse.<br>  <br>      Associated Features:<br>  <br>          Panic Disorder<br>  <br>      Differential Diagnosis:<br>  <br>      Some disorders have similar symptoms. The clinician, therefore, in his diagnostic attempt, has to differentiate against the following disorders which need to be ruled out to establish a precise diagnosis.<br>  <br>          Temporal Lobe Seizures ( epilepsy )<br>          Atypical forms of Migraine and Headache<br>          Schizophrenia<br>          Panic Disorder<br>          Acute Stress Disorder<br>          Another Dissociative Disorder - Fugue - Identity<br>          Drug of Abuse<br>  <br>      Cause:<br>  <br>      Depersonalization is the third most common psychologicical experience, after feelings of anxiety and feelings of depression, and often occurs after a person experiences life threatening danger, such as an accident, assault, or serious illness or injury. Depersonalization disorder has not been studied widely, and its cause and occurrence in the population are unknown.<br>  <br>      Treatment:<br>  <br>      Depersonalization disorder often disappears without any form of treatment and therefore professional treatment is usually recommended only if the disorder persists, recurs, or causes distress. Psychodynamic psychotherapy, behavior therapy, and hypnosis have been effective for some people. Depersonalization disorder is often associated with or triggered (precipitated) by other mental health disorders, which require treatment. Any stresses associated with the beginning of the depersonalization disorder must also be addressed.<br>  <br>      Counseling and Psychotherapy <br>  <br>      Psychotherapy and Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is also very helpful especially if panic disorder is involved.<br>  <br>      Pharmacotherapy :<br>  <br>      While there are no proven medications for the treatment of Depesonalization Disorder, Sedatives and antidepressants help some people, also the benefit of the use of antianxiety agents clonazepam; stimulants methylphenidate; and MAOIs phenelzine may assist the patient.|`|XUkYVp3Uaa	many times drugs are a cause. hallucinogens and stuff.<br>  I know that people who have it, usually get it after they're depressed or have some sort of mental disorder. <br>  <br>  That's all the ones I know

I feel deeply for you in this situation...<br>  <br>  Now to my understanding and from past experience with that area, you may have stretched your anus, but it seems to go back to normal (or almost normal) after about 18 - 24 hours....   Now i can't exactly tell you that yours will go back to normal or that you should wait and see, but in most cases it does.  <br>  <br>  If you don't feel comfortable going to the doctors right now, perhaps wait a few hours, but keep up your liquids and maybe eat something that will put something of substance in your stomach (like some bread, or some biscuits).  <br>  If you are normally constipated this might just be the release that was coming, with or without anal sex, it could be just a classic case of bad timing!<br>  <br>  Might be wise to have a shower and clean yourself up, and if this doesn't subside, in a few hours please at least call a doctor and chat to them about it.  They will be able to provide you with more accurate answers.<br>  <br>  Please let us know what happens, i would like to know for my own information and to make sure your ok...<br>  <br>  All the best xo|`|BIyiOgPYaa	Your rectum could possibly be permanently damaged because you may have stretched it too much too soon.

Qnklk4uOaa	when you are laying down, your blood vessels relax or dilate and your blood pressure goes down. when you stand up, your blood vessels need to constrict so your blood can reach your brain (being the highest part of your body now).<br>  When you stand up, your blood pools to the bottom because there isn't enough pressure, then your blood vessels constrict causing enough pressure for the blood to get up to your head.<br>  <br>  You 'white out' as I like to call it... during the time that your brain isn't receiving sufficient blood.<br>  It happens to everyone, some more than others, and isn't anything to worry about.<br>  <br>  That all said... if it's happening to you frequently or even when you haven't been laying down for a long time you might have a lack of iron in your diet.

Its so good for you too!|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	I wouldn't eat too much at one time, although I do have a friend that takes it in a liquid form and adds flax seed and orange juice to it for his daily deal, he had some stomach surgery and I've tried the drink myself.|`|jYTL8bm5aa	I do not recommend it. I've heard of people getting overzealous with it and having stomach bleeding.
JdwogVjAaa	no its not<br>  you could have a heart attack dont take them
dkydcxNhaa	Wow, I don't know (and your probably gonna be annoyed by this), but I just had to say this is an awesome question. I am not being sarcastic, I read this and I just said, "Wow, that is a really good question." I will be reading the answers to this.
GO46i2l9aa	Honestly that is all up to you.  I think it just depends on your bra size. Becuase my cousin and I have pretty large breasts and wear a regular bra underneath our sports bras. So if you are just wearing a sports bra and you feel like you need the support you could go for one with underwire.  If you just like being comfy in a regular one go for one without it. I know if I didn't need so much support I'd go without the underwire.|`|dzqxQmpFaa	There are some that do, but yuck. Sports bras are designed to give support but mainly minimise the movement (flatten them basically) - there are heaps of different styles. Underwire is uncomfortable - you'd be worrying to much about the discomfort than your performance|`|VEfh03cAaa	it depends on the support that you need. if you have a heavy chest and you are doing a high impact sport (running), then you might need one. if not then a less supportive bra will do just fine. Under armor has a good selection.|`|166jtzSBaa	No, because usually, a sports bra is not made for support, but comfort. It basically keeps everything inside the shirt while jogging or something. A wire is NOT comfortable.|`|XqAfAWmoaa	no probably not, i mean it's personal preference.<br>  <br>  but sports bras are both for comfort and to stop them from (excuse me) hitting you in the face.|`|ABsEvDCraa	cuz its a sports bra and theyre are for SPORTS or ACTIVE things?? isnt that supposed to require a bit of comfort?|`|84fm7wskaa	no a sport bra doesnt|`|WeNWlYT4aa	Don't worry about the sport bra. The boys will thank you.|`|LzzTpVEUaa	Not unless you like having metal poke you while you run...|`|AA10097424	Im with Ferro|`|oUV9ZUsEaa	no, because it's annoying to have wire under your boobs while running or whatever.|`|AA10975334	No, because they are for comfort especially when you are working out or involved in sports activities. I know for certain that when I am working out or playing some type of a sports, I want to be as comfortable as possible, I don't want an underwire pressing against me.|`|EKoRHgdgaa	No, you should not have an underwire in a sports bra (that is dangerous in my opinion)!  If you need more support, try wearing two sports bras.   :o)|`|LBYvzDx0aa	no, because thats uncomfortable when you're playing SPORTS.|`|aNIiGpzeaa	i dont think so. it would probably be very uncomfortable|`|sCuumWVTaa	Dude it hurts to run without any support
5I3qy9H9aa	Why excess abdominal fat is more DEADLY than you think<br>  <br>  Below is an article contributed by Mike Geary, the founder of TruthAboutAbs.  I thought this was an important topic to share with you because the reality is that most people simply don't realize how dangerous their excess abdominal fat really is to their health.<br>  <br>  The Hidden Dangers of Your Excess Abdominal Fat - It's More Serious Than a Vanity Issue!<br>  <br>  by Mike Geary, Certified Nutrition Specialist, Certified Personal Trainer<br>  <br>  Did you know that the vast majority of people in this day and age have excess abdominal fat? The first thing that most people think of is that their extra abdominal fat is simply ugly, is covering up their abs from being visible, and makes them self conscious about showing off their body.<br>  <br>  However, what most people don't realize is that excess abdominal fat in particular, is not only ugly, but is also a dangerous risk factor to your health. Scientific research has clearly demonstrated that although it is unhealthy in general to have excess body fat throughout your body, it is also particularly dangerous to have excess abdominal fat.<br>  <br>  There are two types of fat that you have in your abdominal area. The first type that covers up your abs from being visible is called subcutaneous fat and lies directly beneath the skin and on top of the abdominal muscles.<br>  <br>  The second type of fat that you have in your abdominal area is called visceral fat, and that lies deeper in the abdomen beneath your muscle and surrounding your organs. Visceral fat also plays a role in giving certain men that "beer belly" appearance where their abdomen protrudes excessively but at the same time, also feels sort of hard if you push on it.<br>  <br>  Both subcutaneous fat and visceral fat in the abdominal area are serious health risk factors, but science has shown that having excessive visceral fat is even more dangerous than subcutaneous fat. Both of them greatly increase the risk your risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, sleep apnea, various forms of cancer, and other degenerative diseases.<br>  <br>  Part of the reason visceral fat is particularly dangerous is that it apparently releases more inflammatory molecules into your body on a consistent basis.<br>  <br>  If you care about the quality of your life and your loved ones, reducing your abdominal fat should be one of your TOP priorities! There's just no way around it. Besides, a side-effect of finally getting rid of all of that excessive ugly abdominal fat is that your stomach will flatten out, and if you lose enough stomach fat, you will be able to visibly see those sexy six pack abs that everyone wants.<br>  <br>  So what gets rid of extra abdominal fat? Is there actually a REAL solution beyond all of the gimmicks and hype that you see in ads and on commercials for "miracle" fat loss products?<br>  <br>  The first thing you must understand is that there is absolutely NO quick fix solution. There are no pills or supplements of any sort that will help you lose your abdominal fat faster. Also, none of the gimmicky ab rockers, rollers, or ab belts will help get rid of abdominal fat either. You can't spot reduce your stomach fat by using any of these worthless contraptions. It simply doesn't work that way.<br>  <br>  The ONLY solution to consistently lose your abdominal fat and keep it off for good is to combine a sound nutritious diet full of unprocessed natural foods with a properly designed strategic exercise program that stimulates the necessary hormonal and metabolic response within your body. Both your food intake as well as your training program are important if you are to get this right.<br>  <br>  I've actually even seen a particular study that divided thousands of participants into a diet-only group and an exercise/diet group. While both groups in this study made good progress, the diet-only group lost significantly LESS abdominal fat than the diet & exercise combined group.<br>  <br>  Now the important thing to realize is that just any old exercise program will not necessarily do the trick. The majority of people that attempt getting into a good exercise routine are NOT working out effectively enough to really stimulate the loss of stubborn abdominal fat. I see this everyday at the gym.<br>  <br>  Most people will do your typical boring ineffective cardio routines, throw in a little outdated body-part style weight training, and pump away with some crunches and side bends, and think that they are doing something useful for reducing their abdominal fat. Then they become frustrated after weeks or months of no results and wonder where they went wrong.|`|HrXqbQsUaa	I would say slowly start on a treadmill. THat should help.|`|HINny8cGaa	swimming tones all of your body while streanthing you core. its the best!

Recommendations would be, cellary sticks, baby carrots, nutri- grain, and alot of water after every meal. Remember, the only way that you can lose weight is by losing more calories, then you take in.
Zt6eh6VRaa	yes, I got shingles in my 30s. In my right eye!! I could've gone blind. Thank god they had just discovered the antiviral zyvorax and it knocked it right out. (not my eye).<br>  <br>  i don't know about the carrier question. All's I know is that I gave three of my clients chicken pox when I had the shingles.|`|mAp90hEeaa	Anyone can get shingles, including your husband.  Having chicken pox does not protect him from this.  And, yes, you can spread it to him.  Wash your hands well after having contact with the area.  For more information, you can go to WebMd and type in shingles and read up on this condtion.
kjqjrZSeaa	I got shingles last year when I was 29.  If you have had chicken pox the virus remains dormant in you nervous system for the rest of your life.  Unfortunately, if the body is prticularly stressed or run down, it seizes its opportunity to make a reapperance but under the new guise of 'shingles' same 'orrible virus, new form.<br>    As you probably know, the virrus in not treatable, only its symtoms which will always happen in the same order...the rash eventually blisters and it is this that will cause anyone who has not had chicken pox to be at risk of infection, then after they dry up it is a healing process and HONESTLY the scars will dissappear over time butthe burning sensation of the blisters can be helped with calamine lotion and pescribed pain killers and THEN if thatat is not bad enough you can suffer from Post Herpatic Neuralgia which brings with it phantom nerve pain and depression BOTH OF WHICH PASS!!!<br>  Take St.Johns Wort throughpout the run of this thing so that you can build up a resistance to the mild depression- I found myself just bursting into tears at the most random moments!<br>  Please, just keep treating the symptoms as they come and it will pass and get better within two months max-I didn't know what was going to happen until they happened which is why I am telling you so that you can prepare, unlike me!<br>  I really hope you feel better soon-please do not get scared by everything I have just said, I am only trying to be helpful and fore warned is fore armed as they say!<br>  I hope this helps and just remember that the period of being contagios is as long as the blisters are open and on to those who have not had CHICKEN POX not to those who have-it cannot bring about shingles in others. <br>  Best Wishes, Ellie|`|Fit17SnVaa	I acutally had shingles in my early 20"s. The older you are when u get them the more serious they can be. You can pass shingles when they blister and are liquid filled but you do carry the virus in your system so unless you came in contact with someone else with shingles they probable came out on there own. Just be careful when around your husband and limit contact for a week to make sure your no longer contagious|`|5QKAuezOaa	I had shingles in my 30's. Shingles is the chickenpox virus which lays dormant in your system until  usually something stressful causes the virus to erupt. No, your husband will not give anyone the virus.|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	Quite possible to contract. Had the pox at 32 and shortly after got mild shingles. Don't believe he can be a "carrier"
jPxkg7vKaa	In order to get the best picture, the healthcare worker must have access to your chest. It's not meant to be personal and you won't be exposed the entire time you're having the ECG done. In fact, the ECG won't take all that long and you'll be out before you know it. The person performing the actual test is more concerned with just that, the test. And you should be too.<br>  <br>  Believe me, we, as healthcare providers have seen everything. We're not judging you and you have no reason to worry. Hospital gowns suck, everyone is in agreement with that. They either cover everything or just barely everything and they are too thin. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about something that trivial. It'll be ok.|`|mAp90hEeaa	The techs are very professional and need to access your left breast area in order to get the best pictures.  You may be self-conscious but the tech is concentrating on getting good pictures, not what your breast looks like.  Just tell yourself it is something you have to do in order to get a proper diagnosis and forget about it.  You will have a hospital gown on with the opening in the front so that they can put the gel where they need it and then the wand to get the pictures.  You will be covered until they start the test. The techs try to maintain as much privacy for their patients as they can and still perform the test.|`|QIc2Ue52aa	You could always request a female tech if they have one.
ccnH77SOaa	If I work out first thing in the early morning I don't eat breakfast and if I don't I eat breakfast and wait an hour and then go to the gym.  I also eat healthy...like oatmeal or fruit so it really doesn't matter if I eat before or after a work out.  <br>  <br>  If you are eating an unhealthy breakfast than this will have a side effect on your work out.|`|26C8ILiJaa	The formula for losing weight is not difficult - consume less and exercise more - the issues appear when we really try to put that into practice! There are a lot of stumbling blocks in the big wide world don't you think?! The sole method that definitely worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a few free trials left, it was featured in Reader's Digest and CNN. I shed thrity pounds, it definitely does produce success!|`|lTRMlAS9aa	eat a healthy breakfast cause usually after workouts some <br>  people binge cause they are hungary|`|ytQfxuPyaa	Yes, eat breakfast to give you the energy for the workout. if you can eat protein at breakfast time, that helps. Exercise increases your metabolism and burns fat.
rt4OnxkYaa	call and talk to a nurse and see what they say.. but if u are really worried about it def go to the hospital..goood luck!|`|VfA3OoU9aa	yes you should go.  a uti would cause pain more in the lower region of your back and also cramping.  since you have a fever and chills and stomach pains you could be having a appendicitis.  I would def.  go to the hosp.

smKrIXYSaa	Hi Sammi<br>  Sorry to hear you are having side effects.<br>  Not everyone on Sertraline gets these same side effects as you are having. If you are not happy with your situation go back to your GP.<br>  He may well be able to prescribe an alternative.<br>  <br>  <br>  Peace of mind is yours by right|`|ParFJxnSaa	ZOLOFT: Side Effects of This Medicine<br>  Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention. One rare, but very serious, effect that may occur is the serotonin syndrome. This syndrome (group of symptoms) is more likely to occur shortly after an increase in sertraline dose.<br>  <br>  Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:<br>  <br>  More common<br>  <br>  Decreased sexual desire or ability; failure to discharge semen (in men)<br>  <br>  Less common or rare<br>  <br>  Aggressive reaction; breast tenderness or enlargement; ***  fast, pounding, irregular, or slow heartbeat; *** fast talking and excited feelings or actions that are out of control; fever; inability to sit still; increase in body movements; loss of bladder control; low blood sodium (confusion, convulsions [seizures], drowsiness, dryness of mouth, increased thirst, lack of energy); muscle spasm or jerking of all extremities; nose bleeds; red or purple spots on skin; restlessness; serotonin syndrome (diarrhea, fever, increased sweating, mood or behavior changes, overactive reflexes, racing heartbeat, restlessness, shivering or shaking); skin rash, hives, or itching; sudden loss of consciousness; unusual or sudden body or facial movements or postures; unusual secretion of milk (in females)|`|a3ZZkY08aa	weight gain, diarrhea, problems sleeping, change in appetite
AA10288830	You are on the right track. However, i would suggest a few changes. <br>  <br>  Day1  Chest and Back / bike for 20-30 minutes<br>  Day2  Arms and Legs  / walk or jog for 20-30 minutes (no shoulders)<br>  Day3  Cardio I suggest interval training (2mins run / 2mins jog) for 60mins<br>  Day4  Hit shoulders and abs and go swimming for 30mins<br>  Day5  OFF (If you really want to, you could probably hit chest/back again)<br>  Day6  Core exercises<br>  Day7  OFF<br>  <br>  It really doesn't matter how long you go weight lifting for, just that you hit all the muscles planned. <br>  <br>  I always do shoulders separately because from experience, i can never do shoulders at the intensity i need after lets say chest, or arm workout. <br>  <br>  Seems to me that you are not eating as much as you should. Plus the diet will get monotonous after a while. Try eating a balanced diet. Don't always have to stick to certain foods.   <br>  <br>  Remember, it takes about a month of continued training to see visible results.|`|jQF99S0Xaa	you need different things to eat, you cant eat that everyday 7 days a week for 365 days a year. but besides that the exercises look good.
VHVkgzKmaa	Yaz made me feel awful in every way shape and form. I had cramps all month, discharge all month, and yes, I do think it made my mood different. It was more anger and irritation then depression and sadness. I would never recommend it to ANYONE but everyone's body is different and I'm sure it works just fine for others. Just so you know, Yaz does have some weird side effects for some people, and if you are experiencing them, you may want to switch.
e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	The first sign of gum disease is bleeding gums.  Some people say bleeding gums is normal, and yes, it's normal for people with gum disease.<br>  As a child between the ages of 6months to 3 years, we are infected by the bacteria that our parents or caretakers have.  Over time and poor oral hygiene, the bacteria build up.  If you have acid producing bacteria, you get cavities.  More often, people have a combination of bacteria.  If the bacteria get well established over several years, the release "cytokines" into your blood stream. This chemical alerts all other bacteria, viruses, and parasites to come join the party.  This is why, once gum disease is started, it's hard to stop.  The parasites simply move into the gums while cleanings are happening, then move back out when the coast is clear.  Simple brushing and daily flossing are all that need to happen(in addition to regular cleanings) to keep your mouth healthy.
w5l7De7Daa	About a year, if you do it healthily.<br>  <br>  My friend who's anorexic lost it about 80 pounds in a year and she ran 4 miles every day and barely ate a thing. <br>  It's pretty hard to get off the last 10 pounds.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  No matter what, think of if that donut is really worth people respecting you more and boys liking you better, and fitting into those size 0 jeans!

Since you just got your period it's going to be irregular a lot and you may even skip one sometimes.

AA12316174	My 1st Mirena I had inserted in 2002 and after a wonderful experience I had a new one inserted at the time of expiration in 2007 in July 2008 I had it removed even though 3 DR told me I was crazy and it was not the Mirena causing 40 pound weight gain in 10 months with no life style change, severe acne, back pain and nausea. After only 3 months after removal it ALL cleared. You are not alone there are many side effects that are not listed. Many woman have had weird side effects that DR keep dismissing as not a side effect however after removal they notice it is gone. I have heard of a cloudy mind, forgetting things and many more.

Is it always as high?<br>  142 would be normal weight if you re tall but if you re short then the excess weight can cause blood pressure to rise because your heart need to work harder because of the weight. See a doctor. You can start cutting down on high sodium, saturated fats and sugar and you should exercise a little bit.|`|msNXomjTaa	High!<br>  <br>  Normal is 120/80.  Over 140 is serious - enough to be medicated.<br>  <br>  However, this can by "white coat syndrome" - where nervousness at the doctor's office elevates blood pressure. OTOH, this is high enough to be a concern, especially as hypertension can be deadly, but have no overt symptoms.  <br>  <br>  You can get your own blood pressure monitor for home.  They are not very expensive.  You can track the readings over time, to see if this was an anomaly, or something more serious.|`|4onT0qUxaa	That is a little high for someone your age. You should check it once a week and keep a log, then take it back to your Dr. so he can review it.|`|a9BYPzKxaa	120/80 is usually the norm but if your doctor didn't express concern then you should be fine.  After all, your doc is the one who has your full history.  It is slightly high though, maybe due to stress or anxiety at the time it was taken...I dunno.  Good luck.

xTm5hK4vaa	I definitely have experience with traveling and getting your period out of nowhere.  When I was 13 I was oversees and the stress due to traveling caused my period to come WAY early and I had literally nothing and we were in the middle of the jungle.  <br>  If you're worried about staining when you sleep, it would be a good idea to where a tampon AND maxipad at night.<br>  One thing, try not to be embarrassed about it.  There will probably be other girls going through the same thing, but if you are worried about being discreet, just be sure to always have some supplies close to you (in your purse for example).  If you are close enough with your mom, she would be a great resource too.  <br>  Dark pants are always a good option if you are worried about leaking because you don't feel like you can change whatever you're using enough.  I'm not sure how you're traveling, but you can probably be assured that you'll be making stops enough times that you'll be able to take care of business.<br>  I've never used midol, but ibuprofen works pretty well, and so does rest.  So if you are feeling crummy, take a nap if possible.<br>  <br>  Hope some of this helps!|`|EnYLhQajaa	Don't sweat it. If it is around your period, bring all of your supplies, and some midol. Tell your mom so knows what's going on, and do whatever you need to do. Good luck.

You may need medication, a heart-healthy diet, and supervised exercise.|`|AMwe70oWaa	No it is not possible to reduce existing plaques. These plaques are very similar to scar tissue in composition, which is no surprise since they are the body's response to injury. They cannot be simply dissolved by fish oil omega 3 fatty acids or any other dietary substance.<br>  What you can do is keep the arteries 'elastic', so they can expand and allow for these plaques.<br>  <a href="http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/95/1/26" rel="nofollow">http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/conten...</a><br>  It seems that Vitamin K may play a role in ensuring that calcium ends up in the bones rather than these plaques, thus preventing hardened arteries. <br>  <a href="http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/71/5/1201" rel="nofollow">http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract...</a><br>  <a href="http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/109/7/2823" rel="nofollow">http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.or...</a>|`|jAmVRbICaa	Omega 3 fish oils will help dissolve plaque in arteries.

HlD9dRF2aa	80% of headaches have something to do with your stomach -- either not eating enough or having eaten something badly.  19% have to do with stress or blocked CHI.  Have an apple at 4 or 4:30pm and see what happens. Or take a little rest after school. It could be sinusitis from allergies or perhaps your blood sugar is dropping out.  Go see a doctor if the problem continues to be chronic.  <br>  <br>  It is definitely not normal until you have kids, have a horrid boss, and need to figure out how to pay the mortgage and do your taxes by tomorrow.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	who knows?  drink lotsa water, eliminate caffeine, eat frequent balanced meals, and keep a headache diary.  follow up with a neurologist.|`|gLno6BNZaa	Ok calm down take a few deep breaths,you'r normal,i use to suffer from heaches everyday too,they went away ,dont scare yourself or let anyone diagnose unless they are a doctor.You might be suffering from your vision? migraines? allergies that block the sinuses,see your family doctor,but yea dont be scared,relax it could be nothing.There is non prescriotion mediction that you can try that has helped me,<br>  advil, tylenol extra strength, ibufrofen, nasal spray can help with seasonal allergies,....give those a try and go see your doctor and dont think the worse,,dont beleive everyone if they say things to make you more scared,only a doctor can diagnose you and treat you,but dont worry ,relax ,laugh laughing is a good cure#1 <br>   gooodluck ,take care<br>  ps everything is ok and you are normal|`|NodtO4leaa	well myself i used to get headaches constantly before i got my period. then after i got it for the first time it pretty much went away for a while then when i hit 16 -18 or so, it came back i went to the doctor and he said it was migraine thats  how its starts a little back and neck pain sometimes pain in both or one eye. so u may wanna check with ur doctor, good luck|`|VfA3OoU9aa	it could be lots of things.  epsecially since they are coming regularly.

8PAtSxKeaa	The penis and ball sack sometimes get sweaty and they like stick together, plus the pubes. It may also be because the schlong may have entered in a bad position. Like maybe they are adjusting, not scratching. The female whatever does not move around much and get caught in bad situations, so they would do less of things of this nature|`|I0Aro3fgaa	most of the time we do cuz its itchy, other times are to get a girl to notice your junk.girls do it too, it may not in public, but they do. they like rub there legs together when no ones watching|`|jFKhPGmOaa	We dont scratch our penis we scrath our balls|`|v2BRsRXKaa	I get erections when I see penises.

Women do scratch, maybe in private. Don't tell me the vagina don't ever itch?|`|2aK9IJbiaa	depends on what type of undies you are wearing( tight or loose)|`|AA11476855	Well I can't answer for men but according to my 17 year old son if he has to carry the package then he is going to move it around when it needs to be so deal with it. <br>  <br>  My ex said its his junk he can adjust it in his truck whenever he wants. <br>  <br>  Personally watching men play with themselves is quite a show. LOL Some men are quick about it hoping no one notices while others they just go right to work on playing pocket hockey or reaching right down into their pants and grabbing ahold and moving it around. <br>  <br>  I say - do what feels good - we all do.|`|Nq4FWEIcaa	Because it itches.

FN8meC6taa	The flu is going around  I have had it for three days now.  My son threw up with it but I did not get the sick stomach with it.  Just the coughing , burning eyes, dizzy, sore throat, and fever.  It sounds like you got it.  Try not drinking milk or eating milk products.  The milk it probably curdling in your stomach from the fever from the flu.  This is a nasty flu.  Hope we get better soon.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	you probably caught a virus of some sort, you must drink a great deal of water to help your system flush the virus out and wait for it to pass.|`|mAp90hEeaa	Why haven't you taken something for this???  You apparently have a fever and regular doses of tylenol will take care of that and your head hurting and many of your other symptoms.  The dizziness is because you have not had enough fluids.  If you are no longer vomiting, you need to dramatically increase your water intake and the dizziness will go away.  You can take an over the counter cough medication for the cough and last, run a humidifier in the bedroom where you sleep.|`|iaUhpaw6aa	Sounds a lot like the flu. I recommend going to a doctor and getting checked out to make sure its not something more serious. Eat things like soup and crackers and get plenty of rest and stay hydrated. Until you go to the doctor take pain relievers/fever reducers such as advil, tylenol, and sudafed.|`|Egg3sJULaa	it may be a stomach virus or flu that is going around.. hope u feel better, make sure to drink plenty of liquids so you dont dehydrate|`|eYMsOOe9aa	It can't be that bad since your on the computer, when you get VERY sick like I did with Flu type A I couldn't look at anything but the TV and that was hard if I wanted to watch it for more then 20 min.

My first time being high was nothing like I expected it to be.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Pancakes, there are no hallucinations except maybe very mild ones. It's really just that your short term memory is gone so it feels like everything you are doing is by instinct because you don't remember starting motions.  Then there's also happiness, hunger, laughter, and in some cases paranoia, but these to me are mostly like side affects.  Also, these affects only last about an hour to an hour and a half and after that you're just buzzed.|`|WLPDJ3Npaa	It was exactly like I thought it would be...

LsHkgexvaa	No you will not go through withdrawal after a one time dose. Drug withdrawals are a result of long term use and sudden cessation (stopping)  the medication. You can even take a therapeutic dose for a few days without withdrawal. Be careful, and good luck.|`|3SqtWtaxaa	I don't think so. Just don't mix it with anything else especially alcohol. Maybe it will make you drowsy.
Ca6niAJcaa	Uhh maybe for a little while afterwards, but nothing serious. The only way you'll notice real withdrawls is after you take it daily for a long time and then stop.

kbGOMwi7aa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~|`|dJuEtGxraa	Don't let j M take my credits for that answer.

I also take xanax before bed.  I'm going to stop that, and maybe my sleep will be restored.<br>  <br>  I stopped taking xanax throughout the day because not matter what I wanted to do, I had to sleep.  At a low dose, too.  I have an anxiety disorder and clin depr.  Xanax has never worked long term for me unless I was freakin' out and needed to calm down.<br>  <br>  Ambien, like what I take, is a generic.  Where other medications cost hundreds of dollars, this one is quite affordable.<br>  <br>  As for any health-food supplements, I don't know of any.

yjJFE2dEaa	It's different for everyone. Mine didn't hurt straight away. <br>  But they do put this plastic thing in your mouth to keep your lips away from your teeth, my orthadontist lent on it while she was applying the brace and it cut up my gums a bit. <br>  <br>  I also made the mistake of having a salad as my first meal after getting braces. Big no no. Stick to soft foods for your first couple of days.<br>  <br>  It feels like you've grown another set of teeth, at first you can't figure out how to hold your mouth.<br>  <br>  Yes, they can start hurting after 4 or 5 days. Mine have occasionally started hurting after a couple of weeks. It all depends on your mouth.<br>  <br>  Elastics don't really make it hard to open your mouth but there is some resistance when opening more than you usually do while speaking. Bands on your molars are easier to deal with than  bands on your canines. I've had both.<br>  <br>  Yes, you can chew gum. And chewing it after getting braces tightened can help lessen the pain. Sometimes it can get wrapped around your braces but just brush your teeth.<br>  <br>  Oh, and good luck. :)|`|NlEESSW6aa	Yes they do hurt , depend on your orthodontist on how long they take maybe 35 min or so.

You will be able to talk but you have to take them off when you eat|`|qkmsixWXaa	It takes about an hour maybe more. <br>  They do hurt pretty bad the first week. You can eat soups, cup n noodles, light stuff if you can. But try to eat what you can, don't let them stop you.Oh and bite down a lot, it stings a little, but it'll make eating easier and your teeth stop hurting. It shouldn't be that hard actually. <br>  No gum, it'll get stuck on the brackets and especially on the crowns on the molars.|`|mW1nN8Ojaa	Yes they do hurt but only for a few days.

I'm sure it doesn't take more than an hour at best, but I wasn't there with my brother when he got his on, so I can't know for sure. Plus, every orthodontist is different!<br>  2. Eat soft stuff, like mashed potatoes, pudding, Jell-O, soup, anything along those lines. You won't want to be chewing hard stuff, since yes, they will hurt for about a week or so (my brother complained for two weeks, but he has a low pain tolerance. I think he was just milking it).<br>  3. It won't be hard, my brother also has elastics and he can talk and open his mouth just fine. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you take them out to eat so they don't snap or anything.<br>  4. You really shouldn't chew gum, but no one follows that rule :)|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	Yeah your teeth/mouth will probably be sore.<br>  <br>  I mean everyone is different. For the first day I stuck with mashed potatoes/apple sauce/soup..etc<br>  <br>  Then the next day I was able to eat whatever I wanted. <br>  <br>  Some of my friends couldn't eat normal for like 3 days.<br>  <br>  Gum:<br>  <br>  Can you chew it: Yeah<br>  Should You: No<br>  <br>  I honestly don't remember how long it took. I think it also depends if you get the piece that goes on the roof of your mouth or the one on the bottom of your mouth or both lol.<br>  <br>  Luckily I didn't have any of those. I just had the braces. <br>  <br>  <br>  It won't be hard to talk or open your mouth. You get used to it. I took my bands off when I ate.|`|phDTu7c1aa	The process can be a little painful, and takes over an hour, and your teeth will probably hurt for 2-3 days at the most. Just take a few painkillers every once in awhile, even before the procedure,and you can dilute the pain a little bit. You should be able to talk completely normally.<br>  Do eat soft foods if you feel pain. <br>   I think getting braces put on hurts more if you have a really small mouth, like I do.<br>   Chew gum, but make sure it's not super sticky. Bubble Yum is a good brand that won't stick to your teeth.|`|2304b45ad31c59074c934485c7909132aa	u cant chew gum<br>  dont be nervous<br>  it only hurts like 2 to 3 days after they put it on and then the same each time they tighten it <br>  so just keep a bottle of advil and eat 1 if it really hurts<br>  and putting it on will take 40min<br>  food doens't matter, just anything that's not too chewy or else it'll hurt ur teeth<br>  yeah hard to open ur mouth but wont hinder that much|`|IxD8aNHTaa	it takes about 45 minutes to put them on. They actually dont hurt when they come on. maybe for like an hour, but never after that. i have e;astics and you can still open your mouth the same and eat and talk the same. Oh, and about the gum.. i chew it like everyday and the ortho never notices, so go ahead and chew!|`|aAYaSGf1aa	not while they put them on... but after yes.. they will get sore mabey 2 hours later.<br>  and u can  chew sugar free gum. but u prob wont b able to for a week or 2 b/c u will be so sore.<br>  <br>  i culdnt eat pizzia for a week and a half<br>  <br>  dont be nervous-trust me i was a nervous wreck wen i went in to get mine- but the actual process of getting them isnt that bad<br>  <br>  :]

nAp688tZaa	You absolutely can not mix sleeping pills with alcohol and you should never exceed the prescribed dosage.  Sleeping pills have a lot of draw backs, particularly narcotic based sleeping pills.  Once you get into the habit of taking them, you will not be able to fall asleep on your own, or stay asleep, without them.  There are some alternatives to the traditional sleeping pills, including Valerian Root, Melatonin, and Amitriptyline.  The third is a prescription drug that was developed as an antidepressant many, many years ago, but is now used to prevent migraines and treat insomnia.  It is nowhere near addicting as the sleeping pills, but is very effective at helping you fall asleep, usually within 30 minutes of taking it.  You should speak to your doctor about two things; 1) weaning off the narcotic sleep medications and trying the Amitriptyline, and 2) getting a referral to a psychologist about the problems you are having sleeping.  The fact that you took five sleeping pills and then drank two glasses of wine is a good indicator that you have additional psychiatric problems in addition to you inability to sleep.  Please seek some professional help and please see your doctor about trying a non-narcotic sleep aid.|`|AOCqOTfBaa	Mixing alcohol and sleeping pills can be a somewhat horrible mix. Because both of these pills are depressants, they can cause some serious side effects if they are taken at the same time. When they are taken together, they cause your body to relax more than it really should. This means that your breathing drastically is slowed down. This is bad because the less oxygen gets to your blood cells the more your blood pressure drops. Your blood pressure dropping can lead to a number of things that will be quite harmful for your body. If you stop breathing for long enough, it could put your body into a coma. The lack of air entering your body will eventually begin to affect the performance of your organs. If you are not taken care of immediately once your body is put into a coma, it is very likely that you will die due to lack of oxygen and a number of other things. Bad thing Dry and warm!

I learned fast that this was not the best option, however. You'll want a few good pair of padded ankle socks, either to wear or at least to have near you, because it is not uncommon for your residence hallway to be dirty with dropped food, water, spilled liquor, etc. You never know what you're walking on! <br>  <br>  As for legs and tops, I transitioned around. For me, it was comfortable to go shirtless and just wear a pair of pajama pants, but by second-year I had transferred rooms and I lived with my boyfriend, so the scare of my roommate seeing my package by accident really didn't exist. However, most of the guys in all three schools were often wearing gym shorts or pajama pants and a t-shirt. Typically, by second semester, most of the guys sleeping naked or in underwear learned better during a January fire drill that had the whole dorm standing in the snow for 20 minutes (you never know when some jackass is going to leave something on the stove too long)<br>  <br>  Either way, guys know guys. I never met a single person in college who said they'd been humiliated by their sleepwear, most dorm-residing college men expect to see their fair share of random male body parts on a daily basis, just by the nature of having 10-100 guys sharing the same 4 lengths of hallway for a year. Don't be too worried about it.|`|7n523JW1aa	When I was in college I slept naked and kept a pair of short by my bed if I had to get up and go pee.

When your body burns fat, you can't target where to lose it.

2sycPf8Daa	Blood pressure is shown by two numbers. For example, your nurse or doctor may say your blood pressure is "125 over 80." The higher number (125) is the pressure when the heart beats. It is called the systolic pressure. The lower number (80) is the pressure when the heart relaxes between beats. It is called the diastolic pressure. <br>  <br>  Blood pressure is normal when the higher number is below 130 and the lower number is below 85. For example, 125 over 80 (125/80) is normal blood pressure. Blood pressure between 130/85 and 139/89 is high normal and should be rechecked every year. Blood pressure of 140/90 or over is high. <br>  <br>  Over time high blood pressure can damage blood vessel walls causing scarring that promotes the build-up of fatty plaque, which can narrow and eventually block arteries. It also strains the heart and eventually weakens it. Very high blood pressure can cause blood vessels in the brain to burst resulting in a stroke.<br>  <br>  If you Blood pressure is 140/90 or over is high and you can be at risk for a heart attack or stroke.<br>  <br>  Take care as always!|`|pa7hVLAHaa	There are many things that put you at risk for heart attack.  Hypertension (or high blood pressure) is of one of them.  Generally blood pressure above 140/90 is considered high blood pressure.

Avoid red meats. Take a multivitamin, calcium and vitamin d every 2 days, one or two V8s a day (or every other day). <br>  <br>  Don't starve, eat small healthy meals. A lot of small meals opposed to a few bigger ones-- make sure is has at least 8-10 or more g of protein, not too much protein because the body can only digest a certain amount at a time; and avoid too many fruits, carbs and sugars.

BeSZ4nXraa	When I started using tampons I thought you were supposed to put the tip of the applicator at the tip of your vagina and insert like that, but no :)  You need to push the applicator inside almost as far as it will go (not including the plunger part) and then push the plunger thing.  If it's right you won't feel it at all.  If you try to remove it before it's full of liquid then it will hurt unfortunately.  Ideally, you wouldn't remove it until time, but if it's in wrong, there is no choice.  You can also try putting a little vaseline on the tip of the applicator to help.|`|6gthdHpnaa	Here is how from ezinearticles.com:<br>  That said, the best time to practice inserting a tampon is during the heavy part of the menstrual period. As with most other feminine hygiene products, tampons come with instructional diagrams. Make sure to go over them first. Lastly, try to relax.<br>  <br>  1. Hold the tampon applicator in your right hand if you are right-handed, or left if left-handed.<br>  <br>  2. Use your thumb and middle finger to hold the bottom of the larger, outer tube.<br>  <br>  3. Point the tip of the applicator toward your vagina, facing slightly towards the back so that the smaller tube is pointing away from you.<br>  <br>  4. Open your vagina with your free hand and place the tip of the applicator at the opening of your vagina.<br>  <br>  5. Gently apply pressure on the smaller end of the applicator in until it is completely inside the larger outer tube, pushing the tampon into your vagina.<br>  <br>  6. With your thumb and middle finger still on the outer tube, release the smaller tube and let the strings dangle freely.<br>  <br>  7. Do not forget to gently pull the two tubes out together.<br>  <br>  8. The strings are used to remove the tampons after use.<br>  <br>  A properly inserted tampon should not cause any discomfort. It would be best to find a comfortable place and allot an ample amount of time to practice how to insert a tampon for the first time.|`|16bWGB14aa	You should actually angle it to your back a little bit.

I know I did, but you get used to it after a while, and soon enough you won't even have to think about it.  <br>  Start small though, make sure you are using the right size, and since it's your first times, you may want to start out with a light one.  <br>  Some brands are more comfortable than others because of the way they expand when they get wet.  I personally think Playtex is rather uncomfortable with their 360 opening thing.  I prefer Tampax Pearl because they swell up enough, but not so much that it hurts to remove it.<br>  Also, it might hurt if you're taking it out and it's still pretty dry.|`|zZJmUv7Kaa	your not putting it in deep enough.<br>  when i first started using tampons, i had the same problem.<br>  just push it in further <br>  and relax when taking it out
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Yes, that is very low and I think you should refer to the following:<br>  <br>  <br>  Women tend to have more body fat than men—about five percent more. By nature, a woman's body is developed to protect her and a potential fetus. As a result, women have more enzymes for storing fat and fewer enzymes for burning fat. Additionally, the estrogen women have activates fat storing enzymes and causes them to multiply. <br>   <br>  The minimum percent bodyfat considered safe for good health is  12% for females. The average adult body fat is closer to 22%-25% for women. Athletes tend to be at low end of this scale due to the increased lean weight (muscle mass) of top athletes. While low levels of bodyfat seem to be related to improved performance, body composition alone is not a great predictor of sports success. A linebacker needs to have enough body mass (lean and fat weight) to generate high forces and avoid injury. Bodyfat among elite athletes vary largely by sport. There is little evidence benefit when women drop under 14% bodyfat. Women athletes who lose too much fat risk injury, decreased performance and health issues. <br>  <br>  hope this helps..

I'm sorry that I can't be of more assistance.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	follow up with a pulmonologist for treatment and an education.|`|zLkIGe5Taa	One in 27 Caucasians are carriers of the CF gene mutation.  I would really doubt that is the case.<br>  <br>  Do you smoke or live/work in a smoky environment?  Are you on medications for joint problems?  Some of these can suppress the immune system leading to infections.  There are other conditions that can lead to respiratory infections like Kartagener's syndrome.|`|TlFnIei0aa	It's just a coincidence. Carriers don't have any problems caused by the gene.
mAQHyfCYaa	you mean hormones, right? And you mean added hormones as well? Because every single living thing has its own kind of natural hormones.<br>  <br>  Most people worry about meat and additive hormones. But honestly there is more hormones in other things than just meat. Soy bean oil is considered healthy and yet one tablespoon contains 7500 times more hormones than a 6oz steak!<br>  <br>  Honestly the whole hype about hormones in food is ridiculous. I know canadian meat has to abide by strick guidelines as to how much hormones can be in the meat. Vegetables as well. So it totally depends on the country of origin of the food as well.
2wMMAKpOaa	Periods can come and go for several reasons. Such as stress, malnutrition, and if you're younger than 18 you're period will be irregular for a while. The only way this would prevent you from getting pregnant in the future is if you have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. This cause irregular periods and infertility. But I wouldn't count on that as a birth control. Hope this helped :)
eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	You may be experiencing ovulation pain, but it should not be anything that bad.  Ovulation pain should at most be more a nagging ache, and one sharp pain possibly at the moment of ovulation.  Pain on the right side in a female is hard to diagnose without an exam and tests, just because there is a lot of "stuff" in the region.  Aside from the appendix, you have an ovary and fallopian tube, a kidney, and the start of the large intestine.  But none of that in working order should cause pain like you describe.  So you will need to visit a doctor next time to have it checked out, and find the reason.|`|1rRw5e1Eaa	you should go to the doctor.  he knows what he's talking about, unlike most of the people on here.|`|xmlEl9Ksaa	hmm i had my appendix taken out about a month ago and i dont really think that sounds like what i had. the pain started out in my stomach, then to my abdomin, then to the right side and it hurt when i walked..heres a really good website that tells you everything about appendicitis, hope its something easier to cure then appendicitis! good luck.<br>  <br>  digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs...

rVnTnuU1aa	Depends on how bad you want to lose weight. I did yo yo dieting for quite a while because i was not motivated. I went home for the holidays with my husband, to see that i went from being the smallest female in the family to one of the largest. That was motivation to lose the weight. I started my diet in Jan and so far i have lost 22 pounds by eating healthier and working out. Just have to want it bad enough.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	I totally agree with Crystal. It's really hard to stick with anything if you deny yourself of what you really want. You should allow yourself to indulge once and only once per week. Otherwise you will end up binging on everything.<br>  <br>  Also, I know you said that you have a bunch of exercise material,  but maybe you're not using it because it's not right for you. I found that the thing that worked best for me was to do a dance aerobic routine. When exercising, you really need to get past the "it'll be more fun to do something else" thing. <br>  <br>  The thing that always kept me motivated was to make a competition with my husband. Find someone else who you know wants to lose weight. Share your stories and work out with that person. It really helps to have support.|`|r1fLDlhCaa	im constantly being compared to my model cousins, which is sad, but i use it as inspiration. like i have this thing with people having favorites (my parents favor my older brother) and such so i just use it to show them u no what, this person is not better than me, we all screw up, get used to it. like when i went vegetarian people told me i couldent do it and it just made me want to more, and i did.|`|wlhMUwKsaa	I go by the "if someone else can do it, I can do it" way of thinking.

Try taking each day as it comes, stock up on healthy food instead of setting yourself strict goals which only make it harder. Also rewarding yourself with pampering will make you feel more positive and encourage you to look after yourself. For example after you've exercised, take a shower and exfoliate, do your nails, put on a face mask - you catch my drift|`|4NcshCDvaa	I found success by still letting myself have my favorite foods but only allowing it once a week.

Honestly it isn't that hard once the ball starts rolling. What I'm going to tell you to do is to give yourself pep-talks for like, 10-15 minutes daily, talk out loud. I liked to give my pep-talks while in the shower. It helped me so much you wouldn't believe it! When your exercise keep thinking about being slim and trim, if you keep at it it becomes so easy I promise! When you are ready you'll know you can do it! Just believe in yourself, if you can't do what I did, "Fake it till you feel it!" <br>  <br>  Weight loss can seem hard at first, I know that but you can do it! You're going to want to start a defined diet program too, not just "eating healthy" I suggest spark people, or weight watchers. I used a combination of both! <br>  <br>  Now only you will know if you have the motivation. I will admit it takes a few tries before you get it right but once you get it man does it feel good! If you ever need to talk just email me! I'm living proof - I've done it and I'm only 17!|`|N5jQuNCRaa	Definitley, u just need to remember what you want to do! So whenever you decide to eat something that wont really help you lose weight, then think for a minute : "is this really going to help me lose weight? I need to lose 60lbs by July and it definitley wont happen if I eat this." Then you put it down and grab something healthier. By the way, this doesnt meen you arent allowed to stop eating this food but in moderation! <br>  <br>  It all depends on the food that you really want to eat? If it's like a chocolate bar -- (just an EXAMPLE)  then try once every other week or something. Try getting those 100 calorie chocolate cookies or chips w/e you''d like. I would really like to lose 60lbs before july to but I cant seem to stay motivated either. Really, I just used the line " Do I really want to do this" and it definitley is working. I'm staying focused and everything is doing fine. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCKK <3|`|dTEbLgvEaa	The key is eating less.  All the exercise in the world won't help that much if you overeat.  I find it easy to resist eating if I'm doing something I really enjoy - like gardening.  I doubt if you really enjoy working out on all that equipment.  One of the secrets is to stay enjoyably engaged in whatever your are doing.  Another secret is that when you are eating, chew well and pay attention to what you are doing.  Don't just shovel food in your mouth.  Stop eating when you are no longer hungry - not when you are stuffed.  Make your calories count by eating good food that you like.  Stay active.  Even standing burns far more calories than sitting in front of a computer.|`|mW1nN8Ojaa	find a picture of yourself that you think you look disgusting in, Put somewhere where you will see it everyday.

Your focus is wrong right now... you should be focusing on how to be healthier and not on how much weight you need to lose. Yes, being overweight is not good. But, starving yourself and working yourself into a frenzy isn't good for you either. Talk it over with a doctor and a nutritionist. Have them help you figure out a plan that you can stick with. Have a friend come over and make it a routine. Even "skinny people" need to exercise. It shouldn't be done just for losing weight but it should be done so that you are healthier and feel better. Put on some music and work out with the focus on becoming healthier and happier. (Exercise makes you have endorphins naturally, so it can also reduce stress and make you feel happier.) Vary the type of exercising you're doing--do some weight training along with aerobics. Don't start off too fast and be sure to stretch out before working up a sweat. Good luck!|`|1SoBeTzVaa	u should try to envision yourself as the result. if ur deadlin is july cuz u want to look good in a bikini, envision urself looking absolutely amazing in it. think of all the perks of the routine (healthier body, killer in a bikini, post-workout high, etc.) write them on post-it notes and stick one on ur alarm clock the nite b4. it mite help u get up earlier. even if you dont reach ur goal, ull feel much better. dont hold urself to unreasonable standards. oh, and listen to danceish music when u work; if ur going to the beat it will seem like less.<br>  <br>  also: try breaking it into baby steps. as in, "each week i will add an extra hour of excercise time" etc. dont make ur mini-goals about the weight, make them about what ur going to change in ur routine. dont overwork urself. <br>  <br>  for eating healthy, make sure u find healthy alternatives. if u love brownies, go for "no pudge" brownie mix. its delish. frozen yougurts/ yogurt blends (dreyers makes a good one) are a sub for ice cream. and, once every week or two, allow yourself a real treat. a slice of real pie or real chocolate cake. <br>  of course, eat lots of fruit and veg, but make them ones u like. if u like apples, oranges, and green peas, dont force ursl=elf to live on lettuce and celery.|`|1UID5JtNaa	My book, Lose It For Ever, has a chapter on motivation- are you weighing yourself once a week?  Do you have a goal workout that you use to challenge yourself weekly?  Do you set new goals once the old one has been reached?  By the way, lifting weights by itself does not really do much for weight loss.  To reach your goal, I would be accumulating at least 6 miles every day walking (get a good pedometer), and follow my guidelines in Lose it For Ever.   I also have a chapter on the National Weight Control Registry- a group that has lost at least 30 pounds and kept it off at least a year.   See what they do.|`|CHXmIgpnaa	Hi, im not an expert or anything but I have been watchin videos online that can be pretty helpful.Use the internet to your advantage.First of all you have to be motivated, because your not gonna lose the weight unless you put forth the effort.What motivates me is watchin videos on youtube of people's transformations after months of excercise and eating healthy.The most important factor in order to lose weight is eating right. I dont think yoga will be very helpful in your case.I would stick to the treadmill and probably stay away from weights.Because if you work out your muscles that are underneath the fat, itll just make your muscles bigger and in the process make U look bigger.Before you even begin with your diet, you should go through a detox and get rid of any junk inside your intestines or stomach.So it'll be really hard to stick to a boring diet, but you have to be dedicated and you have to be determined to reach your goals.Then there's also supplements out there that can help.Just stay focused and I'm sure you can meet your goal.Because its not impossible.You just have to stick to it.Good luck.By the way you should check out expertvillage.com, and maybe vitabot.com.Vitabot can help you come up with mealplans that will help you meet your goals.Hope this was helpful.|`|S8RcAy9Saa	I've been in this spot!  Make SURE you are enjoying the exercises that you do.  That is so important and will keep you motivated with the program, and it will also help you keep a routine.  <br>  <br>  Make exercising a part of your daily schedule.  It's as important as anything in your schedule that you do normally, such as going to work.  Set your work out time at the same time everyday.<br>  <br>  Lastly...one thing that's always helped me is to have music playing while I'm working out.  The music can really help keep you motivated.  I never go to the gym without my ipod...and if I forget it and leave it at home...I'll turn back around to get it!  It definitely makes a huge difference.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  YOU CAN DO IT!
cbNPsb1Naa	WARM UP before you stretch!  This will loosen the muscles and help you get more flexible.  Just jog around for a couple minutes and then do hurdler stretches.  Its when you sit on the ground lay one leg out in front of you and the other in a butterfly stretch so your foot is resting against the side of your knee. Go as far as you can down, forehead to knee preferably and stretch your arms out to your toes and hold it for a couple minutes, then do the other leg.  This stretch will really help you do the forward split. Remember to warm up or you won't get the best effect.|`|jQF99S0Xaa	stretch everyday. your ankles and behind your legs and sit in the splits as far as you can after you stretch for up to a minute so it really really hurts. you can look online for what strethes to do because there is like a million. but you have to make sure you do it everyday. and sit in the long painful splits. i wanted my middle splits down for the longest time and i did that and cried almost everynight when i would sit in them because they hurt so bad but now i have them down !!!|`|urxsjDMKaa	sit with one leg out straight in front of you and another bent and at your inner thigh. and lean forward trying to touch your toes and do that on both legs. and another lay on your back and lift one leg up and keep the other down and try to pull the leg to your face. hold for no more then 15 seconds.|`|XNuwTxAUaa	stretch ur thigh muscles as MUCH AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE but don't pull anything. do it slowly put alot instead of fast and alot trust me|`|lZLZqtaBaa	just sit on the ground and spread your legs out as far as they can go. then lean both ways for 10 seconds... well its hard to explain look something up on youtube such as:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpaaqwavxPY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epaaqwavx...</a><br>  <br>  click on that and watch!|`|chpMevdkaa	work on it each day, push yourself to do more, it will come eventually.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	I did yoga, and gained WAY more flexibility.

rzBxRw7Haa	Hi as a cancer sufferer I have to cling on to hope, and hope that something can be done so how about "Pandora's Box"? If you read the following taken from Wikipedia you will see that the jar carried 'nasties' like for example cancer and when it was finally opened all that was left was hope. You could have a logo with a jar or box containing the word hope with the words Pandora's Box surrounding it. just a thought.<br>  <br>  I would like to congratulate you girls on what you do for cancer charities, keep up the good work and 'hope' you win this year. Of course you could just call yourselves 'Hope'.<br>  <br>  In Greek mythology, ''Pandora's box'' is the large jar carried by Pandora that contained evils to be unleashed on mankind — ills, toils and sickness — and finally hope.

e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	The dentist says not to rinse for 24 hours because we want the blood clot to mature.  This usually means vigorous, bubble-cheeked rinsing.  To rinse in less than 24 hours means put some rinse in the mouth and tip your head back and forth to swirl the rinse around, then let it drain out.<br>  The rinse they've prescribed can be started the next day and is not so crucial the first day.  Go ahead and drink (lots!), It doesn't count.<br>  The numbness: It sounds like your whole lower lip and chin are numb, not just half, right?  If that's the case, your dentist probably reinforced the numbing with a long-acting anesthetic. (I do that when I want people to get some sleep!).  It can last 8-12 hours, in some cases.<br>  Eat something that doesn't require lots of chewing (yogurt, bananas, smoothies, no straw, mac-n-cheese)  Do the best you can with food.|`|pa7rzc8Qaa	I had my wisdom teeth taken out all at once, too, about 5 years ago. I remember rinsing very gently after the first day or so, but during the first 24 hours I was so out of it that I don't remember what I did. LOL. I do remember that for a good week (until I had the stitches removed that they had placed in the sockets on the bottom) I rinsed very gently and made sure that my toothbrush didn't hit those areas. For your second question, the instructions most likely refer to rinsing as actually swishing/spitting, as opposed to drinking and swallowing. I'd suggest just trying not to have whatever you're sipping actually wash over the sockets at first, so it won't loosen the clots. For your third concern, the novacaine not wearing off, it can take a very long time when you've been injected in several places all at once. Plus, because the wisdom teeth nerves run all along your jaw, the numbing is very deep and will take longer than normal to go away. I also had some soreness in my jaw itself for a couple days, because my mouth had been open as wide as it would go during the procedure. So between the numbing and the stretching, it was uncomfortable, but that got back to normal after about 2 days. After about 2 weeks, the holes were visibly closing and I was able to cease rinsing every time I ate something.|`|4a0Akgieaa	They don't want you to wash away the blood clots in the removal sites or you could get dry sockets. If you rinse or drink just keep the liquid from doing so.

Heres the proof:<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApqsBudfq2zPvXrIZsKSIe_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219185233AAv2zwL">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~<br>  <br>  (Average for teens)<br>  5'0" = 94.5lbs <br>  5'1" = 98lbs<br>  5'2" = 101lbs<br>  5'3" = 104.5lbs<br>  5'4" = 107.5lbs<br>  5'5" = 111lbs<br>  5'6" = 114.5lbs<br>  5'7" = 118lbs<br>  5'8" = 122lbs<br>  5'9" = 125lbs<br>  <br>  (Average for adult females 20+yrs)<br>  5'0" = 100lbs <br>  5'1" = 105lbs<br>  5'2" = 110lbs<br>  5'3" = 115lbs<br>  5'4" = 120lbs<br>  5'5" = 125lbs<br>  5'6" = 130lbs<br>  5'7" = 135lbs<br>  5'8" = 140lbs<br>  5'9" = 145lbs<br>  <br>  This is based on adult BMI charts for women.|`|CoiDQiTraa	Will do Sarah ;)

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	When a hair follicle goes into the non-active state, the hair it has produced normally sort of breaks off and falls out.  The little dot you are seeing at the end of the shaft is likely just a bit of dead skin, not the "root".  You don't yank out a  hair follicle, any more than you would yank out a sweat gland- at least not without involving a lot of blood and pain.  What you are seeing is natural hair shed.   The “hair cycle” has three phases: <br>  <br>    Anagen Phase - growth phase<br>  <br>  Approximately 85% of all hairs are in the growing phase at any one time. The Anagen phase or “growth phase” can vary from two to six years. Hair grows approximately 10 cm per year, and any individual hair is unlikely to grow more than one meter long. <br>  <br>  Catagen Phase - transitional phase<br>  <br>  At the end of the Anagen phase the hairs enters into a Catagen phase which lasts about one or two weeks. Approximately 2% of all hairs are in the transitional phase at any one time. During the Catagen phase the hair follicle shrinks to about 1/6 of the normal length. The lower part is destroyed and the dermal papilla breaks away to rest below. <br>  <br>  Telogen Phase - resting phase<br>  <br>  The resting phase follows the Catagen phase and normally lasts about 5-6 weeks. Approximately 13% of all hairs are in the resting phase at any one time – but this percentage can vary from 4% to 24%. During this time the hair does not grow but stays attached to the follicle while the dermal papilla stays in a resting phase below. Approximately 10-15 percent of all hairs are in this phase at any one time. <br>  <br>  At the end of the Telogen phase the hair follicle re-enters the Anagen phase. The dermal papilla and the base of the follicle join together again and a new hair begins to form. If the old hair has not already been shed the new hair pushes the old one out and the growth cycle starts all over again. <br>     <br>  <br>  Each hair follicle goes through these “hair cycles” 10 to 20 times in a lifetime.<br>  <br>  So you can relax for a few years yet.  Male pattern baldness won't be an issue for you for another 10 years or so, and that begins with losing hair from the front sides of your scalp, near the temples.  For now, enjoy the head of hair.|`|YQYMPGK3aa	everybody looses hair.<br>  <br>  but it is a lot more noticeable when its longer. im pretty sure the hair comes out at the root.|`|1Q5XZgoiaa	same here. I told my parents I thought I was going bald because of this (I was scared because I shed a lot). But when my mom examined the back of my head she said I was as hairy as a bear, no balding spots.
AA11610448	Yeah, I've lost 50 lbs.|`|N89HLv92aa	I actully gained a little while I was on Lexapro but then i went off of it for a while and lost about 4lbs. Not sufficient enough for me to stop taking it so I started taking it again. But if you gained that much, you may want to try switching to another medication. I heard Wellbutrin was good for weight loss. I am actually thinking about talking to my doctor about switching to it. Good Luck and God Bless!|`|sZOiNdD5aa	i've tried that before but i don't even lose weight, have you hear of crevax? well, i actually using it for almost a month and you will be amazed because of it's dramatic results, you should check it out.|`|733a130929bcd6ce4f3b956b72af520baa	i used to be on it, but i never gained or lost weight while or after being on it.
BnofXJbOaa	You might be too, overstressed. That happens a lot. Try drinking warm water,.|`|XYQAxq6Iaa	Blood in your vomit is either minimal, or major, and if it's major, a potentially serious problem.<br>  <br>  from a website:<br>  "    * Ingested blood. If you swallow blood — during a nosebleed, for example — subsequent vomiting may include some of this blood.<br>      * Prolonged or vigorous vomiting. Vomiting may cause a tear in the small blood vessels of the throat or lower esophagus. This may cause blood to appear in your vomit.<br>      * Peptic ulcers. Peptic ulcers are open sores that develop on the lining of the stomach, upper small intestine or esophagus. In addition to feeling a burning pain anywhere from your navel to your breastbone, you may vomit blood that appears either red or dark (like coffee grounds).<br>      * Internal inflammation. Inflamed tissue in the esophagus (esophagitis), stomach (gastritis) or upper part of the small intestine may cause blood to appear in your vomit.<br>      * Cancer. Various types of cancer may cause you to vomit blood, especially cancers of the stomach and esophagus."<br>  <br>  So, uh, either way, go to the doctor ASAP.
eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	What to expect depends on the condition of the teeth themselves, and their position in your mouth, as well as if they have erupted already.  If the teeth have not broken through the gums and are not impacted against other teeth, then removal is pretty straightforward and decent for recovery.  If you have had other dental work done, involving a local anesthetic, it's quite possible to have it done that way now.  My eldest daughter had two wisdom teeth removed for the same reason as you, and they were removed just before they came in.  At that point, they do not have roots into the jawbone, so there is less damage done removing them.  In fact, a local is all you need to deaden the gums.  She had one suture on each side when she left the office, but no real pain to speak of.  She took 400 mg of Motrin, and went to the  movies with friends that same evening.  Aside from having to give up the popcorn and soda- she drank flavored water and had a chocolate bar - she did just fine.  No swelling, no real pain, and she didn't miss a beat.   My son had one impacted against another  molar, but not infected- so he had a bit of swelling on that side.  But again, it was just the gum that was injured, not the bone- and he was back at regular life within a day as well.  They ate regular meals, minus the things like chips, which you would expect- but within a week both were back on full feed.  You could also discuss having  IV sedation, along with the local.  Sedation will leave you sort of in a twilight state- not really asleep, not really awake.  You won't remember anything, but you would talk if you were asked a question.  You also won't care what they do either.  If you took an Ipod, you wouldn't hear a thing, and would probably drift off to sleep as well.  You would have to deal with getting an IV, but it is small and usually in the back of your hand- and the folks who do them are pretty good at hitting the target.  An IV needle is smaller than the one used to anesthetize you for wart removal, so you could always look the other way and it would be pretty well hidden by the hand of the person doing it.  Full anesthesia would also require an IV be started, and they usually only do that if you are really having a complex procedure done, where they expect to have to really get invasive.  In your case, it wouldn't really offer you any benefits that sedation wouldn't.  Plus you spend longer in the office, because you can't leave until you are fully on your feet.  There's more chance you would get sick afterwards, and you generally don't feel that great waking up.  If you went to sleep anxious, you also tend to wake up disoriented and frightened, and cry- which just scares you even more, before you are alert enough to understand.  I was lucky  not to have any wisdom teeth at all myself, but while I was active duty I often had to assist the oral surgeon with the procedure set up and recovery of patients who had both sedation and full IV anesthetic.  My husband had all four removed at one time, and he opted for the full IV procedure because two of his were badly impacted.  He fared the worst of the group- compared to the kids, but that was also due to his having been in his mouth for over a year before he had them removed.  So there were roots in the jawbone to deal with, and holes left in the bone after removal.  That is the thing that actually makes it the worst- the gum heals faster than the bones do at first.  You can suture the gums, but you can't fill the hole you leave in the bone.  Now, since you feel so anxious about this, when you have your consultation with the surgeon, just ask what you need to ask and tell him/her about how you feel about all this.  Then you can mutually arrive at a decision that you are both comfortable with, and  you will get information that takes your personal situation into account.  From the sounds of it, your case will be different from what you generally read about here at YA.  Most of the folks writing here have wisdom teeth that are impacted and in place, and have been for some time.  So the removal is a lot harder, and recovery is harder.  The sooner you deal with the problem, the easier it goes.  I would expect yours to go easy, and your recovery time fast, with a lot less pain involved.  Like most things, the sooner you deal with a problem, the easier it is to do.  That's why we had our oldest two children's teeth done as soon as they realized it was trouble waiting.  They weren't really grateful at the time, but then after watching their peers, they were glad it happened as it did.  You will be too.  Meantime, don't work yourself up dreading the worst case scenario, because you don't fit the description and it hasn't happened yet.  Best to worry about things when the time comes.|`|SVrXKm9Qaa	I got all four of my wisdom teeth out in september!<br>  <br>  My bottom right was a REALLY big hassel (before the surgery) and it hurt all the time. I'm deathly afraid of needles, and I asked to be put out, and they said okay (most places will say okay, anyways!).<br>  <br>  So today I walk into this one room, where the oral surgeon comes in and asks if I have any last minute questions. I asked if I could keep any of my wisdom teeth. He said the top ones because normally the bottoms need to be broken (mine was).<br>  <br>  I then went to the room where they do the actuall surgery. My heart was beating so fast, and I kept telling them I'm nervous, etc. They had me sit down in this blue chair (where the surgery was going to be done) and they put this rubberish band around my arm to make my veins stand out. <br>  <br>  Once they found a vein, I was so nervous about the IV, but I realized I needed to relax, and it didn't hurt at all! The oral surgeon put about 3-5 other needles into the tube that connects in your arm, and every time I thought "here we go, I'm going to fall asleep any minute!"<br>  About the fourth one I felt dizzy (in a good way) and I was out.<br>  I remember two or three nurses saying "Come on courtneè, you need to help us out, walk a little." we walked into another room where I slept about twenty minutes, then my parents came back into the room.<br>  <br>  The nurse went over tips, etc. and she gave me Vicadin and some antibiotics. She also chaged the guaze in my mouth, and gave me extra gauze for at home. There was a bad taste in my mouth, but I went home and slept a little, I woke up, and it was pretty much gone, and I changed my guaze, again, and went to sleep.<br>  <br>  So far, the pain hasn't been bad at all. I was able to go to Dairy Queen with my dad and my friend, and then to a store. I used the gauze for about two or three days because I bleed a lot I was so nervous, but I'm really glad I got them out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry this was long!<br>  Good luck!<br>  I actually would do it again if it meant missing more school!|`|YsqhEQ43aa	The procedure itself is quick.  I would suggest going to sleep for the procedure; this would make it a lot easier on you and the surgeon.  Once you are asleep the procedure itself only takes about  20min.  Once you are asleep they will numb the area with local anesthetic, make a small incision in the gums, remove the tooth by elevating it out with an instrument, or sectioning the tooth in a couple of pieces with a drill to remove it.  Then a couple of stiches may be placed.  I didn't think the pain was that bad, because I was numb when i woke up and just took the pain meds and followed the directions they gave me.  There really is not much for you to do before and after.  Usually nothing to eat or drink after midnight before your surgery and get plenty of soft foods to eat after.  I know it's a big deal because you have probably never had surgery, but after it is done I bet you will think it was no big deal.  Just remember people will always tell you their horor stories and not really tell you many good things.  Sometimes I wonder if they just have a really low pain tolerance. You will be a little uncomfortable for a few days, but you will make it through.  Good luck!

muHctmaGaa	Have your physician administer tests for polycystic ovarian syndrome. (Are you also hairy? Do you have bad skin? Those are common side effects.) She or he will probably give you an ultrasound to check for cysts or cancer, though the latter is rare and worst case scenario. Talk to them about different kinds of oral contraceptives to regulate your cycle (i.e. progesterine-only) to see if anything else works. Some people might think you went off your pills too quickly, but I did the same because it turned out I had a heart condition. My sisters have gone through several different kinds before settling on their respective perscriptions, so it's worth another go.|`|20af19563193d6f76a6c7f153bd57eb9aa	I think you would be noticeably pregnant in 8 months.|`|PwkYJoVgaa	you have to let ur body get used to the pills. my sister didnt like how they made her feel, then she let them get used to her body and they work perfect! so start taking them again, and go to the doctor and tell them whats going on.

If it were just a skipped cycle, and you could not have been pregnant, then it is normal for a skipped and catch up cycle.  With a skip cycle, you have a buildup of endometrium- the blood which is normally shed at the end of each cycle.  It breaks down over time, and is a bit harder to shed- which requires stronger contractions of the uterus to do the job.  So it means stronger cramps and a heavy flow.  That's the same for a miscarriage, for the same reasons really.  With a catch up cycle, you can expect to see livery looking clots and clumps, and have cramps until the shed is well underway.  A missed cycle can happen because you had a hormonal hiccup for some reason, and the last period didn't get triggered.  It could have been due to stress, a change in lifestyle, a change in job or scenery, a big change in diet, or illness.  It happens at least once in the life of all women, and usually isn't a reason to worry.  As long as the flow doesn't saturate a heavy pad in less than 2 hours, you have no problem- even if you are miscarrying.  The body is well designed to take care of matters, without the need for a doctor, in  most cases.  If you do saturate a pad that quickly, or the flow continues for more than seven days, then you need to see the doctor.  In the  meantime, you can take Motrin to help cut the flow some.  It won't stop it, but it does sometimes slow it a bit- and it will help with cramps.  You can also massage your lower belly over the uterus to help cramping as well, although that may also cause some "flooding" temporarily.  Not always, but sometimes.  Meantime, just try to relax.  It's still a normal process, ugly as it may seem.|`|sbeoF50gaa	yo! well.. I've always had abnormal periods! Well I guess not at first. I used to have these really light ones with no cramps. As I got to about 16 or 17 They got heavier but still no cramps. And I could go MONTHS without one but I could also go A MONTH with one BLEH. Now I'm on the depo shot, and I didn't have one for about 6 months and now I"ve been on it for about 3 months! SUCKS so bad. So as far as birth control goes I wouldn't suggest the deop! But It's different for everyone. I personally quit getting the shot cuz it's caused such a problem.  Anyway even before my birth control problem I"m having now I either had them or I didn't. Now I get cramps tho :( Your body is probably just going through a change. I wouldn't worry about it. But if you are concerned you can go to Planned Parenthood. Some accept the womens health medicaid you can get at any age. If they do accept it then they give you the application for it and you just fill it out. But we have 2 planned parenthoods here in my town, and one accepts it and the other doesn't? I'm not really sure why the difference. But it's free if you are accepted.|`|dEhGP14daa	Could you have been pregnant, it could be a miscarriage?

First off, several teaching Colleges and Medical schools offer wonderful care with no or little cost to you.  Another thing to consider is community health services, which also typically offer a major discount and help to get medications.  My doctor recommended a special type of therapy that works well for BPD.  Its called Dialectical Behavior Therapy.  Visit the group website (<a href="http://www.robindaylpc.com)" rel="nofollow">http://www.robindaylpc.com)</a> I went to and take a look at all the information.

People can waste years using an inappropriate treatment type, so it pays to seek a second opinion, confirming that initial diagnosis. <br>  <br>  LOW INCOME MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELLING: Contact your county/local mental health agency, and find out what help they can offer. Psychological counselling, with a sliding scale, based on income, is available through many religious organisations, such as Catholic counselling, the Methodist church, the Unitarian Universalists, and sometimes the United Way. You don't have to be a member. (U.S.A.)  Google: "clinics; mhmr; (your city); (your state)" I have been variously informed that the phone numbers 211, and 411, are appropriate. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't mention BPD, though, if seeing a mental health professional.

If you make sure to exercise every other day and cut your calories by 300-400 a day, you will drop weight. For exercising, you want to make sure you're doing a jog/run along with toning exercises. Remember..weight loss isn't what you want to concentrate on. Yeah you can lose 25 pounds and not look all that great because you just lost water and muscle..OR you can lose only 15 pounds but lose inches around your waist and tone your body up. Remember muscle weighs more than fat so although you may not "lose" that much weight, you can trim inches and tone your body. Doing a fast paced jog is excellent for toning muscle, burning calories and expelling waste from your pores. Cut calories and exercise and you will drop the weight just fine.|`|YRd5AM5uaa	Eat healthy and run/jog as much as possible

TudZYPN5aa	Any sort of lump anywhere should be checked out by a doctor.<br>  <br>  People say this all the time, but breast cancer is becoming more and more common...<br>  <br>  They will probably do a biopsy to see if it's cancerous, and even if it isn't, at least you won't have an unsexy extra booby lump growing.<br>  <br>  Go to a doctor and they should be able to tell you what to do.  Sometimes just a check up on the lump can tell you if it'll go away, or if it's worth checking.  You have nothing to lose by going to a doctor.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.

kbGOMwi7aa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~|`|dJuEtGxraa	I just answered J M questions one minute ago and now he is pasting my answers everywhere.

I have migraines with auras (auras are weird flashing zig zag lines that I get for about 20 min. before a migraine hits) anyways when I first started getting these, I freaked out and went to a neurologist who basicaly just diagnosed me with migraines. She didn't look at my eyes, or at me for that matter, she just listened to my symptoms and diagnosed me. I did not have peace of mind so I went to an opthamologist who dialated my eyes and checked the preassure and did some other in depth tests to make sure that the optic nerves werent damaged.  An opthamologist is better trained than an optometrist at diagnosing eye diseases, an optometrist just basically dispenses contact lens and glass prescriptions.  An opthamologist will be able to see all the way to the back of your nerves.

This virus is responsible for nearly all cases of cervical cancer, and so without catching HPV it is very difficult to become a victim.<br>   <br>   The most common way to catch the virus is through unprotected sex, but this usually leads to no symptoms as many of us are able to deal with the virus without being affected in any way. Only with a small proportion of women does it lead on to cause cancer.<br>   <br>   The more sexual partners we have, therefore, the more chance we have of catching the virus. However, by starting to have sex at a younger age and by using the contraceptive pill for long periods of time, we also put ourselves at greater risk, as we would through smoking. Nearly all cases of cervical cancer also occur in women over 35, meaning it is far more likely for women in this age group to become victims.<br>   <br>   Symptoms<br>    <br>   <br>   Due to the position of the cervix, it is not easy for us to catch the signs of cervical cancer until it is too late. Vaginal bleeding outside of the natural menstrual cycle, any unnatural discharges, pain or discomfort during intercourse and vaginal bleeding after the menopause could all be symptoms, but they could also be symptoms of far less serious conditions.<br>   <br>   The most common way for us to check for signs of cervical cancer is through cervical screening. This reveals the early appearance of any abnormal cells allowing them to be treated at an early stage, and is our best defense against developing full-blown cervical cancer that requires serious treatment.<br>   <br>   Standard Treatment<br>   <br>   The standard forms of treatment are the same as for most other cancers, involving surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a combination of all three. When caught early, only minor surgery may be required. However, for more advanced stages of the disease, a full hysterectomy may be required, preventing the possibility of having children. At this advanced stage, the success rate drops significantly, and it can also have a devastating psychological impact.<br>   <br>   Alternative Treatments<br>   <br>   The standard treatments for cervical cancer can be harsh, and as such it is in our interests to consider the alternative treatments available. Luckily, there are many alternative therapies now available for the treatment of cervical cancer that are far more natural than their standard counterparts and are far more kind, without suffering from any drop in success levels.<br>   <br>   One option is to use Formula DEG. This contains a natural version of chemotherapy through the presence of canendula, and is a successful formula which can be taken either by itself or in combination with any other alternative treatments.<br>   <br>   One of the best alternative therapies for cervical cancer that has been proven to have high levels of success is bio-photonic light treatment. This type of treatment concerns the need to restore the natural energy in our cells which are negatively affected by the cancer. They lose energy rapidly when they are affected, and this type of treatment seeks to restore the balance.<br>   <br>   It is completely non-invasive, and instead works by using a bio-photonic machine which charges and reprograms the cells so that they reverse the deterioration that is present through the onset of the disease. It is hugely important for the cells to be packed full of energy to lead to the most beneficial treatment of the disease, and by utilizing the power of a powerful electronic field created by the machine, this can be achieved.<br>   <br>   This is quite often used alongside other alternative therapies, one of which comes in the form of emotional freedom techniques. These are all concerned with restoring the body to a natural and healthy state after it has been affected by a trauma or stress previously in our lives, which we may not even know about.<br>   <br>   All of these techniques are not new, and have been proven to yield positive results in a number of patients. They don't only have the benefit of being successful, but they also have the added benefit of being far less intrusive, and can even be a pleasant experience, which is all helpful for healing our bodies.<br>   <br>   The Mariposas Clinic Spain provide a number of cervical ca
WRNCfhn2aa	wow!1that's horrible well you should go to that dentist  again if he tell you that same thing again you should go see a different dentist and see what they say and there shouldn't be much pressure unless you haven't worn it like 2 days or something and it's not suppose to be too loose nor too tight just right|`|dzukCeGhaa	I just recently started wearing a retainer as well, you shouldn't be feeling any preassure and it should fit presice. I do think you should consult your ortho or dentist about your tooth though. wear your retainer as directed and good luck!|`|OQIP89zuaa	Maybe try wearing your retainers 24/7 again until it moves back. They should fit perfectly with no pressure, but if your tooth moved then you are going to feel pressure. I suggest wearing them 24/7 until it moves back, and a little while after. Also go to your dentist again.
Rbm99GOcaa	Wow! You have alot to ask!<br>  <br>  1. Yes at first tampons do hurt, but you get used to them and they are great for sports and swimming!<br>  <br>  2. Iron pills boost your iron intake and helps because you lose iron in your period<br>  <br>  3. Pads are nice because you can see if they are full or not. Tampons are good because they are smaller, convenient, less noticeable. I suggest that you try both out and you will decide which you perfer. Note: Wear a panty liner with tampons incase the leak.<br>  <br>  4. PMS is when a girl on or around her period starts to have feelings that she can not control. (Pre Menstruation Syndrome) You may feel sad, angry, depressed. But don't worrie they are just mood swings and you have an excuse to eat all of the junk you want to!<br>  <br>  5. You break out because of Hormonal changes in your body. Just wash your face morning and night. Use proactive? or other face cleansers like that. Don't worrie you will grow out of it and everyone has acne. I use concealer and foundation. I also take a powder pack with me incase I get 'shiny' and I can use it to 'suck' up the extra oil.|`|oUV9ZUsEaa	1. well, if you're not used to them, then probably. start with pads.<br>  2. well, i have an iron deficiency, and iron pills give you MORE blood.<br>  3. pads. not as "convenient," but much easier.<br>  4. pms is pre-menstrual syndrome, and it's when girls are REALLY moody. <br>  5. wash your face, exfoliate, and take hot baths.|`|AA10975334	No, tampons don't hurt, you may feel a little uncomfortable at first, it is only a matter of getting used to it. <br>  Iron pills help by keeping you from becoming anemic during your period, it's great to take them everyday if you are not on your period. Our periods don't cause severe anemia, but they can cause slight anemia which may be enough to make us feel a little drowsy or run down<br>  As far as convenience, that is up to you. Try both and see which one is best for you, everyone has their opinions. Some like tampons during the day and pads at night. That is something you have to explore<br>  PMS is basically something that is set off by the hormone changes close to that time of the month. Some women because extremely irritable or depressed. For some it is severe, for others, not so severe<br>  If you take vitamins and eat a good diet, that helps eliminate the symptoms<br>  The best way to get rid of acne is to make sure you scrub with a good acne medicine. Also the oxy pads are EXCELLENT. As far as covering, there are medicated cover up sticks, they serve both purposes, to cover blemishes and to dry up the acne|`|ESzlhwoDaa	1; Tampons may feel a bit uncomfortable as you're inserting them or taking them out. However, if put in correctly, you shouldn't be able to feel it. <br>  <br>  2; Skipping this question, not much information. <br>  <br>  3; From experience, I find that tampons work better than pads. They absorb more and have less chance of leaking or getting onto your pants. However, both work, so whichever you prefer should be fine. <br>  <br>  4; PMS is Pre-Menstrual Syndrome. It's a condition most girls get about a week before their period. It's when they get very irritated, moody, etc. I take a pill to relieve the symptoms of PMS. <br>  <br>  5; Daily hygiene, cover-up and acne cream?|`|WMc3UIXsaa	1. they usually dont after you start using them for a while. the first couple times will probably be a little uncomfortable. but you'll get the hang of it soon enough. :)<br>  2. im not sure how iron pills work but i think it helps with heavy blood flow? you might want to research into that.<br>  3. i honestly think tampons cause then you wont have to worry about any leakages. but if its a MAJOR emergency, then most definitely pads.<br>  4. pms stands for pre-menstrual syndrome. you usually experience this when you're about to start your period. you get all cranky and irritable.<br>  5. if you want to cover up acne, use foundation or some kind of powder. to get rid of it, use face wash with acne treatment.|`|k6cXOxvtaa	1.Tampons dont hurt, but they take some getting used to. im 16 and i just started wearing them.<br>  <br>  2. I have no idea....but your too young to worry about pills<br>  <br>  3.Pads are great. My fav is Always Infinity. They are great until you start wearing tampons. they keep you dry as a bone =D<br>  <br>  4. PMS is when everything pisses you off. it sounds bad, but its not horrible.<br>  <br>  5. Just wash your face every night, and use some of those face cleaners|`|p8zDrYBKaa	1. IDK havent tryed them<br>  2. idk<br>  3.pads<br>  4. its like a mix of emotions when ur on ur period<br>  5. umm i would say proactive lol|`|Zyoh7j9Maa	Sure, here you are. I did the best i could =] :<br>  1) only if you put them in wrong<br>  2) sorry, no clue<br>  3)it depends. If you are more active, tampons. If you are more laid back, pads.  With tampons, you have to change them less, whereas pads you need to change every so often.<br>  4) About a week before your period, you MAY (not every girl has this) notice more pimples on your face or even your chest feeling sour.  Getting closer, you might notice that your back hurts more, you have stomach cramps, and you could be more edgy.  This just means that your period is coming, so be prepared.  It's also the hormones that women and girls get.<br>  5) a normal cleanser. wheter it's some kind of pad or liqiud or even a lotion, it still works.  Use it regularly though, not only when you are on your period.|`|F5ptObE8aa	1. tampons don't hurt but its kinda hard to put them in right if you put them in wrong it might hurt.<br>  2. don't know but i take them cuz if i didn't i'd be anemic they're good for your blood<br>  3. pads are more convenient but you can only use tampons in the pool<br>  4. pms is when you get all emotional b/c of all the hormones your body releases when you get your period<br>  5. wash your face, take care of your body, theres really nothing you can do just wait for it to go away.
lsO9Dr09aa	Well the pains could be what's causing the lack of appetite. It could be gas. No one can really diagnose you over yahoo answers or anywhere online so I suggest making a trip to the doctors.<br>  Best of luck!

xLO5VRYTaa	I hated Concerta :P didn't work for me and it starved me! Don't tell him that you've tried them because then he may suspect that you'll share your drugs and give you minimum dosage incase you do share, even if you wont. Odds are you will be perscribed with concerta- it seems like everyone is. If he gives you something different say you've read about concerta and have gotten recomendations about it and would like to try it. Oh and DO NOT try daytrana!!!!!!! ITS HORRIBLE!!! trust me.

01Mu3wUeaa	There is no such thing as the stomach flu (common misconception)<br>  <br>  One of the most common stomach bugs is the Norwalk virus.It is a year round bug that can be caught by anyone no matter how strong your immune system is.<br>  <br>  The virus can be airborne if you are standing close to a vomiting person and if you ingest the contaminated vomit particles, you can get sick.Otherwise, the virus is not airborne and the particles settle relatively quickly.<br>  <br>  One of the only ways to get the virus is to ingest the contaminated fecal and/or vomit particles through your nose, mouth and possibly, eyes.(That is why it is VERY important for ill people to wash their hands carefully after being sick or going to the bathroom and to clean all affected areas carefully) <br>  <br>  Avoiding them is very simple.<br>  <br>  You can avoid this nasty virus by washing your hands with warm soapy water for at least 15-20 seconds before you eat, prepare food or touch your face.<br>  <br>  Lysol and other household cleaners do not kill the virus.Bleach however does.<br>  <br>  It is very important for a ill person to keep their germs contained.Clean up should be with a bleach water solution and all ill people should wash their hands after they go #2.<br>  <br>  The virus will usually linger for about 24 hours or so give or take.<br>  <br>  I am emetophobic too so I know how you feel!<br>  <br>  try this site: <a href="http://www.emetophobia.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.emetophobia.org/</a> they have a message board with friendly people on there.
8TVYDSB5aa	I love the hat in your picture. It's really cool. =)<br>  <br>  And I would suggest listening to some music (on the radio, computer, ipod, in your head..) and dancing around.

kMoQzxjGaa	This happened to me my freshman year in high school. i also "had" ocd and anxiety attacks. I was really depressed and had an overwhelming feeling of hopelessness. I talk to my doctor and he prescribed me zoloft for all the symptoms, including ocd, along with therapy once a week. within 3 weeks, i felt better than before. You should seriously consider doing this! it will help you!|`|MIx1fSbdaa	Try to find a club that involves your interests. If you have a physics lounge, hang out there. I'm a bio major and I nearly WISH I was a physics major because a) the physics majors at my school are all fantastic people and b) their lounge is one of the best on campus.<br>  <br>  I''ve also never fit in with other college students, mostly because the crowd I slipped into was the geek crowd who wound up being IT majors and now we have little in common.<br>  <br>  Again, lounges are fantastic places for solitude (at least ours are). So are libraries. <br>  <br>  We are also the same in that we hate noise. I thought I was going to go crazy my freshman year. Then I discovered: foam earplugs! If you put them in correctly you can't even tell they're there apart from the lack of noise! The best 4 dollars I've ever spent :-D|`|gULNGNkFaa	I'm sorry you are having trouble. It's possible these things you describe are symptoms of OCD and/or Tourette Syndrome. There's also a condition called Asperger's Syndrome which may fit. People with Asperger's struggle with social things, but often really excel in using computers and math courses. None of these things are your fault, but you can possibly find a treatment for them with the help of a good doctor.  See if these links helps you at all.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tourettesyndrome.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tourettesyndrome.net/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/aspergers-syndrome/DS00551" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/asperge...</a><br>  <br>  Also, and this is important info!...Many colleges have mental health counselors available to you, so perhaps you should look into it. It's a sign of strength to reach out for help. Take care of yourself first, and you'll achieve the self esteem to meet a nice girl and hopefully really hit it off together ;o) I know it's hard to be patient, but I truly believe your work will pay off!
XW2fjYHRaa	I have a clear one too.<br>  Try putting it in colored mouthwash.  It will naturally kill the germs on it.  It also makes the retainer minty fresh when you put it back in your mouth.  Buy a small pick (I have a travel size one.  The pick is the size of a pin).  Because remaining plaque will now be colored, go ahead and scratch away.<br>  <br>  Nasty?  Yes.<br>  But it works.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|NkrfO4gfaa	hi I had a clear retainer before and what i used to do was wash it under cool water then put tooth paste on then brushed, Then after i just fill a small cup with Listerine then put the retainer in at night when i went to sleep.|`|aL0OCQG3aa	rinse it in hot water, not TOO hot or it will deform it though. and soak it in listereine|`|pmIC8aoaaa	i have the same ones!! i hate them<br>  i ended up using my good old hands and cool water<br>  never warm because it will deform it!<br>  i hate them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|jiZ6WD04aa	I let mine sit under scolding hot water and use a clean tooth brush and scrub it down with tooth paste than re-rinsee under the scolding hot water.

JIrud5INaa	(I'm sure I'll get thumbs down for telling my story)I totally understand what you mean/going through. I am a on/off cutter, I went 2 years w/o cutting until a few days ago. I don't do good with stress and right now I'm living on my own and I've been laid off work, and just having a lot of stress and such going on. I"m not promoting cutting but I do admit to doing it. And to the poster who said you are looking for attention in no way is cutting a way of trying to get attention some people just have a hard time dealing with there pain/feelings/emotions. I know I am not looking for attention at all its my own issues its just my way of dealing with them. Honestly I understand when you say it feels good, because when you do it, your just letting all that pain or whatever is bothering you go away its how you deal with it. You should stop though because you have so much to live for I don't know how old you are but you have your whole life ahead of you lots of things to look forward too. When I get the "urges" I always either write in my journal it doesn't have to make sense or anything just anything and everything thats bothering me, call a friend only a few of my friends I trust know that I do this though so I call one of them, take a nap, eat chocolate and watch my all time favorite movie "A christmas story" yes I know that sounds cheesy but if it will keep me from doing it then heck yeah! Your family cares about you my family unlike yours doesn't know I do this so your one step ahead of me! Once again though I'm not promoting it and saying to continue I just thought I'd share a little bit of my story, hope that helps.|`|g22GoipQaa	It's a bad coping mechanism.<br>  <br>  I also don't see me harming myself as a problem, but I see you doing it as a problem...<br>  Lately I got found out by a few too many people, and I got some strange advice... which at the time was just insane... and now thinking about it I feel better.<br>  <br>  All it is is a bad coping mechanism. Everyone has them, you just need to get past them... and that's life.<br>  It is a problem. You should try and see that as hard as that is... But it's also not the worst thing in the world... You need to stop because you're damaging your health... however if you look at any group of adults... a large proportion of them will have been stuck in one of these bad coping mechanism things at some point... whether it's alcohol, drugs, self harm, anything...<br>  <br>  Anyway what my point is, is that, yes it is a problem. But it's not the end of the world... in no way am I belittling this, but I agree with you in that it doesn't need to be the centre of your world...<br>  <br>  You need to speak to someone you respect. When people that I'd respected found out, they weren't espescially helpful, but the advice that they did give, I listened to more than to what others had said... and so I went with what they'd said...<br>  <br>  Anyway, I really can't help you much... since I'm pretty much in more or less the same situation.. except that I can see that some people do have a problem with self harm...

z5JkgFOyaa	There is quite a bit of variation in how long it takes for a girl to establish the regular menstrual cycle that most women experience in adulthood. And even after the menstrual cycle matures and becomes regular, this "regularity" may differ greatly from woman to woman. This irregularity can give you a concern because you feel there is something wrong going on.<br>  <br>  So, some understanding about the normal variations that occur in early adolescence and young adulthood can help ease some of the anxiety. <br>  <br>  The cycles in the early years after menstruation has begun typically are a few days longer than in adults. In addition, the lengths of time for irregularity may commonly be longer in these first couple of years.<br>  <br>  During the first two years after a girl begins having periods, up to 50% of the cycles occur without ovulation. By about 5 years after the onset of menses, 80% of the cycles have ovulation occurring within them. Without ovulation, the timing of menstrual cycles is not too predictable which is why periods are so variable during the first two years after they have begun. <br>  <br>  There are other reasons why a girl could go for an extended period of time without a period. However, you can see that it is quite normal for a girl to have somewhat irregular periods during the first two years of menses. Barring concern for pregnancy or other health problems that could be a factor in not menstruating, many doctors wait until two periods have been missed before doing any significant evaluation for causes.<br>  <br>  The most common causes for missed periods in teenagers are pregnancy, stress, and a condition called polycystic ovaries. I would suggest that you talk to your Mum about this and have her call your doctor to discuss this matter in order that he/she may decide whether or not it is necessary to make an appointment. <br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|K2jT1z5jaa	they are irregular darling<br>  some ladies do get it this way.<br>  Try getting on birth control. it will regulate your period. they are used for this aswel as bc.<br>  <br>  godbless x|`|wjxnvp58aa	i'm on the same boat as you are...get on Birth Control asap.

I thought this was an important topic to share with you because the reality is that most people simply don't realize how dangerous their excess abdominal fat really is to their health.<br>  <br>  The Hidden Dangers of Your Excess Abdominal Fat - It's More Serious Than a Vanity Issue!<br>  <br>  by Mike Geary, Certified Nutrition Specialist, Certified Personal Trainer<br>  <br>  Did you know that the vast majority of people in this day and age have excess abdominal fat? The first thing that most people think of is that their extra abdominal fat is simply ugly, is covering up their abs from being visible, and makes them self conscious about showing off their body.<br>  <br>  However, what most people don't realize is that excess abdominal fat in particular, is not only ugly, but is also a dangerous risk factor to your health. Scientific research has clearly demonstrated that although it is unhealthy in general to have excess body fat throughout your body, it is also particularly dangerous to have excess abdominal fat.<br>  <br>  There are two types of fat that you have in your abdominal area. The first type that covers up your abs from being visible is called subcutaneous fat and lies directly beneath the skin and on top of the abdominal muscles.<br>  <br>  The second type of fat that you have in your abdominal area is called visceral fat, and that lies deeper in the abdomen beneath your muscle and surrounding your organs. Visceral fat also plays a role in giving certain men that "beer belly" appearance where their abdomen protrudes excessively but at the same time, also feels sort of hard if you push on it.<br>  <br>  Both subcutaneous fat and visceral fat in the abdominal area are serious health risk factors, but science has shown that having excessive visceral fat is even more dangerous than subcutaneous fat. Both of them greatly increase the risk your risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, sleep apnea, various forms of cancer, and other degenerative diseases.<br>  <br>  Part of the reason visceral fat is particularly dangerous is that it apparently releases more inflammatory molecules into your body on a consistent basis.<br>  <br>  If you care about the quality of your life and your loved ones, reducing your abdominal fat should be one of your TOP priorities! There's just no way around it. Besides, a side-effect of finally getting rid of all of that excessive ugly abdominal fat is that your stomach will flatten out, and if you lose enough stomach fat, you will be able to visibly see those sexy six pack abs that everyone wants.<br>  <br>  So what gets rid of extra abdominal fat? Is there actually a REAL solution beyond all of the gimmicks and hype that you see in ads and on commercials for "miracle" fat loss products?<br>  <br>  The first thing you must understand is that there is absolutely NO quick fix solution. There are no pills or supplements of any sort that will help you lose your abdominal fat faster. Also, none of the gimmicky ab rockers, rollers, or ab belts will help get rid of abdominal fat either. You can't spot reduce your stomach fat by using any of these worthless contraptions. It simply doesn't work that way.<br>  <br>  The ONLY solution to consistently lose your abdominal fat and keep it off for good is to combine a sound nutritious diet full of unprocessed natural foods with a properly designed strategic exercise program that stimulates the necessary hormonal and metabolic response within your body. Both your food intake as well as your training program are important if you are to get this right.<br>  <br>  I've actually even seen a particular study that divided thousands of participants into a diet-only group and an exercise/diet group. While both groups in this study made good progress, the diet-only group lost significantly LESS abdominal fat than the diet & exercise combined group.<br>  <br>  Now the important thing to realize is that just any old exercise program will not necessarily do the trick. The majority of people that attempt getting into a good exercise routine are NOT working out effectively enough to really stimulate the loss of stubborn abdominal fat. I see this everyday at the gym.<br>  <br>  Most people will do your typical boring ineffective cardio routines, throw in a little outdated body-part style weight training, and pump away with some crunches and side bends, and think that they are doing something useful for reducing their abdominal fat. Then they become frustrated after weeks or months of no results and wonder where they went wrong.

5KxklhJCaa	The doctors will notify workers comp when you reach MMI and at that point a doctor who is certified by the state to do evaluations will evaluate you. Once you reach MMI you will no longer draw your Temporary Disability Benefits (your weekly/bi-weekly check) unless you have a permanent disability then you will continue to draw the weekly check but it will be deducted from your settlement once it is settled.  <br>  <br>  The doctor will determine the percentage of total disability you have based on preset medical criteria from the "Blue Book". That disability percentage will be added to your age, education, prior employment, train-ability, transferability of your job skills and the FCE to determine your settlement amount. This all assumes you have a permanent disability and cannot go back to your old employer. Any settlement you receive should include continued medical care (for the injury only) but that is negotiable in some states. Any settlement will have to be approved by the state's workers compensation administrative judge that is assigned to your case. You do have the right to have an attorney and in most states their fees are tightly controlled and limited.<br>  In most states an attorney is not needed but you always have that option.<br>  <br>  You need to coordinate any doctors visits through workers comp for prior approval, failure to do so can limit what they will pay or possibly allow them to not pay at all. <br>  You have the right to seek another opinion but if you don't follow procedures you can end up spending money needlessly and it will be unrecoverable in most instances. Always follow the procedures as outlined by your state and openly communicate with your caseworker at every step.<br>  <br>  Use all the resources available from the state and if you feel the need consult an attorney but try to use all the states resources first. Ask questions of the state and your caseworker, the insurance company is regulated and the caseworker cannot lie to you.

XgxW3as5aa	well they'll numb the area before they extract your tooth so you wont feel much. with braces, i dont care what anyone says, it hurts for 3 days the first day dont count though, but until late at night or early next morning you wont be able to eat anything hard. or at least that what happened to me. and in the begining food will forever be stuck on your braces. you have to learn how to eat with them. but its something that you naturally get used to. and if your about to be 16 and im guessing you'll be 18 when you graduate..so im guessing you'll probably graduate with them. it depends on the month you actually get your braces put on. if you follow the ortho's rules like putting on your rubberbands then it should be 2 years, they r mostly right. if you dont do what they say, you can screw yourself and have them on longer. my boyfriend when he put it on was in 7th grade and he didnt get them off until the begining of his senior year of high school..lol. he never put on his rubberbands. when they took them off they had to put the bottom braces back on since he didnt wear his retainers afterwards lol. so just listen to your dentist. and your dentist can give you a very good estimate on the exact month that the braces will be removed. hope i helped and good luck|`|DCcumpkOaa	i dont know about teeth extractions, but i can tell u anything u want to know about braces. i am 16 and just got them off o tuesday! wooohooo. i think i got them on two years ago, about 14 or 15. and yes, it takes 2 years to keep braces on for most kids. ull DEF have them off by graduation. dont worry. and no it doesnt matter how old you are!|`|dcd11iUwaa	i got 4 teeth pulled out and braces for 4 years<br>  i didnt notice any change of my general face structure.|`|90qBWGmJaa	I only have done teeth pulling, but I know how they do it.  *TIP* EAT EAT EAT before the operation.  You may not eat for a whole day (if your soft like me and hate pain) and you will get hungry.<br>  Now, this depends what your dentist does.  This is how they normaly do it.<br>  1. They give you "laughing gas" (you may not really laugh)<br>  2. They rub gel on your gumbs<br>  3. you will get "mosquito bite" (small pinch, only part that hurts)<br>  4. they wait for your gumbs.<br>  At this point, they will wait.  You will slowly feel them getting bigger and bigger.  It might also feel as if they are asleep.  It doesn't hurt.<br>  5. They prepare to take out teeth.<br>  When they take the teeth out, it won't hurt AT ALL (I was surprised by this) you will hear poping and cracking noises in your mouth, and they will take it out quickly and put gause between your gumbs.<br>  6. Done!  Your lips/ gumbs will feel like that for a wile, (stay near a sink and change gause, you will drool and drool.) but after, it will depend how well he did it on how much the gumb hurts.  Sometimes, it wont hurt after, and sometimes it hurts.  But eventually, the pain goes away.  There is also another option that doesn't include the "mosquito bite".  Talk to your dentist.  But after it's done, its done.  I have had 4 teeth pulled, it wasn't that bad.  It was for a day or two, but not anymore.  It really helps. (BTW after be careful what you eat....you might try to bite on something with a tooth that isn't there anymore!)  That's all I can give you.  Talk to someone else for braces information!|`|SMF7tA8baa	i had braces from 15-17 didnt really hurt at all.<br>  <br>   when you get teeth pulled, you are numb so you wont feel much. but after it will hurt a Little, mainly when you eat. they give you prescription painkillers to take home, so that helps too.|`|AuM57Q7Aaa	I don't know if it changes your face...I think mine looks the same.<br>  <br>  I had 2 teeth extracted...........I thought it hurt REALLY bad....but it may have been all in my head, because the first one hurt like heck, the 2nd one didn't bother me too much! <br>  <br>  I think you can ask for more...but I don't think they use gel, I think they use shots. <br>  <br>  They said 3 years for me, I ended up having them for 6...but that's because we didn't keep up with them. just keep up and good care with them. <br>  <br>  for me they hurt REALLY bad...but mouth pain is weird for me...it always hurts more than anything else<br>  <br>  haha. sorry this is a ridic. long answer.|`|XEGG1l6Raa	hey, well im 19 half way though the treatment. yes they hurt! im in pain right now....well every month i am..=[ when they change the rubber bands<br>  <br>  yeah i had four extractions..and my wisdom teeth are coming out so...it will be 2 more=[<br>  <br>   it does hurt but they will prescribe you antibiotics and pain relievers. it does change the structure of your face for the better of course. i did notice a change. they say two years..yes that approximately correct. <br>  <br>  but all the pain its worth it...it is..take my word for it=]<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  sorry if i confused you..im in pain right now..=[

Also, as we age, your metabolism is not the same so we have to work a little harder to off-set it.

PkUBJMd9aa	What is normal semen? <br>  <br>  Semen is usually white or grey, but can occasionally appear yellowish. Pink or red semen suggests that blood is present. Although this is only rarely due to a serious health problem, men with semen that seems bloodstained should seek advice from their family doctor.<br>  <br>  Semen clots almost immediately after ejaculation, forming a sticky, jelly-like liquid. It will liquefy again in 5 to 40 minutes. It is quite normal for semen to form jelly-like globules and this does not indicate any health or fertility problem. Failure of clotting and subsequent liquefaction can cause fertility problems. <br>  <br>  The average volume of semen produced at ejaculation is 2 to 5ml. Volumes consistently less than 1.5ml (hypospermia) or more than 5.5ml (hyperspermia) are probably abnormal. Lower volumes may occur after very frequent ejaculation and higher volumes are seen after prolonged abstinence. <br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped xx|`|hqR6qAlFaa	That's your semen.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen</a>|`|OXzv6bPeaa	drinky drinky|`|bGcYp6oPaa	yes it helathy to be thick it means ur balls are making more sperm meaning ur more fertile|`|6MW8dD9Gaa	its good news if you want to get someone prgnant lol|`|W2z5dCrmaa	That's normal ollie e Haha!<br>  <br>  It can be all kinds of consistencies, depending upon how often you release it, if you are dehydrated a little bit, and even by what you eat.<br>  <br>  If you come off frequently it gets more watery.

pa7hVLAHaa	Hmmm... seems like you have seen many doctors and they are all scratching their heads trying to solve your mystery.  You have suffered from a few migraines in the past and recently you had a terrible one (so the docs say).  Many times migraines can be the result of some sort of dietary sensitivity/allergy.  Think about it...  Suppose you have a food allergy.  You have eaten this particular food your entire life and you continue to eat it almost every day.  In the mean time, your body is mounting a full attack on the food item that it sees as a foreign invader.  We'll see the common response: systemic inflammation including in the sinuses of the cranial cavity putting pressure on various structures and nerves.  <br>  <br>  Now you're getting stressed out, thinking you have some serious condition.  You're frustrated that the docs aren't finding anything.  You may be losing sleep, or having IBS.<br>  <br>  While you're waiting for you docs to come up with something you should try an elimination diet.  <br>  <br>  Keep a 7 day food diary noting everything you eat and the subsequent symptoms you feel (including, but not limited to your migraines). Once you have collected your data, analyze it to see when your symptoms are the worst. Try to correlate that with what you ate earlier that day.<br>  <br>  Next try an elimination diet. Eliminate one of the suspected foods from your diet for 2-3 weeks. If your symptoms improve then you've found the culprit. If not, then try the next suspected food.<br>  <br>  FYI: the top food allergies/sensitivities in this order are<br>  -dairy (milk, cheese)<br>  -wheat (gluten)<br>  -eggs<br>  -soy<br>  -nuts (almonds, peanuts)<br>  -corn<br>  -shellfish

HcS8vzNCaa	You sound fit, yet you have an annoying problem with large ankles, or, as you put it, muscular cankles.  The definition of cankle is an aesthetically unfortunate physiological condition which leaves its victims with no discernable narrowing of the ankle between the calf and the foot.  The term cankle is a word that combines calf and ankle, underscoring the condition when the calf and ankle do not appear separate.  The root causes of this problem are obesity, bad circulation or water retention. <br>  <br>  Obesity is obviously not the cause in your case, although most people who suffer from this condition are obese women.  Charlotte York from "Sex in the City" is one of the many sufferers, and she is certainly not obese  by any means.<br>  <br>  The scientific term for fluid or water retention is edema, and there are certain foods and herbs you can take to help alleviate the problem.  The second source below will guide you toward foods which may help you alleviate your cankles.  <br>  <br>  It is possible your condition may be a form of lymphedema, defined as <br>  the accumulation of lymph in soft tissue with accompanying swelling, often of the extremities: sometimes caused by inflammation, obstruction, or removal of lymph channels.<br>  <br>  Restriction of salt intake is important for edema sufferers.  People suffering from edema should avoid adding great amount of salt into their food or consume preprocessed food with a salty taste.<br>  <br>  Elevating your legs may also help clear up this condition, especially after your workouts.<br>  <br>  The main thing is to get  some professional help with this, to consult with a physician who can  recommend treatments that  will help you.<br>  <br>  God bless you.  May your cankles disappear quickly.|`|zzaScg0haa	Weight lifting focusing on your lower body
BeSZ4nXraa	It is normal for breasts to hurt or feel tender or sore around the time of your period (usually right before or during).  Also, they are likely still growing which can make them sore too.  Wired bras should not hurt if they fit properly, but most women wear bras that are the wrong size.  If the wire is poking you then the bra is the wrong size.  There is no link to breast cancer and grapefruit that I have heard of.|`|1rRw5e1Eaa	I'm pretty sure that grape fruit does not cause breast cancer.  Chill.  It's normal for breasts to hurt.

It definitely helped me 'cope' with life, i.e. handle things more effectively without intrusive thoughts and stressors taking over my thinking.  Why have people told you not to take it?  As with most anti-depressants, it has initial, perhaps irritating side effects: for me, they were headaches (not terrible) for the first few days, itchy scalp, dry mouth - just minor annoying things like that, but if you can, as with any drug *stick with it*.  It will take a few weeks for the medicine to build up in your system, but then it will kick in.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I hope this was helpful.<br>  <br>  Julie|`|lI3LwiJHaa	You should take it. If you are not depressed, then it won't have any effect. If you are, it'll bring you up to norm.

inH6jIrhaa	All right. What you probably need to do is get in and talk to your therapist and get your meds changed. No big deal. Don't think of your ex. there is nothing he can do to help you. Just tell your parents you need to get in to see your DR. and tell them you need to get in as soon as you can. Do you see a Dr. that can prescribe meds? if your therapist can't tell your parents you need to see a psychiatrist not a therapist. The psychiatrist has much more education, can prescribe meds and can help you much more. Be patient, sometimes it takes a few times to get the meds right but I would not wait any longer because the way your feeling can be dangerous and you really don't need to suffer any more and risk feeling even worse. Good luck and hang in there.|`|DEDlMHFhaa	All you need to do is find someone you trust. Remember you are not alone. Don't spend all your time alone in a house go out shop hang out with your friends.

zLkIGe5Taa	Yes, it should have been cleared after finishing the antibiotic.  I'm guessing it was azithromycin or erythromycin.  But if have an open relationship with your partner, then you can get reinfected again.
mAp90hEeaa	It smells because there is infection present and infection always smells.  Hopefully, you are on an antibiotic at this time and your doctor knows about the drainage.  Soaking in a hot bathtub daily and then gently pressing on the area will remove most of the drainage temporaily until it builds up again.  Something that might contain the drainage better would be to purchase the pull-up depends to use during this period to catch the drainage. Then, wear your boxers over them.  No one can tell you have them on, they have a built-in odor guard in the fabric and you can throw them away.  Surgery will be uncomfortable for a few days but you will be taking pain medication to make it more tolerable.  Sitting might be difficult for a while.  Often, about a week is needed to be able to go back to your usual activities.
yB8ALg6Laa	It depends on your heredity, but you may grow at least one or two inches taller. And if you don't, that is perfectly fine, don't mind what people say. If you're really desperate to grow tall, I have a exercise I use which has helped me grow three inches! I'm pretty short...4'8. All you have to do is kneel, then slowly stand up and stretch out by stretching your hands in front of your face. Within two or three months, you might grow two inches at the least! Hope I helped!
B12E4rYiaa	If this plan isn't working then you need to change it up the body gets used to a routine and doesn't respond anymore. Change how you eat how you workout, do a workout makeover. <br>  <br>  Go to youtube for visuals and ideas. I will suggest super setting, tri-setting and giant setting with your weights if you don't know what that is then you can check it out on youtube. It's simply back to back sets with no rest. It's an intense workout. <br>  <br>  The intensity of the workout is what burns fat and increases the metabolism. You should be counting calories writing everything you eat and drink down keep track it all counts. 1500 is a good amount.|`|pa7hVLAHaa	Try only eating ONLY vegetables, meat, nuts, fruit, dairy and tubers.  Don't eat any sugar (this means high fructose corn syrup, cane sugar, honey, maple syrup) at all, ever (fruit is ok).  Never eat anything that has ingredients that you can't pronounce.|`|8b34fb3b8669100814203bd289b81fc1aa	The only thing that should really help you is eating better. You can also try doing sit ups / curl ups everyday, it will make your stomach smaller....you can also go to the gym, walking a lot helps, so instead of taking the bus or train, walk, maybe get off a stop early to walk.|`|4wLbuw1baa	Hey, you could be gaining muscle! The goal is to lose body fat, not lose WEIGHT, right? And it never really looks like you've lost anything because you see yourself every day!|`|vgsK2fr5aa	you probley are but muscle ways more than fat so the weight u are putting on is muscle so its algud|`|a9BYPzKxaa	In my opinion, don't ever follow the scale.  Even though you're working out, it doesn't  mean the scale is gonna move because you're probably gaining muscle and muscle weighs more than fat.  You should measure yourself instead, and if you've lost inches then it's definitely working.  The end result we all want is our body to look different right?  So in order to do that, you're doing everything right as long as you're cutting calories as well.  Just because you're allowed to eat healthy foods, doesn't mean you can eat 100 of one item.  Apples for example are great, but you're not gonna lose weight if you eat 100 apples in one day.  You have to watch your calorie intake and make sure you increase your calorie output which clearly you're doing with all your exercises.  So from now on, just make a note of your inches but don't get on the scale because it can be very discouraging and bad for the morale.  That's the last thing you need.  Good luck, I hope this helps.  Take care.|`|Dys1Iebnaa	To lose weight, you have to improve your diet and exercise. so make sure you are eating healthier foods. as in fruits and veggies instead of chips.<br>  also if you eat white bread, you could switch to wheat bread. its really good. and make sure you are getting a variety of fruits and veggies, not the same kind every day. that way you wont  get sick of it and go back to your old eating habits.<br>  hope i helped(:|`|2jN4mADyaa	Take measurements of your body to see for yourself what your body changes are and remember that muscle gain may be the cause of the extra 6 lbs.

Yeast thrive in dark, moist, warm conditions...dirty or not! That is why common places to get yeast infections are the vagina, vulva, inner thighs, mouth, and around the anus. Men, as well as babies, can also get yeast infections too! Wet clothing, mesh/silk underware, perspiration, and not drying off good after bathing are a very easy way to get them. Solution: Don't wear wet clothing long, wear cotton panties, and keep your vagina and thighs dry. There are several other things that can attribute to multiple yeast infections. Number 1 would be antibiotics or other medications. You should ALWAYS be aware of side affects of any medication you take, don't count on the doctor telling you them with out asking. Hormonal fluctuations and certain things in your diet can help create a perfect breeding space for yeast because conditions are right and yeast thrives on sugars. It is not uncommon to have 2 yeast infections in a year. Yeast is on everybody, it just takes the right conditions and opportunities to spread and become out of control.|`|biKMQ2I1aa	you can get it many times. it can be brought on by not being clean, or allergies to soap or use of antibiotics|`|H6Lc79EOaa	Antibiotics cause yeast infections, have you been on them this year?|`|WW5Xp6ofaa	If they don't clean good down there<br>  AND dry off well down there.

If a female has sex while she has a yeast infection unprotected her boyfriend can have it and give it right back to her. He has to get treated too.  You have to try to stay dry and wipe good and watch what you are putting on your body.  Something you are using or doing is making the infection come back.|`|qPaeWZtqaa	I use to date this girl who use to get them quite often.

ZDC81VjZaa	First... rehydrate yourself.  One glass of water is NOT enough and in order to tell when you ARe rehydrated... your urine should be almost clear.<br>  <br>  Second - Rehydrate you skin.  Take a tepid bath (baby bath warm) and add about 1/4 cup Apple Cider Vinegar.  You will want to soak for not less than 15 minutes at least.  Pat your skin dry when finished.<br>  <br>  Third... no lotions with any sort of butter in them for first few days.  Instead, resort to a cooling gel like Aloe Vera or even Noxzema.  <br>  <br>  Fourth... after your skin has begun to turn more pink than red, then apply moisturizing lotion like Jergen's Natural Glow.  It's designed for all skin tones and as your skin continues to heal underneath, you'll have a nice tan developing while you moisturize.  Will not turn your skin orange but DO wash your hands after use.<br>  <br>  Fifth... Continue using Jergen's Natural Glow or perhaps a tan enhancer of some sort for tan aftercare to maintain your tan. <br>  <br>  Be more careful in the sun in the future!!<br>  <br>  <br>  For the Record:  Many lotions contain an oil of some sort and as with any burn, you never wat to apply oil or butter to that kind of injury.  A sunburn IS an injury.  It's a first degree burn more often than not but if you find you are blistering, then it is a second degree burn.  <br>  <br>  If you become faint or nauseated or are vomiting... seek medical help as you may be suffering heat exhaustion and need to be cooled down.<br>  <br>  Take care in the sun in the future.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Unless you have a medical professional specifically tell you to douche, don't ever do it.  It removes the good bacteria in the vagina and can cause yeast and other infections.  It is highly recommended that women not douche.<br>  Is douching safe?<br>  <br>  Most doctors and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) suggest that women steer clear of douching. All healthy vaginas contain some bacteria and other organisms called the vaginal flora. The normal acidity of the vagina keeps the amount of bacteria down. But douching can change this delicate balance. This may make a woman more prone to vaginal infections. Plus, douching can spread existing vaginal infections up into the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries. <br>  <br>  <br>  What are the dangers linked to douching?<br>  <br>  Research shows that women who douche regularly have more health problems than women who do not. Doctors are still unsure whether douching causes these problems. Douching may simply be more common in groups of women who tend to have these issues. Health problems linked to douching include: <br>  <br>  vaginal irritation, <br>  vaginal infections called bacterial vaginosis or BV, <br>  sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and <br>  pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) <br>  Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of a woman's uterus, Fallopian tubes and/or ovaries. It is caused by bacteria that travel from a woman's vagina and cervix up into her reproductive organs. If left untreated, PID can cause fertility problems (difficulties getting pregnant). PID also boosts a woman's chances of ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy in the Fallopian tube instead of the uterus). Some STDs, BV, and PID can all lead to serious problems during pregnancy.

mqXyDTwwaa	I've taken clen pills, but the principle is the same. If your max dosage is .8 to 1 cc, then you need to start out with about .1 cc, for one or two days, until you can deal with the side effects, then increase to .3 cc, then up every few days until you reach your max dosage. You're going to be uncomfortable, because if you're not then you're not taking enough. Just try to keep the dosage slightly less than unbearable.<br>  <br>  Drink LOTS of water, and take taurine and potassium supplements, to prevent cramps.

Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ?

Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat.

Ii0PpO8naa	The walls in radiology (as well as the ceilings and floors) are lined with lead to absorb any scatter radiation that would even reach them.  There isn't even all that much in the room a few feet from the machine.  So anywhere you were in the hallways or near doors you have nothing at all to worry about.<br>  <br>  The lead wall thing is why we can't have a radio in our department - the lead blocks the signal coming in.  Some areas of the department don't even get cell phone service because of the lead walls.

It can take several months to several years.  Men and women often carry the virus with no signs or symptom…sadly women do seem to carry the larger burden of the virus.  <br>  <br>  The HPV test that is most commonly used does not tell us what specific HPV types we carry we know by testing positive that we carry on of the 13 high risk HPV type the test screens for.  There are several new HPV test that will screen for specific HPV types…but thus far none of these tests have been approved by the FDA….so they can be costly….some doctors are in clinical trails for some of these more specific HPV type testinf…and may not charge for them.<br>  At this time…it doesn’t really help to know what specific high risk HPV type we carry…because the treatments are the same….removing the abnormal cells that the virus creates….once these cells are removed the body often builds the natural defense it needs to fight the virus.<br>  <br>  You and your partner will not ping pong the virus back and forth…in some  women condoms do seem to help the virus regress…and condoms often give the body more healing time…after a treatment. …condoms are not necessary for the long term…just a couple of clear paps.  Talk this over with your partner...open communication is important.<br>       <br>  <br>  A good site to learn more about cervical cell changes:<br>  <br>  www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/understand... <br>  <br>  Learning more about the virus will help you and it will help her…there is no reason that you can’t be with her in every way…don’t allow this virus to come between the love that you and your partner share.<br>  It would be wise for you to seek a good doctor that will exam your genital area…looking for any almost invisible warts or lesions.  <br>  <br>  Information on an ANDROSCOPY will follow.<br>  <br>  I have provide links and articles...for me knowledge gave me power..<br>  <br>  I wish you and your partner well.<br>  <br>  <br>  There is no need to stop having sexual contact with your partner if she is tested for the virus and finds out she has HPV.

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	The old fashioned ways are best.  There are some cough suppressants available that you can use with both children, but you will want to consult with a pediatrician for the dosages first.  Aside from that, keep them propped upright, in nearly a sitting position, so things drain down to the stomach easier.  Cool down the temperature of the room slightly, and use a humidifier or vaporizor to get moisture into the room.  The three year old can suck on hard candy- but to be safest, see if you can find safety suckers to use.  Ordinarily you hate to give them sugar on such a regular basis, but in this case it will help.  Sucking on the candy will help them make more spit, to thin out the gunk with and get it down or out a bit easier.  Try to get them to drink a lot of liquid, but stay away from dairy products.  Dairy won't hurt them, but it coats the mouth and throat so they will want to gag or cough more with it.  If they don't have sore throats, citrus juice also helps cut through the gunk as well, but it will burn a little sore throat.  Citrus juice is also best if cut half and half with water as well.  When mine were that age, we spent a lot of nights sleeping in my bed with loads of pillows to prop me and them up- usually one on either side.  We also spent a few nights with  me propped up in bed with one, and dad in the recliner with another one.  Your one year old may do better on your lap, leaned up against your body to stay upright.  Finally, a bulb syringe, like you used on baby noses- can be helpful with the little ones that won't spit, and snuffle it back down.  They don't much appreciate it, but if you hold the bulb in one hand and the kleenex in the other- your three year old will catch on really fast to the idea of spitting and blowing.  The one year old will not, unfortunately.  If the cough interferes with them eating, you need to call the doctor.  Keep an eye on the diaper and bathroom calls to make sure they are getting enough fluid to.  There should be a nature call at least every 3-4 hours with them both.  And room temperature liquids are less likely to trigger a coughing bout than cold ones.  And finally, a cough that lasts more than a week, if there is fever, or if the sound of the cough is more like a bark than a cough- you need a doctor as well.  For the moment, I suggest calling for recommendations and dosages on medicines.  There are some designed to use with both of your babies.|`|XaRBewgXaa	lemon juice with honey usually stops the inflammation of the throat and thus reducing the coughing.|`|T389Yzi3aa	Pickle juice works for us every time! <br>  <br>  Honey is great but no honey for the little one...there is still a risk for botchalism at that age.<br>  <br>  Strawberries will help-they are high in vitamin c and will help them get better fast.|`|rt4OnxkYaa	warm bath... or boil some water and put a towel over their head and the pot so they can breath in the warm steamm... or some vicks on their chest.|`|NK2Q00Avaa	A warm mixture of lemon and honey in water always helped me when i was a kid

But you need to find the real reason you are getting so mad.  Take a breath and walk away, is always a easy thing to do.  <br>  Hope that helps

cw42LOLBaa	You don't have panic disorder... you might suffer panic attacks every so often, but here is the two types of panic disorders right from the DSM:<br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/pncdiswaphob.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disord...</a><br>  <br>  and <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/pncdiswoaphob.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disord...</a>|`|ParFJxnSaa	View the techniques for control of anxiety/panic attacks, in section 8, at ezy build, below. Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious). Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing: (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense. Similar, but simpler advice, from a clinical psychologist is to breathe in to the count of 3: (one thousand one; one thousand two; one thousand three) each takes around a second to say to yourself, in your mind. Then breathe out to the count of 3. Repeat, until it begins to take effect. Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, [page N first] or 42, [page i first] respectively). <br>  <br>  The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause, which is usually anxiety; read section 1, and examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/choose/</a> websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them, which is enough for some people. Visualise as vividly as possible, a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to us either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack.<br>  <br>  Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising - saying it to yourself in your mind). Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, which requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. Imagine that the cause of your panic; your anxieties, fears, your self doubts, self recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids"; every painful "I-can't-do-it" are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by.|`|AA11348638	I have panic disorder and here is what happened to me...I was so scared of having a panic attack I would get myself so worked up I would actually have one and say that I had a panic attack in an elevator, the next time I got in an elevator the feeling would come back.  You usually associate those feelings with the same kind of situation that made you have one before.|`|zDhSWcJYaa	From what you have described you show all the symptoms of having a anxiety or panic attack disorder. The latter being the more severe of the disorders. The first thing to do is accept your not on your own. Million upon million of people suffer these conditions world wide. Over 19 million in America alone are confirmed with these conditions with the numbers growing rapidly due to the current economic situation,ion.<br>  As to seeking a cure there are many ways to go, from just getting your own head around the issues confronting you and sorting them out or seeking professional assistance from registered medical professionals. My recommendation would be that you look at a program called <a href="http://www.beatanxietypanicattacks.com/joe-barry-anxiety-release-method-review.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.beatanxietypanicattacks.com/j...</a> which is a very detailed system with audio, video and detailed written material that the latest and most up to date information following on from the Panic away system that had so much success.

5QKAuezOaa	You need to be checked. A fever that long is a sign of something serious. Call your local hospital and ask them to refer you to a medical clinic that provides low or no cost care. I know you don't have insurance, but you need to get this under control before you possibly end up in the hospital. God bless.|`|gX7c2mKWaa	Geez, a fever for that long.<br>  I would suggest, go see a doctor?.It sounds pretty serious.<br>  If you can't, just stay in bed all day. Stay as warm as possible, even if you sweat, let yourself sweat. Also, take multiple naps, as much as needed. Drink LOTS of water, it doesn't matter if you pee a lot, it helps. Take your medicine regularly.<br>  Try your best and rest, don't go out or anything, just rest.<br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  P.S...Buy those fever medicines that are like a bottle of sweet liquid, those are useful..

qwtbjQ2Eaa	Heavy prolonged bleeding can be a sign of fibroid cysts. They can also be small tumors. They are more then likely NOT cancer tumors but they need to be looked at. You do not bleed like that without a reason. A doctor in Mexico is cheap because he is not certified in medicine. He just throws a sign up that says DOCTOR and people believe him. Please tell her to go to a doctor that accepts medicare or free clinic. She needs to have an ultrasound. The pills were probably birth control pills, they sometimes shrink fibroids.|`|gfHutvEFaa	MEXICO?? They have free clinics and health department's in the U.S. That is where she should go. SERIOUSLY.<br>  <br>  If she hasn't went through menopause then it sounds like she has DUB: Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding. If she has already gone through menopause (which I doubt) she has post menopausal bleeding. Either way, pills DONT WORK. EVER. Tell her to go to a U.S doctor.

8436981597659ae2a44f3a6c63d4a5c7aa	I rarely differ with Footprintz but I have prescribed astigmatic Rx's up to 11.00.   6.00 is not the limit.  <br>  <br>  With that Rx in the right eye, but little in the left, such glasses are unlikely to be helpful, but the eye will not get better or worse because of having the Rx or lack of it.<br>  <br>  You may benefit from having whatever mild Rx is in the left eye, for when you want best possible vision, with a zero Rx lens in the right, preserving the binocular state you've always been happy with.<br>  <br>  The difference between the two eyes is such that they are unlikely in the extreme to work together each having its full RX.<br>  <br>  If for any reason it is advisable or necessary to give the right eye its full Rx, this will best be done with a contact lens, but that will be a custom fit, in either soft or rigid material, and not one of the more common planned replacement lenses.  I have had contacts made for a -8.00 cyl on at least one occasion.|`|aiBOMU9kaa	I think you are misreading the prescription, your cylinder correction would be- 5.75 , not -7.75.<br>  <br>  The keratometer reading confirms that also. 38.75 - 44.25 = 5.50...rounded off<br>  <br>  Cyl corrections never go over 6.00<br>  <br>  But even at  -5.75...it is about as severe as it can get.<br>  <br>  Your astigmatism probably isn't all corneal either, which presents a more complicated problem to do much about.<br>  <br>  I would presume you have seen an ophthalmologist about it. I would go with his opinion.<br>  <br>  EDIT ****<br>  <br>  My apologies about the 6.00 being the max. <br>  <br>  At least 2 optometrists have told me that in the past, that they have never prescribed over a 6.00 cyl because it wouldn't help, or make any difference.<br>  <br>  In 39 years I have never seen a prescription higher than 6.00 for a cyl power either.<br>  <br>  But, it's never too late to learn something new is it...|`|BOaaKdViaa	The second set of numbers are called K's.

mwEIusKIaa	Hi Carolyn,<br>  The answer is no.  You have a cold because your immune system is weak.  Your immune system is weak because your cells are not getting the right amount of nutrients in vitamins and minerals.<br>  <br>  What you should be doing instead is consuming more fresh fruits and vegetables in your daily diet.  The USDA recommendation is 5 to 9 servings per day.  A serving is about half of a measuring cup.<br>  <br>  To help you immediately with your cold, you should take a Carotenoid Complex supplement made of  natural fruits and vegetables to protect your cells and boost your immune power.<br>  <br>  You do not have to get sick from the many lifestyle dis-eases.  Your health, your intellegence, your energy, and your appearence are dependent on you replenshing your vitamines and minerals several times a day.<br>  <br>  You need to understand that illness and disease are not "caught".  One doesn't catch cancer, heart disease or a cold.  You create these ailments with deficiencies based on what you eat or do not eat.

eNulfbs7aa	k..first you are DEFINITELY NOT a looser and you don't need to die..that would make me soooo sad since I love answering your questions...what would I do with my time???  These people need to get a life...and not take any more of your life or time.  I know reporting can be a bit scarey..but you totally need to do it.  They are about to push you to hurt yourself and that makes me angry.  If you are in school..you need to talk to the school leader and give them a heads up on what is happening...but you totally need to talk to your parents and tell them what is happening.  You have to remember that this age will pass...and you will only have to put up with them for what will seem like a LONG time..but in reality it is only a small time in your life.  Can you take any self defense courses?  Alot of times these are offered at recreational centers for just a small fee.  I would love to see you take some classes in martial arts without their knowledge.  When someone comes at you...you will know how to effectively take care of them.  You might want to go onto YOUTUBE...I bet you could find some "effective" tools to use there.  I can't stand bullies...I would be angry too...heck..I am angry that you are having to deal with this junk.  Check out You Tube...see if someone can give you an idea of some self defense moves...then give them some of their own treatment...but make sure you tell ppl what is up..so it doesn't backfire on you.  I know this is rambling..but that makes me mad....maybe I will go onto You Tube too..yes...I think I will..c u there.|`|U0KCmsKXaa	Why are you getting into fights?  Maybe you should stop hanging out with these people.  It's not that hard.  <br>  <br>  I know you said you didn't want to hear it, but it's hard to ignore how bad your spelling is.  Stay in school and work on your grammar.|`|cp7fjeJhaa	tell your parents or teacher or counselor that these girls are bothering you, if they are picking on you say yea whatever and walk away from them........you have to tell someone no one is allowed to hit you, it's against the law, call the police if you have to..........|`|LddkW0JFaa	Get yourself a can of pepper spray and spray it in your bullies' eyes.|`|rfxSQbwuaa	why are u going and fighting u are a girl so treat like agirl ok your duty is inform the police not go and fight|`|GZCcHr0kaa	Well, I would say first you need to tell a parent, then a teacher what is going on.  I am assuming this is at school?  Also, try the school counselor.  I am betting he or she will have some good ideas about how to deal with the bullies.  You know, this actually has nothing to do with you, or anything your doing wrong.  This is their insecurity and their sheeplike group mentality, the mob effect.  You have to take some kind of action, telling an adult, and in fact, you have been assaulted so you could even file charges.  Take power back in your own hands, not with violence, but with appropriate action.<br>  It doesn't matter how well you spell.  Anyone who would dare say something about that instead of the issue is shallow.  You are hurting and need help, you certainly don't need another bully.  God Bless You|`|6VF7IIyBaa	It sounds like you need to do something that you can put all your anger into. Have you tried writing in a journal? or maybe try doing some kind of physical activity like running or maybe boxing? Hope this helps:)|`|YwYxff87aa	Ok first thing, why don't you report people bullying you to adults or the local police???<br>  I mean, your not the bully if you stand up for yourself, just refuse to be the 'kid being picked on'. <br>  Your that worthy and valuable. You have family and friends that wouldn't like to see you in such scenarios. There are people willing to help. Just speak up, you don't necessarily have to fight back physically, but fight for who you are. And if you do snap, its because you've been under a lot of pressure, nobody can blame you!<br>  So please, do yourself a favor, fight for who you are and speak up. Talk to trusted adults. Good people can be found everywhere that are willing to help. Just look and you'll see.

It'd be great if there really was a natural way to fix teeth - but i'm afraid there isn't...    Don't let your appearance affect your self-esteem. Who cares what other people think! What they think wouldnt make a difference any way! =)  If they really do make a big issue out of your teeth, it seems like theyre more concerned about your teeth than you are. you can pull it off by saying something like 'SO WILL YOU GET ME SOME BRACES?

827993b38a683884568367c98043c28caa	I think there are like 2 or 3 types of kidney stones.<br>  <br>  Calcium Oxalate stones are caused by too little calcium in your diet.<br>  <br>  Uric Acid stones are caused by highly acidity in the urine.<br>  <br>  Several other minor types dealing with phosphate, magnesium, etc.<br>  <br>  I was on a diet consisting of a lot of carrots and bananas.  A lot.  other stuff too, but a lot of carrots and bananas.  Did i mention, there were a lot of carrots and bananas?<br>  <br>  The magnesium did me in.

OUCH! It's very VERY painful, I was told it's caused by dehydration, so I must drink AT LEAST 2 litres of water a day, the stone, I was told, is actually made up of salts, hence dehydration. Some people can pass their stones naturally by drinking plenty to flush it out, other can have treatment which pushes electricity through your body (I think) which brakes the stone up and then it's easier to pass, or others, like me must have an operation (or 2) to remove the stone if it is too large, and lodged.

AA11363680	Well, large muscle groups can take a week or so to heal if you really over do it. But that aside, let me ask this: Was it worth this much discomfort? If not, then set some limits with your boyfriend.|`|Gj5TCBPcaa	Just like any other muscle when you work it more than you're used to, it'll last a couple more days at the most, i've experienced this I think all women have at some point, in the mean time just take some sort of over the counter pain medication and you'll be fine.|`|UffpiRLZaa	well every one's body is diffrent just try not to have that rough of sex if it hurts your body that bad just tell him to ease up a bit..but that has happned to me and it lasted about 4 or 5 days soo its nothing to worry about..unless ur bleeding but just take a warm bath and maybe try a heating pad and drink lots of water to get ur blood flowing good again.|`|tNsgJTLOaa	well you need to think about how much it hurts. If it feels like something is pulled go to a doctor and if you're embarrased, say u were running and stumbled a bit haha. but really you shouldnt worry it shouldnt last more than a couple days|`|PaPXlWwIaa	the longest i was sore for was a day. take a hot bath and leave everything alone down there for a day or two|`|2Z7u3Fksaa	It shouldn't last much longer<br>  Just take some advil or vicodin
1lKbfD4naa	Size 10.5 is normal for a 5-8 person...<br>  <br>  What the hell do you mean by 3 inch basketball shoes? There is no such thing. That is so stupid.|`|TsjqzanQaa	"Doomed?"     Isn't that being a little melodramatic?<br>  <br>  There are worse things than not being tall.    How would you feel if you had a leg amputated?      5'8" and you're only 15, and there's a good chance that you will grow taller.<br>  <br>  But if you don't, you'll just have to deal with it.<br>  <br>  And there frequently are multiple growth spurts.   You're not finished with puberty yet.      You're not a man yet, but you are a young man.|`|E64juLwJaa	No dude:men can grow till they are in their early twenties:i grew 3 inches at age 23,<br>  So there is always hope.<br>  Planets.|`|02qFt8piaa	ur problebly still growing. but you can take growth hormones google it.
0mHi3S2Raa	Yep pretty much, Take your resume with you and drop it off at the places you'd like to work at.|`|HFZHI8VGaa	Yeah, you could that is a start. It makes it more personable too, make sure you look sharp when you go. So they remember you. Look in the news papers, I live in DC and they are always hiring in dental offices.
pa7hVLAHaa	Diphenhydramine, the active ingredient in most anti-histamines makes most people sleepy, though it gives me nightmares.|`|yE2vM76naa	Histamine is an excitatory neurotransmitter - stopping it (hence the ANTI-histamine) slows down brain processes, which indeed makes most people sleepy.    In fact, most over the counter sleep aids you find in a drug store are antihistamines.|`|HwIi9Tkwaa	yes it does work to put you to sleep if a higher dose is taken that the regular dose for allergies.  MY son has CP and sometimes has problems sleeping so his pediatrician has given his a strong dose of antihistamine to help him sleep but please get medical advice before self prescribing as they vary in strengths etc and you don't want an accident.  good luck.
LyPojBWIaa	there is no time limit on eating just dont eat too fast and make you food digest and sit in a mannerly posture while eatin..the steak is not good but the fruit is ok..u can have grains. nuts and stuff like that not too much tho try to keep your meal well balanced...and when you eat all that protien get some water to flush your system...  hope this helps
NGNeT3rYaa	This happened to my son too when he was 14 months old. He also hit his head that morning.The first one, he had no fever, they ran every test and they were all fine. We went home and he was fine for 5 months when another one hit...this time he did have a fever. They did another round of tests including a spinal tap, and we spent a week in the hospital bc they diagnosed him with epilepsy bc it was his 2nd one and then he caught an infection that nearly killed him in the hospital.He had a sever sinus infection at the time this happened although we had no clue, he wasnt sick to us at all just barely a runny nose.Often the seizure is the first sign of illness. These were regular adult dr.'s not pediatric specialist.Make sure you see a pediatric neurologist, bc they are the only ones that can make a correct diagnosis.The regular one told us somehting was wrong with his brain scan, the ped neuro said no way, nothing wrong at all.Adults results are far different from a childs. My son was put on meds, Tegretol. and everytime he ran a fever, that night it would spike and he would seize. He had 7 in all. It has now been 2 years and 5 days since his last one so there is hope. Even if he has epilepsy, at this age, he can still outgrow it. It is a tough, heartbreaking road and I pray that your son never has another. Sometimes kids can just have one and never have one again.It is called benign epilepsy of childhood. This was not something that ran in our immediate family either. His seizure could have still been a febrile seizure, as could my sons first one, bc the seizure takes down the fever and by the time he got to the ER, the fever could have gone away. Sorry to go on and on but if you need to talk, you can email me on my profile page, I have been there and know the fear you are dealing with and I would be more than happy to hear you out just to vent or answer any questions and share our experience.I take my son's temperature at different times a day, I know it sounds crazy but it was the first sign he would be sick bc he nver acts sick even when he has the flu! When you notice the fever, take him to the dr and see if there is an infection that antibiotics can help take care of before it gets out of control. Also, do NOT put them in a cold bath if they are running fever, that is the fastest way to send them into a seizure. All you can do is give tylenol and motrin, you can alternate every 3 hours and a cool rag on the head and pray. If one is going to happen it will and all you can do is feel helpless. I have had many sleepless nights let me tell you. He sleeps with us so that I can watch him like a hawk.It is good that the tests came back ok, that is a good sign. Hang in there, there is a light at the end of the tunnel.|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Because your son had been sick for the previous two days, that is the most likely explanation for the seizure.  As a parent, I know that's cold comfort and not likely to ease all your fears and worries.  But you have to understand that a toddler's system is very sensitive to things that wouldn't be any challenge to you or I.  If he were dehydrated as well, then that alone would be enough.  Not enough water in the system messed up adult thinking capacity, and it can trigger seizures in us as well.  Little ones have a lot less fluid total in their bodies, and it just happens a little faster.  I wish I could ease your fears about the future.  One seizure, with an illness and dehydration does not mean he is at higher risk to develop epilepsy.  And, now sit down and breathe.  I know where you sit at the moment, and I also know from the other side as well.  One seizure does not mean you have to take your brain down this road of fear.  A seizure is frightening, I know.   But about 5% of children will have one seizure at some point during childhood, and about half of those do not involve a fever either.  So you are not alone to experience this particular fright.  Most all of those kids grow up just fine, and never have another one ever again.  In my experience, the seizure is far more traumatic for the parent than it ever is for the child.  Your son will not remember the episode, while you will never forget it.   Every time your son gets sick, this nasty little memory will resurface and you will have to take a deep breath.  And because you are a parent, you are going to suck in fear no matter how old that baby gets to be.  Even if he's 80 and you are 100.  You are going to recall this, and probably mention it, and he'll look at you like you are nuts.  Your fear is okay, natural and expected.  Now you just have to sit down and get back in control again.  It will be okay.|`|mAp90hEeaa	Young children can have a seizure when ill but that does not mean he has epilepsy.  Some children have seizures every time they get a fever but still are not diagnosed with epilepsy and they eventually grow out of this.  You just have to wait and see what happens.  If he has more seizures when he is not ill, they will do an EEG (electroencephalogram) to trace his brain wave pattern and see if there is any abnormal electrical activity but in the meantime, just do the watch and wait.|`|WBZAszdzaa	It is not uncommon for infants to have a seizure however without a fever is notable. Did your baby recently have any vaccinations? If so take him to his doctor. Make sure you keep and eye on him and see if he stares a lot or his pupils are okay and even. Any abnormal signs and go back to hospital that saw him|`|TTLIp8Beaa	some kids have random seizures sometimes.<br>  it happened once while i was babysitting my neighbor's 3 month old. he had no history of seizure disorders and none ran in his family. he's now 6 and happy, and hasn't had once since!<br>  <br>  i'm sure your child will be fine. it was probably just from dehydration like the doctor said. <br>  <br>  epilepsy is characterized by multiple seizures. one or two won't be enough for the doctor to diagnose off of. my friend was diagnosed after 7 seizures with no obvious triggers. (normally things like pulsing beats and strobe lights trigger epilepsy) <br>  <br>  hope this helps & good luck!|`|jlQHB9dvaa	Doctors will usually only start looking for a condition such as epilepsy if there is a continuance of seizures, but not for having just one.  <br>  Your son's prolonged illness is most likely the reason, but keep a good eye on him.<br>  Hope he's well soon.|`|JIrud5INaa	Ok so this might be long so I'm just trying to help. I'll tell you a little bit of my story. I have epilepsy myself I am 22 started having them when I was 14. The first ever one I had was out of the blue also I was just helping my mom make supper and I was walking to the garbage to throw something away and there was the first one. I was discharged from the hospital they just said like they told you if it happens again it'll have to be looked into more in depth six months later what happened again. (Grand Mal) From the age of 14-22 I have had 7 Grand Mal seizures usually have one a year. Didn't last year woo hooo (knock on wood for this year). Then when I was 17 I was diagnosed with (Petit Mal) seizures I would have hundreds of those a day. Trust me high school was a nightmare I had my license suspended twice (thank goodness for my excellent friends) because of the epilepsy its a state law. I have had tons of tests done and they can't find where they start. The only "trigger" that they have found is strobe lights, stress, not getting enough sleep. To make a long story short I am on two medications now and haven't had any problems Lamictal and Zonegran. Hope I helped and didn't bore you too much with my little life story, I'm sorry that happened to your son I hope you find the answers you need!
lYQDCJgeaa	Lithium can make you gain weight.<br>  Just keep on exercising regularly, and you'll be fine.|`|zIma8YWYaa	PREGNAT|`|0gGvrUd1aa	I know this wont help...but im in the same boat....  try a program, like weight watchers. if excercise is not  your problem, maybe its what is your food consumption...keep a food diary.   try having a workout/dieting buddy, the extra motivation may help.  I have a thyroid disorder so i know if your balanced there then thats not the problem.  THey do say that our bodies change post baby...I hope this isnt true!  Best of luck.
gkThLcf2aa	To make a joint, you stick two to three papers or skins together, add your weed or hash, and tobacco if required, and roll it up, then you gotta get a pokey and stuff it all down to pack it more. (in europe its considered normal to mix hash or weed with tobacco in a joint, where as in the states generally just weed is used). Another difference between the states and europe is in the states, weed or grass is the most common form of marijuana, but in europe, hash or cannibis resin is most common. This being the case, tobacco was used to mix with hash in joints and the practice of mixing tobacco with the scarce weed just caught on.|`|zw6EJ2izaa	Joint for beginners.<br>  1.)

But joints are easy to roll for a quick high, but they get you really smelly.

jKmbJyxJaa	If you can go to the hospital they should give you anti-nausea medicine and fluids through an IV. Try to sip some gatorade, tea or water (nothing too cold or too hot) but if it makes you throw up again it wouldn't be worth it, as you would lose more fluids than you're taking in. You can also try some toast, plain rice, or crackers if you feel up to it. If you know anyone receiving chemotherapy or someone who takes heavy painkillers, they may have anti-nausea drugs and could spare one for you. They really help. If you have terrible nausea, you could take an antihistamine like benedryl and it may help. <br>  <br>  Ginger or peppermint tea are good for nausea, and I would advise against taking vitamin C because it can irritate your stomach.<br>  <br>  If you do not stop soon, it would be best to go to the E.R. if possible. Good luck!|`|jtjISk6qaa	go lay down and sleep. you'll feel better. you should try and have some gatorade to replenish the fluids. dont even have alot, just take small sips when you can. make some chicken soup and eat what you can. but seriously go lay down and rest.|`|EHQCkDaqaa	vitamin C will probably make your throat even more raw because of the citric acid. try gargling some salt water(for your sore throat).. drinking a little bit of water, or preferably Gatorade/Powerade/Propel(to get some of your electrolytes back) and at the most, you should eat toast (no butter) to get some calories.. <br>  <br>  if you are still having a major problem, you should go to the doctor. if you can't keep anything down, you could become extremely dehydrated, which is dangerous for your organs. your hands are probably just trembling from your body going through so much vomiting in the last hour. <br>  <br>  <br>  your cheeseburger may have had something bad in it, but usually it takes about 12 hours for food poisoning.

NEWbh3Plaa	You can still contract HIV even if he didn't finish in you.  If he has the virus it will be in the prec*m.  This goes for both oral and vaginal.  You can be tested right away but may not test positive for years.  Sorry to be the one to tell you, but it can stay undetectable for years.  Go talk to your doctor asap.|`|QYDYX9B7aa	Lower but still you aren't guaranteed safety. If his penis was rubbed raw and your vagina was rubbed raw, even a tiny amount of blood exchanged on the rubbed surfaces presents a risk of transmission.|`|zhk8o514aa	All it takes is body fluids.  Not just sperm. So yes you very well could have HIV right now.  So use protection.|`|DSp8azw7aa	Stop worrying about it, if you think you have it go get a blood test.|`|qZ0310yVaa	from what i no you haft to make blood to blood con tack|`|gSo4dR7oaa	ANY unprotected sex is a risk.  Risk of transmission of HIV through oral sex is lower than risk of transmission of the virus through any other sexual activity, but there is still risk.  Also, you are at risk whether he finished or not.  Also, you are correct in assuming that the fact that he has had multiple partners increases your risk.    The only way to find out if you have HIV is to get tested.  More than 98% of people who have HIV do test positive within 3 months, but in very rare cases, it can take up to 6 months for someone to test positive.  It could take up to 6 months to show up on tests if your immune system was damaged prior to HIV infection, because it would take your body longer to produce the antibodies.  Otherwise, 3 months is the recommended time frame.|`|2y3rFvZIaa	The oral is not really a big problem. But the unprotected vaginal, even if he didn't "finish" is. There is pre-ejaculatory fluid, which, IF the guy is HIV+ has HIV in it, which is just as dangerous as if he "finished".    No you don't have to wait 6 months, if you test at the end of 3 month and it is negative that will be a reliable result.|`|GKINbVhsaa	if the guy has HIV and you had oral sex then there is a chance that you could have it because some guys pre-*** a little. if you had vaginal sex with a condom then you have a better chance of not getting it, but if you didn't then its the same thing with the oral sex.    if you had sex with someone who you think has HIV then you should go see a doctor ASAP. But if you only think he has HIV, then you probably are fine.    hope everything turns out ok :(|`|kQ6x5Mokaa	uhhh, I think yuor chances of being paranoid are much higher|`|67be362fa9bfa1a21547a78f99144ed6aa	You are at risk every time you have unprotected sex of any kind.  The chances are reduced significantly if you use a condom, but the chance is still there.    The antibodies usually take about 6 weeks to 3 months to produce.  You should not be tested sooner than 3 months, just to ensure that you haven't gone before anything can be detected.  Even if you test at 3 months, get tested again after 6 months for confirmation.    Most tests look for the antibodies only; some detect the virus, but those are rarely administered because they're not in widespread use.    Go to your doctor ASAP - there's more than just HIV floating around out there and those diseases may be detected mere days after possible infection.    Lastly, don't have sex with people whose health and sexual pasts are not known to you.  And don't have sex with someone you're not comfortable addressing STDs and protection with.|`|v4gUI96yaa	Guys have pre ejaculation so even if you didn't finish there is still a chance   you do have to wait at least six months for an HIV test,however the minimum is 6 months it could take a few years to show..i hope you will learn from this ALWAYS strap up and don't depend on him to supply the condom,have your own handy.
S63ovAuZaa	i think it will make you lose weight but u will gain sickness, your body needs fibers these are found in veggies and meat, i think you might wanna try a more healthy diet, for me eating less is not a healthy diet, because you will get starved and alot of your body functions wont work properly, i say replace diet is the best (which is replacing the foods you like with foods you wont "hate" like skipping the afternoon ice creams with low fat jelly(that thing is dam good believe me it is)) so dont stop eating, move yourself a bit more, 15 minutes of minor exercise each day goes a long way, so my final answer would be dont and never get on that liquid diet.|`|5Qo6OWNzaa	Its unlikley whatever you are drinking will contain all the nutrients your body needs. But lets pretend it does...here is the main problem with a liquid diet.. if you dont believe me, ask Oprah..    You never learn how to eat right. You substitute a drink for a meal... you lose weight.. then when you reach your goal, OR you cant stand to drink another meal, you start eating again..but you havent learned how to make good choices, excercise regularly and the weight comes back..and probably a little more since your metabolism is on vacation.    www.atkins.com is a free site so you dont have to buy the book. I lost 50 lbs in 6 months learning to eat the right foods. That may be an option for you.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	I personally do not think its healthy. Your body needs a variety of solid foods in your system everyday for engery. Liquids are good, but they arn't good as a sole source of nutrition. Why not just try cutting calories. Like eat 1500 or 2000 calories a day, and exercise a little. that works the best.
AA10766729	Your grandmother had her period once or else YOU wouldn't be here (she had to have a period to have one or the other of your parents you know).  In other words, she's certainly not ignorant of how the female body works!<br>  <br>  The alternative of course is that you simply pack enough supplies to get your through your visit.  <br>  <br>  And just an FYI, if your mother knows, your  grandmother probably knows.

lThXTKbRaa	Hi there  I have just tapered off sertraline to reboxetine as i couldnt stand the loss of libido sertraline has given and extreme lack of motivation/lethargy.  So far so good, i have only been taking it for 7 days (4mg at mo and moving upto 8mg soon) and its wonderful, i had a few dizzy spells at first but all great now, i feel awake for the first time in 5 years when i wake in the morning, i feel more alert too.  It doesnt work for everybody as all anti d's are trial and error from person to person.  It can be combined with an ssri if needed as reboxetine (edronax) is a different type of drug, its a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor so i feel if my actually mood/anxiety is affected i can at least maybe take a small dose of sertraline too  hope that helps
EHQCkDaqaa	instead of eye drops, try flushing your eye with saline.. the other thing you can do is pull your eyelid away from your eye, and pull it down below the hairs on your lower lid, and let go. Thats how I usually get hairs & stuff out of my eyes. if you are still having problems, however, especially since it was an exfoliating scrub, you may have to go to the ER to make sure you didn't scratch your eye or anything. They will most likely prescribe something to you, an eye drop, to keep any infections from getting there.|`|calP45I5aa	If you can feel it but cannot see it you may have scratched the surface of your eye. . .I would suggest seeing a professional, as that can be very serious.|`|03f0a9d551a5416ac048517c4d07fe35aa	rinse rinse rinse rinse rinse<br>  then, if its still not out, lift up your eyelid, with CLEAN FINGERS!, try taking it yourself.

4onT0qUxaa	I used to have this problem with contacts and finally got Lasik because of it. Some people just have very sensitive eyes and will react to even the slightest debris on the lenses. Clean them very, very thoroughly, as any gunk on them will be trapped beneath the lens on your eye, causing an infection. Unless you are prepared to visit the opthalmologist for antibiotic drops, you should leave them out until your eyes have cleared completely and put them in when they have been cleaned properly. Or better yet, invest in a fresh pair!
AA10700407	it's recommended that you don't eat for 2-3 hours before going to bed, but as long as you don't go over your caloric allotment, it's OK to eat in the evening.|`|sYEf626Aaa	This is a myth. It does not matter when you eat but how much.

If you're watching your weight, just be sure that your late-night snacks are included in your designated caloric intake for the day (EX: say you are trying to eat 1500 cals/day... Save 200 or so for your late-night meal).    Late-night meals are also good for people who get up early to exercise, but do so on an empty stomach.
6bd5dc5ab362e218189d7e6247b7a2f6aa	The guidelines you refer to exist in the blue book, which is how most disability examiners (I am a former disability examiner for the social security administration) refer to the listing book, which is officially titled "Disability Evaluation under Social Security". <br>  <br>  The listing book, or blue book (it's called that because the cover is blue, no other reason) contains specific approval criteria for a number of mental and medical impairments...however, what many or most claimants do not realize is that:<br>  <br>   A) Most conditions are not listed in the blue book (for example, fibromyalgia is not listed).<br>  <br>  B) Some conditions are technically given a listing but are not truly given consideration as an impairment in their own right (bipolar disorder, which is listed in the blue book as a subset of affective disorders and is referred to in the book as "bipolar syndrome is a good example of this).<br>  <br>  and <br>  <br>  C) Most individuals who are approved for disability are not approved by meeting, or equaling, the requirements of a listing. Instead. they are approved for benefits by being given what is called a "medical vocational allowance".<br>  <br>  A medical vocational allowance is an approval that is made by determining what a claimant's current physical or mental limitations are. This is done by gathering and then evaluating the medical evidence. Then, the claimant's rated limitations (referred to as their residual functional capacity) are measured against the requirements of their past work, i.e. the jobs they've done in the past. If their current condition eliminates their ability to go back to one of  their past jobs, they may possibly be approved for disability. <br>  <br>  However, this is still contingent upon the claimant being determined to be unable to do some form of "other work". Other work is a broad concept and it basically includes any work that a person might reasonably be expected to perform based on their age, education, job skills and current physical and/or mental limitations. Individuals who are determined to be incapable of transitioning to "other work" will typically be approved for disability. <br>  <br>  The reason I bring all of this up is that you are focusing on "atypical presentation" and "symptomology" and "diagnosed conditions". This is simply not how disability claims are decided. As a former disability examiner for SSA, I can tell you that all cases are decided on the basis of functional limitations, which are indicated by the information presented in a claimant's medical records. <br>  <br>  So, in other words, the name of your condition, or your symptoms, are not really that relevant. What is important is how your condition limits you. And, more specifically, how your condition limits your ability to engage in work activity. <br>  <br>  Since you have a hearing coming up at some point in the near future, it will be very important for you and your representative (it is foolish to go before a federal judge representing yourself) to gather medical evidence that indicates your limitations. And this is why a qualified and competent representative (who is usually an attorney, but not always) will always attempt to obtain a detailed supporting "medical source" statement from your treating physician (a doctor who has provided treatment to you and is qualified to rate your limitations). This medical source statement, also known as an RFC, or residual functional capacity, form will explain in detail to the judge how limited you are, which justifies why you cannot be expected to go back to your past jobs or transition to some new type of other work.|`|29e999153715416dcc6bab042f16f0c4aa	I guess if you cannot work then you stand a good chance. I bought Nolo's Guide to Social Security Disability which says that if your illness cannot be categorized on their lists of acceptable conditions then they use other criteria to determine your case. Keep your chin up I'm sure it will come through and if you have legal (if not you should have done this) counsel then you should get it.|`|HZvdr8VLaa	It is difficult to get approved for headaches. What does your neurologist say? How does he say this condition affects your function? That question is the one the ALJ is trying to answer. Try to get a signed medical opinion from your neurologist stating your limitations, something to the effect of "you would be unable to maintain an 8 hour day or 40 hour week because of the symptoms of your condition". If his medical records contain corraberating evidence, the ALJ will need to come up with a valid basis for rejecting this opinion. A well documented opinion from a treating doctor is your best chance for being allowed.|`|AA11348638	It doesn't matter if he is interested in getting involved, they usually just have the records and send you to their own Doctor for verification...and do you have a separate Doctor for panic attacks and depression?  If you have this documented, you have a chance of getting a reward.  God Bless!|`|5e4e5962c54bcb263c9b3ff48d3408ecaa	First thing I would do is to get rid of the doctor who doesn't deal with disability cases and see a therapist or someone in that field who is trained to diagnose you properly. Based on the FD, I can't see how with your medical history that alone wouldn't be enough to get you what you deserve.  If this is the first time you are applying and you are doing it alone, you may have to try another time.  I hired an attorney after being turned down twice on my own and she did everything, I never even had to see the administrative law judge.  Alot of attorneys will take your case up front if they are certain they can win and get paid when you are awarded your benefits.  Hang in there and don't let the stress cause you to feel worse.  Have faith and do not give in, I know myself how hard it is to try to work when your body and mind is not doing what you need it to do.  Things will get better and as I said before, I would definitely see another type of doctor for your depression and panic attacks. They alone can make your physical condition worse.|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	Yeah it don't matter if he is interested in getting involved in the disability case.  Social Security can request the records from him and he has to send them.  All you have to do is call Social Security 1-800-772-1213 and tell them that you want them to request those records from him.  I think your chances of getting disability at this point are very good.  There is a listing of all of the disabling conditions.  It is called Appendix F of the Railroad Retirement Act.  I had a problem getting my disability for a long time because if the doctors don't document it exactly like they have it in this Appendix Social Security will not approve your disability.  Since you have a letter from the doctor supporting your claim I think you will be okay but you can maybe look up the Appendix F and check out your condition.
xFSXryiaaa	no i luv it!! luv luv luv the cramps!!  ;-)  ur right, it's mind-blowing that any girl would want to get a period.  i understand the stigma of being one of the last in ur class to get it, but its only aggravation and pain.  a long hot bath and tylenol usually works for me, before bed.  hope u can alleviate some of ur pain....|`|isA4wtnMaa	May sound odd, but I think the pain (or pain of any kind) will make you stronger.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	I was 5'4 and 185 ten years ago at my heaviest, and it was all in my stomach. Through healthy dieting and exercise, I got down to 115 and have stayed there ever since. I did almost all running and step aerobics to lose the weight. Start by walking 5 minutes, running 1 or 2, then walking 5, running 2, etc. until you can run farther.     However, even once you lose fat you'll probably still have stretched skin, making it look fat. For that I got a tummy tuck.|`|5oNwMqMiaa	Unfortunately it's very difficult to target one problem area so the best thing to do is aim for 45mins-1 hour of cardio a minimum of three times a week - walking/running, cycling, cross training etc and then introduce some resistance training (weights) and some ab crunches.  Teamed with a healthy diet will see you lose about 1-3 pounds a week, all over.  Good luck honey :-)|`|W3DaSJdFaa	Cardio is the best way to burn fat.And remember, cardio is considered any activity that makes your heart beat faster than when sitting still. So for beginners i suggest running for as long as you can and then once you get tired start walking.Then once you get your breath, start running again. The changing of pace like that is good for you anyways.If you do choose this routine, or any other serious exercise, try to include around 150-170 grams of protein a day (try protein shakes).When you start exercising, your body will try to get rid of the muscle first, but the high protein will counter that by keeping and building muscle.|`|wdNfee9Baa	yes for sure cardio with help.  walking everyday for 30mins a day will not only begin to show you results but make you feel healthier and happier.  Once it is getting too easy to walk for 30 mins move it up to a light jog and then eventually a run.  That will also get easy so move that time for 30 mins to 45 mins and then eventually to 60 mins a days.    You will easily lose weight this way and keep it off because it is a healthy way to do it.  That plus lots of water will help not only increase your metabolism but help you burn more calories than if you drank lets say pop.    Good luck and remember you can do anything you put your mind too :)|`|G2qc2k26aa	One thing you need to is that your body looses fat through out your whole body not just certain areas.  Therefore, you can't loose fat on your stomach alone. You can target your stomach by exercising your core and just doing cardio.  You will still loose fat throughout your body, but your core (stomach) will be more defined and stronger.  A great form of core training is Pilate's, simple light unbalanced weight training and the Ball.

7HSGZhOAaa	Hi, I'm sorry to hear about the struggles you have had to deal with in the past with your thyroid problem.  My mom has one as well so I can understand a little bit about what you are going through.  I also have a degree in Kinesiology and took a course on safe ways to lose weight.  In that class we learned that taking a conservative approach is best, like not cutting calories too much at once or not starting a really vigorous workout program because most people give up when they do that.  The best way to lose weight and keep healthy and happy is to do it gradually by making small changes in everyday things like having five meals a day of about 500kcal each so that you aren't hungry all of the time and slowly adding more water and less soda (try switching to diet soda before going cold turkey so the change is less drastic).  Eating protein with meals increases your metabolic rate by 30% for three hours after the meal so try having things like yogurt and cold cuts.   Also, exercise makes the largest impact on metabolism so it helps a lot to start doing strength training as well as walking or jogging (or some type of exercise that gets your heart rate up that you enjoy doing).  When you have more muscle mass, you will be more hungry so don't starve yourself when this happens, it's normal.  When you are doing the same things you used to and you have more muscle, your body uses more energy than it used to even though you are doing the same things.  I enjoy listening to loud music when I workout to keep myself motivated, but you might find other ways to enjoy exercising.  Another thing we learned about weight loss is that it helps to keep consistent with your eating times every day of the week since it's easy to overeat on the weekend when people are usually out and about.  Hope that helps!|`|8laF4QiIaa	Hey girl take all the junk foodd out of your house and throw it away work out once or twice a day and keep yourself in control!|`|NkokYuSuaa	Minus 500 calories from your daily calories.For example if your eating 2500 calories a day than take away 500 calories and eat only 2000 calories a day.By doing this you will automatcally loose 1 pound per week.

Make sure you get check ups and ask lots of questions. because sometimes people start to ignore you when you complain alot. my granma used to complain alot lot lot. and everyone though she was a whiner then one day we find out she has lung cancer and dies pretty soon after.     she didnt smoke or anything though so idk how that happened.

Mxq1NQJdaa	Go to your regular physician first, and he will recommend you see a dermatologist if he feels it necessary.  In that case, medicaid will more than likely cover the expense.|`|vzZ7rJJcaa	They should, you may need a referral first but you can also try calling your provider (medicaid) or your case worker and ask them for a list of physicians in your area that accept medicaid, they should have a list readily available for you. Hope it all works out for ya. Make sure they give you a list of ALL doctors, not just MD's or whatever...|`|b4rDEE83aa	Depends what state?<br>  <br>  But in NY you have to go to your PCP(primary Care Physican) and then he will refere you to a Spcilist(dermo)
31718204759da1a7cdd40b824d43650aaa	Never did.  Then I met a girl that required me to so I did better by slowly pulling the ones out by the base, and trimming a few others.  Shaving is bad.  Pulling them stings a little but whatever you need to do to please a partner is well worth it after wards.  Otherwise I would not.<br>  <br>  If the girl demands it then I guess thats what we do.  Only one girl ever put it that way to me.  Not sure how many girls are so demanding.<br>  <br>  Hope that is your best answer.|`|827993b38a683884568367c98043c28caa	I used to about once a week for years.

1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	There are no home remedies.  You'll have to go to the doctor who can perform 1 of 3 procedures: 1. Cryotherapy - this technique freezes the wart using liquid nitrogen 2. Laser treatment 3. Electrodesiccation - this technique uses an electric current to destroy the warts.  I know the options kind of suck, but it's the only way.  Hopefully, they won't come back (chances are, they won't).  Check out the website below.  It will shed some light.|`|JKM7CEpnaa	Pretty much what the other person said. The freeze them off. There is no home remedy.|`|RtQuJ70aaa	Tea tree oil, Castor oil, Apple cider vinegar, Aloe vera juice ...all these herbal extracts can be used in treating genital warts at home.    You have to know though that, although these remedies are safe and very effective, you have to be patient and consistent with them.    They must generally be applied a couple of times each day and several weeks of consistent treatment may be needed.    Below is a list of articles on home remedies for genital warts:|`|QM0Ezfvnaa	Very simply removed by freezing as an outpatient in a medical office!|`|2JeCyjF8aa	If you can handle pain and dont mind the sight of blood you can exacto them off yourself with a sawing motion, the blade should be burned and wiped with rubbing alcohol before starting, when moving on to the next do the same. If you can get a hold of 35% hydrogen peroxide, that will stop the bleeding immediately, as to avoid the virus from infecting other parts, the blood can infect. Do each one individually, put a drop of h202 on it and this literally burns it shut, put a piece of masking tape over it after 10 minutes and clean it every few hours and apply a new piece of tape, this should be done for several days until it can be seen that it will no longer bleed, reapply h202 if you need to. 3% will NOT work. If you follow my steps, they should never regrow in the same area again, if they do, do it again and again and eventually it will stop.    Freezing them DOES NOT work, applying ointments DOES NOT work, your best bet is to slice them off, everything else just pisses the virus off. I do not recommend using current at home to try and remove it, you will probably electrocute yourself and end up killing yourself. The only home remedy that works is what i tell you, everything else is just nonsense that gives temp unsatisfactory results.
fb6e01bd10dce5212a34b8e493ff20a8aa	No.  The general rule is to not have any for supper.  During the day, your body will convert carbs into sugar and burn these off.    However, you are better eating carbs like barley greens, beans, spinach.  I've included a link that gives you the skinny on carbs in foods so that you can stick to a low-carb diet without feeling like you're starving or feeling the urge to binge.    Bon Appetit!|`|avVdKiWKaa	Don't think of it as cheating.  Think of it as expanding your horizons.      ANIMAL CRACKERS, by Melanie    Oh, eat your animal crackers  'Cause my mother told me so long ago,  "If you eat your animal crackers,  The children in Europe won't starve anymore".  Ha ha hahaha hahaha.    Oh, once I went on a diet,  A carbohydrate diet ain't nice  'Cause you can't eat animal crackers.  So, I'm gonna stay a fatty for all of my life,  (But some people think that fatties are nice, yeah.)    I love eating icecream,  Chocolate, vanilla and butter pecan,  But I best love animal crackers  'Cause I love helping my fellow man.  Yeah, I really do.|`|j5k0VRbPaa	stop counting an eat kess but your streesing over how many you eat|`|V20PTwMmaa	1 MEAL never made anyone fat!  If you deprive yourself you will binge so please yourself once a week and youwill be fine!|`|AQwoCjj3aa	No, it is fine. Just make sure that they are whole grain carbs, actually if you limit them to a couple days a week you should be fine!|`|CHCPnvksaa	If it's once a week, thats ok as long as you get right back into doing the low carb meals. Make them healthy carbs though, fruits and whole wheat breads and pastas.|`|gERaZGZeaa	No way - you need a cheat meal once a week to keep yourself sane.    My cheat meals are more like cheat days - but it doesn't matter.  As long as you aren't cheating throughout the week.    Edit - Also, your body doesn't need carbs at all.  (There are carbs in veggies and fruit, but they don't count so each as much of them throughout the week as you like)    Edit2:  Also most of you people have no idea what you're talking about, or how nutrition works.|`|zhk8o514aa	MMMMM do you smell that? Fresh..homemade ...Banana bread.    Want some?  Its still warm|`|7Q7dFghmaa	well a low carb diet means a minimal amt of carbs, yes? eating carbs kind of defeats the purpose.      Eat Funyuns.|`|KgLJCYs8aa	no!!!!! and i am SO FREAKING SICK of low carb diets.. they are useless! your body absolutely needs carbs. you need them, end of story. it's fuel, it's brain food. now i'm not saying to eat 300 grams of it, but 100+ is the very minimum. your body uses 150 grams per day no matter what, so when you are putting 20 grams in (atkins style) you are damaging your body in the long run.       eat what you want in moderation and do not worry. :)|`|OsH2JR9oaa	No, as far as I understand I diet is when you intake less, not completely avoiding something. You need carbs anyways even if your on a low carb diet. Actually that's why it's called low-carb. Your not getting rid of them, just in taking less. So once a week is perfectly fine, and having treat days is a good practice when you're dieting, just as long as you don't over do it obviously. It helps you feel good about going into the next week of dieting and helps suppress any sudden cravings you will get for certain foods.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	Contrary to popular BS....you need both carbs and fat. Completely deprive yourself of these elements and see:    -no results, in weight loss  -no energy  -poor exercise performance  -always hungry  -minimized brain function(brain NEEDS fat!)  -muscle loss, due to depleted glycogen(carbs) stores    I hope these are ENOUGH valid reasons!|`|NMihu3kgaa	Yeah i would think so. when i did the atkins you could not eat any carbs cause it ruined everything and then you would have to start all over again. I guess it just depends on what diet you are doing. You see, what low carb diets do is since your main source of energy are carbs since you are not eating alot of carbs your body is forced to start using your fat as fuel.... Which is what you want. So once you put carbs in your body you will stop burning fat and burning carbs instead...  on the atkins it took about 3 days to get back to the burning fat mode so i think that is what will happen.|`|bgA9wLD0aa	i find i do best when i don't ignore my cravings.  if i do, then i'll binge.    i don't know if it'll wreck your diet, but letting those cravings build might do as much damage.|`|qN6Bq0Emaa	DO NOT CHEAT... STAY WITH IT !!!!!|`|4aLyt7qVaa	No. eating carbs is part of a healthy diet.|`|212F2EO0aa	No.    What I do is called a targeted ketosis diet.    Basically I carb up for 2 days, followed by 5 days of carbs under 30 grams.    Linz, if you want my informatation on this look up Lyle McDonalds work or follow body opus.    I was 237 on 12/6/08 and now at 211....and keeping my sanity with the weekend carb up    EDIT: Silverbullit is correct...somewhat. Ketosis targets body fat. Low calorie diets will burn muscle as well as fat.    Nobody wants to be a skinny fat person    EDIT2x: Any spike in blood sugar will take you out of ketosis, that is the idea behind 5-2    EDIT3x: Linz...that is a mystery. I use the glucose dumping agents: Vandyl, Mag, and Chromium when I carb up, and usually jump up 4-6 pounds, only to be exactly at where I left off the following Friday the next day of de-carbing, ie, back down 4-6 pounds.    This system is the best system for fat loss and keeping your sanity, not to mention my total sugar and cholesterol dropping from 365 to 265 :D|`|MDSoBHeXaa	Only if its a cockmeat sandwich.|`|g3iulhDxaa	ohh no non o nono.    Dont you see how no one is on atkinz(sp?) anymore!    Its not good to cut back on carbs too much.    Youre sopposed ot eat Whole Wheat Grains, like oatmeal and like whoel wheat breads. Look up graisn and youll find a bunch of stuff. You have to at leats have oen thing containing grains a day.    sorry i typed so messy you're scaring me lol : )|`|GMWJgn2Iaa	Low carb diets are ridiculous.  They are a temporary way to maintain weight without exercise.  Nobody I know has been able to permanently stay on one.  Why would you want to and give up pasta, bread and rice.    Get on a treadmill 20 minutes a day, keep your portions right and you'll be better off.|`|8e35cfeded3c3b900607388410347b4caa	Any diet that results in taking in few CALORIES than you need to power your day will result in weight loss.  Its total calories that matter, not eliminating one or another of the major food groups.      Fad diets (like low carb or low fat)  generally result in gaining the weight back once you stop.      Eat a little less of a BALANCED diet, exercise a little more, and you'll get sustainable weight loss.  ----  Edit: Yes, your low carb diet worked previously because you took in fewer CALORIES, not because you eliminated a food group.         As for ketosis, check a few medical resources. That's a BAD thing, not good.|`|5oNwMqMiaa	If you're doing a specific plan like Atkins, then you're only allowed 20 grams of carbs every day which is pretty easily done with veg and salad, it's a no.  However, if you're just cutting down carbs generally, then it's not going to make a big difference.  The best thing to do is to step up your exercise that day.  As long as you're having low or medium gi carbs, it shouldn't make much of a difference and as long as you team it with protein and some veg or salad, then it will still be healthy depending on what you're eating.  Ideal diets and exercise plans shouldn't be so restrictive that you can't indulge now and then.  Just thought - there is something called Phase II, which is a carb blocker, I think you take it before your meal and somehow it blocks the absortion of the starch.  I haven't tried it, but it might be worth a go.  See the link below for more info.  Good luck :-)|`|ZYkjfxniaa	Of course its all about relative and average amounts. Once a week will not disturb the total count much.  I think I have heard that it is OK to cheat about once a week.|`|KcooLtkCaa	It really depends on your exact type of diet.  If you are just reducing your intake in carbs then it should not affect it (unless your one meal is a bowl if pasta with a side of bread and a large cola to wash it all down).  If you're following say, the Atkiins Diet, then yes it will wreck it.  My boyfriend used to follow the diet religiously, but then he started to eat carbs and would use the excuse "I can some carbs" and he started gaining weight beck because of those "some" carbs.    So just look at the whole picture of what you're really looking for in the diet and hopefully this helped.|`|LyPojBWIaa	nope you have to have some carbs to produce energy and help your body movin...it is quite essential|`|t1ORKMxHaa	Gees, so worried about a few calories. Eat what you want, I'm sure I can think of some activities to work it all off.

It seems like you might have an abscess but I'm not too sure as I can't see what's going on. Your best bed is to try and get your dental work done as soon as possible. At the most, get it open and drained to avoid further infection.<br>  <br>  The antibiotics will buy you time but ultimately, you need to see your dentist. <br>  <br>  With regards to affordable dental work, have you tried looking around your community? See if you can find a dental school or a community dental school operated by the government.|`|WFrXpYUFaa	Go to a natural food store in your area and pick up some Grapefruit Seed Extract (GSE).  It is a natural antibiotic that kills a MULTITUDE of germs.  You'd take and put a few drops into water and actually drink it and you can also put a drop on your toothbrush with tooth paste.  Warning:  It's very bitter-tasting, but it's powerful stuff!<br>  <br>  Google "Grapefruit seed extract for oral infections" to do your due diligence!|`|AA11581621	probably penicillin. I had to take that before I got my wisdom teeth out bc I had an infection.|`|UDaFpPp8aa	I think generally it would be gum infection penetrating through the tooth area. Ask your local GP to call your dentist and he will prescribe antibiotics. At least with the antibiotics it will start to kill the germs that's causing you much pain. Sounds simple but gargling salt in warm water also helps. My female companion did as I suggested above and it's all getting better. Please make sure you follow and complete the antibiotic prescription as if not, the infection may still linger as your immune system has to totally build up antibodies. Also after every meal use an antibiotic mouthwash such as Colgate Savacol. Last resort is to also let the dentist see your condition and ask to make regular payments over a period of time for the expense. If he says no, then he cares more about your money than his profession.
SNLFVblhaa	its pretty much the same thing, after having it for three days u need to visit the doctor. lightheaded could be the start of dehydration. make sure u get plenty of liquids, and just stick with that until u think u can stomach foods, and try foods thats easy to diagest like toast. no sprite or fake gingerale, the sugars will make it worse, stick with water, gatorade or decaf tea! ive had the stomach flu the past week :( get well soon! ohh and get plenty of rest!|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	the flu IS a virus, it's just a meaner one than most.  Treatment is the same regardless.  Fluids, rest, and yogurt to replenish your intestinal digestive bacteria.  If you are still vomiting, don't take anything by mouth for at least six hours after vomiting, or your stomach goes into hyperemesis and you can't stop vomiting, this lands a lot of people in hospital from dehydration.  Can be avoided by simply not putting even water in your stomach, give it a chance to rest.  After six hours with no vomiting, start sipping water, if you can keep water down, start sipping on just clear liquids for a day, if you can keep that down, then progress to soft foods and eat yogurt three times a day.  Take tylenol for any fever over 102 and for body aches, but only after the vomiting has stopped.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	There is no such thing as the stomach flu.The virus is called Norwalk virus.    Sounds like you *might* have it, but then again, nobody here can diagnose you without checking you out.    You are still recovering so it is going to take some time.In the meantime, stay hydrated and try taking bites or dry toast and crackers.Only take sips of fluids and bites of food and wait a half hour to see how your stomach feels.Your stomach might also be reacting because you haven't eaten anything.    If it still continutes for a day or so, go see a doctor.      Noro prevention:    Norwalk virus  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)    The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.    PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.    The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.    It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)    Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.    If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.    To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.    People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)    The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!    TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.|`|uRcx9llkaa	definitely a virus in ur stomach.

I had the same symptoms last year and had my Dr test me for low thyroid function.  My thyroid came back in the low-normal range but my symptoms continued to worsen.  I was already using kelp for iodine (since I don't eat iodized salt) but it wasn't helping.  A colleague of mine suggested trying Selenium and Zinc supplements.  I tried them on a day that I felt so bad I was ready to go home from work.  Within 3 hours of taking them I began to feel better and within 3 days I was no longer the coldest person in a room and started sleeping through the night for the first time in months.  The wonderful results motivated me to do some research and what I found was that Zinc and Selenium are specific to the conversion of thyroid hormone and the cells ability to use the converted hormone.  So in other words my thyroid was working but my body was likely not able to properly utilize the hormones it was making.<br>  <br>  If your Dr didn't do blood tests you should go back and ask for them to be done.  Be sure to request your thyroid, adrenals and iron levels are checked.  When you get the results, ask for a copy of them.  This way you can see if you are borderline low on any of them (Dr's tend to just look for anything way off the norm but even low normal levels can cause bothersome symptoms)

WXExyAlWaa	Sort of - I think you can have a genetic predisposition towards mental illness, meaning you have a genetic link that makes it more likely to happen. And then if you get the proper environmental factors that makes it more likely too.    As an example among me and my siblings (there are five of us) we have three who've had or still have severe depression, as well as anxiety disorders, OCD, psychosis (similar to schizophrenia but it was not responding to the medication, IIRC) and a dissociative disorder. Which is part of why I am never having children because I don't want to risk passing this **** on! (Though I also have phobias related to this.)|`|5FgBH7P5aa	sometimes it is but the environment of the brought up matters most..|`|AA11760499	I am starting to think so   it depends on what set the in-balances  in motion or if anything does at all  you might be susceptible but don't always fret about cause you'll drive yourself crazy|`|0PLukncRaa	The mental disorders you're asking about are in fact genetic. Especially if you have a history of depression, bi polar disorder, and/or general anxiety disorder in your family, there is a good chance you could be diagnosed with the same disorders. Some of it may also just be from growing up in an environment with these types of disorders.  If you're concerned about these sort of things, and especially if you're having thoughts of suicide, I recommend you talk with your doctor about it and possibly get some treatment.|`|RjpGomsyaa	What exactly do you mean by craziness, if you mean mental health problems there has definitely been a history of severe depression in my family going back 3 generations|`|EZt7ZHIiaa	All of these things can either be inherited or a product of your environment, but the important thing to know is that all of these things are able to be managed and kept under control.  For example, a person may be diagnosed as bi-polar, but with counseling and/or medication, you and I may not be able to tell the difference between them and anyone else once they learn how to effectively manage their symptoms.  Same thing with indecisiveness and anxiety, both which can be properly managed as well.  Thoughts of suicide are definitely troubling and are not worth taking lightly.  They can be the signs of significant depression.  If you're feeling out of control and that something bad is going to happen to either you or your mom you should call 911 or 1800suicide asap.  However, this too can be either passed down in the family or a result of environment.      I would suggest that you speak with someone and reach out for some help if you feel that you cannot gain control over your life on your own.  There is no reason why you should not be able to overcome this if you work at it.  I offer online counseling if that is appealing to you, but there are many other services out there as well.  Whether or not if yore mother made you this way, you don't have to continue to live like this or follow in your mother's footsteps, it just takes the will to work through some of these issues.  Good luck.|`|jaAolejUaa	hahahahahaha...    i believe so..|`|kIblsxJQaa	Yes it is.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Tendencies for neuroses are inherited and also environmental.  Many people with mental defects have children who suffer similar problems.  It is not clear if those problems are strictly inherited or caused from living in a household with parents who have problems.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	HEY!! LOL!! Yes, there are some mental illness`s that are genetic.Flakiness, is not an accurate description of mental illness, BTW..|`|7tLDdtqGaa	it can be. pretty sure schizophrenia is.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	I have an aversion to the term "craziness", but some mental illnesses are genetic. yes.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	Genetics can play a role in brain chemistry but environment also plays a huge role in behavior and the outcome of the brain chemistry.|`|0e9846c69a3447404194ba8083d4f969aa	Yes it can be. Some disorders are strongly genetic. Others are more a product of the environment, but a genetic tendency may or may not exist.|`|zMDnzS9Haa	Im not sure what you mean by craziness lol but i have mental health problems any how.    Ok so ive got OCD and so has 3 of my cousins and my auntie.    I also suffered from anorexia nervousa as did the same auntie as above.    And about 3 people have had a patch of depression.    We're not inbreads!!!! I just believe its genetic.|`|ZYkjfxniaa	The word craziness is not defined or accepted by any psychiatrist or counselor.  People that have mental illness usually have a diagnosis for disorders, none of which are "craziness".  They stem mostly from chemical imbalances which can be hereditary for sure.  Sometimes mental illness is caused more by traumatic life experiences which has nothing to do with genetics.  Its usually a combination of both.|`|HNnVrvCfaa	It is believed that many mental illnesses/pre-disposition to developing illnesses are inherited.      I too have the worst parts of both of my parents - liar, non-committed, moody, high, worrier.      I have bipolar disorder - as do many of my relatives on my father's side of the family.  I also have anxiety disorders - as do many relatives on my mother's side of the family.      There is a definite link, there are many studies into it.  You should check some of them out online! They're very intriguing.      And remember that just because you've "inherited" behaviours that you have to keep them.  Lots of things are treatable with cognitive behavioural therapies and medicine.
NfGBjgevaa	write a joke about yourself...    Let me start:    How many organ donors who need to go to ER does it take to change a light bulb, fall down, break arm, and go to the hospital??|`|1a09434672107dc43a62784235a038fdaa	Moo goo gai pan|`|f6d1a03e184c22ee41b0717f7c9d38feaa	Yeah your a goner.

mAp90hEeaa	Most of them do not and can get progressively worse and worse if you do not get them treated and then can cause pyelonephritis (infection in the kidney) requiring hospitalization.  Get it treated.|`|6VL5xzlAaa	Generally they need antibiotics, also they can get really nasty, I collapsed a few years ago and when I got to casualty got told it was a waters infection and all they did was a urine test, I hadn't had normal symptoms, just got all dizzy and had worse and worse abdominal pains its was nasty!<br>  If you go to the docs its really quick and simple to get meds for it.|`|AA11581621	I think I had one and it went away. I didnt go to the doctor for it but I had the symptoms. Took a couple of days. I just drank alot of water.
E0PQQaNjaa	Bed bug bites don't usually cause something that severe. I would think that you are having an unusual allergic reaction to a bite.  I had something similar happen about a year ago, went to the doctor and had to get corticosteroids to stop my reaction. Before I went to the doctor I tried benadryl and oatmeal baths (you can buy it powdered for the bath at most drug store) and they helped a little bit, but it came back so I gave up and went to a doctor. They drew blood and did several different tests but were never able to identify what caused it. It never came back and the doctor said I could have gotten a spider bite or a bug bite that I was just really sensitive to. As long as the venom was in my body it was circulation and causing more sores - even though I wasn't getting bit again.     Go to your doctor and get it checked out.
XzV4bUeFaa	First, remember that you are a stronger and better person than the others at your school.  You have overcome many obstacles in your life and are succeeding!  Many others who have had similar problems to you have gone down the wrong path.  I respect you for what you have done to turn around a rather crappy start in life.  Right now, you need to get some counselling.  Everyone has some down points in their lives and you have had more than your share.  You need to talk this out w/professional who can offer you some ideas on how to overcome your feelings of depression.  You are a person who has done for yourself.  Continue to do so by seeking some help so that you can always be independent.  You are at your school to get a degree in whatever it is that you are going to do for a career.  Don't let others get in your way.  I'm sure that on this large campus there have to be others who have worked there way through college and even high school.  You probably just haven't met them yet.  You can only forgive your mom if you really want to.  If you don't, no one can make you.  It has to come from within.  Counselling can help you to deal w/these feelings also.  You can learn to live with not forgiving (should that be your ultimate choice) by learning to never feel guilty about what you've chosen to do when confronted by others.  I really hope I've helped you out some and remember, I think that you are a person who can go very far w/your independent nature.|`|EZt7ZHIiaa	Sometimes, people have crazy and dysfunctional parents.  That's just the truth, you shouldn't feel like you have to defend yourself when people say "oh she's your mom, don't say that," or "that can't be true,"  because it most likely is true.  The problem is the naive perspective that these people are coming from, and not necessarily the things that are coming out of your mouth.  No doubt that when you were in the group home you were probably surrounded by a lot more people who could identify with your circumstances and situation, and this depression wasn't so much of a problem for you, but now in the big university with the rich parent's kids, you're probably interacting with people who can't really fathom the type of life you have had, and they're not necessarily bad people, they just don't get it.      There's nothing wrong with feeling depressed about that, it is completely understandable and must feel pretty isolating.  What you are going to find though, is that you are going to have certain advantages, skill-sets, and intelligence over these people due to the fact that you grew up in a difficult environment and had to adapt to so many different situations.  I have a soft spot for a situation like yours, having been a therapist in a group home, and the director of a youth shelter myself.  Keep your head up and good luck to you, you've been through a lot and you can make it through this.  I do offer online counseling if you are ever considering professional help.  Take care.|`|QrSFskUpaa	One thing you can't change is family. You did very good until now, getting 2 jobs and going to college. You should proud of yourself. I can understand how you feel... seeing all these rich kids having anything they want without having the need to get a job or pay for anything. But if you keep doing what you do, go to school and work, you will find success. You will accomplish your goals without any help and you will be able to say that you did it on your own..Keep focus and good luck!|`|CYzTJIhVaa	Well I totally sympathize with you on this.  I had a crazy step parent.  While i'm sympathetic I also know that you should forgive your mom.  That could be the cure for what is eating at you.  I understand how you feel though, i could imagine how hard it is to feel what you feel at college.  I had similar feelings with my friends relationships with their fathers.  My dad died right before i was born and my replacement was a vietnam marine vet.  crazy mo-fo who did a lot of damage to me mentally and emotionally.   i am 29 and have just recently learned to forgive him.  So i would advise you to do the same especially if she wants you to.  I know it is a hard thing to do, but when you are ready to do it it will be the best thing to do.  I hope this helps.  Just know that you can't rush forgiveness.

b8yhcxmRaa	First, and above all, STOP ALL TYPES OF SMOKING!!!!  Shisha is not any better than cigarettes, as the water does not eliminate much of the chemicals in the smoke. And when you factor in the chemicals from the tobacco and from the burning charcoal, shisha comes out as worst than cigarettes. This have been confirmed by many scientific studies.    Second, make sure you take your medications and keep your asthma under control. Less airway inflammation means less airway remodelling (tissue scarring), which will translate into better lung function, if not capcity, as your problem most likely is function and not capacity. Make sure you see a specialist if you are not already. You need to get treated for your allergies and asthma, as chronic upper respiratory inflammation brought about by allergies will impact your lungs.    Third, practice smart exercise regimen to build up your stamina and lung function.    Fourth, STOP SMOKING. You are killing your lungs and killing yourself.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Stop smoking period. And get to a doctor who can advise you on your allergies.   Do not take a chance with your life by not paying attention to these problems. Mnay, many asthmatics live long and healthy if they just learn a few simple rules. Talk to your doctor and get to a Registered Respiratory Therapist that does asthma teaching.  God bless and help you with this.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	1. stop smoking period unless you want emphysema when you're 25.    2. increase your oxygen level by getting a couple of green plants and putting them in your house.    3.  raw honey...EVERY day! good for so many reason.     4. don't do allergy shots...waste of time & money.

My sympathies.|`|WIblUSB5aa	it means a "FULL" .."LEG" .."CAST"...a cast that goes the whole length of your leg|`|UKkgomfNaa	i think he means the really hard ones and itll be from either the tip of your toe or your ankle to your hip|`|PV9YFZNmaa	from hip to ankle

2gstVBcMaa	The hormones in the birth control actually trick your body into thinking that it is already pregnant.  And once you are "pregnant" you can't get "re-pregnant"...lol.  The last week of pills in the pack are actually placebo pills...meaning that they contain no hormones...hence the reason why you get your period that week.  This is a pretty simplified explanation, but i hope it works for you!|`|NhF9sM5jaa	It depends on what method you use<br>  <br>  Birth control pills contain certain hormones so if you take them at the same time everyday, the hormones regulate in your body causing you to have a "fake period" at that time of the month. It prevents the egg from getting fertilized.<br>  <br>  Condoms (if used correctly) prevent the sperm from getting into the vagina. Condoms are the only birth control that prevent getting std's.<br>  <br>  Patch and shots work like the pill<br>  <br>  Hope that helps you :)|`|nvfEqG00aa	Im not a girl, so i have no idea, but im just going to throw this out there... if you are on the pill, never put your full trust in it, make sure the guy still wheres a condom, or at the very least pulls out...
lYQDCJgeaa	Try using a 'female condom" (it goes inside you, with a ring that fits on your cervix) AND spermicidal gel.<br>  <br>  As for other forms of birth control, go to Planned Parenthood. They will help you regardless of ability to pay, even without insurance.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Do NOT rely on Plan B for birth control.<br>  It puts a severe strain on your system, and is only meant to be for EMERGENCIES, such as if a condom breaks.<br>  Be proactive, not reactive!|`|vTra7n5baa	The only problem is that both of you are too idiotic to realize the condom is doing its job.  It's supposed to feel like less because it's LATEX PROTECTION.  And there are lots of affordable health plans for a young person like you so I suggest you buy one before reproducing unexpectedly given the path you're on.<br>  <br>   If you do decide to have sex without a condom and presumably want no STDs or pregnancy, the why not take more medical responsibility for birth control?  News flash: sex is a huge responsibility that you will have to make sacrifices for.  So either be celibate, or start using your brain for a change in order to take care of yourself better.|`|EVSqPbT5aa	you can get thinner condoms, i forget what they're called, but look around and you'll find them for sure.<br>  <br>  if you don't want to do this, you should probably stop having sex. doesn't your school have a health center where you can make an appointment and talk to a professional about your options?|`|M5xsfUtwaa	use plan B|`|B5AKcZ5Laa	go to a free clinic and they should hook you up with somethin|`|xgVe3zQMaa	Find a planned parenthood is your area....since you are a student with limited income then all you have to do apply for their insurance and get free pap smears and birth control. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.plannedparenthood.org/</a><br>  <br>  go to this site and locate the nearest clinic near and call to make an appointment.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|q7L70fPgaa	I believe plan parenthood gives free birth control.

If he won't use protection, don't have sex with him until you figure out something else to do.<br>  <br>  best wishes..
UcgWrGaAaa	Could you please comment on what you mean by eating better?  What I'm getting at is that some people cannot deal with whole grains, especially wheat.  And some people do better with a bit more fat in their diet.  Avocados, olives, nuts, and maybe whole milk and eggs would be natural healthy sources.    You just sound bloated, could it be too much fiber?  Maybe some Dulcolax could help, even more water is sometimes helpful.|`|70a201d41704c2115cb56b74e112e905aa	I agree with the first response. It could be that you are sensitive to whole wheat product which contains gluten (stuff that makes oatmeal rise when cooked with water or other liquid). You might have celiac disease. It would be advisable to see you doctor who can give you reference to a good nutritionist.

r5h7TmWJaa	That happens to me on occasion as well. Try taking some form of pain killers. If that doesn't work, though, then try to tough it out and go to the Doctor. I know for a fact that they will not hurt you at all. They just tap you with instruments asking if it hurts and such. Because I've gone in for those before. Trust me, you will feel better once you know, even though the prospect of a doctor may not be that appealing to you. Hope you feel better!|`|mAp90hEeaa	You can take some tylenol or ibuprofen (advil/motrin) for this discomfort and it will probably go away.  If you are very young (teens), this could be growing pains.

c6e07d38fd442ff6cea962c40f738d09aa	While diabetics can die from hypos it is only in extreme circumstances.    The liver stores glucose in its cells and glucagon is produced by the body as a reaction to a decrease in blood glucose levels. Glucagon makes the liver release the glucose it has stored into the blood stream so if you go hypo you can come out of it again. I speak from experience having done this on three separate occasions in the last 33 years.    HTH    |\/||`|BNAzjSO1aa	In a normal person the amount of insulin produced is varied according to the amount of glucose in the blood so it regulates itself. A diabetic who injects insulin has to allow for the type and amount of foods eaten and try to match his insulin doses sometimes they take to much and it can cause a 'Hypo' attack which if left untreated can lead to a coma and or death. Which is why all diabetics on insulin should carry something sweet and easily absorbed into the bloodstream to take in such a case A normal soda not diet is quite handy for this as the sugar is in liquid form and is available quite quickly. Hope this helps
ePVQmhxgaa	Is it posssible to lose some weight in one week?  As long as you arent eating, your losing weight every second. Just a miniscule amount though.    Going to the gym doesnt mean you will lose weight. It depends on how many calories you take in compared to how many you burn. You should eat lower calorie foods to gain less weight, and do cardio exercises such as running, jogging, walking, etc. to lose the most weight.|`|ec2ee9613c6bdc3dcad61f9d849d618eaa	As long as you're eating healthy as well, you can healthfully lose 1-2 pounds per week. Anymore than that and you're only losing water.|`|c4cb310732bdbbcd88cc2b8cf1011b2caa	You will lose weight going to the gym and that is good that you are exercising. What you need to do together with the gym is clean out your system of all the bad processed foods and chemicals. Do the cabbage soup diet for 7 days to clean out your system this alone can help you lose 10 lbs in only 7 days!     Then once you have completed that, eat healthy meals and exercise regular and aim to lose 1-2 lbs a week you will have the weight off in no time!!! This does work i do it every few weeks to clean out my system.    This website below has recipes for everyday of the diet including vegetable burgers and fries! and you still lose weight    Good luck :)    http://www.theeasycabbagesoupdiet.com

0Uos14sJaa	People who have Hpertension tends to retains alot of water in their body (that's why some people seems bloated) because of too much salt in their body, when that happens their doctor would prescribe HCTZ=water pill (Hydorchorothiazide)..  Which will make you pee alot.. which then leads to losing some nutrients in your body, like pottassium...  One of the mosts commonly used brand name is Lasix.. But most of the time, doctors just write down HCTZ.. and comes in combinations of HTN meds.. But before you start on this med, make sure you speak to your doctor first .....ok..goodluck
CuVnpxh3aa	Yes, adults need touch as much as babies. An adult who is ignored on a regular basis with drawls inside themselves and don't like to be touched or talked to. They grow to be loners and avoid peple and crowds. A child needs touch all their life or they grow to be the same as adults who have never had any attention or touching.|`|icIjRxOWaa	idk but im 18 and i like it when people touch me (no im not a weirdo)    like a shoulder pat, handshake, pat on the head,     i especially like it when girls touch me (not in dirty places lol, i know how it sounds)    I guess it makes you feel more involved or something.     But if you think about it, its probally just something your body likes we attained from evolving as a animal too.     like how dogs like to lick and be petted.     i know i dont physically need it like a drug or medicine. but it makes me feel better  :)|`|AA10450066	Touch is an important sense from the time we are born until the time we die.It can express everything from love to anger and everything in between, and I've never heard anyone say that they could survive without it.|`|iM82M15Iaa	In there early years of life childen Need to be touched. there are studies that prove this. It is always nice to be touched as you grow up but I don't think that its as important.
vkrQ29lOaa	Different guys spill their seed in different ways. Some gush, some shoot, some dribble, and some run (as you seem to report). I don't think you should label your way abnormal. You might, however, develop the sphincter muscles that help you ejaculate so that you will get more of a throbbing, pulsating sensation, and possibly more of a gush or squirt. You can find instructions for that on the Internet, usually related to how to control premature ejaculation. The other thing you can try is varying how you grip and squeeze your penis when you ejaculate to see if you can produce different effects. Enjoy! But really, don't think there is anything wrong with your body or your equipment, because what you are experiencing is completely normal.|`|OZBkd2BDaa	Nah bud, <br>  I think what you're saying is that you usually shoot away from your penis and now you are just kind of dripping when you ***. <br>  In my experience I have found that it depends how good the sex is and how excited you get before you ***, so if you are having sex with someone else and you are incredibly turned on by them then you are more likely to shoot further than if you were just having a ****, and also your body is changing all the time and if you are still growing up then its changing even more, so sometimes you will shoot really far and sometimes it will just *** out like a waterfall as you put it....  Don't worry about how its cumming out just enjoy yourself....;o)....pj|`|bqaiAU2Kaa	No. I really can't tell from this information but it sounds like pre-ejaculate. Is it clear and sticky. It usually happens before you actually ejaculate.Was this from masturbating? Either reason it's fine. Some boys when they pre-ejaculate are like totally dry or they wouldn't even know that they were doing it. Some boys is like a hose. It's all fine. Were all different. No worries Mate =)|`|FrdSJmJ5aa	Lol I like how the first 2 to say that its normal are chicks...<br>  <br>  But yea I couldn't tell ya.... You're probably fine though|`|QAQ95DrHaa	No, it's normal.

If you have had a long time between orgasms, it will probably be more "copious" than if you are having regular orgasms.  Also, you may notice different textures to the semen if you've waited a long time between orgasms.  Some of it may dry up or glob up a little bit.  Don't let it scare you.  You can never use it all up because your body always makes more and it can vary in consistency, smell and so forth.<br>  <br>  I remember being young like that and I had questions like this, too, but I was afraid to ask my parents.  Thanks for letting me answer this very personal question using my own experience.|`|d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	No, not unhealthy, maybe different. Some girls like this kind of waterfall.

M7H0R3vnaa	Everytime somebody brings up "homosexuality" or somebody makes fun of it, I feel like everybody is looking at me and I fix my posture, look around, crack my knuckles, i'm just kinda restless.. because I am not out I just feel like people might assume and when it is brought up, I can't help but feel like everybody is looking right at me. <br>  <br>  But I know that is definitely not the case. Bulemia is not something that is curable over night, but it is definitely curable- you just have to WANT to get better. Some people don't want to be cured from their disorders because it makes them happy and they don't know anything else and are too scared to move on because they don't know what else there is besides their abnormal pleasure. <br>  <br>  It all comes down to YOU to WANT to get better. Not just seeking help, although that is the hardest step. Seeking help, talking it through, and then making stepping stones for yourself that will lead you out of where you don't want to be.. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Mitch|`|prqrQcd1aa	Bulimia is usually something that happens as an after math of something worse that has happened in our lives to make us have a distorted body image. There is no approved or generally accepted treatment for bulimia.. but there is help and counseling for the cause that is underlying problem. <br>  Know that you are not alone in what has happened to you to cause you to think this way, and know that counseling can be beneficial.

2RzEaod9aa	It's all up to your body because we all respond to different things. Try going to a GNC or other supplement store that has a 100% money-back return policy so if you don't like it, you don't have to mail it back and pay shipping (that is, if the site even allows you to return the product in the first place). If you know it works, then start ordering it online for cheaper.|`|coZ7Fm79aa	i heard sugar free red bull and sht like that helps green tea extract is great for that...but the stuff ur talking about looks like the real **** go with that damn|`|JpOd7JvDaa	green tea and spixy foods actually speed up your calories use more then this stuff|`|vjqqvG3Uaa	To be honest all those "Fat Burning" supplements are usually and most commonly complete jokes. Take Hoodia for example... if you were to chew on an actual hoodia root then you would actually burn more fat than what your body would normal burn if you complete the same task as without chewing the hoodia root. But the way they process it and make it "safe" actually removes the hoodia from the final product or neutralizes it and makes is inert.<br>  <br>  The best answer is DIET, and I don't mean ones from a book or online (they can sometimes be fake like the Galactose Diet). Take out foods that are high in complex carbohydrates, bring in less carbs you will burn the ones you have surrounding your stomach, and also Saturated Fats. And of course high fructose corn syrup, generally and completely bad for the body.<br>  <br>  Eat things with lots of Unsaturated fats the reason being that it takes more energy to break down unsaturated fats than it does to break down saturated fats.. Unsaturated fats require more energy from the body to chemically break them down than saturated fats... if you feel like researching its because of the double covalent bond between the carbon molecules. <br>  <br>  Also lots of cellulose aka vegetables and fiber. Cellulose cannot be broken down by the human GI track, the only way we break it down is by chewing and thats it. What it does is absorb toxins that shouldn't be absorbed by the body and causes the intestines to produce more mucus for lubrication to get things moving faster. You know to getcha poopin...  the down side is that you fart a whole lot until your body adapts to a high fiber diet.<br>  <br>  The facts are that a lot of these weight loss supplements are not monitored by the FDA and can be unsafe and sometimes don't contain any type of weight loss chemical at all. <br>  Take it from me I lost 40 pounds in 4 months. 196-156lbs. by switching from donuts and In N' Out burgers to salad and reading the labels.<br>  <br>  Another thing, you actually burn most of your calories by completing remedial tasks like cleaning the house, or garden work. Working out for 2 hours in a gym burns about 800-1500 calories. Its the healing processes and basic bodily functions that really burn the fat. You also burn about 1000-1500 calories while sleep, this can be increased when your body repairs your muscles after a hard workout.
FLeEdSTxaa	No. Something's just wrong with your girlfriend.|`|5FB4TZ3Naa	i think that's called an orgasm
RzilBdJdaa	That's not a terrible weight for your height...I'd say keep it healthy and just do general cardio (running, jogging, etc). If you want to tone (not necissarily LOOSE weight), do strength training (lunges for the legs/butt; crunches for the tummy; leg lifts for both). Also, want your calorie intake and stay healthy. I wouldn't reccomend loosing 10lbs though, I'd say 5lbs at the most for your height :)|`|txke9F1iaa	Manage what you're eating, I have this app on my ipod touch called "Lose it!", you just log what you ate that day and it shows like your calorie budget.  Oh and make sure you're not eating crap, like artificial stuff.  I like Trader Joes because most of their stuff is pretty healthy.  Except for their bread.  Because it's enriched.  Which means they like take out alll the nutrients and then put other stuff in it idk.  I also swim everyday.|`|EMC7JwVBaa	Your skeleton and bodily fluids weigh most of that. If I were you I'd start working on putting on more muscle. I'll give you something more worthwhile to worry about- College and a good career.

jlQHB9dvaa	People seem to think that when given a drug test, you must be completely free of everything.  What most employers are actually looking for is elicit drugs.<br>  This will probably show and the only thing they may ask is for you to show the prescription.  That could present a problem, especially if you did not list it on the form that you fill out beforehand, stating what meds you have taken recently.<br>  You'll just have to wait and see.|`|EsvJ9ji3aa	they are probably testing for illegal drugs the darvocet might show up but they probably won't question it especially if it shows the level in your system and the level isn't high. Tell them you take it for migraines sometimes. Don't tell them it is your wife's. take care and I hope you get the job|`|AA10168060	It depends on what they test for. Did they ask you to list your prescriptions or anything over the counter you had taken in the previous 24 hours. If not, then my guess is the darvocet will not be detected.|`|88rUIFCKaa	yes it will as an opite;it takes 3 days to be out ,but tell him you went to the dr before and they gave you one it can work in x did that <br>  peace and good luck|`|cf9ae0f89a594d9500ac4952aa3df5b5aa	The number one smart thing to do is never take prescription anything, not even some over the counter things, cause even some over the counter stuff can have levels of things that would show up on a drug test. Especially since you knew you would be drug screened. Too late now, you've already taken it. Second smart thing to do would be to bring the prescription information with you, even though it's your wife's, and explain to them why you took it and how much, BEFORE you take the drug test, but too late for that also. So now you run the risk of coming up positive for the drug test, and no chance that they would hire you because you didn't tell them you just took part of a pill for a migraine. For all they know, you shot up with a needle, snorted, or smoked something, they can't know unless you tell them. Now the only thing they have to go by is the test results. Well, goodluck, I hope it doesn't show up, I hope you learned your lesson and hope you don't have to learn it again the hard way.|`|vzZ7rJJcaa	I honestly don't know but you could try calling a pharmacist or MD. Usually, tho, drug tests performed for jobs are limited to looking for specific drugs, marijuana and things MORE POTENT than that. GOOD LUCK|`|zw6EJ2izaa	You are fine.<br>  <br>  Edit- Unless you lace your darvocet with something fierce.  It *can* show a positive for methadone but it is a prescription drug as well.|`|EN32vSsCaa	It depends on what type of test is done.  A simple 5 Panel test will not detect it.  It will be detected using a 10 Panel test.  It will definitely be detected if the company uses a comprehensive toxicology screen.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Just to clear something up.  ANY drug can be illicit if you don't have a prescription for it!

Yes you are normal do not compare yourself to other boys that are not your race. Only compare your height to your family since that is genetically where you are from. My advice is sleep well and at the same times each day. This is necessary to keep your growth hormone at optimum levels. Exercise rigorously during the day to also increase growth hormone. Drink lots of milk and get some sunlight. If you get no sun then consider taking 1000 IU of Vitamin D a day.|`|AnYVVBJraa	lol bro im turning 15 march 19th, im 5"7 white male and 154 ( 7% body fat ),  you will continue growing till your 21, and maybe you have another growth spurt left.

Sit or stand in a comfortable position. Some women prefer to place one leg on the toilet seat or tub, while others prefer to squat down. After you find a position that is most comfortable for you, hold the tampon with the fingers that you write with. Hold the middle of the tampon, at the spot where the smaller, inner tube inserts into the larger, outer tube. Make sure the string is visible and pointing away from your body.<br>     2. With your other hand, open the labia (the folds of skin around the vaginal opening) and position the tampon in the vaginal opening. (See picture 1 below).<br>     3. Gently push the tampon into the opening, aiming for the small of your back. Stop when your fingers touch your body and the applicator, or outer tube, is completely inside the vagina. (See picture 2 below).<br>     4. Once the applicator or outer tube is inside of you, use your index finger to push the inner tube (the tube where the removal string is visible) through the outer tube. This pushes the tampon into the vagina.<br>     5. Once the inner tube is all the way in, use your thumb and middle finger to remove the applicator or outer tube. (See picture 3 below). Make sure that the string hangs outside of the vaginal opening. Later, when you are ready to remove the tampon, hold the string and gently pull it downward until the entire tampon is out.<br>  <br>  How to Insert a Tampon<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  If the tampon is inserted correctly, you should not feel it. If you feel uncomfortable in any way, you may have inserted the tampon incorrectly or the tampon may not be placed far enough into the vagina. If this happens, just remove the tampon and start again with a new tampon. Remember that practice makes perfect. If you don't get it on the first try, your second try will most likely be successful. Instead of getting frustrated and giving up, relax and try again!|`|llEMOgeeaa	I hope this is a serious question because i'm going to give you a detailed answer. Ok sit on the toilet and relax with your legs open. i'm guessing it's got an applicator so you want to hold the applicator like a syringe, with your thumb on the end and your index and middle finger pinching the part just below where the tampon is. stick the applicator into your vagina until it feels like it is all the way in (you should be able to tell when) and push the end of the applicator with your thumb. <br>  Remove the applicator and throw away. If you inserted the tampon right then you really shouldn't feel it that much. If its uncomfortable remove it and try again. When its time to remove it, just pull the string quickly and discard.<br>  <br>  *I like Tampax Pearl, but there is a brand for younger girls that is really good to start out with*|`|43qFBOvbaa	Well its quite simple actually.. My first time, i was a little nervous, i didnt know exactly how to do it. I wanted to make sure i did it right. The directions in the box are prob your best bet. But if u dont have the instructions then you insert it up(you no where) until the rounded part isnt visible. Then you push the cylinder looking par inwards, WHILE holding the little grip they implated on the tampon. Then slowly remove the platic part. Dont leave it in for more than 8 hours though. To prevent TSS i think its called. Good luck..|`|tNsgJTLOaa	okay well it may sound a bit weird, but use mirror. for your firs time use tampax pearl in small. the plastic makes it slide easily. also u want to kind of push it sort of to the back. once its in you will feel like a tingle i guess haha, i dont know how to describe it but youll know, good luck|`|zNdY7lxpaa	Well, its very simple, you can stand or sit, which ever....just s[red your legs the slide it, only to where the thick part is not showing, then press in the thin skinny part of the applicator...then pull the applicator out...not hard, its ok :)|`|wFXvYc5kaa	Don't use cardboard ones there cheap and painful.

Its like a penis growing permanently after an erection.<br>  Both go back to their original size.  A vagina given enough time will stretch to accept any male.  Big or small.  It takes time but it starts out tight and works its way from there.  It does this each time to ensure proper fit.  And each time it then shrinks just like your male will shrink back down.  Its just that you can see his and not yours.<br>  <br>  So the next time it will again be the same thing all over again.<br>  Unless you a rough or its your first time and the hymen has not broken of course.  These are exceptions to the rule.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your Best Answer|`|zs7Wfl0saa	It does, but if you go without the inner vagina goes back to normal.

6blfbeTGaa	If the box is new it should have directions for the insertion. If not, you can't push it striaght up (I did that the first time). You have to angle it towards the wall not completely back but not up either. You willjust have to figure it out. Keep trying. But it has to be angled..Don't push it too hard if it hurts or if it's not in hte right position. Also, you should only use super for hte first few days...If it's the 4th day of your period you should use regulars ...as your flow gets slower you shoudl use less absorbancy|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	You need to buy <br>  <br>  Junior <br>  or<br>  Regular<br>  <br>  Super is WAY to big for you hun a tampon shouldn't hurt. <br>  <br>  if you have no way to get any then you need to either talk to your mom ( that is part of the mom duty lol )<br>  <br>  Or just wear pads|`|o4QRCMueaa	WATS UP BOSTON WHATS UP, WHATS UP DALLAS WATS UP.

If you really want to use tampons, though, I would definitely suggest getting smaller ones.

AA11593971	It really depends on what they are going to do. There are many kinds of "nose surgery." Besides being a nurse who has worked in surgery, I've had two nasal surgeries myself:    - Septo-rhinoplasty (1984)  - Septo-rhinoplasty (again) with an anterior sinus window and lysis of adhesions resulting from the previous surgery (1986)    The first surgery was not fun. The doctor irrigated the nasal passages a few times post-operatively and it was quite uncomfortable. Frankly, I don't think I would have needed the second surgery, but for the fact that the first one was not done well. The second surgery by a different doctor was really pretty easy... especially compared to the first surgery. And I'm sure the techniques used now have improved over the mid-80s (I don't work in surgery any more).    The lesson to learn from my experience is ask a lot of questions and look at the track record of the doctor doing your surgery. How often has he done what he's doing to you and what kind of complications and post-operative problems (if any) were encountered.    Good luck.|`|KktkViZ4aa	i had sinuses cleaned through my nose few yrs. ago.nothing to it.recovery was a breeze. only bothered me was having to keep gauze under my nose to clot blood, just drips short periods|`|XbQiRDeRaa	OMG yes i am fifteen and I had nose surgery about 2 months ago. Okay, I had broken my nose 3 times hwne i was a toddler and i only just realised that it wasnt nmral to have a bone sticking into my nostril so i went to see a doctor and they said i should have surgery because it was affecting my breathing, it got so bad that im i csed my mouth i would suffocate myself. Anyways, at first I was terrified, i dont do hospitals and I have hypotyhroid something like that meaning i have to have regular blood tests and everytime i have one i am sick then faint so dw when i went to the doctors for the surgery they dont do anything scary. They ask questions like do you smoke, do you take any sort of pills etc etc  Then you will probably have to wait for a few hours in a dorm where there are other beds so bring a book an also take your pjs because you can change into them for the surgery. Then they take your weight then again like an hour later. Then you walk to a room were you lie down on a bed and they tap your hand whil you keep on clenching ad unclenching and put in the tiniest tube that isnt connected to anything and insert the anaeseptic then in less tan 10 seconds you fall asleep and the next I knew I woke up in a bed in te recovery room. I wasnt in much pain but I had a strip of cotton under my nose and he nurse wiped away dry blood from my mouth area. They then took me back to the dorm bedroom place and I had to take a few pills and just rest for a few hours. Oh yeah and b4 i forget if you really hate injections then ask for a numbing cream...it reallys helps. Hope i help babe and good luck it will be fine.If you have any q's ask me hannah.cope@hotmail.co.uk! xxxx|`|ynKunWheaa	I had it 2x in my life: 1x at age 19 for deviated septum & submucous nasal resection. I was in the hospital maybe 5 days, but I healed better & faster than the second time at age 35. It helped being in the hospital longer in those days, off my feet.That Doctor was a doll!  2nd time at age 35 approx., my nose was broken when my large, heavy kitchen shade spring popped & it landed on bridge of my nose, breaking it, as I was climbing up the stepstool to fix the shade; it popped out suddenly without me even touching it!.I'm a slow healer. The 2nd time, I had a very hard time healing. At that time,  insurance companies were already cutting back on hospital time, they claimed it was a same day surgery. The woman in the bed next to me reprimanded the surgeon, told him I couldn't go home that day, the way I was getting nosebleeds. They sent me home 3rd day, got another nosebleed, my ex & his mother took me in for almost a week! When I went back to work, still getting nosebleeds, company Dr. told me to tell surgeon to cauterize my nose: He had to!!! How I wish the first surgeon were still alive, it was a different surgeon.
jlQHB9dvaa	It is not painful and only lasts a few short minutes.  If the doctor is a man, so what?  You think yours is the first vagina he has seen?  <br>  Remember that having a severe discharge may be part of whatever problem that you have and you are going in order to get better, so don't worry about that.  If it makes you more comfortable, trim up before you go for your appointment.<br>  Rest assured that medical professionals don't even give much thought to the naked bodies we see during exams and procedures.  We are there to help you and are in a very clinical state of mind at the time.<br>  Try not to worry.  Just be glad that you will finally find out what is wrong and be feeling better soon hopefully.|`|28TJbbNHaa	Ask for a female doctor and if they don't have one ask to be refered elsewhere to see one.|`|2wMMAKpOaa	At the moment I have the same problem. Although I'm getting an ultrasound instead. But do not worry at all about not shaving and the discharge. These are doctors/professionals. It's their jobs to deal with this stuff all day. And personally I don't like male doctors either, so I bring my fiance' with me. But if you're young then bring your mom along. I did when I was younger. Just relax and don't let it stress you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)<br>  -MVP|`|AA11581621	don't worry about the way it looks. they've seen it all. and if you've ever had a pap smear, I'm sure that probably hurts way more than what you're going to have done.

6blfbeTGaa	There are many things that could be causing this headache, although it's only been lasting a few days I'm sure it's nothing to worry about; However, if it persists tell your parents and have them take your sister to a doctor.

UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|AA11363680	I'm not sure if any of them are more likely than others, since they all remove most of the hormonal triggers to your sex drive.|`|LIlYZnJQaa	I use Yasmin and it is different from other birth control pills due to it ingrediants and I have had no problems keeping my sex drive up on this.

If you want a good place to buy Yasmin and you don't need a prior prescription either you can go to www.24hrpharmacies.net  I just had to fill out a short form and then my pills were approved and shipped to my door.

lU1a8VtMaa	Honestly if you want to know wheather or not your pregnant go see a doctor.But there can be alot of things with having a late period. Have you been stresses or working hard?? There can be alot of reason's why but one thing is that the pill is not 100% to stop you falling pregnant and if you have been making love without a condom well its really a choice you guys are making to risk a pregnancy. So if you feel now is not the time to have a beautiful miracle then make sure you use all the protection you can. <br>  <br>  I hope everything turns out for the best.|`|yOOEm9yDaa	lol dag ya dad be on you like that? how old are you?|`|28TJbbNHaa	Go to the doctor and get a pregnancy test.

A lot of small meals opposed to a few bigger ones-- make sure is has at least 8-10 or more g of protein, not too much protein because the body can only digest a certain amount at a time; and avoid too many fruits, carbs and sugars.

HNnVrvCfaa	All children - babies, toddlers and up, are aware of having genitals and they may touch themselves in a way that isn't masturbatory.  Often they do this because they've discovered it for themselves! Just in the same way that you would one day figure out you can lick your nose or something.      I really don't think you have anything to worry about.  Even if you had been molested that wouldn't have necessarily given you "urges".  Remember that what you did as a child wasn't driven by sex but by a new feeling.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	A doctor could tell if you had been molested as a baby/child.

I am not saying that you were, but if you feel that you need to figure this out, I would talk to a professional.|`|c0Hx73ITaa	That is normal for toddlers.

That had to be done when you were young. Do you remember who could of molested you?  Family member? Relative maybe? Or babysister?  Did your mom or dad find out and then took this person to court?  Try to get some counseling from a christian counselor if that helps you.

I never had a dry socket, neither did my sister. But it seemed to take a really long time to heal for me. You can only eat soft things like pudding and jello.

vqI5xt2jaa	You might have low tolerance toward the unexpected or your concerns might be legitimate. By the way I think these feeling that you have might be a good thing. However, If you want to develop a grater tolerance toward uncomfortable situations, which is what i believe your describing, this is what you need to do: exercise, read, and watch documentary. There is no easy solution toward having a low tolerance level in your life toward unpleasant situations. You can get rid of it within a short amount of time if you follow these steps.When I say exercise I do not mean running around your neighborhood, I am talking about excessive exercise. This means running until the point of unbearable exhaustion, do not take a water bottle with you. When I say read a book i do not mean reading books that are easy and fun for you to read, instead these books should demand a higher level of intellect, text books like on Islamic history or something about physics, or even Jewish theology Lastly if your going to watch tv, only watch documentary something educational, maybe something on physiology or maybe something like the mating habits of the kangaroo or whatever, that point being is that it is boring.

prqrQcd1aa	Diagnosis is based on a clinical assessment by a qualified mental health professional. The assessment incorporates the patient's self-reported experiences as well as the clinician's observations. The resulting profile may be supported or corroborated by long term patterns of behavior as reported by family members, friends or co-workers. The list of criteria that must be met for diagnosis is outlined in the DSM-IV-TR.[3]<br>  <br>  Borderline personality disorder was once classified as a subset of schizophrenia (describing patients with borderline schizophrenic tendencies). Today BPD is considered a relatively stable personality disorder and is used more generally to describe non-psychotic individuals who display emotional disregulation, splitting, and an unstable self image.[citation needed] Individuals with BPD are at high risk of developing other psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression. Other symptoms of BPD, such as dissociation, are frequently linked to severely traumatic childhood experiences which some put forth as one of the many root causes of the borderline personality. BPD has many similar characteristics to emotionally unstable personality disorder, subtype borderline; and complex post-traumatic stress disorder.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] DSM-IV-TR criteria<br>  The latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), the widely-used American Psychiatric Association guide for clinicians seeking to diagnose mental illnesses, defines Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) as: "a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image and affects, as well as marked impulsivity, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts."[14] BPD is classed on "Axis II", as an underlying pervasive or personality condition, rather than "Axis I" for more circumscribed mental disorders. A DSM diagnosis of BPD requires any five out of nine listed criteria to be present for a significant period of time. There are thus 256 different combinations of symptoms that could result in a diagnosis, of which 136 have been found in practice in one study.[15] The criteria are:[3]<br>  <br>  Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. [Not including suicidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in Criterion 5] <br>  A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation. <br>  Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self. <br>  Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., promiscuous sex, eating disorders, binge eating, substance abuse, reckless driving). [Again, not including suicidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in Criterion 5] <br>  Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, threats, or self-mutilating behavior such as cutting, interfering with the healing of scars (excoriation) or picking at oneself. <br>  Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days). <br>  Chronic feelings of emptiness, worthlessness. <br>  Inappropriate anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights). <br>  Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation, delusions or severe dissociative symptoms|`|AA10231834	Make frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. <br>  Have a pattern of difficult relationships caused by alternating between extremes of intense admiration and hatred of others. <br>  Have an unstable self-image or be unsure of his or her own identity. <br>  Act impulsively in ways that are self-damaging, such as extravagant spending, frequent and unprotected sex with many partners, substance abuse, binge eating, or reckless driving. <br>  Have recurring suicidal thoughts, make repeated suicide attempts, or cause self-injury through mutilation, such as cutting or burning himself or herself. <br>  Have frequent emotional overreactions or intense mood swings, including feeling depressed, irritable, or anxious. These mood swings usually only last a few hours at a time. In rare cases, they may last a day or two. <br>  Have long-term feelings of emptiness. <br>  Have inappropriate, fierce anger or problems controlling anger. The person may often display temper tantrums or get into physical fights. <br>  Have temporary episodes of feeling suspicious of others without reason (paranoia) or losing a sense of reality.|`|5lPg2Q50aa	Your first two answers cover a broad range on your topic. If you are trying to sift through these signs to determine something about yourself or someone you know, you might be better served to ask a more specific question. As you can see from these other two answers, wow, it covers a whole lot of areas. You could collate a dozen selected symptoms from these lists and create a more specific condition, such as sociopathic disorders. Maybe you're a psych major and doing a paper. I would like to know more about the specificity of your question and I would be glad to share some of my experience. Thanks.

There's a sexy way to offer without showing your skepticism of his responsibility.) Sometimes you just can't feel it, especially if you use thinner condoms and a strong lubricant. Speaking of which, popular lubricants contain chemicals that may alter your hormones (or cause cancer...), which combined with the stress, might have altered your menstrual cycle. <br>  <br>  Before you ask him, though, get a pregnany test. You might not have used condoms properly, which reduces their effectiveness.|`|lYQDCJgeaa	If you don't know, then two things are wrong here:<br>  1--You and he are not communicating properly.<br>  2--He is not putting the condom on early enough.<br>  <br>  To be effective, a condom needs to be put on as soon as there is an erection. You can get pregnant from pre-ejaculate, during foreplay.<br>  <br>  I would:<br>  1--ASK him if he puts on the condom. Better to look or feel stupid than to BE stupid.<br>  2--Make it part of foreplay for YOU to put it on him when he gets erect. It can be fun, and that way, you KNOW he's wearing it.<br>  <br>  Guys lie. Not all of them, but some.<br>  They don't like wearing condoms, so they'll lie.<br>  <br>  Do you see him taking one off?<br>  What goes on must come off, right?<br>  He should be holding onto the top of his penis when he withdraws from you, so the condom does not fall off and spill. Then he should carefully remove it from his penis, after he is away from your body..<br>  <br>  If you are usually regular on your period, and you are 19 days late, take a pregnancy test and see a doctor.|`|7MKmxkjlaa	well ... it would be smart to ask if he does ...... unless you wanna be prego ... i guess maybe ... his penis would be shiny ... ?|`|EsvJ9ji3aa	you know for sure if you put it on and only if you put it on...congrats you are probably pregnant and yes you should feel stupid it is your responsibility to make sure he is wearing a condom.|`|0jzF5SfPaa	you seem to immature to be having sex in the first place.<br>  why don't you look and see if he's wearing one?!?!?!<br>  you need to be responsible unless you wanna get pregnant...etc<br>  <br>  <br>  SPEAK UP!!!!|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	god open your eyes and look ,,, or put it on for him....|`|cCVvrIFHaa	this question is simple..<br>  <br>  <br>  look and see if theres a rubber like thing on his dick before you jump on it no offence|`|vvdq1QHoaa	I don't think that you can really tell unless it is ribbed or something. However, you can look for the ring towards the end of his penis. Either feel for it non nonchalantly or if you want to be more blunt about it ask him to show you the wrapper before you guys do the deed. I'm not sure of your situation but if possible you should make sure to always have some on you too or some other sort of contraceptive like spermicide or female condoms. Oh and the first time I had sex my period never came for a whole month but its normal to be really late or miss a whole month sometimes. To be on the safe side though, I would suggest getting a test, 'cause you never can be too safe.

Qxh1kPLfaa	The only item I see on the ingredient list from the link you supplied that could be questionable is caramel color.  It is one of those that "may" contain milk proteins.  Even if it does it is a minute amount.  It is one of the ingredients that we overlook in this house because it is so minute.  If you are going for 100% casein free, you  may want to call gerber and ask them specifically if this product contains milk proteins.  However I believe with the January 2006 allergy law that they would have to identify milk on the warning panel if it did contain a milk protein.|`|hxM8AXVRaa	I don't believe they are. Try looking in your local health food store like Bread and Circus / Whole food depending where you are.   The have plenty of gluten/ casein free products. you could probably find something similar to them.
BG8vMyZjaa	Warts are usually harmless, but may be unsightly. Warts on the feet are called verrucas and are sometimes painful. Warts and verrucas usually clear in time without treatment. If required, they can often be cleared more quickly with treatment. For example, by applying salicylic acid, or by freezing with liquid nitrogen or a cold spray, or by covering with tape.     Warts are small rough lumps on the skin. They are caused by a virus (human papilloma virus) which causes a reaction in the skin. Warts can occur anywhere on the body but occur most commonly on hands and feet. They range in size from 1mm to over 1cm. Sometimes only one or two warts develop. Sometimes several occur in the same area of skin. The shape and size of warts vary, and they are sometimes classed by how they look. For example: 'common warts', 'plane (flat) warts', 'filiform (finger-like) warts', 'mosaic warts', etc.    Verrucas are warts that occur on the soles of the feet. They are the same as warts on any other part of the body. However, they may look flatter as they tend to get 'trodden in'.|`|cO5k81Ozaa	if black centre surrounded by white circular edge -verucca    if small white polyp-like under foreskin-warts

GZCcHr0kaa	Well, first of all you absolutely need to see a doctor.  Anti-psychotic drugs need to be monitored, you need to be under a doctors care.  I wonder, do you feel like you are a squirrel, or can you just hear the squirrel in your head?  Those are two different things, both you need to see a doctor.  I noticed you said that you are "prescribed" an anti-psychotic med.....does that mean you aren't taking it?  Listen, there is nothing to be afraid of, make an appointment tomorrow.  In fact, don't just get one, get two opinions so you can decide what steps you need to take to be healthy.  It must be awful to feel that way, and I wish you all the best in solving this problem.  God Bless You, now...GO SEE A DOCTOR :)|`|v8F2UeXCaa	haha nuts. no pun intended ey. not sure if this is a serious question or not, but if so maybe its time to revisit your doctor|`|05SbMDA6aa	It sounds like you are on the wrong medication. Medication aims to treat a person to leave you feeling balanced as a normal person. That you feel you have a squirrel in your head/ taking over your mind suggests that your medication isn't effective enough. I would suggest visiting your psychiatrist and seeing if there's anything he is able to help with. I'm sure this will get you on the path to feeling yourself again. It is possible to relate to other beings and empathise parts of your personality with them but this shouldn't predominate your personality so I think something is wrong but I'm sure it is easily remedied. Best of luck.|`|Rt02nQ7yaa	the secret squirell army once told me that every time you fart they follow you and then eventualy they take over your mind but if you burp they run away and hide.|`|YwYxff87aa	Maybe you should see a psychiatrist or a psychologist. <br>  It doesnt't make much sense to me but if you see a doctor, s/he will probably explain things with more clarity, thats their job.|`|03Sn2lZuaa	well you could be nuts, squirrel's like nuts....

My aunt has seen the "ghost" of some kid she knew when she was little. I (along with a cousin) have seen the "ghost" of our grandmother. So, for anyone whose doubtful, yes - this does happen, and no - it does not mean youre crazy.<br>  <br>  We have all only seen the ghosts/spirits once. Or at least I have (thank God!), I assume my family members havent had the experience again since they never brought up any other experiences. Pray about it. Seeing my grandmother freaked us out, and I prayed to God that I never have that vision again. It was too much for me, regardless of any lessons I was supposed to learn. I will pray for you too.|`|aL0OCQG3aa	Try making contact with him? Try speaking with him, and see what he says back to you.

yhjoTuHzaa	You are in no way too fat. You, if anything, are light for you height. There seems to be a concern amongst young women more than young men on how they look. Believe me - I'm Sixty now - when you are in your thirties you will look back on that concern and say ,"How could I have been so dumb". What really matters is your inner beauty. <br>  <br>  To aide you on the way I am going to suggest a book for you to read. It is Nutrition for Dummies. Out of all the books on nutrition and exercise that I have read, this one seems to be the best for understanding the subject of nutrition.

tmM9LHEAaa	It seems that everyone has a piece of sage advice to offer about how to get rid of toe nail fungus. Some advice is very simple: apply Vicks VapoRub, Listerine, tea tree oil, or any one of a dozen other substances. Other remedies take more effort, like soaking the affected toenail(s) in a solution of dilute bleach, hydrogen peroxide, vinegar, Listerine, or some other chemical for a period of time each day.<br>  <br>  Then there are the doctor recommended medications: topical ointments, nail lacquer, or oral drugs. These treatments are easy, and may have stronger scientific backing, but they are by far the most expensive.<br>  <br>  Getting rid of finger nail fungus is easier in some ways, and more difficult in others. Many people will act on a finger nail infection long before they will start asking how to get rid of toe nail fungus, simply because toes can be kept out of sight, but ugly fingernails are a daily embarrassment. People start getting rid of finger nail fungus before the infection is too far advanced. However, it's much harder to get a topical treatment to stay on a fingernail when you’re using your hands all the time, and it's much harder to sit for 15 to 30 minutes every day with your hands soaking in a solution.<br>  <br>  Pick any method for getting rid of finger nail fungus, or any advice on how to get rid of toe nail fungus. If you do any reading, you will quickly discover that all methods are fickle. VapoRub works for some and not for others. Stories of success with a vinegar soak abound; so do stories of failure. Some lucky people report success in weeks; some stress that you may have to keep at it for a year or more. Even the prescription medications have a relatively poor success rate. The bottom line is that curing nail fungus infection is difficult.<br>  <br>  The best advice follows a four step approach. First, see your doctor to get the diagnosis confirmed – other things can look like nail fungus that aren't. Talk to your doctor about treatment options.<br>  <br>  Second, if you are reluctant to take any of the prescription medications, like many people, or if you simply want to learn about other ways of treating nail fungus, consult a natural healing professional or do your own research.<br>  <br>  The third step is to choose a treatment. Any advice on how to get rid of toe nail fungus will probably work just as well for getting rid of finger nail fungus. Remember that any of the choices could have unpleasant and unintended side effects, and none are as foolproof as their proponents claim. Finally, stick with it. All types of nail fungus treatment take time to work.<br>  <br>  David Bloom is an avid health enthusiast and a regular contributor to a variety of health websites. He is the author of How to Get Rid of Toenail Fungus, a blog dedicated to the treatment of fingernail and toenail fungus.
e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	Cold sensitivity is the least diagnostic feature.  This means that all kinds of things cause cold sensitivity (clenching, grinding, gum recession, cavities, sinus infections...etc)<br>  You probably have a small wear spot where the enamel is thin.  This doesn't mean a chip or a cavity, but will temporarily increase cold sensitivity.  It gets more sensitive the more you worry about it.  Try sensodyne toothpaste or something similar.  It's probably nothing to worry about|`|0u7JWSfvaa	put a picture on and it will be clearer....<br>  if u have pain /sensitivity on drinking hot and cold things it can indicate a cavity...also made worse by eating sweets but tht sets i later...if the pain/sensitivy is in the same place everytime then a cavity can be considered|`|Vy8p3Qlcaa	No.|`|nlbwcfi0aa	ya it probably a cavity and ow they hurt|`|5UlD5mVpaa	It's probably just chipped, and I say this for two reasons:<br>  a) were it a cavity, your dentist would have caught it<br>  b) it would be discoloured if it were a cavity

wTmGTmC4aa	If you can go to a Rheumatologist on your own, then make the appointment without your Dr. sending you.  To diagnose RA, it does not require the use of an MRI.  For him to say, "It's JUST RA," is totally irresponsible of him.  RA is a very serious disease.  I know because I have it.  There are some fantastic meds on the market now for RA.  I am on Humira.  Your MD has you on Steroids right now, which for a quick yet short term answer, is great, it won't help you in the long run.  Steroids have long lasting effects that are not good.<br>  <br>  It is imperative you see a Rheumatologist.  If your MD can't help you or won't help you and you have to have a referral, find a new PCP and talk with him/her about getting the help you need...and deserve!<br>  <br>  Good luck and feel better.<br>  <br>  Me|`|mAp90hEeaa	He needs to have some preliminary testing done before you see the rheumatologist, otherwise, you will be wasting your time seeing him at this time.  And, he needs to have tried a trial of methylprednisolone to see what your response to this medication will be.  All of this gives information to the rheumatologist as to what the next step will then be in treating your condition.  In the meantime, hopefully, you are taking some pain medication (tylenol) on a regular basis for your pain.  Call your doctor and ask him to schedule your lab work and MRI so that you can go to the rheumatologist.  Sometimes, they do forget things and a phone call might get the ball rolling.|`|WBZAszdzaa	RA has to be DX'd by blood samples and X-rays,etc...He probably gave you the drug of choice but it is not a drug not to be followed up on because there are side effects with long term use.

RA requires treatment to lessen the pain such as passive range of motion excercises, moist heat, etc...You might want to see someone who is concerned for your well being<br>  GL

Mxq1NQJdaa	It would not seem unlikely that the excessive intake of energy drinks would cause burning feeling in stomach....particularly if they are consumed on an empty stomach.  You will be in a better position to make this determination after you quit drinking them for a couple of days......can try using some Zantac to neutralize excessive stomach acid, which will help with the burning, and can also take some Mylanta.|`|tBZOj4KBaa	I think you may have ulcers.<br>  have you been stressing a lot lately ?<br>  do you have a poor diet ?<br>  eating a lot of spicy foods ?
UffpiRLZaa	i dont think there are any over the counter medicines that will affect the depo shot...the only thing that would even come close is antibiotics. Be careful when on any kind of birth control if you end up having to take an antibiotic for whatever reason...always always use a back up birth control ( condoms) for at least a week after the antibiotics are gone just better to be safe than sorry...but really that is the only thing that will affect the depo shot from being effective...
iEVEfPaVaa	The things you have heard are true.  Some people have even driven to work and have absolutely no memory of it.  This problem is worse with the long acting Ambien called Ambien CR.  However it can happen with normal release too.  I was on ambien CR for a while.  I kept finding food packages around my place when I woke up in the morning and the food was gone.  One day I went to microwave some supper.  When I opened the microwave door I found 6 or 7 things, none of which were food.|`|2SQxX4oSaa	I thought it was mainly  stuff like Prozac and other anti-depressents where people supposedly killed themselves while on the meds...<br>  <br>  But Ambien is a very popular name brand of a sleeping pill. Nothing too fascinating about it. <br>  <br>  Yes, people probably used it to kill themself, because if you eat a whole bottle of such things, it probably will not do pleasant things to you.<br>  But the person would have to be deadly depressed to over-dose on sleeping pills, so it's not the sleeping pills' fault.<br>  <br>  I don't think anyone should use sleeping pills though, because they are artificially altering your brain and are completely un-necessary.|`|YqayaySoaa	Yes it's a sleeping pill. I know of 2 people that had horrible nightmares with it.|`|GQZDcfUiaa	Ambien is a sleeping pill. BEWARE of Ambien CR, it made me hallucinate.

BSU9pNUWaa	Unfortunately there are too many loopholes both employees and employers can take to avoid or pursue legal action. Your best move would be to seek out legal consultation.

Just like a company does not have to hire a person, they don't need any reason to keep him.  If he does get fired, he can fight for his unemployment based on his medical problem and may be able to win his benefits which are now up to nine months long.  <br>  <br>  hope this helps..|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	No, he shouldn't be fired....if he is, he should take it to human rights court...|`|l7GjBVvhaa	Unfortunately most likely yes. If he is unable to carry about his normal work routine his employer is able to fire him. You can try to meet with the "boss man" and explain that he is on strict doctor's orders, maybe the boss will have a heart. Like I said though, if an employee can't not carry out the duties for his job he can be fired. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you....|`|MJyM1XWJaa	yes, if he cannot do his job then why would they have to keep him if he can no longer do the job he was hired to do? He should explain to the employer how long he needs to still be on light duties since the boss said eventually.|`|NhF9sM5jaa	It is illegal to fire someone over illness or conditions.

I shave, so have the shaving bumps along with ingrown hairs. As for the ingrown, there's not much you can do. Its going to happen plain and simple. All you can really do is try to sooth them. Maybe after getting waxed, try some of the cooling gels out there for men that get shaving bumps. It might help. Also, you might want to check with the person doing your waxing and see if they have any tips. Sometimes they can be a font of information.|`|r4N245AOaa	Psuedofolliculitis Barbae refers to hair which has been cut or broken off below the skin level which then begins to grow through surrounding tissue rather than out of the follicle.<br>  <br>  In other cases, hair curls round and starts growing back into the skin causing irritation and inflammation.<br>  <br>  If you shave the pubic area, you remove the tapered end of the hair and, as the hair grows back without that tapered end, the sharpness will literally cut the skin surrounding the hair follicle.<br>  <br>  Use these simple precautions to minimize the discomfort from ingrown pubic hairs:<br>  <br>  #1<br>  <br>  For ingrown pubic hairs along the bikini line, hold a hot compress against ingrown spots for ten minutes three times a day to soften the skin and help the hairs work their way out.<br>  <br>  #2<br>  <br>  Wear loose-fitting underwear and clothing until the bumps are gone to avoid friction.<br>  <br>  #3<br>  <br>  Some find it helpful to exfoliate the area before waxing. This removes some of the dead skin cells in the top layer of skin cells that often contribute to trapping the hairs.<br>  <br>  Exfoliating options include creams, lotions, or body gels, a slightly abrasive washcloth or glove specifically designed for exfoliation. Check at the beauty counter at your local department store.<br>  <br>  #4<br>  <br>  Do not exfoliate the skin if you already have ingrown pubic hairs as further skin irritation may result.<br>  <br>  #5<br>  <br>  When waxing, be sure to pull the hair out by the roots. Do not allow the hair to break below the skin surface.<br>  <br>  #6<br>  <br>  Use Ingrown Hair Treatment (see below). It prevents pubic ingrown hair and eliminates existing ingrown hair within days.<br>  <br>  Additional note: For ingrown hairs which are deep, sterilize a pair of needle-nosed tweezers with rubbing alcohol and individually lift each ingrown hair out of its follicle. Wipe the area with alcohol afterwards and shave.<br>  <br>  If needle-nosed tweezers are not available, wipe a pin or needle and the ingrown area with rubbing alcohol, then carefully release the hair in the direction that it grows using the tip of the needle only. After the hair is released, wipe the skin with alcohol again.

8cuPVvYnaa	I'm so sorry for what you're going through. You are right, growing up these days can be terribly hard, and it sounds like things are pretty bad for you right now. I have gone through times in my life where I couldn't see the reason to go on. It was like being lost in thick darkness and not seeing any way out. We were made to love and to be love, and without that love it can be more than any one can bear. But two things have I learned that has helped me. One is that nothing stays the same. As much as it seems as if your life will always be this way, it just isn't true. Remind yourself that this WILL pass. You will not be stuck in this same place forever. And two, I have come to realize that Someone created me. And He created you too. He created you because He loves you very much and He has a very special plan for your life, although you may not know what it is right now. Ask God to show Himself to you. And then open your eyes. He sometimes answers in simple ways that could be missed if you're not paying attention. If you are bold enough, find a church. Find one that teaches about Jesus and his love. God not only loves you very much, but He wants to give you the desires of your heart (love, security, peace, happiness...) So, don't give up hun. You are a very valuable young lady and have all kinds of adventures ahead of you.|`|Pgx4IEGTaa	don't,don't, stay alive,god loves you you are his child,he doesn't want to see that|`|hKMO5xJvaa	Your teenage years are almost over and when you become a grown adult then you can basicly do whatever you want. But it would be bad if you just "quit" you life. Some people care for you even your parents care for you. But yea you should still live your life. Somebody out there loves you and does care for you. So just take some time to think about it. Life is great!  Even yours :]|`|WeRVjgpMaa	You are right, being 17 is really hard, but we all go through different situations, so no one can tell you to get over it and just move on, etc.  As hard as it is....no one is going to realize your worth until you do.

5QKAuezOaa	Do you mean the normal ranges? Cholesterol readings should be 200 and below. The higher the number over 200, the more of an increase in developing placque in your arteries.  The docs usually don't worry about low cholesterol readings unless they stay under 140, only because this can be a sign of colon cancer. Cholesterol is broken down into HDL (good cholesterol) and LDL (bad cholesterol) The higher the HDL reading the better. A high LDL reading can be a sign of atherosclerosis or placque build up in the arteries which leads to heart disease if untreated.|`|mAp90hEeaa	Anything over 200 is considered high - it is not measured in a percentage.  If you are seeking HDL and LDL levels, you can go to WebMd which lists these numbers for both males and females.|`|2qPtGTNcaa	The recommended targets are 200 for overall cholesterol, no more than 100 for LDL( "bad cholesterol") and a minimum of between 40 and 60 for HDL ("good cholesterol").|`|AMwe70oWaa	It changes all the time.

Otherwise they just turn red. also, soak your legs at least 5 min. before shaving.<br>  I used to put lotion on my legs after, thinking that would help, but found that I was allergic to the lotion. The only thing that seems to help is rubbing aloe vera gel that doesn't have any color, alcohol or fragrances. You might try that after you shave. Hydrocortizone cream can also help reduce swelling. I haven't tried the product on tv, but it looks like it would be irritating.|`|4gYHq6Lxaa	Is this product right for you?
gx7s1M5gaa	Chew some minty gum. <br>  <br>  Offer your date some too.|`|BdlGBdE5aa	You need to look at bad breath in a different way.  Bad breath is caused by bacteria that grow on the top of your tongue.  You can generally see this bacteria by looking for the "white stuff" on the back of your tongue.  In order to control bad breath this white stuff needs to be removed on a regular basis.  Eating food can cause bad breath, however, if two of you eat the same food, you will not be offended by each other's breath because your nose is used to that particular smell.  If you eat a spicy food (such as garlic) alone and then meet someone they will be offended by your breath.  Bad breat prevention is the best medicine.  I recently found a great tongue clearner, OraBrush<br>  <a href="http://www.orabrush.com/halitosis.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com/halitosis.php</a>|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Gum, mints, or breath sprays. (like Binaca)|`|AA12240465	Bad breath is caused by germs that live on your tongue, it's true. However feeding them some mints or gum will often just make them worse - sure the minty stuff will cover up the smell for a little bit, but eventually it comes back worse than ever.<br>  <br>  Best solution is to brush your teeth AND TONGUE before your date and avoid eating foods high in proteins or odorous foods, and definitely stay away from dairy... those tongue bacteria LOVE foods like cheese, ice cream, etc and multiply faster.<br>  <br>  You really don't need a specialty tongue cleaner. Your toothbrush will do the trick, so save your money. Having some mouthwash with you in a small travel-sized bottle can be a good idea in case things get hot and heavy though. Avoid mouthwash with alcohol or coloring in it - otherwise you will get dry mouth or even a silly blue tongue.
EsvJ9ji3aa	It would have been positive already. Plan B can delay your period. It delayed mine last time I took it. Besides since you had just gotten over your period you were not ovulating and the plan b works if taken within 3 days. The plan B is just delaying your period. NO worries. Take care|`|HzUM8hVSaa	wait and take the test again.|`|lYQDCJgeaa	If your period ended on the 16th, that means it began on the 13th. When you had sex on the 18th, it was only the 5th day of your cycle.<br>  <br>  HIGHLY unlikely that you got pregnant. I'm guessing the effects you are seeing are a result of the Plan B, which really plays havoc with your hormonal cycle.<br>  <br>  If you DID conceive on the 18th, that would make you now FIVE weeks pregnant, as pregnancy is counted from the day your last period BEGAN, as technically, your reproductive cycle begins with your period.<br>  <br>  At 5 weeks, you would get a positive reading, so again, unlikely you are. However, home pregnancy tests are not 100% accurate.<br>  <br>  SEE YOUR DOCTOR!
099f9932fda7deca1bf90d1e23d79b0eaa	Exercise and eat enough and necessary food.|`|cnyU6KXzaa	Well that is an easy question to answer, go the Operation Goliath route. You will not improve if you do not lift, this is the core value to work on this obviously. However with lifting there are other things as well. You NEED protein, whey is good but don't stop at that. With a heavy workout you will want one gram of protein for every pound in your body. Eat tuna! lots and lots, eat it straight with salt and pepper and it is the easiest healthy snack ever, you may hate it but you will grow to like it. Salmon and beef are good too. WATER! I guarantee you don't get enough, pound that stuff! Get a good multivitamin as well (The whey and vitamin can be found at GNC). As for how to work out, do not work on the same muscle 2 days in a row. Lift 3-5 days a week for 30 minutes high weight low rep for bulk and the opposite for longer for endurance, do a different muscle group with different lifts for each muscle everyday. DO NOT NEGLECT YOUR LEGS! if your legs grow so does your upper body and your body naturally creates more testosterone as well. Get the arnold schwarzenagger bodybuilding encyclopedia, it is a vast goldmine of information. Eat before you sleep or at least drink milk or you will go catabolic (Lose muscle) in your sleep. Take your protein an hour or less after your workout. Do not neglect your workout if you workout for a week and then take off for two you are back to square one. as far as the actual lifting goes make sure you have at minimum a schedule. a simple split is to do upper body one day, and then the next legs and abs. more effective would be something like doing the pecs one day, back the next, legs, and then bi's, tris and delts the next, rest day and then repeat with pecs again. you can incorporate more one more rest day if needed. Once again Push yourself until failure on every set and do not lift more than you can handle with correct form or you will never get stronger. Before and after your workout, NEVER FORGET TO STRETCH! this is easy to forget and seems like it doesn't matter but it most definately does. Hold stretches for 30 seconds. It is a pain but it is worth it.<br>  <br>  And remember: EAT, EAT, EAT, EAT, and then EAT MORE.<br>  <br>  Any questions?

Creatine just helps the muscles heal quicker, that is how muscle mass is made. <br>  <br>  The muscles have little microscopic tears, and when those tears heal, the muscle becomes stronger. So the faster it heals, the more often you can work out, and you shouldn't be as sore.<br>  <br>  But if you don't do a full body work out after the Creatine, you might actually gain weight.|`|9ib0tC9Waa	It definitely would if you are fat and you're sneaking some cardio in there too. Generally creatine is just going to make you stronger and dehydrate you bad. If you take it drink at least twice as much water as normal. If you don't drink alot of water it will also kill your liver. After I took creatine I didn't get tired or dehydrated I was as strong as when I was on it. All creatine does is turns ADP ( used energy ) into ATP ( ready to use energy ). So using creatine gives your muscles more energy and also restores them faster. Never take more than 5 grams a day, people will tell you, you need more, but it is PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE to use more than that, and more could harm your body.|`|VpiXyro8aa	well it would turn fat into muscle but if your skinny and take it and lift you're just gonna get bigger and heavier but it will be muscle mass..however i dont recommend taking it because once you stop your muscles get real weak and also it dehydrates you|`|rRfV3Pmuaa	um, muscle is heavier than fat.<br>  so u wud see an increase in weight not a decrease.|`|lWRYngmSaa	Creatine will help you gain muscle mass only if your eating enough protein(to a certain point).  Creatine lets your muscles harvest more proteins.  I find that I can work out harder and lift more weight with less muscle fatigue if I use before I work out, about 30 min. before.  Also, everything depends on genetics.  You might find it easier to loose fat, than to gain muscle.  Creatine and protein and the right exercise will help you do both.|`|KYCpcibRaa	creatines main purpose is to transform the used up ATP, which is called ADP, back into ATP. to allowing you to gain more energy, it also transports a lot of water into your muscles, making them larger. ultimately adding weight to you... and it should be taken post workout for best results.<br>  <br>  But although it is made to give you back your energy its best taken after your workout with carbs and protein, since it will transport all the nutrients into your muscles thus triggering the growth hormones in your body. <br>  <br>  so i would work out, then take the creatine with carbs and protein, and if your on the heavier side than yes you probably will loose weight, but im not 100% sure on it. muscle does weight more, so it all depends on the speed at which you loose the fat....<br>  <br>  check out the whole pro's and con's for when to take creatine here...<br>  <a href="http://www.creatinemonohydrate.net/creatine_newsletter_18.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.creatinemonohydrate.net/creat...</a>|`|k3d4EFetaa	creatine helps make u look good u will gain muscle fast but if u exercise hard u will lose it<br>  <br>  <br>  creatine is like for bodybuilding not for actually getting ripped|`|Mg53KODHaa	TOTALLY DUDE|`|rVfztEUEaa	i don't even know what creatine is
Gg7wc3Wpaa	It can, but that's not necessarily how it works. Muscle does burn more calories than fat. So, if you're building more muscle when youre lifting weight then you are going to burn more calories. Push-ups, or playing basketball, however, are great ways of getting in your cardio which also is known for serious fat burning. Either way, you'll reap great benefits from these exercises and it's always suggested that people do cardio and strength training combined. Like strength training 2 days a week and cardio for 3?? Up to you. <br>  <br>  God bless|`|FaVYRoXqaa	In the long run, yes.  All resistance training (including push ups) builds muscle, which burns more calories at a ratio of 75:1.|`|LrtgKFkZaa	muscles need a lot of calories to maintain so yes you can eat more if you're more musclar. so to answer your question...ya it could help you lose weight

There are stronger, prescription cough medications that will stop the cough but she would have to ask her physician for this.

tMtBe1lKaa	lice, crabs and scabies are parasites, hydrocortisone won't kill them. You will probably need to see a dermatologist for something that will kill them. Hydrocortisone is similar to a chemical that your body produces, and it's purpose is to releive itchiness. Rashes and Hives are caused by your enviroment (allergic reactions, high fevers), and hydrocortisone releive itchiness, and can reduce swelling in these cases as well. If it is something like a poison oak rash (contact dermatitis) then calamine lotion or aloe vera will help also. <br>  <br>   Ice packs can also help.

Some people have flu symptoms within a few months after they get infected, but it is impossible to tell the difference between flu symptoms caused by HIV and flu symptoms caused by actual flu.

In any case, get your self tested just for your own peace of mind. Go to another doctor or clinic besides the one you normally use if you feel embarassed by this.

Only by doing this can your body use the excess energy to build muscle. If you eat less than you burn, there is no way to gain weight, it's as simple as that. Your first step is to figure out how many calories your body burns per day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a>  to get an estimate. Now eat more than you burn and you're on your way to gaining muscle.<br>  <br>  Gaining weight is as simple as eat more than you burn but if you want to gain muscle, you also need to exercise. If you just ate more without lifting weights, you'd just gain fat and become unhealthy and overweight. When you lift weights (or participate in any strength training) you're actually causing some damage to your muscles. <br>  <br>  When you rest, your body uses those extra calories to repair and rebuild the muscles. When this process is complete, the muscle is stronger and a bit bigger than it was before. You obviously won't notice a difference right away, but over time you will find yourself becoming stronger and bigger.<br>  <br>  You need to keep your diet clean to gain the right kind of weight. Stay away from sugary and simple carb foods such as candy, foods made with white flour, soda and other junk. These foods will promote fat storage, something you don't need. Stick to foods made from whole wheat flour, oats, brown rice, lean sources of protein (chicken, some cuts of beef, fish), nuts, beans, legumes and protein shakes - yum yum.

kiuNmf9iaa	chew gum?|`|nkMbQFv7aa	In most cases bad breath (halitosis) is caused by the presence of oral bacteria. There can be, however, other factors that influence the odor associated with one's breath and, in fact, the quality of a person's breath will ultimately depend on a number of different variables. <br>  <br>  Periodontal disease, often just called "gum disease," can be the source of a person's breath problems<br>  <br>  There can be some types of untreated dental pathology that can contribute the problems a person is having with their breath. Any active infections in a person's mouth, such as those associated with abscessed teeth or a partially erupted wisdom tooth, can cause bad breath. Teeth having extensive untreated decay can trap enough debris and bacteria that they become the source of foul odors. Your dentist can identify and treat these problem dental conditions if they exist.|`|bwn5cGfJaa	hey Jojo!  hopefully IF it's not halitosis, it could be something called "calcium calcification" or "tonsilliths" ask your ENT about it.

AOCqOTfBaa	Hi Jacqueline C<br>  <br>  Cute picture of you, a wide variety of disorders can cause pain in or around the eye. In general, if the pain is persistent, severe, or associated with decreased vision, seek medical attention immediately.<br>  <br>  Some of the problems that can cause eye pain are:<br>  <br>  Burns<br>  Conjunctivitis (pink eye) or any inflammation of the upper and lower lids<br>  Contact lens complications<br>  Eye problems (infection, irritation, or injury such as a corneal abrasion)<br>  Eye surgery<br>  Glaucoma<br>  Migraine headache<br>  Sinus problems<br>  Stye (hordeolum)<br>  Viral infections such as the flu<br>  <br>  If the problem is eye strain, rest should relieve the discomfort. If you think your eye pain is due to wearing contact lenses, avoid wearing the lenses for a few days and see if the pain goes away. If the pain is severe, call your doctor. Hope you feel better petty girl!|`|e880bf3780c6ebc1868c580fec232f00aa	MY WHOLE FAMILY CURRENTLY HAS THAT<br>  <br>  SOO WEIRDDDD
AA10185333	The smart thing to do would be to ice it for the time being, 20 mins on, then off for and hour, then ice it again for 20 mins, then off for an hour, so on and so forth.<br>  <br>  And when You sleep tonight, see if You can maybe prop it up so that the blood drains from the swolen and bruised area. This will hopefully help with pain too.<br>  <br>  When You have a chance, You need to see a doctor so that he/she can see to it what they need to do. More than likely they will have to splint it, then decide from there whether or not to cast it.<br>  <br>  Sorry about Your injury. Good luck. Feel better.|`|pa8PSGzVaa	ice it for a bit and then bandage it up.  to bandage it, find something to keep it straight, like a Q-tip (which is what i use when i sprain a finger), and put one directly on top and below it and tape it up as it is.
nkMbQFv7aa	You'll have a hole in your tooth|`|e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	If your tongue can't find it, then it's not there.  Sometimes we crash our teeth hard enough that it feels like something must have happened.  With inspection, many times, nothing has.  Your story is common.  The best thing is that nothing is sensitive.  If you keep worrying about it and checking teeth with your tongue, however, you will get headaches and your teeth WILL get sensitive to cold.<br>  So give it a good tooth by tooth check with your tongue, then forget about it.
ViLEm5PKaa	This may be caused by an allergy or bacterial infection.  I recommend speaking with your physician to make sure you are not exposing yourself to a potentially dangerous situation.<br>  If the rash is not severe and you are not experiencing any other symptoms, it may just be a mild allergic reaction.  One way to minimize your reaction to the chlorine is to shower thoroughly as soon as you get out of the water.  To help clear up an existing rash faster and ease any associated discomfort, there is an infant skin care cream called Aquaphor that is very effective in alleviating chlorine rash.<br>  You might also want to try A+D original ointment diaper rash and all purpose skincare formula or a hydrocortizone cream.

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Yes.  Hepatitis B is spread through blood and body secretions.  It's most often caught through sharing a needle, but the second most common way to catch it is through unprotected sex.  A pregnant mother can pass it on to her unborn child, and sex partners certainly can pass it to one another in the semen or vaginal secretions.  If you had such an exposure, you need to be treated now.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	There is a good chance.|`|3Gr7nRgyaa	yes, if you have intercourse with a hepatitis infected person you have more than a 70% chance of infecting yourself. Please, if you haven't done it yet, please do not have sex with an infected person or use a condom at the very least. Hepatitis B is very contagious.|`|4onT0qUxaa	YES!!!! It is as inevitable as getting dirt on your tongue by licking the ground. If you use condoms, you will greatly decrease the chance of exposure, but not 100%. Protect yourself!!!|`|0KtFtnZVaa	There is a vaccine for hep B.
AA11375099	I am sure the place where you will be getting this done will have all of those answers for you.  I commend you to take this action and support your aunt and others fighting this terrible disease.  <br>  <br>  How is she doing?  Usually breast cancer had a good survival rate, but the things the patient needs to experience is terrible.|`|OFToxXGZaa	I have the breast cancer ribbon with 'mum' through it tattooed on the outside of my left wrist. It hasn't stretched at all.<br>  <br>  I also have another tattoo on the inside of my right wrist. This also hasn't stretched. Although where you are getting the tattoo is an area of the body that moves a lot, you will be fine. The tattoo won't stretch there and become distorted. Also, tattoo's don't hurt so don't worry.<br>  Have fun!
WBZAszdzaa	To find Wilson,s without obvious signs such as brown around the iris (actually copper) you would probably have to have blood work drawn for heavy metals, family history, and other signs and sx's. To catch it depends on the dr.
0BOYe0Wgaa	you may want to call your dr back. are you spotting or bleeding at all? It could be implantation cramping which is very normal. if you have spotting or bleeding of any kind, that's usually a sign of a miscarriage, and get to the doctor to get checked out.
MhpccWpmaa	you could've miscarried.  if there's was a lot of blood and the cramps were really intense that's probably what happened|`|Hj3fPypGaa	I highly suggest that you go see your doctor. This condition could be something serious so the sooner you see your doctor the faster some thing serious could be prevented.|`|0x2oSVAzaa	I think the clotting is pretty normal... that happens to me a lot too, but usually its just the lining that is passing through too... but i would say if it gets heavier and the clotting gets worse contact your Dr.
flDjY6Tpaa	Tampons can only be risky to use if you don't take them out regularly. Tampons are actually more comfortable and easy to use than pads. With pads, you risk the blood seeping and it going through your clothing (like many girls experienced at our all girls highschool!)<br>  Tampons are very easy to insert. There are tampon applicators you can use, but I honestly didn't find them that useful when I first started using tampons.<br>  Basically you need to relax your vaginal muscles to insert the tampon correctly. So don't worry about doing it otherwise your muscles become tighter and you will struggle getting it in.<br>  First you should experiment with your middle finger (wash your hands first obviously)<br>  Get a mirror and have a look at the hole where you're going to insert it. Put your middle finger in that hole (it's about the same width as a mini tampon really.<br>  You'll find that it fits in quite easily. Basically just push the tampon up there like you did your middle finger ensuring you're relaxed and not stressing (nothing to stress about!)<br>  Once it is in, use your middle finger to ensure it's pushed in. You'll know it's inserted properly if you can walk around and not feel like you have anything in. If you can feel the tampon inside you, it's not inserted properly.<br>  It sometimes takes practice, so keep at it, but really, it's easy and you should have no problem.<br>  Also, make sure you're in the middle of your period when doing it for the first time, so it's wetter in there (gross but true)<br>  They say you should alternate between tampons and pads, like one day tampons, next day pads, but I tend to use tampons for the 4 days of my cycle.<br>  Don't wear it in at night. That's a no no. Wear a pad at night if you need to.<br>  Remember to change your tampon regularly. Everytime you need to pee, change the tampon. That's a good rule to follow.<br>  Your mum probably is concerned about TSS - Toxic Shock Syndrome.<br>  This is a rare but very real condition.<br>  But it will definitely not happen to you if you regularly change your tampon.<br>  <br>  Either way, tampons are a personal choice. Some prefer to use pads, but tampons are really effective and very safe if you use them properly.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|tVHFekZlaa	you should covince her, they are a miracle. they are way cleaner, they don't hurt at all i like em way better.|`|2980af5b4722d033c6edc3ef6f679894aa	if your mom ends up ok with it do it<br>  they are not so comfortable at first. and you have to make sure you change them regularly. but they are convient.|`|KWCZleYUaa	you should definitely try a tampon.<br>  i used pads for the first few years and i wish i started using tampons earlier. just start off with small ones. youll get used to them fast and like them a lot better than disgusting pads! it might hurt in the beginning but probably not for too long!!|`|tNsgJTLOaa	if you have never used one, DO NOT use the cardboard ones. tampax pearl is plastic and slides easily with no pain. if your period is heavy you should have no pain taking it out. if it is light then it may hurt to pull out. start with the small ones too. And if its uncomfortable take it out.
eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	It varies from hospital to hospital.  As a rule there are three colors used for triage purposes- green, yellow and red.  Green means that the problem is not life threatening and can wait pretty much indefinitely.  Yellow means the problem is more serious, not a life threat, but can become more serious.  Red obviously means something needs to be done now, or at least in the next few minutes to preserve life or limb.   There are also other stickers used to tag patients with special needs or considerations- like allergies, mental illness, diabetes, drugs, etc.  At our hospital, we use one of the three colors, plus a different color beneath that for special conditions alerts.  Not everyone gets two stickers, and they can be in various combinations depending on the need.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	You just answered your question in your question.....<br>  <br>  <br>  keep in mind; All hospitals are different with the colors,  some mean:<br>  <br>  Allergy<br>  Fall Risk<br>  DNR<br>  Blood Transfusion<br>  Observation<br>  Isolation<br>  Latex Allergy<br>  Restricted Extremity<br>  <br>  There are all kinds and that is mainly wristbands I am talking about.

Your BEST ANSWER.|`|qzpQdJ44aa	At 13, it could be that you're not producing any semen at all.  How, some guys can *** by 12th birthday itself.  It depends from boy to boy.<br>  <br>  The clear stuff that you mention is a normal thing that all of us produce before we actually ejaculate.  It's called pre-ejaculatory fluid.  It ouses out of the penis when we are sexually excited, and it also helps to lubricate the penis as it's consistency is sticky in nature.<br>  <br>  Keep stroking your penis for longer until it start feeling real good.

6adc597e9fb33038cff31ccea702d7bcaa	If her blood sugar is increasing afterwards, it has nothing to do with the insulin.  Is she eating when she takes the insulin?  That's what most people do, they inject insulin before a meal.  The food is what is making her blood sugar go up.  Insulin makes blood sugar go down, always.  She may just need more insulin when she eats.  But she shouldn't be adjusting it herself, she needs a doctor to get her on track.|`|8OqdoIHtaa	Insulin doesn't usually cause blood sugar to rise, however, if you are taking too much it can. It triggers a release of glucogon from the liver, which can raise your blood sugar. <br>  <br>  So she is either not taking enough for the food she eats, or she's taking too much. <br>  <br>  She needs an enocrinologist to help her get this under control, those are dangerous levels. She is probably in for another hospital stay.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	Insulin does not cause the blood sugar to increase.  Your girlfriend must see a doctor about this.  She should see an endocrinologist.  Endocrinologists specialize in diabetes and can help her manage her condition.

I say this cause all the diabetics I know are on the verge of passing out at that range. As far as why her sugars go up with insulin, I am not sure, I have never heard of that before.<br>  <br>   So the only thing i can think of is getting more control over her sugars.|`|GeOMJN4Daa	I think there are different types of insulin. She may need to find the one that works best for her.|`|7oYpbSjIaa	insulin does not increase your blood sugar.  you really need to do some more research.|`|4sOjoi8Oaa	You don't say, but I am assuming she is Type 1?  If so, is she also taking a long acting insulin like Lantus?  Tell her to get to an endocrinologist if she isn't seeing one already.  She might be able to get on an insulin pump.  These can be expensive and some insurance companies like to balk and bluster over covering them, but if she is on MDI (multiple daily injections) and she can't get her Bg's into range then a pump could make a world of difference for her.  It did for my son.<br>  <br>  Also, I think it is great that you are so involved in your girlfriends disorder and that you are looking out for her.  You sound like a very caring guy.

RzilBdJdaa	3 pounds is way too much per week. To achieve that, you'd have to excersize 3-5 times a week and eat NO MORE THAN 647 calories...that is WAY TOO LITTLE, don't even try it. <br>  <br>  (what happens when you eat that little is your body goes into "starvation mode", and you loose nutrients. then, if you ever eat a little bit more, you actually end up GAINING weight. a vicious cycle...)<br>  <br>  BUT, if you want to loose 1 pound per week, with NO excersize, you shouldn't exceed 1162 calories, which is far more reasonable.

You should talk to them, everyone should love their son or daughter enough to understand them.<br>  <br>  Well, I would just go to the nurse if I were you. She should let you lay down in there to relax, and if it isn't working let your parents know and send you home.<br>  <br>  That would actually be a good thing, because then your parents will consider taking you somewhere to get looked at after the nurse tells them about it.|`|GHZts2BTaa	here is you real answer bud!<br>  your brain is filled with tons of nuerons and receptor sites and neurotransmiters. your brain is letting out to much of the chemical called (GABA) which puts your body on high alert! this is called the fight or flight system and thats why you felt like shouting! imagine if you came home,walked in the door and there stood a burgler? thats the feeling you get! right now i would say it is mild stress and anxiety but... if it goes untreated for to long it could turn into major anxiety and deppession! (not good) i would see a mental health professional befor it is to late and then you will suffer for only god knows how long? catch this befor it catches you! you are in control and have more control over this than you think! you will be ok! dnt be afraid just get help and dont be ashamed to do soo!<br>                                                good   luck!!|`|DUOoMBqoaa	It sounds like loud talking is triggering panic attacks. Honestly, this is too big a deal to try and figure out on Yahoo. You should try and find someone to talk to about this stuff. Maybe you have been traumatized , or you are too stressed, or noise is aggravating ADD or something? You can't live with your I-pod on.<br>  Maybe in the meantime you could try to secure some quiet time for yourself everyday, or pick up some books on meditation or other calming techniques.<br>  I would try to avoid medication if you can, that won't help in the long run.<br>  Good luck.

You might also consider making an appointment with a cardiologist.|`|P4eoWgcNaa	It sound to me like you should find a new doctor, perhaps you could get your thyroid checked, if you have not seen a specialist ,like an endocronologist maybe?   I went through a bad patch for 5 years, it turned out i had giant gall stones, graves disease and an over active thyroid, stomach problems, then i was getting serious dizziness and incredible vertigo. I was bounced from one doctor to another, they kept saying it was anxiety and depression and  in the end the only person to really help was a naturapath. Good luck!!  Do check that if you are taking medication  or natural medicines that they are not  interacting and causing  the rapid pulse or any other symptoms.

2sycPf8Daa	A zinc complex was recently developed to help restore functional elastin in photodamaged and aging skin. Until this discovery, there was no method to regenerate damaged elastin and restore resiliency to photoaged skin. <br>  Studies in the murine model demonstrated the ability of this zinc complex to increase epidermal thickness, augment hypodermal fat and tropoelastin mRNA as well as increase elastin content.<br>  <br>  Recommendations for future studies included studies to measure levels of fibulins, which may be a good marker of functional elastin. Tropoelastin is assembled into fibers through being guided onto a scaffolding by fibulins 4 and 5. The fibulins therefore have to come into contact with tropoelastin and form macro molecules in order to result in functional elastin.<br>   <br>  In general, the researchers agreed that it would be necessary to demonstrate more convincingly how the zinc formulation acts to increase elastin production.<br>  <br>  Can dietary supplements replace elastin in the human body? Not convincing tests have been yet found,but researchers are working hard to find a dietary supplements “replace” elastin.A zinc complex is the main topic so far.<br>  <br>  Take care as always!|`|jAmVRbICaa	I am not sure John but I would recommend taking an omega 3 fish oil supplement.

SVrXKm9Qaa	I got my wisdom teeth out in september. I get so worried before I go through dental procedures, and I seem to go through a lot... :/<br>  <br>  anyways, I was put to sleep (through an IV) and the last thing I said was "I feel dizzy", but I was happy, I remember smiling.<br>  I woke up, and I was put in a room where I slept it off a little. Gauze was in my mouth to catch the blood from going all over the place. I went home, slept, took the vicodin they perscribed me, and I was better. I went to Dairy Queen later that night. I keep telling everyone, I'd go through the whole surgery if I got to miss more school. I thought school was WAY WORSE than this surgery.<br>   <br>  The worst part was the holes left in your gums. It took about 3 months for the holes to fill up for me, and lots of times, food would get stuck in the holes, and that was annoying, but they fill up!<br>  <br>  some dentists (the dentists that remove your teeth) can have you come in before the appointment and they can go over stuff with you.|`|YgePQmjMaa	I had my braces on for three years.

Real food is a mixture of protein, carbs, and, depending on how healthy you eat, less fat, without the useless crap.

Muscle Milk won't help you lose weight, because it has even more calories and fat than Monster Milk. Adding calories to your existing diet will make you fatter, because it's more calories.

EHOE52Ieaa	don't pop them!!! i did that when my zits came to a head and now they turned all purple/dark red and its so icky! what i do (this might sting a bit) is i take a q-tip and run it under my boiling-water fountain for a few seconds, then sprinkle a bit of salt all over the wet end so it sticks. then i wait so it doesn't burn me, and gently stroke the dot/zit with it. on one, the skin broke so the salt stung pretty bad but it's not like its gonna kill you. the hot water opens up the pores and then the salt usually kills bacteria.
AA11020187	You’re asking if people should donate these things. It is a personal choice and there is no information on that. It comes from within. Giving blood is the easiest and most commonly needed. I’m a designated organ donor. I figure if one of my organs can save someone’s life why should I not give it to them? I wont be needing it anymore and there is no sense in letting it go to waste. You can donate your entire body if you want to. I wouldn’t give up a kidney for a stranger but I would for someone I love.|`|0lCnu1g2aa	How about some of all 3. You can donate blood multiple times in your life like every 6 weeks. You can donate some organs/tissues and still be alive such as bone marrow or  kidney. The problem is you would only have one kidney left and what happens if you start to have problems with the sole kidney? Basically your screwed.  Upon death a person can donate heart, lungs, liver, bone, kidneys, corneas, and even pancreas.  About the only thing I dont see being able to transplant is the brain!  Google organ transplant and read up on it, It is amazing what they can do.

o0JD0hitaa	There are a two major possible explanations.<br>  <br>  The first is that often massage leads us to a relaxed and meditative state. Some people see flashes of different colors when they meditate. Thus - it is the relaxed state of meditation that leads to some people seeing flashes of different colors when receiving a massage, even with the eyes closed.<br>  <br>  The other explanation is that changes in blood flow can affect brain chemistry. Of course, the same changes in brain chemistry can happen when meditation changes blood flow. The brain chemistry can influence what we hear, see, and feel.<br>  <br>  There is a degree of debate as to whether colors, visions, etc are simply brain chemistry or something beyond the physical realms of existence. I would suggest that both can be at play independently or at the same time.|`|827993b38a683884568367c98043c28caa	Shades of blue are sometimes seen by someone who has taken viagra.

l7GjBVvhaa	If you are going to start using tampons you need to practice inserting them when you are at your heaviest flow.<br>  <br>  Stick the applicator into your vagina angling to your mid back. Once you feel the tampon grip feel flush with your vaginal lips then push the tampon in by the long tube between your fingers. It will slide out with no worries.If the tampon is inserted correctly, you should not feel it. <br>  <br>  If you feel uncomfortable in any way, you may have inserted the tampon incorrectly or the tampon may not be placed far enough into the vagina. If this happens, just remove the tampon and start again with a new tampon. <br>  <br>  Only remove the tampon by the string when a little tug will release it with no pressure. If it is not ready to budge don't remove it of you will feel uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Remember that practice makes perfect. If you don't get it on the first try, your second try will most likely be successful. Instead of getting frustrated and giving up, relax and try again! <br>  <br>  If you don't succeed after several times, see your health care provider. It may be that you were born with a very small opening in your hymen and you can't insert tampons. This is true in only about 2% of teens, but it could be a problem.|`|pk9mwqYpaa	Emm don't hurt yourself use Gentle guide<br>  there at 99 cents store!|`|brSfRLspaa	you just need to calm down and realise you're being silly by being so frantic. of course it will hurt to pull it out if it's dry, it's like sandpaper, you need to leave it in till its saturated, and the tampon needs to go all the way to the back. Not putting it in far enough is the most common mistake. I know it's weird to see something disappear that far inside of you the first time, bu it really goes way back there. you're not going to hurt anything so just relax. vaginas are pretty tough.|`|6VL5xzlAaa	Use applicator ones and read the booklet they explain how far to push the applicator up and how to do that! though it will vary slightly i suppose, when it's in properly you can't feel it. Also if your removing them after a very short period of time it probably hurts because they are quite dry and the bottom is usually quite large, it's hard to explain but try putting one in properly and leaving it till it is time to take it out for you then see if it's less painful.<br>  And as for peoples advice not to use them, just wait till your ready and try again till you get there if you want to use them, I hated pads sooo much and they were too impractical for dance class in a tiny uniform and my friends were county swimmers so we all had similar problems trying to get used to them shorty after starting ours!|`|XkuR8ZJPaa	If a tampon is in correctly you should not be able to feel it.  If you can feel it and it is uncomfortable then you need to push it in some more.  It takes some time and practice.  If it hurts when you are pulling it out then it is probably too dry.  You need to use the lowest possible absorbency level for your flow that day and leave it in for a while before you change it.  You will learn the more you use them and know when to change them and what feels right.  It takes time just be patient.  Good luck.|`|upoH8NP4aa	push it in until it literally can not go in any farther. it cant nvr b in 2 far, the vagina just wont let it. and if it hurts to take it out, then obviously ur flow isnt heavy enough. If it's too dry, tampons reli absorb well, and if its too dry, it'll absorb all of the wetness you actually need in your vagina. just use a pad i guess. or just get used to it.|`|xPMYm3CYaa	Ok. On the tampons these days, theres the ridges that you're supposed to put your fingers on when you're inserting it. Holding that firmly, insert the applicator into your vagina untill your fingers are touching your outer lips, then push in the plunger to insert the tampon into your vagina. That should be your clue its in far enough. As for the pain, talk to your gyno. They can sometimes give you a cream that ups your vaginal hormone level to help with vaginal driness which is what you might be having if you're having the pain pulling it out. Also, it might be because the tampon is still dry, and the linning in there is very sensitive so it would irritate it.|`|KVNXMAPSaa	use tampons with applicators :) they are your friend.<br>  you could read the instructions that come with the tampons. orr you can just insert the applicator into your vagina until the tips of your fingers touch your vagina. then push the applicatior all the way, and pull out the applicator.<br>  iremember the first time i ever used a tampon. it was ssoo painful but it gets better i promise :) also, having another female who has used tampons for a while present to coach you through it helps ALOT!|`|iJH1N7Neaa	okay i have the same problem but what i do is i put my leg on the toilet and then  stick it in me but dont stick it striaght up you have to slant it a little.push the applicator up till you can only see the part where you push rhe tampon in.then push that and your tampon will be in. and about the part about pulling it out feeling like your pulling a knife out out of your vagina it happens to me to it just means its dry and by peeing on it  when you go to pull it out will make it moist and it should be less painfull.<br>  =]|`|pxepcCtRaa	Sweetie i had the same problem when i first started my period.<br>  all you have to do is push it in, stand up, and if you feel it at all then it is not all the way in.

c4cb310732bdbbcd88cc2b8cf1011b2caa	Losing 20lbs should not be to hard. What you need to do is first clean out your system of all the bad processed foods and chemicals. Do the cabbage soup diet for 7 days to clean out your system this alone can help you lose 10 lbs in only 7 days!     Then once you have completed that, eat healthy meals and exercise regular and aim to lose 1-2 lbs a week you will have the weight off in no time!!! This does work i do it every few weeks to clean out my system.    This website below has recipes for everyday of the diet including vegetable burgers and fries! and you still lose weight    Good luck :)    http://www.theeasycabbagesoupdiet.com|`|ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|xW6sZuTqaa	Try eating alot of chicken breast and high protein meals and try to avoid carbs, drink loads of water and go out jogging when you wake up, and go too the gym at least 3 times a week and do some cardio. Just keep in mind to eat 4-5 good meals a day and don't eat anything in between.|`|AA10700407	weight loss comes with diet and exercise.  walking and drinking water is a good start.  eat a well balanced diet with proper portions.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Buy a pedometer and set it to measure your steps.  The goal is to walk 10,000 steps per day.  You have a good start on this, so keep it up.  Use can use an IPOD or MP3 player to listen to music while you are walking.  Try swimming, bicycling, racquet ball,  some thing very physical to help lose the weight.  Change your eating habits to cut out some carbs, sugars and no junk food.  Eat more fruit and vegetables and lean meats.  Good Luck!|`|xKYXurpNaa	First of all, know that losing 20 pounds will most likely take around 10 weeks.    Walking is a good start but increasing the intensity of your exercise, i.e. walking up hills, jogging, steps etc. constantly is going to help your body constantly get fitter and lose the weight.    Adding some form of resistance training will help your body accelerate its calorie burning and a proper diet is a must.|`|AA11099963	Im loosing weight thru portion control and walking.

AA11434633	I believe the name you're looking for is Glucophage (Metformin).    This is a medication that might be prescribed by an endocrinologist.  It's used primarily in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but may also be prescribed for women suffering with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.    You can read about this particular medication at the site below.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	google says there is no such thing.

CLcGxHpAaa	This is so sad.  Your wife is self medicating with the alcohol, her mental health needs to be reevaluated.  Your anger is understandable, you are making sacrifices (your guitar) while she is only digging your family deeper into hell.  Do you want to make this work?  If so, you must convince your wife to seek alcohol treatment and quit self medicating. Next, you are going to have to learn to forgive her.    If your wife refuses alcohol treatment you must decide what is more important you and your children or a selfish adult who puts the bottle before her family.  Best Wishes|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Sit her down and have a heart to heart when she is sober.  If possible enlist the help of a family member whom she respects.  Let her know that this cannot go on.  She is ruining her life.  Being on meds and then drinking a bottle of whiskey ea day is doing her no good.  Meds will help but they can't if used w/alcohol to that extent.  Let her know that you will help her.  Attend AA meetings for families of alcoholics (they can help you to decide how you need to meet these challenges).  For the sake of your children, you need to make sure that things change for the better.  Even if you left her, you would still have to keep custody of the kids, as she wouldn't be able to take care of them until she learns to take care of herself.  She needs help and so do you in order to make things happen.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	Sounds like she is trying to self medicate to deal with everything the family has going on.  I would try to make the relationship work for the sake of the children.  But if she is not willing to change, it might be time to take a break.  Also, I would encourage her to seek treatment because it also sounds like she has a significant alcohol abuse problem.  You may want to do an intervention if she does not respond whereby you gather loved ones and a professional and talk about her drinking.  Good luck. BTW, it sounds like you're a good dad and I'm glad that you care about your kids so much!|`|w2oUA8zqaa	You can't make your wife do anything.  You have to do decide what your breaking point is & then do what is best for you & your children.  Consider AlAnon.|`|FrLDHBLfaa	It sounds as if you're extremely frustrated.  Does she understand that it's dangerous to mix alcohol with anti-psychotic medication?  She needs professional help, rehab.  It needs to happen soon, before she ends up killing herself; or doing irreparable damage to her body.    I hope things get better for you.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	You need a divorce.  If she's not willing to change, then you shouldn't have to put up with such a life.  Ask her to go to counselling.  If she won't, then a separation (better yet, a divorce) is the way to go.|`|a417f3a1484df0c086b8d9cee03596fbaa	The sad thing is that addicts are selfish, always thinking of what will make me feel better, what I need to function, me, me, me...;..at the family's and friend's expense.  She will not get help unless she wants it, and realizes her problem. In the meantime, it's what you can take.  You have one and only one life. You both took vows, and she is breaking them. It appears you have stood by, and even now at this point are searching for more help. How long you are willing to wait depends on you. But, consider your quality of life as well. If she is just not willing to commit to help for the benefit of your marriage and your child/children-you must decide if it's time to pick up your child/children and move on. It will be a hard road at first(I went through a divorce after waiting years for my husband to stop drinking as he kept promising), he also became bloated and repulsive and I couldn't stand for him to even touch me or I was disgusted. So, at 24 years old, I  finally picked up my 3 kids and went from housewife/stay at home mom-to single mom with 3 kids, working and running a home on my own. It was very hard at first, yet I suddenly felt like a load of worry was released from my shoulders and I was able to focus on my children and my own life. My ex has since went to AA, and still drinks. He is great when sober, which unfortunately is very rarely, and he's a nightmare and mean when drunk. He rarely pays 1/2 a child support payment a month, but can afford alchohol/cases of beer. My kids now are old enough to realize his addiction. I hope they learn from it, and I hope they have learned strength and not to take abuse and addiction when they are adults either. Coincidentally, I have a 14 year old son with mental/behavioral problems and suspect Asperger's. I had him assessed at a hospital that recommended partial hospitalization last week and am trying to figure out my next steps with him. I'm suspecting a recent increase in issues could also be a medication change 3 months ago. I know things get really hard financially and emotionally just with that issue, to add a non supportive/addictive partner would be too much for me to handle as well. I hope it all works out for you.|`|qsAeKfaAaa	If your wife cannot change then divorce her. I sure that the courts will let you have full custody of your children. Your wife needs to be in a loon bin as soon as possible.
MYqu4bDNaa	absolutely normal|`|a48b8f799e030a044da781ffac6f94cdaa	That would be normal for some people while others may only go once or twice a week.

The main thing to be wary off is a change in what is normal for you, if you usually only go once a day and now it is twice it needs to be investigated and that also applies the other way, if you are not going as often as normal get that checked out as well|`|3d3JW4Wuaa	Yeah if yer full of it! xD|`|nSa4CPRiaa	yes everyone has differant bowel habits some twice a day some twice a week.|`|NkenKT7yaa	Everyone is different.My wife goes three times a week.My daughter and I go twice a day.Nothing to worry about.|`|IiiowjP8aa	a normal healthy person should have 2-3 bowel movments per day, usually 15 - 30 minnutes after a meal, allthough your metabolism and enzyme status all have an influence on this|`|ugsfuQQcaa	Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't.

hsEo77F9aa	Depends on the particular infection they are worried about.  There is not one particular type of treatment that can help to prevent infection of all pathogens. Some of the treatments are pills, some are the actual vaccines, some are immunoglobulins that are introduced through an IV (immunoglobulins (Ig) are antibodies produced when someone fights an infection.....having antibodies introduced early can help to prevent a systemic infection from occurring    A few specific examples:    In the case of HIV: a person can be put on the anti-HIV medicines immediately (within 72 hours of exposure) and take them for 28 days. This will help to prevent infection from occurring. Some studies have shown up to an 80% reduction. This post-exposure prophylaxis should only be used when there is a significant and higher risk exposure. The medicines can be toxic and dangerous and should be used judiciously.    In the case of Hep A: the Hep A vaccine is sometimes used in a post-exposure scenario up to 1 week after being exposed.    In the case of Hep B: Every child born to a HepB+ woman is (or should be) given a dose of the HBV vaccine and the administration of Hep B Ig. In the case of an exposed worker there are a variety of treatments depending on several factors including any prior vaccine exposure.    In the case of Ebola: there is a vaccine that has shown promise but it must be administered within 1-4 days of exposure. And the use of convalescent plasma (blood plasma from a person who successfully fought off their infection and who are getting better) has also shown promise.     Bottom line: most of these "post-exposure prophylaxis" treatments are highly specific to the disease. Some work better than others. For some infections, there are no known interventions that can help after someone has been exposed.

ufgv7oTjaa	The only major warnings are not to use it if you're pregnant/nursing, but http://www.drugs.com/npp/chaste-tree.htm... has a list of a few minor side effects. It says "Minor side effects include GI reactions, itching, rash, headache, fatigue, alopecia, acne, and increased menstrual flow" (although from the reactions I've seen, these are more rare).   Based on what you said, it's possible you just happened to get sick shortly after taking the Vitex (aka Chasteberry or Agnus Castus). If you wanted to verify that, you could stop taking the Vitex until a week or so after you feel better (just to make sure whatever it is is gone) and start taking it again... if the same symptoms come back up, then you know it's the Vitex and might be an allergic reaction.    Another thing to point out is that there are a lot of drugs that interact with a lot of supplements, so the general rule of thumb before starting any new supplement or drug is to check with a doctor or pharmacist to make sure they wouldn't interact with what you're currently taking. Both doctors and pharmacists have access to a database of drug and supplement interactions, so both can look even if they've never heard of it. Good luck!
UEOldaPZaa	A child should first see the dentist when the first teeth erupt (come into the mouth) or by age 1.    There are several reasons for this.  First, as teeth are in the mouth, they can develop cavities.    Second, it gives an opportuntiy for the dentist to educate the parent on the proper care of children's teeth.  Many parent do no know that young children should be using children's toothpaste.  This does not contain fluoride.  Fluoride, when swallowed, can cause developmental problems with the adult teeth.  In addition, children should not be sleeping with a bottle containing milk.  When the child is sleeping, the teeth is constantly bathed in mild which contains sugar.  This can cause rapid decay of their teeth.  This is know as baby bottle decay.  You can find out more information about children's dental care at:  http://www.bcdentalcare.ca|`|nyF4GRTvaa	Hi- I work for a health video website called icyou.com which has thousands of videos on all sorts of different health topics.

RcAofGkIaa	An Emergency Room is set up to treat emergencies, they'll patch you up and get you away from life threatening situations.  For an on-going problem like yours, you need to go to a doctor in a situation where you can stay with that doctor.  Make an appointment with a GP, have the hospital send your records to the doctor, then you can begin the process of testing and elimination to get to the root of the problem.  You need a doc you have a long-term relationship with and who will see you more than once to make a good diagnosis.  sorry for your illness, and gl.  Edit: I read your additional comment, and again, I'm so sorry.  This is not going to be easy, this is going to be a slog.  You're in the position of having to persevere...go back to the doctor every time something doesn't work.  And usually I don't think looking on line is a great idea, but in your case if you did some searches on your symptoms so you can ask your doc some good questions, it wouldn't hurt.  I know people who have struggled for a long time before they got a diagnosis and treatment that helped them.  Keep a record of when your symptoms are the worst, keep a record of what you eat, see if you can draw a conclusion.  You're going to have to be a warrior for your own health.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	not all allergies are caused you eating something.  it could be your laundry detergent, it could be grass stains on your clothes, it could be a cat or a dog.  its could be ANYTHING. which would explain why your tongue keeps swelling up and your tired all the time.  being allergic to something means that your body is fighting whatever alien thing your being exposed to. i would have an allergy test done, and start taking some raw honey every day in your tea...your body's natural  immunity will build up that way.|`|32bf6cc091942a6c4cc7b3f575927ebcaa	I hate to say it, but I think you should get tested for HIV.|`|ymdPniDYaa	Did you recently start using a new laundry detergent, dish soap, body wash, hand soap, hairspray, shampoo, face wash....

If you had systematic candisis, then that will make you very sensitive to things, like chemicals, allergens etc...  So, it's real possible that you are allergic to something.  Maybe try and find a D.O., which stands for Doctor of Osteopathy. They tend to use more alternative medicine as well as traditional medicine.   If you're having a hard time finding one in your area, try going to a health food/ vitamin store, sometimes they know of doctors and therapists that you can see!

aiBOMU9kaa	I think 350 or 400 ML is as large as they come.     The idea behind that I suppose is to ensure that it stays fresh right to the end. With bottles too large, the last third of it may be past it's prime before you use it.    But, have you thought of buying 2 bottles when you go ?...then buy another bottle when you have used about 1/3 of your second one . You will never be caught short that way.
wdNfee9Baa	at 5'6 120 pounds it seems a lil impossible to have a waist of 39 inches with hips of 35 unless you are pregnant???  unless that is a typo your waist should be about 29 inches! haha  other than that you are at a good proportion because the most healthy measurements you can have are 36 bust, 28 waist, 36 hips.      If you feel like you need to work out simply cardio will tone all areas.  Try running for 30mins a day or swimming for 60 mins every other day. In just a week you will begin to see a major difference and also feel better :)  Also your 18 enjoy your youthful body while you can because in 2 more years you will have to work out to keep that body!|`|7VfWz7zyaa	I feel like that too. im not big.. or big big.. but sometimes i think my thighs are too big,.   :s. im sure we're fine.

I also now joined a gym and exercise about 4 times a week. What they said about your boyfriend is very true. After my ex and I broke up, thats when I lost the weight. I became very depressed and couldn't eat. I actually gained some weight back but I'm just trying to maintain it now. Just remember small protions. Stop when you are full and don't over eat. Eat fruit, an apple or berries are good for you for dessert. A handful of nuts are also a good snack. I usually like to eat wheat bread. I still stick with this and got results without feeling deprived.|`|U6C4Bywwaa	summer is 4 months away, so it can be done, but you will have to work....hard!  Start by drinking 80 oz of water each day. Dr's suggest drinking half your body weight in water when trying to lose weight. Change the way you eat and what you eat. Eat breakfast every single morning. Try to make sure it includes protein. So like 2 eggs and some fruit and a glass of fat free milk is like a perfect breakfast. Have a snack of fruit or veggie between breakfast and lunch. For lunch have some type of protein and lots of veggies. Same for dinner. Any bread, rice, or pasta eaten should be whole grain and it also should be eaten at Breakfast or Lunch. Try to stay away from carbs late at night. Dont drink any soda and dont eat and fried or fast food. Chew gum if you have cravings. Alos, you have to exercise. If you can, go jogging for like 30-45 mins 5 x per week. If its cold where you live, sign up for a gym membership or a local fitness center. Good luck!?|`|ugsfuQQcaa	Well, if you plan on losing that much weight that soon, you will need to really be serious about taking your health and fitness seriously.  First you need to make sure you drink plenty of water.  Let go of the sodas and sugary stuff.  Water is the best.  Also, when it comes to eating, portions are the big thing.  Eat 3-4 small meals a day making sure you get plenty of whole grains, veggies and fruit.  Do not load up on foods that are high in calories, fat, or sodium.  Watch the portion size.  Start leaving the junk food and not healthy stuff in the dust.  You don't have to live on carrots and celery, but watch what and how much you eat.  Finally, make sure you get plenty of activity everyday.  Walk, run, work out in the gym, something for an hour a day.|`|gvWLgYx4aa	if you want to do it in the healthiest way possible you have to eat. eating is not bad. you just need to make sure that what you do it is good for you. stay away from fast food. even if its a salad, it can still be bad depending on the dressing you put on it. stay away from anything fried. stick to grilled. drink lots and lots of water. NO SODA! try to eat small portions, and if you feel hungry eat something! it's a lot worse to stay hungry. staying hungry will slow down your metabolism and when you finally do eat you'll end up storing more fat. eat whenever you feel hungry but just make sure it is healthy and not too big. and finally the most important part of all is that you must exercise!

Cardiovascular exercises help build your heart, endurance, and burns calories. Try lifting weights in combination of resistance training 3 times a week. Make sure you skip a day or two before each session to allow your muscles to heal. The days you don't do this you do your cardiovascular exercises such as running on treadmill or outdoors, or using the elliptical machine, or stationary and outdoor bike.
WrDGhduxaa	The blood flow in and out of the penis happens without sexual stimulation. It is not unusual.|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	I find it odd that you measure yourself doing various activities like that...

Ef4rGLGvaa	Do you have any pets or pests? Mold? What I'm getting at: It could be allergies.    Or maybe you guys use too many hand sanitizers? Or anything anti-bacterial? Because that weakens the immune system. If you're always cleaning things and sanitizing, killing every single germ all the time, you are damaging the way your body works naturally. It needs to come in contact with germs, so that it knows how to fight them.|`|tJeS4SZCaa	uh yeah, i have had that problem, you might want to check for Mold in the walls,|`|7vk4xoKZaa	Is your house older or anything? Could be mold problems. I stayed in an older home for about 6 months and never felt good. Definitely try cleaning the air ducts and filters. But check for mold problems.|`|KXcEgGUlaa	it could be the air in the house, so yes clean the ducts. also, it is cold season as everyone here is pretty sick.. maybe they are allergic to dust... if the allergies dont go away, they need to get tested and have allergy shots|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Yes it will - sounds like he has a dust mite allergy.    Clean the vents, replace the air filter in the furnace. Place filters in the vents (you can buy them at Home Depot).    Wash the bedding in hot water. Replace pillows with new hypoallergenic type.    Cover the mattress with a hypoallergenic cover.    And see an allergist, shots may be in order to desensitize him.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Mold can cause these symptoms, also the drier air of winter w/heating systems.  Have your ducts checked and basement, closets, etc. for mold.  If none is found, try a humidifier esp. helpful in bedrooms.  Just make sure you clean it according to directions, because mold can develop in humidifiers if not properly maintained.|`|15jfF0tKaa	I had a son that kept getting this and I used to get after him because he did not dress right or get his sleep. He used to run out the door in a hoodie only if that, and he just would not wear a winter coat or hat. He was with friends partying and camping. Also he would not sleep 8 hours. keep that up and your immune system goes down.  I suggest watching those things and making smoothies with fruit and yougurt.|`|TsE5XhXoaa	s

Then apply again in the morning and so on until they're gone.  If you suffer regular breakouts, then wash your face day and night with a tea tree facial wash - you can pick these up quite cheaply in Boots, Superdrug, Supermarket etc.  I don't know about vinegar helping, although it is an astringent.|`|AA11259647	Washing your face in the morning with special face-wash and using toner and moisturiser afterwards really helps miracles. Simple is a good brand. (I don't know if you do that already). If you don't only have a few spots but have acne it's good to see a doctor as they can prescribe medication. Also drink lots of water and avoid sweets and fatty foods. I used to have lots of spots so I know how frustrating it is! Best of luck x

e8yt5PrGaa	make sure the razor is clean ..and apply hydro cortisone to youre face before the shave and after the shave ,|`|UbQyyWtuaa	Try vaseline, aloe vera, cocoa butter.|`|wLnJDf7naa	I suggest get a new razor. The one you are currently using may be dull.|`|ZqhaMRFqaa	use shaving cream    put ice pack on the burns|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	I use a rotary blade Norelco Electric Shaver.  Since the blades move around in circles, instructions say to move the razor in circles, also, as you shave to get a good, close shave.  As an added point, I apply rubbing alcohol to my face & let it dry PRIOR to shaving.  That makes the whiskers stand up straighter to get a good, close shave.  Use a good quality Men's aftershave skin conlditioning cream.  You can also rub Vitamin E Oil into the skin AFTER you shave to help heal the burn. I can't figure out why you're getting razor burn w/electric razor, though.  Either you are baring down too hard or making too many passes over one area or the blades are dull.|`|IM3QwSS2aa	the next time: apply some Undiluted Essential Oil of Lavender to the shaved areas.  Trust me, Jerime, black male has had his share of razor bumps and tried everything until Lavender - put the others to shame.    /Jerome|`|KSKtr3DKaa	no|`|9eouWphjaa	Try a different razor and use high grade shaving cream|`|LcLGnTVMaa	This helped me:  Shave while you are in the shower, near the end of your shower when your skin is softer.  Always use a new razor.  Do it daily.    Alternative- depending on your personal appearence requirements for work, ect.  Sometimes I will use an electric hair clipper to shave with. It leaves stubble, but no razor burn.
7GxZTxMbaa	You either have a high blood pressure, or have Sugar Diabetes, or just high blood Sugar.. You need to get your blood work done! I had it, but it was just high blood pressure, It would happen when i got sad, or upset, my noise would run, and it would bleed, from getting mad, ECT..<br>  <br>  Well when it happens.. Tilt you head back, and plug your noise with you fingers....        Please get blood work done!|`|2tzn6Ad9aa	Thats what happened to my younger brother a lot lol he kept a bottle of rubbing alcohol nearby because if you smell it or like rub it against your nose it stops.

Just don't overdue what the boxes say or you can scrape off too much of your enamel and it will discolor your teeth.|`|jIccV2sOaa	You do not want super white teeth.   Healthy teeth are  a cream colour.  White teeth are produced by a severe oxidation process called bleaching. It does not matter what chemical is used to do the bleaching, oxidation is always the result.   If you study virtually all non-mineral materials you will find that oxidation breaks them down.  But then...do you care, as long as you look in fashion NOW.|`|uz3WIqV3aa	and about the 600 dollar thingy i watched a documentary that said the process could like damage your brain and stuff
E80A9WSXaa	Hm well maybe you could try eating a bit more balanced meals and getting all your daily nutrients in. Dont get me wrong, you're lunch sounds AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!! but it wont sustain you for long.<br>  You can go to <a href="http://mypyramid.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://mypyramid.gov/</a> to check out some great tips.<br>  <br>  Here's what I eat in a day, just to give you a rough idea (I'm seeing a nutritionalist and trying to gain as well)<br>  <br>  Breakfast:<br>  3 Cups Cereal<br>  2 Cups Milk<br>  1 Yoplait Yogurt<br>  <br>  Lunch:<br>  1 Sandwitch with:<br>     2 Slices Whole Wheat Bread<br>     Lettuce<br>     AVOCADO (very important in maintaining a healthy heart!)<br>     Turkey Breast Meat<br>      Mustard (a personal favorite)<br>  1 Piece of Fruit (banana, apple or pear)<br>  1 Yoplait Yogurt<br>  <br>  Snack:<br>  1 Balance Bar<br>  OR<br>  Some nuts (almonds, peanuts, walnuts etc)<br>  OR<br>  1 Yoplait Yogurt (we have a lot of them)<br>  <br>  Dinner:<br>  It varies from night to night so it just depends on whats available.

If you gain any it shouldn't  be too much. Just the milkshake would probably tip you over two thousand calories, but the ballet class should have made up for that. My sisters been trying to gain weight, and she did ballet, how weird, but she eats a lot before she goes to sleep and it helps.|`|SR04mlQQaa	Eat at McDonalds more. That definitely isn't enough food.

You also need to take in proteins as well. Your lunch wasn't enough. How did you last through school and ballet with just 3 marshmallows and a milkshake in your system?! The normal calorie intake for a day should be somewhere around 2,000 and I don't know how much this was but I don't think its enough to gain any weight.|`|BSU9pNUWaa	No. your burning off most of those calories. You actually have a very healthy diet and I'm confused as to why you want to put weight on. It's important to stay healthy when putting weight on. Don't change what your eating since you seem to have a healthy diet, just more of it, and DON'T stop working out. Try doing some weight training. Putting some muscle on will help you gain weight on the scale but not on appearance.|`|EZ1cPPvkaa	One pound is equal to something like 3,000 calories, and that is definitely not 3,000 calories.  I would be surpised if that is even over 1,000.  Considering you probably burn much more than that a day, especially considering your workout, I don't think it's likely that you've gained any weight.  A good idea would be to see how many calories you personally burn a day, there's a lot of places online that will calculate it for you.  The site I use is Calorie Count Plus, the link is in the sources page.  It's really great for adding up your calorie intake as well.|`|f1GlFNxJaa	Well I am Not an Expert But It depends what you eat.<br>  Try not to eat a bunch of junk. It might Affect your heath.  But eat Stuff that you ate when you were a kid. When you were a kid you didn't care about Fiber or Calories if you really want to gain weight. But if you go over bord and weigh More than you want i suggest Special K Diet Cereal for Weight Loss. So don't eat stuff that will hurt your body like Mc Donald's Every day. <br>  I hope this info was helpful!!!|`|K7n0DY8Faa	OMG That is soo not enough. If you want to gain weight, you gotta eat more than that. And some are unhealthy too. Try 2 cups of rice a day (Just eat something with lots of calories in it).

UQLNP6iyaa	I also think a check-up is wise, but it sounds like you could either have a mild infection or kidney stones. for the former, try drinking the purest Cranberry juice (as opposed to cranberry cocktail which is mostly apple juice) you can find for a few days. If the symptoms disappear, that's it. If it's kidney stones, 24 oz of water is about a third of what you would need to ward them off. Since my kidney stone experience, I drink 72 to 96 oz of water per day and, knock on wood, so far so good.<br>  <br>  Good luck Sir!|`|7jNYqtWOaa	The pain could be a number of things but most likely something to do with your internal organs.  Have you had your kidneys examined?  If you have a kidney infection your kidneys would be sore to the touch if you tapped your skin along the lower back in the flank.<br>  <br>  Severe pain is not normal.  Please get yourself checked out.  Oftentimes a urine sample would help

It is a great thing to do and you could save someone's life. If not now, maybe when you are older. Ask your mom and the Red Cross for information. You don't neccessarily have to be a relative - you just need to be a match for someone who needs the transplant. Many factors would be looked at for compatibility, and you could save a stranger's life.|`|WWVz3Jqvaa	No. bone marrow can only be transferred by relatives with similar genes as you (parents don't count)|`|BuhZWTiqaa	you would need parental permission but otherwise yes but it is an extremly painful procedure

High heels jack the back of your foot way up, and in addition to providing little support, contribute to a shortening in your calf region and Achilles tendon. This is bad news if you already suffer from plantar fasciitis, and will increase the odds of acquiring it immensely if you don’t.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of foot exersices that you can do to maybe help.As far as the marks i cant imagine what they are and how to get rid of them.Try to put coca butter on them.Its good for anything from scars to stretch marks.<br>  I would stop wearing high heels complety until all your symptoms go away since it can cause major problems with your feet.For now try to buy comfortable shoes.good luck hun!

I have horrible scars all over my bad and I have the same exact problem that you have and I called around even looked for lotions that would help but It seems that the only solution would be to see a special dermatologist, I'll warn you it's not cheap but they're basically remove the scars with a lazer treatment.

But, teens normally have some strong interest in something- music, horses, cats, boys. <br>  <br>  If you just REALLY love them, but can function without petting one constantly, I would take that interest to your nearest animal shelter or vetrinarian office and volunteer.

I used to weigh 198 lbs and my height is only 5'8" - for my height and with that kind of weight I'm really obese!  I tried the "Master clense" and other diet recipes, and I even watched Richard Simmons videos but they didn't helped me at all!<br>  <br>  I tried going to a gym with a strict diet once and within a week later, I stopped going to gym and started eating more than before.  It brought me back to where I started again.  I am sure you happen to experience it like me.<br>  <br>  One day, I was watching CNN news and they interviewed this hypotherapist guy, his name is Steve.  I myself do not believe in hypnotherapy but the hypnotherapist was rather convincing so I visited his site (<a href="http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)</a> and he has a "Weight Loss Powerpack".  I bought the part 2 "Weight Loss Powerpack 2" which consist of Weight Loss, Stop Binge Eating and I Love To Exercise.  It is more affordable than a month of subscription to the gym and having those strict diets.<br>  <br>  The first few days I realized my eating dropped significantly and my weight dropped a little.  A week later, I begin to feel motivated to exercise and such!  His hypnotherapy works!  It has been a month already since I bought his program and I already lost 18.3 lbs!  I recommend you give it a shot!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/</a>
StJGeiFyaa	yes absolutely on all counts. you can talk to her about it and she probably has free samples to give you to try out. although she is a doctor, remember that she isn't a psychiatrist and doesn't know all that much about the medication and dosages in the head department, so maybe she can refer to to a specialist. good luck :)|`|J1kJb98Maa	basically you want to know if you can score some xananx off your ob/gyn..<br>  sure you can!|`|28TJbbNHaa	If you find it easier to talk to a female doctor then go ahead.

uC75y83Taa	It's very possible that you have dry eyes.  See an optometrist to see if I'm right.  I have SUPER dry eyes, and have to take drops during the day and ointment at night.<br>  Have you tried the eye drops for red eyes? I think Murine makes them.  You should try them, and if they help, stick with them!<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to see an optometrist and get your eyes checked out.<br>  You only have one set of eyes, and there are many eye diseases, like glaucoma, which causes blindness.  I really think you should make sure your eyes are healthy. Any optometrist will do the same tests.

I went to to the ENT and he said I was causing my ear infections by cleaning my ears with Q-Tips. It was irritating the inside of my ear and pushing bacteria back. That might be something to consider.|`|HWI4DIt4aa	Do you hear your heartbeat or any noises in your ears?  Is the pain and/or noise in one or both ears?
ZbMLigR3aa	Hon, just try to relax.  It does work and if you've taken it in the proper time frame you really have nothing to worry about.  The symptoms (or after effects) really vary from woman to woman, so it would be difficult to predict exactly how it will affect you.  That said, if you find yourself having any extreme pain or bleeding, please make an appointment to see your gynecologist immediately.  You should be okay though.  Good luck!|`|VhE4KWhOaa	yes it usually works as long as u didn't wait too long after sex to take it. just make sure you take the other one on time!!!! when i took it i had no side effects but i guess everyone is different.

E80A9WSXaa	Seriously? Well sorry i have only natural remedies, but i swear they work like magic if you're willing to try.<br>  <br>  First off, make sure you get at least NINE HOURS of sleep every night you're studying and at least two days before the exam. I know it can be really hard when you have lots of things to do, and when you can seem to keep your mind from wandering, but if you can it truly helps to improve your concentration.<br>  <br>  Secondly, be around a smell, a certain cologne or perfume that you like, while you're studying. Strangely enough, we link smells with certain details that we remember when smelling the specific scent, so whatever you're studying, you'll have a good chance of remembering it WITH the smell you study with. It has to do with the brain and where memory is stored. and it works for me!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and<br>  Good luck with your exams!|`|MPOHHTtAaa	Heck no, you will get super jittery, too jittery to concentrate and then you will crash and burn, I used to take No doze all the time (caffeine pills) and they never did me any good, sorry though.|`|mqXyDTwwaa	Take DMAE (Dimethylaminoethanol) instead. You can get it at GNC.|`|8SRjELNBaa	It just raises your stress levels to keep your body alert.

E80A9WSXaa	well protein in itself is pretty much the same, but getting it from fish vs. nuts can have different health benefits. For example, fish has a really good source of OMEGA-3s and nuts tend to have heart healthy oils. Different foods have different nutrients and different health benefits, but there's generally only one kind of protein.|`|FaVYRoXqaa	Protein is made up of amino acids.  It is the amino acids that are different in food sources.  If you have a healthy diet that has a lot of variety, you won't have any problem getting all the amino acids you need (there are 20 in all, 8 of which are essential).|`|IGYa2yF6aa	Yes, there are over 390 known amino acids though only 20 are found in the human body. Every food containing protein has a different sequence of amino acids. And each amino acid is synthesized in the body differently and each affects the body differently. <br>  <br>  Protein absolutely matters to your health and well being. It's needed  to build up, keep up, and replace the tissues in your body. Your muscles, your organs, and some of your hormones are made up mostly of protein. And protein also makes antibodies and hemoglobin which delivers oxygen to your blood cells.<br>  <br>  The only way protein can help you gain weight is to help you gain muscle mass (muscles are primarily formed from protein). But you would have to do weight-bearing exercises to make that happen. You can't just eat protein and expect to grow muscle tissue. <br>  <br>  It's a big subject area. Hope  that helps to get you started.|`|bwQKQY8gaa	no friend i don't think so because though there are different vitamins but proteins are same in all sources.
AA12316174	It depends on how much time is taken to examine you <br>  how many issues you may have, <br>  how manyquestions and concerns you may have. <br>  How extensive your past medical history is  <br>  what time of birth control you may want (due to the DR having to  think which pill is best for you example)|`|BIyiOgPYaa	When i went to planned parenthood I never had to get an exam to get birth control.

I do it a lot, sometimes when I'm half awake/half asleep but dreaming, and in the dream I'd trip or slip and then react consciously like with the spasm.<br>  <br>  I assume it's just some sort of confusion with the brain, when it's aware of both your conscious mind and subconscious, but that's just a guess.|`|B66JN4NRaa	hmm i think the same thing happens to me sometimes like ill be about to fall asleep and will move slightly but it feels like im about to fall off my bead but im not close to the edge at all, dont let it bother you it rarley happens to be and its like for a split second so it barley registers in my brain and i move on falling asleep :P dont fret|`|ZeaSKrW6aa	Do you kind of just.. jump?

ehq6W1mtaa	I'm not entirely sure of the side-effects of Cymbolta (and yes I do know that you have not taken them yet) but you should be aware that if it is an anti-depressant than your thoughts of lonliness will increase when your body first intakes it. I believe that if you truely want to begin feeling less lonely you should do what makes you happy. When you do what makes you happy other people will want to be just as happy as you and you'll end up making friends while being happy at the same time. Kittens and a dog can make you feel a little bit less lonely but they are no substitute for human beings. You're doing the right thing by trying to help yourself and that's the first step so now all you have to do is step out of your door and introduce yourself to some people that you think you might want to be friends with. If you want/need to talk to me you can. :) Hope it helps!|`|AA12152076	You could try getting involved in a local church.  Many of them are filled with warm people and an abundance of activities and welcome newcomers (and if you find one that isn't, just try another one).

I just said a little prayer that you would find peace and joy.|`|YwYxff87aa	All I can say is many people I've seen are happy and they are diseased and ill. So don't blame this on your sickness.

mqXyDTwwaa	Avoid stress.|`|E80A9WSXaa	Well you can avoid stress by doing something active like running, swimming (cardio workouts) or you can try doing workouts like doing crunches and push ups. <br>  <br>  Something I find highly effective is Yoga. It can be expensive so you can check out <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.yogajournal.com/</a> to find videos and guides to help you with stretches.<br>  <br>  The other way to avoid gaining unnecessary weight, is to eat healthy. Whenever you feel stressed, dip into the fruit bowl. Fruit will not cause you to gain weight so don't have to worry about eating too much. Even peaches are good for you, and especially delicious when you have a candy craving!!<br>  <br>  It may be hard at first but, dont give up!! It will get easier after the first week--I promise :)<br>  <br>  Feel free to message or email me if you have questions<br>  <br>  Good luck!!
wDtA9hrhaa	no for one whole day this isnt too much. You did everything right (you had many Small meals). Instead of 3 HUGE ones.

wJdCXU27aa	You go!!! I am on slimquick and have had really good results. I have lost 32 lbs in 3 months and 1 week. I have to tell you I am thrilled with the results. I work out 5 times a week ( walking with hand weights, swimming and biking) I am following their online diet also (with some alterations)  I found as I am losing weight I am able to walk faster and with more comfort. If you don't mind the water swimming is the best. It  doesn't hurt your joints and you burn a ton of calories. I found the slimquick has given me alot of energy and very few side effects. I have really cut my caffeine intake because I was getting jittery during the day. That hasn't been a big deal because I still am energized and feel like doing stuff without the caffeine boost. I have about 15 lbs to go. I am determined to do it right this time (I am 38 years old) I want to be healthy and live life. I wish you luck-I know it isn't easy-keep going and keep your chin up!
tkRR4K8haa	I am wearing braces and elastics right now, and I talk just fine. Normally your orthadontist will tell you that you should take them out when you are either eating or brushing your teeth (obviously).

I used to weigh 198 lbs and my height is only 5'8" - for my height and with that kind of weight I'm really obese!  I tried the "Master clense" and other diet recipes, and I even watched Richard Simmons videos but they didn't helped me at all!<br>  <br>  I tried going to a gym with a strict diet once and within a week later, I stopped going to gym and started eating more than before.  It brought me back to where I started again.  I am sure you happen to experience it like me.<br>  <br>  One day, I was watching CNN news and they interviewed this hypotherapist guy, his name is Steve.  I myself do not believe in hypnotherapy but the hypnotherapist was rather convincing so I visited his site (<a href="http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)</a> and he has a "Weight Loss Powerpack".  I bought the part 2 "Weight Loss Powerpack 2" which consist of Weight Loss, Stop Binge Eating and I Love To Exercise.  It is more affordable than a month of subscription to the gym and having those strict diets.<br>  <br>  The first few days I realized my eating dropped significantly and my weight dropped a little.  A week later, I begin to feel motivated to exercise and such!  His hypnotherapy works!  It has been a month already since I bought his program and I already lost 18.3 lbs!  I recommend you give it a shot!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/</a>|`|ZwmQdZLZaa	Don't take ANY of those weight loss products, they are absolute bull, and do not give you PERMANENT weight loss, which is what you are looking for. In your case, honestly what you need is the right diet and workout, AND I'm going to tell you how, so don't flame me.<br>  <br>  For the diet, you need to completely restructure your diet from the norm. First of all, you need to eat five small meals a day instead of three larger meals if possible. Giving your stomach something to digest constantly keeps your metabolism up, meaning that you burn more calories. Try to snack on something light, preferably vegetables in between meals. Vegetables should also form the bulk of your diet. Remember what you learned in elementary school, that bread, grains, and pastas were the base of the food pyramid? That's outdated. Vegetables and fruits are the most important part now, as they give you plenty of essential minerals/vitamins, almost no calories, and fiber. Do not eat junk food/sweets or drink soda/commercial drinks if you can help it. They simply contain too much excess sugar and industrial chemicals. Cut back on red meat, as red meat contains more fat than any other type of meat. Try sticking with chicken and fish, as they provide better sources of protein and calories. <br>  <br>  Your workout is lame, no offense. Walking is nothing, you need to run a mile everyday at the very least (jog). Step it up every week until you can do at least two or three miles everyday or every other day. Do moderate to heavy weight training, and moderate to intense cardio. Martial arts is a particularly excellent way to burn calories (averaging 700 an hour). Shoveling snow also burns almost as much calories, so be sure to charge your parents every time it snows. Losing weight is based on the same principle as gaining weight. If you take in an extra 50 calories every day for a year, you'll gain plenty, but if you spend an extra 50 calories every day for a year, you'll lose plenty.

516fea4a62574639588ea5fd3d750ccfaa	The THC is stored in the users fat cells and is gradually released from there, that's how tests detect the presence of marijuana in your system. So it really depends on your weight. If you are fairly athletic and have a high metabolism, then there is no place for the THC to store itself and flushes out rather quickly. Someone who has been smoking for a long time would have to not smoke marijuana for a longer period as the THC will have built up in higher concentrations and even then the user can accelerate the speed in which they "clean up" by drinking lots of diuretic fluids.<br>  First time smoking, it would probably be undetectable after a week.|`|S5ZYHiFaaa	same as a person whose been smoking for fifty years. it will stay in for about three weeks, give or take a week depending on the amount of body fat that you have.

AtjlmByAaa	Hi, basically ideal weight is identified depending on height at body frame.<br>  For female with 5'6" height:<br>  Body Frame : Small  - around 117lbs.<br>                         Medium  - around 130lbs<br>                         Large  - around 143lbs
8yE2sYGeaa	You have something beyond sinus problems, as the fluid build-up is a real concern
xav4i5zkaa	I dont mean to scare you but basically an abscess is an infection, alot of people dont realize how close the sinus's are. If the absess stays there, it could go into his sinus's and even travel from there. Im not saying i see that very often, but at the same time its good to know all the facts.<br>  <br>  If i were you i would have the tooth extracted, you might as well not run the risk of developing any further problems, and hey toothless kids are cute :)<br>  <br>  good luck!
mqXyDTwwaa	Don't think about how much you can lose in a few months, because whatever you lose in a few months you'll gain back if you go back to your old habits. The only way I keep my weight down is I've accepted the fact that I have to eat right and exercise every day for the rest of my life.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Dude, you can lose SOOOOOO much weight by just eating healthier meals and walking around the block.  Your 20, your starting the physically peak of adolescence, the only thing that's holding you back is extra weight.<br>  <br>  Caculate your BMR.  That's how many calories you'd burn sitting on your *** all day.  If you eat fewer than that number, it's just calories burned.  Combine that with a healthy diet of fruits, vegetables and nuts... with some exercise and you'll shred A TON of pounds.|`|vEXE2XE7aa	bruh im 22.i felt the same way you do.2 months ago i weighed 282 pounds,now i weigh 255.i lost 27 pounds.due to my height being 6'2 i dont look that fat.my goal is 225.trust me if my lazy *** can get up every day and workout,you can too!!.2miles isnt enough.start at 2 than after 2weeks move up to 3 then 4.drink nothing but water,no soda or juice,trust me i promise you will feel so much better once you've reached your target weight.dont give up think about how much pussy you gone get when u get in shape.if you ever need motivation use the thought of gettin alot of pussy,thats the best advice anybody can give you|`|2ZoP0lZeaa	Hey, I recommend that you try Hypnotherapy!<br>  No, I'm not kidding you on this.  I used to weigh 198 lbs and my height is only 5'8" - for my height and with that kind of weight I'm really obese!  I tried the "Master clense" and other diet recipes, and I even watched Richard Simmons videos but they didn't helped me at all!<br>  <br>  I tried going to a gym with a strict diet once and within a week later, I stopped going to gym and started eating more than before.  It brought me back to where I started again.  I am sure you happen to experience it like me.<br>  <br>  One day, I was watching CNN news and they interviewed this hypotherapist guy, his name is Steve.  I myself do not believe in hypnotherapy but the hypnotherapist was rather convincing so I visited his site (<a href="http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)</a> and he has a "Weight Loss Powerpack".  I bought the part 2 "Weight Loss Powerpack 2" which consist of Weight Loss, Stop Binge Eating and I Love To Exercise.  It is more affordable than a month of subscription to the gym and having those strict diets.<br>  <br>  The first few days I realized my eating dropped significantly and my weight dropped a little.  A week later, I begin to feel motivated to exercise and such!  His hypnotherapy works!  It has been a month already since I bought his program and I already lost 18.3 lbs!  I recommend you give it a shot!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/</a>
NJEzbr1baa	The previous posters are mostly correct.<br>  <br>  The majority of contact lens associated eye infections are related to either improper use of lenses, poor hygeine, or poor cleaning methods.<br>  <br>  By putting anything "foreign" in front of the eye, you're theoretically putting yourself at risk. Despite newer soft contact lenses containing high amounts of water, the eye is still being deprived of oxygen to some extent, and this can cause damage to the corneal epithelium (the most superficial layer on the clear part of the eye), over time.<br>  <br>  The longer you wear lenses, the risk of problems increases. A lot of ophthalmologists would recommend only wearing lenses for a maximum of 8 hours a day. Wearing lenses overnight or for an extended period significantly increases your risk of infection (the exact amount of risk depends on which paper you read).<br>  <br>  The worst lenses are the extended wear monthly disposables. A lot of people seem to think (and some are even advised this by their optician!) that it is ok to keep your lenses in for an entire month and never take them out in that time. These people/lenses are the patients I regularly see for significant infections (microbial keratitis), and some of them have gone on to require corneal grafts because even after getting rid of the infection (which can take weeks or longer), there is so much scarring on the clear part of the eye (the cornea), you can't see much, if anything. Worst case scenario, you can lose the eye.<br>  <br>  At the other end of the spectrum are daily disposables. While there is still a risk associated with these, generally people only wear these for upto 8 hours a day on average before taking out and throwing away.<br>  <br>  Personally, as far as I am concerned, you ought to have a good reason to want to stick something in your eye that has a chance of giving you problems (no matter how small that chance might be). Vanity ("I don't like wearing glasses cause they make me look geeky"...etc...") is a lame excuse in my opinion. There are a few reasons why contacts are better than glasses, and you can understand why you'd wear contacts in those cases.<br>  <br>  However, each person can make their own choice, and if you still want to go ahead and use contacts, that's fine. Just be aware of the possible complications that can occur, and accept it if and when they do happen. Try and wear your lenses as little as possible, and be completely anal about hygeine when handling lenses, cases, and solutions, and hopefully you'll be ok.|`|aiBOMU9kaa	Contacts don't cause eye infections. Misusing them can cause infections...and many other problems.The same as cars don't cause accidents, it's the drivers.<br>  <br>  If the rules of Hygiene and wearing times are followed, then there is usually no problems.<br>  <br>  So many contact wearers lack  common sense when it comes to wearing them safely. Those are the people who have problems.|`|NpRT2PRxaa	yes they do if u don't take care of them correctly !! i used to sleep wit them and my eyes started to get read which meant i wasn't lettin my corneas breath . then later on i decided 2 wash my contacts wit water since i didn't have the eye solution and it gave me a corneal ulcer on my left eye . and let me tell u its painful!!! you should follow the instructions wash ur hand before applyin ur contacts on. change the solution every 2 days and throw the case away evry 3 months. also NEVER sleep wit them its comfortable sometimes but don't do it . and don't wear them for along time . stop using them when you have to
muHctmaGaa	Do you use condoms? There are ones with specific chemicals to keep the guy from coming too soon. And from personal experience, once my boyfriend and I got into a routine with sex (having lost our virginities to each other), he's able to go longer naturally.<br>  <br>  A good way to shut him up is to (lightly) gag him, or talk dirty in his ear before he starts up himself. A better position to try is side by side, he won't be able to thrust as quickly or deeply.<br>  <br>  You should be grateful your boyfriend is still willing to make it up to you. Mine had to work up to that and still refuses to try oral.|`|lYQDCJgeaa	Are you using condoms?<br>  That should slow him down.<br>  <br>  There are books that can teach him how to hold back.<br>  By the way, most of your sex should be foreplay anyhow. Intercourse is not necessarily the best part of sex.<br>  <br>  One thing, since women can climax several times, have him get you off first, so you will feel calmer. You will probably climax again, during intercourse, if you have already gotten off before.<br>  <br>  and...coming together is highly over-rated.|`|G6jTu4Ibaa	see what he should do it to have proper foreplay with you and bring you as much close to your climax as he can.<br>  <br>  later before last step he can penetrate you and you will both have a satisfactory session.<br>  <br>  i dont really think what is the problem with him because as you said fifteen minutes all it takes means he is perfectly ok with his organ and it probably lasting long enough as seen thru a man's angel.<br>  <br>  but really feel sorry about what you say as dumb comments and all that stuff what he says on bed.  dear please express you feelings to him rather than discussing this on here.  be frank to him and tell him to perform oral before doing penetration rather than giving you climax afterwards.  <br>  <br>  please try to solve the problem of your own and do it calmly with a plenty of foreplay.|`|brSfRLspaa	15 minutes is about average if you're counting from once the penis goes in, you should do more foreplay and have him get you off orally before he starts pounding|`|fyjhfSI1aa	he should jack off beforehand.|`|FZEvHQqoaa	Sounds like you need a new boyfriend
5d0506fe6f86fded69f53c9e28c5f779aa	I do the same thing! I figured this out by accident. I injured my thumb so it was hurting to have the pressure on the thumb when I was doing bench press. I put on my batting gloves and my thumb dindt hurt nearly as much if at all. It helped me a lot and I haven't had any problems yet. I would imagine though that it could wear down the palm of your batting glove pretty quick.|`|d46e5bc188a340e7729a4bfdfb5ed476aa	its not ideal, but it will work|`|K1BMovMTaa	Yeah, honestly, I would not recommend this. When I work out with weights, I like to have absolute feel in my fingertips.<br>  <br>  Also, you will find that batting gloves will most likely rip within the first few trips to the gym. They were not made for this type of workout.<br>  <br>  Workout gloves are more durable and made from a different material made to withstand this type of activity.
qaVyBXT0aa	Yes.  There are a couple different types of food poisoning, and the intensity of the fever tends to vary based upon the type of poisoning.|`|OleVPkJgaa	If you have diarrhea, nausea, or stomach cramps, food poisoning may be the cause. You aren't really affected by food poisoning long enough to have other symptoms. You just kinda get nauseous and then throw up pretty violently. Then you feel much much better.<br>  If you have a fever, then it could be some kind of gastro-intestinal infection, like E. coli.
50WCN0graa	Cutting is dangerous. Do you want something to happen? Is there someone you trust that you can talk to about your stress and sadness? A teacher, friend, friend's parent, school counselor?|`|ZzBGpGudaa	Yeah, it officially turns you emo and leaves reminders all over your wrist that you really need better ways of dealing with stress or your emotions.  There are much better ways to relieve yourself like learning something productive (i.e. instrument, art, etc.) or watch/listen to some upbeat music or shows.<br>  <br>  Plus you gotta remember, those scars are gonna be with you your whole life. Everybody who sees you in a short sleeve shirt will see those and think of you in a different way. Do you really want everyone you meet to see you as someone who is frequently depressed?|`|EwqVQoHuaa	Idk, but I don't think you should do that. There's other ways that you should learn to control yourself. I use to do that whenever I was sad, or stressed, or just angry as fck, but, maybe try punching a pillow or something. /: I'm sorry you gotta go through sht, but everything happens for a reason, & something good will come out of everything. If you need someone to talk to, you can talk to me. :] I know you don't know me or anything, but still.. I hope you feel better, & please don't hurt yourself..|`|ADSCOgxmaa	aye aye girl no cuttin it doesn't help music is the best way i can think of to help deal with emotions it describes everything you gotta take deep breaths and look at your future you've got a life aheada you|`|PnlX3VJuaa	dont cut up stream.<br>  my friends friend did once and she almost died.<br>  so dontttt.
2y3rFvZIaa	I work in a clinic and the only way I know that our clients are getting "trich" is from unprotected sex. It is interesting that women are the ones who show signs, but men usually don't. <br>  <br>  The bigger concern is if you both don't get treated you will keep on infected each other.|`|AA11693263	This is a tricky one as it can be transmitted other way besides intercourse. There was an outbreak of it in the county where I live and it was determined that the one thing that most of the patients had in common was that they all had been swimming in a lake around here that summer. If someone you know has it and you use the same washcloth or wear each others clothes that touch the genital area you can get it. It is a parasite and it crawls into the urethra. So, there is a possibility that your boyfriend is telling the truth. And, no if he has had it, it wouldn't go away on it's own. He would have to take medication to get rid of it. Planned Parenthood's website is very informative about this and other STD's. If you have questions still, go look it up on there.|`|js8ldBmxaa	men can carry this for a long time without knowing it. it could be very confusing but if he had different relationships before u he could of got it then and gave it to you without knowing he had it|`|OleVPkJgaa	Trichomoniasis is an infection with a one-cell parasite spread by sexual contact. So it was definitely sexual contact that you got it from.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	someones lying. you need to talk to your dr about it more tho before you freak on your bf
FXBIx0Ubaa	your actually have had too much sleep, therefor you become more sleepy. It's kind of like when you don't sleep enough and become over tired and you cannot sleep. Your body and brain haven't had enough activity so they become tired easily. Try your best not to sleep in too long for a while and make sure you get some exercise, this will help you stay energized longer because you endorphins are running.<br>  <br>  I go threw this as well, and a lot has to do with the season we're in. <br>  Take care of your self and I hope you feel better soon!|`|1KqknaUHaa	have you recently stopped taking any prescription drugs or non-prescription drugs?<br>  <br>  that could be why.
F8EnH6JQaa	TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  the first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your boy adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package...THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD<br>  If man made it, don't eat it<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

When you don't eat, your metabolism slows down and then when you do eat again, you pack on the pounds twice as quick.<br>  <br>  Best way is to have 3 healthy meals a day and exercise.|`|eFaYMmuraa	Hi Im 20 (21 in a month yay) But im pretty much the same height and weight as you.

Irreversible problems.<br>  <br>  To loose weight you need to change two main things about your life:<br>  How much/How often you exercise<br>  Your diet<br>  <br>  It's healthy to work out at least 20 minutes everyday, and that means getting your heart pumping without slowing down for 20 minutes. This means you want to focus on cardio workouts such as running, jumping jacks, swimming, (etc.). <br>  I've found that swimming works the best because you're using the most amount of muscles at the same time and because the water's cold, you're burning fat just to stay warm!<br>  For different types of exercises you can go to <a href="http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/</a> sign up for free and you'll find a bunch of tips how to stay fit, including video demonstrations of specific workouts.<br>  <br>  Secondly, your diet. Eating healthy alone will help you shed those pounds because your body will be forced to burn fat instead of store it. <br>  Start by eating balanced meals that include protein, carbs, fiber, and as little fat as possible. Try not to over-do it on the carbs because carbs are energy and they get stored as fat pretty easy if you dont work it off. If you finish a balanced meal but you're STILL HUNGRY relax, this is natural we're just used to eating way too much. Go for some salad, fruit, or vegetables, because these things fill you up without weighing you down.<br>  When you feel you need a snack, eat fruit. Apples are good, peaches are very sweet if you have a candy craving and the BEST is to make a smoothie. I usually put in some cherries, banana, strawberries, blueberries, and grapes along with non-fat yogurt and ice (towards the end so it doesn't just end up as water).<br>  This may seem hard at first but if you can do it for a week, it gets easier from there--trust me!<br>  For more information on eating a balanced diet, you can visit <a href="http://www.mypyramid.gov/pyramid/index.h..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mypyramid.gov/pyramid/index.h...</a><br>  <br>  Feel free to email/message me if you have any questions<br>  Good luck!!|`|wwRbkCMraa	I have been doing the crossfit workouts and they have shredded my body big time (removed my body fat).
