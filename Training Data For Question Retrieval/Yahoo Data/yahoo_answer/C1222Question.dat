20090219155820AAd9UFN	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Contradiction to Irrational Roots Come in Conjugate Pairs?	During class, we discussed a polynomial:   2x^3 + x^2 - 8x - 3      Upon applying many theorems to analyze this polynomial and graphing it as well, we discovered that there are two negative real roots and one positive real root.      Using the rational root theorem, we discovered that none of the three real roots are rational because they don't match any of the 1,3 / 1,2 possible rational roots from the rational root theorem.      However, this means there are three irrational roots. That's the problem, we can't figure out why this is possible, because mathematical theorems say that irrational roots come in conjugate pairs.      Can anybody explain why this is possible, or whether there is some flaw in the irrational root theorem? Thanks.

20090220082637AALmTQ6	Science & Mathematics;Earth Sciences & Geology	Why does this happen?	I sat on the toilet and then...   To find the logarithm of a number other than a power of 10, you need to use your scientific calculator or pull out a logarithm table (if they still exist). On most calculators, you obtain the log (or ln) of a number by       entering the number, then    pressing the log (or ln) button.       Example 1: log 5.43 x 1010 = 10.73479983...... (way too many significant figures)      Example 2: log 2.7 x 10-8 = -7.568636236...... (too many sig. figs.)    So, let's look at the logarithm more closely and figure out how to determine the correct number of significant figures it should have.       For any log, the number to the left of the decimal point is called the characteristic, and the number to the right of the decimal point is called the mantissa. The characteristic only locates the decimal point of the number, so it is usually not included when determining the number of significant figures. The mantissa has as many significant figures as the number whose log was found. So in the above examples:       Example 1: log 5.43 x 1010 = 10.735    The number has 3 significant figures, but its log ends up with 5 significant figures, since the mantissa has 3 and the characteristic has 2.      Example 2: log 2.7 x 10-8 = -7.57    The number has 2 significant figures, but its log ends up with 3 significant figures.    Natural logarithms work in the same way:       Example 3: ln 3.95 x 106 = 15.18922614... = 15.189    Application to pH problems:         pH = -log (hydrogen ion concentration) = -log [H+]   Example 4: What is the pH of an aqueous solution when the concentration of hydrogen ion is 5.0 x 10-4 M?    pH = -log [H+] = -log (5.0 x 10-4) = - (-3.30) = 3.30       FINDING ANTILOGARITHMS (also called Inverse Logarithm)       Sometimes we know the logarithm (or ln) of a number and must work backwards to find the number itself. This is called finding the antilogarithm or inverse logarithm of the number. To do this using most simple scientific calculators,       enter the number,    press the inverse (inv) or shift button, then    press the log (or ln) button. It might also be labeled the 10x (or ex) button.      Example 5: log x = 4.203; so, x = inverse log of 4.203 = 15958.79147..... (too many significant figures)    There are three significant figures in the mantissa of the log, so the number has 3 significant figures. The answer to the correct number of significant figures is 1.60 x 104.      Example 6: log x = -15.3;    so, x = inv log (-15.3) = 5.011872336... x 10-16 = 5 x 10-16 (1 significant figure)    Natural logarithms work in the same way:       Example 7: ln x = 2.56; so, x = inv ln (2.56) = 12.93581732... = 13 (2 sig. fig.)    Application to pH problems:         pH = -log (hydrogen ion concentration) = -log [H+]   Example 8: What is the concentration of the hydrogen ion concentration in an aqueous solution with pH = 13.22?       pH = -log [H+] = 13.22    log [H+] = -13.22    [H+] = inv log (-13.22)    [H+] = 6.0 x 10-14 M (2 sig. fig.)   CALCULATIONS INVOLVING LOGARITHMS       Because logarithms are exponents, mathematical operations involving them follow the same rules as those for exponents.

According to the laws of physics, if you are traveling at near the speed of light, and you shine a flashlight in front of you, the light from it will travel at the speed of light (c) relative to you, but will also travel at the speed of light (c) relative to a fixed observer who isn't moving.  This means that to the fixed observer, the light will not be traveling that much faster than you, even though to you it is traveling at the speed of light.      1. It is accepted that this is true, but I would like to know WHY is it true?  What causes this to be so?      2. Furthermore, how do they *know* this is true?  What experiments have been done or observations have been made to prove that this is indeed fact?  Is there a reproducible experiment that I can do or observation that I can make to prove it to myself?

I am wondering what the Reynolds number for this system is, and I hopefully have all the data to find it: viscosity, density, speed of the cylinder.   However, all I've seen for Reynolds number are some easy examples: static cylinder in moving fluid, moving fluid in a pipe, etc. How do I go from an "easy " example to my system?      Thanks.

I frequently find myself in the situation of trying to calculate the standard deviation for "565 of 1725 people said yes".      My current solution is to create a column with 565 "1" values and 1160 "0" values and calculate the average & standard deviation from that.      That strikes me as a horrible kludge. Isn't there any way to just say "565 of 1725" and get the standard deviation?      Ultimately I want the standard deviation to calculate the confidence interval so I can compare results from two different surveys.

20090203063613AApxd8i	Science & Mathematics;Physics	What is a photon exactly?	My knowledge about photons is sketchy, but I am attempting to put the pieces together from all of the different descriptions about them.      Einstein said that photons have mass, but do not have rest mass. Is it possible that photons have mass produced from the relativestic effect of kinetic energy and mometum. If photons do have mass, can they generate a gravitional field? I ask this question becasue Einstein suggested that it is posslbe to have a gas made entirely of photons. To me, if a tremdinous amount of photons are clustered together, it could be possilbe that the photons could together emit a large enough gravitional field that could contain the photons in a system. Their is evidence of where if photons pass close enough to large bodies of mass, the path of the photon becomes bent. Could that be the result of a weak gravitional interaction between the photon and the large body of mass?       Photons have electromagentic interactions but do not have a charge, could it be that photons do not have a net charge, but a charge that osiclates from a positive charge to a negative charge? Photons are described to have an oscilating wave that swings from one electromagentic charge to another, but the describtion on what that actually means is extremely vague. Photons have refracted indexes when they travel through matter, which results in the slowing of the photon's net displacement. In order to piece the information together, my understanding is when the photon oscilates between opposite charges, the charge it produces causes it to sway from one electromagnetic field to another, depending on the current charge it is emiting. For radio waves, the oscilation of waves would be so slow that the radio wave would slowly bend in one direction, because it stays so long in one charge. The result is a bent wave that passes through matter. If the photon were gamma radiation, then the frequnecy would be so intense that when it passes in an electromagentic field, it causes it to travel in a tight and violent zig zag pattern, thus giving it a reduction in over all dispplacentment agaisnt time to travel.       Could these oscilating charges have a value to be calculate, or is it really true that photons have no charge what so ever at any given instances?

Ok so I did an experiment in class; and briefly what we were doing is just adding weights on to a hanging spring and we kept measuring how much the spring stretched, our lesson objective was to know that reaction force is due to the deformation of the surface, and i am for homework asked to write up the experiment but I dont get what I should write as my aim, and as prediction and also my conclusion; as obviously before the experiment I knew the fact that the more weight there is the more the spring will stretch right? So I didnt quite seem to understand what the point of the experiment was can someone explain?   Thanks,   Peace

20090203085459AACpKlC	Science & Mathematics;Biology	People smells, chemicals? ?	that rhymes! :)      I posted this in the society section and decided I might get better (or more) responses here:      Short anecdote:   After graduating high school, I traveled to visit friends of mine that I had known in primary school, but hadn't seen in about 6 or 7 years. They were still like siblings to me. When I visited the school that they were in, my old Swedish friend came running up to me and gave me a big hug. While we were embracing, she said to me, "You smell just the same way you always did!" I laughed and we started talking about it and apparently, she's always noticed the peculiar smell of me and my family and our house smells different to her. To tell you the truth, I could have said the same thing for her. Her family has a bit of a light musk smell.      I have a dutch friend that I always thought smelled funny. For the longest time, I thought it was because his room was always covered in dirty clothes, but his whole family smelled strong and I always thought it was odd, but I got used to it and started liking it.      I always liked the smells of black people because I grew up in a country that was mostly black and when I smell african americans, now it makes me nostalgic for home.      I've been told that white people smell like baloney.      My question is: Why do different people (perhaps different races?) produce different smells? Do we manufacture chemicals differently?   Also, do you notice a lot of different people smells? and do white people really smell like sandwich meat? because that's kind'a gross and I don't want to smell like

20090410153217AAK2yO3	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Algebra help please? i might fail ninth grade math :(?	I cant understand it at all.       right now, im working on finding the "point-slope equation of a line"      here is what my text book says      The point-slope equation of a line is y - y0 = m(x - x0), where m is the  slope and (x0, y0) is a point on the line.       But i dont know what that means? how do i find these points? it seems like the book is just pulling numbers out of its @ss and putting them on paper.       Example of an equation of this.       Write the two point-slope equations of the line going through (3, 6) and (1, 2).       Im so lost, and i feel so stupid right now. I might just dropout and work at mcdonalds my whole life. :(

20090203083153AAQJK0S	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	I'm really confused =[ Why does biology seem to contradict chemistry?	Ahhhh =[ I'm really confused. I'm doing higher human biology and higher chemistry, but they seem to say the opposite about energy and bonds. According to chemistry bond-breaking requires energy and bond-making gives energy. But according to biology, energy is required to make ATP out of ADP+Pi (surely bond making) and breaking ATP gives out energy. Also, anabolism which is combining simple molecules to make more complex ones requires energy and the opposite for catabolism. Another example would be getting energy out of breaking glucose (6C) into 2x Pyruvic Acid (3C). Please Explain, my brain is fried =[

Some people seem to have a bank of characters to work with - my questions are then      1) To the people who have access to symbols - how/where are you getting them? Can anyone give me links to copy and paste from?      2) Is there any way we can get Y!A to put in a little Java (or something) equation editor, or some sandbox facility where we can write maths like we want it to appear, and then copy and paste some code or something to get it to display?  There are already some quite good equation editors that work in Word (like Mathtype) which once you learn the key shortcuts you can write maths very quickly; or perhaps we could type it in as LaTeX and have it display properly? Or some other method? This would be really handy, I'm sure people would agree - can we make it happen?
