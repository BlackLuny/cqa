They are right on their way to becoming 8 more wards of the state. They don't look too good right now, because it's not that natural to have 8 kids at one time. It's hard not to judge this lady.

RxZqP0cdaa	I dont think the money went anywhere, I am not even sure it existed in the first place.<br>  Many of the banks bought into the dodgy mortgage business in the USA. Why would they do that?, the reason is that it is illegal to issue mortgages to anyone who cannot afford it in the UK.<br>  <br>  So the banks then used their projected returns on these mortgages to value their assets. The vale of the banks went up by billions on the promise of the USA mortgage holders paying for their mortgages.<br>  <br>  The banks, with a healthy looking value, borrowed money on the strength of those mortgages being repaid, they need money for their day to day over the counter business and whilst their projected income from the dodgy mortgages was not seen as "Toxic", then they were able to borrow as much as they liked.<br>  <br>  The problem came when the mortgages started to go into default, the banks then realised that they were not going to get the income they thought.<br>  When it became public, all of the banks were suspicious about how much each of their competitors had in vested in the dodgy mortgages and as a result they all stopped lending to each other.<br>  <br>  So the banks never really had any vast sums of cash, they knew that if all went well, then  they would eventually get their hands on the paid up mortgages.<br>  <br>  It didn't go well, they dont have that cash and now we, the taxpayer, are taking over the liability of all those dodgy mortgages and it is we who are now hoping that somewhere along the line, those mortgages give some sort of return to us.|`|892YhtPCaa	yeah, even bugatti cars dont cost billions|`|AA12121752	that's a good question|`|FomIa9jQaa	I think Bush took our money|`|C0yagFFoaa	i think it went on giving mortgages to people who couldnt afford them, so they gave the money to the guy who owned the house, then they couldnt pay it back, so the bank took their house, but the house prices went down, so the bank got less for the house than the loan, so the left over lost money is called toxic debt, meaning it will never be paid, then if oyu add thousands of toxic debts together, you have the billions.<br>  <br>  thats what i have gathered,|`|SoE7kqpeaa	conspirators<br>  crooked governments<br>  lying leaders<br>  <br>  greedy bankers and  bosses<br>  <br>  powerless people<br>  <br>  that's what it takes to lose billions.<br>  i am sure many billions are hidden away<br>  and if we get to find out who are actually benefiting from all this chaos, there certainly are bound to be  some in very high places, then the billions would also be there but well hidden ---<br>  eventually the truth will come out but may not be in our time, sadly!|`|LIxpXTnLaa	I think you have to be even "stupider" to not understand the concept.<br>  <br>  Congrats.

AA11049477	Jealousy.<br>  A man in a jealous rage killed nicole & her new boyfriend, Mr Goldman. There's a 911 dispatchers tape of her pleading with the police to send help, <br>  " he's breaking down the door, I fear for my life " ( their address was on the police register for a history of domestic violence incidents ) <br>  a few days before she & Goldman were found stabbed to death.<br>  <br>  What would upset a man more than see his ex-wife move on & find a new man?<br>  I'm relieved for nicole & the Goldman families, that even after so many years, justice finally caught up with OJ.|`|qKdQpZ5Kaa	It was alleged, but he was acquited - <br>  <br>  he discovered her in the company of another man, who he also murdered - Ronald Goldman|`|FomIa9jQaa	Who knows but sometimes i think he didnt killed her...|`|0W3IFOn6aa	because she divorced him!!!<br>  if your boyfriend broke up with u<br>  would u be all that happy with him???<br>  no!|`|5gG2OfHIaa	Nicole Brown received money from the football player including child support and alimony.

The second article is definitely not quality of life, I would put it as conflict and cooperation, because stem cell research is a very controversial topic that is causing conflict.

And I guess you think he has already fixed our economy? <br>  Or are you just being sarcastic?<br>  <br>  God I HATE it when all people can do is call you a racist if you don't like Obama.

LOL when did he do that?  Last I checked the economy is getting worser by the day. The stock market is going down down down. <br>  Obama hasnt fixed one thing nor is he on the right path. He is spending future generations into debt before they are even born.<br>  Let another country have him as their leader. I dont want him. He isnt leading anything as far as I can see except a path to socialism.<br>  Dont you think its a little odd how he is all over the place as far as his priorities. He is trying to change as much as he can as fast as he can. He isnt focusing on the economy. He is leading this nation to change. He mistakenly feels that its his job to change our great country into what he believes it should be. His job is SUPPOSE to be DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION and he is not doing that.<br>  <br>  <br>  To Daisy:<br>  Racists? Excuse me?!

XuP0QwFtaa	I have lost 60 percent in my investments.  My father has had his hours slashed for the first time in 35 years.  My wife and I are actually using coupons now.  We never used coupons before because of pure laziness.  Some of my friends have lost their jobs or are scared that they may lose them.  However, my father in law has gained hours and so have I.  I have made more money recently that I have in a long time.  I am in sales for grocery stores.  It seems like it is one of the few industries that will not decline a lot, or in my experience at least.  My wife has also gotten a raise.  Thank god I am one of the few that has not gotten hit severly and hope it stays that way.  Hope everything gets better for everyone else real soon.|`|uK4hyhe3aa	Personally I've been relatively unaffected.  I'm a college student.  No one seems to agree on what exactly constitutes being "middle class" but that's what I've always considered myself to be.  My parents seem fine, I'm fine, I think we'll be fine for the future.  Increased tuition and the effects on my school are a little bothersome though.  This economic downturn is leading to budget cuts at my school that mean fewer classes, more crowded classes, laying off of valuable staff, etc.  <br>  <br>  Those hardest hit are probably the ones who were already living on a budget or we're saving their money in undependable ways.  I truly believe this will all work itself out in due time, I doubt it's just going to be one day that they say "hey everybody, the recession is over!  time to spend!".  At the end of it all, it will be a lesson learned, hopefully.|`|ZgkMNG8qaa	Money has always been tight, its a matter of prioritising, thankfully I have no credit cards or debts associated with, I spend my cash wisely, save up for anything that is non essential, don't like having debt, never will.|`|e44b7050fb792247b231f218559774e8aa	Well even though I have only started to invest in my 401k what was in there is pretty much gone. <br>  <br>  And it looks like I'm about to lose my job. <br>  <br>  And I never really had to worry about a budget either, then again really didn't spend much.

There will never be peace. People will never learn how to live with each other, share land, and accept the fact that different people have different beliefs. People are going to be the cause of the downfall on mankind. Ourselves. We will destroy ourselves. And it is worse than the economy being bad, or any natural disaster.

I'm just playing it for what's called a "dead cat bounce". Long term though, ALL of these guys can go bankrupt. Then what happens? Bare spots on supermarket shelves. Not until we have bare spots will people realize what's happening. Then when they realize it they will panic and start hoarding which will wipe out the supermarkets pretty fast.

Hopefully you have someone you can turn to for help, or a church to turn to. Obama will make it more difficult for charities to survive, by eliminating tax write offs for donations. Who does that help? Many people were helped by churches after Katrina, and the Red Cross, etc. The government does not do well in providing any kind of services, so why people are depending on them is beyond me. Obama wants to provide welfare, but everyone needs to understand that it is our money he is spending. Every time they spend more and more of the tax payers money, we lose more and more of our freedom. There is a limit to all this, there has to be. Let the free enterprise system in this country fix itself, is what I say. It hurts for a while, but it will fix itself, it always does.
