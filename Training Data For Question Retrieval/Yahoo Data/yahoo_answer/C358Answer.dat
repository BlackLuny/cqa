2YqFEyB1aa	Depends on what you're looking for.  I really like Sarah Dessen's books, especially This Lullaby and The Truth About Forever, and those are teen books about girls and love and whatever XD      I also really like fantasy-ish books, so the Silverwing trilogy by Kenneth Oppel is good, and Airborn, Skybreaker, Starclimber.      The First Stone by Don Aker is good... Inkheart is pretty good... um ... yeah. :)|`|nhNLEFglaa	Try :Raise Your voice by Robin Wasserman or Ella Enchanted is pretty good!|`|26RrwiGzaa	theres alot of great books     A long Way Gone by Ishmael Beah  Promise not to tell BY Jennifer McMahon  Island of lost girls by Jennifer McMahon  Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher  Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse  Name will never hurt me by Adoff Jaime  What the Dead Know by Laura Lippman  Walk Too Moons by Sharon Creech  Winged Creatures by  Roy Freirich  Does my head look big in this by Randa Abdel-Fattah  Harry Potter Series by J.K rowling  Twilight Series by Stephenie Myer    these are the one i thought of but it really matters on what kind of books you like to read|`|mbSZpgw8aa	Eric Jerome Dickey  Sleeping with Strangers, Waking with Enemies, Dying for Revenge.

iMvz42Zuaa	Mildred Kemp was the one who commited the murders of the three children. Racheal, on the other hand, had nothing to do with the murders. She was only seen as a murderer because Anna felt that she was evil because she couldn't remember her past. So in other words, Anna was only imagining Alex as well, and whatever Alex said was something that Anna wanted to say, but didn't have the courage to say. So Racheal was only seen as a murderer in Anna's eyes, and it's fairly likely that she was either related to the mother whose children were murdered, and that's how she got the necklace, or it could have been a replica, there could be more than one of that same necklace.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	i haven't seen this version of the film yet, but it's a remake of a korean film called 'tale of two sisters'. you can look it up on ovguide.com and watch it for free.   anyways, what i gather is that the main girl was schizophrenic after the death of her sister and her mom, and that the place was also haunted. they blended a psychological thriller with a ghost story. yeah, it was a little bit confusing. hell, if you want confusing you should also watch another korean horror called 'spider forest' now THAT is a confusing movie!|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Possible spoiler alert:    The first answerer probably gave you the accurate run-down.  I, too, have seen (and LOVED) the original film "A Tale Of Two Sisters", which this movie was based on.  I'm sorry, I haven't seen "The Uninvited" yet, but a "A Tale Of Two Sisters" is the story of a girl who is guilt-ridden after the death of her sister.   After her mother and sister die, she is so traumitized that in her mind, she invents scenarios where her sister is in danger, and she has to "save" her.  She sort of splits into several "personalities", including her sister and her "stepmother", and then enacts the role of the stepmother hurting the sister, the sister being hurt, and herself trying to save her sister.  She doesn't realize that this entire time, the only people who are actually in the house are herself and her father.  Everything else is in her mind.    I would strongly recommend the original Korean version.  It is a true masterpiece.|`|JSn9WxgAaa	I saw it yesterday and the ending was so good and twisted.. but nways, Anna(main girl) is troubled and crazy bcuz she cant get ovr her moms death and she slit her wrists so she wound up in the mental ward.. Remeber the creepy lady at the beginnig later on revealed to  be Kemp, well in the beginning she said to the girl when she was leavin who will i tell all my stories to..  So basically the whole movie the girl was imagining the evil stepmom(rachel) being just an evil dirty slut bcuz in the flashbacks she did have an affair with the dad and she was pissed.. So when Anna saw those Pearls tht triggered her memory about wat crazy mildred Kemp filled her head with about the the three children stabbed to death..which was Kemp who killed the children. So Anna was so in a crazy mental state she forgot evrything and killed innocent rachel..it was a vry confusing movie.. Anna also did finish wat she started by killin Rachel.. It was sad though tht her sister was dead the whole time and she was just imaginign her sister bcuz her sister died the year before in the fire with the mom she caused by accident.. Her ex bf knew the whole time wat happened and when he told her on tht rock she couldnt beleive it and she killed him by pushin him in the water.. Basically Kemp filled tht poor girls head with stories when the girl was already in a horrible psychotic mental state.. EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!|`|2D1uxlUfaa	Mildred Kemp said "Who will i tell my stories to?" When Anna left. When Anna returns, she is convinced that Rachel is a Mildred Kemp. Then she kills her ex-bf becasue he knew what happened that night. Anna killed Rachel, and Alex had died with her mom, which the guil;t resulted Anna to go to a mental institution, it is shown later that anna got her mildred kemp is rachel ideas from mildred herself.

Some kids who were playing in the sandbox nearby came over to help, but they couldn't reach the bird. Some parents, who were sitting on a bench, watching their children play on the monkey bars, couldn't reach either. They wanted to try using a stick, but were afraid of hurting the bird. Finally, little Annie saw what was happening and got off the swing to help. She said, "I can save the bird, but it will take some time."

The little girl replied: ''Tommy down the street gave me five dollars for   doing cartwheel while he sat in the tree.

The next day the little girl came running into the house yelling, "Mommy, I   got ten dollars. The mother asked, "Where did you get the ten dollars from?"  The little girl replied, "Tommy down the street gave me ten dollars for doing   a cartwheel while he sat up in the tree and laughed."  The mother replied: "Didn't I tell you that he is...''

M7E1uIsKaa	I dont really think of them as a hair metal band.  But they came out in the 80's during the hair metal craze and their first tour was opening up for Motley Crue.. so thats why people think that.|`|1vCoaf08aa	I always kind of seen them that way.    But they're not, they're labeled like that because that is the "metal" that got all the mainstream success.    They're more of a hard rock band to me. Doesn't it make you wonder how Appetite For Destruction and Use Your Illusion I/II was so great, yet Chinese Democracy (12 years in the making) sucked?|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	You should know by now that hair metal is NOT metal. And there are definitely a few of the softer songs by GnR that I would consider hair metal, but for the majority of songs I would say hard rock. They do however have a small tint of hair metal in their music that's hard to hear, but it's not all that obvious.    Whoever gave TD to me didn't read what I said. GnR isn't hair metal, it's hard rock.|`|5youb38Raa	Well.....they're not really hair metal.  Warrant is hair metal.  And I agree...gnr isnt metal!!!  But thats just peoples opinion..  Hair metal is different than rock.  I think thats what some don't understand|`|rRCTvT7Saa	I know Guns N' Roses isn't hair metal, but people probably think they are because of their look and the fact that they got their start in the 80's.    I was never a fan of Guns N' Roses though--just a song or two...I feel that they are immensely overrated.|`|12QJ9QMRaa	well...THIS might have some impact:  http://blogs.mysanantonio.com/weblogs/tu...    also, the subject matter most Hair bands focus on are...Sex and Drugs.......   (and not the dangers of addiction like Master of Puppets) ...just what was 90% of Appetite about?    Now it's true they generally played a harder style than most "Hair" bands, but then so did W.A.S.P.  And they are Glam or Hair also.|`|ebBfz2zhaa	Yes you are so right here they arent a hair metal band   (let alone a metal band).|`|DibFrwxlaa	This is the problem with genres.  A lot of times I think people figure, it looks like a duck, it sounds like a duck, it must be a duck.  But with music it ain't necessarily a duck.    Anyways, I agree they aren't really hair metal, but they came out of the 80s rock scene in LA which seems to be where every other hair metal band arose from.|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	because they have hair  and their metal.    No but seriously i think its because they where a hard rock band from the 80s. Bands always get lumped in with whatever the dominant genre or sub genre is. I mean alternative bands from the early 90s like the Smashing Pumpkins or Blind Melon were sometimes called "grunge" even though they weren't because that was the popular sub genre of alternative at the time. So i suppose because hair metal was the dominant sub genre of rock music at the time they got lumped in with it.|`|6cUPKr7Paa	"Hair Metal" originally began as a description of the music.  Then once G'NR, Van Halen, and Def Leppard became more popular in the '80's, the name just stuck.  It's just a description of '80's metal.  Not necessarily about their hair.  In my opinion, Guns 'N Roses, Van Halen and Def Leppard were not hair bands.|`|llNoDDCsaa	They are hard rock! Get it right people!    I like hair-metal too.    Just because they had great hair and were amazingly sexy doesn't mean they are a hair band. They've wrote and preformed great songs. Sorry people but they're not a hair band. :0)|`|20ffe6Cbaa	grrr... I know it makes me angry too, but I guess just because they are an 80's band and that was a "hairmetal" era.|`|41ac7d9d52a54e7a6b648bd7d6d7d8ffaa	Okay me n axel, mark, vary on this one.  I grew it out cause it     had to fit the contract.  Then I grew it again to make movies.  Now      the tour band has two original studio artists that grew it out for      the new contract.  Now I got back into the pop clubs and am      doing santana so who knew. carlos used to have new waves      and now michelle branch does our styling.  Hope you get ready      for the spring shows, front band this year is otown, and the        new take on Beatles, velvet revolver.  Ssshazam|`|ZRQCd8kTaa	gnr is the greatest hair metal band of all time and the best r&b band, hip hop band, classical band, country band, pop band, blue grass band, soul band, folk band and so on.....|`|klsrrbEkaa	they're like heavy metal but since they were an 80's band like others they are considered hair metal|`|AA10034934	i don't think they should be. because they were popular around the time of the hair metal bands they often get lumped into that category by people who don't know any better. if you compare their talent to, say, poison, there is absolutely no comparison. i'd prefer to think of gn'r as hard rock. more proof that they aren't hair metal is that they are still well liked and their [early] music is still respected today. i can't say the same for hair metal--it's a bit of a joke.|`|owJENxStaa	not really, they're more like hard rock.|`|l1eEoYkIaa	um, ..  cause when they first came out,  they had BIIG hair!!! duuuhh!!!  so did every other hairmetal band that was  around back then, cause of their hair.|`|7d4cba081658a3d983af242ee5c7b43daa	Who cares how you label them?, they still rock.

But for the most part, i am sure they will let you in.  If not, can you get a parent to go with you?|`|BgVtUdMjaa	yes probably|`|Rb5rz2rQaa	Hmmm im not sure.    Just say he is 18 so he will  be counted as an adult.  :D|`|fym0zdK8aa	No, you will be turned away. I can see that almost everyone else has put down that they'll let you in -- THEY WON'T. The R rating is not compatible with the parental guidance rule like PG and PG-13 movies are.  If you're not 17 or older, you can't get in, no matter who you're with. Now, there's always the chance that the person who sells your tickets and all that jazz is totally inept or just doesn't care and you can get in that way, but know it's ILLEGAL and you and your brother could potentially get in big trouble.|`|56bNLJykaa	no, you would not get in. i am 17 and some of my friends are 16 and i still can't get them in. to be able to see a rated r movie alone 17 is the age, but to bring a minor in with you you have to be even older and i dont know that age (definitely 18 or older)|`|arXGZ9LMaa	yes, to view a rated R movie, you need to be 17 years old with valid I.D, if you are under 17, you need to be accompanied by someone over 17 for the entire duration of the movie.
k9gp11PMaa	Yep, I'm a Cancer but I act like my moon sign (Sagittarius).

You can act more like your moon sign than your sun sign.   Especially if it is aspected well.|`|HRfCijh4aa	Yes of course and u gave a nice description of ur qualities. I can definitely identify. People who understand their natal chart can definitely "call upon" particular signs and elements when they are "acting" out. We mostly identify with our Moon Sign on a more personal level and also during our childhood. Generally the Sun Sign is who you are at first sight or when caught off guard. A strong influence I must say. The Ascendant and its relations to both will probably give you more of a outlook to why u feel more comfortable wit your MOON Sign. I personally identify more with my Ascedant/Rising Sign. ( which is in Scorpio ) :-)|`|531f08d2bae7afb19dbace61520eb62caa	Of course it's likely astrology is worthless.

YNuyXl1waa	That has been speculated by fans of both Doctor Who and the legendary band for years (though the track in question is usually "Pigs (Three Different Ones)" from the "Animals" album).    It is known that Pink Floyd had the late Delia Derbyshire (the electronic music pioneer who created the original Doctor Who theme music along with BBC audio engineers Dick Mills and Brian Hodgson from a score by composer Ron Grainer) and her team at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop recorded with the band on one occasion.      [The BBC Radiophonic Workshop was the in-house BBC unit that created sound effects and electronic/synthesizer music scores for BBC radio and TV shows.]

Mystery is more about not really knowing what a bands motivation or muse is.  If you cannot come to understand the writers underlying idealogy.

wU0c3i7baa	He has said he reads his fanmail personally.     I wouldn't recommend sending it to his UK address. He's going to be returning to North America in the near future for filming, so he's more likely to read the US mail. If it reaches his US agent before he returns, I don't think they'll forward it to London because that would be ridiculously expensive. They'll most likely hold the fanmail for him in LA until he gets back.|`|bmwR7RdMaa	maybe after his fame dies out|`|1PGmB4JNaa	foreverrrr, he probably won't write to you personally it may be an autosender thing that his agents do or something or he may sign them soo goodluck!|`|AA10368887	Roughly, he'll respond by 2 days after eternity.|`|km1vuLUzaa	okay..i dont care if he doesnt write me back  but uhh i wanna write to him  and where do i send it to? like do u have his address or something? please help me!   go to my profile and send me a message please! thanks|`|hqjJV70Eaa	For Robert it depends on a few things.  First off where did you mail it.  Did it go to his US address or UK address.  Considering that he's in the UK right now if you mailed it to the US address it may take longer because they have to send it to him.      Right now I would probably say it takes a while.  He's still in London and prepping for New Moon.  Don't get discouraged if it take a while. He's one that does eventually respond, it just may take a while.   Hope that helps.|`|RI1brp91aa	I don't know, maybe about, like, a month or two if he actually respond. a Lot of celebrities have so much fan mail they can't read every letter they get.|`|ji8PuePIaa	never. trust me he wont write back

He's remade one of Indian Cinema's most popular movies and he actually believes that it would do well. How, one wonders, can he hope for such a thing. Karzzz is a complete no brainer masala movie. If you can leave your brains behind and do not expect any intelligence. And if you do not compare this to the old Karz, then perhaps you may be able to sit throught the whole film. Neverthless, Himesh had made an impression with this film. He is out to prove himself as an actor, and has infact done a decent job of it.

I know how 'silly' it may seem to you, but this truly does work on jerks who are racially biased.  I used to babysit a little boy the same size of my little boy, and took them places.  One was white, the other was black.  When people looked at them funny or insulted them, I'd smile and say how nice they were to notice my twins.  They'd look at me and their eyes got huge, and they'd back up a bit ... and I'd laugh as I walked off, knowing they'd have to 'think on that' for several days (since I was obviously much smarter than they were).  Try it ... it's truly fun once you know what you are doing, and the 'insulter' really has nowhere to go, if you 'mistake' their insult for a compliment!|`|NxYc2n7Gaa	Ignore!

I do not think people insult others because of the color of their skin, I think it is more to how their day went. It was bad, so "take it out" on someone else in an effort to try to feel better.

TYV6vBAxaa	Her family does know that she is a psycho because they keep needles in case she like get a bunch of crazy ideas and tries something dangerous because the needles have drugs in them that calm down a person.That's also why Rachel keeps the needles, to calm her down  umm, i don't believe that her dad knows she killed her mom and sister. i'm not sure though. He might know  Rachel tries to keep Matt( Anna's boyfriend) away from Anna because he knows what happened the night of the fire that killed Anna's mom and sister and Rachel doesn't want him to remind Anna of it, because then she would go crazy again  i think she did accidentally drop Matt off the cliff because she if did it purposely then she would have known what happened the night of the fire but she doesn't, but i'm not sure, i also think it might have been an accident! this question will always haunt me!|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	i haven't seen this version of the film yet, but it's a remake of a korean film called 'tale of two sisters'. you can look it up on ovguide.com and watch it for free.   anyways, what i gather is that the main girl was schizophrenic after the death of her sister and her mom, and that the place was also haunted. they blended a psychological thriller with a ghost story. yeah, it was a little bit confusing. hell, if you want confusing you should also watch another korean horror called 'spider forest' now THAT is a confusing movie!|`|vmbq8s6Oaa	Yes, her family knows she's psycho. that is why rachel had the needles. You can assume that her family knows about the fire, but it never really says. It was just a coinsidence, OR rachel doesn't want him to get hurt because he knows she's psycho. She did push him off the cliff, but it was subconsiously.   *pretty much, she got her stories mixed up. she thought rachel was mildred kemp. but really mildred kemp was the person across from her in the mental hospital & she just filled her head with stories & anna got them confused. her therapist said "finish what you started" & she did by killing rachel because that's what she started to do when she accidentally killed her mom & alex.    HOPE THIS HELPS!|`|kbCh76Uhaa	Oh thanks for spoiling it, I haven't seen it yet D:|`|JSn9WxgAaa	the family knew anna was mentally unstable bcuz who wouldnt be after they see their mom and sister die.. Also Mildred Kemp filled her head with crazy stories obviously about the 3 children she killed..Anna got tht confused with reality believing rachel was just an evil slut out to kill her and her sister who was really dead from the fire tht Anna accidentally started, which killed her mom also. I think when anna saw those pearls tht triggere her crazy mem. about kemp and thts were the kemp twist comes in. Also she hated Rachel so much bcuz  her dad was havin an affair with her while their mom was in the outhouse practially dying(sad).  But rachel was keepin her ex bf away bcuz she knew tht he would try to tell anna tht she killed her mom and sister by accident.. Really rachel was a nice innocent slut..but anna was just crazy and had multiple personalities.. her mind played tricks on her..she pushed her bf off the cliff bcuz he finally told her tht she killed her mom and sister accidentally..it was great movie though|`|ea0b5BzBaa	Yes, her family knows that she's psycho thats why she was in that psycho hospital. I'm not sure her family knows she started the fire, because her memories make her believe that she didn't. Rachel wanted to keep Matt away from Anna because he might tell her what really happened that night and bring back bad memories because she thinks of that night in a completely different way. Anna didn't drop Matt off of the cliff on accident. After Matt told her what really happened that night, she threw him off.|`|nqggTf1Oaa	ok so Anna is psycho  but does her family know that ?  Yes. That is why Rachel had the needles. They were needles to calm Anna down because she was still a little 'crazy' after the fire accident.    does her family know that she started the fire?  I think they do.    and why does rachel want to keep her boyfriend away from her?  If you are talking about the dad, she doesnt want to keep the dad away from Anna, but that is what Anna thinks.    If your talking about Anna's boyfriend, then I think it was just a coincedence... But also, the BF said he knew something about the night of the fire. Now remember, Anna didnt remember what happened the night of the fire, and she believed that teh fire just happened, but in reality, Anna was the cause of the fire. The Boyfriend was probably going to tell her that, but Rachel probably didnt want him to tell her because she didnt want Anna to know. I am not sure though.    Did anna drop her boyfriend accidentally from the cliff?  No. She was "crazy" and purposely dropped him, but she didnt know that, because she 'saw' him in her room and then his back was all messed up, which she thought was from the needles. The reason she had the marks on her arm was because she dropped him, but she thought it was because he grabbed her arms when she 'saw' him.

But people said it was, so it probably is if you're into action packed movies.|`|PAv7xQjSaa	It's okay. I don't think it deserved all of the hype. It was sort of similar to "Shoot 'Em Up" and "Crank". It sort of had that "man, that's so awesome that it's funny" thing going on. I don't think it's worth buying without seeing. Rent it first. Definitely.|`|BgVtUdMjaa	yes.|`|noGuGQXtaa	yes its a pretty suspenseful movie... but the ending killed it for me.. but u mite like it...|`|6i8yA1rQaa	i love that movie!!!!!|`|Sj74XGh4aa	It's good if you like action.

HgRYP3cJaa	someone who thinks they are better than other people either because of looks, intelligence etc.  Conceited ppl flaunt it.  Most have nothing to be conceited about.

xdKF0PNIaa	I think that is absolutely ridiculous. People love Twilight for the way it is written and the story itself. If she changes the plot, I am sure there will be a lot of outraged fans (myself included).    I really hope that this is a rumor. I think that it would be such a shame to change what happens in the books. I am sure that fans will be furious if she does this.    I cannot seeing it happening- Stephanie would be crazy to let it happen! :)|`|mVNMgaQBaa	stephanie meyer doesnt right the script for the movies so a) that was a lie no matter what and b) a lot of people think that way so i dont think theyre going to try and change it oh and they have a different director so hopefully new moon will be even more like the book than twilight was(and if not we get see taylor lautner walk around half nake for most of the movie and that will be great)|`|gyTcpbpiaa	I did't hear anything like this.  But, if you ever notice movies mad from books usually are different from the book.  With Twilight, I don't think she should do that.  Everybody is so obsessed with the books, don't think fans would want anything changed.  I would be terribly upset if something happened to Jacob.|`|8V1loJ6daa	I never heard about this...? Well the movies are changed a little bit but not in a HUGE way. :) I doubt that she would do that.|`|oMDB0oipaa	No in the article below it says they are remaining faithful to the books    http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28938170/|`|37L53mDIaa	She probably will, but thats what happens when people get money waved in their face!|`|tmwa1oOiaa	source please?|`|enLLBqHlaa	Yeah don't worry about it there Nessie  I am sure everything will be fine  But I know that if they are going to change things, that means they'll add us Cullens more. (Or at least Edward) For New Moon.   As much as I love Edward and everyone else, I rather it stay true to the book and have us at the beginning and at the end.   Brings the suspense when I come back and it's like "ZOMG YOU'RE ALIVE!" And then I still a yellow Porsche. I am happy that they are using a yellow Porsche for the movie.   So yeah everything will be fine   I hear that New Moon and Eclipse are going to be filmed back to back. I am not sure, I doubt it but I hope they don't change too much.    I can't believe I am saying this: But more wolf merchandise for New Moon. Remember all the merchandise they had for Twilight of Edward, Bella, Us Cullens and a bunch of things for vampires? Well I say more Jacob stuff and more wolves things, but also Cullen stuff. Just to be fair! ^.^|`|tejQnpKOaa	that impossible love, don't freight just yet =).

Gburbcuiaa	Find a cheap warm up cd. Such as Singing Like the Stars by Roger Love. That book should help you a lot. Make sure you practice the song a lot so you know it very very well. It also helps to record yourself while singing so you can be brutally honest with yourself. It sucks at first, but you will improve.
YwqfYVPbaa	Let's see..I would have been 15. Really into nu metal, grunge, and mainstream rock. Also, any rock or psuedo rock pop with female members topped my list. I'd say my favorites were:    Nirvana,Linkin Park, Kittie, The Donnas *cough* Avril Lavigne *cough*(Hey, at least I'm being honest...)    Late 15 and early 16 is when I started getting into some better music.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Queen  Micheal Jackson  Garth Brooks  Journey  Boston|`|bQgOppFsaa	Same great bands I listen to now!|`|AA11039335	14, hmm.    Well, this was when I listened to Nirvana almost all the time! >  But also Red Hot Chili Peppers and I was just getting into Pink Floyd.    I really can't remember any else!     Oh yeah! Also Eminem and Limp Bizkit. But I liked them a lot more when I was younger, so was listening to less and less.|`|TZTJRrM4aa	Hanson, and Hanson only.    that was back when i was stubborn and refused to listen to anything other than Hanson      I was only 9 :(|`|llNoDDCsaa	The Beatles  Counting Crows  The Rolling Stones  Meat Loaf    Wow...

The Mondego family live in Marseille and while the movie may not get into it the book explains that are of Spanish descent.|`|PAv7xQjSaa	I think the characters are supposed to be Spanish even though it is a French movie.

I would rate them all as 10/10 ~~  Cause many of his songs are inter-related/woven, with various events in my life !!~  >>> I sure did notice that these are yr personal fav......!!

But, I have heard Ehsaan Tera and Jo wada kiya...  Both are good songs.    Sorry, it might appear as if this is an insult to the legendary Mohd. Rafi, but, I normally like listening to the latest songs or songs of the recent past.    I am sure though that your choices must be good enough!!  :-)|`|ybtOvNs7aa	i dont know if im good enough to judge the gr8 singer like Rafi saab.

TM7o75ODaa	I have the same problem. I live around the Delaware-Maryland state line and the closest concert to us is in Baltimore, MD. So I can definitely sympathize.

Best of luck!|`|2iWAPPd6aa	hey. mines worse. i live in concord, CA and the closest show she has is in LA, which is like 7 hours away.

sKLY9v9Iaa	Serj, I think he is the mind of SOAD|`|LQtIREVUaa	OMG! I f***king love System of a Down! I am a follower of Scars on Broadway and Serj Tankian.     I would have to say Serj Tankian. I love every song, but on Scars on Broadway I only really like "They Say" and "World Long Gone."    Anyway, I'm a girl and Serj Tankian is hot!!! Daron needs to shave and I would really like him a lot more, but music wise Serj all the way, baby!!!!|`|lGzQtEH7aa	I think Serj Tankian would win, but System of a Down will always be better than both of them.|`|24WKJ6SPaa	hmmm...im gonna have to go with serj.....achozen is another one you can put up there though|`|oojVKGjCaa	serj tankian yeahhhhhh but the y both rock yeah|`|a0cc26d8f66caee6bd1830dc6e4c87baaa	Same here!  But Serj has astounded me with his solo stuff. Some stuff like : Empty walls, Feed us, Saving us, Unthinking Majority are just great!  Serj tankian is amazing.    Scars on Broadway isnt bad either, but they really don't have as many hits as Serj. I really like "They say" and "World long gone" though. great stuff.    But you forgot Shavo!  Just in case you didnt no, shavo is in a group called ACHOZEN, which he created with some members of the WU TANG CLAN, friends of SOAD. But theyre rap...and i really dont like their music.|`|x8mHnT2jaa	eww these is hard...i love them both...i'm gonna have to say Serj...he's music is really interesting and always has hidden meaning...i love Scars On Broadway and They Say was a real kick@ss song..i'm listening to Stoner-Hate right now...but some of the stuff is really random..there may be a meaning in there somewhere but i can't find it..|`|EvMZJ6eyaa	I love Serj's song they are amazing.  Some of Scars on Broadway's songs are good. ALL of Serj's songs are good!!    I like System too but not as much as Serj he has a different sound to him.|`|a09dd1c5a64bc210a3271b614cb8987baa	i feel the exact same way, though i do like scars on broadway too, serj solo is better in comparison.    i wonder if they're going to get back together?    i heard they're doing this because daren (if that's the back-up vocalist's name?) wanted to sing more, but serj wouldn't let him.    ah...

RBW9ZX1iaa	It all depends on how good you want to get. If you plan on really dedicating yourself to the saxophone then get a cheap student model so you can move up to a better horn without soosing a lot of money. Almost all major manufacturers are going to have student, intermediate and, and pro models. I personally play on a Mark 6 and a "Naked lady" Conn. they are good horns but they're also expensive pro models. Selmer and yamaha are probably two of the best. I don't play a yamaha but my friend has one and it has perfect intonation up and down the horn. Yamaha is very consistant and well designed. Don't get a Mark7!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also something you might want to think is a mouthpiece and reeds. Yamaha also makes mouthpieces but some really good ones are Selmer, vandoren, tonalin, and Bari. Remember, NEVER  buy a mouthpiece without trying it. Even if you've tried the model, try the one your gonna get in the store. Every moupiece is different. even if they are the same model they might not sound the same. As far as reeds go the two largest companies are Rico and Vandoren. Vandoren are expensive reeds but they sound good. Rico is very consistent, cheap, and every middle school/ high school band instructor you'll ever talk to will probably suggest them. Different kinds of reeds have different sounds. If your in a classical band then Hemke's, vandoren paris, and rico/ rico royel are all good picks that will give you a dark, full sound. if your doing some kind of jazz program then Vandorin v16's, Zz's, Java, or Rico jazz select have bright, edgy tones. Remember though, equipment isn't going to make you sound good. You could give a pro set-up to someone with no experience and it'll sound terrible. Focus on strengthening your embouchure and air controll. Do allot of long tone excercises and Over tones. Over tones are difficult and take allot of practice but if you do them correctly it will improve your tone. just make sure that you are using your throat and not your embouchure to produce these over tones.|`|aCDWwsisaa	It doesn't really matter; so long as you buy a new instrument, or a used one that has been repadded, then the noise you make will be a function of how you play, not what brand of saxaphone it is...    Think about it, if you wore a pair of $150 Air Jordans, and went head to head with Michael Jordan with him wearing $8 shoes from WalMart, who'd score the most baskets?|`|c3BGCFdFaa	I've been playing professionally for over 40 years. I use a Yamaha YAS21 that I bought in the sixties, and I wouldn't dream of changing.  Go for the Yamaha YAS 23; you won't be sorry.    Incidentally, don't even dream of buying a Prelude. It's got the Selmer/Conn name, and it sounds good at first, but it will start falling apart after a few months.|`|TZz1uPY2aa	The Yas-23 is a solid dependable work horse student horn if adjusted correctly by a reputable repair person. But they can  come pretty well beat up considering they've been being made since 1979|`|4JppzNYeaa	Yamaha and Yanagisawa are very good quality.  Dont go for Jupiter or Selmer.

cVQkkl34aa	As always at big concerts, they are strict when it comes to drinking and Bamboozle is no different. There is alot of security teamed up with the NJ State Police and it doesn't really get out of hand. There are more underage people then older ppl so, there isn't really that many ppl drinking. The alcohol price is very high as well, which encourages less drinking. I've been to bamboozle the past 2 years and i had a good time and didn't really see any problems as far as drinking goes. Don't worry, it'll be fine and you'll be fine ... You'll enjoy it and won't regret going!|`|N4IxRoIcaa	I'm planning on going to Bamboozle, too, on May, Second in North Jersey. There will probably be a few (Or a lot of) people that get drunk and start to do stupid stuff. I went to a The Maine/ Metrostation/ Good Charlotte/ Boys Like Girls concert in August and there were these drunk girls that started going nuts and pushing everyone around, including me and my friend. It was funny though, because the tester guy got up on the microphone after The Maine stopped play and was like "Yo, you! Drunk girl in the yellow shirt! You suck!" After that, I didn't see them again, so I think they got removed. There probably will be drinkers there, though.
4GUU4R2iaa	Even though the Magician's Nephew takes place before the L,W, and the Wardrobe, it was actually released 5 years after the L,W, & W.  Maybe that has something to do with the order of the movies.|`|SDLLNyX5aa	They probably skipped a book because they didn't want the kid actors to age too much, where they can't play little kids (even in Prince Caspian they looked pretty old). If they had book before Prince Caspian into a movie first, they kids would have been too old to the later books.|`|zetxxZWUaa	They started with the second book because they needed a prequel and since the characters in the second book aren't in the first book then they'll come out with the origin of Narnia in a few years.|`|373267de54a567ce4fdd303d84705891aa	C.S. Lewis wrote the lion the witch and the wardrobe first, then Prince Caspian....so theyre actually going in the same order as he wrote them. Even tho i know the magicians nephew is set before those books, for whatever reason he wrote it after.

a860e9b17c0946e66c4ca331bb01f9d2aa	I just don't understand this. Hollywood is so superficial and I understand that she made her career off of her looks but for the media to call her "fat" is just so inaccurate.    She is actually smaller than the average woman and going from a size 4 to a size 8, in my opinion, isn't exactly gaining weight. I would much rather see Jessica than an emaciated Nicole Richie.     Jessica looks healthy, not fat.|`|AA11325161	true|`|bmwR7RdMaa	true

ZyGyDLsDaa	The Further Adventures of Tennessee Buck (1988)  starring David Keith, Kathy Shower, Brant von Hoffman, Sydney Lassick, Stephen Davis  IMDb synopsis:  A drunken, down-on-his-luck adventurer is hired by a wealthy man and his beautiful wife to take them on a hunting expedition in the jungle. After a while, though, the guide begins to suspect that there's more to the expedition than just hunting.  IMDb review:  Kathy Shower plays a big city wife in the jungle for her first time who has to learn that she can't dress and act like she's still in the city. Her husband ends up beheaded, and she gets kidnapped and raped by jungle people. So, David Keith has to come in and save the day.    YouTube has a movie trailer, but there is a bit of nudity, so I didn't post a link to it. Type this for the trailer:  The Further Adventures of Tennessee Buck (1988)    I actually had forgotten about this movie till you asked the question! At first, I thought, "Nah! I've never seen a movie like that!" Then, the title popped into my mind, obviously a play on "Indiana Jones", right? There are a number of other films about that time that had the same type of adventurer title.

It's detail-oriented & analytical but not as aggressive as say, a Fire or Air Mars, or even a Scorpio Mars.|`|OCc1si6Gaa	Astrology is the system of belief in which knowledge of the relative positions of celestial bodies is used to interpret and organize information about personality, human affairs, and other terrestrial matters.    Since earliest known records in about 2300 BC; astrology has played a role in the shaping of culture and politics throughout history. In fact, despite the modern conceit that we live in an "enlightened, scientific and literate society", nearly every major newspaper in the world contains an astrological horoscope section.    Unfortunately, Astrology is bullshit.    4300 years ago, when the ancient Babylonians invented the practices we now call astrology, they were earnestly trying to understand the world they inhabited. The Babylonians did not have anything resembling the scientific method of thought, but did the best they could.    Babylonian astrology was based on the "theory of divine governance". This theory encompassed the belief that events on earth, including famines, harvests, wars and treaties were the direct result of the will of a large number of gods. These gods were active and regular agents affecting earthly and human matters, unlike the distant or non-involved "God" that many modern Christians may recognize.    Starting from the Babylonian's observation that the fertility of the soil depends upon the sun and rain from the heavens; and that mischief and damage done by storms and floods were to be traced likewise to the heavens; the conclusion was made that the gods had their home in the heavens.    Observation of the night sky, coupled with the desire to predict important events such as storms, or crop failures led quite naturally to the early Babylonian astrology.    The Babylonians divided the night sky into small discreet regions, each the home of one of their gods. These regions, although renamed and reshaped since 2300 BC, are what we now call constellations. There are 88 constellations defined and recognized by the International Astronomical Union, these 88 regions of the sky encompass the entire sky visible from the surface of the Earth. This is obviously many more than the 12 commonly associated to zodiacal astrological star-signs familiar to every modern newspaper. To understand the significance of these 12 zodiacal constellations, its necessary to understand a little about the mechanics of our solar system.    the plane of the eclipticThere are nine Planets in our solar system, varying in distance from the sun, from the nearest, mercury, to the farthest, Pluto. (or Neptune, as Pluto has recently be reclassified, losing its planetary status) The planets in our solar system all orbit the sun in the same direction, and in the same plane. That is, all the planets follow orbital paths which are more-or-less in line with each other, defining a flat plane with the sun at its center. This is called the "plane of the ecliptic" because if three celestial bodies, such as the sun, the moon, and the earth briefly "line up" creating an eclipse, it is on this plane.    From the surface of the Earth, the plane of the ecliptic can be drawn across the sky as an imaginary line. Observations of the planets and the sun will always be along this imaginary line.    The constellations of the zodiac are defined as those which are bisected by the plane of the ecliptic. A person's "zodiacal sign" is the constellation in which the sun is found on the date of their birthday.    constellation of Ophiuchus The zodiacal constellations are:       1. Sagittarius     2. Capricorn     3. Aquarius     4. Pisces     5. Aries     6. Taurus     7. Gemini     8. Cancer     9. Leo    10. Virgo    11. Libra    12. Scorpio    13. Ophiuchus        Some people might be surprised to learn there are not twelve, but thirteen constellations in the zodiac. In the 2nd century AD a Greek astrologer and mathematician named Ptolemy published a set of astrological tables which omitted the thirteenth constellation, Ophiuchus. Ptolemy's 12-sign astrological table was based on the sun spending an equal amount of time in each constellation, corresponding to the 12 months of the calendar. He is known to have used the then-2400 year old Babylonian astronomical data. As a popularizer of horoscopic astrology, Ptolemy may have sacrificed accuracy for simplicity.    Whatever scientific merit there might have been in the still-developing field of astrology, Ptolemy's tables mark a point of divergence from the later science of astronomy which replaces it. Present day horoscopes published in newspapers still use the same tables.    If people still believed that events on Earth were controlled by supernatural beings living in the sky, modern horoscopic astrology would have a significant problem.    That Ptolemy's tables were based on second-millennium BCE Babylonian data brings up the issue of precession. The Earth, as most people know, not only orbits the sun once per year, it also rotates on its own axis once per day, similar to a spinning to|`|EuwjIJ3Zaa	Mars is the planet that represents how we express ourselves, but on more of a living, breathing, feeling plane.  It kind of represents our 'survival' mode, and how we express it.  The 'fight or flight' term is a good analogy here.    The Moon is similar to Mars in this sense; However Mars in some ways completes through ACTION, the emotions and senses that our Moon took in, and contained from our environment.    Mars also, for a man, represents the energies he needs to connect with, in order to feel 'masculine', in his idea of the word.    Mars in Virgo at it's healthiest, represents a person who is hard working, and detail oriented. They like to do things correctly, and may have a phobia about making errors.    When well aspected, this placement can describe a person who works extremely carefully and diligently at any undertaking they pursue in their lives.     When negatively aspected this placement can signify repression.  Sometimes a person wants to be perfect so badly, they lose gumption in the task, and don't follow through to the best of their ability.    Virgo is an earth sign, which is connected with tangible results.  Things a person can touch, and feel and see. Because of this, Mars in Virgo people may be of the mindframe, that they define themselves but what they do, and furthermore, the QUALITY of what they do, to a great extent.|`|MWe4hMm1aa	low sex drive|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Low sex drive possible   You have your partner live up to impossible standards   You see that sex is healthy, as a stress reliever   Not very aggressive  Critical

Hunter and hunted matching wits in a deadly ballet. The hunter laying out the traps of jewelry and dinners. The hunted leaving subtle signs of what could happen if she's captured. Finally the hunter finds the perfect lure and the hunted snaps it up and is captured! It won't take long before the hunter realizes that it was the hunt that was exciting,not the capture and starts prowling again. Soon his prey gets restless and learns of the escapes in her trap. But she does not leave quickly and quietly as you would think normal prey shown freedom would do. No, she takes half of everything the hunter owns and still seeks revenge! The hunter becomes the hunted.|`|RnwrEcY5aa	I think that Papa McCain is confused between hunting and haunting.     I like The hunt.

ab3efd718c864b03946535d2dc7dfbfbaa	If you look on youtube there is live footage of Nirvana playing More Than a Feeling and then leading into Smells Like Teen Spirit, but they are singing More Than A Feeling the same way they did Seasons in the Sun.    There is also some good footage of Nirvana playing in someones basement in the 80's. If you see it, why is Kurt singing right at the wall?    BQ: Smells Like Teen Spirit  BQ2: Nirvana   BQ3: Brad Delp   BQ4: Piece of Mind  BQ5: About a Girl|`|ObeBvtzgaa	It sounds similar, but I don't think he "ripped it off". Probably was inspired by Boston.  BQ-As an individual song, Smells Like Teen Spirit probably.  BQ2-Nirvana maybe, hard to pick, neither are in my top 20 or anything, but I don't mind either.  BQ3-Brad Delp  BQ4-More Than A Feeling  BQ5-Breed|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	umm what they don't sound a thing alike. If anything teen spirt is a rip off of the pixies (kurt admitted that).    BQ: Teen Spirt in my biased 90s  alternative/grunge obsessed opinion  BQ2 Nirvana in my biased 90s alternative/grunge obsessed opinion  BQ3: Kurt in my biased 90s alternative/grunge obsessed opinion  BQ5: Tourette's at the moment.|`|6D4a6PoVaa	No more than the Offspring's "Self Esteem" ripped them both off.  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kIZeVoRB...  But seriously, people steal chord progressions all the time.  Just because "SLTS" was plastered all over MTV doesn't mean it's special.    BQ: "Smells Like"  BQ2: Nirvana  BQ3: Kurt  BQ4: ???  BQ5: "Where Did You Sleep Last Night"|`|YaXO6crXaa	Some similarites, but it is not a ripoff.    BA: More Than a Feeling  BA2: Nirvana  BA3: Kurt's voice has a certain charm...  BA4: More Than a Feeling. I'm not really into them.  BA5: Heart-Shaped Box    Not really...|`|DibFrwxlaa	I can't hear it but I suck at this kind of thing.  If someone played them both on the same guitar with the same amp settings I might be able to tell.    BA:  I have no idea.  BA2:  Nirvana  BA3:  I guess Brad Delp is the "better" vocalist but I like the raspiness of Kurt Cobain's voice.  BA4:  Smokin'  BA5:  On A Plain    Sorry, boring answer.  But you sounded as desperate as a guy on prom night.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	No, i don't think he ripped them off, it's a common riff. He admitted he was inspired by them.     BQ: Smells like teen spirit   BQ2:Nirvana   BQ3: Kurt  BQ4: More than a feeling  BQ5: All apologies (at the moment).|`|yfR1b1Q3aa	No, I don't really hear much.  Same basic chord progression, but it's very common.    BQ: Smells Like Teen Spirit  BQ2: Don't really have a preference  BQ3: Brad Delp  BQ4: Walk On Medley (live)  BQ5: On a Plain|`|1WlnkqAVaa	Kurt Cobain admitted that the riff of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was based on the riff of "More Than A Feeling". "Cobain himself held similar opinions, saying that it "was such a clichd riff. It was so close to a Boston riff or [The Kingsmen's] 'Louie Louie.'"[4]"    BQ: "Smells Like Teen Spirit"  BQ2: Boston  BQ3: Brad Delp  BQ4: Foreplay/Long Time  BQ5: All Apologies|`|gO0AmLoDaa	He didn't rip off Boston, but the Teen Spirit riff was definitely influenced by More Than A Feeling, and Kurt admitted that.  They actually played the first part of MTAF one time before going into SLTS--  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n2TVI1Ij...    BQ: Idk.....???  BQ2: Boston  BQ3: Brad  BQ4: More Than A Feeling  BQ5: Come As You Are|`|bdAXPFthaa	Even in an interview Kurt had said that that chord had been sampled in many songs and if anything he had "ripped it off" from Louie Louie by The Kingsmen.  He could of ripped it off, but I really doubt it.|`|1vCoaf08aa	Haha, hey, I answered before.    Anyways, I hear similarities, I'd say Kurt just "sampled" it.    BA1: More Than A Feeling  BA2: Boston  BA3: Brad (but I love Kurt's gritty voice)  BA4: I Had A Good Time  BA5: Come As You Are.    Yeah, kinda, but we KNOW Brad's was a suicide (wink, wink)|`|N62uLMf3aa	Sounds like it. How about this.  In Bloom - Nirvana   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3oEvaq7...  25 or 6 to 4 - Chicago  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmPVxyr18...  I always thought they ripped off Chicago!    BA: sadly smells like teen spirit  BA2: BOSTON.   BA3: Brad Delp. Curt Cobain his voice kind of gets on my nerves the way he grumbles  BA4: Smokin'  BA5: none. sorry|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	No.    BQ- Smells like Teen Spirit. More than a Feeling is better though.  BQ2- Nirvana  BQ3- Brad Delp  BQ4- More than a Feeling  BQ5- You know you're right    Why do you want people to bash Kurt?  I'm sure if people wanted to bash him they would. Unless they need encouragement. In that case I guess this question is alright.|`|MmbLWe3Qaa	Holy freaking crap. I've never noticed that. That's awesome!  Man, I love that Boston song almost as much as I love his mustache. Haha.    I don't think he ripped it off. It's not THAT obvious. But it is interesting.    BA: Smells Like Teen Spirit  BA2: Nirvana  A3: Brad Delp, I guess. Since I can't be biased. Haha.  BA4: More Than A Feeling. As I said earlier, I love that song.  BA5: Come As You Are. or Heart Shaped Box|`|YbmklSzGaa	I'm not really sure about that.     Kurt Cobain did, however, admit that the riffs in Come As You Are are from Killing Joke's Eighties. If you listen, they're pretty much the exact same except slower in Nirvana's.    Eighties: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1oyfG6t2...    You may know that already though...      BA: More Than A Feeling  BA2: I'll say Boston  BA3: ...  BA4: More Than A Feeling...lol  BA5: Milk It|`|KEk728Gsaa	This doesn't surprise me. As far as *mainstream pop rock* goes, Nirvana is excellent. When compared to truly great bands, Nirvana is "meh" at best.    BQ:Smells.  2:Nirvana  3:Cobain I suppose  4:More Than a Feeling  5:Come As You Are|`|7B2s7maWaa	No I don't think Nirvana or Kurt ripped off Boston. To be honest I don't hear the similarity at all.    bq:'More Than a Feeling'  bq2:Nirvana  bq3:Kurt Cobain  bq4:-  bq5:'Come As You Are'

vvTrmHtxaa	well heroes is defently worth watching and your friend is right you should watch it from the beginning because than you will not understand the story. the show is about ordinary people with an extrodinary ability. like there is a cop who can read minds and a cheerleader who can not get hurt. It is great because these people really change as the story goes along. like the cheerleader was inocent could not throw a punch and was just her fathers claire bear.But as the show went along the cheerleader learned how to protect her self and started to learn that it is ok to be different. but if you want to find out more go to these websites to watch heroes    youtube  youku  nbc.com  movie6.net  heores world  hulu.com  tv.com  trueveo  veoh  aol vidoe  yahoo video  msn video  google video  myspace video  mega video    please pick me as best answer!|`|fjNxzd6Baa	Basic premise - at roughly the same time a set people around the world discover they have extraordinary abilities. Some try to make sense of it, some use it for good, others for evil. Try tv.com or NBC.com to watch a couple of the first season episodes. Once you know some of the characters and their abilities things are easier to follow.|`|fd3969820c20a4244842f433a5e6eee6aa	Season1 is pretty good. It has a couple of minor problems. Season2 is okay. It has a few major problems. Season3 is a complete and total disaster. It is not worth watching. That is unless you have a lot of time on your hands or like laughing at bad tv.|`|1E7gqGBGaa	The first season was all right, but the whole story line is pretty retarded now.|`|PjW3Yo2saa	ya its kinda like xmen only there isn't a school or a prof X   i agree with most that season 1 was good... then it just got worse  form there..  i lost my interest when Hayden Panettiere aka the cheerleader  got on her soapbox and started badmouthing my beliefs on our political  system

tuATxHsVaa	I too play violin, of course. I have used both of these string sets. I use Helicore for electric violin (jazz, pop, etc.). I use Dominants on my fine acoustic violin. I do not use their E string. I use a Jarger Forte E.    Because of the way Dominants are manufactured (synthetic perlon) - they don't transmit every bit of sound into a fine electric pickup. Therefore, the steel Helicores are a superior electric string.     Helicore really are not very good for classical music, despite what their website suggests. That's my 2 cents.     Of course, each type of string will sound different on every instrument. You should definitely try the Dominants. I think you will like them. I have used them on violins and violas and they have a rich sound.    The other poster is right. Dominants will be very metallic when you first put them on - so don't be dissuaded by that. It fades after a day or two and you get the warm, rich Dominant tone.    Lots of professionals use(d) dominants. This list includes Isaac Stern (at the end of his career).     Important addition:    Dominants are well-know for their ability to stay tuned even when you are working outdoors, etc. The synthetic cores are good at holding pitch even in the worst of conditions and changing settings. Older style strings would easily go out of tune when you go from a hot and humid room into a cold and dry one. Etc.    Good Luck.|`|FpWXuzH7aa	Not a cellist here.I'm a violinist.    I have not tried Hellicore strings yet but I use dominant most of the time because of the warm sound it gives after seasoning.Although I hate it when it comes to restringing dominants...They give a distasteful metallic sound but after it settles,it becomes quite nice.

Kweli] C'mon!!    [Verse - Talib Kweli]  This the story of - Lucy In The Sky Wit Diamonds  Ask her why she crying, she wanna live, she got no time for dying  Was a science, dreams too big for a small town  She gotta get to New York and watch a door fall down  Hopped off the Greyhound, gotta make her way now  She sleeping on the park benches in the playground  But cash burn quick, don't wanna have to turn trick  Ready to quit 'til she met the super pimp  Flashing his toothy smile that drove little Lucy wild  She quick to hop up on his dick straight Hoopie style  She let the fella hit but she sang she sell-a-bit [celebate]  He ain't buying that, she ain't selling it  She looking for love in all of the above  Believing videos, trying to back up all on a thug  Who wanna - put it in her, withdraw like a Citi card  But now she shake that *** for tips at the titty bar    [Chorus - Talib Kweli (Pharrell)]  Broken glass - everywhere! (IT'S LOUDER!!)  Louder - than a bomb shattered in in the air (IT'S LOUDER!!)  Try to hold back your tears baby! (IT'S LOUDER!!)  Wait a second, what happens here baby? (IT'S LOUDER!!)  Broken glass - everywhere! (IT'S LOUDER!!)  Louder - than a bomb shattered in in the air, yeah  (How many of y'all think you can do what we do?!)  Yeah! Wait a second (One! Two! Three! C'mon!)    [Verse - Talib Kweli]  Dreams shattered like broken glass  Press ignore it and your hopes get broken fast  You complain for the life you supposed to have  But when you try to make plans God is known to laugh  Throw a song on the phonograph, and Lucy start wilin  The trick start smiling, watch the loot start flying  The Gucci start pilling up, she live designer plush  Start lining up the coke so she could find a rush  Time's up, she's about to turn 33  Her **** started to sag, she got surgery  Now cats are used to drive past her like a Church van  Acting on thirst, 'She Wants To Move' like a N.E.R.D. fan  Bigger house, 10,000 dollar purse fam  She let you in, she wanted rent by the 1st man  She the ring leader in a clique of birds  And they shadowy, like the silhouette behind the curtain    [Chorus]    [Verse - Talib Kweli]  She was a small city girl with big city dreams  ****** try to figure how to get up in them jeans  Put her in them scenes, get her on the team  Hit her wit the cream 'til they figured out the schemes  Now she all up in the club looking for a new love  Really like Huey Lewis looking for a new drug  Cause coke's getting old, started free basing  Graduated to crack, smack on occasion  Not catching the bus, but back at the station  Back and forth pacing, acting all impatient  Last hundred dollars, she got to 'Get By'  Now gotta make a choice, go home or get high  Mommy and daddy miss her, she left for the fame  Now what's left is the dirt that's thrown on her name  She need a ticket home if it's the right course  Instead she bought a ticket to ride the white horse    [Chorus]|`|Se5Tai0Taa	I LOVE THE BEATLES!

hZGunKkdaa	I have not seen the First printing go for that much. The most I have seen it go for so far is $75 Buying 10 copies of the FOURTH printing to me is a little much. There is a reason it is the fourth printing. That means that there were three other printing runs that were just as long as this one that ran before it. And in comics the first printing is always the most valuable.    Plus just like all major issues like this, within the next couple years this book will drop to be only at a $20 value First printing or not. So if you can foul someone into buying it for that much and live with it on your conscience then go for it. But do it quick before society catches on.|`|2ogFk4Amaa	NO, people would not buy it for that much, not even a spider man issue 14 can sell for that much.|`|C0K3Bo2Aaa	Might be worth more later on.

Here is a geography lesson for you: Great Britain is divided into three counties; England, Scotland and Wales. They all have different accents. So you can't say British accent because I don't know which one you are referring to - English, Scottish or Welsh. I think you meant to say English accent, not British. There is no such thing as a British accent.     Learn from your mistakes. Good luck finding the song! Might be Kate Nash or Lily Allen?|`|Yj47LMavaa	uhmm, its coblie caillat, idk what song though

I Wanna- No experience with it dancing yet, but its fast paced and sounds like a good jump song.    The River- its not as well known but is incredibly fun to dance to    Punk Rock Princess- with the right people, this could be one of the best times of your life (its really fun)    Thats all I have so far for past music, but if I think of anything I'll update.|`|qAfnWKQCaa	Rocker - AC/DC   Faster and louder - The dictators   You need rock - Mojo rib   The Likes of you - Odd Zero   Live to win - Motorhead   Kick out the jams - MC5   Were a happy family - the ramones   Iron maiden - Iron maiden   Short road to nowhere - peter pan speed rock   Fell it inside - Annihilation Time   One track mind - Johnny thunders   No Feelings - the sex pistols   River Deep, Mountain High - The saints   Drinking And Driving - Black flag   your emotions - The dead kennedys     Well, if you consider head banging and the pogo dancing.|`|fzqMOD4Waa	New Order - Blue Monday (original 1983 12" mix), Bizzare Love Triangle, Shellshock, True Faith, The Perfect Kiss, Round and Round...|`|G57RZLsnaa	Midnight juggernauts|`|xxHHAEp4aa	Family Force 5 - Dance or Die  listen to the entire album and yes go buy it and not illegally download it!!!|`|znxbqEv1aa	katy perry is really up beat...|`|EFCpKrjfaa	Shake It  its a song by Metro Station
vLlju4kwaa	A lawyer and a blonde are sitting next to each other on a long flight from LA to NY. The lawyer leans over to her and asks if she would like to play a fun game. The blonde just wants to take a nap, so she politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks.    The lawyer persists and explains that the game is really easy and a lot of fun. He explains "I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5, and visa-versa." Again, she politely declines and tries to get some sleep.    The lawyer, now somewhat agitated, says, "Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $50!" figuring that since she is a blonde that he will easily win the match.    This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring that there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game.     The lawyer asks the first question. "What's the distance from the earth to the moon?" The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a five-dollar bill and hands it to the lawyer.     Now, it's the blonde's turn. She asks the lawyer "What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down with four?" The lawyer looks at her with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references. He taps into the Airphone with his modem and searches the Net and the Library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends E-mails to all his co-workers and friends he knows. All to no avail.    After over an hour, he wakes the blonde and hands her $50. The blonde politely takes the $50 and turns away to get back to sleep.     The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, "Well, so what IS the answer!?"     Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5, and goes back to sleep.|`|43hzcys2aa	this blonde went to a ventroliquist show. the ventroliquist was having a dummy on his lap and making the dummy seem as though it is telling blonde jokes. after a while, the blonde felt very miffed and she stood up and shouted, "who the hell you think you are to make fun of blondes? do you think we are that stupid??"    the ventroliquist, alarmed, said: "im sorry ma'am i didnt mean to hurt your feelings or anything..."    the blonde: "no you, you idiot! i was talking to the dummy on ur lap."|`|JwPa7yxiaa	a blonde girl and her husband were sitting in their living room watching the news and something came up that said a Brazilian skydiver had been killed and she started to cry really hard.

LOL GET IT? DID U LIKE IT?|`|GNtWomekaa	 There was a blonde called Sally.   Sally was poor, and decided that she wanted to win the lottery.  So one night, she got down on her knees and prayed for a win.  The next day nothing happened.  The next night she prayed again. This time, god spoke to her and said "Sally, work with me here, buy a ticket!!!"       3 blondes were stuck in an elevator, the phones didn't work either.   1 blonde said to the other 2, "I think the only way to get help is by shouting together, okay?"  So they all shouted, "together, together, together!"       One morning a blonde stormed out of her house, went to her mailbox, opened it, then slammed it shut. She did this several times.   Finally, her neighbour asked, "are you ok?"  The blonde replied, "No! My stupid computer keeps saying, 'you've got mail'"       John came home one day to find his wife painting. She was sweating, wearing a ski jacket and a fur coat at the same time.  "Why are you wearing that?" he asked.  His wife replied, "The paint instructions says, 'for best results put on 2 coats'"       - I Took scarfe back to store, it was too tight.  - I Tried to go water skiing, but couldn't find a lake with slope.  - Baked turkey for 4 & 1/2 days.

f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	1. Its due this year i believe    2.well if they are coming out with an album then probably    3. of the videos i have seen they are ok live, they sing the older stuff better live because american idiot was overproduced.    4. I used to be unhealthily obsessed with them in grades 4-7. I like a few of their songs now.|`|LuK19ZFPaa	new album in april  theyll probably toue for that  theyre great live  i like their old stuff, new stuff is mediocre, ive been listenting since i was 4 which was in 96. anyone who started listening because of american idiot is a loser|`|dfUHVcEwaa	1. Dont know    2. Dont know    3. I have seen a taped concert thing and they sound pretty good live. Put on a good show too.    4. I did like them, but not so much anymore|`|6vgTVPtEaa	1. i read a maginzine and i think they are    2. maybe when they get they touring going    3. idk i havent seen them live before    4. i think i was in 5th grade or 6th and im now 9th bcuz i like their type of music and they are a good band to listen too also and i think u should listen to their old cds they are also good if u havent yet :-)|`|3aNQIoplaa	1. Yes, they supposedly have finished recording their new album, but still have a few months of mixing and mastering to do before it is released. Most likely not April, like someone said above. Sometime after that probably, but nothing has been confirmed yet.    2. Probably not anytime soon. I'd say you'll start seeing more of them around summer time when they start promoting their new album.    3. Yes, they are amazing live. I've seen them in concert a few times.    5. I've liked them for about 13 years now. Why? Because they don't produce the same crap over and over with every album. They do something different and don't follow along with the same crap everyone else makes.      To keep updated with everything Green Day, go to The Green Day Authority. Its a fan website and they make updates all the time.|`|3741eaacaa2e86184f69536884e1b3f5aa	1. Yes. An album is due out in mid-2009!  here's 2008 at a glance of their activity: http://www.greendayauthority.com/2008.ph...  the Foxboro hot tubs (latest side project): http://www.greendayauthority.com/foxboro...  AP Magizine articles from december (click the pages to read them): http://www.greendayauthority.com/news/sh...  And finally the unfolding 2009 Album Info: http://www.greendayauthority.com/newalbu...    2. Most likely, after the release of their new 2009 album, they plan on hitting the road for a World Tour.     3. YES they are amazing live- go out and buy Bullet in a Bible for previous concert footage, as well as looking up their thousands of youtube videos. ticket prices vary, but whatever the price the concert would be worth going to.     4. i've liked them for about 3 years. it seems like i've been a fan since 1989 though. i heard Holiday through a friend and went from there. i adore all their albums and side projects and appreciate them for the wonderful music that they make.

If I killed someone (I COULD/Would NEVER DO!) I would probally die right there. Have you ever seen those shows or movies where someone kills a guy and then a group of people kill that person and his/her loved ones? So the answer is no, I could not live with myself after commiting murder. It would be like the tell tale heart or what ever that book is called.

If I did I would be easily caught. But if I wasn't I would not be able to take the guilt. and it depends for what reason I murdered some one. If it was reasonable, I could live with myself. But if it was for revenge over a long time ago, or for buying the last whatever, or not saying "bless you" after I sneeze, then I would commit suicide the next morning or so. And to commit suicide, it would take me many attempts because I love life and I can't bear death, especially the death of myself.|`|AQhJJT91aa	For all those above that kill to protect your family... That's not murder. That is self defense, by definition.    Even when people take somebody elses life in war, in self defense, or accidentally, ; it haunts them for years and years.  Those that murder with no remorse have serious psychological issues to say the least.  Even some of the worlds worst killers are haunted by their actions.    I'm just kind of curious why you would ask such a question. Do you have something that needs to be discussed?  If you are planning on whacking somebody, this question is enough to qualify you for premeditated murder.  You will end your life by taking theirs.

eVt0qkT8aa	Let's see, I'lll answer as best as I can. As a Leo, you are a very proud person with lots of confidence. Then there's your Scorpio rising - your rising sign is how people see you, and with Scorpio rising, you are known as sexy and mysterious, with intense eyes.     Going by this, Leo (Fire - Sun Sign) + Scorpio (Water - Rising Sign) = Steam, I would have to say you would match with air signs such as Aquarius and Libra, and the fire sign Sagittarius.    EDIT: Moon in Aries: You are instinctive and spontaneous, and you form judgements instantly. Your enthusiasm, as well as your anger, is quite easily aroused. You may also be striked as self-absorbed. You are feisty, decisive, and competitive, but also selfish, irritable, and impatient. Quick-tempered and impetuous, you make sure your needs are tended to at the earliest moment as possible.    Mercury in Leo: Dramatic, dignified, ambitious, you are a opinion leader who is confident in your opinions, and you express yourself vividly and think creatively. You usually see the big picture, being persuasive, eloquent, and organized in your thinking. However, you are also dogmatic, boastful, and unreserved in your enthusiasms.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	An Aries or another Leo.Or Maybe even a Taurus because of your rising sun.|`|qNKK4hLDaa	ME, me dear!|`|S2uAq7i4aa	Just like Top Secret!

I also have Scorpio Ascendant and have found that I enjoy sex thoroughly with them. Male and Female. My first female lover has Scorpio Rising/Leo Sun (10th House) yet she has the cardinal sign of Libra as her Moon. You should look to the Ascendant that stands up and respects Scorpio. Look at the HOUSE position of the Sun to let you know what type of individual best suits your Leo personality. Look to Venus and Mars to figure out what type of people "catch" your attention and then look at the aspects to determine what someone would have to do to KEEP you. :-)|`|OCc1si6Gaa	Astrology is the system of belief in which knowledge of the relative positions of celestial bodies is used to interpret and organize information about personality, human affairs, and other terrestrial matters.    Since earliest known records in about 2300 BC; astrology has played a role in the shaping of culture and politics throughout history. In fact, despite the modern conceit that we live in an "enlightened, scientific and literate society", nearly every major newspaper in the world contains an astrological horoscope section.    Unfortunately, Astrology is bullshit.    4300 years ago, when the ancient Babylonians invented the practices we now call astrology, they were earnestly trying to understand the world they inhabited. The Babylonians did not have anything resembling the scientific method of thought, but did the best they could.    Babylonian astrology was based on the "theory of divine governance". This theory encompassed the belief that events on earth, including famines, harvests, wars and treaties were the direct result of the will of a large number of gods. These gods were active and regular agents affecting earthly and human matters, unlike the distant or non-involved "God" that many modern Christians may recognize.    Starting from the Babylonian's observation that the fertility of the soil depends upon the sun and rain from the heavens; and that mischief and damage done by storms and floods were to be traced likewise to the heavens; the conclusion was made that the gods had their home in the heavens.    Observation of the night sky, coupled with the desire to predict important events such as storms, or crop failures led quite naturally to the early Babylonian astrology.    The Babylonians divided the night sky into small discreet regions, each the home of one of their gods. These regions, although renamed and reshaped since 2300 BC, are what we now call constellations. There are 88 constellations defined and recognized by the International Astronomical Union, these 88 regions of the sky encompass the entire sky visible from the surface of the Earth. This is obviously many more than the 12 commonly associated to zodiacal astrological star-signs familiar to every modern newspaper. To understand the significance of these 12 zodiacal constellations, its necessary to understand a little about the mechanics of our solar system.    the plane of the eclipticThere are nine Planets in our solar system, varying in distance from the sun, from the nearest, mercury, to the farthest, Pluto. (or Neptune, as Pluto has recently be reclassified, losing its planetary status) The planets in our solar system all orbit the sun in the same direction, and in the same plane. That is, all the planets follow orbital paths which are more-or-less in line with each other, defining a flat plane with the sun at its center. This is called the "plane of the ecliptic" because if three celestial bodies, such as the sun, the moon, and the earth briefly "line up" creating an eclipse, it is on this plane.    From the surface of the Earth, the plane of the ecliptic can be drawn across the sky as an imaginary line. Observations of the planets and the sun will always be along this imaginary line.    The constellations of the zodiac are defined as those which are bisected by the plane of the ecliptic. A person's "zodiacal sign" is the constellation in which the sun is found on the date of their birthday.    constellation of Ophiuchus The zodiacal constellations are:       1. Sagittarius     2. Capricorn     3. Aquarius     4. Pisces     5. Aries     6. Taurus     7. Gemini     8. Cancer     9. Leo    10. Virgo    11. Libra    12. Scorpio    13. Ophiuchus        Some people might be surprised to learn there are not twelve, but thirteen constellations in the zodiac. In the 2nd century AD a Greek astrologer and mathematician named Ptolemy published a set of astrological tables which omitted the thirteenth constellation, Ophiuchus. Ptolemy's 12-sign astrological table was based on the sun spending an equal amount of time in each constellation, corresponding to the 12 months of the calendar. He is known to have used the then-2400 year old Babylonian astronomical data. As a popularizer of horoscopic astrology, Ptolemy may have sacrificed accuracy for simplicity.    Whatever scientific merit there might have been in the still-developing field of astrology, Ptolemy's tables mark a point of divergence from the later science of astronomy which replaces it. Present day horoscopes published in newspapers still use the same tables.    If people still believed that events on Earth were controlled by supernatural beings living in the sky, modern horoscopic astrology would have a significant problem.    That Ptolemy's tables were based on second-millennium BCE Babylonian data brings up the issue of precession. The Earth, as most people know, not only orbits the sun once per year, it also rotates on its own axis once per day, similar to a spinning to

AA12025213	Well the thing about drumsticks you have to realize is this. Drum heads AND drumsticks both vibrate and produce a frequency. Which mean they produce energy. 99% guaranteed of why you are breaking sticks and heads is because of how you hold the sticks. It sounds like you are gripping them too strongly, practice different techniques that let the sticks oscillate, rather than taking all of the energy from the strike, and hurting your hand, as well as damaging your heads and sticks.     About the AHEAD sticks, personally I don't like them or use them anymore (I used to when I was first starting out, I thought they were the cat's pajamas!). The core of the stick, which includes the handle, is covered by a plastic cover, and a tip is more or less forcibly screwed down till it extremely tight, forcing all of the kinetic energy to go back into the core, and into your hand. AHEAD sticks are all but unbreakable. When I used them, I'd break a pair after about a year of use.    Wooden drumsticks are more ergonomically friendly, cost way less, and give you way more tone and feel than you'd ever imagine. Ever since I first developed my technique to allow the sticks and heads to oscillate (which also includes mutes, mufflers, and tape for heads - don't do it!), I haven't broken a stick or head once, and it's been years.    I hope this helps.    Andy Sutton|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Well your rim shot and cross stick will sound funky with an aluminum stick. You need to figure out what is wrong with your technique if you are breaking sticks like that. We all break sticks from time to time but you are doing something seriously wrong if you're breaking that many. You are either playing too hard, all to common with beginners or folks that never took lessons and learned that hitting hard is not the answer, or you are hitting too much rim.
88aab67b8f8f9204a8c653c60f437085aa	They live in Coto de Caza near Ladera Ranch. I think Lynn lives in Newport beach and Lauri lives in San Clemente. Laguna Beach is not that far out in the Orange County line. I live in Laguna Hills which is about 15 minutes from Ladera Ranch and 10 minutes away from Laguna Beach. We are considered to by Southern Orange County. They are all from Orange County...most of them live in Coto de Caza.     http://www.orangecounty.net/html/cities....|`|ixHwF4apaa	ok i donot know|`|6c519adeb7e7fde2ea538370b524d613aa	Ok I don't know but thanks for the explanation.|`|E70A7aqcaa	Ahh.  It is so good to hear some critical thinking about such nonsense programs as "housewives".  It's similar to my thinking when I watch all the History Channels and Discovery Channels.   Thank you for sharing your refreshing insight.  God Bless you.|`|2gxYEgZKaa	those shows are fake dude hate to say it...    you would think the networks should know we could figure stuff like that out!    those "real housewives" probably live in LA   (hollywood) or some of them maybe just moved there....    they cant say they are from the O.C. ... there fakes... but yet there still on the air... thats the answer lol|`|1147fde3deacb66e77c8c89ab71de202aa	they live in coto or something i always remember them saying they live in coto (not sure how to spell it though) so there you go.|`|ceWzhN2daa	I would go to Wikepedia...well, I did, but you can go and get further info... the first part says the show was initially set primarily in the gated community of Coto and followed the lavish livestyles of five "housewives" and their families who resided within Coto McMansions, with the exception of one housewife (Lauri Waring Peterson), who lived in comparatively reduced financial circumstances in a Ladera Ranch townhouse. This housewife exception to the rule was used in season 1 to directly contrast with the money-laden existence of the other four housewives who lived behind the Coto gates. However, the show has since expanded its filming locations to include Rancho Santa Margarita, Ladera Ranch, San Juan Capistrano, San Clemente and Costa Mesa and downplayed the exclusivity of living behind the gates of Coto.[3] For example, the opening credits removed the commentary saying, "There's a mystique of living behind the gates."

E1Tbhswbaa	To modulate is to change keys.  I do not know if that was what your mother meant to say, and I am a bit confused by the wording, but I will try my best to help.    To make it easier to switch keys (or modulate) I found that it was a lot easier after singing harmonies in my caroling group because majority of the harmonies start a third higher or lower.  Everyone would find there harmony by going a third higher or lower than the last person.  You could try something similar.  Get pitch pipe and practice creating harmony to the last note (could do this on a piano as well).  Then of course there are always vocal exercises you could do as well.    As for your voice getting higher, are you talking about the key you sing in or the sound quality of the mic.  Because when I sing and it is recorded it always sounds a little higher and kiddish.  And by singing lower do you mean you went down octive?  And just for tips in general, get a good distance from the mic. Not too close, but not too far.  You want to be heard, but you do not want to eat the mic. or get feedback (such as the mic. picking up your breathing).  I hope this helped.|`|49e1c1ffbe5862c9dafc300cae17824caa	You need to treat the microphone like it is an ice cream cone and hold it really close to your mouth. Then the K.J. can adjust it from there.

gJhwH335aa	I usually goes to onemanga to read a particular series. However, if I was looking or searching for a particular series, I will go to mangafox instead.    Onemanga pros   - The site are easier to navigates compare to mangafox. Each chapter are organized properly and for a first time user, they will know which button to clicked on.  - I heard that onemanga has faster updates compared to mangafox.  - The sites load faster than mangafox.     Cons  - There isn't a lot of manga on that site. Most of the manga you can find there are the popular series.  - The search button doesn't do much help. Not detailed enough.    Mangafox pros  - Variety of manga to be choose from. They obviously has a lot more manga than onemanga.  - Search button is really helpful.  - They separated the manga into volume and chapter. (this is probably just me though)    Cons  - The updates are inconsistent. Sometimes it takes a lot of times for them to updates a particular series. Sometimes they just drop a particular series without even completing it.  - You have to click 'next page' button instead of clicked on the page to go to the next page. Like Queenie said, it's a 3X clicked for mangafox.    All and all, if it comes down to read online. I prefer onemanga.com. However, nothings beats reading it by the actual books though. I usually went out and look for a new released of manga to buy instead of looking for the series online.  http://img134.imageshack.us/img134/8830/...  (sorry for the mess)|`|MZFIJf1zaa	Onemanga|`|ryLbKatoaa	I prefer mangafox's selection, but onemanga is simpler, easier, and doesn't have that annoying thing where it takes 3+ clicks to turn the page because the scanlater made them too big.

64491cf5ed73ad038115b2f4040d2213aa	They went to a lot of bars lol    In "Games People Play", they went to a sports bar where they met Don Seglar (played by John Dossett of Broadway's "Gypsy"), an importer of Mexican handbags. Samantha hooks up with him.  Watching a basketball game, his aggressive talk turns her on ("We need to penetrate! Drive to the basket!"), and after a Knicks victory, she also scores in bed with him. However, Samantha soon realizes that when his team loses out, so does she. After patiently waiting out the season, she dumps him when she learns that he's also a baseball fan!    This same episode also features Jon Bon Jovi - but it was Carrie who met him at her shrink's office.|`|DWElTA36aa	do you know the episode? that'll narrow it down considerably.|`|VwJQZfQJaa	yeah,people are definitely gonna want to help you with that attitude.

o88qLRgbaa	Well, there is this long quote by Denis Leary:    Most people think life sucks, and then you die. Not me. I beg to differ. I think life sucks, then you get cancer, then your dog dies, your wife leaves you, the cancer goes into remission, you get a new dog, you get remarried, you owe ten million dollars in medical bills but you work hard for thirty-five years and you pay it back and then -- one day -- you have a massive stroke, your whole right side is paralyzed, you have to limp along the streets and speak out of the left side of your mouth and drool but you go into rehabilitation and regain the power to walk and the power to talk and then -- one day -- you step off a curb at Sixty-seventh Street, and BANG you get hit by a city bus and then you die. Maybe.

a9vbJeOzaa	I get what you are totally saying!  At first I thought it was like a "sign" or had some sort of meaning.  It's NOT!  The real reason why you always notice them is because you are aware of the numbers 1124.  They have a meaning to you and your mind is subconsciously looking for them.  It's kind of like when you learn something new, and then you suddenly see it everywhere more often.  Take for example, the numbers 69 or 420, if you didn't know what they meant, you would never be aware of them.  Try to pick another number and make your mind really aware of this number, you'll be surprised how often you see it again!|`|EMcwjhZ4aa	Wow it's so crazy you asked that question...

Since earliest known records in about 2300 BC; astrology has played a role in the shaping of culture and politics throughout history. In fact, despite the modern conceit that we live in an "enlightened, scientific and literate society", nearly every major newspaper in the world contains an astrological horoscope section.    Unfortunately, Astrology is bullshit.    4300 years ago, when the ancient Babylonians invented the practices we now call astrology, they were earnestly trying to understand the world they inhabited. The Babylonians did not have anything resembling the scientific method of thought, but did the best they could.    Babylonian astrology was based on the "theory of divine governance". This theory encompassed the belief that events on earth, including famines, harvests, wars and treaties were the direct result of the will of a large number of gods. These gods were active and regular agents affecting earthly and human matters, unlike the distant or non-involved "God" that many modern Christians may recognize.    Starting from the Babylonian's observation that the fertility of the soil depends upon the sun and rain from the heavens; and that mischief and damage done by storms and floods were to be traced likewise to the heavens; the conclusion was made that the gods had their home in the heavens.    Observation of the night sky, coupled with the desire to predict important events such as storms, or crop failures led quite naturally to the early Babylonian astrology.    The Babylonians divided the night sky into small discreet regions, each the home of one of their gods. These regions, although renamed and reshaped since 2300 BC, are what we now call constellations. There are 88 constellations defined and recognized by the International Astronomical Union, these 88 regions of the sky encompass the entire sky visible from the surface of the Earth. This is obviously many more than the 12 commonly associated to zodiacal astrological star-signs familiar to every modern newspaper. To understand the significance of these 12 zodiacal constellations, its necessary to understand a little about the mechanics of our solar system.    the plane of the eclipticThere are nine Planets in our solar system, varying in distance from the sun, from the nearest, mercury, to the farthest, Pluto. (or Neptune, as Pluto has recently be reclassified, losing its planetary status) The planets in our solar system all orbit the sun in the same direction, and in the same plane. That is, all the planets follow orbital paths which are more-or-less in line with each other, defining a flat plane with the sun at its center. This is called the "plane of the ecliptic" because if three celestial bodies, such as the sun, the moon, and the earth briefly "line up" creating an eclipse, it is on this plane.    From the surface of the Earth, the plane of the ecliptic can be drawn across the sky as an imaginary line. Observations of the planets and the sun will always be along this imaginary line.    The constellations of the zodiac are defined as those which are bisected by the plane of the ecliptic. A person's "zodiacal sign" is the constellation in which the sun is found on the date of their birthday.    constellation of Ophiuchus The zodiacal constellations are:       1. Sagittarius     2. Capricorn     3. Aquarius     4. Pisces     5. Aries     6. Taurus     7. Gemini     8. Cancer     9. Leo    10. Virgo    11. Libra    12. Scorpio    13. Ophiuchus        Some people might be surprised to learn there are not twelve, but thirteen constellations in the zodiac. In the 2nd century AD a Greek astrologer and mathematician named Ptolemy published a set of astrological tables which omitted the thirteenth constellation, Ophiuchus. Ptolemy's 12-sign astrological table was based on the sun spending an equal amount of time in each constellation, corresponding to the 12 months of the calendar. He is known to have used the then-2400 year old Babylonian astronomical data. As a popularizer of horoscopic astrology, Ptolemy may have sacrificed accuracy for simplicity.    Whatever scientific merit there might have been in the still-developing field of astrology, Ptolemy's tables mark a point of divergence from the later science of astronomy which replaces it. Present day horoscopes published in newspapers still use the same tables.    If people still believed that events on Earth were controlled by supernatural beings living in the sky, modern horoscopic astrology would have a significant problem.    That Ptolemy's tables were based on second-millennium BCE Babylonian data brings up the issue of precession. The Earth, as most people know, not only orbits the sun once per year, it also rotates on its own axis once per day, similar to a spinning to|`|mD7eAAoNaa	O that happens to me too! I see my bday, 9-23 everywhere, especially the clock. I ran a natal report the other day and I have a sign that is 9.23 degrees.

I don't if I totally believe it, because I think it might have some meaning to see your birthdate or whatever numbers a lot.|`|uel6NBOVaa	There was a time that whenever I would look at a clock it would say 8:07, without fail.

gDxMoBl9aa	Megadeth KILLS, I couldn't agree more.    What do You think of this song?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XWypbSKc...    I love it, it's been My song of the day|`|U48HUZ5Kaa	YEAH   Omg I freaking love Megadeth. People hate them just cause dave got fired from Metallica. Well I think Megadeths way better than Metallica. Dave is a better singer than James and hes a better song writer. I hope Metallica fanboys/fangirls would listen to the albums Countdown to Extinctincition and Peace sells...But who's buying. They would love Megadeth.     My friend was obsessed with Metalllica until I showed him Megadeth and theyr his Favorite Band.
kKEnTopqaa	golden was a pretty good song  i think they should make more but it shouldn't overpower the other fast tracks in the cd    btw, folie a deux is a really great album|`|1vCoaf08aa	I think they should all go "do you know what" with themselves like they did last night.|`|zZPbmxWkaa	Fall Out Boy makes songs?|`|R5YkSeLEaa	i agree, but don't tell anyone|`|ZoHLFcNCaa	I do but i am very satisfied with America's suitehearts|`|IW3Ilp7Taa	I agree|`|Ap8tyiUlaa	i think they need to stop making albums.|`|deSg50YPaa	No I don't think FOB should make another album at all.

5VHEcfp2aa	Lyrics seem really good...if you wrote this yourself then all I can say is Excellent. However I would love to hear it with someone singing it. That way I can really assess how great the lyrics really are    Add me on contacts...So I can hear this song one day in the future|`|N6cuuDAmaa	Awesome! Love it!!|`|roFGlldOaa	These lyrics really speak to me. Your referring to the wall as if it was your thoughts... and everything you think just sudden out from your head into your mouth.

vK9Vv9gjaa	I'm with you I only like it in moderation, when there is a slow part gradually leading to a very intense emotion in the music, kind of like a climax if you will. but to do it constantly takes the rush out of the music. and the rush is one of my favorite feelings I get from metal, where the hairs on your neck stand up, and you get that euphoric feeling that wow that is the best song I have heard in a while, and it seems that the song has a life of its own, like a predator out for a kill. so yes I do enjoy it a lot only when it needs to be there.|`|PF6yKkVDaa	Blast beats rule. I don't think it's necessarily the mark of a good drummer, but it sets death metal and black metal apart from other forms of metal. Gravity blasts are way more insane though. Brain Drill uses them a lot. They're almost unnecessarily fast.|`|1vCoaf08aa	I'm in between here.    They go great in certain sections of the songs they're performed in, but no need to over do it, like EVH does with tapping.    IMO, what makes a drummer "great" is how hard he plays and how much pride and enthusiasm he plays with.    I'll use this as an example, I LOVE TestAmenT, but, when Chuck started adding death grunts to their songs (I know he did it because of his voice deepening), I lost interest. The last album they did that I liked is Low.    Edit: Why thank you, lol, you know, I liked some of the songs off of Formation as well. I just feel like Low was the last album they stuck true with.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Carl Palmer is 100X the Drummer of any blastbeat Drummer that ever lived. Speed is not exclusive to talent in Music.|`|pVTevFJgaa	Well, I am not a drummer, so I don't know the technical side of blast beats, but personally I like them. But it all depends on the song, actually, and if it fits the sound. But usually, they make the song heavier and sort of hypnotic... So I like the atmosphere given by blast beats. But I admit that rythm other than blast beats is good too.|`|RKMWeMk9aa	It depends on how good the drummer is, Mike Smith of Suffocation for example is one of the best drummers when it comes to blast beats.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PATEO4Uo...|`|u8ia6oKxaa	well, as you know I dig the drumming in songs and I can appreciate drummers stamina and skill to Blast beat.  However, a BM song that blast beats the entire song is not interesting at all to me.  It is the most common in BM and Deathcore like you said, whereas DM whether it be brutal or Melo changes up the drumming more often.  So in general, I like the drumming in those two genres more than BM.      I will say that BM drummers are experimenting abit more than they used to in the past and spit out some interesting rhythms (or at least not so generic)      Krallice   http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fus...  Dark Fortress  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsoeBS1hG...    Dark New Day:  I love How MIke Smith uses his Blast Beats...He makes them interesting by adding them in when you don't expect them    ***edit:  Thanks KP...glad I can be a good source.  One of my fav drummers, Gene Hoglan never uses blast beats, but is so interesting with his drumming style and he has done drumming for thrash, death metal and black metal.  I remember reading once that he was asked to join Nile but declined....Would be interesting to see his style with them.  watch him groove  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrncbsLBt...    ***Migh: perfect example is I love Darkthrones DM album Soulside journey...great technical drumming and no blast beats...too bad they changed styles. he actually is a very capable drummer  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfN-l2jci...|`|3e6758fcfd02678034cc2b0ff260959eaa	yep, i love me a bit of blastbeats! like you say though, in moderation... that's why some black metal occasionally bores me *cough* Darkthrone *cough*... every song going by in a blur without any variation or dynamic...|`|qN5b8Qoiaa	I could care less. They sound good to me.|`|vIgicm8kaa	In my opinion, blast beats are annoying

Jesus never wore them  or did he spend collection basket money on fancy garb for religious ceremonies and then plead poverty. The Catholic Church excels when it comes to spending money on itself. If following the Golden Rule doesn't get you into heaven, then I don't know if I want to go there. Did you ever think, what happened to righteous people who died before religion created all the rules and regulations for getting into heaven?|`|eb7939afceea213fb37cb6c2a376ba3faa	Nope, still at the crematorium.|`|PY1glujMaa	We will not get the Ashes back till we beat the Aussies.

However, the couple of anime conventions I've been to (2 total) I went in cosplay 2 days and wore an anime shirt the 3rd. Cosplay definitely gets you a lot of attention. I got stopped by random people I didn't know for hugs/pictures/whatever. XD It's fun though, I don't mind.    The characters I went as are Haruhi from Ouran Host Club and Ash from Pokemon :D

7B2s7maWaa	Editing. :D    Muse are amazing they are an alternative/progressive rock band.  More alternative then anything though.  Matthew Bellamy is the vocalist,guitarist, and pianist.  Christopher Wolstehnholme is the backing vocalist and one hell of a bassist also keyboardist. Domnic Howard is the percussion player and drummer.   I will also tell you they are heavily influenced by amazing artists and bands including Pink Floyd, Radiohead, and Jeff Buckley.  Amongst many,many others.     As you know Muse is my favorite band, so I may go very overboard right now. :]    Recommendations  "Sing For Absolution"  "Plug In Baby"  "Invincible"  "Shrinking Universe"  "Unintended"  "Uno"  "Apacolypse Please"  "Pink Ego Box"  "Muscle Museum"  "Stockholm Syndrome"  "Time Is Running Out:"  "Map of the Problematique"  "Feeling Good"-Cover  "Supermassive Black Hole"  "Starlight"  "Micro Cuts"  "Exo-Polictics"  "Endlessly"  "Hysteria"  "Soldiers' Poem"  "Bliss"  "Falling Away With You"  "Assasin"  "Space Dementia"  "Glorious"  "Sunburn"  "Knights of Cydonia"    -Okay I'll stop now.|`|utTFiz3gaa	they're pretty awesome :)    very creative very talented they're as good as it gets :)    And Sab is SO getting the BA so i'm not even gonna try and put effort into this answer lol!    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTd6nyHuP...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig8W5zb6i...|`|JqqRFFsyaa	Supermassive Black Hole, and I knew of it/ liked it LONG before Twilight (a.k.a. piece of filth movie and piece of filth book) came out. I challenge anyone who only said Supermassive Black Hole to say the same.    City Of Delusion (a rather epic-ish song. Has nice acoustic guitar, orchestral instrumentation, and vocals)    Hysteria (just fun)    Starlight (heartfelt ballad)    Map Of The Problematique (very interesting guitar. Great drums)    Sing For Absolution (kinda trippy, but great)    It's been a while since I've listened to them, so I can't think of anymore at the moment. However, I do know they are great. I find Absolution to be more experimental, and Black Holes And Revelations to be more rockin'. I personally like BH&R more. Have fun!|`|zfadjiJVaa	They are good they are a mixture of techno and rock|`|Y0FBSSxZaa	Great band!

Here are the bands that are Emo:  Hawthorne Heights    Everyone else is NOT EMO.    Bullet for My Valentine are not Emo, they are Hard Rock/Metalcore. Three Days Grace are Hard Rock.  30 Seconds to Mars are close, but not totally.  Fallout Boy... well, they're just gay.     The rest are either Rock (Emery), Hard Rock (Papa Roach), Metal (Avenged Sevenfold), Alternative (Death Cab for Cutie), or Pop Rock (Fallout Boy).|`|N2O5uT9Paa	I would kinda.Idk why though i think its just theyre reputation around the world.|`|0Sk6uFQRaa	i think second hand serenade is emo  lyrics that wants you to slash your wrist|`|rGav3F9laa	underoath isn't emo   bless the fall isn't emo  saosin isn't emo  BMV MAYBE  emo isn't just the looks there music is emotional and deep|`|kTeYca4saa	Atreyu and Avenged Sevenfold are not emo..|`|rC22WjXHaa	It depends.      I think it's about the lyrics to be honest.  It's whatever you consider "emo" and whatever moves you.      If the lyrics are enough for you to really feel the song, it's emo.|`|mzhFrm5Taa	From a completely stereotypical view, yes alot of people would say that those bands are emo. But they're not.   Bands like Metro Station, All American Rejects, Jimmy Eat World, Boys Like Girls and Fall Out Boy all have way to much of a pop-like sound to them to be emo, and their lyrics are far from emo. Thats just a few out of the ones you mentioned.    The LYRICS are what makes a band emo, but the band itself doesn't have to be emo if they have like one song thats emo. The song itself can be emo, that doesn't mean in turn, the entire band and the rest of their songs have to be emo. Emo, emotional right, the lyrics are what symbolize that, take Welcome To My Life by Sime Plan for example, those particular lyrics are emo, but the band is not all emo, nor are the people in it. Do you see what I mean, like? The sound definitely does not define if a band or song is emo. Its all in the lyrics. Once again, one song, or even a few songs, being emo doesn't make the whole thing emo.    Image most certainly does not make the band emo. Wtf? Emo means emotional, image cannot be emotional, the lyrics and what the song is about can be emotional. The sound, perhaps, can be emotional, although that really only depends on a certain individual's opinion. Its all in the lyrics.    To be honest, emo is just another label anyway. Does it really even exist? Along with the other labels? Why feel the need to label something? Just take it for what it is. Forget about the labels.|`|F0DXUqMbaa	half of these bands would be insulted if you consider them emo  i know blessthefall hates being called emo.  well i think its the lyrics  i know HH has a lyric that says "so cut my wrist and black my eyes" now thats emo. some are emo because how they look i guess but never judge a someone on how they look. three days grace has a lot of depressing songs. like riot, and i hate everything about you. metro station?!? since when they are emo they are like powerpop-ish  and bullet for my valentine? emo? i dont think so theres maybe at leat 3 bands that are actually emo.|`|tKRLTmssaa	Brand New - no idea  All American Rejects - uhm not really  Fall out boy - there lyrics aren't really emo  Metro Station - nore are theres  Death Cab for cutie - no idea  Bless the fall - no -_-  Atreyu - noo  Avenged Sevenfold - no, there's nothing even slightly emo about them  Bullet for My Valentine - if you saw the people that went to both of the concerts ive been to of them,you wouldn't say they were emo  Emery - no idea  Jimmy Eat World - not really  Saosin - can't remember  Papa Roach - no,i don't get why you think there emo  A Static Lullaby - not really  Hawthorn Heights - yes, just listening to one of there songs is enough to make you emo  Story Of the Year - i wouldn't say so  The Used - maybe a bit  Underoath - no,whyyy would you even consider underoath to be emo  Within Temtation(temptation) - not listened to enough of there songs tto judge  Three Days Grace - depends on your view,but then they do sing about a song about pain   Boys Like Girls - a little bit?  30 Seconds to Mars - not really      i don't get how half of them could be classed as emo,there lyrics nore there songs aren't what people would usually class as emo,which is basically whiny and most people call things emo because of whiny lyrics,songs about hating life/wanting to kill themselves/or hating the parents and stuff like that  i'd say out of them, Hawthorne Heights is the only one that i actually would class as emo  i guess it depends how much you know about rock music, usually people just stick anything that isn't to there taste emo.|`|weXxqGjOaa	Some of those are emo, some are scene, some are pop/rock    Usuallly bands are defined by their look and lyrics.    So just follow the guidelines and see if they fit!|`|NMEG9ssfaa	More so, it's pretty much the way they look.   I had a friend, who rapped, but had long black hair, and a pierced lip. He had a myspace, but even with his raps, people would still call him emo, even though he really wasn't.  Normally though, it would be the sound...you know the "whiny" sounds and such would make people instantly thing of "emo".|`|JLahw0Hzaa	Yes.|`|E8go0osDaa	Emo bands aren't about the sound.  It's mostly the lyrics and maybe because the people in the band are emo.  But the only emo band up there  that I recognize is Hawthorne Hights.  Most of the others are metal rock and pop.|`|PJZRGsc3aa	The style portrayed by the band    how much emotion is used is put into the lyrics.      3DG, FOB,BMV,are considered emo    others i don't know    Atreyu,Emery, and Avenged Sevenfold aren't    Papa Roach has the emo style but not the songs.|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	None of the above.   It's image.|`|KEk728Gsaa	Yeah, I'd say those are emo bands. Every lyric to EVERY song is about how "she" broke "my" heart. Pretty depressing if you ask me.    You're gonna get a lot of answers claiming that emo isn't a real genre or that it died back in the eighties. Whatever.

I've enjoyed about 98% of the material I've heard from him (possibly 100% but I hate to think in absolutes if I'm not positive).  You have to give it up to the guy;  he's been relevant in the music industry for over 30 years now and does things his way (much like Neil Young) which I have great respect for.  I've never tried to dive deeper into his catalog though, possibly because I have no clue where to even begin.      Favorite song of his?  Cliched, but probably Alison.  And I love the version of Never Fall In Love Again he did with Burt Bacharach.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	I've always loved Costello,  MQ  Alison  take care  dave

lGzQtEH7aa	They are currently on hiatus, working on their solo bands ( Serj Tankian, Achozen, Scars on Broadway), but there is still a small possibility that they might reunite, Like lead guitarist Daron Malakian said, "if system fans are waiting for a new system album, they are going to turn blue and pass out, a new system album is out of the question for now". It sounds like System of a Down isn't going to be together for a while, But just remember there's a possibility they might reunite, so just cross your fingers and hope they do, because I know I am.|`|zfadjiJVaa	They Were on a hiatus but Serj said they could be over.|`|bWI43goqaa	The singer went solo,    sad i know man|`|rM2PY9mPaa	They didn't officially break up yet they're only on hiatus, but it's possible that they'll never reunite :(|`|yZT7m5Qxaa	SOAD are on an indefinent hiatus.|`|wOc4Dqllaa	For all intents and purposes, yes, SOAD is broken up.

AA10297143	Place a sleeping victim's hand in warm water and watch them wet themselves.  Also, put shaving cream on their dominant hand and then tickle their face with a feather.  They will rub the shaving cream in their own face.  Short sheeting the bed, but that won't work so much since they aren't asleep already and you likely aren't getting under the covers that way anyhow.  Have a sibling make noises from a location where they can't be seen.  Make the room feel haunted.|`|ZdIaVkIcaa	Gota give Aurelia a thumbs up, that's a good one.|`|oThluLJJaa	Duct tape somebody to the floor when they are asleep and them scream FIRE, FIRE!!|`|6tVY6RdRaa	get whip cream put it in someones hand while they are sleeping then tickle their nose     put a rubber snake in their sleeping bag    ~srry no more|`|cbd0d272f583e709a0dd23505e14d52aaa	Hot sauce on their lips while they sleep!|`|qtAeTxVLaa	Once I went to somebody's house and the people who were still up late  put other girls panties and bra's in water and then in the freezer.

No one denies that. People hate on 50 because he hasn't had any good albums since then.|`|lcIOB3mzaa	yeah i like it at it has good ratings and it went 10x plantinum|`|Dwyfm0Ljaa	I THINK IT WAS PRETTY GOOD|`|jvX36ryyaa	not only was and is it a good album, but you have to remember that when that came out it was that shyt.  everybody was bumping that shyt, the movie was hot too. and i agree on that part about underground stuff.  all these mainstream people started underground and just because they hit it big dont mean they cant do it, most times it means they did it best.  (although there are people out here like technique who refuse to sign to the major labels).  i think thats how jay-z is overlooked sometimes, just cuz he sold out a little people forget about his hard stuff from the streets|`|116206dba14d2e5042f6c2fef652190faa	Hell, I don't even like rap after the year 2000 and 50 Cent's GRODT wuz just what was needed at the time. Anybody who sez that wasn't a good album is frontin' and playin' 'emselves.|`|3beddc7a6066da65201291d4e65045ffaa	I don't think its a good album, I think it's an AMAZING album! It's a classic hip-hop record. I can go through every track on that album, and I never get tired of it. It was revolutionary bringing the street image back into hip-hop. I'm actually listening to it right now.    The problem is 50 hasn't done anything that revolutionary since Get Rich or Die Tryin'. These are My ratings:    Guess Who's Back: 9/10    Get Rich or Die Tryin': 11/10 (CLASSIC) Yes that's 11/10, it's an amazing album.    The Massacre: 8/10    Curtis: 6.5/10    The quality of his music has gone down dramatically. I own all his albums, and I can't deny he is starting to suck. He needs to step his game up, because the commercial aspects of his career is clouding his ability to write decent music. His new album, Before I Self Destruct, is starting to sound on par with Curtis, so I don't expect anything amazing from it. 50 Cent and his G-Unit empire are dead, and remember I was a hard-core fan. Now, I'm just an average fan, don't care much with what he's up to. Hope he can step his game up, but it seems like he doesn't care.|`|KoNHUcNUaa	It's the only 50 cent album i like.|`|8XT1Tvcvaa	It is a good album. I don't think it's a classic or anything, but it's far from bad. I'd give it a solid 4/5.

12QJ9QMRaa	One .... their Q&As    do we have similiar interests?  Are the Qs and Answers thought provoking?    Two.. their Demeanor.  Are they condescending in their answers, or do they come off as genuinely friendly.  Do they seem knowledgable or at least not liek they are Poseurs (aka, willing to admit when they dont know something instead of pretending they do and then pitching a fit to cover for it)    basically, those two criteria.  Also, of course, how often we cross paths.  I don't add people after one Question.  I want to see the body of work.  And if we seem to cross paths a lot, it would seem that having 2 or more people looking for similiar music woud be a good thing.

I usually add contacts if they give me good answers to my questions, but like Peaches said, it has to be more than one and they have to be good.  As for questioners, I only add them if I think they will continue to give great questions that make me think and research.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	I just like taking a chance on people, because I learn from everyone, and I've learned a lot about different things from my contacts.  take care  dave|`|YwtXSUAdaa	Every one of my contacts is from R&P, so it is if they like the same kind of music, if they ask good questions, answer intelligently, and know what they are talking about.|`|hkyPEMnuaa	interesting questions/answers|`|1WlnkqAVaa	If they add me first.

AA10993810	as far as a combination of all four components, i would say led zeppelin. to many in the music world, they are not only the greatest metal band of all time, but also one of the best blues bands of all time. page, plant, bonham, and jones, when on, blew other bands out of the water. this is no disrespect to the stones, who are a close second by a pubic hair. now for individual honors, in my opinion of course.   drummer : eric carr from kiss, listen to creatures of the night, and that album will tell you that he was the mvp of the whole album  lead guitar: jimi hendrix, he transcended guitar playing to heights never reached before or since  bass- jack bruce of cream, clapton's backbone  singer: sebatian bach of skid row, raw emotion and such a range that he sang on broadway in phantom of the opera for many years.|`|yUP05L2Iaa	singer ozzy Osbourne   guitarist slash  bass cliff burton  drums dave lombardo|`|hDeNKwNpaa	drummer i would have to say Rick Allen def leppard( he has one arm throw him a bone) guitarist i would have to say david gilmour Pink Floyd, john paul jones bassist led zeppelin, Steve Perry  singer when he was good  from journey, band grateful dead because of jerry|`|weGsz69baa	drummer; aaron gillespie. hes a cutiee.  guitarist; quinn allman. hes also pretty cutee.  bassist; nikki sixx. hes old, but he can still rockk.  singer; bert mccracken, hes cute & his voice is amazing.  band; the used. or underoath because theyre awesomely rad :D|`|oDUuAs9Raa	Drummer:Matt Frenette  Guitarist:Angus Young  Bassist:Scott Smith  Singer:Brian Johnson    Coz I said so...

uPDAmpdFaa	My recomendations won't sound sound entirely correct because you're not using a tube amp. It'll get you in the ball park though.     Ok, first thing you need to know is the guys in AC/DC use humbucker equiped guitars through clean marshall amps played very very loudly. Most of their sound and chunk is from the humbuckers and 12inch speakers breaking up from being played loud as heck. It's a very British sound so use a clean British setting and crank up your volume really high.     Your EQ settings need to emphisize the mids. Most human hearing is in the mids and all the good guitar tones are based around the mids. So have the mids around 10 or slightly less. Your highs should be rolled back to about 3-4. Highs create a nasty guitar tone that people really really hate to hear. So your highs need to be very low. Your lows should be fairly high. Set them to about 8-9.     You might want to try other settings. That's cool, but don't listen to people who tell you to scoop your mids. Scooping your mids is ALWAYS bad for a guitar player. The sound doesn't travel correctly in the air and removes most of the mids that human beings hear. If you ever play live people far away won't be able to hear your guitar if you scoop your mids. x_x|`|39UBhow8aa	i think angus young always had his settings at 12 o' clock.    not sure of the other settings, sorry|`|qpWStE5Saa	ultimate guitar .

Minidiscs never took was the fault of the music industry. The discs were too expensive. Minidiscs were for a niche market like DAT or DCC. They were as exclusive as SACD is today.<br>  <br>  Minidiscs were a format which had no advantage over compact discs. I think the copy restrictions are a problem too. Who buys music cdrs for instance or stereo systems which copy cds. When computer cd writers give you full control?  Ipods are such a success because of the mp3 format which has no drm.|`|GdsBrHIdaa	ya, i remember i got one...<br>  back then it was really great, i remember i went looking around our house for discs to play on it,<br>  maybe they didnt catch on bcoz thrye too clumsy and a little large to carry around, annoying since it was considered a portable device...<br>  hu knows maybe theyll catch on again when all the ipods and cellphones in  the worlds gets broken one day and all people will have for entertainment will be those silly little players, hahaha...|`|dF8SQdgbaa	I agree with what everyone has said, gone are those retro days of the "walkman" and "discman" my mum had a walkman that I used to borrow it was a pain trying to get my music onto it so I'd just listen to the radio on it lol that was all part of the fun it's way too easy now :3 hell I'm an avid fan of all of that old stuff and the new. :D|`|AA12286468	downloading music to an application rather than using casettes was considered more technologically "forward thinking"<br>  <br>  ......think VCR vs Betamax|`|vCtCW8ODaa	i do lol and i still love mine... one AA battery lasted  forever, someone told me they would have loved to get one but mp3 players were so much cheaper|`|0ece3ea96233735c56393ae48382a64caa	But!

If you're dating a cheater who you know is a cheater, you kind of know what to expect, eh?|`|sbmzMVLraa	Dating a person you thought was committed and finding out he or her cheated.|`|Nc637a6laa	B of course...with A You kind of see it coming, but if someone is committed to You, You aren't expecting something like that to happen and it's much much worse!|`|XYnXpyrfaa	I say B. because if you they were a cheater then its your fault. but thinking they are committed and they are not sucks.|`|AA10265178	Definitely B would be the worst.|`|BLmfR6Ezaa	Definitely B|`|cmvum8YDaa	Probably B cause I wouldnt expect it...|`|lj3e3rE4aa	C) Dating you.|`|seqEdwwnaa	B by far!|`|AA11154080	B|`|f79c26b7044dd5c4e629f481f9756330aa	B|`|4TN6LSVQaa	b...|`|7xKcXa8Maa	The second one, it did happen to me|`|64cUxJn1aa	B...yer just askin for it with A|`|Id56wvCEaa	B) coz its unexpected whereas with A) you were more likely to be suspicious of him/her so would be nearly expecting it to happen<br>  <br>  ...... so ya... b) is worse|`|e607de785f45933493ee1b1163bf88d9aa	C) Dating a known tranny|`|AA10341358	B|`|ssEPGogqaa	B because it would be shocking.|`|q4pLY5F8aa	B.|`|q18xpBpPaa	defiantly A cuz you know what ur getting into|`|SkFgDxpEaa	of course (a) wouldn't be a shock if they are a known cheater.<br>  <br>  but i think most ppl will say (b)|`|L1DUcTtSaa	B, because you wouldnt expect it.|`|8j70Neqeaa	b|`|abx5VNsOaa	B and ...he better run fast.|`|qXkTatLMaa	Definitely B.  With scenario A, you knew ahead of time the kind of person that you were dealing with.  With B, you were blindsided.  Then you may even begin to doubt yourself for not seeing it, or develop trust issues with others.|`|acWyJ3t0aa	The answer for me would have to be B, because I would not bother to date a known cheater , because there would be no future in it for us or anyone .|`|trMsK86jaa	If they told me that they had cheated before we dated, i would have no problem whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Probably why i never tried to date my 2nd child-hood sweetheart - she never owned up.<br>  <br>  heh.|`|UokOCcn5aa	for me, dating a person you thought was committed and finding out he cheated would be the worse option.|`|sixm6Vlraa	B. I wouldn;t date a person if i had known they cheated, once a cheater always a cheater...|`|XwFGg5wPaa	b,|`|t7jiSmjVaa	Damn I was right. The worst thing for me was looking at your stupid question ! HA HA HA|`|Li9oemwqaa	B tis worse because i would have trusted them
04d81c107f433cebb6371d36ae227a9baa	I have been homeless 4 times in my life .. all due to being alcoholic ..<br>  I chose to drink rather then to be responsible .. I lost a good job, I lost all self respect .. I lost everything I had time after time ..<br>  <br>  The last time out being homeless .. I received frostbite, which lead to amputation of 1/2 of my right leg & 1/2 of my left foot on Feb. 1, 2005<br>  <br>  Since that time, I have been clean & sober, received my GED, attended a University .. I attend a recovery group for alcoholics & drug addicts and I reach out to them every single day to help prevent them from ever getting as bad as I was ...............<br>  <br>  I am currently writing a book on the Homeless People of Chicago !!!|`|vzWGml26aa	i was homeless because of no work. i had three kids and started to go from town to town in a car. i found shelter, gas, and food in every town. my dad would not help me at the time. <br>  i survived by begging for help. i never layed down for money. i finally found a man in a help center that gave me enough gas to get me back home. he also set me up with another person for a job and a home to stay in. i worked hard to get back on my feet. i would not eat for three days just so my kids could eat. <br>  after five years i was able to get into a home that was a rent to own. i payed that home off in three years. i worked two jobs to do it. <br>  being homeless is not fun. i did learn never to take things for granted. i save every penny and not buy things that i don't need. <br>  it was a life experience i care not to go through again.<br>  as of this day i have in the trunk of my car, a tent, canned food, and a five gallon can of water. that is just in case i am homeless again. <br>  my kids are grown now. one works in a bank as a head loan officer, the other is a preachers wife, the boy is in construction. they learned from that experience as well.<br>  i can't go on, it hurts to think on the past.|`|b48oRznUaa	I haven't been homeless, but there is this guy called col who is homeless, and he hangs out during the day in the underpass near my house, <br>  <br>  his a cool guy, his parents kicked him out for being gay (his 18)|`|nnOVIOV9aa	Homeless?  No, thankfully.  And I have known a few, although their homelessness was short lived.|`|2KI7LxUXaa	well our family stayed with family memmbers that were abusive and thats all we had untill my dad got a job again this was 5 years ago maybe.... we have come a LOONG way!|`|MH391VQPaa	I have never been homeless Kath, but I really feel for the kid's and adults that is homeless.......xxxx|`|m6Ih7DHYaa	i spent 3 years living with friends off and on did not have a place of my own|`|0191j9waaa	i m lucky and never been homeless, so do my good friends!|`|LmARYQxcaa	Yes, in one felled swoop, no home, no car, no job...just me and the kids looking like deer eyes in the headlights of a car.  It only lasted about a month.  On the second day of that month I had a job vacuuming cars at the car wash while I looked for a job.  We were fine 3 months later and the first bit of money I had that was extra saw me buy a tent.  When we walked out of the store with it I told the boys that life may be cruel again and just in case we had a place to live.  God is good...we only went camping in that tent and have replaced it with another that looks like a palace when we put it up.|`|RZetcwalaa	When i was 15 i started taking solvent... then my parents found out and made me stop, however this sent me a bit off the wall, so i started running away for a few days at a time, then after coming into some money i bought a passport from a freind and ran away to france... (i live in the UK)<br>  <br>  I was there for about a month running away from the police, getting caught then being put in foster homes, having a shower and climbing out the windows, i escaped seven times... all the time i stole, stole and stole...<br>  <br>  I stole tents sleeping bags, clothing and a whole load of cheese and chocolate... Eventually i agreed to get on a plane back home, but then upon arriving in the uk refused to go home, being fifteen i was to young to move to a hostel and social services refused to pay money for a B&B for a couple of weeks because they thought i would run away, so they gave me a five pound note, and five pounds in food vouchers and told me to return in a week for more...<br>  <br>  I was homeless for another two weeks in my hometown before they finally paid B&B till i was 16 and could move into a hostel... <br>  <br>  It was one of the most liberating experiences of my life, i felt completely free, just me my CD player and a bag, the shops were mine to steel from, the open road was my goal... <br>  <br>  I kind of think of it as my glory days... but now i think back to it i was physically and mentally a mess, i had holes in my shoes because i hadnt taken them off for weeks, i had worn the same clothes for a month and a bit, i probably stank, and was mentally deluded...<br>  <br>  I do intend to wander again, but this time ill be old enough... | guess it is a very free experience and i have met alot of homeless people who cant actually deal with a home, indeed after just few weeks on the street i was extremely reluctant to move into permanant housing again...<br>  <br>  Now i still have offically nothing, i am classified as homeless, and all my money comes  from the governmant, i went back to school and finished my exams, and am now studying A Levels in physics chemistry and maths...<br>  <br>  There you go, thats my story of homelessness, do i get best answer?<br>  <br>  Edit OMG i so win, people seem to confuse being homeless with crashing at a mates, once you have curled up in a toilet corner, once you have got so wet its taken you three days to dry out, once you have slept on benches in town centres and cooked from the sun then gone and stolen your dinner, thats homeless... <br>  <br>  You have never felt the real pain till it goes on for more than a week, first day is unpleasent, next day is cold and hungry... it just gets worse... <br>  <br>  I guess its one of those things you have to experience to even begin to understand... its a different kind of desperate when you actually have to curl up in a shed full of hay or a toilet with just your coat and some toilet paper for warmth... Then have to be completely silent when people come in and use the toilet...|`|iVP98E7maa	yes, i was homeless for a few months when i was younger...i surviveed luckily, stayed in abandoned werehouses if i couldnt find a place to crash...id be homeless right now if it wqasnt for my girlfriend|`|1y5IxCVyaa	A friend of mine was kicked out of him home on Christmas day when he was 18. His parents were Jehovas Witnessesand objected to him not following in their faith<br>  <br>  I don't see him so often but he seems to be doing well these days|`|D9IbINdFaa	Fortunately I've never been homeless.|`|YLvnFG9zaa	Kita's Mum was homeless for quite a long time... learnt her way around <br>  the uncles in the city... I met her after that ... but she had a lot of stories... some really sad... some uplifting...|`|iuWfp2fEaa	Fortunately, I've always been welcome back home whenever I've been in that situation.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	No...<br>  <br>  But I won a Journalism award a long time ago writing a feature story about a guy who went from making a six figure salary per year to being a homeless guy hell bent on destroying himself with Cheap Port Wine...<br>  <br>  The way he put it..."I fell in love with The Grape, and now that's all I ever care about..."<br>  <br>  Pretty sad, huh?|`|2PTlXs9zaa	Great question Kath - and what great humbling stories to read ^^^^<br>  <br>  No, I've not ever been. By the grace of God, I do have family to help me if I got into a bind such as that.|`|LpZXuTVCaa	My house burnt dow and was homeless and possession less for a short time. It is not a very good feeling.|`|mBlcD6sRaa	no never, thankfully
QLAthS7Iaa	I LOVE Gilly! I thought that kristen wiig did a fantastic job playing her and i hope she does it again!
uziFqSlgaa	I'm not sure but she could be just a random drawing or a fan drawing of a character. I suggest looking at characters of shoujo manga and animes (she looks as uf she would be in one) and see if she resembles any. If she is a fan drawing she will most likely look a bit different.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	It could even be fan art, and then there is nothing to go to|`|2ogFk4Amaa	I think it is from a movie but I cannot think of the name, sorry.

KxefTNDcaa	A man and his dad are driving in a car when another car hits them head on. They are both rushed to the hospital where the dad is ok but the son needs surgery. The surgeon gets ready but when they see the boy they say "I can't operate on this person! It's my son!" How is this possible(common WRONG answers are the dad is gay, it's the step dad)    You are a taxi driver. You pick up an elderly couple and drive them to their destination 2 blocks away and pick up a family of 4 there and drive them 4 blocks away. There you find 3 siblings and drive them 3 blocks away. What is the name and age of the taxi driver?    There is a frog, dead in the middle of an island. If he swims north, the distance to the mainland is 2 meters. If he swims south, the distance to the mainland is 3 meters. If he swims east or west, the distance is 4 meters. Which way does he swim?

Hot From N.O.        |`|KHC2oE8iaa	your questions will never have a straight answer since everybody's answer will be different. but i believe my favorite album would have to be juvenile's 400 degreez. his lyrics and style were just so damn different. he didnt set out to be a boss nor did he speak of being the ****. he just gave you hard down lyrics. and as far as the production goes mannie just killed it for me. to this day i still cant believe how well put together that album is.     man i love ugk but scar is an assassin. i'd never go against him. from the day he strated rapping you knew this dude would be a force to be reckoned with. only a clown or someone looking for attention would go against him.    and i to agree. numbers dont mean the album is the best lyrically or production wise. that's all hype right there. 11 million? preposterous. flo rida did 4 million off his single and/or ringtone sales. his album hasn't even gone gold yet. the lyrics were tired as well as the beats. all hype.

I prefer the dubbed way more than the subbed ( for once) The main character, Sona's voice is Tohru from fruits basket, Akito who is another main character in kodocha, is voiced by Kyo from fruits basket! AND Rei is voiced by Shigure in fruits basket. It's kinda weird, but awesome! Only the first season is dubbed though so don't get too disappointed when you have to start watching it in the really crappy subbed voices.There are, I believe like 102 eps. Only 51 in dub.

The mother was curious, so she asked her child where she got the five   dollars from.  The little girl replied: ''Tommy down the street gave me five dollars for   doing cartwheel while he sat in the tree.  The mother told her daughter: "Don't you know that Tommy is just trying to see   your panties."  ''OOOOhhhh'' said the little girl.  The next day the little girl came running into the house yelling, "Mommy, I   got ten dollars. The mother asked, "Where did you get the ten dollars from?"  The little girl replied, "Tommy down the street gave me ten dollars for doing   a cartwheel while he sat up in the tree and laughed."  The mother replied: "Didn't I tell you that he is...''  Before the mother could finish, the little girl said, ''Wait Mommy! I tricked   him, I didn't wear any panties today.''    A Cub Scout trop was half an hour late to its den meeting. The den mother   asked them severely, Why are you so late?  Oh, said one boy, we were helping an old man cross the street.  Thats a nice, but it shouldnt make you half an hour late.  Well, you see, said another boy, he didnt want to go.          A certain little girl, when asked her name, would reply, "I'm Mr. Hudson's   daughter." Her mother told her this was wrong, she must just say, "I'm Jane   Hudson." The minister spoke to her in Sunday school and said, "Aren't you Mr.   Hudson's daughter?"

What in the world is wrong with you? You think I don't know how to  fry a couple of eggs?  The husband calmly replied, I just wanted to show you what  it feels like when I'm driving."    all 3 of these made me laugh out LOUD ok    Harry and Paul are in a waiting room at a clinic to be tested for mental health Harry gets called in first and the doctor asks him what would happen if i poked your eye out harry replies i would be blind in one eye ok says the doctor and what will happen if i poke them both out harry replies i will be completely blind.Harry then leaves as he walks past paul he whispers the answers into Paul's ear paul goes in and the doctor says what will happen if i chop of one of your ears paul says i would be blind in one eye hmmm okay says the doctor what will happen if i chop off both of your ears paul says i will be blind in both eyes the doctor says how will this make you blind paul thinks for a second and says uh because your hat will fall off your head    lol    and    The headmistress of an all girls school asks the local vicar to give a talk on christianity and sex.

She asks him why is he staring and he replies, "I have a question to ask you but I don't want to offend you.     She answers, 'My dear son, you cannot offend me. When you're as old as I am and have been a nun a long as I have, you get a chance to see and hear just about everything. I'm sure that there's nothing you could say or ask that I would find offensive."     "Well, I've always had a fantasy to have a nun kiss me."     She responds, "Well, let's see what we can do about that:  1, you have to be single and  2 you must be Catholic."     The cab driver is very excited and says, "Yes, I am single and I'm Catholic too!"     The nun says "OK, pull into the next alley."     He does and the nun fulfills his fantasy. But when they get back on the road, the cab driver starts crying. "My dear child, said the nun, why are you crying?"     "Forgive me sister, but I have sinned. I lied, I must confess, I'm married and I'm Jewish."     The nun says, "That's OK, my name is Kevin and I'm on my way to a Halloween party."    JOKE 2  A blonde and a brunette are driving down the highway in a convertible. The brunette knows that she's speeding so she asks the blonde if there's a cop behind them. The blonde looks behind her and sees a cop and tells the brunette. The brunette then asks if his he's got his lights on. The blonde replies "Yes...No...Yes...No...Yes...No"    JOKE 3  Once there was a millionaire, who collected live alligators. He kept them in the pool in back of his mansion. The millionaire also had a beautiful daughter who was single. One day he decides to throw a huge party, and during the party he announces, "My dear guests...I have a proposition to every man here. I will give one million dollars or my daughter to the man who can swim across this pool full of alligators and emerge unharmed!"     As soon as he finished his last word, there was the sound of a large SPLASH!! There was one guy in the pool swimming with all he could...the crowd cheered him on as he kept stroking. Finally, he made it to the other side unharmed. The millionaire was impressed.     He said, "My boy that was incredible! Fantastic! I didn't think it could be done! Well I must keep my end of the bargain...which do you want, my daughter or the one million dollars?"     The guy says, "Listen, I don't want your money! And I don't want your daughter! I want the person who pushed me in that WATER!!!    JOKE 4  Why do banks charge a "Non Sufficient Funds Fee" on money they already know you don't have?

She walked up to the mirror and said 'I think I'm the most beautiful woman in the world' and it sucked her in. Then the next day a blond walked into the bar. She walked up to the mirror and said 'I think...' and it sucked her in.      JOKE 6  There was once a very prim and proper older lady who had a problem with passing gas. Since she came from a generation when people didn't even talk about this kind of problem it took a long time for her to seek help. Finally, however, she was persuaded to consult her family doctor.     After she filled out all the proper forms and had waited about 20 minutes in the waiting room the doctor called her into his office, leaned back in his chair, folded his hands into a steeple and asked her how he could help.     "Doctor," she said, "I have a very bad gas problem."     "A gas problem?" replied the doctor.     "Yes. Yesterday afternoon, I had lunch with the Secretary of State and his wife and had six, um, er, ahhh...silent gas emissions. Last night, I had dinner with the governor and his wife and had (BLUSH) four silent gas emissions. Then, while sitting in your waiting room I had five silent gas emissions! Doctor, you've got to help me! What can we do?"     "Well," said the doctor thoughtfully, "I think the first thing we're going to do is give you a hearing test."    JOKE 7  Three blondes are stuck on a desert island and one finds a magic lamp. They rub it and a genie pops out and gives them each a wish. the first blonde says, "I wish I was 10% smarter so I could get off of this island." Then he turns into a redhead and swims off the island. The second sees what happens and says "I wish I was 25% smarter so thatI can get off this island!" He then turns into a brunette, makes a raft from trees and sails off. Finally, the third blonde says "I wish I was 50% smarter so I can get off this island." He then suddenly turns into a woman and walks across the bridge.    JOKE 8    One morning the husband returns after several hours of fishing and  decides to take a nap.

Vj43BqcDaa	Ascendants don't affect fertility at all.  Leo, Gemini and Virgo are thought to be barren signs if they are coupled with a moon in Sagittarius or Aquarius.  Despite believing in astrology, I regard this kind of stuff as a superstition only.  I really wouldn't worry if I were you.  My aunt is a Leo and she had five kids.  And barren doesn't necessarily mean infertile in this context, it just means one or two kids instead of six or seven.  You won't be barren because of your sun sign.  If you're concerned, get yourself checked out by a professional.|`|S2uAq7i4aa	My dad is a Leo and has 4 children.

BcHbEdliaa	Well, in the YouTube video you mentioned that one of your inspirations was Evanescence, and I can definitely hear a resemblance between that band and yours. For some reason at the beginning the song I was reminded of Joy Division with all the techno beats in the background, though obviously there isn't too much similarity in reality.    I couldn't find any artists I regularly listen to who sounded exactly like you guys, though the song I listened to reminded me a lot of some songs by the band T.H.C. It reminded me a little bit of Chainsuck, too, though not as much.    Sorry I couldn't be of more help; this isn't quite my genre. Hopefully that helps a little, though.    For criticisms, I'd say that your music does sound a little conventional. It sounds like it has promise, but it's a little too polished, too predictable. I loved the "ing" in the line "Only when I'm sleeping," where it sounded like you were going to do it about a half-step above the note you chose, but for most of the rest of the song nothing really stuck out to me in the same way. It's beautiful-sounding, but it easily slips into the background, not really catching my attention. Of course, that might be what you're going for. Anyways, those are my two cents.|`|wOc4Dqllaa	You sound like Evanescence or a (no offense) inferior version Annette-era Nightwish. You're neither bad nor original.    edit  Bubbles, I wouldn't really say Annette ruined Nightwish, but she could never replace Tarja. Annette's gonna be gone by the end of the year though, don't worry.    edit  I don't know for a fact Annette'll be gone, but she's apparently gotten a manager separate from the rest of Nightwish's (often a sign of a band member leaving,) she's had to cancel whole tours because of illness, and the whole band's been talking about "tension" between Annette and the rest of the band. I seriously can't see her being around for much longer... I really hope they find a good replacement, if Nightwish breaks up I'll probably die.|`|LuK19ZFPaa	sorry to say  but you have a terribly unoriginal sound|`|87deabd3c525e7aca518d4cbf44e4df0aa	You sound a bit like Eisley. A bit.  http://myspace.com/eisley|`|lxYWZc9caa	You really remind me of Evanesence|`|0SvNHWVXaa	i think annette ruined nightwish! now they just sound like a a rip off of after forever    on that note, you sound kinda like after forever    Edit: well there's nothing really wrong with after forever, their music is fine, i just don't think we need another copy. And she will???? i really hope so! That makes me happy again. i mean really, it changed their entire sound!
p7UcyGYFaa	Hanon is a finger-strength and dexterity specific; it relies on exact fingerings.    Czerny tended to write his exercises to address weaknesses in individual students, and would do so as pieces that could be played, sort of a real-world application.  There probably isn't a specific fingering involved, though there may be only a few that actually work well.  Experiment a bit.      By the way, I strongly caution you against learning everything by it's fingering. It's useful, but as you become more advanced you'll find that shaping a phrase correctly, or bringing out a voicing is going to trump what might seem "correct" fingering. It's a ways down the road,  but if you rely on a play-by-numbers routine, you'll wind up with the exact problem you're having now...an inability to adapt to an unfamiliar situation.

He was carrying his little Scotch bottle in the left shirt pocket just in case. Suddenly, a robber appears and threatens him with a gun. The Scot gets scared, and the attacker shoots, aiming towards his heart, and then runs away.   The Scot falls down, puts his hand on his left pocket and feels something wet. He cries, ''Oh my God! I hope it's blood!'' '     A cowboy rode into town and stopped at a saloon for a drink. Unfortunately, the locals had a habit of picking on strangers. So when he finished his drink, he found his horse had been stolen. He went back into the bar, handily flipped his gun into the air, caught it above his head and fired a shot into the ceiling. ''WHICH ONE OF YOU SIDEWINDERS STOLE MY HOSS?'' he yelled.   No one answered.   ''ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA HAVE ANOTHA' BEER, AND IF MY HOSS AIN'T BACK OUTSIDE BY THE TIME I FINISH, I'M GONNA DO WHAT I DONE IN TEXAS! AND I DON'T LIKE TO HAVE TO DO WHAT I DONE IN TEXAS!''   Some of the locals shifted restlessly. The cowboy had another beer, walked outside, and his horse was back! He saddled up and started to ride out of town. The bartender wandered out of the bar and asked, ''Say partner, before you go. . .what happened in Texas?''   The cowboy turned back and said, ''I had to walk home.''     An old farmer went to town to see a movie. The ticket agent asked, "Sir, what's that on your shoulder?"   The old farmer said, "That's my pet rooster Chucky, wherever I go, Chucky goes."   "I'm sorry sir.", said the ticket agent, "We don't allow animals in the theater."   The old farmer went around the corner and stuffed the bird down his pants. He returned to the booth, bought a ticket and entered the theater. He sat down next to two old widows named Mildred and Marge.   The movie started and the rooster began to squirm. The old farmer unzipped his pants so Chucky could stick his head out and watch the movie.   "Marge", whispered Mildred.   "What", said Marge.   "I think this guy next to me is a pervert.", said Mildred.   "What makes you think that", asked Marge.   "He unzipped his pants and he has his thing out", whispered Mildred.   "Well, don't worry about it", said Marge, "At our age we've seen them all."   "I thought so", said Mildred, "But this one is eating my popcorn!"|`|Pa0jmm1Yaa	ok  this man came home from work really late  his wife was already dressed up waiting for him  when he came in the door  she roughed him up  and demanded he take her some place really expensive  so he took her to a gas station

eblcLGubaa	Okay, I'm going to pretend this question hasn't been asked and answered a million times before here and tell you what you want to know. It's a long, gruelling battle if you want to make it to the top, so be prepared to shed blood, sweat and tears. Figuratively.    First become a sort of celebrity in your local area. You need to be popular with the people who live near you before you can get out onto the global stage, because they are the ones who will help you. Take a trip into the center of your town and look at what places may need acts. Let the owners know that you're available. Annual festivals such as craft festivals, malls with regular store openings and live music restaurants/bars are places that will always need acts. Check out what celebrities are touring near you and call up asking to be the opening act - but make sure the celebrities are your style. It's no use a country singer opening for a heavy metal or hip hop act, because none of the people there will be interested in you. Talk to local journalism projects about writing about you.    Open a Myspace, YouTube, Twitter, etc. account and update it regularly. Keep in touch with your fans and they will stay loyal. You're going to keep doing these two things right up until you hit the big time, and if you're grateful to your fans then you may even keep doing the second.    Get yourself represented by an agent and manager (manager optional). They will help you get more and bigger gigs and manage publicity and finance. They should be advertised in phonebooks and magazines/newspapers.    Record a demo CD. You don't need to hire out a big expensive recording studio to do this - a good quality desktop microphone will do the job just fine. Start handing out CDs at your "concerts", along with other merchandise. Don't forget to do this online, too!    Create a promo package which includes your demo, a photo, a bio and a list of the gigs you've played. Send it to record companies with your and your agent's contact details (ie; email addresses). About two months later send a followup email, but DON'T ask if they liked it or not. Also avoid calling the label - never a good idea as it's awkward on both sides. Remember to check the website of the label beforehand and their demo policy - some labels will not accept unsolicited demos.    If they like your stuff, they will ask to sign you (but remember to hire an entertainment lawyer before signing anything!) and if not, keep trying at other labels. Remember to update your online profiles, your demo CDs, your promo package, everything, it will keep you current.|`|ZbEF9KoXaa	sing everywhere so people here you someone that hears you may be important to the music Business.  or  american idol  or  youtube video|`|Sbmte7psaa	put a video on youtub

wA8Dyhq7aa	Louis Armstrong once said there are only two genres of music:  GOOD music and BAD music.|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	The best way is to get used to different genres one by one. That's when you'll see the differences, so get another person to tell you bands of a certain genre and you'll finally get it. Wikipedia might have something that can help you too.|`|5b218420f6e58d52278efc9527f29a95aa	I don't bother with genres. Too hard, too touchy.     When someone asks what I listen to, I tell them the bands, not the genres, because the classification of bands into genres can get really subjective. The genre you find an album under at a record store might not be the genre you find it under on iTunes which might not be the genre the band classifies itself under.|`|CTQNPj56aa	its hard to tell you without putting in a lot of detail(which would take me days to explain)  however metal and rock can vary in characteristics since there are so many types of each    and pop usually sounds gay, doesn't have many instruments, and usually involves more vocals|`|uhZ38xYkaa	Rock vs. Pop    Rock: Classified by riffs according to the mostly occuring E string and 6-7 drums, it uses sliding open which sounds more...whatever that word is.    Pop: Although sometimes it does have a guitar in it, it is the beat at which it is played.  For example, "Let it Rock" involves guitar but plays through some parts of the song and plays closed, unlike a rock song like "Prowler", it uses the more 'greasy' part of music in Guitar terms.|`|WVb7Jnp2aa	if you want to know what genre a specific metal band is check here:  http://www.metal-archives.com/    It makes it much easier to tell which genre it is.     the difference between rock and pop and metal is:  Pop is (for the most part) a genre that is associated with making money. It is "poppy" and there is a lively characteristic to it, making it catchy. The main point of most pop is to make a catchy tune that people will buy, most (but not all) pop artists are more interested in making money (at least today, not true in the past)    Metal:  There are so many different genres of metal its hard where to start. It could be said that the lyrical content of heavy metal is much more fantasy than rock lyrics. The guitars are usually heavier and more distorted than rock music. it is the genre of the three that is least likely to have a band thats goal is to make money, as it is the hardest to become popular in. It is influenced by jazz and the blues, at least originally.     Rock:  rock is somewhat in between the two. Much like metal it gets influence for country and blues. there is a more heavy aspect then pop music, and the vocals are usually sung or sometimes (in the case of some indie bands Theory of a deadman and Nickelback come to mind) They sorty of sing with the throat.     Ah hope that helps, make sure to check out the metal archives though

YsY1bFxpaa	When I started getting into them I bought Fever and absolutely loved it, then I got Pretty.Odd. and I was definitely surprised, but after I listened to it a few times it grew on me, and I definitely think Pretty.Odd. is a better album (my favorite of the year) than Fever lyrically and musically, because they took a huge chance and did what they wanted, not what people told them to do. My views on people saying Pretty.Odd. sucks is that they dont care about the lyrics, because it is so much more mature and adds a new dimension and shows the talent and versatility of this amazing band.(: I still absolutely LOVE both albums though!<br>  <br>  Panic<3|`|7nRom97Daa	have never heard of them, what genre of music?|`|MKW0sIYQaa	i would rather burst my own ear drums with red hot pokers then listen to them ta very much

N4FdoHhBaa	Have to agree with you that Brett Scallions belongs as vocalist. Both singers are good though.|`|yZT7m5Qxaa	Brett Scallions is way better than Toryn Green as being the singer for Fuel but that doesn't mean that Toryn Green isn't the better singer over all.|`|kYmrs6Rgaa	Brett Scallions by far, he's the original, Toryns' a great singer but Fuel will never be Fuel without Brett and Kevin Miller for that matter. I mean check out the album Natural Selection some excellent songs on there, Won't back down, Running away, Quarter, Down inside of you, Falls on me plus the Something like human album, Last time, Innocent, Hemorrhage, these are excellent songs, I've heard Toryn's versions of some of em an they are quite good but they're not a patch on Brett.  Reform the original line-up I say

I'm not so narrow-minded when it comes to music; I listen to many genres and I don't judge on images, but only what sounds good to my ear.  Even if you can't understand the appeal of something you should be acceptive of how everybody is different.|`|M8tAFRc9aa	I'm white and i love hip-hop.

(note half of them are white) Hip-hop isnt about race only the people who make it that way think that way   Instead of what kinda rims they be rollin' on. Since Biggie and Pac died hip-hop has dropped off a little bit. at least compared what it used to be.

I think people compare them because the music is somewhat similar.  also, the strokes were a major influence for arctic monkeys.      i honestly haven't heard anybody say that the strokes are better than arctic monkeys. honestly, they're about equal (except matt helders is better than fab on drums) in terms of musical talent.  maybe they say that just because the strokes have just been around longer|`|zflFYeyjaa	The Strokes. The Arctic Monkeys get a bit too much if you listen to them for too long lol|`|uG7OZ5aTaa	The Arctic Monkeys first album is one of the best albums of the decade. IMO the Strokes are not better.|`|wzkCSmF1aa	arctic monkeys for reals.  people say the strokes are better because they came first and theyre less popular than the arctic monkeys (and for some reason, people do judge a band based on popularity)  but when it comes down to the nitty gritty, its the arctic monkeys hands down for me.|`|zZPbmxWkaa	The Strokes.

They are all equally as good as each other especially the last one, Breaking Dawn. Have fun reading!|`|ddPDskkXaa	Well, I thought the book was pretty good. If you're a Jacob fan, than you'll love the book. However, if you're Team Edward, it won't some to your interest as much because Edward is gone for a majority of the book.   Also, you should probably read New Moon if you want to be fully prompted for the third book, Eclipse.

fIK9LBEuaa	Well really, if you don't feel confident then don't do it.     I was in the exact same situation as you actually, I went to a Death Cab for Cutie concert when they came to Detroit last June. My friend and I both had our licenses, but her dad needed their car, so she couldn't have it. And my mom wouldn't let me drive my car there since it was Detroit, and we ended up leaving the concert at 12:00. So, my mom ended up dropping us off and picking us up.    It wouldn't be bad if your dad picked you guys up and dropped you off even if you have your license. If your friends ask and you don't want to tell them that your dad won't let you drive the car.     Maybe your feelings will change by May, but if not, then just ask your dad.     And maybe since your friend can drive, he'll drive himself so you don't even have to worry about it.    Have fun! Enjoy the concert either way. (I'm going to see them in April too, it's going to be a great show)

vH2OF9z8aa	mega urgent leads to megahertz, but you like him for his Strength: Raw power. Health and physical fortitude. A surge of tremendous force. Recovery from sickness. Victory after apprehension and fear. The ability to face and overcome opposition brings the inner qualities of strength and forbearance. Delays and setbacks will be overcome.    The card at the top right represents how you see your partner. Three of Wands (Virtue): Personal fortitude and strength of character. Accumulated power set in motion towards a distant goal. The initiation of an enduring partnership based on absolute trust. Honor maintained in a time of desperate struggle. Taking full responsibility for a decision, and bearing the solitude of leadership.    The card in the center left represents how you feel about your partner. Page of Swords: The essence of air behaving as earth, such as a steady wind: The approach of an unexpected challenge, to be met with clear thought and just action. A person filled with an eager appetite for all matters of mind and logic. The gathering of information through unfaltering vigilance, careful examination, and subtle spycraft. The use of reason or eloquent speech to penetrate the veil of confusion and cut to the heart of the matter.    The card in the center right represents what stands between you and your partner. Death: A major change or transformation, possibly traumatic and unexpected. Freedom from the shackles of the past. A new beginning. Death coupled with rebirth, usually related to consciousness and lifestyle.    The card in the lower left represents how your partner sees you. King of Wands: The essence of fire behaving as air, such as lightning: A great and daring leader who inspires others to rise to challenges alongside him. An artist who can take hold of an idea and make it a reality through bold action. One who is forceful, charismatic, and honest, leading by example, but unafraid to invest authority in others. A dashing and magnetic personality, carrying authority naturally, and striking at the world with swiftness and grace.    The card in the lower right represents what your partner feels about you. Six of Cups (Pleasure): Opening your heart to the simple pleasures of life. Fond memories fuel the playful embrace of love and life. Experiencing the joy of youth and sexual innocence. Engaging in acts of gentle kindness. Harmony of natural forces without effort or strain. Meeting an old friend.    The card in the center represents the present status or challenge of the relationship. Ace of Swords: The seed of victory - perhaps as yet unseen. A challenge to be met and solved through the invocation of force. An opportunity to bring reason and intelligence to bear in the pursuit of justice and truth. An excessive power that must not be abused. May suggest new ideas or information that can reveal a solution to the problem at hand.|`|UQWusO1waa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR0AGrsCA...|`|45DyvK5Raa	a little crush isn't mega urgent

fx3gIRh2aa	Software:    For a while, my default audio recording & editing program was KRISTAL Audio Engine ( http://www.kreatives.org/kristal/index.p... ), I still use it for recording most of the time. You edit on up to 16 tracks, and put up to 2 effects on the each track. All completely free.    The effects that you can put on tracks are called VST's (Virtual Studio Technology), and although KRISTAL comes pre-installed with some, a really good website to find free ones is here: http://www.vstplanet.com/Effects/Effects...    Audacity ( http://audacity.sourceforge.net/download... ) is also a good piece of software to have on your machine just in case you would need the services it provides.    MOST IMPORTANTLY: The software I've recommended is completely free. However, if you want to do single-take multitrack recordings of your band (as opposed to layering the sound, where you record one track at a time), you're going to need to invest in a mixing board that you can hook up to your computer by way of a USB or firewire connection.

Also look up Flatt and Scruggs or Allison Krause and Union Station etc. Maybe something like "bluegrass pioneers" or "popular bluegrass artists" will help you out.|`|PsdWiZQoaa	It may be a from Appalachia but I wouldn't call it bluegrass.

8a9ob4mIaa	i dunno man, i think lil wayne is fire. the only 2 things i dislike about wayne: rock, and some of the autotune. The autotune was ok until he used it wayyy to much. Nas is also fire. The only people who think Nas is wack watched the video where Souldja Boy told everyone Nas killed the game. D*** Riders!!!|`|q4XUy0Duaa	I know what you mean.  I thought the same thing when I saw him featured on Ghostface's last album.  I still got love for Ghost though.  The reason why people say that is because it's obvious a rapper with real skills would never collaborate with a weak emcee like Wayne unless they wanted to sell records.  That's the only reason anyone would do a track with him.  And although I don't agree with it and would never do it, it works.  It makes an artist even more of a sellout when they're already selling records, and they're so greedy, they feature him on their album to sell a few more.  In the long run, their true fans will call them wack.  A few years from now when Wayne fans get a lil older and everyone is in agreement that Lil Wayne is wack, people will look back and laugh.  I would have lost respect for Kool G Rap if he did a track with Vanilla Ice.  You get what I'm sayin?|`|8db23f1aeb7672b600a3d72f692658cfaa	i nvr heard anyone call nas and jay wack (reall hip hop fans thou) but most wayne d*ck ryders say that b/c they cant handle the fact jay, nas, and others are better than wayne    to me it shouldnt matter if u did a song with someone as long as the lyrics are straight there should be nothing to complain about. but i guess some people think if u do a song with wayne there a sell out|`|LLEhUtxXaa	who's calling jay and nas whack?
0ebdea3dd60003df366ec0d23fcf3335aa	I commented on your video. i think what I commented is enough to say. but u have a lovely voice, and u shouldnt be desperate to want to be scouted. it will take time. right know u need to concentrate on developing ur voice, making it more strong, more powerful, and to let it out. once ur voice can radiant, thats when the magic starts. it will take time effort and practise. but dont be desperate for people to subscribe, because u dont want to push them away. so just be urself, and post videos, because the more videos u post, the better u will get. and the more people will love your voice. if its ur dream, dont let go. and continue. but it might take as long as one year or more, because thats how long it took all the famous youtubers! just continue to advertise urself, and u'll be fine! u have potential! everyone has potential! but it depends how u strive for it. see im trying to improve my voice, not really to be a singer, it would be nice, but to have a good voice in my future! so i hope the best of luck for the both of us!! and i'm StrawberryLight by the way!!

7TQ5qGWcaa	Unfortunately, the answer depends on who you ask. A group of students at Swarthmore Junior High conducted an extensive study on the subject and concluded that getting to the center of a Tootsie Pop took a statistical average of 144 licks. However, the more ambitious and distrusting engineering students at Purdue University chose instead to rely on a "licking machine" modeled after the human tongue for their results. The Boilermakers found it took an average of 364 licks. And while other studies have been done, all the results vary.

eY4RubMSaa	I don't think so, I play the drums though. But in my band, my guitartist and bassist switch amps all time, without changing cords.    If it's an old bass, maybe it uses a different type.

EDIT2: She says they are the same.|`|9zJ7iqY2aa	there shouldn't be any difference, so that's pretty strange. did you try another cord?|`|AA11614847	There shouldn't be any difference in the cables, unless you've maybe got a speaker cable?

She looks like them because, hello, she's their cousin!  :)|`|6c519adeb7e7fde2ea538370b524d613aa	I thought that she acted stupidly when she threw cake in to Josh's face at the wedding.

Cactopus Cream  is the cure but there is none out there to buy.|`|gbaeVLo0aa	bathe it in porcupine urine|`|o88qLRgbaa	healing springs is the cheapest way, otherwise check the neo hospital for the cure and then shop wizard it. :)

C6fm3Orpaa	Well the song Ghost Love Score by Nightwish has vocals, but it's mostly instrumental, and it's amazing.    And, again, although it has vocals, the masterpiece Carmina Burana would be great. A lot of operatic pieces with full choirs can work better than purely instrumental pieces in places where you thought you'd be using nonvocal songs. Just something you might want to consider.    A lot of the music from Tim Burton's The Corpse Bride is nonvocal and beautiful and very mysterious and creepy. Some songs from the soundtrack that struck me as the type of thing you might be looking for: Into the Forest, Casting a Spell and Moon Dance (these two flow seemlessly together - literally - both in the movie and on the soundtrack, as they're meant to be listened to together), Victor's Deception, and maybe even End Credits Part 1.    Another soundtrack you might want to take a look at is Once More With Feeling, a compilation of the music used in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode of the same name. No, I'm not suggesting one of the goofy tunes performed in that particular episode. Tacked onto the end of the CD, after the showtunes, are some of the score from other episodes, the mostly nonvocal stuff. These suites are from the episodes "Restless," "Hush," and also a song called Sacrifice from "The Gift."    The Overture from Andrew Lloyd Webber's fantastic musical, The Phantom of the Opera might sound cool too.    I also went to pandora.com and searched for songs similar to those I've suggested and I came up with these further suggestions:    - Mystica, by Epica*  - A variety of things by Mozart and Beethoven  - Overture (Instrumental), by Savatage*  - Ice, Wind & Fire by Uli Jon Roth  - Anything instrumental by Nightwish (the specific song I found was The Last of the Wilds)    If none of my suggestions seem to fit, then you can to http://www.pandora.com. It's an amazing site - I love it - where you can make your own "radio station" based on a song or band you like. The site then compiles a playlist for you of other songs and bands similar in technique, sound, style, or fanbase to the one you asked for. It changes the list, adding things and removing things, according to whether or not you like the song currently playing.    Hope I helped. Good luck - and may I ask what it is you're working on? It sounds really cool. :]    *You might want to also look and see if there are other songs by these bands that you like|`|767827e507172c501779704f6cc679a3aa	hello by evanescence, i've always thought this song sounds like to decent into madness.
d1f4df25e3d45f0e9e4b1146d352dae1aa	No not really. My 17 yr old likes to watch them too.

Simon hit the nail on the head when asking if he sang outdoors. He kind of had that stalker look in him. I am very disappointed in Idol for showing less bad auditions but Hollywood round starts Tuesday.

As a musician and a bass player, it's important to sound good and play with the drummer. The look of your amps isn't what is important.

If you have trouble finding it search guitar maniac dx.  A game with a stickfigure should show up choose  2 and there should be a link to this way (also try rough tone it isn't as good for advertising but it may work well) .

Maybe it's going to die since this season is not all that. <br>  P.S.<br>  last week i was looking for something to watch on TV and i saw that there was american idol. I was surprised that i was able to change the channel since i've never done that. so i guess AI is slowly dying unless at least one singer can  convince me to stop changing the channel.|`|wUEkT3P6aa	yes it is about dead|`|AA12390047	It's better than most shows.

xmdh8iY3aa	I've been in Wu Tang mode for the past few months.......I think the work the RZA did on 36 Chambers, OB4CL, Liquid Swords, Ironman is ******* brilliant. I've always asked myself the same question, what if he went and did production for say Mobb Deep or Boot Camp Clik (that type of group fit his profile best)? Would he have elevated his placing?   Frankly I'm not sure. I think DJ Premier is so far ahead of anyone it would be tough to catch him. I mean look how extensive and varied his discography is. He made emcees/groups far better than what they were - Group Home being a prime example.|`|Mfixq1oyaa	Dj Premier > Beethoven|`|xUhAqctjaa	No, Premo's beats are that much better.  But RZA is number 2.  1. Dj Premier  2. RZA  3. Dr. Dre  4. Pete Rock  5. Erick Sermon|`|fE5M8Tloaa	1.  Premo  2.  Pete Rock  3.  RZA  4.  Q-Tip  5.  J Dilla    out of my top 3 they change all of the time, RZA is amazing, if he did one more SUPER DOPE album, then i'd give him the nod over Premo|`|ioNTTqKfaa	RZA needs to be more consistent. He's come up with better beats than Premo, but sometimes he fails hard.|`|sOAOyue7aa	Honestly, I do think that Premo's beats are that much better, which is why he is able to reach out and work with more artists.     I don't think there are too many people outside the Wu-Tang Clan that can channel their flows to match te style of RZA's beets the way that rappers can do for Premo. Its not a knock on RZA, its just that Premo seems to bring the best out of (almost) every artists he works with.|`|qpxPW5paaa	Premo's better hands down I think if RZA would have focused solely an production it might have made him better than Premier.   1Premier  2Prince Paul  3RZA  4Dre  5Stoupe
Ddd8LDPGaa	Go to   http://abc.com  click on free episodes   then click on lost  you can watch all lost episodes here|`|ibiO4VEQaa	Lostpedia is the best Lost site, kind of like Wikipedia but more extensive and easy to navigate.  I don't watch Heroes sorry.|`|PjW3Yo2saa	lost is hard to explain in a few sentences..  its about a group of people spread out over some 50 years  all connected by an island that has magical properties  where its hard to tell who is really the good guys or the bad|`|VmqLwiCSaa	Lost is about a group of people who crashed on an island in the middle of the pacific. During the first season they started to realise that they were not alone on the island, Sayid ( i think that's how you spell his name) left the camp about halfway through the first season to map out the island when he was captured by Dannielle the french woman who you can hear talking on the radio on the first episode. later on in the first season Claire gets kidnapped by the 'others". She comes back later on but has no memory of what has happened. Boone and locke find a plane in a tree and the attemp to use the radio, boone speaks into the radio saying that they were survivers of the flight 815, the voice on the other end mocks him repeating what he says. During Season 2 we discover that the tail end of the plane that broke of while the plane was still in flight also landed on the island and there were survivers the voice one the radio talking to boone was actually another survivour of the flight 815. the two groups of remaining surviours finally meet and set up camp together.     that was really long sorry i hope that helps.      on the first episode of heroes we're introduced to a group of people that appear to have no conection to each other except for the fact that they all posses a superpower such as flight, mind-reading, cell regeneration and such. during the first season the mission soon becomes "save the cheerleader,save the world." Claire is the cheerleader and she has the power to heal. the person who figured out that they had to save the cheerleader was hiro who has the power to manipulate time and transportation.     i don't know when you started watching these shows so i'm not sure how much you've seen and i don't want to spoil it for you.   I really hope this helps|`|g0kXgRRGaa	Lost is extremely serialized, meaning that each episode builds heavily on the last so a simple summary cannot just clue you in as to what's happening. You'd have to watch all the other episodes before you can watch the new ones.    However, a brief summary of the show is that a commercial jetliner flying from Australia to the US crashes midflight on an island in the Pacific ocean, leaving several dozen people alive and stranded. They quickly learn that the island is "special" and has many unusual properties. For example, one of the passengers was in a wheelchair, but upon crashing on the island he can walk again. There is also a "monster" in the jungle which looks like a cloud of thick black smoke that sometimes attacks and sometimes spares the characters; its purpose and origin aren't known.    Perhaps the biggest problem they encounter, however, is a group of other people who were already living on the island for a long time. They call these people "the Others," but their real group name is unknown. The Others have modern technology and homes that they stole from the DHARMA Initiative, a scientific group that used the island in the 1970s for research and had a war with the Others; the Others won. Now the Others keep antagonizing the survivors and they have several battles.    There are a number of other strange elements, like the fact that no one can seem to find the island or the fact that many of the characters are connected (like sharing a relative or meeting the same people). However, at its heart, the show isn't about people on an island with a monster. It's about a group of people who had problems in their lives and who have a chance to start over on the island, even when their pasts seem to haunt them there.    That's as far as I'll go because of spoilers, but yeah, it's an amazing show.

NSKimt1Qaa	In looking up the definition of gospel music, I found a host of different definitions.  The most popular definitions were along these lines:   from Answers.com  -   A kind of Christian music based on American folk music, marked by strong rhythms and elaborated refrains, and incorporating elements of spirituals, blues, and jazz.  from Wikipedia.com  -  Gospel music is music that is written to express either personal or a communal belief regarding Christian life, as well as (in terms of the varying music styles) to give a Christian alternative to mainstream secular music.  I also found the following included in one of the definitions:  "By the middle of the 20th century it had also become a distinct category of popular song, independent of religious association, with its own supporting publishing and recording firms, and performers appearing in concerts."  While the definition of gospel music is first and foremost Christian, it could, of course, combine that with different topics.  A lot of both Gospel and Christian rock music is pretty good.|`|0ujQ0zl2aa	are you kidding me.   they are a gospel choir for a reason. gospel.  i mean have YOU ever hear someone sing about whipping it really good in church.  i mean come on.|`|DLbracM5aa	LOL   u cant be serious|`|XTehozZSaa	A "Gospel" is the books in the new testament (Source: http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=d...

They're amazing. I just hate that a stupid Disney show took the name >.> and that show suckkkkkks. But that song is particularly good, I like your style ;] ha.|`|IatEdBpvaa	Haha, as soon as I saw the question I knew it had to be about the 'Mats.  Love The Replacements, I first got into them just over 20 years ago when Don't Tell A Soul first came out.  Little did I realize that it wasn't even one of their better albums.  Only one I'm missing is Sorry Ma, I Forgot To Take Out The Trash and I'm not even sure why I don't have that one.  Also got some great bootlegs of theirs including the final set they did, live in Chicago.  Rumors are that they are supposed to have a reunion tour, probably the one reunion I'd like to see the most along with Uncle Tupelo.    Favorite album is Let It Be.  Of course, there's none that I don't like from the their punk musings on Stink to their more produced sounds on All Shook Down.  Here's some of my favorite songs ot theirs.    http://www.imeem.com/thereplacements/mus...    http://www.imeem.com/thereplacements/mus...    http://www.imeem.com/standardlipsum/musi...    http://www.imeem.com/thereplacements/mus...    http://www.imeem.com/thereplacements/mus...

eVt0qkT8aa	Well, I can't really say that other signs don't understand me, although people know that I'm a sensitive, shy, and quiet person. I would have to say Virgo, because of a friend of mine. He is a good friend but he's the last person to be sensitive. I would say Taurus and Scorpio, not to be bias in a way, to understand me the most, because some of my friends are Taurus and Scorpio's, and I seem to relate to them the most, along with Gemini also.    *EDIT*     I forgot to put this up too, ^___^;  -Cancer Sun  -Libra Moon  -Virgo Rising  -Cancer Mercury  -Virgo Mars  -Taurus Venus|`|qNKK4hLDaa	well none of the signs really understand me (and i don't blame them lol), except my pisces dad knows how to put himself in my place, he's very sympathetic whenever i have a mental breakdown or a simple tempertantrum    i actually don't even know how he can STAND me sometimes lol    leo sun and mercury square my scorpio ascendant, and an aries moon [but in vedic it's in pisces.  both of them can describe me pretty spot on, but i lean towards the pisces moon a little more than i do the aries]    edit: who wants to play a game of guess who*? ill go first:     i have 20 answers so far and made my account today, what i do for fun is type a novel on all of astrology's [you know, the pseudoscience] flaws|`|0IKwusdgaa	Leos understand me the least. They underestimate me alot, apart from my best friend. Shes a leo with sag rising and cancer moon. Otherwise about 5 leos i know are so rude to me and make stupid jokes like im stupid and they think i wont do anything back but when i do, thats when theyre like 'why are you being so serious'. Just because im quiet or not so outgoing doesnt mean i am stupid...so yeah. Most of them are good by heart though...|`|MWe4hMm1aa	gemini. but they don't understand anyone. they're robots.|`|d69856882943ee44ddbbe3cb4e643f2aaa	Hmm, you must be a cancer huh. We cancers are the sign most eager to be understood, hun. Plus, I can tell by your dedication...you come back to this question constantly and respond to everything everyone says. That's totally what I do, too, lol.    Well, for me, I would say Aries and Taurus are the signs who least understand anybody..not just me. But I think probably Sagittarius is the sign that least understands me, and Capricorn, Aquarius, Libra, Gemini, and the water signs, the ones who most do.    I know a Capricorn psychologist who understands me like no one I have ever met. But I've met some scorpios and pisces..especially scorpio who have understood me like nobody else, too.    Cancer sun  Cancer mercury  Pluto in scorpio in the 1st  Ascendant in libra  Moon in leo  Venus and mars in leo    I have sun opposite saturn and neptune, moon trine uranus, moon conjunct jupiter, venus conjunct mars, and venus quincunx saturn/neptune, plus neptune, pluto, and saturn all conjunct.  I also have a balance between air, fire, and water signs, and practically no signs in earth except i have 3 major signs in the 10th house of capricorn, and I have the least of mutable and the most of fixed and cardinal, but I have an important conjunction in the 3rd house ruled by sagittarius which balances out and makes me quite mutable.|`|mKfQQRDuaa	Leo Sun, Scorpio Ascendant, Aries Moon, Leo Mercury.    I feel that several signs misunderstand me and underestimate me or envy me.  I think also sex has quite a bit to do with it.  I notice I generally don't get along with Taurus girls, Scorpio girls.  Generally all males regardless of sign are not so problematic for me.  But Taurus girls can be really bitchy and scheming and physically they can't keep up with me.  Scorpio girls can be quite deceitful and they seem to envy me in a sense.  They undermine my child like optimism.    I feel that several signs understand my the best.  Virgos, Geminis (even though most that I know are superficial) other Leo girls (I love leo girls!), Sags! and Aquarius!|`|AA12215623	Gemini the least.  Scorpio,Cancer,Virgo,My Aqaurius bff - the most|`|d2uGruHiaa	* I do not know much about the sun and all that, but I'm a Capricorn and my best friend is a Taurus and we understand each other perfectly well, maybe because we're both compatible earth signs.    It has been shown that if your signs are the same (Earth-Earth, Water-water, air-air, fire-fire.) that you'll be understood by the same people who are also your sign.     Taurus and I understand each other completely and many understand us also. But sometimes, Capricorns tend to be reserved about their emotions just like Scorpios are.     Capricorns can be understood easily, but the thing that I don't understand is Scorpio. They are very very secretive, and seem sexually.|`|qUFwZUzdaa	I am a pisces    Leo's & Libra's dont understand me    Capricorn's, Virgo's, Cancer's & PIsces understand me very well!    sun sign:                   pisces  rising sign:                  virgo  moon:                          libra  murcury:                      aries  venus:                         aquarius  mars:                          pisces  jupiter:                        cancer   saturn                          virgo|`|Fb2xM1kJaa	least-Sags and Leo.

HF1TfsnTaa	Are you trying to tell me you've never done that with all the kids you have. It saves alot of time. First you have to run a around and catch them, pull down the pants , unsnap the onezee,undo the diaper and if there's nothing there ya just did all that for nothing. I'm a  proud poopy sniffer form way back in the day.|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	It takes longer to remove pants and check diaper.  Sometimes if you just pull the diaper out and look you get on your fingers. YACK. The jobs of motherhood. LOL|`|PFNFTAtgaa	They want confirmation|`|X0FHuF4qaa	It's safer...|`|KSUPtqCaaa	When checking a baby, having to undress the baby to peak into the diaper is pointless if it isn't soiled. A quick whiff will answer the question just as well, but without the time spent getting the clothing out of the way.|`|I6dIkhbOaa	I agree! It's quicker and you don't have to worry about accidentally sticking your finger in boo when you check! Sometimes they fill the diaper up to the brim . . .|`|hvZSKn6Eaa	Having a look unleashes even more smell...|`|4DonDdbvaa	No-one wants look at poo or pee|`|8sphY203aa	its quicker!!|`|mggll8dRaa	That was the Wife's 'job'.....!!|`|oojO4WAraa	It is quicker, you can tell with one sniff.

MmbLWe3Qaa	Woohoo! My favorite band! I'm listening to I've Been Tired right now.    Couldn't decide on a favorite song, so I'll choose a few:  Gouge Away  Debaser  Hey  I Bleed  No. 13 Baby  Cactus (Bowie did a great cover, too)  The Sad Punk      Okay, I could keep going...but that's already more than a few. haha    EDIT: And definitely underrated. I mean, a lot of people know them, and like them, but they are an incredibly influential band that should get even more credit than they do. Or maybe I just have a bias because I love them so much.|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	Hell yes, Doolittle is one of my favorite cds. Without the pixies nirvana whouldn't have sounded the way they did. Plus the Pixies are tottally origanal unlike 90% of bands.    favorite songs-Dead, I Bleed,Bam Thwok.Hey|`|DibFrwxlaa	I have to say I have never really liked this band.    In the early 90s I liked Nirvana and The Breeders so you would think that naturally The Pixies would follow like a little lost puppy.  But I just never liked them.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	Never followed them that much, but good song  take care  dave|`|yZD0f5tzaa	Pixies are amazing! And Surfer Rosa is such a great album.

ow1m3c8jaa	Well then this week should make you very happy because Nick & Sharon are supposed to get back together when Nick gets caught in the "big" snowstorm while at the Cabin to tell Sharon about Noah falling in the lake.  The roads are supposed to be blocked and they can't go home, so they have to stay at the cabin  through the night and end up hitting the sheets.    Jack is also suppose to find a "new" woman this week too.  Don't if Phyllis would count as "new" since they've been together before, but I am hoping it's someone new, they could use some new blood on the show since most of the couples have been pretty ho-hum lately!|`|77c57626443438210c0260f50ba33c71aa	I'm with you!  I hope Sharon & Nick get back together...I can't stand Phyllis.....period...and with Nicholas ..they are sooo different..She makes their relationship a catastrophe...  Thanx for agreeing with me...I couldn't understand why so many people were for Nick & Phyllis...they're bad...|`|jCHcjJ9Baa	I am a Nick and Sharon fan so will be happy to see them back together.  I wonder who they will pair Phyllis with next.    I have also wondered if the new woman in Jack's life will be the woman who was at the cocktail party.  The one that worked with Chloe?    Oh well will just have to wait and see.|`|AA10623143	I've been watching this show since 1978.  I remember Sharon and Nick being a really cute couple when they were in high school, but their marriage was never really happy or passionate.  Wait, I take that back, they were passionate -- with other people though.|`|CyVxolNHaa	U and i both, i really do hope that Sharon and Nick do find their way back together, i do agree that they were "THE" most romantic, and memorable couple on that show, and it sickened me to find out that Nick left her for that tramp Phyllis, UGH!|`|q6ogfhnMaa	well u already know, i am going to agree with everyone on here that agrees that Sharon and Nick should be together, and Phyllis needs to get a life, and leave the two to be a happily married couple, the way it was intended in the beginning!|`|44dcc209645e25a90756133f2c64c1e5aa	The way Phyllis has been acting,  I hope they do. I love when Nick and Sharon are together. Phyllis needs a life. maybe 3. Paul and Nikki are together, not so sure about Victor and Ashley.|`|Ye0mxrJVaa	Maybe Sharon will be with Nick again but I don't think it'll happen, Nick was completly stupid to marry Phyllis and might stay with her even if the baby (Summer) isn't his. I also have a feeling that Paul and Nikki will be together. I also want to see Jack with that woman at the cocktail party.|`|GomZ9oYHaa	I also agree that Nick and Sharon will go back together. Im sure Nick will see that letter she wrote to Nick that she wadded up.. Not sure about the rest of the couples..I gotta feeling somewhere down the line Nicky and Vic will get back together..|`|5Bn1QsWmaa	Yes i love love love Sharon with Nick, always hated Phyllis with Nick, and still do til today, i just want them to be over already!So phyllis can crawl right back into her hole where she came from!|`|FwU6GL4Laa	I would about bet that Sharon and Nick gets back together, it looks like that the way the storyline is headed. I was hoping that Phyllis and Jack reunites and finally has a family together but I think Jacks love interest will be a huge surprise no one we have seen yet. I cant wait!|`|2f8d927b404e673e434c880af431f65caa	I agree! Nick should be with Sharon. Phyllis is a better partner with Jack! (Partners in Crime that is!)|`|LO3BMobRaa	Finally a true Shick fan, I can't stand these Phick and Phyllis fans, Phyllis Summers is a snake (her it in the name sss (LOL). Nick and Sharon are a classic and original couple just like Nick's parents Victor and Nikki Newman. Shick went through the fire to prove their love and build a bond as solid as Ashford and Simpson, that's what scares the hell out of the Red Mist (Jack's name for Phyllis). Phick are just hot passionate sex, and that's what they keep mistaking for love, if they didn't have sex, they wouldn't have anything but fantasies of them having sex. Shick needs a reunion, and Phyllis needs to fall off the face of the earth.|`|qAoM2Jp5aa	Yes, I totally agree with you.  I was so bummed when Nick & Phyllis got together...they are just not right for each other, so odd!! Thanks for the link, I voted! :)|`|LkTcLWTOaa	you're in luck. nicolas goes to the cabin to tell sharon about noah and they get stranded because of the snowstorm and one thing leads to another. i hope this breaks up him and phyllis for good because i could never stand her. it's about time he's back with sharon for good.|`|DWElTA36aa	I agree. Nick and Sharon. Phillys should be with Jack. If anyone...
552de7febc71eb51ff1ef430b6431237aa	I GOOGLED IT -- A Song for You - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia said Leon Russell wrote this song.  BTW, I was a fan of Karen Carpenter.

LkN5nr6faa	Soundgarden. I like Chris Cornell (liked him better in Audioslave actually) but I'm not a fan of Soundgarden.    BA: EXTREMELY  BA2: Yes, it's actually composed solely with guitar and an orchestra, no vocals involved (Steve Vai- For the Love of God)  BA3: Alice in Chains- Angry Chair  BA4: Yes|`|qXg3idqXaa	when the smashing pumpkins came back together they weren't as good as before. i still liked billy corgan, but the band just wasn't the same.  bq. it is cold where i am. lots of snow...  bq2. i'm really not sure what my favorite song is, but it probably doesn't feature a guitar solo. they always seem to get soo monotonous.   bq3. the used - pieces mended  bq4. yeah, some of it. like not any super old stuff... but i really like billy joel, if he counts.|`|Jz7KDYoEaa	Don't have an answer for the first I'm a lyrics man myself I could listen to acapella only if I had to. So if I don't like the lyrics or singer, screw everything else. Although that's vice versa.    Yes it is cold where I am.    One of my favs does, Iron Man by Black Saabbath. Love that damn solo and love the lyrics, "He was turned to steel by the great magnetic field where he travled..." So great!    Smile- 2pac is the most played this week.    Hell yeah, 70's rock and soul, man, those are my favorite genres|`|gO0AmLoDaa	Slipknot/Corey Taylor.  I don't actually like him as a person so much, but he has a good voice.    BQ: It was actually pretty warm today (40 degrees) compared to what it's been.  BQ2: of course!  BQ3: that would probably be What's On My Mind by Kansas.  BQ4: I like old rock, but not pop that oldies stations usually play.|`|xAMa67ERaa	1well if the sex pistols count.. i absolutely loveee sid vicious but the band kinda sucks(he's not the singer though).Also the doors, some of their songs are amazing and some of them are just ok..but jim morrison is the best!     2sort of..kind of chilly.     3actually it does...most of them do     4the oldies are my favorite. i don't even know whats out right now=[|`|wA8Dyhq7aa	Hmm...interesting question.  Usually it's the singer that helps turn me off to a band.      I would have to say Steve Miller.  There's nothing wrong with his voice, but dang those idiotic lyrics of his!!    BA:  It warmed up today, melted most of the ice, and I think they said 50,000 people got their electricity restored from the ice storm.    BA2:  No, which is interesting because the song ("Dark as a Dungeon") was by a guitar virtuoso (Merle Travis), but he wanted to emphasize the lyrics so he left his fancy playing for other songs.    BA3:  According to iPod, it's a tie between "The Hobo Song" by John Prine and "The Billboard Song" by Homer & Jethro.  You'd think with all this ice and snow around I would've pulled out the baseball songs!!    BA4:  Absolutely!!!  I even have an "oldies" playlist on my iPod.|`|rfB8G7skaa	I generally think the opposite way, I usually like the music but not the person singing the music, as with Bono. I think Bono is a brilliant musician but he's a bit cookoo sometimes.    BQ: It's freezing here in Richmond, VA.  BQ2: "Fix You" by Coldplay has a brilliant guitar solo in the build up towards the finale.  BQ3: Probably "Electric Feel" by MGMT  BQ4: I like some, mostly Guns n' Roses and The Beatles.    :)|`|gbm71puSaa	Enya. Nice voice but boring music  BQ-yes and windy  BQ2-yes. Forbidden city by Marty Friedman  BQ3-formation of damnation by testament  BQ3- yes, very much
DibFrwxlaa	I like it for the very reasons you mention.  I don't ever want or expect to see anything but 90% hair metal.    My beef with that show is that they play like 2 songs go to commercial, 2 songs go to commerical.    BA:  Well I wouldn't write angry letters to VH1 if they included a little more thrash metal.  BA2:  Oh jeez, that's terrible.    ----------------------  Yeah, I knew what you meant.  I usually only casually flip to that channel and if there's some glorious hair metal video on that I remember, I watch it.|`|6cUPKr7Paa	Yes, I do watch Metal Mania.  I think it's basically a tribute to the Head Banger's Ball of the late '80's/early '90's.  That's probably why they play Whitesnake, Skid Row, Bon Jovi, etc.  It takes us back to the day!      BQ:  More Sabbath maybe?    BQ2:  "Broken Sunday"- Saliva|`|ZRQCd8kTaa	watch it all the time. cause i love that hair metal. but bon jovi though i love the music it isnt metal. but skid row sure is, if you ever listen to their second album. also hope axl is ok. love the new gnr|`|MYsSyfQzaa	Hell yeah!!!! I wake up early to watch it, if I can see Nikki Sixx and Sebastian Bach in 2 hours I'm happy, I love that show and channel it's like Rock history 101, I think more people should watch it so they can learn something once and a while.|`|1vCoaf08aa	When my cable company lets me have it for a while, or I'm a at friend's house.    Yeah, sometimes, I'd like to see some variety on there.    BA1: Dark Angel (no vids though)  BA2: Ol' Shep - Red Foley (About a boy and his dog, sad tune)|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	They have a low variety of stuff. I watched it a few nights in a row and I saw the same songs too many times. Less than half of the stuff they play is metal. Most of it is just glam.    BA: Black Sabbath   BA2: Coming of Age by Breaking Point    Whoever said Iron Maiden should know that Metal Mania plays Run to the Hills and The Trooper.|`|zZPbmxWkaa	I would watch it if I got VH1 Classic...    BQ: Iron Maiden... if I had VH1 Classic  BQ2: Tuesday's Gone - Lynyrd Skynyrd|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	No, I HATE that entire era/genre.  IMO, Guns & Roses is the most over-rated band in the history of the world, and the rest aren't far behind.    The notable exception would be Metallica, who didn't have to play loud because they played WELL.|`|LkN5nr6faa	I watch it all the time. I love hair metal, which makes the show perfect for me. Whitesnake isn't just 'Here I Go Again' you know, they are most definitely a metal band.|`|78d567ba4ef552df04b4e4bac0f97f4daa	yeah they play an awful lot of dokken and dio as well. but im glad there is a show that at least plays that type of music they don't play a lot of heavy heavy stuff but what can u do i still watch it anyway but you are right.
ZQE61wUZaa	I agree, I have my sights on one his profile picture is very cute, and just as naughty as I am.  If he could only see me in real life I think he'd like me.

But if you want to give one a try, listen to "That's the Way That the World Goes 'Round" by John Prine.|`|N62uLMf3aa	Yeeeesss!  A lot of songs, i mean a lot. The last one was "Fly on the Windscreen" by Depeche. I used to listen to it while falling asleep.

41ac7d9d52a54e7a6b648bd7d6d7d8ffaa	I know its not popular,  3 doors has simulcast work.  Vendor      and stand workers can help arrange and promote the new world       thru mtv and sponsors.  If you get good at promoting in your area       you can basically help chose the shows cause at some point        you may realize simulcast covers the thousand stadium clients        and is about entertainment for good causes.
273f2433b1dffeaf31f3be0b1db943e9aa	I would imagine years of abuse helped that face.  I wouldn't recommend it, drugs, booze and smoking along with no sleep and an incredibly hard life over an extended period of time ought to help you out.  Add in extended sun exposure and dehydration.|`|wA8Dyhq7aa	You might want to ask over in rock.  In country, the only "Keith" we have is Keith Whitley.|`|UAHjJpC0aa	50 years of bad drugs, heroin, coke, acid, weed, cigs,   way too much sex,  VD's  STD's  Bourbon  touring.....    yeah, that outa do it
o6ACs5z4aa	My husband loves King of the Hill.  He is a good guy, just thinks it is funny.  Personally I think it is stupid, but it has made me laugh a time or two. <br>  Nobody I know acts like that because they aren't as stupid. <br>  Kansas, U.S.<br>  I think that people like finding something to watch that doesn't make them think and just lets them enjoy themselves and laugh.  Sometimes after a hard day you need that.<br>  After work sometimes I just hate getting into something that is going to make me think, I want to relax and see something stupid that just lets me laugh and enjoy myself.<br>  You are welcome.|`|wmBK9uASaa	People who like adult style cartoons|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	We dont have it on TV anymore but I used to quite like watching it years ago.

Whether it is true or not.|`|vUTS0EuZaa	Like what the acient egyptians did  drilling a hole into the side of the head (Treppaning) and pour fluids or was it drain fluids out...lol.... it's actually filling another person's head with propaganda that is not true influencing them to think and believe what they say is right/true.|`|i9JFKN6Paa	There are so many different ways and methods involved in brain washing a person, it would be impossible to cover them all here. <br>  <br>  Sleep, food and sensory deprivation are the most common methods.|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	Brainwash = to changes peoples thoughts and make them believe whatever you say is true.  <br>  <br>  Examples - Tom Cruise, John Travolta, all the nazis, all cults, etc.

273f2433b1dffeaf31f3be0b1db943e9aa	Dierks Bentley and Jimmy Wayne are scheduled for the summer 2009 tour titled "American Saturday Night"    Here is a list of confirmed dates so far  http://www.countryhound.com/brad-paisley...
273f2433b1dffeaf31f3be0b1db943e9aa	I've seen Toby Keith every year for the last six years and he always puts on a good show.  Several friends and fans get together and see him every year so I may be biased in my opinion.  He has closed with American Soldier and Courtesy of the Red White and blue ever since the song came out but each and every performance.  the finale still moves me with all the soldiers brought up on stage.  My biggest complaint is that he needs to change his set list up because he only incorporates a few news songs each year.  There are a lot I am ready for him to let go of.    I will say that last year,  Montgomery Gentry toured with him and that was the best concert!  Eddie Montgomery is a hoot, incredibly funny and entertaining to say the least.    Brooks and Dunn put on a good show.  I love Ronnie Dunn''s vocals but Kix makes the show as far as entertainment goes.    If you are into smaller venues,  I recommend Travis Tritt.  He puts on a good mix of great guitar playing and some great ballads    I know you are a great fan of Brad Paisley and while I have not seen him myself, I did send my niece tickets two years ago when he was touring with Taylor and Kellie and she just couldn't quit talking about what a great show it was.|`|4c874e283dd92b6b16b07e3f459300f8aa	We go to a 4 day country fest every year so I have seen everyone from Carrie to Charlie to Toby to Surgerland to whoever else you can squeeze in there. I agree with Kathleen about Toby, even though the guy kinda gets on my nerves these days, that was probably the best country concert I been too.B&D was great so was Reba.Miranda Lambert I would see again in a heart beat as well.    The 2 guys that surprised me the most would be Blake Shelton and Dierks Bentley.Those are two I would of never thought would be a GREAT concert but they were,especially Blake.While most bands will play a few rock tunes, Blake was busting out Conway Twitty and Charlie Rich tunes.He needs to record "Behind Closed Doors" cause he kills it in concert. The dude can flat out sing..Another surprise was Luke Bryan,Not really a huge fan, but he put on a fun little show and I had no idea he wrote "Good Directions".That's like the only Billy Currington song I like!.Joe Nichols put on a fun show as well,untill he tried singing "Rockstar" (yikes)    I guess if I had to pick one that disappointed, it would be Gretchen Wilson.Maybe it was an off night for her, but I wasn't too impressed. I think we all know by now she can sing Barracuda,she needs to come up with something else.And I also think all there could of lived without her version of Separate Ways by Journey as well,lol|`|9f0d54c35894f05249bcafb57c720e4baa	.....I liked Alan Jackson's show.But I've heard Brad Paisley has one of the best.|`|Vz6zuFXQaa	Taylor Swift I have to say she is amazing.|`|uNbNXHyDaa	I haven't seen many live, but guessing from what I've seen of the artists singing live on TV, I have to go with Carrie Underwood as having the best live voice, and Kelly Clarkson can't go unmentioned.|`|HqcH85SMaa	I've seen Jon Bon Jovi - his concert was great but the best I've seen so far is Keith Urban - his concert is unbelievable.|`|YzBeeQ62aa	Jake Owen puts on a great show. So does Lee Brice, you can feel the emotions of his songs when he sings. I've seen several others if you want to know about anybody specific let me know.|`|zhH36xEHaa	Its not even a question who the best live performer in country music is. As I have been to at least one show for every single one of his tours and they just keep getting better and better, Who am I speaking of? Kenny Chesney of course. If you have ever seen him live, surely you'll agree. Can't wait for his lucky old sun tour!|`|pA5SI5t3aa	I've seen Brad Paisley, Kenny Chesney, Alan Jackson, Tim McGraw, Jason Aldean, Brooks & Dunn, Big & Rich, Taylor Swift, Rodney Atkins, Gary Allen, James Otto, but...    TRACE ADKINS is easily the best. He has the best voice, great songs, and he is a comedian.|`|7HYBiOhwaa	i went and saw rodney atkins last year at rodeo austin and the show was alot of fun  in 'these are my people' the lights turned really low and he got a big spotlight and shined it into the crowd

I am dreaming of spring.|`|gZMNQF4oaa	the snow is pretty   but its so damn cold|`|wy5SiCS2aa	I used to like winter when I was younger, because I grew up in a place that gets a lot of snow, so I used to sled. make snowmen, build snow forts etc. But now that I'm older and I live in a place that hardly ever gets winter snow, it's a pain. Because they have no idea how to handle the snow here, there's virtually no salt trucks or anything out on the road. We got an ice storm last week and 750,000 were out of power, us included for two days. There's still several thousand people without power. My work shut down, I lost two days pay, and the elderly people are freezing in their homes because of no heat. So no, I HATE winter. Come on spring!|`|oVRA1ze2aa	Love it|`|1a2oh0vLaa	I love tropical weather and water. I love to swim. I have won many tanning contests when I was younger.Still have to have that tan.

I would let me dog (who was CONSTANTLY outdoors) loose, and played "Sgt. Yukon" with him!  RAN in the SNOW, (a foot or more) as fast as I could... And LOVED it!  SNOW-DAYS...  NOT like NOW...  the roads WERE impassable!!!       I remember my GrandFather taking me FISHING!!!  In a 'pond', with a cane-pole and a bobber!  On the Great Lake ERIE!  And,  'ice-fishing'!!!  I thought THAT was AWESOME!!!  And we didn't have a 'shanty'...     I got my GrandFather's boat when he died, and then bought a BIGGER / BETTER one!        I LOVE hunting, (again, my GrandFather got me got me started!)   He gave me my first shot-gun!      But I haven't really done much HUNTING / FISHING  for TOO long...  ALL of the things that I ENJOYED, sort of took a 'back-seat' to 'wife' and 'kids'!  Spent TOO much time doing the 'JOB' thing...      NOW...  while I'm not YET ''decrepit', I don't have a 'place' to GO!  (Like I used to).    I watch the 'bunnies' in the front yard...  And I THINK...    Can't 'pop-a-cap' where I live!    And, after 'giving myself' to the FAMILY / JOB, for SO many years...  I'm NOT in the 'physical shape' that I SHOULD be, now that I HAVE the TIME!    WORST part of it ALL, is that I don't have the WIFE...  I don't have the KIDS, and I don't have the HEALTH to DO what I REALLY want to!!!    I have a nephew, (no SONS) who says he would like to ...  but it's not the same as going to Grandpa's 14 acres...    Your question deserves MORE than a 'yes' or 'no'!  so I'm going to say THIS to you:    Do NOT give-up your LOVE of LIFE!!!      "LIFE" is a matter of 'how you LIVE the experience'!  You 'play' with that cards you are dealt!  You 'BET'!  No matter how you THINK about the 'game' / EXPERIENCE...  You ARE going to make a BET!!!    I'm NOT going to tell you NOT to take a CHANCE...  But, before youcahnge your LIFE, and your LIFE-STYLE...  THINK about the DOWN-side, if you bet WRONG!    And as a last thought...  I HATE shovelling SNOW!!!  I Used to go around the neighborhood, and shovel driveways, AND sidewalks, for the package-price of 50-cents!!!    GOOD LUCK to YOU!!|`|A0tWlG94aa	for some reason i absolutely love the winter..|`|zXvbPknZaa	no i don't|`|7BoSqpVZaa	Love it! There can never be enough snow!

So they all shouted, "together, together, together!"       One morning a blonde stormed out of her house, went to her mailbox, opened it, then slammed it shut. She did this several times.   Finally, her neighbour asked, "are you ok?"  The blonde replied, "No! My stupid computer keeps saying, 'you've got mail'"       John came home one day to find his wife painting.

Clean Poopie- The kind where you pooped it out, see it in the toilet, but there is nothing on the toilet paper.   Wet Poopie- The kind where you wipe your butt 50 times and still feels unwiped, so you have to put some toilet paper between your butt and your underwear, so you won't ruin them with a stain.   Second Wave Poopie- This happens when you're done pooping and you've pulled your pants up to your knees and you realize that you have to poopie some more.   Pop-A-Vein-In-Your-Forehead-Poopie- The kind were you strain so much to get it out, you practically have a stroke.   Lincoln Log Poopie- The kind of poopie that is so huge, you're afraid to flush without first breaking it into little pieces with the toilet brush.   Gassy Poopie- It's so noisy, everyone within earshot is giggling.   Corn Poopie- Self explanatory.   Gee-I-Wish-I-Could-Poopie-Poopie- The kind where you want to poopie, but all you do is sit on the toilet & fart a few times.   Spinal Tap Poopie- That's where it hurts so badly coming out, you'd swear it was leaving sideways.   Wet Cheeks Poopie- (The power dump) The kind that comes out of your butt so fast, your cheeks get spalshed with water.   Liquid Poopie- The kind where yellowish-brown liquid shoots out of your butt and splashes all over the toilet bowl.   Dog Poopie- It smells so bad your nose burns.   Upper Class Poopie- The kind of poopie that doesen't smell.   The Suprise Poopie- You are not even at the toilet because you are sure your about to fart, but OOPS!- a poopie!   The Dangling Poopie- This poopie refuses to drop into the toilet even though you know you are done poopieing. You just pray that a shake or two will cut it loose.|`|rumtF3djaa	What's a cow's favorite song?    I like to Moo it Moo it!|`|SL2xibX2aa	Ok I have 2 but they're kinda lame. My friend told me so yeah..  1:  One day a little girl asked her teacher,"Teacher do you know if whales eat people?"  The teacher replied, "Why don't you ask Jonah from the bible."  Then the little girl said, "When I go to heaven I'll ask him."  Then the teacher said, "What if he didn't go to heaven?"  "Then you can ask him." said the little girl.  2:  Once a husband and wife were giving each other the silent treatment.   The husband had to go on a business trip at 6:00 A.M. He didn't want to lose so on a piece of paper he wrote:  WAKE ME AT 5:00 A.M  Then he put it some where, where his wife could see it.  The next day he woke up and saw it was 9:00 A.M. Next to him was a piece of paper that said:  WAKE UP IT'S 5:00 A.M  hahaha lol yeah not so funny =P|`|43hzcys2aa	This may be a bit obscene, so read at your own discretion!        There was this man who farted A LOT. Every morning, he woke his wife up by farting so loudly. She always got crossed at him when he did that. So one day, she told him off, "If you continue farting that loudly, one day, you might fart your guts out."    However, the warning was to no avail. He continued waking her up by his extremely huge fart.   So, when Thanksgiving arrived, the wife wanted to teach him a lesson. She was cleaning the turkey and so, she took out the turkey guts.   When her husband went to sleep, she stuff the turkey guts into his pants and went to sleep after him.    The next morning, the husband woke the wife up as usual, by farting. Then he went to the bathroom to wash up and stuff.  After a while, he came back and told his wife:    "You were right after all, I did fart my guts out...        ..but don't worry, I've managed to stuff them back inside!"|`|Pa0jmm1Yaa	ok  this is kind of long  ok   there are these 8 yr olds a boy and a girl  the boy chases the lil girl home from school daily   pulls his pants down and teases her  hahaha u dont have one of these  she runs home crying  the next day the same  chases her home  pulls his pants down  hahaa u dont have one of these  she runs home crying  this goes on for several days  until finally one day   the girls mother asked her what's going on  the lil girl finally tells her mom  so the next day  the lil boy did the same  chased her home  pulled down his pants  hahaaha u dont have one of these  the lil girl pulled down her pants and was like  my momma said as long as i have one of these  i can get as many of those as i want|`|VBgzgoUMaa	The funnier a JOKE the more it makes you LAUGH|`|RyvEklWqaa	http://reliableads .org/forums/index.php?act=idx    just take out the^ Space|`|G3HxgCmvaa	1.

RcCJSSMPaa	MA:  Mike Bloomfield, guitarist, composer and bluesman  who worked as a session guitarist for Bob Dylan, was part of the first supergroup consisting of Stephen Stills and Al Kooper and the end result was an album called "Super Session."  Bloomfield turned down a permanent gig as Dylan's guitarist and achieved fame with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band and then went on to do some solo work.  He's been ranked #22 on Rolling Stone's top 100 guitarists of all time.  He is my favorite Studio Musician.  I like the Swampers best, but the MGs and Funk Brothers are cool! : )<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdMf-86Evro" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdMf-86Ev...</a><br>  <br>  MA2:  I LOVE the show!|`|fcf94fd558c72875735d4fe3f1389736aa	MA: I would say Jimmy Paige.

P9S5wlLyaa	I think so. It's not a deep film. It doesn't make you think much, and it doesn't teach you anything. But if what you need is a good cry, it is the absolute best. I cry every single time I watch that movie.|`|qexmttisaa	Totally worth seeing, its really cute and romantic. I would watch it if i where you. Its a cute love story.

It's a nice love story that has been known to make people tear up.|`|3TLzbsbqaa	its really really good if your into girlie films. it makes you cry though, BIGTIME|`|k9dYcxXHaa	Its a good movie, however it gets boring from time to time. So what I would suggest is watch Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley! Its the ultimate love story and its a little more real and not so boring as the Notebook. I am not saying its a bad movie but I got bored a lot throughout it.|`|sWwb7HM3aa	Amazing!<br>  But... i warn ya... if your a cryer...have tissues on hand! =]|`|hGY08GjRaa	You  might like it. How am I to know? <br>  <br>  To me.. most of the "love" in the main romance was very shallow.. just "lust"  they were very sexually attracted to each other, but that's about as deep as it seemed to go.. <br>  <br>  To  me "A Walk to Remember" (the book was written by the guy who wrote the Notebook) has a much more powerful message about what love really is: putting the other person first. I definitely recommend that one over the notebook. And it will definitely make you cry just as much... a great movie..|`|Q8yTJWTXaa	definitely <br>  especially if you like sad sappy movies like i do

He has a really nice voice - not so bad looking either.  Not a country music fan, but he's really good.   Was that an original song?|`|lj8PbJugaa	Pooh!  I couldn't get any sound.  To answer the Q anyway, some dreams are because some are one-sided dreams.  :(

gXIWZDpJaa	I TOTALLY AGREE!!   thats actually one of my fav albums    its one of those albums where u can listen 2 every track instead of skipping a few like the others (n its weird cuz i dont really listen 2 rap like that)    love THE GAME!   :)|`|WQvDIhmgaa	Disagree|`|HL8W9yU6aa	The Documentary has one classic song and 3 other pretty good ones, so in comparison to other albums that are considered classics, yea it's a classic.|`|fSvLsLaCaa	No.     its a good album, but to call it a classic means it goes down with all the other classics like Illmatic, 36 Chambers, Ready To Die or anything along those lines and Documentary is nowhere near that level.    Choc: I'm from the West, and I'm sorry but those were the first classics that popped in my head.|`|PA7ryYR8aa	its his best album out of the 3, but its not a classic. Basically game hasn't done as good ever since he left G-Unit|`|hA5m65Waaa	I agree..but i guess that means im on the west coasts nuts Choc?|`|df6Cz4Juaa	Disagree.  The Game is garbage. The only good songs he had featured 50 Cent, and we all know he ain't workin' with 50 anymore. He's wack.|`|7b9d10cbd6b9df64e80d4d059b981337aa	Nah...    It's good, but not a classic.|`|SJ8gNEWuaa	okaaaaaay.|`|AKwebzdUaa	Nah...not classic but I'd give it 4.5 mics. It was his best album production wise, and lyrically as well.    I'm from the west coast, Straight Outta Compton, The Chronic, Doggystyle, Amerikkka's Most Wanted, All Eyes on Me, Bow Dow, 2001, In a Major Way those are classics.|`|xmdh8iY3aa	Not right now. But give it another 5 years.......I think it may be certified classic. In my opinion it is easily one of the top 5 albums of this decade.    This comin from an East Coast Guy.|`|NzkPEKYgaa	Sell|`|UhtSE2B6aa	I think it is. It's a dope album.     *You shouldn't expect too many people to agree with you. Most of the people here are on the East Coast's nuts. I like all "good" music no matter where it comes from.    edit: Scholar, I said "most" people on this site, and refer to "Teddy Loops" answer. He named all East Coast acts, and has more thumbs up...what a surprise.|`|BnTYoxUIaa	finally you asked a decent question.|`|AA11118643	I disagree. It's good and all, but I don't even play that anymore. To me, it just doesn't stand with other classic albums.|`|41mwqPuPaa	If im still bumpin that sh*t 5 years from now I'll consider it a classic|`|xUhAqctjaa	No it's not.  And how many alternate profiles do you have?
e55d4a01420a2827c4108baf10b7d77daa	Five years younger. There are some things in the past that I'd like to change, and it was a time of opportunity for me. Five years ago I'd just started college, and wasted a lot of time working towards a major that I didn't even choose at the end anyway. I was also in the middle of a long distance relationship that I wasted almost 6 years of my life on. If I were five years older in my current situation, it'd be a huge disadvantage for me to say the least. Right now I'm working on finishing up college (I should have been done a year ago but I wasted time on one major) and getting my home business started. Not a great spot to be in if you're in your late 20s. But if I were in my late teens again, I'd know what I wanted to do, and save myself the agony of so much devotion to a major I'd change anyway, and get out of that long distance relationship that sucked away 6 years of my life.|`|AA11263103	5 younger ( it would be cool 10 again)|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Older.|`|d0b19b6e53bf5f04f7ade24285468c28aa	younger all though i look it|`|GJFBsG62aa	5 years older.

Kwzl0qOraa	Hmm, lets see...  I am 70% agreed with Ri-chan. In my opinion, I think that some of the shoujos and shonen characteristics are almost the same, but they aren't considered as copying. I'd watched High School Debut but I personally didn't like it. Many anime/mangas characters are really nice but they maybe arent creative enough, OHSHC has also the same situation like what you have said, but they have different story lines and charactererists to make the anime more interesting rather than making others finding out the similarities and getting boring. Well, what I want to say is, the most important thing is the story of an anime/manga even though it has the same characteristics.    Hope I help.  Peace out :D|`|gJhwH335aa	I assumed we are not talking about romance Shounen here and focused on non romance series.    I think it has to do the Japanese culture itself. I mean, the manga-ka usually takes every aspect of their lifestyle and experience to put in the manga (and exaggerates it). Like for example, personality. The basic personality for the manga character is    >> Stubborn  >> Idiot/Comic relief  >> Arrogant  >> Brilliant  >> Cunning  >> Violent  >> Cold  >> Indifferent  >> Nerd  >> Childish/Happy go lucky  >> Protector/Brother  >> Shy/silent  >> Pervert    Another one is the used of childhood friends which will usually becomes his/her love interest. Used in Yuyu Hakusho, Detective Conan, Kindaichi Shonen No Jikenbo, Full Metal Alchemist and the list goes on.    The boys fall in love with the girl that is older than him or vice versa. Used in Keikkashi and Dragon Quest Dai No Daiboken.    Another typical one is a girl has a crushed to a boy and afraid to tell her true feeling or vice versa. A girl hate the boys but eventually fell in love to him or vice versa. Used in Naruto and Bleach since the series has hinted or potential romance every where :|    There's also a used of dominant girls where a boys loved the girl but scared of the girl or vice versa. Used in Dragon Ball and Rurouni Kenshin.    Like I said earlier, this is probably happens because of the environment and the experience of the manga-ka and has to do with their society. It's a cultural reference.     The scene where the girl's skirt lift up every time a wind blowing or a student/teacher smack the girls in the butt is probably one of the scene that happens in Japan. :|
6rleVxuLaa	ummm..<br>  maybe, its kinda cutting it close, but whatever im 18 and my bf is 22<br>  but your are very young, too young for dating infact but whatever if you like him and want to be with him, then so be it :)<br>  keep it in mind its not legal to date when he turns 18 until your at least 16...<br>  and dont have sex at all!! cause your not legal for another 4 years.. and its not good|`|NpqAbZqpaa	if you were the mom of that 14 year old girl, what would you think.<br>  <br>  17 year olds (especially guys) have totally different expectations of being in a relationship that 14 year girls would.<br>  <br>  Also, while 3 years isn't much of a difference when it's 22 vs 25, what does a Grade 12 student really have in common with a grade 9??<br>  <br>  The boy will want sex and the girl will want the allure of being with an older boy..|`|7OLg13B8aa	As a parent I really don't think when your young you should be in a serious relationship.Enjoy your high school years by dating around and have fun not tied down to one guy save that for when  you finish school.|`|6KMU4cMOaa	The 17 year old boy is too mature for the girl who is still 14.

You are really young, and a serious relationship at this age can interrupt one way or another.|`|d02vFiJSaa	yes but be careful next year it is technically illegal and we are talking about jail time!|`|SrRsoLfmaa	um I think Its fine as long as its not to serious like someones just doing it for sex then leaveing.|`|IVJk3UHOaa	That's up to your parents sweety<br>  <br>  <br>  It seems your looking in the wrong place for advice, <br>  I agree with most here...

b32501726d33018adfee15dc84a32f79aa	Seeing the "Frampton Comes Alive" cover in that clip reminded me of how I used to swoon over the copy of the album we had in the house when I was growing up. :)    I really don't know much by him but the big hits like Show Me The Way.  But it's awesome to see that he's still out there performing.  Here's a little bit of him from back in '75...woo-hoo!    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QLJr4tjw...|`|AA10569146	I saw Frampton last year at the House Of Blues. He is a brilliant guitar player and a great singer.The guy put on a great show     Everyone had "Frampton Comes Alive" back in the day.|`|k4GqiB6taa	Show Me The Way is a pretty cool song.  I love that song live.|`|LuK19ZFPaa	do you feeeeeeeeeeeel like i dooooooooo|`|cxNLOPHNaa	Yes! "Frampton Comes Alive" was (still is) a firm favourite. Though I have it on CD... I frequently play my original vinyl version more (Yes, I still have my turntable). The subtle pops and hiss of the vinyl lend a certain warmth to the memories of my teen years that the music generates.    Link- "Baby I Love Your Way"... Covered by a few others, But Frampton's version is still the one that makes me swoon. Other's may "sing it technically better". But Frampton always has a very sincere and heartfelt tone when he sings it.|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	Do you feel like we do??? YES!|`|tyCnjhXCaa	show me the way was the intro into frampton for me, too.    i'm in you is another good song.    props on bringing up frampton!|`|1WlnkqAVaa	Can't beat "Show Me The Way".|`|QTRaACCtaa	I remember when I was a kid, "Framton Comes Alive" was like the biggest album ever.  Everybody had it.|`|bQgOppFsaa	What about him?    "Frampton Comes Alive":    Great album!|`|rcNQvCeXaa	well that was a blast from the past. Used to like Frampton and the band he came from the Herd ; he made great use of the wah wah pedal which i always associated him with.Don't know much of his work though, cheers for link .
MuK6HIKoaa	Sponge bob is always like that.    I remember watching it once, and him and Sandy were talking about Ki-ra-tay. But they said this.    "Who wants to do that anyway? Get all sweaty and dirty."  "Yeah.. and besides, we know who'd make it to the top first."    They both go "ME!"  Then stare at each other.    XD    And once he said.  "It'll be just like a sleepover!

Taraji Henson kind of has a fat flat pie face. I don't care for her look at all. Kerry Washington is much prettier.|`|DHzwr1braa	Kerri Washington is hot!

6ZU8Kt20aa	I agree. It's totally a Hallmark holiday. For most people emotions are faked and presents are expected. It's nice when your with someone you love though and can use the day as an excuse to take time out and do something fun for the two of you.|`|vKCS3AVLaa	its a day that people need to get laid.|`|Z7jZVeVOaa	You take girls' v-cards away on Valentine's Day.|`|EPki0rwgaa	Same deal as Christmas and easter. It's a marketing ploy so you'll buy expensive, meaningless gifts.|`|uwtvDgxCaa	I personally don't care for all the commercialism surrounding Valentines day....    I would rather he didn't get me anything on Valentines Day. I don't care for "forced romance"....|`|1mQlYWG7aa	Every February, across the country, candy, flowers, and gifts are exchanged between loved ones, all in the name of St. Valentine.    Because... it's a holiday silly.    (;|`|AA12270768	The card, jewelry, and plush toy industries would fail without it.    THINK OF THE HORROR! No DeBeers, no Hallmark, no Ty!    Actually, that doesn't sound so bad.|`|JgKosPJpaa	spending time with the one you love|`|RGG30rbkaa	LOL Your right everyday with your partner should be the same as valentines!! But I guess it celebrates your time with you partner. So you can celebrate your love with your partner even more on Valentines!!    BridgitteeeXOX|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	Noting, its a completely irrelevant "holiday"|`|Y2CkerIhaa	I dont know..I hate that day.|`|KmATBXOXaa	make you feel special|`|MxA90Aixaa	I have no idea.  It it just some holiday that women invented just to get more gifts.  Me and my wife don't really do anything different on Valentines day than we do every other day|`|Io7x29vhaa	nothing|`|tI7QP3dkaa	How right you are.   If people paid as much attention to their partners on a consistent basis throughout a relationship we wouldn't get suckered into the Hype of Valentines Day.    I would like to see what would happen if we all boycotted V day for a couple of years -  would the hype go away.  In most instances it is the younger generation who are helping to promote it.  Most of the older people I know don't bother with it.  Or is that an Australian thing|`|xQ8HcWdFaa	nothing but the little kids make a deal about it cause its a holiday and get to celebrate|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Hallmark|`|XnCeN07Uaa	companies...made it up..so us men feel guilty..and buy expensive stuff to women|`|nkmwGAKjaa	It is the eternal hope that something magical will happen. ;-)|`|q0Dg8a1haa	Candy and cheap stuffed animals|`|DPmU5gB6aa	Tell me about it!! Valentine's day is so overrated!!|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	There is nothing wrong with Valentines Day, its your choice to celebrate it or not. Everyone says men buys expensive gifts for their wives or girlfriends, well so do us women to show our husbands or bfs how much we love and appreciate them and our kids too, they love getting something on Valentine's day so they know we love them as much as our spouses..|`|9kLiiDzVaa	nothing|`|KH9bbeCNaa	its V day|`|qYm40x0yaa	idk but if u figure it out, could u tell me??|`|V4PMErjyaa	you are the typical man...|`|tlLoQUsuaa	hallmark and flower shops make 300x more money on that day.    other than that, nothing ;P|`|NLwfMSJWaa	idk  i dont have a valentines  T.T|`|oVRA1ze2aa	spending more money|`|gZMNQF4oaa	its mostly for men to spoil there women!  its a day for us girls to feel extra special!|`|5p2GxM4Vaa	THE CHOCOLATE!!!!!

Nr8ap8khaa	I don't think you have to buy a new remote. <br>  <br>  try removing the battery cover and try taking the tab on the bottom front of the remote that says 2 on it out. If its green on the back side just re-insert the tab with the green showing and replace the battery cover. If it doesn't have the green on the other side just keep the tab out. <br>  <br>  take the remote to the TV1 location and start by removing the anteanna on the back of the receiver. Then turn the receiver off and press the up button or press 'sys info' on the front of the box to get the system information screen. make note of the number it gives for remote address 1<br>  <br>  Point the remote at the receiver and press and hold the SAT button on the top left hand corner of the remote until all the lights come on. Let go press any number on the key pad once and then press the pound sign (#). Press the record button twice on the remote and then check the remote address 1 on the system information screen and see if it changed. <br>  <br>  If it hasn't then you need a new remote and i recommend calling Dish directly instead of going to radio shack because it will cost way more than they charge. If you have warranty it will probably be a free replacement.|`|btrMdy5Uaa	I would call dish network, each remote is coded to that specific tv, so you just need the code to program the remote for the other tv|`|O2hmjOPyaa	As awful as this response is: you have to buy a new remote.<br>  <br>  My family had Dish Network for about a year and had the same problem you have (two televisions hooked up to the same receiver box and one broken remote). There is no way (that I'm aware of, anyway) to work both televisions using the same remote. You have to purchase a new one.<br>  <br>  (Needless to say, after half a dozen similar problems, my family is no longer getting cable through Dish Network.)|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4441981_program-dish-network-remote.html?ref=fuel&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=ssp&utm_campaign=yssp_art" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4441981_program-...</a><br>  <br>  Try this website. No idea if it will work but it supposedly has the codes for how to program your remote. Good luck.

I would definitely give it a try before I decided.|`|ao5CeroVaa	yep|`|lrJQxohVaa	depends.|`|yC5wufu9aa	Google is answers.

btrMdy5Uaa	although I like Kara, I don't think she has her own opinion, she just agrees all the time, theres no drama there, drama that hasn't already been there anyway, its not fresh and new like I think they wanted it to be<br>  <br>  <br>  I think it should go back to just Randy, Paula, and Simon with a guest judge every so often|`|rHrr7zmVaa	I would rather have Paula go than Kara, atleast Kara seems very professional in her critique and is experienced in the music industry, Paula is right, 4 is a crowd and she (Paula) should quit|`|IG8s8UnSaa	I would kick the pill-popping stoner off (Paula).  She's a mess.  She has the least credentials of anyone there.|`|yJd1WwF2aa	I kick Kara's b*tch out before she know what even happened! I hate that lady!!|`|X7Lzo0VUaa	Kara or Randy should go. Randy says nothing relevant except dawg, pitchy, and hot. Kara seems to always agree with Randy and says nothing remotely interesting. Paula, although crazy, means well and does make some good points from time to time. Lets be real here, its not American Idol if there arent any crazy Paula moments.|`|C6ee83Jbaa	Kara should go!<br>  I hate this new American Idol season. <br>  The way they are  forming the Top 12 - terrible! <br>  Kara's alright I guess as a judge and person, but for American Idol NO WAY. <br>  I want it to be the normal 3- Randy, Simon, Paula.|`|opGctsEHaa	Paula should go because when I hear her talking all I hear is wah wah wah wah wooo (like the adults in Charlie Brown cartoons).  No one can understand what she's saying.  At least with Kara you can understand her.|`|df7eb800ff0d3d2aec218aae79b6f9cfaa	Randy or Paula|`|809f02e44041ffc6ba4b12719d107dcaaa	Kara is irritating.|`|wFMhmZCYaa	Kara|`|ztug2gLjaa	I think Paula needs to go to rehab.|`|AA11436163	I don't like Kara.|`|snOSqJdwaa	KARA DEFINITELY! She's nothing more than a Simon-Wanna-Be! I've been trying to give her some time, TIME'S UP! - Don't like her egotism at all!!!|`|2FNfyxVqaa	Honestly, i couldn't stand Kara in the beginning of the season but now I think that she is pretty good and being that she has a musical background i think she is good. <br>  <br>  MY VOTE GOES FOR PAULA.<br>  <br>  she is the "lovable" one but to me i think she wouldn't be missed. I think though that American Idol already has the familiarity and people are so use to seeing simon, randy and paula that if paula were gone it would be weird for some people.|`|7MJSPGnhaa	Pauls because she never has anything relevant to say about any of the contestants.  How is telling someone they have nice legs or they look beautiful going to benefit them in a SINGING competition?! <br>  <br>  i like Kara because she is honest and can criticize someone without looking like a "b."  Randy is cool and Simon is just brutally honest and frankly america seems to vote how Cowell tells them to...so bye bye Paula!!
f3a5bf1addf25ba2d214ddfa6fba9330aa	i'm happy she's back ,but, i gotta say -even for a soap,DAAAAMN- give the gal a minute to wake up and catch her breath before you hit her with- you almost died,your brother's dead and you have his heart,greenlee and ryan are back together,this is your sisters fiance and your husband fathered their baby........jeez,even for a soap this was way too much info ,way too fast,lol.|`|4c18bd7d4cbd71342eeea220e83e71deaa	I am very happy shes out of her coma I love Zach and Kendall altough I have to admit I like Zach and Reese to they have alot of chemistry.  I think that kendall is going to start acting like josh (mean) cause she now has his heart.|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	I am glad she is awake and not getting paid to "sleep on the job" LOL  It will make thing more interesting now although I bet Reese wishes she would have died.|`|AA11714109	i am glad she woke up.she is cool and straight up.but after she hears all the things that has been going on,she may wish she was still in a coma.and i feel sorry for poor reese if she is in love with zach,cause between her and erica they gonna give her pure hell.|`|bd035cd5fbed641889c4230d224d60d3aa	I just hope she stays awake. I mean really how many comas can one person have? It kind of reminds me of Felicia on GH years ago. She had amnesia how many times!|`|MAe6QyrMaa	i am glad b/c i think Kendall's personality is going to change. She won;t forgive Bianca and remember Greenlee said that there is something different about Kendall. I think this going to be a great story line!!|`|AA12336927	I very happy she is awake, very happy because this story line is finally going somewhere. Iam also a little sad, because knowing Kendall, she will not forgive Bianca very easily, nor Zak if all this plays out like I think it will. ( I seriously think that Zak set her brother up to come to town and killed him so Kendall could have his heart) AND IF Zak keeps getting close to Reese, Kendall will not even remember that she slept with Aiden in a crisis situation, she will only see Zaks infidelity. So this is really, after all, not going to be a happy little time on AMC    OH and I didn't even touch on the Bianca baby daddy thing! Can you even imagine?|`|jHDeIPEfaa	I am thrilled Kendall is awake. I can't wait until she nails Bianca for having Zack's baby.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I am happy and now she is gonna start ripping people to pieces for all the stuff that has been going on. I can't wait to see what happens now. I read she throws Bianca out of her house! Big Sister is mad!|`|97158e12e6c17080ec04a0a2b2456b2aaa	In a way im relieved that they are finally getting on with the storyline by waking her up, but im also worried about her reaction toward Zack and Bianca. Then wheb Reese and Zack get closer its just gonna tick her off even more.|`|AA12319351	I'm very glad she is awake, now all the fun can begin, and we can get away from Dr.Evil and his hoochie momma, Krystal|`|AA12390047	I'm happy she's awake, but I think SHE might wish she was still in a coma when she has to deal with all that's been going on.|`|sH1LgUN4aa	i think it's funny cuz now that she's awake reese is going to start catching more feelings for zack|`|AA10437764	I was kinda hoping she would stay in a coma for a while and take some of the light of here for once|`|Qe9y6MnTaa	I used to think Kendall was annoying...but she'd been gone so long and I started to miss her... so I am happy. I can't wait for all the drama to come!!!!! :D

O19RNngmaa	Even if you keep trying to listen to it, that probably won't make you like it. I strongly disagree with the person before my comment*they do not lack talent and originality, but its all a matter of opinion. Its kind of like asking: Why do some people love the color black? You might find it ugly, but it doesn't mean other ppl don't like that color.    EDIT: Bennett H, there is no such thing as "Good Sense In Music," any music is good music as long as the listener likes it. You shouldn't tell people not to listen to it if they like it. And some gay people might find it offensive for you to say that a band is gay as an insult.|`|Yc9uPziVaa	Their music is easy to listen to. i love the killers but not FOB. fall out boy wasnt that bad when they first started out... now they suck.|`|IWD93HW7aa	Their singers have nice voices, their music is easy and fun to listen to. But people do have different taste in music, people who like Fall Out Boy and The Killers might hate the music that you think is great. It just depends on the person.|`|tyCnjhXCaa	i agree. cookie cutter bands with no originality, no real musical talent. basically.. they have no identity alone, and their music is dumbed down like rap/r&b/hip-hop crap.|`|qAfnWKQCaa	Wimps like nice sounding things. Fall out boy and the killers sound nice. But me, I like harsh and mean, something that kicks your eardrum in the @ss. And I hate songs with meanings.|`|Hzz6Z1aCaa	I like the killers but i can't seem to bring myself to like fall out boy. It's just different peoples opinions. It's like many people like hip-hop but i really don't find that fascinating.|`|A5nYGJVNaa	i hate fall out boy. but the killers are good. their music is just fun to listen to and has meaning. everyone has different tastes in music so you really can't say it sucks. maybe you just don't like successful bands. i dunno.|`|IDC7BijGaa	They're both pretty good. Maybe it's just because they're so mainstream that you don't like them. I can kinda understand that.|`|c4dFGEERaa	hmm how can i put this buddy    theyre just too.....gay....for people who have good tastes in music    sway far away from those 2 bands..neither have any musical talent.    fall out boy is just a gay imatation of punk  and  the killers have an annoying singer who sings to below average electronic music.|`|7mNcPZcOaa	I LOVE Fall Out Boy! They're my favorite band. The killers are ok but Fall Out Boy is where it's at, man! haha.   Just from looking at the people I know that don't like them, it's all about how you relate to the songs. If you connect personally with a song you're, of course, going to like it more.   The reason I like FOB so much is that I can relate to the lyrics so well. Especially the song I've Got a Dark Alley and a Bad Idea That Says You Should Shut Your Mouth. plus I just love the singer's voice! haha.  So if you really want to see why people like them try to understand the deeper meaning behind the songs.|`|fb4669026c3ecb7b4a6f8c9954ffc1d9aa	i can't help you with fall out boy but the killers are pretty good. if you really listen to 'smile like you mean it' and 'on top' from their hot fuss album. smile like you mean it is kind of beautiful.

So your not obligated to tell them, so no i would not.|`|aKBqMLuhaa	Yes I would. Cheating is cheating no matter what sex the other person is. I have been guilty of cheating and I have learned that it is not for me. I killed myself with guilt.<br>  Besides my BF and I have already discussed many 'what if' situations and we are open to non-traditional ideas of relationships.

GNtWomekaa	Blonde Jokes      There was a blonde called Sally.   Sally was poor, and decided that she wanted to win the lottery.  So one night, she got down on her knees and prayed for a win.  The next day nothing happened.  The next night she prayed again. This time, god spoke to her and said "Sally, work with me here, buy a ticket!!!"       3 blondes were stuck in an elevator, the phones didn't work either.   1 blonde said to the other 2, "I think the only way to get help is by shouting together, okay?"  So they all shouted, "together, together, together!"       One morning a blonde stormed out of her house, went to her mailbox, opened it, then slammed it shut. She did this several times.   Finally, her neighbour asked, "are you ok?"  The blonde replied, "No! My stupid computer keeps saying, 'you've got mail'"       John came home one day to find his wife painting. She was sweating, wearing a ski jacket and a fur coat at the same time.  "Why are you wearing that?" he asked.

Her mother told her this was wrong, she must just say, "I'm Jane   Hudson." The minister spoke to her in Sunday school and said, "Aren't you Mr.   Hudson's daughter?" She replied, "Well, I thought I was, but mother says I'm   not."         One day a little girl came running into her house yelling, "Mommy, I got five   dollars!" The mother was curious, so she asked her child where she got the five   dollars from.  The little girl replied: ''Tommy down the street gave me five dollars for   doing cartwheel while he sat in the tree.  The mother told her daughter: "Don't you know that Tommy is just trying to see   your panties."  ''OOOOhhhh'' said the little girl.  The next day the little girl came running into the house yelling, "Mommy, I   got ten dollars. The mother asked, "Where did you get the ten dollars from?"  The little girl replied, "Tommy down the street gave me ten dollars for doing   a cartwheel while he sat up in the tree and laughed."  The mother replied: "Didn't I tell you that he is...''  Before the mother could finish, the little girl said, ''Wait Mommy! I tricked   him, I didn't wear any panties today.''    A Cub Scout trop was half an hour late to its den meeting.

Even if you are not, and you have spyware protection for you computer, then you might want to try, " surfthechannel.com "   It might, and might not get your computer infected... I use it to watch my shows online, it's free, and you don't even need to be a member to watch anything you want...

Just a guess though.    The planet Zi and its ion-rich oceans gave birth to a large number of metal life forms. Some went on to become the humanoid Zoidians. Others became the creatures known as Zoids, mechanical living beings with a core as a central life-force.      Watch : http://www.watch-zoids.com/|`|IXuYZvcMaa	I'm sure it's ZOIDS.

c4dFGEERaa	hahahaha i was like holy **** wrong section    1. Planetary Duality - The Faceless  2. Twilight of the Thunder God - Amon Amarth  3. Overcome - All that Remains  4. The Tide and It's Takers - 36 Crazyfists  5. The Way of All Flesh - Gojira    jimi is a legend but he aint my cup of tea    my fav guitarists are:    1. "Dimebag" Darrel Abbot - Pantera  2. Mark Morton - Lamb of God  3. Alexi Laiho - Children of Bodom  4. Dan Donegan - Disturbed  5. Mick Thompson - Slipknot    and pop rocks are unexplainable bro|`|KEk728Gsaa	Watershed by Opeth  Planetary Duality by The Faceless|`|6D4a6PoVaa	1. In Rainbows by Radiohead  2. The Odd Couple by Gnarls Barkley (if that counts as rock)  3. Consolers of the Lonely by the Raconteurs  4. Stay Positive by the Hold Steady  5. Accelerate by R.E.M.    Hendrix as a guitarist is the best ever IMO.  As a band, the Experience ranks up there with the greatest 60's bands.|`|DibFrwxlaa	I put Hendrix fairly high although of late I've been listening to the classics less and less.    I don't think I even bought 5 rock albums from 2008.      One I did was by some chick punk band called Civet.  It was okay.  At least it sounded like actual punk.    -----------------  Sal reminded me, I did buy Consolers Of The Lonely.  I liked it a lot more than Broken Boy Soldiers.
RW72apDwaa	According to Wikipedia, filming began in October 2008 and ended in November 2008.

She invites him in. So they are sitting down and the guy says,'you have such beautiful breasts ill give you $100 if you show m e just one of your breasts.' She thinks about it - $100! sure why not. so she shows him one of her breasts.     He pulls another $100 bill out of his pocket and says I'll give you this other $100 if you show me your other breast.     She agrees and shows him the other one.     He says that was really nice, thanks her and leaves. When her husband gets home she tells him that his buddy stopped over.     He says "great, did he drop off the $200 he owes me?"         its dirty but you gotta admit its funny|`|SD1EOMv9aa	hahahahahah!! u wanna hear 1??    So theres a blonde cop and a blonde driver. The cop stops the blonde and says "licence and registration please". The driver goes "wats that"  The cop says "oh you know it's square and it has a picture of you" So the driver looks thru her purse and finds a mirror and gives it to the cop. then the cop was all like "Ohh your a cop too?"

2sF9YfsYaa	1. Adam Lambert<br>  2. Allison Ireheta<br>  3. Megan Corkrey<br>  4. Nick Mitchell<br>  5. Kris Allen<br>  6. Mishavonna Henson<br>  7. Jesse Langseth<br>  8. Matt Giraud<br>  9. Matt Breitzke<br>  10. Kai Kalama<br>  11. Jasmine Murray<br>  12. Jeanine Vailes<br>  <br>  Top 3 going through this week: Adam Lambert, Allison Ireheta, Megan Corkrey<br>  <br>  Wildcard Options: <br>  Matt Giraud<br>  Mishavonna Henson<br>  Matt Breitzke<br>  Kai Kalama<br>  <br>  This week was tough for me as far as the wildcards go...I think there were more good performances this week than last week and it's hard to say which 4 stood out the most.|`|2ab0f4f84a201bc39a3fb4a1b64db222aa	well,<br>  -I loved Allison, specially the song she sang.loved it.<br>  i could definetly see she was putting all of her into the song,,absolutely AMAZING, I was listening to Celine Dion's original version and i have to say Allison did  better than her! seriously, u need to compare!<br>  I prefer her version, no kidding. fantastic.<br>  so she has potential to make it to the top 12, without a doubt.<br>  <br>  -Adam Lambert was also very good, as Paula said, it kinda was like his concert and that was a very special memorable performance. Not sure if it's what I like, but i guess he's gonna make it.<br>  <br>  -I also liked Megan Corkrey, she has such a unique style, i've never heard before, and her song sounded really beautiful, she definetly has chance to make it.<br>  <br>  -Mishavonna is other girl i remember from last night, she was also one of the bests, although not as strong as the 3 above, I liked her performance better than others.<br>  <br>  -Jesse Langseth: Loved the song she picked, it was kinda boring but also better than others, who knows she may make it today, her voice is beautiful and that was a special performance.<br>  <br>  -The rest was kinda boring for me, Jasmine unfortunately dissapointed me, she was like trying so hard to sing the song well, Jasmine has a great voice don't get me wrong but unfortunately her performance gave me nothing which is something very dissapointing for me.then I remember the two Matts who gave me nothing, or boring or not really good. Kris Allen and Kai Kalama also boring, Nick Mitchell NO WAY, and Jeanine, sorry but she has no chance.<br>  <br>  So my top 3,, I'd say Allison, Adam and Megan.<br>  <br>  let's see tonight,<br>  Andy
AA12390047	I've been hooked on AMC for years and years.  Just started OLTL about 10 years ago.....would watch the beginning after AMC and got hooked. Both have good and ridiculous storylines so I just ff thru the stupid parts or characters I don't like.|`|FwU6GL4Laa	Ive been hooked on The Young and the Restless since I was a little girl and still watch it daily...I used to watch The Bold and the Beautiful but the story lines have gotten to crazy.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	For the most part no, in fact other than some nighttime soaps like "Dallas" and "Knot's Landing" and "Falcon Crest" in the 80's I had never watched them at all. (Maybe a very brief "General Hospital" spell off and on in the early 80's)<br>  <br>  That is until last summer,  for some time, I would turn on my TV just before the Young and the Restless, so I could get the news. I started watching 5 minutes, then 10, then finally watching the whole show sometimes. I started watching about the time Victor's wife died and then he went 'missing', I sort of got away from it, then the Catherine CHancelor thing came along and I started watching again a lot.<br>  <br>  I refuse to watch any others, because I know I must have become an addict when "Who shot JR" was going on. I had stayed away for a long time. If I watch any others I'll need Soap Opera rehab.|`|AA11111233	Sometimes.  I like to watch Young and the Restless and Bold and the Beautiful|`|rabjcdjHaa	Yes! Days of our Lives is my favorite soap opera!|`|944e834948591e9af24fa28ac5ecb873aa	OMG! YES! I live for Y&R & OLTL. I watched B&B for yrs but that just sucked so I stopped.|`|UxqSH3rOaa	I'm not easily hooked on them really. My mom, aunts, and grandma all watched Guiding Light before me and that's why I started watching it. That's my favorite one. About a year ago I got into As The World Turns. It took awhile to learn the characters and what was going on. All My Children caught my eye a few months ago when there was nothing else on and I started watching that off and on.|`|8GDd6lrnaa	not really but i.m a long time fan of general hospital. what i like is no re runs and it comes at a good time to take a break. and being young during the luke and laura thing.|`|C4knGt7Iaa	Ohhh, yeah...bad hooked.  Days, GH, OLTL.  I'd have to say GH is my favorite w/ DAYS a close second.  I've only been watching OLTL for a short time but its growing on me.|`|ce35927379e187a9a9405823379c0faaaa	I get hooked on certain storylines as long as they don't last for very long.

It's based on the future and it's technology with an anti-terrorist unit that keeps cyber crimes under control, in a nutshell.

Spending his days flirting with any female he can see, responsibility is the last thing on his mind. Life takes an unexpected turn for him as one day he returns home to find himself with the fulltime task of caring for his 5 year old cousin. Kippei's aunt Miyako had disappeared, appearing to have abandoned his cousin, Yuzuyu. With Kippei's lack of responsibility and knowledge of childcare and Yuzuyu's injured heart with the disappearance of her mother, their time together is in for a bumpy ride. Based on the manga by Maki Youko.    Skip beat  Genres: Shoujo, Romance, Drama, Comedy  Summary : The story revolves around a young girl named Kyouko who went with her childhood friend, Shou, to Tokyo to pursue his dream of becoming an idol. Despite of supporting him, she overhears him dismissing her as boring wallflower. Furious, Kyouko vows to get her revenge to defeat him by entering the entertainment world.    Itazura Na kiss   Genres: comedy, drama, romance   Summary: In the romantic comedy story, a high school girl named Kotoko finally tells a fellow senior named Naoki that she has loved him from afar since she saw him on their first day of high school. However, Naoki, a haughty "super-ikemen" (handsome male) with smarts and sports talent, rejects her offhand. Fate intervenes when a mild earthquake ruins Kotoko's family house. While the house gets rebuilt, Kotoko and her dad stay at the home of her dad's childhood friend...whose son is Naoki    Tokyo Mew Mew  Genres: adventure, comedy, magic, romance, science fiction, slice of life, supernatural  Summary: On her first date with the cutest boy in school, Ichigo is zapped by a mysterious ray that scrambles her DNA with that of the endangered Iriomote wildcat. The next day, Ichigo discovers that she has developed the agility (and occasionally the ears and tail) of a cat, as well as the power to transform into a pink-haired superheroine, Mew Ichigo. She and four other girls, each endowed with the genes of a different "Red Data" animal, have been selected for the top-secret Mew Project, which aims to protect the Earth from an alien menace known as Deep Blue    Full Moon O Sagashite  Genres: comedy, drama, romance, supernatural   Summary: Twelve-year-old Kouyama Mitsuki was devastated when she was diagnosed with a malignant tumor of the throat. She had made a promise to the boy she loves that she would one day become a singer, but her illness made singing impossible. To make matters even worse, two angels of death, Takuto and Meroko, appeared to Mitsuki and informed her that she only had one year left to live. This news provides an even greater motivation for Mitsuki to fulfill her dreams, and with a little bit of divine intervention, she begins her quest to become a professional singer so she can be reunited with Eichi before time runs out.     Lovely complex  Genres: comedy, romance, slice of life  Summary: Risa Koizumi, taller than the average girl, and Atsushi Ootani, shorter than the average guy - their constant bickering and comical love-hate relationship is well-known throughout the school. They act similarly and love the same music, and their friendship is full of laughing, shouting at each other, and of course, lots of jokes about one another's height. But when Risa notices her feelings for Ootani growing, she's worried. She doesn't know if he can ever see her as more than a friend. With her friends rooting for her, she struggles to make him see how she feels about him, and that a romantic relationship between a tall girl and a short guy can work. Oblivious Ootani doesn't make things easy for her, but she stubbornly perseveres in her own unconventional way, determined for her feelings to get through to him, and finally be returned. If only she could do it without driving herself and everyone else crazy in the process...

wbytU9szaa	Do I like them? More like love them to death!! They're one of my favorite bands of all time. Pick one song by them that's my favorite...that's just evil. I'd rather give you a top 40, but I need to keep this relatively concise. How about a top 10? That should be hard enough.  1. B.Y.O.B. - lyrics make no sense, but I love the riffs, sudden tempo changes, and the music video.  2. Toxicity - great song, great video.  3. Chop.Suey! - first song by them I ever knew, and it's a classic.  4. Hypnotize - so damn catchy...and it just started playing on shuffle, no lie.  5. Question! - not sure what it (or the music video) means, but I have a feeling that it's deep.  6. Cigaro - if you don't know cigaro, you don't know anything about SoaD. Period.  7. Dreaming - very confusing unless you know the lyrics...then its only minorly perplexing  8. Sugar - gotta respect their early days and those crazy outfits.  9. Radio/Video - Serj and Daron singing together makes this song amazing.   10. P.L.U.C.K - acronyms at their finest  Honorable mentions:  Kill Rock n Roll , Prison Song, Shimmy, Pictures, Highway Song, Revenga  So basically, to answer your question, B.Y.O.B. But I'd be interested in hearing your favorite song(s) as well.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	no, not at all|`|d7bf572dbd1b69fb93ce34ee4b827357aa	Holy mountains cos I love the melodic singing and Sugar because that's great for a good mosh.|`|nZpSM7ngaa	toxicity cuz of its great drumming,  violent pornography because of its great singing, BYOB for its metal,  Old school hollywood for being awesome.|`|YwqfYVPbaa	Yes I do. Favorite song is probably Marmalade (one of their older ones) or Prision Song. Favorite album is probably Toxicity.|`|d4b7e67e1621a19cd35c6b4fe13be84baa	I like them, I don't think I have a favorite though.|`|78d567ba4ef552df04b4e4bac0f97f4daa	Sugar or Aerials|`|ynQ54Ocraa	shimmy|`|x9lhP76Yaa	I like lonely day. But it's the only thing I've heard :P|`|9wGHEmHIaa	well prolly chop suey bounce or cigaro cuz my **** is much bigger than yours LOL|`|P312DIm3aa	Hard to say there are so many great ones  Probably  Suggestions,Toxicity,Lost in Hollywood, Dreaming, War?, IEAIOU, Marmalade,Chop Suey!, BYOB       ocassionally  Virginity
N4IxRoIcaa	What has the world come to?|`|VqFzDnvOaa	agreed.  leave it to disney to be able to take a horrible thing and blow it up.|`|9BYzGJaZaa	Yes! It's even hypnotizing little children. Now some of them think they can get whatever they want because they like to "pretend" to be Hannah Montana or a person from HSM. I can't even walk into a Wal-mart with my friends without going crazy seeing all these Hannah Montana accessories. It's actually sad.|`|41176c95fa5bc7ae9bfc86dd82b2e387aa	i completely agree. its crazy|`|cfZg0ecGaa	my gosh it is soooo anoying!!!!!!!!  its all about cartoon network!   im a geek! :3|`|b08f23f64cf67ed7e34f8ed0781dfd16aa	I don't think anyone disagrees.  It's way too overrated.|`|FOAJht6yaa	I agree that it's really annoying, but I think it's really good for those people because the process takes so long and they've worked hard for what they want to do. So it's great for them that their dreams are working out.|`|nATIgXK6aa	Yeah i feel this way too i mean half HSM is lip synced and Hannah Montana (Miley Cirus) is truly a pretty bad role model for young girls.
jMAn10NOaa	keep him as friends - can't go wrong there... maybe you'll get back together someday.|`|kBSlNEL2aa	By asking this question, it proves that you are still thinking of him in that way.  Why don't you ask him not us, he will be the only one who knows if you don't.  If you still have feelings for him and the trust is already there, then y'all already have something that most married couples don't have... so try it.  What do you have to lose?|`|Ubb4RiXLaa	probly means he knows he passed up on a good thing, but maybe had feelings of insecurities at the time he was with u that kept him restless in ur relationship; even though you may not ve gotten back together(and he may not be able to come back depending on what all has transpired) he probly knows at the back of his mind that u were a good thing to happen to him|`|YfCRmWeSaa	he trusts you because you're a friend to him<br>  you're over thinking this, makes me think you want to get back together with him|`|AA11325161	he trusts you because you were together for a year so he knows you hence he trust you. maybe he still have feelings for you yes but i will say just remain friends, who knows maybe in the far future you people might be back together. this situation reminds me of one of my girlfriends dilemma as she is too good friends with her ex-boy friend (just friends and no more)and she currently has a new boyfriend.|`|kRfZRg6Caa	I trust all my friends, if i cant trust them then why have them as friends? You are reading way to much onto this!|`|DW2Zlqhcaa	well i think that he either still has feelings for you or he just wants to be friends.<br>  <br>  you'll never really know until you ask him.|`|CYhOr4s7aa	i recon a few screws are lose up there ,  or he really still likes you|`|9BB5H7aJaa	You can still trust exes.<br>  There is no harm in that.|`|lIpjuMTHaa	Did you really need to type it like that. Really annoying. He trusts you because just because you arent in a relationship anymore doesnt mean trust goes out the window. That would be an incredible waste any time spent loving each other.
FZKFLTyLaa	True!!
exc0TyOEaa	Fart.|`|aIXeSThOaa	why not?<br>  what happened?
AA11504809	it was very sad at the end when earl shot and killed maxine, maxine was my favourite character. I want him to pay dearly for what he done. there was no preview of next weeks episode after last nights, but next rachel hands in her resignation (because it's her fault earl has lasted in the school so long) but before she goes she finds out from paul and bolton that the gun in the school at the beginning of the series actually belonged to earl and not his little brother denzil (who everyone including his whole family have seemed to have forgotten about him), she tries to get denzil released from prison. steph and Janeece help each other after maxine's death. last nights was only episode 8, there's 20 episodes in this series. but I don't think rachel leaves in the end because she's mentioned in the next episode (11th march episode) summary.|`|kPmzj4Rcaa	i watched it [:<br>  yeah maxine did die, and i don't think it was the last episode.<br>  and i don't know what happens next 'cause i'm not a waterloo road addict [Y], i hope this helps, no need to say thanks ?|`|MTPoGd1qaa	Freaky, didn't want her to die!! Don't like Earl, pscho!<br>  <br>  My mates are extras:)!!!<br>  <br>  Oh i know what happens in next week's episode, but i won't spoil!!|`|bGr1UuEDaa	i did it made me cry. she did die. it really spooked me at the end. there is another 12 episodes left.|`|ROXeXlGVaa	You can watch the episode on bbc iplayer <br>  <br>  it was a great episode yes Maxine did die she was shot by Earl he was then arrested the head of pe had a fight about Bolton boxing with tom in front of an inspector chlo and donte went for a scan at the hospital<br>  <br>  Kris|`|e76k5edZaa	yes maxine did die<br>  and i am not sure what will happen next <br>   ?|`|5BOV76bmaa	I couldn't believe it when maxine died! i was so shocked. i hope its not the last episode, it may be though because they usually end on a tragedy|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	I watched it.<br>   Yes she did die.<br>   No it is not the last episode.
H2cMlG9Kaa	well, seeing what you want your series to be like, you can just give it simple magic girl plots.  -find the magic object  -or save the princess or whoever  -destroy the witch or evil overlord  -make one of the ordinary girls who gets power turn psychotic and tries to make the world "better" but ends up doing more evil than good    you don't need very complex plots for shows like this.

dd235370a6c4569337cc8a8e1d335770aa	it was a  sad day in history when he took his life|`|W1vdfn1yaa	courtney definitely killed him. before he "shot himself" he had so much heroin in his system he wouldn't have been able to even pick up the gun.  that and courtney tried hiring an assassin but the guy wouldn't do it and 2 or so weeks later the assassin was found dead.|`|nZpSM7ngaa	hes a genious,  i blame courtney love for him dying.  she had him murdered|`|O6JUN1yvaa	im also 15 and i love him soooo muchhh i think hes so hot and i wish he was still alive i love nirvana|`|m3L6pLBaaa	yeah he does have blew eyes one this way and the other the other way. all about alcohol and drugs.|`|R0NfdgzLaa	he was enigmatic, and he didn't go out of his way to please people, which is probably why he has a bad reputation with some people.|`|V1hxvQukaa	i agree. he was a musical genius. he was also an artist... i read "cobain unseen" and it had a lot of his artwork in it. it was interesting...
c4dFGEERaa	nirvana was my favorite band of all time when i was growing up.     basically put: a genious who fucked up    R.I.P. Kurt|`|TdrgZwnoaa	Uh! He's dead. Been dead almost as long as you have been alive. And no one knows for sure what drove him over the edge except Courtney Love.|`|4uSRVZNNaa	he was a quitter|`|LuK19ZFPaa	im 16, and i love him too despite the fact other people only see him for doing drugs. you and me are pretty alike that way i guess|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	He's cool.  I prefer his band though.|`|cUjcn2lsaa	Nirvana is my 2nd favorite band! :)    Kurt Cobain was misunderstood and overrated by his fans, underrated by the haters.     What pisses me off are poser Nirvana fans. All they care about is Kurt and how he died. They don't know any of their songs except for 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' and have no idea who Krist or Dave are.  And the haters......they don't listen to Nirvana because they think Kurt is overrated because of his death. What kind of excuse is that?    But it's unfortunate that he died so young.     R.I.P. Kurt|`|k4NAnEYpaa	Kurt will remain the best even though he lost influence in a lot of people after committing suicide. Kurt Lives!!|`|dfUHVcEwaa	I think he was a great musian, a drug addict and suicidal|`|ddc7688c9403e9b2641228799e0da4b0aa	i totally agree with everything you said!  he was amazing!!!  i only wish i was lucky enough to grow up in his time  i wish i could see just one nirvana concert :(:(|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	Kurt Cobain is cool.    He pretty much redefined the definition of a rock star because he didn't feed off his ego and groupies.     He's also pretty misunderstood though, everyone is just like "HAHA KURT COBAIN WAS A SAD SACK HE KILLED HIMSELF" but he was actually funny.    Too bad rock stars went back to sucking in this decade.|`|6vgTVPtEaa	i love him   he is a great musician and had a great band too  i do agree with u when it comes to him getting ruined by all the media stuff|`|xxHHAEp4aa	Even though his guitar parts are not that hard to play I have only respect for Kurt. Without Kurt and Nirvana who knows how many bands would never have been inspired. He only killed himself because of the media and press because they got way too out of hand.|`|BRVF1b4gaa	most overrated person in history|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	Kurt was wonderful. He seemed so, I was too young to actually know who Nirvana even was. I've fell in love with their music. It's too sad to have seen Kurt go, but it seems like he was extremely depressed. I wish I could have gotten to meet him. I know alot of people think he's overrated or just a dirty drug addict that could play the guitar and sing, but he's more than that. He was comparable to a more modern John Lennon if you will; one that was on the outskirts of mainstream society but making a difference even if not everyone followed.
ioNTTqKfaa	LMAO, you just answered your own question. The albums you listed are all mainstream albums.    No one really cares what you listen to. Just don't come on here running your mouth off about hip hop. Its called trolling.|`|baSks9O4aa	Because those people love hip hop, but not the mainstream stuff.    If you don't like it, that's okay. Whatever works for you. But respect others opinions as well.|`|PSuBYFSyaa	ok son, you got your opinion, we got ours. personally, i think that hip hop is better than rock. thats because i enjoy listening to hip hop more than rock|`|hpdZDBVQaa	You should have put this on a blog because it's not really worth reading on here.     I like music in every genre.   Jazz and Hip Hop are tied for my faves though.     I A.M. white.    (and it's NEWS FLASH).|`|ll2y4YIGaa	dude settle down.  opinions are like heads,  everybodys got one,  mines hip hop   yours rock  BIG DEAL  and who cares if your white or not,  there is no racial barrier on music.
ZYICyUAGaa	To dream that you are at the mall, represents your attempts in making a favorable impression on someone. The mall is also symbolic of materialism and the need to keep up with the trends, fads, and/or the latest technology.<br>  <br>  To dream that you are running with others, signifies festive and prosperous times<br>  <br>  To see people you know in your dream, signifies qualities and feelings of those people that you desire for yourself.<br>  <br>  To see people you don't know in your dream, denotes hidden aspects of yourself that you need to confront.<br>  <br>  To see friends in your dream, signifies aspects of your personality that you have rejected, but are ready to incorporate and acknowledge these rejected aspects of yourself. The relationships you have with those around you are important in learning about yourself. Additionally, this symbol foretells of happy tidings from them and the arrival of good news. <br>  <br>  To dream that you are in a room, represents a particular aspect of yourself or a particular relationship.  Dreams about various rooms often relate to hidden areas of the conscious mind and different aspects of your personality. <br>  <br>  To see an appealing or comfortable room in your dream, signifies opulence and satisfaction in life. <br>  <br>  To see a ring in your dream, symbolizes emotional wholeness, continuity and commitments.

The shop owner pointed out three identical parrots on a perch and said, "The parrot to the left costs 500 dollars."    "Why does that parrot cost so much?" the man wondered.    The owner replied, "Well, it knows how to use a computer."    The man asked about the next parrot on the perch.

GNtWomekaa	Blonde Jokes:::     There was a blonde called Sally.   Sally was poor, and decided that she wanted to win the lottery.  So one night, she got down on her knees and prayed for a win.  The next day nothing happened.  The next night she prayed again. This time, god spoke to her and said "Sally, work with me here, buy a ticket!!!"       3 blondes were stuck in an elevator, the phones didn't work either.   1 blonde said to the other 2, "I think the only way to get help is by shouting together, okay?"  So they all shouted, "together, together, together!"       One morning a blonde stormed out of her house, went to her mailbox, opened it, then slammed it shut. She did this several times.   Finally, her neighbour asked, "are you ok?"  The blonde replied, "No! My stupid computer keeps saying, 'you've got mail'"       John came home one day to find his wife painting. She was sweating, wearing a ski jacket and a fur coat at the same time.  "Why are you wearing that?" he asked.  His wife replied, "The paint instructions says, 'for best results put on 2 coats'"       - I Took scarfe back to store, it was too tight.  - I Tried to go water skiing, but couldn't find a lake with slope.  - Baked turkey for 4 & 1/2 days. Label said 1 hour per pound - i weigh 108  - I got excited, i finished jigsaw in 6 months, box said 2-4 years!  - I didn't have dinner, i had to study for my blood test.  - I called my friend because i needed her phone number.|`|JLkqq2C0aa	ok this isnt funniest ive ever done, but 1st thing that comes to mind:      For a field trip, me and a bunch of friends went to a hotel in VA Beach. We split into 2 rooms, 4 people in each. We decided, unanimously, that 1st person asleep would be pranked. We all went to one room, and at 3am, one of my friends went back to our room to sleep, knowing the consequences, but he was tired.  We had a key to that room, since we were staying in it too, so we practiced what we were going to do in the room we were at before making our move. When we got it down, we ran down the hall (not wishing to be caught be the chaperones, cause we'd be in big trouble) and waited outside his door, all 7 of us. One of my friends had a roll of duct tape (just wait...).  We quietly opened the door and snuck inside. He was lying PERFECTLY for our prank, arms crossed across chest, lying on back, on top of all of the covers with the blanket on top of him. We put one guy on either side of the bed, me at the bottom where his feet were, and the guy w/ the duct tape to the side. Also, one guy was holding the door open for us so we could get out fast.  The other 2 guy doing nothing yelled "GO!" I pulled the blanket off while my 2 friends jumped on him while holding each side of the covers. He was completely wrapped, struggling and confused. We pinned him down then duct taped the covers around him so he was completely pinned. We bolted! Running down the hall to the other room, laughing.  We got back, waited 15 minutes, and went back with a more hilarious plan. The room next door to ours was full of guys we were with too, so we decided to include them, because we knew they were still up.  We went back, and he was sleeping EXACT same position as before. Perfect! We wrapped him, duct taped him (and his mouth shut), and pinned him. When he was secure, we picked him up (I was taping this whole thing btw!), ran him down the hall on our shoulders, he was struggling (lol imagine what a nighttime stroller saw through the glass up on the 6th floor of a hotel :D), then we propped him up against the door of the other room, knocked and ran into our room. I kept the camera running outside in the hall.  When we watch the film, what happened is they opened the door, and our bound-and-gagged friend fell inside yelling (muffled) and struggling to get out. They were SO confused lolololol!|`|hXVOs9DWaa	One of my friends was jerking off and he missed a stroke, hit the bed post and broke his wrist.

But no the walrus isn't really playing since different notes are being played during the song the walrus would have to hit certain keys and if you watch the video she clearly doesn't do that. It's still cute though.|`|aCDWwsisaa	Here's the video:    http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopi...

TM7o75ODaa	First off, lucky youuuuu :). Wearing holey jeans is a good idea- definitely country. For a shirt, I'd suggest to getting a t-shirt by the artist at the concert beforehand. Or if you don't feel like standing in a long line, you can never go wrong with a flannel shirt :). For accessories, you have to wear a cowboy hat. Going to a country concert without one is like a fashion crime. For jewelery, don't go over the top; stick with simplicity like a thin chain with a small charm and go with studs if you have your ears pierced. Bracelets are optional but don't go with too many since you'll probably have your hands in the air. Hope the tips work. Have fun!|`|xvU9LyMTaa	Well, if you're right in front, I would get a shirt with the artist's picture on it. You might be lucky enough to get it signed.|`|wA8Dyhq7aa	Wear what you want to wear, what you'll feel comfortable in.  How about a t-shirt of the singer?|`|h1IYS0dbaa	A kimono...|`|ZWt50qkeaa	who are you going to go see?  whoever it is you're luckyyyy.  any shirt you want.  a cowboy hat would be cute :]|`|zA34N6Jwaa	Wear ear-plugs.|`|KQpDsKh7aa	hot dress and cowboy boots

nuNlV9M7aa	I love Imogen.   She makes the most amazing music.    Speeding Cars was quite piano orientated compared to most of her music, well, her latest stuff anyway.    Here are some artists, some of whom are often associated with Imogen that you might like :    Tori Amos  Ani DiFranco  Sigur Ros  Charlotte Martin  Dresden Dolls  Joni Mitchell  Tracy Chapman  Damien Rice  IAMX  Robots in Disguise  Bjork  Frou Frou (Imogen Heap & Guy Sigsworth in a electronica duo)  Regina Spektor   Nine Inch Nails  Alanis Morissette  Kate Havnevik  The Postal Service  Milosh  Mileece  Pixelh8  Beth Hart  Holly Brook  Nerina Pallot    If you haven't already, check out both of Imogen's albums - I think they're great although very different.    Here are some individual songs:    Hey Jupiter/ A Sorta Fairytale - Tori Amos  On The Radio/Apres Moi - Regina Spektor  Heavy - Holly Brook  Stromata/Everytime It Rains  Where have all the cowboys gone? -Paula Cole  Dogs - Damien Rice  I'm No Angel - Dido    Hope you like :]|`|FOAJht6yaa	Imogen Heap was in some sort of collaboration music in a band called Frou Frou, so it by default is similar. Jem makes music sort of like it, but I think it's a lot closer to other music we've heard.     There's a song by Joshua Radin called "Only You" that's mixed with Imogen Heap. I really like it.|`|b08f23f64cf67ed7e34f8ed0781dfd16aa	Yupp, I love Imogen Heap.  The only girl I think is closest to her style that I enjoy is  Feist, she's great!  Listen to 1,2,3,4 or  My Moon, My Man.    And of course, you know Frou Frou is   the same as Imogen Heap... Other than that,  I'm not sure.. I think you should listen to The Shins. :)    Maybe even Vanessa Carlton, she has some pretty kind of dark songs. Listen to Dark Carnival. I love her!! I met her as well.

Since earliest known records in about 2300 BC; astrology has played a role in the shaping of culture and politics throughout history. In fact, despite the modern conceit that we live in an "enlightened, scientific and literate society", nearly every major newspaper in the world contains an astrological horoscope section.    Unfortunately, Astrology is bullshit.    4300 years ago, when the ancient Babylonians invented the practices we now call astrology, they were earnestly trying to understand the world they inhabited. The Babylonians did not have anything resembling the scientific method of thought, but did the best they could.    Babylonian astrology was based on the "theory of divine governance". This theory encompassed the belief that events on earth, including famines, harvests, wars and treaties were the direct result of the will of a large number of gods. These gods were active and regular agents affecting earthly and human matters, unlike the distant or non-involved "God" that many modern Christians may recognize.    Starting from the Babylonian's observation that the fertility of the soil depends upon the sun and rain from the heavens; and that mischief and damage done by storms and floods were to be traced likewise to the heavens; the conclusion was made that the gods had their home in the heavens.    Observation of the night sky, coupled with the desire to predict important events such as storms, or crop failures led quite naturally to the early Babylonian astrology.    The Babylonians divided the night sky into small discreet regions, each the home of one of their gods. These regions, although renamed and reshaped since 2300 BC, are what we now call constellations. There are 88 constellations defined and recognized by the International Astronomical Union, these 88 regions of the sky encompass the entire sky visible from the surface of the Earth. This is obviously many more than the 12 commonly associated to zodiacal astrological star-signs familiar to every modern newspaper. To understand the significance of these 12 zodiacal constellations, its necessary to understand a little about the mechanics of our solar system.    the plane of the eclipticThere are nine Planets in our solar system, varying in distance from the sun, from the nearest, mercury, to the farthest, Pluto. (or Neptune, as Pluto has recently be reclassified, losing its planetary status) The planets in our solar system all orbit the sun in the same direction, and in the same plane. That is, all the planets follow orbital paths which are more-or-less in line with each other, defining a flat plane with the sun at its center. This is called the "plane of the ecliptic" because if three celestial bodies, such as the sun, the moon, and the earth briefly "line up" creating an eclipse, it is on this plane.    From the surface of the Earth, the plane of the ecliptic can be drawn across the sky as an imaginary line. Observations of the planets and the sun will always be along this imaginary line.    The constellations of the zodiac are defined as those which are bisected by the plane of the ecliptic. A person's "zodiacal sign" is the constellation in which the sun is found on the date of their birthday.    constellation of Ophiuchus The zodiacal constellations are:       1. Sagittarius     2. Capricorn     3. Aquarius     4. Pisces     5. Aries     6. Taurus     7. Gemini     8. Cancer     9. Leo    10. Virgo    11. Libra    12. Scorpio    13. Ophiuchus        Some people might be surprised to learn there are not twelve, but thirteen constellations in the zodiac. In the 2nd century AD a Greek astrologer and mathematician named Ptolemy published a set of astrological tables which omitted the thirteenth constellation, Ophiuchus. Ptolemy's 12-sign astrological table was based on the sun spending an equal amount of time in each constellation, corresponding to the 12 months of the calendar. He is known to have used the then-2400 year old Babylonian astronomical data. As a popularizer of horoscopic astrology, Ptolemy may have sacrificed accuracy for simplicity.    Whatever scientific merit there might have been in the still-developing field of astrology, Ptolemy's tables mark a point of divergence from the later science of astronomy which replaces it. Present day horoscopes published in newspapers still use the same tables.    If people still believed that events on Earth were controlled by supernatural beings living in the sky, modern horoscopic astrology would have a significant problem.    That Ptolemy's tables were based on second-millennium BCE Babylonian data brings up the issue of precession. The Earth, as most people know, not only orbits the sun once per year, it also rotates on its own axis once per day, similar to a spinning to
sOAOyue7aa	I gotta agree, the stuff Busta's been puttin out this year is GAHBAGE, but I still like him. He's never been about beef, he's real versatile, and honestly stays truer to his roots more than a lot of rappers who have blown up. Some of the stuff on The Big Bang was his best work ever. Besides, I've never been about choruses, so I can stand (sit) here and say to your face (to your computer behind a computer) that I like Busta Rhymes and the energy that he brings to every song, even if the song is GAHBAGE. Its still better than half-60% of the stuff they play on the radio.    At least he didn't say "West Afican Money"; they got 100 BILLION dollar bills thats only like 300$ here in the US.    Peace,  LCAS|`|uB2K3XD0aa	i don't hate busta...he's cool but he ain't my favorite.  I have to admit though that i have purchased a cd of his though. it was the big bang.  but i only bought it to listen to the dr. dre tracks since it was his first (and last) cd from aftermath (he was dropped). but he is one that i could tolerate...unlike a lil wayne, a kanye, t-pain, t.i. etc. check this new song by him...it not good but not bad either...take a listen...(prod by dr.dre btw)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0ifwKxvE...|`|SJ8gNEWuaa	busta rhymes sings.  no he raps.  wow.  just stating the facts.|`|cqAL8lmqaa	hahaha hes songs are alright, but i dont know much about him so i cant really say if i like him or not|`|FWKEw2jCaa	hold up, you cant be serious, you have to really listen to more Busta man..  go listen to his past albums and if you still think the same something wrong with you or you're just into rock or pop..|`|21ewjYXKaa	busta rhymes is a terrific artist.  he is a great rapper actually and can flow real well.  he is very creative in his style and his music videos.  he has put in alot of years in the business and has influenced alot of artist in the game right now who grew up listening to him.  he is one of the most respected artist in the game and will be remembered.  also he has one of the most reckonizable voices in hip hop.  and ofcourse not everyone likes him, everyone has an opinion.  but you have to give him credit on his creativeness and how he does good collaborations.|`|a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	He's great!

tmpy2yaoaa	Well when you audition for American Idol, or any other reality show (So You Think You Can Dance etc.) you don't automatically go to the 4 judges (Simon, Paula, Kara, and Randy). You first audition to random people, and if they think your good enough, they put you through. FYI, they put some bad ones through too, to make the show more entertaining. After you go through that, you audition to the producers of American Idol and if the producers want you to go to the "real" judges they put you through. They don't really show 1100 contestants. All those people in the stadiums that they show on t.v, don't all get the chance to be on t.v.    Hope i helped :)

Mnm35sjNaa	Destiny might be a romantic (or tragic) notion but, in the long run, is fatalistic; sapping us of purpose and motivation.

Since earliest known records in about 2300 BC; astrology has played a role in the shaping of culture and politics throughout history. In fact, despite the modern conceit that we live in an "enlightened, scientific and literate society", nearly every major newspaper in the world contains an astrological horoscope section.    Unfortunately, Astrology is bullshit.    4300 years ago, when the ancient Babylonians invented the practices we now call astrology, they were earnestly trying to understand the world they inhabited. The Babylonians did not have anything resembling the scientific method of thought, but did the best they could.    Babylonian astrology was based on the "theory of divine governance". This theory encompassed the belief that events on earth, including famines, harvests, wars and treaties were the direct result of the will of a large number of gods. These gods were active and regular agents affecting earthly and human matters, unlike the distant or non-involved "God" that many modern Christians may recognize.    Starting from the Babylonian's observation that the fertility of the soil depends upon the sun and rain from the heavens; and that mischief and damage done by storms and floods were to be traced likewise to the heavens; the conclusion was made that the gods had their home in the heavens.    Observation of the night sky, coupled with the desire to predict important events such as storms, or crop failures led quite naturally to the early Babylonian astrology.    The Babylonians divided the night sky into small discreet regions, each the home of one of their gods. These regions, although renamed and reshaped since 2300 BC, are what we now call constellations. There are 88 constellations defined and recognized by the International Astronomical Union, these 88 regions of the sky encompass the entire sky visible from the surface of the Earth. This is obviously many more than the 12 commonly associated to zodiacal astrological star-signs familiar to every modern newspaper. To understand the significance of these 12 zodiacal constellations, its necessary to understand a little about the mechanics of our solar system.    the plane of the eclipticThere are nine Planets in our solar system, varying in distance from the sun, from the nearest, mercury, to the farthest, Pluto. (or Neptune, as Pluto has recently be reclassified, losing its planetary status) The planets in our solar system all orbit the sun in the same direction, and in the same plane. That is, all the planets follow orbital paths which are more-or-less in line with each other, defining a flat plane with the sun at its center. This is called the "plane of the ecliptic" because if three celestial bodies, such as the sun, the moon, and the earth briefly "line up" creating an eclipse, it is on this plane.    From the surface of the Earth, the plane of the ecliptic can be drawn across the sky as an imaginary line. Observations of the planets and the sun will always be along this imaginary line.    The constellations of the zodiac are defined as those which are bisected by the plane of the ecliptic. A person's "zodiacal sign" is the constellation in which the sun is found on the date of their birthday.    constellation of Ophiuchus The zodiacal constellations are:       1. Sagittarius     2. Capricorn     3. Aquarius     4. Pisces     5. Aries     6. Taurus     7. Gemini     8. Cancer     9. Leo    10. Virgo    11. Libra    12. Scorpio    13. Ophiuchus        Some people might be surprised to learn there are not twelve, but thirteen constellations in the zodiac. In the 2nd century AD a Greek astrologer and mathematician named Ptolemy published a set of astrological tables which omitted the thirteenth constellation, Ophiuchus. Ptolemy's 12-sign astrological table was based on the sun spending an equal amount of time in each constellation, corresponding to the 12 months of the calendar. He is known to have used the then-2400 year old Babylonian astronomical data. As a popularizer of horoscopic astrology, Ptolemy may have sacrificed accuracy for simplicity.    Whatever scientific merit there might have been in the still-developing field of astrology, Ptolemy's tables mark a point of divergence from the later science of astronomy which replaces it. Present day horoscopes published in newspapers still use the same tables.    If people still believed that events on Earth were controlled by supernatural beings living in the sky, modern horoscopic astrology would have a significant problem.    That Ptolemy's tables were based on second-millennium BCE Babylonian data brings up the issue of precession. The Earth, as most people know, not only orbits the sun once per year, it also rotates on its own axis once per day, similar to a spinning to|`|d69856882943ee44ddbbe3cb4e643f2aaa	Yeah, it's like Thomas said.

PFVqo1wkaa	hello. i'm Taurus too (april 23). so here it is. the thing is that taurus girls dont like to continue/make a relationship that they see as unrealitic or not possible to happem again. (my english sux sorry). but if they find a realtionship pretty good, its likely to last for a long time.  BUT! if they find the relationship is unsecure or time wasted, they quit immediately. your girlfriend prefers a long term relationship. i understand u wanted to give it to her, but maybe that wasnt enough or its likely about what u didnt do not something u did. sometimes i feel like, i dont feel love from others very well, so i searched about it and found out that taurus ppl are bad at feeling love from others. thats why im sometimes very demanding. kk ok hope it helped.|`|3bc1c908a9e2290010f0d56a160d5da8aa	Although she may not want a relationship with you she still may show some signs of jealousy.  It's a Taurus trait.  Also, unless she has someone else in her life, she may try and hold on to you in case she doesn't find anyone, and that's not fair to you.  Do not wait for her, start dating other people.  She may realize what she is missing but you may find someone else who is better suited for you.  Good luck

AM4T90xKaa	First thing I'd listen for is pure talent (skills). After that, I'd want to hear something unique, but not to the point where it's unlistenable. As a producer, you don't want to take on a band just because you like the way they sound; you have to ask yourself if a reasonable number of people would be as into as you are. Otherwise, it's a waste of your time and money.    You can take a band with great musicians in it that don't write lyrics very well, and refine their skills. But you can't take a good writer in a crappy sounding band and expect a miracle.    As for genre, anything that requires talent, which rules out pop. (Sorry, but in my opinion it doesn't take much skill to play the same four chords over and over again in different patterns, while the singer carries on about his/her high school dramas.)|`|wA8Dyhq7aa	Quality and uniqueness.    Two things sorely lacking in mainstream music today.|`|N62uLMf3aa	they would have to be original|`|LuK19ZFPaa	talented orginal guitar riffs  original and catchy lyrics  7 minute songs with 4 minute solos!|`|cUjcn2lsaa	originality/uniqueness, catchiness, talented musicians, singer should have a good voice|`|UMyyuEvRaa	music. ha  i like it when bands have a variety of sounds. take relient k (one of my fave bands). they have a ton of fast paced, rockable songs that are fun and upbeat. but they also have songs that are slower.  i like a kick-butt drummer in a band. but the guitar has to be pretty wicked too. the singer should definitely be able to mesh with the music and become another instrument, if ya know what i mean.|`|5b218420f6e58d52278efc9527f29a95aa	I have to be able to hear something by them without knowing who it's by, but be able to identify that it's them. They have to have some kind of musical distinction.|`|novD5hkDaa	Fast-paced and good lyrics.|`|hhcrxPWLaa	Originality.  I wouldn't want the same cookie-cutter stuff that is like the music today.|`|PwjxhDAXaa	i would look for someone who u personally enjoy listening to and they make u want to listen to more of their songs|`|pkWX3rbPaa	original, good lyrics, catchy|`|tyCnjhXCaa	people who aren't worried about image. those who play the music for the music and their fans. it would definitely be real rock.. as in, not hellogoodbye, panic! at the disco, fallout boy, etc.. more like 90's rock or newer bands such as disturbed, godsmack, etc. my model bands would be led zeppelin and tool.|`|NFDZu3ujaa	emotional lyrics and creative lead guitar would pull me in    A unique sound in a more familar sort of way (confusing much?)    and also someone who doesn't care about what others think of them as a band, and isn't going to change there style just for the mainstream, but someone who plays and writes the music for the music, not because there getting famous off it|`|roUanZs4aa	i'd want a band with unique, and original songs,   but i'd also want the songs to be catchy, preferibly pop rock  i'd want them to have lyrics that were thought provoking, and inspirational; songs listeners can relate to  as to image, i wouldn't want them to look like clean-cut abercrombie models, but i wouldn't want their wardrobes to scream "hot topic" either...|`|c4dFGEERaa	i like metal, so thats a huge factor for me. inside of the genre i look for: (in order)  1. Talented Musicians  2. Something that is original and heavy  3. Musicians who are filling their full potential  4. Good chemistry and work habit (I like DIY [do it yourself] bands)  5. Catchy chorus|`|1mYIF1uYaa	All of the above ; image, lyrics, skills.  And about genre, I would prefer Alternative or Pop Rock.|`|G57RZLsnaa	i want it to be unique and really show the musicians' talents. Take a band like Primus for example. Their music is centered on the bassline and the drums whereas most music is based on the guitar and/or the vocals.    If u want to do something really original, have a band thats dominated by the bass. Like have two or three basses, all playing guitar-like riffs and harmonics, and make a guitar play rhythm. Do not have a vocalist that screams, it would be nice to hear some true singing. And dont have any doublebass crap going on, i hear that way too much nowadays
UspK4SQBaa	Neither.  It was written by songwriter Diane Warren for Celine Dion.|`|pkWX3rbPaa	a woman i think    "even when i dream of you, the sweetest dream will never do"  i can't imagine someone writing that about their daughter..|`|MOcOoB6Eaa	i thinkk it was for a woman|`|GpNo5LaQaa	I don't know who it was written for, but it's used in the movie Armageddon as a song about Bruce Willis' characters daughter.  It's suchhhh a beautiful song.|`|VI3pZSKjaa	the song was written solely for the purpose of the movie Armageddon  .  Where the lead singers daughter starred in.|`|aGOBuJtKaa	A woman, some of the lyrics of a song would be really creepy if he was singing to his daughter.|`|1T1zvQudaa	i think for a woman
cLW7vFUGaa	Yay, I basically watch nothing BUT short series! xD It's nice to have a story wrapped up nicely without fillers or confusing plots to get straight. I dont know much action stuff, but I can suggest a few comedies.      (Listed in reverse order of length)    Azumanga Daioh  Comedy / Slice-of-Life  26 episodes  [A group of crazy girls and their even crazier teachers go through high school life. Features a kid genius, a hyper genki girl, a strong silent type who secretly loves cute things, and a hilarious complete-space-case.]    Lucky Star  Comedy / Slice-of-Life  24 episodes + OVA  [By far the best slice-of-life out there. Endlessly hilarious and, actually, surprisingly relatable. Takes some of the most random everyday problems and experiences, and acts them out with ridiculously cute high school girls. Also rife with references to other anime, most particularly to]    The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya  Comedy / Sci-Fi  14 episodes  [Such genre labels demean its true awesomeness. A girl forms a club to meet aliens, espers, and time travelers. All three soon show up in the picture, but she has no idea. It turns out, she is the equivalent of God  whatever she desires, comes true, and the few that know this have to bend to her every whim to keep her away from her melancholic tendencies that might bring her to inadvertently destroy and recreate the world. I suggest following chronological order rather than the original convoluted broadcast order if you don't want to wrack your brain:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The...  And also, please don't get discouraged by the bizarre Episode 00! It gets better!]    Ichigo Mashimaro  Comedy / Slice-of-Life  12 episodes + OVAs  [Azumanga Daioh, but with everyones age cut by a third. Thats all I can really say, haha. Its funny, but Im not sure if it might be perceived as too girly. I already cut out a lot of my favorites for being too shoujo-ish:  Mahoraba ~Heartful Days~ (24 episodes)  Bottle Fairy (13 episodes)  Ouran High School Host Club (26 episodes)]      Slice-of-life is a great genre to get into if you like shortness and comedy.    Extra examples of short series:  Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei (first season)  Minami-ke (first season)  Genshiken (first season)  Popotan  Midori Days  Chobits  KimiKiss: Pure Rouge  Neon Genesis Evangelion  ef ~ a tale of memories  Hatenkou Yuugi  Hanaukyo Maid Team: La Verite  Oh, and I'll second the School Days and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (season 1) of another answer, because I've watched them both, but...I don't know, I'd call them more horror than action. Beware. Especially of the VERY misleading beginning of School Days...    I hope you find a good new show to watch!|`|PmqAN8Mpaa	elfen lied (13 episodes) very violent, kinda has a dark depressing tone to it, but it is by far one of the most violent anime's i have seen. Limbs get taken off blood everywhere and everything.    Higurashi no naku koro ni (26 episodes) another very violent anime. Also one of my favorites.     School Days (12 episodes) - at first you will not like it, or think its okay (depending on your preferences). by the middle of it, you will think its getting good and will be like whoa!, by the end you will probably hate every single character in the show, but you will be blown away and wont be able to get over how epic it was.    The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (14 episodes) I thought this anime was pretty funny. It is probably one of the most random anime's you will ever see, as they air the episodes in a random order. Sounds confusing, yes I know, but it really isnt. Its got a little bit of action in it as well.    Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-Chan (as said by answer 2, first season has 8 episodes, but there is a second season which has 4 episodes) It is pretty hilarious, not any nudity, but its a little bit on the perverted side, but thats what makes it funny.|`|KSC02NcLaa	Mizu no Kotoba : Very Short.

It's only 14 episodes long and it's hilarious!

He literally turned the band from alt. rock to bubblegum pop the moment he joined.    Without Ronnie, Escape the Fate is completely worthless.    (Just my personal opinion)|`|c94edb500cc7fe12b1da30dfd93db57caa	I haven't been to one of their concerts but most concerts last about about 3-4 hours (that's taking into consideration the openers and supporting bands).  It will probably end between 10:30 and 11, I don't know about NY but most concerts have to close by midnight I think.  Add on an extra half hour to get out of the venue!

Finally available in eng dub. Enjoy!

6wZbsPn2aa	"We all want to be appreciated for our unique identities. But when we decide to change who we are for someone we love, we can surprise even ourselves with who we've become." -J.D. in voice over mode    This was in s07e03 called "My Identity Crisis"    Within this episode, Carla dreams in English and she always dreams in Spanish (language). This makes her feel like she's loosing her Dominican heritage. She informs her husband Turk about this, and as a result, he decides to learn Spanish to surprise her- make her feel better.     Here is the second part of that episode...the voiceover begins at 8:25.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMFknAVvX...

mKfQQRDuaa	Aquarius men do not like women who are clingy. They love independent women who can hold their ground.  However please note that his moon or ascendant sign may have to do with his personality being affectionate in the evening and detached in the day.|`|F32mOSMEaa	well you think a human is without emotion. we Aquarius trust are intuition we know when you really like us and we know when you just want to mess around with us.     we are psychic.|`|eFGiMy5Iaa	Dont worry about it. Just be yourself and let him be.  Aquarius tend to be detached and aloof anyways. No Aquarius wants a smothering girlfriend. What it sounds like to me about the "night and day" theme seems like a lot like me (especially with the people I like). I'm normal during the day, but when it comes to night time, I just have this sense of rebelliousness in me which often makes me more sociable, hyper, and more outgoing. ;) Hopefully that helped.

Where his constituents write to him the letter is sent to be examined by the relevant department so that he can send an appropriate reply and it is flagged before being returned to his office, which means it can't be ignored.<br>  <br>  I wrote a letter to a high ranking politician whom I knew personally raising some serious issues and I know for a fact that he didn't get to see it. Instead, I was fobbed off with meaningless answers from civil servants. He would have replied in very different vein, as I knew. The difference was that I was not one of his constituents.|`|Mu7rnIoMaa	You can write and tell him what you think of him!  It will make you feel better if nothing else!<br>  <br>  You letter will be read......to see where you live!!!!!!!   If you live in a solid Conservative or Labour seat you will not hear back!<br>  If you live in marginal constituency you will get a reply saying "he is doing everything he can and life will get better soon if he is allowed to continue......"     <br>  He is only thinking of the General Election now and sod the population (except in marginals!)|`|HnNJAJeJaa	I think it would be a waste of time..Cant see him being interested in anything we have to say.....|`|h1PCSrgDaa	Even if he did get the letter, can he read???

He's completely insane, but he's entertaining.  Bennet is my second favorite, but he's been bogged down by too many scenes where Claire is whiny and bratty with him.
d69856882943ee44ddbbe3cb4e643f2aaa	Ok, just try to be sensitive. Always be nice. Never say things bluntly---ever. Always try to think of his feelings and how he may be perceiving things. Always. He will really appreciate that, and eventually probably fall in love with you if you just do the aforementioned things! And DON'T try to control things. DON'T. He is has just as much right as you to be free to make his own decisions. So, be conscious of that, at all times. Also, try to be open-minded. Stubbornness pushes people away.  Be loyal, be dedicated, do NOT be possessive or jealous. Be nurturing, be caring, be affectionate. Express your love in words, and in your tone-- Express your feelings. That's it.|`|miUFTfzfaa	hehe i havnt forgot you btw if your wondering       what i think you should do   whach moves together take friends so it dont seem to much like a date take him and you mate places to eat   you no hang out with him 1 on 1 get to no him LET HIM GET TO NO YOU   i say that coz i no how hard that is for tauruses lol being1 myself     i hoped that helpd girl     yours     crow boy aka grim

ptwIHv09aa	I will assume you have seen the video in your link. Watching the video, it's about embracing what he feels. He is looking at her in a whole new light; accepting the possible chemistry. At the end, he lets her walk away without fighting for her to stay; lets her make the choice.    But JUST listening to the song by itself, I interpret the phrase "I'm giving it away" to mean he is in love with her; 'giving her his heart'. "Is this what you wanted, 'cause I'm willing to change": in this section, he is confronting her in a way, asking her what she wants, is he enough.    Hope this answers your question, and thank you for getting me hooked on this song, I love it!!

I call mine The Water Angel. this is like a submarine similar to a submarine used in Final fantasy unlimited..... it is similar to a rollercoaster but this one is more faster and it is located inside a large aquarium....LOL....      2 Why is your fave anime your fave anime out of all anime?  ----> Kyo Kara Maoh... before but now i guess it's xxxHolic.....    3 Why is your fave anime character your fave out of all anime characters?  ---> Yuko! I don't know but one thing I'm really sure she's one of my Fave anime charrie!  4 If the cartoon network decides to stop showing anime, how much do you think their ratings will drop by (no this isn't actually happenning, just randomly thought of this question)    ---> I used to watch cartoons and animes in there but.....

It's named after Sesshomaru's dragon strike. anyways, it would have a lot of twists and turns and higher drops than ever imagined and it would be the fastest coaster in the world!    -This is a rollar coaster baised on Naruto Uzumaki. The ride goes around him like an outline. Then, the ride goes down from the ear, and then, it makes a loop, and it makes its way across his face and then, make another fall, the ride goes straight towards his hand. From his hand to his stomach to his feet, the ride is fast and fun. I just made it up now.    2 Why is your fave anime your fave anime out of all anime?  ==>>Inuyasha; I honestly dont know. I am completely obsessed with it! I guess it's cause it has a great story line and the fight scenes never get old or boring no matter how much you watch em    -I love One Piece    3 Why is your fave anime character your fave out of all anime characters?  ==>>Sesshomaru from Inuyasha; I dont know.... I remember when I first saw him I thought he was a complete jackass who had no life. but as the anime continued I guess my fave went from Inuyasha to Sesshomaru somehow :P    -There are a bunch of reasons for why my fav. is my fav. I don't know how to explain but its just that I like characters that are very mysterious and serious.    4 If the cartoon network decides to stop showing anime, how much do you think their ratings will drop by (no this isn't actually happenning, just randomly thought of this question)  ==>>I think it will go down quite a bit, but I cant pin point on how much, maybe about 30% which is a lot    -I'd say 25%|`|ybjj5WIhaa	1 Someone is making a theme park.

I'm 30ish and I never miss an episode.    Lauri was my favorite but she decided to focus more on her family than having the cameras around  - which I applaud!    Vicki is tricky and I love to hate her.    Tamara should be arrested for child neglect. The epi where her and Simon were moving her workout equipment and she kept screaming at her little girl to leave her alone - she kept telling her to 'shut up' that she was too busy for her...Omg...I was stunned! She did this in front of cameras - I lost all respect for her. And then..the kicker was when she tried to get Gretchen trashed.    I like Gretchen and I feel for her b/c I have been in a similar situation - a relationship with an older man who was terminally ill. A person would not invest their time and energy into taking care of someone - going through all that she has - just for Jeffs money. She honestly loved him and it saddens me to hear/read people trashing her. Shes a beautiful vivacious woman who can and will make her own path in life..she just happened to fall in love with a man old enough to be her father, who was loaded and sick....    Lynn - she needs to reign in her girls quick or they're gonna end up in some serious trouble and then Lynn and her hubby are going to wonder why. I get so tired of hearing her say what good girls they are and the whole time they're sneaking alcohol right under their parents noses. WAKE UP!!!!    I like Jeana too but I feel bad for her b/c Matt treated her so badly and now her sons are too and she can't even see it. Thats so sad. Hopefully they will watch the show and realize they are acting just like their dad.

Ow3O7h4caa	Mercury retrograde inspires one to re-do, review, re-read, repeat andre-think off of which are conducive to learning and retention of knowledge. This depends if he follows the Sun or in 1st hosue position to the Sun, this would indicate shy nervousness which sometimes expresses in halting speech, lisping, difficulty in pronounciation etc...    Mercury retrograde requires the mind to be indecisive, whereas , if it turns direct, then theperson becomes decisive. Thisdoesnot meanb that Mercury retrograde is all that bad. Compare itto a diamondthat needs polishing.  In retrograde motion, it is better to avoid signing important paper. mercury often plays havoc with typing skills in which typing errors can slip in a Will or important document and, thenative overlooks it. A retrograde is an excellent time to take refresher courses , or to complete unfinished prohects.. etc...    ONce it moves direct, the person will have the ability to speak more distinctly, and marks the time when one realizes they cannot read and make a dedicated effort to correct this flaw in their education. Mercury rules the use of vocabulary, knowledge, spoken and written as well as the hands and reflects postitively or negatively in cooperation of hands and mental command. Usually, when it moves direct, it could mark the year someone becomes more dextrous or beginvs to enjoy making things with thehands.|`|6tHA0QQXaa	im not sure but,Left-T gave a Good Answer :-)

AA11279973	I've seen several Rigolettos ... its not a Rigoletto thing it was just such a wonderful performance they couldn't hold back ... been to several of those when you are WOWED you can't back hold it in no matter what ... its similar to applause in a movie theater no performer hears it but it just can't be held in|`|c54d7cbacdb6451ad9d6f339416a6cb0aa	A wise dutch man said it best:  "There isn't much difference between the audience that visits 'comedy night' and the audience that visits the opera. The main difference is; an opera audience is over estimating itself."|`|vsy4QMHMaa	Shocking ... yes, I'd expect a more civilized audience.|`|ThKkn5fKaa	That is a little odd.  I wonder if it's specifically a Rigoletto thing.  It's definitely one of the more well-known operas.  I wonder if people who are very familiar with the music just get excited.  And people are like sheep too.  All it usually takes is one idiot, and then everyone follows.  Baaah.    And just a second thought.  Maybe also because it is a well-known opera you don't have the typical Met audience.  Maybe there were more non-season ticket holders and such in that audience.    It's like every time I ever hear Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto performed live.  After the 1st movement there is always a very long applause.  It is so riveting and virtuosic, with such a big ending, that I'll admit that even I will clap for a few seconds, and that's saying a lot because I'm otherwise a very mannered concertgoer.  Still though, clapping between movements and clapping before a piece is finished are very different things, and the latter just seems to be a little immature.  On a side note, why have I only heard this done with opera music and not symphonic music?|`|ZQaeTgNEaa	opera audiences have been like this since the emergence of the art form.|`|tM6xoexWaa	Once upon a time, the opera was like a rock show.  People clapped, booed, paid no attention - a cool place for snooties to hang out.  Somewhere along the way, we made it silent and weird.  There's nothing stranger, as a performer, than finishing or almost finishing a piece of music and getting nothing (i.e. church performances, finishing the first mvt. of a multi-mvt. piece).    I would bet a million dollars that if you asked the actual opera singers how they felt about such applause, they prefer it.  They weren't booed, they didn't have garbage thrown at them, and it wasn't a strange silent moment - but rather the audience cheered like crazy people in appreciation of such a fantastic job.    Of course, there's always the possibility that the audience was not, in fact, the seasoned NY audience.  I too, have seen recorded live performances where the audience 'behaved' themselves and don't really think much of it either way.  It's nice to know the audience loved it.
XbsswQDoaa	The Beatles one would probably be worth quite a bit if it is actually signed by the Beatles.

They are open to anyone...as long as they are not stubborn and routinely like them =). ha, funny, huh? It's pretty easy to attract a taurus, you just gotta have some sex appeal, look CUTE, not be stubborn or have strict ways of doing things, and since they are ruled by venus, they do appreciate someone who is a little mars-like ..confident.. go-getter, action-oriented etc|`|BXe211Fvaa	bahhh  this is why i dont let astrology affect my life or choices.  interesting to always read about but not to let take over relationships.

Ow3O7h4caa	Wow...    Interesting research. Thanks for the insight. They started investigating this and their was a documentary on this last year and the ones doing the documentary said that it was impossible for the towers to crumble under the weight.  Their had to be something else involved. They stated that the floor that was hit by the plane was rigged with explosives and thats what made the tower crumble...... interesting facts.    Oh and they also pointed out that the government was behind that to justify their means to remove Saddam ....  Their was other  stuff that didn't seem right. Anyways, nice research on your part.

It's true, I've put a great deal of the once thought chronic cough behind me. Miraculously, I can still smoke a little socially without a real need. I've actually kind of got the best of both worlds thing going. It is amazing how much better I feel in general though.

But if there is one thing I hate it's being a sheep and following the herd, I wised up to the fact that it was incredibly stupid to drive Myself to ruin just because My Friends were doing it.

The answer is no, although if I had kept up on my delinquent ways about 13-14 years ago it would have been a definite yes.  Back in those days I was a mess and can think of times where I wasn't sober for a complete day for a few months on end.  I also smoked around a pack a day but, to my credit, I never hit the 'hard stuff'.  Somehow I knew if I did I'd like it too much so I just steered clear of the whole thing.<br>  <br>  These days is a different story.  The pot is gone, alcohol is pretty much nonexistent, but I do have the occasional smoke although lately I've gone up to 2 weeks without one.  I look back at the time before and realize how much better I feel;  the depression is gone and overall I feel much better physically (except for this cold which has been killing me for 2 weeks now).  Would I do it differently if I could relive those days?  No way. that's what makes me the person I am.  And I would not change a thing.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	I don't think so, some people may think it has but I don't, I drank before the Rock scene, and drugs I don't do anymore, unless you call a toke here and there as drug use then yes.

Hot topic, this!! <br>  <br>  Me? Nah ~ my partying is pretty subdued nowadays.... a little smoke, a little beer, an occasional mixed drink ~ that's all I'm good for anymore!<br>  <br>  I will say, tho ~ that I contracted hepatitis c somewhere along the route of my life, and that caused some problems that HAPPILY responded to treatment.

So that has had some lingering issues.<br>  <br>  Fortunately I stopped smoking 14-15 years ago, and I only drink in moderation, and haven't touched drugs in 15 years.  There is no way to be 100% sure if i dodged the bullet, but I have definitely bettered my odds.<br>  <br>  <br>  I do know that all that partying played merry hob with my metabolism.<br>  Actually, most of my health issues came from 1) Playing Football.  You would be shocked what that does to the body in the long run, even your teeth.  and 2) My old job.  Being around chemicals on a daily basis, I seem to have developed a pretty bad allergy toward most chemicals, which ain't great. and 3) Fighting and Work Related Injuries.<br>  <br>  I used to have a temper issue, and I got in a fight with a forklift..... but lemme tell ya, you should see how the forklift looks.<br>  <br>  I am 33, but physically am in about the shape of a 45 year old, due mostly to structural damage to my spine and joints.  Moshing may not have helped it, but I hardly think the sex and drugs did anything major there.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, if I can avoid having another surgery on my arm, I have a pretty good chance to reverse some of the damage, as the worst has just been weight gain related to being unable to workout.

8cb155d3453a69c18555f503c5705ab4aa	I had an abortion when I was about 26, or 27. I was working part time, the guy who was the father was a sweet guy, but a tiny bit emotionally unstable, like not ready to be a father unstable.At the time, I was out partying a lot.Bars, drugs, probably a bit emotionally unstable myself. So, when I found out that I was pregnant, getting an abortion was a no-brainer.I was not ready for a baby, and my body was not healthy enough to carry a baby. No regrets about the abortion. At all. My deep regret to this day is the fact that I didn't tell the father. We had drifted a little apart, but he showed up on the day I had the abortion. He was waiting for me at my door when I came home. When I told him about it, he cried, and punched a hole in my wall. He later committed suicide. I carry that around with me to this day, and that was about 26 or 27 years ago. Make sure that you do what is right for you. Consult with a counselor, talk to the father. Make sure that you won't have any regrets 30 years from now.
hguvsRo8aa	Moon sign is your emotions and how you see yourself, and how you would react in an emotional situation.  A cancer moon is protective of their senstive feelings, so they would hide them(like the crab with a soft interior and hard exterior), scorpio is secretive and would be reserved about their emotions. Pisces are shy, maybe they are being outgoing to hide their sensitivity.    Sun sign would be how you come across to people on a daily basis. like people you know well. Your moon might only show when you are in a proper relationship with someone or your closet friends.  Just my opinion:)  I'v a cancer moon, my closet friends see my sensitive side. i dont act like a gemini. I'm indescisive at times, and do come across as social at times, but i am a libra!:)|`|ZyXpGLl4aa	Wrong, most people are a lot more complex. Cancer, Gemini  or anyone else.|`|t4Mc1Al8aa	I have to disagree. The water moon signs are actually more emotional than the sun signs. The difference is that they tend to hide emotions more and better because the moon sign governs your internal self, the subconscious that is hidden from others...unless they are close to you. The outward appearance that many of the water moons have is a FACADE. Their emotions run deeper than one could ever imagine. Maybe you're noticing a different aspect of a person, such as their rising sign.      and for the record, you don't know how deep your friend with a moon in cancer's emotions run. as i stated, we HIDE our emotions. you're not in her mind, so you don't know what she's thinking about. everything with us is HIDDEN. it's a facade. for all you know, she could spend hours, days, months thinking about something. our emotions indeed run deep, but we'd never tell someone else that.
XiYLKF8Saa	You have Anime Selects on Demand and most of their shows now coming from Funimation like Black Cat, xxxHolic, School Rumble, Beck, Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle. The Non Funi shows from Anime Selects are GTO & Esclaflowne.<br>  <br>  The Anime Network shows are Wedding Peach, Fumoffu, Azumanga Daioh, & To Heart. IFC on Demand has episodes 23 and 24 of Witchblade.

You can get hit in the head with a 2 x 2 borad dropped from a roof.    That is mere physical pain.

6bhsX2Phaa	It is not Appetite and not close to any of the illusions, however, you should listen to Shackler's Revenge, I.R.S, Prositute, and Madagascar..good album but pray for a reunion!|`|wOc4Dqllaa	Honestly, I'd say their are 0 good songs.

Maybe he really did get called into work.<br>  Unless you have a good reason to think he is seeing someone else, don't be so brash.|`|XnS9mbixaa	you should really trust your guy! if he does this more than once then its probable a lie but other wise its only one time!!!|`|gXypLAyiaa	Yes it sounds like a lie.|`|AA10586181	Depends where he works. I work at a retail store and i have been called in everyday this week and I was only supposed to work Thursday. And if he did make plans with another girl, then make plans with another guy.

lTbZeGiYaa	Hannah montana - Best of both worlds    All the high school musical songs :-)  Also, you could try Miley cyrus, demi lovato, taylor swift etc..    Im sure they'll like things like Umbrella by rihanna, and songs which have been catchy in the year. Some beyonce songs im sure younger girls like.     Girls aloud are good to use (Something kinda oo, Love machine, Jump, sound of the underground, biology)    And i bet young girls like things like justin timberlake ha :)    Britney spears/take that/the saturdays    I hope i helped :-)|`|OmCHOaMNaa	hannah montana crap|`|7kvTHzj0aa	good old kidz bop.|`|I4wuyQGWaa	disney mania|`|srfcI2bVaa	hannah montana, jonas brothers, taylor swift, demi lavato, selena gomez, stuff like that|`|wbytU9szaa	Hannah Montana, JoBros, other Disney/Nickelodeon stars.|`|6HgiNCmqaa	Put songs on from her favorite movies.

Any dirty songs on the list probably have a radio-friendly version or can be skipped.     http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/ch...    They'll probably be very caught up doing 8 year old girl things anyway.|`|Kw8W1ECKaa	Maybe some stuff by some other disney stars  or Aly and AJ  or David Archulleta  or The Jonas Brothers  or Jordin Sparks|`|2DmzL6nWaa	METAL AND ROCK!

These are beautiful, and all kids love it! ;)|`|EECePKs6aa	hannah montanna even though i strongley dislike her and some disney channel songs I guess.|`|1TvclZCaaa	hmm..  teardrops on my guitar by taylor swift  our song by taylor swift  im yours by jason mraz  year 3000 by jonas brothers  as i am by miley cyrus  fly on the wall by miley cryus  tell me something i don't know by selena gomez|`|jgtfWjE4aa	hannah montana  demi lovato  jonas brothers...you know.|`|JHasLcn3aa	Taylor Swift.

New Moon is suppose to come out in November 2009!    - Melina Moo     I love Twilight :D|`|pzY0ARqDaa	Yes, sadly they are.|`|DP7iyG4Laa	Yep!    And thank god they're changing the director! I mean I luv the books but the movies just seriously sucks- Bella and Edward are gasping all the time and some of the moves are just really too fake!!|`|cSceVisnaa	possibility    New Moon is filming in Vancouver Canada soon March  09 ... hell yeah!!!|`|NAM0HveGaa	Eclipse is going to be a movie which will be shot back to back with new moon to save money and come out a year after new moon. I hope they do make Breaking Dawn into a movie b/c if they dont we'll be mad since they cant just make 3 books into a movie they'll make us want more. I think they're just having problems with making Nessie which i think can be done with some special effects on the computer. Also i heard that they are going to change the director for each film like harry potter so we can see the changes i guess|`|dCYFV6qbaa	maybe not breaking dawn because the graphics might be hard to do...you know what i mean if you've read the books.|`|OzfprFaWaa	I hope so.... but at this point... they are only doing one at a time to see what kind of response it gets.

YsT8odtDaa	Madagascar 2<br>  Animal House<br>  Fight Club<br>  Gone with the Wind|`|FplTPoAyaa	I haven't seen many of them, but:<br>  Passion of the Christ - a very moving, spiritually uplifting movie.  Makes you think about your life in a whole other degree.<br>  Animal House - a classic comedy...very funny and at times, raunchy.<br>  Gone With The Wind - be prepared to watch for a few hours.  A long movie, but a classic with lots of romance and drama.|`|tLI94qWNaa	There Will Be Blood was AMAZING, one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  The only other movies in that list I have seen are the love guru and fight club are two amazing movies as well.  The love guru was kind of lame but good for some laughes. Fight club is twisted and awesome.|`|xqrwDmyUaa	I'll do a quick word on the ones I have seen:<br>  Before the Devil Knows You're Dead - Not that great, a good plot but it dragged, but it wasn't a waste of time or anything. If it's free see it.<br>  <br>  Religulous - Saw it last night, very funny and easy to watch. If you are religious at all you likely will not like it as the bias is pretty clear. He thinks all religion is a waste, which although I don't agree with I understand why he is saying what he is. Definitely worth seeing<br>  <br>  Fight Club - amazing film, book is great too. A must see<br>  <br>  Animal House - Classic comedy, see it. Also see Porky's lol<br>  <br>  Gone With The Wind - another must-see, it's a movie that is reference so much in modern culture that you can't not see it.<br>  <br>  As for the rest of the list I heard great things about; Lakeview Terrace, Gone Baby Gone, Diving Bell and the Butterfly, In The Valley of Elah, There WIll Be Blood, Road to Guantanamo and Passion of the Christ.<br>  <br>  I heard Love Guru, Leatherheads and  Golden Compass sucked but I haven't seen them yet.|`|n55igpCUaa	Jumper - It was good, but the plot didn't make much sense.<br>  Religuolous - Loved it! Bill Maher is absolutely right!<br>  Madagascar 2 - A disappointment, just like the first one.<br>  There Will Be Blood - Just saw it last night! It was EPIC!!<br>  Passion of the Christ - Good movie about a fairy tale. Should've been a Disney movie.<br>  Animal House - Funny!!!|`|ndXvMLZ2aa	Madagascar 2 -- It was very funny! Much better than the first one in my opinion!<br>  Secret Life of Bees--It has Dakota Fanning and any movie with her in it is awesome since she's an amzing actress!|`|c661ffb50a295d702392241cf59b4170aa	Jumper - This film got horrible reviews but I found it pretty entertaining. I mean, it's no masterpiece...but I love Rachel Bilson so I endured it.<br>  <br>  Secret Life of Bees - This movie was decent. Dakota Fanning is getting too old for her "maturity" to seem like such good acting but she did a decent job. Love Queen Latifah. Overall a pretty decent film.<br>  <br>  Fight Club - Very different. Worth seeing it once, at least. Brad Pitt is excellent in this.<br>  <br>  Gone with the Wind - A classic, of course. May take a while to get through it if you're not used to watching older, long films but definitely worth watching.<br>  <br>  These are the only ones I've seen on your list.|`|hGY08GjRaa	Sorry, only one of those I've seen is Gone with the Wind.  I think it's dumb. you can't have a good movie with a heroine who isn't even likeable.. <br>  <br>  My friend liked "Gone Baby Gone" <br>  <br>  Secret life of bees kind of looks interesting, because Dakota Fanning is an amazing actress.. and I bet that now that she's older, she's only better..|`|9A2b29znaa	If I were you, I'd watch:<br>  -Fight Club<br>  -Jumper<br>  -Gone Baby Gone<br>  -Secret Life of Bees|`|CXDT5ApTaa	passion of christ is very touching

I guess if it was a sort of tag along and hang out sort of a thing it would probably be the best way to go to do it with my favorite artist Stephen Malkmus. He seems like a pretty nice and funny guy anyways. He could certainly pass on some great records to add to my list and hopefully it would somewhere involve being able to watch/jump in with the Jicks and jam. For the most part, I'd probably like to just tag along while they did stuff as a band for the day.<br>  <br>  *************<br>  Great call Wire.

Ask what she thought of them. Then I'd take her to my sometimes music partner Dawn's house, let her hear all our songs see what she thought of those. At some point get her to play her songs and let me accompany on Harmonica Ask her to take us to meet David Rawlings and jam with him as well. At some point Steer the conversation towards the Blue Sky Boys Just Talk Jam & Drink. I'd probably make a pass her at some point also. Put I'd definitely go music first with her.|`|WOMjtldKaa	Axl Rose!! That would be the best day of my life!

Got in a fight with a girl over a guy I didn't like... (she wouldn't leave me alone about it, this was when we were very young)     Got sent home for wearing short-shorts that were not "short" at all. (teachers) Girls walked by with their butts hanging out and they jumped on my case because I was taller.    Umm... Principal gave me a unconventional "sex talk" which I reported... Of course, only mom believed me.    One teach gave me an 'F' when I was in his class for a week...    Umm....Got kicked out of the school yearbook one year because the staff refused to place my picture in there... they ended up cutting me a small check for it when I threatened to sue for discrimination.    Yeah, I had a hell of a lot of trouble in school.    I yelled at a high school principal, and reported her... because she called my mom a liar in front of me (I feel I was defending my mom on that one) That principal was a total discriminating and prejudice woman who didn't like me because I wore dark colors to school and didn't 'smile on command'.    Yeah, school really, really, REALLY sucks!! ;)|`|vqSkOICGaa	I wrote 'suck my d***' on a piece of my math paper and tore it off and passed it around the class and it got to this one girl (TATTLE!) and she told on me of course and I got in a lot of trouble even though I honestly didn't know it was a bad saying, I was like 7. after that I was real careful not to get caught lol

0TGpz08paa	I absolutely do not like him anymore. I live in Montreal and our Radio station here, Virgin Radio Mix 96, they actually stopped playing all of his songs because they are so outraged and do not want to promote his music when he brutally beat Rihanna up. I have no respect for him. Violence against anyone is unacceptable especially against women|`|2FNfyxVqaa	I was never gaga over him and what he did was unacceptable...but I won't lie, if he makes good music I would still listen to it.|`|1wNsBNmxaa	i do not like him any more he lost my respect in now all he is...is a woman beater i don't care how many times chris brown try to tell rihanna i am sorry that i hit you it only takes one time in then he will hit her again  <br>  <br>  seriously the 2 that said he is innocent in till proven guilty you need you heads checked out he told the cops that he hit in slapped her how innocent is that its not<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  смерть???|`|F1DviZEvaa	As a Fan of both.<br>  <br>  Yes i do.<br>  <br>  Chris's story of the 'fight' is strong.<br>  &<br>  So is Rihanna's <br>  <br>  I NEVER liked Chris Brown as a Person as whole, But i do like him as a Singer, and Dancer.<br>  <br>  Everyone deserves a 2nd chance.<br>  <br>  Other my not like him for what he did its really a matter of opinion EG.<br>  <br>  If you like Rihanna more over than Chris, You would DISLIKE Chris for what he did.<br>  <br>  If You like Chris More over than Rihanna, you would DISLIKE Rihanna for What she says he did, or for not forgiving him etc.|`|c573f7ac6e5d1bec7e5fc59b2cf6d1adaa	My perception has change about Chris Brown but it's all his own doing. Now he has joined the same club as Bobby, Rick James, James Brown and Ike Turner. His music will still probably be good but he won't be innocent to me anymore. No more singing along with Elmo for Chris Brown.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	didn't like him b4, certainly hate him now|`|l4N0FJ3Yaa	I still LOVE Chris Brown, he's innocent until proven guilty and all that jazz. He made a huge mistake but its not like he planned on doing it, well thats just my take on it. Everybody has a bad day, even the celebrites and thats really why we even know about this situation. Had Chris and Rihanna just been regular people like you and me, the world would have never known about any of this. I just hope he grows from this and moves forward in a positive direction. I do think its unfair that within hours of this taking place, his ads were suspended, however Rihanna's were not. We don't know what really happened and what if she commited a crime before or during this timeframe? I wish the world would just give him another chance but I know thats going to take a very long time.|`|xjv2iaYQaa	I feel like we don't really no what rihanna iz like in person.the same goes for chris brown.I'm still a fa of chris but not a big fan of rihanna.and this thinghas not really changed my opinion except i think they get alittle more attention that usual.so i hope nothing happens to chris and i hope chris or rihanna|`|3928ccf010c3c956e363056a7e98cce0aa	How can you know if you like someone without having met them in person? <br>  His music is not all that he is.<br>  <br>  Now, he did apparently do something very bad, but why do people care ..... why should that go all around America and not the story that a single working mom was on time to her kids soccer practice after 2 jobs?|`|WsUSAgLmaa	I do...nobody is perfect. He did what he did, its done now. Theres nothing anyone can do to change that. He is a young boy 19 and he has plenty more mistakes to make in life.

AA11879371	OK, you are at school on the internet, so I suggest you check out Wikipedia.  I am not a fan of Wiki, but I was raised in northeastern Nebraska and I've had a few dealings with snow. So . . .  check out this URL   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow</a>   . My brothers, sister and I all went to country school, we walked in the snow to get there.  We did not always like "snow days" because that meant that we had to scoop our way to the barn to get the tractor to clear the lane and farm place.  Then Dad would clear the road to the neighbors farm.  All the other farmers in the area would do the same thing.  We'd be in country school the next day.<br>  <br>  But go ahead and check out  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow</a>  it's got good information about snow.   Even the record breaking snowfall in Bellingham Washington.  Mount Baker received 2896 cm (1,140 inches) of snow.  That's over 11 feet of snow!|`|310i8CKZaa	I don't mind the snow, I just hate the cold.|`|S1A20Oouaa	I love the snow|`|AA10265178	Where I live, snow is unavoidable for a few months, but I don't mind.

If you talk right away make sure you ask if he has an e-mail address & telll him you would like to write it down so you can make sure you don't get out of touch for such a long time. If you really are looking for a connection such as getting together you better figure out what you will say in advance.

Ow3O7h4caa	Actually, if his Moon is in Sagittarius, then Moon in Aquarius will not do much BUT. Having said this, if the Moon enters his Sun sign and conjuncts his Sin, then the person will be more moody and apt to change in his way of thinking for the days that Moon is conjunct his Sun.  You cannot promise what isn't indicated in a birth chart. The Moon will affect that person if it conjuncts, squares or opposes his Moon or Sun.But the effects will depend on how importabnt the Moon is in the person's chart and if she repeats natal aspects in her transits inthe different signs and houses.|`|k9gp11PMaa	Nope, only when the moon goes into the Aquarius.

cidwIuJRaa	No,but you are only a little mixed-up.    1st off,Chibi-Usa is a nickname for the daughter of Usagi/Serena,as they really are both named Usagi.The word chibi means small,and the Usa is short for Usagi.    Rini is just a dub name for Chibi-Usa,and short for Serena.    Again with the Chibi,it is also added to her Moon status as well,since Tsukino Usagi (the blonde) is already Moon,so Chibi-Usa is Chibi-Moon.    And,since chibi is a Japanese word,America replaces it with mini,which is short for minature,still meaning small,and calls her Mini-Moon.    Small Lady Selenity is Chibi-Usa's future self,who is the future daughter of Usagi's future self,Princess Selenity.Small Lady is the future princess.    Black Lady is Chibi-Usa's evil form in BSSM R,where she was being controlled by Wiseman,and had been turned against Moon (her mother) and the other senshi.But,in this form,she is even more obvious about her love for Tuxedo Kamen (Tuxedo Mask AKA her father).    While Black Lady is a great villian,she really doesn't last long,and Chibi-Usa is soon back to her annoying self as usual.    Since you didn't mention it,the dubbed name of Black Lady is Wicked Lady.    ***************************    Now that I have that explanation complete,let me explain the other character you asked about,and hope you understand.    Chibi-Chibi AKA Sailor Chibi-Chibi-Moon is not related to Chibi-Usa AKA Sailor Chibi-Moon in ANY way at all.    Nor is Chibi-Chibi Usagi's 3rd daughter.Usagi does have a second daughter after Chibi-Usa,who is named Kousagi,who only appears in a short story in the Materials Collection,which is called Perureru/Parallel Sailor Moon.She is there,and never shows up in the anime.She is NOT Chibi-Chibi.    Chibi-Chibi is Galaxia's starseed from SailorStars.That is all she really is.Later on,she becomes Sailor Cosmos.Sailor Cosmos is NOT Usagi/Moon...or,at least NOT the one you know and love.    So,Cosmos is sent to warn the present Sailor Moon [which is her past self] of the impending doom she could face if she does NOT change things.Only,Cosmos comes in the form of Chibi-Chibi at first.[Yes,it is a bit confusing,but makes perfect sense!].    Cosmos [in her Cosmos form] is the future Sailor Moon from a generation much later than now,and she is warning the Sailor Moon of our generation to stop the impending doom.Which,our Sailor Moon obviously does!  **************************************...    Hope that clears everything up!|`|2ogFk4Amaa	I dont think that they are the same person.|`|H2cMlG9Kaa	ChibiChibi and Rini are the same person----- Mini moon's daughter  Sailor Mini Moon and Chibiusa are the same person, and Small Lady is her in sailor princess mode, Black Lady is her in evil form.|`|VpGfonpqaa	Chibi Chibi is Sailor Chibimoon. She first comes in the last part of Sailor moon, Sailor moon stars, she's a star seed from the future.    ChibiUsa is Rini, Sailor Mini Moon, Small Lady and Black Lady. Just different names, Rini is ChibiUsa name in the dub version, she becomes Sailor Mini Moon, small lady is what she is called in the future by the sailor scouts, and Black lady is what she became when she turned evil in Sailor Moon R.

C7YbYUYPaa	Epiphone uses lower quality on their Les Paul edition.  Really, the only thing that is the same is the body style.    Gibsons are all made in America I believe, and they are much better quality.  They use quality wood, spend great detail on on the finish of the guitar, and they use much, much better pickups and wiring.    I have heard Epiphones are a great guitar if you can't afford the Gibson.  They use cheaper parts, but it is still a fairly well looking guitar, and the sound isn't bad, just not Gibson quality.  A lot of people pay less for the Epiphone, then spend money on better pickups and parts, and make it pretty much a Gibson.    If you are pretty good at guitar, and you want a killer sound, buy the Gibson.  If this is your first or second guitar, buy the Epiphone.  Gibsons are for serious players, and people who really want that great sound.|`|LdGFnGADaa	I've looked this up before, and the only difference that I know of is that Gibson uses "better" quality woods than Epiphone does. That's the only difference that I know of. That, and Gibsons come with better pick-ups than the Epiphone model does.|`|LuK19ZFPaa	epiphone is a lower quality knock off  everyone has one too   every loser wants a les paul, why dont you get something that EVERYONE doesnt have  thats why i got 30,000 ibanez bitches

Do siamese twins pay for one ticket or two tickets when they go to movies and concerts?  - They pay for two tickets because two heads are watching the program.    Do prison buses have emergency exits?  - They do have emergency exits. They just take care of the prisoners while getting down urgently.|`|e3519ba9ced58a41233cf76d1478554aaa	I might be able to answer a couple    1. it will be born at 11:59 becuase thats when he first pops out    2.You leave them alone    3.There isnt another animal like a rabbit since there so joyful    4.I guess they pay for two since they are diffrent people even though there combined    5.I guess since other busses do|`|AA10980747	1. 12:00 ( when in doubt, find the mean)  2.

kAzlWBp8aa	Well, unlike DBZ where the subs sound like dying squirrels, the subbed voices in Bleach are similar to the dubs so there arn't too many noticible differances. There are a few though:    -Ichigo's inner hollow sounds less chaotic and sounds more mature in the sub    -Toshiro Hitsugaya voice sounds a lot more anylitical and overall more indicaive of his personality in the sub    -All of the bounts voices are terribly done in the dub and makes them too stiff in my opinion        Eventually, if you're an avid Bleach fan, you'll have to resort to the subs. Since you're in the bount arc, lemme tell ya, you have a ways to go before the conclusion. Also, while in America, Bleach has only reached 93 episodes, Japan is in the 200's and the manga is on its 343 chapter.|`|fDan2wj5aa	Subbed, the voices are as intended and they cut out some important dialogue to make it look right in english. You ever notice how they stall and say some stupid things, its the english script|`|mtuZ3i7haa	Either :D|`|mxZUt1iMaa	I don't mind either. I watch the subbed personally because it's farther along. I originally started watching the dub on Adult Swim and I think it's pretty good :D|`|szJSaZspaa	subbed sounds better...way better|`|Okb2aQngaa	I think subbed is better, except for Nel Tu's voice i can't stand how young she sounds but they don't even have a voice actor for her in english yet so i would like to see that.  [:  But...  I really like the subbed voices better than the dubbed.  Ichigo's is alright i guess, it bothers me that him and Lelouch [from code geass] have the same v/a for the shows.|`|eikaGu3daa	subbed. i havent heard much of the dubbed version of bleach, but hitsugaya's voice sounds alot better subbed if you ask me. especially when he yells matsumoto rather than saying rangiku.|`|c9nICPlDaa	Subbed is better

I actually just saw him in concert on Friday and got the chance to chat with him a bit. He said that it most likely won't be on iTunes because they don't own the rights, but they're considering putting it on his website or myspace. I think if enough people write him, they'll probably do it.    (P.S. If you EVER get a chance to see him live, I would highly recommend it. It was fantastic.)

ZyGyDLsDaa	I love SFC movies! For one thing, I'm a Baby Boomer who grew up with low-budget movies at the drive-in and sometimes in the theater, so I'm partial to them more than the usual blockbusters, most of which I've found are not worth the fuss.     Today's attacked SFC Originals are likely to be cult movies in less than a decade. Today, I watched "Wyvern" and "Ice Spiders", which entertained me, made me giggle, provided some quotations for my film journal, and allowed me to see actors usually relegated to bit roles in lead ones. In "Wyvern", Nick Chinlund made a very good hero! Also, they had Elaine Miles from "Northern Exposure"!     I enjoy movies such as "Aztec Rex" because they harken back to Bert I. Gordon, William Castle, Ed Wood and, last but certainly not least, Roger Corman. I think people have forgotten to appreciate these low-budget movies and simply open fire on them as if they were trying to be something they aren't. But, they don't pretend to be epic films! They obviously aren't intended to storm the box office! They're to entertain us! They're SF/fantasy/horror desserts.    Attack the pretentious films from independents who pretend to be important and different from the rest. They're so self-conscious about how "indie" they are.    Again, SFC movies aren't pretenders. If these were released in the past, they would have been double-billed at the drive-in. Frankly, Quentin Tarantino's attempt at grindhouse films fails. SFC Originals are more like it!     I'm looking forward to seeing "The Immortal Voyage of Captain Drake" again later this week. I watched "Wraiths of Roanoke" in the wee hours of this morning, followed by "It Waits". Then, I watched "WOR" again! I also like "Primal Force", "Terminal Invasion" and many others. Now, Chiller is airing some SFC Originals, which gives me more opportunities to catch favorites or ones I somehow missed. For every "Rock Monster" (which I admit was extremely poor), there is one that keeps me tuning in, like the aforementioned "Aztec Rex".|`|AA11314600	Well, IMO all movies are getting worse, not just the Sci-Fi channel's.  So many people go to movies these days that even the really bad ones turn a profit.  You see it all the time.  Some movie has a big opening weekend, but once word gets out about it, it tanks and then people line up for the next new crappy movie.
fALkYOC1aa	Into the Wild--- one of my favorite movies ever--- isn't really all that bad.  It had some nudity in it.  It was a woman's breasts. It also had a little bit of language, the F word, which isn't allowed in PG13 movies.  I would recommend this movie if you haven't seen it.|`|mxq7EEskaa	WELL INTO THE WILD IS RATED R BECAUSE OF NUDITY THEY HAD NAKED PEOPLE IN IT...THE REST I HAVENT SEEN THEM.|`|H4s6uoDBaa	well into the wild had some man parts in it and they cant show that in pg13|`|ul79DG2kaa	Into The Wild has more than just some naked boobs in it Savygirl.  there is a scene where the main character (male) is floating naked on his back down a river.|`|PAv7xQjSaa	Title:      Into The Wild (2007)  Rating:   R  Rating Reason:   Rated R for language and some nudity.     Title:      Adventureland (2008)  Rating:   R  Rating Reason:   Rated R for language, drug use and sexual references.     The Yellow Handkerchief is Unrated. You can only find rated movies in the MPAA database, but I am assuming that is is unrated because it's an independent film. I have no idea what it's about either.    An R-rated motion picture, in the view of the Rating Board, contains some adult material. An R-rated motion picture may include adult themes, adult activity, hard language, intense or persistent violence, sexually-oriented nudity, drug abuse or other elements, so that parents are counseled to take this rating very seriously. Children under 17 are not allowed to attend R-rated motion pictures unaccompanied by a parent or adult guardian. Parents are strongly urged to find out more about R-rated motion pictures in determining their suitability for their children. Generally, it is not appropriate for parents to bring their young children with them to R-rated motion pictures.
mxZUt1iMaa	Well the manga is rated OT (16+) so I would say no. It's semi-graphic in some of the fight scenes.  And yes there is a bit of homosexual activity. Nothing extreme (kissing at most) There are several homosexual pairings throughout the series as well. The main pairing also has a 9 year age difference. (12 and 21, if I remember correctly.)|`|JKQGy2aZaa	i can't really say anything i watched some really dirty staff back when i was 10 and i watched south park when i was 7 or 8 but im a dirty kid   i guess and for the person above watching this wont make her smoke pot and cut herself.    plus she's 10 and in like grade 5 or 6 so it doesnt matter if there gay and theres no sex or anything like that or i dont think there is    its ok for a 10 year old yeah|`|o4tblEZaaa	Yeah, the two heros are gay. My emo frenemy reads them. She smokes pot and cuts herself. So, I would warn against buying a ten year old that. You should look in to Fruits Basket instead.|`|Okb2aQngaa	They are homosexual.  Personally, i wouldn't get loveless for a ten year old.|`|P7v7Fbt7aa	the story is a little homosexual rated like for above 16 so I do not think that it is a suitable choice for your sister|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	NOOOOOOOOO!!! the anime is rated 16+!!!    certainly not!!! there is violence, homocide, homosexual relationships, and references to rape and loss of virginity. Not to mention that the supporting character is 22 and lusts after the 12 year old main character.    Yes the anime is "yaoi" meaning sexual love between two boys and there is also "yuri" love between two girls.     Also there is no english dub and most 10 years old may not like reading subtitles to the original Japanese.

7HBTvg8Caa	Yes, he did die. See, he was in the car when it burst into flames, but he rolled down the window and climbed out of it still on fire and badly burnt. The crew then ran over to him and sprayed him with fire extinguishers. He was in the middle of an allergic reaction to the white foam when a bunch of angry girls he had dated and dumped in the past came screaming up to him and beating him with bats. He got up to run across the street to the nearest hospital where he was hit by a drunk Lindsay Lohan. She slammed on her brakes flinging Cris a 100 yards where his hair got caught on a jaggy edge and ripped his head from his body scaring the little children playing basketball at the school for the underprivileged. They buried him in his family's private plot.|`|PdSeeHdkaa	NO, he did not die  !   that episode was taken awhile ago.. hes still alive|`|cc5142435abdee55a9e3230edbb9c2e4aa	He's alive but his ego got too big for his tv viewing audience.

RPWDFFzyaa	Sounds like you're looking for...  Always The Love Song by Eli Young Band|`|qXDUpEBbaa	...
T3NBIDUEaa	Yes, there are two different versions. The original R, and the PG13 that we got in theaters in America. I've seen the original, and have seen the version the theater i manage has just received.  They remove a lot of the people getting shot, you just see them dead on the ground. He electrocutes the chair, instead of stabbing him with nails and zapping those. In the kitchen they don't show him slice the guys arm/stab him in the heart. In the end scene with Saint Claire he fires one final round, where in the original he unloads the clip before dropping the gun.    Def. a watered down version out in American Theaters.|`|LMFOUJZhaa	sometimes in movies they take out scenes  maybe the movie was getting to long and they cut some scenes out  when the movie comes out it will probable be in the bonus features under deleted scenes  i hate it when they do that, i think of it as false advertising  i want to see that movie and i also was looking forward to seeing that part  thats to bad|`|weBvwrloaa	yes, he did.... you must have blinked. That's  what the wiring from the light switch was attached too- he had the wires wrapped around the nine inch nails he stabbed him with right above his knees...|`|pYSe5uP0aa	It was in the movie I watched, he stabbed his thighs with huge nails and attached alligator clips to the houses mains supply, it was shocking man.|`|AA11485286	I also SAW not SEEN (sorry, but using the wrong tense for saw drives me!) Taken today! Anyway, I must have missed that preview scene.  All I remember with a guy in the chair was the one hooked-up to the light switch.  Wasn't it an excellent movie???  Maybe with all the eyewitness accounts, different versions were shown in different parts of the country!!!|`|se6I1xFhaa	I heard that scene and other scenes were cut from the movie.    From what I heard, the film, which was made almost a year ago overseas, had a rating equivalent to a very strong "R". I guess 20th Century Fox who distributed the film wanted a PG-13 rating to attract more people to see the movie.     But I suspect there will be an unrated version of the film once it gets on video.|`|5af8PNwxaa	It was in the movie in Australia last year, don't know what version you had wherever you live.    Sometimes, it depends on how the movie is cut as the cinemas show scenes in the previews which don't always appear when the movie comes out.    Just wait for DVD to come out and rent, they always have extended versions, etc.|`|7d8a232729948aa43d4cfa13bdc6648faa	it was in the movie|`|Pfog69hNaa	I have seen the movie taken and Bryan Mills did not stab Marko with nails or knives or anything else.

Also checking out snopes.com - they said the rumor was false.|`|52FMZOTAaa	"In 2006, in response to growing concerns about record levels of childhood obesity in the U.S.A., Sesame Street began airing segments entitled Healthy Habits for Life. In these segments, the Muppet characters of Sesame Street talk about healthy habits, such as eating properly and exercising. The Healthy Habits for Life segments spawned false Internet rumors that Cookie Monster's name had been changed to Veggie Monster or would be taken off the show entirely."    So he is still the cookie monster, just a little healthier.|`|BPnbK8wgaa	i don't think so

Nor can I ever own what's mine  When you're always taking sides  But you won't take away my pride.  No, not this time.  Not this time.    How did we get here?  Well, I used to know you so well.  But how did we get here?  Well, I think I know.    The truth is hiding in your eyes  And it's hanging on your tongue.  Just boiling in my blood.  But you think that I can't see  What kind of man that you are,  If you're a man at all.  Well, I will figure this one out  On my own.  (I'm screaming, "I love you so.")  On my own.  (My thoughts you can't decode)    How did we get here?  Well, I used to know you so well, yeah.  But how did we get here?  Well, I think I know.    Do you see what we've done?  We've gone and made such fools   Of ourselves.  Do you see what we've done?  We've gone and made such fools  Of ourselves.    Yeah.Yeah.    How did we get here?  Well, I used to know you so well, yeah, yeah.  How did we get here?  Well, I used to know you so well.  I think I know.  I think I know.    There is something I see in you.  It might kill me.

akcGfgdcaa	In terms of acting, you need to find yourself an agent. Join local theatre and invite agents to watch you, once you get an agent, it will be so much easier for you to get auditions through them and go up for TV/Film work.    Make sure that if an agent wants you on their books that they are respectable, have a decent client list (hopefully with actors who are already doing well) and that they only take money when you get work, and that they don't ask you for any money upfront etc.    Good luck.

Vz6zuFXQaa	Great Song did you write it cus it is amazing better than i can do.|`|e2J4r10Raa	I'm gonna be brutally honest with you. It stinks. Its amateur at best. It could be good just put more work into it. It just seems pretty generic and like any other song about relationships. well good luck with your song writing.
KBBonf97aa	There's no better instrument than bass if you like funk!  And just because you want to play bass now doesn't mean you can't change your mind and try a different instrument in the future.  Just follow your instincts, since they'll probably lead you to the right instrument for you.    Since you're just getting started, make sure you choose a bass with a thin neck.  The thinner the neck, the easier it is to fret the strings.  And the easier it is to fret the strings, the faster you'll learn and gain confidence in your playing.  Ibanez makes some fantastic basses and I've noticed a lot of funk players seem to prefer them over other brands.  Whereas a lot of basses sound kind of dull and booming, Ibanez's tend to be bright and punchy, which is especially helpful when you're learning to slap strings.    Another great thing about playing bass is that you'll never have any trouble starting or finding a band.  The world is filthy with guitarists, but there are very few decent bassists and they're always in demand.  Also, it's pretty easy once you've learned the basics to move gracefully between musical styles.  Whereas guitarists tend to specialize in metal, alternative, jazz, etc., bassists can generally sit in with any type of group.      If you start out with even a low-end bass by a respected manufacturer (I'd check out musiciansfriend.com), you'll have no troule selling it if you decide it's not the instrument for you.  But you'll be better off starting on bass than guitar, since once you've learned bass, you're always qualified to be a bassist.  The same can't be said for guitarists who switch to bass, since they tend to overplay and never quite understand that bass is a rhythm instrument.  Good luck to you!

If you ask God to forgive you he will. That's the reason he came and suffered on the cross for our mistakes. When he forgives he forgets, but humans don't. <br>  <br>  I get down on my knees and ask the Lord to forgive me,  the wretched sinner that I am. God knows my heart and if I'm truly sorry he will forgive. I learn from my mistakes, so that I do not repeat them again. <br>  <br>  I will rectify all my sins.|`|b8e8a6de149259fd7a51d672221ab4e4aa	Lucky for me God does give me the chance to rectify my mistakes; I also try to learn from them.

os5CCyA3aa	Just from personal experience, They do, but they wont ever tell. They keep it to themselves and act as if they never cared. I had a really good Aquarius guy friend, who at one point i was involved with. He got drunk and spilled a lot of secrets to me|`|oGCcPQ1Xaa	heyy ...<br>  <br>  i've dated two aquarus guys before i settled down and to be honest they werent all that jelous it seems to be more aquarius girls that get jelous i have found that its sagitarius guys that tend to get jelous i dated 2 sagitarius guys and am with one now and they both get jelous quickly and very very very easily, <br>  <br>  if i were you go for a scorpio or a piscies theyre the best :D <br>  <br>  charlea <br>  xx|`|z4D4rKEtaa	ok i am so biased on this one<br>  HECKIE YEAH!<br>  Disenchanted they can be but once something prevails they are extremely jealous. It seems that because they are meticulous about their possessions it trickles into relationships too. Ugh. Sorry Water Bearers...this has been MY experience.|`|g8QMrSzwaa	they do...|`|07cdc5710ed692974b09c64c65058e4aaa	Yes...  From my experience, it is all about them - so the jealousy isn't about another guy finds you attractive. It's about you not paying attention to your Aquarian BF - it will be YOUR fault... <br>  <br>  look up sun signs by linda goodman...  you will get your answers!|`|AA11899483	yes depends on their chart though, some do some dont, my cousin is an aquarius with moon in scorpio, venus in picses and scorpio rising, jealous is his middle name. very overprotective and possessive.|`|4VNFsmanaa	Haha, my brother-in-law is an Aquarius and he gets very protective and defensive for my sister (a Cancer). Her boss kept hitting on her, and treating her weird, like sexual harassment stuff. And one night there was a company dinner thing and her boss hit on her right then and there in front of my brother-in-law, he was pissed, lol.|`|oDdXpghDaa	OMG, yes...  I dated an Aquarius for 5 years - he got jealous about EVERYTHING...  I'd try to tell him to relax, and then he'd get angry about that.  Then he'd freak out that I was smothering him and didn't have enough friends...  Arugh...|`|AXE1ukupaa	I'm glad you asked this question, and I'm glad there are so many answers. I always too it on good faith that Aquarians weren't ever jealous, I'm releived that they can feel this way! The Aquarians I know treat situations like that impersonally.|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Yes Aquarius men do get jealous.

EOsUmJw4aa	There is a box office number that connects to all of the main venues for concert tickets, your best bet is to ring them and find out sorry i don't know the number though. And i also got a feeling that you may be too late and they might have sold out, but just try anyway. i always do for my Ronan Keating tickets.

I'll stick to Sci-Fi, History, History International, Discovery Science, National Geographic, and a periodic check of Comedy Central for some new stand up.    American Media is so bad that I go online and download BBC Documentaries and Comedy...    I do my best to avoid American Media in all forms because it has just become stupid, cookie cutter, nonsense...    I don't have a problem with violence or sex because I want REALISM.    Gratuitous sex and violence turns me off but reality? That is why I stick to Doc's...

5af8PNwxaa	Firstly...please remember as glamourous as it may seem.    Entourage is only fantasy...a TV show and not real, please don't place your decision on this show as it is not the real world and writers write the script to get the viewers hooked on the show.     Otherwise, you will find yourself extremely disappointed.    Don't know if you have such a thing in America in school as work experience.    If so, I would be writing to all the movie studios to see if you can get a contact and maybe a part time job if the office...that way you will get some idea if it is something you really want (even if you think you do now).     I have found some internet links which may help.    http://www.caryn.com/acting/resources/ag...    http://www.at-la.com/@la-film/talent.htm...    http://www.mandy.com/1/services.cfm?t=us...    http://www.hollywoodaccess.com/agents.ht...    Just remember, don't be disappointed with rejection...just keep in there and keep trying.    Don't give up and good luck.|`|XOlnc8iBaa	First study Public Relations and the music industry, as well as business. Then start clubbing in the exclusive clubs everywhere in Hollywood, every weekend for about 10 years to make contacts, get your name well known and allow others to grow confidence in you.

rC22WjXHaa	Stay    It was soooooo good and it's confusing and you just wanna watch it again and again!!!!    Like this guy gets in a car crash and then while he's dying he starts having I guess sort of a "dream" that he wants to commit suicide.  So he's seeing this psychologist and all these freaky things happen.  The psychologist tries to stop him from killing himself cause he said that he's doing it on midnight on his 21rst birthday on the Golden Gate Bridge (I think).  Then he "shoots himself" and the scene goes back to the car crash!  You forget throughout the whole movie that he even gets into a crash!      Everytime you watch it you get something different from it and it begins to have more sense.  I cried so hard when he died.  I thought about it like forever....    It's so awesome.  Watch it =]|`|j04LK4W6aa	Alpha Dog...     Not so much the movie, but the story and how all these people contributed to a young boys death, for no reason what so ever...

IKeMg1qaaa	The Story So Far... Gary Moore Biography<br>  Gary Moore is acknowledged as one of the finest musicians that the British Isles has ever produced. In a career that dates back to the 1960s, there are few musical genres that he has not turned his adroit musical hand to, and has graced the line-ups ever several notable rock bands, Thin Lizzy, Colosseum II and Skid Row to name but three. <br>  <br>  Gary was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on April 4th 1952. Like many others, he was turned on to rock and roll first through hearing Elvis Presley, and then via The Beatles. Seeing the likes of Jimi Hendrix and John Mayall's Bluesbreakers in his hometown in the mid-60s opened up to him the rich world of The Blues. Hearing the art of the Blues guitar performed by such lauded exponents as Peter Green fired Moore's nascent talent, and it wasn't long before he was being hailed as a teen musical prodigy. Indeed, it was Green himself who helped foster Moore's career, a debt that was repaid handsomely when Gary cut his warm and heartfelt tribute to his mentor, the 'Blues For Greeny' album, released in 1995. <br>  Gary's first band of note, the power trio Skid Row, secured a record deal with the CBS label in 1970. By this time, Gary had moved to Dublin, and befriended Phil Lynott, who filled the vocal role with Skid Row until shortly before the CBS deal was signed. Gary cut three albums with the band, and toured the USA supporting The Allman Brothers Band, and Mountain amongst others, before he split Skid Row to embark on a solo career. This proved short-lived, as Gary was soon to reunite with Phil Lynott as replacement for Eric Bell in the Thin Lizzy line-up. Although he was in the band for a relatively brief tenure, he would rejoin their ranks following the departure of Brian Robertson in 1977, and again, finally, for the 'Black Rose' tour in 1978. <br>  <br>  In 1979, Gary's solo career began in earnest with the evocative hit single, 'Parisienne Walkways', which pitched Gary's tasteful, blues-soaked lead guitar with a moody Phil Lynott guest vocal. The single reached the UK Top Ten in April of that year, and the subsequent album, 'Back On The Streets' was similarly well received. The late 1970s and early 80s were characterised by Gary's restless search for the best musical settings for his talents; a reunion with Phil Lynott produced the powerful 'Out In The Fields' hit single (1985). He explored his Celtic roots on the album 'Wild Frontier' (1987), but it was with the 1990 album, 'Still Got The Blues', that Gary arrived at a rich musical vein within which his creativity could flow freely. This and its successor, 'After Hours' saw cameo appearances from the likes of such Blues guitar greats as Albert King, BB King, and Albert Collins, and it is a testament to Gary's own remarkable talents that he more than held his own amongst such august company. In 1994, Gary worked alongside Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce in the band BBM, cutting one accomplished album, before resuming his solo career. <br>  <br>  The, 'Back To The Blues' (2001) album saw this consummately talented musician revisit The Blues with renewed vigor and determination, after the more experimental 'Dark Days In Paradise' (1997) and 'A Different Beat' (1999) albums. A ten-track collection that mixes excellent Moore originals with gritty and intense covers of standards. But, in the tradition of keeping his fans and critics guessing, 2002 saw Gary Moore crashing back onto the music scene with what has to be his heaviest collection of songs since the late 1980's, once again forcing people to reassess any opinions and preconceptions they may have of him. That time round though, Moore had decided to share the limelight, joining forces with ex-Skunk Anansie bassist Cass Lewis and Primal Scream drummer Darrin Mooney to form 'Scars', a true power trio in every respect. The 'Scars' album was completed in early 2002 and that line-up, then went on to record the 'Live at the Monsters of Rock' (2003) live CD and DVD, which featured the band's set as performed on two separate nights on the UK Tour in May 2003. That live set encompassed a diverse range of material, from across Gary's playing career. <br>  <br>  2004, saw possibly the rawest album yet from Gary Moore, 'Power of the Blues'. The 10-track set, recorded mostly live in the studio, ranged from the hard rock/blues of the title track, via the upbeat swing of "Can't find my baby", to the haunting "Torn Inside". <br>  <br>  Taking time out in August 2005, for a brief reunion with some of his old Thin Lizzy pals, for a one off concert in Dublin. The evening was filmed for a 2006 DVD release. 'Gary Moore and Friends, One Night in Dublin, A Tribute to Phil Lynott' (Eagle Vision EREDV559). Gary's last studio album 'Old New Ballads Blues' (Eagle Records, EAGCD314) 2006, features featured a blend of stunning originals mixed with some inspiring blues covers. <br>  <br>  With his latest studio album 'Close As You Get', Gary continues in a direction not too dissimilar from Old, New,

7jp7sTdFaa	One with just the bass and snare is gonna be hard to find. I'd suggest working on your hi-hat timing and when to use crash cymbals, and THEN doing covers. Almost all songs by AC/DC, some Tears for Fears songs like Head over Heels and Everybody Wants to Rule the World, Friday I'm in Love by the Cure, some Pink Floyd stuff, and even some Beatles would be easy for your cause. NO NO NO, don't use tabs, just learn it by ear. Pick a favorite song, listen to the drum part, and try to work it out behind your kit.|`|6EaFBoe4aa	a good song on drums is  MGMT - Kids    Its very simple  Sort of like a basic rock beat    Snare, Hi hat and bass  :)    Ive been drumming for 4 years now and ive just learned double bass but i managed to teach this song to a 10 year old in like 10 minutes  :)    love  x|`|KkZE2NDYaa	Its hard to get more basic than a rock beat like "Hang on Sloopy" It's 4/4 time(4 beats to the measure-quarter note gets one beat). Count one, two. three and four. put the bass drum on 1, snare on 2, bass on 3and(two eighth notes) then snare on 4. Now you are rockin'|`|AA12025213	Don't look for easy things, challenge yourself! Play the drums by ear. If you want some simplistic songs look for any punk music. Try the Stray Cats. Slim Jim Phantom mostly uses only a cymbal, a snare, and maybe a tom. Challenge yourself to play the stuff that makes you feel crazy!

cbNayu01aa	Try writing songs on Saturday from 9am to 12pm. This is commonly known as "songwriting prime-time" - when your creativity is at its peak. Don't miss out by sleeping in!     Look around and see if anything inspires you.  Put your mind at work on this one and think about what is happening in your life.  Is there something that you would like to change or have you had an experience of some sort that you want everyone to be aware of?  If thats the case: WRITE!  If there's something about a special someone that you adore write about that too.  Or if there's aonther Songwriter who inspires you then listen to their songs and see what you like about that song.  But don't make it excactly like that song.  Once your finished there's going to be no one stopping you.  Get out and right some more.  It might take 20 songs before there's your BIG number one hit.    Goodluck in the future hun!!!  P.S Your such an excellent singer!!|`|BMAIFZX5aa	"Listen to your heart" (Ha, that was Lame I know.... that's the name of a song by... cascade, I think ) Just go with real life experiences that you liked, or hated... :(|`|iEI0lgmBaa	give it time, focus on other things, keep on the look out but only  in the back of your head.|`|0ffrtlafaa	did u sing all those songs???gosh there soo amazing!!!! ure really talented...u can write of bout life ont he whole...let ure song reflect ure personality and ure life and what ure going thru|`|roFGlldOaa	I write songs about boys mostly... but you could write about friend/friendship/friendship problems or family/family problems.

I like her talent, and I like how much effort she puts into everything.    I love Demi, too. She's such a Sweetheart, and I like how she can be so different and still be with Disney.

Maybe someone watches it on actual TV (I have only watched them online because until the digital switchover I was unable to get the channel) and has seen a commercial saying when Grey's will be back? <br>  <br>  And they just WOULD have to do that fight before taking a break, wouldn't they?|`|dMBSE8ilaa	March 12th|`|zijJOEXqaa	depend on your cable p

And if you wish to dance too... Bhangra, Rajasthani folk and Gujarat Folk (Dandiya) would be ideal - these three have rythm and vigour and are basically percusion (drums) based music. You will have to have a basic idea, to source the music from and hear it for yourself, before making a final decision. I would suggest.. copy all the tracks and then make a MPG3 CD..so that you do not have to keeop shuffling the CDs or tapes at he party. All The best. Enjoy yourself! JAI HO - don't forget to include this Oscar winning number and yet another one by same singer (Sukhvinder) CHAK DE INDIA...

FL8hfQIsaa	If you like the show, you'll probably love the movie! I think the show is cool because it's pretty original. I've been living my whole life watching the disney channel, and most have common themes, but nevertheless entertaining. I don't like Harry Potter or all that crap, but wizards of waverly place ad|`|hmXwGhBLaa	The show is great so I am positive the movie will be a big hit too!

3yNh5jO8aa	LOL. i have not had that experience, but something close to it, yes!<br>  <br>  I was going through my parent's garage and found some old cassette tapes that I listened to when I was little. I popped them in the old cassette player that they have and expected it to skip to the next song for me with one press of the button. It was almost frustrating to wait for it to get done making that awful grind sound before it found the next song. technology!
AA11594429	Haven't seen any for years. They used to be shown to fill the odd 10-15 minute slot between other programmes. The older, Fred Quimby ones are the best, like 'Mice Follies' where Jerry runs all the taps to flood the house then freezes the water so he and the nappy-wearing mouse (!) can skate! Great stuff!|`|HskD8XYOaa	I still love Tom & Jerry. I think the older silent ones were best.|`|Y5IUse1vaa	Jings, they are just not the same anymore. I'm forty five and need to watch them when I am babysitting. Many folk think that the advent of the computer generated cartoons, is fantastic, but I think that the original animated ones are the best!!!|`|ttyuhvGPaa	Yep, my favorite versions are the Hanna-Barbera one and Chuck Jones one since they seem the most funny ( and better drawn) to me overall.|`|XiYLKF8Saa	The Original Tom & Jerry is much funnier than the newer ones|`|AA12397473	yea still love the adorable characters. The one with the invisible ink strung to mind when i read your question//lol|`|K9MJwEVkaa	yes lol I still love to watch the Original tom and jerry cartoons
1AyU8a8Saa	Yes, Grey's is the first one with Sadie. Private Practice is the one where Addison comes back to Seattle, the crossover episode.<br>  <br>  At least Ugly Betty is supposed to be new.|`|blZ2KINDaa	Yes, both of them are.
Usx5zMNRaa	Beauty is in the eye of the beerholder.  I don't drink beer.  heh|`|cjLxrrTBaa	I assume you're speaking to the homosexual contingent on this one...|`|rnMZHdCraa	All the time, hun. =D|`|H46ZABMtaa	I've wondered why i am.|`|LMMw8YMwaa	yes i do|`|nqlk9iUCaa	Never have Jimbo, Sorry Mate
oMYGtqubaa	I know he keeps releasing these 'samplers' every now and then...   so, he's definitely keeping his music and name out there...   I guess until things get worked out with his label situation.

BJIo6twUaa	If you are talking about the ones that suppose to follow 4,5,6. I dont think there is anything officially released because i tired to look for them a year or so ago. All i could find is fan made stuff about what they thing the 7, 8, 9 movie should be but never found anything official<br>  <br>  I dont think there was anything written for the  last 3. All i have heard is he does not plan to make the last 3 but there were talks of a total of 9 movies, but he decided not to do them.|`|hQ95u9OLaa	I believe there are upteen versions of books about the characters created by George Lucas.<br>  <br>  In the case of the movies:<br>  <br>  As The Empire Strikes Back came out Lucas projected a sequel Revenge then Return of the Jedi. There would be 3 prequels leading up to Luke and Leia's births and showing how Anakin became Darth Vader. Then finally there would be 3 sequels 7-9 that would either (I'm not sure about this), show Luke, Leia, and Han as elderly or start totally new young characters. I believe that the prequels proved to be such a headache, also they weren't as well-received, that Lucas abandoned his plans to do the last three. He had also aged considerably because the first 3 had taken so long to do.|`|zj6ofKvGaa	Lucas has changed his stand on this a number of times... it started off that he had 9 films envisoned for the Star Wars series.  However, he has now stated that there are only 6 - the 6 that currently exist. <br>  <br>  There are many books that follow on from the events in Return of the Jedi, these all take place in what has become know as the Extended Universe. <br>  <br>  Within all these books, the dates tend to be measured in years after the Battle of Yavin (which took place at the end of New Hope).<br>  <br>  The can be found listed here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_books#Rebellion_Era" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sta...</a>
hfYqrwFcaa	holy crap, I wouldn't do that assignment. Big fat 0 for me!|`|z8jYprWkaa	I think "I doubt if there will be any intelligent questions about today" and I'm usually right.|`|CFKV5ddfaa	i doubt it hun...|`|trMsK86jaa	Well, if i was to let myself use the right-side of my brain fully, and give myself over to absolute doubt, i'd probably seriously consider whether or not the question itself could be considered to be of any doubt.<br>  <br>  Luckily for you i'm not like that.<br>  <br>  :)|`|soBqLlNAaa	I see mist, hear nothing, smell a rat, grey, I'm in a dead end and the opposite to doubt would be sure<br>  <br>  ~x~
0jBjvOuwaa	Type in the song and the word 'download' together on something like Google and many sites may contain places were you can download them.|`|UKtZS3Wraa	purevolume.com has SOME free downloads, but not a lot|`|VqFzDnvOaa	i've used something called frostwire for years.  it's kind of like limewire.  but safer for you.  and safer for the computer too.  no viruses!|`|TaVsnhkIaa	i just go on youtube  and type in - whatever song- free download  then you click the link and bayum (:|`|GpNo5LaQaa	I go to airm3.com, download whatever song I'm looking for, then just open it with iTunes.   Works for me.   =]|`|E0sIo2vnaa	I would suggest the bit torrent route... i.e. isohunt, mininova, demonoid...  first you will need a bit torrent app to convert the files... however, that is a free download.  all you do is to go to the site search for the song/artist/album... and download the torrent. The torrent (used through the bit torrent app) will allow you to connect to peers hosting the file and download from there.     If you select an album or entire discography to download... you can opt to dl as many or as few songs from the album(s) as you wish.|`|slX1k0Ukaa	There are lots of music search engines that you can use to search for music online, eg: http://www.fullsongs.net     Just type in the songs name/author and you'll immediately get results related to your search, you have the option of either listening to the song online/ downloading them. There is even a blog which shows you how to download the songs faster if your speed is too low.    Hope that helped.|`|botjzUXXaa	www.rapsody.com

Its a funny song. Here is a sample.     "Our subject isn't cool, but he thinks it anyway  He may not have a clue, and he may not have style  But everything he lacks, well he makes up in denial  So if you don't rate then overcompensate. You know that you can always go on Rikki Lake."|`|c26203ee73fd1473f3c7eacc6da1eb6daa	uh, what about    Popular - Nada Surf

And I liked how kind Carlisle was...|`|14UfFR3qaa	Jasper|`|GWZmNX92aa	Jasper...mainly because he's not really talked about much in the book or movie.

I'm in the process of writing a book...if it was alright with you if i could use that song, i'd say it was by you and make sure you got credit for it...but i need your permission before i actually do so...|`|l8UAGG0yaa	I think its awesome!!!!!!  you couldbe like the next rihanna  u know what i mean?|`|EYLSyeajaa	oh. ahh.. hmm. uh huh.  well i could lie to you, say its awesome/youre the next rihanna. get 10 points but i have too much respect for anyone with the guts to put their music online for debate/critique to do that..    its not very good. quite frankly i wanted to stop at the 1st two lines. try writing about actual experiences/people in youre life. the best music comes from the writers personal life.    try not to write things so.. shallow, for lack of better word. use nature[ever heard 'like a bird, let me spread my wings'?], objects,['youre my air, my everything' maybe less cheesy] etc to express a deeper message.     keep in mind that theres a difference between shallow and just blunt lyrics though.. im not even suggesting the da vinci code deep.. a miley cyrus 'fly on the wall' depth song should do.     you will get better as you go. practive really does make perfect && not just cause cute is what we aim for says so :x    if you put your songs out there for people to see, youre putting youre work in peoples hand && people can be cruel. dont be disencouraged. people attack others out of jealousy sometimes.     constructive criticism: causes improvement  destructive criticism: causes the more sensitive of us to tear over coffee ice cream at the notebook.. ok we do that anyways!    maybe try co-writing for now ? we cant all start at the top.  haha best of luck !  happy song writinggsss :D|`|roFGlldOaa	YOUR SUPER TALENTED!

5qCiUkTwaa	The twist was that Everything was all in Anna's head    The dream about Matt she was having was really her Hallucinating and she was really outside while Matt was on the cliff he grabbed her wrist to pull himself up but then she yanked her wrist out of his grip because in her Hallucination Matt was really dead and trying to kill her.    When she saw The step-mom and her dad in the room making out she was angered so she went in her moms room grabbed some oil to kill Rachel but left the oil running on accident.  When she pushed Alex out of the way Alex bumped the Lantern on the floor and the fire got to the oil.  Then Anna's and Alex's mom called Alex in and when she walked in she blew up with her mother.    She Never got Alex's letters because she never sent them because she was dead.    She killed Rachel because again she was Hallucinating and in her mind Rachel didn't let her get the knife and Alex was behind her.  But it was really Anna who killed Rachel by stabbing her multiple times and then dragging her to the trash can.  She doesn't remember though because right after she went to sleep and she thought Alex killed her anyway.    In reality Rachel was undressing her to get her out of those day time clothes and slipped on some pajamas for her to wear while she sleeps.  She tranquilized her so she would calm down and just go to sleep.  Alex was just some Imaginary form of her sister that was in Anna's head and she thought was really there until her father said that she died a year ago in the fire (notice on while he said that the Imaginary sister said to not listen to him because it was Anna saying that her father is lieing) and then Alex (the most bloody and the one with the knife in the hand) dissapeared and then Anna became even more bloody and got a knife in her hand.  she saw one last glimpse of Alex in the mirror and then she dissapeared for good.|`|vmbq8s6Oaa	anna is really crazy. she pictured in her mind that rachel was bad & was the one who killed her mother. when really anna was going to kill her dad & rachel, when she accidentally killed her mom AND alex. so when she gets home, in her mind, alex is still alive, but really she died the night of the fire. & in her little mind she thinks that rachel is mildred kemp, when really, mildred kemp is only the woman across from her in the mmental hopsital. so pretty much everyhting that happened was in her mind.|`|iMvz42Zuaa	Mildred Kemp was the one who commited the murders of the three children. Racheal, on the other hand, had nothing to do with the murders. She was only seen as a murderer because Anna felt that she was evil because she couldn't remember her past. So in other words, Anna was only imagining Alex as well, and whatever Alex said was something that Anna wanted to say, but didn't have the courage to say. So Racheal was only seen as a murderer in Anna's eyes, and it's fairly likely that she was either related to the mother whose children were murdered, and that's how she got the necklace, or it could have been a replica, there could be more than one of that same necklace. At the end of the movie, Anna and Alex embrace, and they are seen by their father. After her father tells her that Alex died in the fire, Anna turns to a window, and sees that Alex was never there, and she was the one who killed Racheal.|`|g5wninniaa	ok...well it was shown at the end that alex was actually dead. then they started to show flashbacks that proved she was, they also showed anna pushing her ex bf, matt, off the rock. the reason she did that was because he knew what actually happened. im pretty sure in the beginning also it was sad that the gas valve broke,which caused the house to explode and thats what anna thought the whole time. but her ex said he followed her back and he seen what happened. so when he told her this..she couldnt beleive it and she killed him.    In the beginning when anna left the hospital, that silly lady told her "who am i going to tell my stories to?". at the end when anna was back, it was shown that the silly lady was actually mildred kemp, the nanny who killed the 3 little kids. so this meant that while in the hospital, kemp told anna this story. this made anna believe her stepmom was the killer because she was already crazy in the head. so since she was already in a crazy state...this made her forget everything she was doing and then she realized at the end what she did    i hope this helps!|`|6e2NzNpJaa	Ok - the necklace is that part that confuses me....how did Mildred know that Rachel had it? It seemed like Mildred was the one who wanted Rachel dead (so did Anna) that is why Anna gave her the necklace of the woman that Mildred previously killed -If Mildred was only the Nanny (I thought she was also a nurse) maybe Rachel was the nurse at the time Mildred was the nanny & the husband was the crazy ex-bf that made Rachel chg her name- Mildred was jealous of Rachel & the husband's affair & knew that the sick wife gave her the necklace - so both Anna & Mildred planned out the whole murder?? What do ya all think?|`|yt4DyhPOaa	anna was the one who had killed everyone. rachel didnt do anything. alex died in the fire.|`|xXQDHNDHaa	the daughter is crazy and in fact killed her mom and sister by accident and then killed her step mom.|`|qM4hEWLZaa	I just saw this movie. well the whole beginning of the movie was fake. Anna was in the mental institution for killing her mother and sister and cutting her wrists. When she comes out of the institution she forgets everything that happened and she is just trying to figure out what actually happened. she thinks that her sister and boyfriend are still alive but she is just imagining it. at the end we find out it was all made up and she was really the one that killed Rachel, the dad's girlfriend. she was so messed up that she took the story of Mildred Kemp- one of the people that was at the mental institution with her- and made it up in her head that Rachel was really Mildred Kemp. but really, Rachel was innocent all along. Anna was really the one that was crazy and killed everyone in the first place but she just was so messed up that she made up a story and blamed it on Rachel. She killed Matt, her boyfriend, because she didn't want him to tell her or anyone else what actually happened cause he saw her light the house on accident. The house caught on fire because she was getting gas to kill Rachel but accidentally let the faucet run and when she slams the door the candle fell and when Alex hears her moms bell she comes in and the house burns to flames. Anna kills Rachel in the end and she gets sent back to the mental institution|`|92F2Vhivaa	so everything actually did happen? she was definitely out of the mental institution for a while? i was thinking maybe she was in there the whole time and none of this really happened.  so what does it mean when she told the psychiatrist i just finished what u told me to finish an when she is cutting the step moms face out of the pictures at the end, what does that mean. so does mildred kemp tell anna that because she wants anna to go kill the stepmom or what? i don't really get what the real mildred kemp had to do with it.

cSceVisnaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse_(al...|`|EJJMXnf0aa	MUSIC NEWS-  The much talked about Eminem new cd release, RELAPSE,  has now been delayed until as late as spring 2009. In October, he announced that he was considering releasing his sixth LP before the end of this year, but we guess not.  Relapse will be his first record out since his greatest hits compilation in 2005, when the 35-year-old then stopped performing to focus on producing.  Eminem has insisted that he can't wait to "get back out there" as he promotes his best-selling autobiography The Way I Am, which arrived in October.   But a source told the New York Post the record could now be put back until next year (09), adding: "There was never a release date set."   Another source says, "Eminem has been through a lot. He is being a perfectionist and is completely obsessive-compulsive about this album. There's a 50-50 chance it will be done by the end of this year - but most likely it'll be the first quarter of next year... It's great."   No comment from Eminem.     -=So Late Spring=-|`|GQWuQcjUaa	Early March. Probably the third, or the second. I'm going right to a store to buy that CD when it's that day.
ryLbKatoaa	Used manga tend to be around $5, take or give a little depending on how rare/sought after they are.|`|P7v7Fbt7aa	well i have been buying and collecting loads of manga in my opinion if i were to sell them i would sold them around $3-4 too since the book was rare but since its a second-hand book it makes sense that it will be cheaper then the normal ones Afterall, mangas are expensive and like we need to spend quite a lot of money to get a collection so i think around $3-4 should be okay|`|HBjOKOmOaa	If you originally bought all the manga books for $10 each, you should be at least selling them for 5 bucks! That is what I would do at least. Also I agree with the person before me, the more rare the manga, price it higher! :3 good luck!
dCYFV6qbaa	is rachel realy a what?? rachel is innocent. she didn't do anything bad. anna just didnt like her that's why she killed rachel and also because she thought rachel killed her mom.   she killed matt because matt knew that anna really killed alex and her mom.   the necklace...hmm. ok well the phyco lady is mildred kemp and mildred owned the necklace and rachel just happened to have one that looked exactually like it.|`|Gslf19Uvaa	ok well you know the lady in the plaid shirt at the mental hospital? she's the real mildrid kemp or whatever her name is. she told anna all of her stories, so when anna got out of the hospital, she believed rachel was a ***** and she got the ideas that the movie is about from the lady in the hospital. the necklace is connected because mildred, who killed the three wright children, ttook the necklace. anna basically imagined everything...the whole movie is really her being mentally ill. like, anna was basically reliving/imagining all the things mildred did- she imagined that rachel was mildred. it was pretty confusing at the end...
